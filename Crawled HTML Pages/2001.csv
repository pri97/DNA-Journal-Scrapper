By the EST mapping of 30,683 long cDNAs in silico , 603 cDNA sequences were found to locate on chromosome 22 and classified into 169 clusters. Comparison of the genomic loci of these cDNA sequences with 679 genes already annotated on chromosome 22q revealed that 46 clusters represented newly identified transcribed sequences. To further characterize these sequences, we sequenced 12 cDNAs in their entirety out of 46 clusters. Of these 12 cDNAs, 6 were predicted to include a protein-coding region while the remaining 6 were unlikely to encode proteins. Interestingly, 3 out of the 12 cDNAs had the nucleotide sequences of the opposite strands of the genes previously annotated, which suggested that these genomic regions were transcribed bi-directionally. In addition to these newly identified 12 cDNAs, another 12 cDNAs were entirely sequenced since these cDNAs were likely to contain new information about the predicted protein-coding sequences previously annotated. In the cases of KIAA1670 and KIAA1672, these single cDNA sequences covered two separately annotated transcribed regions. For example, the sequence of a clone for KIAA1670 indicated that the CHKL and CPT1B genes were co-transcribed as a contiguous transcript without making both the protein-coding regions fused. In conclusion, the mapping of ESTs derived from long cDNAs followed by sequencing of the entire cDNAs provided indispensable information for the precise annotation of genes on the genome together with ESTs derived from short cDNAs.

Here we report the complete chromosome sequence of an O157:H7 strain isolated from the Sakai outbreak, and the results of genomic comparison with a benign laboratory strain, K-12 MG1655. The chromosome is 5.5 Mb in size, 859 Kb larger than that of K-12. We identified a 4.1-Mb sequence highly conserved between the two strains, which may represent the fundamental backbone of the E. coli chromosome. The remaining 1.4-Mb sequence comprises of O157:H7-specific sequences, most of which are horizontally transferred foreign DNAs. The predominant roles of bacteriophages in the emergence of O157:H7 is evident by the presence of 24 prophages and prophage-like elements that occupy more than half of the O157:H7-specific sequences. The O157:H7 chromosome encodes 1632 proteins and 20 tRNAs that are not present in K-12. Among these, at least 131 proteins are assumed to have virulence-related functions. Genome-wide codon usage analysis suggested that the O157:H7-specific tRNAs are involved in the efficient expression of the strain-specific genes. A complete set of the genes specific to O157:H7 presented here sheds new insight into the pathogenicity and the physiology of O157:H7, and will open a way to fully understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the O157:H7 infection.

Biochemical as well as genetic studies have strongly suggested that Gal11 is a positive global regulator of transcription. Some reports argue that Gal11 is a negative regulator, however. Here we have adopted the “Mini-array membrane hybridization” to analyze the effect of Gal11 in a genome-wide fashion. This technique has been demonstrated to be reliable to identify genes whose expression is controlled by a specific set of genetic and/or physiological signals. Our experiments indicate that this technique is applicable to profile the gene expression in yeast grown in rich medium. Thus mRNAs of 40% of significantly expressed genes are reduced more than two fold in gal11null yeast, in which only 3% of mRNAs are increased more than two fold. These results strongly suggest that Gal11 functions globally as a positive regulator in vivo . "

The methods contain the time-efficient cloning method of constructing microsatellite-enriched libraries and the economic genotyping method of fluorescent labeling of PCR products. Eighty novel equine microsatellites cloned were efficiently isolated from the enrichment library and analyzed for genotype polymorphism. Of these, 72 microsatellites were analyzed with a good resolution. The average heterozygosity of all loci was 0.52, and the number of alleles ranged from one to 9 with an average of 4.5 alleles. The other eight loci showed multiple bands of PCR products, suggesting the occurrence of microsatellites in a repetitive element, in which the number of microsatellite repeats varies among different members of the repetitive element.We found five homologous groups at flanking regions in comparison with the flanking regions of microsatellites from DNA databases. One of them showed homology to equine repetitive element-2. In the other four homologous groups, the two groups were named equine microsatellite-linked repetitive element-1 (eMLRE-1) and equine microsatellite-linked repetitive element-2 (eMLRE-2) as novel equine repetitive elements identified from equine genome. These data should help the analysis of equine DNA sequences and the design of equine genome markers."
