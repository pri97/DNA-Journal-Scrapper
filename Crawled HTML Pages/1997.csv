In a previous study, 72 actual protein coding regions and their translation initiation sites on the genome of Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803 were determined by Sazuka et al. using protein two-dimensional electrophoresis and microsequening. In this work, we extracted the sequence patterns surrounding translation initiation sites as HMM using the computer program YEBIS. The constructed HMM could recognize all but one translation initiation site. The HMM contains an AG-rich region (5.7 bp on average), as the Shine-Dalgarno sequence exclusively contains purines, upstream of the translation initiation site (-9.7 position on average) and a CT-rich region (4.2 bp on average) just upstreamfrom the translation initiation site. In addition, we found that the second amino acid (+4,5,6) could be classified into two types, one of which had C as their second codon while another of which has a nucleotide distribution relatively similar to the distribution among amino acids in the 72 proteins. This fact corresponds well to our earlier finding that when the second nucleotide of the second amino acid of a translated protein was C, an initial methionine was processed and that otherwise the methionine was intact with high frequency.

Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli are so distant that there exists veryfew conserved landmarks in their genome organisation. Analysis of the conserved cmk rpsA cluster pinpointed the importance of cytosine nucleotide metabolism. In these bacteria, mRNA turnover provides an efficient means to fulfil the need for CDP as a precursor of DNA synthesis. The cmk rpsA operon is responsible for CDP synthesis. This function is self-explained in the case of the cmk gene (which codes for cytidylate kinase). The case of rpsA , that codes for ribosomal protein S1, is more subtle. It is suggested here that S1 is a RNA-binding protein helping polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase, known to be phylogenetically related to S1) to degrade mRNA, or helper molecule involved in other RNase activities. This provides an explanation for the elusive function of PNPase, which generates nucleoside diphosphates (not monophosphates) when degrading RNA. This also accounts for the discoverythat the B. subtilis comR gene product is PNPase. This article brieflydiscusses the availabilityof cytosine nucleotides in eukaryotes, and suggests that they are derived from phospholipids turnover. Finally, the GC content of genomes is discussed in this new light. "

The genome sizes of B. fragilis , B. distasonis , B. eggerthii , B. ovatus , B. thetaiotaomicron , B. uniformis , and B. vulgatus were determined to be 5.3, 4.8, 4.4, 6.9, 4.8, 4.6, and 5.1 Mbp, respectively. B. distasonis and B. vulgatus , and also B. uniformis and B. eggerthii , showed simillar I- Ceu I restriction profiles. I- Ceu I cut B. uniformis and B. eggerthii genomes into four, B. ovatus into five, B. fragilis and B. thetaiotaomicron into six, and B. distasonis and B. vulgatus into seven fragments. On the basis of genome size, restriction profile, and I- Ceu I fragment number, a phylogenetic tree of the Bacteroides species was proposed. This was in overall agreement with the previous phylogenetic tree obtained by 16S rRNAdata, with the exceptions of B. distasonis and B. ovatus . "

Using 114 DNA markers, 258 individual YACs were located on chromosome 4. Sixty-two out of 258 YACs carried two or more DNA marker positions and formed 16 contigs which covered a total length of 17.1 cM. The other YACs were arranged to 23 positions. On chromosome 7, 203 individual YACs were landed on 109 DNA markers. Sixty-four out of 203 YACs formed 15 contigs which covered a total length of 21.8 cM and 139 YACs were localized to 26 positions. Chromosomes 4 and 7 were covered with minimum tiling paths of 45 and 48 YACs, respectively. Taking the average size of YAC insert DNA to be 350 kb and the entire genome size to be 430 Mb, about 16–18 Mb of each chromosome or an estimated 50% of their total lengths have been covered with YACs. Physical maps of these 2 chromosomes should be of great help in identifying useful trait genes and unraveling genetic and biological characteristics in rice."

To search for one of these genes, we determined DNA sequences in the genomic region at 3p22–21.3 where we had previously detected a homozygous deletion in a lung cancer cell line. The DNA sequence results of an about 685-kb region indicated that the size of the homozygously deleted segment was 638,489 bp, in which we identified only four genes including the integrin aRLC and the trans -Golgi p230 genes, both reported previously. The predicted amino acid sequences of one of the two novel genes showed high homology to villin, a human cytoskeleton protein; those of the other gene, termed HYA22, revealed significant homology to YA22, a hypothetical protein predicted from DNA sequences of Schizosaccharomyces pombe . The computer programs HEXON or GRAIL were able to predict three-fourths of the exons; the smallest exon predicted by either program was 46 base pairs. Repetitive sequences contained in the genomic region included 151 copies of the Alu sequence (1 copy/every 4.5 kb), 19 copies of the L1 sequence (1 copy/every 36 kb) , and 10 copies of the THE sequence.

We isolated 22 distinct exons including 6 exons derived from two known genes (PFKL and EHOC-1). Among 16 novel exons, 2 exons matched with human expressed sequence tags (EST) and 7 exons showed homology at predicted amino acid sequence level with proteins from other species. These 16 exons were mapped back to the cosmid contigs, 12 of which were confirmed for their expression by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screening of human cDNA libraries of various tissues. These exon sequences and a transcript map will aid for isolation of corresponding genes which will be identified as candidate genes involved in the pathogenesis of disorders mapped to the 21q22.3 region."

To establish a protocol for efficient analysis of cDNA clones coding for large proteins, we constructed a series of strictly size-fractionated cDNA libraries of human brain, where the average insert sizes of cDNA clones ranged from 3.3 kb to 10 kb. As judged by hybridization analysis with probes derived from mRNAs of known sizes, the libraries with insert sizes up to 7 kb, at least, contained the clones corresponding to full-length transcripts in addition to truncated products of longer transcripts, but few chimeric clones. Using one of the fractionated libraries with an average insert size of 7 kb, the single-pass sequences from both the ends of randomly sampled clones were determined and searched against DNA databases. Approximately 90% of the clones were found to be new with respect to their 5'-sequences, while their 3'-sequences were frequently similar to the registered expression sequence tags. Examination of the protein-coding capacity in an in vitro transcription/translation system showed that about 20% of the clones direct the synthesis of proteins with apparent molecular masses larger than 50 kDa. The set of libraries constructed here should be very useful for the accumulation of sequence data on large proteins in the human brain. "

One potential disadvantage of the original biotinylated CAP trapper protocol is the exposure of mRNA to chemical and enzymatic attacks during the biotinylation of the cap structure, before the first-strand cDNA synthesis (and selection of full-length cDNA by biotinylated cap). Here, we show that the biotinylation of the cap structure is very specific and effective even if biotinylation is performed on the mRNA/cDNA hybrid produced by the first-strand cDNA synthesis reaction. Consequently, mRNA remains protected from chemical and enzymatic degradation during the overnight biotinylation step, thus making it possible to select full-length cDNAs of longer average size. We herein report the efficiency and specificity of the new version of the protocol for cap structure biotinylation and capture of full-length cDNA. "

In the Ng strain of P. polycephalum and its derivatives, mitochondria have a specific plasmid (mF) that promotes fusion of mitochondria. We examined the editing of transcripts derived from the mF plasmid. For analysis, we selected three regions of the plasmid, including a DNA fragment that corresponded to missing conserved domains of the RNA polymerase. In contrast to the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), no RNA editing of the transcripts of the mF plasmid was detected. Our results suggest that the mechanism of transcription of the mitochondrial plasmid is independent of that of mtDNA, indicating that the plasmid has a different evolutionary origin from the mtDNA.

Nested primer sets only covered a 30- to 40-base region of the sequences. Hinf I-digested and self-ligated mouse genomic DNA was used as a PCR template. Only one band for each receptor was seen after PCR. The amplified DNA fragments could direct luciferase production when the luciferase coding sequence was ligated after the fragments. The sequence of the fragment which correspond to the type II receptor showed partial homology with the promoter region of the human TGF-ß type II receptor. Thus, the inverse PCR with highly overlapped primers could be an easy way to isolate the promoter regions of many genes. "
