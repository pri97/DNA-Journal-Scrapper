Target sequences examined are as follows: (i) short repeat: Crossover hot-spot instigator (Chi) sequence, replication termination ( Ter ) sequence, and DnaA binding sequence (DnaA box); (ii) potential stem-loop structure repeats: palindromic unit (PU), boxC sequences, and intergenic repeat unit (IRU); (iii) potential RNA coding repeats: rRNAs, PAIR, TRIP, and QUAD; and (iv) potential protein coding repeats: insertion elements (ISs) and Long Direct Repeats (LDRs). We also examined the distribution of these sequences on leading and lagging strands. We obtained another four statistically significant LDR sequences with more than 187 bp matched to LDR-A near the LDR loci, suggesting that these regions might be used as high recombination hot spots for LDR. Adaptation of individual LDRs to E. coli genome is also discussed on the basis of codon usage. "

Analysis of 3477 segregants using several PCR-based marker technologies, including cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence, derived-CAPS, and single nucleotide polymorphisms revealed 1 ORF in a 6-kb candidate interval. Normal-type rice cultivars have an identical sequence in this region, consisting of 3 exons (558, 318, and 291 bp) and 2 introns (105 and 1471 bp). Dee-Geo-Woo-Gen-type sd-1 mutants have a 383-bp deletion from the genome (278-bp deletion from the expressed sequence), from the middle of exon 1 to upstream of exon 2, including a 105-bp intron, resulting in a frame-shift that produces a termination codon after the deletion site. The radiation-induced sd-1 mutant Calrose 76 has a 1-bp substitution in exon 2, causing an amino acid substitution (Leu [ C TC] to Phe [ T TC]). Expression analysis suggests the existence of at least one more locus of gibberellin 20-oxidase which may prevent severe dwarfism from developing in sd-1 mutants. "

Using a consensus score based on dinucleotide frequencies and intra-species codon usage heterogeneity, denoted by the Z1 parameter, we report the relationship between nucleotide conservation at the translation initiation sites of genes in the Escherichia coli K-12 genome (W3110) and codon usage in its downstream genes. Significant positive correlations were obtained in three regions centered at -13, -4, and +7, which correspond to the Shine-Dalgarno element, the A + T element immediately upstream of the translation initiation site, and the downstream box, respectively.

We hypothesize that A/T-rich scaffold/nuclear matrix attachment region (S/MAR) sequences are involved in the effects of 5-bromodeoxyuridine. We examined an interaction between DNA containing an intronic S/MAR sequence of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene and nuclear halos prepared from HeLa cells. Upon substitution with 5-bromouracil, the S/MAR DNA bound more tightly to the nuclear halos. The multi-functional nuclear matrix protein YY1 was also found to bind more strongly to 5-bromouracil-substituted DNA containing its recognition motif. These results are consistent with the above hypothesis."
