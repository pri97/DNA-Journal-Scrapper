Ziziphus celata, a federally endangered, self-incompatible plant species occurring in Florida, USA, is one species for which genetic resources are necessary to facilitate new introductions and augmentations essential for recovery of the species. We used 454 pyrosequencing of a Z. celata normalized floral cDNA library to create a genomic resource for gene and marker discovery. A half-plate GS-FLX Titanium run yielded 655 337 reads averaging 250 bp. A total of 474 025 reads were assembled de novo into 84 645 contigs averaging 408 bp, while 181 312 reads remained unassembled. Forty-seven and 43% of contig consensus sequences had BLAST matches to known proteins in the Uniref50 and TAIR9 annotated protein databases, respectively; many contigs fully represented orthologous proteins in TAIR9. A total of 22 707 unique genes were sequenced, indicating substantial coverage of the Z. celata transcriptome. We detected single-nucleotide polymorphisms and simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and developed thousands of SSR primers for use in future genetic studies. As a first step towards understanding self-incompatibility in Z. celata, we identified sequences belonging to the gene family encoding self-incompatibility. This study demonstrates the efficacy of 454 transcriptome sequencing for rapid gene and marker discovery in an endangered plant.1. IntroductionWhile genetic information is just one of many tools that may be used to conserve endangered species, the use of such information is often valuable to facilitate recovery efforts and the management of surviving populations.1 Genetic data from endangered species have been used for multiple conservation applications, e.g. to carry out parentage analysis in ex situ breeding and translocation programmes,2,3 and to quantify levels of genetic diversity and identify factors such as founder effects, genetic drift, genetic bottlenecks, and inbreeding that may threaten endangered species.4–6 However, because of the difficulty of isolating genetic markers and the considerable cost and time associated with extensive genotyping of individuals in populations, many conservation-genetic studies have employed relatively small numbers of genetic loci, such as RFLPs, AFLPs, and SSRs (simple sequence repeats, or microsatellites). Increasing the number of sampled loci may increase the precision and accuracy of estimates of genetic structure and population genetic parameters such as levels of genetic diversity and inbreeding coefficients.7 Furthermore, large numbers of genetic loci are necessary to unequivocally assign parentage, which may be very useful for establishing genetically diverse populations of endangered species through the augmentation of existing genetically depauperate populations or the creation of new populations.Recently, however, the number of genomic-scale sequence collections has increased, enabling rapid gene and marker discovery for an increased number of taxa.8 Previously, the development of such genomic resources was largely limited to model organisms; however, recent advances in DNA sequencing technology have reduced the cost and time required for the development of genomic resources, resulting in a rapid growth in the availability of such data, particularly in non-model organisms.9–11 Transcriptome sequencing, which is DNA sequencing of the mRNA pool of a given tissue, has allowed sequencing efforts to focus on the protein-coding portion of the genome, and has become a valuable approach for developing genomic-level resources of the transcribed portion of the genome.8 Next-generation sequencing technologies, such as 454 pyrosequencing, remove many time-consuming steps involved in Sanger sequencing and now facilitate transcriptome sequencing at a minute fraction of the previously required time and cost.10–15 A single-plate run on the 454 GS-FLX titanium pyrosequencing platform typically produces around a million reads averaging 400 bp in length, often resulting in near complete transcriptome coverage.11,16,17 The generation of such large-scale sequence data is enabling gene discovery, molecular marker development, and comparative analyses in ecologically important, non-model plant taxa,11,18–22 including those of conservation concern.23One species for which conservation efforts would be greatly assisted by the establishment of a genome-level resource is Ziziphus celata (Rhamnaceae), a federally endangered, diploid shrub endemic to central Florida, which is currently known from only 14 populations along the Lake Wales Ridge in Polk and Highlands Counties. The species is highly clonal and previous genetic analyses using allozymes,24 RAPDs,25 AFLPs, and SSRs26 found that 9 of the 14 extant wild populations are uniclonal (i.e. each population comprises a single genetic individual). Depending on the method of determining the number of genotypes, the remaining five populations comprise between 22 and 32 genotypes;26 however, unambiguous quantification of the number of genotypes in these populations will require the employment of a larger number of genetic markers. Very little genetic data are presently available for Z. celata, complicating the development of genetic markers, e.g. as of April 2011, only six DNA sequences had been deposited at NCBI for Z. celata, and none of these represented expressed genes. Furthermore, the entire Rhamnaceae family, which contains ~900 species,27 was represented by fewer than 2000 sequences at NCBI. The development of a genome-level resource for Z. celata stands to improve conservation-genetic approaches in Z. celata and to provide a future basis for comparative genomic studies in the Rhamnaceae, which contains economically important crop and ornamental tree and shrub species.Given the small numbers of populations and genotypes of Z. celata, its recovery relies on the augmentation of uniclonal populations and the introduction of multiple genotypes to publicly protected sites containing appropriate habitat;28,29 however, the ability to establish self-sustaining, sexually reproducing, translocated populations has been complicated by the reproductive failure of most experimental crosses. Such reproductive failure has been attributed to self-incompatibility in Z. celata. Self-incompatibility has been documented or proposed in at least five genera in the Rhamnaceae, including Colletia,30Discaria,31,32Frangula,33Trevoa,34 and Ziziphus.25,35,36Gametophytic self-incompatibility (GSI) has been proposed as the system of self-incompatibility in Z. celata based on results from hundreds of experimental hand pollinations, analysis of RAPD data, and studies of pollen tube inhibition.25,35,37 GSI is a system whereby pollen is rejected when its S-haplotype is the same as either of the S-haplotypes present in the pistil.38,39 In four of the five plant families with well-characterized GSI systems, GSI is mediated by the S-RNase gene.38,39 Previous research suggests that a S-RNase-based system of GSI likely evolved only once in Angiosperms,38,39 and the presence of S-RNase-based GSI in the Rosaceae, a plant family which is closely related to the Rhamnaceae, suggests that this is the most likely mechanism causing GSI in Rhamnaceae.An understanding of the genetic basis of self-incompatibility and the ability to assess mating types in Z. celata would greatly facilitate recovery efforts. Previous research has shown that as few as two mating types may be present in Z. celata wild populations,25,35 the minimum necessary to maintain sexual reproduction in a GSI species; however, more mating types may exist, as the compatibility of most genotypes has not yet been tested. The most efficient approach to determine cross-compatibility is to directly sequence the genes that encode the GSI reaction. Another efficient approach is parentage analysis of progeny to provide indirect evidence of compatible mating types; however, more genetic data and molecular markers are required to carry out either of these approaches in Z. celata.In this study, we conducted 454 pyrosequencing of a normalized cDNA library isolated from flowers of three genotypes of Z. celata. Our goals were to (i) characterize the floral transcriptome of Z. celata, (ii) identify and characterize a large number of gene-based markers, including single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and SSRs, for future genetic analyses, and (iii) determine whether analysis of the floral transciptome includes genes belonging to gene family that encodes the GSI reaction. The increased genomic information produced in this study will aid in creating self-sustaining, sexually reproducing populations of this endangered species and bolster comparative genomic studies in a plant family for which very little genetic data are currently available.2. Materials and methods2.1. Tissue sampling, cDNA library creation, and 454 sequencingDuring January–February 2010, we collected several hundred newly opened flowers from each of three Z. celata genets, including the two S-locus mating types confirmed in the wild and one genet of unknown mating type. We collected flowers in sterile RNase-free tubes, which were placed immediately into liquid nitrogen. Flowers from each of the three mating genotypes were then shipped on dry ice to GATC Inc., in Konstanz, Germany. Flowers from the three genotypes were pooled in equal amounts before RNA extraction. RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, cDNA library normalization, and 454 sequencing were performed by GATC staff following previously outlined methods.17 The Z. celata floral cDNA library was sequenced in a half-plate run on a 454 GS XLR70 Titanium genomic sequencer (Roche, Inc.).2.2. Assembly and annotationWe trimmed 454 primer sequences from all reads prior to assembly and removed reads with average quality scores lower than 18. We used Seqman Ngen v2.0 (DNAstar, Inc.) to assemble reads into contigs, as this program has been successful in assembling 454 sequences from transcriptomes.13,17 Because no reference genome exists for Ziziphus, reads were assembled de novo. The assembly was run with a minimum match size of 19 nucleotides, match percentage of 95%, mismatch penalty of 18, and gap penalty of 30 (further information on assembly is available from the authors by request). The resulting contig consensus sequences and remaining singletons were then combined into a single set for the following analyses, except where noted.We annotated the 454 sequences by using local BLASTx40 to align the consensus sequences from the assembled contigs and the singleton sequences to the Uniref50 15.441 and the TAIR9 Arabidopsis thaliana42 annotated protein databases using an E-value threshold of 10-11. BLAST results were passed through a custom Perl pipeline that produced tab-delimited tables containing accession numbers, gene name, taxonomic ID, query length, orthologue sequence length, sequence alignment, E-value, and bit score for each protein matching to the Z. celata 454 sequences. To determine the number of unique genes represented, we filtered these files for redundancy in protein accessions. To assess the taxonomic distribution of BLAST hits, we used a custom perl script that employs a BioPerl package to retrieve hierarchical taxonomic identities for each protein accession ID. Assignment of gene ontology (GO) terms to sequences with BLAST matches to known proteins was then performed by importing the accession numbers for the BLAST hits to unique proteins into Blast2go (version 2.3.6; www.blast2go.org). We based these analyses on the contig consensus sequences with positive BLAST matches to 13 401 unique accessions in the TAIR annotated protein database.2.3. Search for the S-locusIn most other taxa, the female component of GSI is encoded by an S-RNase, a member of the T2 RNase family.38,39 Thus, as a first step towards characterizing the genes involved in GSI in Z. celata, we searched annotation results and carried out BLAST searches to find Z. celata 454 sequences belonging to the T2 RNase gene family. We searched the Z. celata annotation results for the terms ‘T2 RNase’, ‘RNase’, ‘ribonuclease T2’, and ‘S-RNase’. We also created a blastable database of characterized S-RNase sequences deposited at NCBI's dbEST, including Nicotiana alata S2, Antirrhinum hispanicum S2, Prunus avium S1, and Pyrus pyrifolia S4.38 We used BLASTx to align all Z. celata contig consensus sequences and singletons to these sequences with an E-value threshold of 10-10. Once we identified sequences that putatively belonged to the T2 RNase gene family, we translated them to proteins, manually aligned them with amino acid sequences from verified members of the T2 RNase gene family38 using Se-Al,43 and inspected their protein-coding motifs for homology with verified members of the gene family.2.4. Molecular marker characterizationWe used custom perl scripts to locate di-, tri-, and tetra-nucleotide SSRs in the 454 sequences with a minimum length of 12 bp and six contiguous repeating units for di-nucleotide motifs, four contiguous repeats for tri-nucleotide motifs, and three repeating units for tetra-nucleotide motifs. We determined which SSRs occurred in coding regions of genes by extracting the aligned portions of contig consensus sequences that had BLAST matches to annotated protein-coding orthologues in Uniref50, and then used the same algorithm as above to detect SSRs in both the aligned and remaining portions of these contigs. To construct polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers in the flanking regions of SSRs, we used the program BatchPrimer3.44 We created primers with a minimum GC content of 30%, a GC clamp (the last two nucleotides were G or C), a melting temperature between 52 and 55, and we positioned primers to obtain PCR products between 100 and 450 bp.We isolated SNPs in contigs with high coverage depths using the SNP reporter feature in Seqman Pro (DNAstar, Inc.). We identified SNPs with coverage depth of at least 10 and with an alternate allele in a minimum of 20% in all contigs containing >25 reads, in order to obtain an estimate of the transcriptome-wide occurrence of high-quality SNPs. We then enumerated SNPs at sites where coverage depth was at least 8 and where alternate alleles were present at a minimum frequency of 20%.3. Results3.1. Assembly and annotationA half-plate run on the 454 GS-FLX Titanium platform produced 655 337 sequences that, after adaptor and vector trimming, averaged 254 bases in length (Supplementary Fig. S1). Files containing the 454 DNA sequences and quality scores have been deposited at NCBIs Short Read Archive (accession SRA045662). A total of 474 025 reads (72% of total) were assembled into 84 645 contigs, with 181 312 reads remaining as singletons. The average contig length was 408 bases (min = 19, max = 2438), with an average of 5.6 (min = 2, max = 1337) reads assembled per contig (Supplementary Fig. S2) and a GC content of 0.39. The average read length of the singleton sequences was 255 bp, similar to the average length of the reads assembled into contigs (253 bp), and these sequences had an average GC content of 0.37. The mean coverage depth per nucleotide position in the assembled contigs was 3.1 (min = 1, max = 868), indicating reasonably good coverage depth for a half-plate 454 GS-FLX Titanium run. As expected, contig length increased as a function of coverage depth and the number of reads assembled into each contig (Supplementary Fig. S2).BLAST annotation of contig consensus and singleton sequences to a large number of unique genes indicated extensive coverage of the Z. celata floral transcriptome. Results of BLAST searches against the Uniref50 and TAIR9 databases, including the species name, accession number, identity percentage, and E-value, are presented in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2, respectively. Forty-seven per cent of the contig consensus sequences had BLAST hits to annotated proteins in Uniref50, and 43% had BLAST hits to annotated proteins in TAIR9 (Table 1). Smaller percentages of the singleton sequences also had BLAST matches to the annotated protein databases (25% UniRef; 23% TAIR). Nonetheless, the large number of singleton sequences with BLAST matches (Table 1) indicates that unassembled sequences still provide an abundance of valuable sequence information and improve overall transcriptome coverage breadth. In many cases, multiple sequences representing both contigs and singletons had BLAST matches to the same protein. After correcting for redundancy, the combined set of contig consensus sequences and singleton sequences had matches to 22 707 unique proteins in Uniref50, and 16 089 unique proteins in TAIR, indicating that many Z. celata genes are represented (Table 1). Of the 13 514 unique BLAST matches of contig sequences to protein accessions in the TAIR database, 10 808 were annotated to GO terms. Of the assigned GO terms, 6083 were to biological processes, 8036 to molecular function, and 6565 to cellular components, indicating a large functional diversity of genes in the trancriptomic data. The even distribution of assignments of proteins to more specialized GO terms further indicates that the Z. celata 454 sequences represent proteins from a diverse range of functional classes (Fig. 1).

Bars represent the number of assignments of Z. celata proteins with BLAST matches in the TAIR9 database to each GO term.Many contig consensus sequences were sufficiently long to cover full or nearly full transcripts (Fig. 2). Examination of the 36 801 contigs with BLAST matches to protein-coding sequences in the TAIR9 protein database indicates that many contigs were as long as their corresponding full-length orthologous Arabidopsis transcripts (Fig. 2). As coverage depth increased, the ratio of Z. celata contig length/Arabidopsis orthologue length increased, with a large number of Z. celata contig sequences likely covering full-length transcripts (Fig. 2). This indicates that the assembly was of high quality and that we obtained extensive coverage breadth and depth for much of the floral transcriptome.

The dotted line corresponds to a ratio of 1, where 454 contigs are as long or longer than the BLAST matched A. thaliana orthologues.As expected, the vast majority of BLAST hits matched to known plant proteins (Table 2). The abundance of BLAST matches to plant-specific proteins was further indicated by sequences matching nearly as many unique proteins in searches of TAIR as those with Uniref50. There were a small number of BLAST hits to non-plant proteins (Table 2), which may be due to representation of these proteins in Uniref50 by non-plant taxa, short or poor quality consensus sequences in 454 Z. celata contigs, or because the sampled tissues contained other organisms such as pathogens. Number of unique BLAST matches to annotated proteins in different taxonomic groupsNumber of unique BLAST matches to annotated proteins in different taxonomic groupsAnnotation and BLAST searches identified six Z. celata sequences that putatively belonged to the T2 RNase gene family, five of which were isolated from contig consensus sequences and one of which was isolated from a singleton sequence. We translated these Z. celata sequences into amino acid sequences and aligned them with previously characterized, complete T2-RNase amino acid sequences from 12 plant families. Although the 5' and 3' ends of the amino acid sequences were highly variable and difficult to align across taxa, we were able to easily align ~110 highly conserved amino acids, suggesting that the six Z. celata sequences identified in this study are likely members of the T2 RNase gene family. The Z. celata T2 RNases were 115–206 residues in length (347–647 bp) and were shorter than all 12 of the complete T2 RNase sequences (which ranged from 222 to 275 residues). Alignments revealed that the Z. celata T2 RNase sequences did not span the full T2 RNase protein-coding region, as all were truncated on either the 5' or 3' end. We detected significant diversity among the six Z. celata T2 RNases, but additional analyses of these alignments will be necessary to determine whether any of these T2 RNase sequences are orthologues of S-RNase genes that encode the female component of GSI in other taxa.3.2. Molecular marker characterizationSSRs were highly abundant in the 454 DNA sequences, occurring in 17% of sequences from the combined set of contig consensus sequences and singletons. We identified 10 954 di-, tri-, and tetra-nucleotide repeats in the 84 465 contig consensus sequences, and an additional 33 587 SSRs in the 181 312 singleton sequences (Table 3). Although influenced by the criteria used to identify these SSRs, tri-nucleotide repeats were the most common, followed by di- and tetra- nucleotide repeats (Table 3). A total of 11 926 SSRs occurred in contigs with BLAST matches to Uniref50 annotated proteins, of which 4246 occurred in protein-coding regions of these sequences. The density of SSRs was much higher in non-coding regions that followed coding regions than in coding regions (0.0016 SSRs per basepair in coding regions vs. 0.0075 in non-coding regions). Of the three repeat motifs, di-nucleotide repeats were the most abundant in coding regions (2551), followed by tri- (1684) and tetra-nucleotide (11) repeats. Primer design was successful for a much larger percentage of contig consensus sequences (76%) than singleton sequences (23%), presumably because the shorter length of the singleton sequences limited the availability of suitable priming sites. Supplementary Tables S3 and S4 provide primer sequences, GC content, melting temperatures, expected product length, SSR motif, SSR sequence, SSR length, and sequence identification for the SSRs developed from the Z. celata 454 sequences. SNPs were also highly abundant in the Z. celata 454 contigs. Across 1.4 million bases represented by a minimum of 8× coverage, we identified 11 056 SNPs that were present at a minimum frequency of 25%, resulting in a SNP occurrence rate of 0.008 per base, similar to that reported in other 454 transcriptome studies.13,16,17Number of each type of SSRs detected in the Z. celata transcriptome.

Transcriptome assembly, coverage breadth and depth, and gene annotation454 pyrosequencing has arisen as a powerful tool for the sequencing of transcriptomes, and many studies have used de novo assembly of such data to produce and characterize genome-level resources for non-model organisms.11,13,16,23,45 Similarly, a half-plate run on the 454 GS-FLX Titanium platform provided substantial coverage of the Z. celata floral transcriptome, and de novo assembly placed a large fraction (72%) of the 454 sequences into contigs, a large number of which were of considerable length and coverage (Fig 2). BLAST hits to more than 22 000 unique proteins indicate that a large portion of the floral transcriptome was likely sequenced. The large number of diverse GO assignments of these transcripts also highlights the diversity of genes likely represented by these data. Furthermore, many contigs were as long as, or longer than, the corresponding Arabidopsis orthologues, indicating thorough transcript coverage for many genes. These sequences provide a significant genomic-level resource for an endangered plant species and plant family for which very little DNA sequence data previously existed.Nearly all of the unique BLAST matches were to proteins characterized in green plants (Table 3). A small subset, however, were to proteins characterized in other organisms, and could represent contaminant RNA in the floral tissues we sampled. In particular, a reasonably large number of matches were to plant viral genes (Table 3). However, low frequencies of BLAST hits to distantly related taxonomic groups are common in such transcriptome sequencing studies and are often attributable to factors other than contaminant RNA,13,17,45 e.g. these sequences could be short contigs containing little information, genes that have not been well characterized in plants, or novel Z. celata genes.Transcriptome sequencing studies have proven highly valuable for gene discovery, characterization, and variant analysis in both model and non-model organisms.11,16,17,46,47 Here, we detected genes expressed in the floral tissues of Z. celata that are putative members of the T2 RNase gene family, demonstrating that 454 transcriptome sequencing is a useful approach for identifying sequences belonging to specific gene families in non-model organisms. We detected significant variation among amino acid sequences within the gene family, indicating that we may have isolated multiple paralogues. Further phylogenetic analyses and analyses of protein-coding motifs for these sequences will be necessary to determine whether these sequences are orthologues or paralogues of S-RNases. If any of the sequences identified in this study encode the S-RNase gene, future research will focus on genotyping this gene in all individuals of Z. celata, which will allow us to identify rare mating types and determine the compatibility of extant genotypes in this self-incompatible species. An understanding of S-locus diversity in Z. celata will help to establish genetically diverse populations capable of reproducing sexually, thereby increasing levels of genetic diversity in this highly endangered species, with the ultimate goal of forming self-sustaining and demographically viable populations.4.2. Molecular marker characterizationThe 454 pyrosequencing and other next-generation sequencing technologies have increased the opportunity for molecular marker development in non-model study organisms at an unprecedented scale.10,16,17 In addition, the gene-based markers developed from transcriptome sequencing projects have the advantages of higher cross-species transferability.8,48 We detected and characterized an enormous number of SSR and SNP loci that will likely facilitate future evolutionary, ecological, and conservation-genetic-oriented studies in Z. celata. The primer sets developed for candidate SSRs will allow higher density genotyping that will facilitate accurate assessment of the number of extant genotypes in this species. These markers will also be used for parentage analysis of seedlings to identify the parents with the highest fitness and to ensure that translocated populations contain the highest possible levels of genetic diversity. Furthermore, if we are unable to identify the genes encoding GSI, we will employ these SSR markers to carry out parentage analysis to provide indirect estimates of compatible mating types. The thousands of high-quality SNPs contained in deeply covered contigs offer an enormous number of informative sites that will facilitate genome-wide analyses of molecular variation in future studies.4.3. ConclusionsIn this study, we characterized the floral transcriptome, isolated thousands of molecular markers, and identified transcripts that may encode the S-locus in Z. celata, a highly endangered shrub species. This work has taken an important initial step in characterizing the protein-coding portion of the genome of Z. celata, providing a substantial genomic-level resource for an endangered plant species and plant family for which little previous DNA sequence data existed. Indeed, given that very few endangered plant species have been the focus of genomic or next-generation DNA sequencing efforts, Z. celata may now have one of the best-characterized genomes of any endangered plant species. This work also highlights the utility of using next-generation sequencing for marker and gene discovery; we isolated thousands of genetic markers to be used for parentage analysis, and identified members of a specific gene family that may encode GSI in Z. celata. These resources will be employed to facilitate recovery efforts for Z. celata, highlighting the utility of the new technology in rapidly expanding the resources available to conservation biologists to aid in the recovery of highly endangered species.Supplementary DataSupplementary Data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by the US Fish and Wildlife Service (Grant #40181AG003 to C.W.W.), the Florida Division of Forestry Plant Conservation Grants Program, and Archbold Biological Station.We thank Alex Buerkle and Johan Grahnen for assistance with data analysis, Martin Heine and staff at GATC Inc. for technical work; Stacy Smith and Megan Larson for field assistance in collecting Florida Ziziphus flower samples under difficult field conditions; David Bender for acquisition and administration of the USFWS grant; Dennis Hardin and Mike Jenkins of the Florida Division of Forestry for DOF funding, and Eric Menges, Satoshi Tabata, and two anonymous reviewers for comments on previous versions of this manuscript.Supplementary data"

Grant,Craig A. Abel","NO","NO","NO","15 November 2011","Helitron, sequence gain, genome rearrangement","Transposable elements (TEs) can affect the structure of genomes through their acquisition and transposition of novel DNA sequences. The 134-bp repetitive elements, Lep1, are conserved non-autonomous Helitrons in lepidopteran genomes that have characteristic 5'-CT and 3'-CTAY nucleotide termini, a 3'-terminal hairpin structure, a 5'- and 3'-subterminal inverted repeat (SIR), and integrations that occur between AT or TT nucleotides. Lep1 Helitrons have acquired and propagated sequences downstream of their 3'-CTAY termini that are 57–344-bp in length and have termini composed of a 3'-CTRR preceded by a 3'-hairpin structure and a region complementary to the 5'-SIR (3'-SIRb). Features of both the Lep1 Helitron and multiple acquired sequences indicate that secondary structures at the 3'-terminus may have a role in rolling circle replication or genome integration mechanisms, and are a prerequisite for novel end creation by Helitron-like TEs. The preferential integration of Lep1 Helitrons in proximity to gene-coding regions results in the creation of genetic novelty that is shown to impact gene structure and function through the introduction of novel exon sequence (exon shuffling). These findings are important in understanding the structural requirements of genomic DNA sequences that are acquired and transposed by Helitron-like TEs.1. IntroductionHelitrons are class II transposable elements (TEs) that are proposed to propagate by rolling circle replication (RCR) at the DNA level1 and are dependent upon the function of Replicase/Helicase (RepHel) proteins for autonomous transposition.1,2Helitrons show a high degree of sequence plasticity, such that computational predications mainly rely upon the identification of conserved 5'-CT and 3'-CTRR termini,3 a 6–20-bp stem-loop structure near the 3'-terminus,4,5 and predicted integration between AT1 or TT nucleotides.3 Non-autonomous Helitrons are small in size due to lack of an internal protein-coding region, but often remain mobile through the retention of functional trans-acting RepHel proteins.1,2 A high copy number of non-autonomous Helitrons within genomes likely results from evasion of host repression.6 The observed paucities in sequence variation among Helitrons appears indicative of recent bursts in transposition.7,8 Certain groups of class II DNA transposons and Helitrons integrate frequently in proximity to protein-coding regions9 and can affect the structure and function of genes and gene products.7,10 These integrations can result in the modification of transcriptional efficiency,11 as well as introduce transcript splice variation and polyadenylation sites, changes in transcription start and stop sites, and incorporation of novel exon sequence.12,13Helitrons are potent modifiers of genome structure and function due to frequent acquisition and transposition of host genomic DNA, which oftentimes results in exon shuffling or the duplication of gene sequences.4,14–18 The mechanism by which Helitrons acquire novel sequence remains largely unknown,19 but is hypothesized to occur at the DNA level due to transposition of both intron and exon sequences. Furthermore, Helitrons are often chimeric constructs that have acquired DNA from multiple independent loci,16,17 which may occur by a step-wise addition of novel 5'- and 3'-ends that are compatible with the minimal requirements for functioning during RCR.6,10,20 These instances indicate that class II TEs and Helitrons participate in the rearrangement and duplication of genome regions and contribute to the evolution of novel eukaryotic genome functions.21,22TE integration and excision mutations cause phenotypic variation at the individual and population scale,23,24 may be contributing factors to speciation events25,26 and provide the genetic novelties for local adaptation via natural selection.27 The insect order Lepidoptera contains the second largest number of species on earth, some of which cause widespread damage to crop plants. Short repetitive sequences and TEs are important players in the generation of genetic diversity and evolution of Lepidoptera due to integrations within genes,28,29 but the genome-wide affects of TE-derived mutations upon genetic and phenotypic variation remain relatively unknown. The silkmoth, Bombyx mori, is the lepidopteran model species whose ~420 Mb genome sequence assembly is composed of ~43.6% repetitive DNA,30 with most being <500 bp.31,32 Nearly 13% of the B. mori genome comprise short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs),33 which are class I TEs derived from tRNA, 5S rRNA or 7SL RNA-like sequences that propagate by retrotransposition.34 In contrast, DNA-based class II TEs occupy ~3% of the B. mori genome (Helitrons 0.1%),33 and are mostly located within introns and non-coding DNA of Lepidoptera.35 This dearth of TE knowledge among lepidopteran species has resulted in difficulty in interpreting their role in the generation of structural and functional genome variance.The Lep1 box is a conserved 99-bp repetitive DNA sequence originally described within intron and untranslated regions from eight lepidopteran species.36 The Lep1 box retains homology +10 to -50 of the core repeat, which was later described as the 134-bp lepidopteran-specific common sequence 3 (LSCS3).37 In the following, we annotate the Lep1 element as a Helitron-like TE and indicate that multiple novel DNA sequences have been acquired and propagated by the Lep1 Helitron. The conservation of predicted secondary structures between the ancestral Helitron and an acquired terminal region offers significant insight into the mode of Helitron propagation and features within the acquired sequence required for propagation. Lep1 Helitrons and acquired sequences co-localize with gene-coding regions in the B. mori genome, cause structural gene mutations, and are important mediators of genome-wide mutation.2. Materials and methods2.1. Annotation of the Lep1 HelitronAll annotations are made with respect to the reverse complement of the LSCS3 sequence37 that includes the 99-bp Lep1 box36 and from hereon is referred to as Lep1. Sequences showing homology to Lep1 were retrieved from the GenBank non-redundant (nr) nucleotide database via a BLASTn search that used Lep1 as the query (conducted 11-04-2010), with output filtered for =70% homology over =100 bp. Similarly, GenBank dbEST accessions for species of Lepidoptera were downloaded in FASTA format (10 November 2010), imported into a local databases using BioEdit,38 queried using Lep1, and results filtered and aligned as described previously. All lepidopteran DNA sequence accessions that passed filter criteria were downloaded in FASTA format, imported into the MEGA 5.0 sequence alignment application,39 and a multiple sequence alignment was made using the ClustalW algorithm (default parameters: gap opening penalty, 15; gap extension penalty, 6.66; weight matrix IUB, and transition weight, 0.5) in the MEGA 5.0 alignment module.39Sequence homologies flanking the Lep1 sequence were identified by performing an ‘all vs. all’ search using the BLASTn algorithm using all nr and dbEST ‘hits’ to Lep1. The regions of intraspecific DNA sequence homology were extracted from accessions using a custom PERL script, and then used as input into the Mfold DNA secondary structure server40 (http://mfold.rna.albany.edu/?q=mfold/DNA-Folding-Form) with the partial function and pair probabilities = 25°C.2.2. Estimation of Lep1 genome copy number and distributionScaffolds from the B. mori whole genome sequence build v. 2.3 were downloaded from Kaikobase (http://sgp.dna.affrc.go.jp/pubdata/genomicsequences.html; file assembledset.txt.gz) and imported into a local database using BioEdit.38 Build v. 2.3 was searched with Lep1 as the query using the BLASTn algorithm and results filtered for ‘hits’ showing =80% similarity over =50 bp. The putative BmLep1 integration positions were called the BmLep1 model v. 2.3, which was then merged with positions of the B. mori assembly v. 2.3 gene models (file: glean_cds_on_chr.gff at http://sgp.dna.affrc.go.jp/pubdata/genomicsequences.html). The combined features were displayed using CMap.41 Sequence intervals for BmLep1 elements were retrieved from the assembled B. mori scaffold for chromosome 1 (Z chromosome) using a custom PERL script, reverse complements generated using the Sequence Manipulation Suite (SMS) at http://www.bioinformatics.org/sms2/rev_comp.html, and FASTA formatted text imported into MEGA 5.0.39 A multiple sequence alignment was made for all B. mori Lep1 elements using parameters described earlier, gamma parameter estimated, and a maximum likelihood-based estimation of Lep1 phylogenetic relationship made using the general time reversible model of sequence evolution. Nucleotide sites were chosen using a partial deletion of missing characters (cut-off = 0.05), and all possible trees were interrogated using the Close-Neighbor-Interchange heuristic. Node support was acquired using 1000 bootstrap pseudoreplicates reported within a strict consensus tree.The frequency of Lep1 integrations within species of Lepidoptera was investigated using full bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) insert sequences from Bicyclus anynana, B. mori, Heliconius melpomene, H. numata, Helicoverpa armigera, Papilio dardanus, and Spodoptera frugiperda. These sequences were downloaded from NCBI, imported into BioEdit,38 and a search for Lep1 positions performed as described previously. The mean frequency of Lep1 integrations were calculated manually and significance of frequency differences among species was assessed using F-statistics (significance threshold a = 0.05).2.3. Predictions of haplotype variation caused by Lep1 elementsNucleotide accessions from the NCBI nr database were used to query derived protein sequences within the nr protein database using the blastx algorithm and results filtered for ‘hits’ showing =50% identity. Proteins derived from orthologous lepidopteran genes that were not identified within the initial Lep1 screen (see 2.1), but present within the blastx output were compared manually to predict instances of copy number variation within or between species. Lep1copy number variation at orthologous loci among species was further investigated using integration/excision variation among cadherin gene sequences from B. mori (gene model: BTGIBMGA013616), H. armigera (GenBank accession: AY714876.1), and Ostrinianubilalis (DQ000165.1). Sequences were imported into a local database in BioEdit,38 searched using with Lep1 as the query and alignment of exon 1, intron 1, and exon 2 using the MEGA 5.0 sequence alignment application39 was created as described previously.2.4. Predictions of Lep1 modification to gene structure De novoAcquisition of transcribed Lep1 sequences was performed for O. nubilalis, where total RNA was isolated from whole larvae using RNAagents kit (Promega, Madison, WI) and cDNA was synthesized using the SMART cDNA Synthesis Kit (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) according to manufacturer's instructions, RACE reactions using the CDSIII primer (Clontech) with OnLep1-f2 (5'-TAC TRA TAT TAT AAA GCT GAA GAG TT-3') and SMART V with OnLep1-r (5'-GAT AAA TGG GCT ATC TAA CAC TGA AAG-3'), and amplified according to manufacturer's instructions. PCR fragments were cloned, and sequenced using T7 and SP6 primers, and resulting sequence data were assembled into contigs using CAPs42 as described previously. Contigs were annotated using the Blast2Go suite,43,44 where the GenBank nr protein database was interrogated using the BLASTx algorithm.3. Results and discussion3.1. Annotation of the Lep1 HelitronA conserved 99-bp Lep1 box was previously described in eight lepidopteran species3,6 and later described as portion of a 134-bp consensus LSCS3.3,7 Our homology-based searches of the GenBank nr/nt database resulted in the estimation of 618 regions within 210 nucleotide sequence accessions from Lepidoptera that show =70.0% similarity to Lep1 (32 species; mean similarity: 80.3 ± 5.8% over 120.5 ± 19.0 bp; Supplementary Table S1). Eighteen of these Lep1-containing accessions were annotated as microsatellite loci and 51 Lep1s were within introns or untranslated regions of known genes. The remaining 526 Lep1s were within un-annotated sequences from BAC full inserts of the lepidopteran species B. mori, B. anynana, S. frugiperda, H. armigera, H. melpomene, H. erato and P. dardanus. An analogous search of the GenBank dbEST database identified 443 accessions from lepidopteran species that showed =71.1% interspecific similarity with 84 of these dbEST hits being =130 bp (Supplementary Table S2). Multiple sequence alignment of GenBank nr/nt and dbEST accessions that contained full-length Lep1 elements resulted in a 197-bp consensus that shared Helitron-like 5'-CT and 3'-CTRY termini,1 and were, respectively, designated as region H1 and region H2 of Lep1 (Fig. 1A). The nucleotides directly adjacent to the 5'- and 3'-ends consisted of TA or AA in 96.2% of predicted Lep1s and showed not discernable target site duplications which are consistent with previously described Helitron genomic integration events.1,3,7Alignment of Lep1 Helitron sequences from species of Lepidoptera.

In addition to 5'-CT and 3'-CTRY termini, the formation of a 3'-stem-loop (hairpin) near the 3'-terminus are hallmarks of Helitron TEs and suggest important roles of these structures in RCR or genome integration.6,10,20 A second conserved stem-loop (hairpin) structure was predicted from B. mori and H. melpomene Lep1s that we designated the 5'-inverted repeat (5'-IR). This 5'-IR involves base pairing between portions of the 5'-subterminal inverted repeat (SIRa) and the microsatellite loop, and are analogous to the 5'-IR formed by the Helitron-like Drosophila interspersed nuclear element (DINE-1) family of TEs7 and the lepidopteran microsatellite associated interspersed nuclear element (MINE-1).35 Specifically, the B. mori GenBank accession D86623.1 is predicted to have a 7-bp 5'-IR formed by a portion of the 5'-SIRa sequence [ACTAATATT-7nt-GGAAAGATTTGTTT] (nucleotides involved in intramolecular base pairing are underlined; <U+0394>G = –0.83 kcal mol-1; Fig. 2A), and the 6 bp 5'-IR in H. melpomene Lep1s are formed between later six nucleotides of the 5'-SIRa and the (GTTT)n microsatellite loop (<U+0394>G = –0.99 kcal mol-1; Fig. 2B). The conservation of hairpin structures adjacent to both the 5'- and 3'-termini among 460 of 618 (74.4%) of Lep1s predicted among nr database accessions suggests a role in the RepHel protein recognition, nascent strand cleavage, or other portion of the RCR mechanism,5,7,10,18,20 but further investigation is required to elucidate their role. The secondary structure conserved among Lep1 elements. (A) Bombyx mori GenBank accession D86623.1 and (B) Heliconius melpomene GenBank accession CR974474.4 positions 69 560–69 971. Helitron-like features include 5'-CT and 3'-CTRY termini, a 3'-stem-loop is located two to three nucleotides upstream of the 3'-CTRY terminus (nucleotide with parallel grey bars), and a 5'-SIR that is complementary to a 3'-SIR (nucleotide with parallel black bars). Nucleotides involved in the formation of a 5'-IR are paralleled by yellow bars and the structure is shown within the boxed area for H. melpomene.The secondary structure conserved among Lep1 elements.

Nucleotides involved in the formation of a 5'-IR are paralleled by yellow bars and the structure is shown within the boxed area for H. melpomene.Structural predictions for Lep1 further indicated that intramolecular base pairing may occur between nucleotides immediately downstream of the 5'-CT and a region 26–37 nt upstream of the 3'-CTRY terminus and involve interaction of the SIRa. Specifically, nucleotides of the 5'-SIRa from B. mori accession D86623.1 [ACTAATATT-7nt-ATAAAGATTTGTTT] are predicted to pair with the 3'-SIRa [AAAATTCTTTTCCATTAGA] located 49 bp downstream (nucleotides involved in base pairing are underlined in; <U+0394>G = –5.92 kcal mol-1; Fig. 1A). Analogous structures were predicted from H. melpomene (Figs 1A and 2B) as well as all other full-length Lep1s (Fig. 1A; all data not shown). These molecular interactions of Lep1 contribute to an overall secondary structure that is stable at 25°C for B. mori (<U+0394>G = –19.74 kcal mol-1) and H. melpomene (<U+0394>G = –11.90 kcal mol-1; Fig. 2), and is analogous to the structure formed by the MINE-1 Helitron from Lepidoptera.353.2. Annotation of acquired end sequencesHelitrons modify the structure of genomes through the acquisition and transposition of novel DNA sequence that occurs by a largely unresolved mechanism.19,20 We described the consensus Lep1 element sequence from 31 accession for species of Lepidoptera that shared Helitron-like termini at the border of regions H1 and H2 (Fig. 1A), but also identified 62–342-bp sequence regions downstream of the 3'-CTRY terminus at the boundary of region H2 that are shared within a species. The novel shared sequences downstream of the 3'-CTRY were referred to as region H3. Specifically, the region H3 showed =62.3% similarity between species and =95.7% similarity within a species or closely related species such as between the 55- and 59-bp region H3 from Helicoverpa species H. armigera (GenBank accession: FP340429.1) and H. zea (EU327673.1; Fig. 1B). Among region H3 sequences from the same species or closely related species, sequence similarity terminated at a ubiquitous 3'-CTAG motif that was followed by a thymidine nucleotide (T; Figs 1B and 3), and only one variant of the H3 region was described within a species. The Lep1s predicted from the B. mori genome assembly shows two unique 87- or 335-bp sequences within region H3 that were, respectively, represented by GenBank accessions: DQ242656.1 and D86623.1 (Fig. 1B). The B. mori Lep1 Helitrons with an 87- or 335-bp region H3 were subsequently called BmLep1_87 and BmLep1_335 variants, respectively, and alignments showed no discernable homology (Fig. 3). Phylogenetic reconstruction of B. mori Lep1_87 and _335-bp Helitron variants from chromosome 1 suggested that two weakly supported clades may exist, which indicated that Lep1s have evolved independently within the B. mori genome through the acquisition of two different downstream sequences (Supplementary Fig. S2; gamma parameter rate distribution <U+03B3> = 3.9894; Log likelihood = D = –3729.34). Independent gain of sequence mutations has previously been identified for Helitrons in the maize genome6,10,20 and indicate that arthropod genomes are also modified by Helitron movements. Alignment of nucleotides for secondary structure of Bombyx mori Lep1 Helitrons. The 5'-SIR form alternate hairpin structures with either a 5'-invered repeat (5'-IR; yellow arrows) or a 3'-SIR within the Lep1 consensus Helitron (black arrows), as well as a 3'-SIR within the acquired Helitron end sequence (red arrows) within both the 87- and 355-bp acquired regions. Two hairpins are formed, one at the 3'-terminus of the Lep1 Helitron and one within each of the 87- or 335-bp acquired Helitron end sequence (grey arrows). The 3'-termini of the ancestral Lep1 Helitron and the acquired end sequences are, respectively, composed of CTAY and CTAG motifs (yellow highlighted nucleotides).Alignment of nucleotides for secondary structure of Bombyx mori Lep1 Helitrons.

The 3'-termini of the ancestral Lep1 Helitron and the acquired end sequences are, respectively, composed of CTAY and CTAG motifs (yellow highlighted nucleotides).Although the sequences in region H3 share little interspecific sequence similarity, the secondary structures predicted to form appear to be identical by state with those formed in region H2. Specifically, the 7–9-bp 3'-stem-loops (hairpins), respectively, formed in region H3 of BmLep1_87 and BmLep1_335 Helitrons (<U+0394>G = –7.90 kcal mol-1) are more highly stable compared with the analogous structure in the ancestral region H2 (<U+0394>G = –2.99 kcal mol-1; Fig. 3). This evidence may suggest that Helitrons are dependent upon a 3'-stem-loop directly upstream of the 3'-CTAG terminus for RCR function,5 and that acquired sequences undergo selection for the capacity to support propagation by RCR.20 A functional switch from use of ancestral to derived Lep1 Helitron ends may have been influenced by the comparatively higher stability we predicted for 3'-stem-loops within the Lep1 acquired sequence. Thereby, functional shifts could occur when equally or more efficient terminal structure are encountered by change within flanking DNA or swapped between other Helitrons. In contrast, reduction in 3'-stem-loop stability in region H2 also could have resulted from degradation following the relaxation of selective constraints, and would mirror the degradation of a Helitron-like 3'-CTAG terminus that followed accretion by maize Helitrons.20Additionally, intramolecular base pairings we predicted between the 5'-SIRa (region H1) and 3'-SIRa (region H2; Fig. 1A) are analogously formed through interaction of nucleotides within the 5'-SIRa of the ancestral Lep1 region H1 and a 3'-SIRb within the derived region H3 (Fig. 1B). These interactions between the 5'-SIRb and 3'-SIRb in B. mori Lep1_87 and _335-bp Helitrons (<U+0394>G = -2.56 kcal mol-1) is lower than between the 5'-SIRa and 3'-SIRa (<U+0394>G = -5.92 kcal mol-1; Fig. 3), but remain consistent with the characteristic secondary structures described previously for insect Helitrons.7,45 The formation of a hairpin between the 5'-SIR and 3'-SIRs within both the ancestral and acquired regions indicates that, in addition to the 3'-stem-loop structure, the base pairing between SIRs at proximal and distal ends of Lep1 may potentially be required from RCR. Furthermore, the requirement for a 3'-SIR within the independently acquired DNA sequences in proximity to a 3'-CTAG novel terminal motif could suggest that gain of sequence mutations by Lep1 may be rare. This hypothesis could be supported by our description of two Helitron variations in the B. mori genome, which contrasts with the high number of cryptic Helitrons from the maize genome where functional constraints appear to be relaxed.17The described accretion by lepidopteran Helitrons involves sequences that are relatively small and added in a unidirectional fashion. DNA sequence upstream of the single 5'-CT terminal motif showed no homology among integrations in lepidopteran genomes or conserved secondary structures that would be indicative of a chimeric Helitron.46 These observations are analogous to those described by Yang and Bennetzen.8Lep1 was not shown to capture entire genes, but may be due to inability to accurately describe haplotype variation from available data resources or the possible culling of the mutations from genomes due to negative affects on genome function.47 Smaller non-autonomous Helitrons are better able to evade host repression6 or show greater replication efficiency within the RCR mechanism.48Lep1s also appears to gain sequence only at the 3' end, which contrasts with bidirectional end creation by maize Helitrons.20 This directionality of Lep1s may result from the preferential capture that is known to occur in the same orientation as the RepHel-coding sequence of the autonomous Helitron, but this cannot be ascertained until further research is preformed to identify the parent TE of the non-autonomous Lep1 element.3.3. Lep1 copy number and genome distributionThe variation in non-autonomous Helitrons copy number among species of Lepidoptera may result from differential effects of replicative repression via DNA methylation,49 mutation-selection balance within the overall genome architecture,50 or random genetic drift at the population scale. We showed that Lep1 Helitron integration densities range from 1.04 × 10-5 to 1.8 × 10-4 based upon annotation of full BAC insert sequences. These estimates indicated that Lep1s have an ~13-fold copy number difference across species' genomes (Table 1), and is comparable to the ~11-fold variance observed among DINE-1 insertions within Drosophila genomes.7 The highest Lep1 copy number density was estimated for the butterfly P. dardanus, wherein Lep1 abundance was significantly higher than for all other species except for B. anynana (P-values =0.0089; Student's-t values not shown). The mean Lep1 integration density among butterflies (6.9 × 10-5 ± 6.8 × 10-5) is not significantly different from the densities estimated among moth species (mean: 2.5 × 10-5 ± 2.0 × 10-5; F-statistic = 1.4; d.f.num = 1; d.f.den = 2; P-value = 0.3583).

Respective GenBank accessions and positional information is provided in Supplementary Table S1.Estimated frequency of Lep1 Helitrons per mega base (Mb) in species of LepidopteraEstimates from BAC full-insert sequences. Respective GenBank accessions and positional information is provided in Supplementary Table S1.The only whole genome sequence available for use to directly estimate the TE frequencies in Lepidoptera is the 432 Mb B. mori assembly (build v.2.3),30 from which we estimated 5541 putative BmLep1 integrations. Each putative BmLep1 Helitron was assigned a unique identifier (BmLep1_000001 to BmLep1_005541), and further categorized as containing either the BmLep1_87 or BmLep1_335 variant downstream sequence described previously (Supplementary Table S3). The ancestral regions of the Lep1 Helitron (regions H1 thru H2;) within build v. 2.3 showed =94.3 ± 1.9% similarity with the B. mori Lep1 elements from accessions DQ242656.1 and D86623.1 (Fig. 1B). This paucity of Lep1 sequence evolution within the B. mori genome may indicate a recent burst in transposition,7,8 or a high degree of functional conservation. The density of B. mori Lep1s estimated from the genome sequence (1.3 × 10-5) is ~2-fold lower than that estimated from BAC full inserts (2.5 × 10-5; Table 1), and highlights the error that may be associated with subsampling from BAC sequences. Mapping the positions of BmLep1 onto chromosome assemblies indicated that integrations are co-localized with protein-coding genes (Supplementary Fig. S1; chromosome 1 shown in Fig. 4), which agrees with seminal evidence of Lep1 being within gene intervals.36 Furthermore, Lep1 proximity to B. mori gene-coding regions suggests that Lep1s may affect gene structure and function on a genome-wide scale.9,20 The effects of Lep1 Helitron integrations upon gene structure and function are for the first time presented in Section 3.4. Lep1Helitron integration positions on the Bombyx mori chromosome 1. Lep1 model v. 2.3 showing positions of the whole genome assembly via a CMap output.

Lep1 elements modify gene structureThe movement and propagation of TEs introduce haplotype variation,51 and alter gene functions when integrated within coding regions of a genome.28 TEs are present within insect ESTs52 and mature transcripts of D. melanogaster,53 and can cause alternative the modification of cis-regulatory function,54 introduction of frameshift and premature stop codon mutations,28 and be involved in exon shuffling18 or insertion of introns.55 Evidence that Lep1s co-localize with protein-coding genes in B. mori genome (section 3.3) suggests that integrations may affect the structure and function of lepidopteran genes, and that presence/absence mutation at orthologous loci may be a source of function genetic variation among species. Comparison among orthologs of the cadherin gene from B. mori, H. armigera, and O. nubilalis genomes showed that Helitron copy number variation is present. Specifically, a nucleotide sequence with 68.7% similarity to the Lep1 consensus was predicted within the H. armigera cadherin intron 1, whereas orthologous introns from B. mori or O. nubilalis show no Lep1-like sequence (Fig. 5A). Although the effects of this integration upon gene function was not investigated, TE integrations within introns are known to affect splicing efficiencies56 and indicated that Lep1s are a source of genome copy number variation between lepidopteran species.

Sequence from RACE products were assembled into 8 contigs and 14 singletons (3.56 ± 1.94 reads per contig), and 21 of these contigs were subsequently annotated as having a Lep1 integration (Supplementary Fig. S3). Functional annotation of these contigs indicated that all transcript-derived O. nubilalis Lep1 Helitrons were within intron or untranslated regions (data not shown), with the exception of contig04. Contig04 was predicted to show 85% amino acid similarity to the S. frugiperda allatotropin neuropeptide (at2a; GenBank accession CAD98809.1) and that a Lep1 Helitron integration had occurred within the protein-coding regions in the O. nubilalis ortholog (Fig. 5B). When compared to the 53 aa S. frugiperda at2a gene sequence, the C-terminal 37 aa of the 64 residue O. nubilalis ortholog was predicted to be encoded by regions H2 and H3 of an integrated Lep1 Helitron (Fig. 5B). The integration inserted a novel protein-coding sequence that contains a TAA stop codon and changed the predicted molecular weight and isoelectric point of the O. nubilalis at2 protein (pI ~10.87; 13.6 kDa) compared with that of S. frugiperda (pI = 11.4; 6.1 kDa). The affect of these changes on protein function was not investigated further, but indicated that the Lep1 Helitron can affect the structure and function of gene coding sequences in Lepidoptera.In conclusion, a comparative genomics approach was used to identify novel sequences acquired by the highly conserved ancestral Lep1 Helitron. Although the primary sequence among gained sequences are variable, a conservation of secondary structures showed that sequence identity by state is an important factor in determining the success of acquired genomic regions for in subsequent transposition events within the genome. Lep1 provides insight into the structural requirements for RCR in animal Helitrons. Furthermore, the prevalence and preference of Lep1 integrations in proximity to gene-coding regions shows that this class of Helitrons impacts the structure and function of genomes in which they reside.Supplementary dataSupplementary Data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by the USDA Current Research Information System (CRIS) project number 3625-22000-017-00D.This research was a joint contribution of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service and the Iowa State University outreach station, Ames, IA (Project 3543).

We discovered and mapped new expressed sequence tag-single nucleotide polymorphism (EST-SNP) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers and constructed a high-density genetic map. By screening 149 650 ESTs, 5246 SNPs were detected in silico, of which 1536 corresponded to genes with a putative function, while 851 had a clear polymorphic pattern across a collection of genetic resources. In addition, 409 new SSR markers were detected on the Criollo genome. Lastly, 681 new EST-SNPs and 163 new SSRs were added to the pre-existing 418 co-dominant markers to construct a large consensus genetic map. This high-density map and the set of new genetic markers identified in this study are a milestone in cocoa genomics and for marker-assisted breeding. The data are available at http://tropgenedb.cirad.fr.1. IntroductionTheobroma cacao L. is a diploid species (2n = 2x = 20) with a small genome ranging in size from 411 to 494 Mb.1 According to Cheesman,2 its centre of origin is at the lower eastern equatorial slopes of the Andes.Theobroma cacao is grown as a major cash crop that provides income to 14 million small-scale farmers in more than 50 tropical countries. However, cocoa production is markedly affected by a number of major diseases caused by several Phytophthora species, or by Moniliophthora perniciosa and Moniliophthora roreri. Several sources of disease resistance have been identified and the search for sustainable disease resistance by cumulating the different resistance genes is one of the major challenges facing T. cacao-breeding programmes.3 The quality of chocolate is another important trait in cocoa breeding, and consumer demand for high-quality chocolate is increasing. A better understanding of the molecular and genetic bases of these traits is a key goal of cocoa genetic research.High-density genetic maps are essential tools for trait genetic studies. Several molecular marker types have been developed in T. cacao in recent decades: restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), microsatellites or simple sequence repeats (SSRs), random amplified polymorphic DNA, amplified fragment length polymorphism and isozymes.4–6 Among them, only RFLP, SSR and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) are co-dominant markers, and therefore more powerful for genetic analyses. Compared with RFLP, the advantage of SSR and SNP markers is that they can be revealed using high-throughput technologies with scant amounts of DNA. Semagn et al.7 made a detailed comparison of the characteristics of each kind of marker. A high-density cocoa linkage map enriched with SSR genomic markers, including only co-dominant markers, was developed by Pugh et al.8 More recently, that map was supplemented with 114 EST-SSRs.9In recent years, the use of SNP markers has substantially increased in plant genetics such as in Arabidopsis,10 grapevine,11 wheat,12 and also a few woody perennial species.13–15 SNP is one of the most abundant types of DNA sequence polymorphism and the SNP markers are suitable for large-scale genome analysis using high-throughput automated genotyping techniques. SNPs have been used to construct high-resolution genetic maps16,17 or to trace evolution, particularly in the human genome, using large-scale SNP datasets.18,19 Knowledge of nucleotide substitution dynamics is an important basis for molecular evolutionary studies, phylogeny reconstruction and natural selection studies.20,21 Transitions are generally observed with higher frequencies than transversions. During natural selection, transitions are better tolerated because they generate more likely synonymous mutations in protein-coding sequences than transversions.22–25Of existing SNP markers, EST-SNPs (i.e. SNPs located within a gene expressed sequence) are of particular interest for studying functional genetic diversity and identifying candidate genes as the functional base of quantitative trait loci (QTLs). EST-SNPs have been developed for numerous plant models such as melon,26,27Brassica rapa,28 barley,29 poplar,14 and sugarcane30 to detect QTLs for many traits and facilitate the selection of resistant and productive plants. In T. cacao, a few SNPs were detected in ESTs from expression libraries representing T. cacao/M. perniciosa interactions.31In our study, we discovered and mapped several hundred EST-SNP markers detected in an exhaustive collection of cocoa ESTs32 homologous to genes with a known function. These SNP markers were supplemented by 163 new SSR markers to construct a very high-density genetic map suitable for large-scale genetic studies.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Plant materialSNP polymorphisms were screened in a collection of diverse germplasm representing the major part of the T. cacao diversity and two existing mapping populations denominated UPA402 × UF676 and F2.The collection of diverse germplasm consisted of 249 genotypes from various genetic groups and geographical origins (Table 1). Most of these accessions are maintained at the International Cocoa Genebank (ICG) at the Cocoa Research Unit (CRU), University of the West Indies, Trinidad and Tobago. Theobroma cacao genotypes of various geographical origins used to screen the polymorphism of the 1536 GoldenGate SNP panelTheobroma cacao genotypes of various geographical origins used to screen the polymorphism of the 1536 GoldenGate SNP panelThe UPA402 × UF676 mapping population consisted of 264 individuals derived from a cross of two unrelated heterozygous tree accessions; UPA402, an Upper Amazon Forastero from Peru, and UF676, a Trinitario (Forastero × Criollo hybrid) selected in Costa Rica. This progeny was maintained by Centre National de Recherche Agronomique (CNRA) in Bingerville and Divo, Côte d'Ivoire. It was used to establish genetic map as a reference in our laboratory.4,6,8,9 We mapped the new SSR and SNP markers in this population.The F2 second progeny of 132 individuals was obtained by selfing a hybrid between two heterozygous parents: Scavina 6, an Upper Amazon Forastero collected in Peru, and ICS1, a Trinitario selected in Trinidad. This progeny was produced by Comissão Executiva do Plano da Lavoura Cacaueira (CEPLAC) at Itabuna, Brazil.Most of the ESTs screened for SNPs had been obtained from the contrasting genotypes Scavina 6, an upper Amazon Forastero genotype from Peru and ICS1, a Trinitario selected in Trinidad, a hybrid between a Criollo from Central America and a Forastero from Lower Amazonia of Brazil.These two genotypes, which represent the three distinct genetic origins, Upper Amazon Forastero, Lower Amazon Forastero, and Criollo, were also the parents of the F2 population from Brazil used to map SNPs.Eleven other genotypes were involved in the construction of the cDNA libraries and SNP identification: B97-CC2, a Criollo from Belize, P7, IMC47, UPA 134, Upper Amazon Forastero genotypes from Peru, Jaca, an Upper Amazon Forastero from Brazil, GU255V, collected in French Guiana, B240 and 33–49, two Nacional genotypes from Ecuador, UF676, UF273, two Trinitario, and seedlings from a hybrid selected in Papua New Guinea.SSRs were screened in three T. cacao genotypes: the two parents of the reference map (UPA402 and UF676), and the sequenced Criollo genotype (B97-61/B2).2.2. DNA extraction and purificationGenomic DNA was extracted according to a protocol using MATAB buffer already described for the isolation of genomic DNA.6 DNA was resuspended with 1 ml of TE (10 mM Tris–HCl and 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0).DNA was purified with the Nucleobond® PC 20 kit (Macherey-Nagel, Cat. No. 740.571.100) with the modification that steps 1 and 2 were omitted and the DNA was purified directly after its isolation. A 1 ml mixture composed of 200 µl of crude DNA (20 µg DNA maximum), 450 µl water and 350 µl S3 buffer + RNAse (buffers provided with the kit) was passed through the column (step 3). This solution was homogenized on a rocking table for at least 1 h. After precipitation of the eluate with an equal volume of isopropyl alcohol, the pellet was resuspended in 70 µl of TE.The quality and quantity of DNA were first checked on 0.8% agarose gel, compared with a standard range, and then the Quant-iT™ PicoGreen® dsDNA Assay from Invitrogen™ was used. A quality test was performed for each sample by amplifying microsatellite markers in a PCR mixture with a high DNA concentration (100 ng DNA in a 10 µl reaction volume). The purification step was repeated when the amplification failed.2.3. In silico SNP discovery and verificationA collection of 149 650 ESTs (EMBL accession number CU469588 to CU633156), corresponding to 48 594 unigenes, was produced after sequencing 56 cDNA libraries constructed from material collected from different organs, genotypes, and under different environmental conditions.32SNPs were detected in silico and quality checked using the QualitySNP pipeline,33 as reported in Argout et al.32 and in ESTtik (http://esttik.cirad.fr).QualitySNP uses quality information related to each EST and a haplotype-based strategy to predict reliable SNPs. In order to detect SNPs in known homologous coding sequences, we selected contigs displaying a significant similarity with proteins from a non-redundant protein sequence database (NR), with entries from GenPept, Swissprot, PIR, PDF, PDB, and NCBI RefSeq, and as described in Argout et al.322.4. Validation of SNPs via golden gate assayA total of 30–50 ng of genomic DNA per plant was used for Illumina SNP genotyping with the Illumina BeadArray platform at the French National Genotyping Centre (CNG, CEA-IG, Evry, France), according to the GoldenGate Assay manufacturer's protocol. Three 3-day assays were carried out to genotype the progeny samples for the 1536 SNP set revealed by the GoldenGate assay (Supplementary Table S1). The protocol was similar to that briefly described by Hyten et al.34 except for the number of oligonucleotides involved in a single DNA reaction, thus comprising 4608 custom oligos assembled in the oligo pooled assays (OPA) designed by Illumina Inc. Raw hybridization, intensity data processing, clustering, and genotype calling were performed using the genotyping module in the BeadStudio/GenomeStudio package (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Illumina has developed a self-normalization algorithm that relies on information contained in each array, as described by Akhunov et al.35The clustering and genotype calling of each of the 1536 SNP markers were checked for their conformity and correct genotype distribution using known homozygous and heterozygous genotypes, included in the collection of diverse genotypes, as standards.2.5. SSR in silico discovery and genotypingThe MIcroSAtellite identification tool (MISA http://pgrc.ipk-gatersleben.de/misa) was used to perform SSR searches, and primers were designed with Primer3 software.36Primers flanking microsatellite loci were designed at each end of the scaffolds to orient and anchor them to the genetic map.SSRs identified in the scaffolds were mapped only on the reference map established from the UPA402 × UF676 cross.A total of 409 primer pairs (Supplementary Table S2) were defined in the 100 larger non-anchored scaffolds using Primer3 software36 and screened for their ability to segregate in the UPA402 × UF676 progeny.For a given SSR locus, the forward primer was designed with a 5'-end M13 tail (5'-CACGACGTTGTAAAACGAC-3'). PCR amplifications were performed in a Mastercycler ep384 thermocycler (Eppendorf, Germany) with 5 ng of purified DNA in a 10 µl final volume of buffer containing 10 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8), 50 mM KCl, 0.001% glycerol, 2.0 mM MgCl2, 0.08 µM of the M13-tailed forward primer, 0.1 µM of the reverse primer, 200 µM of dNTP, 1 U of Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, USA), 0.1 µM of M13 primer-fluorescent dye 6-FAM™, NED®, VIC®, or PET® (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA). The DNA and buffer were distributed in 384 plates using a Biomek NX automatic pipetting robot (Beckman Coulter, CA, USA). The touchdown PCR programme used was as follows: initial denaturation at 95°C for 5 min, followed by 10 cycles at 95°C for 45 s, Tm of 56–46°C (-1°C/cycle) for 1 min, and 72°C for 1 min 30 s. After these cycles, an additional round of 25 cycles were performed at 95°C for 45 s, Tm of 50°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 1 min, with a final elongation step at 72°C for 30 min.PCR products were diluted specifically for each dye and pooled for multiplex SSR genotyping (revealing two SSRs having different sizes of amplified product per dye). A mixture of 15 µl of Hi-Di™ formamide (Applied Biosystems) and 0.12 µl of size marker GeneScan™ 600-LIZ-Size® Standard V2.0. (Applied Biosystems) was added to 2 µl of the diluted PCR pool. This pool was then analysed using the ABI 3500xL automatic sequencer (Applied Biosystems).Images were analysed using Genemapper 4.0 software (Applied Biosystems) and exported as a data table.2.6. Genetic mappingThe UPA402 × UF676 population was the result of a cross between two heterozygous cocoa clones, UPA402 (<U+2640>) an Upper-Amazon Forastero and UF676 (<U+2642>) a Trinitario. In this case, there were three segregation possibilities: loci that were homozygous for one parent and heterozygous for the other, segregation (1:1), and those that segregated in both parents (1:2:1 or 1:1:1:1).Segregations were checked for goodness-of-fit to the expected Mendelian ratio using a chi-square test at significance levels of 0.05 and 0.01.Individual and consensus maps were constructed using Joinmap software, version 4.0.37Joinmap is able to combine data of several segregation types to construct a consensus genetic map. Here we used population type CP for the UPA402 × UF676 map, and population type F2 for the F2 population from Brazil. A lod score of 6 was used to identify 10 linkage groups (LGs) independently for each map. A consensus genetic map was established from the two distinct genetic maps. The corresponding groups were associated in pairs with JoinMap software. The Kosambi mapping function, with a lod score of 5 and a jump threshold of 3, was used to convert recombination frequencies into map distances.38This consensus map combined the new EST-SNPs and genomic SSRs defined from the scaffolds, in addition to the previously mapped markers.9 This map contained only markers with a known nucleotide sequence.3. Results3.1. Identification of SNPs and development of the golden gate assayThe assembly made from the 149 650 T. cacao EST sequences (see Materials and Methods) generated 12692 T. cacao contigs. The number of ESTs per contig ranged from 2 to 5102. To detect good quality in silico SNPs, we assumed that contigs with more than 100 members contained paralogous sequences.13,39 We therefore first selected 4818 contigs that contained at least 4 but no more than 100 EST members. A total of 5246 SNPs were identified in silico in 2012 contigs.We selected 4150 in silico SNPs detected in 1834 contigs that had a significant BlastX annotation similarity with known proteins of the NCBI non-redundant protein sequence database (NR) with entries from GenPept, Swissprot, PIR, PDF, PDB, and NCBI RefSeq, and as described in Argout et al.323.2. SNP performance and qualityThe set of 4150 in silico SNPs was selected in the EST contigs and the SNP-harbouring sequences were then submitted to Illumina for processing using the Illumina® Assay Design Tool (ADT). ADT generates scores for each SNP that can range from 0 to 1; SNPs with scores >0.6 have a high probability of being converted into a successful genotyping assay. In the set of 4150 submitted SNPs, 83.5% showed a high conversion success rate (>0.6), 9.2% showed a moderate conversion success rate (between 0.4 and 0.6), and 7.3% showed either a low conversion success rate or no score. A total of 1536 SNP sites having ADT scores >0.4 and without any other SNPs within the adjacent 60 bp was selected for the OPA design (Supplementary Table S1).3.3. Analysis of base changesOne thousand and forty-four in silico SNPs (68%) were transitions and 462 (32%) were transversions (Table 2). This ratio of transition/transversion SNPs tallies with the results observed in other plant species, where transition SNPs are always more frequent than transversion SNPs.

SNP polymorphismFrom the 1536 SNPs, 841 (55%) with a non-ambiguous polymorphic pattern across accessions were retained as true and verified SNPs and denominated TcSNP. Of the rest, 113 (7%) failed to be genotyped, 436 (28%) had a monomorphic pattern, and 146 (10%) were polymorphic but did not show any clear fluorescent pattern suitable for reliable genotype classification.Of the 841 polymorphic SNPs, 461 segregated in the mapping population (UPA402 × UF676) and could be mapped on the reference map. Five hundred and thirty-one were polymorphic and mapped on the F2 population map. Two hundred and thirty-nine SNP markers were segregating in both maps, thus enabling construction of a consensus map between them.3.5. SSR polymorphismA high-density genetic map is a key tool to order the scaffold assembly needed to generate a complete cocoa genome sequence. SSR markers were defined in the largest non-anchored scaffolds in order to improve anchoring of the T. cacao genome assembly provided by the International Cocoa Genome Sequencing consortium1 on the genetic map.From the 409 screened SSRs (Supplementary Table S2), 163 were polymorphic for the UPA402 × UF676 progeny and could be mapped.The new SSR markers defined from scaffolds were named mTcCIR450 to mTcCIR613 to extend the previously identified SSR marker series; mTcCIR 1 to mTcCIR 2918 from genomic DNA and mTcCIR 292 to mTcCIR 4479 from ESTs.3.6. Individual genetic linkage mapsA new set of 624 markers with their corresponding sequences, including 461 EST-SNP and 163 new SSR markers located on scaffolds of the genome assembly,1 were added to the reference map (Fig. 1, Supplementary Table S3).

Consensus genetic linkage mapTwo hundred and thirty-nine SNP markers were mapped in both populations.The complete consensus map (Table 5) contained 1262 codominant markers including 681 EST-SNPs, 523 SSRs (163 scaffold-tagged-SSRs, 110 EST-SSRs, 250 SSRs from genomic DNA) and 58 RFLPs including 14 resistance gene analogues (Rgenes-RFLPs), arranged in 10 LGs corresponding to the haploid chromosome number of T. cacao (Fig. 3, Supplementary Table S5). Among the 1262 markers, 65% were gene-based markers, including SNPs, SSRs and RFLPs.

The average distance between adjacent markers on this map was 0.6 cM, and thus shorter than the 1.3 cM of the map of Fouet et al.9The number of mapped loci varied substantially between LGs on the consensus map; from 63 in LG10 to 201 in LG1. The average distance between two markers in the different LGs ranged from 0.4 cM in LG1 to 0.9 cM in LG10.In total, 844 new markers (681 SNP markers and 163 SSR defined in scaffolds) were mapped. These new markers were well distributed over all chromosomes allowing to fill some gaps in the previous maps, for example on chromosome 10.4. DiscussionA large set of EST-SNP markers was generated and mapped in T. cacao. New SSR markers were added to these SNPs, providing an efficient tool for high-throughput genotyping of cocoa populations.SSR markers are multiallelic and well adapted for fine analysis of population diversity structure.40–43 In T. cacao, an average number of 5.8 alleles per SSR was observed by Loor Solorzano44 after genotyping a collection of genetic resources of various genetic origins, and with a maximum of 15 alleles revealed by one SSR (mTcCIR322). This is not the case for SNPs that are only biallelic, but a higher number of SNP markers (several thousands) can be easily revealed at once using high-throughput technologies.We used our new SNP and SSR markers to construct a very high-density genetic map. Sixty-five per cent of the markers were from within genes and the average distance between adjacent markers was 0.6 cM.Several chromosome regions include markers with skewed segregations, particularly on LG 1, LG 3, LG 4, and LG 6. The region on LG 4 includes the locus for self-incompatibility previously identified by Crouzillat et al.5 The gameto-sporophytic incompatibility system existing in T. cacao45,46 could possibly explain the segregation distortion on this LG 4 region. Other factors which could explain segregation distortion, such as chromosome rearrangements in banana47 which are responsible for highly skewed marker segregations, have not been reported in T. cacao.This high-density genetic map can be used as a major tool for efficient genome-wide association studies (GWASs) in T. cacao populations. This method, first applied in human and animal genetics,48–51 was also found to be highly effective for studying the determinism of useful traits in plants,52–56 particularly in cocoa with the analysis of some recent hybrid populations.8,57,58 GWAS is an alternative to QTL analyses in cross progenies for the purpose of studying genetic control of phenotypic traits in cocoa.GWASs can be carried out on unrelated genetic resources such as wild or cultivated populations or germplasm collections. Large cocoa germplasm collections are maintained in many countries and characterized for useful traits. Two international cocoa collections are hosted at the International Cocoa Genebank, Trinidad (ICG,T, preserving 2300 accessions),59 and at the Centro Agronomico Tropical de Investigacion y Ensenanza, Turrialba, Costa Rica (CATIE, preserving 1150 accessions).60 The markers identified here will now certainly facilitate such GWASs, providing added-value to this wide characterization work, thus boosting knowledge on the genetic determinants of useful cocoa traits.Another benefit of this large set of mapped markers is the possible integration of molecular information in conventional cocoa breeding schemes using marker-assisted selection (MAS).In cocoa, few MAS experiments are currently underway.3,61 The efficiency of MAS in selecting P. palmivora-resistant cocoa plants has been reported by Lanaud et al.3Until now, MAS studies have mainly been focused on traits controlled by a small number of genes, using only markers close to QTLs. However, such methods are of limited use for traits that are determined by a large number of genes of small effects.Substantial genome-wide molecular data can now be generated at lower cost by high-throughput technologies, such as SNP genotyping. This progress has paved the way for the development of new methods to predict genotype value via MAS. The genome-wide selection or genomic selection (GS) method was recently successfully applied in animal or plant breeding62–66 and allows to predict phenotypes using all marker information.The integration of molecular markers in cocoa recurrent breeding programmes67–72 could be facilitated by the GS approach in order to accelerate genetic gains. The GS strategy seems particularly suitable for the selection of multigenic traits such as yield and disease resistance. Cumulating a large number of resistance alleles is one of the main objectives of cocoa breeding for sustainable cocoa resistance. The large set of available SNP markers could facilitate the selection of resistant and high yielding cocoa trees via GS approaches enabling the use of all genome regions tagged by SNP markers, even those with very small effects.The search for candidate genes underlying trait variation is another major challenge for plant biologists, with the aim of gaining further insight into the mechanisms underlying trait variation, and producing tools to efficiently screen and exploit genetic resources.The consensus map produced in this work has been used efficiently for anchoring an assembly of T. cacao Criollo genome sequences, and for constituting pseudomolecules.1 Recently, two different cocoa varieties, i.e. Criollo1 and Forastero from the Lower Amazon region (http://www.cacaogenomedb.org/), were sequenced, with 28 798 and 35 000 annotated genes, respectively. These sequences will greatly facilitate the identification of candidate genes, allowing integration of both genetic and genomic (functional and structural) data. Overall, about 300 QTLs or marker/trait associations have already been identified in T. cacao. High-throughput genotyping associated with a high marker density will facilitate fine mapping of genes involved in trait variation (with GWAS or classical QTL analyses conducted on large progenies), thus allowing to refine the QTL position in the genome, while facilitating the search for candidate genes in corresponding genome sequences. Several functional studies have already been conducted in cocoa, focused mainly on genes generally expressed in specific physiological conditions or metabolisms.73 It will be now possible to focus more specifically on the expression of genes directly responsible for trait variation after candidate gene validation.Analysing genome evolution during domestication processes or adaptation to climate change can also help us to identify key genes underlying adaptive traits.74 Loss of diversity generally occurs during genome evolution, and some genes are selectively involved in natural selection or domestication. A large set of SNPs defined in expressed genes, such as those identified in this study, provides a key tool for identifying selection signatures or adaptive substitutions, and then highlighting candidate genes potentially involved in the adaptation60 or domestication processes and their corresponding molecular functions.75 All SNPs reported in this paper were identified in orthologous genes or gene families, thus facilitating comparative genomic approaches, and benefiting from gene knowledge accumulated in other species to accelerate cocoa breeding.5.

In Arabidopsis, cis-acting promoter elements involved in cold- and dehydration-responsive gene expression have been extensively analysed; however, the characteristics of such cis-acting promoter sequences in cold- and dehydration-inducible genes of rice and soybean remain to be clarified. In this study, we performed microarray analyses using the three species, and compared characteristics of identified cold- and dehydration-inducible genes. Transcription profiles of the cold- and dehydration-responsive genes were similar among these three species, showing representative upregulated (dehydrin/LEA) and downregulated (photosynthesis-related) genes. All (46 = 4096) hexamer sequences in the promoters of the three species were investigated, revealing the frequency of conserved sequences in cold- and dehydration-inducible promoters. A core sequence of the abscisic acid-responsive element (ABRE) was the most conserved in dehydration-inducible promoters of all three species, suggesting that transcriptional regulation for dehydration-inducible genes is similar among these three species, with the ABRE-dependent transcriptional pathway. In contrast, for cold-inducible promoters, the conserved hexamer sequences were diversified among these three species, suggesting the existence of diverse transcriptional regulatory pathways for cold-inducible genes among the species.1. IntroductionLow temperature and dehydration affect plant growth and productivity, and many genes respond to both stressors at the transcriptional level, and their gene products function in stress tolerance and response.1–4 These genes include key metabolic enzymes, late embryogenesis-abundant (LEA) proteins, detoxification enzymes, chaperones, protein kinases and transcription factors.1–4 The cis-acting elements that function in stress-responsive gene expression have been analysed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of gene expression in response to these stresses.5 The dehydration-responsive element (DRE), containing the core sequence A/GCCGAC, is a cis-acting element that regulates cold- and dehydration-responsive gene expression in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana).6 A similar motif was identified as the C-repeat and low temperature-responsive promoter element.7,8 The abscisic acid (ABA) -responsive element (ABRE), containing the core sequence ACGTGG/T, is a cis-acting element that regulates dehydration- and high salinity-responsive gene expression in Arabidopsis and rice (Oryza sativa).5,9 ABA-responsive gene expression requires multiple ABREs or an ABRE with a coupling element as a functional promoter.10–15Arabidopsis cDNAs encoding the ethylene-responsive element-binding factor/APETALA2-type DRE-binding (DREB) proteins (CBF1, DREB1A, and DREB2A) have been isolated by one-hybrid screening in yeast,16,17 and they specifically bind to the DRE/C-repeat sequence to activate gene transcription in Arabidopsis. Arabidopsis has three DREB1/CBF proteins encoded by genes that lie in tandem on chromosome 4 in the order DREB1B/CBF1, DREB1A/CBF3, and DREB1C/CBF2.17,18 Arabidopsis also has DREB2A and DREB2B proteins.17 Although expression of all three DREB1/CBF genes is induced by cold but not by dehydration, both DREB2 genes are induced by dehydration and high salinity.17 Both DREB1/CBF and DREB2 proteins bind to DRE, but DREB1/CBFs function in cold-responsive gene expression, and DREB2s function in dehydration-responsive gene expression.CaMV 35S promoter-driven overexpression of DREB1/CBFs increases stress tolerance to freezing, dehydration, and high salinity in transgenic Arabidopsis.17,19,20 More than 100 downstream targets of DREB1A/CBF3 have been identified by microarray analysis.21–25 Overexpression of the constitutively active form of DREB2A (35S:DREB2A-CA) significantly increases dehydration tolerance but only slightly increases freezing tolerance.26 Microarray analyses of 35S:DREB2A-CA plants revealed that DREB2A regulates expression of many dehydration-responsive genes; however, some genes regulated by DREB1A are not regulated by DREB2A.26Promoter analysis of DREB1A- and DREB2A-regulated genes and gel mobility shift assays revealed that DREB1A has the highest affinity for A/GCCGACNT, and DREB2A preferentially binds ACCGAC,23,26 thus controlling the induction of different downstream genes. DREB2A expression also is regulated by heat-shock stress, and thermo-tolerance is significantly increased in 35S:DREB2A-CA plants.27 Heat shock-inducible proteins and transcription factors are upregulated in 35S:DREB2A-CA plants but not in 35S:DREB1A plants. DREB2A-regulated genes are involved in dehydration, high salinity, and heat-shock stress tolerance but not freezing stress.27 DREB1A and DREB2A downstream gene products mostly have similar functions, but they encode different enzymes for carbohydrate metabolism.25ABRE-binding (AREB) proteins or ABRE-binding factors (ABFs) have been isolated using ABRE sequences as baits in one-hybrid screens in yeast.28,29 AREB/ABFs encode basic-domain leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors, and they comprise a family with nine members in Arabidopsis.28–35 Among the nine members, AREB1/ABF2, AREB2/ABF4, and ABF3 are induced by dehydration and high salinity in vegetative tissues,36 and their gain-of-function mutants show enhanced dehydration stress tolerance.36–38 The areb1 areb2 abf3 triple mutant displays enhanced ABA insensitivity and reduced dehydration stress tolerance compared with control plants, and these effects are accompanied by disruption of dehydration-responsive gene expression.39In this study, the promoter sequences in cold- and dehydration-inducible genes of Arabidopsis, rice, and soybean (Glycine max) were analysed. Previously, we reported cold- and dehydration-responsive genes in Arabidopsis.25 In the current study, we used oligo microarrays to identify cold- and dehydration-responsive genes in rice and soybean. The observed frequencies of all (46 = 4096) hexamer sequences in cold- and dehydration-inducible promoters were compared with standardized promoters to estimate conserved sequences and to determine representative cold- and dehydration-responsive transcriptional pathways in Arabidopsis, rice, and soybean.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materials and growth conditionsWild-type rice plants (Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare) were grown in plastic pots filled with nutrient soil for 2 weeks under flooded lowland conditions with a 12-h light (28°C)/12-h dark (25°C) regimen (50 ± 10 µmol photons/m2/s). The plants were then: (i) transferred from 28 to 10°C and grown for 1 day for the cold treatment; or (ii) grown for 3 days at 28°C without watering to a 15.6% (SD 1.1) (w/w) soil moisture content for the dehydration treatment. Wild-type soybean plants (Glycine max (L.) Merr. cv. Nourin No. 2) were grown in plastic pots filled with nutrient soil for 3 weeks under a 12-h light/12-h dark regimen (50 ± 10 µmol photons/m2/s) at 28°C. The plants were then: (i) transferred from 28 to 4°C and grown for 1 day for the cold treatment; or (ii) grown for 4 days at 28°C without watering to <10% (w/w) soil moisture content for the dehydration treatment.2.2. Microarray analysesA rice oligo microarray (RAP-DB) was used for transcriptome analysis (Agilent Technologies). We constructed a new oligonucleotide microarray for soybean transcriptome analysis capable of detecting 43 640 protein-coding genes using eArray software with soybean protein-coding genes.40 Oligo microarray construction was performed by Agilent Technologies Inc. The RNAs are labelled with a Low RNA Input Linear Amplification/Labeling Kit™ (Agilent Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Aliquots of Cy5-labelled cRNA of the samples and Cy3-labelled cRNA of the control samples are used for hybridization in the microarray. Biological and technical (dye swap) replicate sample sets are analysed. After hybridization, microarray slides are scanned (scanner model G2505C with scan control software, version A.8.5.1; Agilent Technologies) and the data are analysed using Feature Extraction software, version 10.10.1.1 (Agilent Technologies). All microarray data analyses were performed according to the Agilent methodology. Raw data were analysed by GeneSpring GX software, version 11.5.1 (Agilent Technologies) and normalized using the Lowess normalization method. Expression log ratios and Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate P-values of the cross-gene error model were also calculated by GeneSpring GX. Microarray design and data were deposited at MIAMExpress (accession numbers E-MEXP-2294, E-MEXP-2295, E-MEXP-2725, E-MEXP-2726, and E-MEXP-3164).2.3. Measurement of ABA levelsThe ABA level in 100 mg of each plant was quantified as described41 using a liquid chromatography-mass chromatography system (UPLC/Quattro Premier XE; Waters) with an ODS column (AQUITY-UPLC BEH-C 18, 1.7 µm, 2.1 × 100 mm; Waters). Reproducibility was assessed using three biological replicates in each experiment.3. Results3.1. Identification of cold- and dehydration-responsive genes in rice and soybeanMicroarray analyses were used to identify cold- and dehydration-responsive genes in rice and soybean. The 389-Mb rice genome and the 1115-Mb soybean genome have been sequenced, and 37 544 and 46 430 protein-coding genes, respectively, have been predicted.40,42 A rice oligo microarray (RAP-DB) including 29 690 rice genes was used for transcriptome analysis (Agilent Technologies). In rice plants exposed to cold or dehydration, 4022 (cold) and 4632 (dehydration) genes were significantly upregulated [Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR): P < 0.05; fold change (FC): >2], and 4704 (cold) and 5189 (dehydration) genes were significantly down-regulated (FDR: P < 0.05; FC: <0.5) (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). Because a soybean oligo microarray was not available, we constructed a new oligo microarray for transcriptome analysis capable of detecting 43 640 protein-coding genes using eArray software with soybean protein-coding genes.40 In soybean plants exposed to cold or dehydration, 5993 (cold) and 4433 (dehydration) genes were significantly upregulated (FDR: P < 0.05; FC: >2), and 6350 (cold) and 5098 (dehydration) genes were significantly downregulated (FDR: P < 0.05; FC: < 0.5) (Supplementary Tables S3 and S4).3.2. Molecular function of cold- and dehydration-responsive genes in Arabidopsis, rice, and soybeanWe annotated cold- and dehydration-responsive genes in rice and soybean with Gene Ontology (GO) data, and we re-annotated these genes in Arabidopsis. First, all amino acid sequence data were downloaded from TAIR10,43 RAP-DB,44 and Phytozome (http://www.phytozome.net/), and motifs were searched using the HMMER program.45 Pfam entries were then converted to GO terms according to the methods of Hunter et al.46 Secondly, data for Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers were downloaded from KEGG,47 AraCyc,48 Plantcyc,49 and Kappa-view50 and then converted to GO terms.51 Thirdly, we downloaded data for GO terms from TAIR10, RAP-DB, Phytozome, AgriGO,52 GRAMENE,53 and AmiGO.54 Based on the GO data, 3717 molecular functions were categorized into 27 classes according to the KEGG PATHWAY. Among the genes detected by the oligo microarrays, 10 005 (Arabidopsis), 11 271 (rice), and 17 416 (soybean) genes were annotated in the databases (Supplementary Tables S5–S9), and our Arabidopsis transcription profile was similar to that of rice and soybean. For each species, dehydrin/LEA- and photosynthesis-related genes were representative of up- and downregulated classes, respectively, whereas helicase genes were representative of a cold-induced upregulated class (Fig. 1).

Base composition in Arabidopsis, rice, and soybean promotersTo identify conserved sequences in cold- and dehydration-inducible promoters, we collected sequence data for 10 000 promoters of Arabidopsis, rice, and soybean genes. As we previously reported 10 000 promoter sequences of Arabidopsis genes,23 we used these data and also collected promoter sequences of rice and soybean genes. Sequences of 10 000 independent promoters from -1 to -1000 were randomly selected from genomic sequences of rice and soybean genes that have data for the full-length cDNA sequences to obtain the mean value of base compositions. We estimated positions of transcriptional start sites using sequences of more than 10 000 independent full-length cDNA clones for each species, which were previously compiled into databases.55,56To understand aspects of the promoter sequences of each species, we estimated base composition of the promoter sequences. Previously, we analysed base composition in Arabidopsis promoters.23 In this study, we analysed base composition in rice and soybean promoters, and we re-analysed that in Arabidopsis promoters. To estimate the sample mean of base composition in 10 000 promoters of three species, single random sampling (n = 100) was conducted for 1000 replicates, based on the central limit theorem. Base compositions of rice and soybean promoters were compared with Arabidopsis promoters. Promoter base compositions were AT-rich in Arabidopsis (A:C:G:T = 33.7:17.0:16.5:32.8), rice (A:C:G:T = 29.2:22.0:20.4:28.3), and soybean (A:C:G:T = 37.2:14.1:13.2:35.5) (Fig. 2A–C). In addition, the Smirnov–Grubbs test (P < 0.05) was used to detect outliers in promoter regions. In each species, high-frequency AT regions were found ~30 bases upstream of the transcriptional start sites, with high-frequency C regions from -1 and -100, except in AT-enriched regions (Fig. 2D–F; Supplementary Tables S10–S12).

Frequency of promoter hexamer sequences in Arabidopsis, rice, and soybeanSeveral core sequences of cis-acting elements are hexamer sequences,6,7,9,57 including the core sequences of DRE (A/GCCGAC), ABRE (ACGTGG/T), and G box (CACGTG). To estimate biases in the frequency of promoter hexamer sequences, the number of all (46 = 4096) hexamer sequences was determined for 10 000 independent promoters (-1 to -1,000) of Arabidopsis, rice, and soybean. Single random sampling (n = 100) of 1000 replicates was used to determine standardized promoters. We calculated sample means of frequencies of each hexamer sequence in the standardized promoters, and considered those sample means as observed frequencies in the standardized promoters (Supplementary Tables S13–S15). The most-frequent and second most-frequent hexamers were AAAAAA and TTTTTT, respectively, in standardized promoters of each species. The 10 most-frequent hexamers in standardized promoters of Arabidopsis were similar to those in standardized promoters of rice and soybean, with only W (Weak 2H bonds) residues (Supplementary Tables S13–S15). The 10 least-frequent hexamers in standardized promoters of Arabidopsis and soybean were not similar to those in standardized promoters of rice, and they had only S (Strong 3H bond) residues. The promoter hexamer sequences with the lowest frequency were GGGCGC (Arabidopsis), CGCCCG (soybean), and GCGTTA plus other sequences with W residues (rice) (Supplementary Tables S13–S15).To estimate over-represented hexamer sequences, first, expected frequencies were calculated using the base compositions of promoter sequences in each species (Supplementary Tables S16–S18). Then, the observed and expected frequencies of all hexamer sequences were compared (Z-test: P < 0.05). In Arabidopsis, GGCCCA had the highest (5.5) and TGGGCC had the second highest (5.4) fold-change between observed and expected frequencies (Supplementary Table S19). These were representative over-represented promoter hexamer sequences named site IIa, which act as cis-acting elements for basic helix-loop-helix or TCP-family transcription factors.58,59 Additionally, several repeat sequences (TCTCTC, CTCTCT, AAAAAA, TTTTTT, GAGAGA, and AGAGAG) were over-represented in Arabidopsis promoters (Supplementary Table S19). Rice and soybean promoters were similar to those of Arabidopsis, but they also had hexamer sequences with S residues (GGGGGG, CCCCCC, GGGCCC, GCGGCG, GGCGGC, and CGCCGC) (Supplementary Tables S20 and S21).3.5. Distribution of promoter hexamer sequences in Arabidopsis, rice, and soybeanTo estimate distribution biases of promoter hexamer sequences, all hexamer sequences were localized in 10 000 independent promoters (from -1 to -1000) in Arabidopsis, rice, and soybean. The number of hexamer sequences was calculated and standardized for every 50 bases within promoters, and two major peaks (from -1 to -50 and from -51 to -100) were found. Distribution patterns of representative hexamer sequences are illustrated by heat maps (Fig. 3A–I). Heat maps of representative sequences in promoters of Arabidopsis, rice, and soybean genes. The number of hexamer sequences was calculated and standardized for every 50 promoter bases to show high (red) and low (blue) frequencies (Z-scores) in Arabidopsis, rice, and soybean. All (26 = 64) W (A–C) or Y (D–F) residue sequences in promoters are shown. Arrows in (A)–(F) indicate the 10 most-frequent hexamers identified (TTCTTC, TCTTCT, CTTCTT, TCTCTT, TTCTCT, TATAAA, ATATAA, TTTCTT, TATATA, TCTCTC). Several cis-acting element sequences like DRE (ACCGAC), ABRE (ACGTGG, ACGTGT, ACGTGG, CCACGT, CGTGGC, GCCACG), G box (CACGTG), CE3 (AACGCG, CACGCG), RE1 (GCCCAT), and site IIa (AGCCCA, GGCCCA, TGGGCC) were over-represented between -51 and -100 and are also marked by arrows (G–I).Heat maps of representative sequences in promoters of Arabidopsis, rice, and soybean genes.

All (26 = 64) W (A–C) or Y (D–F) residue sequences in promoters are shown. Arrows in (A)–(F) indicate the 10 most-frequent hexamers identified (TTCTTC, TCTTCT, CTTCTT, TCTCTT, TTCTCT, TATAAA, ATATAA, TTTCTT, TATATA, TCTCTC). Several cis-acting element sequences like DRE (ACCGAC), ABRE (ACGTGG, ACGTGT, ACGTGG, CCACGT, CGTGGC, GCCACG), G box (CACGTG), CE3 (AACGCG, CACGCG), RE1 (GCCCAT), and site IIa (AGCCCA, GGCCCA, TGGGCC) were over-represented between -51 and -100 and are also marked by arrows (G–I).The over-represented hexamer sequences (from -1 to -50) in Arabidopsis were similar to those in rice and soybean (Supplementary Tables S22–S24). The 10 most-frequent hexamers (Fig. 3A and B; TCTTCT, TATATA, TTCTTC, TCTCTC, CTCTCT, CTTCTT, TATAAA, TCTCTT, TTCTCT, and TTTCTT) in Arabidopsis were classified into two groups, one consisting of W residues (WR) and the other consisting of pyrimidine residues (YR). The frequencies of all possible (26 = 64) WR (Fig. 3A–C) and YR (Fig. 3D–F) hexamers in each species were determined and are presented as heat maps. Among the 64 WR in each species between -1 and -50, TATAAA and TATATA were over-represented while the others were under-represented in all species. The peak position of the TATATA sequence in promoters was at -33 (Arabidopsis), -32 (rice), and -31 (soybean) (Supplementary Fig. S1). Most YRs in each species were over-represented between -1 and -50, with peak positions near TATAAA and TATATA sequences. Similar YR hexamers have been reported to be over-represented as plant-specific sequences in Arabidopsis and rice promoters.60 In each species, the over-represented hexamer sequences between -51 and -100 included several cis-acting elements (Fig. 3G–I; Supplementary Tables S25–S27), such as DRE (ACCGAC), ABRE (ACGTGG, ACGTGT, ACGTGG, CCACGT, CGTGGC, and GCCACG), G box (CACGTG), CE3 (AACGCG and CACGCG), RE1 (GCCCAT), and site IIa (AGCCCA, GGCCCA, and TGGGCC). In contrast, these sequences were under-represented between -501 and -1000. We also found several novel over-represented sequences in promoters from -51 to -100 (Fig. 3G–I; Supplementary Tables S25–S27), which were not present in the plant cis-acting regulatory DNA elements (PLACE) database.613.6. Conserved promoter sequences of downstream genes of DREB1A, DREB2A, and AREB familyWe previously reported downstream genes of the transcription factors DREB1A and DREB2A using an oligo microarray.23 In 35S:DREB1A and 35S:DREB2A-CA plants, 259 and 373 genes were significantly upregulated, respectively (FDR: P < 0.05; FC: >2). In our present study, we selected the 100 most highly upregulated downstream genes with promoter information and counted all promoter hexamer sequences. To determine conserved promoter sequences, the observed frequencies of all promoter hexamer sequences of downstream genes of DREB1A or DREB2A were compared with standardized promoters (Z-test: P < 0.05). The Z-scores of all hexamer sequences are illustrated by scatter plots (Fig. 4A; Supplementary Table S28). In promoters of downstream genes of DREB1A, the ACCGAC sequence had the highest Z-score (a core sequence of DRE was the most conserved), with 3.8-fold more ACCGAC sequences than in standardized promoters. DRE also had the sequence with the second highest Z-score (TGTCGG), and other parts of DRE sequences (GTCGGC and GCCGAC) were found in promoters of downstream genes of DREB1A. The third highest Z-score (ACGTGG) was part of ABRE, with 2.4-fold more ACGTGG sequences than in standardized promoters (Fig. 4A; Supplementary Table S28). These results confirmed our previous findings showing that DRE and ABRE are conserved in promoters of downstream genes of DREB1A.23 In addition, we found that a portion of Evening element (EE: ATATCT) was also highly conserved in promoters of downstream genes of DREB1A ((Fig. 4A; Supplementary Table S28). In promoters of downstream genes of DREB2A, DRE had the most conserved sequence (ACCGAC), with 3.9-fold more ACCGAC sequences than in standardized promoters. The second (CCGACT) and third (GTCGGT) highest Z-scores were also part of DRE (Fig. 4B; Supplementary Table S29). These results also confirmed our earlier finding that DRE is highly conserved in promoters of downstream genes of DREB2A.26Scatter plots showing Z-scores (y axes) for the observed frequencies of all hexamer sequences (x axes) in promoters of downstream genes of DREB1A (A), DREB2A (B), and the AREB family (C) compared with standardized promoters. The highly conserved sequences DRE (blue), ABRE (red), EE (green), and G box (purple) are shown.Scatter plots showing Z-scores (y axes) for the observed frequencies of all hexamer sequences (x axes) in promoters of downstream genes of DREB1A (A), DREB2A (B), and the AREB family (C) compared with standardized promoters. The highly conserved sequences DRE (blue), ABRE (red), EE (green), and G box (purple) are shown.AREB1, AREB2, and ABF3 are members of the AREB family, which is a subgroup of the bZIP-type transcription factors, and they are key transcription factors under conditions of dehydration. Many downstream genes of the AREB family are expressed under dehydration stress in the areb1 areb2 abf3 triple mutant.39 In promoters of downstream genes of the AREB family, the most conserved sequence (CGTGTC in the ABRE motif) was 5.4-fold more abundant than in standardized promoters. ABRE also had the sequence with the second highest Z-score (ACACGT), and other parts of ABRE and G box were highly conserved in promoters of downstream genes of the AREB family (Fig. 4C; Supplementary Table S30). Hence, our comprehensive promoter analyses could detect conserved sequences in a select promoter set.3.7. Conserved sequences in cold- and dehydration-inducible promoters of Arabidopsis, rice, and soybeanIn cold-inducible promoters of Arabidopsis, the most conserved sequence (ACCGAC in DRE) was 3.6-fold more abundant than in standardized promoters (Fig. 5A; Supplementary Table S31). The second most conserved sequence (AATATC) was part of EE (Fig. 5A; Supplementary Table S31). Several hexamers in DRE (CCGACA and GTCGGT), EE (ATATCT and GATATT), and ABRE (ACGTGG) sequences also were highly conserved in cold-inducible promoters of Arabidopsis (Fig. 5A; Supplementary Table S31). In dehydration-inducible promoters of Arabidopsis, the most conserved sequence (ACACGT), second most conserved sequence (ACGTGT), and other highly conserved sequences were part of ABRE and G box (CACGTG) (Fig. 5B; Supplementary Table S32). Scatter plots showing Z-scores (y axes) for the observed frequencies of all hexamer sequences (x axes) in cold-inducible (A, C, E) and dehydration-inducible (B, D, F) promoters in Arabidopsis (A, B), rice (C, D), and soybean (E, F) compared with standardized promoters. The highly conserved sequences of DRE (blue), ABRE (red), EE (green), G box (purple), T/G box (light blue), CE3 (light green), and novel sequences (black) are shown.Scatter plots showing Z-scores (y axes) for the observed frequencies of all hexamer sequences (x axes) in cold-inducible (A, C, E) and dehydration-inducible (B, D, F) promoters in Arabidopsis (A, B), rice (C, D), and soybean (E, F) compared with standardized promoters. The highly conserved sequences of DRE (blue), ABRE (red), EE (green), G box (purple), T/G box (light blue), CE3 (light green), and novel sequences (black) are shown.In cold-inducible promoters of rice, the most (CGTACG) and second most (GTAGTA) conserved sequences were 2.8- and 2.1-fold, respectively, more abundant than in standardized promoters (Fig. 5C; Supplementary Table S33). These sequences were not registered with PLACE.61 Other highly conserved sequences in cold-inducible rice promoters were part of ABRE (ACGTAC and GTACGT) (Fig. 5C; Supplementary Table S33). The dehydration-inducible rice promoters had the most (ACACGT in ABRE) and second most (CACGCG in CE3) conserved sequences, as well as other highly conserved ABRE (CGCCAC), CE3 (ACGCGT and CGCGTC), and novel (CCGATC, CGATCG, and GCACGC) sequences (Fig. 5D; Supplementary Table S34).The cold-inducible soybean promoters had the most (ACACGT in ABRE; 2.6-fold more abundant than in standardized promoters) and second most (ACGCGT in CE3) conserved sequences, as well as other highly conserved sequences (ACGTGG in ABRE; CGCGTT in CE3; ATGTCG in DRE; and CACGTT, CCGTGT and AACACG sequences) (Fig. 5E; Supplementary Table S35). CACGTT is part of pABRE3, T/G box, QAR, WAR, and OsBP-5 binding site, all of which have been identified as cis-acting elements that regulate gene expression in response to ABA62 or jasmonates.63–65 The dehydration-inducible soybean promoters had the most (ACGTGG in ABRE; 3.5-fold more abundant than in standardized promoters) and second most (CACGTG in G box) conserved sequences, and there were other highly conserved parts of ABRE (Fig. 5F; Supplementary Table S36).3.8. Six most-frequent core motifs known as cis-acting elements in cold- and dehydration-inducible promoters in Arabidopsis, rice, and soybeanWe found that several cis-acting elements were conserved in promoters of cold- and dehydration-inducible genes using our comprehensive promoter analysis. Then, we focused on the six most-frequent cis-acting elements (DRE, ABRE, EE, G box, CE3, and T/G box) in cold- or dehydration-inducible promoters and illustrated the Z-score of each cis-acting element using heat maps.In cold-inducible Arabidopsis promoters, DRE and EE were highly conserved motifs, and ABRE, G box, and T/G box also were conserved; in contrast, in dehydration-inducible Arabidopsis promoters, ABRE and G box were highly conserved motifs, and DRE, EE, CE3, and T/G box also were conserved. The DRE and EE motifs occurred more frequently in cold-inducible promoters, whereas the ABRE and G box motifs occurred more frequently in the dehydration-inducible promoters (Fig. 6). In cold-inducible soybean promoters, ABRE and T/G box were highly conserved, and DRE, G box, and CE3 also were conserved. The observed frequencies of six representative motifs in dehydration-inducible soybean promoters were similar to those in dehydration-inducible Arabidopsis promoters. In dehydration-inducible soybean promoters, ABRE and G box were highly conserved, and DRE and T/G box also were conserved. ABRE and G box occurred more frequently in dehydration-inducible soybean promoters (Fig. 6). In our promoter analyses, there were no extremely highly conserved motifs in rice promoters similar to DRE or ABRE in cold- or dehydration-inducible Arabidopsis promoters. In cold-inducible rice promoters, ABRE, EE, and CE3 were conserved. In dehydration-inducible rice promoters, CE3 was a highly conserved motif, and DRE, ABRE, and G box were conserved. EE motifs were more frequent in cold-inducible rice promoters, and ABRE, G box, and CE3 motifs occurred more frequent in dehydration-inducible rice promoters (Fig. 6).

Each small square indicates the conserved level of the cis-acting elements. Solid gray and white squares show conserved and non-conserved cis-acting elements, respectively (Z-test: P < 0.05).The observed frequencies of the six cis-acting elements in promoters of downstream genes of DREB1A were similar to those of cold-inducible promoters of Arabidopsis. In promoters of downstream genes of DREB1A, DRE and EE were highly conserved motifs, and ABRE and G box also were conserved. In contrast, the observed frequencies of the six cis-acting motifs in promoters of downstream genes of DREB2A were not similar to those of cold- or dehydration-inducible promoters of Arabidopsis. Only DRE was highly conserved in promoters of downstream genes of DREB2A. In promoters of downstream genes of the AREB family, ABRE and G box were highly conserved motifs, and DRE and CE3 were conserved (Fig. 6). The frequencies of the six cis-acting elements in promoters of downstream genes of the AREB family were similar to those of dehydration-inducible promoters of Arabidopsis.3.9. Quantification of ABA in Arabidopsis, rice, and soybean exposed to cold or dehydrationWe found that ABRE was highly conserved in cold- and dehydration-inducible promoters of Arabidopsis, rice, and soybean. To clarify relationship between these ABRE sequences and ABA effects on the dehydration- and cold-inducible genes, we measured ABA levels in Arabidopsis, rice, and soybean plants exposed to cold or dehydration. ABA levels in cold-treated Arabidopsis and rice plants were 1.8- and 3.8-fold higher, respectively, than in untreated controls. In contrast, the level of ABA in soybean plants decreased under cold conditions and was 3.7-fold lower than in untreated controls. Under dehydration conditions, ABA levels increased 21.2-, 34.6-, and 5.1-fold in Arabidopsis, rice, and soybean, respectively, when compared with untreated controls (Supplementary Fig. S2).4. DiscussionIn this study, transcriptome and comprehensive promoter sequence analyses demonstrated general characteristics of promoter sequences in cold- or dehydration-inducible genes of Arabidopsis, rice, and soybean. Rice and soybean transcription profiles were similar to those of Arabidopsis, showing representative upregulated (dehydrin and LEA genes) and downregulated (photosynthesis-related genes) classes after exposure to cold or dehydration. In contrast, the profiles for cold- or dehydration-inducible promoter sequences displayed various characteristics in each species.In our promoter analyses, DRE was a highly conserved motif in cold-inducible Arabidopsis promoters and in promoters of downstream genes of DREB1A. Indeed, 56% of cold-inducible promoters of Arabidopsis contain single or multiple DRE core sequences (25.6% standardized promoters of Arabidopsis contain single or multiple DRE core sequences). In addition, the observed frequencies of the six most-frequent cis-acting elements in cold-inducible Arabidopsis promoters were similar to those in promoters of downstream genes of DREB1A (Figs 4A, 5A, and 6). CaMV 35S promoter-driven overexpression of DREB1A increases freezing stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis.17,19,20 Microarray analyses identified >100 downstream targets of DREB1A/CBF3, and gel mobility shift assays revealed that DREB1A has the highest affinity for the DRE core sequence.21–25 These results suggest that the DRE/DREB1A-dependent transcriptional regulatory pathway plays an important role in cold-inducible gene expression in Arabidopsis.In dehydration-inducible promoters of Arabidopsis and in promoters of downstream genes of DREB2A, DRE also was conserved, revealing that 41% of dehydration-inducible promoters of Arabidopsis contain single or multiple DRE core sequences. In Arabidopsis, overexpression of the constitutively active form of DREB2A (35S:DREB2A-CA) significantly increases dehydration tolerance, and microarray analyses revealed that DREB2A regulates the expression of many dehydration-responsive genes26,27 by preferentially binding ACCGAC.27 However, the observed frequencies of six representative cis-acting elements in dehydration-inducible promoters of Arabidopsis were not similar to those in promoters of downstream genes of DREB2A. These results suggest that DRE/DREB2A-dependent transcriptional regulation has a particular role in the expression of dehydration-inducible genes in Arabidopsis. DRE also was a conserved motif in dehydration-inducible soybean and rice promoters; 22% (soybean) and 49% (rice) of dehydration-inducible promoters contain single or multiple DRE core sequences compared with 12.7 (soybean) and 40.3% (rice) for standardized promoters. Orthologous DREB2A genes in soybean (Glyma06g03110, Glyma17g37350, Glyma14g06080) and rice (Os01g0165000, Os05g0346200) were significantly upregulated in plants exposed to dehydration (Supplementary Tables S2 and S4). These results suggest that DRE-dependent gene expression also occurs in both soybean and rice in response to dehydration.ABRE was a highly conserved motif in dehydration-inducible promoters of Arabidopsis, soybean, and rice (Figs 5B, D, F and 6) and in promoters of downstream genes of the AREB family (Figs 4C and 6). Notably, 82 (Arabidopsis), 70 (soybean), and 71% (rice) of dehydration-inducible promoters contain single or multiple ABRE core sequences compared with 44.8 (Arabidopsis), 39.5 (soybean), and 53.5% (rice) for standardized promoters. The ABRE motif is a cis-acting element for the AREB family transcription factors, including Arabidopsis AREB/ABFs and ABI5 and rice TRAB1 proteins, which can bind to ABRE and activate dehydration-inducible gene expression.28–35,66 The areb1 areb2 abf3 triple mutant has impaired dehydration-inducible gene expression and reduced dehydration stress tolerance.39 The AREB/ABF genes were reported to be induced by dehydration in Arabidopsis plants,36 and our microarray analyses revealed that AREB/ABF orthologs in soybean (Glyma19g37910, Glyma03g00580, Glyma04g04170, Glyma13g03880, Glyma10g08370) and rice (Os02g0766700: OsAREB1, Os01g0859300: OsAREB3, Os06g0211200: OsAREB8, Os08g0472000: TRAB1) were significantly upregulated in response to dehydration (Supplementary Tables S2 and S4). Hence, ABRE/AREB family-dependent gene expression likely plays a major role in dehydration-inducible gene expression in Arabidopsis, soybean, and rice.In our study, ABRE was also conserved in cold-inducible promoters of Arabidopsis, rice, and soybean (Figs 5A, C, E), and 62 (Arabidopsis), 63 (soybean), and 67% (rice) of cold-inducible promoters contain single or multiple ABRE core sequences. Expression levels of several AREB/ABFs and their orthologous genes, including Arabidopsis At1g49720: ABF1 and At4g34000: ABI3 and rice Os02g0766700: OsAREB1 and Os07g0686100: OsAREB7, were slightly increased in response to cold (Supplementary Tables S1 and S3). The ABRE functions as a cis-acting element that regulates ABA-responsive gene expression.5,9 We showed that ABA levels increased significantly in all three species in response to dehydration, but they decreased (soybean) or slightly increased (Arabidopsis and rice) in response to cold (Supplementary Fig. S2). These results suggest that cold-inducible ABRE-dependent gene expression occurs in Arabidopsis, rice, and soybean, but most of this expression is independent of ABA in the three species, especially soybean.EE was a highly conserved motif in cold-inducible Arabidopsis promoters and had a higher observed frequency in cold-inducible than in dehydration-inducible promoters in all three species (Fig. 6). In Arabidopsis, EE has a cis-acting element for CCA1 and LHY transcription factors, which are related to circadian clock-regulated genes that control cold-inducible gene expression.67–70 Orthologous rice genes for CCA1 and LHY have similar expression patterns as in Arabidopsis.71 Hence, EE-dependent transcription likely regulates cold-inducible gene expression more than dehydration-inducible gene expression in Arabidopsis, rice, and soybean. We identified novel highly conserved CGTACG and GTAGTA sequences in cold-inducible rice promoters that were not highly conserved in cold- or dehydration-inducible promoters in Arabidopsis or soybean (Fig. 5). These sequences have never been reported as cis-acting elements for cold- or dehydration-inducible gene expression, and thus they are novel candidates for cis-acting elements involved in cold-inducible gene expression in rice.Several cold- or dehydration-inducible promoters contained one or more cis-acting elements. DRE and ABRE have an interdependent relationship in the rd29 promoter.14 We analysed the colocalization of six kinds of cis-acting elements in cold- or dehydration-inducible promoters of Arabidopsis, rice, and soybean (Fig. 6). In cold-inducible promoters of Arabidopsis, the most and the second most colocalized motifs were DRE + EE and DRE + ABRE, respectively. In addition, promoters of downstream genes of DREB1A had similar colocalized motifs to cold-inducible promoters of Arabidopsis (Figs 4A and 6). Several downstream genes of DREB1A also are induced by dehydration or regulating by the circadian clock.23 In cold-inducible gene expression in Arabidopsis, parts of the DRE-dependent transcriptional regulatory pathway overlapped with the ABRE-dependent and EE-dependent pathways. Multiple ABRE motifs are necessary for the expression of ABA-inducible genes in seeds and vegetative tissues. Either an additional copy of ABRE or coupling elements is necessary for ABA-inducible gene expression.10–15 Most of the known coupling elements are similar to ABREs and contain an ACGT motif. The representative coupling element, CE3, was identified using the promoters of barley or rice ABA-inducible genes.12,13 In our analyses of dehydration-inducible promoters in Arabidopsis and soybean, the ABRE motif was highly co-localized with its likely coupling elements ABRE, DRE, G box, or EE (Fig. 6). In dehydration-inducible promoters in rice, the ABRE motif was highly co-localized with CE3 (Fig. 6), suggesting that the ABRE coupling elements in monocots differ from those in dicots.Based on our comprehensive promoter sequence analyses, we can estimate the evolution of dehydration- or cold-responsive transcriptional pathways. The dehydration-inducible promoter sequence profiles displayed similar characteristics in Arabidopsis, rice, and soybean. ABRE is the most conserved sequence in dehydration-inducible promoters of all three species (Figs 5B, D, F and 6). In response to dehydration, ABA levels increased in all three species (Supplementary Fig. S2). It has been reported that most dehydration-inducible genes are also induced by ABA,3,72 and ABA is thought to be involved in dehydration-inducible gene expression in all land plants.3,72,73 These results suggest that the ABA-responsive ABRE-dependent transcriptional pathway is fundamental to dehydration-responsive gene expression in land plants, including Arabidopsis, rice, and soybean, and that it arose during land colonization of plants before the divergence of monocots and dicots. In contrast, the cold-inducible promoter sequence profiles displayed different characteristics among the three species we studied (Figs 5 and 6), suggesting that cold-responsive transcriptional pathways diversified after land colonization of plants.Supplementary dataSupplementary Data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported partly by grants from the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Japan (in part by Genomics for Agricultural Innovation, Development of Abiotic Stress Tolerant Crops by DREB Genes), the Program for Promotion of Basic and Applied Research for Innovations in Bio-oriented Industry (BRAIN), Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATREPS) of Japan Science and Technology Agency/Japan International Cooperation Agency, and the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan.We are grateful to E.

Genomic representation from 107 diverse genotypes of B. napus L. var. oleifera (rapeseed, AACC genomes) and B. rapa (AA genome) was used to develop a DArT array comprising 11 520 clones generated using PstI/BanII and PstI/BstN1 complexity reduction methods. In total, 1547 polymorphic DArT markers of high technical quality were identified and used to assess molecular diversity among 89 accessions of B. napus, B. rapa, B. juncea, and B. carinata collected from different parts of the world. Hierarchical cluster and principal component analyses based on genetic distance matrices identified distinct populations clustering mainly according to their origin/pedigrees. DArT markers were also mapped in a new doubled haploid population comprising 131 lines from a cross between spring rapeseed lines ‘Lynx-037DH’ and ‘Monty-028DH’. Linkage groups were assigned on the basis of previously mapped simple sequence repeat (SSRs), intron polymorphism (IP), and gene-based markers. The map consisted of 437 DArT, 135 SSR, 6 IP, and 6 gene-based markers and spanned 2288 cM. Our results demonstrate that DArT markers are suitable for genetic diversity analysis and linkage map construction in rapeseed.1. IntroductionThe Brassiceae tribe consists some of the world's most important oilseed and vegetable crops, such as Brassica napus L., (rapeseed, genomes = AACC, 2n = 4x = 38), Brassica rapa L. (Indian mustard, genome = AA, 2n = 2x = 20), Brassica juncea L. (genomes = AABB, 2n = 4x = 36), and Brassica oleracea L. (cauliflower, broccoli, Brussels sprout, cabbage, and kale, genome = CC, 2n = 2x = 18). Brassica napus originated as a result from spontaneous hybridization between B. rapa and B. oleracea1 and is believed to be originated in the Mediterranean region of south-western Europe where native B. rapa and B. oleracea overlap,2 although no wild populations exist. Today, rapeseed is one of the leading sources of vegetable oil, oil-meal, fodder, and serves as the raw material for a broad range of industrial products including bio-fuel, especially in European countries.Various molecular marker system based upon restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), randomly amplified polymorphic DNA, amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP®), simple sequence repeats (SSRs), sequence related amplified polymorphisms, and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) have been developed3–7 and further applied in rapeseed genetics and breeding research.2,8–15 Most of these markers are assayed on low-throughput agarose or polyacrylamide gel system, although markers based upon SSR and AFLP can be assayed on highly parallel genotyping platforms such as capillary electrophoresis systems, yet they are expensive to assay per data point.16Rapeseed breeding programmes require an efficient, cost-efficient and reproducible marker platform that is amenable for whole genomic analysis especially for pedigree and association analysis,17,18 mapping-as-you-go,19 large-scale molecular evaluation of germplasm collections and for genome-wide selection of desirable alleles.20 Current polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based marker technologies are not practicable in terms of consumable and labour costs for such applications.DNA hybridization-based technologies such as some SNP technologies and Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT) are suitable for such applications. SNP markers are recognized as ‘markers of choice’ due to their abundance and distribution in the genomes and the ability to screen populations at relatively low cost.21 In the recent years, a large number of SNP markers has been identified in B. napus and related species.22,23 However, the identification of SNPs and validation in the relevant germplasm especially those identified by sequencing candidate genes remains costly to implement for the routine marker-assisted selection, as it requires high-quality sequence information. This limits the broad application of SNP markers for rapeseed improvement using these strategies. Many genes of agronomic importance such as flowering time genes; Flowering Locus C (FLC) and Flowering Locus T (FT) occur in multiple copies in Brassica genomes.24,25 The presence of multiple copies of genes in amphidiploid rapeseed poses a great challenge to develop allele-specific SNP markers. To date, only a few genome-specific SNP markers are currently available for marker-assisted selection although the ability to resolve allelic variation in members of gene families has been demonstrated.26,27 In addition, a large number of SSR and SNP markers have been developed in private consortia and are not readily accessible to the rapeseed breeding programmes. The development of ‘genotyping by sequencing’ and multiplex sequencing strategies using next generation DNA-sequencing technologies offer to generate massive amount of genetic data for various applications.28,29 However, these technologies are currently in the development stage and bioinformatics tools to handle such massive data in polyploid Brassica species are still being developed.30 These limitations currently restrict the capacity of breeding programmes to routinely conduct genome-wide marker surveys.DArT performs well in many polyploid species and does not require any DNA-sequence information. DArT marker analysis is a sequence-independent microarray-based genotyping platform, and enables high multiplexing; simultaneous typing of several hundred to several thousands of polymorphic loci spread over the genome.31,32 DArT polymorphisms results from nucleotide polymorphisms within restriction enzyme (RE) recognition sites and indels, and the high fidelity of the RE can provide better reproducibility compared with PCR-based assays that are based on lower fidelity selective primer annealing. DArT markers have been developed in more than 40 plant species including in wheat, durum, barley, oats, lupin (www.diversityarray.com) and have been employed extensively for construction of molecular maps,33–36 identifying trait-marker associations,37–40 assessment of genetic diversity,34,41,42 association mapping,43 and routine genotyping in various crops for varietal identification.In this study, we report on (i) the development of a robust, cost-effective, and high-throughput DArT marker platform for rapeseed, and (ii) demonstrate the usefulness of DArT markers in the assessment of genetic diversity and linkage mapping.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materialEighty-nine accessions of B. napus, B. juncea, B. rapa and B. carinata comprising contemporary rapeseed cultivars and elite lines from Australian breeding programmes were chosen for molecular diversity analyses along with accessions from China, Germany, Japan, India, France, and Ethiopia (Table 1). Seed samples were procured from the Australian National Brassica Germplasm Improvement Programs (Wagga Wagga and Horsham) and Australian Temperate Field Crops Collection, Horsham.

Sass (Norddeutsche Pflanzenzucht Hans-Georg Lembke KG, Hohenlieth, Germany). Monty is an Australian spring variety with typical canola quality seed oil characteristics;46 Monty-028DH seed was provided by Canola Breeders Western Australia Pty Ltd (Perth, Australia). The DH parental lines Lynx-037DH and Monty-028DH were crossed reciprocally to produce F1 seeds. A single F1 plant from each reciprocal cross was used as microspore donor for microspore culture using the same methods as used for the parental DH lines production. Self-seed of the primary DH progeny were multiplied either during the summer of 2004–05 at Manjimup Horticultural Research Centre (Manjimup, Australia) or during the winter of 2005 at The University of Western Australia's Shenton Park field station (Perth, Australia).2.2. DNA isolationDNA was obtained from 131 ‘BnaLMDH’ lines along with parental and F1 controls using a standard CTAB method44 or using Illustra Nucleon Phytopure Genomic DNA Extraction Kits (GE Healthcare).2.3. Development of B. napus DArT arrayInitially, the most frequently used seven methods of complexity reduction (all based on a combination of PstI RE and a single ‘frequently cutting’ RE) were tested in several Brassica accessions by resolving products of representation amplification on 1.2% agarose gel. After this initial test, two methods with the most heterodispersed (no observable banding) smears of PCR products were selected: PstI/BstNI and PstI/BanII (data not reported). The DArT markers were designated with the prefix ‘BrPb’ where ‘Br’ indicates for Brassica, ‘P’ for PstI (primary enzyme used) and ‘b’ for BanII (secondary RE used) followed by a number corresponding to their unique clone ID.2.4. Preparation of genomic representationsThe PstI/BstNI genomic representations were prepared as described before for barley,32 while PstI/BanII representations were prepared similarly as for sorghum according to a previous report.36 Briefly, ~50 ng of genomic DNA was digested with either PstI and BstNI or PstI and BanII RE combinations and resulting fragments ligated to a PstI overhang compatible oligonucleotide adapter. A primer annealing to this adapter was used in PCR reaction to amplify complexity reduced representation of a sample. Amplification products were either used for cloning in marker development process or labelled with fluorescent dyes and hybridized to DArT array in genotyping process.2.5. Library construction and array printingFor library construction, we used 107 Brassica genotypes (Supplementary Table S1). Amplified PstI restriction fragments from all accessions were cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Australia) and 10 libraries were generated (Supplementary Table S2) as described by Jaccoud et al.31 The white colonies containing genomic fragments inserted into pCR2.1-TOPO vector were picked into individual wells of 384-well microtitre plates filled with ampicillin/kanamycin-supplemented freezing medium. There were 7680 clones in PstI/BstNI and 3840 clones in PstI/BanII libraries (a total of 11 520 clones). Inserts from these clones were amplified using M13F and M13R primers in 384 plate format, a subset of PCR products were assessed for quality (10% of 25 µl PCR reaction) through gel electrophoresis and all remaining PCR products dried, washed and dissolved in a spotting buffer as described previously.47 Microarrays were printed with spot duplication on SuperChip poly-l-lysine slides (Thermo Scientific, Australia) using a MicroGrid arrayer (Genomics Solutions, UK).2.6. DArT genotypingEach sample was assayed using methods described above for library construction. Genomic representations were assessed for quality through gel electrophoresis in 1.3% agarose and labelled with fluorescent dyes (Cy3 and Cy5) as described previously.32 Labelled targets were than hybridized to printed DArT arrays for 16 h at 62°C in a water bath. Slides were washed as described by Kilian et al.,47 dried initially by centrifugation at 500 × g for 7 min and later in a desiccator under vacuum for 30 min. The slides were scanned using Tecan LS300 scanner generating three images per array: one image scanned at 488 nm for reference signal measures the amount of DNA within the spot based on hybridization signal of FAM-labelled fragment of a TOPO vector multiple cloning site fragment and two images for ‘target’ signal measurement: one scanned at 543 nM (for Cy3-labelled targets) and one at 633 nm (for Cy-5-labelled targets).2.7. Array image processing and polymorphism scoringAll the images were analysed with the DArTsoft v. 7.4.7 (DArT P/L, Canberra, Australia) software. The same software was used to score polymorphic markers in a binary manner (for the presence of marker in the representation as ‘1’ and for the absence as ‘0’) as described previously.32 For quality control, 30% of genotypes were genotyped in full technical replication. Clones with P > 77%, a call rate >97%, and 100% allele-calling consistency across the replicates were selected as markers. P-value represents the allelic-states variance of the relative target hybridization intensity as a percentage of the total variance.34 The informativeness of the DArT markers was determined by calculating the polymorphism information content (PIC), within the panel of diverse accessions (Table 1) according to Anderson et al.482.8. Genetic diversity analysisPair-wise genetic similarity matrix was calculated from binary DArT matrices using the Jaccard's coefficient (J) where J = a/(n – d) and ‘a’ is the number of fragments in common, ‘d’ is the number of fragments absent, and ‘n’ is the total number of DArT loci scored.49 Similarities matrices were converted to genetic distances according to Swofford and Olson.50 The dendrogram was generated based on Jaccard's coefficient with Unweighted Pair-Group Method using Arithmetic average (UPGMA) method in Sequential, Agglomerative, Hierarchical and Nested Clustering module51 of Numerical Taxonomy and Multivariate Analysis System for personal computers software (NTSYS-pc), version 2.21.52 The marker data were processed using the SIMINT module in NTSYS to compute a correlation among the columns for the 1000 bootstrap samples. The dendrogram was visualized using the program TREEVIEW implemented in NTSYSpc. The MXCOMP subroutine was used to calculate a cophenetic correlation matrix between the genetic similarity matrix and the tree matrix to measure goodness-of-fit implemented in the NTSYSpc package. Multivariate principle component analysis (PCA) based on genetic similarity matrices were used to resolve the genetic relationship and overall diversity among different accessions.2.9. Linkage map constructionThe ‘BnaLMDH’ mapping population of 131 DH lines along with parental and F1 controls were genotyped with the initial marker discovery DArT array (Version 1.0). Highly polymorphic DArT clones in the set of diverse rapeseed germplasm (Supplementary Table S1) were selected and arrayed for routine DArT analysis (Version 2.0). A subset of 91 DH lines was also genotyped with Version 2.0 DArT array as described previously.SSR primer sequences were obtained from Lowe et al.53 and from the Agriculture and AgriFood Canada Brassica Microsatellite Consortium (for more information, see http://brassica.agr.gc.ca). Genetic map locations for the majority of these markers were reported previously.54 PCR and fragment analysis methods were as described by Nelson et al.55 In addition, intron polymorphism (IP) primer sequences and methods were reported by Panjabi et al.56 New gene-based markers were developed based on publicly available cDNA sequences for fatty acid desaturase and FLC genes.44 All polymorphic markers were scored using genotype codes ‘A’ (Lynx-037DH allele), ‘B’ (Monty-028DH allele), and ‘–’ (missing value).Linkage mapping was conducted with the aid of MultiPoint 2.1 (MultiQTL Ltd, Haifa, Israel), which uses the ‘evolutionary optimization strategy’.57 We followed the general approach described by Nelson et al.58 with minor modifications. Markers showing significant allele segregation distortion (i.e. diverging from the Mendelian expectation of 1A:1B) were excluded from the analysis with DArT markers (which were scored in a dominant manner) and treated more strictly than the other markers types (which were codominant). DArT markers with very severe segregation distortion (<U+03C7>2, P < 0.0001) were discarded before commencing linkage mapping on the basis that these may represent >1 locus, while DArT markers with less extreme segregation distortion (<U+03C7>2, P < 0.001) were included in the analysis but only as ‘attached’ markers (see explanation of this term below). Some codominant SSR, IP, and gene-based markers with very significant segregation distortion (<U+03C7>2, P < 0.0001) were included in the linkage analysis but were only permitted to act as ‘attached’ markers.Iterative clustering analysis began at recombination frequency: rf = 0.14 and was increased at 0.02 increments to a maximum of 0.30. Linkage groups were assigned chromosome names and orientated using microsatellite markers mapped in reference populations.54 Recombination frequencies between high-quality ‘framework’ markers were transformed to Kosambi distances in centiMorgans. ‘Redundant’ markers (those with identical map positions to their respective framework markers) and lower quality ‘attached’ markers (those with less well-supported map positions) were integrated into the most appropriate positions in framework marker map. As a quality control measure, marker genotyping scores that introduced singletons into the genotyping matrix of framework markers were re-checked to distinguish apparently true double crossover events from scoring errors. Care was taken not to over-correct the data such that apparently true double crossover events were retained in the scoring matrix. After correcting clear marker scoring errors, genetic interval sizes were recalculated.3. Results3.1. Assessment of genetic diversityA total of 1547 high-quality DArT markers were polymorphic in a set of 89 contemporary cultivars and elite rapeseed lines from breeding programmes. The call rate ranged from 78.9 to 100% with an average of 96.7% and scoring reproducibility was 100% for all selected markers. The PIC values of individual DArT markers ranged from 0.02 to 0.5 (original data not shown), with an average of 0.3. Similarity coefficients (J) based on the binary matrix between individual lines ranged from 0.50 to 0.93.The hierarchical cluster analysis discriminated all 89 genotypes of rapeseed into three major clusters (I, II, and III; Fig. 1), but clear differences were observed within these clusters, which were generally consistent with their phenology and genetic lineage. The cluster I consisted of a large number of accessions requiring vernalization for flowering such as ‘Fan023’, ‘Fan 028’, ‘Fan168’, ‘Qu1104’, ‘Yu178’, ‘Zhongyou821’, ‘P624’, ‘03-p74-6’, ‘04-p34’, ‘Carousel-10’, ‘Major’, ‘Expander’, ‘Drakker’, and ‘Mutu 98-1’ (Fig. 1). These varieties originated from China, France, and Japan (Table 1). Clusters II and III consisted of the Australian cultivars or their derivatives. In Cluster III, ‘RocketCL’, ‘Surpass400’, ‘Surpass402CL’, ‘Surpass404CL’, ‘Surpass501TT’, ‘Surpass603CL’, ‘Hyola 50’, and ‘Hyola60’ (bred by Pacific Seeds); ‘Marnoo’ and ‘Tatyoon’ (bred by Department of Primary Industries, Victoria); and ‘TawrifficTT’ (bred by Nuseed) showed strong grouping. Several subclades were evident in cluster II, and comprised a range of rapeseed cultivars bred by different Australian breeding programmes (Table 1), as many of them share the same parents in their pedigrees.59 The cultivars released by Pioneer: ‘46C40’, ‘45C05’, ‘46C76’, ‘44C73’, ‘46Y78’, ‘45Y77’, and ‘44Y06’ showed tight genetic relationship with ‘Ag-Spectrum’ and ‘Rainbow’ and grouped together in subclade in cluster II. Likewise, a discrete grouping of triazine tolerant cultivars (‘ATR’- and ‘TT’) was also evident in cluster II. These groupings were strongly related to geographic origin, parentage and selection history (http:/www.ipaustralia.gov.au/pbr/). For example, ‘45C05’ and ‘46C76’ had Rainbow and Dunkeld in their pedigrees, respectively. Despite being of the same parentage ‘Major’ and ‘Wesreo’ (Major/Oro) varieties did not show tighter grouping, and may be heterogeneous or heterozygous.

Three principal components (first three axes), explaining 25% of variation, were sufficient to represent most of the structured information generated with multivariate analysis and reconfirmed the groupings of different accessions resultant from the UPGMA-based phenogram (Supplementary Fig. S2).In order to test if the current DArT array is suitable for genetic analysis of other Brassica species, we analysed a subset of 32 genotypes representing B. rapa, B. juncea, B. carinata and investigated their genetic relationships in relation to selected B. napus cultivars representing ‘spring’ and ‘winter’ types from different breeding programmes (Table 1). Both cluster and PCA analyses differentiated different species of Brassica, as expected (Fig. 2, Supplementary Fig. S3). For example, cultivars/breeding lines of B. napus, B. rapa, B.carinata, and B. juncea clustered into distinct I–III groups. Within the B. napus cluster, two distinct subclades representing ‘winter and semi-spring cultivars’ (‘Carousel-10’, ‘Major’, ‘Norin 22’, ‘Iwao natame’, and ‘Mutu’) and ‘spring cultivars’ were clearly evident. Clustering of genotypes was consistent with their pedigrees and/or their origin (breeding programmes). Likewise, ‘Ag-Outback’ and ‘Ag-Muster’, and cultivars with suffix ‘Surpass’ share ancestry among themselves. For a general overview of Australian canola variety pedigrees, see Cowling.59 PCA of DArT data of 32 accessions also supported the grouping identified by cluster analysis. The top three principal components (dimensions) explained 58.6% of the genetic variation (Supplementary Fig. S3).

Identifying single-copy DArT markers for linkage mappingIn the 131 DH lines screened with the DArT array Version 1, 1171 DArT markers passed the standard DArT quality criteria. These criteria include minimal call rate for markers (>80%) and high reproducibility of technical replicates (average scoring consensus >99.7%). Given that B. napus is an allotetraploid species with strong residual homoeologous relationships among chromosomes, it was considered likely that some DArT markers would detect pairs of homoeologous loci rather than single loci. Therefore, <U+03C7>2 tests were used to test each DArT marker for goodness-of-fit for a one-locus model (1:1 segregation ratio of parental alleles) and for two-locus models (1:3 or 3:1 ratio of parental alleles). Only those fitting the single-locus model were retained for linkage mapping purposes. Of 1171 DArT markers scored, 644 were monomorphic, 415 had allelic ratios consistent with the one-locus model (1:1; P < 0.001), and 112 had allelic ratios consistent with the two-locus model (3:1 or 1:3; P < 0.001). In the 91 DH lines screening the Version 2 array, 1020 DArT markers passed the standard DArT quality criteria (as above). Of these, 552 were monomorphic, 351 had allelic ratios consistent with the one-locus model (1:1; P < 0.001) and 117 had allelic ratios consistent with the two-locus model (3:1 or 1:3; P < 0.001). Markers that were putatively single-locus were combined from both DArT analyses to give 444 DArT loci that were used for subsequent linkage mapping. There were few inconsistencies between independent DArT analyses, which were entered as missing values in the combined DArT marker set.3.3. Linkage mappingIn total, 584 marker loci (comprising 437 DArT, 135 SSR, 6 IP, and 6 gene-based markers) were used to generate a B. napus linkage map based on the BnaLMDH mapping population (Fig. 3, Supplementary Fig. S4; all scoring data provided in Supplementary Table S3, and summarized in Supplementary Table S4). Of these 584 loci, 329 were high-quality, non-redundant ‘framework’ markers, 209 were ‘redundant’ markers (i.e. co-segregated with respective framework markers), and 46 were lower quality ‘attached’ markers with less well-defined map positions. In consistent with the haploid chromosome number for B. napus (n = 19), there were 19 linkage groups with the shortest linkage group (A08) being 61.3 cM, the longest (C4) being 186.2 cM, and a total map length of 2288 cM (Supplementary Table S4). There were also two small clusters (Cluster-1 and Cluster-2) comprising four and three loci, respectively. There were also four markers (brPb-661033, brPb-662131, brPb-809033, and sN2675) that remained unlinked.

Map distances are given in centiMorgan (cM) on the left of sample linkage groups.Using SSR markers with known map locations, all linkage groups were unambiguously assigned chromosome names and orientated relative to the reference map.54 Alignment to the reference map revealed that this map encompasses ~90% of the known B. napus genome with notably incomplete coverage of chromosomes A07 (bottom half) and A08 (top half). DArT marker were unevenly distributed, with the proportion of DArT loci ranging from 31% (chromosome C5) to 90% (chromosome A03), with an average of 70% across all chromosomes (Supplementary Table S4).Several regions of the linkage map comprised markers with allelic segregation ratios diverging from the Mendelian expectation (1:1 for a DH population; Supplementary Table S3). The most significantly skewed deviations (<U+03C7>2, P < 0.001) were on linkage groups A01, A03, and A06 and encompassed both DArT and SSR markers. We found evidence of high frequency of homoeologous recombination between chromosomes A07 and C6, as shown by the tendency of A07 and C6 to cluster together during the linkage mapping process, which had to be manually separated.4. DiscussionWe developed and applied a high-throughput DArT marker array for the first time in rapeseed. We demonstrated that this whole-genome profiling technology is useful for establishing phylogenetic relationships among varieties and elite breeding Brassica lines and for construction of linkage map that has extensive genome coverage of the rapeseed genome.4.1. DArT markers for genetic diversity assessmentIn this study, we utilized up to 1547 DArT markers for the assessment of genetic diversity among accessions of rapeseed and related species. A number of these markers were distributed across the genome in the ‘BnaLMDH’ population (Fig. 3). Previously, only a limited number of markers were used to analyse genetic diversity in rapeseed. For example, Wang et al.12 used 18 SSR primer pairs to generate 112 polymorphic features for genetic diversity analysis of 48 Australian rapeseed cultivars while Chen et al.60 used 55 SSR primer pairs to generate 287 polymorphic features for genetic diversity analysis of 72 cultivars. DArT markers with extensive genome coverage, developed in this study, will provide better estimate of the extent of genetic diversity. DArT markers have the additional advantage of being based largely on SNP variation, which more closely reflects normal genome evolutionary behaviour compared with SSRs that have high rates of mutation.61 Therefore, this DArT resource constitutes a significant improvement in marker density, and possibly quality, compared with that possible with marker technology previously available for rapeseed.We employed both cluster and PCA analyses for studying genetic diversity and population structure. Results suggested that genetic diversity exists within the rapeseed germplasm. Most of the Australian varieties were grouped into distinct clusters according their common ancestry.59,62 For example, ‘Yickadee’, ‘Maluka’, ‘Eureka’, ‘Shiralee’, ‘Rainbow’, ‘45C75’, ‘44Y06’, ‘Ag-Spectrum’, ‘46C76’, and ‘45Y77’ share pedigrees with each other59 (Patel personal communication. http://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/pbr/index.shtml). This confirms that gene flow into Australian breeding programmes was restricted before the time of release of these varieties.59 Furthermore, all Australian varieties up to the year 2000 were developed from the same set of donor sources collected from Japan, France, Poland, Germany, Sweden, and Canada.59 However, some accessions overlapped or distributed across well-defined clusters, for example ‘Karoo’ (Fig 1). This could be due to the fact that rapeseed (syn canola) is a predominantly self-pollinated crop; however, outcrossing may occur, ranging from 5 to 36% under field conditions.63,64 Therefore, heterogeneity and heterozygosity in some varieties, such as ‘Karoo’, is very likely. This phenomena has been reported in previous studies,11 especially in the Australian cultivars which were developed using open-pollinated pedigree selection without ‘intentional selfing’.62 Furthermore, many breeding programmes have intentionally released ‘genetically mixed’ varieties to cope with environmental variation and biotic stresses.63,64 Phenograms also clearly differentiated ‘winter’ and ‘spring’ types, which represent to different gene pools as described previously using RFLP markers.8,65 Our results are consistent with previous studies which showed that rapeseed accessions can be grouped on the basis of flowering habit (winter and spring type), and on the basis of origin by geographical region and breeding organizations.8,9,12,65–67DArT markers also enabled us to assess genetic diversity among four agricultural Brassica species that are extensively being used in rapeseed improvement programmes. Although we have not sampled extensively these species, DArT markers allowed us to differentiate B. rapa (AA), B. napus (AACC), B. juncea (AABB), and B. carinata (BBCC) on their polymorphism patterns. Therefore, the current DArT platform is suitable for genotyping of different Brassica species especially those having ‘A’ and ‘C’ genomes and may facilitate alien gene introgression from related species.4.2. Implication of diversityThis DArT marker analysis supports previous studies that show that rapeseed accessions from Australia, Europe, and China are genetically differentiated.60 Crossing between these differentiated sources can be used to enlarge genetic diversity in rapeseed breeding programmes.59 Genetic distance estimates would assist breeding programmes to maximize the level of variation in their germplasm and to exploit high heterosis in hybrid varieties. DArT allelic profiles produced in this study will also be useful for fast and accurate DNA fingerprinting of elite Australian rapeseed genotypes and identifying loci associated with traits of agronomic importance using association mapping strategy.4.3. Genome-wide coverage of DArT markersA genetic map of ‘BnaLMDH’ was constructed using 437 DArT, 135 SSR, 6 IP, and 6 gene-based markers. These markers provided good coverage across all 19 linkage groups, corresponding to all 10 chromosomes of A and 9 chromosomes of C genome of B. napus. Good genome coverage could be partly attributed to the enrichment of the genic regions with the use of PstI. The map of ‘BnaLMDH’ population covering 2288 cM is comparable with the previous genetic linkage maps of B. napus, spanning distances of 1173–2619 cM.68–70 Approximately 10% of the DArT loci were found to be duplicated in this study. Therefore, a limited effect of homoplasmy is anticipated on the usage of DArT in diversity analysis in allotetraploid B. napus.5. ConclusionWe developed the DArT platform for genetic analysis of Brassica genomes and demonstrated its usefulness in genetic diversity assessment and genetic map construction. Our results have proved that DArT technology is amenable for various downstream applications such as cluster analysis and map construction, including for trait-marker association analyses.66 It can supplement marker systems that cannot be analysed in a highly parallel genotyping format, such as SSR markers. SSRs are suitable to distinguish heterozygotes due to their, in general, co-dominance. Besides, excessive stutter bands and overlapping bands due to coamplification of loci also limit the usefulness of SSR markers in rapeseed. In light of the current paucity of high-density SNP assay formats for rapeseed and the embryonic nature of genotyping by sequencing technologies, the development of the DArT platform for rapeseed is a significant development for identifying trait-marker association, genetic diversity, and population genetics studies and whole-genome selection in this important crop species.Supplementary DataSupplementary Data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingAuthors are thankful to the NSW Agricultural Genomic Centre funded under BioFirst Initiative of NSW Government, and various organizations for supporting research under the DArT International Rapeseed Consortium led by Dr Kilian.

PCC 6803","The cyanobacterium, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, was the first photosynthetic organism whose genome sequence was determined in 1996 (Kazusa strain). It thus plays an important role in basic research on the mechanism, evolution, and molecular genetics of the photosynthetic machinery. There are many substrains or laboratory strains derived from the original Berkeley strain including glucose-tolerant (GT) strains. To establish reliable genomic sequence data of this cyanobacterium, we performed resequencing of the genomes of three substrains (GT-I, PCC-P, and PCC-N) and compared the data obtained with those of the original Kazusa strain stored in the public database. We found that each substrain has sequence differences some of which are likely to reflect specific mutations that may contribute to its altered phenotype. Our resequence data of the PCC substrains along with the proposed corrections/refinements of the sequence data for the Kazusa strain and its derivatives are expected to contribute to investigations of the evolutionary events in the photosynthetic and related systems that have occurred in Synechocystis as well as in other cyanobacteria.1. IntroductionCyanobacteria are capable of oxygenic photosynthesis; they are thought to be the progenitor of plant plastids. Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 is one of the most widely used cyanobacterial species for genetic studies for several major reasons; (i) it is naturally competent by incorporating exogenous DNA into cells that is integrated into the genome by homologous recombination at high frequency;1–3 (ii) it grows heterotrophically in the presence of glucose;3,4 (iii) the entire genome sequence was determined early on by Kaneko et al.5 The availability of the entire genome sequence facilitated post-genomic investigations such as transcriptome-, proteome-, and functional genomics studies.6The original strain of Synechocystis was isolated from California freshwater by Kunisawa and colleagues and called the Berkeley strain;7 it was deposited in the Pasteur Culture Collection (PCC strain) and the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC strain). Williams3 subsequently isolated the glucose-tolerant (GT) strain from the ATCC strain.3 The Kazusa strain, whose genome sequence was published in 1996,5 is a derivative of a GT strain. A single representative clone of the GT strain was established for complete genome sequencing as the Kazusa strain; other strains were maintained and transferred without further cloning such as single colony isolation.8 Therefore, four substrains, PCC-, ATCC-, GT-, and Kazusa strains, all derived from the original Berkeley strain, were distributed to a number of laboratories although all of them were grouped together under the name Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803.9 Ikeuchi and Tabata8 reported that each substrain had specific mutations such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and indels, and some exhibited a specific phenotype. Some of the mutated loci that were different from the sequence in the database derived from the Kazusa strain have been identified such as a SNP,10 indels,6,11–13 and IS mobilization.14 However, the total number of mutations in the whole genome of each strain remained unknown and sequence variations in these major strains can be expected to raise problems in the evaluation of phenotypes of mutants constructed from these strains. The history of these major substrains and additional substrains, isolated as a single colony from the PCC- and GT strain (GT-I strain; the standard strain in Dr Ikeuchi's group) was summarized by Ikeuchi and Tabata.8 The single colonies isolated from the PCC strain were designated PCC-P (positive phototaxis) strain and PCC-N (negative phototaxis) strain based on the direction of phototactic movement.15 A derivative of the GT-I strain that acquired high light tolerance and a glucose-sensitive phenotype was designated the WL strain, which has an SNP in the pmgA gene.16,17 Thus, there are two fundamental problems for post-genomic research in bacterial molecular genetics. One is the heterogeneity of cells in the frozen stock of the culture collection centres; the other is the frequent spontaneous mutation in bacterial genomes, an event that may be unavoidable during the long cultivation of bacterial cells. As revealed in Bacillus subtilis, whole-genome resequencing is a powerful solution for obtaining the sequence information of such spontaneous mutants.18Without question, laboratories should start their post-genomic research with genome sequence data of the ‘reference’ or ‘standard’ strain. We deciphered the three substrains of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, i.e. PCC-P, PCC-N, and GT-I, to reconstruct the informatics basis of the molecular biology of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. We identified a number of SNPs and indels in these substrains and introduced a genetic strategy to identify the mutated loci on a genome-wide level using the massive parallel sequencer. Especially, determination of the genome sequence of PCC substrains will widely contribute cyanobacterial researches using the frozen stock cells supplied from the PCC.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Bacterial strains and genomic DNASynechocystis PCC-P, PCC-N, and GT-I strains were maintained as frozen stocks in the laboratory of Dr Masahiko Ikeuchi at The University of Tokyo, Japan. The PCC-P and PCC-N strains that exhibited positive- or negative-direction movement under phototaxis test conditions, respectively, were isolated by Yoshihara et al.19 as a single colony from frozen stock obtained from the French Pasteur Culture Collection (PCC strain; see catalogue of strains.9). Genomic DNA was extracted with the hot-phenol method.162.2. Sequencing methodsDNA was uniformly sheared into 300-bp portions using Adaptive Focused Acoustics (Covaris Inc., Woburn, MA, USA). We constructed a DNA library with a median insert size of 300 bp for a paired-end read format. The quality of the DNA library was checked with the Sanger method by Escherichia coli transformation of aliquots of the library solution. The library was sequenced on a Genome Analyser II (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Sample preparation, cluster generation, and 50-base paired-end sequencing were according to the manufacturer's protocols with minor modifications (Illumina paired-end cluster generation kit GAII ver. 2, 36-cycle sequencing kit ver. 3) with multiplex method using the single lane of the 8 lane flow-cell. Image analysis and ELAND alignment were with Illumina's Pipeline Analysis software ver. 1.6. Sequences passing standard Illumina GA pipeline filters were retained.2.3. Mapping analyses using short-read sequencesFor short-read alignment and calling variants (SNPs and InDels), we used the short-read mapping software MAQ version 0.7.1,20 BWA ver. 0.5.1,21 and SAMtools ver. 0.1.9.22 MAQ alignments were done using the ‘easyrun’ option of the maq-pl script using the default parameter settings. The SNP filtering was performed using the default parameters except for the minimum consensus quality for SNPs (-q 40). BWA alignments and the subsequent variants calling using SAMtools were done using the default parameter settings. Finally, we applied the following filtering criteria to the lists of SNPs/indels: minimum read depth for SNPs calling = 3, minimum read depth for indel calling = 10, and a 60% cut-off of the percent of aligned reads calling the SNP/indel per total mapped reads at the non-reference allele sites. We also used BWA to estimate the sequence read depth affecting the coverage and accuracy of the variant calls. Structural variations were identified using BreakDancer23 with default parameters.2.4. Mapping analyses using contigs assembled de novoRead sequences were assembled de novo with the Velvet assembly programme.24 For optimization of the hash value of the assembly process we used the N50 size. The de novo assembled contigs were mapped on the genome sequence of a database derived from the Kazusa strain using MUMmer sequence alignment package25 with default settings. We then employed show-SNPs functions of the MUMmer program to produce lists of SNPs/indels which were applied the filtering criteria describe above.2.5. Annotation and creation of the SNP/indel listThe list of SNPs/indels was then annotated with in-house developed software Variant Annotator (VA) that was specifically designed to check amino acid substitutions attributable to the large number of identified SNPs/indels using Genbank annotation files. We used the GenBank, RefSeq, cyanobacterial database Cyanobase (http://genome.kazusa.or.jp/cyanobase), CyanoClust,26 and also ORF information of the GT-S strain,27 which is the recently resequenced substrain of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, for precise annotation of each ORF.2.6. Capillary sequencing with the Sanger method for SNP/indel confirmationAbout 200-base genomic regions around the SNPs and indels called by the mapping programmes were amplified by PCR and sequenced on a capillary sequencer with the Sanger method using the commercial sequence service of MACROGEN (Tokyo, Japan). To confirm the SNPs located near IS elements or repetitive regions, the longer DNA fragments were amplified to avoid the amplification of other homologous regions in the Synechocystis genome. The primers used for confirmation are listed in Supplementary Table S1.2.7. Uploading the genome sequence in the databaseShort-read data, obtained on a Genome Analyzer II (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), of the substrains of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, PCC-P, PCC-N, and GT-I, were deposited in the DRA (DDBJ Sequence Read Archive; http://trace.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/DRASearch/); the accession number is DRA000401. The genome sequences and gene annotations of the substrain GT-I, PCC-P, and PCC-N were also deposited in the DDBJ/GenBank/EMBL database with the accession numbers for each substrain, GT-I (AP012276), PCC-P (AP012278), and PCC-N (AP012277).2.8. Phylogenetic analysis of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 substrainsPhylogenetic relationship of various strains was estimated by the maximum parsimony method by assuming that both base change and indel are treated as a single event. The computation was performed by the dolpenny software of the Phylip package version 3.67,28 using the polymorphism option. Each branch length was set as the number of events occurring along the branch.3. Results3.1. Analytical scheme applied to the massive short-read data obtained by next-generation sequencingThe amplified DNA library was sequenced by GAII with 50-base paired-end methods using the parameter settings described in Materials and methods section. We obtained 250, 257, and 221 Mb read data for GT-I, PCC-N, and PCC-P substrains, respectively (Table 1). These read depths correspond to more than 60 times the genome size of Synechocystis. Read data were mapped using three analyses to identify the genomic position of the SNPs, indels, and rearrangements (Fig. 1): (i) BWA21 and MAQ20 for mapping analysis using raw read data; (ii) Velvet24 and MUMmer25 for mapping analysis using de novo assembled contigs; and (iii) BreakDancer23 for rearrangement analysis such as IS movement. The number of mutations was called by each programme and passed through the filter settings of the SAMtools program22 (Table 1). Distributions of averaged read depth in each 1 kb along with the entire genome, obtained by BWA and MAQ were shown in Supplemental Fig. S1. At least 15 times read depth was obtained even in the lowest read depth region. It also indicates that patterns of the read depth distribution depend on the algorithm of each mapping programme. The mapping programmes BWA, MAQ, and MUMer called 76, 69, and 85 potential mutation points, respectively, for the GT-I strain as primary data, 89, 75, and 109 points for the PCC-P strain, and 78, 79, and 104 points for the PCC-N strain. To confirm these results, we checked the sequence around all these loci by Sanger sequencing; regions of ~200 bp were amplified around the position of the mutations. Depending on the parameter settings, read depth and sequence specificity, it happens that common SNPs in all three substrains were detected only in one or two substrains in each programme. Even if the SNP is called only in one strain, we performed Sanger sequencing of the same locus in all three strains. Whole oligo DNA primers prepared for PCR reactions are listed in Supplemental Table S1.

Combinatorial use of the mapping programmes contributes to the identification of SNPs and indelsConfirmation by Sanger sequencing alerted to a number of false-positive SNP- and indel-calls. Final numbers of SNPs/indels in each substrain were only about 20–40% of the called numbers by each programme as shown in Table 1. Most of the false-positive SNPs or indels were located in repetitive regions or in highly homologous genes in the Synechocystis genome. We expected that the cut-off value of mapping programmes as 60% is enough to detect a number of heterogeneous SNPs of Synechocystis which has multi-copy genome, because 80% SNPs were called as heterogeneous SNPs by BWA in case of GT-I strain. However, we could not detect any heterogeneous SNPs among them by the Sanger method. It indicates that there are technical problems in expecting the total number of the heterogeneous SNPs in the whole genome using cut-off value settings or base-call percentage data obtained by these mapping programmes. On the other hand, all 16 SNPs called homogeneous SNPs by BWA in GT-I strain were also confirmed by the Sanger method. The total number of mutations confirmed by the Sanger method is shown in Fig. 2 with the number of mutations including false-positive data in parenthesis. These numbers are the sum of results obtained for the three substrains. We found that the combinatorial use of several programmes is necessary for the comprehensive detection of SNPs/indels and for the identification of mutations. Mutation loci detected commonly by all three programmes were more reliable than that detected by only the single programme (Fig. 2). Difference of the distribution pattern of the read depth in each mapping programme also suggests that combination use of several programmes is more adequate (Supplemental Fig. S1). However, it is worth noting, SNPs/indels identified commonly by three programmes covered only 60% of the total number of mutations. The correct detection of IS movements reported by Okamoto et al.14 was possible only with BreakDancer, a programme developed for the detection of genome rearrangements.23Diagram of the mutations identified by each programme. The number of mutations (SNPs and indels) confirmed by the Sanger method is shown in each circle with the number of mutations including false-positive data in parenthesis. The number of mutations detected by plural programmes is indicated in the circle overlap region. Threshold (cut-off) value of 60% was used in mapping programmes; BWA and MAQ (see Materials and methods section). Mutations detected commonly by all three programmes were more reliable.

Numbers labelled with an asterisk contain miss-called results indicated by parenthesis in Tables 2 and 3.3.3. Comparison of the identified SNPs/indels and the genome sequence in the databaseThe confirmed mutations are listed in Tables 2 and 3. The three substrains, GT-I, PCC-P, and PCC-N, manifested at least 22 common different sites compared with the sequence of the Kazusa strain in the database. Among these mutation sites, 15 sites were different from the database sequence, but not real differences in the genomic loci as revealed by Tajima et al.27 (Table 2). We also found that there are totally 14 mutations between the GT/Kazusa- and the PCC-P/PCC-N strains (Table 3). The PCC-P and PCC-N substrains contained three and eight additional specific mutations, respectively (Table 3). These may be potential mutations that elicited the known difference in the phototactic phenotype of the PCC substrains. For example, the PCC-N substrain has mutation in the gspE2 (pilB2) gene for pilus assembly, which also moderately affects the transformation efficiency.15 The PCC-N strain also has a 12-base deletion in the kinase domain of the hik33 gene for the histidine kinase without a frameshift. Hik33 is the multi-stress sensor in Synechocystis and it is conserved in all cyanobacterial species.29–31 This suggests that this substrain may lose the Hik33-dependent regulation of global gene expression, although the relationship between hik33 and phototaxis remains to be determined.

Several indel regions miscalled as SNP by MAQ and BWA were shown in parentheses.A part of the indel regions was miss-called as SNPs by the mapping programmes. We aligned the genome sequence of the substrains around the indels (Fig. 3) and found that these indels were located in the middle of two direct repeat- or direct repeat-like sequences. Interestingly, these direct repeats found in the deleted regions were not common sequence. Mapping analyses using de novo assembled contigs (Velvet and MUMmer) help to correct the false-positive SNP/indel-calls made by mapping programmes such as BWA and MAQ (Table 2).

At these SNP loci, we detected a second peak from the other nucleotide. As the Synechocystis genome is multi-copy, some of the genome copies may harbour heterogeneous SNPs. These loci were not in a multi-repeat region of the genome.A phylogenetic scheme of the history of the Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 substrains is presented in Fig. 4.

Problems associated with the heterogeneity of frozen stocks of bacterial strainsFrozen stocks in culture centres are basically stored as heterogeneous cell groups of the particular bacteria, such as E. coli K-12 MG1655.32 Thus, when aliquots of the frozen cells are thawed, selection bias due to the growth conditions arises; this affects the major genotype of the cells in culture. We posit that the heterogeneity of cells in different laboratories affected the results of genetic research or phenotypic analyses and we suggest that post-genomic research on cyanobacteria in the next generation should be based on resequenced strains as the new reference for each laboratory. In studies on post-genomic science using various mutants, it is better to prepare the frozen stock cells of single colonies one by one and also of the parental cell as soon as possible after the isolation of the mutants. It is also unquestionable that long-term cultivation of the cells on the gels or in the liquid cultures is not appropriate to keep the genotype of the cells.4.2. Potential factors that affect phenotypic differences in 6803 substrainsWe found a small number of substrain-specific mutations in PCC-P and PCC-N strains. It can be expected that a mutation accounts for the difference in the phototactic phenotype of PCC-P and PCC-N strains.19 Furthermore, the 14 mutations found in the GT/Kazusa- and the PCC-P/PCC-N strains suggest that their loci may affect the cell motility of these strains8 or their glucose tolerance.3 Our findings may be useful in functional studies on the gene that is disrupted by SNPs or indels in specific substrains. As Kamei et al.12 or Okamoto et al.14 suggested, the real function of several genes could only be studied in specific substrains which have the original nucleotide sequence without any SNPs, indels, or IS insertions.4.3. Indels located between two direct repeats result in miss-calls by the mapping programmeConfirmation of our results with the Sanger method revealed that specific deletion patterns were miss-called or undetected at high frequency by mapping analysis of short-read type data. Several deleted regions in the middle of direct-repeat sequences were miss-called as SNPs or undetected (Tables 2 and 3). Alignment of the DNA sequence of the three substrains clearly showed direct repeats on both sides of the deletion locus (Fig. 3). After the deletion event only a single direct repeat sequence remained, leading to the hypothesis that the deletion was due to self-crossover. At present we do not know what mechanisms or factors trigger these deletions, but caution should be exercised when we perform long-term cultivation of cyanobacterial cells. This is also a technical problem of mapping analysis to detect the exact positions of SNPs and indels using massive short-read data of next-generation sequencers.4.4. Problems raised by heterozygous and homozygous SNPsIn this analysis, we found that the threshold value for SNP detection by BWA and MAQ was more than 60% of read data covering the SNP positions. However, Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803 has a multi-copy genome,33 suggesting that the genome contains unidentified heterozygous SNPs below the threshold value. It is technically difficult to identify all heterozygous SNPs in the genome; if we lower the threshold, the number of false-positive SNPs increases drastically. Mutations hidden as minor heterozygous SNPs may become major SNPs under specific conditions and affect the cell phenotype, an observation reported by Hihara and Ikeuchi16 and Hihara et al.,17 who studied the pmgA mutant. The active retention of heterogeneity may be a strategy of cyanobacteria for acclimation to environmental changes. Heterogeneous SNPs found in the same locus in several substrains such as the loci 1192983 and 3098707 were the candidates to understand such mechanisms. The detection of minor heterozygous SNPs is a future problem for mapping using massive parallel sequencing.In this study, we identified a number of differences in the genome sequence of laboratory strains and published sequence data derived from the Kazusa strain. Resequence data on PCC substrains will be useful for considering evolutionary events among Synechocystis intra-species. For the reconstruction of informatics in post-genomic studies on Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, resequence analysis is effective and represents a powerful genetic strategy to identify potential mutation loci in spontaneous mutants with altered phenotypes.Supplementary dataSupplementary data is available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis study was supported by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (S0801025).Supplementary data"

Nucleosome formation depends on several factors, including properties of the sequence itself, but also physical constraints and epigenetic factors such as chromatin-remodelling enzymes. In this view, a sequence-dependent approach is able to capture a general tendency of a region to bind a histone octamer. A reference data set of positioned nucleosomes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was used to study the role of DNA helical rise in histone–DNA interaction. Genomic sequences were transformed into arrays of helical rise values by a tetranucleotide code and then turned into profiles of mean helical rise values. These profiles resemble maps of nucleosome occupancy, suggesting that intrinsic histone–DNA interactions are linked to helical rise. The obtained results show that preferential nucleosome occupancy occurs where the mean helical rise reaches its largest values. Mean helical rise profiles obtained by using maps of positioned nucleosomes of the Drosophila melanogaster and Plasmodium falciparum genomes, as well as Homo sapiens chromosome 20 confirm that nucleosomes are mainly located where the mean helical rise reaches its largest values.1. IntroductionThe observation that specific DNA sequences favour the formation of nucleosomes1–6 raises the possibility that sequence plays a significant role in organizing nucleosomal arrays.7,8 Recently, computational models for sequence-based prediction of nucleosome positioning in Saccharomyces cerevisiae were proposed.9,10 These models are generative and used dinucleotide and pentanucleotide frequencies collected from a training set of aligned nucleosome-bound sequence to predict histone–DNA interactions. Peckham et al.11 proposed a complementary computational model that is discriminative, rather than generative, and that focuses on only sequences that show the strongest signals of nucleosome occupancy or vacancy in a microarray-based assay of S. cerevisiae. Miele et al.12 used sequence-dependent DNA flexibility and an intrinsic curvature to predict the nucleosome occupancy along the genomes of S. cerevisiae and Drosophila melanogaster. Morozov et al.13 used bending data to design both strong and weak histone-binding sequences, and measured the corresponding free energies of nucleosome formation in order to provide a physical explanation for the intrinsic sequence dependence of histone–DNA interactions. A reference map of nucleosome positions in S. cerevisiae has recently been compiled through the analysis of several genome-wide data sets produced in various laboratories and reported at http://atlas.bx.psu.edu/, where it has been made available as a Microsoft Excel worksheet named ‘additional data file 1’.14 In yeast, non-random positioning of nucleosomes has been established mainly at promoters, where a nucleosome-free region (NFR) is followed by a highly positioned nucleosome at the +1 position. The +1 nucleosome forms a barrier against which subsequent nucleosomes with a decreasing stability are located.15 The role of intrinsic DNA sequences either in in vitro or in vivo nucleosome positioning has recently been at the centre of a debate16–19 about the existence of a genomic code for nucleosome positioning. One central topic of the debate concerns the correct use of the terms ‘positioning’ and ‘occupancy’, which are both connected to the uncertainty on the location of the histone dyad axis on the DNA sequence. In this paper, we adopt the following simple nomenclature: ‘positioning’ locates the dyad axis with an uncertainty of a few base pairs, whereas ‘occupancy’ allows reaching a few tens of  base pairs, and this error in location is called fuzziness. It is generally accepted that the DNA sequence influences, to some extent, in vivo nucleosome positioning, which is regulated by many other additional epigenetic factors. In yeast, the role of chromatin-remodelling enzymes, such as isw2, has extensively been studied and a map of genome-wide nucleosome positions in an isw2 deletion strain has been reported in the ‘additional data file 1’.14 The study of isw2 has implications for the predictions of nucleosome positions on the basis of the DNA sequence alone and it has been hypothesized that the loss of isw2 would allow nucleosomes to adopt their inherent positioning preference.20 In previous papers,21,22 we reported a correlation between the stability of nucleosomes and the presence of a symmetrical distribution of distances from the nucleosomal dyad axis at specific points. These points represent the locations of phosphates along the DNA minor groove, where histone–DNA electrostatic bonds are formed. These symmetric distances were calculated by means of a tetranucleotide helical rise code22 applied to known nucleosome-positioning sequences. In that paper, the presence of symmetric distances was mainly correlated to the probability of finding nucleosomes, and on the other hand, we succeeded in observing the absence of symmetric distances in NFRs, which are usually found in vivo at the transcription start sites (TSSs) of human promoters. We recently extended our analysis to yeast promoters and observed that helical rise profiles of NFR sequences exhibit lower mean values than those obtained for adjacent sequences where nucleosomes are usually found. In addition, we argued that the generation of mean helical rise curves and the presence of a symmetric shape in their profile could be related to the presence of nucleosomes. These preliminary results prompted us to analyse the whole yeast genome in a systematic way, so that we generated profiles of helical rise values averaged by various smoothing windows (see methods) and searched for possible correlations between helical rise profiles and known nucleosome positions. We hypothesized that the histone protein begins to interact with DNA exploring at least 26 bp, a length where six principal interactions between the DNA phosphates and the basic amino acids of H3 and H4 histones are formed.23 Once the optimal site of interaction has been found, DNA continues to wrap around the histone protein and 56 bp are involved in the formation of six additional interactions. When 90 bp are engaged in the complex, about a complete turn of DNA is wrapped, while the final form of the nucleosome is achieved when ~150 bp make one and three quarters of a turn of DNA wrap around the histone protein. We obtained then our helical rise profiles by a set of smoothing windows of 26, 56, 90 and 150 bp, respectively, in order to account for the start and the end of histone–DNA interaction. We also compared our helical rise profiles with those obtained by the dinucleotide frequency method developed by Segal et al.9,10 and the results are available at http://genie.weizmann.ac.il/software/nucleo_prediction.html.2. Materials and methods2.1. Nucleosome positionsData referring to nucleosome positioning in S. cerevisiae and D. melanogaster were collected from reference maps of nucleosome positions reported at http://atlas.bx.psu.edu/. Nucleosome positions of Plasmodium falciparum were downloaded from plasmoDB (www.plasmoDB.org) and those of human chromosome 20, derived from the experimental data of Schones et al.,24 were downloaded from http://www.gri.seu.edu.cn/icons.25Nucleosome positions derived by computational analysis of human chromosome 20 were derived from http://www.gri.seu.edu.cn/icons.2.2. DNA sequencesThe whole nucleotide sequences of S. cerevisiae, D. melanogaster and P. falciparum were downloaded from the NCBI database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). The DNA sequence of human chromosome 20 was downloaded from the UCSC genome database, built hg 18 (http://genome.ucsc.edu). DNA sequences of 1-kb long (symmetric with respect to the potential dyad axis) were extracted (hg 18 built).2.3. Computational analysis3. Results and discussion3.1. Symmetrical helical rise profilesThe DNA sequences were downloaded from the NCBI database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and transformed, by our tetranucleotide code, into an array of consecutive helical rise values. In yeast, this primary array was averaged by means of four different smoothing windows and, for each window, 61 110 mapped dyad nucleosome positions, belonging to the reference set included in the additional data file 1,14 were used to obtain 61 110 profiles of 1-kb-long mean helical rise, each containing 500 bp located upstream of the central dyad axis and 500 downstream. For each window, the average of the 61 110 profiles was performed for the reference data set and reported in Fig. 1A as a solid black line. Same approach was used for any of the six other data sets contained in the additional data file 1,14 returning helical rise profiles (data not shown) closely similar to those generated for the reference set. An analogous procedure was executed for the 54 907 nucleosome positions of an isw2 deletion strain of S. cerevisiae20 reported in the same additional data file 1.14Helical rise profiles of nucleosome positions. (A) Average helical rise profiles of mapped nucleosome positions in yeast (average of 61 110 points, black solid line) and in an isw2 deletion strain (average of 54 907 points, pink solid line) for four different smoothing windows of 26, 56, 90 and 150 bp.

Nucleosome dyad positions are aligned at bp number 0; 500 bp upstream and downstream of this point are shown. Black dots with (146-bp long) horizontal bars mark positions of mapped nucleosomes. Colour figures can be found in the online version of this paper.The results obtained for the isw2 deletion strain are shown in Fig. 1A as a solid pink line. In the same figure are shown, as markers, the positions of five nucleosomes that cover 147 bp each and are mutually separated by 18 bp of linker DNA as reported for yeast.14 In each of the four panels both the reference and the isw2 curves are symmetric with respect to the dyad axis located at bp number 0. This behavior is more pronounced for the 90-bp long smoothing window, which represents a length equivalent to a full turn of DNA wrapped around the histone core. When applied to the DNA sequence alone, the helical rise method shows that yeast nucleosomes are positioned at higher helical rise values than their linkers. The symmetry of the central peak supports our early results22 on the correlation between nucleosome stability and symmetrical distribution of helical rise values around the nucleosomal dyad axis. In the four panels of Fig. 1A, the mean helical rise values of each isw2 profile are systematically larger than those of the reference set. Moreover, the reference profiles corresponding to the 26- and the 56-bp-long smoothing windows, unlike their isw2 counterparts, are both characterized by a central peak clearly split into two adjacent maxima. These maxima are separated by ~60 bp and their disappearance is therefore evident in the helical rise profiles obtained with smoothing windows of 90 and 150 bp reported in Fig. 1A. An explanation for the differences in the rise value and peak shape between the isw2 and reference samples may be found considering the role of the isw2-remodelling enzymes in S. cerevisiae. It has been reported that isw2 enzymes’ reposition nucleosomes near promoter regions in order to suppress antisense transcription; the repositioning can range from a few bp to ±73 bp and in an isw2 deletion strain, nucleosomes tend to place themselves at their preferred targets, selected on the basis of the DNA sequence alone.20 Our algorithm, based on a sequence-dependent approach, correctly shows preferential sites when the effect of isw2 is silenced. The presence of the double peaks, shown in Fig. 1 for the 26- and the 56-bp-long smoothing windows in the wild-type profiles, is due to the action of isw2, which repositions nucleosomes on the DNA sequence. The helical rise can actually render nucleosome occupancy; indeed, in the reference sample, isw2 remodellers are active and the mapped nucleosome positions are split away from the central position; on the other hand, due to the convergence of the isw2 nucleosome positions towards a single maximum value in the central peak, the isw2 average profiles are always higher than those corresponding to the reference set.Shown in Fig. 1B are the helical rise profiles obtained for the single chromosome I of S. cerevisiae. The shape of the black and pink curves (reference and isw2 data set, respectively) is identical to that reported for the whole yeast genome shown in Fig. 1A at the smoothing window of 56 bp. Also shown in Fig 1B with a grey continuous line is a control curve obtained for the DNA sequence of chromosome I with dyad positions scrambled with those of chromosome II. The loss of symmetry and the random shape of the scrambled curve are evident.3.2. Peak height and nucleosome occupancyAnother characteristic of the profiles shown in Fig. 1 is represented by the lower values of the mean helical rise for nucleosomes adjacent to the central one. As to this feature, a preliminary attempt was made to understand how the peak height of the helical rise profiles is correlated to nucleosome stability. We reprocessed the reference data set in the additional data file 1,14 where nucleosome occupancy is expressed in the range from 1 to 7 arbitrary units, classifying nucleosome positions as: very stable (peak height >4, comprising about 24 600 samples), stable (2< peak height <4, comprising about 29 800 samples) and weak (peak height <2, comprising about 5600 samples). The results obtained for a smoothing window of 90 bp are reported in Fig. 2, where the corresponding overall profile from Fig. 1A is also shown. Data displayed in Fig. 2 state a clear direct relationship between the helical rise peak height and nucleosome occupancy; therefore, our method can be considered to unambiguously assess nucleosome occupancy in a quantitative manner. Furthermore, once again the peaks neighbouring the central maximum exhibit a lower height, except for those marked as weak and represented by a blue solid line. A statistical test (Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney) was performed between the distribution of helical rise at dyad positions and the distribution of the helical rise at random positions. A P-value smaller than E-16 assures us that the helical rise is not randomly distributed with respect to nucleosome maps. Peak height analysis of nucleosome positions.

Helical rise profiles of promotersThe above-mentioned features should reflect the general organization of yeast nucleosomes covering transcribed genes. Figure 3 presents the helical rise profiles of YAL053W, an RNA-polymerase II transcribed gene lying on chromosome 1 whose mapped nucleosome positions are reported in the additional data file 1.14 In panel A, the helical rise profile of YAL053W smoothed at 90 bp, is shown as a solid black line. Nucleosome positions and peak heights are reported as horizontal bars on the bottom and the top of the figure, respectively. Near the TSS and the transcription termination site (TTS), marked by a green and a red dot, respectively, the rise values reach ~3.05 Å, while in the regions where the most stable nucleosomes named +2, +3, +4 etc. are located, the rise values exceed 3.25 Å. The difference of ~0.2 Å between the helical rise values of NFRs and those of stable nucleosomes may appear a modest amount, but it must be remembered that the main force involved is of electrostatic nature26 and follows Coulomb's law, which establishes that the attraction between two charges is proportional to the inverse square of the distance. In addition, the damping down of the attraction depends on the dielectric constant of the medium as well, and free DNA and histone proteins share a hydration shell with a value of dielectric constant equal to 80 due to water. When nucleosomes are formed, the hydration shell gets partially lost and the value of the dielectric constant, although not easy to calculate, is considerably reduced, with a consequent increase in coulombic attraction. The balance between the distance of charges and the stiffness of the hydration shell is likely to be involved in nucleosome formation and mobility. Moreover, it is a known fact that the DNA double helix, when wrapping around a histone in a counterclockwise sense, unwinds and gets stretched,27 with a consequent variation in the distance between charged phosphate groups along the DNA. In our opinion, the observed preference for higher helical rise values in nucleosome formation is correlated to the lower energetic cost required to stretch DNA in order to form stable interactions between negative DNA phosphates and positive histone groups. In other words, DNA wrapped around a histone protein is constrained and the release of the constraint is better achieved when the mean helical rise is >3.2 Å. In panel A of fig. 3A, the positions of isw2 nucleosomes are marked by blue horizontal bars. R emodeling of nucleosomes is manifest near NFRs, as well as in regions where the helical rise profile exhibits lower values. This feature is highlighted by the pink profile as well, that shows the occupancy level of YAL053W calculated according to the dinucleotide frequency method by Segal et al.9 The black and pink profiles share a few similarities either in the regions from position +2 to +7, where a high value of nucleosome occupancy and of helical rise are found, and in the regions surrounding NFRs like TSS and TTS where to low occupancy values high helical rise ones correspond. At positions +8 and +11 a different shape of the helical rise profiles can be observed, characterized by a dyad position at the minimum values of a ‘V’-shaped curve instead of the more usual maximum values of a ‘peak’-shaped curve. A logical inference is that the central peaks reported in Figs. 1 and 2 are averaged by the sum of both types of helical rise profiles, ‘peak’- and ‘V’-shaped, so that the average central peaks are always symmetrical but their maximum values are somehow lowered by the contribution from the ‘V’-shaped profile. It must be considered that the major contribution to the mean helical rise profile is due to the peak-shaped curves. Helical rise profiles of nucleosome positions at promoters.

Colour figures can be found in the online version of this paper.The similarities observed, in Fig. 3, between our curves and those by Segal et al. can be explained, considering that nucleosome formation depends on a first step characterized by the bending of DNA and correlated to the dinucleotide distribution, as demonstrated by Segal et al.9 The following step is associated with the stability of bonds formed between DNA and histone proteins, and the second stage is correlated to DNA helical rise.22We analysed the helical rise profiles of all transcribed genes in yeast in order to compare their average peak heights with those reported in Fig. 1A for the reference data set. In Fig. 3B, the helix rise profile of YAL053W, smoothed at 90 bp, is marked by a black solid line. In the same figure, average profiles for nucleosomes characterized by the same position number are shown. Black horizontal bars mark the nucleosome numbers, whereas red horizontal bars show the average peak height calculated for all the nucleosomes having the same number. It can be seen that the average peak height of the +1 nucleosome is larger (4.3 arbitrary units) than the heights of the following ones, in agreement with the barrier model.15In Fig. 3, average helical rise profiles for nucleosomes sharing the same position number are marked by solid red lines. As apparent from the graph, average helical rise profiles for nucleosomes at positions 0 and +1 are characterized by the lowest values. Statistical tests (non-parametric Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney) were performed in order to asses the difference between +1 and +2 (and +3, +4, …, +7) rise value distribution (dyad rise values mediated on a window of 90 bp). P-values smaller than E-16 were computed, assessing that the distributions do no't belong to the same population, strongly rejecting the null hypothesis. It has recently been reported16,17 that, in nucleosomes assembled in vitro, the usual barrier-model pattern, with the +1 nucleosome being the most stable, is not seen. This result supports our idea that the obtained helical rise profiles are mainly correlated to the DNA sequence and can mirror in vitro occupancy. In Fig. 3C, average helical rise profiles for nucleosomes sharing the same position number (solid red line in Fig. 3B) are shown on a magnified scale and marked by a solid black line. The presence of a barrier beginning at position +2 is now clearer. Note here that the number of nucleosomes used to get the average profiles varies from 7497 (for position +1) to ~1000 (for position +15), reaching the final value of ~48 000 positioned nucleosomes instead of the 61 110 reported in the additional data file 114 and used to construct Figs 1 and 2. About half of the 7497 nucleosomes at position +1 reside on opposite strands (3758 on the Watson and 3739 on the Crick strand) and this trend is fulfilled by the following nucleosomes (at increasing position numbers) as well. As a consequence, the global nucleosome pattern must be represented as due to the presence of a mirror image of the original black profiles, as shown in Fig. 3C (pink solid line). Here the blue diamonds represent the average between peak heights belonging to black and pink profiles. The mean helical rise of the blue diamonds ranging from position +2 to position +12 shows an almost constant value of 3.175 Å, similar to the mean rise of the central peak shown in Fig. 1 (black continuous line with a smoothing window of 90 bp). The mean helical rise of the blue diamonds derived from positions 0, +1, +14 and +13 shows a value of about 3.168 Å similar to the peaks neighbouring the central one in Fig. 1. The adoption of the mirror image in Fig. 3C allowed us to interpret the shape of Fig. 1 mainly due to the contribution of the peaks that constitute the dynamic barrier as shown in Fig. 3C.3.4. Helical rise profiles of additional genomesFigure 4 presents the helical rise profiles derived from experimentally mapped nucleosome positions in D. melanogaster,28P. falciparum29 and in chromosome 20 of human genome.25 All the curves were obtained with smoothing windows of 56 bp in order to assess the presence of peaks split in two adjacent maxima as previously observed in yeast. This pattern is not evident in the helical rise profiles shown in Fig. 4, and only in the case of D. melanogaster (Fig. 4A) the presence of three peaks around the central zone of the reference dyad position may be related to the action of remodelling enzymes as previously shown and discussed in Fig. 1 in the case of yeast. The nucleosome positions mapped in yeast have been derived by six different experimental data sets and the best accuracy20 of tiled microarrays covering the entire yeast genome was extended up to a 5-bp spacing. Only one data set of nucleosome positions is still available for D. melanogaster, P. falciparum and Homo sapiens while the spacing of their tiled microarrays comprises 36, 36 and 25 bp, respectively, therefore the results shown in Fig. 4 must be considered as preliminary ones. A general conclusion is evident from the analysis of the three genomes, i.e. the preferential nucleosome occupancy occurs where the mean helical rise reaches its largest values. Probably the different shape of the three curves reflects the different organization of nucleosome near the +1 position at promoters. In yeast, the +1 nucleosome is usually found at +75 bp from TSS and in D. melanogaster this position is shifted at +135.28 In Plasmodium, near promoters are present NFRr that are devoid of nucleosomes;29 in human expressed and inexpressed genes exhibit differential positioning of nucleosome +1.24 Figure 4D shows the helical rise profiles derived by nucleosome positions in chromosome 20 of the human genome computationally mapped from the DNA sequence. Dyad positions were elaborated by Liu et al.25 either from their curvature profile method or from curves obtained according the dinucleotide frequency method of Segal et al.9 A comparison of the helical rise profile reported in Fig. 4C for the experimentally determined dyad positions of human chromosome 20 with the two computationally derived curves of Fig. 4D shows that the predictive power of the curvature profile method (black continuous line) is higher than that attainable with the dinucleotide frequency method (grey continuous line) although for the curve obtained with the curvature profile a remarkable shift of ~40 bp in the position of the central peak is observed. We are not able at the moment to explain the reason for this shift. Helical rise profiles of nucleosome positions of various genomes.

Helical rise and GC contentThe GC content of DNA sequences was found to be correlated to the intrinsic nucleosome occupancy in yeast and in Caenorhabditis elegans,30 and a high GC content was found at human regulator sequences enriched in well-positioned nucleosomes.31 Chen et al.32 reported that in C. elegans, the nucleosome-enriched regions are GC-rich when compared with the nucleosome-free sequences and, recently, the GC content has played an important role in the determinants of nucleosome organization in human cells.33 We have reanalysed the helical rise values of the 136 possible tetranucleotides reported in our previous study22 and in Fig. 5 we plot the distributions of their values as a function of the five different GC contents. At 100 and 0% GC, the distribution of the helical rise is represented with only 10 samples, the profiles are almost flat and the mean helical rises are similar, 3.13 and 3.12 Å, respectively. The profiles of the 25, 50 and 75% GC show that the mean helical rise increases with the increasing of the GC content ranging from 3.07 to 3.3 Å. The correspondence of high helical rise and GC-rich sequences may constitute a very simple explanation of why our helical rise profiles resemble maps of nucleosome occupancy currently reported in the literature and why nucleosomes are mainly found at positions where helical rise reaches its largest averaged values. Helical rise and GC content. The helical rise values of the 136 unique tetranucleotides are shown divided according to their GC content.Helical rise and GC content. The helical rise values of the 136 unique tetranucleotides are shown divided according to their GC content.4. ConclusionsWe used genomic maps of yeast nucleosome positions as primary standards to study the role of DNA helical rise in chromatin organization. Preferential positions for nucleosomes were found where the mean helical rise reaches its largest values at GC-rich DNA sequences. This result was confirmed by a preliminary survey of genomic maps of positioned nucleosomes of the D. melanogaster and P. falciparum genomes and of the human chromosome 20. We suggest that, in order to relieve the constraint imposed by the bending of the double helix, DNA regions characterized by high helical rise values are favoured when compared with shorter ones, i.e. the former do not need further stretch in order to reach their interaction points and, therefore, the stability of nucleosomes is directly correlated to the mean value of helical rise. In a previous paper,22 we reported a correlation between the stability of nucleosomes and the presence of a symmetrical distribution of distances from the nucleosomal dyad axis at specific points. The same feature is now observed in yeast helical rise profiles as a series of ‘peak’- and ‘V’-shaped curves. The difference between the two shapes resides in the lower stability of the ‘V’-shaped profiles, due to their lower helical rise values. In descending order of preference in nucleosome formation, DNA sequences characterized by the smaller helical rise values (i.e. TSS) are placed last.Preferential nucleosome occupancy was found downstream of NFRs, as observed in the barrier nucleosome model15 for statistical positioning of nucleosomes in yeast.Authors’ contributionsF.P. and D.S. equally contributed to the project, both in terms of computational analysis and drafting of the manuscript.

In particular, thylakoid membranes of both cyanobacteria and chloroplasts are composed of galactolipids, of which monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) is the most abundant, although MGDG biosynthetic pathways are different in these organisms. Comprehensive phylogenetic analysis revealed that MGDG synthase (MGD) homologs of filamentous anoxygenic phototrophs Chloroflexi have a close relationship with MGDs of Viridiplantae (green algae and land plants). Furthermore, analyses for the sugar specificity and anomeric configuration of the sugar head groups revealed that one of the MGD homologs exhibited a true MGDG synthetic activity. We therefore presumed that higher plant MGDs are derived from this ancestral type of MGD genes, and genes involved in membrane biogenesis and photosystems have been already functionally associated at least at the time of Chloroflexi divergence. As MGD gene duplication is an important event during plastid evolution, we also estimated the divergence time of type A and B MGDs. Our analysis indicated that these genes diverged ~323 million years ago, when Spermatophyta (seed plants) were appearing. Galactolipid synthesis is required to produce photosynthetic membranes; based on MGD gene sequences and activities, we have proposed a novel evolutionary model that has increased our understanding of photosynthesis evolution.1. IntroductionIt is generally accepted that chloroplasts evolved from a photosynthetic prokaryote that entered into an endosymbiotic relationship with a non-photosynthetic host cell.1 It is also accepted that this photosynthetic prokaryote was an ancestor of the phylum Cyanobacteria.2 It is plausible, therefore, that most of the genes encoding chloroplast-localized proteins, including components of the photosynthetic machinery, are derived from this ancestral cyanobacterium.3 Cyanobacteria and chloroplasts of higher plants share common features in many biological contexts, including photosynthesis and cell division.4,5 In addition, the lipid compositions of biological membranes (photosynthetic membranes in particular) show high degrees of similarity between cyanobacteria and chloroplasts.6 Thylakoid membranes within a chloroplast are ~80% galactolipids, whereas the biological membranes of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells are generally composed of phospholipids. Monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) is the most abundant lipid in thylakoid membranes of both cyanobacteria and higher plants. Thus, it is likely that genes encoding enzymes of the galactolipid synthetic pathways were acquired in higher plants through the endosymbiotic event.MGDG is essential for oxygenic phototrophs. Crystal structure analyses of cyanobacteria have revealed that MGDG binds to photosystem complexes, suggesting that MGDG is an important component of the photosynthetic machinery.7,8 Furthermore, in MGDG-deficient Arabidopsis thaliana, photosynthetic activity is completely absent, and development is arrested at the early seedling stage.9 Thus, MGDG is involved in both photosynthesis and chloroplast development.The pathways for MGDG synthesis in cyanobacteria and higher plants, however, are quite different.10 Higher plants utilize uridine diphosphate galactose (UDP-Gal) and diacylglycerol (DAG) to synthesize MGDG. In contrast, cyanobacteria must first synthesize monoglucosyl-DAG (MGlcDG) using UDP glucose (UDP-Glc) and DAG, which is subsequently epimerized to produce MGDG. In addition, sequence comparison indicates that MGDG synthase (MGD) genes belong to the glycosyltransferase 28 (GT28) family, whereas MGlcDG synthase (MGlcD) genes belong to the family GT2 [according to the Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes database (www.cazy.org)].11–13 In Viridiplantae (green algae and land plants), therefore, the precise origin of the pathway for MGDG synthesis is not clear.As MGDG is essential for photosynthesis, understanding the evolution of this pathway could potentially reveal important details concerning phototroph evolution in general. MGDG is found in some anoxygenic phototrophs as well as oxygenic phototrophs.14 Chloroflexi is an anoxygenic phototrophic group of bacteria whose divergence preceded that of Cyanobacteria.15–17 The MGD homolog of Chloroflexus aurantiacus, a member of the phylum Chloroflexi,18 belongs to the GT28 family and one of the encoded proteins has an MGDG producing activity.19 However, the phylogenetic relationship between these prokaryotic MGD homologs and higher plant MGDs has not been well established. Here, we performed comprehensive phylogenetic analyses on MGD homologs from both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms and revealed that eukaryotic MGDs including Viridiplantae, Rhodophyta, and Heterokontophyta are monophyly and probably have a single ancestor. Moreover, we found that some of Chloroflexi MGD homologs are highly associated with the eukaryotic MGDs. Analyses of the sugar specificity and anomeric configuration of the sugar head groups for three MGD homologs in Chloroflexi, Roseiflexus castenholzii,20 revealed that only one of the MGD homologs in R. castenholzii exhibits a genuine MGD activity, suggesting a possible origin of higher plant MGDs.To understand plastid evolution, it is also important to characterize MGD gene duplication. In A. thaliana, there are two types of MGD enzymes, type A (MGD1) and type B (MGD2 and MGD3).21 Type A MGDs reside in membranes of the inner envelope and, under normal circumstances, generate most MGDGs found in the chloroplast. In contrast, type B MGDs are found in membranes of the outer envelope and are involved in membrane remodeling under phosphate-starved conditions.22 MGDG synthesized in this context is converted into digalactosyl-DAG, which is used to generate cell membranes when phospholipids are not available. As type B MGDs are only found in angiosperms, this type of membrane lipid remodeling is an important characteristic of angiosperms.23–26 Under normal growth conditions, interestingly, the expression of type B MGD are low in leaves but high in floral organs.27 Thus, it is possible that the emergence of type B MGDs was an important step toward Angiospermae (angiosperm) or Spermatophyta (seed plant) evolution. Two types of MGDs are essential for plants to survive under low-phosphate conditions, and yet a detailed analysis of MGD gene divergence has not been reported. In this study, we present detailed data concerning MGD gene divergence. Our data provide a new insight into the plastid evolution based on the biogenesis of photosynthetic membranes.2. Materials and methods2.1. Phylogenetic analysesTo obtain MGD gene sequences, blastp and tblastn searches were performed against the Protein (nr), GenBank, and EST databases at the National Center for Biotechnology Information website (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), using Arabidopsis MGD amino acid sequences as queries. In addition, a blastp search was conducted against genomic data at the Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (DOE-JGI) website (www.jgi.doe.gov/). The resulting data are listed in Supplementary Table S1.MGD amino acid sequences were aligned using MACSIMS28 and MUSCLE,29 followed by a partial manual correction. To refine these data for phylogenetic analysis, the 5'- and 3'-terminal regions of MGD gene and regions where >15% of the species had a sequence gap were eliminated from the alignment. The refined data were then subjected to phylogenetic analyses with Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood (ML). MrBayes ver 3.1.230 was used for Bayesian inference under the WAG + G4 model. Two runs with four chains of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) iterations were performed for 4 000 000 generations. Trees were sampled every 100 generations, and the first 10 000 trees (1 000 000 generations) were discarded as burn-in. Treefinder ver. October 200831 was used for ML analyses under the WAG-F + G8 model. Approximate bootstrap supports (LR-ELW; expected likelihood weights by the local rearrangement) were calculated with 10 000 replicates. RAxML ver. 7.0.432 was also used for ML analyses under the WAG-F + G4 model with 1000 bootstrap replications.To calculate the divergence time of type A and type B MGDs, the nucleotide sequences of land plant MGDs (the first and second codon positions) were subjected to Bayesian and ML phylogenetic analyses. Sequence data are listed in Supplementary Table S2. MrBayes ver 3.1.2 was used for Bayesian-tree inference with 1 000 000 generations under the GTR + G8 model. Trees were sampled every 100 generations, and the first 2500 trees (250 000 generations) were discarded as burn-in. The ML tree was estimated using RAxML ver. 7.0.4 under the GTR + G4 model with 1000 bootstrap replications. In both phylogenetic analyses, different model parameters were estimated between the first and the second codon position data. Divergence times were estimated based on the first and second codon sequences under a relaxed clock model using the MCMCTREE program in the PAML4 package.33 The model parameters were separately estimated between the first and the second codon sequences under the HKY + G5 model. The number of MCMC samples and burn-in were set to 10 000 and 2500, respectively. The following constraints were used for time calibrations (similar to Yoon et al.34): (i) divergence of vascular plants from other land plants <432 million years ago (MYA) (Kenrick and Crane35 provided the origin of land plants), (ii) divergence of seed plants from other vascular plants >355 MYA (Gillespie et al.36 provided the oldest known seeds), (iii) 290–320 MYA for the Angiospermae–Gymnospermae split, and (iv) 90–130 MYA for the Monocotyledoneae–Dicotyledoneae split.372.2. Expression of MGD homologsThe genes of three MGD homologs from R. castenholzii were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into the pET28a vector, respectively. Vectors were transformed into BL21 (DE3) competent Escherichia coli. Transformed cells were grown in Luria–Bertani medium at 37°C until they reached an OD600 reading of 0.7. Protein expression was induced using 1 mM isopropyl ß-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h [we designated three genes as MGD of R. castenholzii (RcMGD), MGlcD of R. castenholzii (RcMGlcD), and diglucosyl-DAG (DGlcDG) synthase of R. castenholzii (RcDGlcD) according to their functions determined].2.3. Assay for glycolipid synthesisGlycolipid synthetic activity was assayed as described by Awai et al.13 Radiolabeled lipids were separated by one-dimensional thin-layer chromatography (TLC) in chloroform–hexane–isopropanol–tetrahydrofuran–water (50:100:80:1:2, by volume) or hexane–tetrahydrofuran–isopropanol–water (40:0.4:50:10, by volume) and detected by Image Analyzer (STORM860, Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA, USA, or BAS2000, FUJIX).2.4. Isolation of glycolipidsCultures of E. coli expressing RcMGD, RcMGlcD, or RcDGlcD were centrifuged at 3500g for 10 min at 4°C. Pellets were homogenized in 5 ml of 50 mM TES-KOH buffer (pH 7.0) and 125 µl of 1 M MgCl2. The enzyme solutions were sonicated and mixed with 115 µl of 30 mM UDP-Gal or UDP-Glc. These mixtures were incubated at 37°C for 3 h and total lipids were extracted as described previously.38 Total lipids were then purified by column chromatography (InterSep SI, GL Sciences). Elution solvents included chloroform, acetone–isopropanol (9:1, by volume), and methanol. Glycolipids were collected in the acetone–toluene fraction and then isolated by one-dimensional TLC as above or using hexane–tetrahydrofuran–isopropanol–water (40:0.4:50:10, by volume). Finally, glycolipids were eluted using chloroform–methanol (2:1, by volume).Roseiflexus castenholzii provided from Prof. Keizo Shimada was grown as described by Yamada et al.39 Roseiflexus total lipid was also extracted as described above.38 This lipid was developed by two-dimensional TLC using chloroform–methanol–7 N ammonium hydroxide (120:80:8, by volume) in the first dimension and chloroform–methanol–acetic acid–water (170:20:15:3, by volume) in the second.2.5. Acetylation of glycolipidsThe glycolipids isolated by one-dimensional TLC were evaporated and then eluted using 0.5 ml of pyridine and 0.25 ml of acetic acid anhydride. These mixtures were incubated overnight in the dark. Subsequently, 5 ml of toluene was added to these mixtures and evaporated. This step was repeated three times. Finally, acetylated lipids were dissolved in chloroform and used for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).2.6. Structural analysis of glycolipids by NMRAcetylated lipids were dissolved in CDCl3. These structures were analyzed by 1H-NMR at 600 MHz (Bruker AV-600), 400 MHz (Varian 400-MR), or 270 MHz (JEOL JNM-EX-270) for protons. Internal tetramethylsilane [s 0 parts per million (ppm)] in CDCl3 was used as the standard. Chemical shifts were expressed in ppm with reference to the standard. The multiplicity of signals was abbreviated as follows: s, singlet; d, doublet; dd, doublet of doublets; t, triplet; and m, multiplet. The protons of the sugar head groups were denoted as H-1, H-1', H-2, H-2', H-3, H-3', H-4, H-4', H-5, H-5', H-6a, H-6'a, H-6b, and H-6'b.

Results and discussion3.1. Evolutionary relationship of MGD homologsTo comprehensively understand the relationships among MGD homologs, we compared amino acid sequences of 56 MGD homologs from prokaryotes and phototrophic eukaryotes. The homologs similarly located were excluded from the phylogenetic tree. A complete list of these proteins is shown in Supplementary Table S1. Our phylogenetic analyses identified monophyletic clades of Viridiplantae, Rhodophyta (red algae), and Heterokontophyta (heterokonts), which were clearly supported by both Bayesian inference (MrBayes) and ML analyses (Treefinder and RAxML; node A in Fig. 1). Our data provide compelling evidence that a single origin of MGD in a common ancestor of these groups and the pathway for MGDG synthesis is monophyletic among Viridiplantae, Rhodophyta, and Heterokontophyta. As indicated above, MGDs from Heterokontophyta formed a single group, suggesting that the common ancestor of Heterokontophyta acquired MGDs (node B in Fig. 1). This grouping was strongly supported by MrBayes, Treefinder, and RAxML. Notably, Rhodophyta and Heterokontophyta formed a single group (node C in Fig. 1). Recent phylogenetic analyses of plastid proteins have revealed an extremely close relationship between heterokontophytes and rhodophytes. These data suggest that heterokont plastids originated from endosymbiosis with Rhodophyta.40,41 MGDs of heterokonts were likely acquired from Rhodophyta through this endosymbiotic event.

Our phylogenetic analysis of MGDs, however, indicated that this gene formed a clade with different MGD homologs in green non-sulfur bacteria (C. aurantiacus and Chloroflexus aggregans42) (node D in Fig. 1). Since chloroplasts may be derived from ancient types of cyanobacteria, it was expected that the eukaryote MGDs may be directly evolved from a cyanobacterial MGD origin that might be acquired by the primary endosymbiotic event, although it might be lost in most cyanobacterial species. However, here, the grouping between the Gloeobacter and Chloroflexi MGD homologs was robustly supported by MrBayes, Treefinder, and RAxML (node D in Fig. 1). This result strongly suggests that the G. violaceus MGD homolog is not the origin of MGDs in Viridiplantae and that horizontal gene transfer may have occurred much more recently between Gloeobacter and Chloroflexi.However, notably, other MGD homologs of Chloroflexi strains, Chloroflexus and Roseiflexus, were located closest to the clade of chloroplasts (node E in Fig. 1). Chloroflexus au. 1, an MGD of C. aurantiacus, belongs to the GT28 family and the encoded protein has an MGDG synthetic activity.19 In addition, R. castenholzii has three MGD homologs that we have named RcMGD, RcMGlcD, and RcDGlcD according to their functions determined (see below). These genes also belong to the GT28 family, and RcMGD and RcMGlcD form a clade with Chloroflexus au. 1. Although MGD homologs from Chloroflexi and chloroplasts were closely related phylogenetically, information regarding substrate specificity was only available for Chloroflexus au. 1. We have therefore examined in more detail the enzymatic properties of Chloroflexi MGD homologs.3.2. Glycolipid synthetic activities of R. castenholzii MGD homologsTo characterize the glycolipid synthetic activities of the three R. castenholzii MGD homologs, we expressed these recombinant proteins in E. coli. When radiolabeled UDP-Gal was used as a substrate, RcMGD was capable of synthesizing a radiolabeled lipid (Fig. 2). We used UDP-Gal as a substrate because the proposed pathway for MGDG synthesis of higher plants utilizes UDP-Gal. Cucumber (Cucumis sativus) MGD1 (CsMGD) was used as a positive control for MGDG synthesis in this experiment. In contrast, RcMGD extract did not contain a radiolabeled product, when UDP-Glc was provided as a substrate, suggesting that lipid synthesis via RcMGD was UDP-Gal-dependent. On the other hand, the enzyme encoded by RcMGlcD synthesized MGlcDG when UDP-Glc was provided as a substrate. The MGlcD of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (Sll1377) was used as a positive control for MGlcDG synthesis in this experiment. Analysis of sugar transferase activity. Radiolabeled UDP-Gal (+Gal) or UDP-Glc (+Glc) were used as substrates. The resulting lipids were separated by TLC (chloroform-hexane-tetrahydrofuran-isopropanol-water, 50:100:1:80:2 by volume) and visualized by autoradiography. CsMGD and Sll1377 (pET24b and pQE-32) were used as controls for MGDG and MGlcDG, respectively.Analysis of sugar transferase activity. Radiolabeled UDP-Gal (+Gal) or UDP-Glc (+Glc) were used as substrates. The resulting lipids were separated by TLC (chloroform-hexane-tetrahydrofuran-isopropanol-water, 50:100:1:80:2 by volume) and visualized by autoradiography. CsMGD and Sll1377 (pET24b and pQE-32) were used as controls for MGDG and MGlcDG, respectively.Using TLC, lipids from two samples (RcMGD/UDP-Gal and RcMGlcD/UDP-Glc) were purified and subjected to 1H-NMR analysis to reveal the sugar head groups of these lipids (Fig. 3). In Figs 3A and B, the doublet peak indicated by the black arrow at 4.5–4.6 ppm indicates H1 of the hexose moiety of the lipid. These peaks demonstrated that the sugar head group was bound to a glycerol backbone via a ß-anomeric configuration at the C3 position, an MGDG structure that is characteristic of land plants.14 Consequently, the clade in Fig. 1, which includes Chloroflexus and Roseiflexus, represents green non-sulfur bacterial MGDs. The present results indicate that MGD genes occur at least at the time of Chloroflexi divergence (an ancient bacterial lineage). Botté et al.43 has independently performed phylogenetic analysis of MGDs. Although they indicated similar results for phylogeny of MGDs, they have not included prokaryotic MGD homologs except for Chloroflexi in their phylogenetic analysis, and thus, the phylogenetic relationship between eukaryotic and prokaryotic MGD homologs remains uncertain. Our detailed analyses suggest that this ancestral type of MGD genes is the origin of higher plant MGDs. Analysis of glycolipids by 1H-NMR. Each glycolipid synthesized by RcMGD and RcMGlcD was analyzed by 1H-NMR at 600 MHz. (A) MGDG synthesized by RcMGD expression and (B) MGlcDG synthesized by RcMGlcD expression were isolated from E. coli.

H-1 doublet peaks (arrows) indicate that these glycolipids formed ß-anomeric configurations to the glycerol backbone.RcDGlcD synthesized a glycolipid that consisted of a number of sugars, using UDP-Glc as a substrate (Fig. 2). The crude lipid extract from E. coli overexpressing RcDGlcD contained much phospholipids derived from E. coli. To remove phospholipids and concentrate glycolipids, the extract was purified by silica column chromatography. The separated fractions were further developed by TLC and stained using the anthrone reagent (Fig. 4A). The lipid mobility was associated with DGlcDG.19 1H-NMR analysis identified this lipid as DGlcDG. The analysis showed two doublet peaks H1 and H'1 (4.4–4.6 ppm) indicating two hexose moieties in the lipid (Fig. 4B). The spectrum including these peaks revealed that this lipid contained two glucoses and these glucoses were bound to each other via a ß-anomeric configuration. Furthermore, one of these glucoses was also bound to a glycerol backbone via a ß-anomeric configuration. MGD gene homologs share a high degree of sequence similarity, yet sugar-donor specificity and the number of molecules involved in the reaction are clearly diverse. Detailed comparisons of MGD homolog sequences could potentially reveal novel protein domains that determine sugar-donor specificity. Analysis of glycolipids synthesized by RcDGlcD. Glycolipids synthesized by RcDGlcD were analyzed by TLC (A) and 1H-NMR at 400 MHz (B). (A) RcDGlcD was incubated with UDP-Glc and DAG (+sub), or without substrate (-sub).

Glycolipids were detected by the anthrone reagent (MGDG, DGDG, and the lipid indicated by an arrow). (B) 1H-NMR lipid analysis resulted in doublet H-1 peaks (arrows), indicating ß-anomeric configurations.Analysis of glycolipids synthesized by RcDGlcD.

Subsequently, to define whether R. castenholzii possesses MGDG, MGlcDG, and DGlcDG or not, we analyzed the lipid composition of R. castenholzii. Total lipid was extracted and developed by two-dimensional TLC, and three glycolipids were detected by the anthrone reagent (Fig. 5A). We compared the mobility on two-dimensional TLC between A. thaliana and R. castenholzii (Supplementary Fig. S4). The mobility of a Roseiflexus glycolipid was very similar to Arabidopsis MGDG. Using 1H-NMR, we confirmed that this glycolipid was a galactolipid and formed a ß-anomeric configuration to the glycerol backbone (Fig. 5B). From these results, we concluded that this glycolipid is MGDG. Although the peak pattern derived from the glycerol backbone was slightly different from MGDG synthesized by RcMGD in E. coli, it is probably due to the difference in fatty acid composition of these MGDGs (Supplementary Table S3). This result strongly supports that RcMGD actually functions in vivo to synthesize MGDG. Analysis of MGDG isolated from R. castenholzii. (A) Description of 2-dimensional TLC in R. castenholzii. The TLC analysis was performed with chloroform-methanol- 7 N ammonium hydroxide (120:80:8, by volume) in the first dimension and chloroform-methanol-acetic acid-water (170:20:15:3, by volume) in the second.

The MGDG formed a ß-anomeric configuration to the glycerol backbone.As indicated above, we also detected two other glycolipids on two-dimensional TLC. One of them was assumed to be sulfoquinovosyl-DAG (SQDG) from the mobility on TLC. In fact, there is a homolog of Arabidopsis SQDG synthase 1 in Roseiflexus and the presence of SQDG in C. aurantiacus was reported in a previous paper.44 On the other hand, in another one (UL4, unknown lipid 4, in Fig. 5A), the corresponding lipid was not existent in A. thaliana. This glycolipid was likely DGlcDG. However, 1H-NMR analysis revealed that this lipid was not DGlcDG, although it consisted of at least two sugar head groups (data not shown). We could not detect MGlcDG in total lipid fraction from Roseiflexus. In Cyanobacteria, MGlcDG is a minor lipid, less than 1% of total lipid.10 Similarly, MGlcDG may not be abundant in Roseiflexus. Therefore, these results suggest that RcDGlcD mainly incorporates glucose to a major monoglycolipid MGDG, not MGlcDG in vivo.To confirm the glucose transfer activity of RcDGlcD, we used MGDG and MGlcDG as sugar acceptors and compared the diglycolipid producing activity (Fig. 6). Obviously, RcDGlcD could transfer glucose to MGDG, although DGlcDG is still produced by it's processive activity. When MGlcDG was used as a substrate, the band corresponding to DGlcDG was increased, confirming that RcDGlcD could also transfer glucose to MGlcDG. However, UL4 was not DGlcDG and MGDG is one of the most abundant lipids in Roseiflexus (Supplementary Table S3). Consequently, we presume that the main sugar acceptor of RcDGlcD in vivo is MGDG and UL4 is glycosylgalactosyl-DAG. However, since we only utilized UDP-Gal and UDP-Glc as in vitro substrates (Fig. 2), its true substrate is still uncertain, and further experiments are needed to determine the structure of UL4. Analysis of sugar transferase activity of RcDGlcD. Radiolabeled UDP-Gal (+Gal) or UDP-Glc (+Glc) were used as substrates. Additionally, MGDG or MGlcDG eluted in EtOH were added as acceptors. The resulting lipids were separated by TLC (hexane-tetrahydrofuran-isopropanol-water, 40:0.4:50:10, by volume) and visualized by autoradiography. CsMGD was used as controls for MGDG.

GlcGalDG, glucosylgalactosyldiacylglycerol.Thylakoid membranes or membranous structures of anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria involve complexes composed of proteins, pigments, and lipids. In particular, these types of membranes are characterized by a unique and conserved lipid composition. Genes related to the photosynthetic membrane biogenesis, therefore, have also played an important role in phototroph evolution. Recently, we reported that a distinct type of MGD belonging to the GT1 family was found in the green sulfur bacterium Chlorobacterium tepidum and proved to be involved in chlorosome biogenesis.45 This work also demonstrated that MGDG is commonly important in both anoxygenic and oxygenic photosynthetic organisms, although green sulfur and non-sulfur bacteria have independently acquired different types of MGDG synthetic machineries. Given the conservation of MGD gene families and the presence of MGDG in Chloroflexi, a functional association between the photosystem and the membrane galactolipid MGDG was established before endosymbiosis event, leading to the establishment of highly organized photosynthetic membranes.Our results suggested that the photosynthetic eukaryote has acquired MGD gene from ancestral Chloroflexi in an early event, even though Cyanobacteria has a different MGDG synthetic pathway. These pathways were subsequently conserved during the course of evolution and have played important roles in chloroplast biology. A recent large-scale phylogenetic analysis also revealed that a considerable amount of non-cyanobacterial genomic material has contributed to the establishment of the plastid before the split of red and green algae.46 Eukaryotic MGD genes may be acquired through this kind of large-scale gene transfer from ancestral Chloroflexi.3.4. The divergence point of type A and type B MGDsDetermining the time at which the two types of MGDs (type A and type B) diverged is important to understand the evolution of photosynthetic membranes in land plants. Using both Bayesian inference and ML methods, we performed phylogenetic analyses on MGD gene sequences of land plants, excluding third codon positions (Supplementary Figs S5 and S6). Results from these analyses generally agreed with accepted phylogenetic relationships of land plants. For example, Angiospermae were clearly divided into Monocotyledoneae (monocots) and Dicotyledoneae (dicots) in both types of MGDs. The groupings received strong support from both Bayesian inference and ML methods (Supplementary Figs S5 and S6). These results indicate that MGDs have been conserved throughout the course of land plant evolution. Importantly, one full-length MGD gene sequence of Picea glauca was available among Gymnospermae, and both Bayesian and ML analyses placed the Picea sequence close to the type B MGD clade. Although a Gymnospermae type A MGD has not yet been identified, this result suggests that the type A/B divergence may have preceded that of Angiospermae and Gymnospermae.Based on the phylogenetic tree, we estimated an MGD type A/B divergence time using four calibration points (similar to Yoon et al.34). Our analysis indicated that MGDs likely diverged ~323 MYA, with 298–357 MYA representing the 95% confidence interval (Fig. 7). This divergence time corresponds to the Carboniferous period, which came after Spermatophyta appeared (355–370 MYA). We propose, therefore, that the acquisition of two types of MGDs occurred in the common ancestor of Spermatophyta. The divergence time of type A and type B MGDs.

DE, Devonian; CA, Carboniferous; PE, Permian; TR, Triassic; JU, Jurassic; CR, Cretaceous; CE, Cenozoic.Our data indicate that MGD gene duplication and subsequent functional differentiation occurred in Spermatophyta (Fig. 8). Jiao et al.47 showed that a whole-genome duplication (WGD) event occurred in the common ancestor of all seed plants. This WGD allowed for major adaptive changes in these organisms and contributed to the dominance of seed plants. Interestingly, type B MGD expression is elevated during the reproduction stage of seed plants.27 During the Carboniferous period, spore-producing plants were dominant,48 whereas this dominance shifted to seed plants shortly thereafter. The Carboniferous and Permian periods were also characterized by dramatic changes to the global climate, primarily drying. Expression of type B MGDs is elevated during phosphate deprivation, a response that is regulated by both auxin and cytokinin.49 These regulatory mechanisms may have worked in response to these climate changes. More extensive research concerning the MGDs of Gymnospermae is required for a thorough understanding of MGD gene evolution. It is important to determine whether there is a species of Gymnospermae that has two types of MGDs. The evolution of Gymnospermae, however, has not been adequately mapped, in part because a complete genome sequence is not available. Determining the divergence time of type A and B MGDs in Gymnospermae may prove critical if we are to understand the divergence of land plants. Proposed model for MGD evolution. The requirement of MGDG in photosynthetic processes was established in ancient times. For MGDs, duplication and functional divergence occurred in Spermatophyta.

ConclusionBased on phylogenetic and enzymatic analyses, we proposed the evolutionary model of MGDs (Fig. 8). Although no cyanobacteria analyzed possessed the ancestral type of higher plant MGDs, we identified the possible MGD ancestor from Chloroflexi. The results suggest that higher plant MGD originated from this type of Chloroflexi MGD. Eukaryotic MGD may be acquired from ancient Chloroflexi via horizontal gene transfer in parallel with the major endosymbiotic event and contributed to the early plastid evolution. After the acquirement, MGD duplication and functional differentiation of two types of MGD, types A and B, occurred along with land plant evolution. This functional differentiation probably had important meanings in further prosperity of seed plants. It is universally accepted that an ancestral cyanobacterium is the origin of the plastid organelle; however, plastid evolution is still heavily debated. These disagreements can be attributed to a very complex process that involved both horizontal and intracellular gene transfer during the course of prokaryotic and eukaryotic evolution.50,51 To generate a more accurate picture of photosynthesis evolution, we believe that focused comprehensive analyses of specific physiological processes are just as important as more global gene sequence comparisons. In particular, galactolipids are highly enriched in photosynthetic membranes, and deciphering the evolution of galactolipid synthetic pathways provides critical information toward understanding the early evolution of photosynthesis.Supplementary DataSupplementary Data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by the Global Center of Excellence Program, from the Earth to ‘Earths’, at the Tokyo Institute of Technology and The University of Tokyo.We would like to thank Dr Robert P.
