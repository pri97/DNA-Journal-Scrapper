Although many studies reported quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping, the genes governing most of its economically important traits are still unknown. In this study, we report QTL mapping for morphological and yield component traits in B. rapa and comparative map alignment between B. rapa, B. napus, B. juncea, and Arabidopsis thaliana to identify candidate genes and conserved QTL blocks between them. A total of 95 QTL were identified in different crucifer blocks of the B. rapa genome. Through synteny analysis with A. thaliana, B. rapa candidate genes and intronic and exonic single nucleotide polymorphisms in the parental lines were detected from whole genome resequenced data, a few of which were validated by mapping them to the QTL regions. Semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR analysis showed differences in the expression levels of a few genes in parental lines. Comparative mapping identified five key major evolutionarily conserved crucifer blocks (R, J, F, E, and W) harbouring QTL for morphological and yield components traits between the A, B, and C subgenomes of B. rapa, B. juncea, and B. napus. The information of the identified candidate genes could be used for breeding B. rapa and other related Brassica species.1. IntroductionBrassica rapa (2n = 20, AA) is an important Brassica species that is grown widely to produce leafy vegetables in Korea, China, and Japan, for vegetable oil in India, China, and Canada, and as a fodder crop in Europe. Chinese cabbage, pak choi, sarson, and turnips are distinct morphotypes of B. rapa belonging to different subspecies that are adapted to different geographical regions and climatic conditions. During the last two decades, studies by different laboratories using diverse germplasm led the development of several molecular markers and genetic linkage maps1,2 besides mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) for erucic acid,3 glucosinolates,4,5 disease resistance,6,7 plant morphology, flowering time, and yield component traits.8,9 Furthermore, comparative mapping between different cultivated Brassica species revealed the structural conservation between the homoeologous chromosomes of the A, B, and C subgenomes that were originally derived from three diploid Brassica species, namely, the Brassica rapa, Brassica nigra (BB, n = 8), and Brassica oleracea (CC, n = 9) genomes, and their polyploid derivatives, i.e. the important oilseed crops Brassica juncea (AABB, n = 18) and Brassica napus (AACC, n = 19), respectively.5,10,11 Furthermore, several comparative mapping studies between Brassica and Arabidopsis thaliana revealed the triplicate nature of the Brassica genome, with an average of three copies of each chromosomal segment of A. thaliana, which resulted from the triplication of the whole Brassica genome at ~11–12 MYA,12 although segmental conservation between Brassica and A. thaliana chromosomes has been observed at the gross level.10,11,13,14Therefore, to decode the whole genome sequences of the complicated Brassica genomes to be used in breeding programmes and to study the divergence of gene function and genome evolution associated with polyploidy and extensive duplications, the ‘Multinational Brassica Genome Sequencing Project Consortium’ was initiated in 2003. The first Brassica genome to be sequenced among the six cultivated Brassica species was the A genome of the B. rapa Chinese cabbage Chiifu-401 cultivar that has a comparatively small genome (529 Mb) among the cultivated Brassica species,15 and the draft genome sequence was published in 2011.16With the availability of recently developed advanced next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology to sequence the whole genome of crop plants in a short time span, the emphasis is being shifted to genomics-assisted breeding from traditional crop breeding using conventional molecular markers. The combined use of QTL mapping, which detects functional loci for traits of interest, and whole genome sequence information to identify candidate genes and their variation between the parental lines of B. rapa will greatly supplement the development of gene-specific molecular markers for breeding this crop with desired plant architecture and quality. Many oleifera and sarson types were exploited for breeding high seed yield component traits in B. rapa, but the vegetable types were not exploited for this purpose. Although several QTL have been mapped for leaf morphology, yield components, and other quality traits, most of the genes underlying trait variation have not been identified.9,17Therefore, in the present study, we used chromosome-specific bacterial artificial chromosome-derived simple sequence repeats (BAC-SSRs) and gene specific markers, e.g. intron polymorphisms (IPs) and expressed sequenced tag-derived SSRs (EST-SSRs) to map QTL governing morphological and yield component traits. Using whole genome next-generation sequence information data of the parental lines in combination with comparative alignment with the A. thaliana genome, potential candidate genes and single nucleotide variations within some of the potential candidate genes were identified. Furthermore, the chromosomal regions of B. rapa containing clusters of QTL were aligned with the QTL regions of B. juncea and B. napus to identify structural and functional conservation between the A, B, and C subgenomes, so that the candidate gene information of B. rapa could be used for breeding these crops.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materials, growth conditions, and trait measurementThe genetic map developed earlier by us2,18 using a CRF2 mapping population that was derived by crossing the diverse parental lines ‘Chiifu 401–42,’ a vegetable-type Chinese cabbage, and ‘rapid cycling B. rapa’ (hereafter referred to as ‘RCBr’), was used for QTL mapping in this study. For phenotypic investigation, 12 F3 plants derived by selfing each of the 190 F2 plants were planted per replication in 3 replications in 2008, 2009, and 2010 from March to July. The seeds were germinated in cell trays in a greenhouse for 1 month. In 2009 and 2010, two sets were grown, one set was vernalized after 20 days of germination for 1 month and the other set was grown without vernalization. All the plants were transplanted to the open field of Chungnam National University, Daejeon, Korea. Fourteen morphological and yield component traits (Table 1) were recorded in the CRF3 mapping population and parental lines. Four plants from the middle of each row from each replication were used for phenotypic data measurement for each family, and the average value of three replications was taken as trait data. Flowering time was the only trait that was recorded in the vernalized plants.

Statistical analysis and QTL mappingThe SAS 9.0 program (SAS institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA) was used for correlation coefficient analysis. The previously described genetic map18 was used for QTL mapping. WinQTL cartographer version 2.519 was used to perform QTL analysis using the composite interval mapping function as described previously.20 Tests for the presence of QTL were performed at 2-cM intervals using a 10-cM window. Significant QTL-defining logarithm of odds (LOD) values were calculated by 1000 permutations for phenotypic traits derived from each year.2.3. Comparative map alignment between the A, B, and C subgenomesTo identify the functionally conserved loci between B. rapa with B. juncea and B. napus for morphological and yield component traits, comparative alignment of QTL maps was performed between these three species. B. juncea contains the A and B subgenomes while B. napus contains the A and C subgenomes. For comparison, the B. juncea QTL map of Ramchiary et al.20 and the B. napus QTL maps of Quijada et al.21 and Udall et al.22 were used. The marker sequences from the respective maps21,22 were downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information and aligned with the A. thaliana genome using BLAST analysis, and crucifer building blocks14 containing important trait QTL were defined. The updated map of B. juncea based on IP markers11 was used to redraw the QTL map of Ramchiary et al.20 For QTL map alignment, the homoeologous A, B, and C subgenome groups of Brassica species defined by Panjabi et al.11 were used.2.4. Whole genome resequencing, identification of SNPs in candidate genes, and semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysisWhole genome resequencing of parental line RCBr was performed using an Illumina GAII next-generation sequencer. Sequence assembly and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) identification were performed in a stepwise manner: (i) the scaffold sequences from each linkage group (LG) of the B. rapa Chiifu 401–42 cultivar genome (http://brassicadb.org/brad/) were used as reference sequence, (ii) Augustus program23 was used to predict candidate genes in QTL regions, (iii) short-read sequences generated from RCBr were aligned to the reference B. rapa genome using Bowtie (http://bowtie.cbcb.umd.edu)24 and mapped onto each reference LG, (iv) alignments from Bowtie were transformed to MAQ25 to produce consensus short-read sequences and identify SNPs.Because we previously demarcated 24 crucifer building blocks in the B. rapa genome by comparing it with A. thaliana,18 we selected already characterized candidate genes from A. thaliana and looked for orthologous genes in the B. rapa genome in those blocks harbouring important trait QTL using a homology search approach and synteny analysis. SNPs were identified between the start and stop codons through comparative alignment between the sequences of the parental lines. Gene-specific primer pairs were designed for SNP validation, with an amplicon size of not more than 300 bp. DNA extraction, PCR using 1 × LC Green Plus (Idaho Technologies), and mapping functions were performed as described previously.18 The PCR conditions were 4 min at 94°C, 45 cycles of 20 s at 94°C, 20 s at 55–60°C, and 20 s at 72°C, with a final extension step of 7 min at 72°C. For the detection of SNPs between the parental lines and the F2 mapping population, we used a Light Scanner System (Idaho Technologies), as described previously.26 RNA was extracted from 20-day-old leaf samples, and semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis was performed following Lee et al.27 using gene-specific primer pairs listed in Supplementary Table S4.3. Results3.1. Variation of phenotypic traits in the parental lines and segregating populationsThe parental line Chiifu is a heading-type Chinese cabbage, whereas RCBr is a short life cycle Brassica plant, also known as the Wisconsin fast plant. The two parental lines showed significant differences for flowering, leaf, siliqua, and seed traits (Table 2). Chiifu showed higher phenotypic values for all the traits studied. The CRF3 population showed transgressive segregation for some of the traits, e.g. plant height in 2008, midrib length and width, siliqua length and width, siliqua beak length, seeds per siliqua, and seed weight. For flowering and bolting time, the transgression phenomenon trend was towards RCBr because Chiifu did not flower until seed harvesting time. As the bolting and flowering time were influenced by temperature and photoperiod, the mean value of flowering time measured in spring (2009 and 2010) was ~30 days shorter than in winter (2008), even when they were grown in a heated greenhouse. The mean values of the F3 lines for the leaf traits and plant height evaluated in spring 2009 and 2010 were also lower than those of the F3 lines grown in 2008. Distribution analysis of the phenotypic values of 14 traits in the mapping population showed a normal distribution for all the traits, suggesting that each trait was governed by many genes. Pearson's correlation coefficient analysis showed moderate to strong positive correlation among leaf traits (LL, LW, MRL, and MRW, correlation coefficient r = 0.53–0.92). Siliqua length, width, and beak length were significantly positively correlated with each other, but seed weight was not correlated with other siliqua traits (Supplementary Table S1). In addition, we found a positive correlation between bolting time, flowering time, and four leaf traits (Supplementary Table S1).

QTL mapping and identification of crucifer building blocks in the B. rapa genomeQTL mapping identified a total of 95 QTL for 14 traits in the CRF3 mapping population. It was observed that almost all the trait-enhancing alleles, except for flowering time, were contributed by the Chiifu parental line. The number of QTL detected ranged from 4 QTL for petiole length, seed number per siliqua and seed weight to 14 QTL for flowering traits, and the confidence interval ranged from 1 to 25 cM (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table S2).

Putative candidate genes identified within the QTL blocks are shown in bold black letters on the left of each LG, and those outside QTL intervals are shown in bold grey letters.A total of seven QTL were detected for plant height, one in each LG, i.e. A2 and A3 (R block), A3 and A5 (J block), A7 (E block), A9 (H block), and A10 (A block). The QTL on A2 (qPH1) and A7 (qPH4) showed higher LOD values and phenotypic explanation and were detected both in 2009 and 2010 (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table S2). The percentage of phenotypic variation explained by individual QTL ranged from 5 to 19%.Five leaf traits, i.e. leaf length and width, midrib length and width, and petiole length, were used for QTL analysis (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table S2). A total of six QTL for leaf length were detected in four LGs. qLL1 and qLL5 in the R blocks of A3 and A10, respectively, were consistently detected in two consecutive years (2008 and 2009). The percentage of phenotypic variation explained by individual QTL ranged from 7 to 49%. For leaf width, 10 QTL were detected, of which qLW1 in the U block of A1, qLW2 in the R block of A2, and qLW3 in the J block of A3 were consistently found in 2008 and 2009 (Supplementary Table S2). A total of 10 QTL were detected for midrib length, of which QTL in the J (qMRL3) and T (qMRL4) blocks of A3 and qMRL6 in the A block of A6 showed comparatively higher LOD values, but none of them were detected consecutively in different years. For midrib width, five QTL were detected, of which QTL in A2 (qMRW2) and A10 (qMRW5) were detected in the R blocks of both LGs. qMRW3 in T/U block of A3 and qMRW4 in E block of A7 were detected both in 2008 and 2009. Four QTL, two on A2 (qPL1 in R block and qPL2 in W block) and one each on LG A6 (qPL3) and A10 (qPL4 in R block) were detected for petiole length. The QTL on qPL3 was major QTL showing the highest LOD value of 11.8. The phenotypic variation explained by individual QTL ranged from 6 to 13%.A total of 10 QTL were detected for bolting time, of which qDB2 in the R block of A2, qDB4 in the J block of A3, qDB7 in the E block of A7, qDB8 in the A block of A8, and qDB10 in the R block of A10 were detected in 2008 and 2009 (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table S2). The QTL on A2, A7, and A10 were major loci, and the percentage of phenotypic variation explained by individual QTL ranged from 4 to 29%.For flowering time in the non-vernalized plants, a total of 12 QTL were identified in 8 LGs (Supplementary Table S2 and Fig. 1). Of these, QTL mapped to the R (qFT2 and qFT3) and W (qFT4) blocks of A2, R block of A3 (qFT5), E block of A7 (qFT10), N block of A9 (qFT13), and R block of A10 (qFT15) were major loci and were detected consecutively for 3 yrs. A total of nine QTL, including two new QTL, i.e. qFT1 in the U block of A1 and qFT13 in the A block of A10, were detected in vernalized population in addition to the already detected QTL in the non-vernalized population (marked by asterisks, Supplementary Table S2 and Fig. 1). qFT2 and qFT3, both on A2, qFT10 on A7, qFT13 on A9, and qFT14 on A10, were major flowering time QTL detected in the vernalized and non-vernalized populations.A total of nine QTL were detected for siliqua length, two QTL on A2 (qSQL1 in the R/W block and qSQL2 in E block), three QTL on A3 (qSQL3 in R block, qSQL4 in J block, and qSQL5 in T/U block), and one each on A7 (qSQL6 in the E block), A8 (qSQL7 in the B block), and A9 (qSQL8 in B block), and A10 (qSQL9 in the W block) (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table S2). qSQL3, qSQL5, and qSQL9 were detected in two consecutive years while qSQL6 on A7 was detected in three consecutive years. The QTL on A3 (qSQL5), A7 (qSQL6), and A10 (qSQL9) were major loci, contributing to phenotypic variation ranging from 7 to 19% in different years.Seven QTL, one each on LGs A1 (qSQW1 in the F block), A2 (qSQW2 in the K Block), A8 (qSQW6 in the C block), and A9 (qSQW7 in the N block) and three on A3 (qSQW3 in the R, qSQW4 in the J, and qSQW5 in the T/U blocks, respectively), were detected for siliqua width. qSQW1 on A1 and qSQW3 and qSQW5 on A3 were major loci that were detected in two consecutive years and explained 3–16% of the phenotypic variation.For siliqua beak length, five QTL were detected, one each on A3 (qSBL1 in the J block), A4 (qSBL2 in the N Block), A5 (qSBL3 in the C block), A7 (qSBL4 in the E block), and A9 (qSBL5 in H block). The QTL on A3 (qSBL1) and A5 (qSBL3) were comparatively major loci with high LOD values and were detected in two different years (2009 and 2010).The seed numbers per siliqua and seed weight are important traits for increasing yield (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table S2). For the number of seeds per siliqua, one QTL each on A2 (qSSQ1 in the R/W block) and A10 (qSSQ4 in the W block) and two QTL on A3 (qSSQ2 in the J block and qSSQ3 in the T block) were detected. Only qSSQ4 on A10 was detected in two years, although the other three QTL also showed significantly high LOD values. For seed weight, one QTL each was detected on A2 (qSW1 in the R block), A3 (qSW2 in the J block), A6 (qSW3 in the X block), and A10 (qSW4 in the R block). Of these, only qSW1 and qSW4 were detected in more than 1 yr (2009 and 2010). The phenotypic variation explained by individual QTL ranged from 6 to 17%.3.3. Identification of potential candidate genes in the QTL blocksAs synteny between our B. rapa map and A. thaliana was established,21 we searched for orthologs of previously characterized A. thaliana genes in the B. rapa genome (Fig. 1 and Table 3). The most important candidate genes, identified in the R blocks of A2, A3, and A10 harbouring the major QTL clusters for flowering and bolting, leaf, and siliqua traits, were orthologous to genes in the gibberellic acid (GA) oxidase 3 (AtGA20OX3),28 cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase 5 (AtCKX5),29,30 flowering locus C (FLC),8,9 GA-stimulated Arabidopsis (GASA4),31 and constans-like (COL) gene families. The Brassica homologs BraFLC and BraGA20OX3 were identified in the R blocks of A2, A3, and A10. However, some paralogs were differentially present on Brassica genomes such as BraCKX5 on A2 and A10, but not on A3, BraGASA4 only on A2 and A3, BraCOL1 on A2 and A10, etc. (Fig. 1). These suggest the preferential retention and fractionation of paralogous genes in duplicated segments of the B. rapa genome. Putative candidate genes identified in the QTL blocks of B. rapa genome and SNPs observed between gene sequences of the parental lines, Chiifu and RCBrPutative candidate genes identified in the QTL blocks of B. rapa genome and SNPs observed between gene sequences of the parental lines, Chiifu and RCBrWe detected two W blocks, one each on A2 and A10, that harboured QTL for petiole length, seeds per siliqua, leaf traits, days to bolting and flowering, and siliqua length (Fig. 1). These two blocks harbour paralogous BraCKX3 genes (Table 3). The E block on A2 only contained QTL for siliqua traits, but the paralogous block on A7 contained major QTL clusters for leaf traits, flowering and bolting, plant height, and siliqua traits. We detected GASA1, flowering locus T (BraFT), and apetala 1 (BraAP1) on both LGs. FT and AP are components of the flowering gene network..BraCKX5 was found only on A7 (Fig. 1).The J block of A3 contained many QTL for leaf, siliqua, and seed traits, plant height, and days to bolting and flowering, whereas the same blocks in A4 harboured QTL for leaf length and midrib length, and A5 contained QTL for flowering time and plant height (Fig. 1). A. thaliana growth-regulating factor32 (BraGRF3) was found in all three LGs. However, BraCKX1 paralogs were found only on A3 and A4, whereas asymmetric leaves 133 (BraAS1) paralogs were found only on A3 and A5 (Fig. 1).The candidate gene BraGA20X434 was identified in the C block of A5, which contains QTL for siliqua beak length. The H block of A7 contained QTL for days to flowering, bolting, and leaf width, whereas the paralogous block of A9 contained QTL for siliqua beak length. BraCKX2 paralogs were found in the QTL regions of both LGs (Fig. 1). The U block of A1 contained QTL for flowering and leaf width, whereas the paralogous block on A3 (U/T block) contained QTL for leaf width, length, and seeds per siliqua. The candidate genes BraGRF2 and BraAP2 were detected in both LGs. The X block in A6 contained QTL for days to bolting and harboured candidate gene LEAFY and mads affecting flowering time 3. The Q block harboured QTL for seed weight, leaf, and flowering traits and contained the GA-insensitive 1 gene (BraGA) that interacts with GA and is involved in floral transition and GA signalling.3.4. Identification, validation, and functional significance analysis of SNPs in candidate genesTo develop gene-specific SNP markers for breeding morphological and yield-related traits, we aligned all the identified candidate gene sequences from the parental lines and identified varying number of SNPs, ranging from one to many, between them (Fig. 2 and Table 3). As expected, we found more SNPs in the intronic regions than in the exonic regions. However, we did not detect any SNPs in a few genes, e.g. BraGA20OX3 in the R blocks of A2 and A10 and BraCKX1 in the J block of A03 (Fig. 2 and Table 3). SNPs identified for different cytokinin oxidases/dehydrogenases (CKX) paralogs between Chiifu and RCBr derived from whole genome resequenced data. Exons and introns are represented by blue rectangular bars and lines, respectively. Numbers indicated by arrows show the SNP positions from the start codon for Chiifu (left nucleotide) and RCBr (right nucleotide).SNPs identified for different cytokinin oxidases/dehydrogenases (CKX) paralogs between Chiifu and RCBr derived from whole genome resequenced data. Exons and introns are represented by blue rectangular bars and lines, respectively. Numbers indicated by arrows show the SNP positions from the start codon for Chiifu (left nucleotide) and RCBr (right nucleotide).To validate these SNPs experimentally, we designed a total of 12 primer pairs, 1 each from different genes flanking the SNPs and genotyped the parental lines and mapping population. Of the 12 SNPs, 10 primer pairs revealed clear polymorphisms (Supplementary Table S3). We genotyped using these 10 primer pairs in the mapping population and mapped them precisely in the B. rapa genome, which indicated their co-localization with the QTL positions on the respective chromosomes (Figs 1 and 3). Association analysis with the different phenotypes of the F3 population showed a correlation with the phenotypes and their co-localization in the QTL regions. We sequenced some of the genes containing SNPs using the resequenced data to validate whether the NGS data of the parental lines were correct. Resequencing of 10 genes showed the exact sequences as shown by NGS. We observed that the SNPs in coding regions of some potential candidate genes affected amino acid sequence, suggesting possible functional roles in phenotypic differences (Supplementary Fig. S1). The SNP in exon 2 of BraGA20OX3b codes for isoleucine in Chiifu and leucine in RCBr, methionine/threonine in exon 2 of BraCKX1b while serine was found in Chiifu, but no counterpart amino acid was observed in RCBr in exon 5 of BraCKX3b. Two amino acid changes were observed in exon 1 of BraGA2OX4 (arginine/serine and serine/threonine), one each in exons 2 (aspartate/valine), and four (alanine/threonine) of BraCKX7a, two each in exon 1 (valine/isoleucine and glycine/serine) of BraCKX7b and exon 4 (isoleucine/serine and threonine/alanine) of BraGRF2a, one each in exon 2 (leucine/arginine) and exon 4 (glycine/serine) of BraGRF3c, and two in exon 1 (methionine /valine and threonine/serine) of BraCOL1 gene.

Plot A represents the curve-shifted plot, and B represents a difference plot showing ‘Chiifu’ type in red colour, ‘RCBr’ type in grey colour, and hetero type in green colour.Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis was used to evaluate expression differences of candidate genes between the parental lines. The gibberellin biosynthesis and oxidase, cytokinin oxidases/dehydrogenases and growth-regulating factor gene families that affect leaf, plant, and flower development, showed differential gene expression between Chiifu and RCBr lines (Fig. 4). BraCKX5, BraCKX3a, BraCKX1a, and BraCKX7a showed higher expression in Chiifu, whereas very little or no expression was seen in RCBr. Genes that are involved in flowering pathways, such as FLC, FT, COL, and GA, were also analysed for differential expression between the parental lines. Of the three BraFLC paralogs, only BraFLCa on A2 did not show any expression in RCBr while the other two BraFLCs showed no difference in expression. BraMAF3 on A6 showed higher expression level in Chiifu when compared with RCBr. BraAP2a on A1, BraCOL1a on A2, BraGA on A6 and BraFTb on A7 showed strong expression in RCBr, but very little to no expression in Chiifu. BraGRF2a, BraGRF3a, and BraGA2OX4 showed comparatively higher expression in Chiifu while BraGA20OX3c showed higher expression in RCBr. This differential gene expression and the amino acid changes suggest possible roles in phenotypic differences between the parental lines and in the segregating population.

Functional conservation of crucifer building blocks between the A, B, and C subgenomes of Brassica species as revealed by comparative QTL mappingWe aligned the QTL map of B. rapa from this study with the B. juncea map of Ramchiary et al.20 and B. napus QTL maps of Quijada et al.21 and Udall et al.22 to identify the structural and functional conservation of QTL blocks for important morphological and yield component traits. Comparative alignment of the QTL maps between these three species identified a total of four homologous/homoeologous groups (HGs) containing QTL for agronomic and yield component traits (Fig. 5). The first group was the R block of Ar2, Aj2, An2, Cn2, and Bj2 (r, j, and n stand for B. rapa, B. juncea, and B. napus, respectively). Although many major QTL for different traits were detected in the B. rapa A subgenome, in comparison with B. napus, three traits, namely, plant height, flowering time, and seed yield, were commonly detected in the A subgenome of the two species and the homoeologous region of the same block in the C subgenome of B. napus. We did not detect any QTL in the Aj2 or Bj2 subgenomes of B. juncea (Fig. 3). The second HG was the A3, B3, and C3 chromosomes of the A, B, and C subgenomes of Brassica species. Three blocks, namely, R, J, and F, harboured common QTL between the three subgenomes. The R block of this HG contained common QTL for seed weight, yield, and test weight (hereafter referred to collectively as SW) and flowering time QTL between the A and C subgenomes of B. napus and the A subgenome of B. rapa. In addition, the homoeologous region of this block contained QTL for a number of branches of the B subgenome of B. juncea. The J block of this group contained many QTL in Ar3, but few in An3, Aj3, and Bj3. The common loci were for SW and flowering time in addition to siliqua traits, e.g. siliqua length, density, and number, and plant height. The last common block, i.e. the F block of this group, harboured common trait QTL mainly for SW and plant height between An3 and Cn3. The most important common block of HG7 was the E block. This block contained common QTL for plant height, SW, flowering time, siliqua number and density, and seed number per siliqua in Ar7, Aj7, Cn7, and Bj7. In addition, some leaf traits were detected in Ar7. The last common group of the A, B, and C Brassica subgenomes was HG10 that contained the W and R blocks. The W block contained common QTL for siliqua length, seed number per siliqua, and SW between Ar10, An10, and Aj10. In addition, QTL for flowering, plant height, and leaf traits were detected in Ar10 and An10, respectively. However, in this block, no single or corresponding common QTL were detected in Bj10 and Cn10. The most important block of HG10 was the R block. This block harboured common major QTL for plant height, branch number, flowering time, siliqua traits, and SW in Ar10, Aj10, An10, Bj10, and Cn10, respectively. Similarly, the middle region of Ar6 (X and Q block) in the present study detected QTL for SW, leaf, and flowering traits while the same chromosomal region in B. juncea detected major QTL for siliqua length and density.20 We also detected common QTL for flowering and SW, both in Ar6 and Cn6 subgenomes.21Comparative QTL mapping between B. rapa, B. juncea, and B. napus revealed conservation of crucifer building blocks governing morphological and yield component traits. Superscripts ‘r’, ‘n’, and ‘j’ after each A, B, and C LGs denote chromosomes that were derived from B. rapa, B. napus, and B. juncea, respectively. QTL in B genome of B. juncea were taken from Ramchiary et al.,20 and the C genome of B. napus from Quijada et al.,21 and Udall et al.22Comparative QTL mapping between B. rapa, B. juncea, and B. napus revealed conservation of crucifer building blocks governing morphological and yield component traits. Superscripts ‘r’, ‘n’, and ‘j’ after each A, B, and C LGs denote chromosomes that were derived from B. rapa, B. napus, and B. juncea, respectively. QTL in B genome of B. juncea were taken from Ramchiary et al.,20 and the C genome of B. napus from Quijada et al.,21 and Udall et al.224. Discussion4.1. QTL mapping revealed some crucifer blocks that were functionally more active than duplicated paralogous blocks in the B. rapa genomeAlthough in many studies, immortal mapping populations such as doubled haploid and recombinant inbred lines are used, in our present study, we used F3 families for three consecutive years to detect QTL, as F3 families represent the comprehensive genetic information of heterozygous and homozygous plants and their interacting effects on phenotype. As the parental lines Chiifu and RCBr were very different with respect to all the traits under study, it was easy to detect many QTL in B. rapa using the segregating F3 population. Correlation coefficient analysis revealed significant correlations between leaf and yield-related traits that were further supported by the co-mapping of several QTL governing different traits in a few chromosomal blocks of the B. rapa genome. The co-localization of QTL governing different traits in the same genetic interval has been suggested to be due to either pleiotropy exhibited by a single gene or tight linkage of genetic loci governing different traits in the same genetic interval.8,20 The R block of A2 contained QTL for eight traits while the same paralogous blocks on A10 and A3 contained QTL for five and four traits, respectively (Fig. 1). Prominent QTL clusters were observed for seven traits related to leaf, flowering, bolting, and siliqua traits on the E block of A7 while the same block on A2 contained only one QTL for siliqua length. A similar case was observed for the J blocks, where the same block on A3 harboured QTL for 10 traits, but only harboured QTL for 2 traits on A4 and A5. These findings suggest that the R block of A2, E block of A7, and J block of A3 contain more active genes that govern leaf traits, plant morphology, and seed traits. Lou et al.8 and Li et al.9 also observed QTL clusters in these LGs for days to flowering, bolting, and leaf traits. We presumed that the chromosomal blocks of Lou et al.8 were the R block on A2 and E block on A7. The W block on A2 contained QTL clusters for days to flowering and bolting and seeds per siliqua, whereas A10 contained QTL for siliqua and leaf traits. This kind of observation suggests that only those crucifer blocks harbouring QTL might possess functionally active genes for the traits under study, as reported by Wang et al.16 and Tang et al.35 for the B. rapa genome. They reported that, of the triplicate duplicated subgenomes, fractionation and deletion of genes were more frequent in some subgenomes when compared with other paralogs. We also observed that some candidate genes were missing in major QTL blocks, such as BraGASA4 from A10 and BraCKX5 from A3, which both belong to the R block that is homologous to A. thaliana chromosome 5. Other reasons for not finding equal QTL/genes in all paralogous blocks may be that the genes are not functionally active or the absence of polymorphisms in the causal genes between the parental lines.4.2. Gene family members were detected in different QTL blocks of the B. rapa genomeMany candidate genes in QTL blocks for flowering, leaf, seed, and siliqua traits were identified through synteny analysis of the B. rapa and A. thaliana genomes. The R block, homologous to A. thaliana chromosome 5, harbours many flowering genes, including FLC and COL1. We identified BraFLC and BraCOL1 paralogs in those blocks containing QTL for flowering time, as reported by earlier studies.8,36 Recent studies have shown that members of cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenases (CKX), GA-stimulated Arabidopsis (GASA), and GA oxidase (GA2OX, GA20OXs, etc.) gene families are involved in the regulation of flower and inflorescence development, thereby increasing the seed size and yield.28–31CKX genes are important for agricultural productivity as mutations in these genes cause accumulation of high levels of cytokinin in the inflorescence meristem and increased reproductive organs and larger flowers and seeds.29,30 These genes co-localized in the QTL blocks of B. rapa LGs A2, A3, A4, A7, A9, and A10. GASA genes are active in the shoot apical meristem, developing flowers, and embryos. GASA mutants and GASA over-expressing plants demonstrated that GASA genes are involved in floral meristem identity and affect seed size and yield in A. thaliana.29 We observed two paralogs of BraGASA4, one on each R block of A2 and A3, but not on the R block of A10, suggesting that the paralogs on A10 may have been lost over time, although all blocks harboured QTL for flowering, siliqua, and seed traits. GA oxidases were observed in the QTL regions of the R, J, and other blocks containing prominent QTL for leaf and flowering traits, and a possible involvement of this gene family in leaf traits was reported by Li et al.9 The BraGRF members found on A1 and A5 are also candidates for leaf and flowering traits, as supported by their co-localization with these QTL regions. Several members of the BraCOL and BraFT families were also found in different LGs in the QTL regions, suggesting an involvement in trait variation.SNPs analysis revealed some amino acid changes between the parental lines in many genes belonging to constans like 1(COL1), cytokinin oxidases/dehydrogenases, growth-regulating factor, and GA oxidases gene families. Further expression analysis showed higher expression of genes that facilitate early flowering such as BraCOL1a, BraFT, BraAP2 in RCBr, but minimal expression in Chiifu, whereas the flowering repressor gene BraFLCa was highly expressed in Chiifu suggesting an association between flowering trait and expression of these genes. The co-mapping of these genes with flowering QTL in different LGs further supported this notion. Members of growth-regulating factor, GA oxidase, and cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenases gene families that co-localized within the QTL region showed higher expression in Chiifu, suggesting their role in better growth and development of leaf, plants, and reproductive organs when compared with RCBr. Either non-synonymous SNPs or differential genes expression or a combination of these factors may underlie phenotypic differences between the parental lines and in the segregating populations. However, this should be further assessed in different plant tissues.4.3. QTL blocks are evolutionarily conserved between the A, B, and C subgenomes of Brassica speciesOur comparative QTL map alignment between B. rapa, B. napus, and B. juncea revealed conservation of QTL blocks that contain several genetic loci influencing plant height, flowering, siliqua, and seed traits between the A, B, and C subgenomes of Brassica species (Fig. 5). Although many earlier studies reported the conservation of chromosomal blocks at the gross level,10,11,14 a comparison of QTL location has not been performed for yield component traits between different Brassica subgenomes. In our present study, we identified conserved QTL blocks in 4 of the 10 HGs of the A, B, and C subgenomes reported by Panjabi et al.11 As plant height, flowering time, siliqua, and seed traits were the only common traits studied in the three species, we could study the conservation of these traits in the four HG QTL blocks. The R blocks of HG2, HG3, and HG10, E block of HG7, W block of HG10, and J and F blocks of HG2 were major QTL blocks harbouring common QTL for SW, plant height, flowering, and siliqua traits between the A, B, and C subgenomes of these three species. This suggest that the genes governing these traits are structurally and functionally conserved not only between the A, B, and C subgenomes of Brassica species but also between A. thaliana and Brassica genomes, even though they diverged from their common ancestor a long time ago.12 We previously found the conservation of QTL for seed oil, total seed glucosinolates, and seed protein content between the A subgenomes of B. rapa and B. napus.5 Studies on B. napus21,22 and B. juncea20 detected QTL in homoeologous LGs of the A and C and A and B subgenomes, respectively, but detailed information with respect to specific crucifer blocks was not provided. We found more common QTL between the A and C subgenomes when compared with the B subgenome with either the A or C subgenomes. Although we believe that more comparisons using QTL maps from different mapping populations are needed, the present study suggests that A and C (diverged 8 MYA) are more close than the A/B and C subgenomes, as reported earlier.12 We also observed many QTL in one species that had no counterparts controlling the same traits in the corresponding locations of other species, which might have been the result of a lack of genetic polymorphisms between the parental lines or diversified molecular polymorphisms between the species due to the presence of genomic rearrangements/structural changes causing differences in functional expression between different Brassica species. We believe that adding more markers to generate a high-density map and a detailed comparison of QTL for common traits using different mapping populations of more Brassica species would give more detailed information about the conservation and diversification of genetic loci governing morphological and yield component traits.4.4. Breeding opportunities in Brassica species using candidate gene information from B. rapaThe present QTL mapping study identified some interesting findings regarding the presence of candidate genes for important traits in a few specific crucifer building blocks of the B. rapa genome (Fig. 1). Although, the crucifer blocks demonstrated the co-localization of important QTL and candidate genes, association analysis using large segregating population with different trait phenotypes and functional validation of candidate genes by transformation should be done because each QTL block contains several genes governing overlapping traits. We observed few gene paralogs within the QTL interval in one duplicated block but not in others, suggesting the need for further validation. However, we believe that some of the SNPs identified in candidate genes such as BraCKXs, BraGASA4, BraGA20OXs, BraGRFs, BraFLC, BraCOLs, BraMAF, and BraAP2 would be helpful in breeding leaf, flowering, bolting, siliqua, and seed traits of B. rapa, as their differential expressions in parental lines and previous studies suggest their role in creating phenotypic differences9. However, additional expression studies using different tissues are needed. Although genome sequencing of other cultivated Brassica species is ongoing, gene sequence information of B. rapa could be used to isolate and develop molecular markers for breeding other Brassica species, especially B. juncea and B. napus, as B. rapa is one of the progenitor species of both species and there still exists QTL block conservation for important agronomic and yield component traits between these three species.Supplementary dataSupplementary Data are available atwww.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis research was partially supported by Chinese Cabbage Molecular Marker Research Center (Grant No. 607003-05) and Agriculture Research Center (Grant No. 06362010-0010) from the Technology Development Program for Agriculture and Forestry, Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, as well as a grant from the Next-Generation BioGreen 21 Program (Plant Molecular Breeding Center No. PJ007992), Rural Development Administration, Republic of Korea.We are thankful to the Korea Brassica Genome Resource Bank for providing Chiifu and CRF3 mapping population, Prof. Deepak Pental and Prof. Akshay K.

The linkage map was constructed by integrating linkage data from two backcross populations derived from three inbred BPH strains. The consensus map consists of 474 simple sequence repeats, 43 single-nucleotide polymorphisms, and 1 sequence-tagged site, for a total of 518 markers at 472 unique positions in 17 linkage groups. The linkage groups cover 1093.9 cM, with an average distance of 2.3 cM between loci. The average number of marker loci per linkage group was 27.8. The sex-linkage group was identified by exploiting X-linked and Y-specific markers. Our linkage map and the newly developed markers used to create it constitute an essential resource and a useful framework for future genetic analyses in BPH.1. IntroductionThe brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens Stål (Homoptera: Delphacidae), is one of the most economically important insect pests of rice (Oryza sativa L.) throughout Asia. The widespread damage caused by BPH leads to substantial and unpredictable decreases in rice yield. Continuous rice cultivation, accompanied by extensive use and frequent misuse of insecticides along with a high rate of nitrogen fertilizer application, often causes BPH outbreaks in rice fields.1 More than 50 million ha of rice fields throughout Asia have been heavily affected by this insect in the past decade.2–4 In addition to directly feeding on rice plants, BPH also causes indirect damage by transmitting viruses that cause the ragged stunt and grassy stunt diseases of rice.5Host-plant resistance offers a practical approach for BPH control, and a succession of resistant rice varieties has been bred and cultivated widely in Asia. Nevertheless, the appearance of BPH with new virulence characteristics can overcome their resistance soon after the varieties have been released.4,6 The virulence, which refers to the ability to adapt to resistant rice varieties, has been reported to be under genetic control and is inherited as a quantitative trait.7 Understanding the genetic basis of the virulence against rice cultivars will provide significant information for future BPH management strategies. A genetic linkage map would provide an important framework for identifying quantitative trait loci (QTL) related to the virulence characteristics. Unfortunately, no detailed genetic linkage map based on molecular markers has yet been developed for BPH or for other closely related delphacid species.BPH has a diploid chromosome number of 30 (28 autosomes combined with the sex determination system XY and XX in males and females, respectively).8–10 The genome size of BPH is estimated to be 1.2 Gbp.11 Recently, a number of genomic resources for BPH have been made available, and they provide highly useful information to support experimental genetics studies.12–16 More than 350 expressed sequence tag (EST)-derived simple sequence repeat (e-SSR) markers for BPH have been successfully developed subsequent to the availability of large EST datasets.17–19 In addition, a total of 136 SSRs have been isolated from BPH genomic DNA.20 These newly developed e-SSRs and genomic SSR (g-SSR) markers have been used to assess the genetic diversity of BPH populations.17,20 However, the exact genomic locations of the newly developed SSR markers have not yet been determined by genetic mapping.Genetic maps are valuable genomic resources and represent a powerful research tool for identifying the genetic basis of phenotypic variation. The purpose of the present study was to construct a baseline genetic linkage map for BPH using both new and existing SSRs and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). G-SSR markers were generated from the sequence information of repeat regions derived from high-throughput microsatellite isolation procedures. We also developed SNP markers using next-generation sequencing technologies. The newly developed and public markers were successfully applied to construct a consensus linkage map. This map will provide initial information for identifying the genetic basis of BPH virulence and other important traits, including insecticide resistance, virus transmission, and wing polymorphisms. In addition, the newly developed markers will support studies of the morphology, physiology, evolution, and ecology of this significant insect pest.2. Materials and methods2.1. Insect strains and crossesFour BPH strains collected in Japan were used in this study. (i) Hadano-66 was collected in Hadano, Kanagawa Prefecture, in 1966 and was maintained in a laboratory colony for ~500 generations, (ii) Chikugo-89 was collected in Chikugo, Fukuoka Prefecture, in 1989 and was maintained in a laboratory colony for more than 250 generations, (iii) Koshi-10 was collected in Koshi, Kumamoto Prefecture, in 2010 and was maintained for ~20 generations in a laboratory colony and (iv) Izumo-87 was collected in Izumo, Shimane Prefecture, in 1987 and was maintained in a laboratory colony for ~270 generations. These BPH strains immigrated into Japan from East Asian regions.21,22 The Izumo-87 strain was used for whole-genome sequencing to generate a reference sequence12 and detect SNPs. Hadano-66, Chikugo-89, and Koshi-10 strains were used to generate the inbred BPH strains (IBSs) and the mapping populations. One pair of insects from each BPH strain was selected for crossing to generate the IBSs H66 for Hadano-66, C89 for Chikugo-89, and K10 for Koshi-10. The IBSs were prepared without outcrossing through three generations of single-pair, full-sibling mating (Fig. 1). All BPH strains were reared on seedlings of cv. ‘Reiho’, a japonica rice variety, and maintained in the laboratory at 25 ± 2°C under a 16L:8D photoperiod. To generate the mapping populations, a pair of insects from two different IBSs was selected and crossed using single-pair mating. Two backcross populations (BC1F1) were generated from crosses (<U+2640> × <U+2642>) of K10 × H66 with backcrossing with H66 (referred to as the KH population) and C89 × K10 with backcrossing with C89 (referred to as the CK population). Mating scheme of an experiment perform to obtain IBSs and mapping populations.Mating scheme of an experiment perform to obtain IBSs and mapping populations.The crosses were performed by placing a virgin female and a male from each IBS on ‘Reiho’ seedlings in a glass tube. After mating and oviposition, the parental insects were collected and stored in 95% ethanol. The F1 offspring from each cross was cultured in separate containers. Newly hatched nymphs of F1 progeny from each cross were transferred into a plastic 800-ml container (dimensions: 8.5 cm wide by 16 cm tall) containing 8–10 seedlings and reared up to the fifth-instar nymph stage. An individual fifth-instar nymph of each sex was selected and reared in a separate glass tube to obtain unmated adults. F1 females were backcrossed with their parent family to generate the BC1F1 generation (Fig. 1). BC1F1 offspring from each cross were reared up to the second- and third-instar nymph stages. Although it is not possible to sex the insects at this stage, using early instars greatly accelerates the analytical process and avoids viability problems that may occur at later stages. All offspring were then collected and stored in 95% ethanol. We randomly selected 91 KH offspring and 89 CK offspring for the linkage analysis. All crossing experiments were conducted in the insectary at the Kyushu Okinawa Agricultural Research Center, Kumamoto, Japan.2.2. Total DNA extraction and whole-genome amplificationGenomic DNA of the preserved samples (grandparents, parents, and offspring) was isolated individually using a modified version of the potassium acetate procedure of Dellaporta et al.23 For the adult insects, only the head and thorax were used for DNA extraction to reduce the possibility of contamination by fertilized eggs and bacterial symbionts.24 The whole-genome amplification technique25 was used to produce large amounts of DNA from individual insects for large-scale genotyping.2.3. Microsatellite isolation, sequencing, and primer designTwo SSR-enrichment genomic libraries were prepared from Hadano-66 genomic DNA that was extracted from ~50 insects, including nymphs, adults, males, and females. The first library (referred to as the SREL library) was produced by the Savannah River Ecology Laboratory (University of Georgia), following the method of Glenn and Schable.26 Briefly, 2 µg of BPH genomic DNA was digested with RsaI. The digested DNA was ligated with double-stranded SuperSNX linkers (5'–GTTTAAGGCCTAGCTAGCAGAATC–3'/5'–GATTCTGCTAGCTAGGC CTTAAACAAAA–3'). The linker-ligated DNA was hybridized with seven biotinylated oligo probes: (AG)12, (TG)12, (AAC)6, (AAG)8, (AAT)12, (ACT)12, and (ATC)8. The DNA fragments with a microsatellite repeat were captured using Dynabeads (Dynal, Oslo, Norway) under a magnetic field. The amount of eluted DNA was increased by using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to recover enriched DNA fragments using the SuperSNX primer pairs.The fast isolation by amplified fragment length polymorphism of sequences containing repeats (FIASCO) procedure described by Zane et al.27 was used to isolate the second library (referred to as the KU library) at the Plant Breeding Laboratory (Kyushu University). Briefly, genomic DNA was digested with MseI and ligated to MseI adaptors (5'–TACTCAGGACTCAT–3/5–GACGATGAGTCCTGAG–3'). The mixture was amplified with an MseI adaptor primer (5'–GATGAGTCCTGAGTAAN–3'). The PCR product was then hybridized with six biotinylated probes: (CT)10, (CA)10, (CAC)7, (AAG)7, (TCC)7, and (GACA)5. The DNA molecules that were hybridized to biotinylated probes were captured using streptavidin magnetic particles (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) using a magnetic field. PCR was performed to recover enriched DNA fragments using the MseI adaptor primer.The SREL and KU libraries were sequenced using the Roche 454 GS FLX Titanium system (454 Life Sciences, Branford, CT, USA). SSRs in the read data were detected using a Perl script in the Simple Sequence Repeat Identification Tool (SSRIT),28 with minimum thresholds of nine, six, five, five, five, and five repeat units for di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, hexa-, and heptanucleotide repeats, respectively. The terminal sequences derived from the ligated adapters were eliminated in both directions. SSR regions were masked by continuous N letters with the same length as the detected SSRs. The masked sequences were then de novo assembled using the Newbler software (454 Life Sciences). A flanking sequence of an appropriate length for primer design was calculated using a Perl script and Primer3.29To develop e-SSR markers, we obtained the EST sequences contributed by Noda et al.12 from the NCBI database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). The EST sequences were analysed for SSR discovery using SSRIT with minimum thresholds of six, five, five, three, and three repeat units for di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, and hexanucleotide SSRs, respectively. All EST sequences that contained SSRs were assembled using the CodonCode Aligner software (CodonCode Corporation, http://www.codoncode.com/). Primer3 was used to design the primers. We designed 341 primer pairs, but only 50 primer pairs were randomly selected and used for the polymorphism test.The newly developed g-SSR and e-SSR markers were named using the prefixes NLGS (Nilaparvata lugens g-SSR) and NLES (Nilaparvata lugens e-SSR), respectively, followed by the number of the marker. For the primers from Jing et al.,17 we retained the original published names. Primer functionality and polymorphism were tested on the parents of the backcross populations. Only clearly polymorphic markers were employed to genotype individuals from the mapping populations. The PCR products were electrophoresed on 4% agarose gels in 0.5× Tris–borate–EDTA buffer, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized under ultraviolet light. All PCR conditions are summarized in Supplementary Tables S1–S3.2.4. SNP discovery and analysisSNPs were discovered by comparing whole-genome sequence data from two BPH strains, Izumo-87 (I87)12 and IBS-C89. The reference genomic sequences of I87 were acquired using the Roche 454 GS FLX pyrosequencing platform (H. Noda, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, unpublished data). To obtain reference genomic contigs, the short-read next-generation sequencing data were subjected to de novo assembly using the Celera Assembler software (v6.1).30 The genome sequence of IBS-C89 was performed using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform, and a total of about 77.3 million reads were generated. The read data were mapped to reference genomic contigs using the BWA software (v0.6.1).31 SNPs between I87 and IBS-C89 were called using the SAMtools/BCFtools software (v0.1.12a)32 and visualized using the Tablet software (v1.12).33 We randomly selected 234 SNPs that were homogeneous within the strain. PCR primers were designed to amplify 500- to 600-bp fragments carrying each potential SNP. The fragments were sequenced using a 3730 DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) to screen for polymorphic SNPs between the reference strains (I87 and IBS-C89) and two of the parents of the KH mapping populations (K10 and H66). The selected polymorphic SNPs were used to genotype individual offspring of the KH population. The developed SNP markers were named using the prefixes NLSP (Nilaparvata lugens SNP), followed by the number of the marker. The primers and the PCR conditions are summarized in Supplementary Table S4.2.5. Genetic linkage analysis and map constructionA genetic linkage map of each mapping population was analysed using the JoinMap software (v4.1).34 All markers were tested for significant deviation from a normal Mendelian segregation ratio to assess the goodness-of-fit to the expected ratios of 1:1, 1:1:1:1, and 1:2:1 for each marker at a 5% significance level. The ‘outcross pollinated’ (CP) option was used as the population type in this analysis. Grouping of markers was performed using a minimum-independence logarithm of odds (LOD) threshold of 5.0. Groups were converted into maps using the regression algorithm provided by JoinMap with a recombination frequency smaller than 0.45 used for the linkages, and then Kosambi's mapping function35 was used to calculate map distances. Distorted markers were retained for mapping, if their presence did not alter the surrounding marker order in a given linkage group (LG).On completion of the linkage maps for KH and CK, the individual maps were integrated into a consensus map by applying the ‘combine groups for map integration’ module of JoinMap. An integrated map was created by merging bridging-SSR markers in homologous LGs into a single consensus map. Linkage maps were drawn using the MapChart software for Windows.36 The expected genome coverage was estimated according to the method of Chakravarti et al.,37 in which the length of each LG was multiplied by (m + 1)/(m - 1), where m is the marker number on each LG.3. Results3.1. SSR development and genotypingSSR development and primer design: High-throughput sequencing by the 454 GS FLX Titanium generated ~23.6 Mbp of read data with 87 068 reads from the SREL library. The sequence data were de novo assembled into 1906 contigs. After the assembly, the contigs had an average length of 303 bp. Among the 1906 unique sequences, 970 had flanking regions that were large enough for primer design. For the KU library, ~24.1 Mbp of read data were generated. From 83 630 reads, 4490 unique contigs were produced, with an average length of 314 bp after the assembly. Of the 4490 contigs, 2556 had flanking regions that were large enough for primer design. Finally, 860 and 2300 primer pairs were designed from the read data for the SREL and KU libraries, respectively.SSR polymorphism: A total of 3160 g-SSR primer pairs from the SSR enrichments, 50 newly developed e-SSRs, and 351 publicly available e-SSRs were used to screen for polymorphisms in the parents of the KH and CK populations. Of the 3160 g-SSR markers, 2048 (64.8%) were successfully amplified by PCR. Of these 2048 SSR primer pairs, 922 (45.0%) amplified fragments were polymorphic between the parents. From these polymorphic g-SSRs, only 418 (45.3%) were informative in the mapping populations. The remaining 504 (54.7%) polymorphic markers could not be scored, mostly due to banding patterns that were too difficult to interpret, including multiple-banding patterns, bands that amplified poorly in the offspring, and bands that did not show clear polymorphism on the 4% agarose gel. Of the 50 newly developed e-SSR markers, 15 (30.0%) amplified fragments were polymorphic between the parents. Of the 351 published e-SSR markers that we tested, 317 (90.3%) were successfully amplified by PCR and 100 of the 317 (31.5%) showed polymorphism. Of the total of 1037 polymorphic markers, including g-SSRs, public e-SSRs, and newly developed e-SSRs, only 408 and 213 primer pairs were selected to analyse offspring of the KH and CK populations, respectively. Details of the polymorphic SSR markers are summarized in Supplementary Tables S1–S3.3.2. SNP discovery and genotypingOf the 234 primer pairs designed to amplify SNP target sequences, 164 (70.1%) were successfully used to amplify a single amplicon of the expected size. Among them, 79 loci (48.2%) were polymorphic between the survey strains (I87 and IBS-C89), and 48 loci (29.3%) were polymorphic between the parents of the KH population. Six SNP markers that were not heterozygous in the offspring of the KH population were excluded from the analysis, leaving 42 loci. After adding 4 SNPs from a preliminary experiment, 46 SNPs were selected and used to genotype the offspring of the KH mapping population. The SNP markers and PCR conditions are summarized in Supplementary Table S4.3.3. Linkage analysis and map constructionIndividual genetic linkage maps: The polymorphic markers used for linkage map construction consisted of e-SSR, g-SSR, SNP, and sequence-tagged site (STS) markers. Based on the results of the LG analysis, we constructed individual linkage maps for the KH and CK populations. The KH linkage map was developed from g-SSR, e-SSR, and SNP markers with an LOD score of 5.0. The map consisted of 18 LGs with 357 unique positions (excluding duplicated markers), derived from 348 SSR and 44 SNP markers and covered 870.2 cM. The average distance between the markers was 2.8 cM (Supplementary Table S5, Fig. S1). The LGs ranged in length from 3.8 to 83.2 cM. Of these markers, 21 were unlinked or unsuccessfully positioned. Of the 21 unmapped markers, 13 were not linked to another marker and the remaining 8 markers were assigned to LGs, but no map positions were determined. Chi-square analysis indicated that more than 10% of the markers deviated from Mendelian segregation at P < 0.01.Only 180 g-SSR markers, 32 e-SSR markers, and 1 STS marker that showed polymorphism among the parents (for a total of 213 markers) were selected to analyse the offspring of the CK population. A linkage map was constructed with a recombination threshold of 0.45, and the minimum number of markers per group was set to two. Linkage analysis was performed at a minimum LOD of 5.0. The linkage map consisted of 207 marker loci in 16 LGs that covered 770.7 cM. (Supplementary Table S6, Fig. S1). The LGs ranged in length from 1.4 to 85.9 cM, with an average distance of 4.4 cM between markers. We positioned 43 distorted loci (20.8%) in LGs 1 to 15. The majority was clustered in LG16. We found four unlinked markers and excluded two other distorted markers from the analysis. The Y chromosomal marker PMn3 was mapped at the end of the LG arm next to NLGS201 in LG16 of the CK population.Consensus linkage map: The consensus map was constructed by integrating linkage data from the two backcross populations (KH and CK). The ‘combine groups for map integration’ module of JoinMap was used to integrate the two individual maps into a consensus map. A total of 73 common SSR markers between the homologous LGs were used as bridges to integrate the individual maps. The order of the bridged markers was consistent between the two individual maps, except for 16 marker inversions in LG2 to LG8, in LG10, and in LG12 to LG13 (Supplementary Fig. S1). The final consensus map contained 400 g-SSR, 74 e-SSR, 43 SNP, and 1 STS markers (for a total of 518), with 472 unique positions in 17 LGs. Table 1 summarizes the statistics for the consensus LGs, and Supplementary Table S7 reports the locus name and its position for all loci in the 17 LGs in the consensus map. The length of the 17 LGs ranged from 19.0 cM (LG17) to 98.1 cM (LG13). The average genetic distance between loci was 2.3 cM. Gaps larger than 20 cM were found in LG 8 to LG11 and in LG14 (Fig. 2). The largest gap in the framework map was 43.9 cM and occurred in LG8. The large gaps observed in the individual maps were reduced in the consensus map. In total, 30 markers remained unlinked. The number of integrated (consensus) LGs was close to the actual number of haploid chromosomes in BPH (n = 15). The 17 LGs contained 518 loci that encompassed 1093.9 cM of the total map distance (excluding the distance from PM3n to the distal end of LG11) and covered 92.3% of the estimated genome size. According to the estimated genome size of BPH (1200 Mbp),11 the recombination rate is ~0.91 cM/Mbp.

Identification of markers linked with the sex chromosomesWe found that most SSR and SNP markers in LG16 of the CK population deviated significantly from the expected Mendelian segregation ratio of 1:2:1 (homozygous parental: heterozygous: homozygous parental). The segregation of all marker loci in LG16 was exploited to distinguish the X chromosome from the autosomes. If the genotypes of the F1 maternal and BC1 paternal parents are designated as X1X2 and X1Y1, respectively, there would be four equal proportions of BC1F1 genotypes in the offspring in which the females are X1X1 or X1X2 and the males are X2Y1 or X1Y1. In addition, a ratio of 2:1:1 [homozygous/hemizygous paternal bands (X1X1/X1Y1): heterozygous (X1X2): homozygous maternal band (X2Y1)] would be expected from the amplified DNA bands. The Y-specific dominant marker PM3n, which was informative in the CK population segregated in a 1:1 ratio, suggested that the CK population had an equal number of males (43) and females (44) in the BC1F1 generation. The observed ratio for all SSR markers in LG16 of CK population matched the expected ratio of 2:1:1, suggesting that these markers are located on the X chromosome (Table 2).

Of the 22 markers in LG11 of the KH population, 12 loci were codominant markers. Because the PM3n marker was not informative for the KH population, the sexes of BC1F1 were not determined. If we assume that the KH population had an equal number of males and females in the BC1F1 generation, the ratio of 2:1:1 would be expected for codominant markers. The codominant markers, including seven SNPs and five SSRs, segregated in a 2:1:1 ratio of homozygous/hemizygous paternal bands: heterozygous: homozygous maternal band in the KH offspring. Using 4% agarose gel to visualize the amplified fragments, we could not distinguish between heterozygous and homozygous genotypes for the paternal genotype of the 10 SSR markers in LG11. These markers were dominant markers, and segregated in a 3:1 ratio for all paternal band types: homozygous maternal band types. These loci also segregated in the ratio expected for a sex-linked marker (Table 2).4. Discussion4.1. Development and analysis of SSR markersEarly research focused on the development of SSR markers from BPH genomic DNA.38 Because of a lack of appropriate strategies at that time, few markers were developed. Later, after an enormous number of BPH ESTs became available,12 more than 350 e-SSR markers were developed to support genetic studies.17–19 Recently, 30 new g-SSR markers were developed via the FIASCO method.20 In the present study, we combined enrichment-based SSR isolation with next-generation sequencing approaches and demonstrated that this approach was a powerful tool for developing SSR markers from genomic DNA. Through these strategies, we developed 3160 g-SSR markers, of which 922 (29.2%) were successfully amplified and showed polymorphism among the BPH strains used as parents for the mapping. As the polymorphisms were detected on a simple agarose gel, only 418 SSR markers (45.3%) were informative. The remaining 54.7% were not informative, mostly due to banding patterns that were too difficult to interpret or bands that were too close together. The number of informative markers could be increased using more powerful fragment separation systems such as fluorescently labelled-fragment capillary arrays.The newly developed e-SSR primers in this study were less polymorphic (30.0%) when compared with the g-SSRs (45.0%). Likewise, the polymorphisms of the publicly available e-SSRs also were <32%. It might be because of greater DNA sequence conservation in transcribed regions. However, e-SSR markers produced a high proportion of high-quality markers with stronger and clearer amplified bands.4.2. Development and analysis of SNP markersWe found a large number of candidate SNPs (>100 000) between the two survey strains in the next-generation sequencing data. However, the frequency of valid SNPs for linkage analysis was low because of several difficulties in developing informative markers using the strategies described in this paper. The major reason for these difficulties was the lack of a reliable reference genome sequence for BPH. The draft assembly of the BPH genome contains a considerable number of intraspecies sequence polymorphisms, leading to insufficiently precise calling of SNPs. Although generating pure IBSs is an effective strategy for reducing heterogeneity, repetitive inbreeding is not easy because it decreases the fecundity and fitness of the BPH populations (T. Kobayashi, unpublished data). Differences between the strains used for the SNP survey (I87 vs. IBS-C89) and the linkage analysis (K10 vs. H66) also reduced the number of valid SNPs. To increase SNP markers in this species, high-quality reference genome sequences and a better strategy to evaluate potential SNPs will be necessary.394.3. Genetic linkage mapBased on the results of our study, we have constructed an SSR- and SNP-based linkage map for BPH. The genetic map consists of 518 markers that cover 1093.9 cM, with an average marker spacing of 2.3 cM. The majority of the mapped e-SSR and SNP markers were widely distributed among several LGs. Disagreement in the number of LGs between the two populations (KH and CK) might have resulted from the large portion of markers in some LGs (LG8 and LG11) and the existence of one small LG (LG17), possibly due to the relatively small number of BC1F1 individuals (<100) used for mapping and the lack of informative markers among LGs belonging to the same chromosome.40,41 The quality and accuracy of marker order in such maps depend on numerous factors, including segregation distortion, the population size, and scoring errors. In some cases, the quality can be improved and the problem can be solved.42 Numerous examples of a high level of deviations from Mendelian segregation ratios have been reported in previous studies (Bombyx mori,43Chlamys farreri,44 and Crassostrea gigas45). In our study, segregation distortion (P < 0.01) was observed for 8.7% of the total marker loci that we analysed. This may have several possible explanations, including inbreeding depression,46 sex-biased ratio distortion,47 erroneous scoring, or linkage between molecular markers and distorting factors such as recessive lethal genes or incompatible alleles.48Population size is one of the factors associated with the accuracy of detecting recombination events, and it can affect the efficiency of the mapping process.49 Because we used small population sizes, inaccurate marker order may have occurred due to inversions and marker distance. However, numerous linkage maps have been successfully produced from small mapping populations (50–94 individuals) in several species.40,50–52 To obtain accurate estimates of marker positions in the map, we only selected clearly polymorphic markers and carefully scored them to reduce errors and ensure the accuracy of the linkage map. Nonetheless, inversions of some markers were observed in several LGs of the consensus map (Supplementary Fig. S1). A more accurate marker order can be acquired by means of map validation, when a draft genome sequence for BPH becomes available.Recombination frequencies in mapping populations of some vertebrate and arthropod species show distinct differences between males and females.53–57 Although the mechanism responsible for these differences in recombination rates between the sexes is not well understood, the phenomenon is common. The conventional way to construct a linkage map is usually to analyse the two sexes separately. Because we collected the offspring of the mapping populations during their early growth stages, the sex of the offspring could not be identified. In addition, the number of females and males in the populations was too small to enable mapping separately within each sex. Consequently, we included both sexes in our linkage analysis to produce a single map. Developing separate linkage maps for the two sexes in future mapping experiments will provide a better understanding of differences in the recombination rates between the sexes of BPH.Mapping with multiple populations is advantageous because a larger number of markers can be placed on a single map, thereby providing greater genomic coverage. Integrated linkage maps have been constructed in various plant and animal species, including insects.52,58–60 We combined two genetic linkage maps from different genetic backgrounds derived from three IBSs that have different virulence against rice differential varieties to BPH,61 into one integrated map. The numbers of markers and the genomic coverage were increased by this approach, and the gaps between markers were reduced in the integrated map. However, the marker density of the final linkage map was still low when compared with the denser linkage maps of other model insect species (e.g. B. mori57,62 and Apis mellifera59). The construction of a highly saturated linkage map with full genome coverage will be possible in future research with more SNP markers. Nevertheless, the new SSR markers and the consensus map developed in the present study provide useful genetic and genomic tools for molecular analysis of the BPH genome and will facilitate the construction of a higher density second-generation linkage map.4.4. Determination of the sex-LGAs we could not identify the sex of individual nymphs in our mapping populations, we used the Y-specific marker PM3n63 as a sex-determining locus (Sex). In the consensus map, the putative location of PM3n was mapped at the distal end of LG11. Additional evidence to confirm the sex-LG would require X-linked loci. Because the e-SSRs were developed from the transcribed regions of the genome, mapping e-SSR markers directly shows the location of the corresponding genes within the linkage map. Vitellogenin genes exhibit female-specific expression and are generally located on the X chromosome in various organisms, including insects.64–68 An interesting feature of the present map is that six e-SSRs derived from vitellogenin genes17 were gathered in only LG11 of the consensus map. We tested the segregation of all marker loci on LG11 and found that all the markers fitted the segregation ratio expected for genes located on the X chromosome. The results indicated that LG11 corresponds to the X-LG in BPH. The X-linked markers would be useful in future genetic analysis of the sex chromosome.4.5. Conclusions and future perspectivesIn this paper, we report the development of g-SSR, e-SSR, and SNP markers and present a preliminary genetic map for BPH based on these markers. Two individual linkage maps from the KH and CK populations were integrated into a consensus map to increase locus density and provide more dense coverage of the genome. The consensus map consisted of 518 markers that covered a total of 1093.9 cM. Denser coverage is needed to reduce the gaps and group the smallest LGs so that the consensus map matches the actual number (15) of chromosomes. Additional SNP identification and mapping should be performed in future research. It should be possible to extend the genome coverage in this manner. The mean marker distance of 2.3 cM in the consensus map may offer enough resolution for the genetic dissection of QTLs for agriculturally important traits, and particularly the virulence of BPH against the host plant. An understanding of the genetics responsible for virulence is a crucial aspect for future management of BPH. In addition, the newly developed markers can be applied in various studies of the genetics and ecology of this species at a molecular level (e.g. population genetics, migration sources, and the evolution of BPH).The primer information is available at http://sogo.dna.affrc.go.jp/cgi-bin/sogo.cgi?class=unka.

We characterized 544 genic SSR loci derived from 138 candidate genes involved in wood formation, distributed throughout the genome of Populus tomentosa, a key ecological and cultivated wood production species. Of these SSRs, three-quarters were located in the promoter or intron regions, and dinucleotide (59.7%) and trinucleotide repeat motifs (26.5%) predominated. By screening 15 wild P. tomentosa ecotypes, we identified 188 polymorphic genic SSRs with 861 alleles, 2–7 alleles for each marker. Transferability analysis of 30 random genic SSRs, testing whether these SSRs work in 26 genotypes of five genus Populus sections (outgroup, Salix matsudana), showed that 72% of the SSRs could be amplified in Turanga and 100% could be amplified in Leuce. Based on genotyping of these 26 genotypes, a neighbour-joining analysis showed the expected six phylogenetic groupings. In silico analysis of SSR variation in 220 sequences that are homologous between P. tomentosa and Populus trichocarpa suggested that genic SSR variations between relatives were predominantly affected by repeat motif variations or flanking sequence mutations. Inheritance tests and single-marker associations demonstrated the power of genic SSRs in family-based linkage mapping and candidate gene-based association studies, as well as marker-assisted selection and comparative genomic studies of P. tomentosa and related species.1. IntroductionPoplars (Populus spp.) are widely distributed all over the world and are an important commercial tree species for timber production. In addition to their important economic value, in environmental protection, poplars also play key pioneer roles in the stability and sustainability of forest ecosystems.1,2 Many members of the genus Populus have been physiologically and genetically characterized based on their desirable biological characteristics, such as rapid growth, easy transformation, modest genome size, and ability to make interspecific crosses, propagate vegetatively.1,2 Thus, poplars have become a model species for studies of angiosperm trees, particularly because the whole genome of Populus trichocarpa has been sequenced and annotated (http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Poptr1/Poptr1.home.html).1 Additional genomics resources include databases of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) (http://www.populus.db.umu.se/index.html) and simple sequence repeats (SSRs) (http://www.ornl.gov/sci/ipgc/ssr_resource.htm), and these resources not only provide data for comparison of a long-lived perennial to short-lived model plants (e.g. Arabidopsis and rice), but also offer new opportunities to explore the genetic basis of wood formation, perenniality, and dormancy.2,3The Chinese white poplar (Populus tomentosa) belongs to the section Leuce within the Populus genus and is native to northern China with a distribution zone of 1 million km2. P. tomentosa is of major commercial importance in timber and pulp production and also plays an important role in ecological and environmental protection.4 A vast amount of genetic variation has arisen during the evolution of the species, as is evident in the natural populations.5,6 This accumulated genetic variation provides an important resource for the exploration of the molecular mechanisms of wood formation and is also a source of alleles for the potential improvement of wood products. However, conventional breeding programmes may not be sufficient to improve this long-growing species.6 Modern molecular breeding tools, such as molecular marker-assisted selection (MAS) breeding, could enhance important Populus agronomic traits, including growth rate, wood quality, and disease resistance. Hence, development of suitable genetic marker resources is an important foundation for MAS breeding.Among molecular genetic markers, single nucleotide polymorphisms are often used for genetic analysis. However, DNA microsatellites, or SSR markers, are excellent genetic markers because they are hypervariable, co-dominant, and therefore highly informative.7,8 Moreover, compared with SSR markers derived from random genomic locations, SSR markers derived from genes will likely provide a much greater degree of resolution in association mapping because they occur within the gene and thus may affect gene expression or function.6,8 In addition, genic SSRs exhibit relatively high transferability to closely related species and can be used as anchor markers for comparative mapping and evolutionary studies.6–9 Gene-based microsatellites have now been developed for a limited number of Populus species based on the P. trichocarpa genome sequence.10,11 However, very limited genomic information is available for P. tomentosa,4,6,12 and as the P. tomentosa linkage map was constructed using amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs),13 functional genomics studies of this economically important species are in their infancy. Furthermore, another important approach, the use of SSRs from fully characterized genes or full-length cDNA clones has not yet been utilized in Populus.Wood quality traits are considered to be quantitative, controlled by multiple genes, with moderate-to-high heritability.14 Currently, large numbers of candidate genes involved in wood formation have been isolated from P. tomentosa using direct sequencing methods, although many have not been published.4,6,15,16 Therefore, to improve the properties of wood using a MAS approach, identification and characterization of species-specific SSR loci from wood formation-related genes is a highly promising approach. Here, we make use of the large dataset of available gene sequences to identify a large number of gene-based SSR markers for P. tomentosa. The specific aims of our study were to: (i) characterize the genic SSR loci in P. tomentosa and evaluate SSR primers and polymorphisms in different wild-type varieties, (ii) test cross-species transferability within the genus Populus and conduct in silico analysis of SSR variation between P. tomentosa and P. trichocarpa, and (iii) examine inheritance segregation in a mapping population and analyze single SSR marker–trait association in a natural population. This study provides a valuable SSR resource for comparative genomic studies of the genus Populus, and the genic microsatellites also serve as ‘framework’ markers for construction of a physical map for alignment of the ongoing sequencing of the complete P. tomentosa genome.2. Materials and methods2.1. Microsatellite identification, primer design, and SSR polymorphism screeningTotal genomic DNA was extracted from young leaves using the DNeasy Plant Mini kit (Qiagen China, Shanghai), following the manufacturer's protocol. The reference gene models of 150 candidate genes involved in wood formation were obtained by BLASTX analyses against the NCBI database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) or from the JGI database (http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Poptr1_1/Poptr1_1.home.html) (Supplementary Table S1). Subsequently, a set of specific primers was designed for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of all 150 genes, and total genomic DNA (20 ng per reaction) from the P. tomentosa LM50 clone was used for amplification. All the PCR amplification products from LM50 were sequenced (both strands) using conserved primers, the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit, version 3.1 (Applied Biosystems, Beijing, China), and a Li-Cor 4300 genetic analyzer (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, Nebraska, USA). In all, a total of 696 792 bp of genomic DNA sequences from these 150 unique candidate genes, with an average of 4645 bp per gene, were obtained by direct sequencing, and the sequence data of the 150 candidate genes generated in this study were deposited in the GenBank Data Library under the accession numbers JX986583–JX986732 (Supplementary Table S1). These sequences were mined for genic SSR markers using the SSRIT software (http://www.gramene.org/db/searches/ssrtool).17 All microsatellite loci were located exclusively in the coding and/or regulatory regions of candidate genes, i.e. exons, promoters, 5' untranslated regions (UTRs), 3' UTRs, or introns. The ideal marker contained a minimum SSR repeat of five for dinucleotide repeats, four for trinucleotide repeats, and three for tetranucleotide or longer (more than pentanucleotide) repeats. A set of compound perfect repeat units was also identified. Mononucleotide repeats and complex sequence repeats were excluded.Primer pairs specific for the SSR flanking sequences were designed using the Primer 3 program (http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/primer3/primer3.FAQ.html), according to the parameters reported by Du et al.6 All SSR primers were initially screened using genomic DNA from the P. tomentosa LM50 clone (three replications). Amplification was carried out using standard PCR conditions with annealing temperatures (Ta) set according to the primer sequences. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis in 2% agarose gels. Electrophoresis products were visualized and photographed using the Fluorchem™ 5500 (Alfa Innotech Corp., USA) gel documentation system. Finally, a subset of optimal SSR primers was identified and designated as ‘validated genic SSR markers’.All validated genic SSR markers were scored for amplicon size polymorphisms among 15 wild P. tomentosa ecotypes that represented nearly the entire P. tomentosa geographic distribution (Supplementary Table S2).4,12 Observed product sizes and numbers of alleles per locus (NA) were calculated for each marker using POPGENE, version 1.32.182.2. PCR amplification and SSR genotypingThe SSR amplification reaction system and PCR amplifications were conducted following the procedure of Du et al.6 PCR product amplification was confirmed on a 2% agarose gel, and products were then separated by capillary electrophoresis using an ABI3730xl DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). The polymorphic loci were analyzed using GeneMapper, version 4.0, with the LIZ 600 size standard (Applied Biosystems).2.3. Cross-species transferabilityTo assess cross-species transferability and allele length polymorphisms, 30 randomly selected genic SSRs were genotyped in 26 ecotypes (24 species) belonging to 5 sections of the genus Populus, using Salix matsudana as the outgroup (Supplementary Table S3).The summary statistical parameters reflected intra- and interpopulation genetic diversity levels, including the observed allele sizes, polymorphism information content (PIC), expected heterozygosity (HE), and number of alleles (NA), that were calculated for each marker using POPGENE, version 1.32. The discriminatory abilities of genic SSRs were estimated using cluster analyses to assess phylogenic relationships among related Populus species. A neighbour-joining (NJ) dendrogram was constructed using the proportion of shared alleles coefficient from PowerMarker, version 3.2519 and was drawn using TreeView version 1.66 (http://taxonomy.zoology.gla.ac.uk/rod/treeview.html).2.4. In silico analysis of SSR variationsWe used in silico identification of genic SSR variations between P. tomentosa and P. trichocarpa to validate the true SSR cross-species transferability within the genus Populus. All 220 available homologous sequences of P. trichocarpa were identified in the JGI Database, based on 220 specific amplicons with SSR markers selected from P. tomentosa candidate gene sequences. MEGA, version 5.1 (http://www.megasoftware.net/), was used to compare the amplified SSR alleles with the SSR-containing sequences between the two species (i.e. repeat length, repeat motif, and mutations in flanking sequences).2.5. Testing inheritance in a linkage-mapping populationTo test the power of these novel genic SSR markers for constructing a family-based linkage map, 30 random genic SSRs selected from the 188 polymorphic markers (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table S6) were used to examine the observed segregation of markers, using 1000 F1 progeny from a controlled hybridization between a female YX01 clone (Populus alba × Populus glandulosa) and a male LM 50 clone (P. tomentosa).12 Mendelian inheritance of microsatellite variants (alleles) was determined from the observed distribution of progeny genotypes when compared with the expected segregation ratios (1:1, 1:2:1, and 1:1:1:1), based on the hypothesized genotypes of the parents by performing a chi-squared (<U+03C7>2) test at the 0.01 probability level in SAS, version 8.2, (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).

SSR marker–trait association studies in a natural populationFor association mapping, we used 40 genic SSRs randomly selected from the set of 188 polymorphic markers (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table S6), to associate with several wood quality traits in a natural population of 460 unrelated wild-type ecotypes from the P. tomentosa clonal arboretum, established in the national nursery of Guan Xian County, Shandong Province, China (36°23''N, 115°47''E), which represent all original provenances of this species (Supplementary Table S2).4,12In the natural population, wood property traits, including microfibre angle (MFA), fibre lengths, fibre widths, and holocellulose, a-cellulose, and lignin contents were measured according to the methods described by Du et al.20 Analysis of variance of these six phenotypic traits is shown in Supplementary Table S4. These 40 random genic SSRs were applied to test the degree of resolution of genic SSRs in association with these 6 wood property traits, using the unified mixed model method (MLM) with 104 permutations in TASSEL, version 2.0.1.21,22 In this Q + K model, the relative kinship matrix (K) was obtained using TASSEL, and the population structure matrix (Q) of the covariates was identified by Du et al.12 Corrections for multiple testing were performed using the positive false discovery rate (FDR) method with 104 permutations.233. Results3.1. Frequency and distribution of genic SSR markersBy sequencing 150 candidate genes related to wood properties, we identified 544 SSR loci located in 138 (92%) unique genes from 696 792 bp total sequence, for an average of 1 SSR per 1.3 kb. The perfect SSRs were not evenly distributed, ranging from zero to seven per gene (average, 3.6), and seven loci were compound SSRs containing at least one repeat motif (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table S1).Analysis of all 544 gene-derived SSR loci revealed that dinucleotide (325, 59.7%) and trinucleotide repeat motifs (144, 26.5%) predominated, followed by tetranucleotide (33, 6.1%), hexanucleotide (13, 2.4%), and pentanucleotide (12, 2.2%) repeat motifs (Fig. 2A). Of the identified SSRs, slightly fewer than half (46.1%) were located in promoter regions, including dinucleotides (57.4%) and trinucleotides (28.7%) (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Table S5A). Conversely, in exons, 37.5% were dinucleotides and 62.5% were trinucleotides (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Table S5A). The dinucleotide repeat AT/TA was the most abundant motif detected in all genic SSRs (177, 32.6%), followed by ATT/TAA (53, 9.8%), AG/TC (49, 9.0%), CT/GA (48, 8.7%), and AAT/TTA (16, 3.0%) (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Table S5B). SSR length was most commonly 10–20 bp (70.5% of total SSRs), followed by 21–30 bp (20.9%) (Fig. 2C). The largest SSR found was a 68-bp dinucleotide repeat (AT/TA).

SSR primer design, screening, and polymorphism testingTo determine whether the SSRs varied in length, and would therefore provide a useful marker, we designed flanking primers and determined the length of each SSR by capillary electrophoresis. Primer pairs specific for flanking sequences were designed for 481 of the SSR sequences (88.5%). Using the P. tomentosa LM50 clone, 413 primer pairs (85.9%) gave successful amplification, and the remaining 68 failed to generate PCR products at any annealing temperature used (Ta), and so were excluded from further analysis (Fig. 1). Of the 413 working primer pairs, 292 (70.7%) amplified PCR products of the expected sizes; however, 65 and 20 PCR products were larger or smaller, respectively, than expected, and the remaining 36 primer pairs generated multiple PCR products (Fig. 1). Details of the 292 optimal primers, including locus names, primer sequences, SSR repeat motifs, Ta, expected sizes, SSR sources (locations in genes), and GenBank accession numbers are provided in Supplementary Table S6. Distribution summaries, frequencies, and repeat motifs of these 292 genic SSR markers are provided in Supplementary Table S7A.To identify whether the identified SSRs varied in length in P. tomentosa, these 292 primers were subjected to further screening for polymorphisms in 15 wild P. tomentosa ecotypes. Twenty four primers amplified monomorphic products (1 band), 80 markers have identical heterozygotes among all 15 individuals (2 bands), and 188 primers (64.4%) generated clean and reproducible polymorphic bands (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table S6). The observed product sizes and numbers of alleles per locus (NA) were calculated for each marker. A total of 861 unique alleles were identified (Supplementary Table S6). For the 188 polymorphic markers from 107 genes, the NA ranged from 2 to 7 with an average of 3.6 observed alleles per polymorphic locus; in other regions, the mean NA values varied between 2.4 for exons and 4.0 for promoter regions (Supplementary Tables S6 and S7B).3.3. SSR cross-species transferability within the genus PopulusTo determine the utility of this SSR marker set beyond P. tomentosa, we screened a subset of the markers to determine whether they could be amplified from other related species, including Populus and the closely related Salix species. The capacity of 30 representative P. tomentosa genic SSR primers to screen for polymorphisms was tested in 27 ecotypes of related Populus and Salix species (Supplementary Table 3). All tested SSR primer pairs displayed a high amplification frequency within and across sections at the subgenus level within Populus. Of the 30 examined SSR markers, 12 (40%) successfully amplified in all species. The transferability of the 30 primers tested in Populus sections was Leuce (100%), Tacamahaca (90%), Aigeros (83%), Leucoides (80%), and Turanga (72%) (Table 1). In S. matsudana, the frequency of amplification was lower, and only 50% yielded product (Table 1). Thus, the developed SSR markers could be applied across the genus Populus and provided data on polymorphisms among related species (Supplementary Fig. S1).

Of the 27 ecotypes, 213 alleles were detected using the 30 SSR primers, with an average of 7.0 alleles per locus, ranging from 4 at SSR62 to 11 at SSR54 (Table 1). The PIC mean polymorphism level of the loci was 0.675, and it ranged from 0.411 for SSR65 to 0.841 for SSR54 (Table 1). In the five Populus sections, the mean NA values were from 1.1 (Leucoides) to 3.7 (Leuce). The other diversity parameters (observed lengths and HE) are shown in Table 1.We also tested whether these markers were informative for genetic analysis by determining whether the marker genotypes could be used to recapitulate the known phylogenetic relationship among the tested ecotypes. The NJ tree (Fig. 3) based on the shared allele coefficients from these 30 SSRs revealed the expected genetic relationships among all 27 ecotypes and clustered them into 6 main groups, in agreement with 5 putative sections, and the outgroup was derived from the basic botanical classification of these tree species.10,24,25 The relationships among species in each section are represented by the smaller branches within groups. In addition, we constructed trees based on the other functions in PowerMarker, and these were very similar to the NJ tree (Fig. 3) in that the six distinct clusters were again present, although there were slight differences in branch lengths within clusters (data not shown).

Comparison of SSR variation between P. tomentosa and P. trichocarpaIn addition to testing a subset of markers in multiple Populus and Salix species, we also examined these markers more extensively in the sequenced genome of P. trichocarpa. For all 292 genic SSR-containing sequences, only 75% (220) of homologous P. trichocarpa sequences (length, 90–593 bp) were identified (Fig. 1). Alignment and comparison of the homologous sequences between these two species for each marker revealed 10 types of mutations and variations in SSR loci and their flanking regions (Table 2 and Fig. 4). For example, the SSR53 locus, which contains an imperfect (CT) motif, showed complex mutations characterized by variation in the repeat-motif length and point mutations in both the repeat motif and the flanking sequences (data not shown). Of all 220 genic SSRs, 39.1% (86) were present in P. trichocarpa, with 57 showing only variation in repeat number in both species (conserved flanking sequences) and 29 that were monomorphic and had conserved sequences between the 2 species (Table 2). However, 41.8% (92) had polymorphisms of the SSR flanking sequences between the two species, suggesting that these SSR markers from P. tomentosa are not directly transferable to P. trichocarpa (Table 2). A comparison of the SSR markers with mutations in flanking sequences showed the highest proportion in 3'UTRs (60.0%) and the lowest in 5'UTRs (25.8%). A total of 25 new SSR markers were identified in the corresponding sequences of P. trichocarpa, of which 17 (68%) were derived from promoter regions (Table 2). Additionally, 100% of SSR markers from exon regions could be directly employed in genetic studies of P. trichocarpa (Table 2).

Ten types of mutations and variations for genic SSR loci with their flanking regions were identified (See Table 2 for details).Alignment and comparison of variations and mutations in genic SSRs with sequences homologous between P. tomentosa (01) and P. trichocarpa (02), based on a number of genic SSRs. Ten types of mutations and variations for genic SSR loci with their flanking regions were identified (See Table 2 for details).We determined whether the mutations in SSR repeat motifs were transitions, transversions, insertions, or deletions related to the P. tomentosa–P. trichocarpa comparison. An insertion of even a single base in the repeat motif, e.g. (AT)5 T (AT)3, and a deletion within the repeat tract, e.g. (AGG)3 AG_ (AGG)2, disrupted the continuity of the perfect repeat units. Transversions (38/63) were the most abundant mutations in the sequences of these two species, whereas insertions (4/63) were the least abundant (Table 3). Transitions and/or transversions accounted for 86% of the total mutations in the perfect repeats, whereas insertions and/or deletions were found in only 14%. T/C transversions were the most common substitutions that disrupted repeat continuity (Table 3).

Inheritance test of genic SSR markersTo further validate the usefulness of these genic SSR markers in genetic studies, we genotyped a randomly selected subset of 30 of the markers in a linkage mapping population of 1000 progeny from a controlled hybridization and tested for Mendelian segregation. Of the 30 genic SSRs, 5 loci (17%) were not used for analysis due to the presence of null alleles or unexpected lengths in the female parent. The remaining 25 loci segregated in the population (Table 4). Of the segregating loci, 2 were heterozygous in the female parent only, 4 were heterozygous in the male parent only, 17 were heterozygous in both parents, and 2 (SSR211 and SSR249) were homozygous in both parents, and thus resulted in offspring identical to the parents and with the expected heterozygote genotype (Table 4). Mendelian inheritance patterns of 30 genic SSR markers based on segregation analyses of a cross between a female YX01 clone (P. alba × P. glandulosa) and a male LM 50 clone (P. tomentosa)See Supplementary Table S6 for further details of these 30 genic SSR markers.‘P1’ represents the female clone ‘YX01’ (P. alba × P. glandulosa), ‘P2’ represents the male clone ‘LM 50’ (P. tomentosa), ‘+’ represents heterozygote, and ‘–’ represents homozygote; the <U+03C7>2 significance level was P < 0.01, Ns, not significant; /, Not applied.Mendelian inheritance patterns of 30 genic SSR markers based on segregation analyses of a cross between a female YX01 clone (P. alba × P. glandulosa) and a male LM 50 clone (P. tomentosa)See Supplementary Table S6 for further details of these 30 genic SSR markers.‘P1’ represents the female clone ‘YX01’ (P. alba × P. glandulosa), ‘P2’ represents the male clone ‘LM 50’ (P. tomentosa), ‘+’ represents heterozygote, and ‘–’ represents homozygote; the <U+03C7>2 significance level was P < 0.01, Ns, not significant; /, Not applied.A chi-squared test was used to compare the segregation ratios of the 23 informative markers in these 1000 offspring. Eighteen were in accordance with Mendelian expectations (P = 0.01), with a segregation ratio close to 1:2:1 for 3 SSR loci, 1:1 for 5 loci, and 1:1:1:1 for the remaining 10 markers (Table 4). Thus, these novel genic SSR markers may represent a useful resource for linkage mapping in P. tomentosa.3.6. Genic SSR polymorphisms associated with wood property traitsFinally, to directly show that these markers could also prove useful for association mapping, we conducted a trial association mapping study using a subset of the genic SSRs to associate with traits affecting wood properties in Populus. For a random selection of 40 genic SSRs, single-marker association tests (240; 40 SSRs × 6 traits) were conducted using MLM. Twenty associations were found to be significant at a threshold of P < 0.05 (Supplementary Table S8). Multiple test corrections using the FDR method reduced this number to 12 at a significance threshold of Q < 0.10 (Table 5). These loci accounted for the phenotypic variance, with individual effects ranging from 4.0 to 8.9% (Table 5). Of these, a-cellulose and fibre length had three significant associations each, and holocellulose, MFA, and lignin had two significant associations each. However, no association with fibre width was detected (Q < 0.10, Table 5). The 12 associations represent 9 SSR loci from different regions of 9 candidate genes (Table 5). For example, SSR205 was located in the coding region (PtoC4H1 exon 1) that was associated exclusively with lignin (R2 = 8.9%, Q = 0.0211) (Table 5). For the holocellulose trait, SSR47 and SSR163, located in the non-coding regions of two candidate genes (PtoKorB and PtoCslA4), accounted for 4.3–8.7% of the phenotypic variance, and the SSR47 marker was similarly associated with a-cellulose content (Table 5). Significant SSR marker–trait pair associations in the natural P. tomentosa population (n = 460), after correction for multiple testing [FDR (Q) = 0.10]P = the significant level for association (the significance is P = 0.05); R2 = percentage of the phenotypic variance explained; Lignin = lignin content; Holocellulose = holocellulose content; and a-cellulose = a-cellulose content.Significant SSR marker–trait pair associations in the natural P. tomentosa population (n = 460), after correction for multiple testing [FDR (Q) = 0.10]P = the significant level for association (the significance is P = 0.05); R2 = percentage of the phenotypic variance explained; Lignin = lignin content; Holocellulose = holocellulose content; and a-cellulose = a-cellulose content.4. Discussion4.1. Development and characterization of genic SSR markersHere, we used a candidate gene approach to identify a set of SSR markers in P. tomentosa genes for wood properties, showing that this approach can provide useful genomics resources for linkage or association mapping and eventually for marker-assisted breeding to improve wood quality in this important timber crop. We successfully mined for genic SSRs in the sequences of 150 candidate genes associated with wood property traits. Our analysis of these SSR markers from P. tomentosa demonstrated that this approach may be useful for characterization of other pathways in P. tomentosa and for development of molecular markers for related model species with similar genomic resources. In our study, the frequency of genic SSRs was ~1 SSR/1.3 kb. Higher or lower frequencies of genic SSRs have been reported elsewhere.11,26,27 However, these frequency variations may be the result of the application of different SSR search criteria, methods, or the abundances of the sources of DNA sequences searched.8Dinucleotide motifs were the most abundant genic SSR markers (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Table S5A). This result is in contrast to previous findings identifying trinucleotide motifs as the most frequent genic repeats in most plant species,8,28,29 which may be attributable to the sources of the DNA sequences used (i.e. EST, cDNA, or gene sequences). In general, previous genic SSR makers were located in EST databases, and information about promoters and introns was not considered. Genic microsatellites are located mainly in promoters, introns, and UTRs of sequenced genes and are found at a lower frequency in conserved exons.8 This agrees with the distribution pattern we report here (Fig. 2A), suggesting that genic microsatellites may have a role in regulation of gene expression.8,11,28–30 Furthermore, polymorphism tests of 15 wild P. tomentosa ecotypes indicated that exonic SSRs contained less allelic variability than did non-coding SSRs (Supplementary Table S7B), which reflects the higher selection pressure on the coding portion of the genome.31,32Our analysis of gene-derived SSRs found that SSRs with AT/TA motifs (32.6%) were the most frequent. This is similar to the cases of P. trichocarpa and Arachis hypogaea.25,33 Previous studies have indicated that (AT)n is the most common dinucleotide motif in plant genomes.8,33 Thus, the genic SSR pattern identified in this study is likely to be a good reflection of genome-wide SSR frequencies. In trinucleotide SSRs, the polymorphism rate of the ATT/TAA SSRs is three times higher than that of AAT/TTA SSRs. This distribution suggests that AT-rich SSR loci may have a relatively high variability in P. tomentosa and also confirms the finding that AT-rich repeats (those repeats containing two or more A and/or T nucleotides per motif) are more common in non-coding regions.9,17,25,34In this study, 91.8% of the 292 optimal genic SSR primers produced at least 2 clean amplified bands, possibly due to the naturally occurring excess of heterozygotes in the P. tomentosa genome.12 Allelic diversity estimated for these polymorphic markers was an average of 3.6 alleles per locus, (range 2–7 alleles), and the value is lower than the NA (4.3) in a population of 460 P. tomentosa and some other related species, such as Populus nigra, P. trichocarpa, Populus tremuloides, and Populus euphratica.6,35,36 The level of allelic diversity reported in this study may be due to the limited sample size and/or the relatively conserved character of genic SSR markers. For generation of genetic maps, genic SSRs can determine the relative positions of transferable markers and directly compare candidate gene-containing SSRs and quantitative trait locus (QTL) locations across a broad variety of genetic backgrounds.8,25,29,32 The result of inheritance tests for 30 genic SSR markers suggests that many genic SSRs can be used for linkage mapping in P. tomentosa, and they are also useful for QTL and marker-aided selection of important traits. In addition, segregation distortion is increasingly recognized as a potentially powerful evolutionary force that may be beneficial for QTL mapping.37,38 The actual causes of the observed segregation distortions for markers are genes subjected to gametic or zygotic selection.37 Studies have suggested that epistasis contributes to segregation distortion, and segregation distortion may also be important for the evolution of many fundamental aspects of sexual reproduction.37–39The presence of SSRs in transcribed regions can result in changes in function, transcription, or translation. For example, SSRs in coding regions that result in amino acid changes can cause either loss or gain of function, SSRs in the 5'UTR can affect gene transcription or translation, SSRs in the 3'UTR can be responsible for gene silencing or transcription slippage, and SSRs in introns might act as transcriptional enhancers of gene expression.8,32,40 Previous study that phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) transcripts have been localized to develop xylem cells in aspen (P. tremuloides) stem, was consistent with its involvement in lignin biosynthesis.41 This report supported the identification of a single-marker non-coding association in PtoPAL2 that explained 4.6% of the phenotypic variation in lignin content (Table 5). Cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H1) is proposed to be associated with G lignin deposition,42,43 and a marker with significant association was located in the coding region (PtoC4H1 exon 1) that was associated exclusively with lignin (R2 = 8.9%, Q = 0.0211) (Table 5). Physiological studies of C4H genes describe unique functions for the isoforms within the lignin biosynthetic pathway.43 Similarly, other significant associations located in different candidate genes, such as sucrose synthase (SUSY), Cellulase (KOR), and Cinnamoyl-CoA reductase (CCR) (Table 5), were also supported by studies finding that they were involved in lignocellulosic cell wall development.3,14–16,43–45 Association analysis in this study suggests that genic SSRs have considerable power in candidate gene-based association studies to identify allelic variation in genes associated with important wood quality traits,20 and these markers have the potential to be useful in genetic improvement of lignin and cellulose biosynthesis in poplar.4.2. SSR variation among related species within the genus PopulusThe genus Populus contains six subgenera: Abaso, Leuce, Leucoides, Aigeiros, Turanga, and Tacamahaca, and Turanga is the most distant from Leuce.10,24,25,46,47 We found that genic SSR markers in P. tomentosa have relatively high amplification rates among closely related taxa, including species of the Leuce, Tacamahaca, Aigeiros, and Leucoides sections, but a lower amplification rate in Turanga (Table 1). This successful amplification rate in different sections was positively correlated with mean NA and PIC values (Table 1) that are due mainly to the phylogenetic divergence from P. tomentosa and is also related to the sampling species and their genetic backgrounds in each section. Furthermore, the amplification success rates were higher for members of the other subgenera, with the exception of Turanga (Table 1), suggesting that the amplification frequency varies in tandem with evolutionary distance, and this may be because the flanking regions of the microsatellite, where the PCR primers bind to the DNA, are more similar in phylogenetically close species than phylogenetically distant species.10,17,25,32 It should, therefore, be possible to predict the utility of these primers according to the genetic distance from P. tomentosa.Six distinct groups were identified within 27 samples, based on 30 genic SSR markers (Fig. 3). The dendrogram grouping showed the expected segregation of the different sections within the genus Populus, which agreed with the subgenus botanical classification level of Salicaceae,24,25,46,47 although a few species were not identified based on their putative relationships or as reported in other diversity studies.46,47 For example, Populus bolleana is a variety of Populusalba; however, these species did not group together in the closest branches, despite their shared ancestry (Fig. 3). Overall, this analysis roughly supports the botanical classification of the germplasm surveyed and hints at the usefulness of the genic SSR markers for genetic diversity studies and other Populus genotyping applications.In a comparison of genic SSR variations using homologous P. tomentosa and P. trichocarpa sequences (Table 2), we identified both repeat motif variations and mutations in the flanking sequences in most markers, and this shows that microsatellite mutation patterns are often complex in cross-species amplification. However, our findings indicate that the effects of mutations accumulated over evolutionary time can readily be studied. Point mutations disrupted the repeat pattern, and in addition to a new class of repeat motifs, size variations at microsatellite loci caused by indels (insertions or deletions) in flanking sequences have also been reported.32,40,48,49 We found the highest proportion of SSRs with mutations in flanking sequences in the 3'UTR (60.0%) and the lowest in the 5'UTR (25.8%). This suggests that variations and mutations in microsatellites may be influenced by the nature and functional composition of the flanking sequences.48,49 Transitions and/or transversions accounted for 86% of the total mutations of perfect repeat motifs in the two species (Table 3), indicating that base substitution of microsatellites is more common than length variation of homologous loci between closely related species.49 It also suggests that base substitution data are vital because genotyping using SSR alleles among related species is often erroneous, if based only on microsatellites of identical allele lengths obtained in electrophoresis. In silico identification of genic SSR variations in Populus is particularly useful for evolutionary studies and for increasing our understanding of the origin, mutational processes, and structure of microsatellites. Further reciprocal studies of microsatellite allelic variation in different species would shed additional light on directional evolution and genetic toxicology.40,48Overall, the reliability of comparison of microsatellite variation data among related species is higher than cross-species amplification success rates or polymorphisms. Comparison of microsatellite variation in these two species suggests that use of cross-species SSR primers to investigate functionally important allelic polymorphisms related to the traits of interest may be inefficient. Therefore, the direct development of species-specific primers is necessary for association mapping, due to the variation in repeat number only at each SSR locus (conserved flanking sequences) among all individuals of the same species.Supplementary DataSupplementary Data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.This work was supported by the State Key Basic Research Program of China (No. 2012CB114506), and the Project of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31170622, 30872042).Supplementary data"

A growing number of expression data deposited in databases provide us with the raw material for screening such chimaeric transcripts and using them as the probes to identify interactions between genes in cis or in trans. Based on the high-quality chimaeric transcripts gleaned from human expression sequence tag data with selection criteria, we identified the patterns of inter- and intrachromosomal gene–gene interactions. On top the contact pattern from interchromosomal interactions, we also observed an exponential behaviour of the intrachromosomal interactions within a certain length scale, which is consistent with the independent experimental results from Hi-C screening and with the Random Loop Model. A compatible result is found for mouse. Transcription-induced chimaeric transcripts, most of which might be accidental products with trivial functions, shed light on the spatial organization of chromosomes. These inter- and intrachromosomal interactions might contribute to the compaction of chromosomes, their segregation and formation of the chromosome territories, and their spatial distribution within the nucleus.1. IntroductionTranscription-induced chimerism (TIC)1 gives rise to chimaeric transcripts consisting of heterogeneous sequence segments originating from distant regions on the same chromosome or from two or more distinct chromosomes. Chimaeric transcripts from large-scale transcription databases were previously considered as contaminants. However, the increasing number of chimaeric transcripts has indeed been verified in vivo.2 Thus, there is good reason to take chimaeric transcripts seriously. Trans-splicing-mediated chimaeric transcripts have been widely observed in a variety of organisms. Trans-splicing is more frequently observed in lower unicellular eukaryotes and Caenorhabditis elegans and shows physiological significances.3,4 One of the most prominent examples involves Ciona intestinalis, in which the number of non-trans-spliced and trans-spliced genes is approximately equivalent.5 In Drosophila and mammalian cells, however, trans-splicing is less common, and the functional importance of most trans-spliced products is unclear.6,7 Later, Li et al. proposed a transcriptional-slippage model in light of short homologous sequences (SHSs) at junction sites in between fusion sequences.8Although most chimaera from higher eukaryotes are non-functional, those potentially encoded fusion genes could exert negative effects by competing with their parental genes,9 or serving as an oncogenic transcription factor via mistargeting on the chromosome, and altering chromatin structure.10 It is assumed that chimaeric transcripts expressed in normal and transformed cell might be mediated by two distinct mechanisms (transcription induced or chromosomal translocation induced),11 either of which might involve physical proximity between gene loci. It is reasonable to assume that because different sequence modules of transcription-induced chimaeric transcripts need to be conjugated, their expression should be concomitant, and that distinct pre-RNA products should be confined in a specific cell subcompartment with close three-dimensional (3D) proximity. The candidate of such structure might be the transcription factory.12 The fact that fewer transcription factories exist than the number of expressed genes indicates that multiple actively expressed genes need to share the same transcriptional machinery and that genes separated by a long genomic distance can migrate to each other closely.13 Thus, spatial proximity of distinct transcripts in the transcription factories might facilitate the production of chimaeric transcripts that in turn can be used as the signal of chromosome loci contact.Various polymer models have been postulated to describe the folding of compact but flexible chromatin fibre, which is crucial to gene expression activity.14 Among these models, the fractal globule model15 proposes that chromatin is folded initially into crumples and repeatedly into crumples-of-crumples. Some experimental support for this model comes from the in vivo screening on the chromatin contact with the Hi-C method developed by Lieberman-Aiden et al.16 An alternative view comes from studies,17–19 where a chromosome is viewed as an all scales-looped polymer.From the evidence presently available, a fusion process of heterogeneous transcripts is closely related to the spatial proximity of actively transcribed genes. In 2007, Unneberg et al. published the mapping results of transcription-induced interchromosomal interactions using the chimaeric expression sequence tag (EST) as the probe.20 After that, the increased number of data deposited in the databases has made possible a comprehensive study of chimaera and its relation to the 3D organization of chromosomes. Here, with chimaeric transcripts gleaned from human and mouse EST databases, we test the idea of TIC in terms of gene pairs' co-expression pattern. Comparing with normalized Hi-C contact maps21 also confirms that these chimaeric genes are more likely to be physically proximal. Unlike the previous study result,20 we show that the arrangement of chromosomes within the cell nucleus is non-random. No evident changes, however, can be observed from the interchromosomal interaction patterns of normal and the tumour cells. Based on the gene pairs located at every single chromosome, we obtain the relationship between the genomic distance and the gene contact frequencies. A functional behaviour (<U+2060><U+2060>, where  is the probability of contact between two loci that are genomically separated by x base pairs) is observed from our data with the genomic distance ranging from 500 to 7–8 Mb and an exponent a = -1 on a double logarithmic plot that agrees with the experimental results from Hi-C screening.162. Materials and methods2.1. Chimaeric transcripts identificationmRNA data were gathered from gbEST, gbHTC, and gbPRI divisions of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Genbank database (Release 186). Genome sequences of human and mouse were downloaded from NCBI Genome database (Release 37). EST library annotation was obtained from NCBI ftp as well. Gene annotation was downloaded from Ensembl genome database (Version 64).We used BLAT22 for sequence alignment, with the minimal identity threshold of 95% and the rest of the parameters at their default values. After aligning, alignments in each query were sorted according to the score and then the identity.Similar to previous studies,8,20 we picked out the queries with top two ranked alignments having the sequences identity not <U+02C2>95% and minimal alignment length not <U+02C2>50 bp for gbEST sequences. For much longer gbHTC and gbPRI sequences, a threshold of 100 bp was used. A 10 bp overlapping at the binding site of the query was allowed because of the uncertainty in aligning. To make sure that the two best alignments in a query were unambiguously aligned, a uniqueness criterion was imposed.20 Chimaeric transcripts with their boundary sites containing recognition sequences of the restriction enzymes used for library construction were removed. Similar to a previous study,8 SHSs on the boundary sites of these retained transcripts were checked.2.2. Gene mappingWe mapped the fusion sequences onto the chromosomes according to the Ensembl Genome database and selected transcripts whose partners were both mapped onto the gene regions with the same directions as the annotation. For sequences with both partners mapped with the opposite directions of the corresponding genes, we re-evaluated their directions according to the GT/AG rule. Considering the possibility of tandem transcription or intergenic splicing, we removed the chimaeric transcripts in cis with genomic distance between gene loci smaller than 500 kb.2.3. Co-expression pattern of the chimaeric gene partnersCo-expression pattern of human and mouse genes was obtained from COXPRESdb (Version 4.1),23 in which genes were indexed by their Entrez Gene IDs, and the Mutual Rank (MR) score was used as a measure for gene co-expression correlation. R package ‘biomaRt’ (Version 2.10.0) was used to convert the Ensembl Gene IDs of those mapped genes to the Entrez Gene IDs. To check whether the co-expression correlation of gene pairs in the chimaeric transcripts is non-preferential, MR scores of all possible gene pairs were used as a background.2.4. Comparison with normalized Hi-C contact patternWe used normalized Hi-C contact pattern of human lymphoblast generated by Yaffe et al.21 The ratio of the observed to the expected contact number in each 1 Mb bin was transferred by the logarithm to base 2 as a measurement of contact enhancement. The larger the enhancement value for a bin pair is, the more the contacts between them can be observed than by chance. Consequently, an enhanced contact probability indicates a closer spatial relationship. Gene pairs of the chimaeric transcripts were mapped onto the corresponding bins of the chromosomes, and the enhancement was screened. For genes spanning over more than one bin, the contact enhancement was calculated by averaging weighted contact enhancement for each 1 Mb bin pair covered. The enhancement distributions of all possible inter- and intracontacts were used as backgrounds. The Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was applied to check the difference of the contact enhancement between chimaeric gene pairs and the background.2.5. Inter- and intrachromosomal interactions pattern analysisChimaeric transcripts extracted from the gbEST database were used for interaction pattern analysis. Chimaeras involving the same gene partners were grouped together so as to remove the overcounts. We picked out transcripts composed of two genes labelled by ‘protein coding’ biotype in the human Ensembl database, which were far more abundant than others, as the observed interchromosomal interaction pattern. We collected the frequencies of contact between two given chromosomes to obtain the interaction matrix and plotted the data as a heat map. From the human Ensembl database, we obtained the frequencies of protein coding genes on 23 chromosomes except chromosome Y. With these expected gene frequencies, we constructed a random matrix of chromosome pair-wise interaction by multiplying the gene frequencies from any two given chromosomes. For this symmetric matrix, each element in the upper half of the matrix was multiplied by a random number, and the corresponding element in the lower half was assigned the same value. This finished a shuffle step on the interaction pattern, and the eigenvalue of the matrix was calculated. Totally, 105 steps were carried out. After that, the mean eigenvalue was obtained and plotted against the eigenvalue from the observation. Furthermore, based on the cell source annotation from the human EST library report, we separated the interactions from normal cells from those from tumour cells and plotted the eigenvalue of interaction for comparison.For intrachromosomal interactions, we made statistics on the frequencies of the gene–gene interaction under given genomic distance within every chromosome and plotted the frequencies of the interactions versus the genomic distance in a double logarithmic plot. For human, the contact probabilities were divided by their corresponding genomic distance for normalization and replotted against the genomic distance.3. Results and discussion3.1. Chimaeric transcripts validation and genome mappingThe number of chimaera selected from gbEST, gbPRI, and gbHTC databases is given in Table 1. Detailed information about the validated chimaeric transcripts can be found in the Supplementary Data. We analysed the distribution of human chimaeric transcripts among the EST libraries. Of 8995 human libraries screened, 2617 (29%) were involved in the production of chimaera, and none of them overlapped with those highly contaminated libraries.24 As shown in Fig. 1A, most libraries contributed very few chimaera. One thousand one hundred and eleven and 518 libraries from a total of 2617 human libraries provided only one and two chimaera, respectively. A compatible result is found for mouse (Fig. 1B). Such a result indicates that chimaera formation is an ubiquitous event with low frequency. Summary of the chimaeric transcripts identified from different databasesThe GG column represents the number of chimaeric transcripts whose partners were both mapped onto the gene regions with the same directions as the annotation. The UG column indicates the unique gene pairs identified from chimaeric transcripts of gene–gene interaction. The genes column corresponds to the number of genes participating in the chimaera production. Under GG, UG, and genes columns, left subcolumns indicate the number for interchromosomal interaction and the right ones denote intrachromosomal interaction. The size column shows the average length (unit in base pairs) of validated inter- and intrachromosomal chimaeric transcripts. And, the overlap column indicates the number of chimaeric gene pairs identified from the gbHTC or gbPRI database, which can also be found at the gbEST database.Summary of the chimaeric transcripts identified from different databasesThe GG column represents the number of chimaeric transcripts whose partners were both mapped onto the gene regions with the same directions as the annotation.

(A) for human and (B) for mouse. The x-axis represents the number of chimaera that can be identified from single library. The y-axis indicates the number of libraries producing the corresponding amount of chimaeric ESTs.From validated chimaera, most gene interactions were observed only once, whereas some gene partners associated with each other more frequently. In addition, some of these reoccurring chimaera can be identified from multiple different EST libraries, whereas other repeats originated only from a single library. Detailed mapping results are shown in Table 1. The abundance of SHSs with different size is shown in Supplementary Fig. S1.3.2. Co-expression pattern of the chimaeric gene partnersOf the total of 8934 validated human chimaeric transcripts, 7412 gene partners with both genes Entrez Gene IDs known were collected. For mouse, 2229 gene pairs were obtained from 2453 chimaeras. As shown in Fig. 2, gene pairs from the chimaeric transcripts associated more frequently with small MR score than with a large one, when compared with the co-expression pattern of all possible gene pairs. This observation revealed that gene pairs producing chimaeric transcripts showed stronger positive correlation in terms of their expression activities. This observation further supported the assumption that lots of identified chimaeric transcripts, if not all were transcription induced.2Co-expression pattern of genes from the chimaeric transcripts.

Comparison with normalized Hi-C contact patternFrom the enhancement distributions shown in Fig. 3, both for inter- and intrachromosomal chimaeric transcripts, a shift towards larger enhancement can be seen with either kind of restriction enzyme. For intrachromosomal contacts, a large enhancement can be see for the tail, i.e. for gene pairs that are several mega base far away. Although the occurrence of long-range interactions is relatively low, their contact probabilities are much higher than expectation, which suggests a closer spatial distance between genome regions involved. From the cumulative distribution function (CDF) curves shown in Supplementary Fig. S2, one can clearly see that the CDF of observation lies below that of background, which indicates that a higher contact probability between chimaeric genes is given over that of the random case.

Interchromosomal interaction patternWe picked out the unique ‘protein coding’ cases of interchromosomal gene interactions (for human, 6999 out of 8261 transcripts) and plotted these as a heat map (Fig. 4A), according to where the chromosomes' gene partner was localized. As illustrated by the ‘protein coding’ gene frequencies on human chromosomes (as shown in Fig. 4B), the interactions between chromosomes with higher gene content show a correlation as well. Because the expression data were collected from a variety of cells with different types and developmental stages, it cannot easily be determined whether or not there is a preference on the interaction of given chromosome pairs. But, what is evident is that the observed pattern is different from the pattern achieved from random interaction. This comparison can mathematically be done by comparing the eigenvalues of the heat maps viewed as matrices (Fig. 5A). Interchromosomal interaction pattern for human chromosomes. (A) Contacts as a heat map of human interchromosomal gene interactions. Protein-coding genes were used as a measure of interactions.

None of the eigenvalues from the observed pattern fell into the corresponding confidence interval. (B) Patterns from human normal cells and tumour cells (excluding the chromosome Y).Comparison of interchromosomal interaction patterns via eigenvalue.

None of the eigenvalues from the observed pattern fell into the corresponding confidence interval. (B) Patterns from human normal cells and tumour cells (excluding the chromosome Y).Furthermore, we separated the chimaera according to the cell sources from which they originate (normal or tumour cell lines). Then, we constructed the interaction matrix and tried to compare the patterns from normal and tumour cell lines. For both cases, we acquired ~3500 chimaera. A slight difference is observed for normal and tumour cells, but the correlation coefficient between the eigenvalues of two contact matrices is computed as 0.998, which indicates that two contact patterns are by and large the same (Fig. 5B). Especially to the chromosomal translocation-mediated fusion transcripts in tumour cells, the ‘contact-first’ model and the ‘breakage-first’ model have been postulated.25 Under either scenario, a spatial proximity effect is obvious.25 Consequently, both chromosomal translocation-mediated and transcription-mediated fusion transcripts can be used to indicate the physical proximities between genes. Through a literature curation, we found that two gene pairs (RGS17/TBL1XR1 and BCAS3/BCAS4) identified from the human ESTs libraries have been verified to be spatially proximate by fluorescence in situ hybridization experiments.26,27 Chimaeric transcripts involved are listed in the Supplementary Data.3.5. Intrachromosomal interaction patternFor the intrachromosomal gene loci interaction data, we calculated the frequencies of gene–gene interactions for given genomic distances. The genomic distances between gene partners ranged from 509 Kb to 244.4 Mb. We plotted the probability of contact versus the genomic distance between gene partners on a double logarithmic plot. Two different types of behaviour can be observed. Below the distance of 7–8 Mb, a functional  exists with an exponent a = -1 (see the double logarithmic plot shown in Fig. 6). Above this distance, a quite different pattern is observed. The rapid drop for large genomic distances might result from the limitation of interaction data when the genomic distance is increased. To our surprise, a comparable pattern was observed for mouse as well, even though its EST coverage is not as high as that of human. With caution, we speculate that a general strategy for chromatin compaction might be utilized in mammalian cells. On account of the difference in the contact probability of chromatin with different length, we normalized the contact frequencies by the genomic distance and replotted the pattern of human. After normalization, as shown in Supplementary Fig. S3, under relative short genomic distance, the contact probability remains stable. When the genomic distance is increased, the contact probability rises until a plateau is reached. The dropping at the end might be due to the data depletion.

Confidence intervals(95%) of the slopes are shown.3.6. DiscussionFrom the human and mouse EST databases, we identified chimaeric transcripts with verification. Based on what we currently know about TIC and transcription factories, ‘genuine’ chimaera of this kind, functional or not, might originate from product interactions while being transcribed. A further analysis on the co-expression pattern of gene pairs in the examined chimaeric products revealed a strong correlation in their expression. To make the expression of chimaeric gene partners synchronous, two gene loci might be recruited to the same transcription factory, which, in turn, would decrease their spatial distance and increase the possibility of their aberrant ligation. This observation further supports the assumption of TIC1 and the role of the transcription factories in gene transcription events,12,13 as well.Some chimaeric gene pairs in cis or in trans have been experimentally confirmed to be spatially proximate.26,27 To further validate the spatial association of these chimaeric gene pairs, we checked the contact probability of chromosomal regions, where chimaeric genes localize. Although only a normalized contact map of human lymphoblast is available so far, we still can see contact enhancement between some chimaeric genes. Considering the difference in expression profile of different cell lines, chimaeric gene pairs collected from other cell lines might not be actively expressed in the lymphoblast, which meets no requirement of the TIC. Thus, more chromosome contact maps from diverse cell lines would be helpful to confirm the spatial proximity of these chimaeric gene pairs. On the other hand, however, it is not necessary for each chimaeric gene pair to be functionally related. Considering the fact that a limited amount of the transcriptional factories exists in the cell nucleus, genes sharing the same transcriptional apparatus might just be temporal related.For the time being, it is still too early to draw definitive conclusions about interchromosomal interaction pattern, but a probabilistic non-random arrangement of chromosomes seems plausible in mammalian cell nucleus.28 From our observation, what can be confirmed at present is that the chromosomes pair-wise association pattern is not random, when compared with the pattern with chromosomes distributed arbitrarily. Some researches have shown that the relative arrangements of some chromosomes are conserved and independent of cell types, whereas others seem to be cell-type specific.29 The same is true with regard to the chromosomal rearrangement in tumour cell, a cell line in which disease-related fashion was observed.29 The observation that some chimaeric transcripts can be expressed in genetically rearranged cells and in normal cells raises the possibility that such physical proximity between gene loci might be preserved after the chromosomal translocation. This might be an explanation of the slight difference detected from the interchromosomal interaction patterns of normal and tumour cell lines.The pattern reflected by the intrachromosomal loci interaction is very informative. From 500 to 7–8 Mb, the interaction probability shows a specific mathematical form (i.e. an exponential form) that is consistent with the data from chromosome conformation capture experiments. Thus, at this scale, the architecture of chromatin folding fits well with the experimental results16 and with a model recently proposed.17,30 In mouse, although it has fewer data, a coarse pattern compatible with that from human is seen as well. For the complexity of higher eukaryotic nucleus, the genomes must be well organized, covering several different length scales to keep an ordered but flexible architecture and to exert their functions properly. The strategy used by mammals for chromosome organization might be conserved across the species. Furthermore, the pattern shown after distance normalization indicated that a basal folding schema might exist. This basal form of condensation might organize the chromatin fibre into a series of units for subsequent folding. Due to the increase in the stiffness and the bulk size of the chromatin fibre after folding, the contact probability rises along with the extended genomic distance.Supplementary dataSupplementary Data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingS.L. gratefully acknowledges funding from the Heinz-Goetze-Foundation and the Heidelberg Graduate School of Mathematical and Computational Methods for the Sciences.The authors appreciate here the assistance from M.

Most current literatures have focused on one form of cell aggregation termed flocculation and its major molecular determinants, the flocculation (FLO) family genes. Here, we implemented a map-based approach for dissecting the molecular basis of non-sexual cell aggregation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Genome-wide mapping has identified four major quantitative trait loci (QTL) underlying nature variation in the cell aggregation phenotype. High-resolution mapping following up with knockout and allele replacement experiments resolved the QTL into the underlying genes (AMN1, RGA1, FLO1, and FLO8) or even into the causative nucleotide. Genetic variation in the QTL genes can explain up to 46% of phenotypic variation of this trait. Of these genes, AMN1 plays the leading role, differing from the FLO family members, in regulating expression of cell clumping phenotype through inducing cell segregation defect. These findings provide novel insights into the molecular mechanism of how cell aggregation is regulated in budding yeast, and the data will be directly implicated to understand the molecular basis and evolutionary implications of cell aggregation in other fungus species.1. IntroductionEukaryotic cells possess a remarkable capacity to aggregate together and form into a clump, which is crucial for the assembly of tissues and nervous systems, embryonic development, and cellular communication. Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the single-cell eukaryote, is also able to agglomerate cells into organized structures such as flocs, biofilm, and pseudohyphae. These non-sexual clumps create protective shields for cells in inner parts to escape from abiotic/biotic attacks,1 respond to nutrient starvation,2,3 and have been widely used in industrial productions.4 Thus, understanding the underlying mechanisms of the cellular behaviour has significant medical and evolutionary implications. However, most studies in the literature have focused on flocculation, a non-sexual type of cell clumping, induced by interaction between cell wall glycoproteins encoded by highly homologous flocculation (FLO) genes (FLO1, FLO5, FLO9, and FLO10).5,6 In particular, FLO1 was reported to be a key gene whose expression led to strong flocculation1 and was transcriptionally activated by FLO8.7,8 So far, these studies followed a reverse genetic approach to screen for the flocculins that bound specific sugar residues on the surface of other cells and led to formation of cell flocs.9,10 However, the reverse approach has been debated for its requirement of prior information on the underlying pathways leading to phenotypic expression of the traits,11 ignorance of the interactions between a gene of interest and the genetic background, and its incapacity to detect crucial polygenic interactions on phenotype.12–14We present here a forward genetic approach to uncover the molecular basis of genetic variation in non-sexual cell aggregation in a natural population of budding yeast (S. cerevisiae). The approach integrates mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTL) with major effects on the cell aggregation trait, resolving the major QTL into the QTL genes, identifying causative nucleotides within the QTL genes, and characterizing molecular functions of these QTL genes and their interactive effects on the trait.2. Materials and methods2.1. Yeast strains and growth conditionsAll yeast strains used in the present study are listed in Supplementary Table S1. YH1A, an isogenic haploid strain of the standard reference strain S288C, was crossed with YL1C, also a haploid strain described elsewhere.15 F1 hybrids from crossing the parental lines were sporulated to generate 292 segregants that were equivalent to gametes, forming an F2 generation. We created two other isogenic haploid strains from the parental lines with changed mating types through modifying their HO genes. We used the standard yeast media and growth conditions in mating, sporulation, and tetrad dissection experiments in the present study.162.2. Scoring phenotype of cell aggregationThe method used to score phenotype of cell aggregation in this study was modified from that proposed by Guo et al.6 In detail, any strain preserved under –70°C was recovered by plate streaking, and three single clones for the strain were obtained. Each clone was cultured in a 5-ml YPD liquid medium at 30°C at 280 rpm for 22–24 h to make the cells enter the stationary phase of growth. The cultures were swirled briefly with a vortex shaker before a sediment test. Phenotype of the tested strain was recorded as a sedimentary time in hours (T), i.e. the time taken for the tested cells to sink completely in the culture buffer in a test tube. On the basis of the sedimentary time records, we grouped phenotype of all tested strains into four categories when contrasted with the sedimentary records of the parental strains, TYH1A and TYL1C, which are illustrated in Fig. 1a. Phenotype of a tested strain was scored as one if T = TYH1A, two if TYL1C < T < TYH1A, three if 0 < T = TYL1C, or four if T = 0. In other words, phenotype of cell aggregation was quantified as a categorical character with multiple thresholds in the present study. QTL fine mapping.

To generate these images, the tested cells were first stained with Gram's iodine and then observed and photomicrographed using a Leica fluorescence microscope. All images illustrated in this paper were printed at the same magnification.2.3. Marker development and genotypingWe first searched the genome sequence of yeast S. cerevisiae (http://www.yeastgenome.org/) for short tandem repeats (STR) within the genome by making use of the computer software Tandem Repeats Finder 3.21.17 We tested 561 evenly distributed STR sequences from the search as candidate markers and confirmed 264 STR loci that exhibited polymorphism between the two parental strains. These polymorphic markers were used as the basic marker set in the primary mapping experiment. Primer sequences for amplifying these STR markers were detailed in our previous study together with the experimental protocols for collecting and analysing STR genotype data.15 Beyond these STR markers, we developed a second set of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers to be used in the second stage of fine scale mapping of cell aggregation QTL by directly sequencing the relevant DNA regions. This added other 25 SNP markers in the QTL regions inferred from the primary QTL mapping (see marker locations and primer sequences in Supplementary Table S2).2.4. Gene knockout, gene replacement, and nucleotide-specific mutagenesisWe implemented the standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based gene disruption techniques to knock out the candidate genes.18,19 Single- and dual-knockout strains were constructed by replacing the target genes with the anti-hygromycin and anti-nourseothricin genes. The triple knockout strain was selected from offspring segregants from crossing of the dual-and single-knockout parental strains. All knockout strains obtained in the present study were confirmed by PCR experiments. The primer sequences for these PCRs are available upon request from the corresponding authors.To perform the allelic exchange experiments and nucleotide-directed mutagenesis, we replaced the allele in situ with the replacement modules comprising the counterpart alleles and the Zeocin resistance gene as a dominant marker (detailed in Supplementary Figs S7 and S8).2.5. Preparation of RNA samples and RT-qPCR analysisCells from a tested strain were cultured in 50 ml YPD liquid medium until reaching OD600 = 0.8. Total RNA was isolated using the hot phenol protocol,20 purified with RNase-free DNase (Promega), and subjected to first-strand cDNA synthesis with SuperScriptTM III Reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). One microlitre of the single-strand cDNA after 10-fold dilution was used as template for real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) with SYBR-green (Toyobo) and ACT1 as the internal control. Every tested strain was independently cultured three times to gain three independent samples, and each of the samples was assayed for three repeated times of qPCR. The oligonucleotide primers for the three genes assayed were RGA1f: 5'-CGGTACAGTCACTGGAATCGAA-3', RGA1r: 5'-ACGAATCAAACCTGGAGCAAA-3';AMN1f: 5'-AGGCAAATACACACAGGTGGAA-3', AMN1r: 5'-TTCCCAAATACCGGCATCA-3'; and ACTINf: 5'-TCGTTCCAATTTACGCTGGTT-3', ACTINr: 5'-CGGCCAAATCGATTCTCAA-3') for RGA1, AMN1, and ACT1, respectively.We first sequenced the FLO1 gene of the two parental strains, YL1C and YH1A, and found that there were only 44 bp in the FLO1 gene, which distinguish FLO1 from the paralogous genes FLO5 and FLO9 (Supplementary Fig. S6). The sense primer of qPCR was designed across the 44-bp specific region, whereas the antisense primer on a non-specific region in 87-bp downstream. The respective specific sequences were ‘GCCTCATCGCTATATGTTTTTGG’ and ‘GCTGGTAAGCACGCCTCTGT’. The PCR product was sequenced and its specificity was confirmed.2.6. Preparation of protein samples and western blotting assayWe followed the PCR-based epitope tagging method to insert 6His into the C-terminal of the target protein as an epitope.21 Proteins were extracted using the protocol described by Adams et al.16 Western blotting was performed using the standard laboratory procedures with monoclonal antibody specific for 6His (Univ. Co, China).2.7. Yeast two-hybrid analysisYeast two-hybrid assay in the present study was carried out according to the manufacturer's manual (Clontech, CA USA). Three alleles of AMN1 (i.e. AMN1YH1A, AMN1YL1C, and AMN1V368D) were cloned independently into the vector pGADT7 (GAD), whereas TEM1 was inserted into the vector pGBKT7 (GBK). These vector constructs were confirmed by sequencing before being introduced into the reporter strains AH109 and Y187. These strains were then screened for positive co-transformation of the paired plasmids through growing them on the SC-Trp-Leu plates, synthetic complete medium lacking tryptophan and leucine. Positive interactions between AMN1 and TEM1 were detected as successful growth of the co-transformed strains on high-stringency SC-Trp-Leu-His plates (synthetic complete medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine) in the AH109 system.22 The positive interaction was also confirmed independently through the quantitative ß-galactosidase assay in the Y187 system.232.8. Data analysesWe implemented a Bayesian approach based on Gibbs sampling as proposed in Sorenson et al.24 to estimate additive genetic variance component and, in turn, heritability of the multiple categorical phenotype of cell aggregation. In the statistical analysis, yi, phenotype of the ith segregant, is determined by a simple liability model <U+2060>, i.e. yi = j (1 = j = 4), if <U+2060>. In the liability model, µ is the population mean,  is a random variable of additive genetic effect of the segregant on its phenotype, and  is the residual or environmental random variable. We assumed that the random variables,  and <U+2060>, follow independently a normal distribution with mean zero and variance  and a standard normal distribution, respectively. The threshold parameters satisfy <U+2060>. We implemented the algorithm developed by Dr Zhaobang Zeng at North Carolina State University for carrying out multiple-interval mapping of QTL affecting the multiple categorical phenotype of cell aggregation.253. Results3.1. Characterizing cell aggregation of yeastWe first established a reliable and feasible method to quantify the aggregation phenotype, which was essential for a quantitative genetic analysis and further functional analysis with the cellular behaviour character. The left panel in Fig. 1a shows sediment status of cells from the clumpy and non-clumpy parental strains YL1C and YH1A and their four representative segregants at three sediment time points, 0, 1.0, and 2.5 h. Thus, cell aggregation was, here, scored as a categorical quantitative trait, with the two parental strains, YH1A and YL1C, having phenotype categories 1 and 3, respectively and their offspring being scored as one of the four possible categories. In particular, cells of the segregant four sunk immediately in the clumping buffer (0 h) and the segregant was scored as category 4, a phenotype outside of the range of its two parents, showing transgressive segregation of the complex cell behaviour character. This method of categorizing the clumping character coordinates very well with that of the microscope views of the cell flocs, indicating the feasibility and reliability of the phenotyping assay.3.2. Mapping and dissection of cell aggregation QTLFrom crossing the parental strains, YH1A and YL1C, that are highly divergent in cell aggregation phenotype, we created a full-sibling population comprising 292 segregants. We scored the segregants for their clumping phenotype and genotyped them at 264 segregating simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. Based on the phenotype and marker genotype data, we implemented the multiple-interval mapping method25 for a preliminary genome-wide scan for QTL affecting the multiple categorical phenotype of cell aggregation. The analysis detected four significant QTLs that mapped on the yeast chromosomes I, II, V, and XV, respectively. To narrow down these QTL regions, we genotyped the segregants at 1, 9, 4, and 11 further SNP markers in the 3 QTL regions, respectively and reran the multiple-interval mapping analysis. Because the chromosome I and V QTLs contain FLO1 and FLO8, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S1), two previously known genes involved in flocculation in S. cerevisiae,5,26,27 our focus here was on the other two QTLs on the yeast chromosomes II and XV. Figure 1b shows the likelihood profiles for the two major QTLs together with physical maps of candidate genes within the QTL regions. It can be seen that the fine mapping enables to resolve the chromosome II QTL into six candidate genes and the chromosome XV QTL into seven candidates.3.3. Major-effect genes for cell aggregation and causative nucleotide in chromosome II QTLAmong the six candidate genes within the chromosome II QTL (Fig. 1b), three (RIB7, RPB5, and CNS1) are essential genes. We first knocked out each of the remaining three (SLI15, ICS2, and AMN1) in both the parental strains, YH1A and YL1C, and then evaluated the knockout strains for their clumping phenotype. We found that phenotype of the clumpy parental strain, YL1C, was dramatically altered after its AMN1 gene was knocked out (Fig. 2a). To further consolidate the candidacy of AMN1 as the QTL gene, we carried out an allelic exchange experiment, in which the AMN1 allele of the YL1C strain was replaced with that of the YH1A strain and vice versa. The aggregation phenotype of YL1C was clearly reduced after its AMN1 allele was replaced by that of YH1A (Fig. 2b). Moreover, the non-clumpy strain, YH1A, showed cell aggregation when its AMN1 allele was replaced by that from YL1C (Fig. 2b). These findings provide the strong evidence supporting that AMN1 is indeed the major clumping QTL gene. It should be noted that effects of replacing AMN1 alleles are not reciprocally constant between the two parental strains. Cell aggregation phenotype of engineered parent strains across QTL genes.

Meanwhile, we assayed their expression at both transcriptional and translational levels through RT-qPCR and western blotting assays. Although the AMN1 gene is expressed significantly differentially between the two parental strains at both the mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 3c), the polymorphisms in the open reading frame (ORF) are sufficient to lead to phenotypic variation according to the results of allelic exchange (Fig. 2b).We further used site-directed mutagenesis to identify the causative quantitative trait nucleotide(s) in the QTL gene AMN1 by replacing the AMN1 gene of the YL1C strain with three different DNA segments of 2150 bp in length from the strain YH1A, accordingly. The segments covered the whole coding sequence of the AMN1 gene with the YH1A origin, but differed only at each of the three mutant nucleotides. We assayed these genetically modified strains for their clumping phenotype and found that only the strain that carried the V368D substitution in the AMN1 gene could recover the phenotype of YL1C (Supplementary Fig. S2a), strongly supporting the mutation as the causative quantitative trait nucleotide.3.4. V368D variation determined the cell aggregation phenotype through the MEN pathwayIt has been reported that AMN1 plays a key role as a daughter-specific switch that helps cells exit from the mitotic exit and reset the yeast cell cycle through binding to Tem1, a Ras-related GTPase. The TEM1 gene activates a signal transduction pathway, mitotic exit network (MEN) to allow mitotic exit.28 Based on this observation, we performed the yeast two-hybrid experiment in a standard strain AH109 and demonstrated that only Amn1YL1C and Amn1V368D can bind to Tem1 effectively (Fig. 4a). The quantitative ß-galactosidase analysis yielded the results that were highly consistent with the two-hybrid analysis (Supplementary Fig. S3). Furthermore, we compared expression of the downstream genes DSE1, DSE2, and SCW11 between YL1C and YH1A, using the Affymetrix microarray hybridization data described previously in Wang et al.29 These genes were reported to underlie the cell wall degradation and daughter cell separation,30 and the expressions could be activated by Ace2, the transcriptional factor regulated by the MEN pathway.31 Our study shows a significantly lowered level of expression of these genes in YL1C than in YH1A (Fig. 4b), suggesting that the transcription of DSE1, DSE2, and SCW11 would be inhibited in the clumpy parent strain, YL1C. Then, we constructed two strains both derived from YL1C, which differed only at the 368th amino acid residue of Amn1. The expression of these downstream genes DSE1, DSE2, and SCW11 exhibited significant difference between the strains (Fig. 4c). These observations support the hypothesis that the V368D substitution in the Amn1 of the clumpy parent YL1C enhanced its binding to Tem1 and, in turn, blocked the MEN pathway, reduced transcription of the downstream genes DSE1, DSE2, and SCW11, and finally resulted in inhibition of daughter cells' separation and formation of clumps (Fig. 4d).

RGA1 as the chromosome XV clumping QTL geneTo dissect the chromosome XV QTL, we screened for the candidate(s) that responded to knockout and gene replacement treatments. Of the seven ORFs within the QTL, only when the RGA1 gene of the clumpy strain YL1C was silenced through knockout, its clumping phenotype was visibly altered (Fig. 2a). In addition, the phenotype was also changed significantly when its RGA1 allele was replaced with that from YH1A (Fig. 2b). These observations strongly support the candidacy of RGA1 as another major QTL gene. We compared the Rga1 sequence between the two parental strains and detected four polymorphic sites (Fig. 3b). We failed to find a single nucleotide substitution that could explain the observed change in the phenotype, although we found that the third polymorphic site in the gene had a significant causative effect on invasive growth of the yeast cells (Supplementary Fig. S4). Furthermore, we compared, but did not detect any significant change in expression of the RGA1 alleles between the two parental strains at either the transcriptional or translational level (Supplementary Fig. S5).

(c) Comparison in mRNA and protein expression of AMN1 between the two parental strains, YH1A and YL1C.Rga1, a member of the Cdc42 GTPase-activating protein family, has been reported as an apical and isotropic switch in controlling the budding pattern of yeast cells by influencing hydrolytic status.32,33 In the presence of normally functional RGA1, Cdc42-GTP hydrolyzes and becomes Cdc42-GDP, leading to axial budding of cells that shows round cell morphology. The cells show bipolar budding and elongated morphology when their RGA1 is silenced. However, it should be stressed that effect of the RGA1 on cell budding and morphology would be only partial because there exist other family members such as RGA2 and BEM3. Their presence may compensate for defects of the silent RGA1.34 In light of the observation, we examined joint effects of the two verified QTL genes, RGA1 and AMN1, on cell aggregation. Figure 5 illustrates sequential influences of the two major clumping QTL genes, RGA1 and AMN1, on budding pattern, cellular morphology, and cell separation of the clumpy strain YL1C. When the AMN1 gene alone was knocked out whereas RGA1 remained normal, the strain showed cell separation and largely round shape. When only RGA1 was silenced whereas AMN1 functioned normally, daughter cells of the strain were inhibited to separate from mother cells. Some of the cells then displayed bipolar budding and apical attachment between mother–daughter cells in elongated shape, resulting in smaller clumps, and the presence of strings comprises a few apically linked cells. Whenever both the genes were knocked out in the clumpy strain, cells were promoted to bud in bipolarization, and inhibition of cell separation was released, leading to formation of bar-like cell clumps. These explain why single-knockout strain of AMN1 has a more defected phenotype than dual-knockout strain.

FLO1, FLO8, and transgressive segregationOur QTL analysis detected two significant QTL regions containing the two genes relevant to flocculation, FLO1 and FLO8. To test their candidacy as major cell aggregation genes, we first compared sequence of the two genes between the two parental strains, YH1A and YL1C, and found that the FLO1 allele in the clumpy strain YL1C had eight fewer tandem repeats of an intragenic domain than those in the non-clumpy parent YH1A. This disagrees with the previous observations that the degree of cell flocculation was found to be proportional to the number of tandem repeats of the intragenic domain structure.1,35 Comparison of genic sequence of FLO8 between the two parental strains revealed a nonsense substitution at the 425th nucleotide in YH1A, consistent with the previous study.26 The mutation creates a stop codon (TAG) and results in a truncated protein. The defective FLO8 in YH1A cannot activate expression of its FLO1, thus explaining why the FLO1 gene did not lead to stronger flocculation as previously expected, although the non-clumpy strain carried the allele enhancing flocculation phenotype.We knocked out the FLO1 and FLO8 genes individually in YH1A and YL1C and observed that the clumping phenotype of YL1C was markedly altered after either FLO1 or FLO8 gene was silenced (Supplementary Fig. S2b). Moreover, we replaced the FLO8 allele in YL1C with the YH1A-derived counterpart and observed a similar phenotype to the FLO1 or FLO8 deletion strain (Supplementary Fig. S2b). The data showed that genetic variation of both the FLO genes contributed significantly to the clumpy phenotype. We attempted but failed to replace the FLO1 gene in the same way as reported above. This can be attributed to the difficulties arising from the location of the FLO1 gene at the chromosomal end with rich heterochromatin, thus keeping the gene in a protected status from genetic modification. Secondly, the FLO1 gene has an extremely high level of homology with its family members FLO5 and FLO9, making it extremely difficult to ensure specificity in replacing the target gene.Although it was highly technically challenging to profile expression of the FLO1 gene due to its extremely high level of sequence homology with other FLO family members FLO5 and FLO9, we succeeded in assaying expression of the FLO gene in the two parental strains through an FLO1-specific RT-qPCR experiment (see Supplementary Fig. S6 for detail). We analysed the FLO1 and FLO8 expression levels of the parental strains and their eight offspring individuals with two different genotypes at the QTL genes and varying phenotypes. FLO8 expression showed no difference in the tested strains. Moreover, a highly expressed FLO1 gene was common for the strong cell clumping phenotype (the phenotype categories 3 and 4) but was certainly not an indicator of clumpiness because the gene was also observed to be highly expressed in the non-clumpy strains (those with phenotype category 1) (Fig. 6a).

Red horizontal line represents the top boundary of cell sediment.Intriguingly, 30 extremely clumpy segregants (T = 0) exhibited more strongly clumpy than parental strains, which is termed as transgressive segregation. To explore how the QTL genes affect the transgressive segregation, we first grouped the 292 segregants into 4 panels of 16 groups according to their allelic origin or joint genotype at the 4 QTL genes. Figure 6b illustrates distributions of the segregants with different phenotypes (1–4) within each of the four-gene genotypes and shows that the segregants receiving the four QTL genes from the clumpy parent, YL1C, have a much lower probability of expressing extreme clumpy phenotype (phenotypic category 4) than those with a YH1A-derived allele of FLO1, indicating a dispersion distribution of cell aggregation causing alleles at the QTL genes between the two yeast parental strains and thus explaining the transgressive segregation observed in the segregant population. Moreover, the phenotypic effect of the FLO1 allele was highly background dependent. This FLO1 allele would not cause the clumping phenotype in the absence of the other three QTL genes from the clumpy parent YL1C (group 7 vs. group 3 in Fig. 6b), but plays the role of clumping enhancer.Given the fact that the flocculins leading to cell flocculation share a common three-domain structure and require Ca2+ ions to stabilize the structure,9 we explored the effect of Ca2+ ions on clumping phenotypes of the two parental strains and their two segregants (S2 and S5) that showed the transgressive phenotype. Figure 6c shows that the cell aggregation phenotype of the strains S2 and S5 was reduced to the extent of YL1C when Ca2+ ions were chelated with the ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid treatment (panel 2), but recovered when the ions were added as CaCl2 in the clumping buffer, suggesting that the transgressive phenotype can be attributed to FLO gene family. This assumption was confirmed by the further knockout experiments in which the transgressive phenotype was disrupted when either FLO1 or FLO8 was silenced in S2 and S5 strains (Supplementary Fig. S2b). Strikingly, the treatment did not result in altered phenotype of the clumpy parental strain (YL1C). This together with the fact that this parent carried the non-clumpy FLO1 allele indicates that the phenotypic response to the Ca2+ treatment actually reflects response of the Ca2+-dependent cell aggregation induced by the cell wall protein, which differs from that mediated by AMN1.We assessed relative contribution of the QTL genes to phenotypic variation in cell aggregation and found that genetic variation in AMN1 explained 25% of the phenotypic variation, whereas the other three QTL genes FLO8, RGA1, and FLO1, respectively, explained 17, 5, and 11% of the variation. Variation between aggregative genotypes at all the four genes explained 46% of the phenotypic variation. To further explore the joint and interactive effects of the genes, we generated three dual-knockout strains (YL1C-amn1<U+0394>&flo8<U+0394>, YL1C-amn1<U+0394>&rga1<U+0394>, and YL1C-flo8<U+0394>&rga1<U+0394>) and one triple-deletion strain (YL1C-amn1<U+0394>&flo8<U+0394>&rga1<U+0394>). Phenotypes of these engineered strains are shown together with other single QTL gene knockout strains and the wild-type strain in Fig. 2. Although the degree of cell aggregation of the single-gene knockout strains was further reduced when they were knocked out for additional one or two of the QTL genes, it is clear that different configurations of the knockout QTL genes have led to different degrees of clumpiness. This, together with the observation illustrated in Fig. 6b, reveals that the QTL genes show clearly epistatic effects on cell aggregation.4. DiscussionThe genetic architecture underlying a quantitative trait is determined by the number of genes that contribute to their additive and interactive effects on variation of the trait phenotype.36 Although many genomes have been fully sequenced and the number of genes with annotated function increases rapidly in the era of functional genomics, it still remains a great challenge to reconstruct the architecture with a full insight of the genetic parameters. Budding yeast, the single-cell eukaryote, but with probably the richest structural and functional information of the genome, provides an ideal model for dissecting the molecular basis of genetic variation in typical quantitative traits such as high-temperature growth12 and sporulation efficiency37 and in genetic control of transcriptome abundance.38 The present study extends these successful examples by dissecting multiple-threshold phenotypic variation of yeast cell aggregation into a genic level.Several genes have been reported previously in the literature to control clumping phenotype variation in budding yeast. Of these, the most prominent are the FLO gene family responsible for many cellular adhesion phenotypes, including flocculation.10 In sharp contrast, the present study reveals the two novel genes, AMN1 and RGA1, in addition to previously identified two genes, FLO1 and FLO8, that are significant determinants for the phenotype. Success of the present study in resolving the mapped QTLs into the underlying QTL genes can be attributed to that the major QTLs have been mapped at the high resolution by which direct gene targeting becomes possible. We noted that the simulation study by Li et al. predicted a much larger confidence interval for mapping categorical traits from a simulated backcross population with 200 individuals genotyped at genetic markers of every 10 cM. When compared with the simulation study, the present analysis has employed a substantially larger sample size (292 segregants) and higher density of markers in the QTL regions. These together with the fact that the budding yeast has a highly recombiogenic and compact genome paved the basis for the mapping resolution we have achieved.The combined effect of these QTL genes explains 46% of the overall phenotypic variation, leaving the remaining 54% of the variation to be residual. The residual variation can be explained as two parts as well as their interaction, the genetic component whose underlying genetic effects are too small to be detected by the experiment, and the component contributed by environmental modification to the quantitative trait. In addition, we demonstrated that the QTL genes exhibited clear epistatic effects on the aggregation trait. These show that the underlying mechanism of yeast cell aggregation is more complicated than expected in the previous literature.Of these QTL genes, AMN1 plays the leading role in regulating cell aggregation. We provide strong and direct experimental evidence that supports this is through the genes modulating the mitotic exit network in S. cerevisiae.28 We have identified the AMN1 as a major QTL gene of cell aggregation through a genome-wide QTL scan in a natural population and provided here the direct experimental evidence for the V368D substitution as the causative genetic variant. Our results also strongly indicate the putative domain of AMN1, and the functional significance of V368D, which has been recently predicted as a superfamily being highly conserved (e-value of 6.38e-96) across species.39 On the other hand, the RGA1 gene, a member of the GTPase-activating family, is first identified in the present study as a major gene affecting cellular clumping in budding yeast. This gene is required for yeast cells to switch from the apical to isotropic growth phase.40 The present study creates an opportunity to explore the joint effect of this cell aggregation QTL gene, a budding pattern controller, and another QTL gene AMN1, also a mitotic exit regulator. Genetic modification to these genes through gene knockouts disperses the well-known grape-like strings of cells (Fig. 5).In addition to the above two major genetic factors, FLO1 and FLO8 were also detected as the QTL genes through the present forward genetic analysis. Highly expressed FLO1, a cell surface adhesion regulator, has been widely recognized as a biomarker for cell flocculation in many candidate-based analysis. However, we present here the role of the gene, as merely one of the building elements in the genetic architecture underlying the complex phenotype, and show that FLO1 is highly background dependent in determining the phenotype of its carrier. Unlike what has been widely accepted in the literature of yeast cell flocculation, expressed FLO1 does not necessarily confer a clumping phenotype to its carriers. We demonstrate that the FLO1 allele from a non-clumpy parental strain, in the presence of the other three QTL genes from a clumpy parental strain, creates the genotype for the clumping phenotype that substantially surpasses performance of both the parents, i.e. transgressive segregation of the QTL genes. Taking all these together, the QTL genes unveiled in the present study have been shown to be involved in multiple pathways that govern the cellular development (RGA1), the behaviour of daughter cells (AMN1), and the cell-surface adherence property (FLO1 and FLO8). In contrast to the studies in which biological functions and their phenotypic significance of these QTL genes were examined either independently or jointly, the present study unveils the QTL genes as major determinants of the clumping phenotype in a systematic way. This clearly indicates the power and appropriateness of the forward genetic approach employed in the present study in uncovering the genetic basis of an aggregate polygenic trait such as cellular clumping that involves multiple constituent components.The evolutionary significance of cellular clumping has recently been highlighted in the single-cell species because the clumping phenotype can protect inner individuals in cell clumps from biotic or/and abiotic stresses such as alcohol, anti-microbials, and physical attacks. The FLO1 gene is recognized as a ‘green beard gene’ because its induced expression in a non-flocculent laboratory strain, S288C, can restore its cells to flocculate, and the cellular flocs, thus, generated provide a cooperative shield to protect from stresses in the living environment.1 Our data demonstrate that expression of FLO1 may not be the biomarker for a clumping phenotype, although an unexpressed FLO1 allele from the non-clumpy strain, which is isogenic to S228C, may enhance clumping of its offspring strains carrying other major clumping genes. In the polygenic system uncovered here, AMN1 is found to be a more important genetic determinant than FLO1 in controlling expression of the clumping phenotype, and this endogenously expressed gene may make a more appropriate target for investigating the molecular mechanism underlying the ‘green beard’ effect.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available atwww.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by the National Basic Research Program of China (2012CB316505) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (91231114, 31271335).We thank Prof. M.J.

The specific ubiquitination of different target proteins is mediated by different classes of E3 ubiquitin ligases, among which the best known are Skp1-Cullin-F-box complexes. Whereas protists, fungi and some vertebrates have a single SKP1 gene, many animal and plant species possess multiple SKP1 homologues. In this paper, we report on the structure, phylogeny and expression of the complete set of rice SKP1 genes (OSKs, Oryza sativa SKP1-like genes). Our analyses indicated that OSK1 and OSK20 belong to a class of SKP1 genes that contain one intron at a conserved position and are highly expressed. In addition, our yeast two-hybrid results revealed that OSK proteins display a differing ability to interact with F-box proteins. However, OSK1 and OSK20 seemed to interact with most of the nine F-box proteins tested. We suggest that rice OSK1 and OSK20 are likely to have functions similar to the Arabidopsis ASK1 and ASK2 genes.1. IntroductionProtein degradation is an important post-transcriptional regulatory process that allows cells to respond rapidly to intracellular signals and changing environmental conditions by adjusting the levels of key proteins. One major proteolytic pathway in eukaryotes involves the Ubiquitin/26S Proteasome System (UPS) that utilizes the post-translational modification of proteins by ubiquitin. The UPS involves the enzymatic activities required for the polyubiquitylation of target proteins, and then for the proteolysis of these tagged proteins by the proteasome. This polyubiquitylation is achieved by the sequential actions of three enzymes: an E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme, an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme and an E3 ubiquitin ligase. E1 activates and links free ubiquitins that will be transferred to one of the E2 enzymes, whereas E3 ligase enzymes promote ubiquitylation by mediating a specific interaction between E2 enzymes and the target protein.1–4The specificity of the ubiquitination process is ensured by the E3 ubiquitin ligases encoded by a large multigene family. A survey of sequenced plant genomes showed that they contain more than 1000 E3 ubiquitin ligases. For example, the annotated Arabidopsis thaliana, rice and soybean genomes contain 1415, 1332 and 1402 E3 ligase-encoding genes, respectively.5,6 E3s comprise a diverse family of proteins or protein complexes that can be distinguished in terms of their mechanisms of action and types of interactions. They act either as single subunits, such as homology to E6-AP C terminus, really interesting new gene and U-box or multisubunit complexes such as SkP1 S-phase Kinase-associated Protein 1–CulL1 (Cullin 1)–F-box (SCF), Cullin3-Bric a brac-Tramtrack-Broad, Cullin 4-DNA damage-binding 1 and anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome.3,5SCF complexes are a major type of E3 ubiquitin ligase consisting of two constant subunits (ROC1 or Rbx1 and Cullin-1), a moderately variable subunit (SKP1) and a highly variable substrate recognition subunit known as F-box protein.7,8 F-box proteins contain a conserved F-box domain (40–50 amino acids) at the N-terminus, which interacts with Skp1 proteins. They have highly variable protein–protein interaction domains at the C-terminus, which confer substrate specificity for ubiquitination.7,9 Beside the canonical SCF, it appears that in some cases, Skp1 and F-box proteins may function in non-SCF complexes and that some F-box proteins have functions of their own.10 F-box proteins are represented by large families in different organisms. There are 11 F-box protein-encoding genes in budding yeast, 68 in humans, 74 in Caenorhabditis elegans, 337 in poplar, 539 in medicago, 692 in Arabidopsis and 779 in rice.11,12 Different research groups have classified Arabidopsis and rice F-box proteins in several subfamilies or subgroups based on their phylogenetic relationships or unique functional domains.7,9,13 Whereas humans and yeasts have a single SKP1 gene, many animal and plant species possess multiple SKP1 homologues14, for example, 7 in Drosophila, 21 in C. elegans denoted Skr, 21 in C. elegans and 21 in Arabidopsis denoted ASK and 32 in rice denoted OSK.3,15–17 Based on the finding that the C. elegans genome contains 21 SKP1-related genes,15,16 these authors questioned whether all these genes could interact with other components in the SCF complex (i.e. Cullin1 and F-box proteins). Both studies used the Y2H system to demonstrate that Skr proteins displayed varied patterns of interaction with Cullins and F-box proteins. While Skr1 (which is thought to have a function similar to that of the human SKP1) interacted with most of the F-box tested, and the remaining Skr displayed differing interaction capabilities.16 In addition, both studies showed that the 21 C. elegans Skrs displayed various expression profiles and tissue-specific patterns and different RNAi phenotypes, indicating their involvement in a variety of pathways.15,16 Subsequently, several exhaustive yeast two-hybrid screens were used to analyse the Arabidopsis SKP1-like family (ASKs). It was demonstrated that the 21 Arabidopsis ASK proteins displayed substantial differences in their abilities to interact with different F-box proteins and that ASK1, ASK2, ASK11 and ASK12 could interact with COI1, FKF1, UFO and other F-box proteins.18 The ASK1 and ASK2 genes seem to be the most important SKP1 homologues in A. thaliana; both of them are expressed widely and at high levels.8,14,18During a phylogenetic study, Kong et al. analysed the evolution of SKP1-like genes in a wide range of plant species, but with particular emphasis on Arabidopsis and rice and suggested that all the SKP1 genes found in these species derived from a single ancestral gene represented by ASK1 in Arabidopsis and OSK1 in rice, and that these genes could have similar functions.14Despite the importance of the SCF complex, there have been few reports of systematic surveys of interactions between the dozens of SKP1-like proteins and the hundreds of F-box proteins. The objective of the present study was, therefore, to uncover the various capabilities of SKP1-like proteins to interact with F-box proteins in rice. Nine F-box proteins representative of the most frequent domains containing F-box proteins, and the whole set of SKP1-like proteins (OSK), were studied. In total, 540 binary interactions were tested using the yeast two-hybrid approach. We showed that the 30 rice SKP1-like proteins displayed various interaction patterns with the tested F-box proteins and that OSK1 and OSK20 exhibited the most frequent interaction capabilities. Our results also suggest that rice OSK1 and OSK20 might be functionally equivalent to ASK1 and ASK2 in Arabidopsis.2. Methods2.1. Data retrievalKong et al.17 evoked the presence of 32 SKP1-like genes in the rice genome, but described only 28 genes in their phylogenetic study. We followed the same nomenclature during our study, although we added three OSK genes (OSK8, OSK24 and OSK31) and replaced Kong's OSK14 with a more accurate accession. For details, see Supplementary Table S1. In addition, OSK18, which contains an internal retrotransposon, was excluded from subsequent studies. Thus, a total of 30 OSK genes were retained for further analyses. Nine F-box proteins belonging to F-box families in the rice genome were selected from the inventory compiled by Jain et al.7 The Rice Genome Annotation Project [RICECHIP.ORG: Support for Annotation & Functional Analysis of the Oryza sativa (Rice) Genome (http://www.ricechip.org/)] was used to identify the number of Expressed Sequence Tags (EST) for OSK and F-box genes in various rice tissues (July 2011).The PLAZA platform (http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/plaza/, version 2.5) was queried to retrieve SKP1-like genes from the sequenced genomes of 11 eudicot, 5monocot and 1 moss species. All retrieved sequences were checked manually for consistency and for the presence of SKP1 signatures, using the InterProScan program.192.2. Structural analysis of the SKP1 familyMultiple protein sequence alignments were generated using the Muscle software20 implemented under MEGA5.21 The maximum likelihood method was used, and phylogeny was tested with a bootstrap of 500 (Poisson's correction model) to construct a phylogenetic tree with MEGA5.21 The entire set of 288 SKP1-like proteins from the moss, monocot and eudicot species retrieved from Plaza (http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/plaza/) were checked for the presence and positions of introns within the gene. The conservation of intron position was used as a criterion to identify putative ancestral SKP1-like genes, as suggested by Kong et al.17 In this study, an intron was considered to be conserved, if it occurred between two aligning bases in the alignment of the coding sequences.222.3. Meta-analysis of the expression of rice SKP1-like genesThe Affymetrix probe sets corresponding to rice SKP1-like genes were retrieved from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com). Probe sets that recognized multiple genes were excluded from the analysis. Organ distribution (anatomy analysis) of the expression of rice SKP1 genes was determined using Genevistegator (https://www.genevestigator.com/gv/).23 Hierarchical clustering analyses were performed using Robust Multi-array Average (RMA)-normalized data corresponding to 871 publicly available experiments (http://bioinf.mind.meiji.ac.jp/Rice_network_public).24 The data corresponding to SKP1 genes were extracted (Supplementary Table S2) and analysed using the MeV 4_5_1 software (http://www.tm4.org/mev/). The SKP1 genes were then clustered according to their expression profile using the Euclidean distance and complete linkage methods.2.4. Total RNA extraction and isolation of OSKs and F-box cDNAsTotal RNA was isolated from 3-week-old leaf rice (O. sativa L. var. Nipponbare) following the method described by Bogorad et al.,25 with slight adjustments for small samples(0.5 g). The RNA was then treated with DNaseI (Invitrogen). The SuperScript II reverse transcriptase and oligo-dT primer (Invitrogen) were used to synthesize the first strand cDNA. The forward and reverse primer pairs used to amplify the 13 OSK cDNAs are shown in Supplementary Table S3, as are the primer pairs used to amplify the 5 F-box cDNAs. Then, 1% agarose gel and the GFX Purification Kit (Amersham) were used to separate and purify the PCR products. Because we failed to amplify and then clone all the SKP1 and F-box coding sequences from the tissues available, 17 OSK and 4 F-box cDNA were chemically synthesized by Proteogenix (France). Both the synthesized and amplified cDNAs were then cloned and treated alike.2.5. cDNA cloningpENTR™/D-TOPO® cloning kits (Invitrogen) were used to clone the inserts. Under this system, PCR products are cloned directionally by adding four bases to the forward primer (CACC). Entry clones flanked with attL1 and attL2 sites necessary for recombination into the destination vectors are then obtained. All constructs were checked by sequencing, and a total of 30 OSK genes and 9 F-box genes were cloned and sequenced.2.6. Binary yeast two-hybrid analysisGateway Cloning Technology (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used to produce hybrid proteins. The yeast expression vectors pDEST™32 and pDEST™22 were used to generate GAL 4 DNA-binding domain and GAL4 DNA activation domain fusion proteins. The LR reaction (Gateway Technology, Invitrogen) was performed to clone 30 OSK and 9 F-box in both directions into the destination vectors.The MaV203 Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain (ProQuest™ Two-hybrid System, Invitrogen) contains deletions in its endogenous GAL4 and GAL80 genes for use with GAL4-based two-hybrid systems. This strain also has leu2 and trp1 mutations for the selection of ProQuest™ bait and prey vectors. MaV203 contains three GAL4 inducible reporter genes, providing four phenotypes, to enable the easier identification of true interactors.Bait and prey vectors were transformed together in the MaV203 yeast strain using the ProQuest™ Two-hybrid System (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's manual. Each co-transformation was plated onto a nutritionally selective plate that was deficient in tryptophan and leucine (Sc-Leu-Trp), to test for positive transformation. X-gal assays based on induction of the lacZ reporter gene were used to verify the interactions between fusion proteins. Constructs that gave a positive interaction were checked for self-activation according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The yeast cells were co-transformed with a bait or prey plasmid and an empty plasmid. Self-activation tests were performed using the HIS3 reporter gene encoding an enzyme involved in histidine biosynthesis. This enzyme can be inhibited by a competitive inhibitor, 3-aminotriazole (3AT). The addition of 3AT at concentrations of 10, 25, 50 or 100 mM in a histidine-free culture medium increases the stringency of this test. The empty vectors and pEXP32/Krev1 and pEXP22/RalGDS-m2 vectors were used as negative controls, whereas yeast strains which were co-transformed with the pEXP32/krev1 and pEXP22/RalGDS-wt vectors were used as positive controls (Invitrogen).2.7. Protein extraction and immunoblottingTo check for the actual production of fusion proteins, total yeast proteins were extracted according to the method described by Printen and Sprague26 and separated by electrophoresis with the Mini-PROTEAN TGX (Tris-Glycine eXtended, BIO-RAD) on either precast 10% gels or 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Protein samples were blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Hybond™ ECL™, GE Healthcare Life Sciences) using a liquid transfer system (Criterion™ Blotter, BIO-RAD) in a transfer buffer (25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, 20% v/v methanol, pH 8.3). The fusion protein blots were probed with primary anti-GAL4-BD mouse monoclonal antibody (sc-510, Santa Cruz Biotech, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) and secondary goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP antibody (sc-2005, Santa Cruz Biotech, CA, USA) at dilutions of 1/500 and 1/10 000, respectively and visualized using chemiluminescence as instructed by the manufacturer (ECL, Amersham, Pharmacia). Each immunoblot assay was repeated at least twice.3. Results3.1. Structural analysis of rice OSK genes and other plant SKP1-like genes: SKP1-like gene intron identificationPLAZA (http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/plaza/) was used to help in identifying the presence and position of introns within each OSK gene. In a first step, the rice OSK genes were placed in three different classes according to Kong et al.17: type Ia corresponding to OSK genes containing one intron, type Ib corresponding to intronless OSK genes and type II corresponding to OSK genes containing more than one intron. Details of the structure and a description of the rice OSK genes are given in Supplementary Table S1. In a second step, we retrieved and analysed 288 SKP1-like genes belonging to 17 species including the moss Physcomitrella patens, 5 monocots (Brachypodium distachyon, O. sativa ssp. Japonica, O. sativa ssp. Indica, Sorghum bicolor and Zea mays) and 11 eudicots (Arabidopsis lyrata, A. thaliana, Carica papaya, Fragaria vesca, Glycine max, Lotus japonicus, Manihot esculenta, Medicago truncatula, Populus trichocarpa, Ricinus communis and Vitis vinifera) (Supplementary Table S4). Genes belonging to the three classes (type Ia, type Ib and type II according to Kong et al.17) were found in each species. However, careful examination of nucleotide and protein alignments revealed that SKP1-like genes containing a single intron could be split into two subclasses. In the first subclass, the intron was in a conserved position, i.e. occurring between two aligning bases in the alignment of the coding sequences (Fig. 1).22 In addition, whereas the first exon and the single intron were variable in length, the second exon was constant and was 174 bp (or 58 amino acid) long (Fig. 1). The second subclass of plant SKP1-like genes with a single intron contained SKP1 genes, where both the intron and the two exons were of variable length. A survey of the whole set of plant and moss SKP1-like genes indicated that each species contained at least one gene with a conserved single intron (A. lyrata, F. vesca and L. japonicus). However, the majority of plant species contained two or three genes with a single conserved intron. When the different classes of SKP1-like genes were considered, it was clear that the majority of plant SKP1-like genes were intronless and represented 50% of the entire set (144 out of 288). The results of this survey are summarized in Supplementary Table S5. Phylogenetical analysis of the 40 plant SKP1-like genes with a conserved single intron indicated that these genes formed 3 main clusters corresponding to the moss, monocot and eudicot groups (Fig. 2). The grouping, thus, observed was mainly determined by the first exon, which was more variable between species than the second exon (Fig. 1). Interestingly, SKP1-like genes originating from the same species generally clustered. However, some genes originating from different species also clustered together, indicating possible orthology relationships. For example, in the monocots, SB05G012740 and SB02G031280 from sorghum clustered, respectively, with ZM04G05180 and ZM07G31190 from maize while RC28962G00160 and RC30170G05850 from Ricinus clustered, respectively, with ME07520G02920 and ME02943G00470 in M. esculenta. Multiple alignment of exons in plant SKP1-like genes generated with weblogo 3.2 (http://weblogo.threeplusone.com/manual.html). The sequence logo was derived from the alignment of 40 exons in plant SKP1-like gene with a conserved single intron, showing the high conservation of exons 2. The vertical axis shows the data content in bits. The overall height of the stack indicates sequence conservation at that position, whereas the height of the nucleotide within a stack indicates its relative frequency at that position.

A phylogenetic analysis of 40 plant SKP1-like genes with a conserved single intron indicated that these genes form 3 main clusters corresponding to moss, monocot and eudicot groups. Their evolutionary history was inferred using the maximum likelihood method based on the Poisson correction model. The tree with the highest log likelihood (-3400.1299) is shown. This tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths measured in the number of substitutions per site. This analysis involved 32 amino acid sequences. There were a total of 213 positions in the final dataset. Evolutionary analyses were conducted under MEGA5.20Molecular phylogenetic analysis using the maximum likelihood method.

Expression profiles of the rice Skp1-like genesGene expression profiles can provide indications concerning gene functions. We looked for evidence of the expression of all OSK genes in the EST databases and found that EST sequences were available for 12 out of the 31 OSK genes. The number of EST also varied significantly in various tissues/organs, indicating the differential expression of OSK genes (Supplementary Table S6). Within the set of expressed OSK genes, OSK1 was the most strongly expressed and was represented by 43.6% of ESTs, whereas OSK20, OSK8, OSK22 and OSK28 were represented by 16, 12.7, 9 and 7% of ESTs, respectively. The cumulative percentage of these genes accounted for about 88.3% of all the ESTs detected (Supplementary Table S6).In addition to this EST-based analysis of expression, we surveyed the expression profiles of OSK genes during various developmental stages using the Genevestigator platform (https://www.genevestigator.com/gv/).24 The microarray data from 1475 arrays reflecting different developmental stages throughout the life cycle of rice were analysed. OSK genes displayed varied expression patterns with some OSK genes being strongly and widely expressed such as OSK1, OSK8, OSK11, OSK20 and OSK23. However, the majority of OSK genes are expressed in inflorescence parts of the plants (Fig. 3). Meta-analysis of the expression of rice SKP1-like genes.

The hierarchical clustering of 20 OSK genes based on their average log2 signal values in the 871 experiments revealed 3 different clusters. One cluster contained widely and strongly expressed genes including OSK1, OSK8, OSK20 and OSK24, a second cluster contained moderately expressed genes and the third cluster contained weakly expressed genes (Fig. 3; Supplementary Table S2). Overall, the expression data indicated that OSK1 is the most widely and strongly expressed rice SKP1 gene.3.3. Yeast two-hybrid interaction between OSKs, F-box proteins and western blotsAn experiment was designed to test interactions between 30 rice OSK and 9 F-box proteins. For each OSK-F-box pair, the interaction was tested in both directions, resulting in a total of 540 binary interactions.Prior to the actual interaction tests, each protein was examined individually for transactivation (activation of reporter gene transcription), and we observed transactivation for OSK4, OSK7, OSK12, OSK15 and OSK31 in yeast when fused to the Gal4 BD domain (i.e. the pDEST™32 expression vector). No transactivation was seen with these proteins when they were fused to the AD domain (i.e. the pDEST™22 expression vector).Of the 30 OSK proteins examined, 8 were shown to interact with at least 1 F-box protein in yeast (Table 1). Some OSK proteins interacted preferentially with certain subfamilies of F-box proteins. For example, OSK4, OSK12 and OSK16 interacted with an F-box protein (02g0260200) belonging to the FBX subfamily, but did not interact with members of the other groups (Fig. 4). In the case of OSK5, OSK6, OSK9 and OSK30, the expression was very low and below the detectable level by protein blotting and hence it was indicated as ‘not determined’ for combinations involving these proteins (Table 1). On the other hand, the same F-box protein (02g0260200) interacted with other members of the OSK family such as OSK1, OSK15 and OSK20. It appears, therefore, that the majority of interactions were observed with the FBX group (Fig. 4). In contrast, the FBL2 (Os05g0425700) F-box member interacted with only two OSK proteins: OSK1 and OSK20. On the other hand, OSK1 and OSK20 were found to interact with all the F-box proteins tested and belonging to three different subfamilies: FBX, FBL and FBK (Fig. 4). In addition, the F-box protein Gibberellin-insensitive dwarf2 (GID2) , which is essential for GA-mediated DELLA protein degradation, interacted with OSK1, OSK13, OSK20 and OSK25 (Table 1; Fig. 4).

Bold (+) indicates that interaction was detected in only one combination. ND, not determined.Interactions of eight rice OSK proteins with representative F-box proteins were determined using yeast two-hybrid analysis. To generate prey (AD-fusion) and bait (BD-fusion) constructs, we fused full-length OSK and F-box proteins with the GAL4 activation domain and GAL4 DNA binding-domain, respectively. The constructs were tested with both combinations. Positive AD-X and DB-X interacting clones were examined for self-activation. Each co-transformation was plated onto a nutritionally selective plate. X-gal assays was used. Strong interacting clones and weak interacting clones produced a dark blue and a light blue colour, respectively, whereas non-interacting clones remained white. We observed self-activation for OSK4, OSK12 and OSK15 in bait (BD-fusion) constructs. Most interactions were observed with the FBX (02g0260200) F-box protein with both combinations.Interactions of eight rice OSK proteins with representative F-box proteins were determined using yeast two-hybrid analysis.

Most interactions were observed with the FBX (02g0260200) F-box protein with both combinations.Concerning the F-box proteins, four belonging to the FBA, FBD, FBT and FBDUF subfamilies did not display any detectable interaction under our experimental conditions, even after 24 h of incubation at 37°C during the X-gal assays (Table 1). To verify that the negative interactions were not merely due to a lack of protein production by the yeast, we examined the expression of OSK and F-box proteins fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain in yeast by western blotting with the Gal4 monoclonal antibody. We observed the expression of fusion proteins in 26 OSK (Fig. 5). However, no fusion proteins for OSK5, OSK6, OSK9 or OSK30 were detected. For all F-box fusion proteins, the presence of a fusion protein in yeast cells was confirmed by western blotting (Fig. 5). Therefore, we considered that the negative interactions observed with some of the OSK and F-box proteins reflected the genuine behaviour of these proteins in Y2H, rather than a technical artefact due to the absence of interactors.

DiscussionComprehensive analyses of the SKP1 protein family in C. elegans demonstrated that the 21 SKP1-related genes displayed various interaction capabilities with different F-box proteins, with SKR1 being the most prone to interact in vitro.16 In plants, similar comprehensive analyses performed to date have only concerned the model plant A. thaliana.8,13,18 In contrast, although it is clear that all sequenced plant genomes contain several SKP1-like genes, no systematic analysis of their binding capabilities has been performed so far. We, therefore, decided to carry out a comprehensive study in rice, a monocot model.4.1. OSK1 and OSK20 belong to a class of SKP1 genes that contain one intron in a conserved positionPhylogenetic studies have suggested that all Arabidopsis and rice SKP1 genes derived from a single ancestral gene.14 This hypothesis was supported by the findings of Kong et al.17 who further suggested that SKP1 genes could be classified as either type Ia, with one intron and two exons, type Ib that are intronless and type II that contain several introns. They suggested that type Ib could have derived from type Ia by retroposition. Their study also stated that the position of the single intron could vary between SKP1 genes, but some of them have a conserved position. Interestingly, Kong et al.17 showed that ASK and OSK genes with a conserved intron occupy basal positions in phylogenetic trees, whereas intronless genes often form terminal clades. To extend their study, we examined the genomic organization of SKP1 genes in the moss P. patens and in 16 monocot and eudicot genomes and defined 4 subclasses of SKP1 genes, among which 1 subclass corresponds to SKP1 genes with 1 intron at a conserved position and contains the rice OSK1 and OSK20, suggesting orthology relationships between these genes. By means of a detailed analysis of certain animal, insect and plant genomes, Henricson et al. suggested that genuine orthologous genes tend to have more conserved intron positions than non-orthologous genes.29 In contrast, the majority (140/288) of the plant SKP1 genes were intronless, suggesting an active retroposition phenomenon.4.2. OSK1 and OSK20 belong to a subclass of highly expressed SKP1 genesOur EST survey indicated that OSK1 and OSK20 are the most widely represented genes in public EST databases, (Supplementary Table S6). These results agreed with Kong et al.'s general finding that animal and plant members of this gene family are not uniformly represented by ESTs in the databases, indicating varied degrees of expression.14 In particular, they showed that 63 (96.9%) of the 65 significantly slowly evolving members have ESTs, whereas 89 (93.7%) of the 95 moderately and rapidly evolving members of animals and plant species did not have ESTs.14 During the present study, our comprehensive comparison of the large collection of microarray data in rice (i.e. Genevestigator platform23) clearly indicated that rice SKP1 genes exhibited an expression profile that was heterogeneous in terms of tissues, conditions and overall intensity. This was in complete agreement with the reports by Takahashi et al. and Kong et al. in Arabidopsis.14,18 Moreover, in all species, where sufficiently large and accessible data were available (A. thaliana, rice and P.patens), SKP1-like genes containing single conserved intron (ASK1 and ASK2 in A. thaliana, OSK1 and OSK20 in rice; PP00028G00760, PP00007G01690 and PP00009G01570 in P. patens) exhibited broad and strong levels of expression when compared with the other SKP1-like genes, suggesting their involvement in various physiological processes, even though other members of the SKP1 gene family (intronless or containing non-conserved introns) could also be strongly expressed under some conditions.4.3. Yeast two-hybrid analysis: OSK proteins interact specifically with F-box proteinsThe yeast two-hybrid matrix method involved a subset of 9 F-box and 30 OSK proteins and uncovered selective and distinctive interactions between the OSK proteins. This result strongly suggests that a combination of OSK proteins with F-box proteins produces diverse substrate selectivity. This has already been shown in many studies.8,16,18 It was pointed out that in C.s elegans, SKP1 proteins (SKR) displayed diverse patterns of interaction with F-box proteins.16 In A. thaliana, some ASK proteins (e.g. ASK1, ASK2, ASK11 and ASK12) were able to interact with a broad spectrum of F-box proteins, whereas others only interacted with a few types of proteins.8,13,18 However, some ASK proteins cannot interact with any F-box proteins.18 Likewise, here, we detected no interaction between 22 of the OSK proteins and F-box proteins tested, which could indicate that these interactions may require additional partners and/or the Y2H technique is not appropriate for the detection of interactions between these proteins. Alternatively, these F-box proteins could be involved in protein complexes other than the SCF, as suggested by Hermand.10 The presence of a large number of F-box proteins in O. sativa implies that a plethora of SCF complexes (which recognize a broad array of substrates) are possible. Yeast two-hybrid analysis showed that several putative F-box proteins interacted with one or more members of the A. thaliana SKP1-like (ASK) family.9 In fact, our study revealed that OSK1 is not the only one partner of GID2. The Gomi studies reported that GID2 preferentially interacted with OsSKP15 (OSK1).30 Our results may, therefore, indicate that GID2 is a component of the SCF complex, not only through its interaction with OSK1 but also through its interaction with other OSK members (OSK13, OSK20 and OSK25). Interestingly, we observed that the majority of interactions were observed with the (Os02g0260200 = LOC_Os02g15950) F-box protein that belongs to the FBX subgroup. This gene is homologous to—and belongs to—the same orthology group as Arabidopsis gene At3g61590 that has been shown to interact with all, but two of the ASK tested.18 This result may suggest conservation in these genes between rice and Arabidopsis at the level of interaction capabilities.4.4. Comparison of key amino acid sequences between Oryza OSK proteins and the human Skp1 proteinApart from some specific interactions, we noted that the majority of the positive interactions observed involved OSK1 or OSK20. In this respect, they resembled Skr1 and Skr2 in C. elegans,16 ASK1 and ASK2 and possibly ASK11 that have been found to be implicated in most positive interactions with F-box proteins in A. thaliana.8,18 It has been suggested that these non-specific interacting SKP1 proteins should be named the ‘master components’ of SCF complexes.8 Kong et al.14 and Risseeuw et al.8 also noted that these proteins shared the majority of the 26 amino acids that have been shown to contact the human SKP2 F-box protein.31,32 In this study, we found that OSK1 and OSK20 shared, respectively, 23 and 24 of the 26 key amino acids with Hs-SKP1 (Supplementary Fig. S1).4.5. ConclusionThe plant SKP1 genes could be split into different subfamilies, among which one contains presumably ancestral members from which the other SKP1-like genes have evolved within each species.17 From a compilation of publicly available data, results from previous studies and the Y2H results described in this study, we can suggest that: (i) typical members of this subclass contain two exons, the first exon being of variable length and the second exon being 174 bp (58 amino acids) long, with one intron in a conserved position, (ii) members of this subclass are widely and strongly expressed throughout the whole plant and (iii) they are able to interact with the majority of F-box proteins and may, therefore, participate in the formation of most of the SCF complexes found in plant cells. Based on these criteria, we suggest that rice OSK1 and OSK20 are likely to be functionally equivalent to Arabidopsis ASK1 and ASK2 genes, and we propose functional orthologues for 15 other plants (Supplementary Table S4).Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by a grant from the Tunisian Ministry of Higher Education and Research for a Doctoral Scholarship concerning the first author.The authors would like to thank Monique Sibaud for her technical assistance, Dominique Marcon for images of the Y2H interactions and Nelly Lajoinie for growing the plants.

Several recent studies support the AAA'A'BBB'B' model, but its complexity has hindered genetic and genomic analysis of this important crop. To overcome this difficulty and to assist genome-wide analysis of F. × ananassa, we constructed an integrated linkage map by organizing a total of 4474 of simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers collected from published Fragaria sequences, including 3746 SSR markers [Fragaria vesca expressed sequence tag (EST)-derived SSR markers] derived from F. vesca ESTs, 603 markers (F. × ananassa EST-derived SSR markers) from F. × ananassa ESTs, and 125 markers (F. × ananassa transcriptome-derived SSR markers) from F. × ananassa transcripts. Along with the previously published SSR markers, these markers were mapped onto five parent-specific linkage maps derived from three mapping populations, which were then assembled into an integrated linkage map. The constructed map consists of 1856 loci in 28 linkage groups (LGs) that total 2364.1 cM in length. Macrosynteny at the chromosome level was observed between the LGs of F. × ananassa and the genome of F. vesca. Variety distinction on 129 F. × ananassa lines was demonstrated using 45 selected SSR markers.1. IntroductionThe cultivated strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa) is one of the most popular and globally consumed fruit crops. It is cultivated in various regions throughout the world; in 2010, 39% of the cultivated strawberry crop was produced in North and South America, followed by Europe (33%), Asia (18%), and Africa (9%).1 Because of the economic importance of this species, breeding programmes of cultivated strawberry are underway in many countries. To date, more than 3000 varieties bred in 41 countries have been registered in the International Union for the Protection and New Varieties of Plants variety database.2 However, despite intensive use of F. × ananassa in the industry, the progress of genetic and genomic research of this crop has lagged behind that of many other economically important plant species, because of its complex genome structure.Fragaria × ananassa is an octoploid (2n = 8x = 56) species that originated from a natural hybridization between Fragaria virginiana and Fragaria chiloensis.3 The genome composition of F. × ananassa was initially proposed as AABBBBCC4 or AAA'A'BBBB,5 based on results of cytological studies. Later, Bringhurst6 proposed the AAA'A'BBB'B' model in light of cytological and genetic evidence. Unlike the first two models, the last model suggests disomic inheritance in entire chromosomes. Although the genome composition of F. × ananassa has not yet been confirmed, the AAA'A'BBB'B' model has been supported by recent molecular genetic studies.7–11 The genus Fragaria belongs to the Rosaceae family. Unlike other genera in the Rosaceae family, Fragaria comprises a limited number of species (approximately 22).12 Several species have been nominated as candidate diploid ancestors such as Fragaria vesca, Fragaria iinumae, and Fragaria daltoniana.13,14 Of these candidates, F. vesca is considered to be the most likely diploid ancestor, and it serves as a model species of F. × ananassa.14 Therefore, genomic and genetic studies in F. vesca have been performed prior to those of F. × ananassa.In molecular genetics studies, several types of F. vesca sequence-derived DNA markers, such as simple sequence repeat (SSR) and sequence-characterized amplified region (SCAR) markers, have been developed since 200315–19 (in this article, ‘DNA marker’ is defined as ‘unique DNA sequence(s) identified by specific primers’). Linkage maps were then constructed with a population derived from an interspecific cross between F. vesca and Fragaria nubicola.20–23 In genomic studies, bacterial artificial chromosome and fosmid libraries were constructed to investigate features of genome sequences of F. vesca.24,25 Subsequently, a whole genome sequence for F. vesca was published in 2011, and the results have greatly contributed to advances in genomic and genetic analysis of the genus Fragaria.26 In parallel, comparative genomics studies within the Rosaceae family have also been performed. Cabrera et al.27 developed a total of 1039 Rosaceae-conserved orthologous set (RosCOS) markers. Primer pairs of the RosCOS markers were designed on intron-flanking regions of orthologous genes commonly conserved among the genera Malus, Fragaria, and Prunus and mapped onto a Prunus reference linkage map. After the genome sequence in F. vesca was published,26 whole genome comparisons between Fragaria, Prunus, and Malus were performed, and major orthologous regions were identified across the genus.28In F. × ananassa, the first linkage map was constructed with 235 or 285 amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers on 28 or 30 linkage groups (LGs) based on a 2-way pseudo-testcross strategy.29 Several linkage maps were subsequently constructed with AFLP, SCAR, sequence-tagged site, random amplified polymorphic DNA, and SSR markers.8–11,30 All the previously published linkage maps were generated based on single F1 mapping populations, and integrated linkage maps were developed in each mapping population in all four studies.8,10,11,30 Of the previously developed linkage maps, the densest map was constructed by Sargent et al.10; a total of 549 loci were mapped onto 28 LGs, with a total length of 2140.3 cM. The density of the map was greatly enhanced over previous maps, but several unsaturated LGs were still observed such as the unintegrated LG pair of FG2DA and FG2DB and LG6B that contained large gaps (36.7 cM). These results suggest the need to develop a denser linkage map in F. × ananassa to reveal the complex genome structure of this species.In this study, we performed SSR marker development and constructed an integrated high density linkage map to accelerate the advancement of genomic and genetic studies in F. × ananassa. Three types of SSR markers were developed, namely F. vesca expressed sequence tag (EST)-derived SSR markers (FVES markers), F. × ananassa EST-derived SSR markers (FAES markers), and F. × ananassa transcriptome-derived SSR markers (FATS markers), using public genome sequence data. The markers were mapped onto five parent-specific linkage maps, along with previously published DNA markers, and the five parent-specific maps were then integrated into one map. The applicability of the integrated map and the markers developed in this study were also demonstrated by comparative analysis of F. × ananassa and F. vesca and by variety distinction on 129 F. × ananassa lines with selected markers. The markers and integrated linkage map described in this study are valuable resources for future studies that will help to elucidate the genome structure and evolutionary process in F. × ananassa and whole genome sequencing, genetic mapping, and molecular breeding of this species.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materialAn integrated linkage map was constructed using three mapping populations originating from a total of five parental lines. ‘02–19’ × ‘Sachinoka’ is an F1 mapping population of 188 individuals derived from a one-way pseudo-testcross. The female parent ‘02–19’ is a breeding line developed in Chiba Prefectural Agriculture and Forestry Research Center, which is resistant to powdery mildew and Fusarium wilt. The male parent ‘Sachinoka’ is a Japanese variety bred in the National Agricultural Research Center for Kyusyu and Okinawa Region, which was derived from a cross between ‘Toyonoka’ and ‘Aiberry’. ‘Kaorino’ × ‘Akihime’ consisted of 140 F1 individuals derived from a one-way pseudo-testcross between the parental lines. ‘Kaorino’ and ‘Akihime’ were bred in Mie Prefecture Agricultural Research Institute and by Mr Kazuhiro Ogiwara in Japan, respectively. One of the ancestor lines of ‘Kaorino’ is ‘Akihime’. ‘Kaorino’ exhibits crown rot resistance, whereas ‘Akihime’ is susceptible to the disease. The ‘0212921’ mapping population consisted of 169 S1 individuals of ‘0212921’. ‘0212921’ was generated from a cross between two breeding lines developed in Mie Prefecture Agricultural Research Institute, and the male parent of ‘0212921’ was identical to the female parent of ‘Kaorino’.2.2. Development of EST-derived SSR markersSSR regions were identified from the F. vesca and F. × ananassa ESTs registered in public databases, namely NCBI's nucleotide database (http://www.ncbi.nih.gov). The numbers of ESTs that were investigated include 45 739 and 6117 in F. vesca and F. × ananassa, respectively. SSRs longer than 14 bases, which contained all possible combinations of dinucleotide (NN), trinucleotide (NNN) and tetranucleotide (NNNN) repeats, were identified using the FINDPATTERNS module in the GCG software package (Accelrys Inc., USA). Oligonucleotides for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers were designed based on the flanking regions of the identified SSRs using the Primer3 program31 in such a way that the amplified products ranged from 90 to 300 bp in length. Markers corresponding to previously published SSR markers in the Fragaria spp and RosCOS of markers8,10,15,17–23,27,32–39 were identified based on primer sequences and were excluded from the collection of FVES and FAES markers.2.3. Development of transcriptome-derived SSR markersA total of 1 188 226 F. × ananassa transcript sequence reads registered in NCBI's Sequence Read Achive (SRA, Accession number: SRX16008) were used for identification of the SSR regions. All reads were generated using the Roche 454 sequencing system (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). The MIRA 3.2.0 program was used for assembling non-redundant contigs.40 Methods for identification of SSR regions and primer design were the same as those used for FVES and FAES marker development, except that penta- and hexanucleotide repeats were also identified and used for primer design. After designing the primer sequences, the redundancy between the FVES, FAES, and published markers described in the above section was confirmed. The newly developed markers were designated FATS markers.2.4. Polymorphic analysis of the DNA markersDNA was extracted from the young leaves of plants using a DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen Inc., Germany). DNA quantification and quality checks were performed using an ND1000 NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technologies, DE, USA) and 0.8% agarose gels. In addition to the FVES, FAES, and FATS markers, a total of 1114 primer pairs of previously published SSR markers developed from Fragaria sequences and RosCOS markers were used for polymorphic analysis of the ‘02–19’ × ‘Sachinoka’ mapping population (Supplementary Table S1).8,15,17–21,23,27,32–38 Polymorphic analysis of the other two populations was performed without using published markers. PCR was performed in a 5-µl reaction volume using 0.6 ng of genomic DNA in 1X PCR buffer (Bioline, UK), 3 mM MgCl2, 0.08 U of BIOTAQ DNA polymerase (Bioline, UK), 0.8 mM dNTPs, and 0.4 µM of each primer. A modified touchdown PCR protocol was followed as described by Sato et al.41 The PCR products were separated by 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in tris-borate-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (TBE) buffer according to the standard protocol or with an ABI 3730xl fluorescent fragment analyzer (Applied Biosystems, USA), according to the polymorphic fragment sizes of the PCR amplicons. In the former case, the data were analysed using the Polyans software (http://www.polyans.kazusa.or.jp), whereas in the latter case, polymorphisms were investigated using the GeneMapper software (Applied Biosystems, USA).2.5. Linkage analysisIn this study, it was assumed that F. × ananassa is an allo-octoploid species and that polymorphic loci in entire chromosomes showed disomic inheritance. Therefore, linkage analysis was performed using the methodology employed with diploid and outcrossing species. The segregated data of the two pseudo-testcross mapping populations were categorized into two parent-specific data sets by comparing the sizes of polymorphic bands of the parents and progeny. The segregation data were rescored using the ‘HAP1’ or ‘F2’ population type codes employed in JoinMap analysis.42 ‘HAP1’ codes were used for the four parental lines of the ‘02–19’ × ‘Sachinoka’ and ‘Kaorino’ × ‘Akihime’, whereas ‘F2’ codes were employed for the parents of the S1 population ‘0212921’. As a result, a total of five parent-specific data sets were generated. The segregation data from each parent-specific data set were then classified into multiple LGs using the colour map method43 that employed a comparison of graphical genotypes of the segregation data. During the process of colour mapping, reciprocal genotypes were converted to coupling genotypes. The robustness of the data sets for each LG was then confirmed using the Grouping Module of the JoinMap program, version 4, with a logarithm of odds (LOD) threshold of 10. The homeologous LGs within each parent-specific map were assumed based on corresponding positions on the F. vesca genome, which were predicted by comparative analysis (described below).The locus orders in each parent-specific map were calculated using the Regression Mapping Module of JoinMap. ‘0212921’-specific data were handled as an ‘F2’ population type, whereas other parent-specific data sets were calculated as ‘HAP1’ population types. The following parameters were used for the calculation: Kosambi's mapping function, LOD = 1.0, REC frequency =0.4, goodness of fit jump threshold for removal of loci = 5.0, number of added loci after which a ripple is performed = 1, and third round = yes. Each LG in parent-specific maps was named according to the following rule: numbers after LG (1–7) showed corresponding chromosome numbers of F. vesca predicted by comparative analysis (described below). The capital letters A–D distinguished four LGs in each homeologous group (HG), which corresponded to LGs in an integrated map. The A–D suffixes corresponded to the lengths of the LGs on the integrated map. When multiple LGs were integrated into a single LG of the integrated map, they were numbered using capital letters with underbars (e.g. LG1B_1 and LG1B_2). For unintegrated LGs, X or Y was used as a suffix.For construction of an integrated linkage map, corresponding LGs between the parent-specific maps were assumed by identification of commonly mapped markers on each LG. Prior to integration, genotypes of dominant loci in each parent-specific map were imputed to co-dominant genotypes, according to the flanking genotypes of co-dominant loci. That is, alleles of dominant loci were converted to co-dominant alleles, according to the flanking genotypes of co-dominant loci. Parent-specific locus genotype data sets were then integrated into one dataset in each LG using the Combine Groups for Mapping Integration Module, followed by locus ordering by the Regression Mapping Module of JoinMap. The parameters used for the mapping module of an integrated map were the same as those used for parent-specific mapping. After construction of an integrated map, the mapped loci were classified into two groups, i.e. loci generated from single-locus diagnostic (SLD) and multi-loci diagnostic (MLD) markers. SLD markers were defined as markers that detected single segregation bands mapped onto single positions on an integrated map, and not amplified other loci, such as monomorphic loci, whereas MLD markers were defined as markers that amplified more than one locus, including monomorphic loci.2.6. Comparative mappingSyntenic regions between the genomes of F. × ananassa and F. vesca were detected by identifying the conservation of the relative locations of genes and genomic regions. The source of the genome sequences of F. vesca was obtained from NCBI [Accession numbers: CM001053.1-CM001059.1 (LG1-7), GG775183.1- GG775301.1 (unplaced)]. The EST sequences adjacent to the mapped markers on the integrated F. × ananassa map were compared with the gene sequences in the reference genomes using the BLASTX program with a cutoff E-value = 1e-10. The syntenic regions defined by the top hits of the homology search were plotted using the Cicros program (http://circos.ca).2.7. Distinguishing the varieties of 129 F. × ananassa lines using selected EST-SSR markerswhere Pip and Pia are the frequency of presence and absence of the ith peak. In F. × ananassa, SSR markers often identify multi loci due to polyploidy, and it is often difficult to investigate the exact number of loci identified in each marker in an unrelated population. Therefore, the mean HZ value of identified peaks generated by a marker was substituted for the HZ of each marker. The allelic binary data were also analysed using GGT 2.045 for the investigation of genetic similarity between the varieties using a Jaccard similarity coefficient. A unweighted pair group method (UPGMA) with arithmetic average dendrogram was constructed using MEGA version 5.05.463. Results3.1. Development of EST-SSR markersA total of 2748 and 324 SSRs were identified in non-redundant 15 203 F. vesca and 1029 F. × ananassa ESTs, respectively. Of the identified SSRs, 562 primers were designed based on the flanking regions of 453 F. vesca- and 109 F. × ananassa-derived EST-SSRs and designated FVES and FAES markers. To increase the number of EST-SSR markers, additional primer pairs were designed that allowed either single-base mismatches (779 and 107 primer pairs for FVES and FAES markers, respectively) or two-base mismatches (2514 and 387 primer pairs for FVES and FAES markers, respectively) in the SSR regions. Of the markers that were generated, those corresponding to previously published markers were excluded.8,10,15,17–23,27,32–39 As a result, a total of 3746 FVES and 603 FAES markers were developed. Design details of the FVES and FAES markers, including primer sequences, corresponding SSR motifs, expected product sizes, and GenBank IDs of the template EST sequences, are listed in Supplementary Tables S3 and S4 and on the web at http://marker.kazusa.or.jp/strawberry/.Of the FVES and FAES markers that were developed, 2975 (79.4%) and 431 (71.5%) were trinucleotide repeats while 456 (12.2%) and 117 (19.4%) were dinucleotide repeats, and 315 (8.4%) and 55 (9.1%) were tetranucleotide repeats, respectively (Table 1). In the FVES markers, the poly (AAG)n motif was most abundant in the trinucleotide repeats (755 SSRs, 20.1%), followed by poly (GGA)n (492 SSRs, 13.1%), poly (ATC)n (352 SSRs, 9.4%), poly (AG)n (347 SSRs, 9.3%), and poly (AGC)n (321 SSRs, 8.6%). Like the FVES markers, the poly (AAG)n motif was the most frequently observed motif in the FAES markers (132 SSRs, 21.9%). This was followed by poly (AG)n (81 SSRs, 13.4%), poly (ATC)n (68 SSRs, 11.3%), and poly (AGC)n (48 SSRs, 8.0%). Among the tetranucleotide repeats, AT-rich motifs, namely poly (AAAG)n, and poly (AAAC)n, were more frequently observed than other motifs in both the FVES and FAES markers. Numbers of SSR motifs in the FVES, FAES, and FATS markersaThe numbers of types of observed ‘other’ SSR motifs in di- and trinucleotide repeats and all penta- and hexa- nucleotide repeats were 4, 24, 6, and 37, respectively.Numbers of SSR motifs in the FVES, FAES, and FATS markersaThe numbers of types of observed ‘other’ SSR motifs in di- and trinucleotide repeats and all penta- and hexa- nucleotide repeats were 4, 24, 6, and 37, respectively.3.2. Development of transcriptome-SSR markersA total of 1 188 226 SRA sequences were assembled into 80 430 contigs by the MIRA 3.2.0 program.38 On these contigs, 34 993 SSRs were identified. Primers that targeted the flanking regions of 129 of the 34 993 SSRs were designed and synthesized. All the 129 SSRs were located on non-redundant contigs, and a total of 125 primers, which did not overlap with the FVES, FAES, and previously published markers,,8,10,15,17–23,27,32–39 were designed as FATS markers. The primer sequences of the FATS markers, along with the corresponding SSR motifs, product sizes, primer sequences, and template contigs, are provided on the web at http://marker.kazusa.or.jp/strawberry/ and in Supplementary Table S5. Of the 125 FATS markers, trinucleotide repeats were the most frequently observed (56 SSRs, 44.8%), followed by hexanucleotide repeats (37 SSRs, 29.6%), and dinucleotide repeats (25 SSRs, 20.0%, Table 1). No tetranucleotide repeats were observed, whereas seven pentanucleotide repeats were identified. Of the SSR motifs, the poly (AG)n motif was the most abundant (10 SSRs, 8.0%), followed by poly (TC)n (7 SSRs, 5.6%), and poly (AAG)n (5 SSRs, 4.0%). In the penta- and hexanucleotide repeats, each single SSR was identified for all the observed motifs except poly (GCTGT)n (two SSRs, data not shown).3.3. Construction of parent-specific linkage mapsA total of 4474 primer pairs of SSR markers, including 3746 FVES, 603 FAES, and 125 FATS, were investigated with 8 randomly chosen S1 individuals of the ‘0212921’ mapping population. Polymorphisms were observed on 605 FVES, 135 FAES, and 29 FATS markers, and segregation analysis was performed for 169 S1 individuals with 769 primer pairs. A total of 881 segregation locus genotypes were generated from the 769 primer pairs, and 822 of the 881 loci were mapped onto 34 LGs (Supplementary Tables S6 and S7). The length of each LG ranged from 1.5 cM (LG4B) to 94.5 cM (LG1A), representing a total length of 1508.3 cM. The mean locus density and segregation distortion (P < 0.05) were 1.83 cM locus-1 and 22.4%, respectively, ranging from 0.22 cM locus-1 (LG6D) to 4.26 cM locus-1 (LG2A_2) and from 0.0% (LG4B) to 85.7% (LG5A_1), respectively.Polymorphic analysis was performed with a total of 5588 primer pairs of SSR markers, including 4474 SSR markers developed in this study and 1114 previously published markers (Supplementary Table S1). A total of 1299 markers, i.e. 853 FVES, 131 FAES, 37 FATS, and 278 published markers, showed polymorphisms between the parental lines. By performing segregation analysis of the 188 individuals of the mapping population, 1078 polymorphic loci were generated from 881 of the 1299 primer pairs that were tested. Of the 1078 segregation loci, 260 showed biparental polymorphisms while the other 818 were parent specific. A total of 575 and 556 loci were mapped onto ‘02–19’ and ‘Sachinoka’ specific maps, respectively (Supplementary Tables S6 and S7). In the ‘02–19’ specific map, 32 LGs were constructed on 1668.9 cM, with lengths ranging from 2.0 cM (LG2X) to 129.2 cM (LG1A). The mean locus density and segregation distortion (P < 0.05) were 2.90 cM locus-1 and 30.2%, respectively, ranging from 0.34 cM locus-1 (LG5A_2) to 11.63 cM locus-1 (LG6C) and from 0.0% (LG3B_2, 5A_2 and 7D_2) to 100% (LG2X and 4B), respectively. In the ‘Sachinoka’ map, 34 LGs were developed, totalling 2166.6 cM in length, with a mean locus density of 3.90 cM locus-1. The length and locus density of each LG ranged from 1.6 cM (LG7C_2) to 120.0 cM (LG7A) and from 0.80 cM locus-1 (LG7C_2) to 16.08 cM locus-1 (LG3X), respectively. Segregation distortion (P < 0.05) of each LG ranged from 0.0% (LG7C_2, 7D_1 and 7X) to 85.7% (LG2X), with a mean value of 25.4%.A total of 4474 primer pairs of SSR markers developed in this study were used for polymorphic analysis with the parental lines. Polymorphisms were observed in 438 FVES, 95 FAES, and 33 FATS markers, and segregation analysis was performed with the 140 mapping plants, for a total of 566 primer pairs. A total of 612 segregation locus genotypes were generated from 537 of the 566 primer pairs that were tested. Of the 612 segregation loci, 140 showed biparental polymorphisms while the other 472 were parent specific. A total of 294 and 318 loci were mapped onto ‘Kaorino’ and ‘Akihime’ specific maps, respectively (Supplementary Tables S6 and S7). The ‘Kaorino’ map consisted of 32 LGs, representing a total length of 1103.4 cM. The mean locus density and segregation distortion (P < 0.05) were 3.75 cM locus-1 and 24.8%, respectively, ranging from 0.45 cM locus-1 (LG1B_2) to 7.61 cM locus-1 (LG1A) and from 0.0% (LG1B_2, 1X, 2A, 2D, 4X, 5A_1, 5X, 6A_2, 6A_3 and 7D) to 100% (LG4D_2), respectively. In the ‘Akihime’ map, 33 LGs were developed, with a total length of 951.4 cM and a mean locus density of 2.99 cM locus-1. The length and locus density of each LG ranged from 2.2 cM (LG5X) to 77.7 cM (LG7A) and from 0.55 cM locus-1 (LG5X) to 12.72 cM locus-1 (LG6A_4), respectively. Segregation distortion (P < 0.05) of each LG ranged from 0.0% (LG3X, 4A_2, 4C, 5A, 5C, 5X, 6A_1, 6B_1, 6B_2, and 7D_2) to 100% (LG1A_1), with a 14.8% mean value.3.4. Construction of an integrated linkage mapPrior to integration, the subsets of parent-specific LGs to be integrated were determined by the numbers of commonly mapped markers across parent-specific maps, that is, pairs of LGs showing the largest number of commonly mapped markers were assembled into the same subset. When one LG showed the same numbers of commonly mapped markers in different pairs, the LG was excluded from the integration. Locus genotype data of each subset of LG were integrated using the Combine Groups for Mapping Integration Module in JoinMap, and the locus orders of an integrated map were then calculated. When grouped LG subsets were inadequate, the segregation loci of incorrect LGs were excluded during the process of locus ordering. When a LG subset was misassembled with incorrect pairs of parent-specific LGs, the loci of the mis-integrated LG overlapped with loci onto other integrated LGs which correctly paired LGs were integrated. Therefore, the correct assembly of a LG subset was determined by confirming the number of overlapping loci on each integrated LG using the Mapping module in JoinMap.The integrated linkage map consisted of 1856 loci on 28 LGs, totalling 2364.1 cM in length (Table 2, Supplementary Table S7 and Fig. S1). The length of each LG varied from 34.2 (LG1D) to 123.7 cM (LG1A). The mean locus density was 1.27 cM locus-1, ranging from 0.68 cM locus-1 (LG6B) to 5.08 cM locus-1 (LG4B). The largest gap was 27.3 cM, between FVES1598_7a and FVES1351_7a on LG7A, followed by a 23.4 cM gap between FAES0326_4b and FAES3462_4b on LG4B, and a 21.6 cM gap between FVES0576_4c and FAES0045 on LG4C. The number of integrated LGs ranged from 1 (LG1D) to 16 (LG6A) parent-specific LGs (Table 2). The number of unintegrated parent-specific LGs, which totalled 17, ranged from 1 (‘0212921’) to 5 (‘Akihime’) in each parental map. The ratios of mapped FVES, FAES, and FATS loci were 77.5, 15, and 3.4%, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S2). The ratio of mapped FVES markers in each LG ranged from 62.5 to 93.3%.

Numbers in parentheses show percentage of all the mapped loci.bNumber of integrated LGs.cNumber of integrated loci.Of the mapped loci, 481 (25.9%) were generated from SLD markers, whereas the other 1375 were from MLD markers. The ratio of mapped loci generated from SLD markers in each LG varied from 9.4% (LG4C) to 41.2% (LG3A). These loci were mapped randomly onto many of the LGs while several clusters were observed on parts of LGs (LG1A, 1C, 2C, 4C, 4D, 6C, 6D, 7B, and 7C, Supplementary Fig. S1). Loci generated from MLD markers were classified into four types; multi loci mapped onto homoeologous LGs (Multi_H in Supplementary Table S7), non-homeologous LGs (Multi_NH), the same LGs (Multi_S), and single position (Multi_NM). For the Multi_NM loci, all the observed multiple bands were monomorphic except for mapped ones. Of the four types of multi loci, Multi_H was most frequently observed (684 loci), followed by Multi_NM (523), Multi_S (206), and Multi_NH (77). Of the 684 Multi_H loci, 16 and 99 were observed, corresponding to loci on non-homeologous LGs (Multi_H&NH) and the same LGs (Multi_H&S), respectively. The Multi_H loci were randomly distributed along the entire integrated linkage map, whereas Multi_S loci were not observed on several LGs, i.e. LG2B, 2D, 3C, 4D, 5A, 5B, 7B, and 7C (Supplementary Fig. S1). In each HG, the homeologous regions differed depending on the paired LGs (Supplementary Fig. S3). For example, most homeologous regions of LG2A and LG2C were observed on 20–40 cM while those of LG2B and LG2D were identified on 60–80 cM. In the case of HG1, homeologous regions were not observed between LG1C and LG1D. Such biases of homeologous pairs were identified across the genome.3.5. Comparison with the genomes of a wild relative, F. vescaOf the 3746 ESTs that corresponded to the designed FVES markers, 3743 showed significant similarities to the genome sequences of F. vesca, while 3 ESTs, corresponding to FVES1248, FVES2637, and FVES2807, did not (Supplementary Table S3). Of the 3743 ESTs, 3608 showed similarities to genome sequences placed on 7 chromosomes of F. vesca, and the other 135 were mapped onto unplaced genomic scaffolds. In F. × ananassa sequence-derived markers, significant similarities to the F. vesca genome sequences were observed in all 603 ESTs and 124 of the 125 transcript contigs from which FAES and FATS markers were designed, respectively (Supplementary Table S4 and S5). Of these, 593 and 120 sequences corresponding to FAES and FATS markers, respectively, were mapped onto F. vesca genome sequences placed on the 7 chromosomes, whereas the other 14 ESTs or transcript contigs were mapped onto unplaced scaffolds. Similarity searches were also performed for the previously published markers that were located on the integrated map. Of the 91 mapped previously published markers, 68 ESTs or genome sequence are available on the NCBI dbGSS database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/dbGSS, Supplementary Table S1) from which the markers were designed. Of the 68 sequences, 62 showed significant similarities to the F. vesca genome sequences placed onto the 7 chromosomes.A total of 1354 markers that generated 1783 mapped loci onto the integrated linkage map showed significant similarity with F. vesca genome sequences placed onto the 7 chromosomes. By considering the sequences with highest similarity scores to be putative orthologs, the map locations of the SSR markers and the corresponding F. vesca genome sequences were compared. As shown in Fig. 1, the alignment of homologous sequence pairs along each LG revealed an obvious syntenic relationship between corresponding HGs in F. × ananassa (Fa-HG) and chromosomes (Chr) in F. vesca (Fv-Chr). Most of the regions did not show synteny between non-corresponding Fa-HGs and Fv-Chr, except between Fa-HG3 and 25–30 Mb on Fv-Chr2. In some LGs in F. × ananassa, syntenic regions were observed on whole corresponding chromosomes in F. vesca, whereas segmental syntenic blocks were identified between pairs of the other Fa-LGs and Fv-Chr (Supplementary Fig. S3-1). For example, Fa-LG1A displayed syntenies against entire regions of Fv-Chr1, whereas segmental syntenic blocks were observed between 0 and 11 Mb in Fv-Chr1 and Fa-LG1B or Fa-LG1D, as well as between 8 and 23 Mb in Fv-Chr1 and Fa-LG1C.

Distinguishing the varieties of 129 F. × ananassa lines using selected EST-SSR markersTo select the best marker set to determine the varieties of the F. × ananassa lines, polymorphic analysis of the 22 cultivated strawberry lines was performed using primer pairs targeting 3746 FVES and 603 FAES markers. In the primer pairs of FVES markers, 2949 resulted in solid amplification, whereas of the remaining primer pairs, 431, 263, and 103 resulted in no amplification, multiple bands, and rare bands, respectively (Supplementary Table S3). In the FAES markers, solid amplification was observed for 460 primer pairs, whereas of the remaining primer pairs, 88, 52, and 3 resulted in no amplification, multiple, and rare bands, respectively (Supplementary Table S4). A total of 751 primer pairs, including 650 FVES and 101 FAES, showed solid and polymorphic amplification and were used for the subsequent investigation of PCR, i.e. the stability of PCR and detection of noise peaks, using a fragment analyzer for all 22 lines. A total of 100 of the 751 primer pairs showing high stability and few noise peaks were selected and used for polymorphic analysis with 129 strawberry lines to reconfirm the robustness of PCR in a more diversified collection. From this experiment, the 45 best markers, which showed high stability in PCR and few noise peaks, were selected. PCR was then performed twice more with the 129 strawberry lines to exclude genotyping errors (Supplementary Table S3).The primer pairs of 45 selected SSR markers, including 4 FAES and 41 FVES markers, generated a total of 158 peaks in the 129 strawberry lines that were tested (http://vim.kazusa.or.jp/Strawberry/). The number of identified peaks per a primer pair ranged from two to seven, with a mean value of 3.51 (Supplementary Fig. S4). The HZ value of each identified peak was calculated based on a score of 1 or 0 for the presence and absence of the peak and ranged from 0 to 0.5. The mean HZ value of each marker ranged from 0.11 to 0.43, with an average value of 0.25. Similarity coefficients were used to examine the genetic relationships between the 129 strawberry lines. All possible genotypes showed similarity coefficients ranging from 0.00 to 0.41 (Supplementary Table S2). No genetic differences were identified with the 45 markers between ‘Nyoho’ and ‘Shinnyoho’ or between ‘Himatsuri’ and ‘Toyonoka’. The highest similarity coefficient, 0.41, was found between the UK variety ‘Serenata’ and the Japanese variety ‘Summer berry’.4. DiscussionIn this study, a total of 4474 SSR markers, including 3746 FVES, 603 FAES, and 125 FATS, were designed from public EST and transcript sequences of F. vesca and F. × ananassa. Of the 4474 SSR markers, 672 resulted in rare or no amplification, and the remaining 3802 SSR markers resulted in amplification. To our knowledge, 441 SSR markers have previously been published for the genus Fragaria.8,10,15,17–23,27,32–39 The number of SSR markers that were developed in this study is approximately 8.6 times that of previously published markers. Recent advances in genome sequencing technology have enabled the large-scale development of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in many of plant species. However, SNP discovery and genotyping are still difficult for polyploidy species because of the difficulty in distinguishing between homeologous allelic SNPs. Therefore, SSR markers are currently the most rapid and conclusive marker system for most polyploid species, including F. × ananassa. The numerous SSR markers developed in this study are an important resource for genetic and genomic studies of this species.In this study, linkage analysis was performed using a methodology previously employed in diploid and outcrossing species with the assumption that F. × ananassa is an allo-octoploid species with an AAA'A'BBB'B' genome structure. The large number of mapped loci that showed disomic inheritance supported this assumption.In the ‘02–19’ × ‘Sachinoka’ and ‘Kaorino’ × ‘Akihime’ populations, polymorphic marker screening was only performed with parental lines that caused failure of screening polymorphic markers showing a <ab × ab> segregation pattern. Meanwhile, eight randomly selected S1 individuals were used in polymorphic marker screening of the ‘0212921’ population, and all possible polymorphic markers were selected. Therefore, we considered that the large differences of the number of mapped loci in the parent-specific maps were due to the steps in polymorphic marker screening and the genetic distances of haplotypes within parents. All the previously published maps in F. × ananassa were derived from F1 mapping populations, and the ‘0212921’ specific map is the first parent-specific map derived from an S1 population. The density of the parent-specific map ‘0212921’ suggests that an S1 population is available for linkage map construction in F. × ananassa.According to a previous study10 and the integrated map developed in this study, the length of a saturated linkage map in F. × ananassa would exceed 2000 cM. The lengths of all the parent-specific maps were shorter than 2000 cM, except the ‘Sachinoka’ map that was 2166.6 cM. In addition, no parent-specific map had 28 LGs, i.e. the number of chromosomes in the haploid genome of F. × ananassa. Therefore, it was concluded that all parental specific maps were unsaturated.The integrated linkage map comprises 1856 loci on 28 LGs. The total length of the map, 2364 cM, is slightly longer than the previously reported densest map, 2140 cM, by Sargent et al.10 The mean locus density of our integrated map was 1.27 cM locus-1, which was three times denser than that of the map of Sargent et al. Moreover, the integrated map presented in this study is the first linkage map derived from multiple mapping populations of F. × ananassa, suggesting that the map reflects wider genetic diversity in the species. Several LGs of the integrated map seemed to be saturated, whereas some of others were not, such as LG1D, LG4B, LG5C, LG5D, LG7B, and LG7C. In addition, the parent-specific LGs were not evenly merged into the LGs in the integrated map. For example, LG6A in the integrated map consists of 16 parent-specific LGs, whereas LG1D was derived from a single parent-specific LG of the ‘0212921’-specific map. One of the causes for the uneven positions of the mapped loci and the number of merged parent-specific LGs may be the bias of heterozygous (polymorphic) genomic regions within each parental line. Moreover, the source of EST-SSR markers might affect the evenness of the mapping. Of the mapped loci on the integrated map, 82% were derived from F. vesca sequences, whereas 14 and 4% markers were generated from F. × ananassa and other species, respectively. Previous molecular and cytogenetic studies suggested that F. vesca and F. iinumae or F. daltoniana were candidate ancestral species of F. × ananassa.13,14 This theory suggests that partial genome regions in F. × ananassa were derived from F. iinumae or F. daltoniana and may show non-homology with the genomes of F. vesca. In addition, the ratio of mapped FVES loci ranged from 62.5 to 93.3% (Supplementary Fig. S2). The large contribution of F. vesca sequence-derived SSR markers on the integrated map may affect the biased position of the mapped loci.Although a total of 107 loci derived from previously published markers were mapped onto the integrated linkage map, we did not employ the corresponding names used in previously published maps. This was due to the insufficient number of commonly mapped markers across linkage maps, along with the large number of mapped multi loci. In this study, ‘A’ to ‘D’ suffixes were added to the LG names, which corresponded to the lengths of the LGs; A was used for the longest LG, whereas D was added to the shortest. Therefore, there are no biological relationships among the LGs designated with the same capital letter suffix. We request the replacing of the capital letters as to represent the genome structure in F. × ananassa, for example AAA'A'BBB'B', after corresponding LGs to each genome, will be identified in future.Loci generated from SLD markers should play an important role in the identification of specific LGs and chromosomes in F. × ananassa. In this study, we mapped both SLD and MLD markers, and 25.9% (481) of the mapped loci were derived from SLD markers. Indeed, the karyotypes of octoploid Fragaria species were already reported in F. chiloensis and F. virginiana,47 as well as in F. × ananassa.48 Using genomic region mapped single loci as probes for cytological analysis such as fluorescence in situ hybridization, corresponding karyotypes of F. × ananassa could be identified on each LG in the integrated map. In addition, the genome structure of F. × ananassa could be resolved by comparative mapping with candidate ancestral Fragaria species using markers detecting single loci.While 25.9% of the mapped loci were generated from SLD markers, the remaining 74.1% (1375) were derived from MLD markers, comprising 569 Multi_H, 16 Multi_H&NH, 99 Multi H&S, 61 Multi_NH, 107 Multi_S, and 523 Multi_NM. The ratio of all Multi_H (including Multi_H&NS and H&S) to the sum of mapped loci (except Multi_NM) was 0.51 [(569 + 16 + 99)/(1856–523)]; that is approximately half of the mapped loci on the integrated map were Multi_H. The Multi_H loci were mapped along the entire genomes. However, corresponding homeologous positions differed depending on the paired LGs. The uneven homeologous regions between each pair of LGs might represent a feature of the genome composition of F. × ananassa.Comparative mapping studies between F. × ananassa and F. vesca have been reported.8–11 According to previous results, most of the genomic regions are conserved between the two species, with the rare exception of chromosome rearrangement on HG1, HG3, and HG6. Results from our comparative mapping study generally agreed with those of previous studies, i.e. the identification of clear macrosynteny over both entire genomes. However, our results suggest that partial rearrangement occurred more frequently between homeologous genomes in F. × ananassa and F. vesca than previously reported. In addition, genomic rearrangement across HGs was first observed in this study, i.e. between Fv-Chr2 and Fa-HG3 (Fig. 1). Of the LGs belonging to HG3, LG3A, 3B and 3C showed the genomic rearrangement, whereas it was not observed on LG3D.The varieties of 129 F. × ananassa lines were distinguished to demonstrate the practicable utility of the markers developed in this study. Ninety-one percent (118 of 129) of the tested lines were developed in Japan. Because most Japanese lines were developed from a limited number of ancestral lines, such as ‘Haward17’ and ‘General Chanzy’, genetic diversity is considered to be generally narrow in Japanese germplasm.49 Despite the expected narrow genetic diversity, the 45 SSR markers employed in this study identified most of the tested lines except for 2 pairs, ‘Nyoho’ and ‘Shin-Nyoho’ and ‘Toyonoka’ and ‘Himatsuri’. ‘Shin-Nyoho’ and ‘Himatsuri’ were developed from mutation lines of ‘Toyonika’ and ‘Nyoho’, respectively. Therefore, it was assumed that the genetic diversities were quite narrow in each pair of undistinguished varieties. Meanwhile, it is notable that the ‘Anter’, ‘Pihyaradondon’, and ‘Nyoho’ lines and the ‘Akita Berry’ and ‘Morioka 16’ lines could be distinguished from each other, although the former two and one of the varieties are mutant lines of ‘Nyoho’ and ‘Morioka 16’, respectively.Variety identification is one of the major practical uses of DNA markers. Such identification should protect breeders' rights and inhibit the contamination of clonal seedlings during propagation. Because unknown samples are often used in variety identification, the accurate detection of targeted peaks is essential. In addition, it is well known that PCR results can vary depending on experimental conditions such as the type of thermal cycler and Taq polymerase employed during PCR analysis. In a previous study, Kunihisa44 investigated the stability of polymorphic analysis of CAPS markers by comparing the results obtained in 14 laboratories to verify the adequacy of the makers used for variety identification tests in F. × ananassa. Govan et al.50 also screened 32 SSRs that produced reliable PCR results for the identification of 60 varieties. In the present study, the 45 SSR markers were carefully screened by confirming the results of 3 independent PCRs. The 36 out of the 45 markers were mapped onto a total of 20 LGs of the integrated map. It suggested that the polymorphisms of selected markers roughly reflect genetic diversity in entire genome. Therefore, the markers were found to be reliable for variety identification.In this study, we developed large numbers of SSR markers and constructed the densest linkage map for F. × ananassa. By performing comparative mapping and variety distinction, the resources that we developed were shown to be useful for genetic and genomic analysis as well as practical applications. Our results should contribute to the acceleration of advances in the study of F. × ananassa, along with the genus Fragaria.Supplementary DataSupplementary Data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by the Kazusa DNA Research Institute Foundation, research and development projects for application in promoting new policies of agriculture, forestry and fisheries (21010) funded by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries.We thank Dr Satoru Matsumoto at the National Agriculture and Food Research Organization, Institute of Fruit Tree Science, Dr Toshi Nishimoto at Nara Prefectural Agriculture Research Center, and Toshihiro Tanaka at Wakayama Research Center of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, for providing F. × ananassa DNA or plant material.Supplementary data"

Understanding the molecular basis of these characteristics and improving the efficiency of such breeding programmes require the development of genomic information and tools. However, despite its economic relevance, genomic information on olive or closely related species is still scarce. We have applied Sanger and 454 pyrosequencing technologies to generate close to 2 million reads from 12 cDNA libraries obtained from the Picual, Arbequina, and Lechin de Sevilla cultivars and seedlings from a segregating progeny of a Picual × Arbequina cross. The libraries include fruit mesocarp and seeds at three relevant developmental stages, young stems and leaves, active juvenile and adult buds as well as dormant buds, and juvenile and adult roots. The reads were assembled by library or tissue and then assembled together into 81 020 unigenes with an average size of 496 bases. Here, we report their assembly and their functional annotation.1. IntroductionOlea europaea L. is one of the most important and widespread fruit trees in the Mediterranean basin, with 95% of the 750 million olive trees cultivated worldwide, being Spain and Italy the main growers.1,2 Olive, one of the first plants to be cultivated for oil production, is the second most important oil fruit crop cultivated worldwide, with over 8 million hectares of land devoted to its cultivation.3 Most olive production is destined for olive oil, ranking sixth of all vegetable oils produced worldwide.4 Virgin olive oil is a natural fruit juice with no additives or preservatives and a unique flavour, increasingly demanded for its potential health benefits, exceptional nutritional properties, and exceptional organoleptic properties. These characteristics, and a high oxidative stability, are all due to a well-balanced fatty acid composition and the presence of minor components such as natural antioxidants and vitamins.Olive is a diploid (2n = 46), predominantly allogamous, vegetatively propagated species, with an estimated genome size of 2200 Mb5–7 and a higher tolerance to drought and salt stresses than other fruit trees.8 As many woody plants, olive requires several growth seasons from seed germination to first flowering (juvenile phase). This long juvenile phase had severely hampered the generation of new breeding cultivars that could replace ancient ones still under cultivation.9 Therefore, new cultivars adapted to the new trends in olive growing, i.e. shorter juvenile periods,10 tree architecture suitable for hedgerow orchards and mechanical harvesting,11 or increased oil content and organoleptic profiles tailored to different markets,12 are needed.11Understanding the complex molecular basis of fruit and oil quality and that of traits of agronomical importance can be greatly helped by the application of genomic tools. Furthermore, development of new molecular markers to assist selection in breeding programmes looking for cultivars with more desirable phenotypes for any of these traits can be greatly helped through the generation and application of genomic tools. However, despite its economical relevance, the generation of sequence information and genomic tools for either olive or any closely related species has only just started.13–16 Genomic information in olive is well behind other species of woody plants, such as Vitis vinifera17,18 and Populus trichocarpa,19 whose complete genome sequences are already available, although the first sequences for these species became available around the same time, or even later, than those from olive.20 Without a genome sequence, transcriptome sequencing is an effective approach for gene discovery and identification of transcripts involved in specific biological processes (BP).In this study, we report the largest contribution to date to sequence information in this important crop species, with close to 2 M reads generated through the combined use of Sanger sequencing and 454 pyrosequencing technologies, for the identification of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from different plant tissues and developmental stages. The assembly of the 2 M reads has rendered over 81 020 unigenes, and we present here the result of this assembly and its functional annotation.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant material for the generation of cDNA libraries and collectionsFour cDNA libraries were generated for Sanger sequencing (Table 1). To generate a mesocarp cDNA library (OLmeso), fruit mesocarp was collected from fruits of Lechin de Sevilla, harvested at three relevant stages of maturation: green with lignified endocarp (18 WAF), turning (27 WAF), and purple (34 WAF). For the bud cDNA library (OLmer), buds containing actively growing meristems harvested from juvenile low branches and adult high branches of 10 segregating seedlings from a Picual × Arbequina cross of the UCO-IFAPA Olive Breeding Program of Córdoba, Spain, were taken by mid April 2008. Roots from a single adult tree of Lechin de Sevilla and 10 different 2-month-old trees from the segregating progeny of the Picual × Arbequina cross were also harvested to generate a root cDNA library (OLroot). Young leaves and stems of Lechin de Sevilla were collected and used together with seeds from olive fruits of the Picual × Arbequina progeny at two different maturation stages: green with lignified endocarp (18 WAF) and turning (27 WAF) to generate OLrest. The tissues used to generate the eight cDNA collections used for pyrosequencing are detailed in Table 1. Description of the olive cDNA libraries and collections generated in this workDescription of the olive cDNA libraries and collections generated in this work2.2. RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, and generation of cDNA librariesTotal RNA was purified from mesocarp samples following previously described methods21,22 that allow elimination of phenolic compounds and using the TURBO DNA-free kit (Ambion, USA) to remove genomic DNA. Oligotex (Qiagen) was used to obtain mRNA from total RNA to guarantee RNA integrity when mesocarp samples were to be used to generate cDNA libraries. Total RNA extraction from juvenile and adult roots, young leaves and stems, and from seeds of green and turning fruits were carried out using Spectrum Total RNA Kit (Sigma-Aldrich, Spain) after tissue processing with an electric homogenizer. Total RNA from buds was purified using a Trizol-based method (Life Technologies)23 and treated twice with DNase.24 In all cases, RNA concentration was quantified using a spectrophotometer at OD 260 nm, and integrity checked by electrophoresis in agarose gels.For the generation of the four cDNA libraries for Sanger sequencing, and prior to cDNA synthesis, equal amounts of RNA from mesocarp from the different stages of maturation (OLmeso), equal amounts of RNA from juvenile and adult roots (OLroot), or buds (OLmer), and equal amounts of young leaves and stems, seeds from green and turning fruits (OLrest) were pooled together. Synthesis of cDNA was carried out using the SMART kit (DB Clontech, USA),25 and normalized using the DSN nuclease (TRIMMER-Direct cDNA Normalization Kit from Evrogen, JSC, Russia).26,27 To confirm that the normalization process was correct, an aliquot was visualized by gel electrophoresis, and the presence of olive genes of known expression was confirmed for some of the tissues by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). cDNA insert preparation was treated with Proteinase K, cleaned, and digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes. cDNA was size fractionated by ChromaSpin-400 columns, ligated into the pDNR-LIB,28 (OLroot and OLrest libraries), pAL17.129 (OLmeso library), or pSTBlue-1 (Novagen, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) (OLmer library) vectors, previously dephosphorylated, and transformed into Escherichia coli. Libraries were titred and tested by randomly picking and amplifying a small number of clones using universal primers. The sizes of the PCR products ranged between 0.5 and 2 Kb.When generating cDNA collections for pyrosequencing, the first strand cDNA synthesis was performed using the ‘RevertAid H Minus First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit’ (Fermentas), and, the second strand cDNA was synthesized using E. coli DNA polymerase I and RNase H (Fermentas).2.3. Sanger and 454 sequencingcDNA libraries were automatically sequenced from the 5' end using either the T7 primer (OLmeso and OLmer) or the pDNRlib30-50 primer (OLroot and OLrest), and FASTA files were generated for bioinformatic processing. cDNA collections for pyrosequencing were sheared via nebulization into small fragments and sequenced using GS-FLX (MAP, MIP, MIA, and MAA) or GS-FLX Titanium (SGAP, MGP, MTA, and MTP) (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Half of a picotiter plate was used for cDNA collections: MAP, MIP, MIA, and MAA, with single libraries being sequenced in separated areas of the plate, whereas a full plate was used for SGAP, MGP, MTA, and MTP. An initial quality filtering was carried out before the actual base calling, where 454 adapter sequences were removed. Transmission, storage, and handling of sequencing data were subsequently done using the standard flowgram format (SFF) files for compactness and easiness of usage. SFF files were created after image analysis using the GSRunProcessor Version 2.3 provided by 454 Roche through Lifesequencing S.L., Spain. Calling qualities and sequence extraction from SFF files were carried out using sfftools Version 2.3 also provided by 454 Roche through Lifesequencing.2.4. EST processing protocolsMost of the EST processing protocols were adapted from those described by Vera and collaborators.30 Based on preliminary data using different computational assembly pipelines, including the 454 GS Assembler software, we chose to assemble the 454 sequence data using SeqMan Pro 8.1.1 (DNASTAR Lasergene v8.0 Suite, DNASTAR, USA). During pre-assembly, sequencing ends were trimmed using a medium-stringency criteria, with the following SeqMan parameters: average quality score Q/n threshold of 12, a non-trace window size of 50, and a maximum of 2 Ns. As part of the preprocessing step, an exhaustive comparison against a prokaryotic database (Uniprot database: taxonomic divisions Bacteria and Archaea) was performed to remove all those sequences that potentially originated from external contamination. For sequences obtained using 454 technology, no scanning for vector sequences was carried out. In the actual assembly step, the assembler used a strategy combining quality weighting (when there was not enough coverage depth) and simple majority (when deeper coverage was present) for contig consensus determination. For large 454 sequencing projects, the software provider recommended a set of pre-assembly and assembly parameters; however, because they were optimized for shorter reads than those obtained in our study, we performed several benchmark assemblies under different sets of parameters (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). When final length and coverage of the contigs were considered adequate, the parameters identified as optimal, which were different from those that were vendor recommended, were used to assemble the data obtained from 454 sequencing. We used a minimum consecutive match size of 25 bases, a minimum match percentage of 70%, and a match spacing of 15-mer tags. We established a minimum length of 70 bases for a sequence to be considered for assembly, no gap penalty and a 0.70 gap length penalty, and a maximum mismatch in end bases of 0. No repeat handling was used. Sanger sequencing data was also assembled using SeqMan Pro 8.1.1, using the default parameters recommended, that thus allowed us to perform joint 454-Sanger assemblies. High stringency quality trimming was used to remove low-quality bases at the ends of the sequences. The parameters for pre-assembly and assembly were similar to those used for 454 cDNA collections, but the match percentage was set to 80%, and a match spacing of 150 was required. A minimum of 100 bases was required for a sequence to be assembled (because of Sanger sequencing technology obtaining longer reads). The maximum mismatch in the end bases was also set to 15 to help mitigate assembly problems, if untrimmed vectors or bad base calls are present at the end of the reads. ESTs screening for vector sequences was carried out as follows in Sanger libraries: OLmeso was screened for pAL17.1, OLmer for pSTBlue-1, and OLrest and OLroot for pDNR-LIB. After the pre-assembly (cleaning and trimming) step, most of the raw reads were considerably reduced in size because of the tendency of the Sanger sequencing technology to incorporate traces of vector sequence and lower quality calls at 3' and 5' ends. The complete assembly of all sequences was carried out using a sequential combination of two different assemblers. Briefly, the initial sequencing dataset was assembled using Newbler 2.6 (Roche Ltd)31 and default parameters for cDNA data (seed step = 12; seed length = 16, seed count = 1, minimum overlap length = 40, and minimum overlap identity = 90%). The resulting dataset of contigs and singletons was used as input for the second assembler, CAP3,32 to collapse all related sequences that could not have done so during the first assembly step. The parameters used to perform the CAP3 assembly were a minimum overlap length of 60 bases and a minimum overlap identity of 90%. Unigenes generated from the assembly were further filtered for a minimum size of 200 nt. Unigenes generated were classified according to the tissues from which they included sequencing reads. The lists of unigenes detected in each of the tissues were compared using the software VENNY, to identify those unigenes expressed in a single or two or more tissues. This software displays the results of these comparisons as Venn diagrams (http://bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/).332.5. Analysis of transcript and transcriptome coverageA mathematical analysis similar to rarefaction analysis and previously applied for similar purposes in pea (Pisum sativum) was used to estimate both transcript and transcriptome coverage.34 A read pool was defined using all reads obtained after the cleaning and trimming process from which reads were randomly drawn to generate sets of reads (datasets) of increasing sizes. The number of tomato genes identified using BLASTX (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool 2.2.18)35 to compare these different datasets against the tomato ‘ITAG2 protein database (http://solgenomics.net)’ (e-value = 10-4) was recorded for each dataset and plotted against the corresponding sample sizes. Data points, thus, obtained were fitted to a non-linear regression with the model y = ax/(b + x) (SigmaPlot Software, Systat Software Inc., Scientific Software Products). Curves are expected to converge against a fixed value parameter ‘a’ in the model function indicating an upper limit for gene detection, which correlated with a decreasing slope at higher sample sizes indicative of a decreasing potential to detect additional tomato genes with further sampling. This approach was also used to record tomato genes with more than 5, 10, and 100 hits to estimate transcript coverage.2.6. Data availabilityThe 454 sequenced read data reported in this manuscript have been deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Sequence Read Archive and are available under the Accession Number (NCBI: SRA059461). The results from the assembly reported in this manuscript have been deposited in the NCBI Transcriptome Shotgun Assembly Archive and are available under the Accession Number (GABQ00000000).2.7. Functional annotationUnigenes generated were functionally annotated based on the similarity with UniProt-annotated sequences, in particular using plants taxonomy. The annotation algorithm used, Sma3s (Pérez-Pulido A.J., Muñoz-Mérida A., Viguera E., Claros M.G., Trelles O., Sma3s: a three-step modular sequence annotator. In preparation), was developed at the University of Malaga and briefly consists on a restrictive BLAST35 search with three steps of significance that sequentially retrieve annotations from: (i) already existing annotated sequences, (ii) orthologous sequences, and (iii) groups of sequences sharing a statistically significant pattern. Sma3s provides the following biological descriptors associated with each sequence: Gene ontology (GO) terms, Swiss-Prot keywords and pathways, InterPro domains, and IntAct interactions (Uniprot, UniProt Knowledgebase Release 2012_04). In the first step, minimal correspondence was established at a 90% of sequence identity with a sequence overlap of at least 90% of the query sequence length. In the second step, the threshold was established at 75% of per-residue identity and length overlapping of more than 75% of their length. Lastly, the third step uses all BLAST alignments related to each query sequence, which are classified as statistically significant by the Sander's formulae.36,37 The curve determined by the formulae binds the relationship between sequence similarity and alignment length observed, in sequences sharing structural similarity. Thus, those entries displaying identity length coordinates over the curve correspond to statistically significant hits. This analysis is necessary to distinguish true from false positives, when the level of sequence identity is not sufficiently high to unambiguously distinguish between protein pairs of similar and non-similar structures. The annotations resulting from these hits were reported by the algorithm.The annotation generated by sma3s was loaded as a tab-separated file in the Blast2GO suite,38 to retrieve the GO structure of our data. A directed acyclic graph (DAG)38 was made with a >2 unigenes per GO term as a cutoff to overcome the computing limitations encountered as a result of the large size of our dataset. Statistics of our annotation dataset were saved into a Microsoft Excel datasheet, and charts were generated. Statistical analysis of GO terms enrichment was carried out using the Blast2GO suite38 to perform a two-tailed Fisher's exact test,39 a non-parametric test for independence that calculates the false discovery rate (FDR) following the method described by Benjamini and Hochberg.40 The test was carried out using a term filter value of 0.05.3. Results and discussion3.1. Experimental designOur primary interest focuses in three major traits: (i) fruit and oil quality, (ii) juvenility, and (iii) plant architecture. Selection of the adequate tissues, developmental stages, and varieties, from which ESTs would be obtained, is therefore paramount. Thus, cultivars Picual and Arbequina were selected for having very different characteristics regarding fruit and oil organoleptic properties, as well as tree architecture, whereas cultivar Lechin de Sevilla was included in the study for showing intermediate phenotypes for all these traits41 (Table 1). In addition, they are among the varieties most widely cultivated worldwide.To get information about genes involved in determining oil content and composition, we selected mesocarp and seed tissues from fruits of different varieties at stages of maturation that correspond to the relevant phases of fruit development and ripening with respect to oil accumulation (Table 1). In particular, we selected mesocarp and seed tissues from green fruits with lignified endocarp as the earliest developmental stage because the lignification of the endocarp marks the start of the triacylglycerol synthesis and oil accumulation in both, the mesocarp, with a major contribution to the final composition of the olive oil and the seed. Unlike the seed, in the mesocarp, the increase in oil content continues during the ripening process that is characterized by a change in colour of the fruit, turning from green to purple and then black. Therefore, we also selected turning and purple mesocarp. In this way, we have generated five cDNA library/ collections for Sanger sequencing or pyrosequencing to obtain ESTs related to oil quality.Determining the length of the juvenile period and the plant architecture are processes strongly associated with meristematic activity. During the transition from juvenile to adult, a maturation gradient is developed in plants from the basal parts formed by juvenile apical meristems, to the upper parts formed by adult meristems.10,42–44 Thus, we generated a cDNA library using RNA extracted from actively growing buds and four cDNA collections using RNA extracted from buds containing active or inactive (dormant) buds (Table 1). In addition, in woody plants, a minimum distance from the roots to the apical meristems, measured as number of nodes rather than length, is required to get the juvenile-to-adult phase transition, suggesting that juvenility signals coming from the roots are involved in the process. Therefore, we also included in our study a cDNA library using RNA extracted from roots (Table 1).Finally, a fourth cDNA library was generated from a mix of other tissues, to extend the number of representative ESTs from olive and used for Sanger sequencing (Table 1). It is noteworthy that whereas the four cDNA libraries generated for Sanger sequencing were normalized to maximize transcriptome coverage, the cDNA collections for 454 pyrosequencing were non-normalized to gain information on gene expression levels.3.2. Sequencing resultsIn total, we obtained 1 932 337 reads (1 781 033 after trimming and cleaning), 47 518 (38 183 after trimming and cleaning) of which were generated through Sanger sequencing, with an average length of 847 bp, and 1 884 819 (1 742 850 after trimming and cleaning) generated through 454 pyrosequencing, with an average length of 269 bp (Supplementary Table S3). It is noteworthy that during the execution of the pyrosequencing project, the GS-FLX Titanium platform became available, which considerably improved the quality of the results. From an average length of 225 bp for the first 660 715 reads corresponding to the four cDNA collections generated from buds, we moved to an average length of 314 bp for the remaining 1 224 102 reads corresponding to the four cDNA collections generated from fruits. The average number of sequences left after the process, as well as their average length for each library and collection, is displayed in Supplementary Table S3. After the cleaning and trimming processes, the remaining 1 781 033 reads (92.1% of the total number of reads) were used for assembly.3.3. Sequencing data assemblyFigure 1 shows the workflow of the process used to generate ESTs from the assembly of individual libraries (OLroot, OLmer, OLrest, and OLmeso) (panel A) and collections (MIP, MIA, MAP, MAA, SGAP, MGP, MTA, and MTP) (panel B). The number of unigenes, defined as the number of contigs (consensus sequence obtained from assembled reads), and the number of singletons (unassembled reads), generated from the assembly process of the cleaned reads obtained for each library and collection, are detailed in Supplementary Table S3. Workflow followed for the individual assembly of different library/collections and for the assembly of different combinations of library/collections (e.g. assembly of libraries generated from the same tissue). Sections A and B show separate processes for both Sanger and 454 reads assembly. Different assemblies were performed using SeqMan Pro 8.1.1 except when assembling together all the reads generated, which was performed using a two-step assembly process (Newbler 2.6 followed by CAP3) to overcome problems when handling such large amount of data. QC Assembly stands for a quality control step carried out before the actual assembly, where all the reads matching any prokaryotic sequence were removed. QC Blast stands for a quality control step carried out for each assembly consisting of comparing the unigenes generated with themselves using BLAST to guarantee optimal assembly results.Workflow followed for the individual assembly of different library/collections and for the assembly of different combinations of library/collections (e.g. assembly of libraries generated from the same tissue).

QC Blast stands for a quality control step carried out for each assembly consisting of comparing the unigenes generated with themselves using BLAST to guarantee optimal assembly results.To assess the performance of the 454 assembly, a BLASTN search was carried out using as query the contigs resulting from assembling together the reads generated from the 4 collections sequenced by 454 prior to the GS-FLX Titanium upgrade (MIP, MIA, MAP, and MAA), selected for being those with the shortest average length versus a database with all the unigenes (contigs plus singletons) obtained from the assembly. If the assembly process was optimal, a singleton should not match with any of the contigs, nor a contig must match any other contig. Thus, the matches obtained between the query sequences (contigs) and the total unigenes (contigs + singletons), apart from the hit of each contig with itself, should be as few and as short as possible, demonstrating the uniqueness of each of the contigs and singletons generated through the assembly. Our analysis revealed that only 9% of the contigs (n = 4272) had BLAST hits with 100% identity with other contigs (n = 47.5) or singletons (n = 63.7), but in no case these alignments extended over the entire length of either the BLAST subject or the query, suggesting that they originate from partial similarities, rather than from ineffective assembly. Regions that obtained a perfect match against a different contig or a singleton had an average length of 125 and 114 nt, respectively, that represent 24.3% of the length of the query sequence, in average for matches to contig and 19.7% for matches to singletons. The simplest explanation for these results is that these small matching regions, with 100% identity alignments, are either small sequence motifs highly conserved in different genes or the result of alternative splicing. In either case, the results of our test indicate that the assembly pipeline was capable of distinguishing these short matches from proper matches, assigning the sequences to separate contigs.Assembling together the data generated from all the libraries and collections required the use of a more complex strategy, to overcome the limitations in the computer's memory, when handling such a large amount of sequencing data and the potential difficulties associated with sequence variability when assembling different plant varieties in a highly heterozygous species. With the clear aim of reducing the number of sequencing reads from the same gene assembled into different contigs, our chosen strategy was the sequential use of two different assemblers. The assemblers selected are based on two different mathematical models for assembly: ‘Greedy’ and ‘Overlap-Layout-Consensus’ (OLC). The Greedy assembler chosen was Newbler as it is the software provided by the company that performed the 454 sequencing (LifeScience/Roche). The OLC method of our choice was CAP3 that was carried out after the first assembly step, taking as input the output of the Newbler assembly. Thus, we obtained 162 118 unigenes from which 52 781 were contigs and 109 337 singletons. A subsequent filter was performed setting a minimal length of 200 nt. The resulting dataset was, thus, composed of 81 020 unigenes from which 47 520 were contigs (Supplementary Table S3).3.4. Analysis of the assembled datasetThe distribution by length of the unigenes generated in the assembly is shown in Fig. 2. Interestingly, only a single peak could be observed for either contigs, or unigenes, indicating that the sequences generated from the two types of technologies have been integrated during the assembly process. The GC content of the olive transcriptome assembled in this study ranged from 15.4 to 76.2% in the different unigenes, with an average of 40.4%, very similar to that of 42.5% reported previously.13Distribution of lengths of contigs and unigenes from the fully assembled dataset. Unigenes are represented in green and contigs in red.Distribution of lengths of contigs and unigenes from the fully assembled dataset. Unigenes are represented in green and contigs in red.Analysis of EST abundance in a contig can provide insight into the gene expression levels, although in our case, this information must be taken with caution because the Sanger-sequenced libraries were normalized. Figure 3 shows the distribution of contigs coverage for those originated from the assembly of all the sequences obtained. A wide distribution of coverage among the contigs can be observed in the figure, with the number of ESTs assembled into a given contig ranging between 2 and more than 1000. The largest group was that of the contigs formed by 2–4 reads (47.6% of all contigs) dropping to 19.1% of those containing 5–10 reads, probably owing to the limitations of the assembly process and length of the 454 reads, as well as the presence of normalized libraries among those generated. However, 33.2% of the total contigs were formed by 10–10 000 reads. For these contigs, the number of reads is likely to be a good indication of their level of expression, and this correlation is expected to be stronger as the number of reads forming the contigs increases. Distribution of the number of reads per contig for the contigs from the assembled dataset.Distribution of the number of reads per contig for the contigs from the assembled dataset.Probably, one of the best assessments of the quality of the assembled database is provided by the number of different transcripts of the transcriptome being tagged by at least one read; in other words, the transcriptome coverage. To estimate the transcriptome coverage, the number of olive transcripts likely to be included in our assembled dataset, we used as a reference the tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) ITAG2 protein database (http://solgenomics.net), a sequenced45 and relatively closely related species (Supplementary Fig. S1).46,47 We found that 81.2% of the tomato genes were hit by at least one read from our olive dataset. We mathematically estimated transcriptome coverage, following a strategy similar to rarefaction analysis previously used for the same purpose in pea (P. sativum).34 Random groups of reads of increasing sizes were tested for identification of tomato genes and fitted to a hyperbolic curve (Fig. 4). Because the slope at the final three points of the curve, corresponding to 60, 80, and 100% of the total reads, was very low (5 × 10-4, 3 × 10-4, and 2 × 10-4, respectively), a further increase in the size of the sample (number of reads obtained) would not result in a significant increase in gene identification. Taking into account the taxonomical distance between the two species, the different representation of tissues in our dataset, and the absence of flowers in this analysis, we are likely close in saturate the olive transcriptomes for mesocarp, meristem, and seed tissues. Thus, even though the final assembly did not collapse and we still have a number of unigenes larger than expected, we are likely to have at least one read from the majority of the transcripts generated in these tissues. Rarefaction analysis of gene representation in the assembled dataset. Different numbers of randomly sampled reads were blasted against the SOLLC protein database, and the number of proteins identified at least 1time, 5, 10 and a 100 times was recorded. The resulting data were modelled with non-linear regression y = (ax)/(b–x).Rarefaction analysis of gene representation in the assembled dataset. Different numbers of randomly sampled reads were blasted against the SOLLC protein database, and the number of proteins identified at least 1time, 5, 10 and a 100 times was recorded. The resulting data were modelled with non-linear regression y = (ax)/(b–x).An additional parameter frequently used to assess the goodness of an assembly is the transcript coverage or percentage of the total number of bases of the transcriptome that has been covered. To estimate transcript coverage, we also followed the same strategy previously applied to pea,34 which based on the notion of most transcripts requiring more than one read to cover its full length, analysed the number of genes tagged by multiple reads. Reads were again tested in random groups of increasing size, and the number of genes tagged by at least 5, 10, or 100 reads was established (Fig. 4). The lowering slopes of the curves obtained for all three cases (e.g. 6 × 10-3, 4 × 10-3, and 3 × 10-3 for genes tagged by more than 100 hits) suggest that although transcript coverage is not complete, it may also be close to saturation.We also evaluated the level of redundancy between libraries by analysing the distribution of reads in contigs across the libraries (Fig. 5). We found that 23.1% of the contigs contained reads generated from a single library, 26.9% contained contigs generated from 2, 49.0% of them contained reads that originated from 3 to 9 libraries, whereas only 0.9% contained reads originated from more than 9 to 12 libraries. As expected, even though a large percentage of contigs is formed by a reduced number of reads (Fig. 2), a large percentage of contigs contain reads from many libraries. The drop in the percentage of contigs containing reads originated from 9 to 12 libraries is likely to reflect the difference in size among some of the libraries. We further characterized the contribution of the different libraries to the final assembly by comparing the number of reads from each library that corresponds to singletons, or either belongs to contigs formed by reads shared by different libraries, or to contigs formed by reads from a single library (Fig. 6A). Two libraries, MAP and SGAP, stand out for their seemingly larger specific composition because reads classified into singletons or assembled into library-specific contigs appear overrepresented when compared with other libraries. However, these results could potentially be biased by the differences in the total number of reads existing between libraries. Thus, we also represented the data normalized against the number of reads per library (Fig. 6B). After normalization, the library generated from inactive buds from Arbequina, MIA, displayed an abnormally high level of specificity with the majority of its reads belonging to library-specific contigs. A more detailed look at the composition of this library revealed an overrepresentation of a few contigs (14) formed by an unusually high number of reads per contig (over 1000 to more than 12 000). We believe this to be a technical issue associated with the generation or sequencing of this particular library and, thus, without biological relevance. Therefore, the potential library specificity of MIA contigs should not be considered without additional evaluation. Distribution of number of libraries providing reads per contig.

The number (A), or percentage (B), of contigs shared by more than one library is represented in green, contigs formed by reads from a single library are shown in blue, and singletons in red.Because a large percentage of the contigs are formed by a reduced number of reads, potentially library-specific genes have to be considered with caution. However, when the number of reads per contig is considered in relation to the tissue specificity of each library, many of the contigs obtained show potential specificity. In regards to this, because some of the libraries were constructed using the same type of tissue, we also evaluated the level of redundancy between tissues. The assembled dataset was examined to identify unigenes formed by reads obtained from sequencing libraries generated from the same tissue. We identified a total of 26 430 unigenes that contained reads only sequenced in libraries generated from meristems, 11 352 unigenes formed by reads obtained from fruit mesocarp, 11 182 unigenes containing reads obtained from seeds, and 757 unigenes containing reads obtained from roots (Fig. 7). The reduced number of reads generated from roots, as compared to the other tissues, is likely to limit the identification of potentially specific ESTs. Because OLrest contains reads from seeds, and from stems and leaves, the results obtained from this library were not considered when establishing potential tissue specificity. Potentially tissue-specific ESTs could be of great interest, particularly considering the large number of reads generated from some of the tissues and the results from the rarefaction analysis indicating that we are close in saturating the corresponding transcriptomes (Supplementary Table S3 and Fig. 4).

Functional annotationThe assembled dataset still includes a considerable number of unassembled reads, a problem common to 454 pyrosequencing projects that may be aggravated by a relative abundance of short repeats within the species,13 the occurrence of alternative splicing, or heterozygosity.48 Theoretically, sequencing a single cultivar could reduce the limitations that heterozygosity may determine in the efficiency of the assembly. Nonetheless, we obtained similar efficiencies, when using our assembly pipeline in libraries generated from a single versus a mix of varieties (Supplementary Table S3 and data not shown). Despite these potential limitations, the functional annotation of our assembled dataset retrieved annotations from various databases for over 61.4% of the contigs (29 194 out of the total 47 520) and 27.8% of the singletons (9311 out of the total 33 500). Similar or much lower percentages of gene annotation have been reporte previously for olive ESTs sequencing projects.13,15 In addition, when we used BLAST to further evaluate the full set of unigenes against the plant sequences deposited in Uniprot, we found that 68.6% of the contigs (32 592 out of the total 47 520) and 35.4% of the singletons (11 863 out of the total 33 500) had a hit with a P-value greater than 10-6. Although the algorithm used in BLAST comparisons is based on local alignment, the relevance of this results is supported by the fact that more than 50% of the hits obtained for the contigs (16 489 of the 32 592) and over 83% of the hits obtained for the singletons (7770 out of the total 9311) extended over more than 75% of their lengths. In total, 47.5% of the unigenes have a significant hit with plant databases, having found for 63% (27 879) of these, a potential homologue. These results further support the notion of our assembly dataset being a fair representation of the olive transcriptome.The distribution of hits obtained against entries for other plants within the NCBI database was used to get a descriptive view of the newly generated dataset. The highest number of hits was obtained against V. vinifera (VITVI), Ricinus communis (RICCO), and P. tricocharpa (POPTR) (Fig. 8A). However, O. europaea (OLEEU) is only the ninth species displaying the highest numbers of hits, just two positions ahead of Arabidopsis thaliana (ARATH), probably owing to the smaller number of olive sequences present in the NCBI database when compared with the other three species. In keeping with this, species phylogenetically closer to olive such as tomato (S. lycopersicum SOLLC) or potato (Solanum tuberosum SOLTU) did display lower number of hits. We include a phylogenetic tree enclosing the species relevant for our study as supplementary material (Supplementary Fig. S1).

We established 500 Uniprot entries per species to eliminate distortions frequently observed with very underrepresented species (data not shown). After this process, although many of the species present in the untreated graph (Fig. 8A) were still present, the relative order in which they appeared was considerably altered, with the highest number of hits being obtained against olive (OLEEU) (Fig. 8B). In the normalized graph, the six closest species to our dataset, including olive (OLEEU), correspond to members of the asterids clade (Fig. 8B and Supplementary Fig. S1). In addition, VITVI (V. vinifera) dropped from the first position in the non-normalized graph to eighth and Arabidopsis (ARATH) dropped from 11th to position 23rd, being these new positions more in agreement with the taxonomic relationships between the species (Fig. 8B; Supplementary Fig. S1).The distribution of hits against different plant species is frequently used without taking into account the large differences between the total numbers of entries for each species included in the NCBI database. We show here that the results obtained without normalization are clearly influenced by the number of entries and far away from the results expected according to the taxonomical relationships between the species.Because one of our main aims was to generate ESTs with information about the metabolism involved in oil production, we also retrieved enzyme IDs from the functional annotation obtained for our dataset. We found the following distribution into each of the six major enzyme classes (http://enzyme.expasy.org/cgi-bin/enzyme/): transferases 27% (in 87 unigenes), hydrolases 24% (in 76 unigenes), oxidoreductases 30% (in 95 unigenes), ligases 5% (in 15 unigenes), lyases 7% (in 23 unigenes), and isomerases 7% (in 24 unigenes) (Supplementary Fig. S2).3.6. GO annotationBlast2GO suite38 is often used for analysing functional annotation for purposes of biologically profiling a newly generated sequence dataset beyond the single-gene level. However, because the suite has limitations when handling large datasets, we could only use Blast2GO to retrieve the GO terms previously assigned to our unigene dataset by Sma3s. To facilitate data processing, we established a cutoff for GO terms that were present in only one sequence within the DAG38 generated (data not shown). A total of 87 309 GO terms were obtained from a total of 27 494 unigenes for which at least 3 GO were obtained. The distribution of assignments into the GO categories was 14 930 unigenes with at least 3 GO terms from BP, 24 568 unigenes with at least 3 GO terms from molecular function (MF), and 11 481 unigenes with at least 3 GO terms from cellular components (CC). The most abundant high-level GO counts within these categories were BP, the very general categories of metabolic processes associated with 10 471 unigenes, and cellular processes, associated with 11 872 unigenes, and more specific, biological regulation, localization, and response to stimulus with 2832, 2168, and 2246 unigenes, respectively; MF, binding, associated with 16 902 unigenes, and catalytic activity associated with 14 657 unigenes; and CC, the very general cell, associated with 11 182 and more specific organelle, with 5220, membrane with 4789, and macromolecular complex with 2557 (Fig. 9).

We analysed the functional enrichment of GO terms in meristem-specific genes using Fisher's exact test.39 GO terms associated with cellular division and DNA replication, as well as response to stimuli and hormones, were remarkable overrepresented among meristem-specific genes in comparison with the rest of the transcriptome (Table 2). Because meristems are actively growing sites, key for plant development and shoot branching, both processes strongly influenced by environmental and endogenous signals, such as hormones, the overrepresented GO terms in this tissue are full in keeping with these activities. Interestingly, a clear underrepresentation of terms associated with ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation and regulation could also be seen at several GO levels (Table 2), suggesting that such regulatory mechanism does not have a major role in the regulation of meristem-specific processes. Significantly enriched terms (FDR < 0.05) for potentially meristem-specific unigenesSignificantly enriched terms (FDR < 0.05) for potentially meristem-specific unigenesUnfortunately, no such a clear specific profile could be identified for the other tissues. Few relevant differences could be established with confidence in unigenes potentially specific for roots, probably owing to their significantly smaller number, likely determined by the considerably smaller number of reads obtained from this tissue. However, this underrepresentation of root genes probably allowed us to obtain the clear functional enrichment found in meristems because the likely overlap expected between the functional annotation of both tissues (e.g. abundance of GO terms associated with cell division and DNA replication) could have potentially hindered the statistical validation of such specific enrichment in meristem-specific genes. Interestingly, among the very few overrepresented GO terms associated with root-specific genes were acropetal auxin transport (GO:0010541; FDR 3 × 10-2) and basipetal auxin transport (GO:0010540; FDR 3 × 10-2).A functional overlap can also be expected between mesocarp and seeds regarding GO terms (i.e. abundance of GO terms associated with oil production), and it is probably the reason why our comparative analysis has not rendered clearer functional profiles for these two tissues. However, a number of unigenes from our assembled dataset have the annotation of GO terms associated with oil production. Quantitative analysis on the relative level of expression of unigenes associated with oil production-related GO terms would probably give insight into the gene expression profile in relation to the biological activities within these tissues.The functional profiles obtained through GO annotation from the unigenes expressed in meristems are in good agreement with the biological characteristics and activities expected for this tissue, indicating that the transcriptome hereby assembled is a valuable representation of the full transcriptome for this tissue. Thus, the dataset can be highly useful for the identification of interesting candidate genes in traits associated with meristematic activity such as regulation of the juvenility period or tree architecture. Additional work will be necessary to test the potential for the identification of candidate genes involved in oil composition and quality. However, the presence of almost 300 unigenes annotated with the GO level 4 term lipid metabolic process, or lipid biosynthesis (Table 3), does support such potential. This report represents a major contribution to the molecular knowledge of the species, opening the possibility of developing molecular tools to the level currently available for other model plant species, such as Populus or apple tree.
