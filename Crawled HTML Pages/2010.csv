Here, we show that one of these conserved ORFs is actually the gene for ribosomal protein L10 (rpl10) in plant. No rpl10 gene has heretofore been reported in any mitochondrial genome other than the exceptionally gene-rich genome of the protist Reclinomonas americana. Conserved ORFs corresponding to rpl10 are present in a wide diversity of land plant and green algal mitochondrial genomes. The mitochondrial rpl10 genes are transcribed in all nine land plants examined, with five seed plant genes subject to RNA editing. In addition, mitochondrial-rpl10-like cDNAs were identified in EST libraries from numerous land plants. In three lineages of angiosperms, rpl10 is either lost from the mitochondrial genome or a pseudogene. In two of them (Brassicaceae and monocots), no nuclear copy of mitochondrial rpl10 is identifiably present, and instead a second copy of nuclear-encoded chloroplast rpl10 is present. Transient assays using green fluorescent protein indicate that this duplicate gene is dual targeted to mitochondria and chloroplasts. We infer that mitochondrial rpl10 has been functionally replaced by duplicated chloroplast counterparts in Brassicaceae and monocots.1. IntroductionPlant mitochondrial genomes have several major differences compared with those of vertebrates and other animals: large sizes, the presence of plasmid-like DNA, ongoing and sometimes frequent functional gene transfer to the nucleus, horizontal transfer between more or less distantly related plants, and unusual modes of gene expression such as RNA editing and trans-splicing.1 The relatively large mitochondrial genomes of land plants encode several genes that are not found in the mitochondrial genomes of most other organisms.2 In addition, plant mitochondrial genomes often contain open reading frames (ORFs) of unknown function. Some of these ‘unidentified ORFs’ have been subsequently been identified as functional genes, e.g. atp4, atp8, sdh3, and sdh4.3–5 In addition to these cases, ORFs conserved across plant species have been reported in a number of cases, some of which are transcribed and might be functional.6,7 However, most such conserved ORFs still remain to be assigned to any known genes.Here, we report a new case of gene identification: the conservation and expression of a gene that encodes ribosomal protein L10 (rpl10) in plant mitochondria. In bacteria, the rpl10 gene is present within a cluster encoding RPL11, RPL1, RPL10, and RPL7/RPL12.8 Cyanobacterial genomes also have an rpl10 gene but no equivalent gene has been found in chloroplast genomes.9 To date, across all of many sequenced mitochondrial genomes of diverse eukaryotes, an rpl10 gene has been identified only in the exceptionally and primitively gene-rich mitochondrial genome of the protist Reclinomonas americana.10,11 The counterpart to this gene is present in the nuclear genome in yeast and mammals.12,13 In contrast, no mitochondrial-type rpl10 gene has yet been reported in either the mitochondrial or nuclear genome of any plant species.In this study, we present several lines of evidence that together strongly indicate that one of the conserved ORFs present in the mitochondrial genome of diverse plant species corresponds to a functional rpl10 gene. Results from this study also indicate that mitochondrial rpl10 gene has been lost in monocots and some Brassicaceae lineages, and replaced by an extra copy of the nuclear gene that normally encodes chloroplast RPL10 protein.2. Materials and methods2.1. Sequence analysis and database searchSequences homologous to orf168 of Marchantia polymorpha mitochondria DNA14 were searched by Blast algorithm via the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) website (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). Genes for chloroplast rpl10 were searched in the NCBI database using sequences of Arabidopsis (locus tag: At5g13510) and Oryza (Os03g0284400) as queries. Nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences were aligned manually with BioEdit ver. 7.0.5.3.15 A sequence alignment of chloroplast RPL10 (Supplementary Fig. S2) was used for construction of a neighbour-joining (NJ) phylogenetic tree after removing gaps and poorly conserved regions. The NJ tree was constructed using ClustalW ver. 1.83 via a DNA Data Bank of Japan website (http://clustalw.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/top-e.html). Bootstrap values were computed from 1000 replicates.2.2. Plant materials and nucleic acid extractionLeaves of Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa, line ANF3-1), cycad (Cycas revoluta), grape (Vitis labrusca cv. Delaware), papaya (Carica papaya), rice (Oryza sativa subsp. japonica cv. Nipponbare), tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum cv. SR1), and tomato [Solanum lycopersicum cv. Saturn (Takii & Seed Co., Kyoto, Japan)] and thalli of liverwort (M. polymorpha) and hornwort (Megaceros flagellaris) were used for plant materials. Total DNA and total RNA were extracted with DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) and RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen), respectively.2.3. Reverse transcription–PCR analysisTotal RNA (0.5 µg) was treated with RNase-free DNase I (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland). First-strand cDNAs were synthesized using random hexamer primers and the Advantage RT-for-PCR Kit (Takara Bio, Otsu, Japan) as described previously.16 The resulting cDNAs were used for PCR amplifications with a primer pair P1–P2 in Carica, Nicotiana, and Vitis. Primer pairs P1–P3, P1–P4, and P1–P5 were used in Oryza, Brassica, and Cycas, respectively. The PCR products were cloned into a pCR-XL-TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and 12–14 independent cDNA clones were sequenced for each species to detect any potential RNA editing events.2.4. Construction and visualization of green fluorescent protein fusion proteinsSequences encoding the first 71 and 45 residues of chloroplast-like RPL10 in Arabidopsis (At3g12370) and Oryza (Os05g0121500) were amplified by PCR with primer pairs P6–P7 and P8–P9, respectively, and fused in-frame with the 5'-upstream region of a synthetic green fluorescent protein (GFP)17 (kindly provided by Dr Y. Niwa). The resultant constructs were introduced into Arabidopsis epidermal cells using a PDS-1000 particle delivery system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Mitochondria were labelled with an mt-DsRed construct, in which the GFP ORF in a pWS plasmid (carrying a presequence of Arabidopsis F1-ATPase d, kindly provided by Prof. W. Sakamoto) was replaced by DsRed (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA). Transient expression of the introduced proteins and chloroplast autofluorescence were visualized with a confocal spectral laser scanning microscope Nikon C1Si (Nikon Corporation, Chiyoda-ku, Japan), as reported previously.182.5. Oligonucleotide primersPrimers used in this study are as follows. Small letters represent nucleotide deviations to introduce NcoI and SalI restriction sites (underlines).

Results and discussion3.1. A sequence homologous to orf168 in Marchantia mitochondrial DNA is conserved across diverse plant speciesAn unidentified orf168 was reported in the Marchantia mitochondrial genome.14 An homologous sequences has since been reported in the mitochondrial genomes of two other bryophytes (Megaceros and Physcomitrella) and two angiosperms (Nicotiana and Vitis), termed ORF-bryo1, orf187, orf159b, and orf159, respectively.7,19–21 These conserved ‘orf168-related sequences’ are currently annotated as unknown ORFs, with no evident correspondence to any characterized proteins. We searched for homologues of the Marchantia orf168 by a Blast search and found 10 additional homologous sequences in the mitochondrial DNAs of diverse plant groups. Altogether, sequences homologous to the orf168 have now been found in 15 plant species: two green algae (Chaetosphaeridium and Chara),22,23 three bryophytes (Marchantia, Megaceros, and Physcomitrella),7,14,20 one gymnosperm (Cycas),24 and nine angiosperms (Bambusa, Brassica, Carica, Helianthus, Nicotiana, Oryza, Solanum, Tripsacum, and Vitis)19,21,25–27 [Allen et al., unpublished (accession no.

The complete ORF has been determined in this study (accession no. AB518477).The locations of the orf168-homologues in mitochondrial genomes relative to flanking genes are conserved among green algae and bryophytes to a substantial (but variable) degree (Fig. 1), whereas there is no linkage conservation of the orf168-homologue to these genes in seed plants (data not shown). This suggests that an ancestral, green-plant gene cluster including the orf168-homologue was destroyed, and each gene within the cluster was dispersed throughout the genome during the evolution of seed plants, as reported by Li et al.7 and as found for many other mitochondrial genes in angiosperm.Mitochondrial genome organization in the vicinity of ORFs that are homologous to orf168 of Marchantia polymorpha mitochondrial DNA.

Although it has not directly shown that these sequences represent transcripts from mitochondrial genes, their high degree of sequence conservation (84–99%; Supplementary Fig. S1) suggests, in light of the generally much lower rate of nucleotide substitutions in plant mitochondrial than nuclear genomes,28,29 that they probably are mitochondrial gene products.3.2. The orf168-homologues conserved in plant mitochondria are homologous to ribosomal protein L10An alignment of protein sequences predicted from the orf168-homologues is shown in Fig. 2. These sequences are relatively well conserved despite a few insertions/deletions in their central region. The C-terminal region is more divergent with respect to both sequence and length variation. The sequences in Bambusa, Brassica, and Oryza (and possibly Raphanus) are probably pseudogenes, as they have frame-shift mutations or are severely truncated (Fig. 2, slashes and lower case letters, and also see Supplementary Fig. S1 for Raphanus). Chaetosphaeridium and Tripsacum were omitted from the sequence alignment of Fig. 2 and from further analysis because the homologous sequence in Chaetosphaeridium was greatly diverged and because Tripsacum retains only a short stretch of rpl10 (Table 1).Alignment of amino acid sequences between previously characterized RPL10 proteins and the ORFs conserved in plant mitochondria.

We believe that this level of similarity is significant, i.e. is indicative of evolutionary homology/common descent, for the following reasons. First, the database search also detected a conserved domain of the ribosomal L10-P0 superfamily (ID: cd00379 at Conserved Domain Database, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/cdd.shtml) within the Physcomitrella sequence. Second, manual sequence alignment between the already-characterized RPL10 (Fig. 2, upper five sequences) and the proteins predicted from the orf168 homologues (Fig. 2, lower) confirmed that several amino acid residues were clearly conserved between the two sequence groups (Fig. 2, asterisks). Third, the average length of the ORF168 homologues in plant mitochondria is (except for pseudogene sequences) 165 amino acids, which is quite similar to the length of bacterial RPL10. Fourth, the level of amino acid identity/similarity between the plant ORFs and bacterial RPL10 proteins is similar to that observed between Reclinomonas and bacterial RPL10 proteins (24% identity, 47% similarity). Finally, this level of conservation is similar to that observed for many mitochondrial ribosomal proteins and their bacterial counterparts (e.g. RPS4 and RPS8;30 also see Table in Hao and Palmer31). Given all this, we conclude that orf168 and its homologues in plant mitochondrial genomes are likely to function as the mitochondrial rpl10 gene in plants. Therefore, these ORFs will be designated as ‘mitochondrial rpl10 genes’ hereafter.3.3. Plant mitochondrial rpl10 genes are transcribed and RNA editedThe expression of plant mitochondrial rpl10 was examined by reverse transcription (RT)–PCR. Transcripts from rpl10 were detected in all nine species investigated: two bryophytes (Marchantia and Megaceros), one gymnosperm (Cycas), and six angiosperms (Brassica, Carica, Nicotiana, Oryza, Solanum, and Vitis) (data not shown). Sequencing of five of the seed plant cDNAs revealed 3, 9, 5, 5, and 10 sites of C-to-T RNA editing in Cycas, Carica, Nicotiana, Solanum, and Vitis, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S1, Supplementary Table S1). These RNA editing events result in three, seven, four, three, and seven amino acid changes in the predicted proteins, respectively (Fig. 2, red letters), five positions of which clearly improve the similarity in the alignment (Fig. 2, filled triangles). RNA editing events are observed preferentially in protein-coding regions of land plant mitochondria at first and second positions in codons and tend to improve the level of protein sequence conservation.32,33 Seed plant rpl10 shows the same pattern of RNA editing, and therefore these results strongly indicate that the rpl10 gene is probably functional in the mitochondrion of these plants. In contrast, no RNA editing was detectable in the transcripts of Brassica and Oryza, which is consistent with the conclusion drawn in the preceding section that these are probably pseudogenes.3.4. Loss of functional mitochondrial rpl10 gene and occurrence of an extra chloroplast-type rpl10 gene in angiospermsAs described above, mitochondrial rpl10 gene appears to be a pseudogene in Bambusa, Brassica, and Oryza, whereas no vestige of rpl10 was found in the complete mitochondrial genome sequences of five angiosperms (Arabidopsis, Beta, Sorghum, Triticum, and Zea) and 12 green algae (Chlamydomonas, Chlorogonium, Chlorokybus, Mesostigma, Nephroselmis, Oltmannsiellopsis, Ostreococcus, Pedinomonas, Prototheca, Pseudendoclonium, Scenedesmus, and Volvox) (see Supplementary data for references). Moreover, for three of these plants (Arabidopsis, Oryza, and Sorghum; the latter genome represented by a draft genome sequence), there is no evidence of a mitochondrial-type rpl10 gene in both the nuclear genome and in extensive cDNA datasets. Therefore, it is likely that rpl10 genes of mitochondrial origin have been completely lost in these species. This is somewhat surprising, as the preponderance of genes that have been lost from mitochondrial genomes in angiosperms have been functionally transferred to the nucleus.34We hypothesized that the RPL10 protein might be supplied by a homologous nuclear gene of chloroplast origin, as found for cases of organellar loss of the rps13 gene.35,36 It has been shown that the rpl10 gene of chloroplast origin has been transferred to the nuclear genome in Arabidopsis and Oryza.37 Our database search showed that sequences homologous to this chloroplast-type rpl10 are present in many other land plants (Supplementary Fig. S2). All of these genes are probably located in the nucleus because the rpl10 gene is absent from all chloroplast genomes sequenced to date in land plants. Interestingly, monocots and Brassicaceae species harbour a second copy of the chloroplast-type rpl10 (Supplementary Fig. S2, lower), in addition to the putatively original copy that is widely present and conserved among land plants (Supplementary Fig. S2, upper). A phylogenetic analysis showed that the ‘extra’ copies of the chloroplast-type rpl10 gene in monocots and Brassicaceae form two independent clusters, each separated from all other examined genes by long branches (Fig. 3, shaded). This result suggests that the extra copy has diverged rapidly compared with the original chloroplast-type gene. Judging from their position in the rpl10 phylogeny, the two extra clades of genes may have originated by independent gene duplication events in monocots and Brassicaceae.Independent origins of the mitochondrial rpl10 genes in monocots and Brassicaceae from their respective chloroplast counterparts. An NJ phylogenetic tree is based on chloroplast-type RPL10 protein sequences. Accession numbers of cDNAs and locus tags of genome sequences are shown in brackets following each genus name. When the corresponding sequences are unannotated in the draft genome sequences, their locations are specified by the linkage group, chromosome number, or contig name together with their nucleotide coordinates. The Marchantia sequence was used as an outgroup. The ‘second’ copy of chloroplast RPL10 in monocots and Brassicaceae is shaded. Note that sequences homologous to the second copy of chloroplast RPL10 (At3g12370 and Os05g0121500 in Arabidopsis and Oryza, respectively) were also found in Hordeum, Musa, Panicum, Raphanus, and Triticum, but they are not included in the NJ tree because of incompleteness of their coding regions. Numbers on the nodes are bootstrap values (>80%) from 1000 replicates.

The chloroplast-derived rpl10 in Arabidopsis and Oryza undergoes dual-targeting into chloroplasts and mitochondriaThe alignment of the chloroplast-type RPL10 revealed that the N-terminal sequence of the second copy is totally different from that of the original copy (Supplementary Fig. S2) and is also non-homologous even between the monocots and Brassicaceae groups. Because the N-terminal region generally serves as a protein targeting signal, the distinct N-terminal sequences of the second set of RPL10 proteins may imply a difference of their targeting property. Proteome analyses in Arabidopsis and Spinacia have shown that the original, widely present chloroplast-type RPL10 is indeed targeted to chloroplasts, whereas cleavage of the N-terminal transit peptide region has been observed in Spinacia.38,39 In contrast, no such information has been obtained for the second copy of this gene. The second copy may have a short or no cleavable targeting sequence at its N-terminal region, considering the position of the cleavage site of the original copy (Supplementary Fig. S2, bent arrow). Protein localization predictions with Predotar, TargetP, and WoLF Psort40–42 provided contradictory results with respect to this second copy (data not shown). Therefore, we examined its subcellular localization in vivo using GFP. A fusion protein containing GFP and the N-terminal region of the second chloroplast-type RPL10 copy from Arabidopsis was clearly localized to mitochondria (Fig. 4B–D, and yellow arrowhead), suggesting its mitochondrial localization in vivo. In addition, however, GFP signals were also detected in chloroplasts (Fig. 4A, B, D, and pink arrowhead). Similar results were obtained using the Oryza sequence (Fig. 4F–H and E, F, and H, respectively). Therefore, the second chloroplast-derived RPL10 proteins in Arabidopsis and Oryza seem to undergo dual-targeting into both organelles. Dual-targeting has been found for a number of plant organellar proteins,43 including one other ribosomal protein (S16).44Subcellular localization in Arabidopsis leaf epidermal cells of GFP fusion proteins having the N-terminal portion of the second chloroplast-like RPL10 copy from Arabidopsis (A–D) and rice (E–H).

Evolution of mitochondrial rpl10 in plantsOn the basis of the data obtained in this study, we propose a model (Fig. 5) for the evolution of the mitochondrial rpl10 gene. This gene was originally present only in the mitochondrial genome (Fig. 5A). It was lost from the mitochondrial genome early in the evolution of most eukaryotic lineages (e.g. animals, fungi, and most protists), but has been retained in mitochondria of the protist Reclinomonas and certain plants. Indeed, many diverse plants (both land plants and charophytic green algae) still possess an intact and probably functional rpl10 gene in their mitochondrial genomes. In contrast, the chloroplast rpl10 gene was transferred to the nucleus early in eukaryotic evolution, as no green plant chloroplast genomes still contain this gene (GOBASE: The Organelle Genome Database, http://gobase.bcm.umontreal.ca/index.php).A model for the evolution of rpl10 genes of mitochondrial and chloroplast origin. Three predicted evolutionary stages with regard to the mitochondrial rpl10 gene (A–C) are shown. The proposed evolutionary direction is indicated with thick arrows. Nucleus, mitochondrion, and chloroplast are represented by an octagon, a rounded rectangle, and an oval, respectively. An intact gene, a pseudogene, and loss of the gene are denoted with a plus (+), <U+03C8>, and a minus (-), respectively. The second copy of the nuclear gene encoding chloroplast RPL10 is shown by a circled plus sign. Targeting of proteins produced by the nuclear-encoded genes is indicated with arrows. Genera possibly or ambiguously belong to each of the three stages are shown in parentheses or by a double-headed arrow.A model for the evolution of rpl10 genes of mitochondrial and chloroplast origin.

Genera possibly or ambiguously belong to each of the three stages are shown in parentheses or by a double-headed arrow.Subsequently, a duplication of the nuclear-located, chloroplast-derived rpl10 gene occurred (actually, probably separate duplications in monocots and in Brassicaceae), whose protein product appears to functionally compensate for mitochondrial RPL10 in certain plants. The mitochondrial rpl10 gene has become a pseudogene in some plants (Fig. 5B) and has been entirely lost from the mitochondrial genome in others (Fig. 5C). Extensive cDNA and nuclear genomic sequence data suggest that monocots and Brassicaceae no longer contain mitochondrial rpl10 in any genome. Our GFP assay demonstrated that the product of an extra copy of the nuclear gene for chloroplast RPL10 is imported into both mitochondria and chloroplasts in Arabidopsis and Oryza. These results strongly suggest that the mitochondrial RPL10 has been functionally replaced, probably twice independently, by the duplicated chloroplast counterpart in monocots and some Brassicaceae lineage. Functionality of the second copy in Raphanus is presently ambiguous, as all four homologous cDNAs of wild radish (R. raphanistrum) that are in GenBank (accession nos. EX746769, EX751093, FD961078, and FD965298) have either a frame-shift mutation or an internal stop codon. In this species, an additional copy of the second copy of the chloroplast-derived rpl10 gene may exist in the nuclear genome. A phylogenetic analysis of all available Brassicaceae cDNA sequences of the second copy does indeed suggest that it has been subject to further duplications in the Brassicaceae, including Raphanus (Supplementary Fig. S3).During the 17 years since the first complete mitochondrial genome was reported from plants, the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha,14 comparative genomic data have allowed the identification of a number of genes that were previously known only as unidentified ORFs. In the case of ribosomal proteins, 16 ribosomal protein genes were initially identified in the Marchantia mitochondrial genome,30 and this is the first case of the subsequent identification of any new ribosomal protein genes in Marchantia or any other land plant mitochondrial genome. The present study shows that plants are the only group of eukaryote other than Reclinomonas that still retain rpl10 in their mitochondrial genomes, and furthermore, that the evolution of rpl10 within plants has taken some unusual and interesting turns.Supplementary DataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was partly supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (B) (15780215) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan to N.K.Note added in proofAnother report on rpl10 in plant mitochondria will be published by Jeffrey P.

However, genomic research of mungbean has lagged behind other species in the Fabaceae family. Here, we reported the complete chloroplast (cp) genome sequence of mungbean obtained by the 454 pyrosequencing technology. The mungbean cp genome is 151 271 bp in length which includes a pair of inverted repeats (IRs) of 26 474 bp separated by a small single-copy region of 17 427 bp and a large single-copy region of 80 896 bp. The genome contains 108 unique genes and 19 of these genes are duplicated in the IR. Of these, 75 are predicted protein-coding genes, 4 ribosomal RNA genes and 29 tRNA genes. Relative to other plant cp genomes, we observed two distinct rearrangements: a 50-kb inversion between accD/rps16 and rbcL/trnK-UUU, and a 78-kb rearrangement between trnH/rpl14 and rps19/rps8. We detected sequence length polymorphism in the cp homopolymeric regions at the intra- and inter-specific levels in the Vigna species. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated a close relationship between Vigna and Phaseolus in the phaseolinae subtribe and provided a strong support for a monophyletic group of the eurosid I.1. IntroductionChloroplasts (cps) are plant organelles that contain biochemical machineries necessary to replicate and transcribe their own genomes. The cp genome of higher plants is a circular molecule of double-stranded DNA and highly conserved in terms of its structure and its gene content with the size ranging from 72 to 217 kb containing ~130 genes, depending on the plant species.1,2 A pair of large inverted repeats (IRs) that are usually 10–28 kb in length divides the genome into one large single-copy (LSC) region and one small single-copy (SSC) region. Despite high conservation of the cp genome, structural mutations such as gene duplications of tRNA genes,3ycf2, rpl19, rpl2, rpl234 and psbA;5 losses of ndh genes,6ycf genes, infA and accD;7–9 as well as rearrangements of cp genomes10 have been reported in plants and algae. The high level of cp genome rearrangement has been reported in specific lineages including green algae,11 Campanulaceae,12 Geraniaceae13 and Fabaceae.14Mungbean (Vigna radiata) is an important economical crop and a member of the Fabaceae family, comprising of around 20 000 species. To date, there are six complete legume cp genomes reported: Cicer arietinum15Trifolium subterraneum,16Phaseolus vulgaris,17Lotus japonicus,18Glycine max19 and Medicago truncatula (AC093544, unpublished). Cp genomes of plants in the Fabaceae family are known to have undergone more rearrangements than other angiosperms.15–20 Palmer and Thompson reported the complete loss of the IR in a group of legume species, such as species from the tribes Carmichaelieae, Cicereae, Hedysareae, Trifolieae, Vicieae and Galegeae.21–24 Furthermore, a common rearrangement that is shared in most papilionoid legumes is an inversion of a large segment of LSC region relative to all other land plants.15,20 Within the papilionoid tribe Phaseoleae, another large genome rearrangement in the LSC occurred in subtribe Phaseolinae such as Vigna and Phaseolus.14,25 Variations within cp genome sequences are useful for evolutionary studies from population-level processes to more distant phylogenetic relationships.24 Cp-derived markers, e.g. the matK gene and the trnL-trnF intergenic spacer, have been used to study the evolutionary relationship between legume plants.24,26–28 Repetitive sequences within the cp genomes are also potentially useful for ecological and evolutionary studies of plants.29 A high degree of length polymorphism at cp microsatellite loci has been reported in Pinus,30Glycine,31 rice32 and barley.33 Not only will the information from cp genomes be useful for studies of phylogenetic relationships, but it will also facilitate cp transformation in economically important crops. So far, G. max is the only legume in which cp genomes have been successfully transformed to express foreign genes.34,35Since the first report on the complete cp genome of Marchantia polymorpha,36 there are more than 150 complete cp genomes from plants and algae deposited in the GenBank so far. The traditional labour-intensive method for obtaining plastid genome sequence involves isolation of cp DNA followed by random shearing, cloning into BAC or Fosmid vector, and then shotgun sequencing. Recent methods based on long PCR amplification using the conserved cp primers,37–40 amplification of the entire genome using rolling circle amplification41,42 and high-throughput sequencing43–45 have been achieved for fast and cost-effective approaches for cp genome sequencing. In this work, we reported the use of 454 sequencing technology to obtain the genome sequence of mungbean cps for analysis of the structural organization and phylogenetic relationships.2. Materials and methods2.1 DNA sequencing, assembly and annotationThe DNA was isolated from 1 g of young leaves of 10-day-old V. radiata (L.) Wilczek accession KPS1 using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, CA, USA). The DNA (10 µg) was sheared by nebulization, subjected to 454 library preparation and shotgun sequencing using the Genome Sequencer (GS) FLX platform46 at the in-house facility (National Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Thailand). The obtained nucleotide sequence reads were assembled using the Newbler de novo sequence assembly software. The cp genome sequence was compared with the reference sequence from the complete cp genome of P. vulgaris using the Sequencher software (Gene Codes Corporation, MI, USA). Remaining gaps were closed by PCR and nucleotide sequencing using BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle sequencing kit. The primer pairs used for closing the gaps are (i) gap_LSCF: AAT TGG ATA GGA TGG CCT TTG, gap_LSCR: TAG CTC AGT TGG TAG AGC AGA GG; and (ii) gap_IRF: CTG TCC TAG TTG ATC CCG ATT C, gap_IRR: AGA GTG CTT TTT CGA TTC ATC C. For polymorphism test, DNA samples were isolated from young leaves of 10-day-old plants: five samples from V. radiata accessions H262 (India), H337 (Afghanistan), H412 (Madagascar), H417 (Nigeria) and KPS1 (Thailand); one sample from Vigna mungo accession Subsamotod (Thailand); one sample from Vigna umbellata accession JP99485 (Japan); and two samples from Vigna unguiculata accessions VU210 (Loas) and TVNU294 (Tanzania), using DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen).2.2 PCR amplificationPCR was carried out in a total volume of 20 µl containing 2 ng of DNA template, 1× buffer, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 1 U Phusion DNA polymerase (Finnzymes, Finland) and 0.5 µM each of forward and reverse primers. The junctions between LSC and IR were confirmed by PCR and nucleotide sequencing using the following primer pairs: (i) JL_F1: GTT TTC AAC AAA ACC CTC TCG T, JL_R1: CCT ACT CTA AAC TTC CGA GGA CA; and (ii) JL_F2: ACT CTA AAC TTC CGA GGA CAT GC, JL_R2: TTT ATC TCT CCA ATT CCC TCG AC. The junctions between SSC and IR were confirmed by PCR and nucleotide sequencing using the following primer pairs: (i) JS_F1: CAG CAA CAA CTG GGT TTA TTA CG, JS_R1: TAC TTT ATT CGT TGG GGC CAT AG; and (ii) JS_F2: CTC TTC CAT CAC CTT GAT ATG TAT G, JS_R2: GGG ACA GCT CAT AAT CTT CAT GT. Amplification was performed in a GeneAmp PCR 9700 System thermocycler (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA) programmed as follows: 94°C for 2 min followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 55°C for 1 min, 72°C for 3 min and a final extension step at 72°C for 10 min. Amplified products were run on either 1% agarose gel or 5% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and visualized by silver staining.2.3 Genome analysisThe genome was annotated using the program DOGMA (Dual Organellar GenoMe Annotator47). The predicted annotations were verified using BLAST similarity search.48 All genes, rRNAs and tRNAs were identified using the plastid/bacterial genetic code. Comparison of cp genome structures of Glycine,19Lotus,18Medicago [NC_003119], Phaseolus,17Cicer15 and Vigna (published here) was performed using the Mauve software.49 REPuter50 was used to identify and locate direct repeat, IR and reverse complement sequences with n= 30 bp and a sequence identity =90%.2.4 Phylogenetic analysisA set of 25 protein-coding genes including matK, petA, petB, petD, petG, petN, psaB, psbB, psbC, psbD, psbE, psbF, psbH, psbI, psbJ, psbK, psbN, psbT, rpoB, rpoC1, rpoC2, rps8, rps11, rps14 and ycf3, from 34 cp genomes representing all lineages of angiosperms, were analysed. These 25 genes are commonly present in all 34 cp genomes and publicly available in the GenBank database. Sequences were aligned using MUSCLE version 3.6,51 the alignment was edited manually. For maximum likelihood (ML) analysis, RAxML version 7.052 was used with the GTR matrix (GTR + G model). The local bootstrap probability of each branch was calculated by 100 replications. Phylogenetic analyses using maximum parsimony (MP) method was performed using PAUP version 4.0b10.53 MP searches included 1000 random addition replicates and a heuristic search using tree bisection and reconnection (TBR) branch swapping with the Multrees option. Bootstrap analysis was performed with 100 replicates with TBR branch swapping. TreeView54 was used for displaying and printing phylogenetic trees.3. Results and discussion3.1 Sequencing results and general featuresSequencing of V. radiata genomic DNA was carried out using 454 Life Sciences technology on the GS FLX system. A total of 932 958 quality filtered sequence reads were generated with the average read length of 217 bases covering 202 Mb. Assembly of the nucleotide sequence reads was performed to obtain non-redundant contigs and singlets using the Newbler, a de novo sequence assembly software. From the assembly analysis, three contigs were shown to be part of the cp genome by alignment with the P. vulgaris cp genome using the Sequencher software. These three contigs were assembled from 48 682 reads (5.22%) and the average genome sequencing depth of each nucleotide on the mungbean cp genome was 61.25×. There were three gaps locating in the non-coding regions in the LSC and IRs with sizes of 28 (at the position 15 597–15 624), 286 (at the position 83 732–84 017) and 286 bp (at the position 148 152–148 437), respectively. The 28-bp gap was a (TA)11 repeat between ndhJ and trnF-GAA. The 286-bp gaps were copies of <U+03A8>ycf2 present in IRa and IRb. These gaps were probably due to the lack of long sequencing reads that can resolve the locations of four copies of the ycf2 fragment during sequence assembly. These gaps were closed by PCR and nucleotide sequencing using BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle sequencing kit. There were no examples of cp DNA containing non-contiguous sequences that might indicate a nuclear location.Homopolymer is a stretch of the same nucleotide sequence which has been documented to contribute to technical sequencing errors when using 454 Life Science Technology.44,55 Throughout the mungbean cp genome, there are 205 homopolymers (n > 7 bp); 73 homopolymers were present in 20 protein-coding genes and 132 homopolymers were present in non-coding regions. Among the protein-coding genes, ycf1 contains the highest number of homopolymers (22), followed by rpoC2 (8), rpoC1 (6), matK (5) and ndhF (5). The Majority of homopolymers present in the 454 data set was 8 bp long (127), followed by 9 bp long (51). As the length of homopolymer increased, fewer numbers were identified. The longest homopolymer sequences were 13 bp long which only presented twice in the data set. Out of 205 homopolymers, 201 were poly(A/T) and 4 were poly(G/C). To determine the accuracy of these sequences, we performed nucleotide sequencing of all homopolymers that are longer than 7 bp using BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle sequencing kit (Supplementary Table S1). Although the homopolymer regions had a deep average sequencing depth of 74.6× and high-quality score of QV 64, we observed that 49 bases in 44 positions out of 1763 homopolymeric bases in 205 positions required correction. Of these, 12 positions were from homopolymers present in coding sequences and the other 32 positions were in non-coding regions. The complete cp genome sequence was reported in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank nucleotide sequence database (GQ893027).The complete cp genome size of mungbean is 151 271 bp including the LSC of 80 896 bp, the SSC of 17 427 bp and a pair of IRs of 26 474 bp each (Fig. 1). The mungbean cp genome size is in range with those from other angiosperms. The IRs span from rps19 to a portion of ycf1. The average AT content of the mungbean cp genome is 64.82%, consistent with the AT content reported for other plant cp genomes. The AT contents of the LSC and SSC regions are 67.4% and 71.35%, respectively, whereas that of the IR regions is 58.26%.Map of the V. radiata cp genome.

Genes outside the map are transcribed clockwise and those inside the map are transcribed counter clockwise. Genes containing introns and pseudogenes are marked with * and #, respectively.3.2 Genome content and organizationThe mungbean cp genome contains 108 unique genes including 29 tRNA genes, 4 rRNA genes and 75 predicted protein-coding genes (Table 1). In addition, there are 19 genes duplicated in the IR, making a total of 127 genes present in the mungbean cp genome. There are 18 genes containing one or more introns, 7 of these are tRNA genes and the other 11 genes are protein-coding genes. The trnK-UUU gene has the largest intron (2564 bp) where another gene, the matK gene, is present. There are unique 29 tRNA genes (7 tRNA genes duplicated in the IR) representing 20 amino acids identified in the genome (Table 2). On the basis of the sequences of protein-coding genes and tRNA genes within the cp genome, we were able to deduce the frequency of codon usage as summarized in Table 2. We observed that the codon usage was biased towards a high representation of A and T at the third codon position. Non-coding sequences, including intergenic spaces and introns, comprise about 41.45% of the mungbean cp genome, which is close to the proportion of non-coding sequences observed in other cp genomes.56–60 Two ycf genes (ycf15 and ycf68) are probably not functional in the mungbean cp genome due to the presence of premature stop codons. In several cp genomes, ycf15 and ycf68 have also been reported as non-functional genes.17,61,62 A comparison of gene content between the legumes with complete cp genome sequences and the Arabidopsis cp genome shows that rpl22 and infA are missing from all legumes.63,64 Phylogenetic analysis of the nuclear rpl22 gene suggested the transfer event to the nucleus occurred at an early stage of angiosperm evolution.64 The loss of infA from the cp genome to the nucleus has been reported to occur multiple times during the angiosperm evolution.9 The rps16 gene is probably non-functional in V. radiata since it contains three internal stop codons and its initial start codon is AGA. The rps16 gene is lost in other legumes such as Medicago and Cicer. On the basis of hybridization experiments using rps16 probe, at least 15 independent losses occurred in the tribe Phaseoleae alone.65 The mungbean rpl33 gene contains premature stop codons within the coding region and probably present as a pseudogene as in Phaseolus.17 Instead of a common ATG at the translation initiation site, the mungbean ndhD gene has an ACG codon which has also been observed in the cp genomes of Phaseolus, Lotus, Pisum, Glycine and Cicer. For ndhD transcripts, the ACG codon has been shown to convert to the AUG initiation site as reported in pea,66 leek,67 tobacco, spinach and snapdragon.68 It is likely that a similar role of RNA editing in translation process also occurs in mungbean cps.Genes present in the V. radiata cp genomeaGene containing two introns.bGene containing a single intron.cTwo gene copies in the IRs.dGene divided into two independent transcription units.Genes present in the V. radiata cp genomeaGene containing two introns.bGene containing a single intron.cTwo gene copies in the IRs.dGene divided into two independent transcription units.The codon–anticodon recognition pattern and codon usage for L. japonicus cp genomeNumerals indicate the frequency of usage of each codon in 26 274 codons in 82 potential protein-coding genes.The codon–anticodon recognition pattern and codon usage for L. japonicus cp genomeNumerals indicate the frequency of usage of each codon in 26 274 codons in 82 potential protein-coding genes.The cp genome structures of previously sequenced legumes (Glycine,19Lotus,18Medicago [NC_003119], Phaseolus17 and Cicer15) and Vigna as reported here were compared with the Arabidopsis cp genome as the reference sequence using the Mauve software49 (Fig. 2). Cp genomes of Medicago and Cicer have lost one copy of the IR and were grouped together in the IR-lacking clade. In mungbean, the border position between the IRa and LSC (JLA) is located in the intergenic region between rps19 and rps8, whereas the junction position between the IRb and LSC (JLB) is located in the intergenic region between rps19 and rps3. The locations of JLA and JLB in mungbean are similar to those in adzuki bean and common bean.14 In contrast, Glycine and Lotus cp genomes contain a small fragment of rps19 in the IR; therefore, rps19 is only present in the S10B Operon (on the JLB side).18 Shifts in the border positions between IRs and LSC at the JLA and JLB have been reported in several species of angiosperms, demonstrating that the IR/LSC boundaries are dynamic.Comparison of legume cp genomes with Arabidopsis cp DNA as a reference using MAUVE.

The boxes above the line represent DNA sequences in clockwise direction and those below the line represent DNA sequences in the anticlockwise direction. The gene names at the bottom indicate the boundaries of the boxes within the mungbean cp DNA.The mungbean cp genome, as in common with the Phaseolus cp genome, possesses two distinct rearrangements, a 50-kb inversion between accD/rps16 and rbcL/trnK-UUU, and a 78-kb rearrangement between trnH/rpl14 and rps19/rps8 (Fig. 2). The first inversion is common in papilionoid legumes indicating an early split in the diversification of papilionoid members.15,69,70 The second inversion is a distinct rearrangement which is found in subtribe Phaseolinae.14,20,25 It encompasses nearly the entire fragment of the LSC and disrupts the S10 operon. Perry et al.14 proposed that this rearrangement occurred after an expansion of the IR such that a copy of the rpl23-rpl2-rps19-rps3-rpl16-rpl14 genes were introduced in the IRs, followed by the deletion of original genes that became duplicated. Like adzuki bean and Phaseolus, the position IR borders of mungbean have expanded to include the entire rps19 gene when compared with the soybean IR borders. The expansion–contraction model suggested that the contraction did not trim the IR back to its original point as seen in soybean, but instead duplicated the entire rps19, leaving two copies in the IR.14 Therefore, evidence in the mungbean IR border also supports the expansion/contraction mechanism of this 78-kb rearrangement.3.3 Polymorphism test of the homopolymeric regions and repeated sequence analysisWe tested for sequence length polymorphism of 16 homopolymers among five accessions of V. radiata, two accessions of V. unguiculata (VU210 and TVNU294), one accession of V. mungo and one accession of V. umbellata (Supplementary Table S2 for details of the primers used, product size and distribution of polymorphism). We observed sequence length polymorphism in 15 loci among Vigna species. An example of polymorphic loci is illustrated in Fig. 3. These 15 primer pairs were able to detect a range of 2–4 alleles with a mean of 2.133 alleles per locus. The joint distribution of length variants at these 15 polymorphic loci in the cp DNA revealed five haplotypes among the four Vigna species (Supplementary Table S2). Although there was no polymorphism detected between varieties of V. radiata, interestingly, we observed polymorphism at the intra-specific level in V. unguiculata. This demonstrated that cp microsatellites reported in this study could provide an assay for detecting polymorphism at the population-level and for comparison of more distant phylogenetic relationships at the genus level or above. These cp microsatellites can also be useful in ecological and evolutionary studies because they are non-recombinant, haploid and uniparentally inherited.A representative microsatellite locus (Locus 113; forward primer 5'-GAA ACC CTT CCT GAA AAA TCC-3' and reverse primer 5'-TCT TTG ACG AAT GCA AGT GG-3') with polymorphism among Vigna species: V. radiata accessions KPS1, H262, H337, H412, H417, V. mungo accession Subsamotod, V. umbellata accession JP99485, V. unguiculata accessions VU210 and TVNU294.

PCR products were separated on 5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by silver staining.Analysis of the repeat sequences in the mungbean cp genome identified 22 direct repeats and 28 IRs of 30 bp or longer with a sequence identity of 90% (Table 3). Thirty repeats are 30–40 bp long, 11 repeats are 41–50 bp long, 4 repeats are 51–80 bp long and 5 repeats are longer than 80 bp. The longest direct repeat in mungbean cp DNA is a 287-bp duplication of an internal fragment of ycf2 (<U+03A8>ycf2) in the IRs which shared a very high sequence homology with those of G. max and P. vulgaris. Most of the direct repeats are distributed within the intergenic spacer regions, the intron sequences, and in the trnS, and ycf2 genes.A list of repeated sequences and their locations identified using REPuter with n= 30 bp, and a sequence identity =90% in the V. radiata cp genomeD, direct repeat; IR, inverted repeat; IGS, intergenic space.A list of repeated sequences and their locations identified using REPuter with n= 30 bp, and a sequence identity =90% in the V. radiata cp genomeD, direct repeat; IR, inverted repeat; IGS, intergenic space.3.4 Phylogenetic analysisOur phylogenetic data set included 25 protein-coding genes for 34 plant taxa (Supplementary Table S3), including 32 angiosperms and two outgroup gymnosperms (Pinus and Ginkgo). These 25 genes are commonly present in all the 34 cp genomes, therefore should reduce missing data from the sequence alignment. The sequence alignment that was used for phylogenetic analyses comprised 20 454 characters. MP analysis resulted in a single resolved tree with a length of 29 081, a consistency index of 0.4939 and a retention index of 0.6399 (Fig. 4). Bootstrap analyses indicated that there were 27 out of 31 nodes with values =95%, and 25 of these had a bootstrap value of 100%. ML analysis resulted in a single tree with -ln L = -166 999.997. ML bootstrap values were also high, with values of =95% for 29 of the 32 nodes, and 27 nodes with 100% bootstrap support. Both MP and ML trees had the same topologies which formed two major clades, monocots and eudicots. The trees revealed a monophyly of the monocots and eudicots where Ranunculales was placed as sister to the remaining eudicots. Within the eudicots, there were two major clades: rosids and asterids. Within the rosid clade, there were two major groups, the eurosids I and eurosids II which were sister to the Myrtales group. The placement of Cucumis has been problematic in previous reports.45,59 In some studies, Cucumis was placed with the Myrtales,45 or in the eurosids I.58,71,72 In our study, both MP and ML trees provided a strong support for the monophyly of the eurosids I clade because Cucumis is sister to the legume taxa. Among seven legumes with complete cp DNA sequences, Cicer, Medicago and Trifolium were grouped together as IR lacking millettioids clade (IRLC) and placed as sister to Lotus. IRLC members have been shown to form a monophyletic group supported by phylogenetic trees based on matK24 and nuclear rDNA sequences.73Vigna was sister to Phaseolus in the Phaseolinae subtribe and was sister to Glycine in the tribe Phaseoleae. A monophyletic group of the Phaseolinae subtribe was also supported by previously reported trees, based on the matK gene24 and a distinct 78-kb rearrangement of the cp genome.25The MP phylogenetic tree is based on 25 protein-coding genes from 34 plant taxa. The MP tree has a length of 29 081 with a consistency index of 0.4939 and a retention index of 0.6399. Numbers above node are bootstrap support values. Ordinal and higher level group names are also indicated. The ML tree has the same topology but is not shown.The MP phylogenetic tree is based on 25 protein-coding genes from 34 plant taxa.

The ML tree has the same topology but is not shown.In conclusion, we performed shotgun genome sequencing of V. radiata using the 454 pyrosequencing technology and obtained the complete cp genome sequence. The approach has been demonstrated here as a fast and efficient way for obtaining organellar genomes. Gene content and structural organization of mungbean cp genome is similar to that of P. vulgaris, its relative in Phaseoleae. We determined the distribution and the location of repeated sequences in the V. radiata cp genome and explored the use of polymorphic microsatellites at the intra-and inter-specific levels among Vigna species. The proposed phylogenetic relationships among angiosperms, based on cp DNA sequences including those of mungbean cp DNA reported here, provided a strong support for a monophyletic group of the eurosid I and demonstrated a close relationship between Vigna and Phaseolus in the Phaseolinae subtribe.Supplementary DataSupplementary Data is available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingWe acknowledge funding support by the Genome Institute, National Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology.We are thankful to Prof. Srinives of Kasetsart University, Thailand, for providing samples of Vigna species used in this study and Dr Darin Kongkasuriyachai for reviewing the manuscript.Supplementary data"

DNA is anchored to the NM by non-coding sequences known as matrix attachment regions (MARs). There are no consensus sequences for identification of MARs and not all potential MARs are actually bound to the NM constituting loop attachment regions (LARs). Fundamental processes of nuclear physiology occur at macromolecular complexes organized on the NM; thus, the topological organization of DNA loops must be important. Here, we describe a general method for determining the structural DNA loop organization in any large genomic region with a known sequence. The method exploits the topological properties of loop DNA attached to the NM and elementary topological principles such as that points in a deformable string (DNA) can be positionally mapped relative to a position-reference invariant (NM), and from such mapping, the configuration of the string in third dimension can be deduced. Therefore, it is possible to determine the specific DNA loop configuration without previous characterization of the LARs involved. We determined in hepatocytes and B-lymphocytes of the rat the DNA loop organization of a genomic region that contains four members of the albumin gene family.1. IntroductionIn the interphase nucleus of metazoan cells, the DNA is organized in supercoiled loops anchored to a nuclear substructure commonly known as the nuclear matrix (NM) which is a non-soluble complex of ribonucleoproteins obtained after extracting the nucleus with non-ionic detergents, high salt and treatment with DNase.1,2 The exact composition of the NM is a matter of debate as some 400 proteins have been associated with this structure.3 The DNA is anchored to the NM by means of non-coding sequences of variable length known as matrix attachment regions (MARs). Yet, there is no consensus sequence for a priori identification of MARs, although they are generally rich in AT and repetitive sequences, and map to regions where the DNA is intrinsically curved or kinked and has a propensity for base unpairing.4 MARs are operationally classified into structural-constitutive, resistant to high-salt extraction and functional-facultative, non-resistant to high-salt extraction.5,6 Therefore, not all potential MARs are actually bound to the NM constituting true loop attachment regions (LARs).5 There is evidence that when multiple copies of a specific MAR are present, these are used in a selective fashion, indicating the adaptability of the MAR sequence to serve as anchor only under certain conditions.7 The higher-order structure of interphase and metaphase chromosomes is likely to be maintained by constitutive MARs.4,8 It has been suggested that the dynamic selectivity in the use of MARs as DNA anchors would modulate both the DNA loop average length and the stability of the topological relationships between DNA and the NM during development and cell differentiation.9,10 Only a very limited number of proteins have been identified that participate in sequence-specific binding of DNA to the NM.2,4 However, saturation experiments indicate the existence of some 150 000 salt-resistant DNA-binding sites per NM in rat hepatocytes,11 whereas the average DNA loop size in adult rat hepatocytes is 80–90 kb,12 and this figure is compatible with roughly 66 000 DNA loops per rat diploid genome.13 Therefore, given that there are no MAR consensus sequences, these facts imply that such DNA–NM interactions are the result of indirect readout effects between DNA and NM proteins and thus not equivalent to the direct readout interactions between transcription factors and specific DNA sequences.14 Such sequence-independent DNA–protein interactions depend on DNA shape and overall DNA mechanical properties such as curvature, helical twist and bending and torsional flexibilities,15 therefore the local topology (spatial configuration) of the DNA involved must be a determining factor.16 Fundamental processes of nuclear physiology such as DNA replication, transcription and processing of primary transcripts occur at macromolecular complexes or factories organized on the NM.17–19 Thus, the topological relationship between the DNA loops and the NM appears to be very important for appropriate nuclear physiology. Indeed, correct repair of DNA damage must include the recovery of both the double helix integrity and the complex three-dimensional DNA topology; otherwise, the cell will not survive.20,21Varied approaches have been used for establishing the DNA loop organization in a given region of the genome, based on the experimental22–26 or the in silico identification of MARs27 which has been shown to be quite unreliable in the absence of experimental confirmation,28 and more recently on a combination of both approaches coupled to high-throughput analytical techniques.29,30 All these methods have their specific advantages and pitfalls, but all of them have as priority the identification of the actual MARs (LARs) in a given DNA region so as to infer from such data the possible DNA loop organization. However, considering that DNA is a continuous helical string that becomes looped by binding to the NM, thus establishing a topological higher-order in third-dimensional space, it follows from elementary topological considerations that by mapping the relative positions to the NM of several points (i.e. DNA sequences) along a given string of DNA whose whole sequence is known, it will be possible to establish the spatial configuration of the loops formed by such a DNA string without the need of characterizing the LARs involved. We have previously developed a method for mapping the position of any DNA sequence relative to the NM based on the direct use of PCR on NM-bound templates.31 An extension of this method, described hereunder, was used for determining the structural DNA loop organization in a region of 162 kb in chromosome 14 of the rat where four closely related genes that are members of the albumin gene family are located. Such a characterization was done in nucleoids which consist of the NM plus the naked DNA loops attached to it, obtained from freshly isolated hepatocytes and naïve B-lymphocytes from the rat and so the resulting DNA loop organization very likely corresponds to the actual in vivo organization.2. Materials and methods2.1. AnimalsMale Wistar rats weighing 200–250 g were used in accordance with the official Mexican norm for production, care and use of laboratory animals (NOM-062-ZOO-1999).2.2. Primary cellsPrimary rat hepatocytes were obtained from livers of male Wistar rats, using the protocol described previously.6 Briefly, the livers were washed in situ by perfusion with PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+ (PBS-A) at 37°C for 5 min at 15 ml/min. Next, the tissue was perfused with a solution of collagenase IV, Sigma (0.025% collagenase with 0.075% CaCl2 in HEPES buffer, pH 7.6) for 8 min. Viable hepatocytes were counted in a haemocytometer and used immediately for preparing nucleoids (see below). Primary naïve B-lymphocytes were obtained from the spleen of male Wistar rats. Briefly, the spleen was fragmented and filtered in PBS-A. Total lymphocytes were isolated in preformed gradients of isotonic Percoll (25%) by centrifugation at 2100 rpm 15 min at room temperature. Subsequently, naïve B-lymphocytes were purified by magnetic separation (MACS Separation columns, Miltenyi Biotec) with anti-CD43-specific beads (rat CD43 microbeads, Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Viable B-lymphocytes were counted in a haemocytometer and used immediately for preparing nucleoids.2.3. Preparation of nucleoidsThe DNA loops plus the nuclear substructure constitute a ‘nucleoid’, a very large nucleoprotein aggregate generated by gentle lysis of a cell at pH 8 in non-ionic detergent and the presence of high-salt concentration. Nucleoids were prepared as described previously.21,31 Briefly, freshly isolated and washed hepatocytes and naïve B-lymphocytes are suspended in ice-cold PBS-A, and aliquots of 50 µl containing 3 × 105 hepatocytes or 5 × 105 lymphocytes are gently mixed with 150 µl of a lysis solution containing 2.6 M NaCl, 1.3 mM EDTA, 2.6 mM Tris, 0.6% Triton-X 100 (pH 8.0). After 20 min for hepatocytes and 15 min for native B-lymphocytes (at 4°C), the mixture is washed in 14 ml of PBS-A at 4°C for 4 min at 3000 rpm (1500 g). The pellet is recovered in a volume ranging from 200 to 300 µl.2.4. DNase I digestion of nucleoid samplesThe washed nucleoids are pooled for setting up the DNase I digestion curves (1.8 × 106 nucleoids of hepatocytes or 2.5 × 106 nucleoids of naïve B-lymphocytes in 1.2 ml of PBS-A) and mixed with 5 ml of DNase I digestion buffer (10 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM dithiothreitol, 50 mM Tris at pH 7.2). Digestions were carried out at 37°C with 0.5 U/ml DNase I (Sigma). Each digestion time-point aliquot contains 3 × 105 nucleoids of hepatocytes or 5 × 105 nucleoids of B-lymphocytes. Digestion reactions were stopped by adding 200 µl of stop buffer (final EDTA concentration of 30 mM). The stop buffer contains 0.2 M EDTA and 10 mM Tris at pH 7.5. After digestion with DNase I, the NM-bound DNA was determined by spectrometry on aliquots of partially digested nucleoid samples that were washed and further handled as described previously.31 The final nucleoid pellet was re-suspended in 200 µl of double-distilled H2O to be used directly as a template for PCR.2.5. Genomic DNA primersDistinct sets of primers were designed for establishing the topological positions relative to the NM of 15 small DNA sequences located along 162 kb of the genomic region containing four members of the rat albumin gene family. Primer pairs were designed approximately 10 kb each in order to establish rather regular intervals along the region studied. We took into account important considerations in the oligonucleotide design so as to get primers with high specificity but able to perform efficient DNA amplification under the same PCR conditions (reactants concentrations, temperatures, times of each step and number of cycles). It is important to remark that MARs are not suitable targets for high-quality primer design, because their characteristic composition (richness of A-T tracks and repetitive DNA) prevents an acceptable design. Therefore, both potential and actual MARs within the chosen region are likely to be excluded by our primer-design algorithms. All primer sets were designed with a length of 20–25 bp, G-C content between 50% and 55% (with a difference <3%), Tm of 55–60°C (with a difference <2°C), and PCR products of 250–550 bp (Table 1). Secondary structures with <U+0394>G < -1 kcal/mol and dimmers/duplexes with <U+0394>G < -2 kcal/mol were avoided. Additionally, the specificity of each primer set was confirmed by the NCBI BLAST algorithm.Sets of primers and corresponding amplicon sizes defining 15 target sequences along the 162-kb genomic region containing members of the rat albumin gene familySets of primers and corresponding amplicon sizes defining 15 target sequences along the 162-kb genomic region containing members of the rat albumin gene family2.6. PCR amplificationFifty nanograms of NM-bound DNA was used as a template for PCR. PCR was carried out using 0.7 U GoTaq DNA polymerase (Promega), 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM of each dNTP and 0.1 µM of each primer. Amplification was performed in an Applied Biosystems 2720 thermocycler and the same amplification program was used for all pairs of primers: initial denaturising step at 94°C for 5 min, denaturising step at 94°C for 45 s, annealing at 56°C for 30 s and extension at 72°C for 1 min for 35 cycles, with a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. The identity of all the amplicons was confirmed by restriction analysis with the appropriate restriction enzymes. Amplicons were electrophoresed on 2% agarose gels and visualized using ethidium bromide staining (0.5 µl/ml), recorded and analyzed using a Kodak 1D Image Analysis Software 3.5 system. Amplicons were scored as positive or negative on partially digested nucleoid samples, depending on whether they are detectable by the software using the default settings.2.7. Computer-aided prediction of MAR sequencesThe potential MARs in the region studied were identified by in silico prediction using four different freely available software: MarFinder,32 MARScan,33 ChrClass34 and SMARtest.273. Results and discussion3.1. Rationale of the methodOur method exploits the topological properties of the average DNA loop that result from the fact that such loops are topologically constrained by being anchored to the NM, thus being equivalent to closed DNA circles. Under such a condition, the DNA molecule undergoes structural stress resulting from two factors: the covalently linked backbones of the DNA strands are helicoidal but rigid, and the low-energy hydrogen bonds between the stacked bases are quasi-statistical unions that continuously break apart and form again; such a situation poses the risk that the nucleotide bases may gyrate away from the double-helix axis and become exposed. DNA naturally solves this structural-stress problem by further coiling upon its own axis, thus avoiding the exposure of the nucleotide bases, but becoming negatively supercoiled in a similar fashion to a pulled house-telephone cord.35,36 Thus, the naked DNA loops display a gradient of supercoiling that goes from lower to higher from tip to base of the loop,36 save for the fact that the structural properties of MARs are such that they also function as buffers or sinks of negative supercoiling37,38 thus avoiding maximal supercoiling at the base of the loops. The NM plus the naked DNA loops anchored to it constitute a nucleoid. Under the conditions of lysis employed to generate nucleoids, the DNA remains essentially intact, although it lacks the nucleosome structure because of the dissociation of histones and most other nuclear proteins usually associated with DNA; yet, the DNA loops remain topologically constrained and supercoiled as depicted in Fig. 1. Indeed, nucleoids are also known as nuclear halos since the exposure of such structures to DNA-intercalating agents like ethidium bromide leads to unwinding of the DNA loops that form a DNA halo around the NM periphery (Fig. 1C). A typical DNA loop can be divided into four topological zones according to their relative proximity to the NM. Each of these zones would manifest an identifiable behaviour when exposed to non-specific nucleases that are sensitive to the local DNA topology (Fig. 1A). We have previously shown that in nucleoid preparations, the relative resistance of a given loop-DNA sequence to a limited concentration of DNase I is directly proportional to its proximity to the NM anchoring point.31,39 Two main factors determine this property. (i) Steric hindrance resulting from the proteinaceous NM that acts as a physical barrier relatively protecting the naked loop DNA that is closer to the NM from endonuclease action. (ii) The local degree of loop DNA supercoiling that is lower in the distal portions of the loop and higher in the regions proximal to the NM. Supercoiling is a structural barrier against the action of non-specific endonucleases, such as DNase I, that hydrolyze the DNA backbone by a single-strand cleavage (nicking) mechanism.40 Both factors only confer relative but not absolute DNase I resistance to loop DNA. However, in a large sample of nucleoids exposed to a limited concentration of DNase I, there is a consistent trend in which the loop-DNA sensitivity to the enzyme is inversely proportional to its distance relative to the NM and so distal regions of the loop are digested first whereas the regions closer to the NM are digested later. Indeed, it is known that the DNA embedded within the NM is very resistant to DNase I action, and there is a fraction corresponding to some 2% the total DNA that is basically non-digestible even when exposed to high concentrations of the enzyme. This fraction corresponds to fragments with an average length of 1.6 kb in rat hepatocytes,12 likely to represent the regions that include the actual MARs (LARs) anchored to the NM. This pattern of sensitivity to DNase I holds provided that the DNA is basically devoid of histones and most other proteins that form chromatin. Indeed, whole chromatin attached to the NM shows an inverse pattern of nuclease sensitivity compared with that of naked loop DNA. In looped chromatin, those sequences closer to the matrix attachment point are preferentially cleaved by nucleases.41Properties of naked DNA loops attached to the NM.

Differential kinetics of loop DNA digestion as a function of proximity to the NMTreatment of nucleoids from quiescent, freshly isolated rat hepatocytes, with a limited concentration of DNase I (0.5 U/ml) produces a highly reproducible kinetics of digestion of loop DNA (Fig. 2A). It is possible to identify three different phases in the digestion curve: the first corresponds to a very fast kinetics of digestion that removes almost 60% the total DNA associated with the NM within the first 5 min. Such a DNA corresponds to the loop fraction distal to the NM; in such a fraction, relatively minor DNA supercoiling is the only barrier to the endonuclease action. Moreover, as the DNase I nicks the loop DNA, each nick becomes a point of further DNA unwinding, thus increasing the reduction in loop supercoiling in time and so making more accessible the loop DNA to the action of the endonuclease. The second phase that lasts ~10 min shows a reduced kinetics of digestion in which some further 10% loop DNA is removed. This slower kinetics is the result of the slower rate of supercoiling loss in the loop DNA proximal to the NM (originally highly supercoiled) that slows down the action of the enzyme. The third and slowest phase, lasting 45 min, shows the removal of some further 10% total DNA associated with the NM. This very slow kinetics results from two factors: the effect of any residual DNA supercoiling and principally of the proximity between the loop DNA and the NM proteins that act as physical barriers against the action of DNase I on the loop DNA that is very close to the NM. Finally, there is about 20% total DNA that remains bound to the NM even after 60 min of treatment with DNase I. This fraction corresponds to the DNA that is actually embedded within the NM, and so it is rather inaccessible to the limited concentration of DNase I used.Kinetics of nucleoid DNA digestion. Nucleoids were digested with DNase-I (0.5 U/ml). Each time-point value is the average of separate experiments with samples obtained from separate animals (n = 9 for hepatocytes, n = 4 for naïve B-lymphocytes). Bars indicate the corresponding SD. The topological zones relative to the NM correspond to decreasing percentages of total DNA bound to the NM. (A) For hepatocytes: distal to NM (100–42% total DNA), proximal to NM (42–30% total DNA), very close to NM (30–19% total DNA) and embedded within NM (19–0% total DNA). The corresponding slopes are the following: 0–5 min = -9.80; 5–15 min = -1.70; 15–30 min = -0.47 and 30–60 min = -0.17. Hence, the slope of the digestion curve became close to zero by 60 min of DNase I treatment and remained like that even after 120 min of incubation with the enzyme (slope 60–120 min = -0.17). (B) For naïve B-lymphocytes: distal to NM (100–33% total DNA), proximal to NM (33–7% total DNA), very close to NM (7–4% total DNA) and embedded within NM (4–0% total DNA). The corresponding slopes are the following: 0–5 min = -11.46; 5–15 min = -2.84; 15–30 min = -0.61 and 30–60 min = -0.06 (slope 60–120 min = -0.03). Hence, the slope of the digestion curve also became close to zero by 60 min of DNase I treatment.Kinetics of nucleoid DNA digestion. Nucleoids were digested with DNase-I (0.5 U/ml).

Hence, the slope of the digestion curve also became close to zero by 60 min of DNase I treatment.Nucleoids from naïve B-lymphocyte treated with the same limited concentration of DNase I display a faster kinetics of loop-DNA digestion, and so after 60 min of treatment with the enzyme, the amount of total DNA embedded within the NM is very small (=4.0%), yet the digestion of further loop DNA stalls and becomes negligible afterwards (Fig. 2B). The average DNA loop size in naïve B-lymphocytes is rather similar to that in hepatocytes, yet the DNA–NM interactions are more fragile in B-lymphocytes when compared with hepatocytes, and comparative PAGE analysis shows that the relative amount of typical NM proteins is significantly reduced in naïve B-lymphocytes, in particular the three nuclear lamins (A, B and C) that are major components of standard NM preparations (our unpublished results). Hence, the presence of a less dense NM in the nucleoids from naïve B-lymphocytes explains why the fraction of total DNA that is relatively protected from DNase I action is significantly smaller than that in nucleoids from hepatocytes. Depending on the cell type of the nucleoids studied, preliminary experiments must be carried out so as to define the concentration of DNase I suitable to produce consistent tri-phasic digestion curves (Fig. 2A and B). On the basis of our experience working with several cell lines31 and different types of primary cells, the range of DNase I concentrations to be considered is between 1.0 and 0.05 U/ml. Indeed, extensive damage to DNA due to incorrect nucleoid preparation and handling, or the natural presence of nicked DNA in some terminally differentiated cell types (such as non-naïve, activated lymphocytes) produce bi-phasic nucleoid-DNA digestion curves since the loop-DNA supercoiling is either absent or severely reduced. Nevertheless, in all nucleoid preparations treated with a limited amount of DNase I, there is a fraction of total DNA that is resistant to the enzyme by being embedded within the NM, such a DNA is easily identifiable in the digestion curves as the fraction that is digested very slowly so that the local slope becomes close to zero and remains like that even after very long incubation times (Fig. 2A and B).3.3. Mapping the relative position to the NM of DNA sequences along the genomic region containing the rat albumin locusOn the basis of the above considerations and results, we used the general strategy depicted in Fig. 3 in order to map the position relative to the NM of 15 small DNA sequences located along a region corresponding to 162 kb of chromosome 14 in the rat, which includes the loci of the following gene members of the albumin gene family: albumin (Alb), alpha-fetoprotein (Afp), afamin (Afm) and the pseudo-gene similar to Afp (Afp-L). Such small DNA sequences were spaced some 10 kb apart (Fig. 4). Therefore, nucleoids prepared from freshly isolated hepatocytes or naïve B-lymphocytes (Fig. 3A) were incubated with DNase I (0.5 U/ml) for different times so as to obtain nucleoid samples with differential amounts of DNA associated with the NM (Fig. 3B and C), and such samples with partially digested NM-bound DNA were used for PCR amplification of the chosen target sequences located along the 162-kb genomic region under study (Fig. 3A). By correlating the amplification data (Fig. 3A) with the kinetics of the nucleoid-DNA digestion (Fig. 3B), it is possible to locate each target sequence within a topological zone relative to the NM (Fig. 2). Previous studies have shown that the average size of the nuclear DNA fragments liberated by non-specific nucleases in rat hepatocytes is 0.8 kb.12 Thus, the DNA sequences to be mapped are <550 bp in length (Table 1), and so likely to be cut as whole units by the endonuclease instead of being progressively eroded by partial digestions. Therefore, in our mapping protocol, we score the specific templates as either present (amplifiable) or absent (non-amplifiable) as a function of endonuclease-digestion time (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S1). This was scored without considering the intensity of the amplicon signals, but just whether such signals are detected or not by an image-analysis program (Kodak 1D Image Analysis Software 3.5), using the default settings. We established these criteria because in our topological-mapping approach, it is the average relative position to the NM anchoring point and not the actual template length the critical parameter that determines the average sensitivity to DNase I of each sequence mapped. Nevertheless, the chosen amplicons were also selected on the basis that all of them may be amplified with similar efficiency using the same amplification program (see Section 2). Thus, the absence of amplified product at a given digestion time-point indicates that the relative abundance of the target template has fallen to a non-amplifiable level within the large nucleoid population analysed in each sample.6Procedure for mapping the position of DNA sequences relative to the NM.

Indeed, some general properties of MARs such as the presence of A-T tracts and repetitive sequences make them unsuitable for efficient PCR amplification under stringent conditions for achieving highly specific amplification of most other non-repetitive genomic sequences. Thus, primer-design programs will grant a low score to any set of primers targeting amplicons containing potential MARs, even more if such amplicons are meant to be highly specific and small-sized (=500 bp), as those targeted in the present protocol.3.4. Determination of the structural DNA loop organization in the region of the rat albumin locusBy coupling the highly reproducible amplification experiments (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S1), together with the consistent kinetics of loop DNA digestion by DNase I (Fig. 2), we were able to locate each mapped sequence within a given topological zone relative to the NM (Tables 2 and 3). Such data were used to draw the most likely DNA loop organization relative to the NM of the 162-kb region studied, by considering the distance (in kb) between the separate sequences mapped and the topological positions of such sequences relative to the NM. The data suggest that in the hepatocytes, the region is organized in five loops anchored to the NM (Fig. 6A). The resulting size from tip to base of such loops is not bigger than 20 kb; thus, the largest loop of the set, containing both Afp and Afm sequences, would be some 40 kb in length. The genomic region studied is a high-gene-density region. Through evolution, a series of duplications formed the genes within the Alb family that includes the vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) gene located almost 1 Mb upstream of the Alb gene.42 Nevertheless, such a gene family has been travelling as a cluster within the mammalian genomes. The fact that the region studied is organized into five rather compact structural DNA loops whose size (40–20 kb) is smaller than the estimated average rat-hepatocyte DNA loop size (80 kb) may be relevant to the functionality of such a genomic region, since fundamental processes of nuclear physiology occur at macromolecular complexes organized on the NM.17–19 It remains to be explored whether high-gene-density regions are usually organized into relatively small-sized structural DNA loops; at least another report suggests that such may be the case.26 However, despite the fact that the average DNA loop size in naïve B-lymphocytes is quite similar to that in hepatocytes (our unpublished results), in naïve B-lymphocytes the corresponding 162 kb region is very close to the NM as most sequences map within the VC topological region. Moreover, the target sequence h consistently maps to the DNase-resistant fraction of NM-bound DNA, and so it must be embedded within the NM. Only the l sequence remains proximal to the NM (Table 3 and Supplementary Fig. S1). This means that in naïve B-lymphocytes the 162-kb region is organized in numerous but tiny (<14 kb) DNA loops (Table 3 and Fig. 6B). This is quite interesting since the genes within the region studied are not known to be expressed in B-lymphocytes as it was confirmed by RT–PCR (data not shown), suggesting that packaging of genes in truly small DNA loops may be correlated with the stable transcriptional silencing of such genes (see below).Experimentally determined structural DNA loop organization of the 162-kb region containing members of the rat albumin gene family in hepatocytes (A) and naïve B-lymphocytes (B).

The illustration is according to scale in kb along the x and y axis.Location of the target sequences (amplicons) in the specific topological zones relative to the NM from rat hepatocytesThe amplicons were scored either as positive or as negative as a function of nuclease digestion time and for each topological zone relative to the NM, depending on whether or not they were detected by a digital image-analysis system (Kodak 1D Image Analysis Software 3.5) using the default settings.Location of the target sequences (amplicons) in the specific topological zones relative to the NM from rat hepatocytesThe amplicons were scored either as positive or as negative as a function of nuclease digestion time and for each topological zone relative to the NM, depending on whether or not they were detected by a digital image-analysis system (Kodak 1D Image Analysis Software 3.5) using the default settings.Location of the target sequences (amplicons) in the specific topological zones relative to the NM in naïve B-lymphocytesThe amplicons were scored either as positive or as negative as a function of nuclease digestion time and for each topological zone relative to the NM, depending on whether or not they were detected by a digital image-analysis system (Kodak 1D Image Analysis Software 3.5) using the default settings.Location of the target sequences (amplicons) in the specific topological zones relative to the NM in naïve B-lymphocytesThe amplicons were scored either as positive or as negative as a function of nuclease digestion time and for each topological zone relative to the NM, depending on whether or not they were detected by a digital image-analysis system (Kodak 1D Image Analysis Software 3.5) using the default settings.3.5. Predicted MARs in silico do not fully correspond to actual MARs in vivoWe used four different available computer programs for predicting the location of potential MARs along the 162-kb region studied. All these programs have been quoted as MAR-prediction or even as MAR-identifying devices in several published papers.27,28 However, each program uses different criteria so as to define the respective MAR-searching algorithms. This can be appreciated as not all programs coincide in their predictions (Table 4). Moreover, the mapping results in hepatocytes indicate that loop-DNA regions containing actual MARs (LARs) are located next to the following sequences mapped: a, d, h, k, m, o. However, only the region next to the d sequence is consistently identified as a MAR-containing region by the four programs, whereas the other experimentally defined LAR-containing regions are only partially identified by some of the four MAR-searching programs used and all programs predict rather inconsistently the presence of MARs in regions that according to the experimental results are unlikely to be bound to the NM in hepatocytes (Supplementary Fig. S2). The programs detect potential MARs close to most of the sequences mapped along the region studied, but even sequences such as b and c that lack any program-identified MAR nearby (Supplementary Fig. S2) are located very close to the NM in naïve B-lymphocytes, suggesting that there are actual MARs (LARs) that cannot be detected by any of the MAR-identifying programs. Only the sequence l that also lacks any program-identified MAR nearby is consistently far from the NM in naïve B-lymphocytes. These results suggest that MAR-finding programs are highly unreliable tools for actual MAR identification, a fact that has already been shown by others.28Location of potential MARs in the 162-kb genomic region studied as predicted by four different MAR-searching computer programsThe numbers indicate the nucleotide start and ending position number along the genomic region studied.

ConclusionsThe method described in this paper makes it possible to determine the organization in structural DNA loops of any long segment of genomic DNA with known sequence, provided that such a DNA is attached to the NM as is the case in nucleoid preparations of freshly isolated hepatocytes and naïve B-lymphocytes. The procedure used for isolating the nucleoids only preserves DNA–NM interactions that are resistant to high-salt extraction, therefore, facultative non-structural attachments to the NM that may result from some transient functional process such as active transcription are eliminated.43 Our method exploits the topological properties of naked DNA attached to the NM as well as elementary topological principles such as that points in a deformable string (DNA) can be positionally mapped relative to a position-reference invariant (NM), and from such mapping, it can be deduced the configuration of the string in third dimension. Moreover, both the intrinsic persistence length of mixed-sequence DNA, estimated at some 240 bp, and negative supercoiling confer relative rigidity to the naked DNA loops,36 thus limiting their deformability in such a way that the determined positions of loop-DNA sequences relative to the NM are highly reproducible among experiments, indicating limited fluctuation of the DNA loop morphology over time. Nevertheless, some sequences that happen to lie close to the boundary between two topological zones may display some variability in their relative position to the NM, such is the case of sequence e in hepatocytes that in one of four experiments it was detected in the proximal zone, whereas in three experiments it was only detectable in the distal zone relative to the NM (Fig. 5). It must be stressed that the presence of the corresponding amplicons in a given topological zone was determined by an image-analysis system using its default settings independently of the apparent intensity of the amplicon signal in the corresponding gel photograph. Thus, for example, in one of four experiments with hepatocytes, the k amplicon was barely apparent in the proximal region; nevertheless, it was consistently detected in such a region by the image-analysis software in the four separate experiments (Fig. 5).The present protocol works with NM-bound DNA templates and so the actual MARs (LARs) present in such preparations are deeply embedded within the NM, thus being poorly available to the action of any externally added enzyme. Most LAR-identifying protocols depend on the proteolytic destruction of the NM so as to liberate the NM-bound DNA fragments that may be further characterized by a number of techniques.22,24,26,30,44 Thus, our protocol addresses the problem of determining the configuration of structural DNA loops in a given, large enough genomic region without the need of mapping or characterizing the actual MARs (LARs) present in such a region as a precondition for determining the possible loop configuration. Nevertheless, our protocol delimits the genomic regions where such LARs are more likely to be found. Yet, pinpointing the actual extension of such LARs depends on applying further techniques beyond the present protocol. So far, there is only one published protocol that directly maps LARs on NM-bound DNA; this protocol depends on the activation of endogenous, NM-bound topoisomerase II that releases DNA loops by cutting along MARs embedded within the NM.23,45The in vivo, local spatial configuration of DNA into structural loops, as determined by the present protocol, constitutes the starting point for any further refinement or modification of such a configuration by chromatin proteins and epigenetic mechanisms affecting chromatin structure. However, chromatin as such plays no role in determining the structural DNA loop organization since chromatin proteins are completely eliminated by the high-salt extraction, and yet stable DNA–NM interactions persist. In any case, the organization of the genome into structural DNA loops must be highly relevant for the nuclear physiology. Indeed, current evidence suggest that the structural DNA loops may correspond to the actual replicons,5,6,19,39 yet the pattern of such structural loops may also determine the limits of further local structural changes that may be related to transient chromatin modifications resulting in functional interactions (related to transcription) between loop DNA and protein complexes located upon the NM.18,46,47 The genomic region studied contains classical examples of developmentally regulated genes. Indeed, Alb, Afp and Afm are primarily expressed in the liver, yet while Afp and Alb are highly expressed in the fetal liver, the transcription of Afp is rapidly reduced after birth, but Alb and Afm continue to be expressed in the adult liver.42,48 There are three enhancers in the intergenic region between Alb and Afp whose action is required for Afp and Alb activation early in liver development and for Afp reactivation during liver regeneration, yet later during fetal development Alb expression becomes independent of such enhancers due to the action of an Alb-specific enhancer that lies between 8.5 and 10 kb upstream the Alb transcription-start site.42,49 Interestingly, the intergenic enhancers are located in the region between the sequences corresponding to amplicons c and d48 which is clearly detached from the NM in the adult rat (Fig. 6A). We actually mapped the position relative to the NM of enhancer 1 (E1) which is located 2 kb upstream of sequence d that belongs to the Afp promoter region (Fig. 4). E1 mapped within the region proximal to the NM (data not shown) the same as d (Table 2). So far the Alb-specific enhancer has not been formally characterized in the rat. However, comparison of the mouse Alb-enhancer sequence indicates that a closely related sequence is present in the rat in a 1.3-kb region located 8.3 kb upstream of the Alb transcription-start site. Our results suggest the presence of a LAR some 5 kb upstream of sequence a that belongs to the Alb promoter (Figs 4 and 6A and Supplementary Fig. S2). Hence the putative rat Alb-enhancer is located some 2 kb upstream of the possible LAR and so the enhancer could be very close to the NM, although this needs to be experimentally verified.It is known that replication and transcription occur at factories organized upon the NM.18,50 However, replication and transcription factories never co-localize since they occupy distinct but rather fixed sites that are conserved throughout several cell generations.17,51,52 In mammalian lymphocytes it is known that genes separated by tens of mega-bases in cis and genes that belong to separate chromosomes somehow migrate to preassembled transcription factories for their actual transcription.50,53 Such a process requires that the genes undergoing active transcription loop out away from their respective chromosome territories so that distant genomic regions are brought together within one nuclear complex for transcription.54 Hence the fact that in naïve B-lymphocytes the genomic region studied is very close to the NM, suggests that the genes present in the region are prevented from looping out towards a transcription factory, since the genes are included into numerous tiny loops tightly bound to the NM (Fig. 6B).The high-salt-resistant LARs that determine structural attachments to the NM constitute long-term interactions between DNA and the NM. Nevertheless, as predicted by some models, there is evidence that under the influence of a combination of mechanical, biochemical and thermodynamical factors the pattern of such attachments may be modified during development and aging leading to stable changes in cell differentiation.10,13,55,56 Varied and important evidence suggests that the high-salt resistant structural DNA loops correspond to the actual replicons in vivo.5,19 Thus it is remarkable that in totipotent blastomeres the cell cycle consists of overlapping S and M phases with no G1 or G2, the rapid DNA replication observed involves the use of high numbers of closely spaced attachments between DNA and the NM and so the average DNA loops are very small, yet this is compatible with very active DNA replication but not with active transcription as genes in the chromosomes of blastomeres are largely inactive during cleavage.57 Therefore in naïve B-lymphocytes the presence of tiny loops in the region studied may contribute to the transcriptional silencing of the corresponding genes without preventing such a region from being replicated after B-lymphocyte activation.The nucleotype has been defined as those characters of nuclear DNA that may affect the phenotype independently of the information encoded in such a DNA,58 and it has been suggested that besides species-specific nucleotypic characters such as karyotype, and the C-value for nuclear DNA that correlates with overall cell-cycle length, there could be tissue-specific nucleotypic characters, such as the pattern of structural DNA loops, that correlate with cell differentiation.10 Our results support the existence of such tissue specific nucleotypic characters.Supplementary DataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was sponsored by CONACYT, Mexico, grant 48447-Q (25506) and UAEM, Mexico, grant 2212/2006, both awarded to A.A.-A.

B510. Strain B510 is an endophytic bacterium isolated from stems of rice plants (Oryza sativa cv. Nipponbare). The genome of B510 consisted of a single chromosome (3 311 395 bp) and six plasmids, designated as pAB510a (1 455 109 bp), pAB510b (723 779 bp), pAB510c (681 723 bp), pAB510d (628 837 bp), pAB510e (537 299 bp), and pAB510f (261 596 bp). The chromosome bears 2893 potential protein-encoding genes, two sets of rRNA gene clusters (rrns), and 45 tRNA genes representing 37 tRNA species. The genomes of the six plasmids contained a total of 3416 protein-encoding genes, seven sets of rrns, and 34 tRNAs representing 19 tRNA species. Eight genes for plasmid-specific tRNA species are located on either pAB510a or pAB510d. Two out of eight genomic islands are inserted in the plasmids, pAB510b and pAB510e, and one of the islands is inserted into trnfM-CAU in the rrn located on pAB510e. Genes other than the nif gene cluster that are involved in N2 fixation and are homologues of Bradyrhizobium japonicum USDA110 include fixABCX, fixNOQP, fixHIS, fixG, and fixLJK. Three putative plant hormone-related genes encoding tryptophan 2-monooxytenase (iaaM) and indole-3-acetaldehyde hydrolase (iaaH), which are involved in IAA biosynthesis, and ACC deaminase (acdS), which reduces ethylene levels, were identified. Multiple gene-clusters for tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic-transport systems and a diverse set of malic enzymes were identified, suggesting that B510 utilizes C4-dicarboxylate during its symbiotic relationship with the host plant.1. IntroductionEndophytes are microorganisms that are able to colonize the intercellular, and sometimes also intracellular, spaces of plant tissues, without causing apparent damage to the host plant. Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial endophytes have been isolated from several tissues in numerous plant species.1,2 Many endophytes have beneficial effects on plant growth and health.3–5 N2-fixing bacterial endophytes, such as Herbaspirillum seropedicae, Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus, and Azoarcus sp., have been found within the tissues of some crops and grasses, and partially contribute to the nitrogen requirement of the host plants.6Azoarcus sp. strain BH72, isolated from the salt marsh plant kallar grass, is best studied in terms of the molecular mechanisms of establishment inside plants and endophyte functions.7Krause et al.8 reported the first full genome sequence of an endophyte, strain BH72 of Azoarcus species (4.38 Mb), and this sequence provided valuable insights into the life of bacterial endophytes, including information about interactions with host plants. Fouts et al.9 also reported the whole genome sequence of a N2-fixing endophyte, Klebsiella pneumoniae 342. Comparative genomics of naturally occurring bacterial endophytes provides information that can be used to develop enhanced bacterial endophytes.10The genus Azospirillum consists of spirillum-shaped, N2-fixing, Gram-negative alpha-proteobacteria that often live in the plant rhizosphere.11 Since Azospirillum inoculation promotes plant growth, agronomic applications of this genus have been developed.12Azospirillum sp. B510 was isolated on 23 August 1999 from the surface-sterilized stems of rice plants (Oryza sativa cv. Nipponbare) that were cultivated in the Kashimadai experimental paddy field of Tohoku University (Miyagi, Japan).13 The B510 strain is closely related to A. oryzae COC8, which was reported as a paddy soil bacterium (with 97.7% identity in their 16S rRNA gene sequences),14 and B510 is classified in the same cluster of the phylogenetic tree as A. oryzae COC8 (Supplementary Fig. S1). In addition to being a diazotroph under free-living conditions, B510 was found to have positive motility, and to be capable of degrading plant cell walls.13 Inoculation with Azospirillum sp. B510 was shown to promote plant growth under both laboratory and field conditions (Isawa et al., unpublished results). Specifically, the field experiment in a field in Hokkaido, Japan, indicated that B510 inoculation increases stem number resulting in an increase in seed yield (Isawa et al., unpublished results). Moreover, B510 inoculation enhanced disease resistance to virulent rice blast fungus and the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae.15 Thus, Azospirillum sp. B510 is likely a beneficial bacterium with agronomic applications.In this study, we demonstrated the endophytic characteristics of Azospirillum sp. B510 and its ability to fix N2in planta. Then, we determined the complete nucleotide sequence of the Azospirillum sp. B510 genome and deduced the gene repertoire in the genome. This is the first report of the genome structure of the genus Azospirillum.2. Materials and methods2.1. A bacterial strain, inoculation of rice plants, and estimation of N2 fixation ability and of the internal Azospirillum sp. B510 populationAzospirillum sp. B510 is a diazotrophic endophyte that was isolated from the stem of cultivated rice, O. sativa cv. Nipponbare.13 Bacteria were cultured in Nutrient Broth (Difco, Detroit, MI, USA), collected by centrifugation at 5000g for 3 min, and washed twice with sterile saline (0.85% w/v NaCl). The bacterial cell suspension was adjusted to 2 × 107 cells ml-1 in saline solution just before inoculation.16The hulls of rice seeds were carefully removed using forceps. After the hulled seeds were shaken in 10% (w/v) Ca(OCl)2 for 30 min at 28°C, they were washed more than three times with sterile distilled water. A surface-sterilized seed was placed in a sterilized test tube (16.5 mm in diameter, 150 mm in height) containing 9 ml of 0.325% (w/v) semi-solid agar solution with the sterilized inorganic nutrients,13,17 and the tube was covered with an aluminium cap. Each seed was inoculated with a bacterial cell suspension of 1 × 107 cells. The rice plants were cultivated at 25°C under long-day conditions (16-h light and 8-h dark) for 10 days in a plant growth cabinet (LH300; NK Systems Co. Ltd, Osaka, Japan) that provided 65 mmol photons m-2 s-1 of photosynthetically active radiation.18To estimate N2-fixing activity, acetylene was introduced into test tubes, each containing a 10-day-old rice seedling, and the tubes were enclosed with a sterilized rubber stopper. After a 24-h incubation period, the ethylene concentration was determined by gas chromatography as described previously.13 Internal populations of inoculated bacteria inside rice tissues were estimated as follows. The 10-day-old rice seedlings were sampled from the test tubes. After the seed parts of the seedlings were removed using forceps, the remaining parts of the seedlings were weighed. The parts of seedlings were dipped in 70% (v/v) ethanol and then immersed in 1% NaOCl solution for 30 s. They were then quickly washed three times with sterilized distilled water and then once with sterilized saline solution. After the surface-sterilized plants were aseptically macerated in 1 ml of saline solution using a mortar and pestle, the macerates were serially diluted with saline solution and plated on Nutrient Agar (Difco) plates. After incubation at 30°C for 7 days, colony forming units (CFUs) were determined based on the fresh weight of the rice plants. Simultaneously, uninoculated plants were grown and subjected to CFU determination, as a negative control.2.2. Genome sequencingTotal cellular DNA was purified according to standard procedures, and three genomic libraries, based on two types of cloning vectors, were constructed for sequencing. The IB5100/1 library contained inserts of ~3.0 kb cloned into pUC118 (Takara Bio Inc., Japan), the IB5102/3 library contained inserts of ~4.5 kb cloned into pUC118, and the IB510b library contained inserts with an average size of 58 kb cloned into a BAC vector, pCC1BAC (Epicentre Bio., USA).Genome sequencing was performed using the whole-genome shotgun method in combination with BAC end-sequencing. The nucleotide sequences of both ends of the clones from the IB5100/1, IB5102/3, and IB510b libraries were analysed using a Dye-terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit and the 3730XL Sequencer (Applied Biosystems, USA). The end-sequence data from the BAC clones facilitated the gap-closure process and provided the scaffolding for reconstruction of the sequence of the entire genome. We filled the remaining gaps in the sequence by primer walking, using the plasmids or the BAC clones as templates. The integrity of the reconstructed genome sequence was assessed by chromosome walking using the end sequences of the BAC clones.2.3. Gene assignment, annotation, and information analysesRNA- and protein-encoding regions were assigned by a combination of computer prediction and similarity searches, as described previously.19Genes for structural RNAs were identified by similarity searches against an in-house structural RNA database that had been constructed based on data available in GenBank (rel.167). tmRNA-, tRNA-, and rRNA-encoding regions were predicted using the ARAGORN 1.2.20 program,20 the tRNA scan-SE 1.23 program,21 and the RNAmmer ver.1.2S program,22 respectively, in combination with similarity searches.The prediction of protein-encoding regions was carried out with the Glimmer 2.13 prediction program.23 Prior to prediction, a matrix was generated for the B510 genome by training with a data set of 610 open-reading frames that showed a high degree of sequence similarity to a translated gene set registered as the genomic data for both Magnetospirillum magneticum AMB-1 (accession number AP007255) and Rhodospirillum rubrum ATCC 11170 (CP000230), which are bacteria closely related to Azospirillum species.24 All the predicted protein-encoding regions of 150 bp or more were translated into amino acid sequences, which were then subjected to similarity searches against the non-redundant (nr) protein database from NCBI (GenBank database rel. 167.0) using the BLASTP program.25 In parallel, all the predicted intergenic sequences were compared with sequences in the nr database using the BLASTX program to identify genes that were not detected by the prediction process. For predicted genes that did not show sequence similarity to known genes, only those equal to or longer than 150 bp were considered candidates.To annotate the functions of the assigned genes, the KAAS system, which is based on bi-directional best-hit information from sequence similarity against the KEEG GENES database and on heuristics, was first applied to all predicted protein-encoding genes.26 Next, the group escaped from KAAS was deduced based on the sequence similarity of their translated protein products to those of genes of known function and to the protein motifs in the InterPro database (ver. 17.0).27 A BLAST score of 10-5 was considered significant. Assignment of Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins (COGs) of predicted gene products was carried out by BLASTP analysis against the COG reference data set (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/COG/).28 A BLAST E-value of less than 10-10 was considered significant. After filtering, COG assignments of the putative gene products were generated according to COG identification, using the best-hit pair in the reference data set.Comparison between two genomic nucleotide sequences was performed using GenomeMatcher V.1.270.29 The GC-skew analysis was performed as described by Lobry.30Phage_Finder ver. 4.6 was used to detect the prophage region inserted into the B510 genome.31The FtsK Orienting Polar Sequences (KOPS) motif is specifically oriented toward the replication terminus of the genomic sequences in alpha-proteobacteria.32 The cumulative distribution of the KOPS sequence patterns (GGGNAGGG) was calculated along each replicon of B510, and the distribution of these patterns in the genome was plotted. Multicopy DNA elements of longer than 500 bp that have the capacity to encode a putative transposase were identified as insertion sequences (ISs), using the BLAST2 program, and then classified using RECON1.0533 and the IS finder (www-is.biotoul.fr).3. Results and discussion3.1. Colonization and N2 fixation in rice plantsThe internal population of B510 was evaluated using surface-sterilized rice seedlings and the plate counting method. We calculated that there were 1.5–5.7 × 104 CFU g-1 fresh weight of inoculated seedlings. In contrast, no colonies were detected in uninoculated rice plants. These data indicate that B510 cells colonized internal rice tissues, although the colonization level was lower than that reported for other endophytes, including Herbaspirillum sp. B501 (~106 CFU g-1 fresh weight).13,34 Indeed, Yasuda et al.15 also observed colonization of Azospirillum sp. B510 around the basal parts of shoots of cv. Nipponbare using gusA-tagged B510.To evaluate the in planta N2-fixing activity of Azospirillum sp. B510, acetylene reduction activity was assayed using rice seedlings inoculated or not with the bacterium. In the presence of acetylene, the seedlings inoculated with Azospirillum sp. B510 showed marked acetylene reduction activity compared with the activity in uninoculated plants and in plants inoculated in air (control) (Supplementary Table S1). Acetylene reduction activity of Azospirillum sp. B510 in planta (43 nmol h-1 g-1 fresh weight) was similar to that of Herbaspirillum sp. B501 (67 nmol h-1 g-1 fresh weight), a well-characterized N2-fixing endophyte isolated from rice plants.13,17,343.2. Sequencing and structural features of the genomeThe nucleotide sequence of the entire B510 genome was deduced initially by assembling a total of 66 554 sequence files, which corresponded to approximately six genome equivalents, according to the method described in the Materials and methods section. To ensure that the nucleotide sequence was sufficiently accurate for further analysis of gene structure and function, finishing was carried out by visually editing the draft sequences and by additional sequencing to close the gaps. The genome of B510 consists of a single chromosome and six circular plasmids designated as pAB510a, pAB510b, pAB510c, pAB510d, pAB510e, and pAB510f. The total size of the genome is 7 599 738 bp, and the average GC content is 67.6%. The size and the percentage of GC content of each replicon are summarized in Table 1. The integrity of 99.9% of the final genome sequence was assessed by comparing the insert length of anchored BAC clones with the computed distance between the end sequences of the clones. The integrity of the remaining region (334 299–341 799 nt on the chromosome) where no BAC clone was anchored was confirmed using the sequence and insert length information of the plasmid clones.Features of replicons in Azospirillum sp.

Nucleotide positions for the plasmids were assigned based on the predicted translational initiation site of AZLa11310 in pAB510a, AZLb06310 in pAB510b, AZLc05330 in pAB510c, AZLe04150 in pAB510e, AZLf01870 in pAB510f, and the termination of AZLd05190 in pAB510d, respectively.Ten Azospirillum species have been examined for their genome composition, using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.35 Multiple replicons were identified in 10 Azospirillum species as with B510. However, the chromosome size of each Azospirillum strain (<2.7 Mb) was smaller than one of B510 (3.3 Mb). Linear plasmids were detected in several Azospirillum strains, such as A. brasilense and A. lipoferum,35 but similar structural units were not found in the B510 genome.3.3. Structural features of the genomeA GC-skew analysis was performed to locate the probable origin of DNA replication. We established that the shift of GC-skew values occurred in two regions of the chromosome, at coordinates 35 and 1710 kb, as shown in Fig. 1 (the innermost circle). The hemE locus, which is known to associate with the origins of replication in alpha-proteobacteria,36 was found to be adjacent to the shift point of the GC skew. A cluster of nine genes, rho–hypothetical–hemH–hemE–hypothetical–maf–aroE–coaE–dnaQ (AZL028900–AZL028930–AZL000010– AZL000050: these codes are hereinafter defined in the Protein-encoding genes section), occurring at ~0 kb on the B510 chromosome (Supplementary Fig. S2) was commonly found in the Magnetospirillum sp. AMB-1 genome.37parA (AZL000140) and parB (AZL000150) were found downstream of dnaQ (AZL000050; Supplementary Fig. S2). These findings strongly suggest that the ori region of the chromosome is located between AZL028930 and AZL000010. This location of the ori is also supported by the KOPS motif distribution analysis (Supplementary Fig. S3).Schematic representation of seven circular replicons in the Azospirillum sp. B510 genome.

The innermost and second circles from the centre show the GC-skew values (yellow and purple) and the average GC percent (blue and red), respectively, calculated using a window-size of 10 kb. The scales for GC percent are presented on the second circles. Top and bottom of each scale are shown, as follows: 73.9/58.9% in the chromosome, 74.6/57.0% in pAB510a, 72.5/60.7% in pAB510b, 72.0/60.2% in pAB510c, 74.9/48.3% in pAB510d, 71.9/59.0% in pAB510e, and 71.1/52.7% in pAB510f.The shift of the GC skew was clearly observed for two of the six plasmids, pAB510a and pAB510d (Fig. 1). The predicted origins of both of these plasmids were located at around 0 kb. The KOPS motif distribution analysis also indicates that these regions are the origins of replication (Supplementary Fig. S3). These regions accommodate repA-parAB genes (AZLa00020, AZLa00030, AZLa00040) in pAB510a and repB (AZLd00010) in pAB510d. However, no repC candidate was found in the B510 genome, suggesting that the two B510 plasmids, which contain typical origin of replication regions, may have distinct, unknown initiators of replication.ISs are small mobile DNA elements capable of transposition via a self-encoded transposase and can be classified into various families based on their structure.38 Two-hundred and eighty IS copies were assigned in all seven replication units of the B510 genome. On the basis of the type of transposase present, these ISs could be classified into 29 groups of 12 families (www-is.biotoul.fr; Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). As shown in Fig. 1, they are rather evenly distributed among the replicons, although there are several regions where a disproportionate number of ISs are located within the replicon. The remarkable frequency of ISs was occurred in pAB510f, in which a 33-kb region corresponding to 12.6% of the replicon is occupied by 30 ISs classified into 19 groups.It is remarkable that 27 out of 280 ISs were located from 3164 to 3208 kb, between CRISPER-like sequences (described later) and one of the rRNA gene clusters on the chromosome (Fig. 1). Thirty-one ISs classified into 18 groups were also found between 80 and 157 kb on pAB510b (Fig. 1). The partial segments (AZL027610 and AZLb01330) of a gene similar to recombinase were identified at both ends of the above-mentioned high-density IS regions. This feature suggests that these regions may behave as a single large mobile genetic element.The Phage_Finder program detected two independent putative prophages with their putative att sites at coordinates 915901–982641 (B510PP01) and 2490727–2522517 (B510PP02) on the Azospirillum sp. B510 chromosome (Fig. 1). The predicted sequences of att sites were assigned as 11 bases long (CAAGGCCGCCG) at both termini of B510PP01 and 12 bases (GCTGGGCGGCGGC) in B510PP02. The attL sites of these putative prophages (B510PP01 and B510PP02) were located near the potential genes encoding integrases AZL008670 and AZL022160, respectively. Moreover, a recombinase homologue (AZL008660) was found upstream of the AZL008670 integrase of B510PP01. Both B510PP01 and B510PP02 contained terminases (AZL008420 and AZL022110), capsid proteins (AZL008390, AZL008410, and AZL022100), and tail proteins (AZL008340 and AZL022050). These genetic traits found in two regions, B510PP01 and B510PP02, are characteristic of a horizontally transferred element.A putative duplicated sequence of the B510PP01 prophage (at coordinates 915901–982641) was identified at coordinates 2296582–2356862 on the chromosome (Fig. 1). A detailed comparison between these two regions showed that this phage-like element lacked regions corresponding to both termini, namely a 4.8-kb region on the attL side that includes the integrase gene (AZL008670), and a 1.7-kb region on the attR side. The presence of this putative cryptic phage with deletions may indicate that the B510 cell was subjected to multiple infection events during the course of evolution.The release of phage particles from B510 cells is induced by mitomycin C treatment.39 The DNA in the released phage was estimated to be ~10 kb in size. In the present study, however, we could not find a prophage-like region of this size in the entire B510 genome. A possible explanation for this is that diverse prophages in the genome were overlooked during the computer identification.A search of the genome sequence by GenomeMatcher (ver.1.282) detected a large number of copies of short sequences at the coordinates 3158606–3163849 on the chromosome (Supplementary Fig. S4A and B). This region exhibited a structure typical of CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeat) systems and is composed of 70 different spacers (36–42 bp), an identical repeat element (37 bp) containing an 8-bp palindrome (5'-CCTGGGCG), and cas genes encoding CRISPR-associated proteins (Supplementary Figs S4C and S5).40 When the whole genome sequence of B510 was subjected to CRISPRFinder (http://crispr.u-psud.fr/crispr), four additional CRISPR-like regions without complete cas genes were found exclusively at the coordinates 1016560–1018180, 1178059–1178606, 3035919–3038413, and 3199247–3200867 on the chromosome. Recently, it was reported that CRISPRs act as an antiphage defense system; bacteria integrate new spacers that are derived from phage genomic sequences during CRISPR-mediated phage resistance.40,41Genomic islands are regions that form syntenic groups consisting of multiple accessory genes, and they are inserted into the genome through horizontal transfer.42 They are often inserted into tRNA genes in various bacterial genomes.42 Duplicated portions of tRNA genes, which are a typical feature of genomic islands, were found at eight locations in the B510 genome (Table 1). These duplicated portions were separated from the corresponding genes by DNA segments ranging in size from 6.7 to 71 kb (B510GI01-06, d7, e8; Supplementary Table S4). This suggests that genomic islands were inserted into the tRNA genes of the B510 genome. ‘Supplementary Table S4’ summarizes the species of tRNA genes, their positions, the length of duplications, and the DNA regions that separate the perfect or near-perfect duplicated tRNA gene segments, which are 20–48 bp long. The presumptive genomic islands varied in size and contained putative genes for an integrase or a site-specific recombinase at one of their termini (Supplementary Table S4). The GC content of these elements (53–67%) was lower than the average GC content of the chromosome (67.8%). As this type of nucleotide bias is a general feature of genomic islands,42 the lower GC content of the presumptive genomic islands strongly suggests the horizontal origin of these elements.3.4. Aspects of predicted genes and their organizationA total of 79 tRNA genes, representing 45 tRNA species, were identified (Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. S6 and Table S5). These tRNA genes were dispersed throughout the genome, but did not occur in pAB510f (Table 1). Among them, 37 tRNA genes are likely to be transcribed as a single unit, whereas 20 (representing trnA-UGC, trnI-GAU, and trnfM-CAU) are likely to form a common transcriptional unit consisting of eight rRNA gene clusters, and the remaining 22 are tandemly arranged into nine clusters (Supplementary Table S6). Duplicated gene sets for trnK, trnT, trnP, and trnE were arrayed in pairs as complete copies. Thirty-four of the 79 tRNA genes are encoded by plasmids (Table 1). They were classified into 19 tRNA species, eight of which are specific to pAB510a or pAB510d (Supplementary Table S5), indicating that these plasmids are essential.Nine rrns with a form of 16S-trnA-trnI-23S-5S were assigned in the genome, two of which are on the chromosome (rrn1 and rrn2) and seven on the plasmids (rrn3, rrn4, rrn5, rrn6, rrn7, rrn8, and rrn9) (Supplementary Fig. S2). The presence of nine rrns shows not to be typical copy number as alpha-proteobacteria genome, because alpha-proteobacteria generally possess five or less copies of rrn, whereas gamma-proteobacteria and firmicutes possess nine or more copies (http://ribosome.mmg.msu.edu/rrndb/).43Of the five rrn-gene clusters, four (rrn2, rrn3, rrn6, and rrn9) were followed by trnfM (Supplementary Fig. S7). A genome island (B510GIe8) was inserted in trnfM in rrn3 located on pAB510e. One of the clusters lacking trnfM (rrn5) had a deletion of 522 nucleotides long, containing trnA and trnI, as well as a truncation of the 3' region that encoded the 5S rRNA in addition to trnfM (Supplementary Fig. S7).A gene-encoding transfer-messenger RNA (ssrA: AZLr028), which is known to be involved in the degradation of aberrantly synthesized proteins, was found in the B510 genome. Putative genes for two types of small RNAs, the B subunit of RNase P (rnpB: AZLr029), and the signal recognition particle (SRP) RNA (ffs: AZLr040) were also identified in the B510 genome (Supplementary Fig. S2).The potential protein-encoding regions were assigned using a combination of computer prediction using the Glimmer program and a similarity search, as described in the Materials and methods section. By taking into account sequence similarity to known genes and relative position of predicted encoding region, to avoid overlaps, the total number of putative protein-encoding genes assigned to the genome was 6309 (Table 1). The average gene density was estimated as being one gene in every 1205 bp. The putative protein-encoding genes that start with ATG, GTG, TTG, or ATT codons were denoted by a serial number with the prefix ‘AZL’, representing the previous species name of this bacterium, Azospirillum lipoferum. It should be noted that the putative gene assignment used in this paper represents coding potential based on a defined set of assumptions.We assigned functions to the 6309 potential protein-encoding genes by performing similarity searches, as described in the Materials and methods section. Seventy-five percent (4750) of the genes exhibited sequence similarity to genes of known function, and 25% (1559) showed sequence similarity to hypothetical genes.We generated COG assignments of the translated gene products by conducting a BLASTP search against the COG reference data set. A total of 4718 putative gene products were classified into 23 COG categories, excluding gene products of unknown function, as shown in Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. S2.3.5. Characteristic features of the protein-encoding genesB510 is a bacterium capable of performing N2 fixation in a modified Rennie semi-solid medium.13 Furthermore, we demonstrated its ability to fix N2in planta in this study (see the Colonization and N2 fixation in rice plants section). The genes encoding the nitrogenase core and assembly proteins were separately clustered in three loci on the B510 chromosome. These three gene clusters were arranged in nifA [1 gene]–nifB [3 genes]–nifZ [1 gene]–nifST (AZL022440–AZL022530), nifWV [1 gene]–nifSU (AZL006520–AZL006560), and nifHDK [2 genes]–nifENX (AZL007710–AZL007640; Fig. 2A). nifQ (AZL010780) was located at a distance from above other nif gene clusters. The fixABCX (AZL006470–AZL006500) cluster, which encoded components participating in the transport of electrons to nitrogenase,44,45 was adjacent to the nifWVSU cluster and in an opposite orientation (Fig. 2A). Not all of the major components of N2 fixation were encoded by genes on the chromosome; AZLc04520, which is a homologue of nifJ encoding pyruvate–flavodoxin oxidoreductase, was solely found on the pAB510c plasmid. However, considering that a homologue of nifF, which encodes flavodoxin, an electron donor of NifJ, was not found in the B510 genome, AZLc04520 may not be involved in the major pathway for electron transfer to nitrogenase in B510.Schematic diagram of the N2-fixation gene clusters from Azospirillum sp.

A box with a yellow border indicates that the gene cluster is located on the plasmid.The structures of the three nif/fix gene clusters in B510 were mostly conserved with those of Bradyrhizobium sp. ORS278, which forms nodules on stems of aquatic legumes (Fig. 2A).46 However, B510 has the following distinctive features: the inversion of fixABCX, the insertion of two other predicted genes (AZL007670 and AZL007680) into a region between nifHDK and nifENX, and the transposition of nifQ from these clusters (Fig. 2A). These features may reflect the high frequency of genome rearrangements in B510.Cytochrome c terminal oxidase is an enzyme essential for N2 fixation in rhizobial species.47 The oxidase components and the cation pump that is involved in oxidase activity are encoded in rhizobia by fixNOQP and fixGHIS, respectively. These gene clusters were located in tandem on the chromosome of B510 (AZL003350–AZL003410), although fixG was missing from the gene cluster (Fig. 2B). These gene clusters were located upstream of the fixK homologue (AZL003420: a probable transcriptional regulator). The fixG genes were present in triplicate and located at distinct positions on the chromosome (AZL016980), pAB510b (AZLb04870), and pAB510e (AZLe02910). Cytochrome c terminal oxidase is partially responsible for the N2-fixing capacity during microaerobic respiration in A. brasilense.48 It is possible that cytochrome c terminal oxidase plays a similar role in B510, although the N2-fixing capacity of B510 during microaerobic respiration has not yet been investigated.A two-component regulatory system, fixLJ, is required to activate the expression of the nifA and fixK regulators of N2 fixation in rhizobia.49 We identified a gene cluster in pAB510b that included fixLJK (AZLb06310, AZLb06300, and AZLb06280; Fig. 2B). The domain organization of FixL (AZLb06310) in B510 was more similar to that of Bradyrhizobium japonicum (bll2760) than to that of Sinorhizobium meliloti (SMa1229).50 The genome structures of two diazotrophic endophytes, Azoarcus sp. BH72 and K. pneumoniae Kp342, have been reported,8,9 and the gene clusters encoding nitrogenase components in these genomes did not contain fixL. These findings suggest that the mechanism of N2 fixation in B510 is similar to that in rhizobia and differs from that in two diverse endophytes, Azoarcus sp. BH72 and K. pneumoniae Kp342.Plant-associated bacteria, such as endophytes and rhizosphere bacteria, often produce plant hormones or modulate their functions by producing inhibitors for phytohormone biosynthesis.51 In particular, the modulation of plant ethylene levels by bacterial 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase interferes with the physiological functions of the host plant.51,52 B510 possesses the acdS gene (AZLb04170), which encodes ACC deaminase, and the acdR gene (AZLb04180: leucine-responsible regulatory protein; LRP), which regulates the expression of acdS via its putative LRP binding site, on the pAB510b plasmid (Supplementary Fig. S8).53,54 It is possible that B510 produces ACC deaminase in response to plants, which then reduces the level of ethylene in plants, and which might promote plant growth and alleviate signs of environmental stress.51,55 The acdS gene was not present in the previously reported genomes of Azoarcus sp. BH72 and K. pneumoniae Kp342.8,9Biosynthesis of indole-3-actic acid (IAA) is widespread among plant-associated bacteria and has a beneficial impact on plant growth.56 In azospirilla and enterobacteria, IAA is generally synthesized from tryptophan via indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPyA). A key gene in this process is ipdC, which encodes indole-3-pyruvate decarboxylase (IPDC). No ipdC homologue was found in the B510 genome, irrespective of the presence of ipdC in the genome of the endophyte K. pneumoniae Kp342 (GKROPF_B2055)9 and an IAA-inducible ipdC gene in rhizosphere bacterium A. brasilense.57 We could not find an iaaC homologue in B510 either, even though the iaaC gene is co-transcribed with the ipdC gene in A. brasilense.57 Nevertheless, another pathway for IAA biosynthesis could exist in B510. The IAA biosynthetic pathway catalyses the decarboxylation of tryptophan into indole-3-actamide (IAM) and the hydrolysis of IAM to produce IAA. In Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Pseudomonas syringae, the iaaM and iaaH genes are known to be involved in these steps.56 In B510, AZLb03560 and AZLb03580 were assigned as candidates for these genes that participate in the IAM pathway.Transporters play indispensable roles in various cellular processes including the delivery of nutrients, elimination of waste products, and adaptation to environmental conditions. A variety of transporters are also thought to be involved in the symbiotic exchange of nutrients between host plant cells and intracellular rhizobia in symbiosis.We identified a total of 354 possible transporters based on sequence similarity to known transporters and an InterPro search.58 These genes were subsequently classified into 62 families according to the transporter classification system used in Transport Classification Database (http://www.tcdb.org/).59 The gene composition of genes in these gene families in B510 is more similar to those in rhizobial species than in two other N2-fixing endophytes, Azoarcus sp. BH72 and K. pneumoniae Kp342 (Supplementary Table S7). Two of the families identified, the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily and the major facilitator superfamily (MFS), were composed of a large number of paralogs (141 and 57, respectively) that accounted for a significant portion of the transporter genes in the B510 genome. Although this feature is common among the rhizobia and the endophyte, there are significantly more ABC and MFS genes in B510 genome than in Azoarcus sp. BH72 (Supplementary Table S7). Moreover, members of the TC families, which include the Monovalent Cation (K+ or Na+):Proton Antiporter-3 (CPA3) family and the Tricarboxylate Transporter (TTT) Family (Supplementary Table S7), were found in B510 and rhizobia, but not in the Azoarcus sp. BH72 genome.TonB-dependent outer-membrane proteins, which are responsible for the specific uptake of ferric-siderophore complexes, are crucial for the perception of environmental signals and are associated with plant pathogens.60 Strain B510 possesses one set of tonB/exbB/exbD accompanied with anti-sigma and ECF sigma factor genes on pAB510d (Supplementary Table S8).60 In contrast, B510 carried nine genes encoding TonB-dependent outer-membrane proteins on three replicons, pAB510d, the chromosome, and pAB510a (Supplementary Table S8). The number of iron transport proteins in the B510 genome was not as high as that in other N2-fixing endophytes, such as Azoarcus sp. BH72 (22 genes), or in the rhizosphere bacterium, Pseudomonas fluorescens pf5 (45 genes). A homology search suggested that putative receptors for ferrioxamine, vitamin B12, hemin, and heme exist in B510. Because strain B510 produces siderophore (Kawaharada et al., unpublished results), the iron transport systems of B510 may be active in the bacterium in free-living and endophytic environments.A C4-dicarboxylate, such as malate, is considered to be the major energy and carbon source of Rhizobium during symbiosis with host plants. The transport systems and metabolic enzymes of C4-dicarboxylates in Rhizobium are essential for their symbioses. With regard to the transport of carbon from the source to B510 during symbiosis, we identified five complete sets of gene cluster composed of three genes encoding the tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic-transport (TRAP-T) system (TC# 2.A.56) that transports C4-dicarboxylate (Supplementary Table S9). One of the gene cluster for TRAP-T system, AZLa08570, AZLa08580, and AZLa08600, is located upstream of a gene cluster containing citrate lyase subunits (AZLa08510, AZLa08500, AZLa08490, and AZLa08480) and a gene for malic enzyme (AZLa08520). Since citrate lyase works in citrate metabolic pathway under anoxic conditions in K. pneumoniae and Escherichia coli, it might allow B510 growing utilizing citrate as the energy source in planta. Malic enzymes are responsible for the respiratory metabolism in the N2 fixation as occurs during rhizobial symbiotic relationships with plants.61 The genome sequence of B510 revealed the presence of three genes encoding malic enzymes (AZL000200, AZLa05660, and AZLa08520). In a phylogeny, including genes from rhizobia and other endophytes, plasmid-encoding AZLa05660 and AZLa08520 are classified in a group that includes DME (NAD+-dependent malic enzyme), and AZL000200 is in a cluster harbouring TME (NADP+-dependent malic enzyme; Supplementary Fig. S9). Consequently, these findings suggest that a system for uptake and metabolism of C4 dicarboxylic acids exists in B510, as is the case in rhizobia, and this system may contribute a part of the carbon utilizations during the symbiosis.The B510 genome harboured a gene cluster with significant sequence similarity to that encoding the type IV secretion system (T4SS). Within this cluster was a gene encoding a putative coupling protein TraG/VirD4 (AZL011550), followed by the genes encoding components of secretion machinery TrbB/VirB11, TrbE/ViB4, TrbL/VirB6, TrbG/VirB9, and TrbI/VirB10 (AZL011560, AZL011580, AZL011600, AZL011620, and AZL011630, respectively). It is likely that this region is part of a genomic island, since an integrase gene (AZL011700) is coded in a region adjacent to this cluster; however, tRNA gene sequences were not detected in the border regions. The absence of genes encoding the other necessary components of T4SS might suggest that the genes in the cluster are not functional, but are remnants of genomic rearrangements. Alternatively, it is possible that there are functional homologues with less sequence similarity to prototypical T4SS proteins in the B510 genome.62Plant phytochromes are one of the photoreceptors that enable plants to adapt their growth and development to the light environment. The phytochromes are also widely distributed in diverse prokaryotes, including cyanobacteria and proteobacteria.63 The B510 genome has two genes, AZL019550 and AZLa05830, which encode distinct types of bacterial phytochromes, such as those found in the plant-tumour inducing bacterium A. tumefaciens and in the photosynthetic bradyrhizobium, Bradyrhizobium sp. ORS278.64,65 The translated amino acid sequence of the plasmid-encoded AZLa05830 protein, which shows significant similarity (47% amino acid identity) with AtBphP1 (Atu1990) in A. tumefaciens, is composed of 751 amino acid residues and contains domains that are typical of bacterial phytochromes (PAS-GAF-phytochrome-HisK). A gene encoding a response regulator (AZLa05820) in a CheY superfamily is located downstream of AZLa05830, suggesting that this gene is involved in signal transduction. In contrast, AZL019550 encodes a polypeptide of 853 amino acid residues that contains ‘PAS-GAF-phytochrome-HisK-RR’ domains. The translated gene product had 52% amino acid identity with that of BrBphP2 (BRADO2008) of Bradyrhizobium sp. ORS278. These two candidates for the light-sensing proteins may involve in the signalling pathway, although the actual function of these phytochromes remains to be analysed in B510.Quorum-sensing regulation in several strains of A. lipoferum modulates functions related to rhizosphere competence and adaptation, such as pectinase activity, siderophore synthesis, and IAA production.66 B510 produces acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) molecules in culture67 and carries genes related to AHL synthase (AZLa05890), AHL acylase (AZL013430), and AHL efflux protein (AZLd00800). A LuxR family transcriptional regulator was not found in the vicinity of AHL synthase gene (AZLa05890), although there were 22 luxR family transcriptional regulators on the genome.Most endophytes are motile, because the endophytes systemically spread into the plant from infection sites.2 We found that B510 carried at least two sets of genes that encode proteins involved in flagella assembly (Supplementary Table S10). Thirty one flagella-related genes were clustered on the pAB510e plasmid (AZLe00750–AZLe01230), whereas 25 and 15 of flagella-related genes were present on the chromosome and pAB510a, respectively (Supplementary Table S10). Thirty redundant genes with roles in chemotaxis (e.g. cheAWR) or that encoded methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins were found on the chromosome, pAB510a, pAB510c, pAB510d, and pAB510e.Azospirillum brasilense strain Sp7 has a pRhico plasmid that is responsible for the interaction with plant roots. pRhico has been incompletely sequenced with five gaps, and the presence of 32 genes encoding enzymes involved in surface polysaccharide biosynthesis has been reported.68 To examine the structural similarity between the pRhico plasmid and the B510 genome, a similarity search with the pRhico sequences as a query was conducted against the entire B510 genome sequence, using the BLAST program, with a threshold E-value of 10-10.The search detected significant alignments between the B510 genome and 43 regions of pRhico, 23 of which were mapped on pAB510f. One of these sequences incompletely matched 881 nucleotides inside the putative replication protein gene (repA: AZLf00010) of pAB510f and one matched 138 nucleotides upstream of repA (Supplementary Fig. S10), and 17 mapped to regions on pAB510f that coincided with 11 genes that were presumably involved in cell envelope biosynthesis and outer membrane constitution (AZLf00040, AZLf00050, AZLf00060, AZLf00080, AZLf01050, AZLf01060, AZLf01640, AZLf01790, AZLf01050, and AZLf01810; Supplementary Fig. S10). The results suggest an evolutionary link and some functional relationship between pRhico and pAB510f. However, remaining portions of pRhico, such as those containing exoC and tRNA genes, were scattered throughout the B510 genome and most of the sequences were poorly conserved, indicating that drastic genome rearrangements had taken place since the two species diverged (Supplementary Fig. S10).The sequence information is available in public DNA databases (DDBJ/GenBank/EMBL), under the following accession numbers: AP010946 for the B510 chromosome, AP010947 for pAB510a, AP010948 for pAB510b, AP010949 for pAB510c, AP010950 for pAB510d, AP010951 for pAB510e, and AP010952 for pAB510f.
