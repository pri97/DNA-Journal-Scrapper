Yamato,Megumi Sakaida,Hiroshi Yoda,Hideya Fukuzawa,Kanji Ohyama","01 February 1999","Marchantia polymorpha, immature female sexual organ, EST, classification, redundancy"," A total of 970 expressed sequence tag (EST) clones were generated from immature female sexual organ of a liverwort, Marchantia polymorpha. The 376 ESTs resulted in 123 redundant groups, thus the total number of unique sequences in the EST set was 717. Database search by BLAST algorithm showed that 302 of the unique sequences shared significant similarities to known nucleotide or amino acid sequences. Six unique sequences showed significant similarities to genes that are involved in flower development and sexual reproduction, such as cynarase, fimbriata -associated protein and S-receptor kinase genes. The remaining unique 415 sequences have no significant similarity with any database-registered genes or proteins. The redundant 123 ESTs implied the presence of gene families and abundant transcripts of unknown identity. Analyses of the coding sequences of 61 unique sequences, which contained no ambiguous bases in the predicted coding regions, highly homologous to known sequences at the amino acid level with a similarity score greater than 400, and with stop codons at similar positions as their possible orthologues, indicated the presence of biased codon usage and higher GC content within the coding sequences (50.4%) than that within 3' flanking sequences (41.9%).

Clijdesdale,Paul J. J. Hooykaas,Bert J. van der Zaal","01 February 1999","Arabidopsis thaliana, auxin, lateral root, subtilisin-like protease"," Differential screening of a cDNA library for mRNA species that specifically accumulate during auxin-induced lateral root formation in Arabidopsis thaliana led to the isolation of the AIR3 cDNA clone. The corresponding single copy gene consists of 10 exons which encode a protein that possesses all the characteristics of subtilisin-like proteases. The promoter of the AIR3 gene was fused to the gusA (ß-glucuronidase) reporter gene and introduced into Arabidopsis . Expression was almost completely restricted to the outer layers of the parental root at sites of lateral root emergence and could be observed even before protrusion of the newly formed root tip. In the presence of external auxin, GUS activity was visible throughout the parts of the root that are competent for lateral root formation. By digesting structural proteins in the extracellular matrix of cells located above sites of lateral root formation, AIR3 might weaken cell-to-cell connections and thus facilitate lateral root emergence.

The primary structure of the human Elk1 gene was determined by genomic cloning. The gene structure of Elk1 spans 15.2 kb and consists of seven exons and six introns. The coding sequence resides on exons 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. Sequencing of cDNA clones isolated from human hippocampus library revealed that the second exon was often skipped by an alternative splicing event. All introns commenced with nucleotides GT at the 5' boundary and ended with nucleotides AG at the 3' boundary, in agreement with the proposed consensus sequence for intron spliced donor and acceptance sites. Sequence inspection of the 5'-flanking region revealed the absence of a ‘TATA’ box and the presence of putative cis -acting regulatory elements such as Sp1, GATA-1, CCAAT, and c-Myb. Moreover, the sequence analysis of Elk2 locus on 14q32.3 confirmed that Elk2 gene corresponds to a processed pseudogene of Elk1 which has been reported between alpha 1 gene ( IGHA1 ) and pseudo gamma gene ( IGHGP ) of immunoglobulin heavy chain. Furthermore, the results of Southern analysis using DNAs from human-mouse hybrid cell lines carrying a part of 14q32 region revealed that there is another locus hybridizing to Elk1 cDNA on 14q32.2 <U+2192> qter region in addition to Elk2 locus between IGHA1 and IGHGP loci.

The cDNA has an open reading frame of 1314 nucleotides corresponding to 438 amino acids. The coding sequence was 37.9% identical over 57 amino acid with b subunit of ATP synthase. The 34-amino-acid region of the predicted peptide sequence displays a coiled-coil motif that could form a complex with some other protein(s). We designated this novel gene as ATP-BL because of its homology to the b subunit of ATP synthase. The ATP-BL locus was mapped by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and radiation hybrid mapping to the q24 region of chromosome 16. "

In the study reported here, we characterized the remaining 515-kb of this YAC clone corresponding to the telomeric half of its human insert. The newly sequenced region contained a total of ten genes including six reported previously: phospholipase C delta 1 (PLCD1), human activin receptor type IIB (hActR-IIB), organic cation transporter-like 1 (OCTL1), organic cation transporter-like 2 (OCTL2), oxidative stress response 1 (OSR1), and human xylulokinase-like protein (XYLB). The remaining four genes present in the telomeric region included two known genes, MyD88 and ACAA, and two novel genes. One (designated ENGL) of the novel sequences was found to encode an amino-acid sequence homologous to the family of DNA/RNA endonucleases, especially endonuclease G. The other gene F56 revealed no significant homology to any known genes. These results disclosed complete physical and transcriptional maps of the 1200-kb region of 3p present in YAC 936c1."

Steiner,Juraj Krajcovic,Libor Ebringer,Wolfgang Löffelhardt","01 February 1999","Euglena gracilis, petJ, protein import, psbO, thylakoid lumen, tripartite presequences"," The complete presequences of the nucleus-encoded precursors to two proteins, cytochrome c6 and the 30-kDa protein of the oxygen-evolving complex, that reside in the thylakoid lumen of the chloroplasts of Euglena gracilis are presented. Sorting of these proteins involves translocation across four membranes, the three-membraned chloroplast envelope and the thylakoid membrane. The tripartite presequences show the structure: signal sequence — transit sequence — signal sequence. Three hydrophobic domains become apparent: two of them correspond to signal sequences for translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and the thylakoid membrane, respectively, whereas the third constitutes the stop-transfer signal contained in the long stroma-targeting part of the tripartite presequence.

The gene consists of 12 exons and 11 introns, identified by comparison with partial cDNAs and using the NetPlantGene programme, and encodes a protein of 584 amino acid residues. The C -terminal region of the protein contains 8 tandem repeats of a 17-amino-acid-residue sequence. Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA from Columbia and Landsberg ecotypes of Arabidopsis indicates the presence of a single copy of the 194 gene. The 194 gene is expressed in all organs of Arabidopsis including roots, stems, leaves, flowers, and developing siliques, as determined by northern blot analysis. "

Fink,James W. Hardin,Martin Hauer-Jensen","01 February 1999","Thrombomodulin, molecular cloning, cDNA sequence, TaqMan™ PCR, immunohistochemistry, rat","Thrombomodulin (TM), in addition to its significance in the protein C anticoagulant pathway and cardiovascular diseases, has recently been shown to play important roles in normal embryonic development, several inflammatory conditions, as well as in tumor biology and in the pathogenesis of chronic radiation toxicity. We cloned and sequenced the cDNA encoding the complete TM protein from the Sprague-Dawley rat. The cDNA sequence consisted of a 78-bp 5' non-coding region and a 1731-bp open reading frame encoding 577 amino acids. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences showed Sprague-Dawley rat TM to be 87% homologous with mouse and 70.3% with human TM. In addition to the previously described highly conserved region in the lectin-like domain, another region was found which possessed significant homology among the species and may be involved in regulating cell surface expression of TM. Primers and fluorogenic probe for 5' exonuclease-based real time RT-PCR detection (TaqMan™ PCR) were constructed based on the cDNA sequence information and used to determine steady-state TM mRNA levels in lung, intestine, kidney, brain, and liver. The highest TM mRNA levels were found in lung and the lowest in liver. Immunohistochemistry confirmed that TM was mainly localized on the endothelium of blood vessels and lymphatics. The alveolar capillaries of lung showed the strongest immunoreactivity, whereas the endothelium of hepatic sinusoids and cerebral cortex were virtually negative."

The sequencing of these clones revealed that the average sizes of the inserts and corresponding open reading frames were 4.9 kb and 2.6 kb (882 amino acid residues), respectively. A computer search of the sequences against the public databases indicated that predicted coding sequences of 87 genes contained sequences similar to known genes, 53% of which (46 genes) were categorized as proteins relating to cell signaling/communication, cell structure/motility and nucleic acid management. The chromosomal locations of the genes were determined by using human-rodent hybrid panels unless their mapping data were already available in the public databases. The expression profiles of all the genes among 10 human tissues, 8 brain regions (amygdala, corpus callosum, cerebellum, caudate nucleus, hippocampus, substania nigra, subthalamic nucleus, and thalamus), spinal cord, fetal brain and fetal liver were also examined by reverse transcription-coupled polymerase chain reaction, products of which were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay."
