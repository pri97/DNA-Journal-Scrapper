In fact, the very first issue of DNA Research published a report of genome analysis of Bacillus subtilis. The issue also included a paper on the sequence analysis of a collection of human cDNAs. We had set the focus of our journal on this newly emerging field of research: our primary objective was to provide readers with hard-core genomic and related data from a variety of biological systems, hoping that they could be fully explored and the biological functions encoded therein efficiently exploited. Since then, papers of this category have constituted a major part, though not all, of the papers published in DNA Research, a trend that continues through to today. We believe that our journal has not only satisfied the original goals of its publication, but has exceeded our expectations, as evidenced by the fact that quite a large number of highly cited papers on genomic and other related biological resources have appeared in DNA Research (2006 Impact Factor was 3.066).In the last decade, huge amounts of genomic sequence data have been gathered/deposited and stored in various sequence databases. Technologies allowing the accumulation and interpretation of data, particularly those involving computer software, have seen great advances. Some might say that the data accumulated to date are sufficient enough to cover every conceivable area of research as far as genomics is concerned. We believe, however, that there are still several fields of research where the current sequence data cannot be fully exploited and more pertinent information is urgently needed. One such area is of comparative studies of accumulated genomic data. For example, it is well known that the functions of a majority of the genes of many organisms, predicted from sequence data, cannot be clearly defined because similar sequences with known functions cannot be found in the databases. We therefore feel strongly that the genomic analysis of many more organisms is still needed and that the role of our journal to promote publication of genomic data has not been diminished.At the editorial board of DNA Research, we feel it is equally important to promote publication of papers concerning newly developing technologies for more advanced analysis of genomic data from various perspectives. Furthermore, we would like to encourage researchers to submit papers exploring alternative approaches in genomics, which may complement some of the more conventional genome analyses of individual organisms. Metagenomic analysis of a mixed population of organisms in various habitats is one example of such an approach. We envision and sincerely hope that this type of research will continue in years to come, and will be very much welcome to our journal.In January 2006, Oxford University Press became the publisher of DNA Research. Our journal is currently one of the ‘open access’ journals in which all published papers are freely accessible by readers and we ask the submitting authors of papers to pay a charge for its publication. At the same time, an online submission/administration system (Scholar One) was introduced to speed up and to make transparent the process of submission, editorial handling, and publication of papers.In 2008, in order to attract and encourage more people to read DNA Research and to submit papers of superior quality, we introduced the following measures:
We sincerely hope that these measures will be accepted favorably by the scientific community of DNA/genome research and related disciplines as we continue our service into the future with our determination to publish manuscripts ever more rapidly.Invitation of editors from foreign countries to the editorial board.Introduction of a new section ‘Current Status and Perspectives’ which deals with reviews on specific topics.Broadening of the scope of the journal in response to the expansion as well as fusion of genomics with other research fields.Updating of the design of the journal's cover."

Genes with similar expression patterns can be assumed to be co-regulated at the transcriptional level by promoter sequences with a similar structure. Current approaches for modeling shared regulatory features tend to focus mainly on clustering of cis-regulatory sites. Here we introduce a Markov chain-based promoter structure model that uses both shared motifs and shared features from an input set of promoter sequences to predict candidate genes with similar expression. The model uses positional preference, order, and orientation of motifs. The trained model is used to score a genomic set of promoter sequences: high-scoring promoters are assumed to have a structure similar to the input sequences and are thus expected to drive similar expression patterns. We applied our model on two datasets in Caenorhabditis elegans and in Ciona intestinalis. Both computational and experimental verifications indicate that this model is capable of predicting candidate promoters driving similar expression patterns as the input-regulatory sequences. This model can be useful for finding promising candidate genes for wet-lab experiments and for increasing our understanding of transcriptional regulation.1. IntroductionGene expression in metazoans is regulated at many levels. Regulation of transcription is the first step in the cascade of regulation and is thus of great importance for our understanding of gene expression. Regulation of transcription is determined by the binding of transcription factors (TFs) to their corresponding TF binding sites (TFBSs), and regulatory sequences containing similar sets of TFBSs are expected to be under the control of similar sets of TFs and drive similar expression patterns. Hence, the identification of TFBSs has become a key factor in unraveling the transcriptional regulation mystery. Unfortunately, the identification of these cis-regulatory elements by wet-lab experiments is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Computational methods have come to the rescue, but both their sensitivity and selectivity are severely hampered by the nature of the target motifs: TFBSs tend to be short (typically six to 15 bp) and degenerate, while the sequence in which they are located can be over 10 kb in length. Looking only at the oligonucleotide sequence recognized by a TF, we can expect a number of biologically meaningless occurrences in almost every promoter sequence. The most popular way of modeling TFBSs is by position weight matrices.1 However, this assumes that the positions within the motifs contribute to the binding affinity in an independent manner. Recent experimental evidence has shown that this assumption is not accurate, and a number of models incorporating position-dependencies have been proposed.2–6There is growing evidence that TFs do not work alone, but rather cooperate to confer a specific spatio-temporal expression pattern; for instance, TFs bind to sites located in close proximity to each other, the so-called cis-regulatory modules (CRMs). It is, therefore, not surprising that many approaches to improve the accuracy of tissue expression prediction have focused on clustered groups of predicted binding sites.7–14 Zhao et al., for example, predicted regulatory modules in Caenorhabditis elegans based on the clustering of a set of motifs correlating with muscle-specific gene expression. Clusters are defined simply as sites of the motifs positioned within a certain distance from each other. Blanchette et al. described a more complex approach where large numbers of PWMs are used to find statistically significant clusters of phylogenetically conserved sites in windows of 100 to 2000 bp. However, focusing only on clustered groups of predicted binding sites might be too simplistic an approach to the problem of TFBS detection and regulatory region architecture modeling. First, most of these approaches do not take into account solitary sites at all, even though some of them are likely to be functional. Secondly, in many CRM-modeling approaches, additional features of TFBSs, such as orientation, positional bias with respect to the transcription or translation start site, and order are ignored, although a number of studies have illustrated the importance of these features for some TFBSs.15–17 In a genome-wide analysis of TFBSs in the mouse genome, Sharov et al. found that a considerable number of TFBSs showed a significant bias in their orientation. Berendzen et al. studied the importance of position and orientation of cis-regulatory elements and promoter motifs in a number of species. Their results show that several known functional elements appear to be relatively enriched at defined sites in the promoter region. Terai and Takagi showed that it is possible to find motif combinations in yeast that are significantly associated with a certain expression profile if their order is restricted, whereas they are not associated if their order is not taken into account. Methods that have tried to use such features are few in number. The Dragon Promoter Mapper uses a number of motif features such as the orientation, the order, and distances between adjacent motifs.18 However, the distance to the transcription or translation start site is not taken into account, and the model might have difficulties with motifs that lack a conserved distance between their sites showing a general preference for a certain region within the promoter region. Methods as the one described by Ohler et al. use more diverse physical properties such as DNA bendability, GC content, or stacking energy in addition to predicted TATA-boxes and initiator sites.19 These methods, however, need hundreds of training sequences and focus only on the core promoter region, where the distances between functional elements are strongly conserved. In addition, the final goal of these programs is fundamentally different from ours. While we predict the promoters with a similar architecture as an input set of promoters, they merely predict the presence or absence of a promoter.We introduce here a simple Markov chain-based promoter architecture model as an alternative to the existing CRM models. Our model is trained using an input set of promoter sequences and captures information about the orientation, the positional bias, and the order of predicted occurrences of motifs that are over-represented in the input sequences. Subsequently, the trained model is used to predict genes having similar expression patterns.We applied our model to two promoter sequence datasets: a set of promoter sequences driving expression in pharyngeal muscle cells in C. elegans and a set of muscle-specific promoters in Ciona intestinalis. The muscle system of C. elegans has been extensively studied, and the regulatory regions and expression patterns of a number of genes are relatively well known. C. intestinalis is a chordate model organism that has shown to be very useful for the study of developmental and evolutionary biology, and recently a number of studies have focused on the transcriptional regulation of muscle-specific genes in this organism.20–23 The availability of relatively well-annotated expression information for C. elegans and the recent interest in the Ciona muscle regulatory system have determined the choice of our datasets. For both sets we trained the model and used it to predict new candidate promoters with similar expression patterns as the input promoter sequences. Finally, our predictions were verified for their accuracy, using both available annotation data and new wet-lab experiments.2. Methods2.1. Selection of input sequence datasetsThe genomic set of C. elegans promoter sequences was obtained from WormMart (http://www.wormbase.org/, WormBase Release WS170). For each transcript, the 3000 bp upstream of the translation start site were downloaded, and overlapping upstream open reading frames (ORFs) were removed. Finally, repeats were masked using RepeatMasker (version 3.0; http://www.repeatmasker.org).24 A set of 20 promoters, reported on WormBase to drive expression in pharyngeal muscle cells in C. elegans, was selected as input data for the C. elegans pharyngeal muscle model (see Supplementary Material Section 1).For C. intestinalis, the genomic set of promoters was obtained from BioMart (Release JGI2).25 For each transcript, the 3000 bp upstream of the translation start site were downloaded, overlapping upstream ORFs removed, and repeats masked. The promoter sequences of 19 genes previously shown to be expressed in muscle were used to construct the input promoter data set (see Supplementary Material Section 1).2.2. Identification of useful over-represented motifsOver-represented motifs were predicted in each input dataset using the motif-finding programs, MEME,26 Weeder,27 and AlignACE.28 In order not to overlook any significant motifs, different runs on different regions of the input promoter sequences were done, for both strands as well as for single strands (see Supplementary Material Section 2). Finally, only motifs having a length between 6 and 15 bp and having more than five predicted occurrences in their input dataset were considered. Motifs that were obvious repeats (AT-repeats, AT-rich stretches, etc.) were removed. We further removed redundant motifs and selected up to 10 motifs that showed to be the most significantly over-represented in the input promoter sequences. This final set of motifs for each set of input promoter sequences was then used for further analysis and to construct the promoter architecture model.To model the binding site preferences of each motif, we used a variable-order Bayesian network (VOBN), based on a method described previously.29 Basically, a VOBN model can be regarded as a PWM, with the only difference that a first-order dependency between positions in the motif is allowed. In this study, we have set the conditions for introducing a dependency very strict. Because of this, the majority of positions in the VOBN are of zero-th order, which implies that many motifs are basically modeled as PWMs. Only in cases where a strong dependency was found, a first-order dependency between the positions was introduced (see Supplementary Material Section 3). To model the background nucleotide frequencies of the promoter sequences, both for C. elegans and for C. intestinalis, an interpolated Markov model (IMM) was trained from the genomic set of promoter sequences of each organism. This was done using the procedure described by Salzberg et al.30 The IMM we used here is at most of eighth order. However, in cases where training data is scarce, an interpolation is made with a lower order. Thus the IMM takes advantage of the greater accuracy of higher-order models and, at the same time, avoids the problem of over-fitting caused by insufficient training data.2.3. Positional bias and promoter sequence partitioningUsing the final set of motifs, for each dataset we scanned the input sequences for occurrences of each motif and represented them visually. As is discussed in the Results and discussion section, in many cases the occurrences of a motif show a certain tendency to appear in a certain region of the promoter sequences. Often, this is the region proximal to the transcription or translational start site; in other cases, it is a region further upstream. Keeping this heterogeneity in mind, it would be unwise to make one single model for the entire promoter structure, not taking into consideration the positional bias of some motifs.2.4. Model training2.5. Scoring promoter sequencesA visual representation of the scoring process of the Markov chain-based promoter structure model. (A) A promoter sequence to score. The arrow on the right indicates the translation or transcription start site. The squares represent predicted TFBSs for motifs A, B, and C, with ‘ + ’ and ‘ - ’ indicating their orientation. The promoter sequence is divided into a proximal and a distal region with the boundary between these regions, here set at -500 bp. (B) and (C) A visual representation of the promoter model during the scoring process of the distal region and the proximal region, respectively. The states of the model are shown as circles. Each of the two regions has a ‘start’ and a ‘stop’ state, in addition to states for each motif type in both orientations. To score the sequence shown in (A), in the proximal region of the promoter a transition is made from ‘start’ to ‘C+’, from ‘C+’ to ‘A-’, from ‘A-’ to ‘A-’ and finally from ‘A-’ to ‘stop’, corresponding to the TFBSs predicted in the proximal region of the promoter. The score of the proximal region is the sum of the LLR values associated with each of these transitions (e.g. LLRproximal(C+ | start) for the transition from ‘start’ to ‘C+’, etc.). This process is repeated for the distal part of the promoter, and the final score of the promoter is the sum of the scores of both regions.A visual representation of the scoring process of the Markov chain-based promoter structure model.

The score of the proximal region is the sum of the LLR values associated with each of these transitions (e.g. LLRproximal(C+ | start) for the transition from ‘start’ to ‘C+’, etc.). This process is repeated for the distal part of the promoter, and the final score of the promoter is the sum of the scores of both regions.As indicated above, the transitions between motifs that are more characteristic for input promoter sequences will have a high positive score, whereas transitions between motifs that are more characteristic for non-input promoter sequences will have a high negative score. Thus, promoters having similar sets of motifs as the input sequences, with similar orientations and orders as those of the input sequences, in the same region get a high positive score. High-scoring promoters have a structure similar to the input promoters and are, hence, assumed to drive similar expressions. As can be seen from Equation 4, the individual strength of predicted motif sites does not contribute to the score of a sequence.2.6. In situ hybridization experimentsMature adults of C. intestinalis were collected from harbors in Murotsu, Hyogo, Japan, and maintained in indoor tanks of artificial seawater at 18°C. Larvae were obtained as described previously20 and fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.5 M NaCl, 0.1 M, pH 7.5, 3-(N-morpholino) propanesulfonic acid (MOPS) buffer prior to storage in 80% ethanol at -30°C. As the template to synthesize digoxigenin-labeled antisense RNA probes, cDNA clones were obtained from C. intestinalis Gene Collection Release 1.31 The RNA probes were synthesized using a DIG RNA labeling kit (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). In situ hybridization of whole-mount specimens was carried out as described previously.32 The larvae were mounted in 50% glycerol containing 2% 1,4-diazabicyclo-2,2,2-octane (DABCO) and observed under a confocal microscope LSM 510 (Zeiss).3. Results and discussion3.1. C. elegans pharyngeal muscle promoter architecture modelIn a set of 20 promoter sequences reported to drive expression in pharyngeal muscle cells of C. elegans, we predicted over-represented motifs (see Section 2). Table 1 shows the positional bias score of the found motifs, together with the 300 bp window in the input promoter sequences where the occurrences of each motif are the most abundant. None of these motifs showed a significant similarity to motifs in the JASPAR database.33 Note that some motifs (Cel_PM4, Cel_PM7) show a considerable bias in their orientation. Given that the motifs with the most significant positional bias seem to prefer the region roughly between the translation start site and -1000 bp, we divided the promoter region into a proximal region (from the translation start site to -1000) and a more distal region (from -1000 to the 5' end of the promoter sequence). Next, for both regions, a first-order Markov chain was trained taking into account the orientation of the motif occurrences as described (see Methods and Supplementary Material Section 4).The seven motifs used in the C. elegans pharyngeal muscle promoter model, with their consensus sequenceThe third and fourth columns show the positional bias score of each motif and the positions of the densest window relative to the translation start site, respectively. The fifth column shows the number of predicted sites in the input promoters on each strand and the ratio of sites in the ‘plus’ orientation.The seven motifs used in the C. elegans pharyngeal muscle promoter model, with their consensus sequenceThe third and fourth columns show the positional bias score of each motif and the positions of the densest window relative to the translation start site, respectively. The fifth column shows the number of predicted sites in the input promoters on each strand and the ratio of sites in the ‘plus’ orientation.In a next step, the genome-wide set of promoters of C. elegans was scored by the trained model (see Methods). Of the 20 input promoters, 11 were in the 100 top-scoring sequences (see Supplementary Material Section 5). To verify the validity of this prediction, we used the expression annotation that can be found in WormBase. For the 100 highest scoring non-input genes having a tissue expression annotation (the first one being ranked 30th, the last one 606th out of 24 446 promoters), we determined which tissues were statistically over-represented. We found that the 100 top-scoring annotated non-input genes are enriched for genes expressed in pharyngeal muscles (10 genes, 4.1 expected by chance, P-value = 0.0025) and muscle tissue in general (42 genes, 30.9 expected by chance, P-value = 0.0072). There was also a slight enrichment for genes expressed in motor neurons (7 genes, 2.4 expected by chance, P-value = 0.0110), which are involved in the regulation of muscle contractions. It is not surprising to find the top-scoring genes to be enriched for not only pharyngeal muscle cells, but also muscle tissues in general, as the input genes’ tissue expression patterns were not restricted to only pharyngeal muscle cells but also included other muscle tissues. Table 2 shows the 10 top-scoring annotated non-input genes and their expression annotation as reported on WormBase. Five of these 10 genes are reported to be expressed in muscle tissue, one of them in pharyngeal muscles. In addition, some genes are reported to be expressed in neurons and motor neurons. It is known that muscle genes and neuronal genes share some regulatory elements, and other studies have reported similar observations.13,34The ten highest scoring non-input promoters for the C. elegans pharyngeal muscle promoter model, with their rank, sequence and transcript name and reported expression patternOf these ten promoters five drive expression in one or more muscle tissues, one specifically in pharyngeal muscles.The ten highest scoring non-input promoters for the C. elegans pharyngeal muscle promoter model, with their rank, sequence and transcript name and reported expression patternOf these ten promoters five drive expression in one or more muscle tissues, one specifically in pharyngeal muscles.3.2. C. intestinalis muscle promoter architecture modelWe predicted over-represented motifs in a set of 19 C. intestinalis promoter sequences known to drive expression in C. intestinalis muscle tissue. Table 3 shows the positional bias scores of the detected over-represented motifs. Motif Cin_M1 and motif Cin_M3 have consensus sequences that are highly similar to those of motifs that have been reported before as playing a crucial role in transcriptional regulation of muscle genes in C. intestinalis.20 The binding sites of these motifs show similarity to those of the CREB and Myf (MyoD) TFs, respectively. Note that again in Table 2, some motifs (Cin_M5, Cin_M10) show a considerable bias in their orientation.The ten motifs used in the C. intestinalis muscle promoter model, with their consensus sequence. See the legend of Table 1 for explanations on the meaning of each columnHere the positions of the densest window are given relative to the TATA-box.The ten motifs used in the C. intestinalis muscle promoter model, with their consensus sequence. See the legend of Table 1 for explanations on the meaning of each columnHere the positions of the densest window are given relative to the TATA-box.For this model, predicted TATA-boxes were used as reference points instead of the translational start sites. Sequences in which we could not find a TATA-box within a reasonable distance of the coding region were anchored at the position 100 bp upstream of the translation start site. Given the preference of some motifs for the proximal region, the promoter architecture model was partitioned into a proximal part (from the translation start site to 250 bp upstream of the predicted TATA-box) and a distal part (from 250 bp upstream of the predicted TATA-box until the 5' end of the promoter sequence). Although our model does not include a direct way to model the clustering of sites, Table 2 illustrates that the proximal part of the promoter model was denser in motif occurrences than the distal part.For both regions, a first-order Markov chain was trained (see Methods and Supplementary Material Section 4). The genomic set of promoter sequences of C. intestinalis was then scored using the trained model. The promoters were ranked by their score and the top-scoring genes selected for further analysis. Of the 19 input promoters, 16 are in the top 100 scoring sequences (see Supplementary Material Section 5). As a verification of the predictions, expression patterns of non-input genes from the top 50 scoring sequences were analyzed experimentally by in situ hybridization. Among the 29 non-input sequences in the top 50 list, three sequences, all of which encode muscle actin, were excluded from the analysis because their muscle-specific nature was obvious. Other two genes, whose expression patterns had been already known, were also excluded. Among the 24 sequences remaining, cDNA clones were available for four predicted sequences in C. intestinalis Gene Collection Release 1,31 and they were used to synthesize RNA probes for the in situ hybridization analysis. The results of these experiments are shown in Fig. 2. For three of the four tested genes, expression was observed in muscle cells in the tail of the C. intestinalis larva.

ConclusionWe have introduced a simple promoter architecture model that uses the positional bias, the orientation bias, and the order of predicted sites of a set of motifs to predict promoter sequences that drive similar expression patterns as the input promoter sequences. As this model does not directly model the clustering of motifs, it can be considered as an alternative to the existing CRM-based models. During the training of the model, only one parameter needs to be set (i.e. the position of the boundary between the regions). We did not use any tissue-specific or organism-specific information in the construction of the model, so we can expect it to be applicable in other tissues and organisms as well. The fact that we could successfully predict expression profiles in two organisms illustrates the general applicability of our approach. Moreover, the motifs we used in the two datasets and described here were based solely on computational predictions, illustrating that this method does not require prior knowledge of the regulatory factors involved and their binding sites. Apart from a set of promoter sequences of co-regulated genes no other input data are needed. However, the structure of promoters driving expression in other tissues, such as the photoreceptor in C. intestinalis, has shown to be more challenging. Improvements to the model, such as the incorporation of additional information (e.g. the clustering of sites, the distance between pairs of sites, or evolutionary conservation) are likely to improve its prediction performance and are now being studied.Supplementary DataSupplementary data are available online at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research from JSPS (17310114) and was supported in part by another grant (18370089) and by BIRD of Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST).

Here, we systematically analyzed PPIs in the nitrogen-fixing soil bacterium Mesorhizobium loti using a modified high-throughput yeast two-hybrid system. The aims of this study are primarily on the providing functional clues to M. loti proteins that are relevant to symbiotic nitrogen fixation and conserved in other rhizobium species, especially proteins with regulatory functions and unannotated proteins. By the screening of 1542 genes as bait, 3121 independent interactions involving 1804 proteins (24% of the total protein coding genes) were identified and each interaction was evaluated using an interaction generality (IG) measure and the general features of the interacting partners. Most PPIs detected in this study are novel interactions revealing potential functional relationships between genes for symbiotic nitrogen fixation and signal transduction. Furthermore, we have predicted the putative functions of unannotated proteins through their interactions with known proteins. The results described here represent new insight into protein network of M. loti and provide useful experimental clues to elucidate the biological function of rhizobial genes that can not be assigned directly from their genomic sequence.1. IntroductionBacteria belonging to the family Rhizobiaceae (rhizobia) are biologically unique organisms that exhibit two distinct lifestyles in nature, as free-living soil bacteria or as symbionts of some leguminous plants. In nitrogen-starved soil, rhizobia can colonize the roots of compatible legumes and elicit the formation of specialized organ, the root nodules. Inside the nodules, rhizobia differentiate into non-dividing form of bacteria (bacteroid) and reduce atmospheric dinitrogen (N2) into biologically usable ammonia (NH3). Nitrogen fixed by the symbiotic rhizobia is then assimilated by the host plant, enabling the plant to grow in nitrogen-depleted environments.Because of the agronomic importance of rhizobia, complete genome sequencing has been accomplished in seven rhizobia1–6 and is now in progress on several additional species. The availability of complete genome sequences allows us to know the global features of the organism ‘rhizobium’ at the molecular level. Simultaneously, the genome sequences also provide genetic platforms for comparative study of genome structure within rhizobia, or between rhizobia and other plant-associated bacteria. These comparative analyses have revealed the existence of a genomic region enriched for genes involved in symbiotic nitrogen fixation (symbiosis island), as well as various specialized gene sets for signal transduction and membrane transport that allow rhizobia to adapt to the environment of both soil and intracellular of host plant.1,5,7Although a genome sequence is very useful, the genome sequence alone is not sufficient to reveal the specific molecular functions of all the genes. To date, genetic analyses, such as targeted gene disruption or transposon random mutagenesis, have revealed various rhizobial genes essential for nodule formation and nitrogen fixation.6,8 Additionally, with the completion of several rhizobial genome sequences, comprehensive transcriptome or proteome analysis has been carried out in order to understand physiological states of rhizobia under a variety of conditions such as symbiosis with host legume or nutrient-depleted conditions.9–14 These analyses have allowed us to know expressional dynamics throughout the rhizobial genome and to discover numerous novel genes and proteins not previously known to be involved in these conditions.Although a large amount of data have been accumulated through these functional analyses, many genes predicted on the rhizobial genome remain functionally unannotated. That is primarily because that the genome sequence and expression profiles give an indirect and fragmented picture of the biological function of genes, and more detailed information on gene function would be obtained by biochemical properties of the gene products (proteins) or by their interaction with other proteins of known function. Therefore, more interactive and systematic analysis that accelerates functional assignment for many rhizobial genes simultaneously is required.As a first effort to examine the protein networks of rhizobia, we conducted a large-scale analysis of protein–protein interactions (PPIs) in Mesorhizobium loti using a yeast two-hybrid (YTH) system. YTH analysis is one of the well-established methods for mapping binary protein interactions and its usefulness is clearly illustrates by the fact that comprehensive studies of PPIs in several model organisms have provided several important biological and bioinformatics platforms for the study of protein networks in the organism.15–18 These analyses have also successfully placed functionally uncharacterized proteins into their biological context.In this study, for the selection of target gene groups for the YTH screening, we primarily used two available information, the genomic information and the results of a transcriptome analysis of M. loti. Symbiosis island contains many genes for symbiotic nitrogen fixation1 and the clustered up-regulation of genes in symbiosis island under bacteroid state were observed by macroarray analysis of M. loti.14 The macroarray analysis also revealed that several genes located outside of symbiosis island were also up-regulated under bacteroid or microaerobic condition. Although these features led us to hypothesize that genes located in the symbiotic island and those up-regulated under symbiosis are involved in certain physiological events of symbiotic nitrogen fixation, the biological significance of the majority of these genes has not yet been revealed. Identification of PPIs of these gene products will help elucidate their biological function and expand our knowledge of the mechanism of symbiotic nitrogen fixation. Therefore, we selected these genes for the initial target of our analysis. Complete genome sequences of several rhizobium species enables us to survey the conserved orthologous genes among rhizobia. Since conserved genes are presumed to execute common functions, the obtained PPI data from the M. loti YTH screening can be applied to other rhizobia. Among conserved genes, we primarily selected M. loti genes of unknown function and those with regulatory functions, in order to reveal the biological roles of the functionally unannotated proteins and signal transduction pathways that function commonly among rhizobium species.2. Materials and methods2.1. Construction of bait clones and prey libraryThe backbone of our YTH screening is the MATCHMAKER GAL-4 based YTH system. As for bait and prey vectors, we used pAS2-1 and pACT2 (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA), respectively, which were modified by introducing the Gateway recombination system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).19 A Gateway cassette containing the attR recombination site flanking a ccdB gene and a chloramphenicol-resistance gene were ligated into the multicloning site of pAS2-1 and pACT2, and the resultant vectors were designated as pAS-GW and pACT-GW, respectively.For bait clones, target gene fragments were obtained by PCR amplification from cosmid clones or genomic DNA using gene specific primer pairs with CACC sequence added to the forward primer. To minimize potential misincorporation during PCR, the high-fidelity DNA polymerase, Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA), was used. Amplified fragments were cloned into the pENTR/D-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) to make entry clones. After confirmation of DNA sequence, the insert of the entry clone was transferred to pAS-GW using LR recombination reaction according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resultant plasmids harboring individual M. loti genes were transformed into yeast AH109 (MATa) (Clontech) and transformants were grown on SD/-Trp plates.We constructed a prey library from a random genomic fragment library. Genomic DNA of M. loti was isolated by the procedure of Chen and Kuo20 with some modifications. Following the sonication of genomic DNA, two size ranges of DNA fragments (0.5–1.2 and 1.2–2.5 kb) were isolated from agarose gels and then cloned individually into DraI/EcoRV site of the pENTR 1A vector (Invitrogen). A pool of plasmids containing each size range of DNA fragments were recovered from 5.3 × 106 (0.5–1.2 kb) and 3.8 × 106 (1.2–2.5 kb) independent Escherichia coli transformants (ElectroMax DH10B competent cells; Invitrogen). The inserts of the recovered plasmids were transferred to the pACT-GW vector via LR recombination, and the resultant plasmids were transformed into the yeast strain Y187 (MATa). A total of 6 × 106 yeast transformants were collected and pooled as the prey library.2.2. Mating-mediated YTH screeningPrior to screening, the self-activity of each bait clone was confirmed by mating with the Y187 strain harboring an empty pACT2 vector and then plating on SD/-His/-Leu/-Trp/ medium supplemented with 2.5, 5, 10, or 50 mM 3-amino 1,2,4-triazole (3-AT). Each bait clone was mated with the prey library containing approximately 3 × 107 independent clones and plated on SD/-His/-Leu/-Trp/ agar medium supplemented with the optimal concentration of 3-AT. After 7 days of growth at 30°C, positive colonies were picked and transferred into 96-well culture plates and grown for an additional 3 days at 30°C. Some of each cultured positive clone was used for ß-galactosidase assays and DNA sequencing of the prey clones insert, and the remainder was stored at -80°C. The collected positive clones were treated with Zymolyase solution [2.5 mg/ml of Zymolyase-100T; (Seikagaku America Inc., EastFalmouth, MA, USA), 1.2 M sorbitol, 0.1 M Na phosphate, pH 7.4] for 30 min at 37°C and then used as templates for amplification of prey clone inserts using the following primers: 5'-TACCACTACAATGGATGATG-3' and 5'-GGGGTTTTTCAGTATCTACG-3'. Amplified fragments were sequenced using the same primers to obtain sequence tags. The resulting sequences were compared with the RhizoBase (http://www.kazusa.or.jp/rhizobase) to determine the genomic region which interacted with each bait protein.2.3. Homolog search and calculation of interaction generalityMesorhizobium loti genes whose homologs are conserved in three rhizobia were selected according to the criteria described by Kaneko et al.2 The lower threshold of acceptability was set at 0.25 of the BLASTP bit score reported by self-comparison. Paralogous genes of M. loti were selected if the Smith–Waterman score was greater than 200.The calculation of the interaction generality (IG) values of each interaction was conducted using the methods described in the previous report.213. Results and discussion3.1. Design of a high-throughput YTH system and selection of M. loti genes for screeningTo facilitate the efficiency and accuracy of directional in-frame cloning of M. loti genes, we used a Gateway-compatible vector system to construct bait clones (Fig. 1). Using this system, we successfully cloned 1542 full-length M. loti genes (21% of the total M. loti genes, Supplementary Table 1) into the Gateway entry vector. Since the insert of each entry clone can be easily transferred to other destination vectors via Gateway recombination, the constructed Gateway entry clones can also be used as material resources for many other analyses of M. loti genes.Flow chart of the sequential steps in the YTH analysis of M. loti (see Materials and Methods for details). BD and AD indicate the GAL4 DNA-binding domain and GAL4 activation domain, respectively.Flow chart of the sequential steps in the YTH analysis of M. loti (see Materials and Methods for details). BD and AD indicate the GAL4 DNA-binding domain and GAL4 activation domain, respectively.In order to screen various potential PPIs efficiently, we constructed prey library from GAL4 activation domain-fused random genomic library and screened the library using a yeast-mating method. By using the random fragment library as prey clones, information on interaction pairs and interacting regions of the prey proteins can be obtained simultaneously. All selected positive clones were processed in 96-well plate format and data of a large number of sequence tags derived from positive clones were processed by the same semi-automated system developed by Sato et al.22Using this high-throughput YTH system, we explored large-scale PPI analysis in the nitrogen-fixing soil bacteria, M. loti. As shown in Table 1, we selected M. loti genes for YTH screening on the basis of the following features: (i) genes whose expression is up-regulated under bacteroid or microaerobic condition and genes located in symbiosis island, and (ii) genes whose homologs are conserved in other rhizobium genomes.Mesorhizobium loti genes used for YTH analysisMesorhizobium loti genes used for YTH analysisUp-regulated genes were selected by referring to the macroarray analysis of M. loti.14 On the basis of the supplemental information provided with the macroarray analysis, 93 and 72 genes were selected as highly up-regulated under bacteroid state and microaerobic condition, respectively (Supplementary Table 1). Genes located in symbiosis island were selected from genomic information of M. loti.1 We selected 416 genes (excluding those genes with transposon-related functions and those previously selected as up-regulated under bacteroid or microaerobic condition) from the location of symbiosis island (Supplementary Table 1). Genes whose homologs are conserved in other rhizobium genomes were selected by comparing the genome sequences of three rhizobium species, M. loti strain MAFF303099 (symbiont for Lotus japonicus), Sinorhizobium meliloti strain 1021 (alfalfa symbiont), and Bradyrhizobium japonicum strain USDA110 (soybean symbiont), whose complete genome sequences were available when this study was initiated. When genes were selected by the criteria described in Materials and methods, 2797 genes were found to be conserved among three rhizobia species. Of these, we selected 858 M. loti genes that were categorized to regulatory function (227 genes), hypothetical protein (479 genes), and unknown protein (152 genes). Altogether, a total of 1640 genes, including 201 genes selected for other purposes, were selected as target genes for this study (Supplementary Table 1).3.2. Assessment of the PPI dataOf the 1640 genes targeted, 1542 (21% of all predicted M. loti genes) bait clones were constructed successfully (Table 2). PPIs were identified on 57% of the bait clones, resulting in 3121 putative interaction pairs consisting of 1804 M. loti proteins. (Fig. 2, Supplementary Table 2; all PPI data are also available from RhizoBase, http://bacteria.kazusa.or.jp/rhizobase).Global view of the PPIs of M. loti. (A) All detected PPIs.

Percentages represent the coverage of interacting proteins in each function category.Summary of experimental resultsSummary of experimental resultsOne of the major concerns of large-scale PPI analysis is its reliability. PPI data obtained from comprehensive analyses generally contains numerous false positives, which are mainly caused by promiscuous interactions and self-activation of bait clones.21,23 Therefore, the detected interactions need to be evaluated by some appropriate criteria. Ito et al. employed interaction sequence tags (ISTs), a pair of tagged sequences obtained from interacting bait and prey clones, to weigh the reliability of each detected interaction.16 They handled the interactions with high IST hits as ‘core’ data, which is assumed to be of high relevance and to contain many biologically meaningful interactions. Similarly, as one indicator of data reliability, we classified all detected interactions into four distinct categories (category A–D) based on how many positive clones supported the interaction. Category A and B consist of interactions supported by multiple positive clones with different (A) or identical (B) inserts. Category C consists of interactions supported by a single positive clone. Interactions supported by prey clones that interacted with more than 18 different baits, i.e. 1% of all interacting proteins, were considered promiscuous interactions and classified in category D. Most promiscuously interacting proteins were soluble proteins, and 10 out of 18 promiscuous proteins possessed at least one protein domain known to cause promiscuous interactions24,25 (Supplementary Table 3). Other than the promiscuous interaction domains, no remarkable physicochemical properties common to the promiscuous proteins, such as isoelectric point or hydrophobicity, were found. The number of interactions in each category is shown in Table 2.To assess the validity of our categorization, we evaluated all detected interactions using the IG measurement, a method for computationally assessing the reliability of PPI.21 Interactions with lower IG values are more likely to be reliable than interactions with higher IG values. The IG values for all detected interactions ranged from 1 to 62 and the average IG value was 10.2. When we examined the interactions in which the IG values were <5, >94% of interactions in category A, B, and C were included, whereas only 32% of category D interactions were included (Supplementary Fig. 1). The average IG values for category A (2.37 ± 0.16), B (2.21 ± 0.17), and C (2.75 ± 0.72) were significantly lower (P < 0.01) than that of category D (26.0 ± 3.49) when 50 independent interactions were selected randomly from each category and compared. This result indicates that our classification is appropriate to define the reliability of each interaction.To minimize false positives caused by self-activation, we used multiple reporter genes driven by different GAL4-responsive promoters and carefully determined the level of self-activation of each bait clone (see Materials and methods). Furthermore, we re-screened bait proteins under more stringent conditions when the bait protein generated an excessive number of positive colonies (>300 colonies per bait). As shown in Table 2, 31 bait proteins displayed strong self-activation which could not be suppressed by leaky HIS3 reporter gene expression even in the presence of 50 mM 3-AT and the interactions derived from these strong self-active bait clones were discarded. A total of 148 bait clones (9.6% of all screened baits) were screened in the presence of 50 mM 3-AT (Supplementary Table 4). As expected, several bait clones harboring genes with regulatory functions such as transcriptional regulators or two-component response regulators (RRs) showed self-activation. However, 92 out of 148 were genes annotated as hypothetical or unknown protein. To examine the protein domains responsible for their self-activation, we examined the known protein domains assigned in these genes. Although several kinds of bacterial regulatory protein domains, such as LuxR (IPR000792), LysR (IPR000847), and RR receiver (REC) (IPR001789) domain, are frequently found among self-active genes, some proteins with a domain of unknown function (DUF domain) and hypothetical or unknown proteins with no known protein domains were also included.In addition to the detection of false positives, large-scale PPI analyses tend to miss a large number of known interactions (false negatives). The precise proportion of false-negative interactions can be determined by comparison with published experimental PPI data.18 However, this approach is difficult to apply to M. loti PPI analysis because the available data regarding protein interactions of M. loti are limited. To compensate for this problem, we estimated the proportion of false-negatives based on the interactions of proteins in two-component signal transducers whose interaction can be predicted by the location of the corresponding genes in the genome. In the M. loti genome, 30 pairs of genes encoding a sensor histidine kinase (HK) and RR are considered to forms operons and, of these, 15 pairs were detected from screening all RR and 37 HK used as bait, indicating that ~50% of the interactions could not be detected by our analysis.3.3. General features of PPIsA global view of the protein interaction network is illustrated in Fig. 2A. Proteins (nodes) and interactions (edges) are colored according to their functional categories and interaction categories, respectively. Proteins in the obtained protein network cover all functional categories of M. loti (Fig. 2B), and interactions are presented as scale-free network, since most proteins had few connections and only a small number had many connections.Prokaryotic genes are generally organized into operons in which genes are transcribed as a polycistronic mRNA. Several previous studies have demonstrated that genes encoded in the same operon are likely to be coordinately linked and carry out related functions.26,27 In all the interactions detected, we found 36 interacting pairs that were encoded by genes that mapped to adjacent loci in the M. loti genome (Supplementary Table 5a and b). Notably, 14 out of 36 protein pairs were category A interactions and the frequency of category A interactions between proteins encoded by adjacent genes is significantly higher than that of the whole network. This result further supports the validity of our evaluation of protein interaction data by interaction category. Among the interacting protein encoded at adjacent loci, 15 interactions contained at least one protein of unknown function. Among these, we found a putative part of a sarcosine oxidase complex composed of Mll6238 (annotated as sarcosine oxidase alpha subunit) and Mll6237 (unknown protein that contains a protein domain of sarcosine oxidase gamma subunit). We also found a putative protein complex required for chromosome condensation and segregation between Mll1088 (hypothetical protein contains ScpA domain; IPR003768) and Mll1087 (hypothetical protein contains ScpB domain; IPR005234). Considering that genes belonging to the same operon are predicted to have related functions, the interactions extracted according to the genomic position permit us to predict the biological function of unknown proteins and provides experimental evidence to reinforce the functional relationships between proteins encoded by adjacent genes.We also identified 25 self-interacting proteins and 9 hetero-dimeric interactions that occurred between two paralogous proteins (Supplementary Table 6). Approximately half of the self-interacting proteins have regulatory functions, and some contained several types of helix-turn-helix (HTH) motifs. This result is reasonable because HTH-containing proteins are known to execute their function in the form of homo-dimers or homo-tetramors28 and homo-dimeric forms of these proteins have been identified in several microorganisms by large-scale PPI analysis and X-ray diffraction.29,30 Furthermore, as observed in yeast and some other eucaryotes,31 the paralogous-interacting proteins detected here tended to exhibit self-interaction. For example, the self-interacting Mll3429 and Mlr5643 also interacted with their paralogues, Mll2335 and Mll3718, respectively. In addition, three other proteins (Mlr6361, Shikimate kinase; Mll8202, GroES; and Mlr2806, NolR) are also known to form homo-dimers,32–34 indicating that this tendency may support the hypothesis that duplication of self-interacting proteins can generate paralogous proteins whose interactions create functional and structural diversification.22,313.4. Interaction of symbiosis related proteinsYTH screening with 581 genes that were selected based on their expression profiles and location in symbiosis island generated 646 interaction pairs (excluding category D interactions). Among the relatively reliable interactions (interaction categories A and B), the proportion of interactions between proteins encoded in symbiosis island was significantly higher (20%) than the ratio expected (8%) by random interactions. This result may reflect the existence of interrelated functions among proteins within the symbiosis island, as suggested by the clustered expression of genes in symbiosis island under the bacteroid state.14In the M. loti genome, 40 genes for nodulation and 46 genes for nitrogen fixation were assigned by whole genome sequencing.1 Interactions were detected on 13 genes for nodulation and 27 genes for nitrogen fixation, respectively. Among these interactions, we successfully identified several interaction pairs whose functional relationships have been proven experimentally, such as NtrX (Mlr0400)–NtrY (Mlr0399) and FixL (Mll6607)–FixJ (Mll6606), which are two-component sensor-regulator pairs that participate in nitrogen metabolisms and sensing of environmental oxygen tension,35 and NtrR (Mll1670)–NtrP (Mll1671) operon that function in complex as toxin-antitoxin module.36 Detection of these known interactions indicates that the rhizobial proteins we screened here retained their native conformation in yeast cells.One of the advantages of interactome analysis is that interactions between novel proteins and well-characterized ones provide us highly informative hints to expand our knowledge, and such interactions were found on several symbiosis-related proteins. For example, a two-component RR (Mll9592) encoded in the M. loti plasmid (pMLb) interacted with two distinct NifA proteins (Mll5857 and Mll5837). NifA is a transcriptional activator that controls, in concert with RNA polymerase sigma factor, the expression of genes for nitrogen fixation.37,38 Unlike other known sigma factor-interacting transcriptional activators such as DctD and NtrC,39 NifA protein lacks the REC domain which accept the phosphoryl signal from the cognate sensor HK. In contrast, Mll9592 contains a REC domain but lacks any DNA binding domains. Considering their physical interaction and the distribution of protein domains, Mll9592 may execute its function by forming a complex with NifA proteins.We identified several interactions of proteins encoded by genes whose expression is up-regulated in the bacteroid state or by microaerobic condition. It is noteworthy that approximately one-third of the proteins that interacted with proteins encoded by the up-regulated genes are functionally unannotated proteins. For example, msr6604 which encodes small protein of unknown function that located upstream of the FixLJ (mll6606–mll6607) operon interacted with both FixL (Mll6607) and FixJ (Mll6606) (Supplementary Table 7). Likewise, Mll9215 which was annotated as unknown protein interacted with two distinct FixO proteins (Mll6629 and Mlr6412) (Supplementary Table 7) and expression of the three genes encoding these proteins was up-regulated in the bacteroid state.14 Furthermore, interaction of proteins encoded by up-regulated genes also revealed putative interaction on several molecular chaperones. For instance, Mll3429 (endopeptidase Clp ATP-binding chain B; ClpB) interacted with Mll2335 (probable ClpA/B-type protease). The expression of mll3429 was up-regulated under microaerobiosis14 and its orthologous protein (blr1404) of B. japonicum USDA110 were identified to be expressed specifically in soybean nodule.9,13 This result indicates that interaction between Mll3429 and Mll2335 may be a part of protease complex that function in protein processing during symbiosis. In addition, Mll3623 (unknown protein) interacted with two paralogous heat-shock proteins (Mlr4721 and Mlr4720) encoded by genes in the same operon. The genes encoding these heat-shock proteins were up-regulated under microaerobic condition,14 indicating that Mll3623 may be a target of these heat-shock proteins or may be involved in protection of proteins against microaerobic stress-induced protein denaturation and aggregation. Although the biological significance of these interactions remains to be solved, our results imply that many proteins of unknown function are involved in various aspects of symbiotic nitrogen fixation and our PPI data will provide useful clues to reveal the functional relationships between them.3.5. Interactions of proteins with regulatory functionsIn order to acquire PPI information leads to understanding of signal transduction pathways that functioned in rhizobium, we screened M. loti genes with regulatory functions. Among 295 selected genes (including 234 conserved genes), 286 bait clones were used for screening and 618 PPIs were obtained from 207 bait clones.Among these PPIs, many interaction pairs of two-component signal transducers were detected as reliable interactions (Fig. 3). Two-component signal transduction systems, composed of a HK and RR, are the predominant systems by which bacteria sense several environmental changes, and through a linear phosphorelay from the HK to its cognate RR, cells can adapt rapidly to new conditions. Considering their specific functional relationship, the interaction of two-component signal transducers are suitable models not only to evaluate our PPI data but also to reveal novel part of signaling pathways in M. loti. In the M. loti genome, 46 and 58 genes encoding HK and RR are assigned, respectively, and, among them, 30 pairs of HK and RR are considered to be transcribed in single operons.40 From screening of 38 HKs and all the RRs as bait, 33 interactions between HK and RR were obtained (Fig. 3). Among these interactions, we successfully identified 15 pairs of HK and RR that encoded by the same operon, and most of these interactions were supported by multiple positive clones. These interactions, for examples, identified a part of putative chemotaxis pathway of M. loti (CheW; mll9513–CheA; mll9511–CheA; mll9511–CheY; mll9509) as observed in PPI analysis of other bacteria.30,41 Detection of putative cognate pairs of HK and RR as relatively reliable interactions strongly supports the validity of the screen scale and the specificity of our YTH analysis. We also identified 18 pairs of interactions between HK and RR that were located in different regions of the M. loti genome (e.g. Mll7700–Mll0861). Since it is difficult to know the specific functional partner of HK or RR from their sequence, the interaction pairs described here provide evidence to support the functional relationships among putative cognate HK and RR encoded in a single operon and also allow us to predict the functional partners of HK or RR located in different regions of the M. loti genome. In addition to one-to-one interactions between HK and RR, we found several interactions that occurred between multiple HKs and a single RR, and vice versa (e.g. Mll6691 and Mlr6540). The existence of cross-regulation in two-component systems has been reported in several bacteria,42 but not in rhizobia. Therefore, the PPIs obtained here for multiple HKs and RRs reveals, for the first time, putative cross-regulation in two-component systems in rhizobia.Interaction pairs of two-component signal transducers.

Interactions of proteins of unknown functionAmong the 7281 predicted ORFs of M. loti, ~46% (3371 ORFs) are functionally unannotated (categorized as hypothetical or unknown protein).1 To assign some functional information to hypothetical and unknown proteins of M. loti, we examine all the interactions containing these proteins and characterized them based on their interactions with partners of known function. When 877 genes of unknown function were screened as bait (including 608 genes screened as conserved genes), 1598 interactions between a protein of known function and unknown function were obtained (Table 3). Of these, 569 proteins of unknown function had at least one partner of known function and 94 showed interactions with two or more known protein of same function category. For example, Mlr0746 (unknown protein) interacted with three distinct transcriptional regulators (Mlr0745, Mll5360, and Mll2255) which are paralogous proteins with the same protein domains (Supplementary Table 7), suggesting that Mlr0746 may have any roles in regulating transcription. Furthermore, to obtain more detailed information about the function unknown proteins, we examined the PPIs of function unknown proteins at the level of protein domains. By focusing on common interaction partners or common protein domains, we assigned 42 unannotated (including 25 conserved) proteins to nine distinct functional categories (Supplementary Table 7). This approach allowed us to identify component of protein complexes that had not been assigned by gene annotation. For example, Mll2736 (hypothetical protein) which contains a ClpS core domain (IPR003769) interacts with two distinct Clp proteases (Mll0663 and Mll2335). Mlr3346 (hypothetical protein) contains a phosphonate metabolism PhnJ domain (IPR010306) and interacts with paralogous hypothetical proteins (Mll9155 and Mlr3342) that contain a phnG domain (IPR009609). On the basis of the fact that proteins with related functions tend to interact, these interactions should reflect the functional properties of the unannotated proteins of M. loti. Actually, previous works have predicted the functions of unannotated proteins from large-scale PPI data using similar strategies.43–45 Since the functional relationships described here could not be determined from genome sequences or other genome-wide analyses, our data should provide novel and useful information for elucidating the biological roles of many unannotated proteins of rhizobia.Summary of interactions with proteins of unknown functionSummary of interactions with proteins of unknown functionOur results provide a comprehensive data source for PPIs of M. loti proteins. From this PPI data, we have predicted putative novel relationships among proteins for symbiotic nitrogen fixation and signal transduction and have provided some functional information on several unannotated proteins. Since our study examined primarily on proteins playing certain roles in symbiotic nitrogen fixation (i.e. one of the unique characteristics of rhizobium) and proteins conserved in other rhizobia, the data are applicable to further functional studies of many rhizobial species, as well as M. loti. To make the interaction data publicly available, we provide all obtained PPI data through rhizobial genome database, RhizoBase (http://bacteria.kazusa.or.jp/rhizobase/index.html). In the database, we have provided all PPI data including the interaction category and interacting region of the prey protein so that users can obtain PPI information depending on their own needs.Although some of our findings will be needed to be confirmed by independent approaches, we believe that the obtained PPI data should provide a useful starting point to elucidate the biological function of many rhizobial genes.FundingKAKENHI (Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research) on Priority Areas “Comparative Genomics” from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology of Japan.We would like to thank Drs S.

Genes necessary for attaching and effacing lesions are located in the locus for enterocyte effacement (LEE) pathogenicity island. LEE gene transcription is positively regulated by Ler, which is also encoded by the LEE, and by Pch regulators, which are encoded at other loci. Here we identified genes whose transcription profiles were similar to those of the LEE genes, by comparing the effects of altering ler and pch transcript levels. We assigned these genes into two classes, according to their transcription profiles. By determining the binding profiles for Ler and Pch, we showed that both were involved in regulating one class of genes, but only Pch was involved in regulating the other class. Binding sites were found in the coding region as well as the promoter region of regulated genes, which include genes common to K12 strains as well as 0157-specific genes, suggesting that both act as a global regulator. These results indicate that Ler and Pch orchestrate the transcription of virulence genes, which are captured by horizontal transfer and scattered throughout the chromosome.1.

The major avenue for the acquisition of virulence genes is the horizontal transfer of DNA segments.1 In many pathogenic bacteria, multiple virulence factors function to achieve successful infection and population bursts in niches by protecting bacteria from host defense systems. Multiple virulence genes in different chromosomal loci must often be simultaneously expressed during the various stages of infection. Thus, the integration of the acquired genes, which are scattered throughout the chromosome, into the gene-regulatory systems is important for establishing pathogenic strains. Because the repertoire of virulence traits is often variable among the strains of the same species, bacterial pathogenicity is a dynamic process involving the ongoing addition of novel virulence genes. Therefore, plasticity that allows newly transferred virulence genes to be adopted must also be a characteristic of the virulence-regulatory system. To understand the emergence and evolution of pathogenic bacteria, therefore, the molecular basis of virulence gene regulation must be elucidated.Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) causes hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome.2 A comparison of the genomic sequences of EHEC O157:H7 Sakai strain with that of the non-pathogenic E. coli strain K-12 revealed many EHEC O157-specific loci (called S-loops), most of which contain gene clusters.3 One of the virulence-associated loci is the locus for enterocyte effacement (LEE), which encodes a type III secretion system (T3SS), type III secreted effectors, and adhesin. These virulence factors are necessary for the induction of attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions in epithelial cells, which are characterized by a rearrangement of the cytoskeleton and the destruction of microvilli.4,5 In addition to the LEE, gene-encoding effectors for T3SS can be found elsewhere on the chromosome,6 mostly at the end of lambdoid-like prophages, which are scattered throughout the chromosome.7 The mosaic nature of the pathogenic E. coli genome suggests that virulence traits are acquired through the capture of mobile elements such as phages, insertion sequences, and plasmids. In particular, lambdoid phage appears to have a major role in the emergence of EHEC strains, given that a variety of effector genes are encoded by several prophages lysogenized at different loci on the chromosome.7 Therefore, for pathogenicity to be established, the expression kinetics of genes in different chromosomal loci must be appropriately orchestrated.The transcription of LEE genes is regulated by two positive transcriptional regulators: Pch regulators activate the transcription of the LEE1 operon, which encodes the transcriptional regulator Ler, which in turn regulates other LEE operons and genes in other loci.8 Ler belongs to the H-NS family of nucleoid-associated proteins, exhibiting homology with the carboxy-termini of these proteins corresponding to DNA-binding domain.9 Ler has been shown to activate LEE gene expression by counteracting the repression by H-NS.10 EHEC strains possess five genes that encode homologs of Pch, though only two, pchA and pchB, activate LEE1 transcription.8 Pch is also a small protein as Ler, but it showed no homology with nucleoid-associated protein or transcription regulators. The expression of LEE genes is regulated in response to changes in environmental factors, such as the growth phase, temperature, osmolarity, bicarbonate ion concentration, membrane stress, and nutrient starvation.11–14 Both Pch and Ler are major regulators of LEE gene expression in response to such changes. For example, transient growth arrest caused by insufficient nutrients or by entry into the stationary growth phase induces the expression of LEE genes through increased production of both Pch and Ler, because the transcription of pch genes and the LEE1 operon is positively regulated by starvation-induced signal molecule, ppGpp.13 Furthermore, the activation of the RcsC–RcsD–RcsB phospho-relay system, which is thought to be a signal transduction system for responding membrane stress, affects the expression of LEE genes both positively and negatively through the activation of grvA, encoding a transcription regulator and the repression of pch.12 Thus, environmental factors are evaluated by a sensing system common to all E. coli strains. In EHEC O157:H7, however, the signals from the sensing system also affect the transcription of O157-specific transcription regulators, which results in the coordinated regulation of the virulence genes in response to certain environmental changes.In this study, in order to clarify which genes are involved in the pathogenicity of EHEC and the regulatory networks that govern the LEE and related genes, we isolated genes under the control of the two major virulence regulators, Pch and Ler, by comparing the changes in global transcription caused by altering the pch and ler expression levels. We identified two sets of genes whose transcription profiles were closely correlated with those of LEE genes. Furthermore, we determined the binding sites for PchA and Ler, and found that, although Pch was involved in the regulation of genes in both classes, Ler regulated the expression of only one class of genes.2. Materials and methods2.1. Bacterial strains and growth conditionsEHEC O157 Sakai (RIMD 0509952)3 and its derivative strains used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table S1. Deletion mutants of EHEC O157 Sakai were constructed using the method and plasmids of Datsenko and Wanner.15 DNA fragments corresponding to the pchA and ler genes were isolated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the chromosomal DNA of O157 Sakai using specific primers: 5'-CACAGGAATATATCCGTACCC-3' and 5'-AGTATGTGTCACTGGCCTATACGG-3' for pchA, and 5'-TTGGCTCACAATACTCATCC-3' and 5'-GCTTAACTAAATGGAAATGC-3' for ler. The PCR amplicon was cloned into pGEM-T (Promega) in the direction opposite to that of the lac promoter. The pchA gene of EHEC Sakai <U+0394>pchB <U+0394>pchC was tagged at the 3'-terminus with Strep-tag (IBA), and the ler gene in wild-type O157 Sakai was tagged with 3× FLAG sequence, using an epitope-tagging procedure.16 Bacteria were grown overnight in Luria-Bertani broth (LB), diluted 100-fold, and then cultured in LB or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) without fetal calf serum, at 37°C with shaking.2.2. Transcriptome analysisTotal RNA from EHEC was isolated with TRI reagent (Sigma) using the method recommended by the manufacturer. The RNA was purified again after treatment with RNase-free DNase I (Takara), and the amount and purity of the RNA were determined by measuring A260 and A280. The RNAs from EHEC were used to synthesize cDNAs with Cy-3- or Cy-5-conjugated dUTP. cDNA labeling, microarray hybridization, data capture, and data analysis were performed as described previously.12 We used a DNA microarray with oligo-DNAs specific for each of the CDS of EHEC O157 Sakai.12,17 The expression ratio used here is to indicate the average of the ratios obtained in the two independent experiments in which the signal intensities were greater than the mean ±1 SD of the negative control. The hierarchical clustering of gene expression profiles and conditions were analyzed using GeneSpring GX7.3 (Agilent Technologies). The raw and processed data are available in the GEO of NCBI (in accession no. GSE9752).2.3. Design of EHEC O157 tiled microarraysThe EHEC O157 Sakai genome sequence and other genetic information were retrieved from the O157 Web site at NAIST (http://genome.naist.jp/bacteria/o157/) and used to design probes, following the Affymetrix guidelines (http://www.affymetrix.com). Two versions of the microarray were used in this study. One contained 25-nt-long probe sequences separated by 103 (±5)-base intervals in the coding region and by intervals of 35 (±2) bases in the intergenic region along both strands of the O157 Sakai chromosome. The other contained 25-nt-long probe sequences separated by 45-base intervals, as possible, from only a single strand of the chromosome. If the sequence was not correct, the probe was offset with sequence within 10 bases. Thus, perfect-match probes and corresponding mismatch probes were synthesized on the chip.2.4. ChIP-on-chipChromosome immunoprecipitation and DNA microarray analysis were performed as described by Oshima et al.18 with slight modifications. EHEC O157 Sakai strain SKI1172 or SKI1282 was grown in DMEM to logarithmic phase (OD600 = 0.7 - 0.8) at 37°C. Formaldehyde (final concentration of 1%) was added to 10 mL of the culture, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 20 min. To terminate the crosslinking reaction, glycine (final concentration of 0.45 M) was added, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 5 min. Bacteria were collected by centrifugation and washed first with Tris buffered saline, then with washing buffer [50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8.0), 300 mM NaCl, 0.01% Tween-20] twice, suspended in 1 mL of lysis buffer [50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8.0), 300 mM NaCl, 1% Tween-20, 20 mg/mL lysozyme], and stored at -20°C until use. Bacteria were lysed by incubation at 37°C for 30 min and diluted in 4 mL of washing buffer containing phenylmethanesulphonylfluoride (final concentration of 1 mg/mL). The solution was then sonicated 15 times for 30 s at 30 s intervals at 4°C using a Bioruptor UCD-200 (Cosmo Bio Co., Ltd.). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 15 000 rpm for 30 min. An 800 µL aliquot of the supernatant was mixed with magnetic beads bound to an anti-FLAG antibody (M2 monoclonal antibody, Sigma-Aldrich) or MagStrep (IBA) antibody and incubated at 4°C overnight. The beads were washed three times with washing buffer and then with TE (10 mM Tris-HCL (pH8.0), 1 mM EDTA). The protein–DNA complex bound to the beads was released in 100 mL of elution buffer [50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mM EDTA, 1% SDS] by heating at 65°C for 20 min for Ler-FLAG, or in Biotin buffer [50 mM Tris (pH 7.8), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 10 mM Biotin] incubated at room temperature for 10 min for PchA-Strep. DNA fragments crosslinked to proteins were released by incubating the eluate with proteinase K (1 mg/mL) at 42°C for 2 h, then 65°C for 6 h, and purified using the Qiagen PCR Clean-up kit (Qiagen) in 200 µL of TE. Recovered DNA fragments were amplified, terminally labeled, and hybridized with the EHEC O157 tiled microarray as described previously.18 The raw intensity data (CEL files) were processed using the In Silico Molecular Cloning Array Edition software (In Silico Biology) for analysis and visualization. Signal intensities were obtained by subtracting the signal intensities of the mismatch probes from those of the perfect-match probes, and probes with negative values were excluded from further analysis. To compensate for differences among the probes caused by different probabilities of DNA disruption and hybridization efficiency, signals were normalized by dividing them by the signal intensities from DNA samples taken before the beads were added. The binding sites for PchA-Strep and Ler-FLAG were assessed manually. The reproducibility and specificity of binding of PchA or Ler to several novel sites were confirmed by ChIP-PCR for each site.3. Results and discussion3.1. Identification of Pch- and/or Ler-regulated genesThe genes in the LEE pathogenicity island are organized mainly into five operons, LEE1 to LEE5, and several cistrons. The transcription of the LEE genes is positively regulated by the Ler protein, which is encoded by the first gene of the LEE1 operon. Transcription of the LEE1 operon is regulated by several proteins conserved in the non-pathogenic E. coli K12 strain, including IHF, QseA, and H-NS, and by the O157-specific regulator, Pch.8,14,19,20 EHEC O157:H7 Sakai strain possesses three intact pch genes, which encode proteins that differ by only one or two amino acids, and are located in different prophage-like elements.To elucidate the network created by O157-specific regulators, the effect of the overproduction or deletion of Ler or Pch on global transcription levels was determined using DNA microarray hybridization. We determined differences in the transcript levels for all the genes in EHEC O157 Sakai strain in 13 comparisons (Fig. 1): ler null mutant against wild-type EHEC, a pchA-pchB-pchC triple mutant against wild type, EHEC harboring a high copy number of the ler or pchA gene against EHEC harboring a control vector, the ler mutant harboring a high copy number of the pchA gene against the ler mutant harboring the control vector, the pchA-pchB-pchC triple mutant harboring a high copy number of the ler gene against the pch triple-mutant harboring the control vector, and the pchA-pchB double mutant harboring a high copy number of ler against the double mutant harboring the control vector. Since the expression level of LEE genes in EHEC O157, when grown in tissue culture medium DMEM, is much higher than that in EHEC grown in LB, we included the differences in broth media as other factors affecting expression of EHEC genes. Except for the last case (grown in LB), all comparisons were carried out for bacteria grown in LB and DMEM.Hierarchical cluster analysis of gene expression changes in response to changes in Pch or Ler levels.

The scale bar indicates color coding of the RNA levels. Class L1 with subclasses I and II, class L2, and class N are indicated (see text).The EHEC genes were subjected to clustering analysis by standard correlation to determine their transcript expression patterns (Fig. 1). As expected, genes belonging to the LEE showed similar expression profiles, and we classified them as part of a single group, class L1, which also included genes that were not encoded within the LEE (Fig. 2). Within the LEE-encoded genes of class L1, there were two distinct subgroups. One subgroup contained all the LEE1 operon genes except ler, and the other contained most of the other LEE genes (Supplementary Table S2). We found that the transcript levels of the LEE1 genes were increased by PchA overexpression in both wild-type EHEC and the ler deletion mutant, but the transcript levels of the other LEE genes were enhanced by PchA overexpression only in the presence of the ler gene. Because the transcript data were obtained from ler null mutant or from strains harboring multiple copies of ler, the ler gene itself could not be classified in this experiment.Characteristics of genes in each cluster. Number of genes in three gene classes, L1, L2 and N, which were isolated by transcriptomic analysis, was shown. Genes were sorted by chromosomal locus and function as follows: black, LEE genes; grey, non-LEE virulence-associated genes; light grey, other genes in S-loop; white, genes on K12-common loci.Characteristics of genes in each cluster.

Genes were sorted by chromosomal locus and function as follows: black, LEE genes; grey, non-LEE virulence-associated genes; light grey, other genes in S-loop; white, genes on K12-common loci.The three class L1 effector genes that lie outside the LEE were nleA, espF-U/tccP, and espJ. The nleA/espI gene is a single cistron on prophage Sp9 and is required for Citrobacter rodentium, an A/E mouse pathogen, to colonize the mouse colon.21EspF-U/TccP is necessary for the recruitment of actin to Tir beneath attached bacteria, which is essential for A/E lesion formation.22,23 Two genes, espF-U/tccP and espJ, are located on lambdoid-like prophage Sp14 and constitute an operon.24,25 Since the espF-M gene of EHEC O157 Sakai is a pseudogene,23 it is likely that espF-M was detected because of cross-hybridization with espF-U/tccP. Finally, class L1 included three unknown O157-specific genes in an S-loop, ECs0355, ECs0356, ECs0814, and the plasmid-born gene tagA. In addition, the transcription levels of three genes common to EHEC O157:H7 and K-12 in the E. coli backbone chromosome were regulated in close correlation with the LEE genes. These genes, ECs0512 (ylaD), ECs0513 (hha), and ECs0514 (ybaJ), are likely to comprise an operon. The hha gene encodes a transcription regulator for ler.26The expression profile of the class L1 cluster was correlated with that of another cluster of genes. We designated these genes as class L2 (Fig. 1). Class L2 contained 140 CDS/genes, consisting of 89 genes in an S-loop and 51 genes in the backbone or K-12 common chromosome (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table S3). Although the transcript levels of the class L2 genes increased with increased Pch levels, like the genes in class L1, their response to increased levels of Ler was different, in that the L2 transcript levels increased only slightly with the overexpression of Ler when grown in LB. In contrast, the genes in L1 showed a marked increase in transcript level with high levels of Ler, even in LB.Class L2 contained 20 non-LEE effector genes that encode T3SS-secreted proteins. Most of these effector genes are located on exchangeable effector loci (EEL) of lambda-like prophages,7 including Sp3, Sp6, Sp9, Sp10, Sp11, Sp17, and SpLE3 (Fig. 2). This observation of the expression and T3SS-dependent secretion of these effectors when the EHEC harbored a high copy number of the pchA gene is consistent with our previous report.7 All the effectors, except EspM2 (encoded by ECs3485), that were found in the culture supernatant of EHEC were regulated coordinately with the LEE genes. The expression of another effector gene, ECs4653, which encodes EspY4, was also upregulated by Ler and Pch, just like the other non-LEE effector genes.Some genes were regulated in conjunction with their neighbors because of members of the same operon. One cluster of these genes, ECs0240–ECs0245, lies in the rhsI element, which is one of nine rhs elements in EHEC O157 Sakai. ECs0815 and ECs0816 seem to belong to the same operon and are transcribed in the opposite direction from ECs0814, which belongs to class L1. Another cluster of genes, from ECs3512 to ECs3508, seems to comprise an operon that lies at the end of prophage-like element Sp17. In addition, class L2 included genes for type-II secretion machinery (etpC, etpD, etpE, etpH, and etpK), toxB, and hemolysin (hlyD) on the virulence plasmid pO157 (Supplementary Table S3).One cluster of genes showed a negative correlation in their transcription with changes in Ler or Pch expression (shown as class N in Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table S4). Most drastically affected were genes associated with an acid-resistant phenotype, which are closely clustered on the chromosome. These genes include hdeA, hdeB, hdeD, gadE (yhiE), gadX, and gadW. One hundred and nineteen genes conserved between K12 and EHEC O157 and 27 O157-specific genes on S-loops formed clusters (Fig. 2). These genes showed very similar changes in transcript levels in response to changes in Ler/Pch levels. Several genes in this class, in addition to gadE, gadX, and gadW, regulate glutamate-dependent acid resistance. The EvgS–EvgA two-component regulatory system controls the expression of gadE, and transcription of the gadXW operon is dependent on alternative sigma factor RpoS, whose gene was also included in this class. Several of these factors, including GadE (YhiE), EvgS–EvgA, and RpoS, negatively affect the expression of LEE genes or bacterial adherence.27–29 Although the ClpXP protease has been shown to contribute indirectly to the expression of the LEE genes,28 the transcription of the clpX–clpP genes was negatively regulated by Ler and Pch.3.2. Identification of binding sites for Pch and LerAlthough transcriptomic analyses revealed that Pch and/or Ler affect the transcription of many genes on S-loops and in the backbone or K-12 common chromosome, the transcript levels of some of them might be regulated indirectly, through proteins from genes that are directly regulated by Pch and/or Ler. To distinguish directly regulated genes from indirectly regulated genes, we determined the binding sites of PchA and Ler on the EHEC O157 Sakai chromosome by chromosome immunoprecipitation (ChIP) or chromosome affinity precipitation, in combination with DNA microarray hybridization. A derivative strain of EHEC O157 Sakai that expresses Strep-tagged PchA (PchA-Strep) or FLAG-tagged Ler (Ler-FLAG) was grown in DMEM to the logarithmic growth phase at 37°C, which is the optimal condition for expression of the LEE genes, and treated with formalin to crosslink the DNA with bound proteins. DNA fragments that bound to PchA-Strep or Ler-FLAG were separated from the bacterial lysate with Strep-Tactin-coated magnetic beads (MagStrep) or anti-FLAG-conjugated magnetic beads. After decrosslinking and purification, the DNA fragments that bound to PchA or Ler were mapped by hybridization with a high-density tiled microarray. We found 259 loci for Pch and 59 for Ler on the chromosome (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Tables S5 and S6). Of these, 43.1% of the Pch-bound loci and 39.0% of the Ler-bound loci were in S-loops or junctions with S-loops and in the backbone or K12-common chromosome. Considering that only 25.5% of the chromosome was unique to the EHEC O157 Sakai strain compared with E. coli K12 strain MG1655, it was clear that Pch and Ler preferentially bound to S-loop sequences rather than to the backbone or K12-common chromosome.Distribution of PchA and Ler binding over the EHEC O157 Sakai chromosome.

Vertical bars indicate the relative hybridization intensity of the precipitated DNA compared with DNA in the supernatant.The expression of the LEE genes is positively regulated by a molecular cascade: Pch is a positive transcriptional regulator for the LEE1 promoter.8 Activation of the LEE1 operon leads to the expression of Ler, which activates the other LEE genes in operons LEE2 to LEE5 and several cistrons. As expected, Pch bound to the LEE1 promoter region (Fig. 4A). In addition, Pch bound to sites throughout the LEE sequence, including the coding region of the LEE1 operon. Furthermore, although the binding was weaker than in the LEE1 operon, Pch bound to other parts of the LEE island: the upstream region of the grlR–grlA operon, the 5' portions of the LEE2 and LEE3 operons, the downstream portion of the LEE3 operon, the upstream portion of tir, the coding region of cesT, and the downstream portion of eae. Ler bound at similar levels to several regions in the LEE island, mostly in the 5' regions of operons or genes (Fig. 4A): the intergenic regions between LEE1 and espG and between grlR and ECs4579 (rorf3), the 5' portions of the LEE2 and LEE3 operons, the intergenic region between cesF and map, and the 5' regions of escD and sepL.Distribution of PchA and Ler binding in the LEE and EELs.

The binding loci for Pch and Ler were unevenly distributed in these acquired sequences. They rarely bound to sequences conserved among the phages; rather, they mostly bound to sequences that were unique to each phage element. Nine lambdoid-like phage elements and two phage-like elements possess EEL, which encode the majority of functional effector genes. Binding loci of Pch were detected within the EEL of all phage elements and Ler-binding loci were detected within the EEL of Sp9, Sp14, and SpLE4 (including LEE) (Fig. 4). Among EHEC O157-specific loci, the locus that contains genes for synthesis of polysaccharide moieties of lipopolysaccharide was bound by both Pch and Ler. Other locus that was covered by Pch was ETT2 locus encodes incomplete type III secretion system with truncated substrate genes. Fourteen loci encoding a set of fimbriae biosynthesis genes were identified on EHEC O157 Sakai chromosome. Pch was bound upstream part of 11 fimbriae operons and three of them were also bound by Ler. They include three loci that are conserved in K-12 strain and four loci that are partially conserved in K-12 strain.Although most regions bound by Pch ranged from 0.3 to 0.8 kb, several loci showed binding that extended to as much as 3.0 kb. Of the 59 Ler-binding loci, 46 overlapped with the Pch-binding loci, and all the Ler-binding loci in S-loops also bound Pch. Because of the low resolution of ChIP-chip analysis, we could not identify a consensus sequence for the Pch-binding sites other than that they are of lower G + C content than average of E. coli chromosome. These results suggested that both Pch and Ler are DNA-binding proteins with a low binding specificity.3.3. Correlation between gene transcription profiles and binding by Pch and/or LerWe next considered whether there were differences in binding by Pch and Ler in the L1 and L2 gene classes. Although most of effector genes were transcriptionally activated by Pch, they were classified into two distinctive classes by transcription profiles. Ten effector genes in class L1—seven in the LEE island and three outside it—were regulated coordinately with other LEE genes that function in the biosynthesis of the type III secretion machinery. Both Pch and Ler bound to the upstream or coding sequences of all three L1 prophage-associated effector genes, nleA (ECs1812), espJ (ECs2714), and espF-u/tccP (ECs2715) (Fig. 4D and F), strongly suggesting the direct activation of their transcription through coordinate binding by Pch and Ler.Twenty-one class L2 effector genes were located on seven prophage-like elements scattered throughout the chromosome. In contrast to class L1 effector genes, although Pch bound in and around the L2 effector gene sequences, Ler binding was not detected in many cases (Fig. 4B–E, G, and H). Positions of binding loci of Pch relative to effector genes vary among genes. For example, Pch bound upstream of nleC, nleA, nleG8-2, whereas binding to coding regions were observed for espX7, espN, espJ, and espL2. In the EEL of Sp10, two Pch-binding loci were found upstream and downstream of a cluster of three nleG genes. Three L2 effector genes, nleG5-2 (ECs2154), nleG6-2 (ECs2155), and nleG2-3 (ECs2156), on Sp11 bound Pch only at upstream of the gene cluster. Since the probes for nleG5-2, nleG6-2, and nleG2-3 used in the DNA microarray for transcriptome analysis were the same as for nleG5-1 (ECs1996), nleG6-1 (ECs1995), and nleG2-2 (ECs1994) on Sp11, respectively, it is likely that the signals we detected originated only from the genes on Sp10 and that the genes on Sp11 were less expressed. These binding data suggested that the effector genes in class L2 were directly activated by Pch without Ler.Of the 57 genes in class L1, only three S-loop genes and two K-12 common genes showed no binding by PchA or Ler (Supplementary Table S1). Rather, 68.6% of the L1 S-loop genes bound both Pch and Ler, as did 50% of the L1 backbone or K-12 common genes (Fig. 5). Therefore, most class L1 genes, including those on the backbone, are probably directly regulated by Pch and Ler. However, among the L2 genes, more than half bound neither Pch nor Ler, suggesting that their transcription was regulated indirectly by these proteins. As shown for the effector genes, the non-effector class L2 genes that bound Pch, but not Ler, were much more abundant than those that bound both (Fig. 5 and Table 2). 66.6% of Pch-bound genes were not bound by Ler. This suggested that the transcriptional regulation of the class L2 genes was, overall, directly regulated by Pch without the involvement of Ler.Correlation between Pch and/or Ler binding with transcription profiles.

These 40 backbone or K-12 common genes and 11 S-loop genes seemed to be directly regulated by Pch and/or Ler (Table 3). They include genes encoding regulators, yhiF, gadE, gadX, and gadW, and their regulating genes, gadB, hdeA, hdeB, and hdeD. Two genes, yhiF and gadE, inhibit the expression of LEE genes,27 suggesting there is a reciprocal negative interaction between the Pch–Ler virulence regulatory system and the YhiF–GadE regulatory system.ORFs in cluster N with binding sites for Pch/Ler*P, Pch; L, Ler; P + L, Pch and Ler.ORFs in cluster N with binding sites for Pch/Ler*P, Pch; L, Ler; P + L, Pch and Ler.3.4. Global regulation to promote the efficient expression of virulence traitsPch is a 12-kDa protein without significant homology to any transcriptional regulatory proteins except PerC (also called BfpW),30,31 which is encoded on a virulence plasmid of enteropathogenic E. coli. The pch genes encode a transcriptional activator for the LEE1 promoter, and the deletion of pchA and pchB genes greatly reduces the production and secretion of EspB and EspA.8 The introduction of multiple copies of the pchA gene into EHEC O157 enhances the production and secretion of effector proteins, including many non-LEE encoded effectors,7 indicating that Pch is involved in the regulation of non-LEE effector genes as well as of LEE genes. Our study clearly demonstrated that Pch acts as a global regulator of many genes scattered throughout the EHEC O157 chromosome and plasmids. As expected, most effector genes in the EEL on prophage-like elements were positively regulated by Pch. The molecular mechanism of transcriptional activation by Pch may not be simple, since the position of its binding site varied from gene to gene, as did the number of binding sites. Therefore, Pch probably uses a transcriptional activating mechanism that is different from that of a typical transcriptional activator, like an AraC-like protein, which activates transcription by binding upstream of the promoter and interacting with RNA polymerase. The binding of Pch in the coding region or downstream of its target genes suggested that Pch affects promoter activity without directly interacting with RNA polymerase, most likely by inducing changes in the chromosomal structure around the promoter. We could not identify a consensus sequence for Pch binding, besides low G + C content, from the ChIP on chip data, because of low resolution. To characterize more precisely, further analysis such as footprinting must be required.The analysis of transcription profiles revealed that the transcriptional responses of genes in class L1 to changes in the levels of Pch and Ler were slightly different from those of the class L2 genes. Ler binding may be required to activate most class L1 promoters, and these promoters were activated in the absence of Pch as efficiently as in its presence. Although the transcript levels of several L2 genes could be increased in a Pch-negative background by overexpressing Ler, the increase was much smaller than that obtained by the overexpression of Pch. It is likely that Ler was primarily a regulator for a restricted group of genes that are functionally related to the A/E phenotype as compared to Pch. It is supported by one of the non-LEE-encoded effectors, TccP/EspFu, which is required for actin polymerization at the cytoplasmic domain of Tir.22,23 In addition, the nleA (espI) gene of C. rodentium, a mouse A/E pathogen, is involved in the colonization of mouse colon and the induction of hyperplasia.21,32 Finally, since the ler gene is LEE gene, the Ler target genes might primarily be LEE genes.In the process of establishing the pathogenicity of EHEC, genes encoding proteins with A/E phenotype-related functions might be selected and placed under the direct control of Ler. Pch seems to have a broader role in regulating gene expression, since its binding sites were scattered over the chromosome. EHEC O157:H7 Sakai possesses five pch genes, including at least two encoding active proteins and two truncated pseudogenes, on different prophage-like elements.8,13 Furthermore, multiple pch genes are found among EHEC O157 strains and other serotypes of EHEC strains, such as O26, O111, and O103 (Ogura et al., unpublished). These findings suggest that Pch is required for the expression of virulence genes and that the pch gene itself is rather unstable.Horizontally transferred genes are thought to be initially repressed by the binding of H-NS to the DNA around them.18,33 Pch might counteract the effect of H-NS, both by activating the horizontally acquired genes and influencing the expression of genes in the backbone or K-12 common chromosome. The global effect of Pch on both EHEC-specific and K-12 common genes must be to promote the integration of the acquired genes with a virulence regulon and to govern the optimization of virulence expression. Because changing the expression levels of some K-12 common genes could have an adverse effect on bacterial physiology, the virulence-regulatory system must be strictly controlled and activated only when it is required. In fact, the evidence shows that the activation of the virulence-regulatory system is strictly regulated in response to environmental signals, through the expression of both pch and ler.12,13 Thus, the virulence-regulatory system involving Pch and Ler is a good model for understanding the process of the evolution of pathogenicity and the emergence of novel pathogens.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available online at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Priority Areas (C) from The Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology of Japan.Supplementary data"

Moreover, it is also recognized as an opportunistic pathogen responsible for various infectious diseases. Here, we report the complete genome sequence of F. magna ATCC 29328. The genome consists of a 1 797 577 bp circular chromosome and an 189 163 bp plasmid (pPEP1). The metabolic maps constructed based on the genome information confirmed that most F. magna strains cannot ferment most sugars, except fructose, and have various aminopeptidase activities. Three homologs of albumin-binding protein, a known virulence factor useful for antiphagocytosis, are encoded on the chromosome, and one albumin-binding protein homolog is encoded on the plasmid. A unique feature of the genome is that F. magna encodes many sortase genes, of which substrates may be involved in bacterial pathogenesis, such as antiphagocytosis and adherence to the host cell. The plasmid pPEP1 encodes seven sortase and seven substrate genes, whereas the chromosome encodes four sortase and 19 substrate genes. These plasmid-encoded sortases may play important roles in the pathogenesis of F. magna by enriching the variety of cell wall anchored surface proteins.1. IntroductionGram-positive anaerobic cocci (GPAC) are a major part of the normal human flora colonizing skin and mucous membranes of the mouth and gastrointestinal tracts. GPAC account for 20–40% of all anaerobes recovered from human clinical specimens.1–3 In GPAC, Finegoldia magna (formerly Peptostreptococcus magnus) has the highest pathogenicity and is isolated most frequently from various infection sites, including soft tissue, bone and joint, and diabetic foot infections.1 Approximately 70% of F. magna strains recovered from human clinical materials coexist with other bacterial species such as group D streptococci, Staphylococcus, Bacteroides, and Fusobacterium.4Finegoldia magna has well-known cell surface proteins such as albumin-binding protein and protein L, which may contribute to antiphagocytosis by binding the cell surface to human serum albumin and immunoglobulin light chain, respectively.5–7 Despite this clinical importance of F. magna, other virulence factors and overall genomic information of F. magna have not been extensively studied. Therefore, we have so far constructed the physical map8 and the genetic map9,10 of F. magna strain ATCC 29328, originally isolated from an abdominal wound.Here, we report the complete genome sequence of F. magna ATCC 29328 to characterize its genomic structure in detail and its nature as an opportunistic pathogen. This is the first complete genome sequence among GPAC, and we believe our data will be of great use for genetic studies of other GPAC as well as F. magna.2. Materials and methods2.1. Genome sequencingThe nucleotide sequence of the Finegoldia magna ATCC 29328 genome was determined by a whole-genome shotgun strategy. Briefly, F. magna ATCC 29328 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and was grown anaerobically at 37°C in liquid using Gifu Anaerobic Medium (GAM) (Nissui, Japan) for 39 h. The genomic DNA was isolated according to the conventional method using 0.4 mg/mL achromopeptidase (Wako, Japan), 1.3% sodium dodecyl sulfate and 2 mg Proteinase K (Roche, Germany). The isolated DNA was fragmented using the HydroShear process (GeneMachines Inc., USA). The fragmented DNA was fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis to isolate the short (1–2 kb) and the long (4–5 kb) fractions of fragments. The 1–2 kb and 4-5 kb DNA were ligated into a HincII-digested pTS1 plasmid vector (Nippon genetech, Japan). The short-insert and the long-insert plasmids were introduced by electroporation into Escherichia coli DH5a and SURE2 (Stratagene, USA), respectively. A total of 38 776 reads (providing a 10-fold coverage) from both ends of inserts was sequenced using dye-terminator chemistry with MegaBACE1000, MegaBACE4000 (GE Healthcare, USA) and ABI 3037xl automated sequencers (ABI, USA). Sequence assembly was carried out using the Phred/Phrap/Consed package.11 Gaps were closed by PCR direct sequencing with oligonucleotide primers designed to anneal to each end of the neighboring contigs and by primer walking with bridge clones. Sequences of four rRNA operons were independently determined by genomic PCR and with BAC library.9,10 Sequencing of one long repeated region on the chromosome was performed by nested-deletion methods using Kilo-sequence deletion kit (Takara, Japan). Finally, sequences of one complete circular chromosome and one complete plasmid were obtained. Overall accuracy of the finished sequence was estimated to have an error rate of <1 per 10 000 bases (Phrap score =40).2.2. BioinformaticsProtein coding regions (ORFs >150 bp) were identified using GenomeGambler 1.51,12 CRITICA,13 GeneHacker,14 and Glimmer 2.015 programs. In the initial step of ORF prediction, 205 ORFs showing high similarity to the housekeeping proteins in the Clusters of Orthologous Groups of Proteins (COGs) database16 were selected and used to create the training data set for CRITICA, GeneHacker, and Glimmer programs. Individual predicted ORFs were reviewed manually for the presence of start codons (ATG, TTG, and GTG) and ribosome-binding sequences. Protein functional annotation was based on homology searches against NCBI's non-redundant protein database by BLASTP.17 Transfer RNA genes were predicted by tRNAscan-SE.18 Functional classification of ORFs was made by homology search against COGs using BLASTP. The metabolic pathway was constructed based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database19 and was complemented manually according to pathways reported in several anaerobes.20–23 Putative localization of predicted proteins was evaluated by the combination of PSORT24 and SignalP program.25 The characteristic motifs in all protein-coding sequence of ATCC 29328 genome were detected by the Pfam analyses (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/) and COGs database. Sortase homologs and their substrates from the sequences of 15 chromosomes and 30 plasmids derived from 15 Gram-positive bacteria species (include F. magna ATCC 29328), whose both chromosomes and plasmids were sequenced to date, were identified in silico according to methods described by Comfort and Clubb.26 The genomic sequences and the protein tables of bacteria were obtained through the NCBI (National Center of Biological Information, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). The complete genome sequence and annotation data of F. magna ATCC 29328 is available from the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank database (accession nos. AP008971 and AP008972) and our web site (http://w4.grt.kyushu-u.ac.jp/Fmagna/).3. Results and discussion3.1. General genome featuresThe genome of F. magna ATCC 29328 consists of a circular chromosome (1 797 577 bp) and a plasmid pPEP1 (189 163 bp), with an average G + C content of 32.3 and 29.7%, respectively (Fig. 1 and Table 1). The chromosome size was in good agreement with the size (1886 ± 62 kb) estimated in the physical map which we constructed previously.8 The recognition sites of ApaI, PmeI, SgrAI, and I-CeuI in our physical map8 and the locations of ORFs in our genetic map9,10 were in nearly agreement with those in the complete genome sequence, except missing of an ApaI-fragment (94 bp) in the chromosomal physical map and a inversion of PmeI fragments in the plasmid physical map. We could not find any regions showing significantly higher G + C content on the chromosome, except for four rRNA operon regions (Fig. 1). In the chromosome, we identified 1631 ORFs (FMG_0001–FMG_1631), covering 90.8% of the chromosome. Of these, 1177 (72.1%) could be assigned a putative function, 329 (20.2%) are conserved but the function unknown, and 125 (7.7%) are hypothetical genes unique to F. magna (Table 1). The replication origin of the chromosome was deduced on the basis of the transition point in GC-skew analysis and the vicinal presence of dnaA box.27 A strong bias in gene orientation was observed, as 83.8% of ORFs on the chromosome are transcribed in the same orientation as DNA replication. Similarly, high bias in the gene orientation was observed in the genomes of Clostridium perfringens strain 1320 and Clostridium tetani E88,21 respectively, and appears to be a common feature of low-GC Gram-positive bacteria.20,28,29 Plasmid pPEP1 encodes 182 ORFs (FMG_P0001–FMG_P0182). Of these, 45 (24.7%) could be assigned a putative function, 29 (15.9%) are conserved but the function unknown, and 108 (59.4%) are hypothetical genes (Table 1). The replication origin of the plasmid could not be deduced by GC-skew analysis. Of the total ORFs on the plasmid, 87.4% were encoded on one strand DNA (Fig. 1). The F. magna genome encodes only a few mobile genetic elements. The density of transposase genes per 1 Mb of chromosome in low-GC Gram-positive bacteria ranges from high (10.5 per Mb) in Streptococcus pyogenes MGAS8283 to low (3.63 per Mb) in C. perfringens strain 13. F. magna ATCC 29328 has only one transposase gene (FMG_0928) (0.56 per Mb) on the chromosome. In the plasmid, 14 putative transposase genes were encoded, but four out of 14 were truncated. F. magna has nine putative phage-related ORFs on the chromosome; however, these genes do not constitute a prophage region. Assuming that F. magna is closely related to clostridia10, F. magna has a stable chromosome, like clostridia, and recent events of gene acquisition by horizontal gene transfer are less likely.20–22Circular maps of the chromosome and the pPEP1 plasmid of F. magna ATCC 29328.

Sugar and amino acid metabolismsMost F. magna have a variety of aminopeptidase activities30; however, they have very limited saccharolytic activities.1,31 It is known that most F. magna strains produce weak acid from the fermentation of fructose, and only a few strains produce weak acid from glucose, and all strains tested were unable to produce acid from maltose, mannose, and sucrose.1,31 We found that F. magna ATCC 29328 has a complete glycolysis pathway only for fructose (Supplementary Fig. S1). Fructose could be taken in by a phosphotransferase system (PTS) for fructose and fed into glycolysis followed by production of acetate as a major end product. However, PTS genes for glucose, maltose, mannose, glucitol, cellobiose, and lactose were absent in the F. magna genome. PTS for mannitol, galactitol, and sucrose were incomplete.The tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle of F. magna ATCC 29328 was incomplete; only the step from pyruvate to fumarate was present (Supplementary Fig. S1). Similarly, incompleteness of the TCA cycle in clostridia such as C. tetani, C. acetobutylicum, and C. perfringens also has been reported.20–22F. magna ATCC 29328 has only gene sets for the production of acetate (and ethanol); although clostridia have complete gene sets for production of butyrate, acetate, lactate, and ethanol.20–22We also constructed a metabolic map of amino acid degradation to investigate which amino acids are used for energy acquisition in F. magna (Supplementary Fig. S1). The metabolic map showed that F. magna ATCC 29328 converts at least five amino acids (glycine, serine, threonine, aspartate, and asparagine) into pyruvate, and produces acetate and ATP. The metabolic map also showed that three (glycine, serine, and threonine) out of the five amino acids lead to NH3 production. As to amino acid biosynthesis pathways, F. magna ATCC 29328 has the complete gene sets required for biosynthesis of only five amino acids (glycine, serine, threonine, aspartate, and asparagine), suggesting that many of amino acids must be taken in from the environment (Supplementary Fig. S1). F. magna ATCC 29328 has many amino acid/oligopeptide transporters, enabling it to utilize amino acids as a major energy source by taking amino acids from the environment. As reported previously, F. magna has more aminopeptidase activities than other GPAC species.30 Bacterial aminopeptidases are generally regarded as a tissue-degrading enzyme and bacteria can utilize the degradation products as a nutrient source. In F. magna ATCC 29328 genome, four carboxypeptidase genes and six aminopeptidase genes including a Xaa-Pro aminopeptidase gene were found. These peptidase genes may contribute to bacterial growth and could account for higher pathogenicity of F. magna in GPAC.Finegoldia magna ATCC 29328 has at least 249 transport-related genes, accounting for 15.3% of the total ORFs. Of them, 49 ATP-binding cassette transporter systems (ABC transporters) could be identified on the basis of the similarities with ABC transporters from E. coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis.32–34 These ABC transporters were divided into 14 importers (e.g., amino acid/oligopeptide importers) and 35 exporters (e.g., putative multidrug exporters) (Supplementary Fig. S1). We also found other types of transporters such as electron, ion, a fructose-specific PTS, amino acid/oligopeptide, and multidrug-efflux transporters. Finegoldia magna has two vacuolar (V)-type ATPases (one is similar to an ATPase of C. tetani and another is similar to that of Fusobacterium nucleatum), but it has no F0F1-type ATPase.3.3. Regulation and stress responsesTranscriptional and translational regulators, and stress responses of F. magna are poorly understood. Finegoldia magna ATCC 29328 has an RNA polymerase core enzyme (composed of RpoA, RpoB, RpoC, and RpoZ subunits), a major sigma factor, and two general stress sigma factors, but it has no an ECF-type sigma factor,35,36 which has been found in several Gram-positive bacteria. Finegoldia magna encodes 12 two-component regulator systems consisting of 13 sensor histidine kinases and 12 response regulators. An autoinducer-2 production protein LuxS related to a quorum-sensing system was encoded in the chromosome. The F. magna genome encodes no superoxide dismutase gene, but encodes genes for superoxide reductase, NADH oxidase, and putative NADH dehydrogenase. These genes may play a major role in enabling the organism to survive in intermediate aerobic conditions, such as mucosa and skin.3.4. Virulence factorsPutative virulence factors were screened from all ORFs of F. magna ATCC 29328 genome by BLAST, SignalP, PSORT, and Pfam analyses. We found some putative virulence-related proteins with signal sequences and characteristic motifs (Supplementary Table S1). Interestingly, the F. magna ATCC 29328 genome encodes the following four albumin-binding protein homologs: three (FMG_1501, FMG_1517, and FMG_1523) in the chromosome and one (FMGP_0118) in the plasmid. These four proteins have regions similar to the albumin-binding modules (GA module)6,37,38 in PAB and urPAB proteins derived from F. magna ALB8 and ALB1B strains, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S2). These GA modules were also found in protein G from group C and G streptococci and in the protein L-like molecule from F. magna strain 3316.39,40Other virulence factors, except albumin-binding protein and protein L, have not been well studied in F. magna. In the ATCC 29328 genome, we found ten collagen adhesion protein homologs (Supplementary Table S1). These proteins possess several domains similar to the B-type domain (Pfam accession PF05738) in a collagen adhesion protein (Cna) derived from Staphylococcus aureus.41 Furthermore, the ATCC 29328 genome encodes 20 N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase homologs (Cwp66 homologs) (Supplementary Table S1). These homologs have several putative cell wall binding repeat 2 (Pfam accession PF04122) motifs. The PF04122 motif is identified in autolysin and Cwp66, an adhesin of Clostridium difficile.42 The Cwp66 has been suggested as a multifunctional protein42; the C-terminal domain of Cwp66 gave partial adherence ability of C. difficile to host cells, the N-terminal domain has homology to some autolysins and could contribute to autolysis. We are interested in whether Cwp66 homologs of F. magna can act as adhesins to host cells, since the Cwp66 of C. difficile has partial adherence ability and are regarded as a virulence factor. Moreover, the ATCC 29328 genome encodes putative virulence factors such as a cell wall-associated serine proteinase precursor (FMG_0035) and a putative biofilm-associated surface protein (FMG_1333) (Supplementary Table S1).Taken together, the pathogenic F. magna ATCC 29328 has several antiphagocytotic proteins such as albumin-binding proteins, and multiple putative host cell adhesins such as collagen adhesion proteins and Cwp66 homologs. Although the functions of these adhesins are not yet understood, future studies should disclose the mechanisms of virulence and the significance of F. magna as a member of the normal human flora.An extracellular transpeptidase, sortase, catalyzes cell wall anchoring of surface proteins by cleaving the threonine and glycine residues of conserved LPXTG-like motif.43–46 Sortases (SrtA, SrtB) from Staphylococcus aureus were identified first and have been well studied recently.47,48 Since some pathogens deficient in sortases exhibit reduced virulence, much interest has been focussed on sortase as a target for new antimicrobial agents.43–46 Recently, Comfort and Clubb identified sortases and their substrates (surface proteins with the LPXTG-like motif) in silico from 241 bacterial chromosomes (96 species) sequenced completely, and they predicted some functional sortase–substrate linkages.26 By the same method with Comfort, we identified sortases and their substrates from the ATCC 29328 genome and several Gram-positive bacterial genomes.The ATCC 29328 chromosome encoded four sortase homologs and 19 putative substrates (Figs. 1 and 2A and Table 2; Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). These 19 putative substrates include two albumin-binding protein homologs (FMG_1517 and FMG_1523) and putative biofilm-associated surface protein (FMG_1333), which may act as virulence factor (Table 2; Supplementary Tables S1 and S3). Most interestingly, seven sortase homologs and seven substrates were identified from the plasmid pPEP1 (Figs. 1 and 2B and Table 2; Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). These seven substrates include an albumin-binding protein homolog (FMG_P0118) and four putative collagen adhesion proteins (FMG_P0123, FMG_P0125, FMG_P0146, and FMG_P0149) (Table 2; Supplementary Tables S1 and S3).Sortase homologs and substrates identified in silico from Gram-positive bacterial genomes.

These motifs were identified according to the methods of Comfort and Clubb.26†Categorization into subfamilies according to sequence homology using PSI-BLAST profiles and a hidden Markov model.‘3’ and ‘—’ show the subfamily-3 and the unclassified subfamily, respectively, which were defined by Comfort.26‡‘Yes’ shows that a sortase is genomically adjacent to its substrate.By the same method with Comfort, we predicted functional sortase–substrate linkages for all sortases and substrates identified from the tested genomes. From the ATCC 29328 genome, we predicted some linkage among two sortases (FMG_0189 and FMG_0190) and two substrates (FMG_0187 and FMG_0188), because these four ORFs belong to a common family (Family 3 defined by Comfort) and are located on one cluster in the chromosome (Table 2; Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). The remaining sortases and substrates of F. magna were assigned to an unclassified family (defined by Comfort), and their sortase–substrate linkages could not be predicted. Assuming that an unclassified substrate and its sortase in a common genomic cluster may have some functional linkage,26 eight out of the 24 unclassified substrates can be linked to their specific sortases (Table 2; Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). These predicted sortase–substrate linkages on the genome should be further elucidated experimentally. For example, if we can identify a sortase that specifically recognize the LPKAG motif in albumin-binding proteins, it will lead to the development of sortase inhibitors as new antimicrobial agents.43To our knowledge, the pPEP1 plasmid may have the largest number of sortase genes among Gram-positive bacterial plasmids analysed so far, because we searched sortases and their substrates in 29 plasmids of 14 Gram-positive bacterial species, except for F. magna, and found that no plasmids have a sortase gene, except for C. perfringens str.13 plasmid (pCP13) with a sortase gene (PCP56) (Fig. 2B; Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). We could not find a remarkable feature about the number of sortases and substrates among Gram-positive bacterial chromosomes (Fig. 2A). The presence of as many as seven sortase genes in a plasmid may be unique to F. magna, since there are no sortase genes even on the large plasmids of the following Gram-positive species: Bacillus anthracis pXO1 (181 677 bp), Bacillus cereus pBc10987 (208 369 bp), and C. acetobutylicum pSOL1 (192 000 bp).3.5. ConclusionsThis is the first report of a whole genome sequence of a member of any known GPAC. The sequence information presented and analysed here will contribute to an understanding of the taxonomy and pathogenicity of GPAC. The reason why F. magna is isolated most frequently and has the highest pathogenicity in GPAC may be due to the fact that F. magna genome encodes abundant aminopeptidases, multiple transporters and some virulence factors (e.g., albumin-binding proteins, Cwp66 homologs, and collagen adhesion proteins), beside with the limited capabilities of F. magna for sugar utilization and amino acid biosynthesis. It is of particular interest that four sortase genes were identified on the chromosome and that seven sortase genes were identified on the plasmid. Seven plasmid-encoded sortase genes unique to F. magna are of special interest, considering that plasmids are commonly considered to be of foreign origin. These mobile element-encoded sortases may play important roles in the pathogenesis of F. magna by enriching the variety of cell wall anchored surface proteins, which may enhance the interaction with host tissues and with other bacteria in mixed infection sites. Future studies, such as sortase–substrate linkage analyses and animal model experiments using sortase-negative mutant strains, will be required to clarify the roles of sortase on pathogenesis in F. magna.We thank T.

An 89 bp segment of Revolver that is enriched in the genome of rye was isolated by deleting the DNA sequences common to rye and wheat. The entire structure of Revolver was determined by using rye genomic clones, which were screened by the 89 bp probe. Revolver consists of 2929—3041 bp with an inverted repeated sequence on each end and is dispersed through all seven chromosomes of the rye genome. Revolver is transcriptionally active, and the isolated full-length cDNA (726 bp) reveals that Revolver harbors a single gene consisting of three exons (342, 88, and 296 bp) and two introns (750 and 1237 bp), and encodes 139 amino acid residues of protein, which shows similarity to some transcriptional regulators. Revolver variants ranging from 2665 to 4269 bp, in which 5' regions were destructed, indicate structural diversities around the first exon. Revolver does not share identity with any known class I or class II autonomous transposable elements of any living species. DNA blot analysis of Triticeae plants shows that Revolver has existed since the diploid progenitor of wheat, and has been amplified or lost in several species during the evolution of the Triticeae.1. IntroductionIn higher eukaryotes, genes required for cellular function can comprise as little as 20% of the genome1,2 and occur in islands separated by repetitive DNA sequences,3,4 which comprise >70% of the genomes and are often referred to as junk DNA. With the advent of large-scale DNA sequencing, it has become apparent that transposable elements constitute a large proportion of the repetitive DNA component of most eukaryote genomes, e.g. at least 45% of the human genome5 and 50–80% of some grass genomes.6,7Transposable elements are divided into two major superfamilies, class I and class II, according to their mode of transposition.8 The class I elements can replicate by transcription of genomic copies followed by reverse transcription of an RNA intermediate and integration of the cDNA copy back into the genome.9 A representative class I element is the long-terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposon, which has both structure and life-cycle similar to those of the retroviruses.2,10,11 LTR retrotransposons are ancient and ubiquitous; they are major components of plant genomes12–16 and are believed to be major contributors to plant genome evolution, as their replication strategy offers the potential for an explosive increase in copy number and for causing insertional genomic change.17,18A class II transposable element is mobilized by excision from one chromosomal location and reintegration elsewhere in the genome. The class II transposable elements are distinguished by terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) and are divided into three superfamilies—hAT, CACTA and MULU—on the basis of the homology of TIRs and transposase genes carrying out the cut-and-paste process. Transposons are widespread in plants,19,20 but quite low in copy numbers, ranging from tens to hundreds. However, an analysis of the growing database of genomic DNA sequences reveal that plant genomes harbor up to 30000 copies of miniature inverted-repeat terminal elements (MITEs) belonging to class II elements.21 MITEs have made important contributions to plant genome organization as well as LTR retrotransposons.22,23Widely distributed transposable elements are the most rapidly evolving fraction of the eukaryotic genome,24 because the methylated and heterochromatic state of most highly repetitive elements suffers from sequence change more readily than do genes.25,26 In general, the genomes of higher eukaryotes contain thousands, even millions, of seemingly inactive transposable elements, which have been suggested as a source of interspecific sequence divergence. Species-specific repetitive elements serve as genetic tools for developing DNA markers and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) entry points dispersed throughout the genome.27 As well as the development of molecular markers, active transposable elements, have been significant tools of reverse genetics for functional genomics. Their incorporation into the host genome enables insertional gene mutagenesis and gene tagging. In rice, reverse flow by the RNA of LTR retrotransposon Tos 17 yields mutant lines.28Ac (hAT) and Mutator (MULU) have been widely used for gene cloning.29Despite the vast DNA database that exists for higher eukaryotes, most genomic components are invisible and remain to be annotated, except for homologues of known class I and class II elements. We have sought novel active genomic components that might be useful as molecular tools. Among the Triticeae tribe, rye (Secale cereale) has been an important gene source, offering stress resistance useful for wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and triticale breeding. The rye genome has a 1C DNA content of 3.9 Gb, the highest among the Triticeae, and repetitive sequences comprise 92% of the genome.30 Cot analysis estimates 24% of the rye genome to be rye-specific.1 Rye-specific repetitive sequences have been useful molecular probes for the determination of introgressed genomes and the genomic constitution of wheat–rye hybrids.31,32 However, active transposable elements have not been found in rye, wheat, or wheat relatives. One of the reasons may be that repetitive sequences were isolated mainly from relic DNA that has not suffered from methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes.33–35In this study, in order to obtain genome-specific elements regardless of the methylation state, we have used genomic deletion of sequences common to wheat and rye. Here, we describe a new class of transposon-like gene, called Revolver, consisting of 2929—3041 bp with TIRs and harboring a transcriptionally active single gene. Revolver exhibits structural diversities and considerable copy number variation through the evolution of the Triticeae, from 2 × 104 in rye to almost rare in wheat.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materialsThe plant materials used in this study included: the rye-inbred pure line IR130 developed at Tottori University (S. cereale L.; 2n = 2x = 14, RR); the wheat variety Chinese Spring (CS) (T. aestivum L.; 2n = 6x = 42); the rye IR130 chromosome 6R addition wheat CS line (6R add. wheat; 2n = 44).2.2. Genomic deletionThe deletion enrichment scheme36 was used to recover rye-specific DNA sequences from the genome of 6R add. wheat. Genomic DNA was extracted from fresh leaves by the cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) method. The genomic DNA of 6R add. wheat was digested completely with the restriction enzyme MboI, while the wheat DNA was sheared randomly to 0.5 kb on average with a sonicator. Then, 13.4 µg of digested 6R add. wheat DNA was mixed with 67.0 µg of the sonicated wheat DNA and denatured by boiling for 10 min and then allowed to anneal at random in 4 mL of PERT reaction mixture (8% phenol, 1.25 M NaClO4, 0.12 M Na2HPO4) in a revolving flask for 72 h at room temperature. The objective was to recover rye-specific repetitive sequences that will anneal by themselves with cohesive ends adjusted to the vector's ends (Fig. 1). The genomic DNA of rye IR130 was digested completely, whereas that of wheat var. CS was sheared randomly with a sonicator. The MboI-digested rye DNA was mixed with the sonicated wheat DNA, denatured by boiling, and then allowed to anneal randomly. Rye-specific sequences that anneal by themselves with cohesive ends of cloning vectors were recovered. After extraction with phenol, the DNA solution was used to ligate with pUC119 linearized by BamHI, followed by transformation of Escherichia coli JM109.The scheme for cloning genome-specific elements by subtracting sequences common to wheat and rye. Genomic subtraction recovered a repetitive sequence, which is enriched in rye, but absent from wheat. Southern blot analysis of the EcoO109I digests confirmed that the rye 89 bp fragment (AB304276) hybridized well to the genome of rye (Secale cereale, S.vavillovi and S.montanum), but did not hybridize to the wheat genomic DNA. The full structure of the element was determined by sequencing positive genomic clones screened by the initial rye-specific probe.The scheme for cloning genome-specific elements by subtracting sequences common to wheat and rye.

Southern blot analysis of the EcoO109I digests confirmed that the rye 89 bp fragment (AB304276) hybridized well to the genome of rye (Secale cereale, S.vavillovi and S.montanum), but did not hybridize to the wheat genomic DNA. The full structure of the element was determined by sequencing positive genomic clones screened by the initial rye-specific probe.A total of 222 recombinant plasmids were isolated and 1 µg of each plasmid DNA was spotted onto two sheets of nylon membranes, which were hybridized for 3 h in 5× SSC, 2% blocking reagent (Roche), 0.1% N-lauroylsarcosine, 0.02% SDS, and 1 µg/mL sheared pUC119 DNA. One membrane was probed with 5 ng of rye IR130 genomic DNA and the other was probed with 10 ng of wheat CS DNA, each labeled with digoxigenin-11-dUTP, for 14 h at 68°C, washed twice in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 5 min, and twice in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 68°C for 15 min. The hybridization signals were detected on X-ray films using as the chemiluminescent substrate a 25 mM solution of disodium 3-(4-methoxyspiro{1,2-dioxetane-3,2'-(5'-chloro)tricyclo [3.3.1.13,7] decan}-4-yl) phenyl phosphate (CSPD, Boehringer Mannheim Biochemica). From the differential blotting, 14 plasmid clones that hybridized strongly to rye DNA, but not wheat DNA, were screened. In this study, a single 89 bp sequence was used for further characterization.2.3. Phage library screening and DNA sequencingIn order to determine the full structure of the element harboring the 89 bp segment, approximately 5 × 104 plaques of a lambda FIX II library constructed from rye genomic DNA were screened with the cloned 89 bp fragment labeled with digoxigenin-dUTP. Positive plaques were detected with anti-dig-AP and CDP-star (Roche). Positive six lambda clones were chosen at random and restriction sites of BamHI and SacI were mapped on the six insertions. A 21.6 kb insertion of the three lambda clones carrying the 89 bp segment was subcloned into pBluescript and fully sequenced on both strands using the ALFexpress sequencer (Pharmacia Biotech). Overlapping fragments were assembled with the ALFexpress assembler software. Completed sequences were compared with the non-redundant GenBank+ EMBL + DDBJ database using BLASTN and BLASTX homology search software.2.4. RNA gel blot analysis and cDNA library constructionTotal RNA was extracted from young leaves of rye according to a modified guanidine isothiocyanate procedure and then treated with DNase I. Twenty micrograms of total RNA was electrophoresed in a 1.1% agarose/18% formamide gel and transferred to a nylon membrane. The membranes were prehybridized at 65°C for 4 h in hybridization solution containing 5 × Denhardt's, 10% dextran sulfate, 6× SSC and 0.2% SDS. A Revolver 1.5 kb probe (25 ng) excised from a genomic clone of lambda-1 and labeled with (a)32P-dCTP (Amersham) was added to the pre-hybridization solution and allowed to hybridize at 65°C for 14 h. Blots were washed in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65°C for 1 min and three times in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65°C for 20 min, then exposed to Fuji RX-U film. Polyadenylated mRNA was prepared from the rye leaf total RNA by affinity chromatography using an oligo(dT) column, and the first and second cDNA strands were synthesized for cloning into bacteriophage lambda ZAPII.2.5. Reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR)Plaque lifts from a rye leaf cDNA library constructed in lambda ZAPII were screened by a Revolver 1.5 kb probe excised from a genomic clone of lambda-1. The nucleotide sequence of a positive cDNA clone (726 bp) was determined by using its phagemid DNA as a cycle sequencing template. Total RNA for Reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR) extracted from seedlings was treated with DNase I. Single-strand cDNAs were synthesized by Avian Myeloblastosis virus (AMV) reverse transcriptase (Life Science) using an oligo(dT) primer. The primers for amplification of Revolver cDNA were designed from both ends of a positive cDNA clone. Reaction mixtures contained 10 ng of template cDNA, 50 pmol of each primer (5'-GGCACGAGGGTACGAGTCCGAG-3', 5'-GGCACAACTCATGTAAAAGAGGG-3'), 0.4 mM dNTPs, 1 × LA PCR buffer II, 2.5 mM MgCl2, and 0.5 U of LA Taq polymerase (Takara) in a volume of 25 µl. The PCR reaction program consisted of 30 cycles of 30 s at 95°C, 30 s at 63°C, 1 min at 72°C. The RT–PCR products were purified, ligated to the pGEM-T vector (Promega), and sequenced.CapFishingTM technology (Seegene), which employs the CapFishingTM adapter and the oligo(dT) primer, was used to obtain a full-length cDNA of Revolver. The single-strand cDNAs were synthesized from CapFishingTM adapter-added total RNA by SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) using an oligo(dT) primer extended with 23 bp of 3' Revolver sequence (5'-TTTTTTTTTTTTTTGGCACAACTCATGTAAAAGAGGG-3'). Because the CapFishingTM adapter (patent pending) binds to the CAP structure of the full-length mRNA, the 3' end of the first-strand full-length cDNA was extended using the CapFishingTM adapter as template. Then, the PCR reaction for amplifying the Revolver-related full-length cDNA was carried out using the 5' CapFishingTM adapter primer (5'-GTCTACCAGGCATTCGCTTCAT-3') and the 3' Revolver primer (5'-GGCACAACTCATGTAAAAGAGGG-3') in a 30 µl mixture including 5 µl of the single-strand cDNA solution, 0.3 µM of each primer, 0.4 mM dNTPs, 1 × LA PCR buffer II, 2.5 mM MgCl2 and 0.5 U of LA Taq polymerase (Takara). The cycling profile was: 35 cycles at 94°C for 30 s, 60°C for 30 s, 72°C for 2 min. The double-strand cDNA products were TA-cloned and sequenced.2.6. PCRThe primers for amplification of Revolver genomic DNA were designed from both ends of Revolver-2 in lambda-2. Reaction mixtures contained 10 ng of template genomic DNA, 50 pmol of each primer (5'-GCCTTTCGGCCTTCCTCTCAGGCGG-3', 5'-GTAGTCGTCAGGAGTCCTCACCA-3'), 0.4 mM dNTPs, 1 × LA PCR buffer II, 2.5 mM MgCl2 and 0.5 U of LA Taq polymerase (Takara) in a volume of 50 µl. The PCR reaction program consisted of 30 cycles of 30 s at 95°C, 1 min at 70°C, 3 min at 72°C. The PCR products were purified, ligated to the pGEM-T vector (Promega), and sequenced.2.7. DNA gel blot analysisGenomic DNA (10 µg) of Triticum aestivum (AABBDD), Triticum dicoccum (AABB), Triticum monococcum (AA), Aegilops speltoides (SS), Aegilops tauschii (DD), Dasypyrum villosum (VV), Secale cereale, Secale vavillovi, Secale silvestre, Secale montanum, Secale fragile (RR) and X Triticosecale (AABBRR) were digested to completion with restriction enzymes, subjected to electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel, then transferred, and crosslinked to nylon membranes. The membranes were pre-hybridized at 65°C for 3 h in hybridization solution containing 5× SSC, 2% blocking reagent (Roche), 0.1% N-lauroylsarcosine and 0.02% SDS. A Revolver cDNA probe (pSc5, 693 bp, 25 ng) labeled with digoxigenin-11-dUTP was added to the pre-hybridization solution and allowed to hybridize at 65°C for 14 h. Blots were washed twice in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 5 min and twice in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65°C for 15 min, then exposed to Kodak X-OMAT film using CDP-star.2.8. Slot blot analysisFor slot blot analysis, genomic DNA from wheat and wheat relatives was blotted onto hybond N+ membranes (Amersham). The non-radioactive chemiluminescence method (Gene Images, Amersham) was used for probe labeling, hybridization, and detection of hybridization sites. The Revolver cDNA sequences (pSc5, 693 bp) were used as a probe. The membranes were hybridized at 60°C for 30 min in hybridization buffer and then hybridized with labeled probes at 60°C overnight. The membranes were washed in 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60°C for 15 min, then in 0.5× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min, followed by incubation for 60 min at room temperature in 10% (W/V) blocking reagent in antibody wash buffer. Then the membrane was incubated in the presence of anti-fluorescein antibody-alkaline phosphatase (AP) conjugate. Unbound conjugate was removed by three washes in 0.3% (V/V) Tween 20 in antibody wash buffer at room temperature. Hybridization sites were detected using the CDP-star detection reagent. Decomposition of the stabilized dioxetane was catalyzed by probe-bound AP, and the light emitter was exposed on X-ray film and then recorded by a fluoro-image analyzer (FUJIFILM FLA-2000). The copy number of the Revolver probe was determined by quantitative slot blot hybridization to a series of measured amounts of Revolver cDNA.2.9. DNA:DNA in situ hybridizationRye chromosomes were prepared from root tip meristems of germinating seeds, which were cut off and placed into distilled water at 0°C for 24 h. After fixation in ethanol:glacial acetic acid (3:1, V/V) for 24 h and three washes with water, the root tips were digested for 30 min in an enzyme solution consisting of 1% pectolyase and 2% cellulase Onozuka RS in 75 mM KCl, 7.5 mM EDTA at pH 4.5. The root tips were washed with water and squashed in 45% acetic acid on glass microscope slides. After removal of the coverslip, the slides were frozen on dry ice, treated with RNase A, dehydrated through an ethanol series, and dried. Revolver cDNA was labeled with biotin-16-dUTP by PCR. The subtelomeric repetitive DNA probe was labeled with digoxigenin-11-dUTP (Boehringer Mannheim). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and signal detection were performed as described by Heslop-Harrison et al.37A 15 µM portion of the hybridization mixture containing 50% (V/V) formamide in 2× SSC, 1 µg/mL probe DNA, and 100 µg/mL salmon sperm DNA was covered with a 22 × 30 mm2 coverslip, sealed by a rubber solution, and put on a thermal cycler (PHC-3 Techne) programmed for denaturing DNA at 82°C for 8 min; and in situ hybridization at 37°C for 18 h. The preparations were then washed four times at 40°C for 10 min each time, three times in 2× SSC and once in 4× SSC, then blocked with 5% (W/V) BSA in 0.05% (V/V) Tween 20, 0.1 M NaHCO3 at 37°C for 5 min. The probes were detected with 10% (V/V) avidin-FITC and 10% (V/V) anti-dig-rhodamine (Boehringer Mannheim) in a humid chamber at 38°C for 1 h. After three washes in 0.05% (V/V) Tween 20, 0.1 M NaHCO3 and one wash in 2× SSC at 40°C (10 min each wash), the preparations were counter-stained with a mixture of 3 µg/mL DAPI (Boehringer Mannheim) and 10% (V/V) antifade (Oncor) in glycerol. The preparations were observed with a light microscope (OLYMPUS BX4), and the fluorochrome signals were visualized.3. Results and discussion3.1. Structure of dispersed transposon-like element Revolver recovered by deletionA rye genome-specific DNA library was constructed by the deletion of sequences common to wheat and rye (Fig. 1). From this library, 222 plasmid DNAs were screened by differential dot hybridization, and 14 clones hybridized strongly to rye DNA, but did not hybridize to wheat DNA. Among them, seven clones belong to the tandem 350 bp family33,34 and one clone belongs to the dispersed R173 family,38,39 both of which are rye-specific repetitive sequences. On the other hand, a single clone contained an 89 bp unknown sequence (AB304276). These results indicate that deletion of sequences common to wheat and rye was effective, and the 89 bp sequence was used for further characterization.Southern blot analysis confirmed that the rye 89 bp fragment hybridized well to the genome of S. cereale, S. vavillovi, and S. montanum, but did not hybridize to the wheat genomic DNA (Fig. 1). Therefore, the 89 bp segment is derived from a repetitive sequence family dispersed specifically in the R genome of the genus Secale. A strongly hybridized 1.5 kb band was observed on the SacI digest(data not shown), indicating that the repetitive sequences commonly contain a 1.5 kb sequence, and that the full structure is more than 1.5 kb long. In order to determine the full sequence of the repetitive element harboring the 89 bp fragment, a rye genomic library constructed in lambda FIX (Stratagene) was screened by the 89 bp probe. The plaque hybridization analysis found approximately 800 positive plaques for the membranes of 5 × 104 plaques of the rye genomic DNA library. Six positive lambda clones were chosen at random, and the restriction sites of BamHI and SacI were mapped differently on the six insertions, which are, therefore, derived from different areas of the rye genome.Three lambda clones were sequenced in full. Two lambda clones, which are 92% identical, included the full structure of the repetitive element harboring the 89 bp segment, the one in lambda-1 is 3041 bp long and the one in lambda-2 is 2929 bp long (in accession nos. AB124639–124640). The regions flanking the 3 kb elements do not show any homology between the two lambda clones. The consensus sequence contains 20 bp of incomplete TIRs on both ends (5'-TGTgAcGCCCgaGAccGACg-3', 5'-TGTaAtGCCCagGAtggGAC-3') and subterminal short repeat sequences on the 5' end (5'-TCCAGAAGAT-3'). The transposable element includes TIRs and often also sequence motifs in the subterminal regions. The 3 kb elements are insertions flanked by 2 bp repeats, TC in lambda-1, and AG in lambda-2, which may be terminal sequence duplications. As shown in Fig. 2, a FISH experiment probed by the 3041 bp sequence in lambda-1 showed that the 3 kb insertion is dispersed on the seven chromosomes of rye. These findings indicate that a transposon-like 3 kb element is dispersed throughout the rye genome.The transposon-like gene Revolver is dispersed on all seven chromosomes of rye. A FISH experiment was conducted using dual probes of Revolver labeled by biotin-16-dUTP and the subtelomeric 350 bp family labeled by digoxigenin-11-dUTP. Each probe was visualized by avidin-FITC (blue color) and anti-dig-rhodamine (red color), respectively.The transposon-like gene Revolver is dispersed on all seven chromosomes of rye.

Each probe was visualized by avidin-FITC (blue color) and anti-dig-rhodamine (red color), respectively.Despite extensive characterization of the repetitive elements in the rye genome, the 3 kb element does not show similarity to any known rye repetitive element: the 350 bp family,33,34 the 120 bp family,33,40 the 5.3H3 family,35 the R173 family,38,39 or pSc250.41 The entire structure of the 3 kb transposon-like element does not share whole identity with class I or class II transposable elements. We have named the novel transposon-like element Revolver.3.2. Identification of Revolver mRNANorthern analysis showed that Revolver is expressed extensively in rye, but there is no transcript in wheat (Fig. 3A). Weak transcripts are observed in a rye-chromosome-translocated wheat line. A Revolver cDNA clone was identified from a leaf cDNA library by the 3 kb Revolver probe. A positive rye cDNA, entirely 80% identical, is 726 bp long (AB124665). By using cap site-specific cloning method, a single size of cDNA (0.7 kb) was amplified. The obtained full-length cDNA of Revolver, 728 bp long (AB124666), shows 94% identity with the positive cDNA. Nucleotide sequence comparison between the 3 kb Revolver genomic DNAs (Revolver-1 in lambda-1 and Revolver-2 in lambda-2) and the cDNAs revealed that the Revolver element consists of three exons of 342, 88, and 292 bp, and two introns of 750 and 1237 bp (Fig. 3B). Splice acceptor and donor sites certainly exist in the exon–intron junctions. A putative TATA box is located at base 221, with a cap site at base 261 and a possible polyadenylation signal AATAAA at base 2918. Therefore, Revolver harbors a single gene consisting of three exons and the initial 89 bp clone obtained by genomic subtraction is located around the second exon (Fig. 3B).Identification of Revolver mRNA. (A) Multiple sizes of transcripts homologous to Revolver were found in rye but no transcript was found in wheat. (B) A full-length Revolver cDNA clone (AB124665–124666), 726 bp long, was identified. Nucleotide sequence comparison between Revolver and the cDNA revealed that Revolver includes a single gene consisting of three exons and two introns. The predicted 139 amino acid sequence is highly conserved in Revolver cDNAs (AB124645, AB124666, AB304271–304275), which are recovered from S. cereale, S. silvestre, D. villosum, and Ae. tauschii, indicating activity in all of these species.

These Revolver cDNAs (AB124645, AB124666, AB304271–AB304275) contain a single open reading frame (ORF) encoding 139 amino acid residues of protein (Fig. 3). The ORF does not show homology to known transposases; however, the predicted Revolver product shows similarity to a transcriptional regulator family of AsnC/Lrp or a glycerol-3-phosphate transporter and includes a DDE motif (Fig. 3 and 4). Because of the presence of terminal inverted repeats and encoding a DNA-binding-like protein, Revolver is considered to be a class II transposable element. The inverted repeated sequences determining the family identity of a transposon and the encoding gene are unique sequences that are quite different from known class II transposons. Moreover, the entire structure of Revolver does not share whole identity with either class I or class II autonomous transposable elements.Revolver cDNAs isolated by RT–PCR from S. cereale, S. silvestre, S. fragile, D. villosum, Ae. tauschii, and T. monococcum (AB124645, AB304271–304275). Wheat and barley ESTs showing partial homology to Revolver were found in the Triticeae EST database. The predicted Revolver ORF shows similarity to some transcriptional regulators with DNA-binding ability. The ORF is highly conserved among the top four species, indicating that Revolver is active in these species. In wheat and barley, however, only partial sequences encoded in exon 2 are retained.Revolver cDNAs isolated by RT–PCR from S. cereale, S. silvestre, S. fragile, D. villosum, Ae. tauschii, and T. monococcum (AB124645, AB304271–304275).

In wheat and barley, however, only partial sequences encoded in exon 2 are retained.The Ty1-copia group retrotransposon is a major component of plant genomes.12,27BARE-1, one of the Ty1-copia retrotransposons,42,43 is dispersed and transcribed in the genome of barley Hordeum vulgare.44,45Revolver is quite different from retrotransposons, although it shows partial homology (60%) to both end regions (5' end 123 bp, 3' end 777–2112 bp) of LARD LTR (3130–4960 bp), one of which is found as a nested insertion in the 3' LTR of BARE-142 and is regarded as solo LTRs of the non-autonomous retorotransposon elements named LARD (large retrotransposon derivative) in barley.46 The two sequences of 5 kb were found to be similar to this insertion in a 66 kb stretch of the barley genome and were described as an LTR of LARD.46,47 The LARD LTRs include the region homologous to both 5' and 3' ends of the Revolver element (Fig. 3B). At the 5' terminus, LARD LTRs have the region of 123–149 bp homologous to upstream of the transcription initiation site of Revolver. At the 3' terminus, LARD LTR-1 (4960 bp) has a region of 2112 bp showing 60% homology to Revolver, from the middle of the first intron to the 3' terminus of Revolver. Another LARD LTR nested in BARE-1 has a region of 777 bp showing 60% homology to the middle of the second intron to downstream of the third exon. Both 3' termini coincide with the 3' terminus of the untranslated region downstream of the third exon of Revolver. However, no homology to Revolver was observed in 631–2176 bp of LARD LTR-1 or 598–2353 bp of LARD LTR nested in BARE-1. As to the region of about 2 kb between these end regions, LARD LTRs lack the region from the first exon to the middle of the first intron. Moreover, the central regions of LARD LTRs are highly variable, except for the 5' and 3' ends,46 but Revolver is entirely conserved. LARD LTRs have sequences not present in Revolver; instead by the first exons of Revolver and result in non-coding sequences. Revolver and LARD LTR may be evolutionally related, but LARD LTR is a structural part of an LTR retrotransposon, and on the contrary, Revolver is a single gene consisting of the exon–intron structure. Gene-encoding LTR has never been found. Therefore, Revolver is quite distinguished from LARD LTRs, in which the exons 1 and 2 of Revolver are replaced by different sequences and the coding region is not present, and whose autonomous element has never been reported. The presence of a Revolver-like element in barley suggests a wide prevalence of Revolver among the Triticeae.The novel high-copy element Revolver is transcriptionally active in rye. Some of transposon-like elements exist in high copy numbers in the genomes of most eukaryotes, but the great majority of them are inactive, and only a small portion of them retain the ability to transpose.48,49 Very few transposons have been shown to be transcriptionally active. A copia-like retroelement BARE-1 dispersed in the barley genome43 is transcribed in somatic tissues.44 Some LTR retrotransposons, such as tobacco Tnt1, Tto1, and OARE-1 that are largely inactive, can be transcriptionally activated under the conditions of biotic and abiotic stress, including wounding, oxidative stress, and pathogen infection.50,51 After stress-induced transcription, the rice LTR retrotransposon Tos17 increased the genomic copy number.52 In maize, a survey of more than 4 × 105 expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences identified only 56 retrotransposon cDNAs, supporting the notion that most retrotransposons are inactive.7 Furthermore, most of these sequences are derived from the low-to-middle repetitive LTR retrotransposons, and not from the very high copy number elements that have been responsible for doubling the size of the maize genome in the past 5–6 million years. In humans, only 30–60 L1 elements out of 5 × 105 comprising 45% of the genome are thought to be active.53 In contrast to the low-level activity of high-copy retrotransposons, highly repetitive Revolver is transcribed strongly and may retain mobility and mutagenetic potential.A transcriptionally active Revolver gene is well conserved among the Triticeae members. The methylated and heterochromatic state of most transposons can cause them to change sequence more rapidly than the genes.25,26 For example, regulation at any stage of the replication cycle for retrotransposons (transcription, translation, reverse transcription, and integration of element cDNA) can limit the transposition. Furthermore, the paucity of maize retrotransposon-derived ESTs indicates that some epigenetic mechanisms might have been repressing the transcription of their large fraction in the genome. In contrast to these silenced retrotransposons, Revolver is transcriptionally active, and short RNA homologues causing RNAi silencing54–56 were not observed on Northern blots (Fig. 3A). Revolver has not suffered from epigenetical silencing systems and might has retained strong transcriptional activity during the long evolution of the Triticeae.3.3. Structural diversities of Revolver in the rye genomePolymerase chain reaction was performed using the primer derived from one clone of Revolver (Revolver-2). Several sizes of Revolver variants ranging from 2665 to 4269 bp were amplified from the rye genome, but nothing was amplified from the wheat genome. All of the lengthy variants may be non-autonomous elements of Revolver, because they have the downstream region of second intron of Revolver, but they have structural mutation occurred at the 5'-side, in which the coding regions, especially in the first exon, are considerably destructed (Fig. 5).Structural diversities of Revolver in the rye genome. Several sizes of Revolver variants ranging from 2665 to 4269 bp (Revolver-3–6, AB124641–12464) were obtained from the rye genome. All of the lengthy variants may be non-autonomous elements of Revolver, because they have the downstream region of second intron of Revolver, but they have structural mutation occurred at the 5' side, in which the coding region especially in the first exon is considerably destructed. Among the Revolver family showing extremely structural diversities, Revolver-1 (3041 bp) in lambda-1 and Revolver-2 (2929 bp) in lambda-2, which indicates the highest coincidence with a full-length cDNA of 728 bp, should have basic structure of Revolver.Structural diversities of Revolver in the rye genome.

At the 5' side, Revolver-3 has the homologous region of 150 bp including the inverted repeat sequence. However, as to the region of about 2 kb between these sequences, Revolver-3 lacks the region from the first exon to the middle of the first intron of Revolver. In the region from 631 to 2176 bp at the 5' side of Revolver-3, there exist short repetitive sequences occurring repeatedly, but no homology was observed with Revolver. Referring to the homology with Revolver of each region, Revolver-3 exhibited homology from 77 to 93%.Distribution of Revolver in plant genomes as revealed by genomic Southern blotting. Revolver cDNA hybridized strongly to Secale species and moderately to T. monococcum (AA), Ae. speltoides (SS), Ae. tauschii (DD), and T. dicoccum (AABB). In contrast, Revolver was not detected in the common wheat genome. These facts indicate that Revolver has existed since the diploid progenitor of wheat (3000–8000 copies), and it has been amplified in rye (20 000 copies), but it has been lost from bread wheat after the allopolyploidy event.Distribution of Revolver in plant genomes as revealed by genomic Southern blotting.

These facts indicate that Revolver has existed since the diploid progenitor of wheat (3000–8000 copies), and it has been amplified in rye (20 000 copies), but it has been lost from bread wheat after the allopolyploidy event.Next, the total length of Revolver-4 (AB124642) consists of 3219 bp (Fig. 5), and at the 3' side, it has the region of 1806 bp from the second exon to the 3' terminal of Revolver. However, in the 1413 bp at the 5' side, the region homologous to Revolver is limited to only 101 bp at the 5' terminal. Further, Revolver-5 (AB124643) has a total length of 2665 bp (Fig. 5), and at the 3' side, it has the region of 1826 bp from the second exon to the 3' terminal of Revolver. At its 5' side, the region homologous to Revolver is limited to only 37 bp at the terminal region, but the region of about 670 bp is homologous to Revolver-4. Finally, Revolver-6 (AB124644) has a total length of 3503 bp (Fig. 5), and at the 3' side it has the region of 1294 bp from the middle of the second intron to the 3' terminal of Revolver; however, at the 5' side there is not a region homologous to Revolver, and 121 bp at the 5' terminal is homologous to Revolver-4 and Revolver-5.Revolver shows extremely structural diversities, especially around the first exon. Among them since Revolver-1 in lambda-1 and Revolver-2 in lambda-2 show the highest correspondence with a full-length cDNA of 728 bp, they should be basic structure of Revolver, despite the not so high homology of the first exon. Multiple transcripts longer than 0.7 kb RNA fragment (Fig. 3A) may be unspliced versions of several lengthy variants or a read-through transcript from an external promoter. The major 3 kb transcripts may be unspliced immature transcripts, which are caused by structural degeneration in 5' region around the first exon. It suggests that such variants are prevalent than the normal spliced transcripts.3.4. Amplification and elimination of Revolver in the Triticeae genomeThe distribution of Revolver in the Triticeae was analyzed by Southern blotting. As shown in Fig. 6, the Revolver cDNA probe hybridized strongly to gel blots of the wheat relatives Secale sp. (RR), D. villosum (VV), and moderately to wheat ancestral species T. monococcum (AA), Ae. speltoides (SS), T. dicoccum (AABB), and Ae. tauschii (DD). These cereals may share a large superfamily of Revolver stemming from their common progenitor. On the contrary, Revolver cDNA did not show hybridization to T. aestivum genomic DNA (Fig. 6). DNA slot blot analysis also shows that Revolver elements are abundant in the genomes of Secale sp. (RR) and D. villosum (VV) (over 104 copies), and Revolver is present with moderate repeats in the wheat ancestral species T. monococcum (AA), T. dicoccum (AABB) and Ae. tauschii (DD) (3 × 103 - 8 × 103 copies), but very rare in bread wheat (103 copies). While these facts indicate that Revolver has existed since the diploid progenitor of wheat and been amplified in rye and some other species, it has been lost from bread wheat through evolution accompanied by hexaploidization. Revolver exhibits quantitative variation during evolution of the Triticeae.The rye haploid genome contains 3.9 Gb of DNA and is the largest among the Triticeae genomes. Highly repetitive Revolver was visualized over the entire length of rye chromosomes by a FISH experiment (Fig. 2). The copy number of Revolver was calculated by slot blot hybridization with a Revolver probe as 2 × 104 per rye genome, but only 103 copies in the wheat genome. Generally, angiosperm genomes vary tremendously in size; some species have less than 50 Mb of DNA per haploid genome and others have more than 85 000 Mb.57 The lack of correlation between the complexity of the organism and the size of the genome has long been recognized as a C value paradox.58 There is great variability in genome size among the grass family Poaceae: 450 Mb for rice, 2500 Mb for maize, 5000 Mb for barley, and 16 000 Mb for hexaploid wheat.59 Most of the variation in genome size is attributable mainly to the amount of repetitive DNA, which comprises 70% of cereal genomes.1,3 Cot analysis estimated that repetitive sequences comprise 92% of the rye genome,30 and 24% of them were differentiated in a rye-specific array.1 The considerable accumulation of Revolver may be a reason why the rye genome became so enlarged when compared to other members of the Triticeae. If Revolver is a mobile element, it is reasonable that as many as 2 × 104 copies of the family have been generated and spread throughout the rye genome since the evolutionary event that separated rye and wheat. The considerable variation of Revolver copy number among the wheat-related species indicates their propagation activity during evolution of the Triticeae tribe. The name of the novel transposon-like gene Revolver means a dynamic factor to construct genomes through evolution of the Triticeae.Among the repetitive DNA, especially the LTR retrotransposons, the copy number has increased,60,61 and repetitive DNA comprises 60% or more of many large plant genomes, such as those of maize (Zea mays), wheat, and barley,6,7,45,62 which has contributed greatly to the expansion of the genome.5,17,63,64 Over a broad range of organisms, retrotransposon copy number appears to be correlated with genome size. The small genome of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (13 × 106 bp) contains 51 full-length retrotransposons.65 In the large genome of maize (2500 Mb), some retrotransposons have copy numbers exceeding 2 × 104 per haploid genome6,62,63,66 and all of the retrotransposons sequenced were shown to have inserted within the last six million years, leading to a doubling of the size of the maize genome.26Revolver is quite different from LTR retrotransposons and features a DNA-type transposable element. The copy number of the DNA-type transposable element is generally less than those of the highly repetitive retrotransposons, but recent analysis of the growing genomic database revealed that plant genomes harbor a huge copy of DNA-type transposable elements termed MITEs.21,23 The plant genome could also be expanded by the class II element MITE.67,68 The DNA-type transposon-like gene Revolver is a novel member of a major genomic component, as well as LTR retrotransposons and MITEs, which might have contributed to plant genome construction and evolution.Revolver is less frequent in the genome of hexaploid bread wheat (T. aestivum; 2n = 42, AABBDD), which is an allohexaploid carrying three different subgenomes, A, B, and D69 resulting from two independent hybridization events (Fig. 6). The first combined the A genome of the wild diploid wheat T. monococcum (AA) and the B genome, which has the greatest genetic similarity to the S genome of Ae. speltoides.70–72 This resulted in the tetraploid ancestor of modern Triticum species T. dicoccum and Ae. tauschii, the diploid donor of the D genome hybridized over 8000 years ago, resulting in hexaploid wheat.73Revolver existed in the wheat ancestral species, T. monococcum (AA), T. dicoccum (AABB), and Ae. tauschii (DD) (3–8 × 103 copies). However, it is considerably less frequent in T. aestivum (103 copies). The polyploidy that arise either by duplication of a single genome or by the acquisition of a few genomes from related species (allopolyploidy) is a major force in the evolution of plants; 50–70% of angiosperms have experienced at least one episode of polyploidy in their history.74,75 The combination of A, B and, D genomes into a single nucleus may generate more incompatibility than harmony for the propagation of some genes.76–78Revolver contains a single ORF encoding a 139 amino acid residue protein, which features a transcriptional regulator able to bind DNA, suggesting that the Revolver element can transpose in a cut-and-paste fashion, like class II elements. In wheat, no transcript of the Revolver gene is observed on the Northern blot (Fig. 3A) and no Revolver cDNA is recovered by RT–PCR. A EST homologue is highly degenerated from the obtained cDNAs of other wheat-related species (Fig. 4). Revolver may have been eliminated from the wheat genome because of losing the gene activity needed to reintegrate into the host wheat genome after that polyploidy induced incompatibility among the three genomes.As well as a history of genome expansion, flowering plants appear to have undergone genome contraction.79–81 One possible mechanism that reduces genome size is unequal intrastrand recombination between the two tandem repeats in direct orientation on the same chromatid. The outcome of the event can yield the net deletion of one repeat and the sequences between the repeats. Unequal intrastrand recombination between adjacent LTR retrotransposons might lead to a decrease in the size of a genome, a phenomenon that is supported by the abundance of solo LTRs and the general absence of the LTR–internal-LTR structure.79 Deletions of retrotransposons are more common in insects.82 Highly saturated Revolver in the wheat polyploid genome can offer unequal intrastrand recombination, and recombination between adjacent Revolver elements might have reduced the copy number in the wheat genome. The considerably destructive variants of Revolver (Fig. 5) may be stemmed from unequal recombination.Revolver is enriched in the genomes of wild wheat relatives but rare in the common wheat genome. A cultivated rye (S. cereale L.) has been used as a gene source for wheat and triticale breeding by interspecific chromosome introgression and rearrangement or by translocation or substitution. A representative achievement of this type of manipulation is the introduction of a stem rust resistance gene into wheat. The rye genome still has a gene resource potential for future improvement of wheat. Rye-specific repeated sequences have been useful as probes to determine alien chromatins and chromosome constitutions in wheat–rye cross-breeding.31,32Revolver is an effective tool for developing molecular tags for transferring useful germplasm of wheat relatives, rye, and Dasypyrum into the wheat genome. Revolver offer FISH, Southern probe for genotyping, and dispersed PCR entry points to amplify rye-specific multiple genomic fragments.83Revolver is attractive as an index of genomic evolution and as a landmark of chromosomes useful for evaluating evolutionary relationships among the tribe Triticeae.In conclusion, genomic deletion cloning led to the discovery of Revolver, a novel member of the major genomic component, as well as LTR retrotransposons and MITEs, which show drastically different copy number between bread wheat and rye, a useful genetic resource of wheat. Revolver consists of a single gene encoding a DNA-binding-like protein, which is transcriptionally active and does not suffer from epigenetic silencing. Revolver elements feature an autonomous transposon, which may complement in trans the propagation of related elements, including LARD, that might have contributed to plant genome expansion, rearrangement, and evolution.FundingThe authors acknowledge Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) for the Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research Nos. 04760006 and 1360006 that supported this work."
