Brocadia pituitae, along with those of a nitrite oxidizer and two incomplete denitrifiers from the anammox bacterial community (ABC) metagenome. Although NO2- reduction to NO is considered to be the first step in anammox, Ca. B. pituitae lacks nitrite reductase genes (nirK and nirS) responsible for this reaction. Comparative genomics of Ca. B. pituitae with Ca. Kuenenia stuttgartiensis and six other anammox bacteria with nearly complete genomes revealed that their core genome structure contains 1,152 syntenic orthologues. But nitrite reductase genes were absent from the core, whereas two other Brocadia species possess nirK and these genes were horizontally acquired from multiple lineages. In contrast, at least five paralogous hydroxylamine oxidoreductase genes containing candidate ones (hao2 and hao3) encoding another nitrite reductase were observed in the core. Indeed, these two genes were also significantly expressed in Ca. B. pituitae as in other anammox bacteria. Because many nirS and nirK genes have been detected in the ABC metagenome, Ca. B. pituitae presumably utilises not only NO supplied by the ABC members but also NO and/or NH2OH by self-production for anammox metabolism.1. IntroductionAnaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) bacteria couple nitrite reduction to ammonium oxidation, with nitric oxide (NO) and hydrazine as intermediates, ultimately producing dinitrogen gas and nitrate.1–3 NO, a key intermediate in anammox bacteria, is commonly produced by the reduction of nitrite to NO. This reaction is catalysed by two different types of enzymes—copper-containing (NirK) and cd1 (NirS) nitrite reductases.4 However, anammox bacteria do not necessarily possess the genes encoding these enzymes. Interestingly, the nirK gene has been detected in the Candidatus (Ca.) Brocadia sp. UTAMX25 and Ca. Brocadia caroliniensis6 genomes despite their low completeness; however, neither nirK nor nirS genes have been detected in other nearly complete Brocadia genomes. Ca. Brocadia sinica, which is one of the species with nearly complete genomes, lacks genes encoding NO-forming nitrite reductase (i.e. nirK and nirS).7 But, 15N-tracer experiments have demonstrated that Ca. B. sinica could reduce NO2- to NH2OH, instead of NO, with as yet unidentified nitrite reductase. On the other hand, anammox genomes contain 10 or 11 different types of paralogous genes encoding octaheme hydroxylamine oxidoreductase (Hao).8,9 Hao-like proteins are thought to be the most likely candidate enzymes catalysing nitrite reduction to NO or NH2OH in anammox bacteria. Indeed, among the Hao-like protein genes of Ca. Kuenenia stuttgartiensis,10,KSMBR1_2163 (formerly kustc0458) and KSMBR1_3792 (formerly kuste4574) have been postulated to function in nitrite reduction based on their gene expression profile and protein sequence analyses, making them candidates for the elusive nitrite reductases producing NO.8,11–13 Nevertheless, the physiological functions of Hao-like proteins remain enigmatic. Considering the published literature, a number of questions arise. First, what is the significance of the presence or absence of the nirS or nirK genes in anammox bacteria, and do any other members of an anammox bacterial community (ABC) have such genes? Second, do all anammox bacteria have the potential to reduce nitrite with Hao-like proteins? To answer these questions, we attempted to reconstruct the genomes of anammox and other predominant bacteria, from the ABC metagenome in the anammox bioreactor fed with nitrite and ammonium.14 We then performed comparative genomics on the anammox bacteria to determine their core genome structure, which was vertically inherited from a common ancestor, and examined the expression profiles of the key genes related to nitrogen metabolism. We also characterized the physiological and metabolic potential of not only anammox bacteria but also the predominant ABC members, especially for nitrite oxidizers, to determine their lifestyle in the anammox bioreactor.2. Materials and methods2.1. Anammox bacterial consortiumAnammox population was enriched in a small up-flow reactor, in which nonwoven fabric supports were placed in15,16 and a synthetic medium was continuously supplied. A plastic cylinder (38-mm inner diameter, 400-mm length), of which bottom end was plugged with a rubber stopper, was set up in vertical position. Two sheets of porous polyester nonwoven fabric support (3-mm thick, 30 × 200 mm) were submerged to activated sludge, obtained from a municipal sewage treatment plant in central Japan, and placed in a plastic cylinder as a fixed-bed for the microbial population. Void volume of the reactor was 410 ml excluding the void volume of fabric supports, because supplied medium may not freely exchange inside and outside of support. The synthetic medium consisted of (per litre of tap water): NH4Cl, 103–480 mg; NaNO2, 104–570 mg; NaHCO3, 500 mg; KH2PO4, 27 mg; MgSO4·7H2O, 300 mg; and CaCl2·7H2O, 18 mg. Dissolved oxygen in the medium was not eliminated and pH was controlled at 7.2–7.5. Concentrations of NH4Cl and NaNO2 were increased stepwise after anammox activity was detected. Samples were obtained from the medium reservoir and the effluent two to three times a week, and NH4+<U+2060>, NO2-<U+2060>, and NO3- were determined using ion chromatograph (IC-2010, Tosoh Corp. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).14 In the anammox enrichment culture, neither nitrite nor ammonium was consumed for 106 days after starting to supply the medium to the reactor, but consumption of nitrite and ammonium as well as production of nitrate was found on 107 days of operation, indicating that anammox organisms were growing in the reactor. Temperature of the reactor was maintained at 32.1 ± 1.0°C during 254 days of operation. Because the temperature unexpectedly raised and sometimes reached to around 35°C, the temperature was lowered to 30°C at the day 327, which was stably controlled until the 421 days, when the biomass was sampled. In addition to the measurement of anammox activity, we confirmed the 16S rDNA sequence of anammox bacteria amplified by PCR.2.2. DNA and RNA isolationThe biomass of the anammox bacterial consortium was filtered through a 53-µm mesh to make it uniform (final wet weight, 3.6 g). DNA was extracted using the ISOIL for Bead-Beating kit (Nippon Gene) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, except for an additional treatment with a lytic enzyme.17 Briefly, a biomass sample was suspended in 30 ml of TE buffer and vortexed vigorously. The biomass suspension was evenly divided among 20 tubes containing zirconia/silica beads (0.1 mm, 0.47 g; 0.5 mm, 0.23 g). After the addition of lysozyme solution (0.71 mg/ml as a final concentration) to the tube, the suspension was incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with gentle shaking, and then incubated for 15 min at 37 °C after the addition of 20 µl of proteinase K solution (12 U). The lytic enzyme–treated biomass was bead-beaten by vortexing at power range 5 for 7 min. The solution was then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min at room temperature and the DNA in the supernatant was purified.To concentrate DNA from Ca. Brocadia species used for genome reconstruction, we tested the beating conditions with 0.5-mm zirconia/silica beads alone by changing the beating power and time. The DNA concentration was evaluated based on the amount of PCR product using a primer set for the 16S rRNA gene (Bro5F, GGGTATGATCTTGGCTCAGAACGA; Bro232R, CGCACGTTTGACTATCATCACC) of Ca. B. pituitae. For RNA isolation, the biomass of the anammox bacterial consortium (2.5 g wet weight) was filtered as described above for DNA isolation and transferred to 50-ml tubes containing 5 ml TE buffer (pH 8.0). Ten millilitres of Bacterial RNA protect reagent (Qiagen) was added to the biomass suspension and vortexed vigorously. After the biomass suspension was allowed to stand for 5 min at room temperature, it was centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C to collect the biomass, and the pellet was washed with TE buffer. Lysozyme (1.36 mg/ml as a final concentration) was added to biomass suspended in 5 ml TE buffer. After a 10-min incubation at 37°C, 12 U of Proteinase K was added for another 10-min incubation. To increase the disruption efficiency, the lytic enzyme-treated biomass was transferred to a new tube containing 2.7 g zirconia silica beads (0.1 mm, 1.8 g; 0.5 mm, 0.9 g) and then vortexed at maximum power for 10 min. RNA was extracted and purified using the RNeasy Protect Bacteria Mini kit and QIAzol Lysis Reagent (Qiagen). DNase I-treated RNA was re-purified using the RNeasy Mini Clean-up Kit (Qiagen), and rRNA was removed using the Ribo-Zero rRNA Removal Kit (Gram-negative bacteria; Epicentre).2.3. Sequencing and raw data treatmentGenomic DNA was sheared using a Focused ultrasonicator (Covaris). A paired-end library with an insert size of 450 bp was prepared using a TruSeq DNA PCR-free LT Sample Prep Kit (Illumina) and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq platform, generating 6 million reads with read lengths of 300 bp. The PEAR software (v0.9.6) was used to merge these paired-end reads after filtering the low-quality scores of the sequence using the FASTX toolkit and eliminating duplicates using PRINSEQ. Gene prediction from the merged sequences was performed using MetaGeneAnnotator.18 Until the final creation of a multi-FASTA file of amino acid sequences including these multiple processes, it was pipelined as MAPLE Submission Data Maker (MSDM).19 MSDM is available from https://maple.jamstec.go.jp/maple/maple-2.3.1/softdownload/MSDM.html. The multi-FASTA file consisting of 3 million amino acid sequences was subjected to metagenomic analysis using GenomapleTM (formerly MAPLE) ver. 2.3.2. RNA-seq libraries were prepared from the anammox bacterial consortium according to the standard Illumina protocol, and cDNA libraries were checked for quality and quantity using the DNA-100 kit (Agilent Technologies) and a 2100 Bioanalyzer. Each library was sequenced with the Illumina Sequencing Kit v2 on one lane of a MiSeq desktop sequencer (Illumina) to obtain 150-bp average paired-end reads. Reads Per Kilobase per Million mapped reads (RPKM) values were calculated according to the standard method. The RPKM ratio, calculated by dividing the RPKM of each gene by the mean RPKM of all ribosomal proteins, was used to determine relative gene expression levels. Amino acid sequences used for GenomapleTM analysis are available at https://zenodo.org/record/3491404#.XigFVhP7RTY. BioSample accession numbers: SAMD00057694 for metagenomic sequence, AP021856 for Ca. B. pituitae, AP021857 for Ca. Desulfobacillus denitrificans, AP021858 for Ca. Nitrosymbiomonas proteolyticus, BLAA01000001- BLAA01000004 for 4 contigs of Ca. D. symbiosum, and DRA009157 for RNA sequence RNA-seq, of the ABC.2.4. Community structure analysisWe calculated the proportional representation of bacteria in the metagenome based on the mapping pattern of module M00178 for bacterial ribosomes.20,21 We calculated the proportion of bacteria at the individual taxonomic rank as defined by the Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG; i.e. phylum, order, and class level). For a more detailed analysis of bacterial communities, we searched all sequences assigned to ribosomal proteins by GenomapleTM using the NCBI non-redundant protein database.2.5. Reconstruction of genomes and data analysesIn addition to the Illumina platform, a PacBio RS II DNA sequencer was also used for metagenomic sequencing. Paired-end reads (400-bp insertion size on average) and mate-pair reads (3- and 5-kb insertion sizes on average) generated on a HiSeq 2500 (Illumina) were assembled using Platanus ver. 1.2.122 to reconstruct the genome of predominant species in Ca. genus Brocadia. Reads from PacBio RS II were assembled using HGAP3. In the finishing step, a fosmid library was constructed according to the previously published method23 and sequenced by Sanger and Illumina Technologies to fill gaps and increase sequence quality. In addition to Ca. Brocadia species, the genomes of three other predominant species in the phylum Armatimonadetes, class Betaproteobacteria (ß-proteobacteria), and family Anaerolineae were reconstructed in the same manner. Gene identification and annotation were initially performed using DFAST.24 We then manually curated the output results by carefully comparing the BLAST search results with the NCBI protein database as the genome database of DFAST is too small for annotating the genomes of uncultured microbes. A circular map of each reconstructed genome was constructed using the CGView Server.252.6. Phylogenetic and genomic similarity analysesTo determine the phylogenetic position of Ca. Brocadia species whose genome was reconstructed in this study among anammox bacteria, we retrieved ribosomal proteins from each complete or draft genome registered in the NCBI database. Subsequently, we selected 20 commonly conserved ribosomal proteins (rplA, rplA, rplN, rplQ, rplV, rplW, rplX, rplC, rplE, rplF, rplI, rpsK, rpsM, rpsP, rpsS, rpsB, rpsD, rpsE, rpsH, and rpsI) among the anammox bacteria. These concatenated protein sequences were aligned with those of Rhodopirellula baltica, used as an outgroup. We used the LG+G model in MEGA 6.06 to construct a phylogenetic tree using the maximum likelihood method.26 We tested the average nucleotide identity among the genomes used for phylogenetic analysis to identify species in the genus Ca. Brocadia using JSpeciesWS.27 We also determined the phylogenetic positions of the nitrite reductases (NirK and NirS) horizontally acquired in the anammox bacterial genomes using the LG+G + I model in MEGA 6.06.2.7. Orthologous analysis and estimation of the core genome structureOrthologous groups (OGs) for Ca. Brocadia species, Ca. K. stuttgartiensis, and six other anammox bacteria were constructed using the rapid classification programme DomClust28 on the Microbial Genome Database (MBGD) server.29 A core genome is defined as a set of genes (OGs) syntenically conserved in at least half of the compared strains. In our study, a set of genes in the syntenic regions shared by at least five species was defined as the core genome for the eight analysed anammox species. A set of syntenic regions and the consensus order of the OGs in these regions, designated as the core genome structure, were created using the CoreAligner programme30 based on conserved linkages between orthologous genes in each chromosome. Comparative analysis of gene organization around the nirK gene was performed using GenomeMatcher.312.8. Evaluation of the metabolic and physiological potentialThe patterns of metabolic and physiological potential of Ca. Brocadia species and three other predominant species were investigated using GenomapleTM (formerly MAPLE) ver. 3.2.21,32 GenomapleTM is available through a web interface (https://maple.jamstec.go.jp/maple/maple-2.3.1/) and as a stand-alone package from Docker Hub (https://hub.docker.com/r/genomaple/genomaple). Genes were mapped to 795 functional modules defined by the KEGG (pathways, 305; complexes, 294; functional sets, 157; and signatures, 40), and the module completion ratio (MCR) was calculated according to a Boolean algebra–like equation described previously.20 To evaluate MCR, Q-value suggesting working probability of the modules was also calculated by GenomapleTM. The Q-value near zero indicates high working probability of the module.21 The MCR and Q-value patterns of Ca. Brocadia species were compared with those of three other anammox species with genomes reconstructed to fewer than five contigs.2.9. Determination of anammox activity using a 15N-tracerThe potential anammox and denitrification activities of biomass samples were determined using a 15N-tracer technique based on a method described previously.33 To determine the activities of the samples, reactive substrates for anammox were added to the vials under the following three combinations: (i) 1 mM unlabelled NH4Cl and 1 mM Na15NO2 or 1 mM 15NH2OH (SI Science, Tokyo, Japan; 99.9 atom% 15N), (ii) 1 mM 15NH4Cl (SI Science; 99.9 atom% 15N) and 1 mM unlabelled NaNO2 or NH2OH, and (iii) 0.4 mM 15NH4Cl without nitrite. During anaerobic incubation with substrate combinations (i) and (ii), NO2-- or NH2OH-dependent anammox could be detected by the production of 14N15N (29N2), because anammox uses 1 mol each of NH4+ and NO2- or NH2OH. Substrate combination (iii) was a negative control to determine whether anammox occurs without nitrite or NH2OH. The biomass granule of the anammox bacterial consortium, which was sieved through a 53-µm mesh, was used for measurement of anammox activity. When NO was used as a reactive substrate instead of NO2-<U+2060>, we added 2500 ppm of 15NO gas (SI Science; 99.6 atom% 15N, +98%) to the headspace of the vial containing the ABC biomass suspended in 5-ml substrate solution. The concentration of dissolved NO was ~7 µM. The following standard gas was used for GC/MS analysis. A small amount of 15N-labelled N2 gas (53.4 15N atom%; SI science, Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) was added in a vial filled with ultrapure He (>99.99995%) as background to prepare standard to demine 29N2, and 30N2. Concentration of 29N2 and 30N2 in the preparation was, 386 and 221 ppmv, respectively. Other GC/MS analytical conditions and subsequent calculations were performed as described previously,14,33 except that the ABC biomass was not sieved. After the GC/MS measurement, the biomass was recovered by filtration and dried at 100 °C for 12 h to calculate the dry weight. To disperse the ABC granules, the sample was agitated using an SW-M6000 stirrer at 130 rpm before measurement of anammox activity.3. Results and discussion3.1. Metagenomic analysis of anammox bioreactorThe ABC comprised members of four major taxa, Planctomycetes (48.5%), Chloroflexi (14.3%), Armatimonadetes (10.8%), and ß-proteobacteria (12.6%); Ca. Brocadia was the most predominant member in Planctomycetes, with a relative abundance of 38.1% (Fig. 1a). Accordingly, we performed genome reconstruction of Ca. Brocadia species and representative species of three other major taxa using sequenced fosmid clones and shotgun reads. We successfully reconstructed the genomes and determined the whole-genome sequences of three currently non-isolatable species in genus Ca. Brocadia, phylum Armatimonadetes, and class ß-proteobacteria. Similarly, we were able to assemble four contigs of Anaerolineaceae species in phylum Chloroflexi. We designated this anammox bacteria as Ca. Brocadia pituitae (‘pituitae’ is ‘sludge’ in Latin). Ca. B. pituitae was shown to be a new species by phylogenetic analysis based on the sequences of concatenated ribosomal proteins and genomic identity analysis among 12 Brocadia strains including Ca. B. pituitae (Supplementary Fig. S1 and Supplementary Table S1). We also designated 3 other predominant species as Ca. N. proteolyticus (Armatimonadetes), Ca. D. denitrificans (ß-proteobacteria), and Ca. D. symbiosum (Anaerolineaceae) based on their genomic features and metabolic and physiological potential deduced by the Genomaple. The description of Ca. N. symbiomonas is as follows: Nitrosymbiomonas (ni.tro.sym.bi.o’mo.nas. L. n. nitrum nitrate; Gr. n. symbios a companion; Gr. n. monas a unit, monad; M.L. fem. n. Nitrosymbiomonas, nitrate producing symbiotic monad.), proteolyticus (pro.te.o.ly’ti.cus. Ger. protein from Gr. protos first; adj. lyticus dissolving; M.L. adj. proteolyticus protein-dissolving). We also designated ß-proteobacteria and Anaerolineae phylotypes as Ca. D. denitrificans and Ca. D. symbiosum. The description of Ca. D. denitrificans and Ca. D. symbiosum are as follows: Desulfobacillus (de.sul.fo.ba.cil’lus. L. pref. de from; L. n. sulphur; L. dim. n. bacillus, a small rod; M.L. masc. Desulfobacillus a bacillus that reduces sulphur compound), denitrificans (de.ni.tri’fi.cans. L. prep. de away from; L. n. nitrum soda; M.L., nitrum nitrate; M.L. v. denitrifico. denitrify; and M.L. part. adj. denitrificans denitrifying). Denitrolinea (de.ni.tro.li.ne’a. L. pref. de from; L. n. nitrum nitrate; L. fem. n. linea line; N.L. fem. n. Denitrolinea line-shaped nitrate reducing), symbiosum (sym.bi.o’sum. Gr. n. symbios a companion; N.L. neut. adj. symbiosum living together with, symbiotic).Metagenomic analysis of anammox reactor. (a) Community structure analysis based on ribosomal proteins identified in the metagenome. The genomes of unisolable Ca. B. pituitae, Ca. N. proteolyticus, and Ca. D. denitrificans were reconstructed in this study, although the genome of Ca. D. symbiosum is still divided into four contigs. Taxa representing <2% of the total were classified as ‘Other’.

Dashed line indicates the predicted reaction.3.2. Genomic features of predominant ABC membersThe genome of Ca. B. pituitae consists of a single circular chromosome (4,075,302 bp) with mean G + C content of 43.4% (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. S2). We identified 3,593 protein coding sequences (CDSs), 47 tRNA genes and 3 rRNA genes. Out of the 3,593 CDSs in the Ca. B. pituitae genome, 1,138 were included in the core genome structure, comprising 1,152 OGs (Supplementary Fig. S3 and Table S2). The genomes of two other predominant species, Ca. N. proteolyticus and Ca. D. denitrificans, are also single circular chromosomes consisting of 2,809,316 and 3,145,360 bp with a higher G + C content of 61.1% and 66.7%, respectively. Although the genome of Ca. D. symbiosum is still divided into 4 contigs, this genome is thought to be nearly completed because 50 ribosomal protein genes were identified in the 4 contigs. In general, a bacterial ribosome is composed of 52 ribosomal proteins with 1 or 2 of them missing depending on the bacterial strain. Total length of the contigs is 3,705,798 bp and their mean G + C content is also as high (59.5%) as the genomes from two other predominant species (Table 1).General features of the reconstructed genomes of four major members in the anammox reactorGeneral features of the reconstructed genomes of four major members in the anammox reactorGenomic analysis of the reconstructed genomes revealed that Ca. B. pituitae possesses no nitrite reductase genes, such as nirS and nirK, and these genes were not included in the core structure of the anammox bacterial genome. In the anammox bioreactor, however, those genes were complemented by those from other ABC members (i.e. NO producers from nitrite) in the bioreactor. Of all nitrite reductases detected in the ABC bioreactor, the nirS genes derived from Ca. D. denitrificans and Ca. D. symbiosum occupied 25% and 7%, respectively (Fig. 1b). These two ABC members also possessed nitrate reductase genes (narGHI and/or napAB) but not NO reductase genes (norBC), indicating that they are imperfect denitrifiers, although norBC genes are present in other ABC members. Indeed, when a small portion of biomass granules was anaerobically incubated with ammonium and nitrite as reactive substrates, 84% of the total nitrogen emission was due to the anammox reaction, and the remaining 16% was due to denitrification. Thus, it is likely that ABC members capable of producing NO were supplying it to Ca. B. pituitae, which is able to use nitrite. Indeed, in the case of NO, 69% of the total nitrogen emission was derived from the anammox reaction (Supplementary Table S3). Expression of the nirS genes was confirmed by metatranscriptomic analysis, which showed that the gene expression level from Ca. D. denitrificans and Ca. D. symbiosum was 5- to 10-fold lower than the average level for ribosomal proteins (Supplementary Table S4). Thus, although predominant ABC members including imperfect denitrifiers such as Ca. D. denitrificans and Ca. D. symbiosum have the ability to produce and supply NO to Ca. B. pituitae, Ca. B. pituitae does not necessarily depend solely on other ABC members for NO production. If an anaerobic incubation experiment, in which NH4+is not added but only 15NO2- is added to anammox population, is performed, it is expected that 15NO2- reduction (to NO) rate would be similar to anammox rate, when anammox bacteria depend on NO supplied by cross feeding. In this experimental system, because anammox reaction consuming NO is suppressed, NO would be accumulated in the incubation vial and it has been reported that NO could enhance NO2- reduction activity.34,35 Thus, the fair comparison of reduction rate between only 15NO2- and 15NO2- + NH4+ is thought to be difficult.On the other hand, the genome of Ca. K. stuttgartiensis possesses the nirS gene, but this gene is hardly expressed at the transcriptional and protein levels compared with those encoding other key catabolic genes.12,13 In contrast, nirS is one of the highest expressed genes in the marine anammox species, Ca. Scalindua brodae.36 On the other hand, Ca. Jettenia caeni KSU1, as well as Ca. B. fulgida and Ca. B. caroliniensis, possess nirK instead of nirS, although other Brocadia species possess no such nitrite reductase (Supplementary Fig. S1). Ca. B. pituitae does not possess these genes although this species utilises nitrite, NO, and NH2OH as the substrate for anammox metabolism.Ca. N. proteolyticus was shown to be a nitrite oxidizer through the detection of nxrAB genes encoding nitrite oxidoreductase. Ca. N. proteolyticus possesses 78 genes encoding peptidases and 27 of them were predicted to be extracellular enzymes by the SOSUI program (http://harrier.nagahama-i-bio.ac.jp/sosui/). Although the expression level varied depending on the individual gene, almost all peptidase genes were expressed (Supplementary Table S5). Such a large number of peptidase genes were not observed in other reconstructed genomes. In addition, this species possesses 32 genes encoding cell wall-associated enzymes such as glycosyl transferase, lytic transglycosidase, and cell wall-associated hydrolase assisting in adherence, autoaggregation, turnover of cell wall and autolysis.37–39 Out of those genes, 22 genes containing 6 secretory soluble enzyme genes were expressed with various expression levels (Supplementary Table S6). Since Ca. N. proteolyticus also possesses multiple expressed genes related to Type II secretory pathway (Supplementary Table S7), many of the peptidase and cell wall-associated enzymes are presumably secreted via Type II secretory pathway.40 It is not yet clear how ABC members are selected and maintained, but it seems that the members of anammox bioreactors using non-woven fabric as a carrier share some common features. In fact, because 16S rRNA genes with more than 99% identity to that of Ca. N. proteolyticus have been detected in many other anammox bioreactors,41,42 this microbe was inevitably suggested to be an ABC member responsible for nitrite oxidation via consumption of O2 in the anammox bioreactor. Ca. N. proteolyticus is one of nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOBs), but it has no potential for carbon fixation unlike the other NOBs (Supplementary Table S10) although the bioreactor is maintained through feeding with a synthetic inorganic medium containing sodium bicarbonate as the sole carbon source. Given such operating conditions, the immediate question of how Ca. N. proteolyticus cells acquire nutrients and are keeping their population in the bioreactor arises.Since Ca. N. proteolyticus possesses multiple secretory peptidases and lytic transglycosidases (which are expected to be attractive new targets for the development of broad-spectrum antibiotics38) and also Type II secretion systems,40 it is possible that proteolysis of biomass from autolysed old cells and also the lysis of active ABC members sensitive to these enzymes may supply nutrients to Ca. N. proteolyticus itself and to other heterotrophic predominant species such as Ca. D. denitrificans and Ca. D. symbiosum, for maintaining their populations. In fact, ABC members in the anammox bioreactor repeat cell metabolism, but cannot maintain an active cell population in the reactor unless biomass from old cells is properly reused. In addition, keeping the population balance of ABC members is considered to be an important factor in maintaining stable anammox activity. In that sense, Ca. N. proteolyticus possessing high proteolysis potential must be one of the important key species necessary for keeping balanced population of ABC members and the stable anammox activity in the bioreactor.On the other hand, imperfect denitrifiers, Ca. D. denitrificans and Ca. D. symbiosum, commonly appeared even in the ABC of anaerobically controlled anammox bioreactor. In fact, the genes with 98–99% identities to Ca. D. denitrificans (bin ID: PRO2, ß-proteobacteria) and Ca. D. symbiosum (bin ID: CFX3, Chloroflexi) were detected in the metagenomic sequences from this bioreactor although their abundance is very low (1%>).5 Therefore, the involvement of these common ABC members in anammox metabolism may be related to the difficulty of isolating anammox bacteria.3.3. Placement of nitrite reductase gene on the anammox bacterial genome and its phylogenyAs mentioned earlier, anammox bacteria do not necessarily possess NirK and NirS-type nitrite reductase genes but where and how their genes are located on the anammox genome is still a question. In fact, Ca. Brocadia sp. UTAMX2, (identified as Ca. B. fulgida based on the results of phylogenetic and genomic identity analyses; Supplementary Fig. S2 and Table S1), and J. caeni KSU1, possess the nirK gene unlike Ca. B. pituitae. In contrast, Ca. K. stuttgartiensis possesses the nirS gene, and Ca. Scalindua rubra BSI-1 possesses both genes. A comparison of the genome structure near nirK with those of other anammox bacteria that lack the gene revealed that the nirK in the KSU1 genome is positioned between the core gene set together with an insertion sequence (IS) belonging to the IS630 family43 (Fig. 2). In addition, the nirK gene was incidentally inserted at the same position of the UTAMX2 genome, even though there was no IS element nearby. This mobile gene-like behaviour makes it clear that the nirK gene was acquired by horizontal gene transfer. Different types of ISs have also been found in this region of Ca. K. stuttgartiensis and of Ca. B. sinica,44 which lacks the nirK gene. Indeed, Ca. K. stuttgartiensis and Ca. B. pituitae genomes contain 74 and 68 transposase genes for ISs, respectively, belonging to IS families IS630, IS4, and ISL3, which are widely disseminated throughout various bacterial genomes.43,45 These foreign nirK genes exhibit 67% identity with each other, but their ancestral host organism is unknown. The nirK gene has also been detected in Ca. Scalindua draft genomes with low completeness, but whether it was acquired by the same route as the other two genes remains unknown.Comparison of gene organization around the nirK gene among anammox bacteria. Gene organization was compared among six anammox bacteria with and without the nirK gene. Genomic fragments containing nirK or the corresponding region were extracted from four nearly completed draft genomes and two completed genomes, and then aligned.

K. stuttg: Kuenenia stuttgartiensis, B: Brocadia, J: Jettenia.To identify the ancestral host organism, we constructed an unrooted phylogenetic tree based on the amino acid sequences of NirK protein. Ca. Brocadia5,6 and Ca. Jettenia46,47 species formed a cluster together with Methylomarinum vadi in <U+03B3>-proteobacteria, and two Ca. Scalindua species independently formed their own cluster, although all anammox bacteria were classified into the family Brocadiaceae (Fig. 3a). Proteobacteria formed a large cluster comprising four subdivisions (a, ß, <U+03B3>, and d), but some of the species in ß- and <U+03B3>-proteobacteria formed another small cluster with other taxa. Given the complicated phylogenetic relationships among NirK protein clusters, except for the major Proteobacteria cluster, it appears that anammox bacteria did not necessarily acquire the nirK gene from monophyly. In addition, the nirS genes of Ca. Kuenenia and Ca. Scalindua species did not form a cluster, but Ca. Kuenenia formed a cluster with subsets of ß-proteobacteria and d-proteobacteria, whereas Ca. Scalindua formed a cluster with the Parcubacteria within the unclassified bacteria group (Fig. 3b). Because the nirS gene, like the nirK gene, was also not horizontally acquired from monophyly (Fig. 3b), it was not possible to determine the original taxonomic affiliation of the nitrite reductase gene acquired in the anammox bacteria genome.Phylogenetic position of NirK and NirS proteins identified in anammox bacteria.

Metabolic and physiological potential harboured in the reconstructed genomesTo examine metabolic and physiological potential harboured in the anammox bacterial genomes, we applied Ca. J. caeni and Ca. B. sinica genomes reconstructed to less than five contigs together with the two complete genomes (Ca. B. pituitae and Ca. K. stuttgartiensis) to GenomapleTM and compared the patterns of MCR and Q-value among the four anammox bacteria (Supplementary Table S9). We found that their pattern is quite similar among the four species through all KEGG modules. In the pathway modules, when completed modules or modules with a Q-value of < 0.5 (i.e. suggesting high working probability of the module) were picked up in each species, only Brocadia species had the module for undecaprenyl phosphate alpha-L-Ara4N biosynthesis (M00761) involved in amino and nucleotide sugar metabolism despite the fact that this is <U+03B3>-proteobacteria-specific rare module (Supplementary Fig. S4). In contrast, Euryarchaeota/Planctomyces-specific rare module for haem biosynthesis (M00847) was incomplete only in Ca. B. sinica. Since there was no noticeable difference regarding the other pathway modules, we inferred that there is no difference in the basic anabolic potential of the four major anammox bacteria.In general, NOB have an ability to fix carbon through Calvin cycle,48 but Ca. N. proteolyticus has only enzymes involved in 5 reaction steps of the module for Calvin cycle (M00165), which comprises 11 reaction steps (i.e. MCR: 54.5%). On the other hand, a complete ammonia oxidizer (Comammox) can use reductive citrate cycle for carbon fixation,49 but Ca. N. proteolyticus has no ATP citrate lyase and citryl-CoA synthetase, which are key enzymes for this cycle. So far, seven carbon fixation pathways including these two are known, but Ca. N. proteolyticus does not have any of them and thus it seems to lack carbon fixation ability unlike the other NOBs (Supplementary Table S10). On the other hand, one of the incomplete denitrifiers, Ca. D. denitrificans, was found to complete the module for dissimilatory sulphur reduction (M00596) unlike Ca. D. symbiosum.3.5. Orthologous analysis of Hao-like protein genes in anammox bacteriaHao catalyses oxidation of NH2OH to NO2- or NO in the nitrification process of ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB).9 On the other hand, Hao-like proteins are predicted to be the most likely candidate enzymes catalysing NO2- reduction to NO in Ca. K. stuttgartiensis10,12 and Ca. Scalindua profunda40 and to NH2OH in Ca. B. sinica.7Ca. B. pituitae possesses nine paralogous genes encoding Hao-like proteins, similar to other anammox bacteria. Thus, we first classified hao- and hao-like genes identified in typical AOB and all available anammox bacterial genomes through clustering analysis. We designated them as hao1–hao10 and one of the large independent clusters, hao5, was divided into two groups, hao5A and hao5B and the hao8 cluster constructed a large one with the AOB hao cluster (Fig. 4). As a result, Ca. B. pituitae was found to possess all genes categorized into hao1–hao 9 except for hao10, which is specific to Ca. Scalindua. Among those genes, at least 5 (hao1–hao4 and hao5B) were found in the core genome whereas Ca. B. sinica is missing hao5B gene (Fig. 5a and b). The genes encoding hydrazine synthase subunit A, B, and C (hzsABC) and hydrazine oxidoreductase (hzo), which are responsible for the main anammox reaction (Fig. 1), and nitrite oxidase (nxrAB) are also included in the core genome (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Table S10). Ca. B. fulgida UTMX2 and Ca. J. caeni KSU1 possessed the same hao-like gene repertoire as Ca. B. pituitae, but Ca. K. stuttgartiensis were missing hao8 and hao9 genes.Phylogenetic tree of Hao-like proteins.

B. pituitae genome to other anammox bacterial with nearly complete genome.The expression of KSMBR1_2670 gene (formerly kustc1061) corresponding to hao1 (Fig. 5), and its gene products have been experimentally confirmed as hydroxylamine oxidase in Ca. K. stuttgartiensis. In addition, the expression of KSMBR1_2163 (formerly kustc0458) and KSMBR1_3792 (formerly kustc4574) genes corresponding to hao2 and hao3, respectively, has also been confirmed along with their gene products.8 Based on protein sequence analyses, it has been postulated that the KSMBR1_2163 (hao2) and KSMBR1_3792 (hao3) genes encode the elusive nitrite reductases reducing nitrite to NO in Ca. K. stuttgartiensis. However, Ca. B. sinica JPN1 as well as Ca. B. pituitae lack the genes encoding canonical NO-producing nitrite reductases (i.e. nirS and nirK; Fig. 5b). Reduction of nitrite to NH2OH and not NO was confirmed by 15N-tracer experiments in Ca. B. sinica although the enzyme responsible for this reaction is still unidentified. It was also confirmed that this species utilises NH2OH and NH4+<U+2060>, but not NO and NH4+ for N2H4 synthesis, which is downstream of nitrite reduction, demonstrating that the anammox metabolism of Ca. B. sinica is NH2OH-dependent.7 We also confirmed that Ca. B. pituitae can utilise NH2OH and NH4+ for anammox metabolism similar to Ca. B. sinica (Supplementary Fig. S5). Oshiki et al.7 speculated that Hao-like proteins are the most likely candidate enzymes catalysing nitrite reduction to NH2OH because NH4+-forming pentahaem cytochrome c nitrite reductase has evolved to octahaem cytochrome c protein (Hao)50–52 and this Hao protein is capable of reduction of nitrite to NH2OH using electrons shuffled from quinone pools by a membrane-anchored cytochrome c protein that appeared during the evolutionary process.53,54 High expression of genes corresponding to hao1–hao3 and hao5A (BROSI_A2677, BROSI_A0131, BROSI_A0501, and BROSI_A3864) was observed in Ca. B. sinica JPN1, and the expression levels of those genes were lower under conditions unfavourable for anammox metabolism.54 Through a series of experimental results, they arrived at BROSI_A0501 (hao3) as the most plausible candidate gene responsible for nitrite reduction to NH2OH. In addition, it was suggested that NH2OH-forming nitrite reductase is involved in nitrite reduction by Ca. B. sinica by difference in nitrogen isotope fractionation in comparison with anammox bacteria possessing NO-forming enzymes.55 Out of the five Brocadia species, only Ca. B. sinica lacks hao5B gene included in the core genome. Ca. B. fulgida lacks hao5A, whereas hao5B is duplicated in its genome (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. S2). Although the function of hao5B is still unknown, since both Ca. K. stuttgartiensis and Ca. B. pituitae possess hao5B together with hao2 and hao3 and can utilize NO for N2H4 synthesis, there could be some relationship between the presence of hao5B and the availability of NO.On the other hand, all hao-like genes in Ca. B. pituitae genome are expressed at various expression levels under regular operational conditions of an anammox bioreactor. High RPKM ratio of more than 10 was observed in several core genes, hao1, hao2, and hao5B, and the hao3 gene was also significantly expressed with the RPKM ratio of 3.09 (Supplementary Table S4). As predicted in Ca. K. stuttgartiensis and Ca. B. sinica, assuming hao2 and hao3 encode NO- and NH2OH-forming nitrite reductase, respectively, it is possible that Ca. B. pituitae reduces nitrite to NO and NH2OH using these enzymes and utilize them for N2H4 biosynthesis. Although details are unclear as yet, the expression of these two genes may be regulated in response to the environment in the anammox bioreactor. Therefore, Ca. B. pituitae presumably utilizes not only NO supplied by the ABC members, but also NO and NH2OH by self-production for anammox metabolism.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at DNARES online.We thank Profs K.

In this study, genome sequence information was obtained to explore effective DNA markers and the causative genes for double flower production in hydrangea. Single-molecule real-time sequencing data followed by a Hi-C analysis were employed. Two haplotype-phased sequences were obtained from the heterozygous genome of hydrangea. One assembly consisted of 3,779 scaffolds (2.256 Gb in length and N50 of 1.5 Mb), the other also contained 3,779 scaffolds (2.227 Gb in length, and N50 of 1.4 Mb). A total of 36,930 genes were predicted in the sequences, of which 32,205 and 32,222 were found in each haplotype. A pair of 18 pseudomolecules was constructed along with a high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genetic linkage map. Using the genome sequence data, and two F2 populations, the SNPs linked to double flower loci (djo and dsu) were discovered. DNA markers linked to djo and dsu were developed, and these could distinguish the recessive double flower allele for each locus, respectively. The LEAFY gene is a very likely candidate as the causative gene for dsu, since frameshift was specifically observed in the double flower accession with dsu.1. IntroductionHydrangea macrophylla (Thunb.) Ser., commonly known as hydrangea, originated in Japan, and since it is the place of origin, there are rich genetic resources for this species there. Wild hydrangea accessions with superior characteristics have been used as breeding parents to create attractive cultivars, and it has a long history of use as an ornamental garden plant in temperate regions. In hydrangea, there are both decorative and non-decorative flowers within groups of flowers on the stems of the Hydrangea inflorescence. Decorative flowers have large ornamental petaloid sepals that attract pollinators, whereas non-decorative flowers have inconspicuous perianths with normal sepals that instead of play a major role in seed production.1–3 In hydrangea, there are two decorative flower phenotypes: a single flower and double flower. Single flowers generally have four petaloid sepals per decorative flower, while in double flowers, it is approximately fourteen.4 Double flowers do not have stamens or petals in the decorative flower.4 Therefore, petals and stamens could be converted to petaloid sepals since the number of petaloid sepals increases, and stamens and petals are lost. Because of their high ornamental value, the production of double flowers is an important breeding target in hydrangea cultivation.The double flower cultivars ‘Sumidanohanabi’ (Fig. 1A) and ‘Jogasaki’ (Fig. 1B) have been used as breeding parents in Japan4 to obtain double flower progenies. Both cultivars lack stamens and petals and show increased petaloid sepals in their decorative flowers compared with single flower cultivars (Supplementary Fig. S1A–C). For non-decorative flowers, while they lack stamen similar to decorative flowers, slightly sepaloid petals are observed which increased its number (Supplementary Fig. S1D–F). Sepals in non-decorative flowers are observed in both single and double flower accessions (Supplementary Fig. S1G and H). Because both double flower cultivars lack stamen, they could not be used as pollen parents. However, these cultivars still have fertile pistils, they could be used as seed parent. Previous studies have suggested that the double flower phenotype is a recessive trait controlled by a single major gene.4,5 Suyama et al.4 found that crosses between the progeny of ‘Sumidanohanabi’ and the progeny of ‘Jogasaki’ produced only single flower descendants. Thus, it was also suggested that the genes controlling the double flower phenotype are different.4 We named the double flower locus dsu as the locus controlling the double flower phenotype of ‘Sumidanohanabi’ and the double flower locus djo as the locus controlling the double flower phenotype of ‘Jogasaki.’ Waki et al.5 identified dsu on the genetic linkage map. They also found that the DNA marker STAB045 was the closest marker to dsu and that STAB045 could help distinguish flower phenotypes with a high degree of agreement. Contrarily, djo has not been identified, and the DNA marker linked to djo has not been developed. It is still not known whether djo and dsu are at the same loci.Flower phenotypes of hydrangea accessions. A: ‘Sumidanohanabi’ (double flower). B: ‘Jogasaki’ (double flower). C: ‘Posy Bouquet Grace’ (double flower). D: ‘Blue Picotee Manaslu’ (single flower). E: ‘Kirakiraboshi’ (double flower). F: ‘Frau Yoshimi’ (single flower).Flower phenotypes of hydrangea accessions. A: ‘Sumidanohanabi’ (double flower). B: ‘Jogasaki’ (double flower). C: ‘Posy Bouquet Grace’ (double flower). D: ‘Blue Picotee Manaslu’ (single flower). E: ‘Kirakiraboshi’ (double flower). F: ‘Frau Yoshimi’ (single flower).The mechanisms and genes controlling the double flower phenotype in hydrangea have not been clarified. Waki et al.5 hypothesized that the mutation of C-class genes could be associated with the double flower phenotype of ‘Sumidanohanabi’ since the C-class gene mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana and C-class gene-repressed petunias produce double flowers.6 However, the double flower phenotype of hydrangea is morphologically different from that of Arabidopsis thaliana and petunia: petals and stamens converted to petaloid sepals, while stamens converted to petals in Arabidopsis thaiana and petunia. This suggests that the genes controlling double flower production in hydrangea differ from genes controlling double flower production in other plant species. Identification of the genes controlling double flower production in hydrangea could reveal novel regulatory mechanisms of flower development.Genomic information is essential for DNA marker development and identification of genes controlling specific phenotypes. However, no reference genome sequence is publicly available for hydrangea so far. Although a genome assembly of hydrangea (1.6 Gb) using only short-read data has been reported,7 the resultant assembly is so fragmented that it comprises 1,519,429 contigs with an N50 size 2,447 bp, and has not been disclosed. Improved, advanced long-read technologies and bioinformatics methods would make it possible to determine the sequences of complex genomes. An assembly strategy for single-molecule real-time sequencing data followed by a Hi-C analysis has been developed to generate haplotype-phased sequences in heterozygous regions of diploid genomes.8 Genome sequences at the chromosome level could be obtained with a Hi-C clustering analysis9 and a genetic linkage analysis.10 Such a genomic sequence could provide basic information to identify genes and DNA markers of interest and to discover allelic sequence variations. In this study, we constructed the genomic DNA sequence, obtained single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) information, and performed gene prediction. We also developed DNA markers linked to djo using SNP information obtained by double digest restriction site associated DNA sequence (ddRAD-Seq) analysis of the F2 mapping population 12GM1, which segregated double flower phenotypes of djo. In addition, we attempted to identify the causative genes for djo and dsu.2. Materials and methods2.1. De novo assembly of the hydrangea genomeFor genomic DNA sequencing, H. macrophylla ‘Aogashima-1,’ collected from Aogashima Island of the Izu Islands in the Tokyo Prefecture, Japan, was used. Genomic DNA was extracted from the young leaves using Genomic-Tip (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). First, we constructed a sequencing library (insert size 500 bp) with TruSeq DNA PCR-Free Library Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) to sequence on HiSeqX (Illumina). The size of the ‘Aogashima-1’ genome was estimated using Jellyfish v2.1.4.11 After removing the adapter sequences and trimming low-quality reads, high-quality reads were assembled using Platanus.12 The resultant sequences were designated HMA_r0.1. The completeness of the assembly was assessed with sets of BUSCO v.1.1b.13Next, an PacBio single molecule, real-Time (SMRT) library was constructed with the SMRTbell Express Template Prep Kit 2.0 (PacBio, Menlo Park, CA, USA) in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol and sequenced using SMRT Cell v2.1 on a Sequel System. The sequence reads were assembled using FALCON v.1.8.814 to generate primary contig sequences and associate contigs representing alternative alleles. Haplotype-resolved assemblies (i.e. haplotigs) were generated using FALCON-Unzip v.1.8.8.14 Potential sequence errors in the contigs were corrected twice with ARROW v.2.2.1 implemented in SMRT Link v.5.0 (PacBio) followed by one polishing with Pilon.15 The resultant sequences were designated HMA_r1.0. Subsequently, a Hi-C library was constructed with Proximo Hi-C (Plant) Kit (Phase Genomics, Seattle, WA, USA) and sequenced on HiSeqX (Illumina). After removing the adapter sequences and trimming the low-quality reads, high-quality Hi-C reads were used to generate two haplotype-phased sequences (Phase 0 and Phase 1) from the primary contigs and haplotig sequences with FALCON-Phase.8 The resultant sequences were designated HMA_r1.1. Haplotype phase 0 was derived from one of a pair of homologous chromosomes of ‘Aogashima-1’, and the haplotype phase 1 was derived from other ‘Aogashima-1’ chromosomes.To validate the accuracy of the sequences, we developed a genetic map based on SNPs, from a ddRAD-Seq analysis on the 12GM1, F2 mapping population (n = 147), maintained at the Fukuoka Agriculture and Forestry Research Center, Japan. The 12GM1 population was generated from a cross between ‘Posy Bouquet Grace’ (Fig. 1C) and ‘Blue Picotee Manaslu’ (Fig. 1D). Genomic DNA was extracted from the leaves with a DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen). A ddRAD-Seq library was constructed as described by Shirasawa et al.16 and sequenced with HiSeq4000. Sequence reads were processed as described by Shirasawa et al.16 and mapped on the HMA_r1.1 as a reference. From the mapping alignment, high-confidence biallelic SNPs were obtained with the following filtering options: –minDP 5 –minQ 10 –max-missing 0.5. The genetic map was constructed using Lep-Map3.17Potential mis-jointed points in Phase 0 and 1 sequences of HMA_r1.1 were cut and re-joined, based on the marker order in the genetic map. The resultant sequences were named HMA_r1.2. Haplotype-phased pseudomolecule sequences were generated based on HMA_r1.2 and genetic map using ALLMAPS.18 The resultant sequences were named HMA_r1.2.pmol, as two haplotype-phased pseudomolecule sequences of the ‘Aogashima-1’ genome. Sequences that were unassigned to the genetic map were connected and termed chromosome 0. The constructed pseudomolecule sequence was corresponded with the previously reported SSR marker-based genetic linkage map5 by a BLAST search of simple sequence repeat (SSR) marker sequences. SSR markers that were included in the hydrangea genetic linkage map5 were searched for HMA_r1.2.pmol. When more than two SSR markers in a linkage group were located on the same pseudomolecule, the pseudomolecule was treated as corresponded to the genetic linkage map. The nomenclature of the pseudomolecule number was assigned in accordance with linkage group number of the genetic map.52.2. Gene predictionFor gene prediction, we performed an Iso-Seq analysis. Total RNA was extracted from 12 samples of ‘Aogashima-1’: flower buds (2 stages); decorative flowers (2 stages); coloured and colourless non-decorative flowers; fruits; stem; roots; leaf buds and one-day light-intercepted leaves and buds. In addition, the mixed sample (Sample No. 29) listed in Supplementary Table S1 was included. Iso-Seq libraries were prepared following the manufacture’s Iso-Seq Express Template Preparation (PacBio) protocol and sequenced on a Sequel System (PacBio). The raw reads obtained were treated with ISO-Seq3 pipeline, implemented in SMRT Link v.5.0 (PacBio) to generate full-length, high-quality consensus isoforms. In parallel, RNA-Seq data were also obtained from the 16 samples listed in Supplementary Table S1. Total RNA extracted from the samples was converted into cDNA and sequenced on HiSeq2000, Hiseq2500 (Illumina), and NovaSeq6000 (Illumina). The Iso-Seq isoform sequences and the RNA-Seq short-reads were employed for gene prediction.We used ab-initio-, evidence-, and homology-based gene prediction methods to identify putative protein-encoding genes in the genome assemblies. For this prediction, unigene sets generated from (i) the Iso-Seq isoforms; (ii) de novo assembly of the RNA-Seq short-reads with Trinity-v2.4.019; (iii) peptide sequences predicted from the genomes of Arabidopsis thaliana, Arachis hypogaea, Cannabis sativa, Capsicum annuum, Cucumis sativus, Populus trichocarpa, and Quercus lobata; and (iv) ab-initio genes, were predicted with Augustus-v3.3.1.20 The unigene sequences were aligned onto the genome assembly with BLAT,21 and the genome positions of the genes were listed in general feature format version 3 with blat2gff.pl (https://github.com/vikas0633/perl/blob/master/blat2gff.pl)(12 November 2020, date last accessed). Gene annotation was performed with Hayai-annotation Plants.22 Completeness of the gene prediction was assessed with sets of BUSCO v4.0.6.132.3. Detection of SNPs linked to double flower phenotypeFor identification of SNPs linked to double flower loci djo and dsu, ddRAD-Seq data analysis was performed. ddRAD-Seq data of the 12GM1 population described above were used to identify djo. For identification of SNPs linked to double flower locus dsu, KF population5—93 F2 individuals of ‘Kirakiraboshi’ (Fig. 1E) and ‘Frau Yoshimi’ (Fig. 1F)—were used for ddRAD-Seq analysis. The KF population was maintained at the Tochigi Prefectural Agricultural Experimental Station, Japan. ddRAD-Seq analysis of the KF population was performed using the same method used for the 12GM1 population.ddRAD-Seq data of the 12GM1 and KF populations were processed as follows: low-quality sequences were removed, and adapters were trimmed using Trimmomatic-0.3623 (LEADING : 10, TRAILING : 10, SLIDING WINDOW: 4:15, MINLEN : 51). BWA-MEM (v 0.7.15-r1140) was used for mapping to the genome sequence. The resultant sequence alignment/map format files were converted to binary sequence alignment/map format files and subjected to SNP calling using the mpileup option of SAMtools24 (v 1.4.1) and the view option of BCFtools (parameter -vcg). If the DP of called SNP in individuals was under 5%, the genotype was treated as missing. SNPs with 5% or more of missing genotype were filtered out. Each SNP was evaluated for its degree of agreement with the flower phenotype. The degree of agreement with the flower phenotype was calculated as the percentage of individuals agreeing with the model (double flower phenotype is observed when homozygous of allele is from the double flower parent, while single flower phenotype is observed when heterozygous or homozygous of allele is from the single flower parent) among the population.2.4. DNA marker development and analysis for djoCleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) markers were designed based on SNPs that were completely co-segregated to the double flower locus djo. Primers were designed using Primer325 under conditions with product size ranging from 150 to 350 bp, primer size from 18 to 27 bp, and primer TM from 57 to 63°C. PCR assays were conducted in a total volume of 10 µL, containing 5 µL of GoTaq Master Mix (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), 1 mM each of forward and reverse primer, and 5 ng of template DNA. The PCR conditions were 94°C for 2 min, 35 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 1 min, annealing at 55°C for 1 min, and extension at 72°C for 1 min; and a final extension step at 72°C for 3 min. Subsequently, restriction enzyme assay was conducted in a total volume of 10 µL, containing 5 µL PCR product and 10 units of restriction enzyme. The restriction assay product was stained with 1× GRRED (Biocraft, Tokyo, Japan) and separated in 1.5% (w/v) agarose gel in Tris-acetate-EDTA (TAE) buffer. The CAPS marker, whose genotype was coincident with the SNP genotype in the 12GM1 population, was selected as the relevant marker. The relevant CAPS marker named J01 was designed from SNP on scaffold : 0008 F-2, position: 780104. The primer sequences of J01 were: Forward: 5'-CTGGCAGATTCCTCCTGAC-3' and Reverse: 5'-TATTTCCTTGGGGAGGCTCT-3'. A restriction enzyme assay was performed at 65°C for 3 h using Taq I (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). CAPS marker J01 was applied to the 14GT77 population (64 F2 individuals of ‘Posy Bouquet Grace’ × ‘Chibori’) and the 15IJP1 population (98 F1 individuals of ‘Izunohana’ × 03JP1) in addition to the 12GM1 population that segregate the double flower locus djo.2.5. Resequencing and comparison of LEAFY gene sequence and DNA marker developmentWe performed resequencing of genomic DNA to compare sequences for accessions of ‘Kirakiraboshi,’ ‘Frau Yoshimi,’ ‘Posy Bouquet Grace,’ and ‘Blue Picotee Manaslu.’ Sequencing libraries (insert size 500 bp) for the four lines were constructed with TruSeq DNA PCR-Free Library Prep Kit (Illumina) to sequence on a HiSeqX (Illumina). From the sequence reads obtained, low-quality bases were deleted with PRINSEQ v0.20.4,26 and adaptor sequences were trimmed with fastx clipper (parameter, -a AGATCGGAAGAGC) in FASTX-Toolkit v. 0.0.13 (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit)(12 November 2020, date last accessed). High-quality reads were aligned on HMA_r1.2 with Bowtie227 v. 2.2.3 to detect sequence variant candidates using the mpileup command in SAMtools v 0.1.19.24 High-confidence variants were selected using VCFtools28 v. 0.1.12b with parameters of –minDP 10, –maxDP 100, –minQ 999, –max-missing 1.For comparison of the LEAFY (LFY) sequence in ‘Kirakiraboshi,’ ‘Frau Yoshimi,’ ‘Posy Bouquet Grace,’ and ‘Blue Picotee Manaslu,’ BLAST analysis was performed to confirm detected sequence variants using the genomic sequence of LFY (Scaffold 0577 F, position 678200-684639) as query, and the genomic DNA sequence of each cultivar as the database. These data analyses were performed using CLC main workbench (Qiagen). INDEL marker S01 that amplifies the second intron of LFY, was designed by visual inspection (Forward: 5'-CATCATTAATAGTGGTGACAG-3', Reverse: 5'-CACACATGAATTAGTAGCTC-3'). The PCR conditions were 94°C for 2 min, 35 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 1 min, annealing at 55°C for 1 min, extension at 72°C for 1 min; and a final extension step at 72°C for 3 min. The PCR product was stained with 1x GRRED (Biocraft) and separated in 2.5% (w/v) agarose gel in TAE buffer.2.6. Cloning and sequence determination of LFY gene of ‘Kirakiraboshi’ and ‘Frau Yoshimi’Total RNA was isolated from flower buds of ‘Kirakiraboshi’ and ‘Frau Yoshimi’ using RNAiso Plus (TaKaRa, Japan), and reverse transcribed using a PrimeScript II 1st strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (TaKaRa, Japan). The sequence of the LFY gene was amplified by PCR in a 50-µL reaction mixture using TaKaRa Ex Taq Hot Start Version (TaKaRa Bio, Shiga, Japan) and the LFY specific primer (Forward: 5'-ATGGCTCCACTACCTCCACC-3' and Reverse: 5'-CTAACACCCTCTAAAAGCAG-3'). These PCR products were purified and inserted into a pMD20-T vector using a Mighty TA-cloning kit (TaKaRa Bio). The sequence of the LFY coding sequence (CDS) in the pMD20-T vector was analysed using a 3130xl Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) for DNA sequencing. Sequence alignments were obtained using the CLC main workbench (Qiagen).2.7. DNA marker assessment across hydrangea accessionsThirty-five H. macrophylla accessions were used for the assessment of DNA markers for the double flower phenotype. Genotyping for J01 was performed as described above. Genotyping for S01 was performed by fragment analysis as follows. PCR amplification was performed in a 10-µL reaction mixture containing 5 µL of GoTaq Master Mix (Promega), 5 pmol FAM-labeled universal primer (5'- FAM-gctacggactgacctcggac -3'), 2.5 pmol forward primer with universal adapter sequence (5'- gctacggactgacctcggacCATCATTAATAGTGGTGACAG -3'), 5 pmol reverse primer, and 5 ng of template DNA. DNA was amplified in 35 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 55°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 2 min; and a final extension of 5 min at 72°C. The amplified PCR products were separated and detected with a PRISM 3130xl Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, USA). The sizes of the amplified bands were scored against internal-standard DNA (400HD-ROX, Applied Biosystems, USA) with GeneMapper software (Applied Biosystems, USA).3. Results and discussion3.1. Draft genome assembly with long-read and Hi-C technologiesThe size of the hydrangea genome was estimated by k-mer-distribution analysis with the short-read of 132.3 Gb data. The resultant distribution pattern indicated two peaks, representing homozygous (right peak) and heterozygous (left peak) genomes, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S2). The haploid genome of hydrangea was estimated to be 2.2 Gb in size. The short-reads were assembled into 612,846 scaffold sequences. The total length of the resultant scaffolds, i.e. HMA_r0.1, was 1.7 Gb with an N50 length of 9.1 kb (Supplementary Table S2). Only 72.2% of complete single-copy orthologues in plant genomes were identified by BUSCO analysis (Supplementary Table S2).Next, we employed long sequence technology to extend the sequence contiguity and to improve the genome coverage. A total of 106.9 Gb of reads (48.6× genome coverage) with an N50 read length of 28.8 kb was obtained from 14 SMRT Cells. The long-reads were assembled, followed by sequence error corrections into 15,791 contigs consisting of 3,779 primary contigs (2.178 Gb in length and N50 of 1.4 Mb), and 12,012 haplotig sequences (1.436 Gb in length and N50 of 184 kb). These resultant sequences were named HMA_r1.0 (Supplementary Table S2). To obtain two haplotype-phased complete-length sequences, 697 M reads of Hi-C data (105.3 Gb) were obtained and subjected to FALCON-Phase. The resultant haplotype-phased sequences, i.e. HMA_r.1.1, consisted of 3,779 scaffolds (2.256 Gb in length and N50 of 1.5 Mb) for Phase 0, and 3,779 scaffolds (2.227 Gb in length, and N50 of 1.4 Mb) for Phase 1 (Supplementary Table S2).3.2. Pseudomolecule sequences based on genetic mappingTo detect potential errors in the assembly and to assign the contig sequences onto the hydrangea chromosomes, we established an F2 genetic map based on SNPs derived from ddRAD-Seq analysis. Approximately 1.8 million high-quality ddRAD-Seq reads per sample were obtained from the mapping population and mapped to the Phase 0 and Phase 1 sequences, with alignment rates of 88.4% and 88.7%, respectively. A set of SNPs detected from the alignments were classified into 18 groups and ordered to construct two genetic maps for the two-phased sequences (2,849.3 cM in length with 3,980 SNPs 2,944.5 cM in length with 4,071 SNPs). The phased sequences were aligned on each genetic map to establish haplotype-phased, chromosome-level pseudomolecule sequences. During this process, one contig was cut due to possible mis-assembly and was designated as HMA_r1.2. The resultant pseudomolecule sequence HMA_r1.2.pmol for Phase 0 had 730 contigs with a total length of 1,078 Mb, and the other for Phase 1 had 743 contigs spanning 1,076 Mb. The pseudomolecule was named in accordance with the nomenclature of the previous genetic map based on SSRs.5 HMA_r1.2.pmol included 36 pseudomolecule sequences of CHR01 to CHR18 for Phase 0 and Phase 1, which corresponded to the chromosome number of the diploid H. macrophylla genome (2n = 36).29 Correspondence between the pseudomolecule sequence and previous genetic linkage map5 is shown in Supplementary Table S3.3.3. Transcriptome analysis followed by gene predictionIn the Iso-Seq analysis Circular Consensus Sequence (CCS) reads were generated from the raw sequence reads. The CCS reads were classified as full-length and non-full-length reads, and the full-length reads were clustered to produce consensus isoforms. In total, 116,634 high-quality isoforms were used for gene prediction, while, in the RNA-Seq analysis, a total of 80.7 Gb reads were obtained and assembled into 12,265 unigenes. The high-quality isoforms and unigenes, together with gene sequences predicted from the Arabidopsis thaliana, Arachis hypogaea, Cannabis sativa, Capsicum annuum, Cucumis sativus, Populus trichocarpa, and Quercus lobate genomes were aligned onto the assembly sequence of the hydrangea genome. By adding ab-initio on the genes, a total of 36,930 putative protein-encoding genes were predicted in the hydrangea genome, out of which 32,205 and 32,222 genes were found in the Phase 0 and Phase 1 sequences. The 36,930 genes included 89.9% complete BUSCOs.3.4. Identification of SNPs tightly linked to double flower phenotype djoTo identify SNPs tightly linked to the djo derived double flower phenotype of ‘Jogasaki,’ ddRAD-Seq analysis was performed on the 12GM1 population, which segregates the double flower phenotype of ‘Jogasaki.’ According to data of variety under Plant Variety Protection (http://www.hinshu2.maff.go.jp/)(12 November 2020, date last accessed), ‘Posy Bouquet Grace’ was obtained by a cross between ‘Jogasaki’ derived progenies. Therefore, the double flower phenotype of ‘Posy Bouquet Grace’ and its F2 population 12GM1 should contain the djo mutation. As a result, 14,006 SNPs were called by ddRAD-Seq analysis of the 12GM1 population. In this population, the double flower phenotype was expected when the plant was homozygous for the ‘Posy Bouquet Grace’ genotype, and the single flower phenotype was expected when the plant was homozygous for ‘Blue Picotee Manaslu’ or was heterozygous. Each SNP was tested for its degree of agreement with this model. As a result, nine SNPs were found to have more than a 95% degree of agreement, and six SNPs were completely co-segregated with flower phenotype (Table 1). While these SNPs were located on 33.7 Mb to 43.8 Mb on CHR17, djo was suggested to be located at approximately 33.7 Mb to 43.8 Mb on CHR17 (Fig. 2).Loci controlling double flower phenotype on the pseudomolecule sequence HMA_r1.2 pmol. Predicted double flower loci dsu and djo are shown as boxes. SNPs with more than a 95% agreement with phenotype shown in Tables 1 and 2 are shown as horizontal lines in the boxes.

Identification of SNPs tightly linked to double flower phenotype dsuThe KF population that segregates the double flower phenotype derived from ‘Sumidanohanabi’ was used to identify SNPs linked to the double flower phenotype of ‘Sumidanohanabi.’ First, we attempted to find co-segregated scaffolds with the double flower phenotype using ddRAD-Seq analysis of the KF population. As a result of the ddRAD-Seq analysis, 15,102 of SNPs were called. In this population, the double flower phenotype was expected when the plant was homozygous for the ‘Kirakiraboshi’ genotype, and the single flower phenotype was expected when the plant was homozygous for ‘Frau Yoshimi’ or was heterozygous. Each SNP was tested for its degree of agreement with this model. As a result, five SNPs on three scaffolds were found to have more than a 95% degree of agreement with the model (Table 2). Since the SNPs on scaffold 3145 F all had the same genotype across the KF population, three loci—on scaffold 0577 F, 3145 F, 0109 F—were detected. Although the numbers of heterozygous and homozygous of ‘Frau Yoshimi’ were the same (Table 2), recombination was observed in two individuals between 0577 and 3145 F (Table 2). According to genotypes of the KF population, these three loci were tightly linked within 5 cM; 0109 F (0 cM)—3145F (3.9 cM)—0577F (5.0 cM). The scaffold 3145 and 0577 F sequences were not included in the pseudomolecule sequence because no segregated SNPs were detected on 3145 and 0577 F in the 12GM1 population. However, the SNP at position 868,569 in 0109 F was found at position 57,436,162 in CHR04 (the terminal region of CHR04). Thus, these three loci and locus dsu, which control the double flower phenotype of ‘Sumidanohanabi,’ were suggested to be located at the terminal region of CHR04 (Fig. 2). Waki et al.5 reported that the dsu locus was located on linkage group KF_4, which corresponded to pseudochromosome CHR04 in this study. Therefore, our results were coincident with the previous report. It has been suggested that genes controlling the double flower phenotype differed between ‘Jogasaki’ and ‘Sumidanohanabi’ based on confirmation of the segregation ratio of crossed progenies.4 Our study revealed that the double flower phenotype of ‘Jogasaki’ was controlled by the single djo locus on CHR17, and the double flower phenotype of ‘Sumidanohanabi’ was controlled by the single dsu locus on CHR04. It is confirmed that genes controlling the double flowers djo and dsu are different as suggested by Suyama et al4.SNPs showing agreement (greater than 95%) with double flower phenotype of dsu in KF populationSNPs showing agreement (greater than 95%) with double flower phenotype of dsu in KF population3.6. Prediction of genes controlling double flower for dsu and djo from genome sequenceTo find the gene controlling dsu and djo, we searched the homeotic genes on the scaffolds shown in Tables 1 and 2. We did not find any notable homeotic gene controlling flower phenotype for djo. However, for dsu, the g182220 gene that encoded the homeotic LFY gene was found on scaffold 0577 F. To investigate the possibility that it was the causative gene for dsu, variants on LFY genomic sequence were searched to identify the ‘Kirakiraboshi’ specific mutation, using the resequencing data of ‘Kirakiraboshi,’ ‘Frau Yoshimi,’ ‘Posy Bouquet Grace,’ and ‘Blue Picotee Manaslu.’ As a result, four INDELs and five sequence variants were ‘Kirakiraboshi’ specific mutations (Fig. 3A).LFY sequence polymorphisms observed specifically in ‘Kirakiraboshi’ genomic sequence. A: Polymorphisms observed in genomic sequence of LFY. The sequence starts from the initiation codon (ATG) at 678,200 to the termination signal (TAG) at 684,639 in Phase 1 sequence of 0577F of HMA_r1.2.

Splicing variant 2 occurred loss of second exon.Cloning and sequencing of the LFY CDS were performed on ‘Kirakiraboshi’ and ‘Frau Yoshimi.’ From ‘Frau Yoshimi,’ a single CDS comprising three exons was obtained. From ‘Kirakiraboshi,’ two CDSs with splice variants were obtained. While splicing variant 1 resulted in three exons, splicing variant 2 resulted in only two exons, corresponding to the first and third splice products of splicing variant 1 (Fig. 3B, Supplementary Fig. S3). The deduced amino acid sequences were aligned using the CDSs of ‘Frau Yoshimi’ and ‘Kirakiraboshi,’ g182220 sequence, protein LFY of Arabidopsis thaliana, and protein FLO of Antirrhinum majus. While the deduced amino acid sequences of ‘Frau Yoshimi’ and g182220 showed sequence similarity in the entire region, frameshift occurred in the two splicing variants obtained from ‘Kirakiraboshi’ and the resulting products had no sequence similarity across the latter half (Fig. 4). The frameshift observed in splicing variant 1 was due to one basepair of DNA insertion in the second exon, at position 1,931 (Fig. 3A, Supplementary Fig. S3). Contrarily, the frameshift observed in splicing variant 2 was due to the complete loss of exon 2 (Fig. 3B, Supplementary Fig. S3).Alignment of LFY protein sequences.

LFY gene function in double flower of hydrangeaIn the genomic sequence of ‘Kirakiraboshi,’ an insertion was detected in the second exon of the LFY gene. This insertion resulted in a frameshift of cloned mRNA in splicing variant 1. For splicing variant 2, the lack of a second exon resulted in frameshift. Because frameshift occurred in both splicing variants of ‘Kirakiraboshi,’ it was speculated that the function of LFY was suppressed or lost in ‘Kirakiraboshi.’ LFY and its homolog FLO have been identified in many plants such as Arabidopsis thaliana and Antirrhinum majus, and are known as transcription factors for major flowering signals.30–32 Additionally, many phenotypes of Arabidopsis lfy mutants have been reported.32,33 In the lfy strong phenotype, most organs are sepal-like, or mosaic sepal/carpel organs and the sepal-like organs are characteristic of wild-type cauline leaves.34A similar phenotype has been reported in the LFY homolog mutants or transgenic plants such as the flo mutant of Antirrhinum majus,35,uni mutant of pea,36 and co-suppressed NFL transgenic tobacco.37 As stated above, when the LFY gene function is lost, petals, stamens, and carpels are likely to be replaced by sepal-like organs. In addition, when male sterility was observed in the Arabidopsis lfy mutant, female fertility was reduced due to the lack of stamens, but remained due to the persistence of the carpel.34 In the decorative flowers of hydrangea, sepals show petaloid characteristics, including pigmentation and enlarged organ size.1 In addition, the double flower derived from dsu showed male sterility and reduced female fertility. These phenotypes in double flower hydrangea are similar to lfy mutants. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the double flower phenotype of dsu is derived from the transformation of petals and stamens into sepal-like organs caused by an LFY mutation. We assumed that LFY is a causative gene of the double flower phenotype of ‘Sumidanohanabi.’However, there remain several unexplained observations in this study. The double flower of ‘Kirakiraboshi’ did not exhibit the same phenotype as the lfy mutant. Generally, the flowers of lfy or its orthologous gene mutants have only leaf-like or sepal-like organs that have chlorophyll, stomata, and trichomes, and these organs have almost no petal identity.34,35 When flowering signals in lfy mutants were completely lost, floral organs were not fully formed.34–36 It has also been reported that lfy mutants with an intermediate or weak phenotype sometimes develop petaloid organs.34 In the double flowers of ‘Kirakiraboshi,’ the floral organs keep their petal identity, have papilla cells, and are pink or blue. These phenotypes of ‘Kirakiraboshi’ might reflect partially remnant LFY function.It should be considered that another LFY gene possibly exists in the genome, and it partially compensates for the LFY function. However, according to the genomic and Iso-Seq sequences of H. macrophylla, no other LFY gene was observed. The mechanism of keeping petal identity in the floral organ of the double flower cultivar is still unknown. Comparing gene expression of LFY and LFY regulated genes between double and single flower cultivars might reveal aspects of the mechanism.3.8. Candidate causative gene for djoWhile LFY was found as a candidate gene for controlling the double flower phenotype of dsu, we could not find any candidate gene for the djo locus. One possible reason was that SNPs were not called in scaffold with the causative gene. In pseudomolecules, about half of the total length of the scaffold was not included since relevant SNPs were not called. Improvement of SNP density would be effective for discovering additional scaffolds that are tightly linked to djo. Although a candidate gene for djo could not be identified from the completely co-segregated scaffold sequencing, we predicted several candidate genes based on gene function.Because the phenotype of the djo mutant is very similar to the dsu mutant, the djo causative gene may be a gene associated with LFY, which was suggested as a candidate causative gene for the dsu mutant. The absence of petals and stamens in lfy mutant flowers in Arabidopsis has been traced back to a failure to activate the petal- and stamen-specific B-class genes APETALA3 (AP3) and PISTILLATA (PI).34 For activation of gene expression of AP3, UNUSUAL FLORAL ORGANS (UFO) is required as a transcriptional cofactor of LFY.38 It is reported that the ufo mutant showed a similar phenotype with the lfy mutant in Arabidopsis.39 According to the regulatory network, the mutation in UFO or B-class genes, could cause an increase in sepals and lack of stamens and petals.Previously, HmPI, HmAP3, and HmTM6 were identified as B-class genes in hydrangea.40,41 As HmAP3 was located on CHR13 as 0773 F.1_g216110, it was not considered as a causative gene for djo. Although HmPI was found as 0880 F.1_g231800 and HmTM6 as 0266 F.1_g601980, they were not included in the pseudomolecule. Ascertaining the loci of these genes might reveal the causative gene for djo. On the contrary to B-class genes, the UFO gene has not been reported in hydrangea. According to HMA_r1.2 scaffold sequences, the UFO gene was found as 0185 F.1g081460. Because this gene was located on pseudomolecule CHR17_ 53812239-53813558, which was adjacent to djo, it should be a candidate gene for djo. Although we could not find a loss of function mutation of UFO CDS in the djo mutant cultivar ‘Posy Bouquet Grace’ (data are not shown), it is still possible that the UFO gene function is lost. One possibility is that the loss of gene expression occurs owing to large INDEL in the promoter region of UFO. Further genome sequence comparison could clarify these possibilities.3.9. DNA marker development for djo and dsuFor the development of the CAPS marker linked to djo, SNPs that were completely co-segregated with the double flower phenotype were selected. As a result, the CAPS marker J01 was successfully developed based on the SNP at scaffold 0008F-2_780104. The J01 CAPS marker amplified 167 bp of the fragment by PCR, and digestion with Taq I restriction enzyme generated 50 and 117 bp fragments in the double flower allele (Fig. 5). The J01 marker showed a high degree of agreement with the flower phenotype at 99.0% in the 15IJP1 and 100% in the 14GT77 populations that segregated the double flower phenotype of ‘Jogasaki’ (Supplementary Tables S4 and S5). This indicated that the J01 marker was tightly linked to the djo locus, and J01 could effectively distinguish the recessive allele from the dominant allele.Fragment pattern of J01 DNA marker. Dominant single flower allele is shown as an undigested 167 bp fragment. Recessive double flower allele is shown as digested 117 and 50 bp fragments.

To develop a DNA marker for distinguishing the dsu recessive allele from the dominant alleles in the LFY genomic sequence, we focused and designed a DNA marker on the ‘Kirakiraboshi’ specific 14 bp deletion at position 3,617 from the initiation codon (Fig. 3A). We developed an S01 marker amplified 236 bp fragment for the double flower allele of ‘Kirakiraboshi,’ and 250 bp and 280 bp fragments for the single flower allele of ‘Frau Yoshimi’ (Fig. 6A). Three types of alleles resulted from the presence or absence of a 30 bp deletion at position 3,513 in addition to the 14 bp deletion. These were 30 bp and 14 bp deletions on the 236 bp allele, 30 bp deletion on the 250 bp allele, and no deletion on the 280 bp allele (Fig. 6B).Fragment pattern of S01 DNA marker and INDEL polymorphism of amplified sequences.

DNA marker application for hydrangea accessionsSince the J01 marker could distinguish djo alleles and the S01 marker could distinguish dsu alleles, the combined use of J01 and S01 DNA markers was expected to reveal the origin of the double flower phenotype, djo or dsu, in various accessions. Therefore, we performed DNA marker genotyping on H. macrophylla accessions using two DNA markers, J01 and S01. All tested double flower accessions showed homozygous genotypes of J01 or S01; 10 of the double flower accessions were homozygous of 117_50 in J01, and 4 were homozygous of 236 in S01 (Table 3). Contrarily, all single flower accessions showed other genotypes. Therefore, developed DNA markers J01 and S01 could successfully identify recessive double flower alleles for djo and dsu, respectively. Both markers showed a high degree of agreement with phenotype and were applicable to the examined H. macrophylla accessions. These DNA markers could be useful in marker-assisted selection (MAS) of double flower progenies. Identification of flower phenotype at the seedling stage by MAS would enable the discarding of single flower individuals and allow the growth of double flower individuals.

Furthermore, PacBio resequencing of 10 accessions was performed, and a total of 2,033 structure variants were identified. Genetic diversity and structure analysis congregated the 198 accessions into three subgroups (Primitive, World, and Japan) and showed the possibility of a long and relatively isolated history of cultivated soybean in Japan. Additionally, the skewed regional distribution of variants in the genome, such as higher structural variations on the R gene clusters in the Japan group, suggested the possibility of selective sweeps during domestication or breeding. A genome-wide association study identified both known and novel causal variants on the genes controlling the flowering period. Novel candidate causal variants were also found on genes related to the seed coat colour by aligning together with Illumina and PacBio reads. The genomic sequences and variants obtained in this study have immense potential to provide information for soybean breeding and genetic studies that may uncover novel alleles or genes involved in agronomically important traits.1. IntroductionThere are more than 1,750 gene banks existing in the world that store genetic resources comprised of 7.4 million accessions.1 However, <1% of these accessions have been used in breeding.2 Underutilization of genetic resources is partly due to the accessions being characterized insufficiently. Recent advances in DNA genotyping and sequencing technologies have enabled molecular descriptions for these accessions with genome-wide markers and whole-genome sequences. In rice, whole-genome sequence data of more than 3,000 accession genetic resources were collected and analysed.3–5 In soybeans, which is the species being investigated in the present study, 42,509 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were determined from 20,087 accessions of genetic resources.6 Genomic information on genetic resources will enhance the utilization of genetic resources in plant breeding. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) facilitates the identification of genes/alleles, which can be utilized in plant breeding, from genetic variations within a germplasm collection.7 Genomic selection is a method of predicting the genetic ability of individuals and selecting individuals based on the prediction,8 which allows useful accessions to be identified from a germplasm collection.9–11Whole-genome sequences collected from genetic resources provide useful information for plant breeding that can provide important clues and insights into the evolution and domestication process of crop species, subspecies, and cultivars.4 Whole-genome sequences also provide information that can determine genes and alleles that played important roles in local adaptation and artificial selection in the history of plant breeding.12 In addition, whole-genome sequences are expected to improve the power and precision of GWAS because they preserve rare variants and variants that are not in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with a reduced set of SNPs, such as SNPs genotyped with a genotyping array or a reduced-representation sequencing approach. Genome structure variants, including copy number variations (CNVs), are also identified by whole-genome sequences.13 CNVs are known to have contributed to domestication and natural or artificial selection in the history of plant breeding and has been linked to important agronomic traits.13,14 Moreover, whole-genome sequences of genetic resources can also be useful as a reference panel to impute whole-genome polymorphisms in large experimental/breeding populations genotyped with a reduced set of SNPs to suppress the time and cost of genotyping.15–17 From the above-mentioned various viewpoints, studies on whole-genome sequences of genetic resources have been performed in various crop species (e.g. rice,3–5 maize,18 sorghum,19 tomato,20 and soybean12).Globally, soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] is the most important legume and is also the fourth in worldwide production after rice, wheat, and maize in terms of global crop production. The soybean is an important source of protein, an oil crop, and is used for both food and animal feed. Recently, numerous functional constituents to human health found in soybean seeds have attracted attention,21 and it may also be used as a biofuel crop.22 In addition, the crop can also provide nutrients to the soil through nitrogen fixation. Because of these characteristics, the importance of soybean as a crop has been increasing in recent years. Hence, a wide variety of genetic variants has been collected as genetic resource collections for soybeans, including its wild species, G. soja (Sieb. & Zucc.) as genetic resources for breeding.After the genome sequence of soybean became available,23 the whole-genome sequences from soybean genetic resources were collected and used for studies in domestication and varietal improvement of soybean.12,24–29 A relatively high rate (55,24 45,25 60,26 21,12 and 7%27) of wild soybean (G. soja) accessions were included in the materials in the previous whole-genome sequencing studies in soybean, and the number of G. max accessions was <100, except for Zhou et al.12 In the Zhou et al.12 study, they resequenced 302 accessions, including 170 accessions (86 landraces and 84 improved cultivars) of G. max, and analysed genomic variation dynamics during the domestication and varietal improvement of soybean. The number of accessions used in the study was much larger than that in earlier studies, and this may have contributed to the successful detection of traces of selection and variants associated with domestication and improvement traits. Although the genetic resource with the whole-genome sequences employed in Zhou et al.12 is useful for future soybean breeding, we consider that the increase in the number of accessions with whole-genome sequences contribute to improving the statistical power for detecting traces of selection and the power of GWAS.30Soybean is assumed to have been domesticated in China around the eleventh century BC and then disseminated to surrounding countries around the first century A.D.31 Accordingly, the genetic and morphological characteristics of Japanese soybean are distinct from those grown across the Asian continent.32,33 In Japan, various soybeans have been used to prepare traditional foods such as tofu, fermented beans, miso, boiled beans, soy sauce, and vegetable beans. Because the seed size of Japanese soybeans is one of the important characteristics of these foods, range of the variation is approximately 2-fold greater than the rest of the world’s soybeans.33 In addition, colour traits, especially the seed coat and hilum colour, are important features for food processing such as the yellow seed coat with a pale hilum colour for tofu production, black or green seed colour for boiled beans, and the non-yellow colouring or stay-green characteristic of the pod for vegetable beans. The genetics of these colouration traits and their respective genes have been well characterized. As for the green-colour related traits, homozygosity of two recessive alleles at classical loci, D1 and D2, or a cytoplasmic gene, cytG, are known to cause the stay-green phenotype of the pod and seed coat at maturity.34 The recessive d1 and d2 alleles have a mutation that causes the loss of function in the Stay-Green (SGR) proteins,35 while cytG has an insertion that causes a frameshift in the chloroplast psbM gene.36 The G allele at the G locus produces green-coloured seeds using different mechanisms from these loci,37 and is dominant over the yellow seed. The G allele encodes a CAAX amino-terminal protease protein, while the g allele has a mutation that causes the loss of the last transmembrane domain.38Epistasis among classical colour loci, such as I, R, T, and W1 have been reported to occur because the compounds responsible for the colouration of the seed coat, hilum, pubescence, and flower in soybean are mostly related to the biosynthetic pathway of anthocyanins.39 The dominant I allele inhibits seed coat pigmentation and causes a uniformly yellow seed coat and hilum, whereas the i allele allows pigmentation. The other ii and ik restrict pigmentation to the hilum and to the saddle-shaped region around hilum, respectively. The mechanisms for I and ii alleles have been characterized as RNA silencing of chalcone synthase (CHS) genes in the biosynthetic pathway of anthocyanins.40,41 With the combination of i allele, the R and r alleles at the R locus result in a black and brown hilum/seed coat, respectively. The R gene encodes the R2R3 MYB transcription factor, which might control the expression of UDP-glucose: flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase (UF3GT) in the final step of anthocyanin biosynthesis, and the r allele is caused by four types of loss-of-function mutations.42 The T and W1 loci are known to control pubescence and flower colour, respectively, in addition to epistatic interactions for the pigmentation of seed colour traits. The dominant T allele produces tawny pubescence, whereas the recessive t allele with a single-base deletion causes a loss of function in flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase and produces grey pubescence.43 The dominant W1 allele produces a purple flower and hypocotyl phenotype, while the recessive w1 allele with a single-base deletion causes a loss of function in flavonoid 3',5'-hydroxylase and produces a white flower and green hypocotyl phenotype.44Understanding the genetic control of flowering time and maturity is indispensable to efficiently develop a new variety with a photoperiodic adaptation to different latitudes. For that reason, the genes responsible for E1,45,E2,46,E3,47,E4,48,E9,49 and J50 were isolated among the 10 major classical loci (E1–E9 and J). In addition, genes for other loci such as qDTF-J,51,E1-like-b,52 and GmPRR353 were isolated. The next important task would be to accumulate allelic information from the breeding materials since different allelic combinations of these loci determine adaptations to a different latitude. However, functional redundancy between duplicated gene copies in the soybean genome makes it difficult to understand the relationship between genetic variation and agronomically important traits. Therefore, a resequencing effort for many accessions will provide a chance to comprehensively identify new alleles and genes that potentially affect agronomically important traits apart from flowering time and maturity.In this study, we collected and analysed the whole-genome sequences of 198 soybean accessions. The accessions were mainly from two soybean mini-core collections from the National Agricultural and Food Research Organization (NARO) Genebank. The accessions in the mini-core collections were carefully selected from 1,603 accessions,33 based on the polymorphisms of 191 SNP markers and several agronomic traits, to ensure that the collections retained as many genetic variations as possible in all accessions. In this study, we characterized the polymorphisms found in the whole-genome sequences and investigated the subpopulation structure and levels of genetic differentiation in the accessions based on their polymorphisms. In addition, using the number of days to flowering (DTF) as an example trait, we evaluated the potential of GWAS using whole-genome sequences. Among the 198 accessions, we also employed 10 for long-read sequencing to analyse large structural variants. Copy number variants were also identified using Illumina reads to investigate the genome structure variance. The variations in colour related to the seed coat, hilum, pubescence, and flower were characterized as polymorphisms in the whole-genome sequences, and their relations with known genes were investigated. Through these analyses, we evaluated the potential significance of whole-genome sequences being prepared for soybean genetic resources. The whole-genome sequences collected for the genetic resources will facilitate the active use of genetic resources in soybean breeding programs.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materialsIn this study, we utilized 198 soybean accessions for whole-genome sequencing (Supplementary Table S1): 192 accessions from Japanese and world soybean mini-core collections,33 an Indian cultivar ‘L323’ (JP241838), and a Japanese cultivar ‘Misuzudaizu’ (JP28856) obtained from NARO Genebank (https://www.gene.affrc.go.jp/index_en.php, 15 January 2021, date last accessed); Japanese landrace ‘Houjaku Kuwazu’ (PI416937) and a United States (US) cultivar ‘5002T’ (PI634193) obtained from the USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) germplasm collection through GRIN (Germplasm Resources Information Network). A soybean cultivar ‘Norin2’ and a Glycine soja accession (B01167) were obtained from the National BioResource Project (https://www.legumebase.brc.miyazaki-u.ac.jp, 15 January 2021, date last accessed).Two plants were grown with an inter-row spacing of 80 cm and a hill spacing of 20 cm in the field at NARO in Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan (36°01'25.6"" N 140°06'59.1""E). Seeds were sown on June 1, 2010, and the DTF of 184 successfully germinated accessions were recorded for association analysis. Of the 198 accessions, 14 were excluded from the evaluation of DTF because six and eight accessions had not planted in the field and germinated late due to overseed, respectively. The colour of hypocotyl, flower, pubescence, leaf at maturity, and seeds of these plants were recorded while comparing that of the soybean reference cultivar Williams 82 (accession no. GmWMC115 in the present study) with yellow seed with black hilum, tawny pubescence, and white flowers (ii, T, R, w1).542.2. Illumina whole-genome sequencingFreeze-dried young leaves collected from a plant in each accession were ground using a mortar and pestle. Total DNA was extracted from the finely ground leaf tissue using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The DNA was physically sheared into ~350 bp fragments using Covaris S2 (Covaris, Brighton, UK). The fragmented DNA was used for DNA library construction with the TrueSeq DNA PCR-Free Library Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA). The DNA libraries were sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq X Ten or HiSeq 4000 (Illumina).2.3. PacBio whole-genome sequencingPacBio whole-genome sequencing was performed for 10 accessions: ‘Misuzudaizu’ (JP28856), ‘Enrei’ (GmJMC025), ‘Houjaku Kuwazu’ (PI416937), ‘Fukuyutaka’ (GmJMC112), ‘Moshidou Gong 503’ (GmWMC084), ‘Peking’ (GmWMC084), ‘PK 73-54’ (GmWMC071), ‘L323’ (JP241838), ‘5002T’ (PI634193), and ‘Williams 82’ (GmWMC115; Supplementary Table S1). For PacBio sequencing, the total DNA was extracted from finely ground leaf tissue using an SDS-based DNA extraction method55 and was used for SMRTbell libraries (Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA). Sequences were generated using PacBio Sequel (Pacific Biosciences).2.4. Reference genome sequences and annotation data used in this studyGmax_275_v2.0 softmasked sequences and the genome annotation of Williams 82, which was a completely sequenced soybean accession,23 were used as the reference for the analyses of this study. The reference data were obtained from Phytozome 12.1,56 and the gene annotations and IDs described in this article were also based on the descriptions in Phytozome.2.5. Variant call and diversity analysis using Illumina readsThe Illumina reads were trimmed with Trimmomatic version 0.3657 with the following parameters: ‘ILLUMINACLIP: TruSeq3-PE-2.fa: 2:30:10 LEADING: 3 TRAILING: 3 SLIDINGWINDOW: 4:15 MINLEN: 36’. The trimmed reads were mapped on the reference sequence using the BWA-aln (release 0.7.17) algorithm with default options.58 The mapped reads were then sorted using SAMtools release 1.7,59 and duplicates were removed using Picard tools (release 2.18.3; http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/, 15 January 2021, date last accessed).The variants for each accession were called using the GATK HaplotypeCaller (release 4.0.4.0) with the ‘.g.vcf’ extension.60 GATK GenomicsDBImport and GenotypeGVCFs were used for joint genotyping to produce a single VCF per sample of GVCF. Then, variants underwent quality assessment using the GATK best practices pipeline (https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/best-practices/, 15 January 2021, date last accessed) to obtain a raw VCF that passed through the variant filtration step. The initial step for the variant dataset contained 10,116,707 SNPs and 2,835,680 indels. Detailed methods for the preparation of the variant data are described in Supplementary Methods and Fig. S1.2.6. Genetic and genomic diversity analysesThe genetic structure of the population was estimated using phylogenetic analysis, principal component analysis (PCA), and ADMIXTURE61 analysis based on whole-genome sequences. For the phylogenetic analysis, we constructed a neighbour-joining (NJ) tree based on the whole-genome genetic distances among accessions, calculated with the Jukes and Cantor model62 using the ape package63 in R.64 In constructing the NJ tree, the accession ‘B01167’, which is the only accession of G. soja, was treated as an outgroup. For PCA, we calculated whole-genome Euclidean distances among the accessions based on their genotypes and performed multi-dimensional scaling based on the distances using the ‘cmdscale’ function in R. We performed ADMIXTURE analysis61 with the models of one to eight subpopulations to estimate the ancestries of the accessions. A 5-fold cross-validation was performed for each number of the subpopulations to select the appropriate K value.We calculated nucleotide diversity (p), pairwise and total FST, and r2 to measure the LD for the entire genome with non-overlapping 500 kb windows, and to evaluate genome-wide pattern levels of polymorphisms, genetic differentiation, and LD. For this calculation, we used an in-house developed R program. To identify CNVs among the 198 soybean accessions, CNV-Seq with the last updated version in 201465 was performed based on the Illumina reads with the option of 100 kb window-size. The Illumina Williams 82 reads were used as reference reads.2.7. GWAS of flowering date and seed weightWe performed GWAS for the flowering date to demonstrate the viability of the identified variants. The numbers of days from sowing to first flowering of 184 accessions were used for the association analysis. SNPs with minor allele frequencies (2.5%) or whose missing rate was more than 5% were filtered out for the GWAS study. Imputation was conducted using Beagle 5.0 with default parameter settings.9 GWAS was performed using a linear mixed model60 implemented by the ‘association.test’ function in gaston package ver. 1.5.560 in R. In the linear mixed model, the first two principal components of marker scores were included as fixed effects. A genetic relationship matrix specifying a random additive effect was computed using the ‘GRM’ function of the gaston package. The P values of the marker-trait associations were calculated using the Wald test. The genome-wide significant threshold was obtained based on a false discovery rate (FDR66) at a 1% level. Manhattan plot of GWAS was created using qqman67 and CMplot package (https://github.com/YinLiLin/R-CMplot, 15 January 2021, date last accessed) in R.2.8. Structural variation analysisStructural variation (SV) detection was performed using PacBio reads from the 10 soybean accessions. The PacBio reads of each accession were mapped onto the reference genome sequence using NGMLR68 version 0.2.6. SV detection from mapped results was performed using SAMtools version 1.3.159 and Sniffles version 1.0.8.68 Genome-wide distribution of SVs (insertions, deletions, and duplications) was filtered by length, where the value of SVLEN in VCF file =1 kb and =50 kb, and grouped into three categories: Japan, Primitive, and World, which were performed using in-house Perl scripts. The integrated genome maps were then illustrated by CIRCOS 69-3.692.9. Identifying the variation in PacBio and Illumina reads related to the I locusThe presence and absence of variation (PAV) related to the I locus were analysed based on the mapping results of PacBio and Illumina reads onto the reference genome. In addition, the genomic positions of the CHS genes of BAC77G7-a and BAC56G2 (GenBank accession numbers: EF623854 and EF623856); which were reported as BAC clones that covered the I locus of Williams 82,70 were compared with Gmax_275_v2.0 using MUMmer3.71 PAV of Gm-c1069-601741 and GmICHS40 of the I locus and GmD2IN35 of the D1 locus were manually identified by comparing the alignments using IGVtools 2.4.1172 and CLC Genomics Workbench 12 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).3. Results and discussion3.1. Whole-genome sequencing of the soybean accessionsA total of 25 billion paired-end Illumina reads were obtained for the 197 G. max and one G. soja accessions (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). The mean depth of the reads against the soybean genome ranged from ×6.8 to ×32.9 with an average of ×16.3. The mapping ratio onto the ‘Williams 82’ reference was 94.7% on average, and the mean covered ratio on the reference genome was 93.6%. A total of 12,952,387 variants, including 10,116,707 SNPs and 2,835,680 insertions/deletions (indels), were identified as the results of the variant call and filtering (Table 1). The information for variants among accessions can be compared using the multiple genome Browser TASUKE73 from https://daizutasuke275-core.daizu.dna.affrc.go.jp/ (15 January 2021, date last accessed).Number of variants identified on the 198 soybean accessionsNumber of variants identified on the 198 soybean accessions3.2. Genetic diversity and population structure analysesAn NJ tree based on whole-genome SNPs was built to investigate the phylogenetic relationships among the 198 accessions (Fig. 1A). The NJ tree indicated that the 198 accessions were clustered into three subgroups, two of which were not monophyletic. Based on the origins of accessions consistent with each subgroup, we named the subgroups as ‘Primitive’, ‘World’, and ‘Japan’. The ‘Primitive’ subgroup was comprised of the G. soja accession (B01167), ‘Peking’ (GmWMC084), ‘Moshidou Gong 503’ (GmWMC042), and 17 other accessions (Supplementary Table S1). The World subgroup consisted of ‘Williams 82’ (GmWMC115), ‘5002T’, ‘PK 73-54’ (GmWMC071), and 55 other accessions. The ‘Japan’ subgroup consisted of a monophyletic cluster of 120 accessions, which were mainly Japanese and Korean landraces/cultivars.The phylogenetic relationships and Population structure of 198 soybean accessions.

(B) Population genetic structure estimated by Admixture analysis. Results from k = 2 to 5 are shown. Green triangles indicate the non-Japanese accessions in the ‘Japan’ subgroup.PCA showed a similar diversity pattern to the NJ tree (Supplementary Fig. S2A). In PC1, which accounted for 9.0% of the total variations, the accessions were divided into three subgroups in the order of ‘Primitive’, ‘World’, and ‘Japan’. PC2, which accounted for 3.4% of the total variations, mainly captured the genetic differentiation between ‘Primitive’ and ‘World’, compared to ‘Japan’, which presented intermediate scores between the two subgroups. In both PC1 and PC2, the distribution of the three subgroups was not completely discrete, indicating that the genetic differentiation between these subgroups is continuous and was likely due to the migration between subgroups. Landraces and breeding lines were the two types of accessions in the ‘World’ and ‘Japan’ subgroups. However, there were no clear differences between the distribution patterns of breeding lines and landraces in both ‘World’ and ‘Japan’ subgroups. In PC3 and PC4, no clear patterns were observed among the subgroups (Supplementary Fig. S2B), suggesting that the PC1 and PC2 scores are useful indicators for determining which accession belongs to each subpopulation.The admixture analysis also showed a similar diversity pattern with the NJ tree and PCA (Fig. 1B). Each of the three subgroups showed a similar genetic background among accessions when K = 3. Some accessions (e.g. six accessions of ‘Primitive’ which are in the grey box in Fig. 1A) had intermediate genetic backgrounds between subgroups (e.g. the six accessions had intermediate backgrounds between ‘Primitive’ and ‘World’). Moreover, the cross-validation error was the smallest when K = 5 (Supplementary Fig. S3), suggesting that a significant subpopulation structure may exist even within each of the three subgroups. Thus, the 198 accessions did not fall into three distinct subpopulations and had a stratified and complex structure among them. Nevertheless, the two boundaries between the three subgroups (white dashed lines in Fig. 1B) were visually identifiable, and thus the classification into the three subgroups was considered reasonable, even based on the result of Admixture analysis.The 12,953,387 variants were classified based on their shared degree, and approximately one-third (4,486,367 variants) were commonly observed among the three groups. These variants were regarded as the ancient variants rather than ‘private’ variants, which identified single groups only. The private variants per subgroup were defined as variants that had been observed only in a specific group. The number of private variants per subgroup was higher in ‘Japan’ (2,299,690) than in ‘World’ (1,119,074) or ‘Primitive’ (2,145,920; Supplementary Fig. S4). These private variants were considered as candidate causal variants that ascribe group-specific phenotypes. The allele frequencies of variants in each group (subpopulations and shared categories) were calculated to elucidate genetic diversity. The average, median, and mode of allele frequencies were higher in ‘Primitive’ than in ‘World’ or ‘Japan’ (Supplementary Table S3).The functional impact of the 12,953,387 variants (10,117,707 SNPs + 2,835,680 indels) was estimated using SnpEff (Supplementary Table S3 and Fig. S5A) to investigate and exploit genotypic and phenotypic variations. Out of all variants, 29,655,355 (97.45%) were classified into ‘Modifier’ (intergenic variants), while 9,757 (0.24%) were classified into ‘High’ (frameshift variant, stop lost/gained), 358,102 (1.26%) into ‘Moderate’ (coding sequence variant), and 319,839 (1.05%) into ‘Low’ (synonymous variant). The number of private variants classified as ‘High’ was more than twice (20,283) in ‘Japan’ than those in ‘Primitive’ (9,540) and ‘World’ (8,993) (Supplemental Table S3). For the functional classification of SnpEff, 613,799 variants were classified as ‘Nonsense’ (9,757; 1.6%), ‘Missense’ (358,102; 58%), and ‘Silent’ (245,940; 40%) as shown in Supplementary Table S3 and Fig. S5B. The ‘Japan’ subgroup had the largest number of private variants classified into ‘Nonsense’ and ‘Missense’ among the three subgroups (Supplementary Fig. S5B). These variants may implicate phenotypic variations among populations.We evaluated the genome-wide diversity in the whole-genome sequences by calculating the nucleotide diversity (<U+2060>p<U+2060>), genetic differentiation (pairwise and total FST<U+2060>), and linkage disequilibrium (<U+2060>r2<U+2060>) in 500 kb non-overlapping windows for each of the three subgroups and all subgroups together. As a result, the nucleotide diversity was highest in ‘Primitive’ and lowest in ‘Japan’ in most genomic regions (Supplementary Fig. S6A). The private variants, defined as variants that had been observed only in a specific accession, were counted in each accession. The average number of private variants per accession was higher in ‘Primitive’ (62,329) than in ‘World’ (7,091) or ‘Japan’ (6,584). The ‘Japan’ subgroup had the largest number of accessions (120 of 198), so it is reasonable for it to have a larger number of private variants per subgroup. The genetic differentiation between subpopulations was generally largest in the comparison between ‘Primitive’ and ‘Japan’ and lowest in the comparison between ‘World’ and ‘Japan’ in most of the genomic regions (Supplementary Fig. S6B). Some genomic regions, however, showed different patterns from the general pattern; for example, the differentiation in the terminals of the long arms of chromosomes 3 and 5 was the lowest between ‘Primitive’ and ‘World’, while it was high between ‘Primitive’ and ‘Japan’ and ‘World’ and ‘Japan’. The LD was the highest in ‘Primitive’ and the lowest in ‘Japan’ (Supplementary Fig. S6C), and studies have reported that small populations have higher LD value than large populations.74 As in the case of genetic differentiation, some genomic regions showed different patterns from the general pattern in LD. For example, we only observed the peak of the LD in the middle (~25 Mb) of the chromosome 6 in ‘Japan’, while the peak of the LD in the middle (~10 Mb) of the chromosome 7 was in ‘World’.3.3. GWAS for flowering dateA genome-wide association test was performed on DTF with 4,776,813 genome-wide SNPs (Fig. 2) to demonstrate the strength of whole-genome GWAS with mini-core collections. With a 1% threshold of FDR, three significant associations were detected at the 5,520,945 and 5,542,737 bp positions on chromosome 12, and at the 45,310,798 bp position on chromosome 10. The variants of e2, e3-tr, and the stop-loss variant (rs125308117) of two-component response regulator-like gene on Chr12 were significant in a gene-based association test for flowering time in the mini-core collection. Ogiso-Tanaka et al.75 estimated a large deletion on E3 by the coverage of four amplicons on the 4th exon. In this study, e3-tr could not be incorporated into the association analysis due to the difficulty of detecting a 15 kb deletion in E3 using whole-genome sequences.Manhattan plots of GWAS for flowering time in 2010.

(A) Whole-genome, (B) chromosome 10, and (C) chromosome 12.The significant association detected in the SNP at 45,310,798 bp on chromosome 10 was in the Glyma.10G221500 coding region, which encodes the classical E2 gene, that is, a soybean GIGANTEA gene.44 The alleles of the SNP were ref (same as the reference sequence, ‘Williams 82’) ‘A’ and alt ’T’ alleles, which corresponded to Lys (AAA) and a premature stop codon (TAA) at the 528 amino acid sequence position, respectively (Fig. 3A). The proportion of the alleles was different among the subgroups, especially when comparing ‘Primitive’ to ‘World’ and ‘Japan’ (Fig. 3B). Based on the relationships between DTF phenotypes and SNP alleles, the reference (ref: A) and alternative (alt: T) alleles were associated with late and early flowering phenotypes, respectively (Fig. 3C). Previously, three alleles, E2-in (Williams 82), E2-dl, and e2-ns, have been identified from 63 accessions covering several ecological types by sequencing of the genomic region of the E2 locus.76 Wang et al.77 identified 47 haplotypes of GIGANTEA from 233 Chinese soybean and 104 wild soybean accessions. Among them, three amino acid sequence haplotypes, H1 (e2-ns), H2 (E2-dl), and H3 (E2-in), have been reported to be in the cultivated soybean gene pool. Interestingly, five novel variants with amino acid changes were obtained in the present study (Supplementary Table S4). It is necessary to confirm whether these novel variants, especially the novel nonsense variant of Gln53stop in GmJMC041 and GmJMC044 that has no Lys528stop mutation, affect the flowering time or maturity and can be called a new allele.Sequence variants on the GIGANTEA gene (Glyma.10G221500), the allele frequency of a targeted SNP, and distribution of flowering date.

The vertical line indicates the days to flowering (DTF).The SNP at 5,520,945 bp on chromosome 12 showed a significant association in the coding region of Glyma.12G073900, which encodes the clock-associated pseudo-response regulator 3 (GmPRR3b).53 This SNP, which is located at the first nucleotide of the termination codon ‘TAA’, changes the codon to ‘CAA’ of Gln on the alt allele. This caused a shift of the stop codon at the position of 627 aa in the ref allele (5,520,945 bp) to 795 aa in the alt allele (5,521,025 bp, Supplementary Fig. S7A). The proportion of the alleles was significantly different in ‘Primitive’ compared to ‘Japan’ and ‘World’ (Supplementary Fig. S7B). Accessions with the ref allele tended to flower early, while accessions with the alt allele tended to flower late (Supplementary Fig. S7C).There are two landraces in the ‘Japan’ subgroup, ‘Kurodaizu’ and ‘Hiku Anda’ (GmJMC030 and GmJMC049), which originated from Okinawa prefecture located in the south most part of Japan. It was reported that these landraces belonged to a cluster that consisted of old cultivars known as the precocious summer-type soybean.33 We confirmed that the two landraces had early flowering alleles in the E2 gene and GmPRR3b, supporting that the two landraces belonged in the early flowering group in the previous study.33 The ‘Japan’ subgroup also includes three landraces and three breeding lines, ‘Waseousode’ (GmJMC005), ‘Tokachi Nagaha’ (GmJMC007), ‘Shizunai Daizu’ (GmJMC009), ‘Ooyachi 2’ (GmJMC021), ‘Bansei Hikarikuro’ (GmJMC033), and ‘Yakumo Meaka’ (GmJMC037), that originated from Hokkaido which is the northernmost prefecture of Japan. These six accessions had early flowering alleles in both genes, suggesting an adaptation to specific environmental conditions in the northern part of Japan.31Li et al.78 reported six variants of GmPRR3b that caused amino acid changes and eight haplotypes from 383 accessions, including wild soybean accessions. We were able to identify four novel variants causing amino acid changes in the current study (Supplementary Table S4). Among the eight haplotypes determined by Li et al.,78 H1 and H6 encoded truncated peptides. The H6 haplotype is the most frequent haplotype in cultivated soybeans, including the reference ‘Williams 82,’ and was frequently observed as a ref allele in our study, while H1 was found only in wild soybeans. The next would be the H4 and H5 haplotypes, which encode longer amino acid sequences, that were reported to flower later than H1 and H6. Similarly, H4 and H5 haplotypes were second and third most frequent haplotypes (33 and 19 accessions, respectively) in our study. The H7 and H8 haplotypes, which encode the same length of amino acid sequence with a Ser100Leu mutation in the pseudo receiver domain, have been reported to flower earlier than H4 and H5.74 The novel mutation of Asp98Asn, which was only found in haplotype H5, was located in the same pseudo receiver domain. Together with the other novel frameshift variant of Gly556fs in GmWMC087, which causes a shorter truncated protein than the H6 haplotype, further studies are necessary to understand the allelic effect of the novel variants on flowering time and maturity.3.4. SVs between nine soybean accessionsPacBio reads were obtained for 10 accessions originating from Japan, China, India, and the USA (Fig. 1, Supplementary Table S1). The total length of the subreads ranged from 10.3 to 17.7 Gb, representing 10.5 to 18.1 × of the soybean genome. The average subread lengths ranged from 6,777 to 8,019 bp. SVs for the 10 soybean accessions with PacBio reads were identified and compared (Table 2). ‘Williams 82’, the accession of the reference genome, was identified to have a total of 2,033 SVs. The number represents the degree of errors (false positive or miss-assembly of the reference genome). Overall, the number of SVs with complex structures such as duplications was less than insertions and deletions. A large number (a total of 16,363) of insertion and deletion polymorphisms existed in two accessions in the ‘Primitive’ subgroup. The polymorphisms of these two accessions were newly detected by long-read resequencing, which was at a moderate genetic distance from the reference genome and will further contribute to novel genetic analysis. This result agrees with the result of the PCA analysis (Supplementary Fig. S2), which was based on single-nucleotide variants.The numbers of the SVs detected from 10 soybean accessions with PacBio readsThe numbers of the SVs detected from 10 soybean accessions with PacBio readsGenome-wide distributions of SVs among the three groups are shown with p values in Supplementary Fig. S8. It has been reported that the distributions of SVs and SNPs tend to be positively correlated by LD analysis.5,79,80 However, several exceptions, such as on 10–20 Mb on Chr03 and 10–30 Mb on Chr19 in the ‘Japan’ subgroup, were observed. The fewer p values and higher SVs in these regions tend to be negatively correlated, suggesting that it is difficult to detect an associations between the phenotype and DNA polymorphisms using SNP-based analysis even if there is phenotypic diversification due to SVs in the regions.81 Furthermore, we focused on regions where genes related to domestication or breeding are located. For example, the regions at 37–41.5 Mb on Chr14 and 10–20 Mb on Chr20 showed lower polymorphisms in ‘World’ and ‘Japan’ than ‘Primitive’. According to Zhou et al.,12 these regions were considered as putative selective sweep regions of seed oil contents (Chr14: 37,550,001.41,300,000, Chr20: 10,270,001.18,460,000) caused by the breeding or domestication process.12 The lower polymorphic regions were also observed in ‘World’ and ‘Japan’ than ‘Primitive’ at 10–20 Mb on Chr05, 20–30 Mb on Chr10, and 10–20 Mb on Chr12; suggesting the possibility of selective sweeps during domestication or the breeding process. Furthermore, we focused on somewhat higher polymorphic regions, which are remarkable to the ‘Japan’ subgroup. The region at 4.5 Mb on Chr03, reported as the Rps1 region, includes the coiled-coil nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat (CC-NBS–LRR)-type gene clusters for Phytophthora resistance.82 The 30 Mb region in Chr13, reported as the Rsv1 region, includes the NBS-LRR resistance gene cluster for the soybean mosaic virus.83 Furthermore, the 47 Mb region in Chr14, the Rsv3 gene region, includes the CC-NBS–LRR gene cluster for the soybean mosaic virus.84 It is consistent that these three regions include R gene clusters and higher amounts of SVs, and it is thought that genes in such SV rich regions may generate unique alleles in the soybean accessions of the ‘Japan’ subgroup.3.5. Identification of known variations related to the I locus and loci related to colour traitsWe further examined the relationship between SVs and seed coat colour phenotypes by comparing known variants related to the chalcone synthase (CHS) gene cluster of the I locus on Chr08. It has been reported that duplications or deletions of CHS genes influence seed coat pigmentation in Rosids.48,50,85,86 In soybean, a chimeric sequence consisting of subtilisin and CHS1 anti-sense of duplicated CHS clusters (Gm-c1069-6017), has been suggested to cause CHS gene silencing and change the yellow seed coat with pigmented hilum, the ‘so-called’ dominant ii alleles.41 Another chimeric sequence (GmIRCHS) consisting of DnaJ and inverted CHS3 genes, causes PTGS of CHS genes and changes the yellow seed coat with yellow hilum, the ‘so-called’ dominant I allele.40 The genomic region of the ii allele is covered by two ‘Williams 82’ BAC clones, which are BAC77G7-a and BAC56G270, and their sequences are located in Chr08 of Gmax_275_v2.0 and are approximately 18 kb apart from each other; from the position of 8,410,306, where the 3' end of BAC56G2 matched to the position of 8,428,210 where the 3' end of BAC77G7-a complementary matched (Supplementary Fig. S9). Although the gene annotations on BAC56G2 were well conserved on Gmax_275_v2.0, the most important genomic region, including Gm-c1069-6017 and CHS clusters A and B related to seed coat pigmentation on BAC77G7-a were not correctly assembled and thus were not identified on Gmax_275_v2.0. Similarly, the genomic region with the GmIRCHS sequence for the dominant I allele was not identified because of ‘Williams 82’ (the donor of Gmax_275_v2.0) having a different ii allele. Interestingly, we identified chimeric sequences derived from Gm-c1069-6017 and GmIRCHS in the partially aligned PacBio reads on another copy of subtilisin (Glyma.08G109000) and DnaJ (Glyma.08G109700), respectively (Supplementary Fig. S9). Furthermore, the short chimeric sequences in the partially aligned Illumina reads near the SV breakpoints were manually recorded as presence and absence variation in all accessions (Supplementary Table S5). The seed coat colour of 53 accessions without both chimeric sequences in the mini-core collections revealed brown, reddish-brown, and black, while the remaining yellow and green seed coat colour accessions had either of the chimeric sequences. Among accessions with yellow and green seed coat colours, no pigmentation was observed on the hilum of 22 accessions with chimeric GmIRCHS sequences, while 122 accessions with chimeric partial Gm-c1069-6017 sequence revealed pigmentation on the hilum. Thus, the PAVs related to the I locus in the partially aligned reads successfully explained the variation in seed coat colour and pigmentation on the hilum of 197 accessions.Among the classical loci that governed the seed coat colour of soybean, we identified new functional alleles at the R and K1 loci based on the read mapping data. Three known non-functional alleles, Gly63fs, Arg75fs, and splice site change (AGgt>AGtt) at the R2R3 MYB gene Glyma.09G235100, which is classically called R locus,42 distinguished 12 brown seed coat colour accessions from 35 black seed coat colours and two reddish-brown accessions (Supplementary Table S5). Two brown seed colour accessions, GmWMC138 and GmWMC159, were found to have two new non-functional alleles, Glu67del and Asn213fs, respectively. The novel missense variant Trp32Ser was identified as GmWMC019 and GmWMC042. There was no causal variation between black seed accession (GmJMC055) and reddish-brown seed accession (GmJMC099). The reddish-brown colour, however, is somewhat different from the typical brown colour and may be controlled by other genes.Twenty-six green seed coat colour accessions could be further distinguished from 117 yellow seed coat colour accessions using a known functional stop-loss variant at the CAAX amino-terminal protease gene Glyma.01G198500, which is classically called the G locus.38 There was no causal variation at Glyma.01G198500 to explain the green seed colour of the GmWMC011 accession. Saddle-shaped black pigmentation on the seed coat of GmJMC003 and GmJMC102 could be explained by non-functional Val351fs allele of the Argonaute5 gene Glyma.11G190900, which is classically called the K1 locus.87 A new non-functional Leu752stop allele identified in the present study explained the saddle-shaped pigmentation of GmWMC073.The classical locus T encoding flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase (F3'H) gene is known to control pigmentation in the hilum and pubescent.43 Among 122 accessions with the ii allele genetic background, the hilum colour of 76 accessions with functional alleles revealed a brown to black colour, whereas 38 accessions with the non-functional allele Lys389fs had a light brown to brown hilum colour. Three new non-functional alleles, Ile325fs, Ala9Thr+Lys389fs, and Asn322fs+Ile325fs were identified; however, Asn322fs+Ile325fs in GmWMC129 and GmWMC134, and Ile325fs in GmWMC153 did not lighten the hilum colour compared to the other non-functional alleles. These non-functional variants explained the grey pubescence colour of 64 accessions, except for Asn322fs+Ile325fs, where a secondary mutation at 325 bp shifted the offset sequence to the reading frame. The W1 locus is known to control the colours of the flower and hypocotyl and encode the flavonoid 3'5'-hydroxylase (F3'5'H) gene.44 The known stop-loss variant in the third exon caused by a 53 bp deletion at Glyma.13G072100 was perfectly identified as the phenotype of 142 accessions with a purple flower and hypocotyl.The stay-green phenotype in the mini-core collections was characterized by the colour of the cotyledon and leaf at maturity. Among the 13 accessions with the stay-green phenotype, nine accessions were found to have heterozygous variant Ile25fs caused by a 5-bp insertion, which led to a frameshift in the psbM gene Glyma.15G208300. Stay-green controlled by cytG is known to be the same 5-bp insertion on chloroplast psbM, which encodes small subunits of photosystem II.36 Since organelle genome sequences did not include read mapping in the present study, the reads including chloroplast psbM have been mapped to the nuclear psbM gene Glyma.15G208300 and were detected as heterozygous variant Ile25fs. The remaining stay-green accessions were characterized as having double recessive genes, d1 and d2.35 The D1 and D2 loci encode the GmSGR1 gene Glyma.11G027400 and GmSGR2 gene Glyma.01G214600, respectively. For the D2 locus, the non-functional known variant, Val60fs, and the new non-functional variant, Lys59fs, at GmSGR2 gene Glyma.01G214600 were observed at five and three accessions, respectively. In contrast, a non-functional known variant of the D1 locus by GmD2IN transposon insertion35 to GmSGR1 gene Glyma.11G027400 was identified from five accessions by manual inspection of the partially aligned Illumina reads to the corresponding genomic region (Chr11:1975880 or Chr11:1975350). Among them, only four accessions (GmWMC011, GmWMC018, GmWMC127, and GmWMC129) revealed a stay-green phenotype by the non-functional variant at both loci.3.6. Survey of rearrangement between soybean genomes during progression based on CNV analysisAs investigations related to the diversity of soybean accessions advanced, we performed CNV analysis for the 198 accessions with Illumina reads, which indicated the trace of the genomic rearrangements (Supplementary Fig. S10).13,14 The distributions of CNVs were generally similar in the three subgroups, indicating that there were only a few large-scale genome rearrangements characterizing subgroups, unlike sequence variances such as SNPs and indels. However, such rearrangements were also observed in some specific accessions such as ‘Bongchubalejama’ (GmWMC089) in 13–16 Mb of Chr01 in the ‘Japan’ subgroup. We confirmed read mapping of these regions, which included long gaps of more than 1 Mb with extremely low read coverage, and found that many genes in these regions have been lost. Accordingly, the phenotype of such accessions with a long gap would be influenced if the target gene of interest lacks in the region. A similar long gap was found in ‘DAIZU’ (GmJMC133) at 30.2–31.0 Mb on Chr08 of the ‘Japan’ subgroup; ‘HOUJAKU’ (GmJMC067) at 14.9–15.7 Mb on Chr10 of the ‘Japan’ subgroup; approximately 24–28 Mb on Chr12 of ‘MEGURO 1’ (GmJMC064) and ‘POCHAL’ (GmWMC020) of the ‘Japan’ subgroup and ‘GREEN PE POKE’ (GmWMC127) and ‘IPPON SANGOU’ (GmJMC076) of the ‘World’ subgroup. This CNV information will contribute to association analysis and gene functional analysis.4. ConclusionsIn the present study, we obtained the whole-genome sequences of 198 soybean accessions, which had been carefully selected to represent the genetic diversity of the worldwide 1,603 accessions31 and particularly represented the variations in Japanese accessions harbouring the distinct genetic and morphological characteristics from those in the Asian continent.32,33 The genetic diversity of the 198 accessions was analysed based on their whole-genome sequences, and then the existence of three subgroups that contain specific and shared polymorphisms was suggested. GWAS on DTF and the detailed comparison between sequence polymorphisms and phenotypes in colour-related traits were performed with the whole-genome sequences of the accessions. The variations in DTF and colour related to the seed coat, hilum, pubescence, and flower were mostly characterized by using the known and new variants observed in the whole-genome sequence reads. CNV analysis suggested that only a few large-scale genome rearrangements may have occurred during the domestication of soybeans. The results suggested that the genomic sequences and variants obtained for the 198 soybean accessions have great potential to provide information for soybean breeding and genetic studies to uncover novel alleles or genes involved in agronomically important traits.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at DNARES online.We thank Kenta Shirasawa, Yoshie Kishia, and Shinobu Nakayama of KDRI for their technical assistance, and Yuichi Katayose of the National Agriculture and Food Research Organization for the discussion related to the I locus in the soybean genome.Accession numberPRJDB7281.FundingThis work was supported by Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) CREST Grant Number JPMJCR16O1 and JPMJCR16O2, the Kazusa DNA Research Institute (KDRI) Foundation, in part by a grant from the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Japan (SFC-1008, BAC2004), and from the Genebank Project, National Agriculture and Food Research Organization (NARO).Conflict of interestNone declared.Data availabilityThe authors confirm that all data underlying the findings are fully available without restriction.

Here, we aimed to construct high-quality de novo genome assemblies of Solanum pimpinellifolium ‘LA1670’ and S. lycopersicum var. cerasiforme ‘LA1673’, originating from Peru. The Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) long-read sequences with 110× and 104× coverages were assembled and polished to generate 244 and 202 contigs spanning 808.8 Mbp for ‘LA1670’ and 804.5 Mbp for ‘LA1673’, respectively. After chromosome-level scaffolding with reference guiding, 14 scaffold sequences corresponding to 12 tomato chromosomes and 2 unassigned sequences were constructed. High-quality genome assemblies were confirmed using the Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs and long terminal repeat assembly index. The protein-coding sequences were then predicted, and their transcriptomes were confirmed. The de novo assembled genomes of S. pimpinellifolium and S. lycopersicum var. cerasiforme were predicted to have 71,945 and 75,230 protein-coding genes, including 29,629 and 29,185 non-redundant genes, respectively, as supported by the transcriptome analysis results. The chromosome-level genome assemblies coupled with transcriptome data sets of the two accessions would be valuable for gaining insights into tomato domestication and understanding genome-scale breeding.1. IntroductionPlant domestication and improvements enable the selection of genes and alleles that are favourable to humans, whereas numerous genes/alleles that are unfavourable to humans are lost in the process. Some of these losses have proved undesirable for breeding. Cultivated tomato [Solanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum (SLL)], which originates from South America, likely occurred in both Peru and Ecuador.1 Cultivated tomatoes have become one of the most important vegetable crops worldwide; they are a rich source of vitamins, minerals, and fibre, as well as a dietary source of antioxidants, although some valuable genes (e.g. a subset of genes associated with biotic and abiotic stresses) were likely lost as an unwanted effect of domestication and improvements.2–5 Due to its global nutritional and economical importance, whole-genome sequence (WGS) of a domesticated tomato accession ‘Heinz 1706 (LA4345)’ was determined in 2012, and it has been updated to date, serving as a valuable resource in both basic and applied research.6,7 On the contrary, ancestral species close to cultivated accessions carry genetic potentials that exert favourable traits. For example, some accessions of S. pimpinellifolium (SP), known to be ancestral tomatoes, exhibit higher tolerance to salt stress and tomato yellow leaf curl virus.8–10 Furthermore, S. lycopersicum var. cerasiforme (SLC), which originated from SP, is also expected to be an ancestor of domesticated tomato and possesses rich genetic loci contributing to increased fruit size.11,12 Additionally, genome-wide association studies of 163 accessions within these Solanum species have revealed a large extent of morphological variations in their flowers and fruit and high intraspecific genome diversity and interspecific diversity.1 Recently, tomato pan-genome analyses have revealed several presence/absence variations within both inter- and intra-genic regions, and they are likely associated with fruit and flower morphological variations and contribute to improve traits.13,14 Thus, increasing available genome information of these ancestral species will facilitate the identification of unique or novel genes that have been lost during the breeding processes.To obtain WGS information, ‘LA1589’ was used to obtain the first draft genome of SP,6 and genome assembly and annotation of ‘LA0480’ were achieved using 101 bp paired-end (PE) short-read libraries and 5 mate-pair libraries. However, both data sets are highly fragmented and incomplete.15 Recently, chromosome-scale genome sequence of ‘LA2093’ was determined using a long-read PacBio sequencer and was annotated to contain 35,761 protein-coding genes, of which 35,535 were validated by the published transcriptome data and/or homologs in the NCBI non-redundant protein database.16 Furthermore, draft genome sequences of several SP and SLC accessions have been determined using a long-read Nanopore sequencer, and several structural variant hotspots have been identified.14 However, chromosome-level genome assemblies, particularly those generated using long-read sequencers, are still limited and should be further improved. In this study, we newly constructed genome assemblies of two ancestral accessions, SP accession ‘LA1670’ and SLC accession ‘LA1673’, which originated in Tana and Lima, Peru, respectively. We first assembled long-read sequences generated using the PacBio Sequel system, and they were polished with Illumina short reads to generate chromosome-level scaffolds. Over 70,000 protein-coding sequences were annotated in both accessions and transcriptome datasets supported the mRNA expression for approximately 39% of the annotated genes. The newly constructed genome assemblies of tomato ancestors will be valuable to explore interspecific and intraspecific variations as well as to identify genes that could improve traits in breeding.2. Materials and methods2.1 Processing data for the WGS of tomatoDNA from young leaves of ‘LA1670’ and ‘LA1673’ (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. S1) was extracted from a single plant of each line using the Maxwell 16 Cell DNA Purification Kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and used for Illumina sequencing. Sequencing data were obtained using Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) with a 150 bp PE mode. Sequenced bases with a quality score of <30 and adaptor sequences were removed using TrimGalore (version 0.6.4) with option –length 90. The quality of the trimmed sequences was checked using FastQC. SMRT sequence libraries were constructed using the SMRTbell Express Template Prep Kit (PacBio, Menlo Park, CA, USA) and used to sequence on a PacBio Sequel system (PacBio, Menlo Park, CA, USA). The long-read sequences were assembled, and the two haplotype sequences of the diploid genome were resolved using Falcon-unzip. Errors in the resultant assembled data were corrected twice by Arrow and polished with 47× Illumina PE data using Pilon, which includes correcting bases, fixing misassemblies, and filling gaps. Chromosome-scale pseudomolecules were produced using reference-guided scaffolding software RaGOO. The pseudomolecule sequences of SP ‘LA1670’ (SPI_r1.0 pmol) and SLC ‘LA1673’ (SLYcer_r1.0 pmol) were named from SPI1.1ch00 to SPI1.1ch12 and from SLYcer1.1ch00 to SLYcer1.1ch12, respectively, according to the mapped chromosomes from SL4.0ch00 to SL4.0ch12 in the SLL ‘Heinz’ genome assemblies (SL4.0). The remaining unassigned sequences of SP and SLC were grouped into SPIUN and SLYcerUN, respectively (UN, unknown). The genome structure of ‘LA1670’ (SPI_r1.0 pmol) and ‘LA1673’ (SLYcer_r1.0 pmol) were compared against ‘LA4345’ (SL4.0, Heinz 1706) using D-GENIES with Minimap2 aligner, and resultant genome assemble of SP and SLC were named as SPI_r1.1 pmol and SLYcer_r1.1 pmol.Morphology of S. pimpinellifolium ‘LA1670’ and Solanum lycopersicum var. cerasiforme ‘LA1673’.

The embryophyta_odb10 data set, created on 20 November 2019, comprises 57 species and 425 genes. The genome completeness of SP and SLC was further analysed using long terminal region (LTR) assessing index (LAI), which is used to evaluate genome quality based on intergenic genome information using LTR retrotransposon (LTR-RT).18 LTR-RT candidates were obtained using LTRharvest and LTR_FINDER_parallel and their accurate LTR-RTs were determined using LTR_retriever as described previously.18 The accurate LTR-RTs were then used to evaluate assembly continuity of the input genome using the LAI with default parameters.2.3 Repetitive sequence detectionRepetitive sequences were detected using RepeatMasker v.4.0.7, where we used repeat sequences obtained from the pseudomolecule sequences, SPI_r1.1 pmol and SLYcer_r1.1 pmol, using RepeatModeler v.1.0.11 and a dataset registered in Repbase.2.4 Gene annotation validation with RNA-SeqPutative protein-coding genes in the genome sequences were predicted using MAKER pipeline, for which we used the RNA-Seq data and peptide sequences predicted from genomes of a tomato (SLL, ITAG4.0), potato (SolTub_3.0), and pepper (ASM51225v2). Two training sets from AUGUSTUS and SNAP were also used in the prediction. Sequences with an annotation edit distance score of >0.5 were selected as high-confidence genes.The total RNA was extracted from 17 organ samples consisting of seven anther samples of different developmental stages (bud size: 3–4, 4–5, 5–6, 6–7, 7–8, and 8–9 mm, and anthesis), anthesis pollen, calyx, green fruit, red fruit, leaf, ovary, white petal of a flower 1-day before anthesis, petal of an anthesis flower, root, and stem from hydroponic-cultivated plants of ‘LA1670’ and ‘LA1673’. The plants were grown in a greenhouse at the University of Tsukuba, Japan. All organs were sampled in the morning between December 2018 and January 2019, and RNA was extracted using RNeasy Mini Kit, and then purified using RNase-Free DNase Set (QIAGEN, USA). Genome-wide RNA expression levels were obtained using Novaseq-PE150 (Illumina) at a depth of 78 Gbp reads. The RNA-Seq data were first trimmed; the bases with a quality score of <30 and adapters were removed using TrimGalore with the option –length 90. We filtered ribosomal RNA (rRNA) reads by applying SortMeRNA. For Iso-Seq analysis, the total RNA was purified as described above and used for cDNA synthesis and amplification using the NEBNext Single Cell/Low Input cDNA Synthesis & Amplification Module and Iso-Seq Express Oligo Kit. A sequencing library was constructed using the SMRTbell Express Template Prep Kit 2.0 and was run on a PacBio Sequel system using the Sequel Binding Kit 3.0/Sequel Sequencing Kit 3.0 according to the manufacturer’s protocol.2.5 Estimating gene and isoform expression levels from RNA-Seq dataThe cleaned reads, devoid of rRNA, were mapped against the assembled genomes and the transcription levels of each gene were calculated using STAR-RSEM pipeline. Genes with transcripts per million (TPM) values of >0 were regarded as expressed. After filtering genes whose expression levels were zero in all tissue samples, the expressed genes were counted using an in-house python script. The transcripts whose isoforms were identified by full-length Iso-Seq sequencing were also regarded as expressed genes.3. Results and discussion3.1 Overview of the two unimproved tomato assembly processFigure 2 represents the experimental design and pipelines used in this study. The genome information of ‘LA1670’ and ‘LA1673’ (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. S1) were obtained from PacBio Sequel and the Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencing platforms, resulting in 86.8 Gb (PacBio) and 112.4 Gb (Illumina), and 77.6 Gb (PacBio) and 110.8 Gb (Illumina) data, respectively. After removing low-quality data and adopter sequences from Illumina PE data, 79.7 and 78.1 Gb sequence data remained for SP and SLC, respectively (Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). The obtained PacBio data of SP and SLC were then assembled into 244 and 201 primary contigs. To correct sequencing errors caused by PacBio sequencers, these contigs were polished using the 47× coverage of cleaned Illumina PE reads with Pilon. The resultant error-corrected contig sequences were 808.8 Mbp with contig N50 of 10.12 Mbp for SP and 804.5 Mbp with N50 of 9.48 Mbp for SLC; these contig sets were named as SPI_r1.1, SLC_r1.1, respectively (Table 1). These assembly sizes were almost equivalent to 786.2 and 770.4 Mbp of genome sizes estimated using the k-mer counting analyses (k-mer = 21; Supplementary Fig. S2) and were comparable size of the SLL reference ‘LA4345’ (SL4.0; 782,520,133).Work-flow used in this study for constructing genomes.Work-flow used in this study for constructing genomes.Statistics of final assembly of S. pimpinellifolium ‘LA1670’ and S. lycopersicum var. cerasiforme ‘LA1673’ by PacBio Sequel systemDDBJ accession numbers: BMBV01000001–BMBV01000244.DDBJ accession numbers: BMBW01000001–BMBW01000202.Statistics of final assembly of S. pimpinellifolium ‘LA1670’ and S. lycopersicum var. cerasiforme ‘LA1673’ by PacBio Sequel systemDDBJ accession numbers: BMBV01000001–BMBV01000244.DDBJ accession numbers: BMBW01000001–BMBW01000202.3.2 Comparison of genome assembliesReference-guided scaffolding of the error-corrected contigs was performed using RaGOO combined with the SLL (SL4.0), which included the tomato 12 chromosomes (ch01–ch12) and unanchored genome sequences designated ch00 that are not mapped to any of the 12 chromosomes. Polished contigs were ordered and orientated using the SL4.0 reference. Then, 242 and 200 contigs of SP and SLC, respectively, were mapped to the 12 tomato chromosomes (SL4.0ch01–ch12; Table 2). Furthermore, two contigs consisting of 1,449,357 bp from SP and 61,018 bp from SLC were non-localized to the corresponding reference genome and assigned as ‘unknown’ (SPIUN and SLYcerUN). These unassigned ‘unknown’ contigs were considered as genomic segments specifically present in SP and SLC. Finally, RaGOO analysis resulted in the total scaffold lengths of 808.8 and 804.5 Mbp, and average scaffold length of 57.8 and 57.5 Mbp, respectively, for SP and SLC (Table 3). These chromosome-level assemblies of SP and SLY were named SPI_r1.1 pmol and SLYcer_r1.1 pmol, respectively (Table 3). The dot plot analysis using D-GENIES between SLL (SL4.0) and both SP and SLC revealed significant consistency for genome organization, while identifying potential structural variants (i.e. indels and inversions) between these species (Fig. 3).Dot plot analysis of the alignments between the constructed genomes and S. lycopersicum genome assemblies.

We used the embryophyta_odb10 data set containing 1,624 core genes. Scaffolds and non-localized contigs of SP contained a higher number of benchmarking genes (96.2%), and a few of those (1.4%) were duplicated as isoform genes according to our BUSCO analyses (Table 4). In contrast, 96.5% of the expected Embryophyta genes were detected as complete BUSCOs in the scaffolded genome sequence of SLC. The benchmarking gene preservation of SP and SLC was almost equivalent to that of SLL (SL4.0; 97.5%).19Statistics of the polished scaffold sequences of S. pimpinellifolium ‘LA1670’ and S. lycopersicum var. cerasiforme ‘LA1673’We used the Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO) (v. 4) method with Embryophyta core gene dataset to evaluate the completeness of the genome annotation.Statistics of the polished scaffold sequences of S. pimpinellifolium ‘LA1670’ and S. lycopersicum var. cerasiforme ‘LA1673’We used the Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO) (v. 4) method with Embryophyta core gene dataset to evaluate the completeness of the genome annotation.The completeness of these genome assemblies and that of SLL (SL4.0) were further validated using LAI, which is used to evaluate assembly continuity and quality of intergenic and repetitive sequences by counting the proportion of intact LTR-RTs in the assembled genome. A higher LAI score is associated with a higher assembly quality of repetitive and intergenic sequence spaces, because of the likely identification of a higher number of intact LTR-RTs.18 The overall distribution of LAI scores was similar among three accessions (Supplementary Fig. S3), but the whole genome LAI score of SLL (SL4.0) was higher (LAI = 10.37) than that of SLL SL2.4 (LAI = 8.0),19 which were sequenced by short reads. Interestingly, SP and SLC presented relatively higher LAI scores, 14.18 and 13.10, respectively. Wild tomato species most likely have a higher number of identifiable intact LTRs and/or longer internal regions than cultivated species, as the LAI score of other SP (LA2079; LAI = 13.14) and S. pennellii (LAI = 14.8) is higher than that of SLL.16,18 According to these quality assessment results, the SP and SLC genomes were classified to be of reference quality based on the assembly of repetitive and intergenic sequence spaces (draft quality, LAI < 10; reference quality, 10 < LAI < 20; and gold quality LAI > 20).19We then analysed repetitive and transposal sequences in SP (SPI_r1.1 pmol) and SLC (SLYcer_r1.1 pmol). The repetitive sequences comprised 535.3 Mb (66.2%) and 532.6 Mb (66.2%) pseudomolecule sequences of SLC and SP, respectively (Supplementary Table S4). The dominant types in the pseudomolecule sequences were LTR-RT (409.7 Mb for SP and 402.0 Mb for SLC), followed by DNA transposons. Specific repeat sequences that were currently unavailable in public databases were 54.3 Mb for SP and 55.3 Mb for SLC. These results indicated that both SP and SLC contain a similar proportion of repetitive and transposal sequences.Next, putative protein-coding genes in the constructed SP (808.8 Mbp) and SLC (804.5 Mbp) genome assemblies were predicted using MAKER pipeline. As a result, 71,945 and 75,230 potential coding sequences were predicted, respectively (Table 2). We then analysed the number of genes commonly or uniquely present in the reference SLL (ITAG4.0), SP, and SLC. Among 34,075 SLL genes, 32,275 (27,201 + 5,074) and 27,760 (27,201 + 559) homologous genes existed in SP and SLC, respectively (Fig. 4). Furthermore, 27,201 SLL genes (79.8%) were present in these three genotypes, with 40,245 and 30,487 genes in SP and SLC, respectively. The fact that 94.7% (32,275/34,075) and 81.5% (27,760/34,075) of SLL genes were present in SP and SLC, respectively, suggests that the genome of ‘LA1670’ is more closely related to ‘LA4345’ than to ‘LA1673’.Number of genes commonly identified among the reference and ancestral tomatoes. Venn graph shows the comparison of redundant and unique genes among the reference tomato (ITAG4.0, SLL_ITAG4.0), SP (SPI_r1.1pmol), and SLC (SLYcer_r1.1pmol). Total gene numbers for SLL, SP, and SLC were 34,075, 71,945, and 75,230, respectively. The number of genes that were common exited among three tomatoes was 27,201, 40,245, and 30,487, in ITAG4.0, SP, and SLC, respectively. The number of genes found in only the reference tomato genes, SP, and SLC were 1,241, 6,452, and 10,241, respectively. The number of total genes for SLL is shown as numbers without brackets, whereas those for SP and SLC are shown as numbers in single and double brackets, respectively.

We obtained RNA-Seq Illumina reads derived from 17 samples of each line to validate gene prediction. All raw reads were trimmed using TrimGalore, which generated 79.7 and 78.1 Gb of high-quality data with a high mapping rate (>96%) from 112.4 and 110.8 Gb of raw data in ‘LA1670’ and ‘LA1673’, respectively (Supplementary Tables S5 and S6). After removing rRNA contamination using SortMeRNA, the cleaned reads were mapped to each of the corresponding genome assemblies of SP (SPI_r1.1 pmol) and SLC (SLYcer_r1.1 pmol) using the STAR-RSEM pipeline, resulting in a mapping rate of 97.0% for SP and 97.8% for SLC. We regarded genes with a TPM value of >0 as expressed genes and identified 29,343 (SP) and 29,075 (SLC) expressed genes in the 17 samples. The protein-coding sequences were further validated by Iso-Seq to generate full-length cDNA sequences or isoforms. The Iso-Seq produced 38,569 and 27,302 isoforms with an average length of 2,657 and 2,428 bp from SP pollen and SLC mature anther, respectively (Supplementary Table S7). The isoform average size was approximately 12 kb with N50 of 2.6–2.8 kb. These isoforms were also mapped on the constructed genome assemblies using Minimap2, resulting in a high mapping rate of 99.98% for SP and 99.88% for SLC. Among the 71,945 SP and 75,230 SLC protein-coding sequences predicted from genome information, 8,296 and 4,135 of them were supported by Iso-Seq reads, respectively, and they were also regarded as expressed genes.Number of expressed genes supported by transcriptomes in S. pimpinellifolium ‘LA1670’ and S. lycopersicum var. cerasiforme ‘LA1673’Total number of expressed genes for SP was calculated as non-redundant genes that were supported by 29,343 illumina RNA-Seq reads and 8,296 Iso-Seq reads.

The genome size of SP and SLC was 808.8 and 804.5 Mbp, respectively (Table 3), which were almost equivalent to the genome sizes estimated using the k-mer counting analysis (Supplementary Fig. S2). Furthermore, using reference-guided scaffolding, we constructed 12 pseudomolecules at the chromosome level with the average scaffold length of 57.8 and 57.5 Mbp (Fig. 3, Table 3), which were considerably higher than that of the reference generated by short-read sequences (scaffold average length = ~5 kbp).6,15 Besides, both SP and SLC genome assemblies presented high BUSCO completeness values (Table 4, 96.2% and 96.5%, respectively), and the LAI values were equivalent to another high-quality genomes, indicating the effectiveness of the long-read sequencing-based de novo assemble strategy.SP has substantial intraspecific genome diversity because of the rich geographic and climatic varieties in their originated and migrated areas (e.g. Ecuador and Peru),20–22 whereas SLC shares SP genome structure as the most recent common ancestor with the cultivated SLL.23 Thus, our newly constructed genome assemblies will facilitate dissection of the genetic and molecular aspects of tomato domestication and evolution. For instance, SP ‘LA1670’ is known to show heat susceptibility,24 whereas SLC ‘LA1673’ shows salinity tolerance and accumulates higher levels of sugars, organic acids, and volatiles associated with tomato flavour than cultivated varieties.25,26 Moreover, in this study, we identified 6,452 and 10,241 unique genes from SP and SLC, respectively, which are not present in SLL (SL4.0; Fig. 4). Genome and gene information obtained in this study will be beneficial for dissecting these traits for breeding; it can also be used to explore gene function of these ancestral-specific genes.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at DNARES online.We thank S.

It is considered as a highly nutritious food fish and has the capability to walk to some distance, and survive a considerable period without water. Assembly, scaffolding and several rounds of iterations resulted in 3,484 scaffolds covering ~94% of estimated genome with 9.88 Mb largest scaffold, and N50 1.31 Mb. The genome possessed 23,748 predicted protein encoding genes with annotation of 19,279 orthologous genes. A total of 166 orthologous groups represented by 222 genes were found to be unique for this species. The Computational Analysis of gene Family Evolution (CAFE) analysis revealed expansion of 207 gene families and 100 gene families have rapidly evolved. Genes specific to important environmental and terrestrial adaptation, viz. urea cycle, vision, locomotion, olfactory and vomeronasal receptors, immune system, anti-microbial properties, mucus, thermoregulation, osmoregulation, air-breathing, detoxification, etc. were identified and critically analysed. The analysis clearly indicated that C. magur genome possessed several unique and duplicate genes similar to that of terrestrial or amphibians’ counterparts in comparison to other teleostean species. The genome information will be useful in conservation genetics, not only for this species but will also be very helpful in such studies in other catfishes.1. IntroductionFamily Clariidae (air-breathing catfishes) is an important group of ray-finned fishes those are primarily the inhabitants of freshwater ecosystem representing 116 species in 16 genera with diverse distribution throughout Africa and Asia (https://www.fishbase.in/search.php, accessed on 07 March 2020). The walking catfish Clarias magur (Hamilton, 1822), one of the 116 valid species of family Clariidae, is a freshwater catfish popularly known as magur.1,2 The C. magur was differentiated from Clarius batrachus by Ng and Kottelat3 based on deeply serrated pectoral spine and the difference in the head shape. This was also genetically differentiated with Indian Clariids based on mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) sequences.1 The species is popular for good taste and a valuable source of dietary protein and the increase in demand for the fish led to massive over exploitation. Its culture has gained priority among the catfishes in India and adjacent countries viz. Bangladesh and Nepal due to striking therapeutic and nutritional attributes, but could not gain momentum due to the complex captive breeding behaviour. It is categorized as an endangered (A3cde + 4acde) species as per IUCN Red List (https://www. iucnredlist.org/species/168255/6470089, accessed on 07 March 2020). Magur belongs to the group of the amphibious air-breathing catfish which are adapted to inhabit muddy marsh, swamp areas and also transit to terrestrial habitat for short duration4,5 in search of water. Hence, the species generally experiences hypoxia, which gets aggravated due to water deficit during the summer season. The fish can survive both in water and land habitats as it has innate characters and the underlying molecular pathways to face the challenges of both the habitats.The life is supposed to have originated from aquatic habitat, the transition to terrestrial habitat was considered to be a big leap in biological evolution. For this habitat transition, the radical changes in biological processes took place during millions of years of evolution. To cope up with two different habitats, amphibious fishes underwent adaptation that might have included perception, olfaction, aerial respiration, terrestrial locomotion, immunological evolution, higher ammonia tolerance, modification of aerial vision, ionic balance, osmoregulation, detoxification of xenobiotic compounds, etc.6,7 For terrestrial locomotion, magur uses pectoral fins for snake-like movement. It also possesses dual breathing adaptation to survive even in water with low dissolved oxygen (DO) and air. The accessory respiratory organ in C. magur comprises supra-branchial chambers, the fan or gill plates and the respiratory tree.8,9 Various Clarias species were reported to produce mucus on their skin surface to protect against microorganism and to prevent water loss during land migration.10–12 The epidermal mucus of C. magur possesses a broad spectrum of antibacterial properties and helps to prevent colonization by parasites and fungi.13 Magur is also reported to be a facultative ureotelic that uses urea cycle to convert the harmful ammonia to urea during terrestrial adaptation.14 Comparative genomics and evolutionary analysis of selected traits can provide the understanding of the pathways or mechanisms responsible for fish ecology and adaptation.In the present study, we generated a draft genome of C. magur through assembly of next-generation sequencing (NGS) data from different sequencing platforms and thoroughly analysed, which gave a comprehensive insight on environmental and terrestrial adaptation genes. The salient structural variation in genes with respect to the specific traits for environmental and terrestrial adaptation including locomotion, immunity, osmoregulation, ionic balance, vision, olfaction, detoxification of xenobiotic compounds, etc. that distinguished C. magur from other fishes were identified and discussed. The genome sequence information of this species represents an important resource and knowledge to develop genomic selection strategies to overcome the problems associated with this valuable catfish and also to boost both the fundamental and the applied research in C. magur as well as other important catfish species.2. Materials and methods2.1. Fish specimenFor whole genome sequencing, a farm bred and reared healthy male specimen of C. magur from ICAR-Central Institute of Freshwater Aquaculture (CIFA), Bhubaneswar, India, was chosen. The fish was anesthetized and the testes samples were collected in September 2013. Handling of fish was carried out following the guidelines for control and supervision of experiments on animals by the Government of India and approved by Institutional Animal Ethics Committee (AEC) of ICAR-National Bureau of Fish Genetic Resources (NBFGR) and ICAR-CIFA. For genome size estimation methodology please see Supplementary note 1.1.2.2. Genome sequencingHigh molecular weight genomic DNA was extracted using standard phenol–chloroform extraction method15 at ICAR-CIFA. A multi-platform (short, medium and log reads) sequencing strategy was adopted to generate approximately 180-fold NGS data on five different NGS platforms. Useful NGS data utilized in the genome assembly is presented in Table 1. Brief sequencing methodology is given in Supplementary note 1.2.Summary of NGS data generated in C. magur using multiple NGS platformsSummary of NGS data generated in C. magur using multiple NGS platforms2.3. De novo genome assemblyPre-processing of the raw reads/data of Illumina, Roche 454 and Ion Torrent (which includes filtering and removal of low-quality bases and reads with adaptor contamination) was carried out using NGSQC Toolkit16 to obtain a set of high-quality usable reads, while pre-processing of NanoporeMinIon and PacBio data was done using in-built feature of MaSuRCA software Version 3.2.9.17 The de novo genome assembly was carried out through a hybrid approach following a pipeline utilizing both short and long reads generated from multiple NGS platforms (Fig. 1). Initially, the assembly was carried out on MaSuRCA software utilizing both long and short reads data. The PacBio and Nanopore MinIon reads were supplied as Nanopore type in MaSuRCA assembler. The assembly was further improved by iterating with two rounds of Pilon18 software using Illumina reads followed by scaffolding using SSPACE19 and gap closing with SOAPdenovoGapCloser20 and LR_Gapcloser21 for improving the assembly. After closing the gaps, the assembly was further improved by 10 rounds of iteration using Pilon.Workflow depicting strategy for genome assembly using multi-platforms NGS data.

Assembly completeness and genome characterizationThe genome assembly completeness validation was assessed using three criteria, viz. BUSCO (Benchmarking Universal Single Copy Orthologs)22 analysis, N50 value, and remapping of the NGS reads, transcriptome reads and bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) end sequences (generated in our lab, unpublished), expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences downloaded from the public domain on to the assembled scaffolds. The N50 value for the genome scaffolds was generated using an in-house Perl script, while reads mapping was done using Bowtie223 software. The guanine-cytosine (GC) content of the C. magur genome was calculated using an in-house Perl script. Repeat identification was carried out using both homology and de novo-based approaches. First, RepeatMasker (v. 3.3.0)24 (http://www.repeatmasker.org) was employed to detect known transposable elements (TEs) based on a homology search against the Repbase TE library (release 17.01).25 Subsequently, LTRharvest26 (http://www.repeatmasker.org) and RepeatModeler (v. 1.05)27 were applied with the default parameters to construct the de novo repeat library. Then the RepeatMasker was used to identify and classify novel TEs against the de novo repeat library. All the repeats were finally combined together with the filtering of redundant repetitive sequences. RNA prediction was done using RNA prediction module of WGSSAT software,28 while simple sequence repeats (SSR) prediction was carried out using MISA29 tools. The heterozygosity in C. magur genome was also analysed by mapping of the quality Illumina reads to the assembled scaffolds using Bowtie2. The single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) identification was carried out using Samtools mpileup.302.5. Gene prediction and functional annotationWe combined the homology (Scipio31) de novo (Augustus32 and GlimmerHMM33) EST (Exonerate34) and transcript alignment-based approaches (HISAT35,36 and StringTie36) to predict the protein coding genes in the C. magur genome (Fig. 2).

Comparative genome and evolution analysisProtein sequences from 14 species viz. Astyanax mexicanus (Family: Characidae), Danio rerio (Family: Cyprinidae), Gasterosteus aculeatus (Family: Gasterosteidae), Gadus morhua (Family: Gadidae), Ictalurus punctatus (Family: Ictaluridae), Latimeria chalumnae (Family: Latimeriidae), Lepisosteus oculatus (Family: Lepisosteidae), Oryzias latipes (Family: Adrianichthyidae), Oreochromis niloticus (Family: Cichlidae), Poecilia formosa (Family: Poeciliidae), Petromyzon marinus (Family: Petromyzontidae), Tetraodon nigroviridis (Family: Tetraodontidae), Takifugu rubripes (Family: Tetraodontidae), Xiphophorus maculatus (Family: Poeciliidae) were used for comparison of gene sets. The OrthoFinder pipeline37 was used to deduce the gene family in the common ancestor of the species and to understand the evolutionary relationship among the annotated genes through cross species comparative analyses by performing all vs. all blast using the BLASTp tool with e-value cut off value 10-5. The single copy genes were further aligned using MUSCLE software38 and the conserved regions were extracted using Gblocks server39 with default parameters. The coding sequences of each single copy gene family were concatenated to form one super gene for each species. The phylogenetic analysis of the super alignment was performed using maximum-likelihood method implemented in PhyML (ver. 3.0) software40 with Jones-Taylor-Thornton (JTT) model for amino acid (AA) substitutions, a gamma correction with four discrete classes and an estimated alpha parameter. The PAML MCMCtree program41,42 was used to estimate the divergence times among the species based on the approximate likelihood method43 and the molecular clock data, which was taken from the divergence time of TimeTree database44 between the fugu and the tetraodon.The computational analysis of gene family evolution (CAFE)45 analysis was carried out with default parameters to estimate the contraction and expansion of the genes with respect to the above mentioned 14 fish species. The positive selections of the genes were carried out on the single copy genes present in 11 fish species, viz. D. rerio, G. aculeatus, G. morhua, I. punctatus, L. oculatus, O. latipes, O. niloticus, P. formosa, T. nigroviridis, T. rubripes and X. maculatus, by estimating the dn/ds ratio using the codeML package of PAML software (version 4.9).41 Additional information is provided in Supplementary note 1.5.2.7. Retrieval of genes for specific features and environmental and terrestrial adaption and their comparative analysis with respect to C. magurThe methodology in brief for retrieval, identification and analysis of environmental and terrestrial adaption specific genes and comparative analysis with respect to C magur is described in Supplementary note 1.6.3. Results and discussionIn the present study, the C. magur genome was sequenced using multiple sequencing platforms and assembled through a pipeline utilizing hybrid assembly strategy. A slight variation in genome size of magur was recorded as 929 Mb with flow-cytometry,46 927.8 Mb by KmerGenie47 and 1.02 Gb through MaSuRCA assembler. In comparison, the other catfishes have genome sizes of ~ 700 Mb (Pangasianodon hypophthalmus),48 1.0 Gb (I. punctatus)49 and ~ 900 Mb (C. batrachus).50 It is assumed that C. magur have undergone the teleost-specific genome duplication (TSGD) event, as the event was reported in other catfishes.51,523.1. Genome assembly, completeness and characterizationUsing MaSuRCA based hybrid assembly, a total of 4,189 scaffolds were obtained which was further reduced to 3484 after scaffolding with SSPACE program (Table 2). The Non-ATGC characters or gaps in the assembly were reduced by many folds with application of GapClosure tool, followed by LR GapClosure. The 10 rounds of iteration with Pilon software further reduced the gaps in assembly by 1.05 folds. The final assembly resulted in a high-quality draft genome of C. magur distributed in 3,484 scaffolds covering 94% of genome, with 1.3 Mb N50 value and 9.88 Mb largest scaffold. Additional information is provided in Supplementary note 2.1-2.Assembly statistics of C. magur genome at different level of assembly proceduresAssembly statistics of C. magur genome at different level of assembly proceduresRepeat content in important fish genomesRepeat content in important fish genomesThe draft genome of C. magur exhibited 95.6% genome completeness (2,472 genes) including 2,377 (91.9%) complete or single copy genes, 94 (3.6%) complete and duplicated genes, 39 (1.5%) fragmented genes and 76 (3.0%) missing genes when compared with the BUSCO listed genes (2,586 genes). The BUSCO estimate of 95.6% completeness of the core genes in the genome was almost similar to I. punctatus, but higher than the other catfish genomes. The final assembly obtained in this study resulted in high continuity and completeness of the genome as the N50 value was higher than the C. batrachus and Pelteobagrus fulvidraco assemblies, but lower than the I. punctatus and P. hypophthalmus (Supplementary Table S1). The analyses of this genome provide a comprehensive understanding of the evolution of C. magur with respect to other fish species and the genes/gene families which were evolved in C. magur for environmental/terrestrial adaptation.The GC content in C. magur genome (39.83%) is slightly higher than the C. batrachus (39.2%), I. punctatus (39%), P. hypophthalmus (38.3), D. rerio (36.64), Labeo rohita (39.64) and Cyprinus carpio (37), but lower than the Tetradon nigroviridis (46.4%), T. rubripes (45.54%), O latipes (40.91%) and G. aculeatus (44.6%). GC content is an important feature of the genome which is reported to have high correlation with the recombination rates in the mammals, chicken and insects.55–57 The correlation between the GC content and the recombination rate have also been reported in I. punctatus, where females had higher recombination rate and GC content than the males.58The estimated repeats content in C. magur was slightly higher than the I. punctatus, C. batrachus and other teleosts, but lower than the D. rerio. The variation in repeat coverage as compared to I. punctatus indicated that C. magur had undergone slightly more active adaptive evolution (Table 3). The variation in repeat content plays an important role in adaptive evolution and genome structure in fishes and other vertebrates due to unequal recombination.59–61 Although C. batrachus and C. magur are closely related but later one contains higher repeat elements. This might be one of the reasons for the higher genome size (1.02 Gb) in C. magur as compared to C. batrachus (900 Mb). The fraction of Class-I TE (retro-transposons) and Class-II TE (DNA transposons) were 16.82 and 13.54%, respectively, to the total genome assembly (Supplementary Table S2). The distribution of Class-I TE in C. magur was higher in comparison to I. punctatus, but lower for Class II TE. The most abundant transposon family in C. magur was reported to be DNA/TcMar-Tc1 that covered 8.61% of the genome with 344,880 copy number that accounted for 19.71% of the total predicted repeatomes in C. magur (Supplementary Table S2). Thus, the result correlates with the I. punctatus repeatome, where DNA/TcMar-Tc1 covers 20% of the repeatome. Genome coverage by the SINE elements was more in C. magur as compared to the I. punctatus, T. rubripes and O. latipes, but little lower than D. rerio.3.2. Gene prediction and annotationIn the magur genome 23,748 proteins encoding genes were predicted and annotated (Fig. 3) and 82.71% of these predicted genes were supported by the EST or RNA-Seq evidence. The protein coding genes were almost similar in number to that of I. punctatus and D. rerio. Average gene and coding sequence lengths were 13,879 and 1,335 bp, respectively, with an average of eight exons per gene, which is almost similar to D. rerio, but less than I. punctatus (Table 4). The Blast2GO analysis for functional annotation resulted homology of 99.7% of the annotated genes to protein present in NR database, 67% showed identity with InterPro database, 87.23% were mapped on Gene Ontology (GO) terms, while 56.6% were mapped on Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database.Gene annotation statistics of C. magur genome.

Genome evolutionThe cross species comparative analysis using OrthoFinder revealed that a total of 19,279 genes in C. magur were orthologous with the 14 teleost species, out of which 43 genes were single copy orthologues among the species, which were used in phylogenetic analyses. The phylogenetic relationship obtained from the single copy genes data set yielded (Fig. 4) almost similar result to that of the previous reports.48–50 The MCMC tree analysis revealed that the C. magur evolved around 40 million years ago (mya) and the Clarids diverged 60.8 mya from I. punctatus. Further, 14,716 orthologous genes were observed in magur and 17,499 genes in I. punctatus, where 8,288 orthologous groups were found to be common between I. punctatus and C. magur. A total of 983 ortho-groups represented by 1,968 genes were present in I. punctatus, but absent in C. magur.Phylogenetic relationship based on single copy genes among different fishes.

The blue box represents the position of C. magur in the phylogenetic tree which forms clade with I. punctatus.Since coelacanth (L. chalumnae) is known for its transition from water to land,62 thus, comparing the genes lost in coelacanth and C. magur, in comparison to I. punctatus, may provide a clue regarding the genes which were lost during the course of land adaptation. As compared to I. punctatus, about 3,935 orthologous genes were absent in coelacanth, and 582 genes were lost both in C. magur and coelacanth. Further, the two species also lost the elastin like genes, while it was present in high copy numbers in I. punctatus. Aquatic teleost possesses a heart outflow tract, known as ‘bulbus arteriosus’, as their respiratory component. Elastin genes, especially elastin b, are a major component for neofunctionalization and acquisition of bulbus arteriosus.63 Although C. magur and coelacanth possess elastin b genes but lack other elastin genes. To acquire air-breathing capability during the land transition, it is important to acquire cardiac muscle rather than smooth muscle, thus, the elastin may have been lost during the course of evolution. With respect to the I. punctatus, 13 olfactory genes were found to be absent in C. magur and coelacanth. During land adaptation, various terrestrial specific olfactory genes were gained while some aquatic specific olfactory genes lost. The loss of two genes viz. Gpatch3 and cdipt responsible for lens development in camera-type eye64 gives a small hint that how the fishes have modified their vision for terrestrial adaptation.A total of 166 orthologous groups, represented by 222 genes, were found to be unique in C. magur. These genes were manually checked to confirm its uniqueness using literature and databases, such as UniProt and NCBI’s Protein. A total of 20 genes were found to be uniquely present in C. magur, but absent in other reported teleosts. (Supplementary Table S3: Unique_genes_Annotation). Some of the genes which are generally not reported in teleost are uniquely present in C. magur. Organisms’ adaptation and acquisition of new functions doesn’t solely depend on the acquisition of new genes but also on intense selective pressure acting on different gene families. To overcome the challenges of terrestrial adaptation, the C. magur might have undergone positive selection in its gene families. We identified 203 positively selected genes in C. magur from 541 one-to-one orthologues representing 11 teleost genomes (Supplementary Table S4: Positive_gene_selection). The positively selected key protein coding genes of C. magur are discussed (Supplementary note). The CAFE analysis of C. magur genome revealed 207 gene families were expanded, 89 gene families were contracted and 100 gene families were observed to be rapidly evolving (Supplementary Table S5: CAFE Summary). It was noticed that the C. magur genome is likely to have highest expansion and rapidly evolving gene families after P. formosa and D. rerio (Fig. 5). Most of the expanded genes are related to immunological functions. These genes might play important role in adaptation of C. magur on land as it has to face the pathogens of both water and land habitats. Around 100 copies of extracellular calcium-sensing receptor are present in C. magur. These receptors have a key role in calcium storage and homeostasis. The transition of fish from sea water to freshwater and then the terrestrial adaptation needs change in mineral content and physiology. Fishes have continuous access to calcium in water and the regulation of the internal calcium level was done by gills and intestine, whereas the terrestrial vertebrates occasionally ingest calcium. The plasma concentration of calcium is almost the same in fishes and terrestrial vertebrates.65 Thus, a large copy number of calcium-sensing receptors found in C. magur might help them to store and regulate calcium level when it is on land.Phylogenetic tree constructed based on the single copy genes among different fish species showing number of gene families in different colours, i.e. red+ Values: numbers of expanded gene families, blue-values: numbers of contracted gene families and maroon-values: numbers of rapidly evolving genes families.

The expansion, contraction and rapidly evolving gene families were estimated by CAFÉ analysis.A total of 23 copies of myoglobin genes were reported in C. magur, which is higher than the C. batrachus (15 copies), lungfish (7 copies), and most of them other vertebrates (2–3 copies).50 These genes were arranged on five scaffolds of C. magur genome. Out of 23 genes’ copies, 19 were arranged as tandem repeats on Scaffold 320 (14 copies) and on Scaffold 248 (5 copies), which is also reported to be tandemly duplicated in C. batrachus.50  Myoglobin genes role are crucial for adaptation in hypoxic condition, where they rapidly oxygenate and deoxygenate to maintain oxygen balance during the period of fluctuation in oxygen supply and demand.66,67 Ten copies of sult16b gene were significantly expanded in C. magur, while 12 copies were reported in C. batrachus.50  Sult16b gene eliminates or neutralizes the deleterious effect of different xenobiotic compounds from aquatic and terrestrial environments and, thereby, may protect the C. magur in the hypoxic conditions.50,68,69 Additional information is provided in Supplementary note, 2.3-4.C. magur is a facultative ureotelic organism, which changes to ammonotelic when it lives in water and excretes ammonia as a waste product; but switches to ureotelic when it lives on land or under limited water availability and excretes urea as a waste product. Switching from ammonotelic to facultative ureotelic was a key step in transition from water to land.70 Urea is produced by two pathways, viz. purine catabolism and urea cycle. The carbamoyl phosphate synthetase (CPS) is an essential enzyme of urea cycle and three different isoforms of CPS genes (CPSI, II, III) are reported in vertebrates. CPSII is involved in pyramiding biosynthesis, while CPSI and III are involved in nitrogen metabolism via ornithine–urea cycle.71,72  CPSI is found mainly in terrestrial vertebrates, while CPSII is found in all vertebrates. CPSIII is present in fishes and invertebrates. CPSI utilizes ammonia as a nitrogen donor, while CPSIII utilizes glutamine. Lungfishes are facultative ureotelic and their CPS is more of terrestrial vertebrate specific rather than fish specific.73 Saha and Ratha5 reported that C. batrachus and H. fossilis showed both CPSI and CPSIII activities. To check whether the C. magur’s CPSIII is fish specific or specific to terrestrial adapted vertebrates like lungfish, we retrieved genes related to urea cycle and performed a phylogeny of all the three reported CPS from mammals, amphibians and fishes. CPSII separates the fish specific CPSII clade from other CPSII in phylogeny, but CPSIII is reported to be more fish specific rather than terrestrial vertebrate specific (Supplementary Fig. S1). There are also reports that both glutamine and ammonia can act as a nitrogen substrate for CPSIII, but the enzymatic activity is much less when the nitrogen substrate is ammonia.74,75 In understanding the selective pressure operating on the urea cycle pathway in the selected species, positive selection was absent in C. magur, but the ASS gene was found to be positively selected (P < 0.05) in C. batrachus.50 An interesting observation was seen with CPSIII enzyme of C. magur that exhibited constraint selection, as also observed in coelacanth62 where terrestrial vertebrates containing CPSI displayed constraint selection when compared with teleost CPSIII (Table 5). Thus, it may be concluded that both ammonia and glutamine could act as a nitrogen source but with different specificity. The fishes which have the capacity to migrate to land possess both glutamine and ammonia as nitrogen source and switch according to the habitat. The glutamine activity was lost in tetrapod vertebrates as the CPSI don’t show glutamine activity.Statistics of positive selection analysis consisting of five core genes of urea cycle presenting C. magur genomeStatistics of positive selection analysis consisting of five core genes of urea cycle presenting C. magur genomeAmmonia is the primary nitrogenous waste in fishes which is highly toxic and should be excreted promptly or converted to a less toxic form. C. magur is a facultative ureotelic organism. The urea cycle CPSIII enzyme of C. magur showed positive selection towards the terrestrial vertebrate side. Thus, the CPSIII transformed itself to terrestrial vertebrate specific ammonia excretion which is achieved in the form of urea by utilizing urea cycle to adapt on land successfully. The C. magur also contained one copy of Hiuase enzyme, like D. rerio, lungfish and various tetrapods, while two copies were present in coelacanth. This enzyme in C. magur is closely related to D. rerio. It is responsible for urea production by purine catabolism, thereby, helps in elimination of ammonia in the form of urea.The light behaviour in both the water and the air medium differ due to their different refractive indices (i.e. 1.33 and 1.00, respectively). The obligate aquatic fishes possess myopic vision in air, while amphibious fishes (like mudskipper, C. magur, coelacanth and lungfishes) need to be enriched for both the aquatic and the terrestrial vision with specialized eye for good aerial vision to protect themselves from the terrestrial predators. Visual pigments are composed of an opsin gene and chromophore, which is linked by a Schiff’s base.Vertebrates contain five opsin genes subfamilies, viz. rhodopsin (RH1), green-sensitive (RH2), long wavelength sensitive (LWS), short wave sensitive (SWS1 and SWS2), and are related to vision pigment. In C. magur, three copies of LWS genes and single copy of RH1 and RH2 genes are present while SW opsin genes (SWS1 and SWS2) were absent which helps in ultraviolet vision. Aquatic fishes need ultraviolet vision and so they possess SW opsin genes, while terrestrial animals tend their vision more towards the violet vision rather than ultraviolet, thereby, reducing the damage of retina from UV rays. Since ultraviolet light leads to retinal damage,76 thus, many vertebrates including human, chicken, cow, etc. have evolved a protective mechanism which minimizes the retinal damage by shifting SWS1 function more towards violet range.77  C. magur and mudskipper have evolved from this barrier by losing the two SWS genes from their genome. The peak absorption spectra based on the five crucial sites (S180A, H197Y, Y277F, T285A and A308S)7 was found to be between 531 and 560 nm and, thus, two genes (LWS1 and LWS2) in C. magur might be responsible for wide range of colour sensitivity, with respect to other fishes, which might aid C. magur to achieve a better vision adaptation on land as well as in the water.78 The absence of genes for lens development in camera-type eyes in C. magur also gives small hints that how the fish have modified their vision for terrestrial adaptation.C. magur is known for its ability for locomotion on land, especially during or just after the rainfall, covering a good distance. The terrestrial locomotion of C. magur is much similar to the snake-like movement achieved by pulling its body across land with the help of pectoral fins. The HOX genes cluster play a crucial role in shaping various body structures during the development, mainly limb development in tetrapods. The limb muscle activity is controlled by the motor neuron present at the brachial and lumbar portions of the spinal cord, which is arranged on a ventral column, known as the lateral motor column (LMC).The C. magur uses pectoral fins, with one thick and strong fin ray, for terrestrial locomotion that may be due to the acquisition of the extra copy of HOXC9 gene (i.e. HOXC9b). The presence of HOXC9b and HOXA9 might prevent Foxp1 activation followed by blocking of HOX5–HOX8 protein (Fig. 6), thereby, limiting the LMC to the areas of the spinal cord adjacent to the limbs.79 The higher level of Foxp1 gene in the progenitors initiates the development of LMC neurons by activating molecular cascades, comprising a variety of the transcription factors, followed by the Radh2 protein that helps in determination of the defined neuronal subtypes within LMC. However, Jung et al.80 opined that it is not adequate to prevent LMC formation just by blocking the HOX5–HOX8 protein expression, but it requires both HOXC9 and HOXA9 activities. The fuel for such locomotion requires partial catabolism of AAs that leads to the formation of the alanine and, thus, the excess cellular ammonia can be converted to alanine. The alanine is further used as an energy source for locomotion, as in the case of mudskipper, but it is still not evaluated in C. magur or C. batrachus.81 Further study is required to verify the use of alanine as an energy source for locomotion in walking catfishes. The enzyme responsible for partial AA catabolism is present in C. magur, but there is no experimental evidence, although this may be useful for locomotion as well as to lower the nitrogenous content in the cell. Additional information is provided in Supplementary note 2.6.An illustration of the probable role of HoxC9b and HoxA9 in limb development based on the gene functions. The presence of HOXA9 and extra copy of HOXC9 (i.e. HOXC9b), might prevent Foxp1 activation followed by blocking of HOX5–8 protein. The inactivation of foxp1 restricts the LMC to the areas of the spinal cord adjacent to the limbs and thereby helps in locomotion. (a) Due to absence of HOXC9b gene in zebrafish, HOXCA9 might not fully block the activation of the HOX5-8 proteins thereby activating foxp1. (b) While the presence of HOXC9b fully blocks the activation of HOX5–HOX8 genes.

The odorant molecules in the environment are detected through the ORs. The olfactory repertoire in C. magur almost resembles the other teleost and we didn’t find any air-borne olfactory system here, as in case of animals (Fig. 7). Teleost fishes usually contain 30–71 delta class ORs, while 79 OR is reported in C. magur, indicating that this species has a rich source of water-based odorants. As the C. magur is partial land dwelling and could spend a considerable time out of water on land, the absence of alpha and gamma groups of ORs for air-borne odorant is surprising.

Fishes don’t have a dedicated vomeronasal system, as found in mammals and other vertebrates, but the vomeronasal receptors are present in fish nasal cavity.82 These vomeronasal receptors are classified into two categories, viz. V1R and V2R. The air-borne pheromones bind to the V1R, while water soluble pheromones bind to the V2R.83 The teleost V1R is expressed in olfactory epithelium, which is further classified into six groups (viz. ORa1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6), where ORa1–ORa2, ORa3–ORa4 and ORa5–ORa6 are forming three phylogenetic clades.84The C. magur genome possesses all six types of V1R receptors and 25 functional V1R genes. The teleost V1R is also known as OR class A (ORa). We identified 17 tandem repeat copies of ORa1–ORa2 receptor, four copies of ORa3, ORa4 and five copies of ORa5, ORa6 in C. magur, while 15 copies of ORa1–ORa2 reported in C. batrachus. The ORa1–ORa2 clusters of V1R genes fall with mammalian lineage as reported in the phylogeny (Fig. 8), thereby, providing an extra benefit to C. magur to sense both air- and water-borne odorants. C. magur also possess 37 intact V2R receptors, lesser than the D. rerio (53) and the I. punctatus (43), but higher than the other reported teleost fish species.Vomeronasal type 1 receptors’ (V1r) gene-based phylogenetic relationship among the vertebrates showing expansion of ora1 in C. magur genome. C. magur possess all six types of V1r receptor (viz. Ora1, Ora2, Ora3, Ora4, Ora5 and Ora6). Ora1–Ora2 showed tandem duplication of 17 genes and falls in same clade with mammalian V1r (which is shown by red colour triangle).Vomeronasal type 1 receptors’ (V1r) gene-based phylogenetic relationship among the vertebrates showing expansion of ora1 in C. magur genome. C. magur possess all six types of V1r receptor (viz. Ora1, Ora2, Ora3, Ora4, Ora5 and Ora6). Ora1–Ora2 showed tandem duplication of 17 genes and falls in same clade with mammalian V1r (which is shown by red colour triangle).The adaptive/acquired immune system in vertebrates comprises major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I and II proteins along with their regulator proteins. The MHC I involves in presentation of antigens derived from the intracellular environment, while MHC II present antigens derived from the antigen presenting cells, like macrophages, B cells or dendritic cells.85 We identified 16 MHC I genes in C. magur distributed in lineages, viz. five copies of U lineage, five copies of Z lineage, five copies of L lineage and one copy of S lineage. MHC II genes consist of 12 alpha and 15 beta copies. The variation in MHC I genes present in C. magur may provide additional benefits as more diverse range of pathogens are found on the land. The species needs an extra gadget of immune system for land adaptation to deal with the pathogens of both the land and the aquatic habitats. The presence of transcriptional regulators, thymus transcription factor and T cell receptor might also provide strength to the immune system of the C. magur.The amphibious fishes have to adapt themselves among the wide range of pathogens residing both in land and water. C. magur possesses a well-developed immune system that comprised of all the genes required for innate as well as adaptive immunity. In teleost, three antibody isotypes of immunoglobulin heavy chains, mediating the humoral immune response, are present and characterized as immunoglobulin heavy chains delta (IgD), mu (IgM), and tau (IgT).86 All the immunoglobulin heavy chain loci were distributed on two scaffolds in C. magur genome, where 20 IgD constant domains, 8 IgM constant domains and 3 zeta domains were present on scaffold 290; and 9 IgD constant domains, 3 IgM constant domains and 3 zeta domains were located on scaffold 33. Additional information is provided in Supplementary note 2.8.The innate immunity of C. magur also reflects a well characterized immune component which provides different layers of protection against a wide range of pathogens. Innate immunity of C. magur is characterized by inflammasome activation (Supplementary Fig. S2), which in turn activates a cascade of proteins and signalling pathways involved in inflammatory responses. Inflammasome assembly can be activated either through pathogen pattern recognition receptors followed by activation and production of IL-1 family cytokines to trigger a local/systematic acute phase response or through promoting the cell death of intracellular pathogens via pyroptosis.87,88 In the magur genome, we also identified all the genes and/or components that might be involved in the inflammasome assembly and its activation. It also shows the expansion in the TLR-13 genes that helps in extracellular pathogen pattern recognition. There are also expansions in various immune-like domains in C. magur when compared with the other teleosts. Some of the immunological genes also show positive selection, thereby, giving an added feature to C. magur to combat with its diverse and wide range of pathogens. C. magur also has a large repertoire of mucin genes which helps in secretion of mucus. Mucus not only helps in preventing water loss from the body but also forms a barrier to pathogen and it also contains various immunoglobulins. Additional information about Mucin genes in C. magur is also provided in Supplementary note 2.9.C. magur showed presence of seven antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) which also help it to fight against pathogens from two different habitats. Additional information about AMP genes in C. magur is given in Supplementary note 2.10.Desiccation on land is the major challenge for terrestrial adaptation. To survive on land, the amphibious fish should have some mechanism to prevent water loss or obtain sufficient water and avoid thermal imbalances. In order to avoid water loss, some fishes have habitat beneath rock and vegetation, while some remain in logs or moisten their body by rolling in mud.6 Land dwelling fishes and amphibians have a cutaneous surface on their skin which secretes mucus and, thereby, inhibits cutaneous water loss and desiccation. Lungfishes form a mucus cocoon during aestivation to reduce water loss.89  C. magur possesses a well-developed mucin system with 15 mucin genes showing expansion. There is also an expansion of the MUC19 gene in C. magur, with respect to D. rerio, which is expressed in the dorsal and ventral skin of frogs and regarded as the major mucin protein on the surface.90  C. magur also possesses expanded copies of thermoregulation genes which sense high temperature. TRPV1 is a thermoregulatory gene with two copies in C. magur, but just a single copy in D. rerio, that get activated at noxious temperature, while it also has TRPV4, TRPM4 and TRPM5 that get activated at warm temperature.91  C. magur can also survive in a very low temperature as it has 11 copies of TRPM8 genes that sense cold temperature. Additional information about thermoregulatory genes of C. magur is given in Supplementary note 2.11.Biological systems need a constant mechanism to exchange water and nutrients with the environment either by consumption of water in liquid form or food or its excretion in the form of urine, sweat and faeces. Thus, the osmotic homeostasis regulates the osmotic pressure and prevents the cells from accumulating toxic waste and water. The osmotic homeostasis can be achieved by passive ion and water transport across the cell membranes and intracellular spaces, active uptake or excretion of ions and through the production and accumulation of osmolytes. To get insight into the osmoregulation of C. magur we identified the osmoregulatory repertoire in the genome.Aquaporins (Aqps) are a set of small (26–34 kDa) membrane proteins that specifically transport water, glycerol, ammonia, urea and passive ion across the cell membranes. The Aqps in the eukaryotes are mostly classified, based on their sequence characteristics, into four subgroups: (i) classical Aqps (Aqp0, 1, 2, 4 and 5) that only permeate water, (ii) aquaglyceroporins (Aqp3, 7, 9 and 10) that permeate glycerol and urea in addition to water, (iii) Aqp8-type of aquaammoniaporins (Aqp6 and 8) that present low water permeability and have different phylogenetic from the others, and (iv) unorthodox Aqps (Aqp11 and 12) that are highly deviated asparagine-proline-alanine (NPA) motifs and intracellular locations.92 A total of 24 Aqps genes were identified in C. magur, which is higher than the O. latipes, L. oculatus, D. rerio and human, but lower than the euryhaline Atlantic salmon. C. magur has five classical water Aqps, eight aquaglyceroporins, three aquaammoniaporins and two unorthodox Aqps (Supplementary Fig. S3). Claudin and occludin genes belongs to the tight junction protein group and are responsible for regulation of the ion and water flow between the epithelial cells. Invertebrates contain 4–5 claudin genes, while ~20 claudin genes are present in mammalian vertebrates, but the fishes have a large repertoire of claudin genes. The fugu genome contains 56 claudin,93 while goby genome is represented by 40 claudin.94 The C. magur shows expansion in claudin genes and contains 67 claudin genes as well as 6 occludin genes.Fishes also use active ion transport (majority are sodium transporters) through the kidney, intestine and gills to maintain the osmotic balance. There are three mechanisms to support sodium intake, viz. Na+/H+ exchange via the NHE3b protein, Na+/Cl- co-transport via the NCC protein and coupling of Na+ absorption with H+ secretion by a V type H+-ATPase.95 We were able to identify 29 genes for Na+/H+ exchange, 16 Na+-K+-ATPase catalytic alpha subunits and 11 Na+-K+-ATPase regulatory beta subunits in the C. magur genome. The magur shows an expansion in sodium transporter, as compared to D. rerio and Nile tilapia. The Na+/Cl- co-transporter is categorized into three subgroups, viz. KCC, NKCC1 and NKCC2. Majority of the Na+/Cl- co-transporter genes of C. magur falls in the KCC group which was also reported in goby and mudskipper, while D. rerio falls in NKCC1 group (Fig. 9).Phylogenetic tree constructed on the basis of sodium/potassium/chloride co-transporter (NKCC) and potassium/chloride co-transporters (KCC) genes of human and different fish species. C magur possesses more expansions of KCC genes as compared to NKCC1 and NKCC2 genes (shown in grey shade). C magur is depicted in red colour.Phylogenetic tree constructed on the basis of sodium/potassium/chloride co-transporter (NKCC) and potassium/chloride co-transporters (KCC) genes of human and different fish species. C magur possesses more expansions of KCC genes as compared to NKCC1 and NKCC2 genes (shown in grey shade). C magur is depicted in red colour.The fishes produce osmolytes to actively take up and retain water. The euryhaline teleost acclimate high salinity by utilizing cyclic polyol myo-inositol phospholipid, which requires two enzymes, viz. myo-D inositol 3-phosphate synthase (MIPS) and inositol mono-phosphatase (IMPA), for its production. Some fishes are reported to actively produce myo-inositol along with a sodium/myo-inositol co-transporter (SMIT).96 The SMIT transporter is the characteristic feature of the marine fishes,97 whereas it is absent in freshwater fishes. We identified three copies of IMPA, one copy of MIPS and two copies of SMIT in C. magur. The presence of SMIT gene in C. magur may be involved in hypoxic condition.Water balance also depends on the homeostasis of ions. In aquatic habitat, the essential ions are readily available in water, but it is not the case on land and, thus, ion balance is more challenging on land. In aquatic organisms, particularly fishes, the ions are exchanged through gills via ionocytes while the kidney plays a small role in the ion regulation and homeostasis. In amphibious fish, ion exchange is carried out either through cutaneous skin or through kidney, but the branchial elimination is almost absent.6 In a study on amphibious mangrove killifish, which is acclimated to air on a hypersaline surface, the cross section of the skin shows increased ionocyte and the whole-body Na+ level was 30% higher than the control fish.98 Amphibious modulates the rate of ion flux to regulate the ion balance on land. C. magur shows expansion of sodium transporter protein copies, with respect to D. rerio, which may play an important role in ion homeostasis during terrestrial transition. In one study where the marine habitant mudskipper (Periophthalmodon schlosseri) and the freshwater habitant marble goby (Oxyeleotris marmorata) were taken out of water for 6 h, the Ca2+ homeostasis was maintained by a severe decrease in Ca2+ efflux to almost zero.99 In C. magur, a large repertoire of 122 CaSR genes might help in calcium homeostasis. During the course of terrestrial adaptation, the ion regulation is shifted from gills to skin and kidney in case of amphibians, as also observed in C. magur, and to kidney and salt glands in case of bird and reptiles.6Oxygen is a vital source of energy that is involved in aerobic respiration for efficient energy production and harness energy through oxidative phosphorylation. The vertebrates have evolved their own respiratory system which functions as per their habitat. The respiratory organ acts as a regulator which decides the amount of oxygen available for distribution. Some of the air-breathing fishes have developed lungs or a respiratory swim bladder, while others have modified their gills, branchial cavities, skin, pharynx, pneumatic duct or intestine for aerial respiration during their terrestrial habitat.100 In C. magur, the accessory respiratory organ comprises supra-branchial chambers which is located dorsally to the gill cavities and has the respiratory membrane lining, the fan or gill plates and the respiratory tree.The oxygen delivery to the tissue is essential for their energy metabolism. Myoglobin is an oxygen binding protein found in the skeletal and the cardiac muscle and is involved in the delivery of the oxygen to the peripheral tissues. The C. magur showed expansion of myoglobin genes, which may be useful during its frequent exposure to the hypoxic condition or occasional terrestrial migration. In hypoxic condition, myoglobin maintains the supply and demand of the fluctuating oxygen through rapid oxygenation and deoxygenation.66 It also plays a crucial role in protecting the tissues from the reactive oxygen species (ROS) damage.100 In addition, the other oxygen delivery agent haemoglobins also exhibited expansion in C. magur genome.Elastin b gene showed contraction, in terms of copy number, in C. magur, which is a major component reported for neofunctionalization and acquisition of bulbus arteriosus63 which is a respiratory component in aquatic teleost. For terrestrial adaptation, C. magur might have acquired cardiac muscle for air-breathing rather than the aquatic teleost-specific smooth muscle. Thsd7b gene is responsible for vascular development and angiogenic patterning during angiogenesis.101,102  Angpt2b gene, involved in angiogenesis,103 has undergone strong selection in C. magur.Pollution, being a major concern worldwide, has adversely affected human life as well as aquatic flora and fauna. The C. magur also faces a wide range of toxic chemicals not only from aquatic but also from terrestrial habitats along with the drying water bodies. In order to minimize or eliminate the toxic effect of xenobiotic compound, the species has evolved CYP superfamily genes, a member of P450 protein superfamily, which helps in detoxification through metabolism. The C. magur genome comprises 85 complete CYP genes, lower than the D. rerio 94 genes104 but higher than the I. punctatus 61 genes105 and fugu 54 genes.106 The CYP2 gene has undergone expansion in C. magur (36), which is again lesser than the D. rerio (40). C. magur also showed expansion of sult16b genes with respect to other teleosts. These genes play a key role in xenobiotic degradation. Additional information is provided in Supplementary note 2.12.4. ConclusionWe elucidated the draft genome of walking catfish C. magur with the coverage of 94.0% of estimated genome size. The genome provides a comprehensive understanding of evolution of C. magur with respect to other fish species and the genes/gene families which have evolved for environmental and terrestrial adaptations. It is evidenced in present study that the C. magur genome possesses large numbers of unique and species-specific genes that have evolved in due course of evolutionary process and their specific functions support C. magur for living in adverse environmental conditions. The study also reveals that the presence of evolved specific genes/gene families may have facilitated the development of additional capabilities for environmental adaptations particularly in the catfishes. The genome information is a valuable genomic resource for its conservation management and would be a very useful model for studying genes responsible and their molecular mechanism in hypoxia/ammonia tolerance, locomotion, vision, hearing, olfaction, respiration, osmoregulation, anti-microbial substances, metabolic depression, pollutant degradation, antioxidant defence system, etc. not only for this species but also will be very helpful in such studies for other teleosts too.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at DNARES online.The authors are highly grateful to the Director, ICAR-NBFGR, Lucknow, for providing the necessary facilities, moral support and guidance to carry out this work.

Cost reductions in high-throughput sequencing and advances in sequence assembly algorithms have made it possible to create multiple reference genomes along with a catalogue of all forms of genetic variations in plant species with large and complex or polyploid genomes. In this review, we summarize the current approaches to building pan-genomes as an in silico representation of plant sequence diversity and outline relevant methods for their effective utilization in linking structural with phenotypic variation. We propose as future research avenues (i) transcriptomic and epigenomic studies across multiple reference genomes and (ii) the development of user-friendly and feature-rich pan-genome browsers.1. The pan-genome conceptCrop species exhibit extensive phenotypic variation in agronomic characters, such as phenology, yield, metabolite biosynthesis and response to biotic and abiotic stresses. Effective utilization of genetic variation is key to crop improvement to meet future challenges of climate change and evolving pathogens.1–3 DNA sequence polymorphisms are commonly classified into single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), short insertions and deletions (indels) and larger (>50 bp) structural variations (SVs), which comprise presence/absence variants (PAVs) and copy number variants (CNVs) as well as balanced rearrangements, namely inversions and inter/intra-chromosomal translocations.4,5 Capturing the full spectrum of natural SV in a species is challenging. In the past decade, reference genome sequence assemblies and catalogues of sequence diversity were generated for many crop species, among them the major cereal6–9 and legume crops.10,11 These projects assembled genome sequences for a single genotype and detected SNPs and indels from high-throughput sequencing data mapped to the reference genome sequence. Although a single reference genome sequence is the backbone of a genomic infrastructure, it cannot represent the full complement of sequence diversity of a species. Especially challenging are large-structural variants that are difficult to capture by short-read sequencing and reference-based analysis. Nevertheless, several studies have shown that this class of variants can play a vital role in determining agronomic traits,12–15 local adaptation and speciation.16–20The concept of a ‘pan-genome’ refers to the universe of genome sequences existing in a species. Representing each and every sequence variant segregating in the pan-genome is a distant goal. First-generation pan-genome studies commonly aimed at discovering as many structural variants as possible with a diverse, but necessarily limited set of genotypes. Pan-genomic studies have been conducted in various model and crop plants including Arabidopsis thaliana,21,22,Brachypodium distachyon,23,Brassica oleracea,24 tomato,25 rice,26–28 soybean,29 rapeseed,30 wheat31 and barley.32To date, the pan-genome concept has been discussed extensively regarding definitions, approaches, computational challenges and potential applications.33–39 Moreover, the development of computational tools for pan-genome representations and visualizations have already been discussed in detail elsewhere.35,40–42 Here, we review strategies for (i) building pan-genomes from reference-quality genome sequence assemblies, (ii) genotyping SVs discovered in large diversity panels using short-read resequencing and (iii) linking SVs to phenotypes in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We propose transcriptomic and epigenomic studies focusing on accessions with high-quality genome assemblies as well as the development of pan-genome visualization solutions (e.g. web browser) as future research avenue.2. Selecting germplasm for a sequence assemblyThe first step in setting up a pan-genome infrastructure is the selection of a diverse set of representative genotypes for sequence assembly (Fig. 1). The goal is to capture as many genetic variants as possible with a limited panel of genotypes. Genebanks, i.e. national or international germplasm repositories, host hundreds to thousands of accessions of all major crop species, but minor crops might be not as well represented in ex situ collections (http://www.fao.org/3/i1500e/i1500e00.htm). Genome-wide genotypic data for entire genebank collections or representative subsets are crucial to select diverse accessions covering all major germplasm groups in a species. Such genebank genomics studies have been reported recently for barley,43 wheat,44 maize45 and rice.46 Genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS)47 was used to fingerprint more than 20,000 wild and domesticated barleys43 from the German ex situ genebank. Researchers from the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre (CIMMYT) report GBS profiles for 44,624 wheat lines from the breeding programs44,48 as well as DArTseq data for 80,000 wheat accessions from the genebanks of CIMMYT and the International Centre for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas. The genomes of more than 3000 cultivated rice accessions from the International Rice Research Institute genebank were sequenced to generate a digital genebank and a pan-genome.46 There are various approaches for selecting coresets.49 For example, the tool Corehunter50 implements different algorithms operating on genetic distance matrices to maximize diversity, representativeness and/or allelic richness of core sets. Custom selections may also be made from clustering the diversity space as represented by principle component analysis51 or model-based ancestry estimation.52 Pan-genome panels may include domesticated accessions as well as accessions of conspecific wild progenitors or ancestors of polyploid species, e.g. maize and teosinte or wheat and wild emmer and Aegilops tauschii. Crop-wild relatives in the secondary and tertiary gene pools53 may be included to serve as out-groups, e.g. to determine ancestral states for SVs (Fig. 2), or because of their relevance in introgression breeding. In addition to focusing on maximizing representativeness of global diversity in a crop, a pan-genome project may also select genotypes that have played an important role in breeding and genetics such as founder genotypes of breeding programs, parents of experimental populations54 or genotypes amenable to genetic transformation55,56 may be included to maximize the benefits for the research and breeding community. Vice versa, the accessions included in pan-genomic studies are poised to become reference genotypes in future genetic and functional studies by virtue of the genomic resources associated with them.Pan-genome selection and construction. Representative genotypes are chosen from genetically diverse populations based on genome-wide genotypic data for ex situ germplasm collections. Chromosome-scale genome assemblies are built for a small, but representative core set. The pan-genome compartments such as core (i.e. genomic sequences present in all individual of a species) and variable (i.e. sequences found in some/few individuals) are identified from the de novo assemblies.Pan-genome selection and construction.

Alignment vs. assemblyHigh-throughput short-read sequencing on the Illumina platform has been extensively used for plant genome assembly, population genomics and GWAS studies, but it has important drawbacks. The intergenic space in plant genomes is mainly derived from transposable elements (TEs).57 Since Illumina reads are only up to a few hundred basepairs in length, they cannot traverse most repeats, leading to fragmented and incomplete genome assemblies. Similarly, applying short-read sequencing data to detect SVs using read depth or paired-end information (‘split reads’) is prone to errors in very complex regions, such as plant resistance gene loci. Alignment of long (>10 kb) reads to a reference genome can overcome some of these challenges. Still, even with long reads, insertions exceeding the read length, tandem and segmental duplications,58,59 as well as balanced events such as large inversions (>1 Mb),60–62 are challenging to detect from alignments to a single reference genome.3.2. Assembly methodsDe novo assembly of multiple high-quality reference genome sequences and their comparison by pair-wise sequence alignment is arguably the most powerful and accurate approach to detect all types of sequence variant at base-level resolution.62 The progress in genome sequencing and assembly methods in the past two decades has been tremendous. The first approaches at whole-genome assembly, namely hierarchical sequencing of bacterial artificial chromosomes on the Sanger platform could only be implemented by international consortia even for small-sized genomes like Arabidopsis63 or rice.9 The development of high-throughput short-read sequencing first on the 454, then on the Illumina platforms,64 enabled the generation of draft genomes for many plant sequences, including most crops.65,66 But still assembly contiguous genome sequences from short-reads was a complicated and resource-intensive task67,68 and did not scale well to tens to hundreds of genomes. Multiple short-read libraries with various insert sizes were required for scaffolding contig-level assemblies that were often too fragmented to be useful on their own. Complementary approaches such as optical mapping,69 genetic mapping70 and chromosome conformation capture sequencing (Hi-C)71,72 were required to increase sequence contiguity from kilobase-sized contigs to full chromosomes. Long-read sequencing on the PacBio73 and Oxford Nanopore74 platforms have conceptually simplified this approach as assembly of long (> 10 kb) reads result in megabase-sized scaffolds even in complex genomes.75 Yet, the high error rate of long-read sequencing (10–15%) requires substantial computational resource for correction and overlap determination—to a degree that assembly of polyploid plant genome could take months.76 The need for vast computational resource to assemble large (>1 Gb) plant genomes has recently been obviated by the development of accurate long-sequencing on the PacBio platform.77 Repeated read-out of the same DNA fragment by circular consensus sequencing yield reads in the 15–25 kb range with error rate below 1%.76 State-of-the art algorithms (HiCanu78 and hifiasm79) can now assemble human-sized genomes to megabase-scale contiguity within hours on standard compute servers.3.3. Assembly approaches for pan-genomicsWe predict that accurate long-read sequencing is a breakthrough technology that will greatly improve our ability to assemble large and complex, heterozygous or polyploid genomes and to do this in timeframe that enabling scaling to pan-genomes. Highly contiguous and accurate genome assemblies will provide access to regions previously inaccessible to sequence analysis such as centromeres80 or loci involved in response to pathogens.81,82 However, it should also be kept in mind that any genome assembly can contain errors potentially giving rise to spurious SV calls.62,83 Complementary evidence provided by independent mapping approaches, such as optical maps and Hi-C, are needed to validate and correct assemblies to increase confidence in structural variant calls, particularly for reciprocal events such as inversions and translocations.At the time of writing, it is an ambitious, but not unrealistic research goal to generate tens of high-quality reference genomes for large-genome plant species and hundreds of reference genomes for smaller species within the timeframe of 1 year. In plants, whole-genome assembly-based pan-genomes have been reported for rice (number of accessions, n = 16),28,46,84 barley (n = 20),32 wheat (n = 10),31 maize [n = 26; NAM Genomes Project (https://nam-genomes.org)], Brachypodium distachyon (n = 54),23,Glycine soja (n = 7),29,Brassica napus (n = 8)30 and soybean (n = 26).85 Computational method development has focused on fast algorithms for aligning long-reads to reference genomes and reference genomes to each other as well as to call variants from such alignments.38 Likewise, genome assembly software has kept pace with methodological advances in long-read sequencing.78,79 Nevertheless, sequence assembly of complex plant genomes remains challenging: algorithms struggle with resolving multiple haplotypes in heterozygous or autopolyploid genomes.79,86 Assemblies might result in fragmented sequences, produce chimeric contigs joining different haplotypes or ignore alternative haplotypes. Even when haploid genome assemblies can be constructed from rare inbred or haploid genotypes in otherwise outcrossing or polypoid species,87 detecting and phasing heterozygous SVs remains challenging in these species.4. Constructing an in silico representation of the pan-genome4.1. Pan-genome graphsOnce genome sequence assemblies of a diversity panel have been obtained, a common first analysis is to compartmentalize the assembled sequences into the core and the variable genome (Fig. 1). The variable genome comprises sequences that are present in some genotypes, but absent from others. The core genome is present in all individuals of a species and may comprise sequence whose loss is incompatible with proper organismal functioning such as house-keeping genes.88 In bacteria, where the pan-genome concept was developed first,88 the core and variable compartments refer only to gene sequences. As bacterial genomes are small and mainly composed of coding sequence, this approach is correct and straightforward to implement because methods to cluster genes into orthologous groups are well established. In plant and animals, however, a purely gene-based analysis would ignore a large proportion of diversity present in intergenic sequences. As a consequence of the frequent movement of repetitive elements,89 much of the variable component of a plant pan-genome is intergenic and derived from TEs. Since orthologous relationships are hard to establish between copies of TEs in different genotypes, recording all sequence alignments between repetitive elements would result in a data structure of inextricable complexity.Toolkits for the construction, analysis and visualization of graph-based pan-genomes such as vg toolkit,42 minigraph90 the Practical Haplotype Graph91 are under active development.40 As of now, further evaluation and development of heuristics for pruning complex regions is needed before these approaches can be deployed on collections of tens to hundreds of plant genome assemblies in the same standardized and streamlined way as toolkits for SNP genotyping operate on short-read data.92,93 In the meantime, different ad hoc approaches have been devised to focus on low-copy, but not necessarily genic, regions. In rapeseed, a pan-genome sequence was constructed by adding the PAV sequences from multiple individual genomes to one single reference genome.30 In soybean, a graph-based pan-genome construction was performed with non-redundant SVs against a reference genome.854.2. The single-copy pan-genomeRecently in barley, a so-called ‘single-copy pan-genome’ was built by clustering single-copy regions extracted from multiple chromosome-scale sequence assemblies. This work-around enabled quantitative estimates of pan-genome complexity, such as saturation analysis, and provided a reference to derive bi-allelic SV markers for use in association genetics. However, approaches targeting single-copy regions may prove ineffective in polyploids where even highly conserved house-keeping genes occur in multiple copies in the subgenomes. Moreover, as genic regions are under stronger selective pressure and have reduced sequence diversity, gene-based analyses may underestimate pan-genome complexity. For instance, the gene-based pan-genome of soybean reached a plateau with 25 representative accessions,85 but this picture could change entire genomes are considered.5. Genotyping SV in short-read data for association genetics5.1. Need for genotyping SV in larger germplasm panelsDespite continuous methodological advances and cost reductions in the past decade, sequence assembly is still substantially more expensive than resequencing. In large-genome plants species, the size of germplasm panels that can be subjected to de novo sequence assembly may not be large enough for GWAS or population genomic analysis. One possible approach for including structural variants into genetic analysis is the use of linked SNPs as proxies. But, several studies have shown that the rapid decay of linkage disequilibrium can result in many SVs that are not tagged by near-by SNPs.15,94 A further conceptual drawback is that even if linked SNPs can pinpoint loci in association scans, causal variants residing in SVs whose sequence is absent from the reference genome would be inaccessible.5.2. Graph-based methodsLow-coverage whole-genome shotgun sequencing can scale to panels comprising thousands of accessions. Thus, it can complement catalogues of SVs seeded with genome sequence assemblies to discover new, or genotype known events. There are several approaches for genotyping SVs (Fig. 3), which are discovered in a smaller discovery panel, in short-read data for more individuals. One of them is to build variations graphs from SVs discovered in the reference panel (Fig. 3a) and aligning short-reads to the graph.42,95–97 Graph-based SV genotyping requires high read coverage (~10–30X) to achieve good accuracy.42 The advantages of high read depth need to be weighed against larger panel size affording greater statistical power. An alternative approach is to extract defined short sequences (k-mers) that are diagnostic for the presence or absence of SV and whose presence can be confidently ascertained in short (< 300 bp) read data. For instance, multiple short k-mers with lengths typically in the range of 30–100 bp can be extracted from SVs and queried in short-read resequencing data. Multiple k-mers might be combined to increase specificity, mitigate the effects of missing data in low-coverage data and differentiate between different haplotypes sharing the same SV. Choosing k-mers from single- or low-copy regions is needed to avoid unspecific matches (Fig. 3b). Single-copy regions do not only comprise genes, but also non-coding regulatory regions and unique TE insertion sites.98 Thus, they can serve as anchor points for larger haplotypes even in repetitive regions. Presence/absence tables of the diagnostic k-mers act as biallelic marker matrices for use in genetic mapping applications, i.e. GWAS or quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping in biparental populations. As there are fewer SVs than SNPs, commonly used GWAS methods developed for SNP genotyping or sequencing studies (such as GEMMA99 or GAPIT100) are readily applicable. As a proof-of-principle, Jayakodi et al.32 queried single-copy k-mers from structural variants detected in 20 barley assemblies in GBS and WGS data of diversity panels and used a k-mer abundance matrix in GWAS scans for morphological characters with a simple genetic architecture. Song et al.30 used GWAS with PAV-derived markers to identify SVs associated with silique length, seed weight and flowering time in rapeseed.Pan-genome representation and GWAS with SV. (a) A pan-genome graph is constructed from the alignment of chromosome-scale sequence assemblies. This graph represents all types of genetic variants. Sections of the genome are shown as coloured hexagons. Each colour represent one genotypes. SV are represented by different paths through the graph. Tools for constructing and working with pan-genome graphs under active development. Two alternative approaches to capture pan-genomic information in genetic analyses are currently being used. (b) SVs between these genomes are detected from alignments against a common reference genome. Single-copy regions are extracted from the assemblies (mauve colour) and overlapped with SV (orange colour). Single-copy k-mers residing in SVs are extracted and their abundance is ascertained in short-read data from a diversity panel to genotype the underlying SV. (c) Reference-free approaches select k-mers directly from short-read data of a diversity panel without the need of genome assemblies. Matrices of k-mer counts from either single-copy or reference-free approaches are used as markers in GWAS.Pan-genome representation and GWAS with SV.

Matrices of k-mer counts from either single-copy or reference-free approaches are used as markers in GWAS.5.3. Reference-free methodsA conceptually similar k-mer-based approach is reference-free association mapping with k-mer counts determined only from short read data without any sequence assemblies (Fig. 3c). Instead of diagnostic k-mers ascertained from a discovery panel of reference genomes, all k-mers occurring in a collection of short reads are catalogued and their presence/absence in individual genotypes is tabulated. As the number of distinct k-mers is on the order of billions in large plant genomes, a pre-selection of informative markers is needed for GWAS scans that test for significant marker-trait associations with linear models. Two approaches for k-mer-based GWAS in plants have been described. AgRenSeq101 combines resistance (R) gene enrichment sequencing with fast k-mer counting and GWAS scans using general linear models accounting for population structure. Due to the pre-selection of resistance orthologues, AgRenSeq is geared toward the discovery of R genes associated with specific diseases. The kmerGWAS102 pipeline first quantifies k-mers in either whole genome shotgun or reduced representation sequencing data and then selects a prioritized set of k-mers based on a simple and fast statistical test. This smaller set of markers is used in a linear mixed model GWAS accounting for kinship. Both AgRenseq and kmerGWAS do not require a reference genome, but can benefit from it by aligning associated k-mers to it to determine chromosomal locations of GWAS peaks. In the absence of a reference genome or a sequence assembly representing the haplotype of interest, de novo assembly of reads containing k-mers associated with phenotypes may result in complete genes. However, because of the small size of the assembled contigs in the range of 1–10 kb, genomic contextualization is lacking, which could complicate the differentiation between linked and causal variants, in particular, if they reside in intergenic regions for which low-copy informative k-mer may be lacking.As sequence assemblies for more genotypes become available, the pan-genome saturates, that is, the available reference genomes capture most haplotypes segregating at a certain minimum frequency (e.g. 1%) in the population. Then, both reference-agnostic k-mer GWAS followed by aligning peak markers to multiple sequence assemblies and GWAS with diagnostic k-mers tagging pre-defined haplotypes would conceptually converge. Future work should focus on defining best practices for compiling discovery panels (i.e. high-quality reference genomes), choosing sequencing depth and selecting the most appropriate analysis strategies.6. Beyond the pan-genome6.1. Pan-transcriptomesSVs can influence gene expression in various ways, for instance by disrupting gene structures, by altering gene copy number or by changing the composition or positioning of cis-regulatory sequences.59,85,103,104 In addition to changing DNA sequence, SV could affect gene expression by altering epigenomic marks. Unravelling the functional consequences of a given SV, e.g. one associated with an agronomic phenotype, can be challenging. A notable example is a 13 Mb inversion (Inv4m) on maize chromosome 4 that is associated with early flowering.105 Expression analysis in more than 430 RNA samples from near-isogenic lines did not reveal one single variant as a convincing causal candidate. Precise perturbations by gene editing or even flipping the inverted haplotype back to the ancestral configuration are possible,106 but technically demanding, strategies toward understanding how this inversion altered flowering time. Gene expression atlases across the development of a single genotype have been developed in many plant species107,108 and are recognized as valuable community resources that inform about when, where and how strongly a gene is expressed.6.2. Pan-epigenomesIn the same way, we envision that profiling gene expression and epigenomic marks across a set of genotypes for which chromosome-scale reference genome sequences have been assembled will yield pan-transcriptome and pan-epigenome atlases as permanent community resources. Large-scale expression profiling and population-scale epigenomic studies have been done before, but in the absence of multiple sequence assemblies, data were mapped to a single reference. By integrative analysis of matching genomic, transcriptomic and epigenomic data, it will be possible to analyse the co-location of structural variants and epigenomic variants and gene expression differences between accessions. Such data can help prioritize variants in GWAS studies and guide the development of hypothesis for approaches targeting individual variants (Fig. 2). Recent reports have reported first results in these directions: in tomato, almost, half of the SVs detected in a pan-genome constructed from 14 sequence assemblies overlap with genes and/or flanking regulatory sequences and many of them showed subtle, yet significant changes in gene expression.59 In soybean, more than 1,000 SVs were associated with expression changes, notably a candidate gene for iron uptake was identified with RNA-seq evidences.85 Yang et al. reported 207 cis expression QTLs linked to SVs. Among these, 70 were found to form chromatin loops coding genes in Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing.1036.3. BrowsersAs methods for sequence assembly and comparative analyses improve, previously inaccessible genomic variants become amenable to genetic study. An outstanding challenge is to make new and more complex data structures such as non-linear graph-based pan-genomes accessible to researchers and breeders who are inexperienced in using command-line tools. An integrated pan-genome browser capable of representing SNPs and large SVs in multi-reference coordinate system, together with their annotations, accessory transcriptomic and epigenomics datasets, as well as links to germplasm repositories would serve as a one-stop shop for genome analysis. However, before this vision can be realized, many obstacles need to be overcome. Among them are the construction of and sequence alignment to pan-genome graphs (e.g. by using vg42 or minigraph90) as well as merging and consolidating gene annotations across a large and potentially growing number of sequence assemblies.109–111 As a first step in this direction, we propose the implementation of web-based tools to query and analyse multiple chromosome-scale reference genomes in a gene-centric manner. The framework needs to include query forms to retrieve allelic gene sequences from multiple reference genomes, inspect multiple-sequence alignments of alleles of genes or larger haplotypes and query the presence of alleles or haplotypes in a wider set of germplasm.7. Concluding remarks and future perspectivesRecent pan-genomic studies have revealed exciting insights into crop domestication and the genetic basis of agronomic traits. We expect, while the analysis and visualization methods mature, pan-genomics will establish as indispensable component in the genomics toolbox of plant geneticists and breeders. Since workflows for sequence assemblies and association genetics are in place, future studies will extend analysis and visualization methods in population genetics, gene expression and epigenetics to the scale of pan-genomes. We anticipate that pan-genomes will become an essential component in studying the diversity of crops and their wild relatives and in developing efficient concepts for their usage in pre-breeding. Digital genebanks based on sequence-based genotyping are feasible right now.13,43 The long-term goals of having genome assemblies for all genebank accessions112 is still a distant goal, which, however, has just come a bit closer with the recent breakthroughs in assembly methodology.Author contributionsM.J., N.S. and M.M. wrote the paper.
