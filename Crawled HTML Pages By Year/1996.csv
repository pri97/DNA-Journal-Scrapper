"2","10.1093/dnares/3.1.1","An Expression Profile of Active Genes in Cultured Human Keratinocytes","Hiroko Kita,Kousaku Okubo,Kenichi Matsubara","01 February 1996","keratinocyte, gene expression, keratin, gene signature, expression profile, bodymap","An expression profile of genes active in cultured human keratinocytes was obtained by collecting 770 partial sequences froma 3'-directed cDNA library that faithfully represents the mRNA population in the source cells. Ninety-four species composed of 258 clones occurred recurrently, and 512 clones appeared only once. The gene which showed the most abundant expression codes for type I keratin 14, the major keratin that is known to be strongly expressed in the basal layer of the epidermis. Altogether 242 gene species were identified in GenBank, 9.5% of which encode cytoskeletal proteins and 14.5% the components of protein synthesis. Keratin synthesis, the unique property of the keratinocyte, has been measured by elevating the level of transcription of several keratin genes. However, there was no expression of the differentiation markers, type II keratin 1 (K1) or type I keratin 10 (K10), indicating that the cells used for our cDNA library construction were in the pre-differentiation stage. By comparing this expression profile with seven expression profiles fromother tissues/cells, four clones, including a novel clone were tentatively identified as specific to keratinocytes."
"3","10.1093/dnares/3.1.9","Identification of a Novel Human Gene Containing the Tetratricopeptide Repeat Domain from the Down Syndrome Region of Chromosome 21","Miki Ohira,Akira Ootsuyama,Emiko Suzuki,Hitoshi Ichikawa,Naohiko Seki,Takahiro Nagase,Nobuo Nomura,Misao Ohki","01 February 1996","Down syndrome region, exon trapping, direct cDNA library screening, tetratricopeptide repeat"," The Down syndrome (DS) region on chromosome 21, which is responsible for the DS main features, has been defined by analysis of DS patients with partial trisomy 21. Within the DS region, we constructed a 1.6-Mb P1 contig map previously. To isolate gene fragments from the 1.6-Mb region, we performed direct cDNA library screening and exon trapping using the P1 clones and a human fetal brain cDNA library, and obtained 67 cDNA fragments and 52 possible exons. Among them, 23 cDNA fragments and 4 exons were interpreted to be derived from a single gene by localization on P1 clones and by Northern analysis. To obtain the full-length cDNA sequence, longer cDNA clones were further screened from another human cDNA library which was enriched with longer cDNA species. These clones were sequenced and assembled to a sequence of 9045 bp. This transcribed sequence encodes a novel 2025 amino-acid protein containing tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs and therefore the gene was designated as TPRD (a gene containing the TPR motifs on the D own syndrome region). The TPR domain has been found in a certain protein phosphatase and in other proteins involved in the regulation of RNA synthesis or mitosis. The TPRD gene, the novel gene which was proved to be in the 1.6-Mb region and to have the interesting features described above, is a candidate for genes responsible for the DS phenotypes. "

The Coding Sequences of 40 New Genes (KIAA0161-KIAA0200) Deduced by Analysis of cDNA Clones from Human Cell Line KG-1","Takahiro Nagase,Naohiko Seki,Ken-ichi Ishikawa,Ayako Tanaka,Nobuo Nomura","01 February 1996","full-length cDNA sequence, CAG repeat, transcriptional factor, RhoGAP gene family, myeloid cell line KG-1"," As part of our continuing efforts to accumulate information on the coding region of unidentified human genes, we newly determined the sequences of40 cDNA clones of human cell line KG-1 which correspond to relatively long and nearly full-length transcripts, and predicted the coding sequences of the corresponding genes, named KIAA0161 to 0200. The average size ofthe cDNA clones analyzed was approximately 5.0 kb. A computer search of the sequences in public databases indicated that the sequences of 20 genes were unrelated to any reported genes, while the remaining 20 genes carried sequences which show some similarities to known genes. Among the genes in the latter category, KIAA0167 contained a Zn-finger motif with significant structural similarity to that of the yeast transcription factor GCS1 , and KIAA0189 was classified into the RhoGAP gene family. Stretches of typical CAG (Gln) repeats, which were often correlated with genetic disorders, were found in KIAA0181 and KIAA0192. Another novel repeat composed of alternating Arg and Glu was identified in KIAA0182. Northern hybridization analysis demonstrated that 10 genes are expressed in a cell- or tissue-specific manner. "

Although most of their molecular nature has not been unraveled, a potential bend core sequence A 2 N 8 A 2 N 8 A 2 (A/A/A) and its complementary T 2 N 8 T 2 N 8 T 2 (T/T/T) appeared preferentially either in or very close to most of the bend sites, whereas other combinations of A 2 and T 2 dinucleotides, A/T/T + A/A/T, T/T/A + T/A/A and A/T/A + T/A/T, did not. The distances between any two of the core sequences in the entire ß-globin locus showed a strong bias to a length of 701–800 bp and multiples thereof, suggesting that there is periodicity throughout the locus. This bias was not found for other combinations of A 2 and T 2 . Again, this periodicity was identified in many eukaryotic genes, whereas the tendency was absent in mRNAs and prokaryotic as well as viral genomes. "

The amino acid sequence of human AARE subunit deduced from its cDNA nucleotide sequence showed a high degree of identity (91.5%) with both the corresponding proteins from the pig and the rat. The AARE cDNA shows 99.2% identity with a 3.3 kb cDNA transcribed from a locus (DNF15S2) on the short arm of human chromosome 3, whose deletion is associated with small cell lung cancer, taking into consideration that the sequence of the 3.3-kb cDNA previously reported was caused by misreading."

The first step of this method is linearization of a cosmid clone to be packaged, and we previously introduced cleavage at the cos site using <U+03BB>-Terminase, but optimization of the reaction conditions was required for complete digestion because of its instability. In the newly constructed vector, pAT5, the sites of 4 different restriction enzymes, Sse 8387I, Asc I, Fse I and Pme I, each of which recognizes an 8-bp sequence (8-base cutter) were introduced in the vicinity of the cos site. In addition, the species of restriction sites for cloning were increased to broaden its application. The cosmid clone constructed by this new vector could be linearized at one of the 8-base cutter sites which are assumed to rarely occur in the genome, and followed by in vitro packaging, nested deletion clones were successfully prepared.
