Technological improvements to achieve a higher resolution have resulted in the generation of additional microarray platforms encompassing larger numbers of shorter DNA targets (oligonucleotides). Here, we present a novel method to estimate the ability of a microarray to detect genomic copy-number variations of different sizes and types (i.e. deletions or duplications). We applied our method, which is based on statistical power analysis, to four widely used high-density genomic microarray platforms. By doing so, we found that the high-density oligonucleotide platforms are superior to the BAC platform for the genome-wide detection of copy-number variations smaller than 1 Mb. The capacity to reliably detect single copy-number variations below 100 kb, however, appeared to be limited for all platforms tested. In addition, our analysis revealed an unexpected platform-dependent difference in sensitivity to detect a single copy-number loss and a single copy-number gain. These analyses provide a first objective insight into the true capacities and limitations of different genomic microarrays to detect and define DNA copy-number variations.1. IntroductionConceptual and technological developments in molecular cytogenetic techniques are now enhancing the resolution power of conventional chromosome analysis from the megabase to the kilobase level. Array-based comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH), i.e. the application of CGH to an array of genomic fragments such as bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs), has been the method of choice for genome-wide copy-number analysis in the last few years.1,2 The density of the various ‘whole-genome’ BAC clone sets commonly used varies from one clone per Mb3–5 to an overlapping clone set covering the entire human genome with one clone per 100 kb.6,7 Array CGH has rapidly become an important genome analysis tool in cancer research,8–10 in the identification of novel microdeletion syndromes and gene identification studies,11–15 in the diagnosis of patients with congenital malformation syndromes and/or unexplained mental retardation,5,16,17 and in prenatal diagnosis.18,19 Although disease-causing genomic alterations are thought to be rare, recent work using high-resolution microarray approaches has indicated that genomic copy-number variation without immediate phenotypic consequences is widespread throughout the entire human genome.17,20–23Most currently used genomic copy-number profiling microarrays are produced in academic settings, and the resolution of these microarrays varies depending on the type and number of genomic targets selected, the protocols used, and the data-analysis tools employed. Only recently, private enterprises embarked on this novel microarray application, and several companies are now offering microarrays for genomic copy-number profiling. Most of these microarrays encompass 25–85-mer oligonucleotides targeting random genomic sequences24–26 or single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).27–31 The theoretical advantages of using such commercial platforms are numerous: (1) they provide a higher genome coverage than most microarrays generated in academia, (2) they can be produced in large quantities according to industrial quality standards, (3) they are available to all researchers, also those without dedicated microarray facilities, and (4) their widespread use will generate large comparable data sets that facilitate data comparison and cooperation between research groups. At present, however, little is known about the actual performance of these platforms, and first-time users will find limited guidance on which platform is most appropriate for their applications and requirements. Although various platform comparison studies have been reported for microarray-based expression profiling,32–35 as yet a comprehensive platform comparison for genomic profiling, including an adequate statistical power analysis, has not been reported.A prerequisite for a performance comparison of genomic microarrays is the availability of a comprehensive method that accounts for specific requirements associated with genomic microarray data such as adjacency of probes and asymmetric y-axis measurements associated with deletions and/or duplications. Here, we introduce a method that adheres to these requirements, and that is based on statistical power calculations to compare the practical resolution of individual genomic microarray experiments obtained using different microarray platforms. The method is validated using simulated data sets as well as data sets obtained using our in-house tiling-resolution BAC arrays and commercially available 100k SNP, 250k SNP, and 385k oligonucleotide microarray platforms. From our results, we conclude that the increased probe density of the commercially available microarray platforms, although accompanied by a lower signal-to-noise ratio, results in a higher genome-wide copy-number detection resolution.2. Methods2.1. Patients and healthy donorsThe platform comparison was performed using DNA from 13 patients harboring submicroscopic genomic copy-number variations previously identified by tiling-resolution array CGH.17 Genomic DNA was isolated from blood leukocytes by standard procedures. Male and female reference DNA pools previously used for tiling-resolution BAC array analysis were also used for hybridization to the NimbleGen oligonucleotide microarrays. These reference pools contain equal amounts of genomic DNA from 10 healthy donors (males or females). For the Affymetrix SNP oligonucleotide microarray experiments, using single color hybridizations, two male and two female reference pools were used for normalization purposes.2.2. Tiling-resolution BAC array CGHPreviously, we reported an array CGH study17 using a tiling-resolution microarray encompassing 32,447 overlapping BAC clones selected to cover the entire human genome.6,7 Hundred patients with unexplained mental retardation were hybridized in duplicate against a sex-mismatched reference pool to this microarray. On the basis of these hybridizations, we selected 13 patients with validated submicroscopic copy-number variations, both single copy-number gains and losses, for hybridization to the other platforms.2.3. Affymetrix 100k SNP arraysThe Affymetrix 100k SNP array contains 25-mer oligonucleotides representing a total of 116,204 SNPs, distributed over two microarrays. Array experiments were performed according to protocols provided by the manufacturer (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA) as described previously.27 Copy-number estimations were determined using the recently published software package CNAG (Copy Number Analyzer for Affymetrix GeneChip Mapping 100k arrays28). This algorithm strongly improves the signal-to-noise ratios of the copy-number data by (1) accounting for the length and GC content of the polymerase chain reaction products using quadratic regressions and by (2) normalizing the patient samples to reference samples run in parallel.2.4. Affymetrix 250k SNP arraysAffymetrix provides two microarrays each containing approximately 250,000 SNPs, and together forming the 500k assay. For this study, we selected the Nsp 250k SNP array, which contains 262,264 25-mer oligonucleotides. For the 100k SNP array experiments, the 250k SNP array experiments were performed according to protocols provided by the manufacturer (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA). Copy-number estimates were determined using the CNAG software package,28 which was recently updated for the analysis of these arrays (version 2.0).2.5. NimbleGen 385k oligonucleotide arraysThe NimbleGen whole genome oligonucleotide microarray contains 386,165 isothermal probes (45–75-mer), spanning the human genome at a mean probe spacing of 7 kb. Isothermal oligonucleotide design, array fabrication, DNA labeling, CGH experiments, data normalization, and log2(Cy3/Cy5) copy-number ratio calculations were performed by NimbleGen according to published procedures.262.6. Hidden Markov analysisThe normalized ratios were analyzed for loss and gain of regions by a standard Hidden Markov Model (HMM), which was optimized for each of the microarray platforms in order to maximize the detection of the known validated copy-number aberrations, while minimizing the false-positive rate, as described before.172.7. Statistical power analysisFor each of the four microarray platforms, we performed a statistical power analysis of adjacent targets surrounding a specific locus on a chromosome. This revealed the relationship between the genomic length of the copy-number variation, the noise contained in measurements, and, ultimately, the false-positive and false-negative detection rates for the microarray, and thus, provided a platform-independent discrimination statistic describing the ability of a microarray to detect single copy-number variations.The statistical power analysis comprises the following steps: (1) Determination of the distribution of the noise,(2) Establishment of estimates for significant changes and the variance of noise within each experiment,(3) Calculation of the number of data points required for detection of copy-number variations, and(4) Determination of the resolution of a microarray platform.The method assumes a normal distribution of noise within the copy-number data. We used a <U+03C7>2 goodness-of-fit test,36 using a p-value of less than 0.05, and could not reject this hypothesis, thereby justifying the application of the method used for calculating the statistical power.We calculate the number of data points required to detect a genuine single copy-number variation (as estimated by the mean chromosome X values) given the autosomal standard deviation, with a confidence factor determined by the desired statistical power. This is done by determining the number of data points required to lie in the outer regions of the distribution of the copy-number ratios for it to be deemed unusual in terms of the expected (normal) distribution. We use the non-central T cumulative distribution in order to determine the number of sample points required to satisfy the desired power given estimates of significant changes and an estimate of the variance.38,39To calculate the resolution of a microarray platform, the outcome of the power analysis is used in conjunction with the genomic coverage of the platform. The distribution of the microarray probes throughout the genome is determined by the size of the gaps between the microarray targets. For our calculation, we take into account the uneven genomic distribution of the microarray targets and assume that copy-number variations can occur randomly throughout the whole genome. Next, we create a window with size equal to the number of data points required to detect a copy-number variation, as given by the power calculation, and determine the number of instances within the genome where the window has a size less than the size of the variation to be detected. This is compared to the total possible number of windows that occur within the genome. By doing so, we create a genome-wide probability that a copy-number variation with a particular size independent of its genomic location will be detected by a microarray platform. We calculated the resolution for single copy-number variations with genomic sizes ranging from 10 kb to 1 Mb, separately for gains and losses.3. Results3.1. Study designIn this study, we assessed the capacity of various genomic microarray platforms to detect submicroscopic single copy-number variations, including deletions and duplications. We selected samples from 13 patients in which we have previously identified and validated copy-number variations using our in-house produced tiling-resolution 32k BAC arrays.17 These samples were hybridized onto 100k Affymetrix SNP arrays, 250k Affymetrix SNP arrays, and 385k NimbleGen oligonucleotide arrays. As an example, Fig. 1 shows the chromosome profile obtained for the various platforms in a patient with a 0.54-Mb sized deletion at 9q33.1. We applied a standard HMM algorithm to automatically detect copy-number variations onto the different platforms. Next, we developed and tested a novel method based on statistical power analysis for an objective comparison of the detection resolution of the different platforms.Detection of known and validated submicroscopic copy-number variations by high-density BAC, SNP, and oligonucleotide arrays. Individual chromosome plots are shown for Patient 8 (chromosome 9), with the log2 T/R (test-over-reference) values plotted on the y-axis versus the genomic position on chromosome 9 on the x-axis. Results are shown for the tiling-resolution 32k BAC array (A), the 100k SNP array (B), the 250k SNP array (C), and the 385k oligonucleotide array (D). A known and validated microdeletion of 0.54 Mb on 9q33.1 is detected by all four genomic microarray platforms (see black arrow). In addition, a previously undetected microduplication is clearly visible on the chromosome profile obtained by the 250k SNP array (see grey arrow).

This figure also shows the different levels of microarray noise present for the different microarray platforms.3.2. Automatic detection of copy-number aberrations by HMMIn order to obtain independent information on the performance of the different microarray platforms in identifying submicroscopic copy-number variations, we applied a single automated HMM algorithm to the experiments performed in this study (see Table 1). The known and validated copy-number changes were previously identified on the 32k BAC microarray platform,17 and ranged in sizes from 230 kb to 8.9 Mb. Samples from 10 patients were tested on the 385k NimbleGen oligonucleotide microarray platform, and all of the previously identified and validated copy-number variations were detected by the automated HMM algorithm. In contrast, two of the previously identified and validated copy-number variations out of the 13 tested were not automatically detected on the Affymetrix 100k SNP array platform. One of these was a 350 kb deletion on chromosome 7q11.21 (Patient 5), and the other was a 1.65 Mb deletion on chromosome 15q24 (Patient 11). The HMM algorithm correctly detected 10 out of 11 previously identified and validated copy-number variations on the Affymetrix 250k SNP microarray. Again, the 350 kb deletion on 7q11.21 could not be detected automatically, whereas the 1.65 Mb deletion on 15q24 was readily detected on this platform. In addition to the known and validated copy-number variations, a large number of additional copy-number variations was detected but not validated.Detection of known and validated submicroscopic copy-number variations onto high-density BAC, SNP and oligonucleotide microarraysaAll copy-number variations were initially detected by an automated HMM on the 32k BAC array.Detection of known and validated submicroscopic copy-number variations onto high-density BAC, SNP and oligonucleotide microarraysaAll copy-number variations were initially detected by an automated HMM on the 32k BAC array.3.3. Verification of power calculation using simulated dataIn order to verify the power calculation, we created a step function of a single copy-number loss based on our model for an aberration and corrupted it with a noise signal that had a normal distribution to simulate a single copy-number loss (Supplementary Fig. 1A). The results of the power analysis on this data set are displayed in Supplementary Fig. 1B. This analysis shows that a minimum of four data points with log2 ratios outside the normal distribution is required for a single copy-number loss to be detected with the desired power (95%). Subsequently, a Monte Carlo simulation was used to test the behavior of the power calculation. We artificially generated 400 samples of size 4 under the null hypothesis with a mean of 0, and another 400 with a mean resembling a loss, which represents the alternate hypothesis. The results of this analysis are illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 1C, where the null hypothesis converges to the expected 5% and the alternative hypothesis to 95%. This analysis shows that the power calculation is effective in determining the required data points for the successful detection of a copy-number variation.3.4. Power calculation on experimental dataAfter having verified the power calculation, and having confirmed that the distribution of the experimental noise was normal (Supplementary Fig. 2), we applied this method to the experimental data set described above. For each sex-mismatched experiment, we calculated the mean of all unique chromosome X log2 ratios and the standard deviation of the autosomal log2 ratios to provide an initial insight into the performance of each microarray platform and the values to be used in the power calculations (Table 2). The average log2 ratios of these chromosome X targets were similar for the BAC array platform and the Affymetrix SNP array platform (~0.47), whereas the NimbleGen oligonucleotide platform exhibited a lower average of approximately 0.38. The average standard deviation of the log2 ratios of the autosomal targets varied twofold between the different microarray platforms. The 32k BAC platform exhibited the lowest standard deviation, and the 385k NimbleGen oligonucleotide platform the highest. In addition, as all BAC array hybridizations were performed in duplicate, we were able to determine the influence of replicate analyses on the noise level. As can be seen in Table 2, the autosomal standard deviation is reduced by almost 50% after averaging data from two experiments.Signal-to-noise parameters of the four genomic copy-number profiling platformsaMean log2-transformed test-over-reference ratio of the X chromosome, excluding the pseudo-autosomal regions, obtained from calculations in sex-mismatched hybridization experiments. For the BAC and the NimbleGen platforms, data were obtained within each two-color experiment, for the Affymetrix SNP platform, data were combined in silico from different one-color experiments. For this analysis, four reference pool samples (two of each sex) were processed in parallel with the patient samples.bStandard deviation calculated over the log2-transformed test-over-reference ratios for all autosomal targets, excluding the genomic regions known to harbor submicroscopic copy-number variations.Signal-to-noise parameters of the four genomic copy-number profiling platformsaMean log2-transformed test-over-reference ratio of the X chromosome, excluding the pseudo-autosomal regions, obtained from calculations in sex-mismatched hybridization experiments.

An average of four adjacently located BAC clones showing a single copy-number loss provided 95% confidence of representing a true copy-number variation. A similar power for detection of a copy-number loss required, on average, five consecutive SNPs on the 100k platform, four SNPs on the 250k platform, and eight consecutive oligonucleotides on the 385k platform. The reliable detection of a single copy-number gain required more consecutive targets, as could be expected based on the theoretical log2 ratio difference between a single copy-number loss (-1) and gain (0.66). For the 32k BAC and for the 100k and 250k SNP array platforms, this increase was moderate, with one to three additional targets being required, respectively. For the 385k oligonucleotide platform, this increase was considerable, i.e. at least twice as many targets were required for reliable detection of a single copy-number gain (Fig. 2).Result of the power analysis of the four genomic microarray platforms for detection of a single copy-number gain or loss contained by different numbers of consecutive targets. The resulting power for a single copy-number gain (dotted) and a single copy-number loss (line) are displayed for the 32k BAC array platform (A), the 100k SNP array (B), the 250k SNP array (C), and 385k oligonucleotide array platform (D). The increase in number of targets has a varying impact on the resulting power across the four different microarray platforms. In addition, the number of consecutive targets required to detect single copy-number gains differs considerably from the number of targets needed to detect a single copy-number loss, and this difference appears to be platform-dependent.Result of the power analysis of the four genomic microarray platforms for detection of a single copy-number gain or loss contained by different numbers of consecutive targets.

This resulted for each platform in a probability to detect a single copy-number gain or a loss throughout the genome with a size range from 10 kb to 1 Mb and a desired power of 95%. From this analysis, it can be concluded that (1) high-density oligonucleotide/SNP-based platforms are significantly better in detecting copy-number variations below 1 Mb than the BAC array platform, (2) copy-number variations smaller than 100 kb remain difficult to detect even onto these high-density platforms, despite an average target spacing of 7, 12, or 30 kb, and (3) small-sized single copy-number gains are much more difficult to detect than single copy-number losses of the same size.Probability to detect a single copy-number gain or loss with different genomic sizes onto the four platformsThis table combines the results from Table 3 with those of Supplementary Table 2. For this analysis, we used a power of 95%.Probability to detect a single copy-number gain or loss with different genomic sizes onto the four platformsThis table combines the results from Table 3 with those of Supplementary Table 2.

DiscussionWe have developed a novel method for establishing the practical resolution of a genomic microarray to detect copy-number variation and applied this method, based on statistical power analysis, to three commercially available microarray platforms and to our in-house BAC microarray platform. For each platform, we calculated the number of adjacent targets required to reliably detect a single copy-number variation (gain or loss), given the required minimum rate of false-positives and false-negatives. On the basis of this calculation, we determined the probability of detecting copy-number variations of different sizes onto a genomic microarray, taking into account the number and genomic position of all targets on the microarray platform used. This unbiased resolution statistic is an important performance measure for genomic microarray platforms as well as for individual microarray experiments, which had not been established for genomic microarrays before. Previously, the resolution of a genomic microarray could only be judged by the mean spacing of targets, a measure that solely reflects the overall genomic coverage. The results of our power analysis, however, clearly demonstrate that the level of noise and the sensitivity of copy-number measurements co-determine the practical resolution. In addition, our analysis revealed an unexpected platform-dependent difference in sensitivity to detect a single copy-number loss and a single copy-number gain. Accurate performance measures are important for researchers to gage the sensitivity and specificity of individual experiments or different platforms. Also, in a diagnostic setting, where microarray-based genome profiling is rapidly being introduced,17,30 it will be essential to have a robust estimate of the practical resolution of the genome-wide scan.Several platform comparisons have been performed for gene expression microarrays.32–35 The statistical methods described in these studies, however, cannot be used for genomic microarrays as they do not account for various intrinsic aspects of genomic microarrays such as the adjacency of targets and the difference between detecting a single copy-number loss and a single copy-number gain. Several statistical methods have been developed for different aspects of genomic microarray analysis, such as preprocessing (normalization17,28), automatic detection of copy-number variations,40,41 and the analysis of Type I errors across genomic microarrays obtained from multiple experiments and samples.42 Here, we report on a resolution statistic for genomic microarrays that uses an approach based on hypothesis testing and statistical power calculations. The method is based on the following variables: (1) the genomic coverage of the platform, (2) an estimate of the noise in the microarray experiment (the standard deviation of the autosomal targets), (3) an estimate of a single copy-number loss (ratio of the chromosome X unique regions of sex-mismatch experiments),37 and (4) the desired statistical power. The method requires a normal distribution of the noise, which was confirmed by a <U+03C7>2-test, thereby allowing the use of the T distributions. We validated our method using a Monte Carlo technique to simulate the Type I and Type II detection errors for a single copy-number loss, requiring a statistical power of 95%. These simulations were in agreement with the calculated Type I and Type II errors resulting from a two-sided t-test. The calculations yielded the minimal number of required adjacent targets at each locus in order to detect a single copy-number variation, taking into account the required statistical power.36,43 By combining the genomic location of targets with the minimally required sample size, we obtained an objective genome-wide resolution statistic.We used our method to characterize the detection performance of the four genomic microarray platforms using experimental data from 13 samples with submicroscopic copy-number variations hybridized to the different platforms. Automatic copy-number analyses detected the large majority of known submicroscopic copy-number variations on all genomic microarray platforms. Two genomic variations were not detected by the 100k SNP array platform, due to poor SNP coverage for these regions, a problem reported also by others44 (see also Supplementary Fig. 3). This can be reduced by simply adding more targets for these regions. Indeed, one of the two variations was identified automatically by the 250k SNP array. This analysis also revealed considerable and reproducible differences in signal-to-noise ratios between the different platforms. Signal-to-noise ratios were highest for the BAC array platform, which may be due to a more robust hybridization performance of larger genomic fragments as compared to the smaller targets used for the other platforms. The Affymetrix SNP arrays containing only 25-mers, however, showed signal-to-noise ratios which were only slightly lower than the BAC array platform after data normalization using the CNAG package.28 It should be noted that no such data preprocessing was performed for the NimbleGen oligonucleotide platform which displayed the lowest signal-to-noise ratios. This may indicate that preprocessing of the data can have a significant effect on the detection resolution of an individual genomic microarray experiment and argues for a significant effort to be made in this field of genomic microarray data analysis.45 In addition, the noise in a genomic microarray experiment can be significantly reduced using replicate analyses, as was shown for the BAC array platform.The statistical power analysis indicated that, on average, four consecutive BACs are required for the reliable detection of a single copy-number loss, five for the 100k SNP array platform, four for the 250k SNP array platform, and eight consecutive oligonucleotide probes for the NimbleGen 385k oligonucleotide platform. These numbers are markedly different for the detection of single copy-number gains (see Fig. 2). This is caused by the fact that the theoretical ratio of a single copy-number gain (three vs. two copies) is much closer to the random noise level than a single copy-number loss (one vs. two copies). Therefore, it is relatively difficult to discriminate between a true copy-number gain and random experimental noise. This poses a serious problem for those platforms that display a high noise level. The estimate for a single copy-number loss on the NimbleGen oligonucleotide platform is - 0.38 and that for a single copy-number gain is 0.22, within one standard deviation of the mean (0.23 for this platform, see Table 2 and Supplementary Table 1). As a consequence, reliable detection of a single copy-number gain on this platform requires 10 consecutive oligonucleotides more (18) than detection of a single copy-number loss (8). In contrast, the detection of a single copy-number gain on the BAC array platform with the lowest noise level requires only one consecutive clone more (5) than that of a single copy-number loss (4). These results demonstrate the impact of the different detection limits regarding single losses and gains, resulting in more targets being required in the latter case.46 It is important to account for this asymmetric detection limit caused by the different signal-to-noise ratios associated with gains and losses.The commercially available microarrays contain 3 to 12 times as many targets as our tiling-resolution BAC microarray, and this can compensate for the lower signal-to-nose level obtained on these platforms. In addition, the targets on these microarrays are much smaller in size as compared to BAC clones with an average insert size of 170 kb, thereby theoretically allowing the detection of aberrations below 100 kb. Table 4 shows the probability of detecting a single copy-number gain or loss with different genomic sizes onto the four platforms. This table clearly shows that the commercial platforms outperform the BAC array platform for the detection of aberrations below 1 Mb in size. The Affymetrix 250k SNP array appeared most sensitive for the detection of copy-number variations below the 100-kb level, especially for copy-number gains. However, even on this platform, the probability of detecting a single copy-number gain with a genomic size of 50 kb was only 38% (68% for a single copy-number loss). A similar analysis was performed in silico for the 500k SNP array platform by assuming that the 250k Sty array shows a similar sensitivity and noise distribution as the 250k Nsp array used in this study. This calculation indicated for the 500k SNP array that the probability of detecting a single copy-number loss or gain with a genomic size of 50 kb was 87 and 72%, respectively (Supplementary Table 2). This shows that even these high-density platforms will have significant difficulties in detecting single copy-number variations smaller than 100 kb. As stated above, the use of replicate measurements and/or improvements in data preprocessing can significantly improve the sensitivity of the different genomic microarray platforms.Next to performance, many other factors, including the availability and consistency in quality of microarrays over time, the amount and quality of input DNA required, the price, and the access to a microarray facility or service company, may affect the choice for a certain microarray platform. An important advantage of using a widely available commercial platform is that it facilitates data exchange between research groups. In addition, the production of arrays containing more than a hundred thousand targets is not practically achievable for academic groups, especially since most currently available microarray spotters have a practical limitation of ~60,000 spots per slide. An important bonus of using SNP arrays is that it allows genotyping together with CGH. This provides additional information such as copy-number neutral loss-of-heterozygosity. Initial SNP selection against regions with a high frequency of copy-number variation in the population, however, has recently been shown to impact the detection of this specific form of copy-number variation on these platforms.44 Besides Affymetrix and NimbleGen, companies such as Agilent and Illumina have also developed high-density genomic microarrays that can be used for CGH applications.24,31In conclusion, we present a straightforward statistical method for establishing the practical resolution of an individual genomic microarray experiment. Application of this method to different genomic microarray platforms clearly shows that these platforms vary in their capacity to reliably detect copy-number variations of different sizes and different types. This should be taken into account for estimating the practical resolution of a platform to detect genomic copy-number variations.The authors thank Rolph Pfundt, Bert de Vries, and Han Brunner for useful discussions and critical proofreading of the manuscript.

It has been reported that a terrestrial cyanobacterium Nostoc commune, which was stored in a desiccated state for more than 100 years, retained its ability to grow.2,3Nostoc commune cells actively deactivate their photosynthetic systems on sensing water loss,4 and can recover the activities of photosystems I and II readily after rehydration.5Nostoc commune cells produce a large amount of extracellular polysaccharide (EPS), which contributes to the stabilization of the cells during desiccation.6 Light intensity and the availability of combined nitrogen affect the synthesis of soluble EPSs in Nostoc strains.7,8 Despite many studies of the mechanism of desiccation tolerance, the molecular responses of cells to dehydration, desiccation, and rehydration remain unclear.A sigma factor for RNA polymerase is capable of specific promoter recognition and the efficient initiation of transcription. Environmental or developmental signals change gene expression by inducing sigma factors in diverse bacterial species.9 There are two basic families of eubacterial sigma factors based on sequence similarities: the s70 and s54 families. The s70 family is divided into three groups. Group 1 contains the primary sigma factors, which are essential for cell growth. Group 2 contains the sigma factors that are not essential for cell growth, but are similar to the primary sigma factors in the amino acid sequences of their DNA-binding regions. Group 3 includes the sigma factors that are only slightly homologous to groups 1 and 2 in their amino acid sequences. They regulate the transcription of specific regulons expressed in response to changes in environmental or developmental conditions. No sigma factor of the s54 family has been found in the cyanobacteria. Twelve putative sigma factor genes exist in the genome and plasmids in Anabaena sp. PCC 7120.10 However, there have been few reports of the corresponding functions of the sigma factors. sigA, which encodes a primary sigma factor, was isolated and characterized under conditions of nitrogen limitation.11 The transcripts of the sigB and sigC genes, which encode group 2 sigma factors, are detectable under nitrogen-limited conditions.12 However, neither gene is essential for nitrogen fixation or heterocyst differentiation.13 The functions of the group 3 sigma factors of the PCC 7120 strain have not been reported at all.We recently reported a comparative analysis of the differences in gene expression during dehydration between the terrestrial desiccation-tolerant cyanobacterium Nostoc sp. HK-01 and the aquatic cyanobacterium Anabaena PCC 7120.14 The gene expression changes were transient in Anabaena PCC 7120, whereas in Nostoc sp. HK-01, they were maintained or increased until the wet weight decreased to 10% of that before drying. Therefore, we inferred that sigma factors play important roles in gene expression during dehydration, because sigma factors play key roles in the initiation of transcription and gene expression. Here, we analysed the changes in the expression levels of the sigma factor genes in both Nostoc sp. HK-01 and Anabaena PCC 7120 during dehydration. We present significant evidence that sigJ gene plays an important role in desiccation tolerance.2. Materials and methods2.1. Bacterial strains and culture conditionsTransformant cells of Anabaena PCC 7120 were grown in BG11 medium15 at 30 °C under continuous illumination at 30 µE m-2 s-1 provided by fluorescent lamps. Nostoc sp. HK-01 was grown at 30 °C in WK medium16 with 5 mM N-tris-(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-aminoethanesulphonic acid (TES)–NaOH (pH 8.0) under continuous illumination at 30 µE m-2 s-1 provided by fluorescent lamps. Liquid cultures were bubbled with air containing 1% CO2.2.2. Drought stress conditionsA 10-mL portion of cell culture was harvested by filtration on a filter paper at a chlorophyll concentration of 15 µg chlorophyll/mL and dried on a plastic dish in an incubator under light (30 µE m-2 s-1) at 30 °C and 30–40% relative humidity. The cells were cryopreserved when the wet weight had decreased to 50, 30, and 10%, and cells harvested immediately before drying (100% wet weight) were used as the control.2.3. Total RNA preparationTotal RNA was isolated from prepared cells by the hot-phenol method.17 Crude total RNA was treated with 0.1 U/µL DNase I (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan) at 37 °C for 3 h. After phenol–chloroform–isoamyl alcohol extraction and ethanol precipitation, the total RNA was suspended in RNase-free ultrapure water.2.4. Real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reactionAliquots (1 µg) of total RNA were reverse-transcribed with an RNA PCR Kit (Takara Bio). An aliquot (1/20) of the reaction mixture was taken for real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with a set of gene-specific primers (Table 1). Reactions were performed with a DNA Engine Opticon® 2 System (Bio-Rad, CA, USA) using SYBR® Premix Ex Taq™ (Takara Bio) in the presence of 250 nM primers under the following conditions: 1 min at 95 °C, followed by 40 cycles of 5 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C. The fluorescence intensity of the SYBR Green dye was measured after each amplification step. The relative ratios were presented as the means of data from duplicate or triplicate experiments. The primers used were designed using Primer3.18 Each primer for the sigma factors of Anabaena PCC 7120 was designed based on information from CyanoBase. Each specific primer for the sigma factors of Nostoc sp. HK-01 was designed on the basis of partial sequencing data using PCR products amplified with primers based on the conserved DNA sequence of the corresponding gene among Anabaena PCC 7120, Anabaena variabilis ATCC 29413, and Nostoc punctiforme ATCC 29133. Each datum for Nostoc sp. HK-01 was normalized to the value for 16S rRNA. Because the amount of transcript product of the 16S rRNA gene decreases as dehydration progresses in Anabaena PCC 7120, the quantitative determination was based on the amount of total RNA measured with a spectrophotometer. The primers are listed in Table 1. Product identification was confirmed by melting-curve analysis.Primers used in real-time quantitative RT–PCRPrimers used in real-time quantitative RT–PCR2.5. Construction of transformantsThe plasmid used for transformation in this study was based on pRL490, a stable shuttle vector in Anabaena species derived from a hybrid of pBR322 and the plasmid pDU1.19–23 pRL490 contains the tac promoter derived from Escherichia coli, the luxAB genes derived from Vibrio fischeri downstream from the promoter, and a gene conferring resistance to neomycin. The luxAB genes were removed from the plasmid with BamHI restriction endonuclease. The resultant plasmid was named pRL490–luxAB. DNA fragments of the sigJ gene were amplified by PCR with the set of primers 5'-GGATCCATGGCAGCAAGTGAGTCC-3' and 5'-GGATCCCTATGAACCAGTAGGCAT-3' using the genomic DNA of Anabaena PCC 7120 as the template. The primer set was designed to allow the introduction of a BamHI restriction site. The PCR products were cloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cloning of the DNA fragments was verified by DNA sequencing. The fragment digested with BamHI was cloned into the BamHI restriction site of pRL490–luxAB to construct pRHE0277. pRHE0277 was transferred by conjugation into Anabaena PCC 7120 according to Elhai and Wolk24 and the transformant HE0277 was selected for resistance to neomycin. The control transformant P490 was obtained by transferring pRL490–luxAB into Anabaena PCC 7120 as described above.2.6. Test for recovery from desiccationP490 and HE0277 cells grown in liquid culture to stationary phase (OD750 = 3.0 ± 0.3) were filtered on a cellulose acetate membrane filter (Toyo Roshi Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), dried for 10 h under light (30 µE m-2 s-1) at 30 °C and 30–40% relative humidity in an incubator, and stored for 1 week in the dark in the incubator. These dried cells were soaked with BG11 medium for 10 min. After the cell densities were adjusted (OD750 = 1.0, 0.1, and 0.01), the cell solutions were spread on an agar plate with BG11 medium and incubated under continuous light (30 µE m-2 s-1) at 30 °C.2.7. DNA microarray analysisDNA microarray analysis was performed according to Ehira and Ohmori.25 The analysis was conducted using three sets of total RNA samples extracted independently from the cells of P490 and HE0277. The ratio of the transcript level of the HE0277 strain relative to that of P490 strain was calculated from three measurements. Open reading frames (ORFs) whose spots showed signal intensities of more than twice the average intensity were analysed.2.8. Extraction of EPSsCells (OD750 = 3.3 ± 0.3) and culture media were separated by centrifugation. This separation step was repeated three times. The harvested cells were resuspended in 0.05% sodium tetrahydridoborate solution and boiled at 100 °C for 1 h. The polysaccharide contents of the culture media and cell surfaces of the P490 and HE0277 cells were determined by the phenol–sulphuric acid method, using glucose as the standard.263. Results3.1. Sigma factors responsive to drought stressTo determine the relationships of the sigma factors of Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 to those of other cyanobacteria, we aligned the sigma factor amino acid sequences from Anabaena sp. PCC 7120, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942, and A. variabilis (ATCC 29413) and constructed a phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1). Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 has one representative of the group 1 sigma factors, SigA; group 2 sigma factors, SigC, SigD, and SigE; and group 3 sigma factors, SigF, SigG, and SigI. The multiple paralogues of SigB, a group 2 sigma factor, have been classified as SigB (All7615), SigB2 (Alr3800), SigB3 (All7608), and SigB4 (All7179). sigB2 is encoded on the chromosome, whereas sigB, sigB3, and sigB4 are encoded on plasmids. A novel type of group 3 sigma factor was isolated and designated SigJ. Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 possesses a SigJ-type sigma factor, Alr0277, but not SigH-type sigma factor.Phylogenetic analysis of the sigma factors of Anabaena sp. PCC 7120, A. variabilis ATCC 29413, Synechocystis sp.

PCC 6803 from CyanoBase; and the sigma factors of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 from CYORF.We analysed the expression of the sigma factor genes during dehydration in Anabaena PCC 7120 (hereafter Anabaena) and Nostoc sp. HK-01 (hereafter Nostoc) using a real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR) method (Table 2). Anabaena has 12 putative genes for sigma factors on its chromosome and plasmids: nine genes exist on the chromosome and three genes on plasmids. We analysed the expression of the sigA (all5263), sigB2 (alr3800), sigC (all1692), sigD (alr3810), sigE (alr4249), sigF (all3853), sigG (alr3280), and sigJ (alr0277) genes on the chromosome of Anabaena and that of the corresponding genes of Nostoc. No expression of sigB (all7615), sigB3 (all7608), or sigB4 (all7179) was detected before or during dehydration in either species. sigI (all2193), which encodes a probable sigma factor, was not analysed because it is not a common gene in filamentous cyanobacteria. No orthologue exists in the genome of A. variabilis ATCC 29413 or N. punctiforme ATCC 29133. The transcript levels of sigA decreased as dehydration progressed in both Anabaena and Nostoc. However, the transcript level decreased to only about 53% in Anabaena, whereas it decreased to 13% in Nostoc when the wet weight had decreased to 50% of that before dehydration (Table 2).Alteration of sigma factor gene expression during dehydration evaluated by real-time quantitative RT–PCRThe ratio values were obtained by calculating the ratio of the transcript level at each wet weight to the transcript level at the wet weight (100%) immediately before drying. Each datum is an average (±standard deviation) of three independent experiments.Alteration of sigma factor gene expression during dehydration evaluated by real-time quantitative RT–PCRThe ratio values were obtained by calculating the ratio of the transcript level at each wet weight to the transcript level at the wet weight (100%) immediately before drying. Each datum is an average (±standard deviation) of three independent experiments.The transcript levels of several group 2 sigma factors decreased totally as dehydration progressed in Anabaena. The transcript levels of sigC and sigD continued to decrease during dehydration. Transcript levels of sigB2 and sigE finally decreased, although they increased transiently at a wet weight of 50%. Conversely, the transcript levels of group 2 sigma factors increased significantly in Nostoc. The transcript levels of sigB2 and sigC were maintained at approximately twofold higher than the control level until the late stage of dehydration. The transcript levels of sigD and sigE were significantly increased, although transiently, at a wet weight of 30%.In Anabaena, the transcript levels of several group 3 sigma factors did not change until the mid-stage of dehydration and decreased markedly in the late stage of dehydration. In Nostoc, the transcripts of sigF were strongly repressed until the mid-stage of dehydration. The transcript level of sigG was maintained at a level over twofold higher than that of the control in the late stage of dehydration. The transcript level of sigJ increased significantly in the mid-stage of dehydration, and then decreased gradually in the late stage of dehydration. It is noteworthy that among the sigma factor genes, the expression of sigJ was upregulated first when the cells were exposed to drought stress.3.2. Comparison of the transcript levels of each sigma factor in Anabaena and Nostoc during dehydrationThe relative ratios of the transcript levels for each sigma factor in Anabaena and Nostoc were determined during dehydration using real-time quantitative RT–PCR (Table 3). The ratios for sigC, sigE, and sigG transcripts in Nostoc to those in Anabaena were approximately 100-fold, 10-fold, and 30-fold, respectively, at the late stage of dehydration. The relative ratio for sigJ was approximately 120-fold, even before drying, and the maximum ratio was approximately 1550-fold at a wet weight of 30%. The intensive expression of the sigJ gene in Nostoc should positively influence desiccation tolerance.Relative ratios of the transcript level of each sigma factor gene at each wet weight in both Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 and Nostoc sp. HK-01The value was calculated as the ratio of the transcript level of each sigma factor gene in Nostoc sp. HK-01 to its transcript level in Anabaena sp. PCC 7120. Relative ratios are the means of data from two independent experiments.aTranscript levels were very low in both species and the error margins of the calculated values were large.Relative ratios of the transcript level of each sigma factor gene at each wet weight in both Anabaena sp.

Recovery from desiccation of P490 and HE0277 cellsA transformation method for cells of Nostoc sp. HK-01 has not been established. Therefore, we produced clones of the Anabaena cell strain HE0277, which strongly express the Anabaena sigJ gene, and tested their recovery from desiccation based on the facts that the expression of sigJ was the first among the Nostoc sigma factor genes to be upregulated by drought stress and that sigJ transcripts exist more abundantly in Nostoc than in Anabaena. The cell strain transformed with a non-insertional pRL490–luxAB vector was used as the control strain, P490. As the result of Western blotting with anti-SigJ sera, the translation product level of sigJ in HE0277 cells was fourfold higher than the control level (data not shown). The HE0277 cells were better able to recover from the desiccated state than were the control cells (Fig. 2). Therefore, the numbers of colonies formed, as an indicator of recovery from the desiccated state, were determined for both strains when spread on a BG11 agar plate, after cell density was adjusted (OD750 = 0.01). From the results of eight measurements, the number of colonies formed by the HE0277 strain was 3.1-fold higher than that of the P490 strain (data not shown). Thus, the HE0277 cells were more desiccation-tolerant than the P490 cells.Recovery from desiccation of P490 and HE0277 cells. P490 and HE0277 cells were dried as described in Section 2. After the cell densities were adjusted (OD750 = 1.0, 0.1, and 0.01) using BG11 liquid medium, the cell solutions were spread on agar plates with BG11 medium and incubated for 7 days under continuous light (30 µE m-2 s-1) at 30 °C.Recovery from desiccation of P490 and HE0277 cells.

Effects of higher expression of the sigJ gene in AnabaenaThe effects of the elevated expression of the sigJ gene were determined with an Anabaena oligonucleotide microarray. We found that the expression of 112 genes, including sigJ, was upregulated and that the expression of 42 genes was downregulated in HE0277 cells relative to that of P490 cells. Among the upregulated genes, 5% or more of the entire number of genes were included in the categories ‘cell envelope’, ‘photosynthesis and respiration’, ‘transcription and regulatory functions’, and ‘other categories’ (Table 4). The genes encoding probable glycosyl transferase or glucosyl transferase in ‘other categories’ accounted for 14.4% of the total number of upregulated genes. There were no particular features of the downregulated genes (Table 4 and Supplementary Table 1).Functional categories of genes differentially expressed in P490 and HE0277 cell strainsaGene categories were defined according to the CyanoBase database (http://www.kazusa.or.jp/cyano/cyano.html). sigJ is excluded from this table.Functional categories of genes differentially expressed in P490 and HE0277 cell strainsaGene categories were defined according to the CyanoBase database (http://www.kazusa.or.jp/cyano/cyano.html). sigJ is excluded from this table.The details of the upregulated genes in HE0277 cells compared with those in the P490 cells are shown in Table 5. There are two gene clusters upregulated in the HE0277 cells. First, the gene cluster encoding ORFs all4003–asl3998 was uniformly upregulated. The isiA (all4001) encodes the chlorophyll-a-binding protein CP43'. isiB (alr2405), which encodes flavodoxin, an electron carrier that can substitute for iron-rich soluble ferredoxin, was also upregulated.27 Second, the expression of the gene cluster from alr3057 to alr3074 was uniformly upregulated in HE0277 cells. Because the upregulated expression of alr3074 was not statistically significant, it is not included in Table 5. However, the fold value (HE0277/P490) was 1.79 ± 0.27, indicating a tendency to upregulation. This region contains 18 ORFs and is 22.1 kbp long. According to CyanoBase, many genes relating to polysaccharide biosynthesis are included in this cluster.Effects of higher expression of sigJ gene in Anabaena sp.

Analysis of the EPSs of HE0277 and P490 cellsBecause a proportion of the genes were categorized as ‘cell envelope’ encoding, and the number designated glycosyl/glucosyl transferases was comparatively large relative to the entire number of genes upregulated (approximately 20%), we considered that the amount of EPS was increased in HE0277 cells. Each EPS in the P490 and HE0277 cells was collected from the cell surface and liquid culture, and analysed as described in Section 2. Significant differences were detected in the amounts of polysaccharides released into the culture medium, although no difference was detected in the amounts of cell-surface polysaccharides (Table 6). The amount of polysaccharides released by HE0277 cells was as much as 3.2-fold higher than that released by P490 cells.Comparative analysis of EPSs in P490 and HE0277 cell strainsEach datum is an average (±standard deviation) of three independent experiments.EPS, extracellular polysaccharide.Comparative analysis of EPSs in P490 and HE0277 cell strainsEach datum is an average (±standard deviation) of three independent experiments.EPS, extracellular polysaccharide.4. Discussion4.1. Role of sigma factors in drought stressThe expression of the sigA gene was repressed as dehydration progressed in both Anabaena and Nostoc. The sigA product regulates the transcription of a number of housekeeping genes and is principally involved in cell viability. Genes related to photosynthesis, carbon dioxide fixation, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis, transcription, and translation are downregulated under desiccation.28 The transcript level of sigA in Nostoc was strongly repressed at the mid-stage of dehydration (Table 2). It is necessary to stop cell processes during dehydration to conserve the energy needed to survive under desiccation. It is reasonable that Nostoc strictly controls the transcription level of the sigA gene to ensure survival.Expression of the group 3 sigma factor gene, sigJ, was responsive to drought stress at the earliest stage of dehydration in Nostoc. The relative ratio of the number of transcripts of the sigJ gene in Nostoc to that in Anabaena was more than a hundred (Tables 2 and 3). The elevated expression of the sigJ gene must enable the cells of Nostoc to respond to drought stress in a timely manner. The higher expression of the sigJ gene in Anabaena resulted in the upregulation of genes related to polysaccharide biosynthesis (Tables 4 and 5), suggesting that SigJ governs the regulons of EPS biosynthesis. The expression of the gene cluster from alr3057 to alr3074 was upregulated in the HE0277 cells during dehydration, whereas it was downregulated in the desiccation-sensitive Anabaena.28 This gene cluster might be responsible for desiccation tolerance.In the drying phase, cells avoid lysis from hyperosmotic-down shock and protect their DNA, RNA, proteins, and membranes from water stress, oxidative stress, and other stresses.29,30 It was considered that the upregulation of isiA and isiB expression in HE0277 cells, which are induced under conditions of light excess, iron-limited conditions, and oxidative conditions,31–34 is an example for desiccation tolerance. Genes regulated by the group 2 sigma factor RpoS of E. coli and the group 3 sigma factor SigB of Bacillus subtilis, which are general stress-responsive sigma factors, encode various functions that are involved in the prevention and repair of DNA damage, cell morphology, modulation of virulence genes, osmoprotection, thermotolerance, glycogen synthesis, membranes, and the cell envelope.9,35 However, sigJ gene is not the only sigma factor gene that responds to drought stress. Other group 2 or group 3 sigma factor genes of Nostoc are also responsive to drought stress in the late stage of dehydration (Tables 2 and 3). The function of the sigma factors in drought stress seems to differ from that of SigJ. Further analysis of the sigma factors is required to elucidate the desiccation tolerance of Nostoc species.4.2. Significance of exopolysaccharides in desiccation toleranceIn the HE0277 strain, genes putatively concerning polysaccharide biosynthesis were upregulated, and at the same time, polysaccharides were excreted increasingly into the culture medium (Table 6). We investigated the monosaccharidic composition of the released polysaccharides produced by HE0277 and P490 cells. The dried polysaccharides were hydrolysed, neutralized, and desalted, and the monosaccharides were then quantified by high-performance anion-exchange chromatography, as described previously.36 The polysaccharides released by both HE0277 and P490 cells were composed of eight kinds of identified monosaccharides (galactose, glucose, fucose, rhamnose, arabinose, xylose, galacturonic acid, and glucuronic acid) and several unknown monosaccharides (data not shown). No difference in monosaccharidic composition was detected between the HE0277 and P490 strains. The amount of each monosaccharide in the polysaccharides released by HE0277 was two- to threefold greater than that released by P490. Many studies have been carried out to determine the function of EPSs in the capacity of some polysaccharide-producing cyanobacteria to overcome desiccation in the desert.37 It has been proposed that EPSs provide a repository for water, thereby acting as a buffer between cells and the atmosphere, and represent the key component of the mechanism used by cyanobacteria to tolerate desiccation.38 The EPSs of N. commune account for more than 60% of its dry weight.6 The polysaccharides, together with trehalose, may play a key role in dehydration tolerance.39 It has been reported that photosynthetic O2 evolution in EPS-depleted N. commune cells is sensitive to desiccation treatment, whereas that of normal N. commune cells is rapidly recovered after rehydration.40 Because HE0277 cells produced and released polysaccharides in increased amounts (Table 6), the polysaccharides must be a critical factor in desiccation tolerance. The group 3 sigma factor gene sigJ is fundamental to desiccation tolerance. This discovery will expedite our understanding of the mechanism of desiccation tolerance and EPS biosynthesis in cyanobacteria.We have benefited from the excellent technical support of Mr Tsutomu Aohara and Dr Toshihisa Kotake, Saitama University, with the total sugar assay and the determination of monosaccharides.

The paralogous biosynthetic genes were assigned as comprehensively as possible by biochemical experiments, similarity searches, comparison of the gene structures, and phylogenetic analyses. Among the 10 biosynthetic genes investigated, six comprise multigene families, and in many cases they form gene clusters in the chromosomes. Semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase–PCR analyses showed coordinate up-regulation of most of the genes during phytoalexin induction and complex accumulation patterns of the transcripts in different organs. Some paralogous genes exhibited similar expression specificities, suggesting their genetic redundancy. The molecular evolution of the biosynthetic genes is discussed. The results presented here provide reliable annotations of the genes and genetic markers for comparative and functional genomics of leguminous plants.1. IntroductionThe last decade has seen remarkable advances in structural analysis of model plant genomes. The complete whole-genome sequence data of Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa have been published together with the predicted gene structures and annotations,1,2 and the draft genome sequence of a model tree Populus trichocarpa (Torr. & Gray) was recently disclosed.3 Two leguminous plants, Lotus japonicus (Regel) K. Larsen and Medicago truncatula Gaertn., are also subjects of genome sequencing programs.4 The post-sequence functional genomic approaches to legumes will be important to uncover new functions of legume-specific genes and to establish the systems biology of legumes. At present, non-targeted approaches are mainly used for legume functional genomics. The EST macro-array analysis of L. japonicus became available recently.5 Data mining by multivariate analyses of the integrated data of transcriptomics and metabolomics is expected to facilitate our understanding of the physiology of legumes, as is being accomplished with A. thaliana.6 On the other hand, targeted approaches, that is, focusing on the genes of particular families or particular pathways, are practical to assess the functions and structures of individual genes, and thus they will complement the non-targeted ones.The legume-specific 5-deoxyisoflavonoid pathway is one of the targets for functional legume genomics. 5-Deoxyisoflavonoids have two distinctive structural features: the B-ring attached to C-3 of the C-ring and a hydrogen attached to C-5 instead of a B-ring at C-2 and a hydroxyl group at C-5 in general flavonoids. To the best of our knowledge, no 5-deoxyisoflavonoid has been found in any plant other than the Leguminosae. About 95% of isoflavonoids are found in legumes, and 60% of leguminous flavonoids are 5-deoxy series flavonoids.7 Some isoflavonoids, particularly those with pterocarpan and isoflavan skeletons, are typical leguminous phytoalexins active in the defense response against phytopathogenic organisms,8 while an isoflavone (daidzein) functions as a signal molecule toward symbiotic rhizobia to establish nitrogen-fixing root nodules in the soybean.9Vestitol, an isoflavan phytoalexin of Lotus and other leguminous genera, is postulated to be biosynthesized from the phenylpropanoid precursor by a total of 11 enzymes (Fig. 1). The cDNAs encoding 10 of the 11 enzymes have been identified from L. japonicus or other leguminous plants;10–18 the exception is 7,2'-dihydroxy-4'-O-methoxyisoflavanol dehydratase, which has been purified from M. sativa,19 but for which no sequence data is available. We have reported the induction of vestitol accumulation by treatment with reduced glutathione (GSH)20 and the structures and functions of paralogous genes encoding catalytically distinct chalcone isomerase (CHI) isozymes of L. japonicus.21 The findings on the genes for CHI, together with those for dihydroflavonol-4-reductase22 of the general flavonoid pathway and oxidosqualene cyclase23 in the triterpenoid biosynthesis, suggest the functional diversification of the multigene families, due to gene duplication, followed by the accumulation of nucleotide substitutions.21General and legume-specific flavonoid pathways in L. japonicus.

The gene identification was based on a biochemical assay using heterologously expressed enzymes, comparison of the gene structures, and the phylogenetic relationship. The results offer reasonable gene annotations and genetic markers for comparative and functional genomics of legumes, as well as insights into the molecular evolution of the legume-specific biosynthetic genes.2. Materials and methods2.1. Genome structure and genetic mappingGeneration of genomic libraries of L. japonicus (Regel) K. Larsen accession Miyakojima MG-20, sequence strategy, and gene assignment were carried out as described elsewhere.24 The libraries were screened for each gene by the PCR method using primer sets based on the sequences of the cDNAs isolated (Table 1). Putative genes for chalcone synthase (CHS) were in part discovered in the course of the whole-genome sequencing program of L. japonicus.25 Genetic mapping was carried out with the simple sequence repeat markers found in each TAC clone.26Primers used for screening of L. japonicus genome libraries and/or RT–PCR analysisaCommon primer for the amplification of PKR1 and PKR4 cDNAs.bCommon primer for the amplification of PKR5 and PKR6 cDNAs.cCommon primer for the amplification of IFR1 and IFR2 cDNAs.dCommon primer for the amplification of VR1 and VR2 cDNAs.Primers used for screening of L. japonicus genome libraries and/or RT–PCR analysisaCommon primer for the amplification of PKR1 and PKR4 cDNAs.bCommon primer for the amplification of PKR5 and PKR6 cDNAs.cCommon primer for the amplification of IFR1 and IFR2 cDNAs.dCommon primer for the amplification of VR1 and VR2 cDNAs.2.2. Functional characterization of paralogous genesmRNA was isolated from 4-week-old whole plants of L. japonicus accession Gifu B-129 using the Straight A's mRNA isolation system (Novagen, Madison, WI, USA). Single-strand cDNAs were synthesized using Superscript II RNase H- Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA, USA). To amplify the full ORF of 2-hydroxyisoflavanone synthase 2 (IFS2, GenBank accession no. AB279984), a primer set was designed based on the genomic sequence: 5'-AAGATCAAACAAAGCTTATGTTGGTGGAAC-3' and 5'-GAAATCTAGAAGGTTATTTGTGTTGTACTT-3', which included HindIII and XbaI sites (underlined), respectively. The PCR product was cloned into a pT7Blue T-vector (Novagen). EST clones corresponding to polyketide reductase 5 (PKR5, GenBank accession no. AV424286; synonymous with chalcone reductase, CHR) and 2-hydroxyisoflavanone dehydratase (HID, GenBank accession no. AV425769) are in the collection of Kazusa DNA Research Institute. The construction of expression vectors, heterologous expression, and in vitro assays of IFS and HID have been described previously.13,27 The PKR activity was tested by assaying 6'-deoxychalcone synthase activity as described previously,28 except that the CHS source was the enzyme solution prepared from recombinant Escherichia coli cells expressing a cDNA for CHS obtained from licorice, instead of plant cell-free extracts.2.3. Semi-quantitative RT–PCRTo analyze the expression patterns of each paralogous gene in GSH-treated seedlings and various organs, specific primers were designed (Table 1). mRNA isolation from L. japonicus Gifu B-129 and first-strand cDNA synthesis were performed as described previously.20,22 The absence of contamination with genomic DNA in the cDNA samples was confirmed by PCR with a primer set designed to overlap one of the exon–intron junctions of the isoflavone reductase 1 (IFR1) gene. The quantity of each template was adjusted to give roughly equal amplification of ß-tubulin cDNA. RT (reverse transcriptase)–PCR was carried out with 0.5 pmol of each specific primer using ExTaq DNA polymerase (Takara-Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan) in a final volume of 20 µl according to the manufacturer's protocol. The products (5 µl) were separated on 1.2% (w/v) agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide.2.4. Construction of phylogenetic treeNeighbor-joining trees were generated from the results of 1000 bootstrap replicates using the CLUSTAL W program29 of the DNA Data Bank of Japan (Shizuoka, Japan). The phylogenetic trees were displayed by NJplot software.30A CHS phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the coding sequences of CHSs and plant polyketide synthases, i.e. acridone synthase, bibenzyl synthase, and stilbene synthase. GenBank accession numbers for the nucleotide sequences of polyketide synthases are Antirrhinum majus CHS (X03710), Arabidopsis thaliana CHS (M20308), Camellia sinensis CHS1 (D26593), Cicer arietinum CHS (AJ012690), Daucus carota CHS2 (AJ006780), Gerbera hybrida CHS1 (Z38096), Glycine max CHS2 (X65636), G. max CHS3 (X53958), G. max CHS4 (X52097), G. max CHS5 (L07647), G. max CHS6 (L03352), G. max CHS7 (M98871), G. max CHS8 (AY237728), Malus x domestica CHS1 (DQ026297), Ipomoea purpurea CHSA (U15946), I. purpurea CHSB (U15947), Lycopersicon esculentum CHS1 (X55194), L. esculentum CHS2 (X55195), Medicago sativa CHS1 (L02901), M. sativa CHS2 (L02902), M. sativa CHS4 (L02903), M. sativa CHS8 (L02904), M. sativa CHS9 (L02905), M. sativa CHS12-1 (U01021), Perilla frutescens CHS (AB002815), Petunia x hybrida CHS (AF233638), Phalaenopsis sp. bibenzyl synthase (X79903), Pinus strobus CHS (AJ004800), P. sylvestris bibenzyl synthase (X60753), P. strobus stilbene synthase (Z46914), Pisum sativum CHS2 (X63334), Pueraria lobata CHS (D10223), Ruta graveolens acridone synthase (Z34088), Trifolium subterraneum CHS1 (M91193), T. subterraneum CHS2 (M91194), T. subterraneum CHS3 (L24515), T. subterraneum CHS5 (L24517), T. subterraneum CHS6 (M91195), Vitis stilbene synthase (S63221), and Vitis vinifera CHS (X75969).A phylogenetic tree of PKR cDNAs was constructed based on the 384 bp region from the initiation codon of aldo/keto reductase (AKR) and PKR/CHR, because full-length ORF sequences of EST clones were unavailable. GenBank accession numbers for the nucleotide sequences used for the construction of a PKR phylogenetic tree are A. thaliana AKR (NM104687), Fragaria x ananassa AKR (AY703448), G. max PKR (X55730), G. max PKR-like (BG882535), Glycyrrhiza echinata PKR (D83718), Glycyrrhiza glabra PKR2 (D86559), Hydrangea macrophylla AKR (AY382665), M. sativa CHR (X82368), M. truncatula PKR-like (TC100399), Papaver somniferum codeinone reductase (AF108435), P. lobata CHR (AF462632), Oryza sativa AKR (XM462652), and Sesbania rostrata CHR (AJ223291).A phylogenetic tree of the genes for short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) was constructed based on full-length ORFs of IFR, leucoanthocyanidin reductase, phenylcoumaran benzylic ether reductase (PCBER), pinoresinol–lariciresinol reductase (PLR), and pterocarpan reductase (PTR). GenBank accession numbers for the nucleotide sequences of these are C. arietinum IFR (X60755), Desmodium uncinatum leucoanthocyanidin reductase (AJ550154), Forsythia x intermedia PLR (U81158), G. max IFR (AJ003245), M. sativa IFR (X58078), M. truncatula IFR (AF277052), Pinus taeda PCBER (AF242490), P. sativum IFR (S72472), Populus trichocarpa PCBER (AJ132262), Tsuga heterophylla PLR1 (AF242501), T. heterophylla PLR2 (AF242502), Thuja plicata PLR1 (AF242503), T. plicata PLR2 (AF242504), T. plicata PLR3 (AF242505), and T. plicata PLR4 (AF242506).3. Results3.1. Assignment of legume-specific 5-deoxyisoflavonoid genesThe structural genes involved in vestitol biosynthesis except for CHS genes were found in the genomic clones isolated by PCR-based screening of L. japonicus genome libraries.24 Some of the CHS genes had already been reported,25 and, in the present study, the other paralogous genes were discovered in the genomic sequences obtained in the course of the whole-genome sequencing program of this plant.24 The chromosomal localization and accession numbers of all genes identified are summarized in Table 2. Those that have been functionally characterized before are PKR1, CHI1, CHI3, IFS1, 2,7,4'-trihydroxyisoflavanone 4'-O-methyltransferase (HI4'OMT), isoflavone 2'-hydroxylase (I2'H), and PTR1-PTR4.11–13,20,31 The genes for PKR5, HID, and another IFS (IFS2) were functionally assigned in this study by in vitro assays using the heterologously expressed proteins (Supplementary Fig. S1). The other paralogous genes and putative genes for CHS, IFR, and vestitone reductase (VR) were assigned based on the sequence similarity to those identified from other plants, the resemblance of exon/intron structures, and the phylogenetic relationship of the predicted coding sequences as described in what follows. IFS1, I2'H, and IFR1 correspond to the previously reported cDNAs, LjCYP-1, LjCYP-2, and LjIFR, respectively.20Summary of genes involved in vestitol biosynthesis of L. japonicusn.d., not determined.aEST clones.bPositions of PTR1-3 genes have not been determined due to the high number of repeated sequences in LjT44D07.Summary of genes involved in vestitol biosynthesis of L. japonicusn.d., not determined.aEST clones.bPositions of PTR1-3 genes have not been determined due to the high number of repeated sequences in LjT44D07.3.2. Structures of isoflavonoid biosynthetic genesStructural analysis of putative CHS genes of L. japonicus revealed 13 paralogs, named CHS1–CHS13 (Fig. 2A). Two clusters, composed of three (CHS4, CHS5, and CHS6) and five (CHS7, CHS8, CHS9, CHS10, and CHS11) genes, respectively, are found on chromosome II. CHS9 should be a pseudogene because the initiation codon (ATG) is changed to ATA by a transition. The other five CHS genes, CHS1 to CHS3, CHS12 and CHS13, are separately located on chromosome I, III, and VI, respectively. The structure of the CHS genes is highly conserved: all the CHS genes are composed of two exons, i.e. the first exon (178 bp) and second exon (992 bp), except for CHS1, which has a second exon of 998 bp.Structures of genes encoding enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of 5-deoxyisoflavonids in L. japonicus genome.

The figures show only the structural features and relative lengths of exon (black boxes) and intron (white boxes) sequences of each gene, not distances between the genes.Four PKR genes, PKR1–PKR4, compose a cluster in a 50 kb region of a genomic clone LjT38O12 mapped in the south end of chromosome II in accession Miyakojima MG-20 and chromosome I in accession Gifu B-129 (Fig. 2B), which is known as the reciprocal translocated region.26 They are composed of three exons, and the lengths of the first (323 bp) and second (244 bp) exons are conserved. The first exon of PKR3 contains ca. 5.3 kb sequence in which a terminal-repeat retrotransposon in miniature-like sequence is found, and thus PKR3 should be a pseudogene. The coding sequences of PKR1, PKR2, and PKR4 are more than 90% identical to each other. Two additional PKR genes, PKR5, and PKR6, are found in LjT10F22a, whose chromosome location is unknown. PKR5 and PKR6 are composed of four exons, and the corresponding exons of the two genes are identical in length.The IFS1 gene encoding CYP93C1720 is found in LjT24P23, and IFS2 and IFS3 are located in LjT46B17 (Fig. 2C). The map position of LjT24P23 has not been clarified because no linkage marker was found in LjT24P23.The multiple alignments of the IFS sequences revealed insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphisms among the IFS genes. Fig. 3 shows the alignments of a partial nucleotide (A) and amino acid (B) sequences of IFS from L. japonicus (IFS1–IFS3) together with two genes for functionally identified IFS, CYP93C2 of Glycyrrhiza echinata18 and CYP93C1v2 of Glycine max.17 The cladistic relationships of the IFS genes were elucidated using the I/D polymorphisms (Fig. 3C), demonstrating that the IFS3 of L. japonicus is the most derived. In IFS3, a frame shift is caused by a 4-bp insertion at 1217, and a non-sense codon (TGA) is formed next to His427 (asterisk in Fig. 3B). The heme-binding amino acid residue, which is critical for the activity of cytochrome P450, was predicted to be Cys445 in IFS1 and Cys449 in IFS2, but is lacking in IFS3. IFS3 is thus considered to be a pseudogene. On the other hand, the 3- or 12-base deletions found in IFS1, IFS2, and CYP93C2 at the other sites cause no frameshift, and the amino acid residues encoded by deletion sites are probably unessential.The I/D polymorphisms in IFS genes of L. japonicus (IFS1–IFS3), Glycyrrhiza echinata (Genbank accession no.

The synapomorphic character state is indicated at each internode of (C).HI4'OMT catalyzes the reaction step next to IFS. The HI4'OMT gene is found in the same clone as IFS1 (LjT24P23), although the detailed organization of the genes has not been clarified (Fig. 2C). It is noteworthy that a cluster contains non-homologous genes encoding different enzymes of sequential reactions in the same pathway. Similar gene organizations and the implications for the evolution of metabolic diversity have also been reported.32,33The genes for HID and I2'H (CYP81E6) are located in LjB01D01 (chromosome location unknown) and LjT07D18 on chromosome IV, respectively (Fig. 2D and E). The deduced amino acid sequence of L. japonicus HID showed 75.1% identity to G. echinata HID and possesses both an oxyanion hole and catalytic triad, which are characteristic structures of the active site in the carboxylesterase family.13 Further inspection of LjB01D01 revealed two carboxylesterase-like genes in the adjacent region. The deduced amino acid sequence of one of these genes is only 52.3% identical to L. japonicus HID, and thus it is not expected that this protein has HID activity. The other one is possibly a pseudogene, because no complete ORF was predicted.DNA gel blot analyses that detected homologous sequences with > 80% identity suggest that L. japonicus has single copies of HI4'OMT and HID (Supplementary Fig. S2) as well as I2'H.20Putative IFR genes (IFR1 and IFR2) are located in a ca. 7 kb region of LjT32H22 mapped on chromosome IV (Fig. 2F). The structures of the two genes are highly similar: all the exons and introns are exactly the same in length, and the nucleotide sequences between the initiation and termination codons, including both exons and introns, are 99.7% identical. On the other hand, the identities of the 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions are less than 50%. Another IFR-like sequence was found ca. 18 kb distant from IFR2 but is not thought to be IFR because of the low sequence identity (ca. 60%).Two putative VR genes (VR1 and VR2) are within ca. 17 kb in a contig comprised of LjT43J18 and LjB20B09 mapped on chromosome I (Fig. 2G). Another VR-like gene (VR3) is at ca. 10 kb from VR2, but it is judged to be a pseudogene because it lacks an initiation codon.Four genes are shown to encode PTR.12 Three of these, PTR1–PTR3, are located within a 15 kb region in LjT44D07 on chromosome III, and a reductase-like gene is also found in the same clone (Fig. 2H). Because of the high number of repeated sequences in LjT44D07, the nucleotide sequence of the clone has been deposited in the database as a draft sequence. The positions of PTR1, PTR2, and PTR3 genes described in Table 2 are based on the draft sequence. PTR4 gene is located in LjT37D14 on chromosome I. The PTR1–PTR3 genes are composed of five exons, but PTR4 has four. Their exon lengths are not conserved (Fig. 2H). The identities of the deduced amino acid sequences of the four PTRs are 60–67%.3.3. Phylogenetic analysesCHS and PKR are members of plant polyketide synthase and aldo/keto reductase superfamilies, respectively. IFR and PTR are in the SDR family, which includes two enzymes of the lignan pathway, PCBER and PLR. The phylogenetic relationships of the orthologous and paralogous genes related to CHS, PKR, IFR, and PTR were investigated based on the coding sequences (Fig. 4).Phylogenetic trees of CHSs (A), PKRs (B), and the SDR family including IFRs and PTRs (C), constructed by the neighbor-joining method. The bootstrap replicates were 1000 (values over 500 are given at the nodes). Phalaenopsis sp. bibenzyl synthase, P. stipitis xylose reductase, and D. uncinatum leucoanthocyanidin reductase were used as an outgroup to root the trees of CHSs, PKRs, and the SDR family, respectively.Phylogenetic trees of CHSs (A), PKRs (B), and the SDR family including IFRs and PTRs (C), constructed by the neighbor-joining method.

Phalaenopsis sp. bibenzyl synthase, P. stipitis xylose reductase, and D. uncinatum leucoanthocyanidin reductase were used as an outgroup to root the trees of CHSs, PKRs, and the SDR family, respectively.Most of the established and putative CHS genes of L. japonicus and other leguminous CHS genes constituted a monophyletic group (Fig. 4A). The topology of the legume-specific clade was consistent with the phylogeny of Papilionoideae.34 It is thus likely that the duplication processes that generated the paralogous CHS genes in L. japonicus occurred after the divergence of the legume clades. The phylogenetic tree also suggests the existence of a non-leguminous type of CHS, CHS1, of L. japonicus (Fig. 4A), but the origin and actual catalytic function of the CHS1 protein are unknown.The PKR genes of legumes fell into two subclades (Fig. 4B). PKR1, PKR2, and PKR4 of L. japonicus were grouped with PKR/CHR genes of other legumes previously identified, whereas PKR5 and PKR6 were in another branch with several genes of G. max and M. truncatula annotated as ‘CHR-like’. Because PKR5 showed catalytic activity, as described earlier, it is possible that other CHR-like genes in this clade may encode active PKR. In the evolutionary processes, the ancestral PKR was possibly duplicated once before the speciation of Papilionoideae, and the subsequent duplication caused the paralogous genes in the two subclades.A recent study showed that four reductases of L. japonicus, which are significantly similar to IFR, PCBER, and PLR, have PTR activity.12 The phylogenetic tree of these reductases showed that the PTR genes of L. japonicus (PTR1–PTR4) constitute a monophyletic clade with the PCBER of Populus trichocarpa (Fig. 4C). The putative IFRs of L. japonicus were likely to encode active IFR proteins because they were positioned in a monophyletic clade with other functionally characterized IFR genes. Both PCBER and PLR are involved in lignan biosynthesis, but the PTR/PCBER clade is closer to the IFR clade than the PLR clade. No orthologous gene similar to PCBER or PLR has so far been found in L. japonicus.3.4. Expression of vestitol biosynthesis genesWe previously showed that treatment of L. japonicus seedlings with GSH induced the production of vestitol and the accumulation of transcripts from type II CHIs, CHI1 and CHI3, and I2'H genes.20,21 To examine the expression of each paralogous gene in GSH-treated seedlings comprehensively, semi-quantitative RT–PCR analysis was performed. Among the 17 genes examined, the transcripts of 11 genes, i.e. PKR1, PKR2, PKR6, IFS1, IFS2, HI4'OMT, HID, IFR1, IFR2, VR2 and PTR3, were markedly elevated 10 h after GSH treatment (Fig. 5A). A slight increase of PKR4 and VR1 transcripts during 10 h of elicitation and their decrease in 20 h after GSH treatment were also obvious. In contrast, those of PKR5, PTR1, PTR2, and PTR4 were constitutively expressed and not substantially affected by GSH.Accumulation of transcripts encoded by the vestitol biosynthetic genes in L. japonicus. mRNA was isolated from 4-day-old seedlings at 10 and 20 h after the GSH treatment or at 10 h after H2O treatment (A) or from flowers (F), stems (S), leaves (L), roots (R), and nodules (N) of 8-week-old L. japonicus plant (B). Amplification of ß-tubulin served as a control to adjust the amount of PCR template DNA.Accumulation of transcripts encoded by the vestitol biosynthetic genes in L. japonicus. mRNA was isolated from 4-day-old seedlings at 10 and 20 h after the GSH treatment or at 10 h after H2O treatment (A) or from flowers (F), stems (S), leaves (L), roots (R), and nodules (N) of 8-week-old L. japonicus plant (B). Amplification of ß-tubulin served as a control to adjust the amount of PCR template DNA.The RT–PCR analysis also showed that transcripts of the genes were detectable in almost all tissues investigated. The expression patterns were rather complex, but some genes clearly showed organ specificity (Fig. 5B). Characteristically, no transcripts of any PKR paralogs, HID, I2'H, IFR1, VR2, and PTR2 genes in flowers were observed, and neither the transcripts of PTR paralogs in nodules. The PKR transcripts were accumulated in both aerial (stems and leaves) and underground (roots and nodules) parts, but the expression level of PKR paralogs was higher in underground parts. In contrast, the expression of all PTR genes was mainly observed in aerial parts, and only the PTR4 transcript was detected in roots. Also, the expression of some paralogous genes was different among the organs: e.g. IFS1 was expressed in all organs, whereas IFS2 was highly expressed in leaves and weakly in underground parts; and the expression of VR1 was ubiquitous in all tissues investigated, but expression of VR2 was limited to leaves, roots, and stems. On the other hand, the expression patterns of paralogous genes, such as CHI1 and CHI3 and PKR1 and PKR2, were almost the same, suggesting their functional redundancy.4. DiscussionStructural analysis of the genes involved in the legume-specific 5-deoxyisoflavonoid biosynthesis of L. japonicus revealed that six genes of the 10 investigated compose multigene families and form gene clusters in many cases. The origin of multigene families is attributed to gene duplication. The paralogous genes of L. japonicus involved in the flavonoid and triterpenoid biosynthesis were suggested to have acquired new functions different from the ancestral types as the result of accumulated nucleotide substitutions during their molecular evolution.21–23 The gene cluster of HID and carboxylesterase-like genes (Fig. 2D) also implies the evolution of HID through local gene duplication of an ancestral carboxylesterase-like gene. These findings support the idea that gene duplication is a major driving force for the evolution of novel metabolic pathways.35–37 Considering that enzymes with new functions might have been established through such evolutionary processes, we expected that candidates for enzymes and genes could be narrowed down by the combination of the predicted reaction mode of the target enzyme and the phylogenetic relationship. Actually, the genes for PTR were found in the SDR family, which includes PCBER, IFR, and PLR.12 The phylogenetic tree implies that PTR genes should have been derived from the ancestral PCBER genes (Fig. 4C).We present a comprehensive expression analysis of the genes involved in 5-deoxyisoflavonoid biosynthesis. Together with the previous finding on the GSH-induced transcription of type II CHI and I2'H genes,20,21 all single genes and most of the paralogous genes encoding the biosynthetic enzymes as far as identified were shown to be synchronously up-regulated by the GSH treatment (Fig. 5A), which has been thought to mimic the signal of defense response, guaranteeing the elicitor responsive synthesis of vestitol. The coordinate increase of the transcripts suggests a common set of transcription factors involved in the regulation of this pathway, and the GSH-treatment will serve as a potential experimental system to analyze the transcriptional regulation of the 5-deoxyisoflavonoid genes. Although no significant cis elements common to the GSH-dependent genes has been predicted by in silico analysis, they will be obtained by further experiments of promoter analysis and used to identify the corresponding transcription factors. An interesting observation is the constitutive expression of PTR paralogs, except for PTR3, which was apparently up-regulated on GSH treatment. The role of PTR3 in vestitol biosynthesis has been considered to be insignificant, because it possesses low specific activity and no enantiospecificity.12 If the final step of vestitol synthesis is performed by enantiospecific PTR1 and PTR2 with high specific activity, this step is out of the regulation asserted by elicitor and not a rate-limiting step of phytoalexin biosynthesis.The semiquantitative RT–PCR analyses also revealed the organ specific expression of each paralogous gene (Fig. 5B). Weak or no expression of PTR paralogs and the high expression levels of the other up-stream genes in underground parts imply that 5-deoxyisoflavonoids may be produced in symbiotic roots and nodules. Functions of flavonoids as positive and negative regulators in nodule development have been discussed.38 The observation that transcripts of some genes, i.e. PKR paralogs and HID, were not detected in flowers may conform the notion that the normal L. japonicus flower tissue producing flavonols and anthocyanins does not synthesize 5-deoxyisoflavonoids. However, the expression of genes may not simply reflect the flavonoid compositions, and more detailed and comprehensive examination of the transcripts and metabolites of the 5-deoxyisoflavonid pathway in specific tissues and cells and during nodule organogenesis would be expected in the future.On the other hand, the nearly identical expression patterns of some paralogous genes, such as PKR1 and PKR2, and CHIs (Fig. 5B), strongly suggested that these paralogous genes are functionally redundant. They are likely to have been maintained during the legume evolution under selection pressure. A previously presented genetic model on the molecular evolution of genes showed that genetic redundancy is common in some cases, contrary to the widespread view that a redundant gene would be abolished by accumulated deleterious mutations.39 According to the model, redundant genes can be stable, provided they have pleiotropic functions or they are expressed in specific spatiotemporal patterns. Our expression analysis showed that some duplicated genes, e.g. PKR4, IFS2, VR2, PTR3, and PTR4, have acquired different expression patterns (Fig. 5A and B). IFS paralogs of soybean were also reported to show different expression patterns in different tissues, and in response to nodulation and defense signal. Alternatively, one of the two completely redundant genes will become extinct, but it may take a long time, provided that the mutation rates of the two genes are not very different.39The fact that the legume-specific 5-deoxyisoflavonoid pathway is at present widely distributed among Papilionoideae strongly suggests its substantial contributions to the fitness of leguminous plants, that is, 5-deoxyisoflavonoids have significant ecological and physiological functions. The roles of the individual biosynthetic genes will be clarified in part by dissection of the spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression and the distribution of 5-deoxyisoflavonoids, namely, by transcriptomics and metabolomics. In general, these ‘-omics’ approaches are profoundly dependent on gene annotations. The results of this study provide the correct annotations for the legume-specific 5-deoxyisoflavonoid genes. On the other hand, reverse genetic approaches such as RNA interference or TILLING will enable us to test the significance of a gene, a biosynthetic step, or a pathway. RNA interference is applicable to redundant genes if the consensus sequences common to all the paralogous genes are known;40,41 single genes, e.g. HI4'OMT, HID, and I2'H of L. japonicus, can be the targets for knocking out by TILLING. The present study will also offer useful information for these functional genomic studies of leguminous plants.This work was supported by the 21st Century COE program ‘Bioresource Utilization Based on Microbial Symbiotic Systems’ of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and the project ‘Development of Fundamental Technologies for Controlling the Material Production Process of Plants’ of the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization.

We have developed a new database that contains 52 845 polymorphic MS loci between indica and japonica, composed of ample Class II MS markers, and integrated 18 828 MS loci from IRGSP and genetic markers from RGP. Based on genetic marker positions on the rice genome (http://rise.genomics.org.cn/rice2/index.jsp ), we determined the approximate genetic distances of these MS loci and validated 100 randomly selected markers experimentally with 90% success rate. In addition, we recorded polymorphic MS positions in indica cv. 9311 that is the most important paternal parent of the two-line hybrid rice in China. Our database will undoubtedly facilitate the application of MS markers in genetic researches and marker-assisted breeding. The data set is freely available from www.wigs.zju.edu.cn/achievment/polySSR.1. IntroductionMicrosatellites (MSs), or simple sequence repeats (SSRs), are short consecutive repetitive DNA sequence motifs with 1–6 bp in length. The frequency and distribution of MSs have been studied in detail in genomes of bacteria,1 animals,2 and plants.3 MSs have become a valuable source of molecular markers, widely used in genetic diversity analysis4 and positional cloning in rice5,6 because of their ubiquity and polymorphism.7Starting with screening genomic DNA libraries with MS probes,8,9 many investigators have been involved in generating new MS markers10–12 and integrating them into the rice genetic map.13 However, the desire to have more markers is still strong, since the amount and their density over rice genomes are not sufficient for satisfying the need of geneticists and breeders.It is fortunate that Beijing Genomics Institute14 (BGI) and the International Rice Genome Sequencing Project15 have released their rice genomic data that provide comparative basis for a thorough analysis on MS between indica and japonica subspecies. Although such a survey has been done recently for chromosome 4 without eliminating MSs with multiple copies,16 the report focused on MSs in japonica rice cv. Nipponbare, mainly composed of DNRs, TNRs, and TTRs. In this study, we emphasize our newly discovered MS makers through a comparative analysis on MSs between the indica and japonica genome sequences, and have developed a genome-wide MS polymorphism database that have markers indexed in both rice genomes to facilitate molecular studies and marker-assisted breeding practice.2. Materials and methods2.1. Rice genome sequences and MS screeningThe genome sequences for indica (Oryza sativa ssp. indica cv. 9311) and japonica (O. sativa ssp. japonica cv. Nipponbare) (Version build4) were downloaded from http://rise.genomics.org.cn/rice2/index.jsp17 and http://rgp.dna.affrc.go.jp15 respectively. The 5'-UTR, coding, intronic, 3'-UTR, and intergenic regions were determined based on their original annotations. An MS motif scanning tool, SSRIT11 written in Perl was downloaded from Cornell University (http://www.gramene.org/) and modified to search for perfect MS repeats in the two rice genome sequences, including mono-nucleotide repeats (MNRs), di-nucleotide repeats (DNRs), tri-nucleotide repeats (TNRs), tetra-nucleotide repeats (TTRs), penta-nucleotide repeats (PNRs), and hexa-nucleotide repeats (HNRs) with numbers of repeat units of 10, 7, 6, 5, 4 and 4, respectively. Some of these MS sequences were combined into one repeat complex if the lengths between two adjacent units were less than 20 bp.2.2. MS Polymorphism and primer designAn MS locus is defined as a tract of genomic sequences that include a perfect repeat motif and two unique 160-bp flanking sequences on each sides of the repeat. These MS candidate sequences were aligned to their source genome sequences with BLASTN (E-value cutoff of 1e-40); those with unique hit were selected as candidate MS loci together with their specific flanking sequences. The selected MS sequences were then used as queries against another genome without filtering low complexity sequences. We wrote a Perl script (Supplementary script: polymorphism.pl) to determine the presence of polymorphisms among MS motifs between indica and japonica. Primers pairs were automatically designed on the basis of unique flanking sequences aided by Primer318 with its default parameters. Candidate primer sequences were subsequently filtered through following parameters: length range from 18 to 24 bp, devoid of consecutive tracts of single nucleotide, GC content around 50% with a theoretical Tm approximately 60°C, and perfect ending with G- or C-rich at the 3' end.2.3. Experimental validationOne hundred primer pairs covering all rice chromosomes and covering all MS types were used for our validation experiment. The DNA templates used in this experiment are O. sativa ssp. indica cv. 9311 and O. sativa ssp. japonica cv. Nipponbare grown in a green house. Genomic DNA was extracted from 1-week-old seedlings, using the CTAB method.19 The quality of DNA was evaluated electrophoretically with 0.8% agarose gel.Oligonucleotide primers were made by Shanghai DNA Biotechnologies Co., Ltd. PCR was performed in 25 µl reactions containing 3.0 µl buffer, 2.5 µl MgCl2 (25 mM), 2.0 µl dNTP (2.5 mM), 0.5 µl Taq polymerase (5 U/µl), 3.0 µl template DNA (10 ng/µl), 13 µl ddH2O, 0.1 µg primers. A PTC-100TM thermal cycler (MJ Research Inc. Incline Village, NV, USA) was used along with the following PCR profile settings: 2 min at 96°C, 35 cycles of 40 s at 95°C, 30 s at 61°C, 1 min 30 s at 72°C, and a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. PCR products were electrophoresed on 1.0% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. Montage TM PCR96 Cleanup Kits were used to purify PCR products before being sequenced with an ABI 377 DNA sequencer.3. Results and discussion3.1. MS identification and distribution in the indica and japonica genomesWe identified 102 706 and 102 423 candidate MSs in the indica and japonica genomes, respectively, and the average distances between the repeat units are shorter in the indica genome (3.6 kb) than in the japonica (3.7 kb) genome. These candidate MSs reside largely within intergenic regions (58 094 or 56.6% for the indica and 58 812 or 57.4% for the japonica), as compared to those in intronic regions (20 868 or 20.3% in the indica and 19 631 or 19.2% for the japonica) (Table 1). However, the average MS lengths in the indica and japonica genomes were found similar, from 17.4 bp to 17.8 bp. The fractions of MSs with unique flanking sequences in the indica and japonica are 67.1% and 72.5%, respectively. We also found that one-third of the total MSs are polymorphic and that the number of MS with unique flanking sequences was slightly lower in the indica (68 895) than in the japonica (74 227), but the number of MS sequences with polymorphisms and their average lengths were nearly the same between the two subspecies (Table 1). It implies that the number of MS with polymorphisms and the average length of polymorphic SSRs are independent parameters in the two rice subspecies. MS loci most likely to be useful as genetic markers are those that are single copy in both genomes and polymorphic when the genomes are compared.Frequency and polymorphism of MSs in different genomic regions of indica and japonica genomesaAll MSs in the genomes.bMSs with unique flanking sequences.cMSs with polymorphisms.dRate of MS Wpm in MS Wsfs.eAverage length of MSs expressed in base pairs (bp).fPercent of MSs with unique flanking sequences against all.gPercent of MSs with polymorphisms against all.Frequency and polymorphism of MSs in different genomic regions of indica and japonica genomesaAll MSs in the genomes.bMSs with unique flanking sequences.cMSs with polymorphisms.dRate of MS Wpm in MS Wsfs.eAverage length of MSs expressed in base pairs (bp).fPercent of MSs with unique flanking sequences against all.gPercent of MSs with polymorphisms against all.3.2. MS polymorphisms in different genomic regionsWe have noticed that the average MS length and distance between candidate MS loci within coding regions of the two subspecies were slightly different. The indica genome has an average MS length of 20.8 bp and an average distance between candidate MS loci of 8.1 kb; the corresponding numbers in the japonica genome are 20.6 bp and 7.7 kb, respectively. In the regions other than the coding sequences, the average MS length and the average distance between candidate MS loci become 2.1–3.9 bp and 2.0–4.0 kb, respectively, although MS sequences are most abundant in 5'-UTR, followed in an order of intronic, 3'-UTR, intergenic, and coding regions. The trend was found consistent with previous reports in Arabidopsis and rice.3,20,21 In addition, GC contents of MS in other regions (19.9–40.1 and 20.8–42.0) are far lower than that of coding regions that are 81.4% and 81.4 % for the indica and japonica, respectively.We also looked into details of MSs and their unique flanking sequences among different regions in the indica genome and found that there are higher numbers of MSs with unique flanking sequences in intergenic, intronic, and 5'-UTR regions, and the trend is similar in japonica. MSs with both polymorphism and unique flanking sequences vary in different genomic regions, there are as low as 21.5 and 22% in coding regions in the indica and japonica genomes, respectively, whereas there is up to 40% observed in the intronic region (Table 1). We concluded that MSs within intronic regions are most polymorphic, and followed by UTR, intergenic, and coding regions.3.3. Polymorphisms and distribution of different MS repeat typesIn our collection, there are 62.5% MNRs, 17.2% DNRs, and 10.6% TNRs, which form the rice genome sequences; these repeat types are collectively over 90% of the total MS sequences. The distributions of these MS types are rather similar between indica and japonica in general. TNRs were predominately found in coding regions (87.5% for indica and 87.6% for japonica, respectively). MNRs and DNRs are highly dispersed in intronic, 3'-UTR, intergenic, and 5'-UTR regions (Fig. 1A). The distribution of polymorphic MS loci is similar among all types, except the percentage of TNRs in various genomic regions varies significantly (Fig. 1B). With respect to the polymorphism rate (the ratio between MSs with polymorphism and the total) and those with unique flanking sequences, we found that MNRs and DNRs are better than TNRs in all genomic regions (Fig. 1C). The polymorphism rate of TTRs, PNRs, and HNRs varies from 32 to 40% (data not shown), and they may provide additional sources for molecular makers when called upon.Percentages and polymorphic rates of MNR, DNR, and TNR in different regions of the two rice genomes.

(B) Percentages of MNR, DNR, and TNR with polymorphisms. (C) Polymorphic rates of MNR, DNR, and TNR.3.4. Polymorphisms of the candidate MS loci with different repeat unitsThe number of A/T repeats is 8.5 and 6.8 times of all repeat types in the indica and japonica genomes, respectively; it is 7.5 and 6.6 times more polymorphic than C/G repeats. The average MS length (13.8 bp in the indica and 13.6 bp in the japonica) and the average length of MSs with polymorphisms (14.4 bp in indica and 14.1 bp in japonica) in C/G repeats are slightly longer than those of A/T repeats (10.8–11.2 bp). The polymorphism rate of C/G MNR class of SSR is slightly higher (68.6% for indica and 61.3% for japonica) than that of A/T MNRs (53.5% for indica and 49.6% for japonica). Therefore, when targeting MNRs as the basis for developing genetic markers, the C/G repeat class is likely to be more useful, at least when comparing indica and japonica genotypes. Among DNRs, both AG/CT (59.8–56.4%) and AT/TA (>50%) repeats are more polymorphic than CG/GC repeats (15.6%). AT/TA repeats in the indica and japonica assemblies have a longer average length (>30 bp) than AG/CT repeats (22.6–22.5 bp; Table 2). The polymorphism rate of GC-rich TNRs is relatively lower than that of GC-poor TNRs, despite the fact that CCG/CGG repeats are the most abundant, contributing more than 40% to the total TNRs. The GC-poor repeats, such as AAT/ATT, AAG/CTT, and ACT/AGT, have polymorphic rates greater than 40% (Table 2). Another example is AGG/CCT that contributes to 15% of the total TNRs but the polymorphic rate of AGG/CCT repeats is relatively low, 35.5% for indica and 31.7% for japonica. The numbers of polymorphic ATC/GCT, AAC/GTT, and ACT/AGT repeats are scarce. Among TTRs, AGAT/ATCT, AAAT/ATTT, AAAG/CTTT, ACAT/ATGT, AGCT/AGCT, and AATT/AATT are quite dominant, and the two kinds of TTR (ACAT/ATGT and AGAT/ATCT) have longer average lengths and higher polymorphism rates. Among PNRs, AAAAG/CTTTT, AAAAT/ATTTT, AGAGG/CCTCT, and AGGGG/CCCCT are rather dominant, AGAGG/CCTCT is more polymorphic, 24.8% in indica and 31.7% in japonica; all other kinds of PNR have much lower polymorphic rates (data not shown).Polymorphism distribution of MS motifs in indica and japonica genomesLabels are the same as in Table 1.Polymorphism distribution of MS motifs in indica and japonica genomesLabels are the same as in Table 1.We detected 35 691 polymorphic MS loci with unique flanking sequences in the indica genome and 35 779 in the japonica genome (Table 3). If we took away 18 016 loci common for both, there were 53 454 subspecific MS loci left, and we were able to design primer pairs for 52 845 MSs (Table 3), which gave rise to one polymorphic MS for every 7.1 and 7.2 kb in lengths in indica and japonica, respectively. Of these MSs, there were 36 374 MNRs, 8298 DNRs, 3878 TNRs, 802 TTRs, 683 PNRs, 487 HNRs, and 2323 complex repeats that comprised two or more repeat units (Table 3). We also analyzed the length polymorphism of MSs in indica and japonica sequences (Fig. 2), and found that approximately 38% of MSs have a length difference of 1 bp. Only about 8% of MSs have a length polymorphism of more than 10 bp, and the number of MSs with polymorphism length of 5 and 7 bp is relatively small (Fig. 2), since the length polymorphism is related to the length of the repeat units or types.Length distribution of polymorphic MSs in indica and japonica rice genomes.Length distribution of polymorphic MSs in indica and japonica rice genomes.Summary of polymorphic MS loci(1) The identified polymorphic MS loci in indica; (2) The identified polymorphic MS loci in japonica; (3) The common polymorphic MS loci that are found to be the same in both indica and japonica; (4) The theoretical estimates of all polymorphic MS loci in rice that can be estimated according to the following formula polymorphic MS = (1) + (2) - (3); (5) Observed values of all polymorphic MS loci in rice.

Development of the polymorphic MS database for rice subspeciesA total of 18 828 SSR markers have been recently reported based on sequence analysis of the japonica cv. Nipponbare genome,15 and 2240 of the total were experimentally confirmed.13 Since some of the markers between the two genomes may not be polymorphic and their physical positions may not be unique, we may not be able to include all of them in our database. Although some MS polymorphisms in chromosome 4 between the indica and japonica have been reported,16 it was limited to a single chromosome without eliminating multiple-hitting copies. In addition, previous works have mainly focused on Class I MSs, such as DNRs, TNRs, and TTRs, whereas Class II MSs, including MNRs, PNRs, and HNRs have not drawn enough attention for marker development.By comparing MS sequences between the sequenced indica and japonica genomes, we developed a new database for 52 845 (Table 3) polymorphic MS loci with specific flanking sequences, including polymorphic ample Class II MSs. To avoid confusion in MS naming convention used by the rice community, we integrated 18 828 MSs published by IRGSP15 into our collection, and the same loci are cross-referenced (6294 MSs from IRGSP). However, 6641 MSs were excluded because they have multiple copies in the rice genome. Some 3988 MSs were found lack of polymorphism between the indica and japonica genomes, and 1905 MSs were not mapped due to the absence of reciprocal polymorphic sequences between the two genomes. Only 4509 Class I polymorphic MS loci were detected in the indica genome (Table 4), 1775 (6284 - 4509) loci were missed because the length of their repeat motif was less than 20 bp and do not satisfy the criteria of Class I in indica, although they were Class I loci in japonica. These 1775 shorter MS alleles in indica may not represent any technical or biological anomalies but simply happened by chance since MSs are in general short in length. In addition, we also mapped the genetic markers consisting of mostly RFLPs from RGP (http://rgp.dna.affrc.go.jp) on the indica (from http://rise.genomics.org.cn), IRGSP, and TIGR pseudomolecules in silico. Although there is a misunderstanding about the BGI's sequence assemblies, the indica pseudomolecules are believed as useful as the BAC-to-BAC assembly when evaluated carefully according to scientific rationales.22Comparative analysis of MSs identified in indica with different cutoffsClass I: MNRs with 20, DNRs with 10, and TNRs with seven repeat units; Class II: MNRs with 10 repeat units, DNRs with seven, and TNRs with six repeat units. The rest of the labels are the same as in Table 1.Comparative analysis of MSs identified in indica with different cutoffsClass I: MNRs with 20, DNRs with 10, and TNRs with seven repeat units; Class II: MNRs with 10 repeat units, DNRs with seven, and TNRs with six repeat units. The rest of the labels are the same as in Table 1.3.6. Classes of complex MS, such as MNRs, PNRs, and HNRs, could be used as genetic markers in the futureAt present, only some of the MSs, such as DNRs, TNRs, and TTRs, are used as genetic markers for rice, and other types have been largely ignored, perhaps due to the lack of adequate experimental methods, such as in the case of MNRs, although they are accounted for more than 60% of all MSs and approximately half of them are believed polymorphic. In this report, we validated a few MNRs (such as P005 and P010 in Fig. 3), proving their usefulness, and a recent report in typing method23 also suggested a new opportunity for the MNR application as genetic markers for rice. Although PNRs and HNRs have been previously used as molecular markers in sorghum and cotton,24,25 they have not been developed for rice. We found many polymorphic PNRs and HNRs with polymorphisms in the rice genome, and verified some of them experimentally, including eight PNRs, five HNRs, and four complex MSs. We believe that they should be used as genetic markers in rice in the future. It is important to note that polymorphisms found between 9311 and Nipponbare may not be generalized to other indica and japonica genomes, and additional sequence and genotyping information from diverse cultivars will broaden our understanding of SSR polymorphism in O. sativa.Experimental validation (PCR) of polymorphic MSs. Left lanes show PCR products from indica cv. 9311, and right lanes are samples from japonica cv. Nipponbare. MS involved MNR (P005, P010), DNR (P041, P031, P050, P043, P009, P039, P026, P040, P025, P024, P027), TNR (P055, P058, P062), TTR (P077), and other complex MS (P008, P095, P097, P100). Four PCR products for 9311 (P025, P026, P058, P062) and two for Nipponbare (P025, P058) showed complex band patterns and seven products (P008, P010, P025, P050, P055, P058, P062) appeared polymorphic.Experimental validation (PCR) of polymorphic MSs.

Four PCR products for 9311 (P025, P026, P058, P062) and two for Nipponbare (P025, P058) showed complex band patterns and seven products (P008, P010, P025, P050, P055, P058, P062) appeared polymorphic.Comparison of MSs identified in indica were made with different cut-off values. MS polymorphisms have two basic parameters, types of the repeat units and numbers of units. By adjusting cut-off values for the number of repeat units toward a lower boundary, we discovered more polymorphic MS loci that are both highly polymorphic and can be uniquely identified in the genomes. We did try to define Class 1 MS by using a standard protocol, but only detected 417 MNRs, 2747 DNRs, and 1345 TNRs in the indica genome assembly. In this report, we found that when the MNR length reaches 10 bp, the polymorphism numbers increases up to 23 324 for MNR with a length of 10 bp, 3825 for DNR with a length of 7 bp, and 2638 for TNR with a length of 6 bp (Table 3). It was evident that polymorphism counts of most Class II MNRs, DNRs, and TNRs are far higher than those of many Class I MS; the result suggests that different numbers of repeat units should be used for screening different MS types as genetic markers, such as 10 for MNRs, 7 for DNRs, 7 for TNRs, 6 for TTRs, 5 for PNRs, and 5 for HNRs.Most MS repeats have unique flanking sequences (62.1% for indica and 73.1% for japonica in our study), and MSs may be preferentially associated with non-repetitive regions in rice genome as reported by Morgante et al.3 except for AT/TA and AAT/ATT repeats.3,10,11 Furthermore, the fraction of MSs with unique flanking sequences in the indica is about 10% lower than that in the japonica, suggesting that there may be more repetitive sequences assembled in the indica genome when compared with the japonica genome. It was reported previously that MS polymorphism is positively correlated with their length,4,12 and the distribution of GC-rich DNRs and TNRs have a bias toward exons where polymorphisms occur scarcely.3,11,17,21 We also found in our current study that the degree of the polymorphisms in MSs depends on their genomic locations and the repeat types. For instance, higher polymorphism rates were found within intronic and UTR regions, whereas the lowest within coding regions. The relationship between GC content and MS polymorphism is unclear. For instance, A/T-containing MNRs have a slightly lower polymorphism rate than the G/C containing repeats. The opposite seems true in DNRs, where AG/CG repeats have higher polymorphism rates of 52–60%, than those in CG/GC repeats (15–16%). Similarly, CCG/CGG repeats contributing almost half of the total TNRs have a polymorphism rate of less than 30%, whereas AAT/ATT AAG/CTT and ACT/AGT have polymorphism rates of greater than 40%. Our results are in agreement to previous observations.4,12 The suggested reason was that GC-rich regions are relatively stable and resulted in less replication slippage.263.7. Experimental validation of 100 polymorphic MS lociTo validate our results, we chose 100 polymorphic MSs randomly for validation, using genomic DNA from indica cv. 9311 and japonica cv. Nipponbare as PCR templates. The PCR products were sequenced, and the result is summarized in Table 5 (other detailed information was summarized in Supplementary Table 1). We have 98 polymorphic MSs PCR-amplified in the two cultivars, and four of them worked for 9311 (P025, P026, P058, and P062 in Fig. 3) and two for Nipponbare (P025 and P058), showing complex banding patterns that were perhaps due to lack of sequence specificity in the genomic DNA sample. Sequencing results confirmed 91 PCR products to be polymorphic, and seven (P008, P010, P025, P050, P055, P058, and P062) of the remaining PCR products that failed in sequencing appeared polymorphic based on the existence of multiple DNA bands on agarose gels. Only one (P055) showed unexpected products with a length less than 150 bp. In addition, the sequences amplified with six primer pairs (P060, P016, P037, P087, P020, and P030 in Supplementary Table 1) appeared inconsistent with the expected genomic sequences. This could be explained by the fact that the low-complexity sequences were difficult to be sequenced and relatively error-prone. We concluded that our new MS collection contains at least 90% valid polymorphic MS markers.Summary of PCR amplification and sequencing in indica and japonica genomesNumbers in parentheses are the number of products with complex band pattern.Summary of PCR amplification and sequencing in indica and japonica genomesNumbers in parentheses are the number of products with complex band pattern.This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 30571146), the Key Research Project of Zhejiang Province (No. 2003C22007), and Rice Project of Zhejiang Province (04-06).Supplementary data"
