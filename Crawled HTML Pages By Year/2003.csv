2,10.1093/dnares/10.1.1,Discovery of Novel Transcription Control Relationships with Gene Regulatory Networks Generated from Multiple-disruption Full Genome Expression Libraries,"Sachiyo Aburatani,Kosuke Tashiro,Christopher J. Savoie,Mayumi Nishizawa,Kaori Hayashi,Yuzuru Ito,Shigeru Muta,Kiyoshi Yamamoto,Miki Ogawa,Akiko Enomoto,Momoka Masaki,Shouji Watanabe,Yukihiro Maki,Yoriko Takahashi,Yukihiro Eguchi,Yoshiyuki Sakaki,Satoru Kuhara",NO,NO,NO,1-Feb-03,"expression data, disruptant, gene regulatory network, MET28 regulation "," Gene regulatory networks elucidated from strategic, genome-wide experimental data can aid in the discovery of novel gene function information and expression regulation events from observation of transcriptional regulation among genes of known and unknown biological function. To create a reliable and comprehensive data set for the elucidation of transcription regulation networks, we conducted systematic genome-wide disruption expression experiments of yeast on 118 genes with known involvement in transcription regulation. We report several novel regulatory relationships between known transcription factors and other genes with previously unknown biological function discovered with this expression library. Here we report the downstream regulatory subnetworks for UME6 and MET28 . The elucidated network topology among these genes demonstrates MET28 's role as a nodal point between genes involved in cell division and those involved in DNA repair mechanisms. "
3,10.1093/dnares/10.1.9,In silico Inference of Inclusion Membrane Protein Family in Obligate Intracellular Parasites Chlamydiae,"Hidehiro Toh,Koshiro Miura,Mutsunori Shirai,Masahira Hattori",NO,NO,NO,1-Feb-03,"chlamydiae, pathogen, inclusion membrane protein, hydropathy profile, phase variation"," Chlamydiae are obligate intracellular pathogens that proliferate only inside a vacuole, called an inclusion. Chlamydial Inc proteins are known to be a major component of the inclusion membrane, but little is known about the gene number and function. The Inc proteins share very low sequence similarity but a similar hydropathy profile among them. Using the hydropathy profile, we computationally searched the open reading frames (ORFs) having a similar profile and predicted 90 and 36 ORFs (Inc-like ORFs) as candidates for Inc proteins in Chlamydia pneumoniae J138 and Chlamydia trachomatis serovar D, respectively. On the other hand, only a few Inc-like ORFs were found in organisms other than chlamydiae, suggesting that the Inc-like ORFs are specific to chlamydiae. Comparative genome analysis also revealed that the Inc-like ORFs have multiplied and diverged as paralogues and orthologues in the chlamydial genomes, and that some Inc-like ORFs lacked the N-terminal portion or encoded the split form. The data suggest that these gene products constitute a large protein family and may play an important role in chlamydial infection, growth and survival in the host cell. "
4,10.1093/dnares/10.1.19,Use of Gene Networks from Full Genome Microarray Libraries to Identify Functionally Relevant Drug-affected Genes and Gene Regulation Cascades,"Christopher J. Savoie,Sachiyo Aburatani,Shouji Watanabe,Yoshihiro Eguchi,Shigeru Muta,Seiya Imoto,Satoru Miyano,Satoru Kuhara,Kosuke Tashiro",NO,NO,NO,1-Feb-03,"drug discovery, microarray, CIK1, griseofulvin, network"," We developed an extensive yeast gene expression library consisting of full-genome cDNA array data for over 500 yeast strains, each with a single-gene disruption. Using this data, combined with dose and time course expression experiments with the oral antifungal agent griseofulvin, whose exact molecular targets were previously unknown, we used Boolean and Bayesian network discovery techniques to determine the gene expression regulatory cascades affected directly by this drug. Using this method we identified CIK1 as an important affected target gene related to the functional phenotype induced by griseofulvin. Cellular functional analysis of griseofulvin showed similar tubulin-specific morphological effects on mitotic spindle formation to those of the drug, in agreement with the known function of CIK1p. Further, using the nonparametric, nonlinear Bayesian gene networks we were able to identify alternative ligand-dependant transcription factors and G protein homologues upstream of CIK1 that regulate CIK1 expression and might therefore serve as alternative molecular targets to induce the same molecular response as griseofulvin.

Sequence Features and Mapping of Sixty-two TAC Clones Which Cover the 6.7 Mb Regions of the Genome,"Takakazu Kaneko,Erika Asamizu,Tomohiko Kato,Shusei Sato,Yasukazu Nakamura,Satoshi Tabata",NO,NO,NO,1-Feb-03,"Lotus japonicus, genomic sequence, TAC genomic library, gene prediction, linkage mapping"," A total of sixty-two clones were selected from a TAC (transformation-competent artificial chromosome) genomic library of the Lotus japonicus accession MG-20 based on the sequence information of expressed sequence tags (ESTs), cDNA and gene information, and their nucleotide sequences were determined. The length of the sequenced regions in this study is 6,682,189 bp, and the total length of the regions sequenced so far is 18,711,484 bp together with the nucleotide sequences of 121 TAC clones previously reported. By comparison with the sequences in protein and EST databases and analysis with computer programs for gene modeling, a total of 573 potential protein-coding genes with known or predicted functions, 91 gene segments and 272 pseudogenes were identified in the newly sequenced regions. Each of the sequenced clones was localized onto the linkage map of two accessions of L. japonicus , Gifu B-129 and Miyakojima MG-20, using simple sequence repeat length polymorphism (SSLP) or derived cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (dCAPS) markers generated based on the nucleotide sequences of the clones. The sequence data, gene information and mapping information are available through the World Wide Web at Author Webpage . "
6,10.1093/dnares/10.1.35,Prediction of the Coding Sequences of Mouse Homologues of KIAA Gene: II. The Complete Nucleotide Sequences of 400 Mouse KIAA-homologous cDNAs Identified by Screening of Terminal Sequences of cDNA Clones Randomly Sampled from Size-fractionated Libraries,"Noriko Okazaki,Reiko Kikuno,Reiko Ohara,Susumu Inamoto,Hidenori Aizawa,Shigeki Yuasa,Daisuke Nakajima,Takahiro Nagase,Osamu Ohara,Hisashi Koga",NO,NO,NO,1-Feb-03,"mKIAA, mouse, cDNA sequencing, large proteins, orthologue, chromosomal localization","We have accumulated information of the coding sequences of uncharacterized human genes, which are known as KIAA genes, and the number of these genes exceeds 2000 at present. As an extension of this sequencing project, we recently have begun to accumulate mouse KIAA-homologous cDNAs, because it would be useful to prepare a set of human and mouse homologous cDNA pairs for further functional analysis of the KIAA genes. We herein present the entire sequences of 400 mouse KIAA cDNA clones and 4 novel cDNA clones which were incidentally identified during this project. Most of clones entirely sequenced in this study were selected by computer-assisted analysis of terminal sequences of the cDNAs. The average size of the 404 cDNA sequences reached 5.3 kb and that of the deduced amino acid sequences from these cDNAs was 868 amino acid residues. The results of sequence analyses of these clones showed that single mouse KIAA cDNAs bridged two different human KIAA cDNAs in some cases, which indicated that these two human KIAA cDNAs were derived from single genes although they had been supposed to originate from different genes. Furthermore, we successfully mapped all the mouse KIAA cDNAs along the genome using a recently published mouse genome draft sequence."
7,10.1093/dnares/10.1.49,Characterization of Long cDNA Clones from Human Adult Spleen. II. The Complete Sequences of 81 cDNA Clones,"Hiroyuki Jikuya,Jun Takano,Reiko Kikuno,Makoto Hirosawa,Takahiro Nagase,Nobuo Nomura,Osamu Ohara",NO,NO,NO,1-Feb-03,"long cDNA, single-pass sequence, cDNA sequencing, spleen"," To accumulate information on the coding sequences (CDSs) of unidentified genes, we have conducted a sequencing project of human long cDNA clones. Both the end sequences of approximately 10,000 cDNA clones from two size-fractionated human spleen cDNA libraries (average sizes of 4.5 kb and 5.6 kb) were determined by single-pass sequencing to select cDNAs with unidentified sequences. We herein present the entire sequences of 81 cDNA clones, most of which were selected by two approaches based on their protein-coding potentialities in silico : Fifty-eight cDNA clones were selected as those having protein-coding potentialities at the 5'-end of single-pass sequences by applying the GeneMark analysis; and 20 cDNA clones were selected as those expected to encode proteins larger than 100 amino acid residues by analysis of the human genome sequences flanked by both the end sequences of cDNAs using the GENSCAN gene prediction program. In addition to these newly identified cDNAs, three cDNA clones were isolated by colony hybridization experiments using probes corresponding to known gene sequences since these cDNAs are likely to contain considerable amounts of new information regarding the genes already annotated. The sequence data indicated that the average sizes of the inserts and corresponding CDSs of cDNA clones analyzed here were 5.0 kb and 2.0 kb (670 amino acid residues), respectively. From the results of homology and motif searches against the public databases, functional categories of the 29 predicted gene products could be assigned; 86% of these predicted gene products (25 gene products) were classified into proteins relating to cell signaling/communication, nucleic acid management, and cell structure/motility.
