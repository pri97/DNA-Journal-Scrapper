But, the resources of its transcriptome or genome are still little now. Bombina maxima possess strong ability to survival in very harsh environment with a more mature immune system. We obtained a comprehensive transcriptome by RNA-sequencing technology. 14.3% of transcripts were identified to be skin-specific genes, most of which were not isolated from skin secretion in previous works or novel non-coding RNAs. 27.9% of transcripts were mapped into 242 predicted KEGG pathways and 6.16% of transcripts related to human disease and cancer. Of 39 448 transcripts with the coding sequence, at least 1501 transcripts (570 genes) related to the immune system process. The molecules of immune signalling pathway were almost presented, several transcripts with high expression in skin and stomach. Experiments showed that lipopolysaccharide or bacteria challenge stimulated pro-inflammatory cytokine production and activation of pro-inflammatory caspase-1. These frog's data can remarkably expand the existing genome or transcriptome resources of amphibians, especially immunity data. The entity of the data provides a valuable platform for further investigation on more detailed immune response in B. maxima and a comparative study with other amphibians.1. IntroductionAmphibians have been used as vertebrate models for the experimentalist since the 19th century. Since 50 years or so, Xenopus laevis is the most widely used anuran amphibian research organism,1 an important model of vertebrate cell biology and development for many decades.2 However, of the thousands of species, only two closely related species (Xenopus silurana tropicalis and X. laevis) have considerable genomic resources: published genome of the Pipid, Xenopus (silurana) tropicalis, and transcript information of X. laevis.3,4Xenopus tropicalis, of which genome analysis results show that at least 1700 predicted genes identified to be human disease genes, occupies a key phylogenetic position among amniots and teleost fish.4 But, understanding of the genome requires large quality of transcripts as reference sequences. The transcriptome is comprised of a comprehensive set of genes active in selected tissues and species. Therefore, understanding global dynamics of the transcriptome is essential for interpreting genome expanded information and unravelling phenotypic variation.5In our previous studies, the Chinese red belly frog (Bombina maxima) has various different skin secretions defencing external stimulus, which is an endemic amphibian and lives in very harsh environments of the mountainous regions of southwestern China.6–9 This study was motivated by two reasons. First, genome-wide or transcriptome-wide approaches are now being applied to whole-genome wide duplication of Xenopodinae.10 However, the amphibian is still the lack of genomic resources like genomic sequences and transcriptome dataset, in spite of two Xenopus toads' genome or transcriptome being available. Secondly, more and more investigators found that Xenopus model offers an invaluable research tool for immunological research.11 In addition, the most ancient mechanism of immunity was considered to be direct microbicidal activity of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) in the human immune system.12 In frogs, extremely abundant and diverse AMPs have been reported in our previous studies.13 A lot of AMPs were also rich in B. maxima.7 In recent studies, the immune system of amphibian species is nearly as complex as that of mammals.11 But, research on the immune system of anuran amphibians exclusively relies on X. laevis as a model.14Bombina and Xenoanura diverged in the middle Jurassic and the ancestor of Bombina appeared the Eocene of Palaeogene.15 From the living environment and skin secretions of B. maxima, it could have a more mature immune system compared with Xenopus, potentially suited to be as a new model for identifying the nature of innate or adaptive immunity in vertebrates. Thus, we performed the latest paired-end RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) techniques16 to transcriptome-wide depict its feature of the immune system. The database of the transcriptome will submit to public databases for free to use.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Animals and ethicsBombina maxima, used here were obtained from the Kunming Institute of Zoology, which has been used in our previous studies. All the animal studies were reviewed and approved by the animal care and use committee of Kunming Institute of Zoology, The Chinese Academy of Sciences.2.2. Construction of the transcriptomeSkin and blood tissues were sampled from four adult frogs with no injury. RNA extraction and library construction are described in detail in Supplementary information S1. Transcriptome-sequencing clean reads is basis for assembly and following analysis (the data are archived at the NCBI Sequence Read Archive under accession number SRA058577; http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra). Transcriptome is assembled in de novo (Supplementary information S2).2.3. Transcriptome functional annotationThe transcript sequences were identified with the coding sequence (CDS) to search for gene ontology (GO) terms (Supplementary information S3). All translated protein sequences were identified protein domain prediction. Tissue-specific genes and comparative expression analysis are described in Supplementary information S4. Identification of novel non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) is identified as Tan's methods.17 The detailed description is mentioned in Supplementary information S5.2.4. Tissue expression of selected immune-related genesWe used cDNA as a template for reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) amplification of the coding regions of several given immune genes. Equal amounts of total RNA (1.05 µg) from each tissue were pooled for cDNA generation (Supplementary information S6). Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was carried out using the LightCycler® 480 (Roche, Switzerland) with SYBR premix Ex Taq II (TaKaRa, Japan). Samples were run in triplicates. Primers used in qRT-PCR are shown in Supplementary Table S1. For each primer, a melting curve of the PCR product was also performed to ensure the absence of artefacts. The comparative crossing points (<U+0394>CP) method18 was used for the relative quantification of the respective transcript expression. Expression values were normalized using an endogenous beta-actin.2.5. Stimulation of immune response in vitro and in vivoIn vivo immune response was stimulated by intraperitoneal injection of bacteria or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In vitro stimulation were carried out on splenocytes from B. maxima. The detailed methods are described in Supplementary information S8.3. Results and Discussion3.1. Sequencing and transcriptome assemblycDNAs prepared from skin and blood tissues of B. maxima were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq™ 2000. After sequencing, 59 820 004 and 58 492 250 raw reads was separately obtained from skin and blood tissue in B. maxima. Cleaning the low-quality reads, we acquired 55 533 592 (4 998 023 280 bp from skin tissue) and 54 967 354 (4 947 061 860 bp from blood tissue) clean reads (Table 1). Using the Trinity program to assemble clean reads to contigs in de novo, a total of 172 119 contigs were separately generated from these two tissues. After contigs assembly, a total of 88 213 putative gene objects (all unigenes) were obtained ranging from 200 to 20 882 bp and 602 bp in average length. The size of unigenes >500 bp was 27 661. The largest unigenes had 20 882 bp, and the N50 of unigenes was 868 bp (Table 1). The length of all unigene sequences was >200 bp and 41.0% (36 209) were >499 bp in length (Supplementary Fig. S1). In term of sequence completeness, we used a less stringent but broadly adopted definition, considering a sequence to be full length if it comprises at least the complete CDS.19 Of the 88 213 (41.2%) unigenes, 36 319 had CDS matches with direction possessed significant similarity (cut-off E-value of 1e-6) with best-hit blast results. Of 88 213 (3.5%) CDS sequences, 3129 were produced by ESTScan program, which cannot to be aligned to known databases. Finally, a total of 39 448 unigene sequences had the complete CDS (Supplementary Fig. S1). Summary of sequencing, assembly and analysis of B. maxima transcriptomeaQ20: percentage is the proportion of nucleotides with a quality value >20 in reads.bN50: unigene length-weighted median.Summary of sequencing, assembly and analysis of B. maxima transcriptomeaQ20: percentage is the proportion of nucleotides with a quality value >20 in reads.bN50: unigene length-weighted median.3.2. Function annotationSeveral complementary methods were used to annotate the assembled sequences. To begin with using BLASTX and BLASTN, the assembled sequences were searched against the Nr, Swiss-Prot protein databases and Nt nucleotides database (cut-off E-value of 1e-6). Of the 88 213 assembled sequences, 35 457 (Nr, 40.2%), 30 413 (Swiss-Prot, 34.5%) and 27 622 (Nt, 31.3%) had significant matches. The more detailed analysis of the blast top 30 hits is shown in Supplementary Fig. S2. We compared the transcriptome with CDS with that of human (Ensemble data release 69) and X. tropicalis (Xenbase, Xentr7_2). The overlap between transcripts from the transcriptome of Bombina and Xenopus is larger than the others (Fig. 1A). In total, above two times more transcripts of B. maxima have the orthologs in X. tropicalis, compared with human. However, the most of transcripts from B. maxima have no orthologs with human and X. tropicalis. Although ~32% of transcripts from B. maxima have its orthologs in Xenopus, obviously most of the transcripts were identified to be species-specific transcripts or novel-spliced transcripts of this frog and Xenopus. To determine the expression level of the transcripts in skin and blood tissues, we mapped the raw reads to the assembled sequences. The reads per kilobase per million (RPKM) values of the transcripts are shown in Fig. 1B. It depicts that gene with high expression has distinct biases for skin, compared with the blood. Functional profiles of the transcriptome. (A) The venn diagram shows the comparison of the transcriptome between B. maxima, X. laevis and human.

Of these, 11 905 (33.6%) were assigned to one or more 3423 GO terms. As reported in other Xenopus transcriptome studies,3 the largest proportion of transcripts fell into 2–3 broad and general categories as follows: ‘Biological Process’, ‘Molecular Function’ and ‘Cellular Component’ (Supplementary Fig. S3). These results were similarly found in Mytilus edulis,20Hypophthalmichthys molitrix,21Sus scrofa22. As our expectation, a great amount of transcripts were involved in localization process (2383, 20.02%) and development process (2204, 18.51%), corresponding to the results of X. tropicalis transcriptome.17 Meanwhile, annotation of the 88 213 unigene sequences using Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG) of protein databases generated the results for 9625 putative proteins. The COG annotated putative proteins ranged functionally into at least 25 molecular families, including cell cycle control, cell membrane biogenesis, immune defence and signal transduction (Supplementary Fig. S4), in accordance with the categories of GO annotation described above.To further analyse the tissue-specific genes, the strict filter was performed as Supplementary methods. Finally, 12 608 (14.3%) and 6771 (7.7%) unigenes were identified to be skin-specific and blood-specific genes (Fig. 1C). Compared with blood-specific genes, the skin-specific genes have a large proportion of high-expressed genes (Fig. 1D), 70 skin-specific genes whose RPKM values were >50. As our expectation, most of them were related to epithelial cell growth, wound healing and AMPs. One of high-expressed AMP—Maximin S2, isolated from skin secretion in our previous work, was identified to be as the skin-specific gene. Besides the Maximin S2, a fungicide antimicrobial peptide, Holotricin, was also a high-expressed skin-specific protein, which was not isolated from skin secretions in our previous work. In the high-expressed skin-specific genes, more and more epithelial cells' components were identified with highest RPKM values, such as WAP, Desmoglein-1. Our results responses the fact that this frog can be lived well in the harsh environment.Next, we examined the unannotated transcripts (47 582, 53.9% of all transcripts) for protein-coding transcripts potential, leaving 47 112 transcripts as potential ncRNAs. As methods of Supplementary information S5, we finally identified 1183 ncRNAs (Fig. 1E), which possess at least 70% sequence identity to known non-coding genes. These ncRNAs serve as the definite ncRNAs in B. maxima. Clustering analysis reveals that these genes can be broadly divided into three clusters (Fig. 1F). The first cluster corresponds to the transcripts whose expression levels had great variations between skin and blood tissue. The second cluster contains the genes whose high expressions were gradually increased over skin to blood. It indicates that the ncRNAs play important roles in skin and blood. The third cluster appears to contain the genes that are sharply degraded with high expression in blood, compared with skin. Not all ncRNAs derived from skin and blood tissues, we mapped the raw reads to ncRNAs transcripts and found that there were 146 (12.3%) skin-specific and 46 (3.9%) blood-specific ncRNAs (Supplementary Table S2). Collectively, our analysis has identified with confidence a total of 47 112 potential ncRNAs and 1183 definite ncRNAs. We observed that the majority of these ncRNAs appears to be lowly expressed, with 69.0% of them (or 815 transcripts) having maximum RPKM of <5. In addition, the non-coding transcripts that we found in this study appear to be performing tissue-specific function. This collection of ncRNAs provides a rich resource for future functional studies, which will greatly enhance our understanding the genetic adaption of the frog.3.3. KEGG pathways analysisA total of 24 579 assembled sequences were identified to occur in 242 predicted KEGG pathways. The number of sequences ranged from 2 to 2722. The top 20 pathways with the highest number of sequences are shown in Table 2, and the maximum of transcripts was found in the metabolic pathways (n = 2722). Metabolic pathways, implicated the intracellular metabolic pathways control immune tolerance and regulation of stem cell behaviour and life span,23 showed the highest number of transcripts here and corresponded to the results of GO annotation described above and published transcriptome report.21,22 As the previous report of X. tropicalis genome, 7% of protein-coding gene orthologs were identified to be human disease genes.4 We also identified 11.17% (2745) of transcripts related disease using KEGG analysis, related disease including Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease (n = 619), Chagas disease (American trypanosomiasis, n = 280), Parkinson's disease (191), Autoimmune thyroid disease (n = 131), Graft-versus-host disease (n = 121), Prion diseases (n = 116). Remarkably, 2693 (10.95% of 24 579 transcripts annotated by KEGG analysis) transcripts were identified to be related to cancer pathways and specified cancer (small-cell lung cancer, prostate cancer, endometrial cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer, bladder cancer and thyroid cancer). This analysis and annotation may be useful for further study and great interest for other researchers. Summary of top 20 pathways with highest gene numbersSummary of top 20 pathways with highest gene numbers3.4. Protein domains predictionInterProScan identified 55 758 protein domains (6912 types) among 22 241 unigene sequences. The protein domains abundantly occurred in immunoglobulin-related domains (n = 1802), Zinc finger, C2H2 (n = 864; IPR007087), followed by reverse transcriptase (n = 802; IPR000477), Zinc finger, C2H2-like (n = 748; IPR015880), Zinc finger, C2H2-type/integrase, DNA binding (n = 709; IPR013087) and Zinc finger, RING/FYVE/PHD type (n = 387; IPR013083) (Fig. 2). A total of 4416 transcripts (5.0% of the transcriptome) with protein domains including Zinc finger keyword were identified, which comprise 80 types of protein domain. Usually, the most common DNA-binding motif and transcription factors contain one or more capable of making sequence-specific recognition of DNA and also binding to RNA and protein targets.24 Comparing with other species' transcriptome or genome,25,26 Zinc finger protein domain was enriched in all scanned protein domains, such as 3.3% in Macrobrachiumrosenbergii transcriptome and 2.6% in the mouse transcriptome. The distribution of protein domains predicted in B. maxima unigenes. The protein domain prediction was obtained by the InterProScan software. Remarkably, the sum of immunoglobulin-related domain is higher than others.The distribution of protein domains predicted in B. maxima unigenes. The protein domain prediction was obtained by the InterProScan software. Remarkably, the sum of immunoglobulin-related domain is higher than others.Among the immunoglobulin-related domains, a total of 653 immunoglobulin (Ig)-like-fold domains (IPR013783) and 318 immunoglobulin-like domains (IPR007110) were predicted (Fig. 2). Ig-like-fold domains are involved in a variety of functions playing essential roles in the vertebrate immune response and many other processes, involved with protein–protein interactions with their ß-sheets. Ig-like-related domains were also found in other published species' transcriptome. However, its proportion in M. rosenbergii (0.9% of Ig-like-fold domains in 8411 detected contigs) was much less than that in B. maxima (2.9% of 22 241 input sequences). Moreover, the immunoglobulin provides further links between vertebrate immune systems. Interestingly, we found a high number of repeating units ending with Trp-Asp (WD)-containing domains (4.6% of the CDS), including WD40/YVTN repeat-like-containing domains (IPR015943; n = 423), WD40-repeat-like-containing domains (IPR011046; n = 303), WD40-repeat subgroup (IPR019781; n = 300), WD40-repeat domains (IPR001680; n = 281), WD40-repeat-containing domains (IPR017986; n = 267) and WD40-repeat 2 (IPR019782; n = 254) domains. In contrast to published domain prediction data, 2.1% of the transcripts with WD40-repeat domains in the M. rosenbergii transcriptome. These domains are involved in functions ranging from signal transduction transcription regulation to cell cycle control and apoptosis.27 In Xenopus, the WD40-repeat domains were present in wdr36, traf51 and pik3r4 related to transcriptional regulation and epigenetic regulation in the latest report.173.5. Genes related to the innate immune systemInnate immune system (IIS) is the ancient defence system and first defence line of multicellular organisms against various infectious agents. We identified 1501transcripts (570 genes) involved in the immune system process. Of these, a total of 32 transcripts and at least 11 different Toll-like receptors (TLRs) were identified in B. maxima, including TLR1, TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR6, TLR7, TLR8 and Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table S3). The TLRs signalling pathway is primarily dependent on TLR2 and TLR4. In humans, TLR2 binds LPS in the presence of LPS-binding protein (LBP) and CD14, and then induces nuclear factor (NF)-<U+03BA>B activation. In B. maxima, lipoprotein and peptidoglycan can induce the TLR signalling pathway in B. maxima, indicated by the predicted pathway map (Fig. 4A). The expression of several key molecules activated by the signalling pathway was validated in B. maxima (Fig. 4B and Supplementary Table S4). We detected the expression of TLR2 and TLR4 using qRT-PCR, and then found that TLR2 and TLR4 show a peak expression in spleen, kidney, stomach and liver (Fig. 4D). In digital expression genes analysis (Fig. 4C), the clustered expression of genes in skin and blood was divided into major three clusters. The first cluster contains genes whose expression in skin and blood keep in the medium level, comparing with others. Most of them are downstream genes of the signalling pathway. The second cluster corresponds to genes whose expression in skin was higher than that in blood except for its first branch. The third cluster contains genes with highest expression in the TLR pathway of B. maxima. The putative genes related to the immune system in B. maxima.

Results are the mean crossing points (<U+0394>CP) value ± SEM (n = 3 technical triplicates).CD14 transcripts of B. maxima were not mapped to the pathway determined by KEGG annotation. The similarity of CD14 in B. maxima was closely identical to that of Taeniopygia guttata and also to TLR2 type 2 of Amazona albifrons. In addition to previous studies, fish, of which TLR4 is not response to LPS, are resistant to endotoxic shock.28 In frog, the TLR4 is respond to LPS as a receptor in urinary bladder epithelial cells.29 As the pathway prediction, it showed that TLR4 might be failing to respond to LPS through LBP binding to CD14 induced the pathway. Hence, the fact that TLR4 of B. maxima can recognize the LPS to induce the pathway remains to be elucidated. Then, in addition to in silico analysis, we detected the response to LPS or bacteria both in vitro and in vivo. Interleukin (IL)-1ß and IL-8 are pro-inflammatory cytokines that play pivotal role in the innate immunity. In response to LPS stimulation, it can be activated in dependent of TLRs activation.30 We detected the IL-1ß and IL8 secretion by B. maxima splenocytes after LPS or bacteria stimulation. The results from RT-PCR demonstrated that the mRNA level elevated than that of unstimulated (Fig. 5A). LPS and bacteria stimulation upregulated the intracellular level of pro-IL-1ß, but LPS only slightly enhanced the secretion of mature IL-1ß. It seems that bacteria strongly enhanced the expression and secretion of IL-1ß (Fig. 5B). Western blotting of IL-8 revealed that LPS and bacteria enhanced the secretion of IL-8 by splenocytes (Fig. 5B). The secretion of IL-1ß and IL-8 upon LPS and bacteria stimulation were also tested in vivo. The results demonstrated that after intraperitoneal administration of either LPS or bacteria, IL-1ß and -8 could be found in the peritoneum exudate fluids (Fig. 5D). LPS and bacteria induced the change of peritoneum cell proportion, and also the upregulated proportion of cells was identified to be monocyte-like cells (Fig. 5E). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and bacteria induced pro-inflammatory caspase activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion in vitro and in vivo. (A) Splenocytes were isolated from B. maxima spleen and stimulated with LPS (8 µg/ml) or bacteria (3 × 108cfu/ml) for 2 h. The cells were collected for RT-PCR of IL-1ßand IL-8. Either LPS or bacteria can upregulate the mRNA level of IL-1ß and IL-8. (B) Splenocytes were incubated with LPS or bacteria. The cells and the supernatants were collected for western blotting of IL-1ß and IL-8. (C) Splenocytes stimulated with LPS or bacteria were lysed for the detection of caspase-1 activation by western blotting. The band of ~20 kDa represents the presence of activated caspase-1. (D) Bombina maxima weighted 25 ± 5 g were injected intraperitoneally with LPS (50 mg/kg in 0.1 ml PBS) or bacteria (3 × 108cfu in 0.1 ml PBS, Staphylococcus aureus, ATCC25923). Two hours after injection, peritoneum exudates were harvested, IL-1ß and IL-8 were detected by western blot. (E) Two hours after injection, peritoneal cells were harvested and analysed by flow cytometry. The mostly changed subset of cells was stained and photographed.Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and bacteria induced pro-inflammatory caspase activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion in vitro and in vivo.

The mostly changed subset of cells was stained and photographed.The ligation of TLRs signalling occurs primarily through MyD88 (MyD88-dependent pathway) or other adapter proteins (TRAM, TRIF and MyD88-independent pathway). It leads to the induction of antimicrobial genes, cytokines and chemokines and maturation of dendritic cells (Fig. 4A). In TLR4 signal transduction, Mal (MyD88) is a necessary adaptor.31 We surely found MyD88 transcripts and that had nearly 2-fold expression in skin than in blood, containing Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain. But, the RPKM value of MyD88 in skin was a little great than in blood. In addition, MyD88 is required for Xenopus axis formation as binding protein with Toll/IL-1 receptors.32 In the MyD88-independent pathway, the putative transcripts of components were identified such as TRAF3, TBK1 and several IRFs (Fig. 4A and Supplementary Table S3).The complement system is a key subsystem in innate immunity, which is composed of many serum proteins associated with many important activities.33 A total of 157 transcripts were identified including C2, C3, C3d, C4a, C5, C6, factor B, factor D and factor I, etc. The most of key complement components were also detected with high expression in skin, stomach and lung tissues of B. maxima (Supplementary Fig. S5 and Table S3). The complement components usually share the short consensus domains, such as C9 with perforin-like domain. We analysed the domains contained in complement components of B. maxima. Most of the complement components shared CCP domain and Tryp SPc (trypsin-like serine protease) domain (Supplementary Table S5). But, the factor P (properdin factor) and factor B have thrombospondin_1 domain. These domains may play a important role in complement initiation and amplification. The regulator of complement activation (RCA) is essential for excessive C3 activation that often drives the consumption of the complement pathway and damages self tissue.34 We identified two RCA-coding proteins in B. maxima, ARC1 and ARC3, which are closely identical to the ARCs of Xenopus (Supplementary Fig. S5D and E). In addition to the lectin pathway, we also identified that a number of 22 transcripts highly expressed in B. Maxima, including Fcn1 (M-ficolin), Fcn2 (L-ficolin) and Fcn3 (H-ficolin). In our results, it shows a peak expression in spleen, kidney and stomach (Supplementary Fig. S5C).The cytokine network is an important homeostatic system with potent activities in immune surveillance, growth, developmental and repair processes.35 The important role of cytokines is controlling immune responses.36 We identified 42 interleukin/interleukin receptor transcripts in the B. maxima dataset. We did not found IL-2 transcripts in B. maxima the same as in Xenopus that involved in the bactericidal activity in the adaptive immune system (AIS).37 However, IL-34 and IL-7 receptors were identified in B. Maxima, with no orthologs of Xenopus (Supplementary Table S6). Another ancient and conserved cytokine is the macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) in the immune system. We identified one full-length MIF transcripts (345 bp), which is closely identical to the MIF of Xenopus, mouse and human (Supplementary Table S6). MIF is conserved across taxa from invertebrate to vertebrates,38 emerging as an important mediator of IIS.In human, TLRs engage in Type I interferon (IFN) (IFN-a/ß) production. In our results, the full-length Type I IFNs were not identified in the transcriptome. But, we found short-length (<200 bp) small contigs with the medium identity (40–60%) to Xenopus Type I IFNs, which have low consensus overlaps for further assembly to long transcripts. In interferon receptor pathways, Interferon-a/ß receptor (IFNAR) expressed eight transcripts in the transcriptome and mapped to the pathway (Fig. 4A and Supplementary Table S3). It shows high similarity to IFNAR of chicken (Supplementary Fig. S6A). The Type I IFNs all bind to IFNAR, which is composed of two chains: IFNAR1 and IFNAR2. The intracellular domain of IFNAR1 associates with Tyk2, whereas IFNAR2 associates with JAK1 and JAK2. Type I IFNs can induce the evolutionary pathway, JAK/STAT pathway. As expected, 12 transcripts with a high identity to JAK2 and STATs were found in B. maxima (Supplementary Table S3). These cytokines also regulate the expression of over 1200 genes, the products of which function as mediators of host immune responses,39 such as four families of IFN-inducible GTPases including dynamin-like GTPases, Mx proteins, p47 GTPases and very large inducible GTPase-1 (VLIG-1).40 These four families of IFN-inducible GTPases were all expressed in the B. maxima transcriptome (Supplementary Table S7). There were also great amounts of VLIG-1 from two major groups expressed in this frog (Supplementary Fig. S6B).NOD-like receptors (NLRs) and RIG-like receptors (RLRs) act as pathogen sensors for the recognition of intracellular bacteria and viruses. Twenty-nine transcripts of NLRs were present in B. maxima, including of 10 members such as NOD1, NLRC3, NLRC5, NAIP. Another intracellular sensor is retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) receptors. Two transcripts of RIG-I were identified in this transcriptome, with high similarity to Xenopus, then to mouse and human (Supplementary Table S6). Caspase-1 is considered as a typical member of pro-inflammatory caspases, including caspase-1, caspase-4, caspase-5 and caspase-12 in human and caspase-1, caspase-11 and caspase-12 in mouse.41 Caspase-1 is activated upon the assembly of inflammasome, which is assembled by the activation of NOD-like receptors including NLRP3, NLRP1 and NLRC4. In our present study, we tested whether the pro-inflammatory caspase, caspase-1, could be activated. The pro-enzyme form of caspase-1 is an ~45 kDa protein and cleaved into a p10 and p20 subunit after activation. The results showed that, after bacteria stimulation, the appearance of p20 was determined by western blotting using a rabbit polyclonal antibody against caspase-1 p20. Although it seems that LPS was also able to induce the activation of caspase-1, the ability is much weaker than bacteria (Fig. 5C). As the downstream executor of inflammasome, caspase-1 activation implied the presence of the NLR–inflammasome–caspase-1 pathway in this frog.3.6. Genes related to the adaptive immune systemCurrently available data indicate that the AIS suddenly emerged on vertebrate with jaws like a ‘big-bang’ event.42,43 So, it is fascinating to many scientist and investigators for its origin and evolution. The highly complex of AIS is based on intact B-cell receptor (BCR)–T-cell receptor (TCR)–major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-based AIS.43 We identified the transcripts of BCR, TCR and MHC in B. maxima (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table S3). Moreover, we amplified some key components of the AIS and sequencing the amplified results (Fig. 6A). All of validated molecules were high expressed in B. Maxima, excluding IgM compared with the others (Fig. 6B and Supplementary Table S4). From the components of AIS, the immune system of B. maxima is nearly parallel to the mammals'. BCR is composed of two parts, ligand-binding moiety and signal transduction moiety. We identified that IgM, Ig CH II/IgY, IgG and many segments of heavy chain and light chains were definitely presented in the B. maxima transcriptome (Supplementary Table S3). IgM, generally evolutionarily conserved, is most ancient antibody class and secreted monomer.44 IgY is first found in amphibians, the function of which is equal to IgG and IgE.45 Shorter forms of IgY are believed to neutralize pathogen without activation of inflammatory response.43 In addition, we identified the IgG-gamma heavy chain in B. maxima that is searched with no result in Xenopus (Supplementary Table S6). IgG is involved in high-affinity memory responses. In summary, frog is the most primitive species, whose IgY and IgG play a important role in immune response, with a classical memory response that is based on class switching after antigen stimulation. This result showed that IgY has already taken rearrangement and is essential for immune response in B. maxima. CD79A was also identified in the transcriptome and had two transcripts. Therefore, the component of BCRs is complete in the AIS of B. maxima. TCR is responsible for recognizing antigens bound to MHC molecules. Beta-chain TCR and gamma-chain TCR were identified, but alpha-chain and delta-chain had no transcripts expressed in skin and blood tissues. TCR is a heterodimer, consisting of a/ß-chains and <U+03B3>/d-chains. A translocon organization of both a- and ß-TCR genes is found in all animals, and the d- and a-TCR gene with close linkage.43 Hence, the a- and d-chain of TCR probably existed in B. maxima. Genes related to the adaptive immune system. (A) Several selected molecules of the AIS in B. maxima were amplified by RT-PCR using RNA from skin and blood tissues, primers designed according to the assembled sequences of the transcriptome. These molecules were identified by searching against known database and domain prediction. Each two transcripts from 18 MHC I and 11 MHC II were detected by RT-PCR. (B) Five key immune components were detected its expression in seven different tissues using qRT-PCR. Results are the mean <U+0394>CP value ± SEM (n = 3 technical triplicates). (C) Eighteen MHC Class I amino sequences were from B. maxima, and MHC I of Gallus gallus, MHC Ia and Ib of Homo sapiens, MHC Ia and Ib of Mus musculus and MHC I of X. laevis. The bootstrap values next to the nodes represent the percentage of 1000 replicate trees supporting the corresponding clade. (D) Eleven MHC Class II amino sequences were from B. maxima, and other MHC II proteins from above species.Genes related to the adaptive immune system.

(D) Eleven MHC Class II amino sequences were from B. maxima, and other MHC II proteins from above species.The MHC is defined by MHC Class I and Class II; the MHC Class I/II molecules are closely involved in antigen presentation and usually has multiple copies in the vertebrates.46 We identified 18 transcripts of MHC Class I and 11 transcripts of MHC Class II expressed in B. maxima. As the previous methods,47 we conservatively estimated that the minimum number of putative expressed MHC Class I and Class II was three and two loci indicated by transcripts clustering into three and two major groups without a reference genome (Fig. 6C and D). Multiple loci for MHC Class II have a profound impact on peptide binding and anti-infections.48 With multiple loci for MHC Class II, the frog has an ability to battle constantly intracellular infection, such as virus. Most Xenopus species have a single-expressed MHC Class I gene (Class Ia), which encodes receptor molecules to present intracellular pathogen and is closely linked to other genes assisting in antigen processing.49 MHC Class Ib gene belongs to a separate MHC lineage. The expressed multiple loci of MHC Class I/II is considered to be the crucial role acted by one or two rounds of whole-genome duplication (WGD) at stage of fish or amphibians.50 In fact, X. laevis expresses non-classical MHC Ib genes with similarity in sequence and structure to classical genes.51 From the constructed a phylogenetic tree (Fig. 6C), the MHC Class Ib have rapid rate of evolution compared with classical MHC Class Ia of B. maxima and X. laevis. The multiple sequence alignment of the selected MHC Class I sequences (Supplementary Fig. S7A) also shows that the rate of residue substitution to MHC Class Ia lower than that of MHC Class Ib from this frog and other vertebrates. The MHC Class Ia of X. laevis shows high identity to that of B. maxima, except in very few sites. And the conserved sites of MHC Class I exist great variances in this frog (marked with red box). Counterpart to MHC Class II (Supplementary Fig. S7B, marked with blue box), it shows that the conserved domain of four transcripts in B. maxima is high similarity to the human MHC Class II, instead of Xenopus, which is correspond to the phylogenetic tree analysis (Fig. 6D). The phylogenetic analysis revealed that these sequences clustered into distinct two clades. One of these clades is grouped into MHC Class Ib genes from higher vertebrates. From bootstrap values, MHC Class Ib was indeed a more rapid evolutional rate than MHC Class Ia. As to a single classical Class I locus expressed in X. tropicalis and X. laevis, the degree to which B. maxima is a good potential model for the anuran MHC.In summary, we have developed comprehensive transcriptome for B. maxima. Although there is extensive genome or transcriptome achieved in Xenopus, comparative analysis showed that difference exists between these two species' transcriptome. The data obtained is rich in gene transcripts related to disease and disease pathway, especially to immunity. Based on pathway prediction, we uncover the fact that TLRs can recognize the lipoproteins, peptidoglycan, LPS or bacteria in this frog. Furthermore, our results showed that NLR–inflammasome–caspase-1 pathway is present in this frog, which is not clear in other frogs including of Xenopus. Besides that active IIS, this frog can live well in harsh environment owing to its nearly parallel AIS to the mammal. In addition, tissue-specific genes and ncRNAs analysis initially reveal the genetic adaption of this frog.Authors' ContributionsY.Z., F.Z. and W.L. conceived the study. Manuscript wrote by F.Z.

Changes leading to specific biological states including some of the more complex diseases can now be characterized with relative ease. It is known that gut microbiota is involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), mainly Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, exhibiting symptoms in the gastrointestinal tract. Recent studies also showed increased frequency of oral manifestations among IBD patients, indicating aberrations in the oral microbiota. Based on these observations, we analyzed the composition of salivary microbiota of 35 IBD patients by 454 pyrosequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene and compared it with that of 24 healthy controls (HCs). The results showed that Bacteroidetes was significantly increased with a concurrent decrease in Proteobacteria in the salivary microbiota of IBD patients. The dominant genera, Streptococcus, Prevotella, Neisseria, Haemophilus, Veillonella, and Gemella, were found to largely contribute to dysbiosis (dysbacteriosis) observed in the salivary microbiota of IBD patients. Analysis of immunological biomarkers in the saliva of IBD patients showed elevated levels of many inflammatory cytokines and immunoglobulin A, and a lower lysozyme level. A strong correlation was shown between lysozyme and IL-1ß levels and the relative abundance of Streptococcus, Prevotella, Haemophilus and Veillonella. Our data demonstrate that dysbiosis of salivary microbiota is associated with inflammatory responses in IBD patients, suggesting that it is possibly linked to dysbiosis of their gut microbiota.1. IntroductionCurrent advances of next-generation sequencing technologies (NGS) have enabled us to acquire massive DNA sequence data from any types of samples.1 In particular, complex bacterial communities composed of numerous species in various environments including human body has become the practically feasible targets, and the analysis has been shifting to the DNA-based approach in conjugation with bioinformatics for enumerated data of metagenome and 16S rRNA gene (16S) produced by NGS.2–5 Among these approaches, pyrosequencing-based 16S gene analysis is rapid and cost effective to comprehensively evaluate the overall structure of bacterial communities and to identify species present in them, irrespective of the yet-uncultured species.6 This method includes targeted PCR amplification of 16S rRNA gene variable regions with appropriate primers, followed by sequencing of the 16S amplicons using 454 pyrosequencer.7–10 We recently developed the improved analytical pipeline for pyrosequencing data of 16S rRNA gene V1–V2 variable region for human gut microbiota, by reassessing a PCR primer sequence, clustering conditions of error-prone 16S reads, and the quality check process to effectively remove low-quality data, and thereby the pipeline provided the high quantitative accuracy to estimation of the bacterial composition and abundance in the community.10In this study, we applied our improved pipeline to the analysis of the human oral microbiota. The oral cavity is a large reservoir of bacteria of >700 species or phylotypes, and is profoundly relevant to host health and disease.11–14 Current studies reported that various oral symptoms such as aphthous stomatitis, oral ulcer, dry mouth, and pyostomatitis vegetans are frequently observed in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients.15–20 IBD, including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is a chronic, idiopathic, relapsing inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract.21,22 The most widely accepted mechanism of IBD pathogenesis includes inflammation due to altered host immune response in association with continuous stimulation from the resident gut microbiota.23–28 Many studies also revealed that the gut microbiota of IBD patients significantly differed from that of healthy controls (HCs), and is termed dysbiosis.29–34Similarly, oral manifestations observed in IBD patients suggest the association of oral microbiota with such manifestations, yet-limited information exists about the oral microbiota of IBD patients. We characterized the salivary microbiota of IBD patients and HCs by barcoded pyrosequencing analysis of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. We observed that the salivary microbiota in IBD patients significantly differed from that of HCs, and found particular bacterial species associated with dysbiosis. We also showed that the observed dysbiosis is strongly associated with elevated inflammatory response of several cytokines with depleted lysozyme in the saliva of IBD patients, some of which showed a strong correlation with the relative abundance of certain bacterial species. Thus, the present study demonstrates an association between dysbiosis of the salivary microbiota and change in the host's physiological state in IBD.2. Material and methods2.1. Patients and control groupsAll participants of the CD, UC, and HC groups were informed of the purpose of this study, and written consent was obtained. This project was approved by the ethical committee of University of the Ryukyus. Metadata collected at the time of sampling included various demographics and a medication history for each patient (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2).2.2. Sample collection and DNA extractionUnstimulated saliva collected from subjects was immediately frozen by liquid nitrogen and stored in -80°C until use. Salivary genomic DNA was prepared according to the literature with minor modifications.35Bacterial cells were harvested from 1 ml of saliva by centrifugation at 3300g for 10 min at 4°C. Bacterial pellets were suspended in 10 mM Tris–HCl/10 mM EDTA buffer and incubated with 15 mg/ml lysozyme (Sigma-Aldrich Co. LLC) for 1 h at 37°C. Purified achromopeptidase (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) was added to a final concentration of 2000 units/ml and samples were further incubated for 30 min. Ten percentage of (wt/vol) sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) and proteinase K (Merck Japan) were added to the suspension to final concentrations of 1% and 1 mg/ml, respectively, and samples were further incubated at 55°C for 1 h. The lysate was treated with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (Life Technologies Japan, Ltd.) and centrifuged at 3300g for 10 min. DNA was precipitated by adding 1/10 volume of 3 M sodium acetate (pH 4.5) and 2 volumes of ethanol (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) to the supernatant. DNA was pelleted by centrifugation at 3300g for 15 min at 4°C. DNA pellets were rinsed with 75% ethanol, dried and dissolved in 10 mM Tris–HCl/1 mM EDTA (TE) buffer. DNA was further treated with 1 mg/ml RNase A (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) at 37°C for 30 min, and precipitated by adding equal volumes of 20% PEG solution (PEG6000-2.5M NaCl). DNA was pelleted by centrifugation at 8060g at 4°C, rinsed twice with 75% ethanol, dried, and dissolved in TE buffer.2.3. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene-based analysisThe hypervariable V1–V2 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified by PCR with barcoded 27Fmod and 338R primers.10 PCR was performed in 50 µl of 1× Ex Taq PCR buffer composed of 10 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mM KCl, and 1.5 mM MgCl2 in the presence of 250 µM dNTP, 1 U Ex Taq polymerase (Takara Bio, Inc.), forward and reverse primers (0.2 µM) and ~20 ng template DNA. Thermal cycling consisted of initial denaturation at 96°C for 2 min, followed by 25 cycles of denaturation at 96°C for 30 s, annealing at 55°C for 45 s and extension at 72°C for 1 min, and final extension at 72°C on a 9700 PCR system (Life Technologies Japan, Ltd.). Negative controls were treated similarly, except that no template DNA was added to the PCR reactions. PCR products of ~370 bp were visualized by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels, while negative controls failed to produce visible PCR products and were excluded from further analysis. PCR amplicons were purified by AMPure XP magnetic purification beads (Beckman Coulter, Inc.), and quantified using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Assay Kit (Life Technologies Japan, Ltd.). Equal amounts of each PCR amplicon were mixed and then sequenced using either 454 GS FLX Titanium or 454 GS JUNIOR (Roche Applied Science).We developed and used an analysis pipeline for pyrosequencing data of the 16S rRNA gene V1–V2 region generated from oral microbiota. Based on sample specific barcodes, reads were assigned to each sample followed by the removal of reads lacking both forward and reverse primer sequences. Data were further denoised by removal of reads with average quality values <25 and possible chimeric sequences. For chimera checking and taxonomy assignment of the 16S rRNA data, we constructed our own databases from three publically available databases: Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) v. 10.27, CORE (http://microbiome.osu.edu/), and a reference genome sequence database obtained from the NCBI FTP site (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genbank/, December 2011). Reads having BLAST match lengths <90% with the representative sequence in the three databases were considered as chimeras and removed. Finally, filter-passed reads were used for further analysis after trimming off both primer sequences.All of the 16S rRNA sequence data used in this study were deposited in DDBJ/GenBank/EMBL under accession numbers: DRA000984–DRA000986.From the filter-passed reads, 3000 high-quality reads/sample were randomly chosen. The total reads (59 × 3000 reads) were then sorted according to average quality value and grouped into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using UCLUST (http://www.drive5.com/) with a sequence identity threshold of 96%. Taxonomic assignments were made according to the best BLAST-hit phylotype. Weighted and unweighted UniFrac metrics36 were used to assess the diversity of the salivary microbiota between the CD, UC, and HC groups. UniFrac distances were based on the fraction of branch length shared between two communities within a phylogenetic tree constructed from the 16S rRNA gene sequences from all communities being compared.2.4. ImmunoassaysThe centrifugal supernatant of unstimulated saliva was analyzed by the Luminex fluorescence technique, using the Bio-Plex Pro Human cytokine 27-Plex Assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. LL-37 (cathelicidin, hCAP-18) levels were measured by ELISA using the Human LL-37 ELISA Kit (Hycult Biotech, Uden, The Netherlands). IgA levels were measured using the EIA-sIgA Test (MBL, Nagoya, Japan). Salivary lysozyme levels were measured using turbidimetric technique (SRL Inc., Japan). Total protein concentrations were measured by the Bradford protein assay using bovine serum albumin as the standard. In this study, saliva samples of only 15 HC, 14 CD, and 10 UC subjects were used for the assay of biomarkers, because the saliva from the other subjects was insufficient for measurement of all the indicated biomarkers.2.5. Statistical analysisAll statistical analyses were conducted with R version 2.15.2. Microbial richness, evenness, and diversity were assessed using the R Vegan package. Depending on the normality of the data, the Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney's U-test was used to perform statistical analysis. P-values were corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini–Hochberg method. Correlations between relative abundance of genera and immunological markers in saliva were calculated by Pearson correlation coefficients.3. Results3.1. Collection of 16S dataWe surveyed the salivary microbiota of 21 CD patients, 14 UC patients, and 24 HCs, all of whom (including their relatives) are residents, lasting at least three generations, of the Okinawa area in Japan. The general and clinical parameters of the study populations are given in Supplementary Table S1, and individual details are shown in Supplementary Table S2. Sample-assigned pyrosequencing reads having both forward and reverse primer sequences accounted for ~60% of the total number of reads. The 16S reads having average quality values <25 and possibly chimeric sequences represented 0.75 and 0.46% of the selected dataset, respectively. Finally, 506 133 high-quality 16S reads were obtained from 59 salivary samples. Sorting of the 16S reads by average quality value prior to clustering enabled selection of the representative sequence with the highest quality value among the 16S reads grouped in each OTU. On the other hand, the primer check step for removing reads lacking both primer sequences10 had the possibility to incorrectly remove reads containing V1–V2 regions longer than the maximum length of 431 bp in the filter-passed reads. This is because there are a few species with a V1–V2 region >431 bp (e.g. Campylobacter rectus has a length of 493 bp). Our primer check step did not significantly affect the present results because only one of the 177 000 raw reads examined hit to Campylobacter. However, to avoid the incorrect filtration of reads, we modified the primer check step so as not to remove reads having a length of >400 bp, even though they may not have both primer sequences.3.2. Overall composition of the salivary bacterial communitiesWe evaluated the ecological features of the salivary bacterial communities of the CD, UC, and HC groups by a variety of indices at the OTU level.37,38 The results are summarized in Table 1. Species richness is the observed number of bacterial species assigned by OTUs detected in the samples. Richness estimates were obtained from the observed number of species by the extrapolation method using estimators such as the Chao1 and ACE indices. Evenness is the degree of homogeneity of abundance of the species detected in the samples. Diversity estimates were obtained from species richness and evenness by using several different indices, which exhibit different sensitivities to given factors, to confirm our results. The results suggested that there were no significant differences in the overall configuration of the salivary microbiota among the three groups (Table 1). OTU-based microbial richness and diversity across the HC, CD and UC groupsOTU-based microbial richness and diversity across the HC, CD and UC groupsWe then compared the overall bacterial community composition using the UniFrac distance metric, a phylogenetic tree-based metric ranging from 0 (distance between identical communities) to 1 (distance between totally different communities). A principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) plot based on the weighted UniFrac metric revealed clear clustering of most IBD samples apart from the HC samples, indicating the difference in microbial communities between the two groups (Fig. 1A). A bar chart more clearly shows the significant difference in microbiota composition between the IBD and HC groups (Fig. 1B). Comparison of the salivary microbiota of HCs with that of the CD and UC groups indicated that the microbiota of HCs significantly differs from both of them, and no significant difference was found between the UC and CD groups (Fig. 1C). Similar results were obtained using the unweighted UniFrac metric with lower statistical significance than that of the weighted UniFrac metric (Supplementary Fig. S1). These data suggest that species abundance, rather than species diversity, largely contributes to the observed differences in salivary microbiota between the HC and IBD groups.

Moreover, there was no significant difference between the two IBD subgroups. These data suggest that age might not affect the observed dysbiosis of the salivary microbiota of the IBD patients.3.3. Differences in salivary microbiota composition between the HC, CD, and UC groupsThe final dataset of the examined CD, UC, and HC groups (n = 59) consisted of 177 000 reads and included representatives of 12 bacterial phyla (Fig. 2; Supplementary Fig. S3 and Table S3). The majority of the 16S reads were classified into only five phyla: Firmicutes (46.5%), Bacteroidetes (22.3%), Actinobacteria (13.7%), Proteobacteria (12.5%), and Fusobacteria (4.2%). TM7, SR1, Spirochaetes, Synergistetes, Tenericutes, and Cyanobacteria were also detected and collectively represented <1% of the total reads analyzed. Analysis at the phylum level showed that the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes was significantly higher in both the CD and UC groups as compared with HCs (P < 0.01), while that of Proteobacteria was significantly lower in both the CD and UC groups as compared with HCs (P < 0.01). No significant difference at the phylum level was observed between the UC and CD groups, which was consistent with the results of the UniFrac distance analysis.

Bar charts show the relative abundance of different phyla across the CD, UC and HC samples. Asterisks indicate samples taken during the active phase of CD. Dagger indicates anti-TNF-a antibody treated CD.In total, 107 bacterial genera were identified (at 95% identity), accounting for 97.8% of the total dataset. The remaining unclassified sequences (2.2%) were assigned to higher level taxa. Fourteen genera, including Streptococcus, Prevotella, Rothia, Neisseria, Granulicatella, Actinomyces, Haemophilus, Veillonella, Gemella, Leptotrichia, Fusobacterium, Porphyromonas, Uncultured Lachnospiraceae, and Oribacterium, predominated accounting for 92.7% of the total dataset. Other genera represented <0.5% each (Fig. 3; Supplementary Table S3). Two genera, Prevotella (phy. Bact.) and Veillonella (phy. Firm.), were significantly higher in both the CD and UC groups compared with HCs (P < 0.01). Two genera, Streptococcus (phy. Firm.) and Haemophilus (phy. Prot.), were significantly lower in both the CD and UC groups as compared with HCs (P < 0.05 and 0.01, respectively). Two other genera, Neisseria (phy. Prot.) and Gemella (phy. Firm.), were also found to be significantly lower only in the CD group as compared with HCs (P < 0.01 and 0.001, respectively). These results indicate that the relative increase of Bacteroidetes in IBD patients was mainly due to the increase of Prevotella, and the relative decrease of Proteobacteria in IBD patients was mainly due to the decrease of Neisseria and Haemophilus. No significant difference in the relative abundance of either Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria was observed among the three groups (Supplementary Table S3).

Welch's test with BH adjustment was used; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001; mean ± s.e.m.Clustering of all reads using a 96% pairwise-identity cutoff generated 1257 OTUs, of which only 40 OTUs represented 67.2% of the total reads analyzed. The remaining OTUs were present at relative abundance levels <0.5% of the total dataset (Supplementary Table S4). The relative abundance of several OTUs belonging to the genera Streptococcus, Prevotella, Veillonella, Nesisseria, Haemophilus, and Gemella showed significant differences in IBD patients as compared with HCs. These results were concordant with those detected at the genus level. Among the abundant OTUs, those most closely assigned to Prevotella melaninogenica, Veillonella sp. oral taxon 158, Streptococcus mitis, Gemella sanguinis, Neisseria mucosa, and Haemophilus parainfluenzae showed significant differences in relative abundance between the HC and IBD groups (Supplementary Table S4).3.4. Salivary immunological biomarkers in the HC, CD, and UC groupsWe evaluated the inflammatory state, considering its influence on shaping the salivary microbiota, in saliva of the CD and UC patients as compared with that of HCs. The analysis was performed by measuring secretory IgA, cytokines, and enzymes including lysozyme in unstimulated saliva of 15 HC, 14 CD, and 10 UC individuals (Supplementary Table S5 and Fig. S4). There was no significant difference in the total protein concentration in saliva of the CD and UC patients as compared with that of HCs (P = 0.112 and 0.192, respectively). The lysozyme level was significantly lower in saliva of both the CD and UC groups as compared with HCs (P < 0.01). On the other hand, the levels of IgA and LL37 in both CD and UC groups were higher than that of HCs with statistical significance. The use of Luminex technology was highly sensitive in measuring cytokines from small volumes of saliva samples. In saliva of the CD and UC groups, the level of IL-1ß was significantly higher as compared with HCs (P < 0.05 and <0.01, respectively). The levels of IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1 were significantly higher only in saliva of the UC group, while elevated TNF-a level was found only in the CD group with statistical significance. The levels of IgA and MCP-1 in the UC group were significantly higher than those in the CD group. These data indicate that the oral cavity of IBD patients is usually in the inflammatory state, and the levels tend to be slightly higher in the UC group than the CD group.3.5. Composition of the salivary microbiota in relation to immunological biomarkersWe searched for correlations between the relative abundance of dominant bacterial genera and the measured biomarkers in the saliva of 39 subjects (Supplementary Table S5). The results are shown in Fig. 4. The relative abundance of Streptococcus negatively correlates with IL-1ß and IL-8 (r = -0.54 and -0.51, respectively, P < 0.001), while it positively correlates with lysozyme (r = 0.63, P < 0.001). On the other hand, the abundance of Prevotella positively correlates with IL-1ß (r = 0.58, P < 0.001) but negatively correlates with lysozyme (r = -0.54, P < 0.01). The relative abundance of Veillonella negatively correlates with lysozyme (r = -0.54, P < 0.001), while Haemophilus positively correlates with lysozyme (r = 0.58, P < 0.001). Linear regressions also validated correlations between the relative abundance of Streptococcus and Prevotella and the levels of lysozyme and IL-1ß, and between the relative abundance of Veillonella and Haemophilus and the level of lysozyme (Supplementary Fig. S5). On the whole, Prevotella, Actinomyces, Veillonella, and Lachnospiracea tended to positively correlate, while Streptococcus, Rothia, Neisseria, Haemophilus, and Gemella tended to negatively correlate with elevated cytokines in saliva of IBD patients.

Validation of 16S pyrosequencing data by targeted quantitative PCRWe designed specific PCR primers for quantitative PCR (qPCR) targeting genomes of P. melaninogenica and H. parainfluenzae, which showed significant differences between HCs and IBD patients by 16S pyrosequencing analysis (Supplementary Table S4). Using these primers, we found strong correlations between 16S-based and qPCR data for the quantification of P. melaninogenica (r = 0.87, P < 0.001) and H. parainfluenzae (r = 0.86, P < 0.001), indicating the quantitative accuracy of our 16S pyrosequencing-based results (Fig. 5).

Bacterial 16S rRNA-based pyrosequencing analysisIn this study, we used targeted amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene hypervariable V1–V2 region to evaluate bacterial composition at finer taxonomic levels. The use of primer 27Fmod enabled us to reduce underestimation of the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium species that predominate human microbiota, and thus the quantitative accuracy of the overall bacterial composition was greatly improved.10,39 One limitation of clustering the 16S reads using the UCLUST program is selection of the representative sequence for each OTU. The quality of the representative sequence is not always the highest in the OTU, which affects the BLAST identity, E-value and score, sometimes providing inappropriate results for taxonomic assignment of the OTUs. We overcame this limitation by sorting the 16S reads by their average quality values prior to clustering, leading to 16S reads with the highest quality being selected as the representative sequence for each OTU. Our 16S-based results were also validated by strongly correlating with the qPCR data targeting bacterial species showing significant changes between HC and IBD samples (Fig. 5). In addition, clustering of the reads was performed with a 96% pairwise-identity cutoff to reduce overestimation of the number of bacterial species (or OTUs) largely due to 454 pyrosequencing errors.10,40 Clustering with a 96% pairwise-identity cutoff should be applied for pyrosequencing reads obtained from other types of human microbiota.4.2. Salivary microbiota composition in IBD patientsThe abundant bacterial groups in the salivary microbiota detected in this study were similar to those previously reported,41–44 but the compositions differed from those observed in plaque microbiota.44 Our data clearly showed a significant difference in salivary microbiota composition between HCs and IBD patients. Shifts in oral microbiota composition were also observed in several oral manifestations such as dental caries,45 periodontitis,46 and oral squamous cell carcinoma.47 Moreover, various components of the oral microbiota have been implicated in systemic diseases such as pancreatic disease including pancreatic cancer,48 atherosclerosis,49 bacteremia,50 and endocarditis.51Altered bacterial community structure in the gut microbiota of IBD patients is a common finding in comparison with that of healthy subjects. Previous studies showed overall structural changes as well as reduced species richness of the gut microbiota in IBD patients.29–33 It is likely that the high microbial richness and diversity characterizing healthy microbiota may have a protective effect on humans. Unlike the gut microbiota of IBD patients, our estimates using several metrics revealed that microbial richness and diversity in the salivary microbiota of IBD patients was similar to that of HCs, despite significant changes in community structure (Fig. 1). These data suggest that the extent of the changes in the salivary microbiota is less than that in the gut microbiota of IBD patients.Our data indicated a significant increase of the genus Prevotella in the salivary microbiota of IBD patients, in which its relative abundance was almost equivalent to that of reduced Streptococcus, which is most abundant in healthy salivary microbiota (Fig. 3). Prevotella is a Gram-negative, obligate anaerobe, and a member of the prevalent genera in the human microbiome.52 Some Prevotella species were similarly increased, distinguishable from opportunistic infections, in bacterial vaginosis,53 esophagitis,54 antral gastritis,55 and saliva of caries-active subjects.45 These data suggest that the increase of Prevotella, with concurrently decreased Streptococcus, is clearly related with abnormal physiologies in IBD patients. The relative abundance of total Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria showed no significant difference between HCs and IBD patients (Supplementary Table S3). From these results, Gram-stain properties of bacterial surface structures may not be related with dysbiosis of IBD salivary microbiota, unlike the association of Gram-negative oral bacteria with dysbiosis observed in subgingival microbiota in periodontitis.564.3. Salivary microbiota associated with immunological biomarkersSaliva contains a variety of components such as cytokines, immunoglobulins, and antimicrobial proteins involved in host defence mechanisms for maintaining oral and systemic health.57 Alteration of the salivary microbiota in IBD patients suggests the occurrence of inflammatory immune responses in the oral cavity of IBD patients as intestinal inflammation associated with aberrant gut microbiota of IBD.23–26 Our data showed that the levels of many salivary cytokines and IgA were significantly higher in both CD and UC patients than those observed in HCs, indicating that inflammatory responses are elicited in the oral cavity of the patients. Similarly, elevated salivary IL-1ß, IL-6, and TNF-a levels in CD patients and an elevated IL-8 level in the saliva of patients with bowel disease were also reported.58,59 Unexpectedly, the elevated level of inflammatory biomarkers in UC patients was similar to or slightly higher than that observed in CD patients, regardless of differences in disease states between IBD patients (Supplementary Fig. S4 and Table S5). Salivary IgA induction was observed in CD patients with oral symptoms but not in those without oral symptoms.60 The elevated level of IgA in most IBD patients’ saliva examined suggests that those patients may have oral manifestations, however, we did not have access to their oral health clinical records.Salivary lysozyme levels were significantly reduced in both CD and UC patients as compared with that of HCs. Lysozyme is an antimicrobial protein, expressed by various cells including neutrophils, macrophages, and epithelial cells. It is abundant in saliva and plays an important role in the host constitutive defence system.61 It has been reported that salivary lysozyme was significantly lower in patients with gingivitis and periodontitis as compared with healthy subjects.62 In contrast, faecal lysozyme levels were significantly elevated in IBD patients.63 Further analysis will be required to elucidate the difference in lysozyme levels between saliva and the intestine.Lysozyme exclusively catalyses hydrolysis of Gram-positive bacterial cell wall. However, lysozyme can also be bactericidal for Gram-negative bacteria in vivo through synergistic action with salivary lactoferrin in the normal state.64 Therefore, this in vitro specificity of lysozyme activity may not be largely involved in the dysbiosis of salivary microbiota in IBD patients, in which the abundance of Gram-positive bacteria was not significantly different as compared with HCs (Supplementary Table S3).There were several subgroups of patients dependent on different medical treatments, and patients with different states of disease (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). In addition, Infliximab (anti-TNF-a antibody) therapy is commonly used for IBD patients, but up to one-third of the patients have been shown not to respond.65 Therefore, it was very difficult to precisely evaluate the differences in microbiota structure and biomarker levels between the subgroups. Nevertheless, phylogenetic analysis based on the weighted UniFrac distance metric did not show discrete clustering of particular subgroups, such as CD patients with or without Infliximab treatment and active CD, or CD in remission, suggesting limited contributions from the patients' disease state or medical treatment to the overall microbiota structure (Fig. 2).Strong correlations between some inflammatory biomarkers and salivary microbiota compositions were revealed (Fig. 4). The lower lysozyme and elevated IL-1ß, IL-8, IgA and several other biomarkers were likely to be synergistically or interactively associated with the abundance of the four dominant genera, Streptococcus, Prevotella, Veillonella, and Haemophilus. Interactions between these microbes and other species may also be involved in the dysbiosis of salivary microbiota of IBD patients.Finally, it is still unknown whether the inflammatory state in the oral cavity of IBD patients is the cause or a consequence of imbalances in the salivary microbiota, and which local (the oral cavity) or systemic (the gut) immune response is more responsible for the observed dysbiosis of salivary microbiota. Our results strongly suggest the existence of certain defined mechanisms by which aberrant, but similar, salivary microbiota among IBD patients is formed. The human gut microbiota is gradually shaped to its matured assemblage in a few years after birth, with temporal changes in the diversity and rank of dominant species largely dependent on diet and host physiological state.66 Salivary microbiota may also be established similar to gut microbiota. Since >1000 ml of saliva is produced per day in the average adult and it always flows into the gastrointestinal tract, bacteria in saliva also have many opportunities to reach the intestine. Therefore, it can be postulated that salivary microbiota affects the development of gut microbiota to some extent. To evaluate this hypothesis, it is necessary to investigate the progression of infant salivary microbiota and the oral inflammatory state. Additionally, further studies such as comparison of the salivary microbiota between IBD and other diseases will provide informative sources for discovering non-invasive salivary biomarkers specific to IBD.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported in part by the global COE project of ‘Genome Information Big Bang’ from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT) of Japan to M.H. and K.O., a research project grant from Azabu University to H.M., a grant from the Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST) program of the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) to K.O., and Scientific Research B (No. 22370087) to H.I. and (Nos. 21370108 and 24370099) to H.O. from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS).

Although AS is common in higher plants and animals, its prevalence in other eukaryotes is mostly unknown. In fungi the involvement of AS in gene expression and its effect on multi-cellularity and virulence is of great medical and economic interest. We present a genome-wide comparative study of AS in 23 informative fungi of different taxa, based on alignments of public transcript sequences. Random sampling of expressed sequence tags allows for robust and comparable estimations of AS rates. We find that a greater fraction of fungal genes than previously expected is associated with AS. We estimate that on average, 6.4% of the annotated genes are affected by AS, with Cryptococcus neoformans showing an extraordinary rate of 18%. The investigated Basidiomycota show higher average AS rates (8.6%) than the Ascomycota (6.0%), although not significant. We find that multi-cellular complexity and younger evolutionary age associate with higher AS rates. Furthermore, AS affects genes involved in pathogenic lifestyle, particularly in functions of stress response and dimorphic switching. Together, our analysis strongly supports the view that AS is a rather common phenomenon in fungi and associates with higher multi-cellular complexity.1. IntroductionVia alternative splicing (AS) different mRNA isoforms are produced from one single gene. This diversification is one explanation for the discrepancy between the relatively low gene numbers of higher eukaryotes on the one hand and their cellular complexity on the other hand. AS affects binding properties, intracellular localization, enzymatic activity and many more properties of proteins.1 Examples of regulated pathways are sex determination in Drosophila melanogaster,2 neuronal differentiation in rat3 and auto-regulation of LAMMER kinases, which take part in splicing factor activation.4 Not only the mere presence of an isoform, but also the exact splice isoform ratio can influence the phenotype of cells and can be regulated in a tissue-dependent manner.5Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) have widely been used to detect AS and quantify the transcript diversity arising from AS. For example, AS estimates for animals range from 53% of the multi-exon genes in human, 53% in mouse, 24% in rat, 22% in chicken, 19% in fruit fly to 6% in roundworm.6 Interestingly, despite their relatedness, the estimates for mouse and rat differ remarkably. A possible reason for this are too few transcript data that limit the detection of AS events. Therefore, an approach was suggested that corrects for the amounts of transcripts and yields similar AS rates of ~31% for mouse and rat.7 Finally, from deep transcriptome sequencing an AS rate of >90% was estimated for humans.8 These findings support the view that sensitive methods will ultimately detect splicing variants for every multi-exon gene.9The basic AS types are the following: in exon skipping (SE, cassette exon), the exon can be spliced out of the transcript together with its flanking introns.10 Alternative 5' splice site (A5'SS, alternative donor) selection11 and alternative 3' splice site (A3'SS, alternative acceptor) selection12 result in longer exons and corresponding isoforms.13 Intron retention describes a mechanism where an intron can remain in the mature mRNA.14 Previous studies showed that eukaryote species do not have equal distributions of these AS types. Cassette exons predominantly occur in animals, whereas intron retention is more frequent in other taxa.15Fungi, especially Saccharomyces cerevisiae, have been used extensively as a reduced and easily manageable model system in biological research. There are many fungi that cause human and plant diseases (Supplementary Table S1), which provoke worldwide costs of several billion dollars a year. Other fungi are used for industrial fermentation and production of food and feed additives or are crucial in the degradation of xenobiotics and in the conversion of cellulose into biofuels (Supplementary Table S1). Fungi have compact genomes (the majority 10–90 Mbp) and genes with small introns. They also show extended consensus sequences for the 5'SS and the branchpoint region.16 These features facilitate a structural interpretation of intron sequences, and they suggest low-complex AS patterns, both of which make fungi attractive models for mechanistic studies of (alternative) splicing.A few studies estimated fungal AS rates on a genome-wide scale in comparative manner. Varying but relatively low AS frequencies were discovered in fungi and microsporidia (0–5% of genes in S. cerevisiae, Schizosaccharo-myces pombe, Encephalitozoon cuniculi and Cryptococcus neoformans).17 A correspondence between intron numbers per gene and AS numbers was found for the studied species. Also, AS seems to affect genes of different functions. Genes associated with regulation have higher AS levels. Evolutionarily old genes were found to be affected more often.17 In another comparative study of 14 fungi among other eukaryotes, also varying amounts of AS were observed. Yeasts showed nearly no events, and around 1000 AS instances were found for C. neoformans and Coccidioides posadasii, each.15 Studies of single fungal species show results from only a few AS events in Magnaporthe grisea18 to rates of 8.6% in Aspergillus oryzae19 and 4.2% in C. neoformans.20 Remarkably, Ho et al.21 estimate an AS rate for Ustilago maydis of 26% in a subset of multi-exon genes that have support by at least two ESTs.So far, AS research was mainly focused on animals and plants. With this study, we give a comprehensive report on fungi as the third eukaryote crown group. The comparability of the previous results on fungal AS is hampered due to the application of different biochemical and computational strategies. Thus, we undertook a systematic genome-wide comparative analysis of AS in 23 informative fungal species. The basis of our analysis are alignments of transcript sequences to genome sequences, and an AS rate estimation similar to that of Kim et al.72. Materials and methods2.1. Data sources and preparationWe downloaded chromosomal sequences, reference transcripts and gene annotations of 25 species (26 different strains) from NCBI's GenBank, RefSeq and EntrezGene databases, respectively.22 These data were complemented with most up-to-date sequences and annotations of Pichia stipitis (Joint Genome Institute23) and S. cerevisiae (Saccharomyces genome database24). Genome sequences and annotations of further three species (five strains) were from the Broad Institute (Fusarium oxysporum, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis Pb01, Pb03 and Pb18, Rhizopus oryzae25) and for further three species from the Joint Genome Institute (Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Trichoderma reesei, Mycosphaerella graminicola23). ESTs for all species were downloaded from NCBI's dbEST database, except for Arthroderma benhamiae, where Roche 454 data are from NCBI's SRA.22 Four species were excluded from the analysis because there were <200 ESTs. This yielded 27 species (30 strains) with sufficient data (Table 1). We masked low-complexity repeats from the genome sequences using the program RepeatMasker (Smit et al., unpublished). We removed sequence contamination, low-quality and low-complexity sequences from the ESTs using SeqClean (unpublished, ‘The Gene Index Project’ of Harvard University). Roche 454 reads were additionally cleaned for adapter stretches using in-house software. Annotation, EST mapping and AS data of the studied speciesNote, for P. brasiliensis and C. neoformans the same EST data were used for all strains, and hence, the same EST statistics come about.

Transcriptome-genome alignments and splice site conservationSpliced transcript-genome alignments were built in two steps: ESTs were mapped with Blat26 to obtain first rough guide alignments. The best Blat hits were further splice aligned with exalin.27 To use SS information as additional input for exalin, we prepared a scoring matrix based on SS consensi from Neurospora crassa as suggested by Zhang et al. Since SSs are conserved among fungi, this model was used for the analysis of all species. Alignments were filtered for minimal score (20 bits), mismatches (=10%, no mismatches in 5 nt region of SSs) and minimum length of exons and introns (6 and 40 nt, respectively). Only alignments with SSs from canonical (GT|AG) or well-accepted non-canonical (GC|AG, AT|AC) classes16 were considered for further analysis.SS sequence conservation was calculated as information content per position.28 To this end, we extracted the sequence from -4 to +7 nt from the exon–intron boundary, and the region from -4 to +4 nt from the intron–exon boundary. We used the upstream boundary of alternative 3' SSs and the downstream boundary of alternative 5' SSs.2.3. Detection of ASCustom Perl scripts were used to analyse filtered transcript-genome alignments for four AS events: exon skipping (cassette exon), alternative 5'SS and alternative 3'SS selection and intron retention. Using splice positions (genomic starts and ends of exons and introns) we compared the positions between all exons and introns to find overlaps and identify the basic AS types. AS events were predicted based on EST discrepancies only, not on discrepancies between ESTs and annotations. To account for the limited sequence data used in our analysis, one EST was considered sufficient to support an mRNA isoform. Constitutively spliced exons and introns were defined as not having support of AS at a minimum coverage of 10 ESTs.2.4. Random sampling of transcripts and per-gene AS ratesRandom sampling was done for each genomic location with n = 2 aligned transcripts. We randomly drew a defined number of transcripts and estimated the AS rate. To do so, AS events were assigned to genes based on mapping coordinates, and the number of AS affected genes was divided by the overall number of genes detected by random sampling. Then, we multiplied the AS rates with the number of genes having introns (potential AS candidates) divided by the number of all genes. This yielded whole genome AS rate estimations. This procedure was repeated 20 times to calculate a mean AS rate estimation. The procedure was done with different sampling depths, drawing 2–10 ESTs per locus. Due to a low EST coverage, loci with a higher coverage than 10 ESTs are rare for most analysed species. Thus, to avoid a bias towards highly expressed genes, results from lower sampling depths were kept in sampling repeats with higher sampling depths. That is, sampling depth i means to draw at most i ESTs from a locus. Pearson's product moment and its corresponding significance test was used to assess the correlation between AS rates and number of mapped ESTs (based on Student's t-test, assuming normal distribution of the data, R version 2.12.129). Four species were excluded from correlation analysis because <5% of their annotated genes were covered by the sampled ESTs (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S2): Aspergillus oryzae, Chaeto-mium globosum, Fusarium oxysporum, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum.2.5. Functional gene annotations and enrichment statisticsGenes were searched for protein domain motifs using HMMER330 (e-value < 0.01) together with the Pfam database (release 24). Alternatively, Pfam domain annotations were downloaded from the Broad Institute (Fusarium sp., Paracoccidioides sp., R. oryzae). Associations between Pfam domains and AS were tested using the following model: per species, all genes that have at least two EST hits are taken into consideration with their Pfam assignment and number of introns. Thereof, all introns are assumed to have an equal, species-specific probability p to be alternatively spliced, as averaged from the empirical data. The probability P(g<U+2208>AS) that a gene with n introns is alternatively spliced is calculated as P(g<U+2208> AS) = 1 - (1 - p)n.Then, the expected number of alternatively spliced genes coding a certain Pfam is calculated by cumulation: Exp(nAS,Pfam) = SP(gi <U+2208> AS).The distribution of nAS,Pfam was obtained from Monte Carlo simulation of the cumulation terms (n = 106). Binomial rather than hypergeometric simulation of P(gi <U+2208> AS) simplified the calculations and yielded a slightly wider distribution, resulting in conservative estimates of the distribution quantiles. Correction for multiple testing was done using the Bonferroni method.3. Results3.1. Mining of introns and splicing signalsThe number of available ESTs per species varies in a wide range (1557–1 040 774). To detect AS, at least two transcripts per locus are needed, i.e. one for each of at least two splicing isoforms. We find that, depending on the species, 0–100% of the annotated introns are overlapped by at least two ESTs (25% on average over all fungi; Supplementary Table S2), and 1–86% of genes are overlapped by at least two ESTs (28% on average; Table 1 and Supplementary Table S2). Per species, 98–100% of the detected introns per species harbour typical SSs (GT|AG), whereas non-canonical SSs (GC|AG, AT|AC) are rare (0–2%), in accordance with a previous study on fungi.16 The sets of reliable genomic intron and exon coordinates were subsequently examined for AS events.3.2. Whole genome AS ratesThe numbers of detected AS events strongly depend on the numbers of available ESTs (Supplementary Fig. S1a; Pearson correlation coefficient r = 0.82, P-value 1.8 × 10-6). A very high coverage of introns with ESTs, especially when using next generation transcriptome sequencing, can reveal even very rare events that may partly represent splicing noise of the cell. This can lead to overestimation of AS propensity of a species. On the other hand, an uneven genomic distribution of transcripts leads to an under-sampling of the genome-wide splice isoforms. To circumvent these pitfalls, we applied a random sampling strategy, similar to the one of Kim et al.7 to obtain AS rate estimations that are independent of EST amounts and distributions. We left out species where <5% of multi-exon genes were covered by the sampled ESTs for estimation of whole genome AS rates (last column Supplementary Table S2). For them we do not expect the estimations to be reliable enough. We mapped the AS events that were recovered by random sampling to genomic locations of annotated genes to calculate AS rates per gene. We found that the correlation between these AS rates and the EST numbers is clearly reduced (r = 0.16, P-value = 0.46, Supplementary Fig. S1b). Thus, random sampling gives AS rate estimates that are comparable between species.The more ESTs were sampled from a genomic location (sampling depth) the higher is the chance of finding AS events (Supplementary Fig. S2). We decided to sample up to 10 ESTs per locus to reduce the chance of sampling rare events and, thus, overestimation of AS capacities. The reduced gains of AS rates with higher sampling depth support this decision (decreasing slopes of curves in Supplementary Fig. S2). Thus, the following results refer to a sampling depth of 10 ESTs, if not stated differently.6.4% of fungal genes are affected by AS when averaging on species level (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S2). Excluding ascomycetous yeasts (P. stipitis, S. cerevisiae and S. pombe 0.26% AS affected genes), the rate is 7.3%. Coccidioides immitis and C. neoformans show outstanding AS rates of 13 and 18/20%, respectively (strains JEC21 and B-3501A). The relative proportions of the AS types averaged over all species, in the order of frequency are: intron retention 61%, alternative 3' SSs 23%, alternative 5' SSs 13% and skipped exons 3% (Fig. 1a). We only took into account strains B-3501A and Pb01 from C. neoformans and P. brasiliensis, respectively, for mean value calculation.

Pie portions: intron retention (IR), skipped exons (SE), alternative 5' splice sites (A5'SS) and 3' splice sites (A3'SS). Only the 23 informative fungi are considered, i.e. those where AS rates could be estimated (cf. Table 1). Only non-yeasts are considered in chart 1B (17 ascomycetes - 3 yeasts = 14).3.3. Validation of retained intronsAn alternative explanation for detected retained introns (RIs) would be the presence of unprocessed pre-mRNA in the sequenced samples or a contamination with DNA. First of all, the EST libraries used for this study were all prepared from total RNA and enriched for poly(A)-mRNA. This makes DNA contamination very unlikely. To further validate the detected RIs, we assessed the number of RI-supporting ESTs that have been already processed in the following way. For each species, we counted the number of RIs where at least one EST of the isoform that harbours the RI supports a spliced intron at another EST position. For all species with RIs, between 74 and 100% (average 96%) of those isoforms contain a processed intron (details see Supplementary Table S3). This clearly indicates that most RIs are authentic RNA events.3.4. Correlations of AS rates and genomic featuresWe calculated the correlations between genome and splicing quantities. We find a strong correlation (r = 0.73, P-value 8.8 × 10-5) between the number of EST-covered introns and the number of RIs across the species. This hints at fungal introns to have a certain chance per se to be retained in an alternative manner. In contrast, there is only a slight and barely significant correlation of the extrapolated genome-wide AS numbers with gene numbers (r = 0.41, P = 0.0502) and with genome size in nucleotides (r = 0.53, P = 0.009). Further, there is no correlation of the AS rate per gene with gene numbers (r = -0.05, P = 0.82) nor with genome size (r = 0.12, P = 0.57). Nonetheless, the small genome sizes (in base pairs and gene numbers) of the yeasts S. cerevisiae, S. pombe and P. stipitis coincide with their clearly reduced AS propensity.3.5. Intron retention is the major AS type in fungiIntron retention makes up two-thirds of the AS events in the investigated fungi. This also holds for each fungal group separately. We investigated the properties of affected introns and their aberration from constitutively spliced ones. We find that RIs are shorter (89 nt) than constitutively spliced introns (93 nt), on average across all species, though not significant (Mann–Whitney U-test, P = 0.211, n = 5665/23 268). Neither constitutively spliced nor RIs tend to preserve the reading frame. That is, in both sets, intron lengths are distributed evenly over the three possible remainders of division by three. Constitutively spliced introns: remainder zero, 32%; remainder one, 34%; remainder two, 34%; RIs: 33, 34 and 33%, respectively.3.6. Varying alternative splice propensity is taxon-dependentWe summarized and averaged the resampled AS rates into two different fungal taxa (see a species tree in Fig. 2). On average in Basidiomycota more genes are affected by AS (8.6%) than in Ascomycota (7.2% w/o ascomycetous yeasts, Mann–Whitney U-test, not significant, n = 5/14). Without the species showing outlying AS rates (C. immitis, P. brasiliensis, C. neoformans), the rates for Basidiomycota (6.1%) and Ascomycota (4.9%) are still different. Basidio-mycota and Ascomycota have very similar AS type proportions, with Basidiomycota showing slightly more RIs and less alternative 5' SSs (Fig. 1). In both cases RIs make up around two-thirds of all AS events while skipped exons are only marginally present. The ascomycetous yeasts of our study (P. stipitis, S. cerevisiae and S. pombe) show an AS rate of 0.26% on average, which is significantly lower than the rate of the other Ascomycota (Mann–Whitney U-test, P-value 0.003, n = 3/14). An explanation for this difference may be deviations in structural gene properties that influence splicing. We find that Basidiomycota have on average shorter constitutively spliced introns (86 nt) than Ascomycota (96 nt, Mann–Whitney U-test, P < 2.2 × 10-16, n = 5205/17 936), and also shorter RIs (72 nt vs. 95 nt, P < 2.2 × 10-16, n = 1545/4093). Considering the ascomycetous yeasts separately, they show on average 326-nt long constitutively spliced introns and 132-nt long RIs, though it should be noted that yeast RI data are only based on five introns. In contrast, the one Mucoromycotina (formerly Zygomycota) R. oryzae has very short constitutively spliced introns (61 nt) and RIs (54 nt). Species tree.

Species' lifestyles are colour coded: human pathogens, black; plant pathogens, dark gray; non-pathogenic fungi, light gray. Yeasts are underlined.To further support the idea of the influence of gene properties on taxon-dependent AS frequencies, we compared the average conservation of SS motifs (Supplementary Fig. S3a and b). Sequence conservation in terms of information content can be considered as a proxy for SS fidelity. We find that ascomycetous retained as well as constitutively spliced introns show higher SS conservation than the corresponding basidiomycetous ones (not significant, Mann–Whitney U-test, all P > 0.08). The one Mucoromycotina, R. oryzae, has higher SS conservation in both types of introns than the Basidiomycota, yet cannot clearly be distinguished from Ascomycota in this respect. Yeasts show the highest SS conservation. However, the number of sampled yeasts and Basidiomycota are very small so that only 5'SSs of yeast RIs are significantly more highly conserved than 5'SSs of basidiomycetous RIs (P = 0.036, n = 2 yeasts (yeast P. stipitis contributes no RIs), 5 Basidiomycota).3.7. Functional characterization of ASTo study the function of fungal AS we analysed annotated and predicted Pfam domains for all genes and their relations to the AS rate of the gene families. We pooled all data and asked if particular Pfam domains are associated with higher AS rates. In a neutral model, AS is homogeneously distributed over all introns. Based on this model, we calculated the expected fraction of AS-associated genes per Pfam domain and compared it with the observed AS fraction. Together, six significantly AS-enriched Pfam gene families were identified (Supplementary Table S4). Two are ribosomal genes (PF01479, PF01599) and two are genes involved in thiamine biosynthesis (PF09084, PF01946). We note that these gene families show particularly high expression rates (on average, EST coverage is 34, compared with 0.6 for a non-AS-enriched control group). Since ESTs are the primary evidence for AS, and the detection rate of AS increases with EST coverage, it is well possible that the high expression rates alone account for the Pfam-AS association in these gene groups.Apart from these, the other two significantly AS-enriched Pfam gene families are fungi specific (PF08520, PF12586) with unknown domain function. Remarkably, domain PF12586 occurs only in Cryptococcus. The next Pfam gene family with a known function, though below global significance (P = 0.35 with Bonferroni correction), is PF03073 and comprises integral membrane proteins that act as negative regulators of gene expression in response to oxygen or light (Supplementary Table S5).3.8. AS is associated with dimorphic switch and pathogenicityComparing AS rates of pathogenic and non-pathogenic fungi, we found interesting aspects: the rate in pathogenic species is higher (7.6%) than in non-pathogenic species (5.1%). Considering only human pathogens, the rate of 10.7% is even more striking, yet the differences are not significant (Mann–Whitney U-test, all P-values >0.09, n = 11 non-pathogenic, 6 human pathogenic).The Pfam domain descriptions of the AS affected genes pointed to an involvement in stress response to an altering environment as it occurs during host infection: heat shock proteins, chaperone/chaperonin. These proteins mediate stress response, for example thermo-tolerance in mammalian hosts.32 Furthermore, AS-affected genes are often related to availability of copper, which is typical when penetrating human host tissue: multi-copper oxidase and CTR copper transporter family. Glucuronoxylomannan, the predominant capsular polysaccharide in C. neoformans, experiences a structural change during dimorphic switching. Thus, the capsule surface changes, which results in a reduced recognition by the host's immune system.33 We identified homologues of the proteins involved in the production and modification of glucuronoxylomannan for all investigated fungi via sequence similarity using BLASTP. Four of these proteins do show AS association, namely RIs, two in C. neoformans JEC21 and two in C. neoformans B-3501A. Three are hypothetical proteins harbouring a glycosyltransferase GTB or CAP59 mtransfer region. Two are annotated as mannosyltransferase 1 (Supple-mentary Table S6). However, the predicted homologues are not significantly enriched in AS association (hypergeometric test, P > 0.1).Another virulence factor is the adaptation of a fungus to the altered environment of the host tissue. Up-regulation of oxidative and heat shock stress associated genes as tps1, hsp30 and ddr48 in P. brasiliensis P01 likely convey to cope with this micro-niche climate.34 The identified homologues of these 3 genes are frequently affected by AS in pathogenic fungi (15 cases) and 5 times in non-pathogenic fungi (Supplementary Table S7). Among the Tps1 homologues are genes from C. neoformans B-3501A and JEC21, one of P. anserina and one of T. reesei, an alpha,alpha-trehalose-phosphate synthase Tps1 subunit of L. bicolor and a hypothetical protein similar to alpha,alpha-trehalose-phosphate synthase subunit TPS3 of N. crassa. Some of the genes are affected by multiple AS events. The AS-associated Hsp30 homologues are three chaperones/small heat shock proteins from C. immitis, L. bicolor and U. maydis. Finally, Ddr48-homologues with AS association are hypothetical/predicted proteins of C. immitis, A. capsulatus, C. neoformans and M. graminicola, two of which have a predicted function: ‘similar to potential stress response protein’, and ‘Glycosyltrans-ferase GTB type’. These stress response-related proteins are significantly enriched in AS association (hypergeometric test, P = 0.00022).4. Discussion4.1. AS rate estimationWe here presented a comparative genome-wide survey of AS in the fungal kingdom. We based our survey mainly on Sanger-sequenced EST data (one species' ESTs are from 454 sequencing) and corresponding annotated genomes. In current AS studies, often next generation transcriptome sequence data with millions of short ESTs are used. However, though for some fungi, these data are available, the other prerequisite of having a well-annotated genome is rarely fulfilled. According to our results, next generation sequencing technologies with EST lengths of >200 nt (met by Roche 454 as well as Illumina/Solexa platforms) should be well feasible for the detection of the basic AS types in fungi. This is because the read length is clearly longer than the average fungal intron and exon lengths (constitutively spliced introns 93 nt and exons 132 nt).The alignment of transcript sequences to genomes is currently the most effective way to detect alterations of mature mRNA at a large scale. However, Fox-Walsh and Hertel9 argued that every multi-exon gene has a certain AS frequency, and the detection of an alternative isoform is a matter of sensitivity of the method applied. Thus, we here use a random sampling approach similar to the one by Kim et al.7 This universal normalization approach led to AS rate estimates that are independent of the number and distribution of the ESTs, and thus, are more comparable across species. We found AS events in every of the 27 studied fungi except one (P. stipitis), with an average rate of 6.4% of genes. Thus, we suppose that AS is a common phenomenon in the fungal kingdom. Coccidioides imitis and C. neoformans show outstanding AS rates of 13 and 18%, the latter being about three times more than anticipated in earlier studies.17,20 While successively increasing the sampling depth from 2–10, we found that the relative proportions of the AS rates between most species remain constant (Supplementary Fig. S2). This underpins the reliability of our normalization method. Because many loci have a lower EST coverage than the sampling depth of 10, our analysis yielded rather conservative estimates. It is likely that with deep transcriptome sequencing more fungal AS events will be found. Even when excluding very rare events, this may elevate the AS rates. This trend was seen for human and other mammals already,8 and can be supported by the finding that for A. benhamiae and N. crassa, both of which have high EST coverage, the AS rates clearly kept rising at higher sampling depths (Supplementary Fig. S2), opposed to most of the other species.Finally, in a recent study on fission yeasts, 433 AS events in overall 5144 genes were found in S. pombe.35 While considering scaling effects due to sequencing depth, our results agree well with these findings in that the AS rate is very low compared with that in non-yeast Ascomycota (see Supplementary Calculation S1). This validates the comparability of our normalized AS rate results.4.2. Fungal introns have an innate propensity to be retainedWe found that the trend of relative AS type distribution was the same in all the investigated fungal species. Intron retention made up the most prevalent of the investigated types (61% of the events). Contrarily, skipped exons were very rare (3%) and alternative 3' (23%) and 5' SSs (13%) comprised a third of the events. These results are in general agreement with previous findings on fungal AS15 and are similar to trends in plants.7,15 In contrast, skipped exons are more common than RIs in invertebrates and even more frequent in vertebrates.7The more introns a species genome harbours the more splicing needs to take place. The question is whether this also increases the chance to have alternatively spliced introns per se. Indeed, we found a strong correlation of genome-wide intron numbers and numbers of RIs. Thus, fungal introns seem to have an innate chance to be alternatively spliced. Similarly, Irimia et al.17 found a correspondence between AS and intron number per gene in 12 eukaryotes.We found that fungal RIs are shorter than constitutively spliced introns. Also, on the species level, there is a correspondence between intron lengths and their propensity to be alternatively spliced. Together, this hints at an involvement of the intron length in the recognition of introns. The intron definition mechanism is a model proposed to explain this same effect in plants. Splicing factors bind to the recognition sites on the RNA, and ‘bridge’ across the intron by mutual binding. Thus, failed recognition of one SS typically results in intron retention.15 This is in contrast to metazoan splicing, where splicing factors are assumed to form stable complexes across exons (exon definition mechanism) and where failed SS recognition typically results in exon skipping. It explains why metazoan introns tend to be much longer (e.g. 3413 nt in human36) but are rarely retained. Thus, we propose that the intron definition mechanism is prevalent in fungi similar to plants.Finally, there is a hypothesis that connects SS conservation with splicing propensity, saying that strict adherence to the SS motif promotes the splicing machinery to bind more reliably to the SS and thus decreases the chance of AS.37 McGuire et al.15 find weaker (i.e., less conserved) SSs at RIs compared with constitutively spliced introns in all their investigated species. Here, when comparing introns (both retained and normally spliced ones) between the taxa, we find that higher SS conservation correlates with lower AS rates, which supports the hypothesis.4.3. Fungal RIs are authentic and likely trigger nonsense-mediated mRNA decayThere is a debate if RIs are authentic AS events or represent incompletely spliced pre-mRNA. Contamination with genomic DNA is very unlikely since the construction of EST libraries relies on affinity-based poly(A)+ mRNA enrichment. From the analysis of fungal RIs, we found no tendency to preserve the reading frame, similar to results on non-fungal species in a previous study.15 This may support the hypothesis of spurious intron retention. However, we have several arguments against it. For the majority of EST libraries analysed here, cDNA was produced by poly(A)-tail capture, ensuring that ESTs derive from fully transcribed mRNAs. The current consensus is that intron splicing occurs predominantly cotranscriptionally,38 corroborated by findings that the nascent mRNA can recruit multiple spliceosomes simultaneously.39 Though the exact kinetics of RNA processing and export are unknwon, intron splicing is likely finished shortly after transcription. This supports the hypothesis that if a detected multi-intron mRNA was spliced at one intron, it has already been spliced at the other introns, too. In fact, averaged over all species, 96% of the transcript isoforms that support an RI contain a processed intron at another position, as was similarly reported for RIs in Arabidopsis thaliana.40 In these cases, the completed splicing of co-transcribed introns indicates that the molecules have passed spliceosomal processing and that RIs likely represent authentic events on mRNA. However, it is possible that RI-containing mRNAs had not left the nucleus, awaiting a later processing cycle or degradation. Nevertheless, even if this is true, these cases illustrate inherent differences in splicing efficiency.It was argued that despite a weak selection for coding potential, splice variants having RIs unlikely yield functional proteins.15 While we suppose that most RIs are authentic AS events, the isoforms with a frame-shifting RI unlikely yield productive, protein-coding mRNAs. However, we hypothesize that fungal RIs may in part be a means for post-transcriptional regulation via nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), in which transcripts containing premature termination codons (PTCs) are degraded.41 This is because RI sequences with frame shifts probably introduce PTCs (15 randomly drawn triplets pose a chance of >50% to contain a stop codon). Most of the NMD-related components41 are conserved in most of the fungi present in NCBI's HomoloGene database (Supplementary Table S8). Saccharomyces cerevisiae has an NMD machinery which is, however, not essential. Most RIs of the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica, contain PTCs and there is evidence that corresponding RNA is degraded by NMD.42 Finally, first evidence for functional NMD were found in N. crassa.43 As long as experimental data for a functional relevance of RIs are missing, we note that RIs qualify as mediators for a splicing-dependent mechanism of gene expression regulation, based on structure as well as on statistical association with functional categories (see below).4.4. Does AS facilitate multi-cellular complexity?The complexity of the (multi-)cellular structure has long since been an important feature to classify fungi into sub-taxa.44 Typical instances of diverse complexity are, being yeast or mold, and characteristics of sexual structures. There are predominantly single-celled yeasts, namely S. pombe, S. cerevisiae and P. stipitis, within the phylum of the Ascomycota, whose most complex yeast form is a four-spore ascus. The Mucoromycotina R. oryzae forms simple zygospores during sexual reproduction, but differentiated multi-cellular sporangia for asexual reproduction. Filamentous Ascomycetes produce more complex thalli, as, e.g. ascocarps (apothecium, cleistothecium, perithecium). Finally, Basidio-mycota, probably the most recent ‘crown group’ of fungi, develop complex fruiting bodies.44 We here find that the average AS rate of the mentioned taxa correlates with this order of complexity: Saccharomycotina and Taphrinomycotina (0.26% per-gene AS rate), Mucoro-mycotina (2.3%), Pezizomycotina (7.2%, Ascomycota excluding yeasts) and Basidiomycota (8.6%). We speculate that AS contributes to multi-cellular complexity of the fungi.We find that the fungi with the smallest genomes show nearly no AS. These are the ascomycetous yeasts S. cerevisiae, S. pombe and P. stipitis. This is consistent with an earlier study on S. cerevisiae and S. pombe.17 A major reason for this is probably the reduced proportion of intron-containing genes, e.g. 5% of S. cerevisiae genes vs. 86% in C. immitis, since Hemiascomycetes (Saccharomycetes) experienced intron loss during the course of evolution.45 However, from a certain genome size on, neither the AS rate nor the absolute AS number show any correlation. And, to an extreme, C. neoformans has only ca. 6600 genes but the highest found AS rate (18%).The composition of the splicing machinery can give another perspective in understanding the differences in AS capability. The core components of the spliceosome, i.e. the five snRNPs and essential dynamic factors like Prp8 or Slu7, are generally conserved in eukaryotes. However, the small subunit of U2AF (U2AF35 in human), involved in recognition of the 3'SS, is absent in S. cerevisiae. The family of serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins comprise many known splicing regulators, and it was proposed that a higher SR protein diversity increases the AS complexity.46 Our results do support this hypothesis: among yeasts, which have the lowest AS rates, S. cerevisiae has no SR proteins, only an SR-like homologue Npl3,47 and S. pombe has only two SR proteins.48 On the other hand, many of the other species of our study were found to have many SR and SR-related proteins,49 in accordance with their higher AS rates.We used Pfam domain annotations to analyse the possible functional associations of AS. The most significantly AS-enriched Pfam-coding gene families are ribosomal or do function in thiamine biosynthesis. However, these findings should be taken with caution since the expression level (i.e. EST coverage) is ~50-fold higher than average. Other AS-enriched gene families with moderate gene expression levels do code for fungi-specific protein domains of unknown function. This may indicate that AS is associated with enhanced evolutionary dynamics in these gene families, consistent with a supportive role of AS in gene evolution.50Taking together the relatively low fraction of AS-associated gene families and the gene expression bias among the few candidates, we conclude that a homogenous distribution model is currently a sufficient explanation for the occurrence of AS among the EST-covered genes. However, we anticipate that increasing EST sequencing depths, and a saturation of a major fraction of genes, will allow more detailed insights into the functional association of AS in fungi.Both, the elevated AS rates and the greater amount of splicing regulators of the more complex fungi suggest the hypothesis that AS may facilitate multi-cellular complexity. Furthermore, we found that AS is involved in another elaborate trait of certain fungi, namely virulence.4.5. AS likely regulates virulence of pathogenic fungiA first hint of AS involvement in pathogenicity was given by mere comparison of average AS rates. Human pathogenic fungi show on average a twice as high AS rate (10.7%) than non-pathogenic fungi (5.1%, neither plant nor human pathogenic). This is corroborated by the keywords of AS-associated Pfam domains which indicate enrichment for stress response functions. Moreover, a direct search for homologues of P. brasiliensis' tps1, hsp30 and ddr48 genes that convey cell rescue of this fungus while facing oxidative and heat shock stress in the human body,34 yielded many AS-associated genes in human and plant pathogenic fungi. Hence, it is likely that AS is involved in gene expression regulation during the adaptation to the environmental conditions in the host.The dimorphic switch is another virulence factor, and a key of persistent virulence.33 During host penetration, a fungus can either switch to filamentous growth (e.g. C. albicans, A. fumigatus), or switch from filamentous to uni-cellular growth (e.g. P. brasiliensis Pb01, C. immitis). The dimorphic switch is only poorly understood. However, several contributing compounds have been identified. Cryptococcus neoformans' glucuronoxylomannan (GMX), a capsular polysaccharide, is crucial for switching, as it alters the capsule surface. This increases the resistance against host immune system by hampering antibody and complement mediated phagocytosis.33 We found two homologues of GMX production and modification proteins in C. neoformans (in B-3501A and JEC21), each containing an RI. Of the 19 predicted homologues of tps1, hsp30, ddr48 and GMX-related genes, 5 have AS association in four non-pathogenic fungi (Supplementary Tables S6 and S7).An association of AS with pathogenicity has been found in former studies already. The UrRm75 gene in U. maydis, involved in dimorphism and virulence, contains four introns and has an alternative 3'SS.51 A putative heat shock protein and a putative alpha, alpha-trehalose-phosphate synthase (both stress response-associated) were predicted to be affected by AS in C. neoformans.20 Transcripts of cryptococcal intersectin 1 undergo AS and its disruption affects the production of several virulence factors in C. neoformans.52 In many fungi, Ste12-like transcription factors play essential roles in invasive growth and pseudohyphal development, and their gene transcripts are affected by AS within a conserved exon–intron structure.53 Summar-izing, gene regulation via AS likely facilitates virulence of pathogenic fungi on various levels.FundingThis work was funded by the Friedrich-Schiller-University Jena and the Jena School for Microbial Communication (JSMC).The authors thank Matthias Platzer from the Fritz Lipmann Institute (Jena), Ina Weiß from the chair of bioinformatics Jena, Michael Hiller from MPI of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics (Dresden) and Kerstin Hoffmann from the Friedrich-Schiller-University Jena, Germany for helpful discussions.

Though development and application of microsatellite markers in large-scale was reported in the model crop foxtail millet, no such large-scale study was conducted for intron-length polymorphic (ILP) markers. Considering this, we developed 5123 ILP markers, of which 4049 were physically mapped onto 9 chromosomes of foxtail millet. BLAST analysis of 5123 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) suggested the function for ~71.5% ESTs and grouped them into 5 different functional categories. About 440 selected primer pairs representing the foxtail millet genome and the different functional groups showed high-level of cross-genera amplification at an average of ~85% in eight millets and five non-millet species. The efficacy of the ILP markers for distinguishing the foxtail millet is demonstrated by observed heterozygosity (0.20) and Nei's average gene diversity (0.22). In silico comparative mapping of physically mapped ILP markers demonstrated substantial percentage of sequence-based orthology and syntenic relationship between foxtail millet chromosomes and sorghum (~50%), maize (~46%), rice (~21%) and Brachypodium (~21%) chromosomes. Hence, for the first time, we developed large-scale ILP markers in foxtail millet and demonstrated their utility in germplasm characterization, transferability, phylogenetics and comparative mapping studies in millets and bioenergy grass species.1. IntroductionFoxtail millet [(Setaria italica (L.) P. Beauv] has recently been regarded as a tractable model crop due to its small genome (~ 515 Mb; 2n = 2x = 18), low amount of repetitive DNA, inbreeding nature and short life cycle.1,2 Moreover, its close relatedness to several bioenergy crops with complex genomes such as switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), napiergrass (Pennisetum purpureum) and pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) and its potential abiotic stress tolerance adds up to the merits of foxtail millet as an experimental model crop for exploring various plant architectural traits, evolutionary genomics and physiological attributes of the C4 Panicoid grass crops.1–3 Since foxtail millet has one of the largest sets of both cultivated and wild-type germplasm rich in phenotypic variations, it appears promising for association mapping and allele mining of elite and novel variants to be integrated in crop improvement programmes.2,4,5 Hence, considering the importance of foxtail millet, the Joint Genome Institute (JGI) of the Department of Energy, USA, and BGI (formerly Beijing Genome Initiative), China, have recently sequenced its genome.6,7 The availability of genomic sequence has motivated the scientific community to generate genomic resources, which ultimately had resulted in the development of large-scale sequence-based genomic8 and genic expressed sequence tag (EST)-derived microsatellite markers.9 Noteworthy, the recently developed ‘Foxtail millet Marker Database (FmMDb)’ (http://www.nipgr.res.in/foxtail.html)10 encompasses all these generated genomic resources for the benefit of research community aiming in genetic improvement of target millet and its related bioenergy crop species, thus bridging the gap between the researchers and breeders.DNA markers such as restriction fragment-length polymorphism,11 random amplified polymorphic DNA,12 amplified fragment-length polymorphism,13 simple sequence repeat polymorphism (SSR),14 single-nucleotide polymorphism15 and intron-length polymorphism (ILP)16 exploit the variations, or polymorphisms in DNA sequences are used in various genotyping applications in crop plants. Of these, ILP markers are unique since they are gene-specific, co-dominant, hypervariable, neutral, convenient and reliable.17 ILP markers utilize the variation in the intron sequences and are the most easily recognizable type as it could be detected by PCR with primers designed on exons flanking the target intron.18 Thus, these markers in spite of being derived from gene sequences showed higher intra-specific polymorphism in plant species than other kinds of markers. In addition to being sequence-tagged sites markers,19 ILP markers have high transferability rates among related plant species.18,20 In order to facilitate straightforward mining of ILP markers, Yang et al.17 has developed a web-based database platform named PIP (potential intron polymorphism) to provide detailed information of the PIP markers and homologous relationships among PIP markers from different species.Regardless of these advantages, very few reports are available on development of ILP markers in plant species when compared with reports on other DNA markers. Noteworthy, till now only one study has been carried out on ILP markers in foxtail millet,20 where about 98 markers were developed and characterized. Hence, in view of the importance of ILPs and the availability of less significant number of ILP markers in foxtail millet, the present study was conducted aiming at: (i) developing ILP markers at large-scale from the entire set of publicly available foxtail millet ESTs, (ii) demonstrating the applicability of the ILP markers in examining genetic diversity and cross-species transferability and (iii) developing physical map for studying in silico ILP marker-based comparative mapping between foxtail millet and other grass species such as sorghum, maize, rice and Brachypodium.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant material and DNA isolationThe details of plant materials used in the study are summarized in Supplementary Table S1. The seeds of all the investigated species were surface-sterilized in 3% sodium hypochlorite for 20 min, rinsed with sterile distilled water and were germinated in greenhouse. The genomic DNA was isolated from the fresh young leaves using the CTAB method as described elsewhere.21 The DNA was purified and then quantified on agarose gel by comparison with 50 ng/µl of standard lambda (<U+03BB>) DNA marker (NEB).2.2. Development of putative ILP markersThe publicly available EST sequences of S. italica were searched and retrieved from NCBI dbEST (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/db/). Approximately 66 027 ESTs were used for the unigene definition using the CD-HIT (Cluster Database at High Identity with Tolerance) software tool (http://weizhong-lab.ucsd.edu/cdhit_suite/cgi-bin/index.cgi) for redundancy minimization and assembling of sequences. The non-redundant ESTs were used for the development of specific intron-based markers. Using rice genomic sequence as reference, PIP database (http://ibi.zju.edu.cn/pgl/pip/)17 was used to predict intron positions in the EST sequences and then designed a pair of primers flanking the intron position. A query EST was considered to be homologous to a subject-coding sequence only if there were at least 100 bp overlapping and 80% similarity between them. The corresponding position and length of identified introns from the subject species were obtained from the PIP database.17 To cross-check the primer-designing potential of ILP markers and validate the results of the PIP database, the forward and reverse primers designed for the ILP markers were BLAST-searched against latest released foxtail millet pseudomolecules of nine chromosomes (http://www.phytozome.net).2.3. Functional annotation and physical mapping of ILP markersThe putative functions of the ILP markers were assigned by executing BLASTX search of respective marker encompassing EST sequences against the non-redundant database at NCBI (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) with default search parameters. The ILP markers were BLAST-searched against the whole-genome sequences of foxtail millet available at Phytozome (http://www.phytozome.net) and plotted individually on each of the nine foxtail millet chromosomes according to their ascending order of physical position (bp), from the short-arm telomere to the long-arm telomere and finally visualized in the MapChart software.22 To further validate the BLAST results of in silico physical mapping, we re-analysed the forward and reverse primers of ILP markers against foxtail millet chromosome pseudomolecules using the ePCR program (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sutils/e-pcr).232.4. Validation of ILP markersThe ILPs were amplified in a 25 µl total volume containing 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase (Sigma), 50 ng of genomic DNA, 10 µmol/l of each primer, 0.5 mmol/l of each dNTPs and 2.5 µl of 10× PCR reaction buffer [500 mM KCl, 200 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.4) and 3 mM MgCl2] in an iCycler thermal controller (Bio-Rad). The PCR profile was an initial denaturation of 3 min at 94°C, followed by 35 cycles of 60 s at 94°C, 60 s at 50–55°C and 2 min at 72°C, and a final extension of 10 min at 72°C. The amplicons were resolved on 2% agarose gel (Cambrex, USA) in Tris-borate EDTA buffer (pH 8.0), stained with ethidium bromide and analysed using GelDoc-It™ imaging system (UVP). The fragment size for each locus was determined by 100 bp standard size markers (NEB). Results were confirmed by three replicate assays.The amplified products (alleles) from millet and non-millet species were eluted and cloned into pGEM(R)-T Easy vector (Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions. The recombinant plasmids were purified using AccuPrep Plasmid MiniPrep DNA Extraction Kit (Bioneer) following the manufacturer's protocol. The plasmids were sequenced in an automated sequencer (3730xI DNA Analyzer, Applied Biosystems) using M13 forward and reverse primers. The sequence information was used to construct multiple sequence alignment along with a reference S. italica sequence using the ClustalW2 program (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/clustalw2/index.html).2.5. Genetic diversityThe ILP marker profiles amplified among 96 foxtail millet accessions were scored manually; each allele was scored as present (1) or absent (0) for each of the ILP loci. Polymorphic informative content (PIC) values were calculated according to Roldán-Ruiz et al.24 as PICi = 2fi(1 - fi), where fi is the frequency of the amplified allele (band present), and (1 - fi) is the frequency of the null allele (band absent) of marker i. Using pairwise similarity matrix of Jaccard's coefficient,25 the level of genetic diversity among foxtail millet accessions was calculated and a phylogenetic tree was constructed by unweighted pair-group method of arithmetic average, neighbour-joining (NJoin) module of the NTSYS-pc software v2.02.26 The genetic relationships among millets and non-millet grass species based on cross-transferability of ILP markers were determined based on Nei (1983)27 diversity co-efficient, and a phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbour-joining (NJ) tree interface of the PowerMarker software ver2.5.28 The observed heterozygosity (HO), Nei's average gene diversity27 and fixation index (FIS) were also computed using the PowerMarker software ver2.5.28 Correlation analysis among PIC and the number of alleles were examined using the GraphPad InStat software v3.10 (www.graphpad.com).2.6. In silico comparative genome mappingThe ILP markers that were physically mapped on the nine chromosomes of foxtail millet were BLASTN-searched against genome sequences of sorghum, maize, rice and Brachypodium (www.phytozome.net) to develop marker-based syntenic relationships among the chromosomes of foxtail millet and three other grass species. A cut-off bit score of 54.7 and an E-value of <1e - 05 were considered optimum for BLASTN analysis. The marker-based syntenic relationships among foxtail millet, sorghum, maize, rice and Brachypodium were finally visualized with visualization blocks in the Circos software v0.55 (http://circos.ca).293. Results and discussion3.1. Development of ILP markers and physical mapping in foxtail millet genomeA set of 66 027 EST sequences of S. italica produced 24 828 non-redundant ESTs, which were used for generating ILP markers by using rice as reference genome in the PIP database.17 A total of 5123 ILP markers (20.6%) were generated out of 24 828 EST sequences with an average frequency of ~12.6 ILP markers per megabase genomic sequences (Supplementary Table S2). BLAST analysis of 5123 ILP markers against the foxtail millet genome showed the presence of all the markers in the genome, and the determination of genomic distribution of these 5123 ILP markers on the foxtail millet genome revealed physical localization of 4049 markers on the nine chromosomes of foxtail millet with an average marker density of 9.8 markers/Mb (Fig. 1; Table 1). The average marker density was maximum (14.1/Mb) in chromosome 9, followed by chromosome 5 (11.8/Mb), and minimum in chromosome 8 (5.7/Mb). An extensive analysis of chromosome-wise distribution and frequency of these physically mapped ILP markers showed higher frequency of markers mapped on chromosome 9 (831 markers, 20.5%) and minimum on chromosome 8 (230, 5.7%) (Fig. 1; Table 1).

Functional annotation of ILPBLASTX analyses of the 5123 EST sequences suggested a nearly defined function for ~71.5% of ILP markers, and 28.5% had no similarities to previously sequenced genes. Based on the function, the ILP markers with defined function (71.5%) were grouped into five major categories (Fig. 2). The largest category (47.4%) contained EST sequences with hypothetical/uncharacterized/putative functions. The second largest category (26.2%) comprised stress-related transcripts. The housekeeping proteins (9.5) ranked third, followed by protein kinases (8.6%) and transcription factors (8.3%) (Fig. 2). Foxtail millet being a potentially abiotic stress-tolerant crop particularly towards drought and salinity, investigating the EST sequences with hypothetical/uncharacterized/putative functions (47.4%) and those which no similarities to previously sequenced genes (28.5%) could provide novel clues on the stress tolerance mechanisms.

The unique genes were grouped into five functional groups.3.3. Marker validation, cross-genera transferability and genetic basis of sequence length variationTo amplify introns by PCR, the exon-primed intron-crossing PCR (EPIC-PCR) method was used,30 where primers were designed in flanking exons using the PIP database. The advantages of EPIC-PCR are it is fast, reliable, reproducible and convenient, providing ready-to-use and clearly intelligible results. Hence, from the 4049 physically mapped ILP markers, 440 primer pairs flanking the exons were chosen for further analyses based on two criteria, viz. representing the whole genome of foxtail millet and the function of the EST. All the ILP markers were evidenced to produce clear, successful and reproducible amplification in S. italica cv. Prasad with 100% amplification potential (Supplementary Table S3). This demonstrates the significance of the developed 4049 ILP markers in expediting foxtail millet genomics and molecular breeding. About 391 (~90%) of the 440 ILP markers amplified unique single allele, while 49 markers amplified more than one allele/multiple alleles. Thus, a total of 495 alleles were amplified by 440 ILP markers in S. italica cv. Prasad (Supplementary Table S3). All the 440 ILP markers have the ability to distinguish the investigated millet and non-millet species into two distinct groups (Fig. 3). Genetic relationships among millet and non-millet grass species based on 43 foxtail millet ILP markers, using NJoin clustering. Nine millet species including foxtail millet clearly differentiated from the five non-millet grass species and expected genetic relationships among species under study were also apparent.Genetic relationships among millet and non-millet grass species based on 43 foxtail millet ILP markers, using NJoin clustering. Nine millet species including foxtail millet clearly differentiated from the five non-millet grass species and expected genetic relationships among species under study were also apparent.From these validated set of 440 ILP markers, about 100 markers representing the whole foxtail millet genome were chosen to evaluate its polymorphism and molecular diversity potential in a set of eight accessions of Setaria including five cultivated and three wild species. About 45 (45%) SiILP markers showed polymorphism and a total of 163 alleles ranging from 1 to 5 alleles were amplified by candidate SiILP markers with an average of 2.15 alleles per marker locus (Supplementary Table S4). The polymorphic potential (~45%) of ILP markers estimated among foxtail millet cultivated and wild accessions was higher than that reported using the ILP markers derived from foxtail millet genomic sequences.20 The higher polymorphic potential of ILP markers is expected because of their development targeting the hypervariable introns, which are under less selective pressure.In order to investigate the utility of the ILP markers in cross-genera transferability, the 100 validated set of ILP markers were used to amplify the genomic DNA of millet (barnyard millet, finger millet, kodo millet, little millet, pearl millet, proso millet, guinea grass) and non-millet species (switchgrass, sorghum, maize, rice, Brachypodium) (Table 2; Fig. 4). Of the 100 SiILP markers assayed, the highest transferability percentage (98%) was observed in proso millet and lowest (59.4%) in wheat, with an average percent transferability of ~85% (Table 2). Markers which showed a consistent amplification profile in other species were scored as being cross-transferable, thus confirming the utility of developed ILP markers for revealing high cross-genera transferability. To gain further insight into the molecular basis of cross-transferability of ILP markers, the paralogous relationships of 4049 markers orthologous between foxtail millet and rice genes were determined. Three hundred and forty-seven (8.6%) of 4049 orthologous ILP markers were present in paralogous foxtail millet genes, while 80 (2%) were found in paralogous rice genes. It inferred that 3622 ILP markers designed in this study are unique either in the foxtail millet or in the rice genome. Interestingly, the 100 ILP markers showing orthologous relationships between foxtail millet and rice genes selected for cross-transferability study did not show any paralogous relationships within either rice or foxtail millet genome. This confirms the higher cross-transferability potential of ILP markers due to orthologous relationships among species rather than paralogy within species.

The amplicons are resolved in 2% agarose gel along with 100 bp DNA size standard.To examine whether the PCR products were really amplified or homologous to the target genes in millet and non-millet species, we randomly picked up a primer pair, SiILP4686 (Zea mays PHD transcription factor), which amplified variant alleles from 214 to 455 bp (Fig. 4). As expected, the sequences of cloned PCR products of the investigated species revealed indels and several point mutations, such as single-base insertions, deletions or translocations; in addition, polymorphism in intron length was observed (data not shown). Overall, multiple sequence alignment has shown that they were homologous to each other and comprised conserved exon regions at two end positions and non-conserved or variable intron region in the middle. Similar kind of observation was also reported in rice,18Hypericum perforatum31 and foxtail millet.20 Further, higher level of transferability of ILPs compared with previously identified markers reflects the conserved nature of exon positions in gene and variability in the non-coding sequences.18 Hence, in our study, the high levels of cross-species amplification indicate that the foxtail millet ILP markers could be successfully useful for comparative mapping in millet and non-millet species. Similarly, it was shown that EST-SSR has higher cross-species transferability than genomic SSR markers.10,32,33 In addition, all the 100 ILP markers possess ability to distinguish the investigated millet and non-millet species belonging to different genera. The variations in the number of alleles per ILP marker locus in different species studied are possibly dependent upon ploidy level, nature and number of genotype sets in each species used for analysis.3.4. Genetic diversityBesides, the validated physically mapped markers could enable one to discriminate all the 96 cultivated and wild foxtail millet accessions from each other with a level diversity from 0 to 65% (Fig. 5). A core set of 89 cultivated S. italica accessions and 7 related wild species were used to decipher the polymorphic potential of 20 ILP markers representing the whole genome of foxtail millet. In total, 59 alleles were identified with an average of about 3 alleles per locus, varying from 2 to 5 (Table 3). This was comparable with a recent study in foxtail millet using ILP markers,20 where the average number of alleles per locus reported was 2.6. The polymorphic information content (PIC) values were extended from 0.03 to 0.47 with a mean of 0.20. The observed heterozygosity (HO) for individual loci ranged from 0.00 to 0.32, with a mean of 0.13 (Table 3). The PIC value was calculated in order to examine the extent of information on diversity that these markers can provide and compare these results with previous published studies. The average PIC value (0.20) reported in this study was lower than that reported for rice (0.45 and 0.44).18,34 The probable reason for differences in results might be attributed to the difference in number of genotypes and their genetic background and number of markers used. Nei's average gene diversity (Nei) ranged from 0.03 to 0.52, with a mean of 0.22. Among all the loci analysed with fixation index (FIS), 15 loci were found positive, representing excess of observed homozygotes, whereas 5 loci were negative, demonstrating heterozygotes, with a mean of 0.42 per locus (Table 3). There was no significant correlation observed between PIC and allele number for the 20 markers investigated (data not shown). The phylogenetic tree constructed in this study using ILP markers differentiated 89 cultivated S. italica accessions and 7 related wild species from each other and clustered according to their taxonomic classification (Fig. 5). The dendrogram constructed grouped 96 Setaria accessions into two distinct clusters, cluster I with 89 accessions comprising cultivated species (foxtail millet, S. italica) and cluster II includes the wild Setaria species (Fig. 5). Therefore, the ILP markers with high amplification and polymorphic potential distributed over nine chromosomes of foxtail millet genome could be promisingly useful for many large-scale genotyping applications in foxtail millet.

In silico comparative genome mapping between foxtail millet and other grass speciesIn order to substantiate that the ILP marker-based physical map constructed in this study for foxtail millet genome could be useful in comparative genome mapping, the physically mapped 4049 SiILP markers were compared with their physical location on the chromosomes of other related grass genomes, including sorghum, maize, rice and Brachypodium (Fig. 6; Table 4). The comparative genome mapping showed considerably significant proportion of sequence-based orthology and syntenic relationship of SiILP markers distributed over nine foxtail millet chromosomes with sorghum (~50%, 2038), maize (~46%, 1867), rice (~21%, 868) and Brachypodium (~21%, 845) chromosomes (Fig. 6; Supplementary Tables S5–S8).

Comparative mapping between foxtail millet chromosomes with (a) sorghum; (b) maize; (c) rice and (d) Brachypodium chromosomes, using 4049 physically mapped foxtail millet ILP markers. Maximum syntenic relationships of foxtail millet chromosomes with sorghum chromosomes based on ILP markers was evident.The comparative mapping showed a syntenic relationship of 2038 ILP marker loci distributed over 9 chromosomes of foxtail millet with 2038 genomic regions on 10 chromosomes of sorghum (Fig. 6a; Supplementary Table S5). About 50% syntenic relationship of ILP marker loci between foxtail millet and sorghum chromosomes was observed on an average, with maximum synteny between foxtail millet chromosome 9 and sorghum chromosome 1 (~91%), followed between foxtail millet chromosome 5 and sorghum chromosome 3 (~89%) (Fig. 6a; Supplementary Table S5).About 1867 ILP marker loci distributed over nine chromosomes of foxtail millet showed significant matches with 1867 genomic regions of 10 maize chromosomes (Fig. 6b; Supplementary Table S6). Interestingly, each foxtail millet chromosome showed sytenic relationship with two maize chromosomes, thus highlighting the recent whole-genome duplication in maize. All the nine foxtail millet chromosomes showed considerable and higher average frequency (~46%) of ILP marker-based syntenic relationship with specific maize chromosomes. The physically mapped ILP markers on the foxtail millet chromosome 9 showed maximum synteny (~57%) with maize chromosome 1 and between foxtail millet chromosome 5 and maize chromosome 3 (~51%) (Fig. 6b; Supplementary Table S6).The syntenic relationship of 868 ILP marker loci distributed over nine chromosomes of foxtail millet with 868 genomic regions on 12 chromosomes of rice was evidenced (Fig. 6c; Supplementary Table S7). Maximum synteny of ILP marker loci was observed between foxtail millet chromosome 9 and rice chromosome 3 (~68%) and between foxtail millet chromosome 5 and rice chromosome 1 (~83%) (Fig. 6c; Supplementary Table S7).The ILP marker-based comparative mapping showed a similar pattern of synteny between foxtail millet and rice. Brachypodium chromosomes demonstrated a syntenic relationship with an average frequency of ~21% (845 marker loci) (Fig. 6d; Supplementary Table S8). The physically mapped ILP markers on the foxtail millet chromosome 9 showed maximum synteny (~76%) with Brachypodium chromosome 1 (Fig. 6d; Supplementary Table S8).Though there are many reports showing the mapping of microsatellite markers either genetically or physically on orthologous or syntenic chromosomes of different related plant genomes,7–9,35–38 this is the first report of comparative mapping using ILP markers. The syntenic relationships showed a higher degree of synteny between foxtail and sorghum genome followed by maize, rice and Brachypodium, which is possibly due to their taxonomic relationship, where foxtail millet, sorghum and maize belong to same subfamily Panicoideae, while rice belongs to Ehrhartoideae and Brachypodium belongs to Pooideae. The comparative mapping thus demonstrates the decrease of colinearity with increasing phylogenetic distance among plant species. These results are in accordance with the interpretations reported using genomic SSR markers8 and genic EST-derived SSR markers9 in foxtail millet. This shows the applicability of ILP marker-based comparative genome mapping between foxtail millet and other grass species such as sorghum, maize, rice and Brachypodium in translating the sequence information/candidate genes from this diploid crop to other polyploid biofuel grasses. Further, the ILP marker-based comparative mapping between foxtail millet and other grass species could enable transfer of gene-based marker information among these target species and thus would expedite map-based isolation of genes of agronomic importance in foxtail millet.4. ConclusionsTo the best of our knowledge, the ILP markers developed in this study are the large-scale novel set of markers in foxtail millet in addition to 98 earlier reported by Gupta et al.20 The present study identified 5123 ILP markers from 24 828 non-redundant ESTs, of which 4049 markers were physically mapped onto 9 chromosomes of foxtail millet genome. The validation, cross-genera transferability and genetic diversity studies demonstrated expediency of these ILP markers in germplasm characterization, genome relationships in millet and non-millet species and comparative mapping. The newly developed large-scale SiILP markers will be made available to the research community through the FmMDb (http://www.nipgr.res.in/foxtail.html)10 and this will promisingly expedite the molecular breeding in foxtail millet and other millets and forage grass species.Supplementary DataSupplementary Data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThe authors' work in this area was supported by the core grant of NIPGR.

In view of this, we conducted genome-wide microsatellite characterization and marker development in three recently sequenced Brassica crops: Brassica rapa, Brassica oleracea and Brassica napus. The analysed microsatellite characteristics of these Brassica species were highly similar or almost identical, which suggests that the pattern of microsatellite distribution is likely conservative in Brassica. The genomic distribution of microsatellites was highly non-uniform and positively or negatively correlated with genes or transposable elements, respectively. Of the total of 115 869, 185 662 and 356 522 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers developed with high frequencies (408.2, 343.8 and 356.2 per Mb or one every 2.45, 2.91 and 2.81 kb, respectively), most represented new SSR markers, the majority had determined physical positions, and a large number were genic or putative single-locus SSR markers. We also constructed a comprehensive database for the newly developed SSR markers, which was integrated with public Brassica SSR markers and annotated genome components. The genome-wide SSR markers developed in this study provide a useful tool to extend the annotated genome resources of sequenced Brassica species to genetic study/breeding in different Brassica species.1. IntroductionMicrosatellites, which are also known as simple sequence repeats (SSRs, often defined as 1–6 bp), variable numbers of tandem repeats (VNTRs) and short tandem repeats (STRs), have been found in all genomic regions of all examined organisms.1 Microsatellites have been traditionally regarded as ‘junk’ DNA and are mainly used as ‘neutral’ genetic markers.2 In recent years, microsatellites have been demonstrated to have many important biological functions (e.g. the regulation of chromatin organization, DNA metabolic processes, gene activity and RNA structure)3,4 and have therefore emerged as the third major class of genetic variations, alongside single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and copy number variations (CNVs).5 Microsatellite markers are co-dominant, multi-allelic, easily detected, hyper-variable, highly reproducible and abundant in the genome.6 Therefore, among the available genetic marker systems (e.g. RFLP, RAPD, SSR, AFLP, SRAP and SNP), the SSR marker has been the preferential choice for various applications, such as variety identification, genetic diversity evaluation, phylogenetic relationship analysis, genetic map construction, linkage/association mapping of gene/QTL, marker-assisted selection and comparative mapping.7,8Of the 47 genera in the Brassiceae tribe within the Brassicaceae (Cruciferae) family, the genus Brassica currently comprises 38 species,9 which include economically important crops that provide many vegetables, condiments, fodders and oil products.10 The main cultivated Brassica species include three diploid species, Brassica rapa (AA, n = 10), Brassica nigra (BB, n = 8) and Brassica oleracea (CC, n = 9) and three allotetraploid species, Brassica juncea (AABB, n = 18), Brassica napus (AACC, n = 19) and Brassica carinata (BBCC, n = 17). The genetic relationship of the six widely cultivated Brassica species are described as U's triangle11 in which the three allotetraploid species originated from the chromosome doubling after the natural hybridization between the three diploid species.Much research has been conducted to identify/characterize genomic/genic microsatellites and/or to develop markers in the Brassica species through probe (containing a repeated motif) hybridization against genomic/cDNA clones12–19 or through in silico analysis of publicly available bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) sequences,20 BAC-end sequences (BESs),21–23 genome survey sequences (GSSs),24 whole genome shotgun sequences (WGSs),25,26 expressed sequence tag sequences27,28 and unique transcript sequences.29–32 However, the pattern of microsatellite distribution has remained ambiguous, and the development/utilization of SSR marker has still been limited/inefficient in Brassica, which is mostly due to the lack of genome sequences. First, the sequences, programmes, criteria and parameters that are used for mining microsatellites usually have differed across these previous studies, which have made it difficult to compare and integrate these results to obtain the definitive conclusions on the pattern of microsatellite distribution. Secondly, only a small part of the genomic sequences of usually one species have been analysed in each of these previous studies. Therefore, it has been impossible to obtain general conclusions on the pattern of microsatellite distribution. In addition, the total number (˜10 000) of previously developed publicly available SSR markers is still limited33 and not sufficient for many studies, which require a large number and/or high density of genetic markers, such as high-density linkage map construction, gene/QTL fine-mapping and genome-wide/regional association mapping. Thirdly, due to the lack of genome sequences, the genomic distribution of microsatellites and the physical position(s)/product(s) number of the previously developed publicly available Brassica SSR markers have been all or mostly unclear, which has hindered their exact and/or effective utilization.Thanks to the rapid development of genome sequencing technology, the genome sequences are currently available for tens of plant species (http://www.phytozome.net), including three recently sequenced Brassica crop species, namely B. rapa,34B. oleracea (http://www.ocri-genomics.org/bolbase/index.html) and B. napus (our unpublished data). These sequences provide a powerful tool for genome-wide microsatellite characterization and/or marker development, which has been conducted in several model and crop plants, such as Arabidopsis (http://www.arabidopsis.org/), rice,35 maize (mips.helmholtz-muenchen.de/plant/maize/), sorghum (genome.jgi-psf.org/Sorbi1/Sorbi1.home.htm), black cottonwood,36 cucumber,37Brachypodim distachyon38 and foxtail millet39 but not Brassica. In view of this circumstance, we conducted genome-wide microsatellite characterization and marker development in the three sequenced Brassica crop species. The main objectives of this study were as follows: (i) to characterize and compare the frequency and distribution with respect to the motif length, type and repeat number of microsatellites in the assembled genomic sequences of these Brassica species; (ii) to characterize and compare the genomic distribution of microsatellites in the assembled pseudochromosomes of these Brassica species; (iii) to develop SSR markers from the assembled genomic sequences of these Brassica species and determine their copy number and positional relationship with the previously developed publicly available Brassica SSR markers and the annotated genome components; (iv) to construct a user-friendly comprehensive SSR marker database of Brassica and (v) to evaluate the newly developed genome-wide SSR markers by PCR (polymerase chain reaction) amplification in representative B. napus inbred lines.2. Materials and methods2.1. Sources of genome sequencesThe three inbred/pure lines, namely Chiifu-401 (B. rapa), O212 (B. oleracea) and Zhongshuang11 (B. napus), were sequenced by our own and several other institutes using Illumina GA II technology, and high-quality sequence reads were assembled using stringent parameters. Finally, a total of 40 549 (283.8 Mb), 120 061 (540.0 Mb) and 5098 (1000.9 Mb) sequence scaffolds were obtained for B. rapa, B. oleracea and B. napus, respectively, which represents 58.5, 77.6 and 81.7% of the nuclear genome and covers >98% of the gene space.2.2. Identification of microsatellitesPERL5 script MIcroSAtellite (http://pgrc.ipk-gatersleben.de/misa/)40 was used to identify and localize perfect microsatellites as well as compound microsatellites that are interrupted by a certain number of bases. The repeat unit length was defined as the default mono- to hexanucleotide because microsatellites of longer repeat units are very scarce. The minimum repeat unit was defined as 12, 6, 4, 3, 3 and 3, respectively, for the mono- to hexanucleotide. Compound microsatellites were defined as =2 repeats interrupted by =100 bp.2.3. Development of SSR primersPrimer pairs were designed from the flanking sequences of identified microsatellites using the primer3_core program (http://www-genome.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/primer/primer3_www.cgi) in batch mode. Two perl scripts, p3_in.pl and p3_out.pl, serve as interface modules for the programme-to-programme data interchange between MISA and the primer modeling software Primer3. The primer-designing parameters were 18–27 bp primer length, 57–63°C melting temperature, 30–70% GC content and 100–300 bp product size. The designed SSR primer pairs were denominated as the names of sequence scaffolds followed by a serial number of microsatellites (such as BrScaffold000001_1).2.4. Localization/mapping of SSR markers by in silico PCRThe primer-pair sequences of previously developed publicly available Brassica SSR markers were downloaded from the brassica.info website (http://www.brassica.info/resource/markers/ssr-exchange.php) and additional files in the recent literature.20,24,26,29,30,32 To determine their physical positions and copy numbers, the previously and newly developed Brassica SSR markers were aligned to the assembled genomic sequences of the studied Brassica species. This alignment was conducted using the in silico PCR method41 with the following default parameters: 2 bp mismatch, 1 bp gap, 50 bp margin and 50–1000 bp product size.2.5. Validation of SSR markers by PCR amplificationA total of 3974 SSR primer pairs were synthesized to test for PCR amplification in six representative B. napus cultivars/inbred lines (Tapidor, Westar, Zhongshuang11, No. 07197, No. 73290 and No. 91032), which were chosen from the core collections of a natural population and the parents of several segregating populations in our laboratory, for their large genetic distance and extreme trait(s) performance (our unpublished data).Genomic DNA of the six accessions was isolated from young leaves. PCR was performed in 20-µl volume that contained 0.2 mM dNTP, 0.5 U of Taq DNA polymerase, 75 ng of template DNA, 0.5 µM each primer and 1× PCR buffer (10 mM Tris pH 9.0, 50 mM KCl and 1.5 mM MgCl2). DNA amplification was conducted by the ‘touchdown’ method, with the following thermal profile: initial denaturation at 94°C for 5 min; six cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 45 s at 63°C with a 1°C decrease in annealing temperature per cycle and 1 min at 72°C; 26 cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 45 s at 57°C and 1 min at 72°C and a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. The PCR products were separated on 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and were visualized by silver staining.2.6. Statistical analysisThe correlation analysis was performed using the SAS PROC CORR procedure incorporated into SAS version 8.0. The Excel statistical function CHISQ.TEST was used to obtain the significance level (<U+2060>|$P_{\chi ^2 \,{\rm test}} $|<U+2060>) of the degree of fit for the practical and hypothetical distributions of microsatellites as well as genes and TEs in the assembled pseudochromosomes.3. Results3.1. Frequency and distribution with respect to the motif length, type and numberA total of 140 998, 229 389 and 420 991 perfect mono- to hexanucleotide repeat microsatellites were identified from 283.8, 540.0 and 1000.9 Mb of assembled genomic sequences of B. rapa, B. oleracea and B. napus, respectively (Table 1), with an overall frequency of 496.8, 424.8 and 420.6 per Mb or one every 2.01, 2.35 and 2.38 kb. Number, repeat number and total repeat length of the mono- to hexanucleotide repeats or motifs of microsatellites in the assembled genomic sequences of B. rapa, B. oleracea and B. napusNumber, repeat number and total repeat length of the mono- to hexanucleotide repeats or motifs of microsatellites in the assembled genomic sequences of B. rapa, B. oleracea and B. napusIn accordance with their high correlation (Supplementary Table S1), the distributions with respect to the motif length of microsatellites in the assembled genomic sequences of B. rapa, B. oleracea and B. napus were almost identical: mono-, di-, tri- and tetranucleotide repeats accounted for very similar and relatively high proportions, whereas penta- and hexanucleotide repeats were relatively uncommon (Fig. 1A).

The vertical axis shows the abundances (%) of microsatellites with different motif lengths, types or repeat numbers that are discriminated by the legends of different colours. For Figure 1B, because there is a limitation in the number of items (<256) in Excel, the abundances of the mono- to pentanucleotide motifs (a total of 151 types) are shown, while those for the hexanucleotide motifs (a total of 350 types) are displayed in Supplementary Table S2.Distribution with respect to the motif length (A), type (B) and repeat number (C) of microsatellites in the assembled genomic sequences of B. rapa, B. oleracea and B. napus. The vertical axis shows the abundances (%) of microsatellites with different motif lengths, types or repeat numbers that are discriminated by the legends of different colours. For Figure 1B, because there is a limitation in the number of items (<256) in Excel, the abundances of the mono- to pentanucleotide motifs (a total of 151 types) are shown, while those for the hexanucleotide motifs (a total of 350 types) are displayed in Supplementary Table S2.In accordance with their high correlation (Supplementary Table S1), the distributions with respect to the motif type of microsatellites in the assembled genomic sequences of B. rapa, B. oleracea and B. napus were almost identical (Fig. 1B; Supplementary Table S2). More specifically, both the dominant/major and absent/scarce mono- to hexanucleotide motifs in the assembled genomic sequences of the three Brassica species were mostly identical (Table 1; Supplementary Table S3). Interestingly, the dominant/major motifs (A, AT, AAG/AAT, AAAT, AAAAT and AAAAAT) were all A/T rich (Table 1), whereas the absent/scarce motifs were mostly C/G rich (Supplementary Table S3), which were highly consistent with the previous reports on microsatellites identified from 536 seed BACs of B. rapa,20 3500 genomic clones42 and 595 577 WGSs26 of B. oleracea and 13 794 GSSs (mainly BESs) of B. napus.24 It should be noted that the nucleotide composition characteristics of both the dominant/major and absent/scarce motifs in the assembled genomic sequences of the three Brassica species corresponded well to their much higher A/T (mean = 63.8%) than C/G (mean = 36.2%) content.In accordance with their high correlation (Supplementary Table S1), the distributions with respect to the motif repeat number of microsatellites in the assembled genomic sequences of B. rapa, B. oleracea and B. napus were also almost identical (Fig. 1C). Obviously, the microsatellite abundances decreased significantly as the motif repeat number increased, and the rate of this change was the slowest for dinucleotide repeat, followed by mono- and trinucleotide repeats, and was faster for other long repeats (Fig. 2). As a consequence, the difference between the average and minimum motif repeat numbers was the largest for dinucleotide repeat, followed by mono- and trinucleotide repeats, and was relatively small for tetra- to hexanucleotide repeats (Table 1).

The vertical axis shows the abundances of microsatellites that have different motif repeat numbers (from 3 to >20), which are discriminated by legends of different colours.In addition, the motif repeat number of the corresponding mono- to hexanucleotide repeats or motifs of microsatellites in the assembled genomic sequences of B. rapa, B. oleracea and B. napus were highly similar (Table 1; Supplementary Table S4). As a consequence, the total repeat length (=microsatellite number × motif length × motif repeat number) proportions of the corresponding mono- to hexanucleotide repeats or motifs of microsatellites in the assembled genomic sequences of B. rapa, B. oleracea and B. napus were mostly similar (Table 1; Supplementary Table S5).3.2. Genomic distributionThe genomic distributions of microsatellites and their relation with the annotated genome components (mainly as genes and TEs) were investigated (Fig. 3; Table 2), based on the assembled pseudochromosomes of the sequenced Brassica species (currently available for B. rapa and B. oleracea; Supplementary Table S6). <U+03C7>/italic>2 test between the practical and hypothetical/average distribution of microsatellites and their correlation with genes and TEs, for all pseudochromosomes of B. rapa and B. oleracea<U+03C7>/italic>2 test between the practical and hypothetical/average distribution of microsatellites and their correlation with genes and TEs, for all pseudochromosomes of B. rapa and B. oleraceaGenome-wide distributions of microsatellites as well as genes and TEs in the assembled pseudochromosomes of B. rapa (A) and B. oleracea (B). The horizontal axis shows the pseudochromosomes (B. rapa: A1–A10; B. oleracea: C1–C9), which are divided into 1-Mb intervals.

On the figure, the curves/lines of different styles represent the practical/hypothetical(average) frequencies of microsatellites, genes and TEs, respectively.Genome-wide distributions of microsatellites as well as genes and TEs in the assembled pseudochromosomes of B. rapa (A) and B. oleracea (B). The horizontal axis shows the pseudochromosomes (B. rapa: A1–A10; B. oleracea: C1–C9), which are divided into 1-Mb intervals. The left and right vertical axes show the frequencies of the microsatellites/genes and TEs, respectively. On the figure, the curves/lines of different styles represent the practical/hypothetical(average) frequencies of microsatellites, genes and TEs, respectively.For both B. rapa and B. oleracea, the frequency of microsatellites was high at/near both ends but low in/near the middle of all the pseudochromosomes (Fig. 3), which likely corresponded to the peri- telomere and centromere, respectively.43 The frequencies of microsatellites for the different pseudochromosomes of B. rapa or B. oleracea were generally comparable, which was in accordance with the similar frequencies of genes/TEs for these chromosomes (Fig. 3; Table 2). Interestingly, the homoeologous chromosomes A3 and C3 both exhibited the highest microsatellite frequency among all the pseudochromosomes of B. rapa or B. oleracea, respectively, which was in accordance with their highest gene frequency among these chromosomes (Fig. 3; Table 2). In accordance with the high significance of the P-values of the <U+03C7>2 test between the practical and hypothetical/average frequencies of microsatellites in the 1-Mb genomic intervals (Table 2), the physical distribution of microsatellites on all the pseudochromosomes of both B. rapa and B. oleracea were highly non-uniform (Fig. 3), which suggests the non-random occurrence of microsatellites. In accordance with the usually higher P-values of the <U+03C7>2 test between the practical and hypothetical/average frequencies of microsatellites for the 9 pseudochromosomes of B. oleracea than for the 10 pseudochromosomes of B. rapa (Table 2), the distribution of microsatellites was more uneven in B. oleracea than in B. rapa (Fig. 3), which was likely attributable to the more concentrated distribution of genes/TEs in B. rapa than in B. oleracea. For both B. rapa and B. oleracea, the frequencies of microsatellites in the 1-Mb genomic intervals studied were significantly positively or negatively correlated with those of genes (total r = 0.75 and 0.87) or TEs (total r = -0.61 and -0.73), respectively (Table 2), which was accordant with one of the interesting findings in this study, that the genomic distribution of microsatellites was generally in accordance with that of genes but opposite to that of TEs (Fig. 3). These results were in agreement with the previous findings, which showed that microsatellites are preferentially associated with non-repetitive DNA/gene sequences in the plant genome.5,44 The high agreement of microsatellites and genes strongly suggests the putative role of microsatellites in regulating gene function3–5 and the use of SSR markers for tagging/cloning genes.In conclusion, the genomic distributions of microsatellites in the assembled pseudochromosomes of B. rapa and B. oleracea were generally similar.3.3. Development and database of genome-wide SSR markersA total of 115 869 (92.1%), 185 662 (91.4%) and 356 522 (95.0%) primer pairs were successfully designed from the flanking sequences of 125 856, 203 161 and 375 214 mono- to hexanucleotide and compound microsatellites identified from the assembled genomic sequences of B. rapa, B. oleracea and B. napus, respectively (Table 3). The primer pairs could not be designed for the remaining microsatellites, mostly due to the constraint of obtaining sufficient flanking sequences from either side of the identified microsatellites. Similar observations have also been observed in other genome-wide microsatellite marker development studies in plants, such as rice,35 black cottonwood,36 cucumber,37Brachypodim distachyon38 and foxtail millet.39 The frequencies of newly developed genome-wide SSR markers of B. rapa, B. oleracea and B. napus were 408.2, 343.8 and 356.2 per Mb or one every 2.45, 2.91 and 2.81 kb, respectively. Most of the genome-wide SSR markers of B. rapa (91.9%) and B. oleracea (75.4%) were developed from the mapped sequence scaffolds and thus have determined physical positions. The physical positions of the newly developed genome-wide SSR markers of B. napus will be determined soon because the anchoring of its sequence scaffolds will be completed after several months (our unpublished data). Number (%) of newly developed genome-wide SSR markers that generated certain numbers (from 0 to >3) of in silico PCR products in the assembled genomic sequences of B. rapa, B. oleracea and B. napus, respectivelyNumber (%) of newly developed genome-wide SSR markers that generated certain numbers (from 0 to >3) of in silico PCR products in the assembled genomic sequences of B. rapa, B. oleracea and B. napus, respectivelyBecause of the polyploidy nature of Brassica,45 SSR markers usually amplify multiple fragments from homologous DNA sequences, which could complicate or cause errors in the genotype scoring. Therefore, all of the newly developed genome-wide SSR markers were subjected to in silico PCR analysis in the assembled genomic sequences of B. rapa, B. oleracea and B. napus, and the numbers of in silico PCR product(s) were recorded and summarized (Table 3). For the 115 869 SSR markers developed from B. rapa, 47 (0.0%), 92 517 (79.8%), 10 977 (9.5%), 3309 (2.9%) and 9019 (7.8%) markers generated 0, 1, 2, 3 and >3 in silico PCR product(s), respectively, from the assembled genomic sequences of B. rapa; 59 201 (51.1%), 40 493 (34.9%), 6370 (5.5%), 2100 (1.8%) and 7705 (6.6%) markers generated 0, 1, 2, 3 and >3 in silico PCR product(s), respectively, from the assembled genomic sequences of B. oleracea and 12 765 (11.0%), 36 030 (31.1%), 38 162 (32.9%), 10 666 (9.2%) and 18 246 (15.7%) markers generated 0, 1, 2, 3 and >3 in silico PCR product(s), respectively, from the assembled genomic sequences of B. napus. For the 185 662 SSR markers developed from B. oleracea, 20 (0.0%), 121 169 (65.3%), 18 299 (9.9%), 7140 (3.8%) and 39 034 (21.0%) markers generated 0, 1, 2, 3 and >3 in silico PCR product(s), respectively, from the assembled genomic sequences of B. oleracea; 110 784 (59.7%), 48 423 (26.1%), 8486 (4.6%), 3349 (1.8%) and 14 620 (7.9%) markers generated 0, 1, 2, 3 and >3 in silico PCR product(s), respectively, from the assembled genomic sequences of B. rapa and 13 192 (7.1%), 54 749 (29.5%), 55 160 (29.7%), 14 156 (7.6%) and 48 405 (26.1%) markers generated 0, 1, 2, 3 and >3 in silico PCR product(s), respectively, from the assembled genomic sequences of B. napus. For the 356 522 SSR markers developed from B. napus, 0 (0.0%), 93 084 (26.1%), 110 106 (30.9%), 44 138 (12.4%) and 109 194 (30.6%) markers generated 0, 1, 2, 3 and >3 in silico PCR product(s), respectively, from the assembled genomic sequences of B. napus; 157 473 (44.2%), 138 202 (38.8%), 20 604 (5.8%), 7758 (2.2%) and 32 485 (9.1%) markers generated 0, 1, 2, 3 and >3 in silico PCR product(s), respectively, from the assembled genomic sequences of B. rapa and 106 706 (29.9%), 153 690 (43.1%), 24 601 (6.9%), 10 264 (2.9%) and 61 261 (17.2%) markers generated 0, 1, 2, 3 and >3 in silico PCR product(s), respectively, from the assembled genomic sequences of B. oleracea. Interestingly, the SSR markers that generated tens to thousands of in silico PCR products were mostly associated with the annotated TEs, especially the retrotransposons.We also determined the relationship between the physical positions of the newly developed genome-wide SSR markers and the previously developed publicly available Brassica SSR markers as well as the annotated genome components (mainly as genes and TEs) (Supplementary Table S7). Of the 115 869 SSR markers developed from B. rapa, 5991 (5.2%), 22 596 (19.5%) and 32 648 (28.2%) were involved in public Brassica SSR markers, genes and TEs, respectively. Of the 185 662 SSR markers developed from B. oleracea, 12 322 (6.6%), 33 228 (17.9%) and 73 487 (39.6%) were involved in public Brassica SSR markers, genes and TEs, respectively. Of the 356 522 SSR markers developed from B. napus, 23 928 (6.7%), 58 952 (16.5%) and 161 090 (45.2%) were involved in public Brassica SSR markers, genes and TEs, respectively. Interestingly, the TE-associated SSR markers were rarely involved in the annotated genes and mostly generated tens to thousands of in silico PCR products.To facilitate the access and effective utilization of the Brassica SSR markers, we constructed an integrative database (http://oilcrops.info/SSRdb), which has search tools to obtain much useful information for the newly developed genome-wide SSR markers from the sequenced Brassica species and the previously developed publicly available Brassica SSR markers (Fig. 4). For the previously developed publicly available Brassica SSR markers, this information includes the primer-pair sequences, microsatellite repeat, source, reference and number of in silico PCR product(s) in the assembled genomic sequences of the sequenced Brassica species (currently only for B. rapa, B. oleracea and B. napus). For the newly developed genome-wide SSR markers from the sequenced Brassica species, this information includes the following: (i) the sequence, type, length and physical position of microsatellite repeat; (ii) the serial number, sequences, annealing temperatures, lengths and expected product size of primer pair; (iii) the number of in silico PCR product(s) in the assembled genomic sequences of the sequenced Brassica species (currently only for B. rapa, B. oleracea and B. napus) and (iv) the positional relationship with the previously developed publicly available Brassica SSR markers and the annotated genome components (mainly genes and TEs). In addition, this database also provides useful analysis tools (such as BLAST, e-PCR, Primer3 and ExtractSeq) and web links to other databases (e.g. http://brassicadb.org/brad/) and websites (e.g. http://www.brassica.info/) related to Brassica research. More importantly, this SSR marker database for Brassica will update as the number of sequenced Brassica species increases. Brassica SSR marker database homepage (A) and search results pages (B–D). This database provides three search approaches: by the name of the previously developed publicly available Brassica SSR markers (e.g. BN12A), by the serial number of the SSR markers (e.g. BnScaffold000001_12) and by the start to end positions on the chromosome/scaffold (e.g. BnScaffold000001:20–20 000 bp). This database also provides many useful tools, such as e-PCR, BLAST and primer3.

Experimental evaluation of the newly developed genome-wide SSR markersA total of 3974 newly developed SSR markers from B. rapa and B. oleracea were tested for amplification in the six representative B. napus cultivars/inbred lines (Table 4). Of these, 3880 SSR markers (97.6%) successfully amplified at least one clear fragment, while the remaining 94 (2.4%) failed to amplify, which could be due to the differences between the genome sequences of B. napus and its two progenitors, B. rapa and B. oleracea.46,47 The amplification rate (97.6%) of the tested SSR markers in the six B. napus cultivars/inbred lines was slightly or much higher than the corresponding rates (94.3/82.9, 89.2 and 77.4%, respectively) for the previously developed SSR markers from GSSs (mainly BESs)/unique transcripts of B. napus,24,30 BACs of B. rapa20 and WGSs of B. oleracea,26 which suggests that there is a high quality in the SSR markers that were developed from the assembled genomic sequences. The amplification rate of the tested SSR markers showed small variations for different motif lengths, motif repeat numbers and repeat lengths (i.e. motif length × motif repeat number), which was consistent with the previous reports in Brassica20,24,26 and rice.35 For the majority of the tested SSR markers, the numbers of fragment(s) amplified from the six representative B. napus cultivars/inbred lines were equal or very close to those of in silico PCR product(s) in the assembled genomic sequences of B. napus (Supplementary Table S8). In particular, most (1602 of 1813; 88.4%) of the tested SSR markers that generated one in silico PCR product in the assembled genomic sequences of B. napus also amplified only a single clear fragment from the six representative B. napus cultivars/inbred lines. A considerable proportion (1099 of 3880; 28.3%) of the successfully amplified SSR markers also produced weak fragment(s), which could correspond to non-specific amplification(s) from homologous DNA sequences. Amplification and polymorphism rate of the tested SSR markers and their association with the number of amplified fragment(s), the motif length, the motif repeat number and the repeat lengthAmplification and polymorphism rate of the tested SSR markers and their association with the number of amplified fragment(s), the motif length, the motif repeat number and the repeat lengthThe majority (2765 of 3880; 71.3%) of the successfully amplified SSR markers was polymorphic across the six representative B. napus cultivars/inbred lines (Table 4). The polymorphism rate of the tested SSR markers was almost equal to or slightly higher than the corresponding rates (73.4/65.9, 57.9, 69.5%) for the previously developed SSR markers from GSSs (mainly BESs)/unique transcripts of B. napus,24,30 BACs of B. rapa20 and WGSs of B. oleracea.26 Obviously, the polymorphism rate of the tested SSR markers increased (from 67.5% to 85.9%) as the number of amplified bands increased (from 1 to >3). The polymorphism rate of the tested SSR markers decreased slightly from the mono- to tetranucleotide repeats, while it increased quickly from the penta- to hexanucleotide repeats. This inconsistency of the relationship between the SSR marker polymorphism level and the motif length was also observed frequently in the previous SSR marker evaluation experiments, such as in the tests of the 627 and 1000 SSR markers from the GSSs (mainly BESs) and unique transcripts, respectively, of B. napus,24,30 the 890 SSR markers from the BACs of B. rapa,20 the 1398 SSR markers from the WGSs of B. oleracea26 and the 1009 SSR markers from the assembled genomic sequences of cucumber.37 This type of inconsistency could be attributable to the observation that only a small number of SSR markers of the specific (usually long) motif length(s) have been used to investigate this relationship in all of the above-mentioned studies (e.g. only 21 and 12 penta- and hexanucleotide repeat SSR markers were tested in the current investigation), which worthwhile to develop more SSR markers with long motifs to further investigate the relationship between the SSR marker polymorphism level and the motif length. The polymorphism rate of the tested SSR markers was highly positively correlated with both the motif repeat number and the repeat length (r = 0.74 and 0.86, respectively), which was basically consistent with the previous reports in Brassica24,30 and other plant species, including cucumber37 and carrot.48 Both correlation coefficients in the current investigation were much higher than or equal to the corresponding values (0.21 and 0.41; 0.74 and _) that were estimated with the 627 SSR markers from the GSSs (mainly BESs) of B. napus24 or the 1009 SSR markers from the assembled genomic sequences of cucumber,37 respectively. Strikingly, the tested SSR markers that were designed from compound repeats were almost all (80 of 82; 97.6%) polymorphic across the six representative B. napus cultivars/inbred lines (Supplementary Table S8).Because the 1055 and 2919 tested SSR markers were developed from the sequence scaffolds of B. rapa and B. oleracea, respectively, they were thus designated as ‘BrSF’ and ‘BoSF’. To facilitate the effective utilization of these tested newly developed BrSF and BoSF SSR markers, the following useful information was provided (Supplementary Table S8): (i) the type, length, position and sequence of the microsatellite repeat; (ii) the name, sequences, annealing temperatures and expected product size of the primer pair; (iii) the number of in silico PCR product(s) in the assembled genomic sequences of the sequenced Brassica species (currently for B. rapa, B. oleracea and B. napus) and (iv) the polymorphism survey and number of fragment(s) amplified in six representative B. napus cultivars/inbred lines.4. Discussion4.1. The pattern of microsatellite distribution is likely conservative in BrassicaIn the current study, almost all of the important characteristics of microsatellite distribution in the assembled genomic sequences of the three recently sequenced Brassica crop species have been analysed and compared. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first report on the genome-wide analysis and comparison of the pattern of microsatellite distribution across the different species within the same genus in plants.First, the frequencies of microsatellites in the assembled genomic sequences of B. rapa (496.8 per Mb), B. oleracea (424.8 per Mb) and B. napus (420.6 per Mb) were similar, and all were higher than almost all of the previous estimations.20,21,24,26,42 The slightly higher frequency of microsatellites in B. rapa than in both B. oleracea and B. napus is likely attributable to the more concentrated distribution and lower content of TEs in the assembled genomic sequences of B. rapa than in B. oleracea and B. napus (Fig. 3) because the frequencies (285.5, 272.0 and 285.4 per Mb) of microsatellites in the coding DNA sequences of the three species are almost equal.49 Secondly, in accordance with the high correlation between these variables (Supplementary Table S1), the distributions with respect to the motif length, type and repeat number of microsatellites in the assembled genomic sequences of the three Brassica species were almost identical (Fig. 1; Supplementary Table S2). More specifically, both the dominant/major and absent/scarce mono- to hexanucleotide motifs in the assembled genomic sequences of the three Brassica species were mostly identical (Table 1; Supplementary Table S3). Interestingly, the dominant/major motifs were all A/T rich, while the absent/scarce motifs were mostly C/G rich, which corresponded well to the much higher A/T than C/G content in the analysed sequences. Thirdly, the repeat numbers of the corresponding repeats or motifs for the three Brassica species were mostly similar (Table 1; Supplementary Table S4). Fourthly, the total repeat length (=microsatellite number × motif length × motif repeat number) proportions of the corresponding repeats or motifs of microsatellites in the assembled genomic sequences of the three Brassica species were also mostly similar (Table 1; Supplementary Table S5). In addition, the genomic distributions of microsatellites in the assembled pseudochromosomes of B. rapa and B. oleracea were generally similar (Fig. 3).In conclusion, almost all of the analysed important characteristics of microsatellite distribution in the assembled genomic sequences of the three sequenced Brassica crop species were highly similar or almost identical, which suggests that the pattern of microsatellite distribution is likely conservative in Brassica. This circumstance is understandable because B. napus (AACC, 2n = 38) originated from the chromosome doubling after the very recent (˜0.01 MYA) natural hybridization between B. rapa (AA, 2n = 20) and B. oleracea (CC, 2n = 18),11 which diverged from a common ancestor only ˜5 MYA.504.2. Usefulness of the newly developed genome-wide Brassica SSR markersIn the current study, a total of 115 869, 185 662 and 356 522 SSR markers were successfully developed from the assembled genomic sequences of B. rapa, B. oleracea and B. napus, respectively (Table 3), with the frequencies of 408.2, 343.8 and 356.2 per Mb or one every 2.45, 2.91 and 2.81 kb. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first report on genome-wide SSR marker development in Brassica. Only a small proportion of the newly developed genome-wide SSR markers (5.2, 6.6 and 6.7% for B. rapa, B. oleracea and B. napus, respectively) were involved in the previously developed publicly available Brassica SSR markers (Supplementary Table S7), which suggests that most of the newly developed genome-wide SSR markers should represent the new SSR markers. The huge-number and high-frequency genome-wide SSR markers developed from the sequenced Brassica species in this study could be useful for many studies that require large-number and/or high-density molecular markers, such as high-density linkage map construction, gene/QTL fine mapping and genome-wide/regional association mapping.The acute physical positions of the majority of the newly developed genome-wide SSR markers of the sequenced Brassica species have been determined (http://oilcrops.info/SSRdb) based on the mapped sequence scaffolds (Supplementary Table S6) from which they are designed. In fact, the physical positions of most of the previously developed publicly available Brassica SSR markers have also been determined by in silico mapping against the pseudochromosomes of these sequenced Brassica species (http://oilcrops.info/SSRdb). The high-density SSR marker-based physical maps constructed in this study could be useful for the rapid selection of genome-wide SSR markers that are well distributed over these chromosomes for various genotyping applications.Because of the polyploidy nature of Brassica,45 the developed SSR markers usually amplify multiple fragments from the homologous DNA sequences, as revealed in the current (Supplementary Table S8) and previous12–14,22,24,26,27,29,30,42,51 studies in Brassica. This could complicate or cause errors in the genotype scoring due to the reciprocal overlapping and uncertain allelism of these fragments.33 However, only a small proportion of the previously developed publicly available Brassica SSR markers have been alleged to be single locus.33. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop more single-locus SSR markers to facilitate their application in Brassica. Previously, the single-locus SSR markers were developed by practical PCR amplification in a panel of inbred lines,33 which was time consuming, labour intensive, high cost and, thus, inefficient. In the current study, through the highly efficient in silico PCR analysis, a large number of newly developed genome-wide SSR markers (92 517, 121 169 and 93 084 for B. rapa, B. oleracea and B. napus, respectively) were found to generate one in silico PCR product in the assembled genomic sequences of the three sequenced Brassica species (Table 3). In addition, thousands of previously developed publicly available Brassica SSR markers were also found to generate one in silico PCR product in the assembled genomic sequences of these Brassica species (http://oilcrops.info/SSRdb). More importantly, most (88.4%) of the tested SSR markers, that generated one in silico PCR product in the assembled genomic sequences of B. napus, also amplified a single clear fragment in the six representative B. napus cultivars/inbred lines (Supplementary Table S8). These results suggest that SSR markers that generate one in silico PCR product should be the putative single-locus markers and could be especially useful. Interestingly, the proportion (27.9%) of the newly developed genome-wide Brassica SSR markers (Table 3), which generated one in silico PCR product in the assembled genomic sequences of B. napus, was close to the corresponding proportion (33.8%) of the previously developed 9858 SSR marker from the GSSs/unique transcripts of B. napus, the BACs of B. rapa and the GSSs of B. oleracea,33 which amplified a single clear fragment in six B. napus inbred lines.Also known as ‘functional’ markers,52 genic SSR markers are developed from genes and have a high transferability across related species.52 Although several studies have been conducted to develop genic SSR markers from the ESTs/unique transcripts of B. rapa,29,31,32B. oleracea31 and B. napus,30–32 the total number (<5000) of publicly available genic SSR markers has remained limited in Brassica (http://oilcrops.info/SSRdb). In the current study, a large number of newly developed genome-wide SSR markers (32 648, 33 228 and 58 952 for B. rapa, B. oleracea and B. napus, respectively) were involved in the annotated genes (Supplementary Table S7) and thus belonged to the genic SSR markers. Of these, only a small proportion (7.2, 6.1, 6.7% for B. rapa, B. oleracea and B. napus, respectively) was involved in the previously developed publicly available Brassica SSR markers (http://oilcrops.info/SSRdb). This finding suggests that most of these newly developed Brassica genic SSR markers could represent the new ‘functional’ markers, which should be highly useful in evolutionary studies,29 comparative mapping,32 candidate gene association mapping53 and molecular breeding.For the high transferability of SSR markers across the cultivated and wild Brassica species,27,33,54,55 the developed genome-wide SSR markers from B. rapa (AA, 2n = 20), B. oleracea (CC, 2n = 18) and B. napus (AACC, 2n = 38) should also be useful for B. nigra (BB, 2n = 16), B. juncea (AABB, 2n = 36), B. carinata (BBCC, 2n = 34) and other Brassica species. In addition, according to the previous marker transferability research,15,16,22,25 a considerable proportion of the newly developed genome-wide Brassica SSR markers (especially the genic SSR markers) should also be useful for the species that belong to other genera and tribes within the Brassicaceae family.More importantly, we also constructed an integrative SSR marker database for Brassica (http://oilcrops.info/SSRdb), which not only provides useful information on the newly developed genome-wide SSR markers from the sequenced Brassica species (currently only for B. rapa, B. oleracea and B. napus) but is also integrated with the previously developed publicly available Brassica SSR markers and the annotated genome components (mainly as genes and TEs). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive SSR marker database for Brassica until now, and it should be a significant contribution to the Brassica research community.4.3. Implications for SSR marker developmentThe numbers of clear fragment(s) amplified in the six representative B. napus cultivars/inbred lines for the 3974 tested SSR markers were usually equal or close to the numbers of in silico PCR product(s) in the assembled genomic sequences of B. napus (Supplementary Table S8). This finding suggests that the number of products amplified by SSR markers can be relatively accurately estimated by in silico PCR, which was in accordance with the previous reports in plants such as rice56 and Brachypodium.38 Therefore, the target microsatellite should be subjected to BLAST/in silico PCR analysis to estimate its copy number before SSR marker development, especially for the polyploidy species. In addition, most (88.4%) of the tested SSR markers that generate one in silico PCR product were also confirmed by practical PCR analysis (Supplementary Table S8). Therefore, the in silico identified single/low copy microsatellites should be preferential for marker development.Replication slippage and recombination are currently two major mechanisms that are responsible for microsatellite expansion or contraction.2,3,5,57 Because of the small numbers of the tested SSR markers of specific motif length(s), the relationship between the SSR marker polymorphism level and the motif length was usually inconsistent in both the current (Table 4) and previous20,24,26,30,37 studies. However, the general trend was similar: the SSR marker polymorphism level tended to decrease as the motif length increased. This relationship is understandable because shorter motifs allow more possible replication slippage events per unit length of DNA.58,59 In addition, the SSR marker polymorphism level was positively correlated with both the motif repeat number and the repeat length in both the current (r = 0.74 and 0.86, respectively) and previous37,47,48,60 studies. More importantly, the tested compound SSR markers were almost all (97.6%) polymorphic. These relationships are also understandable because more motifs, larger motif repeat number and longer repeat length give more opportunity for replication slippage.2 Therefore, microsatellites with a shorter motif length, larger motif repeat number, longer repeat length and especially the compound repeat should be preferential for marker development.It should be noted that a considerable proportion (Supplementary Table S7) of the newly developed genome-wide SSR markers from the sequenced Brassica species were involved in the so-called ‘mobile DNA sequences’ TEs61 and should thus be unstable. In addition, the SSR markers that are associated with TEs (especially retrotransposons) mostly generated tens to thousands of in silico PCR products (http://oilcrops.info/SSRdb). Therefore, caution should be observed with respect to marker development based on microsatellites that are associated with TEs (especially retrotransposons).Supplementary DataSupplementary Data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by the National Science and Technology Supporting Program (2010BAD01B02), the National Rapeseed Industry Technology System (CARS-13) and the Hubei Agricultural Science and Technology Innovation Center of China.Supplementary data"

The transcriptome analyses of Porteresia can lead to the identification of candidate genes involved in salinity and submergence tolerance. We sequenced the transcriptome of Porteresia under different conditions using Illumina platform and generated about 375 million high-quality reads. After optimized assembly, a total of 152 367 unique transcript sequences with average length of 794 bp were obtained. Many of these sequences might represent fragmented transcripts. Functional annotation revealed the presence of genes involved in diverse cellular processes and 2749 transcription factor (TF)-encoding genes in Porteresia. The differential gene expression analyses identified a total of 15 158 genes involved in salinity and/or submergence response(s). The stress-responsive members of different TF families, including MYB, bHLH, AP2-EREBP, WRKY, bZIP and NAC, were identified. We also revealed key metabolic pathways, including amino acid biosynthesis, hormone biosynthesis, secondary metabolite biosynthesis, carbohydrate metabolism and cell wall structures, involved in stress tolerance in Porteresia. The transcriptome analyses of Porteresia are expected to highlight genes/pathways involved in salinity and submergence tolerance of this halophyte species. The data can serve as a resource for unravelling the underlying mechanism and devising strategies to engineer salinity and submergence tolerance in rice.1. IntroductionHigh salinity is a severe and increasing constraint on the global crop production. Most of our major crops are highly susceptible to salinity, and there is an urgent need to address this problem. Salinity tolerance is a complex multigenic trait, which depends on a range of physiological processes. The salinity stress response has been studied in model crop plant rice,1–4 which represents a glycophyte plant and does not possess the capability to tolerate high salinity. The existence of wild halophytic species, which can grow not only in saline but also in submergence prone habitats, has been reported.5,6 These wild species may prove to be an important gene reservoir for improving salinity tolerance in crop plants via genetic engineering approaches.5–8Porteresia coarctata (Oryza coarctata) is a wild halophyte, which shows considerable adaptation to high salinity (20–40 dS m-1) and can also tolerate complete submergence in saline water for a long period.9Porteresia grows in abundance near coastal areas, where the vegetation is inundated twice a day with highly saline water. Although many salinity- and submergence-tolerant rice cultivars have also been identified,10–12 they seem to be much less tolerant than Porteresia. It is a close wild relative of rice and can serve as an important source of genes related to salinity and submergence tolerance.8,13 Some novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying salinity tolerance have been obtained from transcriptome and genome analyses of close halophyte relatives of Arabidopsis, Thellungiella halophila and T. parvula.14–16 A few studies have demonstrated that engineering of some genes from Porteresia, such as those involved in inositol metabolic pathway, can confer salinity tolerance in cultivated rice.17,18 However, only a few genes have been isolated from Porteresia so far. Furthermore, the effect of submergence stress and its combined effect with salinity have hardly been analysed.5 The discovery of more genes and metabolic pathways in wild species like Porteresia can provide a better strategy to impart salinity tolerance in cultivated rice.The availability of next-generation sequencing technologies provides a high-throughput, rapid and cost-effective means to sequence and characterize the transcriptome of non-model and wild species as well.19–21 In this study, we sequenced the transcriptome of Porteresia under different conditions using Illumina technology. The transcriptome assembly was generated to reveal the first picture of its gene content. We also analysed gene expression under salinity and submergence conditions and identified the genes and metabolic pathways involved in these stress responses. The data presented here will provide a very useful resource to engineer salinity and submergence tolerance stress in crop plant rice.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materialPorteresia coarctata (Roxb) Tateoka plants were collected from saline river banks (Matla) of the Sunderbans in the coastal region of Bay of Bengal, India. The plants were brought to the laboratory along with soil and water. The plants were washed carefully to remove soil from the leaves and roots. The plants were given different treatments, including control (RO water, control), low salinity (450 mM NaCl, salt450), high salinity (700 mM NaCl solution, salt700), submergence (fully submerged in RO water, submergence) and submergence in low salinity (fully submerged in 450 mM NaCl, salt + submergence). The plants were harvested in three biological replicates 12 h after the treatment.2.2. RNA isolation and sequencingTotal RNA was isolated from each tissue sample (control, salt450, salt700, submergence and salt + submergence) using TRI reagent (Sigma Life Science, USA). The quantity and quality of RNA samples were checked using Nanodrop (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Agilent Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Singapore). Equal amounts of total RNA from three biological replicates were pooled for all the five treated samples before library preparation. Sequencing of all the five samples was performed by the commercial service provider, Genotypic Technology Pvt. Ltd, Bangalore, India, each in one lane using an Illumina Genome Analyzer II to generate 100 base long paired-end reads. The raw data obtained were filtered through the standard Illumina pipeline. The filtered Fastq files were further subjected to more stringent quality control using the NGS QC Toolkit (v2.3) to remove the low-quality reads and reads containing adaptor/primer contamination.22 The high-quality filtered reads were used for further downstream processing. The entire sequence data generated in this study are available in the Gene Expression Omnibus database under the accession number GSE44913. The non-redundant Illumina reads were filtered using the CDHIT program (http://weizhong-lab.ucsd.edu/cd-hit/).2.3. Transcriptome assemblyDe novo transcriptome assembly was performed using various tools, including Velvet (v1.2.01), Oases (v0.2.04), ABySS (v1.2.6), Trinity (vr2012-05-18) and CLC Genomics Workbench (v4.7.2). Various parameters, including k-mer length, insert length and expected coverage, were optimized to obtain best assembly as described previously.23 Reference-based assembly was performed using the CLC Genomics Workbench using default parameters, and assembled consensus sequences were exported into a fasta file. The annotated cDNA sequences of japonica rice (Os-Nipponbare-Reference-IRGSP-1.0)24 available at Rice Genome Annotation Project (MSUv7.0; http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/) were used as a reference. Merged assembly was performed using the TGICL program (v2.0), with minimum overlap length of 40 and minimum percentage identity of 90 for overlaps. The quality of assemblies generated was assessed using the perl scripts given in the NGS QC Toolkit.2.4. Functional annotationBLASTX searches against rice proteome, UniRef90, UniRef100 and NCBI non-redundant nucleotide databases, were performed to assign a putative function to each Porteresia transcript. GOSlim terms to each transcript were assigned on the basis of their best significant match (E-value = 1e-10) rice protein to provide a broad overview of their function. An E-value cut-off of 1e-10 was used to identify orthologs between Porteresia and rice. The transcription factor (TF) encoding Porteresia transcripts were identified based on the hidden Markov model profile search of conserved domain present in each TF family as described previously.23 The statistical significance of the difference in the number of members between Porteresia and rice in each TF family was calculated via Fisher's exact test.2.5. Read mapping and gene expression analysisTo estimate the gene expression, all the high-quality reads from each condition were aligned on the transcriptome assembly using the RNA-Seq Analysis utility of CLC Genomics Workbench. A maximum of two mismatches were allowed for the alignments. The read counts for each tissue sample were normalized by calculating the read per kilobase per million for each transcript. The DESeq software (v1.10.1)25 was used for differential gene expression analysis. DESeq provides a simple and computationally faster method for quantitative measurement of gene expression based on the negative binomial distribution with variance and mean linked by local regression.25 We calculated the size factor for each sample for normalization of read count data using DESeq. A P-value cut-off of =0.05 and at least two-fold change was used to identify differentially expressed genes. Heatmaps showing expression profiles (log2 fold change) were generated using the MultiExperiment Viewer (MeV, v4.8). K-means clustering was performed using Euclidean distance matrix with 1000 iterations using MeV. Hierarchical clustering was performed using Euclidean distance matrix with a complete linkage rule using MeV.2.6. Gene ontology and pathway enrichment analysisThe best Arabidopsis hit corresponding to each Porteresia transcript was identified using BLAST search to study gene ontology (GO) enrichment. GO enrichment of different sets of differentially expressed genes was performed using the BiNGO tool.26 The metabolic pathway data available in the RiceCyc database of Gramene27 were analysed to identify the enriched metabolic pathways in various gene sets. Both the GO and pathway enrichment analyses were performed at P-value cut-off of =0.05 after applying Benjamini-Hochberg correction.2.7. Real-time PCR analysisFor real-time PCR analysis, gene-specific primers were designed using the Primer Express (v3.0) software (Applied Biosystems, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The primer sequences used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table S1. Real-time PCRs were performed as described.28 The expression of most suitable internal control gene for rice, UBQ5,29 in each sample was used for normalization. At least three independent biological replicates with three technical replicates of each biological replicates for each tissue sample were used for the analysis. The correlation between expression profiles of selected genes obtained from real-time PCR and RNA-seq data analyses was determined using MS Excel.3. Results3.1. Transcriptome sequencingTo generate the transcriptome of Porteresia, we collected tissue samples from plants kept in water (control) and those subjected to salinity and submerged conditions. For salinity stress, we kept the plants in 450 mM (salt450) and 700 mM (salt700) sodium chloride solutions and for submergence stress, plants were kept completely submerged in water (submergence) and 450 mM sodium chloride solution (salt + submergence) and collected the tissues after 12 h of treatment. Porteresia is a halophyte, which grows naturally in coastal region, where plants experience lunar tide and are exposed to submergence in saline sea water every 12 h. Therefore, to obtain maximum representation of genes involved in signalling and adaptation response under salinity and submergence stress, we selected time point of 12 h for the analysis in our study. The RNA-seq libraries were constructed and sequenced using an Illumina sequencing platform. We generated a total of more than 422 million reads from above five samples. After quality filtering, about 375 million high-quality reads (ranging from about 65 to 90 million reads for each sample) were obtained (Table 1). The average Phred quality score was at least 30 at each base position for filtered reads, indicating high quality of filtered reads (Supplementary Fig. S1).

Transcriptome assembly optimizationTo generate the optimal assembly of the Porteresia transcriptome, first, we performed de novo assembly using all the high-quality reads (374 759 624) and non-redundant reads (194 316 505) after removing duplicate reads from all the five samples. We used Velvet, Oases, ABySS, Trinity and CLC Genomics Workbench softwares to perform de novo assembly. The de novo assembly was generated at different k-mer lengths using these softwares. From each software, the best assembly output was selected based on the statistics (average and N50 contig lengths) and similarity with rice proteome (Supplementary Table S2). Among the various softwares, Oases generated the best assembly with largest average and N50 lengths at k-mer length of 59 for both datasets (Supplementary Table S2). However, only 34% and 29% rice proteins showed a significant hit with the assemblies generated from whole and non-redundant datasets, respectively. The assembly output from other softwares also exhibited very low similarity to rice proteins. As Porteresia is a wild relative of rice, higher similarity to rice proteins was expected. These results suggested that the output of de novo assembly was not optimal.Therefore, we followed a combined approach of both reference-based and de novo assemblies to generate the transcriptome of Porteresia. In the first step, we performed reference-based assembly using the CLC Genomics Workbench. We used all the reads from each sample to generate a consensus assembly (Supplementary Table S3). The average and N50 lengths of reference assembly were much higher when compared with de novo assemblies. The consensus assembly from all the five samples generated a total of 36 966 contigs with the average length of 1265 bp and N50 length of 1761 bp (Supplementary Table S3). This assembly utilized ~81% of the total reads. To identify the novel genes in Porteresia, as a second step, we performed de novo assembly of unused reads in the first step of reference-based assembly. We used different softwares (CLC, Trinity, ABySS, Velvet and Oases) and parameters to select the best assembly. Oases generated the best assembly with largest average (544 bp) and N50 (719 bp) contig lengths. However, the number of consensus sequences (161 160) generated was quite large. As a last step, we generated a merged assembly of the contigs generated in primary assemblies of two steps via TGICL program. Our earlier studies have shown that TGICL generates optimal merged assembly from the contigs of primary assemblies.23,30 This assembly resulted in a total of 152 367 (39 203 contigs and 113 164 singletons) unique sequences (referred as contigs) of at least 200 bp in length (Table 2). The average and N50 lengths of contigs were 794 and 1249 bp, respectively. The mapping of all the high-quality reads suggested that >95% of reads were used in the final merged assembly and average read depth of each contig was 2352. About 55% of rice proteins were represented in this assembly and >23% of rice proteins exhibited =70% coverage (Table 2).

Functional annotation of Porteresia transcriptomeThe unique set of transcripts generated above were designated as P. coarctata tentative consensus (PcTC) transcripts and assigned unique identifier number from PcTC000001 to PcTC152367. The whole transcriptome sequence is available at Porteresia Transcriptome Sequence web page (http://nipgr.res.in/mjain.html?Page=porteresia). The total transcriptome assembly size was ~121 Mb. About 48% of all the transcripts were longer than 500 bp and >24% transcripts were larger than 1000 bp (Supplementary Fig. S2). Most of the smaller transcripts were represented by the singletons (Supplementary Fig. S2). Many of these are expected to merge into larger transcripts, once more sequence data of larger read length become available. The average GC content and distribution of Porteresia transcripts were significantly different than that of rice (Supplementary Fig. S3), indicating substantial differences between rice and Porteresia genomes. Furthermore, to explore the putative function, we assigned gene description to each Porteresia transcript corresponding to the ortholog rice proteins and proteins in other databases. A gene description term could be assigned to ~36% of Porteresia transcripts. The lower percentage of annotated transcripts was because most of the smaller transcripts generated in the de novo assembly did not show significant similarity with known proteins in various databases and presumably represent species-specific genes.Based on their similarity with rice genes, Porteresia transcripts were assigned GOSlim terms under biological process, molecular function and cellular component categories. Among the biological process terms, biosynthetic process (20%) was most represented followed by nucleic acid metabolic process (15.3%) and response to stress (14.5%) (Fig. 1A). A high representation of response to stress category might contribute to the high salinity and submergence tolerance phenotype of Porteresia. The largest number of transcripts belonged to catalytic activity (16.1%), protein binding (15.1%) and hydrolase activity (12.3%) among the molecular function GOSlim terms. Among the cellular component terms, the transcripts related to membrane (18.5%) and plastid (17%) were the largest in number (Fig. 1A). We further analysed the Porteresia transcriptome to identify the TF-encoding genes. A total of 2749 transcripts encoding for TFs were identified. Among the 85 families represented in these transcripts, the MYB-domain (197) family TFs were most abundant followed by bHLH (150)- and NAC (147)-domain TFs (Fig. 1B). Although the total number of TFs was slightly higher in Porteresia (2749) than in rice (2452), we found significant differences in their distribution in certain families. Notably, the number of TFs predicted in Porteresia for bromodomain, zinc-finger CCHC and SNF2 families were significantly higher than rice. Likewise, the number of predicted TFs in AP2-EREBP, GRAS, MADS, TCP, TRAF and ZF-HD families were significantly lesser in Porteresia than in rice (Fig. 1B). These results suggest significant differences in the transcriptional machinery of the two species and might contribute to stress adaptation phenotype in Porteresia.

Differential gene expression analysisIn addition to the transcriptome construction, RNA-seq provides an opportunity to measure gene expression at the whole-genome level.31,32 To investigate the differential gene expression under different conditions, we mapped the reads from each sample on the Porteresia transcriptome. A total of 87–88% of the high-quality Illumina reads were mapped to the Porteresia transcripts (referred as genes hereafter) from each sample (Table 1). Differential gene expression analysis was performed using the DESeq software to identify the genes with altered expression under different conditions. A total of 15 158 genes exhibited differential expression under at least one stress condition analysed (Supplementary Table S4). The largest number of genes was differentially expressed in the plants subjected to submergence stress (5864) followed by both salinity and submergence stresses together (5787) (Fig. 2A). A total of 4841 and 4243 genes exhibited differential expression under low salinity (salt450) and high salinity (salt700) stress conditions, respectively. Under salinity stress, a larger number of genes were up-regulated (3020 under salt450 and 2553 under salt700) when compared with down-regulated genes (1821 under salt450 and 1690 under salt700). However, in contrast, the larger number of genes was down-regulated under submergence stress alone (3712) and salinity and submergence stresses together (3952) when compared with up-regulated genes (2152 for submergence and 1835 for salt + submergence) (Fig. 2A). Differential gene expression under different stress conditions.

The total number of genes differentially expressed under each condition is given on the top of each bar.

The total number of genes differentially expressed under each condition is given on the top of each bar. (B) Venn diagram showing the number of genes differentially expressed under specific or different stress conditions.Furthermore, we identified genes showing overlapping or specific response to different stress conditions as depicted in Fig. 2B. Interestingly, a larger fraction of genes (69.5%) exhibited response to a specific stress condition. Other 4625 (30.5%) genes were responsive to more than one stress conditions. The largest number of genes (2555) was commonly regulated by submergence and salt + submergence stresses. Notably, most of them (99.6%) exhibited similar response (681 up-regulated and 1865 down-regulated) under both conditions. However, among the 790 genes commonly regulated by both high salinity and submergence stresses, most (78.2%) exhibited opposite responses (473 up-regulated under high salinity but down-regulated under submergence stress and 145 down-regulated under high salinity but up-regulated under submergence stress). Interestingly, however, 84% of the 757 genes commonly regulated by low salinity and submergence stresses exhibited similar response. Only 957 genes exhibited differential expression under both low and high salinity conditions, but most of them (94.6%) were regulated in the same direction. A very small fraction of genes (116) were differentially regulated under all the stress conditions analysed. Furthermore, we performed K-means clustering analysis and generated 10 clusters with different gene expression patterns across different stress conditions analysed (Supplementary Fig. S4). Among the clusters generated, we identified four groups of genes with distinct gene expression patterns (Fig. 3). Group I genes were up-regulated under salinity and/or salt + submergence stress. Group II genes were down-regulated under submergence and salt + submergence stress. Group III genes were up-regulated under submergence and salt + submergence stress. Group IV genes were up-regulated under salinity stress. K-means clustering of expression profiles of genes differentially expressed under different stress conditions. The clustering was performed on log2 fold change for each gene under different stress conditions when compared with under control condition.

Stress response of transcription factor genesTFs are the regulatory proteins, which play a key role in stress responses. Remarkably, we detected the differential expression of at least 329 (~12%) TF-encoding genes under different stress conditions in Porteresia. A heatmap showing the differential expression of genes belonging to different TF families is shown in Fig. 4. At least one member of 55 TF families exhibited differential expression. Among the various families, the largest number (32) of NAC TF family genes was differentially expressed. The members of other TF families, including MYB/MYB-related (25), bZIP (25), bHLH (23), HSF (18) and WRKY (17), were also significantly represented in the differentially expressed genes. A total of 96, 118, 132 and 127 TF genes exhibited differential expression under low salinity, high salinity, submergence and salt + submergence stress conditions, respectively. Among the 118 TF genes differentially expressed under high salinity stress, 88 were up-regulated and 30 were down-regulated. The members of NAC, MYB/MYB-related and WRKY families were the most abundant among these genes. In contrast, among the 132 TF genes differentially expressed under submergence stress, 44 were up-regulated and 88 were down-regulated. The members of bHLH, bZIP, HSF, NAC and MYB/MYB-related families were most abundant among these genes. In addition, several zinc-finger TFs of different classes were also regulated under different stress conditions. The members of these TF families have been found to be regulated under salinity and submergence stresses in Arabidopsis, rice and halophytes.33–35 Altogether, these data suggest the extensive regulation of transcription under salinity and submergence stress.

Gene ontology and metabolic pathway enrichment analysis of stress-responsive genesTo investigate the major functional categories represented in the stress-responsive genes identified above, we performed GO enrichment analysis. Most evidently, besides response to stress, we found the GO terms associated with various metabolic processes, such as secondary metabolite (oxoacid, ketone, amino acid, oxylipin, flavonoid, phenylpropanoid and chorismate) biosynthesis and hormone (jasmonic acid, ethylene and abscisic acid, ABA) biosynthesis, were most enriched in the genes up-regulated under different stress conditions analysed (Fig. 5, Supplementary Fig. S5). In addition, the GO terms, photosynthesis, photorespiration, rRNA processing and transport were also found enriched in up-regulated genes. However, in the down-regulated genes under salinity stress, the GO terms associated with polysaccharide (glucan, carbohydrate and starch) metabolism were most significantly represented (Supplementary Figs S5 and S6). The genes with function in protein turn over (proteolysis, peptidase activity and proteasome assembly) were highly enriched under low salinity. Such genes have been found responsible for salinity stress adaptation in halophyte, T. halophila.33 Under submergence alone or along with salinity stress, the GO terms response to various stresses, response to ABA, generation of precursor metabolites and energy as well as rRNA metabolism were most enriched. The finding of up-regulation of genes associated with energy conservation via metabolism rearrangement to enhance ATP production and/or nullifying deleterious effects of oxygen radicals, reactive oxygen species and other toxic compounds under submergence has been reported earlier also.36,37 In addition, the GO terms, such as response to gibberellin stimulus, response to hydrogen per oxide and transport, were represented in the down-regulated genes under submergence stress (Supplementary Figs S5 and S6). The GO term, regulation of transcription, was also found enriched in the stress-responsive genes, which is consistent with differential expression of the large number of TF genes as described in previous section. Notably, we noticed the significant enrichment of cellular component GO term, cell wall, in the differentially expressed genes (Supplementary Fig. S7). The changes in transcript levels of a number of genes encoding cell wall-related proteins have been observed in halophyte, T. halophila, in response to abiotic stress conditions.35,38 Overall, the different groups of genes with distinct expression patterns were also found to be associated with similar GO terms (Supplementary Fig. S8). For instance, the GO terms, response to stress and hormones were enriched in Group II genes, whereas photosynthesis and secondary metabolite biosynthesis terms were most significant in Group III genes. Group IV genes were found enriched in tryptophan biosynthesis, cellular amino acid derivatives biosynthesis, response to jasmonic acid and cell death-related GO terms.

Therefore, we investigated the metabolic pathways significantly enriched in stress-responsive genes by integrating the stress-responsive gene set with metabolic pathway data available in the RiceCyc database. The pathways involved in amino acids biosynthesis, secondary metabolite biosynthesis, hormone biosynthesis, carbohydrate metabolism and cell wall structures were significantly overrepresented among stress-responsive genes (Fig. 6), which are in well agreement with GO enrichment analysis. A list of pathways affected under stress conditions are given in Supplementary Table S5. Most evidently, the genes involved in the biosynthesis of various amino acids, including tryptophan, valine, isoleucine, glycine, glutamate and serine, were significantly represented in stress-responsive genes. The pathways for various stress-related hormone biosynthesis, such as jasmonic acid, ethylene and ABA biosynthesis, were also enriched. The genes involved in jasmonic acid biosynthesis were up-regulated under salinity stress, whereas genes for ABA biosynthesis were up-regulated under salinity stress, but down-regulated under submergence stress (Fig. 6). The pathways involved in carbohydrate metabolism, such as starch degradation, trehalose biosynthesis and anaerobic respiration, were also overrepresented among the stress-responsive genes. The genes involved in anaerobic respiration were significantly up-regulated under submergence stress alone and along with salinity stress. The genes involved in anaerobic metabolism have been found regulated in response to submergence, flooding and O2 deprivation across the plant species too.35,39 Notably, the genes involved in cell wall structure biosynthesis, such as cellulose and suberin biosynthesis, were also significantly enriched. The pathways involved in serotonin amides biosynthesis, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, phospholipase activity and fatty acid derivative biosynthesis were also found enriched. A similar set of metabolic pathways were significantly represented in the different groups of genes with distinct expression patterns (Supplementary Table S6).

A colour version is available online.Interestingly, we detected the differential expression of several genes in Porteresia implicated in SUB1A-mediated submergence tolerance response.40 In addition to the genes involved in ethylene response, carbohydrate metabolism, photorespiration and anaerobic respiration, we found putative gibberellin biosynthesis genes regulated under submergence stress, which mediates shoot elongation. The expression of Alcohol Dehydrogenase, a marker gene for anoxia stress, was also up-regulated under submergence stress, consistent with previous findings.35,40–42 We detected differential expression of several putative expansin genes as well under submergence and/or salt + submergence stress. The expansins have been shown to play a major role in cell expansion under anoxic condition, prevalent under submergence stress.35,42,433.7. Real-time PCR validation of differential gene expressionWe validated the results of differential gene expression analysis obtained from RNA-seq data by real-time RT–PCR analysis. The expression of at least 10 randomly selected genes was analysed in the three biological replicates of five tissue samples representing different conditions. The analysis revealed similar expression pattern of all the selected genes in real-time PCR analysis as observed from RNA-seq data. The statistical analysis also showed very good correspondence (correlation coefficient of 0.792) among the results of real-time PCR and RNA-seq data analyses as shown in Fig. 7.

The correlation of gene expression results obtained from real-time PCR analysis and RNA-seq for 10 selected genes is shown.Validation of differential gene expression results obtained by RNA-seq.

DiscussionOver the past many years, considerable efforts have been made to understand the molecular mechanism of salinity tolerance/adaptation in plants. Several studies have reported the molecular responses of plants to salinity stress.1–4,34 However, only a few studies have been performed to analyse the submergence response.35,36,40 In the recent years, study of wild halophyte relatives has gained attention as models to investigate the mechanism of salinity and submergence tolerance due to their extreme tolerance/adaptability to these conditions.5,6 However, most of such studies are confined to close relatives of Arabidopsis, T. halophila and T. parvula.14–16 Recently, the transcriptome of a salinity-tolerant wild tomato species has also been reported.44 However, considering the complexity of salinity response and fundamental differences in the physiology of monocots and dicots, these dicot halophytes are not ideal models to understand the mechanism of salinity tolerance in monocot crop plants. Recently, the importance of P. coarctata, wild halophyte relative rice, has been recognized as a model to study stress tolerance in monocots and important source of genes for the improvement of rice via biotechnological approaches.8In the present study, we sequenced the transcriptome of Porteresia under different stress conditions using Illumina technology to explore its gene complement. Unexpectedly, Porteresia transcripts exhibited low similarity with rice proteins, suggesting significant differences between Porteresia and rice genomes. The similarity of Porteresia genes with rice was lower than that of other sequenced wild rice species.45,46 A substantial number of genes appeared specific to Porteresia because they do not have an ortholog in rice and other organisms as predicted based on the sequence similarity. Furthermore, we observed expansion or contraction of certain TF families in Porteresia vis-a-vis rice. This unique gene complement might provide means of stress adaptation in Porteresia. We identified a total of 15 158 genes responsive to salinity and/or submergence stress, which have been implicated in diverse biological processes and metabolic pathways. The genes involved in similar biological processes, such as photosynthesis, secondary metabolite biosynthesis, hormone biosynthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, cell wall-related enzymes and transport etc., have been implicated in salinity and/or submergence stress in Arabidopsis, rice and halophytes as well.33,35,38,40,41 A significant number of genes of unknown function were also differentially expressed under various stress conditions analysed, and many of these genes were presumably specific to Porteresia, which might also play a crucial role in stress adaptation.Several studies have demonstrated that TFs act as key regulators of plant response to environmental stimuli.47–49 The role of certain TF families, such as AP2-EREBP, MYB and NAC, in stress responses has been well established. We also observed the differential expression of members of these TF families under salinity and submergence stresses in Porteresia. We detected that most of TF genes differentially expressed under salinity stress are up-regulated, whereas most of differentially expressed TF genes under submergence stress are down-regulated. This is in accordance with the total number of genes differentially expressed showing up- and down-regulation under salinity and submergence stresses. These results suggest that overall transcriptional activity is induced under salinity stress, but repressed under submergence stress. Based on the analyses, we found that role of NAC, MYB and WRKY family TFs may be more crucial for salinity tolerance, whereas bZIP, bHLH, HSF and AP2-EREBP families play a major role during submergence stress. The role of SUBMERGENCE1 (SUB1) QTL in submergence tolerance is well known, which harbour a tandem cluster of AP2/ERF family genes.40,41,50,51 Recently, Niroula et al.52 proposed the existence of SUB1-dependent and -independent mechanisms involved in submergence tolerance in wild rice plants. However, further investigations are required to find the exact mechanism of submergence tolerance in Porteresia.Metabolic pathways maintain cellular homeostasis and are very important for imparting stress tolerance/adaptation in plants. We found significant enrichment of genes encoding key enzymes involved in important metabolic pathways under stress conditions in Porteresia. The production of secondary metabolites under stress condition has been well known as adaptive feature of plants. We also detected the enrichment of biosynthetic genes of certain secondary metabolites, such as hydroxycinnamic acid serotonin amides and phenylpropanoids etc., under stress conditions in Porteresia. Hydroxycinnamic acid serotonin amides have only been detected in rice, pepper and a few other plants so far and are supposed to act as antioxidants.53 Although their exact function is unclear, their antioxidant property may help encounter/adapt stress condition in Porteresia. Phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway of initial reactions (cinnamates biosynthesis) produces coumarate, which gives rise to a variety of secondary compounds such as flavonoids, stilbenes and lignin, which can help in protection against stress conditions.The plant hormones, ethylene and ABA are well known to be involved in adaptive response to environmental stresses. Jasmonic acid has primarily been implicated in defence response, but is involved in other stress responses as well.54 Furthermore, the biosynthesis of several secondary metabolites by jasmonates has been well documented,55–57 suggesting that biosynthesis of jasmonates may impart stress tolerance in plants via transcriptional activation of biosynthetic pathway of important secondary metabolites. The enzymes involved in cyclic methionine salvage pathway, which ensures ethylene biosynthesis via methionine recycling, were enriched under salinity stress.58 We observed up-regulation of ethylene biosynthesis genes under salinity and submergence stresses. Earlier reports have also shown the altered ethylene levels underwater, which activates genes associated with stress acclimation.41,50,59 ABA is a well-known stress implicated in plant stress responses, including salinity stress.60–63 The increased accumulation of ABA under salinity stress has been reported, which, in turn, activates several other genes to provide tolerance. However, under submergence stress, the levels of ABA are reduced.64 We also observed the down-regulation of ABA biosynthesis genes under submergence stress. Recently, it has been proposed that SUB1A gene delays leaf senescence via hormonal regulation, which can contribute to enhanced stress tolerance in rice.59The enrichment of various pathways related to carbohydrate metabolism, such as starch degradation, anaerobic respiration and trehalose biosynthesis, is in concordance with earlier reports, demonstrating that concentrations of soluble sugars increases under various abiotic stress conditions.65,66 The differential expression of genes related to carbohydrate metabolism in response to various abiotic stresses has been reported previously also.67 The sugars, sucrose and glucose either act as substrates for cellular respiration or act as osmolytes to maintain cell homeostasis.68,69 In fact, one of the present hypotheses for survival of rice under submergence stress is based on carbohydrate metabolism only.41,51,70 Trehalose has been proposed as osmoprotectant against various stresses. It has been demonstrated that accumulation of trehalose in rice plants results in increased soluble sugar content, which confers tolerance to different abiotic stresses.71,72 Furthermore, the elevated transcript levels of the genes associated with anaerobic respiration can allow plant cells to invoke the energy conserving mode of ATP production under submergence stress in Porteresia as speculated earlier.12,35 Recently, Miro and Ismail12 reviewed anaerobic respiration and starch degradation as the main traits associated with flooding tolerance in rice genotypes.The biosynthetic pathways for suberin and cellulose, major constituents of cell wall, were also found enriched in stress-responsive genes in Porteresia. Although the exact mechanism is not known, several studies have suggested a crucial role of cell wall in stress tolerance.73 The mutations in cellulose synthase genes have also been shown to alter stress tolerance in plants.74,75 Suberin is a primary constituent of primary cell wall of underground tissues and is analogous to cutin, which forms a layer on plant aerial parts to prevent the direct contact of epidermal cell with environment and thus, acts as a physical barrier to enhance plant resistance to abiotic stress. Based on the analysis of cutin biosynthesis mutants, it has been demonstrated that plant cuticle is required for the regulation of ABA biosynthesis and osmotic stress tolerance.76 Considering the similar biochemical nature of suberin and cutin, the increased biosynthesis of suberin may be crucial for stress tolerance in Porteresia. Furthermore, the characterization of enhanced submergence 1 (esb1) mutant provided evidence for the role of suberin in water balance, ion translocation and stress tolerance.77,78 Thus, alteration in the degree of suberization may result in improved stress tolerance in plants. Overall, it can be concluded that a well-organized transcriptional regulation is responsible for salinity and submergence tolerance in Porteresia. It will be very tempting to investigate the precise role of genes involved in the metabolic pathways enriched during salinity and submergence stresses in Porteresia. The genetic engineering of such candidate genes/pathways may confer stress tolerance in crop plants.In conclusion, we report the transcriptome sequence of wild halophyte rice, Porteresia. The results suggest that extensive transcriptional reprogramming under salinity and submergence stresses is responsible for tolerance to these stresses in Porteresia. The transcriptome analyses presented in this study provide several candidate genes involved in salinity and submergence tolerance, which can be used as potential targets for genetic engineering and opens new avenues for future investigations. The functional analyses of genes/pathways identified here along with investigations on non-coding regulatory RNAs, epigenetic modifications, biochemical complexity and metabolite profiling would be very useful to help understand the exact mechanism of salinity and submergence tolerance in Porteresia.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was financially supported by the core grant from NIPGR.

Recent development of genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) methods holds great promise for constructing high-resolution linkage maps in organisms lacking extensive genomic resources. In the present study, linkage mapping was conducted for a bivalve mollusc (Chlamys farreri) using a newly developed GBS method—2b-restriction site-associated DNA (2b-RAD). Genome survey sequencing was performed to generate a preliminary reference genome that was utilized to facilitate linkage and quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping in C. farreri. A high-resolution linkage map was constructed with a marker density (3806) that has, to our knowledge, never been achieved in any other molluscs. The linkage map covered nearly the whole genome (99.5%) with a resolution of 0.41 cM. QTL mapping and association analysis congruously revealed two growth-related QTLs and one potential sex-determination region. An important candidate QTL gene named PROP1, which functions in the regulation of growth hormone production in vertebrates, was identified from the growth-related QTL region detected on the linkage group LG3. We demonstrate that this linkage map can serve as an important platform for improving genome assembly and unifying multiple genomic resources. Our study, therefore, exemplifies how to build up an integrative genomic framework in a non-model organism.1. IntroductionHigh-resolution linkage maps are exceptionally valuable tools in many genetic and genomic applications, such as fine-scale quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping, characterization of recombination hotspots, comparative genome analysis and genome scaffolding. A key prerequisite for constructing a high-resolution linkage map is the availability of a large number of genetic markers (preferably, single-nucleotide polymorphisms—SNPs), which has been unfortunately out of reach for most non-model organisms until just a few years ago due to the huge investments in large-scale marker discovery and array-based genotyping. Recent advances in the next-generation sequencing technologies have revolutionized our ability to obtain massive genomic resources in a rapid and cost-effective manner and, therefore, greatly stimulate the development of a variety of genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) methods.1 Among available GBS methods, restriction site-associated DNA (RAD) has gained popularity for the construction of high-density linkage maps,1 and several methods with simpler RAD library preparation protocols have been developed.2,3 For example, Wang et al.2 have recently developed the 2b-RAD method by adopting Type IIB restriction enzymes to simplify RAD library preparation. The streamlined 2b-RAD method features even and tunable genome coverage, providing a flexible genotyping platform to diminish the extensive sequencing effort required for species with large genomes.Bivalves comprise ~14 000 species worldwide,4 constituting the second largest group of molluscs. Many bivalves are of economic importance and support both commercial fisheries and mariculture efforts. They make up an important source of food all over the world, with a production of over 11.7 million metric tons in 2008, corresponding to 22% of the global aquaculture production.5 Elucidation of genetic bases underlying economically important traits, such as growth and reproduction, has been a central task in bivalve genetic and breeding studies for the purpose of genetic improvement. Linkage maps have been constructed for many bivalve species with the aim for QTL mapping of important traits. However, the resolution of these maps is generally low (mostly 10–20 cM), thus limiting their usefulness in determining quantitative trait genes. Great progresses have been recently achieved by transcriptome sequencing for large-scale identification of candidate genes involved in bivalve growth and reproduction.6–10 Polymorphisms in some candidate genes have also been associated with the variation of bivalve growth traits.11,12 Bivalves exhibit fascinatingly diverse sexual patterning. Some species are dioecious, whereas some are simultaneous hermaphrodites with a few as protandrous hermaphrodites (male when young, then later become female) or proterogynous hermaphrodites (female when young, then later become male). Currently, the mechanism of sex determination remains poorly understood in bivalves. Some recent studies have associated the sex determination of bivalves with doubly uniparental inheritance (DUI) of mitochondria10,13 and a hypothetical model has been proposed.10 However, the generality of the proposed model is constrained because DUI is a peculiar mtDNA inheritance system that exists only in a few bivalve species.The scallop Chlamys farreri (Jones et Preston 1904) naturally distributes along the seacoasts of China, Japan and Korea, and is a commercially important bivalve species in China. With increasing acreage devoted to artificial farming, several issues such as declining production and frequent disease outbreaks have raised great concern in modern scallop aquaculture. Currently, genetic studies focusing on scallop growth, reproduction and immunity represent active research directions. Genetic and genomic resources for C. farreri have rapidly expanded, including low-density linkage,14–17 physical18 and cytogenetic maps,19 fosmid and bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries,20,21 a large number of expressed sequence tags.7,22 The direction of the present study was also shaped by our immediate need for building up an integrative genomic platform that unifies a variety of genomic resources, such as genome map, linkage map and physical map, and facilitates future genetic, genomic and breeding studies on C. farreri.2. Materials and methods2.1. Genome survey sequencing and gene annotationA two-year-old C. farreri individual was chosen for genome survey sequencing. Genomic DNA was extracted from its adductor muscle using the standard phenol/chloroform extraction method.23 Three paired-end DNA libraries with insert sizes of 175, 500 and 800 bp were constructed by following the Illumina's standard DNA library preparation protocol and were then sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq2000 platform.Raw reads were first filtered to remove low-quality reads resulting from base-calling duplications or adapter contamination. Clean reads were assembled using the SOAPdenovo software, which applies the de Bruijn graph structure to construct contigs. Subsequently, all reads were realigned to the contigs and the paired-end information was used to join unique contigs into scaffolds. Finally, intra-scaffold gaps were filled using paired-end extracted reads that had one read uniquely aligned on a contig and another read located in a gap region. Genomic sequences were archived in the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database (accession no. SRP018107).Our group has recently reported the most comprehensive transcriptome resource for C. farreri by 454 sequencing of cDNA libraries generated from diverse developmental stages and adult tissues,7 which provide an excellent basis for gene annotation of the obtained scaffolds. Genomic scaffolds were first annotated by aligning the 20 056 transcriptomic isogroup sequences (i.e. the longest isotig in each isogroup) onto these scaffolds using the GMAP program.24 To increase the annotation rate, the unannotated scaffolds were compared against the Swiss-Prot and non-redundant (NR) protein databases using BlastX, with an E-value threshold of 1E-4. For scaffolds without significant matches, tBlastX search with an E-value threshold of 1E-4 was conducted against the NR nucleotide database for further annotation. To increase computational speed, all Blast searches were limited to the top 10 significant hits for each query.2.2. Mapping familiesTwenty full-sib families were established in May 2009 by single-pair mating of ‘Penglai-Red’ scallops, an elite C. farreri strain developed by our group with features of red shell, fast growth and disease resistance. Growth-related traits including shell length, shell width, shell height and body weight were measured for all families at the age of 15 months. One of these families exhibiting high within-family variation of growth traits was chosen for linkage and QTL analysis.2.3. 2b-RAD sequencing2b-RAD libraries were prepared for two parents and 96 progenies by following the protocol developed by Wang et al.2 For the parents, standard BsaXI libraries were constructed, whereas for the progenies, reduced representation (RR) libraries were constructed using adaptors with 5'-NNT-3' overhangs to target a subset of all BsaXI fragments in the C. farreri genome. A unique barcode was incorporated into each library during library preparation, and then all libraries were pooled for single-end sequencing (1 × 50 bp) using an Illumina GA-II sequencer. All the 2b-RAD sequences were archived in the SRA database (accession no. SRA065207).2.4. Sequence data preprocessing and de novo genotypingRaw reads were first trimmed to remove adaptor sequences. The terminal 3-bp positions were excluded from each read to eliminate artefacts that might have arisen at ligation sites. Reads with no restriction sites or containing ambiguous base calls (N), long homopolymer regions (>10 bp), excessive numbers of low-quality positions (>5 positions with quality of <10) or mitochondrial origins were removed. The remaining trimmed, high-quality reads formed the basis for subsequent analysis.De novo 2b-RAD genotyping was performed using the RADtyping program v1.0 (http://www2.ouc.edu.cn/mollusk/detailen.asp?Id=727) under default parameters. The RADtyping program has recently been developed by our group, and it is an integrated pipeline that enables both accurate de novo codominant and dominant genotyping in mapping populations.2.5. Linkage map constructionSegregating markers that could be genotyped in at least 80% of the individuals were considered as high-quality markers and were retained for further analysis. For each segregating marker, goodness of fit of the observed with the expected Mendelian ratio was assessed using the <U+03C7>2 test, and those markers conforming to the expected Mendelian ratios (P = 0.05) were included in map construction. Linkage analysis was performed using the JoinMap 4.0 software.25 Sex-specific maps were first constructed for each parent. Maternal and paternal datasets were created using the function ‘Create Maternal and Paternal Population Nodes’ in the JoinMap program, which was also used to partition 1:2:1-type data into 1:1 female-type and 1:1 male-type data. A logarithm of odds (LOD) threshold of at least 6.0 was used to assign markers into linkage groups. The regression mapping algorithm was selected for map construction. The Kosambi mapping function was used to convert the recombination frequencies into map distances (centiMorgans). A consensus map was established by integrating the sex-specific maps through shared markers using the MergeMap software.262.6. QTL mapping and association analyses of growth traits and sexThe distributions of growth traits were first assessed using the univariate procedure of MATLAB software to check whether they followed normal distributions. Pearson correlations among four growth traits were calculated using pairwise comparison.Association analysis was performed as a complement approach to QTL mapping, which was implemented using an R package called ‘GWAF’30 that tests genetic association between genotypes and traits by fitting a linear model accounting for within full-sib pedigree correlation. The additive model in GWAF was selected by use of the kinship coefficient matrix in the analysis to avoid false positives owing to unexpected familial correlation. The functions ‘lme.batch’ and ‘gee.lgst.batch’ were used to perform a global test (i.e. Wald <U+03C7>2 test) of genotypic effects with growth traits and sex, respectively. Bonferroni correction was carried out to account for multiple comparisons.2.7. Integration of the linkage map, genomic scaffolds and a physical mapTo associate genomic scaffolds with the linkage map, all markers in the linkage map were mapped onto the scaffolds using the SOAP2 software31 (parameters –M 4, -v 2). Marker-associated scaffolds were further used as linkers to integrate the linkage map with a BAC-based physical map previously constructed for C. farreri.18 These scaffold sequences were compared against available BAC-end sequences (BESs) using BlastN with an E-value cut-off of 1E-10. A reciprocal comparison was performed to ensure one-to-one matches between the scaffolds and BAC contigs.3. Results3.1. Genome survey sequencing of C. farreriThe genome size of C. farreri is relatively large and was previously estimated as ~1.2 Gb.20 Genome survey sequencing was performed for a single C. farreri individual by sequencing three paired-end DNA libraries with insert sizes of 175, 500 and 800 bp based on the Illumina HiSeq2000 platform. In total, 62.4 Gb of sequencing data, equivalent to ~52× genome coverage, were produced (Table 1). K-mer analysis revealed remarkably high heterozygosity (~1.4%) in the C. farreri genome (Fig. 1). Owing to the high genome heterozygosity, assembly of these data produced a large number of small scaffolds (N50 = 1.5 kb), with the longest one only reached to 46 kb (Table 2). All the scaffold sequences are accessible at http://ipl.ouc.edu.cn/fuxiaoteng/cf_SRA_data. Of 20 056 isogroups in the C. farreri transcriptome,7 18 316 (91.3%) could match with 16 489 genomic scaffolds, suggesting that the majority of genes were present in our reference genome dataset. Of the mapped transcriptomic isogroups, 88.4% had been functionally annotated through the homology-based comparison against public databases. Summing up all scaffolds resulted in a total length of ~870 Mb, corresponding to ~70% of genome coverage; though not complete, it constitutes the most informative reference genome currently available for C. farreri.

Optimization of a 2b-RAD sequencing plan for linkage mappingBecause of the large genome size (~1.2 Gb) of C. farreri, it is necessary to devise a cost-effective sequencing plan that can balance the total sequencing cost and genotyping accuracy. In total, 210 570 BsaXI sites were identified from the reference genome dataset. Based on the genome coverage (~70%) of this dataset, the total number of BsaXI sites in the C. farreri genome was estimated as ~0.3 million. Sequencing all of the BsaXI sites to 20× for a large mapping population (e.g. hundreds of individuals) would require a large sequencing investment. A notable feature of the 2b-RAD method is its ability to fine tune marker density as needed by constructing RR libraries using less-degenerate adaptors.2 For example, an RR library constructed using adaptors with 5'-NNT-3' overhangs only targets ~1/10th of all the BsaXI sites in the C. farreri genome, and sequencing of such a library to 20× would require only 0.6 million reads per individual (in contrast to 6 million reads per individual for a standard BsaXI library), thus dramatically reducing the total sequencing cost.3.3. 2b-RAD sequencing of a C. farreri mapping populationBased on the calculations above, RR libraries were constructed for a C. farreri mapping population, sequencing of which produced 0.6–1.2 million high-quality reads per progeny. For the parents, standard libraries were constructed and sequenced to a sufficient depth (70–80×). As shown in Fig. 2, target sites of the RR libraries could be reproducibly detected among different progenies and their average sequencing coverage was ~6-fold higher than that of standard libraries. The sequencing depth for progenies ranged from 13.4 to 23.8 with an average of 16.75. Clustering parental reads resulted in 181 625 representative reference sites consisting of 138 141 parent-shared sites and 43 484 parent-specific sites. After filtering low-quality sites, 117 113 parent-shared and 35 799 parent-specific sites remained. These reference sites contained 92% of the unique BsaXI sites inferred from the scaffolds, suggesting that unique sites were well represented in the high-quality reference sites. Distribution of sequencing coverage for target sites derived from 365 randomly chosen C. farreri scaffolds (concatenated). For parents, sequencing data were generated from standard BsaXI libraries, whereas for progenies, RR libraries were sequenced.

High-resolution linkage mappingIn total, 7458 polymorphic markers were identified, of which 6842 were heterozygous in at least one parent, including 2196 co-dominant and 4646 dominant markers. Dominant markers showing 3 : 1 segregation pattern in progenies were not included in subsequent analysis due to their inability to construct sex-specific maps. Totally, 4881 markers that conformed to the expected Mendelian ratios (P = 0.05) were included in the linkage analysis. These markers were partitioned into maternal (1 : 1 female type; 2473 markers) and paternal (1 : 1 male type; 2175 markers) datasets for constructing sex-specific linkage maps. At the LOD threshold of 6.0, the markers were grouped into 19 linkage groups, corresponding to the haploid chromosome number of C. farreri.32 The female map contained 2025 markers and spanned 1175.4 cM with an average marker interval of 0.59 cM, whereas the male map contained 1861 markers and spanned 1154.9 cM with an average marker interval of 0.62 cM. Significant differences in recombination rates between the female and male maps were observed for linkage groups LG5, LG8, LG10 and LG15 (Table 3). LG5 and LG10 showed higher recombination rates in females than in males, whereas the contrary was found for LG8 and LG15. Summary of the consensus linkage map in C. farreriSummary of the consensus linkage map in C. farreriThe sex-specific maps were further integrated using anchor markers that were heterozygous in both parents. The consensus map contained 3806 markers (Fig. 3, Table 3) and spanned 1543.4 cM with an average marker interval of 0.41 cM. The length of each linkage group ranged from 54.9 to 99.6 cM, and the marker density varied from 123 to 274 across the linkage groups. Mapping all the markers to the annotated genomic scaffolds revealed 623 markers (18–53 per linkage group; Table 3) that resided in or close to genes. These markers represent a valuable resource for future comparative genome analysis.

Genome coverage of the consensus map was nearly complete and reached 99.5%. Given the estimated genome size of ~1.2 Gb for C. farreri,20 the average recombination rate across all the linkage groups was ~1.3 cM/Mb.3.5. QTL mapping and association analyses of growth traits and sexPairwise comparisons among five growth traits using Pearson's correlation revealed that all of them were highly correlated with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.77 to 0.96 (Table 4). The strongest correlation was observed between shell length and shell height (r = 0.96, P = 1E-10). A genome scan for these growth traits showed that they exhibited quite similar LOD profiles (Fig. 4), indicating that these traits were possibly regulated by the same set of genes. Therefore, a principle component analysis was conducted, which revealed that the first principal component (PC1) explained ~90% of the total phenotypic variation (Fig. 5). To increase the QTL detection power, PC1 was utilized as a composite trait for QTL mapping. Two significant QTLs were detected on LG1 and LG3 (Fig. 6a and Table 5) and the one on LG3 that passed the genome-wide significance threshold showed a stronger QTL signal. The two QTLs explained 11.4 and 16.9% of the total phenotypic variation, respectively. Given the high marker density in the linkage map, association analysis was also performed to serve as a complementary approach to evaluate the QTL mapping results. Association analysis revealed a similar distribution pattern across all linkage groups as in QTL mapping analysis (Fig. 6a) and supported QTL mapping results in general. Within the confidence interval of the QTL detected on LG3, one marker named f68558 was found to be located in the intron region of a transcription factor gene, PROP1 (Homeobox protein prophet of Pit-1) (Fig. 7 and Supplementary Table S1). It has been shown that PROP1 can regulate the production of growth hormone,35 a peptide that simulates growth, cell reproduction and regeneration in animals. Identification of PROP1 within the QTL region suggests that this gene may represent an important candidate QTL gene that is worthy of further investigation.

Moreover, no global difference (female : male = 1.01) in the recombination rate was observed for this linkage group between the two sex-specific maps (Table 3). Association analysis revealed 27 sex-related markers with high statistical significance (P < 1E-6; Supplementary Table S2) and all of them fell into the narrow QTL region identified by the QTL mapping analysis. Interestingly, one sex-related marker named f93422 was located in the coding region of a transcription factor gene, ZNFX1 (NFX1-type zinc finger-containing 1), which has been shown to be tightly linked with AMHR2 (anti-Mullerian hormone receptor type II), the sex-determination gene in the tiger pufferfish, Takifugu rubripes.363.6. Integration of the linkage map, genomic scaffolds and a physical mapA high-resolution linkage map can serve as an important platform for integrating multiple genomic resources. One such application is to improve genome assembly by orienting genomic scaffolds. For C. farreri, a majority of larger genomic scaffolds contained at least one BsaXI site (77% for scaffolds of > 5kb; 92% for scaffolds of >10 kb) and therefore, it could be potentially oriented using a high-density linkage map. Of the 3806 markers in the consensus linkage map, 2174 could be unambiguously anchored to scaffolds. These scaffolds were not only useful for directing a higher-level genome assembly, but also could serve as ‘long’ surrogates for 2b-RAD tags to enhance their utility in unifying genomic resources. To demonstrate this potential, we attempted to integrate the linkage map with a BAC-based physical map previously constructed for C. farreri.18 The physical map contained 2514 BAC contigs that had BESs; however, a large fraction of them had only a few BESs (e.g. 73% with less than three sequenced BAC clones), thus limiting the integration efficiency. Even so, 681 BAC contigs could still be linked with the linkage map through sequence comparison between BESs and marker-associated scaffolds (Supplementary dataset). An example showing the integration of LG1 and BAC contigs is present in Fig. 8. Schematic demonstration of the integration of linkage group LG1, genomic scaffolds and a BAC-based physical map.Schematic demonstration of the integration of linkage group LG1, genomic scaffolds and a BAC-based physical map.4. Discussion4.1. Genome sequencing in bivalvesIn spite of species abundance and diverse geographical distribution, little effort has been devoted to decoding bivalve genomes. To date, whole-genome sequencing has been performed for only two bivalve species, i.e. Pearl oyster (Pinctada fucata)37 and Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas),38 providing the first glimpse into bivalve genome architecture. Apparently, genome sequencing of a broader range of bivalves would enable a better understanding of their phylogeny, speciation and diversification. Our study represents the first step towards fully decoding a scallop genome. Genome analysis revealed that C. farreri possesses a highly heterozygous genome. This finding is not unusual and has been reported in other bivalve species.37,38 For example, it has been shown that, for the Pacific oyster, average density of SNPs is one SNP per 60 bp in coding regions and one per 40 bp in non-coding regions.39 High genome heterozygosity poses the challenge of efficient genome assembly. In such instance, a high-resolution linkage map would be much valuable in that they can orientate the small scaffolds to improve genome assembly.4.2. Devising an optimal 2b-RAD sequencing plan for linkage mappingLarge-scale linkage mapping studies generally call for a cost-effective sequencing plan that reasonably balances the sequencing cost and genotyping accuracy. Through simulation analysis, a sequencing depth of 20× for both parents and progenies can provide sufficiently high genotyping accuracy (>96%; unpublished data). Determining the amount of sequencing necessary for a desired sequencing depth would require the knowledge of a total number of restriction sites in a given genome. Without a reference genome, the total number of restriction sites can be simply predicted based on genome size and GC content by assuming sites that are Poisson distributed. However, it has been shown that such estimation departed considerably from the actual numbers in some instances.1 Our study demonstrates that genome survey sequencing can facilitate devising an optimal 2b-RAD sequencing plan by providing sufficient genome information to determine the minimal amount of sequencing required for a given sequencing depth. Meanwhile, the obtained genome information can also be used to enhance de novo 2b-RAD analysis in many other aspects, such as evaluation of the efficiency and reliability of de novo reference site reconstruction, identification of genes surrounding 2b-RAD tags and association of 2b-RAD tags with public genomic resources.For species with very large genomes, sequencing all BsaXI sites at a depth of 20× for all individuals remains a substantial investment. For example, sequencing 200 human individuals with the genome size of ~3 Gb would require 5.2 billion reads, which are approximately equivalent to the number of reads produced from >4 full sequencing runs using the HiSeq2000 platform. One advantage of 2b-RAD methodology is the option to adjust marker density to the desired level using selective adaptors. Sequencing cost can be further reduced by sequencing a subset of BsaXI sites deriving from RR libraries. We have demonstrated that sequencing a C. farreri RR library only required about one-sixth of the sequencing cost for a standard library at a given sequencing coverage, thus reducing the total sequencing cost dramatically. Therefore, sequencing RR libraries represents an effective option for large-scale linkage mapping studies dealing with species with large genomes.4.3. Linkage map construction and QTL analysisThus far, linkage maps have been constructed for many bivalve species including C. farreri.14–17 However, these maps were usually built using hundreds of markers and the resolution was generally low (mostly 10–20 cM), limiting their use in fine-scale QTL mapping and many other applications. In this study, the linkage map constructed for C. farreri contained 3806 markers, a marker density that has, to our knowledge, never been reached for any other bivalve species. This linkage map covered nearly the whole genome (99.5%) with a resolution of 0.41 cM. In addition, ~10% of the markers in the linkage map residing in or close to genes as revealed by mapping them to the annotated genomic scaffolds. Our map, therefore, provides sufficient resolution for fine-scale QTL mapping and facilitates the discovery of quantitative trait genes.Growth traits are of particular interest to scallop researchers due to their high commercial significance in scallop aquaculture. QTL mapping represents an efficient approach to identify genetic loci underlying these traits for marker-assisted selection in genetic breeding. Two growth-related QTLs were detected on the linkage groups LG1 and LG3, which are also supported by the association analysis, a complementary approach to evaluate the QTL mapping results. The markers located at the confidence intervals of these QTLs constitute a valuable marker set for further evaluation of their utility in marker-assisted selection. In particular, the homeotic gene PROP1, which was identified from the QTL region on LG3, drew our great interest. This gene encodes a paired-like homeodomain protein that is necessary for PIT1 (growth hormone factor 1) expression. In mammals, mutations in this gene can result in impaired production of growth hormone and other pituitary hormones.35 Polymorphisms in this gene have been associated with production traits in livestock animals, such as cattle,40 goats 41,42 and sheep.43 The marker f68558 is probably not the causal locus that is responsible for growth trait variation in C. farreri. Instead, we think it is more likely that f68558 is in tight linkage disequilibrium with the causal mutation that is possibly located in the regulatory region (e.g. promoter) of PROP1. The expression level of PROP1 has been checked in major adult tissues (e.g. adductor muscle, digestive gland, gill, mantle, male and female gonads and kidney) of C. farreri. It turned out that PROP1 was not expressed in neither of these tissues (data not shown), suggesting that scallop PROP1 is probably expressed and functioning during early embryonic development just like its homologues in vertebrates. In vertebrates, PROP1 is only temporarily expressed during early pituitary development.44 However, determining the temporal and spatial expression of PROP1 in bivalves is not straightforward, since the counterpart of pituitary has not been established in bivalves. Further work would be needed to overcome these barriers to evaluate the role(s) of PROP1 in scallop growth regulation.Unlike many other animals, scallops do not possess recognizable heteromorphic sex chromosomes,45 and little is currently known about their sex-determination mechanism. The use of molecular markers in mapping experiments to identify regions involved in sex determination represents an efficient approach to study sex-determination systems in species without heteromorphic sex chromosomes. In this study, both QTL mapping and association analysis revealed a highly significant sex-related QTL on LG11, suggesting the presence of a narrow sex-determination region (34.61–34.98 cM) in C. farreri. No global differences in recombination rates were detected for LG11 between the two sexes, which may account for the indistinguishable morphologies of sex chromosomes in C. farreri. Interestingly, we found that one sex-related marker (i.e. f93422) was situated at the transcription factor gene, ZNFX1, which has been shown to be tightly linked with the sex-determination gene AMHR2 in the tiger pufferfish.36 Unfortunately, we do not have direct evidence to support the physical linkage between ZNFX1 and AMHR2 based on the available C. farreri genome information. Furthermore, searching another two molluscan genomes, i.e. the Pacific oyster C. gigas (http://gigadb.org/pacific_oyster) and the owl limpet Lottia gigantea (http://metazoa.ensembl.org/Lottia_gigantea), did not support the two genes' linkage either, though this does not necessarily exclude the possibility of their physical linkage because these genome assemblies are still largely fragmented (scaffold N50 is 401 kb for C. gigas38 and 1.87 Mb for L. gigantean46). Our group has initiated the whole-genome sequencing project for C. farreri; therefore, this issue will be settled in the near future.4.4. Integration of the linkage map with multiple genomic resourcesRecent studies have shown that RAD-based linkage maps can greatly improve large-scale genome assembly.47,48 However, RAD tags are usually short in length (35–100 bp), thus limiting their direct use for integration with other important genomic resources generated from RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, exome sequencing or BAC–fosmid-end sequencing. Here, we propose that RAD tags can be effectively extended using the scaffolds obtained from genome survey sequencing. For C. farreri, although a majority of the scaffolds were not very long (scaffold N50 = 1.5 kb), they could already serve as ‘long’ surrogates for 2b-RAD tags to enhance their utility. We have demonstrated that this approach could facilitate the integration of the scallop linkage map with the BAC-based physical map, even though a large fraction of BAC contigs contained only a few BESs (e.g. 73% with less than three sequenced BAC clones). Besides, such approach can also facilitate the identification of genes surrounding a given tag, which can be crucial for the identification of quantitative trait genes in QTL mapping and association studies. Therefore, it can be envisioned that this scallop linkage map would serve as an important platform for unifying genomic resources that have been accumulated for C. farreri.4.5. ConclusionsWe generated a preliminary reference genome for a bivalve mollusc, expanding the genome resources currently available for bivalves—a group of animals that remain largely unexplored in terms of genome sequencing. A high-resolution linkage map was constructed for C. farreri with a marker density that has, to our knowledge, never been achieved in any other molluscs. Two growth-related QTLs and one putative sex-determination region were detected, and candidate genes identified from these QTL regions represent important targets for further evaluation. Integration of the genome map, linkage map and physical map exemplifies how to build up a comprehensive genomic framework in a non-model organism.Supplementary DataSupplementary Data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31130054), National Basic Research Program of China (2010CB126402), National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (2012AA10A402, 2012AA10A405 and 2012AA092204) and Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars of Shandong Province (2013JQE29001).We thank Dr Xiaojun Zhang (Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences) for kindly providing the physical map data.Supplementary data"
