2,10.1093/dnares/1.1.1,Systematic Sequencing of the 180 Kilobase Region of the Bacillus Subtilis Chromosome Containing the Replication Origin,"Naotake Ogasawara,Sumiko Nakai,Hiroshi Yoshikawa",NO,NO,NO,1-Feb-94,"Bacillus subtilis, genome sequencing project, systematic sequencing, open reading frame"," We have determined a 180 kb contiguous sequence in the replication origin region of the Bacillus subtilis chromosome. Open reading frames (ORF) in this region were unambiguously identified from the determined sequence, using criteria characteristic for the B. subtilis gene structure, i.e., starting with an ATG, GTG or TTG codon preceded by sequences complementary to the 3' end of the 16S rRNA. Four rRNA gene sets, 7 individual tRNA genes and 1 scRNA gene were identified, occupying 20 kb in total. In the remaining 160 kb region, 158 ORFs were identified, suggesting that 1 ORF is coded on average by 1 kb of DNA of the B. subtilis genome. Among the 158 ORFs, the functions of 48 ORFs were assigned and those of 11 ORFs are suggested through significant similarities to known proteins present in data banks. However, the functions of more than half of the ORFs (63%) remain to be determined. "
3,10.1093/dnares/1.1.15,Characterization of cDNAs Induced in Meiotic Prophase in Lily Microsporocytes,"Toshiyuki Kobayashi,Etsuko Kobayashi,Shusei Sato,Yasuo Hotta,Nobuyuki Miyajima,Ayako Tanaka,Satoshi Tabata",NO,NO,NO,1-Feb-94,"meiosis, zygotene, stage-specific genes, cDNA, Lilium longiflorum"," To identify and analyze genes functioning during reproductive cell formation in higher plants, cDNAs harboring the messages induced in meiotic prophase were isolated and characterized. A cDNA library constructed from microsporocytes in meiotic prophase of Lilium longiflorum was screened with a subtraction probe specific to meiotic prophase. Clones selected were classified into 18 groups by cross hybridization and partial sequencing. Northern blot analysis revealed that the transcripts corresponding to the respective cDNA groups began accumulating at the early stages of meiosis and exhibited clone-specific profiles during meiosis and the spore formation process. The amino acid sequences of the predicted gene products showed similarity with known gene products, e.g. heat shock proteins, serine proteases in Bacillus , and RAD 51 gene product in yeast. Half of the putative gene products had hydrophobic N-terminal regions, suggesting that they may function as signal peptides. "

The Coding Sequences of 40 New Genes (KIAA0001-KIAA0040) Deduced by Analysis of Randomly Sampled cDNA Clones from Human Immature Myeloid Cell Line KG-1,"Nobuo Nomura,Nobuyuki Miyajima,Takashi Sazuka,Ayako Tanaka,Yutaka Kawarabayasi,Shusei Sato,Takahiro Nagase,Naohiko Seki,Ken-ichi Ishikawa,Satoshi Tabata",NO,NO,NO,1-Feb-94,"cDNA library, full-length cDNA sequence, unidentified human gene, protein motif, myeloid cell line KG-1","We established a protocol for the prediction of the coding sequences of unidentified human genes based on the double selection and sequence analysis of cDNA clones with inserts carrying unreported 5'-terminal sequences and with insert sizes corresponding to nearly full-length transcripts. By applying the protocol, cDNA clones with inserts longer than 2 kb were isolated from a cDNA library of human immature myeloid cell line KG-1, and the coding sequences of 40 new genes were predicted. A computer search of the sequences indicated that 20 genes contained sequences similar to known genes in the GenBank/EMBL databases. The sequences of the remaining 20 genes were entirely new, and characteristic protein motifs or domains were identified in 32 genes. Other sequence features noted were that the coding sequences of 23 genes were followed by relatively long stretches of 3'-untranslated sequences and that 5 genes contained repetitive sequences in their 3'-untranslated regions. The chromosomal location of these genes has been determined. By increasing the scale of the above analysis, the coding sequences of many unidentified genes can be predicted."
5,10.1093/dnares/1.1.37,An Expression Profile of Active Genes in Human Colonic Mucosa,"Kousaku Okubo,Junji Yoshii,Hideoki Yokouchi,Masao Kameyama,Kenichi Matsubara",NO,NO,NO,1-Feb-94,"cDNA sequencing, 3'-directed cDNA library, gene signatures, novel genes, tissue specificity","An expression profile of genes active in the human colonic mucosa was obtained by collecting 959 partial sequences from a 3'-directed cDNA library. Seven genes were found to produce mRNA each of which comprized more than 1% of total mRNA. Four of these genes are novel, and are likely to be uniquely expressed in the colonic mucosa, and the other three have been identified as genes for fatty acid binding protein, immunoglobulin lambda chain, and carcinoma-associated antigen GA733-2. In the remaining 952 clones, 310 were composed of 118 species occurred recurrently but less than 1%, and 533 clones appeared only once. Because the 3'-directed cDNA library faithfully represents the mRNA population in the source tissue, these numbers represent the relative activities of the gene expression.Altogether 156 gene species were identified in GenBank, and a significant portion of these genes encode proteins found in Golgi apparatus and lysosomes, chromosome-encoded mitochondrial proteins, cell surface proteins, and components in the protein synthesis machinery. The types and proportions of genes identified is consistent with the known major activities of the colonic mucosa such as mucous protein production, energy-dependent water absorption, and rapid cell proliferation and turnover."
