We described a computational framework to construct a linkage–LD map from commonly used biallelic, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers for outcrossing plants by which the decline of LD is visualized with genetic distance. The framework was derived from an open-pollinated (OP) design composed of plants randomly sampled from a natural population and seeds from each sampled plant, enabling simultaneous estimation of the LD in the natural population and recombination fraction due to allelic co-segregation during meiosis. We modified the framework to infer evolutionary pasts of natural populations using those marker types that are segregating in a dominant manner, given their role in creating and maintaining population genetic diversity. A sophisticated two-level EM algorithm was implemented to estimate and retrieve the missing information of segregation characterized by dominant-segregating markers such as single methylation polymorphisms. The model was applied to study the relationship between linkage and LD for a non-model outcrossing species, a gymnosperm species, Torreya grandis, naturally distributed in mountains of the southeastern China. The linkage–LD map constructed from various types of molecular markers opens a powerful gateway for studying the history of plant evolution.1. IntroductionLinkage disequilibrium (LD), a concept to describe the non-random association of alleles at different loci, has been a focus of population genetic studies during the last several decades.1 However, since LD is affected by many evolutionary forces, the use of LD alone to infer the genetic structure of populations may generate spurious results.2 For this reason, how LD can be served as a more efficient tool has been one of the most important issues in population and evolutionary genetics. One of the strategies to resolve this issue is constructing a LD map from which to infer population history by visualizing the decline pattern of LD with genetic distance. This strategy has been widely used in human genetics3,4,5 and increasingly recognized in other species.6,7 Many of these LD maps are constructed from the relationship of pairwise LD with the physical distance of the same marker pair, which do not estimate the frequency of recombination between marker loci.The basic principle by which LD is used for historical inference results from its relationship with the recombination rate.1 Therefore, the estimation of the linkage, apart from estimating LD, is an essential step towards constructing a LD map. Wu and Zeng8 pioneered the application of a sampling design to simultaneously estimate these two parameters. By sampling parents randomly from a natural population and the seeds of the sampled parents, this design constructs a two-level hierarchic structure of molecular data, which enables the characterization of how different markers are associated in the original population and how the markers co-transmit their alleles in a Mendelian fashion from the parent to offspring. Lou et al.9 derived a close-form EM algorithm to estimate the LD and recombination rate within a unifying framework. Such a joint linkage–LD analysis has been applied to the genetic mapping of complex traits, leading to the identification of biologically validated quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for drought resistance in maize.10 More recently, this strategy has been modified to accommodate to the estimation of genetic imprinting11 and genetic variance.12 Pikkuhookana and Sillanpaa13 implemented a Bayesian algorithm for parameter estimation from this strategy.In this article, we described a general computational framework built on Wu and Zeng's8 open-pollinated design to construct a linkage–LD map using biallelic co-dominant markers. To make this framework more useful for a broader area of applications, we extended it to enable the utilization of dominant-segregating markers. Several recent studies have shown that epigenetic variation provides a source for the generation of phenotypic diversity in natural populations14,15 and also epigenetic marks, such as differential cytosine methylation, may be inherited and have experienced the pressure of natural selection.16 Thus, it has become increasingly important to construct a more comprehensive linkage–LD map by including methylation markers. In epigenetic population studies, there are many ways to score and analyse methylation-sensitive amplification polymorphisms, of which one common approach is to score those fragments that stay unmethylated as 1 and all others methylated as 0. This scoring approach leads to the segregation pattern of the so-called single methylation polymorphism (SMP) markers equivalent to that of dominant genetic markers.17 Lu et al.18 found a possibility of using three-point analysis to enhance the precision and power of linkage detection for dominant markers. Likewise, Li et al.19 developed a three-point analysis to analyse LD among three dominant markers and establish a procedure for testing and estimating multiple disequilibria at different orders. However, the simultaneous estimates of LD and recombination fraction between dominant markers are methodologically challenging, because their genotypes can little explain the information of allelic segregation. We implemented a two-level EM algorithm for joint linkage and LD analysis by modelling and retrieving the unobservable feature of segregating genotypes for dominant-inherited markers. An example was demonstrated to show the utility and usefulness of the model by analysing a real data collected from an OP design of an outcrossing species, Torreya grandis, naturally distributed in mountains of the southeastern China.2. Model2.1. Sampling strategyFrom a natural plant population at Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), we randomly sample n unrelated maternal individuals and open-pollinated seeds from each sampled plant. This constitutes a two-level hierarchic sampling setting in which both parental plants and their offspring are genotyped by the same set of molecular markers. Consider a pair of biallelic markers A and B, which generate nine joint genotypes, AABB (coded as 1), AABb (coded as 2), …, aabb (coded as 9). Let ni denotes the number of mother plants with marker genotype i, and nij denotes the number of offspring with marker genotype j derived from mother genotype i. Depending on the genotype of a mother, all offspring from her have different numbers of marker genotypes. Table 1 tabulates genotypic observations for the two-level hierarchic setting.

The co-dominant modelLet <U+03C9>1=12<U+03D5>(1-<U+03B8>)+12(1-<U+03D5>)<U+03B8>,<U+03C9>2=12<U+03D5><U+03B8>+12(1-<U+03D5>)(1-<U+03B8>)<U+2060>. Thus, overall haplotype frequencies produced by this parent are calculated as <U+03C9>1for AB or ab and <U+03C9>2 for Ab or aB.Below, an algorithmic procedure will be described to estimate the parameters that define the likelihood.The E and M steps are iterated between Equations (5) and (6) until convergence.The likelihoods under the H0 and H1 are calculated from which a log-likelihood ratio is calculated. By comparing this test statistic with a <U+03C7>2 threshold with two degrees of freedom, we can accept or reject H0.It is also needed to test the significance of D and <U+03B8> separately, showing how the two markers are related. Under the null hypothesis H0:D=0, parental diplotype and genotype frequencies can be simply expressed as a function of allele frequencies which can be estimated with no need of the EM algorithm. Similarly, under the null hypothesis H0:<U+03B8>=0.5<U+2060>, offspring diplotype and genotype frequencies within each family are simply expressed as function of the Mendelian segregation ratio so that no parameter needs to be estimated.2.3. The dominant modelMethylation-sensitive amplification polymorphisms can be scored as a dominant marker.17 For a dominant marker, the homozygote AA for the dominant allele cannot be distinguished from the heterozygote Aa. Thus, these two genotypes are observed as a single ‘phenotype’ (A_). For two dominant markers A and B, some cells for the observations and expected genotype frequencies in Tables 1 and 2 are collapsed in a way as shown in Tables 3 and 4, respectively. Let njA/jB denote the observed number of observations of a two-dominant marker genotype jA/jB, jA= A_ (coded as 1) or aa (coded as 0) and jB= B_ (coded as 1) or bb (coded as 0), in the parental population. Similarly, let njA/jBkA/kB denote the observation of progeny marker genotype kA/kB given its parent genotype jA/jB (Table 3). Frequencies of offspring genotypes from different mother genotypes are shown in Table 4.

The other F's can be interpreted in a similar way.The E and M steps between Equations (9) and (10) are iterated until the estimates are stable. The log-likelihood ratio under the null and alternative hypotheses is calculated and compared with a threshold determined from a <U+03C7>2 distribution.3. ApplicationWe used a real data analysis to demonstrate how the model is used to construct a linkage–LD map. According to Wu and Zeng's8 design, we sampled a natural population of Torreya grandis distributed in the southeastern China.20 In spite of the economic value of T. grandis, this species has not been extensively studied in population genetics. Zeng et al.21 constructed a first low-density genetic map for genus Torreya using an open-pollinated progeny derived from half-sib seeds of a landrace T. grandis ‘Merrillii’, providing basic information for marker genotyping of this species. We sampled 50 unrelated trees randomly from a natural population of T. grandis and 20 progeny for each sampled tree. In total, we obtained (50 + 50 × 20) = 1,050 trees, which were genotyped by 233 sequence-related amplified polymorphism (SRAP) markers. SRAPs are dominant-segregating markers,22 providing an excellent demonstration for the practical utility of our model. This data set constitutes a two-level hierarchic framework with a high level from the parents and a lower level from the progeny. We analysed each pair of these markers using the dominant model to simultaneously estimate the LD and recombination fraction and further test the significance of these two parameters.Of 233 × 232/2 = 27,028 pairs, 5,733 (21.21%) display significant non-random associations, and 2,140 (7.92%) are significantly linked. It was seen that much fewer pairs (1,239 or 4.58%) are both associated in the original natural population and linked when they co-transmitted during meiosis from the parent to progeny. All this suggests that, for many marker pairs, significant associations are inconsistent with significant linkage. In other words, a pair of unlinked markers may be associated with each other, and also a pair of linked markers may not necessarily have a significant LD. Significant associations of unlinked markers may be due to the impact of some recent evolutionary forces on these markers, whereas the absence of associations between linked markers implies that this particular region of the genome has experienced the random mating of numerous generations.23Based on the estimated pair-wise recombination fractions, we constructed a genetic linkage map using MapMaker software. Under the thresholds of <U+03B8> = 0.3 and LOD = 3.0, 233 markers were grouped into 8 linkage groups, but with 73 markers unlinked. Markers in each linkage group were ordered with an objective function of the sum of adjacent recombination fractions. When the optimal order of a linkage group was determined, the map distance between any two adjacent markers was calculated by Haldane's map function. To the end, we obtained a low-density genetic linkage map for T. grandis (Fig. 1). The total length of the map is 533.2 cM, with an average marker interval of 3.33 cM.

This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.By plotting pair-wise LD over the genetic distance, we constructed a LD map from which to infer the population history of T. grandis (Fig. 2). In general, the LD declines markedly with marker distance within the first 10 cM of genome, and this decrease quickly becomes gradual after this length. This trend suggests that the population of T. grandis sampled may have experienced a long evolutionary history in the environment where this species grows. However, there are quite a few pairs of unlinked markers beyond 10–20 cM of genetic distance which are associated with a large R2, suggesting that these loci may be subjected to some recent evolutionary forces. Further studies from single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are needed to characterize the biological function of these loci and relate this function to possible anthropological selection or climate change towards an in-depth understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms of T. grandis.

This figure was also used in the study by Sun et al.23. This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.From the distribution of all pair-wise LD, it was found that most pairs of markers do not display a large LD value (Fig. 3), conforming to the result inferred from Fig. 2 that this population may have undertaken a long evolutionary history. Although the LD coefficients tend to be larger between markers located within the same linkage group than between markers from different linkage groups (Fig. 3), a portion of between-group markers has a large LD. This suggests that the genome harbouring these markers may be under recent evolutionary forces. Differences in LD occurrence within and among linkage groups are visualized in Fig. 4. It can be seen that markers in linkage Group 7 are not only rarely associated with those from other linkage groups, but also display a sparse distribution of LD with those within the same linkage group. More specifically, of all 13 × 12/2 = 78 possible combinations between 13 markers of this group, only 15 (19.2%) pairs display significant associations. Yet, such percentages for other linkage groups, such as Groups 2 and 8, were observed to be >60%. A reduced frequency of significant associations in linkage Group 7 suggests that this part of the T. grandis genome may have experienced a long evolutionary history. Relative to linkage Group 7, linkage Groups 2 and 8 has much more frequent LD between different loci from the same and different linkage groups, implying that some recent pressure of natural selection may have taken place in this part of the genome.

Computer simulationTo examine the statistical properties of the model for constructing the LD map with dominant markers, we performed computer simulation by mimicking a natural population at HWE. We randomly sample a panel of unrelated open-pollinated families (each including a female parent and multiple offspring). Given a total of 1,000 progeny, the simulation considers three sampling strategies, 1,000 × 1 (1,000 maternals with a single offspring), 200 × 5 (200 maternals with 5 offspring) and 50 × 20 (50 maternals with 20 offspring). For each strategy, we simulated two co-dominant markers with strong and weak LD, D = 0.15 and 0.02, respectively, in the population. The allele frequencies for the two markers are pA = 0.6 vs. pa = 0.4 and pB = 0.5 vs. pb = 0.5, respectively. The two markers are linked with two sizes of then recombination fraction <U+03B8> = 0.20 and 0.05. In each design, 1,000 simulation replicates were performed to estimate the means of the MLEs for each parameter and their standard deviations. By collapsing the simulated co-dominant marker genotypes into a dominant setting, we can test how well our model performs to construct a dominant LD map.Table 5 gives the results of parameter estimates from simulation studies under different designs. As expected, because of more information contained, co-dominant markers provide better estimation of each parameter than dominant markers, although the drawback of the latter can be overcome by choosing an optimal sampling strategy. General trends of estimation precision of parameters are summarized as follows: (i) LD can be estimated with high accuracy and precision for both co-dominant and dominant markers under all simulation schemes considered. However, as expected, more small families perform better than fewer larger families, because the estimate of LD is based on the sampled parents from the original population. (ii) The estimation of the recombination fraction <U+03B8> is first dependent on the size of LD, followed by the degree of linkage and the sampling strategy. If LD is near zero, then <U+03D5> is close to 12 so that <U+03C9>1 and <U+03C9>2 will not contain <U+03B8>. Thus, <U+03B8> is not estimable when there is no association between the two markers. To better estimate the linkage, precise estimation of LD is essential. MLEs (±standard deviations) of allele frequencies, linkage disequilibrium and recombination fraction from 1,000 simulation replicates under different sampling strategiesMLEs (±standard deviations) of allele frequencies, linkage disequilibrium and recombination fraction from 1,000 simulation replicates under different sampling strategiesAn additional scenario of simulation was conducted by collapsing only one of the two co-dominant markers into a dominant status. As expected, this scenario was intermediate in the precision of parameter estimation between those in which both markers are co-dominant and dominant, respectively. We have also performed simulation studies using the same schemes described above, but by quantitatively changing the values of LD within its interval. This simulation allows us to determine the minimum value of LD beyond which <U+03B8> can be well estimated. In the package of software, we provide the function of determining such an LD value given a sampling strategy and allele frequencies.5. DiscussionSimilar to the HWE, significant departure from linkage equilibrium (LE) indicates that the population studied is undergoing some evolutionary pressure by extensive inbreeding, gene flow, genetic drift, mutation, natural selection, etc. However, unlike HWE, LE cannot be established in one generation of random mating, rather than it needs a number of generations to be reached, because LD declines at a rate that depends on the recombination fraction.1 For this reason, a test of LD about its departure from LE may tell us more stories about the evolutionary history of the population. Just because the use of LD to infer a population's past events is founded on its relationship with the frequency of recombination, a joint estimation of the LD and recombination fraction can provide more precise information about evolutionary inference.8In this article, we extended Wu and Zeng's8 open-pollinated progeny design to construct a linkage–LD map and particularly showed how this design can accommodate to missing information of dominant-segregating markers such as cytosine methylation markers. DNA methylation, as a covalent base modification of plant nuclear genomes, is thought to be accurately inherited through both mitotic and meiotic cell divisions.14 Also, similarly to spontaneous mutations in DNA, errors in the maintenance of methylation states would violate the equilibrium of natural populations, leading to changes in associations between epialleles at different methylated loci. Thus, by constructing a linkage–LD map using those so-called SMPs, we can infer evolutionary pasts of the natural populations from a different perspective.23,15Indeed, as a simple and cheap technique, dominant markers, such as SRAP markers,22 are still being used for many under-represented species including forest trees and wildlife species.24,25,26 Thus, the dominant model described can widen the usefulness of the open-pollinated design in practical population studies. Simulation studies have determined an appropriate sampling strategy to construct a linkage–LD map using dominant markers. Since the precise estimation of LD is of primary importance to linkage estimation, we recommend using many smaller families over small larger families. In addition, the efficiency of linkage–LD map construction can be enhanced by three-point analysis, which has proved to not only provide more information about the genome structure and organization, but also reduce a possibility of biased estimation of the linkage when LD has a small value.27,28 This is especially true for dominant markers.Although the original model for joint linkage and LD analysis was proposed more than a decade ago, its practical use has not occurred until recent years when the collection of molecular markers for under-represented species has been feasible. The current study presents one of the first applications of Wu and Zeng's8 open-pollinated design to study the population structure and history of an outcrossing species. Torreya grandis is a gymnosperm tree species with a large size, endemic to the eastern and southeastern China.20 Because of economic and ecological values, this species has been increasingly studied in terms of its evolutionary history and the genetic control of complex traits.21 The results from a joint linkage and LD analysis with dominant markers suggest that this species has experienced a long history of evolution, but some regions of its genome are subject to a certain recent evolutionary forces. This information will provide guidance for better germplasm management of this important woody plant. Advances in understanding the evolutionary history of Torreya can be made by sampling multiple populations in a range of its distributions. This study, along with the previous one based on half-sib seeds from a single tree of T. grandis reporting a linkage map covering a total of 7,139.9 cM in 10 groups,21 was among the first to construct genetic linkage maps for genus. It is important to align the two maps into a single one for a better coverage of the Torreya genome. Also, much more markers that can align those unlinked markers detected from the current and Zeng et al.'s studies are needed to completely cover 11 chromosomes of T. grandis. A complete coverage of markers allows more extensive studies of variation and examination of LD patterns, which will better reveal levels of complexity for this species.It has been recognized that genetic mapping based on LD analysis helps to fine map complex traits or disease, but this approach may have a high likelihood to detect spurious signals of association, because allelic association can also be due to evolutionary forces rather than physical linkage.2 A joint linkage and LD analysis can overcome this false-positive discovery.27 Thus, the LD map constructed from genetic and epigenetic markers will provide an important fuel to map key QTLs that affect quantitative traits of economic and environmental importance.7FundingThis work is supported by Special Fund for Forest Scientific Research in the Public Welfare (201404102); Open Fund for Key Discipline of Forestry of Zhejiang Province, Zhejiang A&F University (AF201308); Key Scientific Project of Selection and Breeding of New Agricultural Varieties of the Department of Science and Technologies of Zhejiang Province (2012C12904-12); and ‘One-thousand Person Plan’ Award.

Here, we present the complete genome sequence of a clinical strain, OMA14, of this bacterium along with the results of comparative genome analysis with strain 17 of the same species whose genome has also been sequenced, but not fully analysed yet. The genomes of both strains consist of two circular chromosomes: the larger chromosomes are similar in size and exhibit a high overall linearity of gene organizations, whereas the smaller chromosomes show a significant size variation and have undergone remarkable genome rearrangements. Unique features of the Pre. intermedia genomes are the presence of a remarkable number of essential genes on the second chromosomes and the abundance of conjugative and mobilizable transposons (CTns and MTns). The CTns/MTns are particularly abundant in the second chromosomes, involved in its extensive genome rearrangement, and have introduced a number of strain-specific genes into each strain. We also found a novel 188-bp repeat sequence that has been highly amplified in Pre. intermedia and are specifically distributed among the Pre. intermedia-related species. These findings expand our understanding of the genetic features of Pre. intermedia and the roles of CTns and MTns in the evolution of bacteria.1. IntroductionPrevotella intermedia is a Gram-negative, black-pigmented anaerobic bacterium that is classified into the genus Prevotella belonging to the phylum Bacteroidetes. This bacterium is frequently found in subgingival plaque from patients with periodontal diseases and is considered one of the periodontal pathogens (a member of the so-called ‘orange complex’).1Prevotella is phylogenetically close to other periodontal pathogens, namely Porphyromonas gingivalis and Tannerella forsythia, which are classified into the same phylum. Prevotella intermedia has also been associated with other oral infections, including endodontic infections,2,3 pregnancy gingivitis4 and acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis.5 An association of periodontitis with systemic diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases6 and preterm birth,7 has also been suggested, because the DNA of periodontal pathogens, including Pre. intermedia, has been detected in atherosclerotic plaques.8 In addition, the anti-Pre. intermedia IgM titre in umbilical cord blood is significantly higher in preterm infants than in full-term infants.9The virulence factors of Pre. intermedia, such as adhesins,10,11 proteolytic enzymes12 and lipopolysaccharides,13 have been investigated, but its pathogenicity has not yet been fully elucidated. Three Pre. intermedia genome sequences, namely those from strains 17, ATCC25611 and ZT, are available, and an intra- and inter-species genomic comparison was previously performed to obtain information regarding the conservation and variation in the gene contents.14 However, the complete genome sequence, which may provide more precise information on the genome structure, gene content, mobile genetic elements (MGEs) ,and repetitive elements and therefore a deeper understanding of the evolutionary process of bacteria, has only been determined for strain 17.In this study, we determined the complete sequences of two chromosomes in Pre. intermedia strain OMA14 and performed a fine comparison of the fully sequenced genomes of strains OMA14 and 17. Our analysis revealed an unusual amplification of conjugative and mobilizable transposons (CTns and MTns) and identified a novel repeat specific to a sublineage of the genus Prevotella, which was named ‘Pre. intermedia–nigrescens group-specific repeat’. These MGEs and repeats were found to be deeply involved in the genomic rearrangements and the generation of the variability in the gene contents detected between the two genomes, particularly those associated with the second chromosome. These data will expand our understanding of the genetic features of Pre. intermedia and provide novel insights into the evolutionary process through which this bacterium has adapted to and survive in the stressful and variable oral habitat.2. Materials and methods2.1. Genome sequencing and sequence analysisThe strains used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table S1. Prevotella intermedia OMA14 was isolated from a periodontal pocket of a Japanese patient with periodontitis, and strain 17 was also isolated from a human periodontal pocket.15 The Prevotella strains were cultured anaerobically (10% CO2, 10% H2, and 80% N2) on trypto-soya agar (Nissui, Tokyo, Japan) supplemented with 0.5% brain–heart infusion, 0.1% cysteine, 5 µg/ml hemin, and 0.5 µg/ml menadione. Cells were harvested after 1 day of culture on trypto-soya agar plates to prepare genomic DNA as described previously.16The Pre. intermedia OMA14 genome was sequenced using the Roche 454 GS FLX titanium platform (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA). In total, 363,377 single-end reads (150 Mb) were assembled into 85 contigs using the GS Assembler software version 2.6. For gap closing, a fosmid library was constructed using a Copy Control Fosmid Library Production kit (Epicentre, Madison, WI, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Gaps were closed through the sequencing of gap-spanning PCR products and fosmid clones using an ABI3130xl DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). To correct sequencing errors, the OMA14 genome was resequenced using the SOLiD (Applied Biosystems) and MiSeq (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) platforms. The candidate sequence errors were then confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The accuracy of sequence assembly was confirmed by optical mapping (Hitachi Solutions, Ltd, Tokyo, Japan).Protein-coding sequences (CDSs) were identified and annotated using the Microbial Genome Annotation Pipeline (http://www.migap.org/)17 followed by manual curation using additional information obtained by a search of the Pfam protein family database (pfam.xfam.org).18 CDS numbers headed by ‘PIOMA14_I_’ or ‘PIOMA14_II_’ were assigned to each CDS on the large and small chromosomes, respectively. The Ori-Finder program19 was used to find oriC using the Escherichia coli DnaA boxes and one unmatch site option. The GenomeMatcher program20 was used to define the conserved genomic regions, inversions, and translocations between the two genomes using the bla2seq comparison at sensitivity 500 and 95% nucleotide identity threshold. The CD-HIT Suite for Biological Sequence Clustering and Comparison (http://weizhong-lab.ucsd.edu/cdhit_suite/cgi-bin/index.cgi)21 was used to identify orthologous CDS clusters (with cut-offs of >60% minimal alignment coverage and >90% sequence identity). The annotated genome sequences of strain OMA14 have been deposited into the DDBJ/NCBI/EMBL database under the Accession Numbers AP014597 and AP014598.2.2. PCR assay for the excision of CTns and MTnsPrimer pairs were designed to amplify the attachment site-containing regions of the excised and circularized forms of each CTn and MTn (we refer to attachment sites on CTns and MTns as ‘attTn’ in this manuscript) and the attB regions of each cast-off genome (Supplementary Table S2). PCR amplification was performed with 100 ng of genomic DNA and an LA Taq PCR kit (Takara Bio, Otsu, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions using the following temperature program: 94°C for 1 min and 30 cycles of 94°C for 20 s, 55°C for 30 s, and 68°C for 2 min. The amplified fragments were subjected to direct sequencing on an ABI PRISM 3130xl sequencer to determine the nucleotide sequences of the attTn- or attB-flanking regions.2.3. Prevotella intermedia/nigrescens group-specific repeat-specific PCRThe Pre. intermedia/nigrescens group-specific repeat (PINSR)-specific primers PINSR-F and PINSR-R (Supplementary Table S2) were designed from the consensus sequence of PINSR. The expected product length was 149 bp. PCR amplification was performed with 50 ng of genomic DNA and an Ex Taq PCR kit (Takara Bio) using the following temperature program: 94°C for 1 min and 30 cycles of 94°C for 20 s, 51°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 30 s. The amplified products were detected by agarose gel electrophoresis followed by ethidium bromide straining. As a control, the 16S-rRNA gene was amplified using the primers 16S-rRNA-10F and 16S-rRNA-800 (Supplementary Table S2).3. Results and discussion3.1. General features of the Pre. intermedia genomesSimilar to the genome of Pre. intermedia strain 17 and the other fully sequenced genomes of Prevotella species (Prevotella denticola and Preotella melaninogenica), the genome of OMA14 consisted of two circular chromosomes with sizes of 2,280,262 and 867,855 bp (Fig. 1 and Table 1). The large and small chromosomes of strain 17 were designated Chromosome II and Chromosome I (Accession No. NC_017861, NC_017860), respectively. However, to avoid confusion, we refer to the large and small chromosomes of both strains in this manuscript as the first and second chromosomes, respectively. The first nucleotide positions of the first and second chromosomes were assigned to the first nucleotides of the dnaA gene (PIOMA14_I_0001) and the initiation factor 3 gene (PIOMA14_II_0001), respectively. The first chromosome of OMA14 is larger than that of strain 17 (2,280 kb versus. 2,013 kb), and the second chromosome showed a more striking variation in size, namely 868 kb in OMA14 and 579 kb in strain 17 (Table 1 and Fig. 1). This variation is mainly due to the insertion of more MGEs into the second chromosome of OMA14 than into that of strain 17, as described in the next section. In both strains, although clear GC skew transitions were not detected in the second chromosome, clear transitions were observed at two loci located at opposite sites on the first chromosome. These two loci are located at analogous regions between the two strains. One of the loci (positions 1,498,452–1,498,927 in OMA14) contains multiple DnaA boxes and was predicted to be oriC of the first chromosome by Ori-Finder. Thus, this locus and the opposite locus most likely represent the replication origin and terminus of the first chromosome, respectively, but the dnaA gene is not located near the former locus. We have confirmed in the phylum Bacteroidetes, the oriC region is commonly located far from the dnaA gene (DoriC: an updated database of bacterial and archaeal replication origins, http://tubic.tju.edu.cn/doric/).22 PIOMA14_II_0001 on the second chromosome encodes a protein belonging to the Rep_3 superfamily. This may suggest a possibility that the second chromosome has a plasmid-type replication system. But, we did not find any genes related to plasmid maintenance and iteron-like repeat sequences in the vicinity of this CDS. Therefore, the replication origin and terminus of the second chromosome are currently unknown.

In both strains, three and one rRNA operons are present in the first and second chromosomes, respectively. A full set of tRNA genes specifying all 20 amino acids was identified in both strains, i.e. 48 and 50 genes in strains OMA14 and 17, respectively. These tRNA genes are distributed to both chromosomes, but the tRNASer genes (two copies) are encoded only on the second chromosome in both strains. A similar, small chromosome-specific distribution of specific tRNA genes has been observed in other Prevotella species with two chromosomes: tRNACys and tRNALys in Pre. dentalis (Accession No. NC_019960, NC_019968) and tRNAAsp, tRNAGlu, and tRNASer in Pre. melaninogenica (Accession No. NC_014370, NC_014371). In addition to the rRNA operons and tRNA genes, the second chromosome of Pre. ntermedia contains many CDSs for house-keeping functions, including multiple ribosomal proteins (S1, L27, L28, and L33), multiple DNA polymerase III subunits (beta, gamma/tau, and epsilon), the RecA and RecN proteins, NADH dehydrogenase, NADH : ubiquinone oxidoreductase, prolyl-tRNA synthetase, heat-shock protein 90, and transcription termination factor Rho. Our preliminary analysis of other fully sequenced Prevotella species, Pre. dentalis and Pre. melaninogenica, indicate that many essential house-keeping genes are located in their second (smaller) chromosomes (ribosomal protein genes, chaperon protein genes, and many others). These data indicate that in Prevotella species, genes that are essentially required for cell growth are distributed in both the large and small chromosomes.Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) were also found in both chromosomes but only the locus on the first chromosome contains CRISPR-associated genes. In OMA14, the numbers of repeats in the repeat/space regions of the CRISPR-47-29 locus on the first chromosome and CRISPR 36-30 locus on the second chromosome were 33 and 6, respectively, whereas the analogous regions in strain 17 contain 38 and 17 repeats, respectively. Notably the cas1 gene of strain OMA14 has been disrupted by the insertion of a 34.2-kb phage-related segment, resulting in the apparent inactivation of the CRISPR system in OMA14. Smaller numbers of repeats in both loci of strain OMA14 (compared with strain 17) may be associated with the inactivation of the CRISPR system in this strain.3.2. Mobile genetic elementsOne of the notable genomic features of Pre. intermedia is the abundance of MGEs, particularly CTns and MTns (Table 1 and Supplementary Tables S3–S5). Thus, we conducted a detailed analysis of these MGEs in strains OMA14 and 17.In total, 14 and 27 IS elements (including partial copies) were identified in strains OMA14 and 17, respectively. These elements were classified into two types, namely ISPi1 and ISPi2, and both types are distributed to both chromosomes and are more abundant in strain 17 (Supplementary Tables S3 and S4). ISPi1 is closely related to ISPg3 found in Por. gingivalis, sharing the same inverted repeat sequences and generating the same length of target sequence duplication (7 bp) upon transposition. ISPi2 was assigned to the IS4 family by IS finder (https://www-is.biotoul.fr/)23 using the tblastx program and default settings.OMA14 contains 6 CTns and 15 MTns, whereas strain 17 possesses 2 CTns and 7 MTns (including highly degraded MTns; Fig. 2 and Supplementary Tables S3 and S5). These transposons account for 14.6 and 4.8% of the total genomes of OMA14 and strain 17, respectively. In addition, CTns and MTns occupy large portions (20.5%) of the second chromosome, particularly in OMA14, which is one of the main driving forces responsible for the marked difference in the size of the second chromosomes between the two strains. The CTns and MTns identified were classified into four (CTnPi1–CTnPi4) and 10 types (MTnPi1–MTnPi10), respectively. Among these, one type of CTn and two types of MTns are shared by the two strains, suggesting that these CTn and MTns may be widely distributed among Pre. intermedia strains. Several copies found in OMA14 (CTnPi2-a and -b; MTnPi1-a and -b; MTnPi2-a, -b, -c, and -d; and MTnPi3-a, -b, and -c) are nearly identical and thus appear to have been very recently duplicated (Fig. 2).

Some CTns or MTns (indicated by underlining) were found in strain 17, and others were found in strain OMA14. The CDSs are depicted by arrows (striped arrow, genes related to conjugation or mobilization; black arrow, integrase genes; grey arrow, other functionally annotated CDSs; and white arrow, genes for hypothetical proteins). The black triangles indicate the att sites of each CTn and MTn. Three att sequences (attL of MTnPi6-a, attL of MTnPi7, and attR of MTnPi9) were predicted based on the sequence homology to the consensus att core sequence of MTnPi1, MTnPi2, and MTnPi3 (see Supplementary Table S3). CTn and MTn transposons lacking either one of att sequences can be regarded as the remnants. The grey shading indicates homologous CDSs with >70% amino acid sequence identity.

A double line indicates a degraded integrase gene.Both CTnPi1 (found in OMA14) and CTnPi4 (strain 17) belong to the CTnPg1 family, which was originally identified in Por. gingivalis,16 and share a set of backbone genes for integration- and conjugal transfer-related functions with other family members, which have been identified in Prevotella, Porphyromonas, and Bacteroides species, all belonging to the order Bacteroidales (Supplementary Fig. S1). Both CTns, particularly CTnPi4, carry various accessory genes. Some of these genes are distributed in other CTnPg1 family members, e.g. genes for an ABC transporter component and a glycine C-acetyltransferase (CTnPi1) in the family members found in Por. gingivalis TDC60 and Pre. endodontalis ATCC 35406 and genes encoding an ABC transporter component, a TonB-dependent receptor, and several other proteins (CTnPi4) in the members found in Pre. nigrescens ATCC 33563 and Prevotella buccae D17. These results suggest that accessory genes are frequently exchanged between CTnPg1 family members.CTnPi2 and CTnPi3, both of which are found in OMA14, are closely related to one another, sharing a conserved backbone encoding integration- and conjugal transfer-related functions, which are partially homologous to those of CTnPi1 and CTnPi4 (Fig. 2A). CTnPi2 and CTnPi3 contain multiple integrase genes in internal regions. There are no putative att sequences just upstream of those internally residing integrase genes, but these integrases contain the motifs conserved in functional tyrosine recombinases. It is possible that the two CTns were generated by the insertion of at least one integrative element similar to MTns, i.e. one element in CTnPi2 and two or three elements in CTnPi3 with one shared by the two CTns. As accessory genes, CTnPi3 carries genes for a type I restriction-modification system and a tetratricopeptide repeat domain-containing protein as well as genes that are shared with CTnPi2 (encoding an ABC transporter component and a TonB-dependent receptor).MTns are a group of transposons that contain an oriT sequence and can thus be mobilized by a co-resident conjugative plasmid or transposon.24 Among the 10 types of MTns identified in the two strains, only degraded copies were found for several types (MTnPi5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10). However, genes for relaxase, a primase family protein, and integrase, which are required for MTn function, were found in most types (Fig. 2B). Because the integrases of all MTns are tyrosine recombinases, they all belong to type I MTn.24 MTnPi1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 9 appear to be related to one another and share similar relaxases, primase family proteins, and integrases. MTnPi4 and 8 and MTnPi5 and 10 appear to form different groups, respectively. A unique feature of this group is the presence of two integrase genes located in tandem, although the second gene (a downstream copy) is missing or degraded in some MTn copies. The two integrase genes in each MTn show no significant homology to one another (see the next subsection for a discussion of the functions of these two integrases). It was previously reported that Tn1806 of Streptococcus pneumonia AP200 also contains two int genes in tandem.25 The other four MTns may be classified into two groups: one including ‘MTnPi4 (found in OMA14) and MTnPi8 (strain 17)’, and the other including ‘MTnPi5 (OMA14) and MTnPi-10 (strain 17)’, because each pair shares similar genes for a primase family protein, relaxase, or integrase. Most MTns also carry one or more accessory genes, such as those encoding an ABC transporter component, a LuxR family transcriptional regulator, a subtilase-like protease, a ß-lactamase family protein, and an arginase.In general, CTns/MTns are integrated into a specific target site (attachment site; att) that contains a short sequence specific to each CTn or MTn. Upon integration, the att sequences are duplicated and form chromosome/CTn (or MTn) boundaries (attL and attR), which are good landmarks for the definition of each CTn/MTn. However, it is not always easy to identify att sequences. Therefore, we used PCR assays to detect the excised and circularized intermediates of each CTn and MTn and thereby examined whether the identified CTns and MTns are excised from the chromosome (Fig. 3A). In addition, through a sequencing analysis of the PCR products, we determined the att sequences of each CTn/MTn (attTn on the excised and circularized forms of transposon and attL and attR at chromosome/transposon boundaries). Through this series of analyses, we found that CTnPi1, 2, 3, and 4 and MTnPi1, 2, 3, and 4 are constitutively excised from the chromosome to form a circular intermediate (Fig. 3B), and we identified their att sequences (Supplementary Fig. S2 and Supplementary Data). Among these CTns and MTns, multiple copies of CTnPi2 and MTnPi1, 2, and 3 were found. Because the sequences of attTn-flanking regions in the different copies are identical, it was impossible to determine which copy is excised in each type of transposon. We therefore performed an additional PCR assay to detect the chromosomal attachment sites (attB) of each copy from which CTn/MTn has been excised (Fig. 3A and C). This analysis confirmed that all of the copies, with the exception of one copy of MTnPi1 and one copy of MTnPi3, were excised from the chromosome. These results suggest that these CTns and MTns are likely active. We speculate that they can potentially transfer (or be transferred) to other bacteria, but conjugation assays for each transposon need to confirm their activities. We were unable to detect the excision of the remaining MTns (data not shown), which was expected for six of the MTns (MTnPi5–MTnPi10) due to their high degree of degradation.

The other regions were amplified from OMA14. attTn indicates the att sequence on the excised and circularized form of transposon.Notably, MTnPi1-c was not excised (Fig. 3B), which was rather unexpected, because this element contains all of the genes found in other MTnPi1 copies except for the second (downstream) integrase (Fig. 2). The integrase of MTnPi1-c has been significantly diverged in sequence from the upstream integrase of MTnPi1-a and MTnPi1-b (92.7% amino acid sequence identity). This makes a sharp contrast to the fact that the upstream integrases of MTnPi1-a and MTnPi1-b are identical in amino acid sequence. Although the motif for tyrosine recombinase is conserved in the integrase of MTnPi1-c, amino acid substitutions have accumulated in the C-terminal region. Inactivation of the integrase by these amino acid substitutions may be a possible reason for the failure of excision of MTnPi1-c. However, the apparent and specific deletion of the downstream integrase gene from MTnPi1-c suggests another possibility that both integrases may be required for their function, at least for the excision of MTnPi1. If this is true, two integrase genes in MTnPi2 and MTnPi3 would also be required for the excision of these MTns, because their integrases show high sequence similarities to those of MTnPi1 (Fig. 2).In addition to allowing the exact definition of chromosome/CTn (or MTn) boundaries, the analysis of the identified att sequences/sites yielded several important findings. CTnPi1 and CTnPi4 use the same 13-bp sequence (TTTTCNNNNAAAA) that used by other CTnPg1 family members as its attachment site, supporting our conclusion regarding the relationship of these two CTns to the CTnPg1 family obtained from the previous structural comparison (Fig. 2). Second, CTnPi2-b, CTnPi3, and MTnPi4 are inserted into tRNA genes, similar to several other CTns24 and MTns.26,27 Another copy of CTnPi2-a is inserted into an integrase gene (II_0226) that may form part of a degraded MTn similar to MTnPi1 and MTnPi2. Notably, MTnPi1, 2, and 3 use similar 11-bp sequences as the att site, supporting the close relatedness of these MTns that was inferred from the previous structural comparison (Fig. 2).3.4. Prevotella intermedia/nigrescens group-specific repeatWe found a 188-bp incomplete repeat sequence located in intergenic regions in the genomes of both strains OMA14 and 17 (Fig. 4A). This repeat sequence was expanded to 177 copies in OMA14 and 184 copies in strain 17 (Supplementary Table S6). A database search for homologous sequences confirmed that this 188-bp repeat is also present in the downstream region of the tnaA gene28 and DNA probe Pig2729 of Pre. intermedia ATCC 25611 and the draft genomes of Pre. nigrescens ATCC 33563 and F103. We further examined 18 Prevotella species (Supplementary Table S1) for the presence of this repeat by PCR using primers specific to the repeat, which were designed based on the consensus sequence deduced from all copies found in strains OMA14 and 17 (Fig. 4A). This analysis revealed that, in addition to Pre. intermedia and Pre. nigrescens, Prevotella falsenii and Prevotella disiens also contain the repeat (Fig. 4B). These four species are closely related and form a clade in the genus Prevotella (Fig. 4C).30,31 Although some species in this clade lack the repeat, none of the Prevotella species belonging to other clades apparently possess the 188-bp repeat. We therefore named this repeat PINSR (Prevotella intermedia/nigrescens group-specific repeat). The selective distribution of PINSR in the Pre. intermedia/nigrescens group suggests that PINSR was acquired by a common ancestor of this group and then amplified in some species (particularly Pre. intermedia) or deleted (or diverged in sequence) from other species following speciation. PINSR-specific PCR would thus be useful for identifying Pre. intermedia and the three other PINSR-possessing Prevotella species. Prevotella intermedia–nigrescens group-specific repeat (PINSR).

Species, the complete genome sequences of which are available in public databases, are indicated by open circles. Only the species indicated by triangles were examined for the presence of PINSR by PCR.In addition, small CDSs that overlap PINSR were annotated in the genome sequence of strain 17 (Accession No. NC_017860, NC_017861). However, clear ribosome-binding sequences are not present in most cases, and no significant homology to known proteins was detected. The sizes of these small CDSs are highly variable. Therefore, it is most likely that PINSR does not contain protein-coding sequences. PINSR also does not contain terminal-inverted repeat sequences. Therefore, PINSR is distinct from the miniature-inverted repeat transposable element (MITE) that is transposable by the action of the transposase provided in trans from a cognate IS element. Intriguingly, approximately three-quarters of the PINSR-containing regions identified in strains OMA14 and 17 are conserved between the two strains, suggesting that PINSR may have been amplified prior to the separation of the two strains. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that most strain-specific regions, such as CTns and MTns, in both strains do not contain PINSR. Although PINSR apparently played some roles in the genome rearrangement that occurred between the two strains, as described in the next section, further studies are necessary to elucidate the biological functions and source of PINSR (if present).3.5. Genome rearrangementA whole-genome sequence alignment analysis revealed that extensive genomic rearrangements have occurred between strains OMA14 and 17. We identified 26 inversions/translocations and >100 simple insertions/deletions (Supplementary Fig. S3). Approximately two-thirds of the identified inversions/translocations are associated with MGEs, and at least one IS, CTn, or MTn element is present at each inversion/translocation site. The remaining inversions/translocations occurred between PINSRs, rrn operons, or tRNA genes. This analysis also identified strain-specific segments (>10 kb) in both genomes, namely Segments A-W in OMA14 and Segments A-I in strain 17 (the sixth circle in Fig. 1, Supplementary Tables S7 and S8). Approximately half of these segments simply consist of a single CTn or MTn (10 of the 23 segments in stain OMA14 and 4 of the 9 segments in strain 17). However, several segments, particularly larger ones, exhibit composite natures containing multiple MGTs. Furthermore, several segments contain phage-related genes and thus likely represent prophages or degraded prophages. These features further support the hypothesis that MGEs played key roles in generating the genomic diversity of Pre. intermedia.3.6. Gene repertoire comparison between the two Pre. intermedia strainsTo compare the gene repertoires of strains OMA14 and 17, we performed a clustering analysis of all CDSs identified in the two strains using the CD-HIT program, which generated 2,884 CDS clusters. Among these, 1,744 were found to be conserved in both strains, whereas 686 and 454 are specific to strains OMA14 and 17, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S4). This number of conserved genes is somewhat larger than that recently revealed by the comparison of the genome of strain 17 and draft sequences of two Pre. intermedia strains (~1,600).14 This difference may be due to the difference in the number of strains analysed and to the difference in the quality of the sequences or annotations (complete versus. draft sequences). Therefore, the core genome of Pre. intermedia most likely consists of 1,600–1,700 genes and encodes most virulence genes that have been identified in Pre. intermedia, such as proteolytic enzyme interpain A (II_0221)12 and the adhesins AdpC (I_1236)10 and AdpF (I_1057).11 The gene set encoding the type IX secretion system (T9SS), which was originally identified in Por. gingivalis,32,33 was also found in the core genome.The strain-specific CDSs listed in Supplementary Tables S9 and S10 include many genes in CTns and MTns, reflecting the difference in the transposon repertoires between the two strains. In particular, as many as 54.4% of the CDSs on the second chromosome of strain OMA14, where CTns and MTns are most densely integrated, are strain-specific CDSs. Notably, each strain contains a large number of strain-specific genes related to DNA restriction modification. Another noteworthy finding is the presence of strain-specific glycosyltransferase gene clusters in each strain (Segment D in OMA14 and Segment G in strain 17), which suggests that the two strains may produce different extracellular polysaccharides.3.7. ConclusionsIn this study, we determined the complete genome sequence of Pre. intermedia OMA14 and compared it with the completely sequenced Pre. intermedia strain 17. Our analysis revealed that the genomes of Pre. intermedia are unusually enriched in CTns and MTns, which account for large parts of the strain-specific sequences observed in each Pre. intermedia genome. Together with IS elements, these CTns and MTns are also involved in the extensive genomic rearrangements observed between the two strains. In addition, we found a novel repeat element (named PINSR) that has been extensively amplified in Pre. intermedia and several Prevotella species belonging to the Pre. intermedia–nigrescens group. These results expand our understanding of the genetic features and genomic diversity of Pre. intermedia and provide novel insights into the roles of MGEs, particularly CTns and MTns, in the evolution of bacteria.FundingThis work was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Areas ‘Genome Science’ from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (No. 221S0002), and by grants from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (No. 20249073 and No. 24659817) to K.N.

In this report, detailed gene structures of barley, whole genome shotgun (WGS) and additional transcript data of the cultivar Haruna Nijo were quality controlled and compared with the published Morex genome information. Haruna Nijo scaffolds have longer total sequence length with much higher N50 and fewer sequences than those in Morex WGS contigs. The longer Haruna Nijo scaffolds provided efficient FLcDNA mapping, resulting in high coverage and detection of the transcription start sites. In combination with FLcDNAs and RNA-Seq data from four different tissue samples of Haruna Nijo, we identified 51,249 gene models on 30,606 loci. Overall sequence similarity between Haruna Nijo and Morex genome was 95.99%, while that of exon regions was higher (99.71%). These sequence and annotation data of Haruna Nijo are combined with Morex genome data and released from a genome browser. The genome sequence of Haruna Nijo may provide detailed gene structures in addition to the current Morex barley genome information.1. IntroductionBarley (Hordeum vulgare L.) is used for many purposes including human food, malting and animal feed. Coupled with its wide adaptability in environments ranging from the highlands of Africa at the equator to the Arctic Regions in Scandinavia, barley is the fourth most important cereal crop (http://faostat.fao.org, 7 November 2015, date accessed). In addition, barley is an ancient crop that was domesticated ca. 10,000 yrs ago in the Fertile Crescent.1 Decades of collection and curation of barley germplasm have resulted in substantial germplasm collections including: IPK (Germany), USDA-ARS (USA) and Okayama University (Japan).2 To fully exploit these in situ and ex situ collections for barley breeding and gene discovery, barley genome sequences of multiple genotypes are needed.To generate the first genome sequence of barley, the International Barley Sequencing Consortium (IBSC) conducted BAC fingerprinting, BAC end sequencing, whole genome shotgun (WGS) sequencing, RNA-Seq analysis and genetic mapping and integrated these data to develop a gene-based genome sequence of the North American six-row spring malting barley cultivar Morex.3 Morex traces to barley germplasm of Manchurian origin with six-row inflorescence, which is not common for malting barleys other than the USA. Currently, Morex is the reference genome for barley genetics studies, and additional efforts are in progress to improve the Morex genome sequence.4,5 Three other barley genomes including Bowman, Barke and a Tibetan hulless genotype have been WGS sequenced3,6 and provide additional sequence information for comparison to Morex.Haruna Nijo is a Japanese malting barley cultivar exhibiting excellent malting quality for brewing beer. Historically, Japanese malting barleys have been developed by crossing European malting barley cultivars and Japanese landraces and selecting for malting quality and adaptation to Japanese environments. Haruna Nijo was also developed by this approach in 1979 and has been extensively used as a foundation genotype of current Japanese breeding. Haruna Nijo has a high thermostability of ß-amylase,7 and it also shows different Bmy1 allele for ß-amylase activity from Morex.8 It is also shown that Haruna Nijo has a high malt extract (related to beer production) by QTL analysis.9 To enhance the utility of Haruna Nijo for breeding, a suite of genomics resources were developed including: an EST collection, transcript map construction,10,11 a BAC library,12 454-based WGS sequencing3 and full-length (FL) cDNA sequencing and analysis13,14 (available at http://barleyflc.dna.affrc.go.jp/bexdb/, 7 November 2015, date accessed, with functions of expression profiling and genome browsing).In the case of barley genome resources, the Morex reference genome and the Haruna Nijo FLcDNA sequences provide unique resources in different genotypes. Thus, to enhance the utility of both resources they need to be compared and integrated. Sequence comparisons of the two different malting barley haplotypes will be much more useful than single haplotype information, as they provide the basis of structural and functional allelic diversity. Previous comparisons of WGS data and FLcDNA sequences from Haruna Nijo and the genome sequence from Morex demonstrated a large amount of sequence polymorphisms between the two genotypes.3 For example, the genetic distance (dissimilarity) between Morex and Haruna Nijo by 1,536 SNPs of Illumina GoldenGate Assay is 0.50, which is larger than the difference (0.48) between Morex and Akashinriki (Japanese food barley).15 Thus, the Haruna Nijo FLcDNA and WGS sequences may provide useful gene annotations for the reference genotype Morex and a resource for future breeding and gene discovery activities.Our overall goal is to provide genome information of Haruna Nijo to annotate gene structures on the genome sequence of Morex. The four specific objectives of this study were to (i) generate high-quality genomic sequence of Haruna Nijo, (ii) map the precise position of genes identified in the Haruna Nijo genome, (iii) compare gene information between Haruna Nijo and Morex, and (iv) develop gene models based on the Haruna Nijo sequence data.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materials and nucleic acid isolationFor DNA and RNA isolation from seedling tissues, seeds of Haruna Nijo were germinated on moist filter paper in Petri dishes at 20°C in the dark. For DNA isolation, shoots of ca. 5 cm were harvested and high-quality genomic DNA was isolated by DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN K.K., Japan). For RNA isolation, seedling shoot and seedling root tissues were sampled from plants exhibiting 5 cm shoots. For the RNA samples from immature spike and immature seed samples, barley seeds were planted in pot with soil mixture (N: 120 mg l-1; P: 100 mg l-1; K: 160 mg l-1, pH 5.5) and grown in the greenhouse at 20/15°C day/night temperature under natural light conditions. Immature spike samples were harvested from the leaf sheath 5 days before heading. Immature seeds were sampled 35 days after flowering (soft dough stage). Total RNA from immature seeds was isolated by TRIzol® Reagent (Life Technologies, Japan) following the Plant RNA Isolation protocol. All RNA samples were purified by RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN K.K., Japan), and DNA was removed by RNase-Free DNase Set (QIAGEN K.K., Japan).2.2. Library developmentThe high-quality genomic DNA was fragmented in 8 k and 20 k by the Hydroshear (Digilab Inc., Holliston, MA, USA). The library was developed by a library preparation kit (Roche diagnostics, Japan) for long paired-end libraries (8 k and 20 k). Circularization was performed according to the Roche Paired End Library Protocol, using Roche circularization adapters (Paired End Library Preparation Method Manual 20 kb and 8 kb Span; Roche Diagnostics, October 2009, Steps 3.1–3.7.3). Subsequently, the circularized fragments were fragmented again by nebulization to develop a sequencing library.DNA (2 µg) was fragmented by nebulization. Libraries were prepared according to the manufacturer's instruction ‘Preparing Samples for Paired-End Sequencing, Part # 1005063 Rev. A June 2008’ of TruSeq DNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina Japan). DNA fragments were size selected (500 bp) following the Low-Throughput Protocol of TruSeq DNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina Japan). The quality of the library (fragment length distribution) was checked by Agilent Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA Assay (Agilent Technologies, Japan) and KAPA Library Quantification Kit (KK4835, Kapa Biosystems, MA, USA).Libraries for RNA-Seq analysis were developed from each RNA sample using TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit V2 (Illumina Japan). The protocol of TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation V2 Guide (Illumina Japan) was used with modification of fragment isolation from agarose gel electrophoresis and elution in EB (elution buffer) following the method in the TruSeq Sample Preparation Guide (Illumina Japan). The library was quantified with Agilent High Sensitivity DNA Kit (Agilent Technologies Japan) and Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies Japan).2.3. SequencingEach library was emulsion PCR amplified. The PCR-amplified fragments on beads were washed, and the bead number was counted using a Coulter Counter Z1 single threshold instrument (Beckman Coulter Japan). The appropriate number of beads was applied on a pico titre plate according to the manufacturer's protocol. The FLX Titanium platform was used for sequencing (average read length 500 bp). The pyrosequencing reaction data were base-called to generate sff format files using the software installed on the analysis server of the 454 sequencer (Roche diagnostics, Japan).The shotgun library was sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 to produce 2 × 101 paired-end reads. Raw data processing, base calling and quality control were performed with manufacture's standard pipeline. The quality of the output sequences was inspected using the FastQC program (http://www.bioinformatics.bbsrc.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/, 7 November 2015, date accessed).The RNA-Seq library was sequenced with MiSeq Reagent Kit V3 (2 × 300 bp cycles) on MiSeq NGS system according to the MiSeq System User Guide (Illumina Japan) and fastq files were generated from both ends of the fragments.2.4. Assembly, sequence trimming and repeat maskingIllimina PE reads, 454 single-end reads and 454 long paired-end reads were hybrid assembled by the de novo assemble algorithm of CLC Assembly Cell ver. 3.2.2 installed on a linux server with a main memory of 256 Gb.Human, fungi (33 species) and microbial (2,777 species) nucleotide sequence data were obtained from NCBI. Each assembled contig sequence was queried on sequences of these species, and the contigs showing >80% identity and >50% of cumulative coverage by blastn16 were assumed as alien sequences against the barley genome. For repeat masking, fasta files of Triticeae repeat sequence database (TREP Release 10: n = 1,717) were downloaded from GrainGenes (http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/ITMI/Repeats/, 7 November 2015, date accessed). In addition, new repetitive elements were generated from the Haruna Nijo genome assembly by RepeatModeler (http://www.repeatmasker.org/RepeatModeler.html, 7 November 2015, date accessed). These two libraries were used for repeat masking the Haruna Nijo assembly by censor17 with -mode norm mode. For the analysis of repeat distribution, only results of repeat masking by the TREP library were used. For comparison, genomes of Triticum aestivum,18Triticum urartu19 and Aegilops tauschii20 were repeat masked in a similar manner as the Haruna Nijo genome.2.5. FLcDNA/RNA-Seq mappingOf the two independent projects,13,14 5,006 FLcDNAs were retrieved from NCBI13 and 23,614 FLcDNAs14 were downloaded from the bex-db (http://barleyflc.dna.affrc.go.jp/bexdb/).21 Morex genome assembly (contigs) was retrieved from the PGSB PlantsDB database (http://pgsb.helmholtz-muenchen.de/plant/plantsdb.jsp, 7 November 2015, date accessed).3 FLcDNAs were mapped both on the Haruna Nijo scaffolds and on the Morex contigs using blast+ with the parameters ‘-task blastn -evalue 10e-10 -lcase_masking’, and with est2genome22 in the EMBOSS package with the parameters ‘-align –mode both -gappenalty 8 -mismatch 6 -minscore 10’. FLcDNAs mapped to scaffolds with >95% identity and >50% coverage were accepted. Mapped regions with the highest identity were adopted for each FLcDNA. Overlapped FLcDNA sequences were clustered onto a locus on Haruna Nijo genome.After trimming of low-quality nucleotide and adapter sequences by Trimmomatic,23 reads derived from rRNA sequences were discarded by Bowtie2.24 A set of programs, Bowtie2,24 TopHat225 and Cufflinks,26 were used to map reads on the Haruna Nijo scaffolds. Gene structures derived from FLcDNA mapping were utilized to develop consensus gene models of the four library reads. To predict ORFs on the gene structures, blastx searches were conducted to RefSeq and UniProtKB data sets. From the best hit of blastx results, the most reliable ORFs were determined with at least 70 amino acids in length. To assign gene function, InterProScan 527 was conducted on the predicted ORFs. Based on the InterPro domain, GO terms were assigned to each ORF, and GOslim28 (http://agbase.msstate.edu/cgi-bin/tools/goslimviewer_select.pl, 7 November 2015, date accessed) was conducted.From the silva database29 (http://www.arb-silva.de/, 7 November 2015, date accessed), 17 barley rRNA sequences were downloaded. They were mapped on the Haruna Nijo scaffolds using blast+ with the parameters ‘-task blastn -evalue 0.01 -lcase_masking -num_descriptions 100’ and blast hits with >98% identity and >50% coverage were assumed as rRNAs. tRNA genes were predicted using the tRNAscan-SE ver. 1.3.1 program.30 Any tRNAs that were annotated as ‘possible pseudogenes’ were not counted.The Haruna Nijo scaffolds were mapped on the Morex contigs using megablast with the parameters ‘-evalue 10e-10 -num_descriptions 5’. Since several query sequences were hit on the same target sequence, the best hit regions were identified. If more than one Morex contig was positioned on a Haruna Nijo scaffold, these contigs were aligned on the scaffold allowing 10% overlap of the contig sequences.High confidence (HC) and low confidence (LC) genes of Morex were downloaded from the PGSB barley genome database and mapped to the Haruna Nijo scaffolds by GMAP31 with >95% identity and >90% coverage.3. Results and discussion3.1. Assembly of the Haruna Nijo genome sequenceWe analysed different platforms of WGS sequences of Haruna Nijo by hybrid assembly. A total of 305 Gbp of sequence data were generated by Illumina HiSeq paired-end reads and 454 Titanium long paired-end reads (8 K and 20 K) (Table 1). The hybrid assembly of Illumina and 454 reads, which also include the published 454 Titanium single-end reads (25Gbp),3 generated a total of 2,055,601,874 bp in 1,753,384 scaffolds (contigs and gaps). After sequence trimming, the Haruna Nijo genome size was 2,005,970,762 bp in 1,712,236 scaffolds (Table 2). The N50 was ~3.5 kb, which is 2.5 times larger than the published Morex WGS contigs.3 The average sequence length in the Haruna Nijo scaffolds was longer than the Morex WGS contigs (Supplementary Fig. S1). Compared with Morex WGS contigs, which were assembled with only Illumina paired-end reads, the longer Haruna Nijo WGS assembly is likely due to assembling the Illumina paired-end reads and 454 longer single-end reads. Sources of WGS sequencing data for Haruna NijoSources of WGS sequencing data for Haruna NijoResults of whole-genome assembly of Haruna Nijo and Morex3Results of whole-genome assembly of Haruna Nijo and Morex33.2. Repeat content of the Haruna Nijo genomePrevious studies have shown that the barley genome contains ~80% repeated elements.3 In the published WGS assemblies,3 the relative frequency was reduced to ~60%, due to the degradation of redundant repeated sequences. On the assembly of Haruna Nijo WGS data, repeat analysis by the Triticeae repeat library (TREP) detected 55.9% as repeated sequences. After deleting unknown genomic regions (‘N’ sites), 60.8% of the assembled sequences were classified as repeated sequences. The composition and distribution of repeat sequence categories were similar between Haruna Nijo and Morex (Fig. 1). Noteworthy, Gypsy, Copia retrotransposons and the CACTA DNA transposon showed higher frequencies than those normally observed in other Triticeae species. When we compared repeat categories from Haruna Nijo, T. aestivum (common wheat) cv. Chinese Spring, T. urartu and A. tauschii, the frequency of Copia in Haruna Nijo was higher than those in the wheat genomes, while Haruna Nijo contained more CACTA and less Gypsy than those in wheat genomes (Supplementary Fig. S2). Distribution of TREP repeat categories on the Haruna Nijo and Morex barley genome assemblies. Frequency of each repeat content was calculated by the result of repeat masking using the TREP library. Total bases of each repeat region on the genomes were divided by those of all repeat regions.Distribution of TREP repeat categories on the Haruna Nijo and Morex barley genome assemblies. Frequency of each repeat content was calculated by the result of repeat masking using the TREP library. Total bases of each repeat region on the genomes were divided by those of all repeat regions.To identify unique repeat sequences in barley, de novo repeat sequences in the Haruna Nijo scaffolds were detected by RepeatModeler, which identified a total of 979 consensus sequences. The de novo repeat library and the TREP library were used for repeat masking. As a result, 74.8% of the assembled sequences were masked (‘N’s were not masked and thus deleted from the calculation). The repeat masking by the de novo library identified 68.1% repeat sequences, which were much more than the masked repeats (60.8%) detected by the TREP library.3.3. FLcDNA mappingFLcDNA mapping on genome sequence provides reliable exon vs. intron structures on gene models. A non-redundant set of 28,620 FLcDNA sequences13,14 was mapped to the Haruna Nijo scaffolds. Blastn mapping revealed that 27,784 FLcDNAs (97%) showed sequence similarities with the Haruna Nijo scaffolds. According to the results of the FLcDNA mapping to scaffolds, we analysed mapping coverage of 5'-end of each FLcDNA on Haruna Nijo scaffolds. The ratio of completely mapped FLcDNAs, which were mapped from the first nucleotide sequence, was <10%. This shows that most of the FLcDNAs do not have the complete sequences on the 5'-end side exon. To analyse additional mapped FLcDNAs, we relaxed the mapping position to the first 10 nucleotide sequences. Then, the ratio of mapped FLcDNA was raised to 80% (Supplementary Fig. S3). GC contents and CG-skew were analysed on the FLcDNAs having mapped 5'-ends within 10 bp. The typical high GC contents and CG-skewed peaks at the transcription start sites were identified as previously observed in rice and Arabidopsis32 (Supplementary Fig. S4).The longer Haruna Nijo scaffolds may contribute to the efficiency in FLcDNA mapping. The number of mapped FLcDNAs under the threshold of 50% mapping coverage was 26,240 in the Haruna Nijo scaffolds and 24,261 in the Morex contigs (Table 3). These numbers included FLcDNAs that mapped to either the Haruna Nijo scaffolds (1,985) or the Morex contigs (379). However, if the threshold of mapping coverage was raised to 95%, the number of mapped FLcDNAs decreased to 14,044 on the Morex contigs, while 19,485 were still mapped on the Haruna Nijo scaffolds. FLcDNA mapping on genome assembliesFLcDNA mapping on genome assembliesWe also analysed the coverage of FLcDNA mapped reads on the Haruna Nijo scaffolds and the Morex contigs by comparing the mapped exon numbers of FLcDNAs between Haruna Nijo and Morex. Of the 24,255 FLcDNA gene models, 19,207 (79.2%) were mapped with the same number of exons both on the Haruna Nijo scaffolds and on the Morex contigs. Of these, 3,066 gene models had more exons in Haruna Nijo than that in Morex, while 1,982 gene models had more exons in Morex than Haruna Nijo. The start position analysis also showed that the Haruna Nijo scaffolds (6,842) had more mapped 5'-end sequences than the Morex contigs (1,721).These results indicated that the available genome sequences of Morex and Haruna Nijo are different, and there may be more cases where FLcDNAs mapped with higher coverage on Haruna Nijo genomes. For example, the entire FLcDNA (AK371953) for the cleistogamy1 (cly1 for closed flowering) gene,33 which was mapped on a Haruna Nijo scaffold, while the 5' region was not mapped on a Morex contig (Fig. 2). Moreover, flanking regions for the FLcDNA (3.6 Kb for upstream and 2.9 Kb for downstream regions) were present on the Haruna Nijo scaffold to provide the opportunity to analyse the cis-element(s) of the gene. Gene structure of closed flowering locus cly1 (AK371953). In the Haruna Nijo genome, the complete gene structures of cly1 including upstream and downstream regions were identified. In the Morex genome,3 the first exon and upstream regions were truncated because of insufficient length of the contig.Gene structure of closed flowering locus cly1 (AK371953). In the Haruna Nijo genome, the complete gene structures of cly1 including upstream and downstream regions were identified. In the Morex genome,3 the first exon and upstream regions were truncated because of insufficient length of the contig.3.4. Gene annotationThe IBSC presented 26,159 HC (high confidence) and 53,220 LC (low confidence) gene models by using RNA-Seq-based transcript and FLcDNAs.3 This number of genes was larger than that of the Haruna Nijo FLcDNAs. Actually, of the 24,243 HC Morex gene models (in GFF file), only 7,645 had corresponding Haruna Nijo FLcDNAs, indicating that the FLcDNAs sequence data were not deep enough to construct a comprehensive set of barley gene models. To obtain more comprehensive transcript sequences of Haruna Nijo, RNA-Seq data from four libraries of seedling shoot, seedling root, immature spike and immature seed were collected (Table 4). As reference gene structures, 26,240 gene models on 18,226 loci determined by FLcDNA mapping with 50% coverage (Table 3) were used for mapping RNA-Seq reads. Sequences of each RNA-Seq library mapped 73.2–81.0% to each other, indicating that the concordant pair alignment rates were not much different among the libraries (Table 4). Sequences from all four libraries were combined by cuffmerge26 and 30,606 loci (51,249 gene models) were estimated. Of these, 12,390 loci and 5,635 alternative variants were added on the Haruna Nijo gene models. Sequencing and mapping results of Haruna Nijo RNA-Seq dataSequencing and mapping results of Haruna Nijo RNA-Seq dataWe compared the Haruna Nijo gene models with the Morex HC and LC gene models.3 We mapped 78.0% of Morex HC gene models and 72.2% of Morex LC gene models on Haruna Nijo gene models with 95% coverage and 90% identity. Of these, 1,446 Morex gene models were mapped on multiple Haruna Nijo gene models. Clustering analysis showed that 21,381 Haruna Nijo gene models overlapped with Morex gene models on the Haruna Nijo scaffolds, while 9,225 gene models did not overlap each other.Blastx search on RefSeq/UniProt showed that 48,619 gene models of Haruna Nijo were similar to known protein sequences. In addition, 48,105 predicted ORFs on 28,422 gene models of 24,467 scaffolds were >70 aa in length. Of these, 44,133 ORFs had Met at the start positions. Noteworthy, 23,882 ORFs derived from 25,897 mapped FLcDNA contained Met at the start position.InterProScan analysis showed that 26,956 ORFs on 19,438 loci contained 67,293 InterPro domains. While 2,760 InterPro domains were in the ‘REPEAT’ category, which may not have biological function, other 44,769 domains were ‘DOMAIN’ category (Supplementary Table S1). Moreover, GOslim analysis revealed that the gene content of Haruna Nijo (barley) and Nipponbare (rice) was quite similar (Supplementary Fig. S5).We also predicted rRNA genes on Haruna Nijo scaffolds. Based on the silva database, nine scaffolds were identified as rRNA regions. In the case of rice, rDNA genes compose nucleolar-organizing region (NOR) in which rDNA are aligned in tandem. In wheat, the chromosome-based WGS analysis showed that the chromosome 6B contains 60% of the total rRNA gene (5,500 genes).34 However, these regions could not be assembled by NGS data35 due to the degeneration in the process of assembly. This was also true for the Haruna Nijo scaffolds which showed only nine scaffolds carrying rRNA sequences. The difficulty of assembling NOR was also reported in rice,36 but the NOR assembly in WGS might be more difficult in general.tRNAs were also annotated by tRNAscan-SE. The spectrum of tRNA distribution across the genome was uneven but similar to the rice genome37 (Supplementary Fig. S6). It is reported that tRNALys sequences are extraordinarily abundant in wheat chromosome 6B due to the abundance of the retrotransposon Gypsy.35 The Haruna Nijo scaffolds also have higher rate of Gypsy; however, the number of tRNAs was smaller than that in wheat.3.5. WGS assembly comparison between Haruna Nijo and MorexThere are several published3 and ongoing efforts of sequencing BACs derived from Morex. BAC-based assemblies may provide longer sequences than WGS assemblies to estimate gene models on the genome. The final goal for developing Haruna Nijo gene models is to map them on the BAC-based Morex genome sequences. To understand the quality of current Haruna Nijo genome resources, sequences of the Haruna Nijo scaffolds and the Morex contigs were aligned by megablast. An average sequence identity between Haruna Nijo and Morex was estimated as 95.99% (Supplementary Table S2). We found that mapped regions of query were different when query and database sequences were exchanged between Haruna Nijo and Morex. This was caused by the difference of sequence length in two assemblies. In this analysis, we used the best hit of megablast for the calculation, and the other hits with lower coverage on Haruna Nijo scaffolds were discarded. Therefore, the total length of aligned regions was decreased. Genome comparison of Haruna Nijo and Morex identified the occasions that the genomic regions of Haruna Nijo and Morex do not match. An example of mismatch between two assemblies on chromosome 5H was that a region of the Haruna Nijo gene model of TCONS_00033948 or TCONS_00033949 (Fig. 3A), which is supported by a FLcDNA, AK370496 that encodes bZIP transcription factor family protein on a contig_55003 (scaffold), was divided into two loci of MLOC_14578.1 on morex_contig_156845 (Fig. 3B) and MLOC_75543 on morex_contig_68185 (Fig. 3C). Thus, we may find a better gene model if we compare multiple gene models derived from different assemblies.

Separated genomic regions of Morex which correspond to the single FLcDNA region in Haruna Nijo. This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.We also analysed conserved genic regions between Haruna Nijo and Morex by using mapped regions of FLcDNAs. The difference between Haruna Nijo scaffolds and FLcDNA sequences was 0.05% (1 bp of 2000bp in exon), which is still five times higher than the value of 0.01% in rice genome.37 However, the sequence difference of exon regions between Haruna Nijo and Morex (identified by Haruna Nijo FLcDNAs) was 0.29%, indicating that the sequence quality of scaffolds in Haruna Nijo was high compared with the haplotype difference between Haruna Nijo and Morex.3.6. ConclusionBased on this study, there are several advantages of using the Haruna Nijo sequence resources. The Haruna Nijo scaffolds provide a high-quality genome sequence for the barley research community. In particular, the FLcDNA sequences, which are available only for Haruna Nijo, provide a key resource. In addition, the gene structures of Haruna Nijo provide supplementary data sets to the Morex genome sequence. Finally, the haplotype of Haruna Nijo is popular among the malting barley cultivars in the world and can be used as an alternative source of alleles for important traits in barley.4.

Many clubroot resistance genes and markers are available in Brassica rapa but less is known in Brassica oleracea. Here, we applied the genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) technique to construct a high-resolution genetic map and identify clubroot resistance (CR) genes. A total of 43,821 SNPs were identified using GBS data for two parental lines, one resistant and one susceptible lines to clubroot, and 18,187 of them showed >5× coverage in the GBS data. Among those, 4,103 were credibly genotyped for all 78 F2 individual plants. These markers were clustered into nine linkage groups spanning 879.9 cM with an average interval of 1.15 cM. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) survey based on three rounds of clubroot resistance tests using F2:3 progenies revealed two and single major QTLs for Race 2 and Race 9 of P. brassicae, respectively. The QTLs show similar locations to the previously reported CR loci for Race 4 in B. oleracea but are in different positions from any of the CR loci found in B. rapa. We utilized two reference genome sequences in this study. The high-resolution genetic map developed herein allowed us to reposition 37 and 2 misanchored scaffolds in the 02–12 and TO1000DH genome sequences, respectively. Our data also support additional positioning of two unanchored 3.3 Mb scaffolds into the 02–12 genome sequence.1. IntroductionSince the completion of the first genome sequence of a plant, Arabidopsis thaliana,1 next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have facilitated genome sequencing and construction of reference genome sequences of many important crops.2 The reference genome sequences provide valuable information for understanding genomic variation and genome evolution. Based on the utility of reference genome sequences, detection of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) has become a valuable tool for genomic selection in plant molecular breeding due to their genome-wide abundance. Accordingly, rapid and inexpensive SNP detection methods are required for genotyping large and diverse germplasm collections or breeding populations. Genotyping by sequencing (GBS) is one such highly efficient method for genome-wide SNP detection with relatively low cost and time demands, because genome-wide reduced representation sequencing is conducted using NGS technology.3An important strength of GBS is that discovery of huge numbers of markers and genotyping of those markers occur simultaneously. GBS has been applied for construction of high-resolution genetic maps, association study for agricultural traits, and genomic prediction for development of breeding materials using populations of interest in several crop species, such as maize,3–5 soybean,6 barley,3,7 rice,8 and wheat.7 Finally, the SNP data deduced from GBS analysis can be used for genomics-assisted breeding. GBS approaches have largely been applied to crops with well-sequenced reference genomes. In further, GBS approach successfully adapted for genetic mapping without reference genome sequences.9Brassica oleracea is one of the three basic diploid Brassica species belonging to the evolutionary U's triangle10 and is an economically important vegetable crop consumed worldwide. Brassica oleracea shows extremely diverse morphology and includes vegetables such as cabbages, broccoli, cauliflowers, kohlrabi, kalian, and kales. Recently, two reference genome sequences of B. oleracea were reported; two reference pseudochromosome sequences, of 385 and 447 Mb, were independently built by positioning and ordering of de novo-assembled scaffold sequences using 1,227 PCR-based markers11,12 and 15,909 GBS-based markers,13 respectively.Clubroot is a devastating disease caused by Plasmodiophora brassicae that results in severe losses of yield and quality not only in cabbage but also in other Brassica crops.14 The pathogen induces gall formation on the root, leading to suppressed transport of nutrients and water, and finally abnormal growth and yield loss.15 Because the pathogen can survive in soil as resting spores without host plants for long periods, it is difficult to control by cultural practices or chemical treatments.16 Therefore, development of cultivars with clubroot resistance (CR) has been considered the most effective method to minimize yield loss caused by clubroot disease.In B. rapa, at least eight race-specific CR loci have been introduced from various European fodder turnips,17 and the markers for Crr1, Crr2, Crr3, Crr4, CRa, CRb, CRc, and CRk18–21 have been identified in five different chromosomes. To increase efficiency in marker-assisted selection (MAS), fine mapping was carried out for each locus in several B. rapa studies.22–25 In contrast to B. rapa, completely resistant accessions have only rarely been identified in B. oleracea.17,26 In B. rapa, the CR traits are controlled in a qualitative27,28 and quantitative manner20,21,29 depending on genotypes studied, whereas genetic studies suggest that CR are controlled by many minor QTLs in B. oleracea.17,30 DNA markers linked to CR loci in B. oleracea have been developed by several research groups, but most of these studies did not disclose specific sequence information for the various marker types. To establish a CR breeding system in B. oleracea, it is important to identify the major CR genes active to various CR races.In this study, we generated large-scale marker data sets using GBS analysis of 80 plant samples. The robust SNP marker sets developed in this study were valid for construction of a high-density genetic map and for QTL mapping of CR traits. In addition, the resulting high-resolution linkage map provided valuable information for identification of incorrectly anchored scaffold sequences and further improvement of reference genome assembly for B. oleracea. Finally, the QTLs identified herein, and the genetic map will be valuable for B. oleracea crop improvement.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materialsTwo cabbage (B. oleracea L. var. capitata) inbred lines, C1176 and C1220, were selected as parents to develop a mapping population. The two lines show different susceptibility to clubroot disease caused by P. brassicae; C1176 is susceptible, whereas C1220 is resistant. The mapping population consisted of 78 F2 plants generated by crossing between C1220 and C1176. The 78 F2 plants were vernalized and self-pollinated to produce F3 progenies for CR tests. All plant materials examined in this study were obtained from Joeun Seeds Co. (Chungcheongbuk-Do, Korea).Genomic DNAs from parental lines and F2 plants were extracted from 2 g samples of young leaves, following the modified cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) protocol.31 The quality and quantity of the DNA were examined using a NanoDrop ND-1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., USA).2.2. Library construction and sequencingGenomic DNAs of all 80 plants (two parents and 78 F2) were double digested with two different restriction endonucleases, ApeKI and MspI. The former recognizes a 5-bp sequence (GCWGC) and creates a 3-bp overhang, while the latter recognizes 4-bp sequence (CCGG) and creates a 2-bp overhang. A set of barcode adapters that recognize ApeKI-compatible sequences with variable barcode sequences (4–9 bp) for each different plant and a set of common adapters that recognize MspI-compatible sequences were ligated to the digested DNA of each plant. A total of 40 plant samples were pooled as a batch for further library construction steps, such as PCR amplification with adaptor-specific primers, and sequencing on two single lanes of Illumina Hi-seq 2000. DNA digestion, adapter ligation, library construction, and sequencing were carried out by Macrogen Co. (Korea).2.3. Raw sequence data processing and SNP genotypingRaw paired-end (PE) sequences were filtered based on criteria for sequence quality and length using the program clc_quality_trim V4.3.0.114910 (http://www.clcbio.com). Sequence reads that had <20 in sequence quality score and 50 bp of sequence length were removed, and then barcode sequences were eliminated. Filtered reads, which were ~93 bp on average, were aligned to the reference sequences of B. oleracea var. capitata homozygous line 02–12 (02–12 reference genome) reported by Liu et al.12 using the Burrows–Wheeler alignment tool (BWA)32 with default parameters, and properly paired reads were sorted by the parameter of maximum insert size (800 bp). Read grouping and removal of PCR duplicates were done using Picard (http://picard.sourceforge.net). Genome analysis toolkit (GATK) was used to perform local realignment of reads to correct misalignments due to the presence of INDELs. Finally, UnifiedGenotyper,33 which is one of the utilities in the GATK package, was used for detection of SNPs and calling of SNP genotypes. Additional filtering and genotyping processes were carried out with user-friendly option changes in the web-interfaced GBS Genotyping Pipeline, and the final genotype data were graphically displayed using GBS Browser (http://www.phyzen-lab.com/oleracea) developed by Phyzen Genomics Institute (Korea).2.4. Molecular marker analysisWe analysed 32 markers for genotyping as position markers for comparison with the GBS genotyping results: 2 EST-based dCAPS, 9 whole-genome resequencing-based dCAPS,34 3 EST-SSRs,35 16 genomic SSRs,20,36–40 and 2 polymorphic markers based on miniature inverted transposable element (MITE) insertion polymorphism (MIP)41,42 (Supplementary Table S1). The amplicons of the markers were analysed by visualization on a UV trans-illuminator after electrophoresis and stained with ethidium bromide using 9% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels or 1% agarose gels depending on amplified fragment size.2.5. Genetic map constructionDetected GBS-SNP markers were grouped and named based on the position on the reference chromosome sequences. Genotype results of all markers were listed for each F2 individual in order of position on pseudochromosomes. The genotyping scores of GBS markers and PCR-based markers were integrated, and linkage analysis and map construction were performed using JoinMap version 4.1 with the same parameters as in previous studies.34,35 Genetic and physical map positions showed the same order for most GBS-SNPs, but some SNPs were assigned different positions between the genetic map and the physical map. When the genetic mapping position of the GBS-SNP did not coincide with the physical mapping at the pseudomolecule reference genome sequence, we considered these differential positions as misallocated. These areas were named as sequence variance blocks (v-blocks) if the positions of genetic map and physical map were differential for more than three contiguous SNPs, and as small variance blocks (s-blocks) if only one or two contiguous SNPs showed different positions between the genetic and physical maps (Supplementary Fig. S1A and B). Additionally, we divided the pseudomolecule into different blocks if it was interrupted by v-blocks or showed 10–15% recombination between adjacent markers (Supplementary Fig. S1C and B). We labelled each block in alphabetical order, and the information for each block on the reference genome is described in Supplementary Table S2.2.6. Clubroot resistance test and QTL analysisInoculum preparation and resistance tests were performed by the Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology (Daejeon, Korea). Two isolates of P. brassicae, YC and GN, which were collected in Yeoncheon and Gangneung, Korea, respectively, were determined as Race 2 and 9, respectively,43 based on Williams classification.44 The pathogen was inoculated onto roots of Chinese cabbage, and the induced clubs were collected from infected roots and stored at -20°C until needed. For preparation of inocula, the clubs were ground in distilled water using a blender, and homogenized tissue was sifted through four-layered gauze. The resting spore suspensions of YC and GN isolates were diluted with sterile distilled water for inoculation. The final resting spore concentration of YC and GN was adjusted to 1.4 × 108 and 0.4 × 108 spores/ml, respectively.A total of three inoculation tests were performed, two with GN isolate in 2012 and 2014, and one with YC isolate in 2014. All analyses were carried out under the same conditions with 10–15 F2 : 3 plants of each individual F2 line randomly selected for genotyping analysis. The F3 seeds were sown and grown in 5 × 8 plastic pots for 2 weeks in a greenhouse, then the F3 plants were inoculated by applying 5 ml spore suspension at the bottom of the stem base using pipettes. Each plastic pot (40 plants) received 80 ml spore suspension, and the inoculated plants were moved into a dew chamber with the temperature set at 20°C. After incubation for 1 week, the plants were supplied with water from the bottom of the pots for 3 days and then water was withhold for another 4 days. The inoculated plants were transferred to a greenhouse at 20–25°C. The plants were evaluated for clubroot infection 5 weeks after the transfer. After the roots were completely washed, the severity of the clubroot symptoms was scored as follows; 0 = no visible clubs, 1 = a few slight clubs usually confined to lateral roots, 2 = moderate clubbing on lateral roots, 3 = larger clubs in main roots and slight clubs on lateral roots, and 4 = severe clubbing on main roots and lateral roots.A disease index for each F2 individual was calculated as the mean score of 10–15 F3 seedlings. QTLs for resistance against P. brassicae were evaluated using composite interval mapping (CIM) analysis with 0.5 cM scan intervals using the QGene program. CIM was performed with LOD (logarithm of odds) threshold values that were estimated using 1,000 permutation tests at 5% significance.2.7. Comparative analysis of CR lociThe genomes of B. oleracea and B. rapa share a set of 24 conserved chromosomal blocks.45 The complete B. oleracea draft genome also demonstrates generally strong conservation with B. rapa in large segments at the pseudomolecule level.12,13 Based on comparison with the chromosomal block reported in Liu et al.,12 syntenic blocks were compared between B. rapa and B. oleracea. We compared the loci of reported CR genes and QTLs in B. rapa20–23,46,47 and B. oleracea30 to our CR-QTLs, using basic local alignment search tool (BLAST).3. Results3.1. Sequence production and alignmentA total of ~824 million PE reads (83.2 Gb) were generated using the Illumina sequencing platform for 80 plants, with an average of 10.3 million reads per plant sample (Table 1). After removing low-quality reads and barcode sequences, 45.9 Gb of sequence data remained, with an average read length of 93.5 bp. Among 80 samples, the read amounts ranged between 256 and 897 Mb (Fig. 1A). Based on mapping on the 02–12 genome sequence,12 we classified the raw data as discarded reads (because of lack of paired read alignment on the reference genome sequence), unmapped reads, or properly aligned reads. Although the amount of data produced from each plant sample was different, the proportion of discarded reads, unmapped reads, and properly aligned reads was similar for each individual plant (Fig. 1B). In total, 66.4% (30.5 Gb) of the filtered sequence data was mapped on the reference genome, which accounted for an average of 380.9 Mb per each plant. From the mapped sequence, we did not use the reads on multi-copy regions and instead used only unique mapped reads for further analysis, representing 40.5% (a total of 18.6 Gb, which accounted for an average of 232.4 Mb per plant) of raw reads.

SNP discovery and genotypingBrassica oleracea genome underwent whole-genome triplication ~15.9 million yrs ago.12,48 To avoid incorrect genotyping by mismapping of reads in paralogous regions instead of the original position, we used the correctly mapped PE reads for which both reads were uniquely mapped with correct direction and interval on the reference genome. A total of 43,821 SNPs were detected between the two parental lines, and 18,187 of those remained after removing SNPs whose the minimum mapping depth was lower than five (Table 2). The SNPs were distributed throughout the nine chromosomes, with the most SNPs (3,261) on chromosome C03 and the fewest (1,458) on chromosome C02. Summary of SNPs detected between C1220 and C1176aGrouping same genotyping results with adjacent markers.Summary of SNPs detected between C1220 and C1176aGrouping same genotyping results with adjacent markers.Among 18,187 SNP sites, we selected 4,103 SNPs that were genotyped for all 78 F2 plants as the final data set for genetic mapping, to reduce uncertainty of placement potentially conferred by loci derived from missing data. We grouped GBS markers showing the same genotype as genetic bins, or loci, to simplify the genetic map (e.g. the first locus of linkage group C1, C1a-1(7), represents seven GBS-SNPs C1a-1 to C1a-7 in tandem) (Table 2). We noted the number of SNPs and bins per each 3 Mb along the nine chromosomes, revealing biased distribution for SNP density and genetic recombination bins. Generally, SNP density and genetic recombination bins were richer in euchromatic regions near the telomere but rare in heterochromatic regions near the centromere of each chromosome (Fig. 2).

High-density genetic mapping and refinement of two reference genomes sequenceA genetic map was built based on F2 genotyping results of 735 GBS loci represented by 4,103 markers and 32 PCR-based reported markers used for identifying linkage groups (Table 3, Fig. 3). All genotyped markers were allocated into nine linkage groups. Nine linkage groups spanned 879.9 cM with an average distance of 1.15 cM between neighbouring loci. The biggest gap in the genetic map was 15.8 cM in linkage group C02.

Markers in blue (gray) are PCR-based markers and in red (light gray) are loci derived from other pseudochromosomes. QTLs identified in inoculation tests with GN in 2012, 2014, and with YC in 2014 are shown as red (dark gray on C02 and left dark gray on C03), green (light gray), and pink (right dark gray on C03) bars, respectively.

This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.The genetic map displayed overall, but with some exceptions, contiguously collinear marker order, because markers were named based on the backbone of reference genome sequence. All linkage groups included several variance blocks (v- or s-blocks), which showed disordered markers with different order or derived from different chromosomes. Chromosome C05 and C09 had only one v-block, whereas C07 included five v-blocks (Supplementary Table S2). In addition, chromosomes C02, C03, C06, C08, and C09 included at least one s-block. According to our linkage map data, we suggest that all s- and v-blocks likely should be re-allocated into the proper positions. Linkage groups C3 and C9 contained the most complex structure. Both included 11 genetic loci derived from other pseudochromosomes (Table 3 and see the marker names in red in Fig. 3). C3 included 49 GBS markers derived from seven v-blocks, C1-v4, C7-v5, C6-v1, C6-v3, C7-v1, C1-v3, and C2-v2 derived from other chromosomes (Supplementary Table S3). Most s- and v-blocks were assigned to other chromosomes, except C3-v1 and C6-s1 block, which were misallocated into different positions in the original chromosome (Supplementary Table S3 and Fig. 3).Comparative analysis between the genetic map and the reference genome revealed the new positions for all 27 v-blocks and 10 s-blocks and several inversions of some alphabetically named blocks (Fig. 4A). The positions of GBS markers between chromosomes C04, C05, and C06 and linkage group C4, C5, and C6 suggested that there was less collinearity in those chromosomes than in the other chromosomes. Comparison between the loci in the genetic map and physical position of SNPs in nine pseudochromosomes of (A) 02–12 and (B) TO1000DH genome sequences. Misallocated scaffolds denoted with stars were compared with their corresponding sequences in the other reference genomes (Fig. 7). This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.Comparison between the loci in the genetic map and physical position of SNPs in nine pseudochromosomes of (A) 02–12 and (B) TO1000DH genome sequences. Misallocated scaffolds denoted with stars were compared with their corresponding sequences in the other reference genomes (Fig. 7). This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.Based on the relative ratio between physical and genetic distance, possible heterochromatin and euchromatin regions could be inferred (represented by black and red dotted lines between chromosomes and linkage groups, respectively in Fig. 4). Presumed heterochromatin regions from chromosomes C01, C02, C03, C07, C08, and C09 occupied large portions of pseudochromosomes, but showed low frequency of recombination in genetic maps and also low density of SNPs and bins on each pseudochromosome (Fig. 2). Many v-blocks and s-genotyped markers in pseudochromosomes tended to be localized near heterochromatin regions in linkage groups (Fig. 4). Conversely, the regions showing high frequency of recombination (represented by red dotted lines in Fig. 4) were considered as euchromatin.Another cabbage reference sequence was reported by Parkin et al.13 using the kale-like TO1000DH genotype (TO1000DH genome sequence). When we performed GBS read mapping on the TO1000DH genome sequence backbone (Fig. 4B and Supplementary Table S4), the genetic map consisted of nine linkage groups with 4,338 GBS markers (Supplementary Table S4). The genetic map identified two misanchored sequence scaffolds (v-blocks), which were mapped on the other chromosomes instead of the original position of sequences in the pseudomolecule of TO1000DH genome (Fig. 4B). We compared the v-block sequences in one unique genome with the corresponding sequence in the other reference genome sequence (denoted as star in Fig. 4). Approximately 1.5 Mb sequence of a region (39.5–41.0 Mbp) including the C7-v5 block in 02–12 genome which mapped into linkage group C3 in our map did not show corresponding sequence in chromosome C07 of TO1000DH. However, ~673 Kb of the sequence in that region corresponded to the C3a block in chromosome C03 of TO1000DH (Fig. 5A), which is coincident with our map position (stars in Fig. 4). The remaining ~860 Kb sequence could not be placed due to lack of GBS markers. The two mispositioned scaffolds of TO1000DH were identified in two v-blocks are derived from the heterochromatin regions with rare SNPs and a low recombination rate. Approximately 300 Kb of the C2-v block in chromosome C02 of TO1000DH was not present in the corresponding sequence of 02–12, and the mapping data suggested that the sequence should be repositioned in linkage group C8 (Figs 4B and 5B). Comparison of reference sequences containing V-blocks between 02–12 and TO1000DH genomes. (A) Only flanking sequences of the C7-v5 block in the 02–12 genome, estimated to be in euchromatin regions with abundant GBS markers, were found in the corresponding sequences of the TO1000DH genome. (B) Corresponding sequence of the C2-v block region in TO1000DH, which seemed to be in heterochromatin regions with sparse GBS markers, was not observed in chromosome C02 of the 02–12 genome.

Clubroot resistance assays and QTL analysisThree independent inoculation trials were performed for clubroot resistance, with GN isolate in 2012 and with GN and YC isolates in 2014. The disease index for F2 plants was determined by calculating the average value of the clubroot disease indices obtained from 10–15 F2 : 3 progeny plants in each inoculation test. Disease symptoms caused by YC isolate (Race 2) were much severer than those caused by GN isolate (Race 9) (Fig. 6). The disease symptoms induced by GN isolate were slightly different between the two independent tests in different years, possibly due to different environmental conditions. Disease index distribution of F2 population, evaluated by average scores resulted from inoculated F2 : 3 plants. This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.Disease index distribution of F2 population, evaluated by average scores resulted from inoculated F2 : 3 plants. This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.QTL analyses were performed independently for each of the three tests. We detected significant QTLs, based on LOD scores higher than the thresholds calculated in the permutation tests; LOD threshold values for the tests with GN isolate in 2012 and 2014 were 2.982 and 2.862, respectively, and the value with YC in 2014 was 2.914. From the two tests with GN isolate, two significant QTL regions were repeatedly detected; CRQTL-GN_1 on chromosome C02 and CRQTL-GN_2 on chromosome C03 (Fig. 3). In the first test, CRQTL-GN_1 had higher values for LOD score, additive effect and variance explained compared with CRQTL-GN_2 (Table 4). The contrary results were detected in the second test. The test with YC isolate identified only a signle QTL region, named CRQTL-YC, which was in chromosome C03 with a location similar to CRQTL-GN_2. CRQTL-YC showed the largest QTL effect, 8.723 LOD score, for clubroot resistance and explained 47.1% of the phenotypic variation (Table 4).

Comparative genetic analysis of CR lociWe next compared the QTL regions identified in this study with reported CR loci in B. rapa and B. oleracea (Table 5). Chromosome C02 harbouring CRQTL-GN_1 exhibited strong collinearity with A02 in B. rapa,12,13 where the CRc gene, the linked marker for which is m6R,21 was mapped (Fig. 7A). In addition, two QTLs in B. oleracea, PbBo(Anju)1 and PbBo(Anju)2 as a major and a minor QTL, respectively, were identified in linkage group O02, which also represents chromosome C02, in Nagaoka et al.30PbBo(Anju)2 is also linked to the m6R marker, and KBrH059L13 and BRMS-228 are the closely linked markers to PbBo(Anju)1. BLAST searches with the m6R marker revealed that that CRc and the PbBo(Anju)2 locus were between the C2b-9(6) and C2b-15(9) GBS markers, which were not included in CRQTL-GN_1. While the position of KBrH059L13 in the reference genome was found near the C2h-5(4) locus, BRMS-228 could not be found in the pseudochromosomes, but rather in unanchored scaffold000122_p2. Therefore, unused reads for alignment on pseudochromosomes were mapped to the scaffold with the same criteria, and two different blocks that showed different genotyping results were detected and named scaffold000122_p2a and scaffold 000122_p2b. A single SNP marker found in scaffold000122_p2b had same genotyping results as the C3-s1 locus (Supplementary Fig. S2A). The region between C2h-5(4) and C3-s1 overlapped with CRQTL-GN_1 (Fig. 7A).

This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.Chromosome C03 containing two similar QTLs, CRQTL-GN_2 and CRQTL-YC, show syntenic counterpart regions present in chromosome A03, A06, and A08 in B. rapa12,13 (Fig. 7B). The syntenic region of A03 harbours the loci for Crr3, CRk, CRa, and CRb. The locus of CRa is linked to HC352b sequence,46 and CRb is linked to B4732 and B1005 markers.23 All of those marker sequences could be found near C7-v5 block represented by C7-v5–1(6) in this study. C7-v5-1(6) was also linked to the same locus as C3b-183(20) (Fig. 3). To find the Crr1 locus present in A08, linked BSA7 marker49 sequences were searched in our genetic map, and C3e-19(14) in chromosome C03 was found to be the closest locus. In addition, BrSTS61 marker linked to Crr3 and CRk22 was found in unanchored scaffold000040. Genotyping of SNPs in scaffold00040 revealed that its position could be between C3c and C3d blocks (Supplementary Fig. S2B). The position of BRMS-330 marker linked to PbBo(Anju)330 was found in our QTLs CRQTL-GN_2 and CRQTL-YC, in chromosome C03. Although we could not find the sequence information for BRMS-125, which is linked to Crr4 and contained in A06,20 the syntenic counterpart of A06 to C03 was not related to QTL regions (Fig. 7B).4. Discussion4.1. GBS browser and GBS-based genetic mappingIn a previous study, we identified ~670,000 SNPs between two elite cabbage breeding lines using 20× genome coverage whole-genome resequencing.34 Here, a total of 43,821 GBS-based SNPs were detected between parental lines, 15-fold fewer than detected by resequencing. Although the detection power was reduced, GBS-based genotyping provided a high-density genetic map at low cost in a highly efficient manner.GBS analysis encounters bioinformatic, statistical, and computational challenges, because the large data set is frequently accompanied by a large number of erroneous SNP calling if the data are not properly filtered.8 To find suitable conditions for precise genotyping, the data set generated in this study was analysed under various conditions with various filtering options using a built-in GBS browser. In the browser, we could change the options to optimize the output (Supplementary Fig. S3). The average depth of read mapping was 11×, and we utilized SNPs derived from the regions with 5–100× read mapping depth. We filtered out SNPs derived from reads with <5× coverage to reduce uncertain genotyping due to low-coverage sequences. We also removed SNPs derived from high-depth reads, over than 100× coverage, to alleviate malalignment of reads derived from duplicated genome or repeat sequences. We further changed the criteria for genotyping of heterozygous loci and selected threshold value <0.9. We applied a stringent condition to select high-confidence GBS markers only when a genotype was present in all 80 samples with proper read mapping depth. Afterwards, we validated the genotyping results of the GBS markers by comparison to the genotyping results of 32 PCR-based markers. Consequently, we were able to obtain a high-density genetic map composed of 4,103 SNP markers even though both parental lines are cabbage breeding lines with good agriculture traits and narrow genetic diversity.GBS analysis performed by Parkin et al.13 identified 826 bins in B. oleracea, which was more than identified in this study (679 bins). Our fewer bin numbers are probably due to the difference in genetic diversity of parental lines as well as the number of segregating progeny we used for GBS analysis. We used two elite breeding lines with narrow genetic diversity as parental lines, whereas Parkin et al.13 analysed the population between doubled haploid (DH) kale-like and DH broccoli lines. We also analysed 78 F2 plants for mapping. If we increase the number of F2 individuals for fine mapping, we may identify more recombination bins.4.2. Our GBS-based high-resolution map improves the reference genome sequenceHigh-quality reference genome sequences provide information for identification of genes and regulatory elements, and thus, it is helpful for researchers to understand genomic variation.2 The genomes of A. thaliana8 and Oryza sativa50 were assembled by physical map-based approaches, which involve sequencing of minimally overlapping bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones and filling gaps by various attempts.51 Thus, the reference sequence covers almost the complete whole genome. However, most of the recent plant genome sequences were primarily assembled by whole-genome shotgun sequencing strategies using NGS technologies.2We performed GBS analysis based on the backbone of two reference genome sequences, 02–12 genome sequence reported by Liu et al.12 and TO1000DH genome sequence reported by Parkin et al.13 to construct a high-density genetic map. The pseudomolecules of 02–12 were constructed based on the genetic mapping of 1,227 PCR-based markers such as SSRs and SNPs.11 The TO1000DH genome sequence was developed by genotyping based on 15,509 GBS-based SNPs for anchoring of scaffold sequences. The TO1000DH genome sequence comprises much larger pseudomolecules (447 Mb) than the pseudochromosomes of 02–12 genome sequence (385 Mb). Here, we utilized 40.5% of the total filtered GBS reads for genotyping by excluding multi-mapped (25.9%) and un-mapped (33.6%) reads. Unmapped reads might be derived from outside of the reference pseudomolecules, probably from unanchored scaffolds or unassembled repeat sequences. In addition, 11.9 Gb of reads (25.9% of data produced in this study) showed multiple hits to the reference sequence, which is probably due to mapping of reads derived from paralogous regions associated with whole-genome triplication events in the Brassiceae tribe52,53 or repetitive sequence regions.We also expected improvement of the 02–12 genome sequence12 by discovery and ordering of unanchored scaffold sequences.54 We were able to position two unanchored scaffolds, scaffold000040 and scaffold000122_p2, which are 2,345,746 bp and 983,585 bp, respectively, into the pseudomolecule (Supplementary Fig. S2). The present 02–12 genome sequence includes ~150 Mb of unanchored scaffolds. In our analysis, >33% of GBS reads were remained as unmapped (Table 1) that could be utilized as guidance for mapping of the remaining unanchored scaffolds, similar to efforts made in barley and wheat genomes.7,54 Likewise, the genome of Drosophila simulans was developed using GBS approach, in which 30% of the unassembled scaffolds were newly assigned to linkage groups.55Furthermore, the 37 and 2 scaffold sequences in v-blocks of the 02–12 and TO1000DH genome sequences, respectively, could be updated via proper repositioning (Fig. 5). The v-blocks are usually derived from repeat-rich and recombination-deficient heterochromatin regions. Comparison of two v-blocks in both reference genome sequences identified the proper position of 673 Kb (C7-v5 block, Fig. 5A) among the 1,533 Kb mispositioned 02–12 genome sequence. The remaining 860 Kb sequence could not be placed due to lack of GBS markers (Fig. 5A). The C2-v blocks in TO1000DH identified ~300 Kb additional sequence that mapped in other C8 chromosome. However, we could not find the corresponding 300 Kb sequence in the 02–12 genome sequence (Fig. 5B). We assume that the lack of corresponding sequence in the 02–12 genome sequence is because this sequence is derived from a repeat-rich heterochromatin region. Moreover, we identified some misordered scaffolds in same chromosome. For example, the C2e block seemed to be within the C2c block, and the C6f, C6e, and C6 g blocks were likely to be inverted (Supplementary Table S3). The benefits of having both genome sequences are innumerable for genomics studies such as this one. Refining and completing the genome sequences is an ongoing task, and our analyses suggest potential errors to address. However, it remains possible that such differences are derived from utilization of different mapping populations in different B. oleracea genotypes with chromosomal-level reorganization.4.3. Clubroot resistance loci differ in the B. rapa and B. oleracea genomesWe identified two QTLs (CRQTL-GN_1 and CRQTL-GN_2) for resistance to GN isolate (Race 9) and one QTL (CRQTL-YC) for resistance to YC isolate (Race 2). Although the LOD values of the two QTLs for GN isolate were different between two tests, both QTLs were detected repeatedly in independent inoculation tests, suggesting that both QTLs are strong candidates for major QTLs against Race 9. CRQTL-YC showed the highest LOD score among all trials and also overlapped with CRQTL-GN_2. This finding implies that the CRQTL-YC locus is probably responsible for resistance against both Race 2 and Race 9. Although resistance to the YC isolate was detected only as a single resistance QTL, we think that the resistance against race 2 is likely controlled by this major QTL, CRQTL-YC, and also affected by many minor quantitative loci, because the disease index distribution of the F2 population did not follow the Mendelian single-gene segregation ratio (Fig. 6).The comparison of genetic loci between our QTLs in B. oleracea and eight CR loci in B. rapa revealed no coincidence in chromosomal positions, even though CRa, CRb, CRk, Crr1, Crr3, and Crr4 in B. rapa are known to be involved in resistance to Race 2,17,21,29,46 the same isolate as YC. Although CRa and CRb in B. oleracea were also reported as resistance genes against Race 2 using swede cv Wilhelmsburger as a resistance source,56 these results raise the possibility that none of the reported CR genes in B. rapa and B. oleracea are related to resistance in our cabbage materials, and that they have a different genetic origin of resistance genes. Because genetic loci for Race 9 resistance have not been identified in either species, our results regarding CRQTL-GN_1 and 2 can provide valuable resources for further research.The Brassicaceae family evolved from rearrangement of shared 24 chromosomal blocks (A–X blocks), which are denoted as the ancestral translocation Proto-Calepineae Karyotype (tPCK). Hundreds of species in the Brassiceae tribe are derived from whole genome triplication of the tPCK, followed by genome rearrangement.52,53,57 The fate of paralogous gene function can be differentiated in other Brassica species. We evaluated paralogous genomic blocks harbouring our QTL regions and compared the blocks to the clubroot resistance loci in B. rapa.Crr3 and CRk were found in the F block, CRa and CRb were found in the J block of chromosome A03, and Crr1 and Crr2 found in the U blocks of chromosome A08 and A01, respectively, of B. rapa. These F, J, and U blocks were not related to our CRQTL regions. The CRc gene was identified in the R block of chromosome A02 of B. rapa, and our CRQTL-YC and CRQTL-GN_2 as well as Pb-Anju3 are identified from the R block of chromosome C03 of B. oleracea (Fig. 6B). It is likely that the paralogous gene of CRc in the R block of chromosome C03 can be the candidate clubroot resistance gene in B. oleracea.Among five QTLs identified in B. oleracea by Nagaoka et al.,30 who used Race 4 for inoculation tests, PbBo(Anju)1, which had a maximum LOD score, and PbBo(Anju)3, regarded as a minor effect QTL, seemed to overlap with CRQTL-GN_1 and CRQTL-GN_2 (or CRQTL-YC), respectively. This, despite the difference in pathogen tested, two overlapping QTLs were identified, suggesting that CRQTL-GN_1 and CRQTL-GN_2 could confer resistance to Races 2, 4, and Races 2, 4, 9, respectively. In the future, cloning of CR genes and QTL analyses using more diverse races are required to characterize the relationship between clubroot resistance and the breeding materials in both B. oleracea and B. rapa.4.4. ConclusionsWe performed GBS for high-resolution mapping using an F2 population between two elite cabbage breeding lines with narrow genetic diversity. We constructed a high-resolution genetic map using 4,103 stringently filtered GBS-SNPs and 32 reference markers. Based on comparison of the high-resolution map and the position of each marker on the reference genome, we identified 37 putatively mislocated scaffolds and their suggested revised positions and also could anchor two unassigned scaffolds, thereby improving the reference genome sequence of cabbage. Moreover, two QTL regions were identified for clubroot resistance against two different P. brassicae isolates. We thus demonstrated that GBS can successfully be applied for rapid genotyping of many individuals for molecular breeding and for genetics and genomics research in cabbage.FundingThis research was supported by the Golden Seed Project (Center for Horticultural Seed Development, No. 213003-04-3-SB430) of the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (MAFRA) in the Republic of Korea and the Next Biogreen 21 program (PJ01101101) of the Rural Development Administration (RDA) and the Korea Forest Service (KFS).

To investigate the genetic architecture of flowering time, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of flowering time was conducted with a diversity panel comprising 523 B. napus cultivars and inbred lines grown in eight different environments. Genotyping was performed with a Brassica 60K Illumina Infinium SNP array. A total of 41 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) distributed on 14 chromosomes were found to be associated with flowering time, and 12 SNPs located in the confidence intervals of quantitative trait loci (QTL) identified in previous researches based on linkage analyses. Twenty-five candidate genes were orthologous to Arabidopsis thaliana flowering genes. To further our understanding of the genetic factors influencing flowering time in different environments, GWAS was performed on two derived traits, environment sensitivity and temperature sensitivity. The most significant SNPs were found near Bn-scaff_16362_1-p380982, just 13 kb away from BnaC09g41990D, which is orthologous to A. thaliana CONSTANS (CO), an important gene in the photoperiod flowering pathway. These results provide new insights into the genetic control of flowering time in B. napus and indicate that GWAS is an effective method by which to reveal natural variations of complex traits in B. napus.1. IntroductionRapeseed (Brassica napus L., AACC, 2n = 38) is one of the most important oil crops in the world. It was grown on 36.5 million ha and produced 72.7 million tonnes of seed worldwide in 2013 (FAO 2013; http://faostat.fao.org/). Rapeseed is used not only as an edible oil but also as an industrial material for lubricants and biodiesel. Brassica napus is a recent allopolyploid species that evolved from natural hybridization between two diploid progenitor species, Brassica rapa (AA, 2n = 20) and Brassica oleracea (CC, 2n = 18), followed by chromosome doubling at least 10,000 yrs ago.1,2 It was domesticated as an oilseed crop only 400–500 yrs ago.3,4 According to the requirements of vernalization, B. napus can be divided into three different growth types: spring type, semi-winter type and winter type.Flowering is an important transition from the vegetative stage to the reproductive stage, and correct timing of the floral transition is crucial to ensure reproductive success.5 Flowering time is a complex agronomic trait in B. napus. The potential of rapeseed yield depends to a large extent on flowering time.6 Rapeseed can be widely planted in China, which is the leading country for rapeseed production. One of the main reasons for its widespread growth is that it does not compete with cultivated land for summer crops such as rice and maize. The postponed flowering of rapeseed will affect summer crop planting; hence, flowering time adaptation is a major breeding goal. Currently, understanding of the genetics and molecular regulation of flowering time is mainly based on the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. In A. thaliana, ~180 genes have been identified for flowering time control.7 Five main flowering control pathways have been found.5 These five pathways are the vernalization pathway and the photoperiod pathway, which control flowering in response to seasonal changes in temperature and day length; the gibberellin pathway, which involves the requirement of gibberellic acid in flowering; the autonomous pathway, which is an endogenous regulation pathway that functions independently of the photoperiod and gibberellin pathways; and the endogenous pathway, which regulates flowering based on the age of the plant. The molecular mechanisms of these pathways have been studied extensively in A. thaliana and several other flowering plants.5Previous studies of the genetic architecture of flowering time in rapeseed were based on QTL linkage mapping using traditional molecular markers, such as restriction fragment length polymorphisms, simple sequence repeats, intron polymorphisms and sequence-related amplified polymorphism markers in bi-parental populations. Many QTLs related to the flowering time of B. napus have been detected. A total of ~15 QTLs with large phenotypic effects have been mapped, and these QTLs are mainly distributed on chromosomes A2, A9, A10, C2 and C3.8–12 Because B. napus and A. thaliana are cruciferous plants and close relatives, knowledge of genes related to flowering in B. napus is largely based on A. thaliana using comparative genomics. For example, B. napus BnFLC1 is orthologous to A. thaliana FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), the key gene in the vernalization pathway,13 and BnCOa1 is orthologous to A. thaliana CO, the core gene in the photoperiod pathway.14Linkage mapping is restricted to allelic diversity and has limited genomic resolution.15 Genome-wide association studies, also called association mapping or linkage disequilibrium (LD) mapping, can be used to study millions of polymorphisms segregating in natural populations, which can be tested for their effects on a phenotype of interest.16 GWAS was first applied in the study of human diseases.17 With the development of sequencing technologies, GWAS has been successfully applied to the genetic dissection of complex traits in plants, such as A. thaliana,18Oryza sativa,19Zea mays20 and B. napus.21,22 Compared with linkage mapping, GWAS takes less research time, because it is not necessary to create mapping population, and it takes full advantage of ancient recombination events to identify the genetic loci underlying traits at a relatively high resolution.23–25In this study, a diversity panel consisting of 523 B. napus cultivars and inbred lines was genotyped with the Brassica 60K Illumina Infinium SNP array. Flowering times of the panel were investigated in eight different environments. The objectives of this study were to (i) determine the extent of LD in the population, (ii) dissect the genetic architecture of flowering time in B. napus and (iii) investigate the genetic control of the variation in flowering time in different environments.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materials and field trialsA diversity panel, consisting of 523 B. napus cultivars and inbred lines, was used for association analysis in this study (Supplementary Table S1). These germplasms originated from 10 countries on 4 continents, and most came from China. These accessions included winter oilseed rape (OSR) (40), semi-winter OSR (433) and spring OSR (44) (Supplementary Table S1). The self-pollinated seeds for each accession were planted in the experimental field with a randomized complete block design of three replications in eight natural environments at five different locations. Each plot contained two rows, with 12 plants in each row and 20 cm between plants within each row and 30 cm between rows. They were sown at the end of September or the beginning of October and harvested the following May. The eight natural environments were E1 (Wuhan; 114.35°E, 30.48°N), E2 (Changsha; 113.09°E, 28.20°N), E3 (Nanjing; 119.18°E, 31.58°N), E4 (Ezhou; 114.90°E, 30.38°N) and E5 (Chongqing; 116.37°E, 40.017°N) in the 2012–13 growing seasons; and E6 (Wuhan), E7 (Chongqing) and E8 (Nanjing) in the 2013–14 growing season. The eight environments were semi-winter growing environment and the winter mean temperatures in the eight environments ranged from 0.8–7.7°C to 4.5–12.2°C (Supplementary Table S2).2.2. Phenotyping and statistical analysisFlowering time data were recorded as the number of days from the sowing day to the day 25% of the plants had at least one open flower in one plot in each environment. Flowering time was investigated for three replicates in E1, E5 and E6 and was investigated for only one replicate in the other five environments. Flowering time of each accession was defined as the average of the three replicates in the same environment. The coefficient of variation of flowering time (FT-CV) was used as a derived trait of environment sensitivity for each accession across the eight environments. FT-2013/2014 is the ratios of flowering times of the 2012–13 growing season to the 2013–14 growing season in the same location. SPSS software was used for the statistical analysis. The best linear unbiased prediction of flowering time (FT-BLUP) for each line in the eight environments was calculated using an R script (www.eXtension.org/pages/61006, 20 November 2015, date last accessed) based on a linear model.262.3. Genotyping and SNP marker filteringGenomic DNA for genotyping was extracted from leaf tissues collected from three plants of each accession by a modified cetyltrimethylammonium bromide method.27 Genotyping was performed using the Brassica 60K Illumina Infinium SNP array. The SNP data were clustered and called automatically using Illumina BeadStudio genotyping software. The standards of quality control for SNP data were as follows: call frequency =0.8, minor allele frequency (MAF) =0.05 and homozygous genotype frequency cannot be zero. The probe sequences of the SNP array were used to perform a BLAST search against the B. napus Genomes Browser (http://www.genoscope.cns.fr/brassicanapus/, 20 November 2015, date last accessed). They were regarded as non-specific markers when BLAST matched to two or more locations in the reference genome. SNP markers used for LD analysis and association analysis were filtered with the following steps: (i) non-specific markers were excluded; (ii) markers that were not up to these standards of quality control for SNP data were eliminated; (iii) markers that did not have specific physical location information were excluded. SNPs that were selected for assessing population structure and relative kinship were filtered using the above first two steps.2.4. Population structure, relative kinship and LD analysisSTRUCTURE 2.3.4 software was used to estimate the population structure with a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo model (MCMC). Each K value, as a putative number of populations set from 1 to 10, was obtained with five independent runs. The length of the burn-in period and number of MCMC replications after burn-in were set to 50,000 and 100,000, respectively. The true k value was determined by the log probability of the data (LnP(K)) and an ad hoc statistic <U+0394>K, based on the rate of change in LnP(K) between successive K values.28 The Q matrix was the result of the integration of the cluster membership coefficient matrices of replicate runs from STRUCTURE by the CLUMPP software. Principal component analysis (PCA) was also used to assess the population structure. PowerMarker version 3.25 was used to calculate genetic distances among varieties by the method of Nei's genetic distances.29 After double centring, distance matrices were used to obtain eigenvectors in NTSYSpc version 2.1. The relative kinship matrix was calculated using SPAGeDi software, and all negative values between two individuals were set to 0. The parameter r2 was used to estimate LD by TASSEL version 4.0. The polymorphism information content (PIC) of the SNP markers was estimated using PowerMarker version 3.25.302.5. Genome-wide association analysisPopulation structure and kinship were used to correct for false positives.31 The association analysis was performed with models by TASSEL version 4.0. The general linear model (GLM) included the naïve model that did not control for population structure and kinship; the Q model controlled the population structure using the Q matrix from STRUCTURE software to identify populations; the PCA model controlled the population structure using the top two principal components (PCs) from PCA to assess populations. The mixed linear model (MLM) included the following: the K model controlling kinship using the kinship matrix from SPAGeDi software to assess inter-individual relative kinship; the Q + K model controlling population structure with the Q matrix and kinship with the kinship matrix and the PCA + K model controlling population structure and kinship using the top two principal components and the kinship matrix, respectively. The Bonferroni test (0.05/number of tests) criterion is typically a very strict threshold;32 therefore, negative log (0.05/n) was used as a threshold for significance of associations between SNPs and traits, where n was the total number of SNPs used in the association analysis. In this study, the threshold was 5.6 (-log (0.05/21,117) ˜ 5.6). Quantile–quantile plots were created with a negative log value of the expected P-value from the genotype–phenotype association and the expected P-value from the assumption that no association exists between genotype and phenotype.3. Results3.1. Phenotypic variationsFlowering times of these accessions ranged from 94 to 202 days, with an average of 160 days across the eight environments, showing extensive variation in the association panel. Flowering times in different environments also showed great variation (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. S1). The shortest average flowering times was 151 days in E5, and the longest was 168 days in E8 (Table 1). There were also differences in flowering times of the association panel at the same location in different years. For example, FT-2013/2014 is the ratio of flowering times across pairs of years in the same location. The average values of FT-2013/2014 were <1 in Changsha and Nanjing, and >1 in Wuhan (Table 1). This means that in Changsha and Nanjing, flowering times in 2013 were earlier than that in 2014. However, in Wuhan, flowering time in 2013 was slightly later than that in 2014. These results suggest that flowering time can be greatly affected by the environment. The descriptive statistics of phenotypic variations for flowering time in the association panelSE: standard error; CV: coefficient of variation.aFT is the abbreviation of flowering time, which was recorded as the number of days from the sowing date to flowering.bFT-CV is the coefficient variation of flowering time of each accession across the eight environments.cFT-2013/2014 is the ratio of flowering times across pairs of years in the same location.The descriptive statistics of phenotypic variations for flowering time in the association panelSE: standard error; CV: coefficient of variation.aFT is the abbreviation of flowering time, which was recorded as the number of days from the sowing date to flowering.bFT-CV is the coefficient variation of flowering time of each accession across the eight environments.cFT-2013/2014 is the ratio of flowering times across pairs of years in the same location.FT-CV ranged from 1.85 to 15.38%, with an average of 4.12%, and it had a CV of 34.64% (Table 1), showing extensive variation in the association panel. FT-CV, as a derived trait of environment sensitivity, was used to assess the stability of flowering time in different environments. The results show that flowering times of some accessions were stable in different environments and were not sensitive to environmental factors, whereas other accessions showed instability in flowering times under diverse environments.3.2. Screening of SNPs and LD in rapeseedThe Brassica 60K Illumina Infinium SNP array contained 52,157 SNPs. A total of 21,181 SNPs had BLAST matches to two or more locations in the reference genome and were therefore eliminated. In the remaining SNPs, 4,952 SNPs that were not up to the standards of quality control for SNP data were excluded. Finally, 26,024 SNPs were selected for assessing population structure and relative kinship. Of 26,024 SNPs, 21,117 had specific physical location information and were used for LD analysis and association analysis (Supplementary Table S3). These SNP markers were not evenly distributed across the whole genome. C9 had the lowest SNP marker density of one SNP per 77 kb, and A10 and C4 had the highest marker density of one SNP per 20 kb. The mean PIC values of the A subgenome and C subgenome were 0.3052 and 0.2974, respectively, and PIC values for each chromosome ranged from 0.2781 to 0.3219 (Table 2). LD was estimated as r2 (the squared pearson correlation coefficient) between all pairs of SNP markers. In the association panel, the LD decay of B. napus extending over a large distance was 6.5 Mb, where r2 = 0.1. The A subgenome and C subgenome were 1.2 and 7.8 Mb, respectively, and C subgenome LD was significantly higher than that of the A subgenome (Fig. 1A). LD decay ranged from 0.6 to 8.5 Mb among all chromosomes; however, the LD decay distance of chromosome A8 was 5.6 Mb, which was abnormally large compared with values for other chromosomes in the A subgenome (Table 2). These results revealed significant differences in the level of LD between different chromosomes and subgenomes.

Population structure and relative kinshipPopulation structure was assessed by setting possible K values ranging from 1 to 10 with five replicates for each K value using STRUCTURE software. The LnP(K) value increased continuously with the increase of K from 1 to 10, and there was no obvious inflexion point. However, the most apparent change in LnP(K) appeared when K increased from 1 to 2, and the highest <U+0394>K value was observed at K = 2 (Supplementary Fig. S2). Hence, the population could be divided into two clusters, P1 and P2 (Fig. 1B). Most lines originated from China, and only 47 lines were from other countries in the association panel. P1 contained 96 lines, of which 25 lines were from Europe and 2 lines were from Canada and Australia. P2 contained 424 lines, of which 10 lines were from Europe, 7 lines were from Japan and Korea and 4 lines had unknown origins. The others were all from China. Most of winter OSR germplasms and spring OSR germplasms were assigned into P2 and P1, respectively. (Supplementary Table S1). In addition, PCA was used to assess genetic variation in the panel. The top two PCs explained 44% of the genetic variation, and P1 and P2 formed clear clusters based on the two PCs (Fig. 1C).The average relative kinship between any two inbred lines was 0.0443 in the panel; ~54% of kinship estimates between lines were equal to 0, and 95% of kinship coefficients ranged from 0 to 0.2. The average pairwise relative kinship coefficient in P2 was 0.0423, and ~96% of the kinship estimates between lines ranged from 0 to 0.2. The average pairwise relative kinship coefficient of P1, however, was 0.2652, which was greater than the values for the total population and P2. In P1, 49% of the pairwise relative kinship coefficients ranged from 0.2 to 0.5 (Fig. 1D). These results reveal that most lines in the panel and P2 had very weak kinship, and there was close kinship in the lines of P1.3.4. Association mappingTo determine which model was more suitable for association mapping in our analysis, FT-BLUP was used to perform the association analysis in six models separately. The six models were as follows: the GLM model, including a naïve model; the Q model; the PCA model, the MLM model, including a K model; the PCA + K model; and the Q + K model. PCA and Q were used to control population structure, and K was used to control kinship. Except naïve model, PCA, Q and K were applied in corresponding models. As seen in the QQ plots (Fig. 2A), observed values had serious deviations from the expected values with the GLM model, which means that there was a high risk of false positives. Observed values were close to the expected values with the MLM model. Compared with the GLM model, the MLM model could better control false positives. Using PCA to estimate population structure was better than using the Q model in controlling false positives. To further control false positives, the PCA + K model was eventually selected for association mapping. Genome-wide association scan for flowering time.

The common significant association signal Bn-scaff_16362_1-p380982 is outlined with a vertical dashed line.A total of 41 significant association signals for flowering time were identified with P < 10-5.6 by the PCA + K model in a genome-wide scan. Among the 41 SNPs, 40 SNPs were identified using the phenotypic values in individual environments (Supplementary Fig. S3 and Table 3), and 14 SNPs were identified using BLUP values across eight environments (Fig. 2B and Table 3). In total, nine SNPs were detected in more than two environments (Table 3). There was strong LD between two SNPs when their r2 (the squared Pearson correlation coefficient) was >0.75. In our study, these SNPs were considered to be the same QTL. These significant SNPs constituted 35 QTLs, which were distributed on 14 chromosomes across the B. napus genome and explained 5.28–15.75% of the phenotypic variation (Table 3). The summary of SNPs significantly associated with flowering timeaR2 is the percentage of phenotypic variance explained by SNP.The summary of SNPs significantly associated with flowering timeaR2 is the percentage of phenotypic variance explained by SNP.Our research found that the LD decay of B. napus was in a relatively long distance (Table 2), and previous research showed that genome-wide significant associations for B. napus erucic acid content were, respectively, 233 and 128 kb away from the key genes BnaA.FAE1 and BnaC.FAE1.22 In our study, B. napus genes orthologous to A. thaliana flowering time-related genes located within 300 kb of significant SNPs were treated as candidate genes. There were 25 candidate genes identified using this standard. The average r2 ranged from 0.1 to 0.85 in the regions between candidate genes and significant SNPs, and there were 15 candidate genes in high level of LD (r2 > 0.33) with corresponding SNPs associated with flowering time (Supplementary Table S4). The closest distance between the candidate genes and significant SNPs was ~6 kb. Twelve genes were within 100 kb of their corresponding significant signals and included genes orthologous to CO, FLC, VERNALIZATION INSENSITIVE 3, and SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (Fig. 3). Brassica napus BnaA10g22080D which is orthologous to A. thaliana FLC was within 81 kb of two significant SNPs on A10, Bn-A10-p15022346 and Bn-A10-p15106056. There were four paralogous gene pairs in these candidate genes, which revealed that the QTL containing Bn-A10-p13051361 is homologous to the QTL that contain Bn-scaff_16362_1-p404058, Bn-scaff_16362_1-p385614 and Bn-scaff_16362_1-p380982 (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table S4).

Numbers represent the relative distances in the genome, 1 = 1 kb.FT-CV, the CV of flowering times across the eight environments, as an environment sensitivity trait, and FT-2013/2014, the ratios of flowering times between 2 yrs at the same location, as the temperature sensitivity trait, were used to perform the association analysis. There were three groups of data on temperature sensitivity, and no significant signal (-log10P > 5.6) was found in Changsha. Twenty-four SNPs were found to be associated with temperature sensitivity, and six SNPs associated with environment sensitivity were also associated with temperature sensitivity. The most significant SNPs associated with environment sensitivity and temperature sensitivity were found near Bn-scaff_16362_1-p380982, located at 43.7 Mb of chromosome C9 (Fig. 2C and Supplementary Table S5). Bn-scaff_16362_1-p380982 was also associated with flowering time in E6 (Table 3). Three candidate genes, BnaC09g41980D, BnaC09g41990D and BnaC09g42060D that are, respectively, orthologous to A. thaliana CONSTANS-like 1, CO and AGAMOUS-LIKE 2 were located in 52 kb away from the association signal (Fig. 3). These results reveal that there may be some important adaptation-related genes controlling flowering time near the association signal.4. Discussion4.1. LD in the rapeseed panelIn a population of 192 inbred lines of B. napus, the LD decayed within 0.5–1 cM.33 In another population of 472 rapeseed inbred lines, the longest LD decay was on chromosome C1 with 24,417 kb and the shortest was on chromosome A3 with 294 kb.34 In a diverse panel of 203 Chinese semi-winter rapeseed breeding lines, the LD decay of A subgenome and C subgenome was 0.25–0.30 and 2.00–2.50 Mb, respectively.35 Our study found that the LD decay was 6.5 Mb. Other species show LD decays of 100 kb–1 Mb (rice),36 1–100 Kb (maize)37–39 and 250 kb (A. thaliana).40 These results reveal that the LD decay in B. napus is higher than that in other species, and the evolutionary time and mating system may be the main reasons for this difference. Mutation provides the raw material for producing polymorphisms that will be in LD, and recombination is the main phenomenon that weakens intrachromosomal LD.41Brassica napus is a recent species that was formed ~10,000 yrs ago.1 As such, there has been limited time for B. napus to accumulate more mutations and undergo restructuring events. Furthermore, B. napus is often cross-pollinated; fertilization events are approximately one-third cross-fertilization and two-thirds self-fertilization.42 Self-fertilization causes populations to become composed of homozygous individuals, and high levels of homozygosity limit the effectiveness of recombination.43 The comparatively high resolution provided by association mapping is dependent upon the structure of LD across the genome.24 The high level of LD may make it hard to get a high-resolution result by association mapping. In B. napus, GWAS has been proved to be an effective tool in fine mapping of complex traits in a population which has the level of LD similar to our population.22 However, the resolution provided by association study will be higher in the population with more diverse germplasm bases.The average PIC value of the A subgenome was slightly higher than that of the C subgenome. This result is consistent with the finding that the A subgenome LD decayed in a relatively shorter distance compared with the C subgenome, meaning that the genetic diversity in the A subgenome is higher than that in the C genome. In our association panel, the majority of accessions were from China. Chinese B. napus has been improved by intentional introgression of genomic components from Chinese B. rapa.44 The A subgenome of B. napus is from European B. rapa, and Chinese B. rapa differs from European B. rapa.1,44,45 Therefore, the introgression into B. napus from Chinese B. rapa significantly increased the genetic diversity of the A genome. The LD of chromosome A8 decayed significantly slower than that of other chromosomes in the A subgenome. A similar result was found in previous studies.34BnaA.FAE1, which has been cloned and confirmed as the key gene controlling the content of erucic acid in rapeseed, is on chromosome A8.22,46,47 The strong artificial selection in the process of breeding is probably an important cause of longer LD decay distances on chromosome A8.4.2. Population structure and controlling false-positive resultsThis association population was classified into two subpopulations, but they were not completely separated according to geographical origin. In previous rapeseed association mapping panels, it is also hard to completely separate rapeseed lines according to geographical origin.22,33 Inter-specific crosses and hybridization between diverse germplasms from different countries were used to improve adaptation to the local environment and improve quality after B. napus spread to Australia, Canada, Japan and China.48–50 This spread resulted in introgression between germplasms of different countries. Moreover, there has been limited time for B. napus to undergo domestication after it was spread to different countries. Therefore, it is difficult to completely classify the association population according to geographical origins.The Brassica 60K Illumina Infinium SNP array was developed by an international consortium preferentially using single-locus SNPs identified from genomic and transcriptomic sequencing in genetically diverse Brassica germplasm.51 This approach was designed before the B. napus ‘Darmor-Bzh’ genome52 was released. Brassica napus is an allotetraploid species, with some SNPs from homologous sequence variants (HSVs) and paralogous sequence variants (PSVs). Previous research has found that 87.5–91.2% of the polymorphisms were from homologous genes from the two subgenomes in B. napus.53 HSVs and PSVs will lead to genotyping errors of the association panel, which may cause false positives in subsequent association mapping. Hence, excluding SNPs not in a single MEGABLAST hit by BLAST analysis of probe sequences against the reference genome will eliminate interference from HSVs and PSVs.Genotype–phenotype covariance can lead to spurious associations.54 Many genetic markers appear to be associated with phenotype. In fact, these genetic markers simply capture the genetic relatedness among individuals.55 Flowering time was particularly strongly correlated with geographic origins and population structure in Z. mays and A. thaliana.56,57 The trait and polymorphism(s) were associated very strongly when population structure was ignored, but the association disappeared when structure was considered.57 As described in Fig. 2A, compared with the naïve model, the models making use of Q and PCA to control false positives from the population structure slightly reduced inflation of P-values. The MLM model, including the K model, PCA + K model and Q + K model, can markedly reduce inflation of P-values. Therefore, P-values were serious inflated when kinship was ignored. This indicates that relative kinship within the population probably is one of the major factors resulting in false positives in our association study.4.3. QTLs and candidate genes for flowering time involvementTwelve SNPs associated with flowering time were located in,9,10,12,58–60 and seven SNPs near,9,10 the confidence intervals of QTLs identified in previous studies based on linkage analysis (Supplementary Table S6). There were 11 SNPs allele frequencies that showed significant difference between spring OSR group and winter OSR group (Supplementary Table S7). These SNPs corresponding candidate genes included some important vernalization-related orthologous genes, for example, BnaA10g22080D, BnaA02g08140D and BnaC09g41500D (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table S7). BnaA10g22080D was the only candidate gene in the 300 kb range of the three SNPs Bn-A10-p14914898, Bn-A10-p15022346 and Bn-A10-p15106056, and was in the same location as BnFLC.A10.61 There was only one amino acid difference in the amino acid sequences of BnaA10g22080D and BnFLC1, and expression of BnFLC1 in A. thaliana delayed flowering significantly relative to untransformed Ler.13BnaA10g22080D is likely a functional allele related to vernalization. In addition, the remaining SNPs that have not been identified previously in linkage analysis may be novel and important QTLs related to flowering time; they should be verified by other methods in future research.Flowering time is under the control of diverse environmental stimuli, such as temperature and photoperiod.5 The temperature and photoperiod of different regions have significant differences, and there are also significant differences between the temperatures at the same location in different years. Considering the influence of environmental factors on flowering, the dates of flowering time in the eight different environments were separately analysed with association mapping. BLUP minimized the impacts of different locations and years on flowering time, and conversely, the derived trait of environment sensitivity highlighted these impacts. In the same location, the average temperatures of 2013–14 growing season were higher than that of 2012–13 growing season (Supplementary Table S2). Therefore, the ratio of flowering times between 2 yrs in the same location was regarded as a derived trait of temperature sensitivity. Six SNPs associated with environment sensitivity were also associated with temperature sensitivity (Fig. 2C and Supplementary Table S5). This result suggests that a particular factor affecting flowering times in different years in the same location may have been the major factor that led to differences in the flowering times in the eight environments. Temperature is one of the major environmental factors, but other factors affecting the flowering time could not be ruled out and should be studied in future research. Deep insight into the genetic factors and environmental factors influencing flowering time in different germplasms has a large application potential in rapeseed breeding and cultivation. The BnaC09g41990D orthologue of A. thaliana CO is only 13 kb away from the common significant association signal of environment sensitivity and temperature sensitivity. The temporal and spatial regulation of CO is key to the photoperiod-dependent induction of flowering, and recent research has found that CO protein stability is also affected by temperature.5,62 The TARGET OF EAT1 (TOE1) proteins interact with the activation domain of CO proteins and inhibit CO activity,63 and expression of TOE1 was reduced at 23°C compared with levels at 16°C.64 CO degradation by HIGH EXPRESSION OF OSMOTICALLY RESPONSIVE GENE 1 is increased under low temperature conditions (4°C).65,66BnCOa1, BnCOa9, BnCOb1 and BnCOb9 are orthologous to the Arabidopsis CO gene and were isolated from a pair of homoeologous loci in each of two B. napus lines displaying different flowering times. BnCOa1 has been shown to rescue the co-2 mutation in Arabidopsis.14 BLAST analysis showed that BnaA10g18430D and BnCOa9, and BnaC09g41990D and BnCOb1 have the same amino acid sequences. BnaA10g18430D and BnaC09g41990D were shown to have 98.7 and 94.3% identity, respectively, to BnCOa1 at the amino acid level. Given the above data, BnaC09g41990D and BnaA10g18430D are important candidate genes that may control B. napus flowering time using photoperiod and temperature.FundingThis work was supported by the National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2012AA101107), 948 Program of Ministry of Agriculture of China (2011-G23), the National Basic Research Program of China (2011CB109300) and Natural science Foundation of Hubei province Key program (2014CFA008).

Essentially, the whole-genome resequencing of low and high pod number-containing parental accessions and homozygous individuals (constituting bulks) from each of these two mapping populations discovered >8 million high-quality homozygous SNPs with respect to the reference kabuli chickpea. The functional significance of the physically mapped SNPs was apparent from the identified 2,264 non-synonymous and 23,550 regulatory SNPs, with 8–10% of these SNPs-carrying genes corresponding to transcription factors and disease resistance-related proteins. The utilization of these mined SNPs in <U+0394> (SNP index)-led QTL-seq analysis and their correlation between two mapping populations based on mQTL-seq, narrowed down two (CaqaPN4.1: 867.8 kb and CaqaPN4.2: 1.8 Mb) major genomic regions harbouring robust pod number QTLs into the high-resolution short QTL intervals (CaqbPN4.1: 637.5 kb and CaqbPN4.2: 1.28 Mb) on chickpea chromosome 4. The integration of mQTL-seq-derived one novel robust QTL with QTL region-specific association analysis delineated the regulatory (C/T) and coding (C/A) SNPs-containing one pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) gene at a major QTL region regulating pod number in chickpea. This target gene exhibited anther, mature pollen and pod-specific expression, including pronounced higher up-regulated (~3.5-folds) transcript expression in high pod number-containing parental accessions and homozygous individuals of two mapping populations especially during pollen and pod development. The proposed mQTL-seq-driven combinatorial strategy has profound efficacy in rapid genome-wide scanning of potential candidate gene(s) underlying trait-associated high-resolution robust QTL(s), thereby expediting genomics-assisted breeding and genetic enhancement of crop plants, including chickpea.1. IntroductionChickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) is the third most vital food legume with a genome size of ~720 Mb.1,2 The current climatic conditions are adversely affecting the world-wide chickpea productivity to a large extent by highly variable phenotypic plasticity in conjunction with multiple abiotic and biotic stresses, including drought, terminal heat stress, salinity, Fusarium wilt and Ascochyta blight.2–5 Therefore, the primary goal of present chickpea genomics is focused towards minimizing the effect of climate change and biotic/abiotic stresses upon chickpea yield and productivity by developing genetically tailored high-yielding stress-tolerant chickpea cultivars. However, most of the stress tolerance and yield component traits targeted for chickpea genetic enhancement usually have complex genetic architecture and are regulated by multiple major and/or minor genes/QTLs (quantitative trait loci). It is thus imperative to delineate the potential genes/alleles underlying QTLs associated with various traits of interest (yield contributing and stress-tolerant traits) by fine mapping/map-based cloning prior to their effective deployment in marker-assisted genetic enhancement of chickpea. So far, very limited attention has been paid towards fine mapping of trait-regulatory QTLs and their subsequent utilization in marker-assisted genetic improvement of chickpea.6–13 The narrow genetic base including low marker genetic polymorphism especially between parental accessions of diverse intra-specific mapping populations along with inadequate accessibility of high-density, intra-specific genetic linkage maps are the major bottlenecks in identification and fine mapping of QTLs in chickpea. In this perspective, an alternative genome-wide strategy is crucial for rapid molecular mapping of trait-associated high-resolution QTLs/genes, which in turn will benefit marker-assisted breeding in chickpea.To accelerate molecular mapping of QTLs in chickpea, traditional QTL mapping strategy14–16 that primarily relies on genome-wide discovery and large-scale genotyping of simple sequence repeat (SSR) and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in individuals of diverse inter-/intra-specific mapping populations (recombinant inbred and near-isogenic lines) by using multiple high-throughput genotyping assays, including NGS (next-generation sequencing)-based GBS (genotyping-by-sequencing) assay, are found to be most fruitful in chickpea.9–13, 17–23 This approach successfully identified a number of low-resolution major QTLs governing various yield contributing (i.e. flowering and maturation time, seed size/100-seed weight, double podding and seed/pod number per plant) and abiotic/biotic stress tolerance traits (viz. salinity and drought tolerance root traits, Fusarium wilt, Ascochyta blight and Botrytis gray mold) in chickpea.1,2, 8–13, 22–41 In light of the added advantages and its broader applicability vis-à-vis the diverse aforesaid traditional QTL mapping approaches, the high-throughput NGS-based QTL-seq has recently been used fruitfully as a cost-effective strategy for rapid genome-wide scanning and mapping of major QTLs governing multiple qualitative and quantitative traits such as seedling vigour and blast resistance in rice, flowering time in cucumber, fruit weight and locule number in tomato, and 100-seed weight in chickpea.42–45 Nonetheless, most of the major QTLs identified through QTL-seq are being localized within sizeable long genetic marker intervals of chromosomes, which requires large-scale validation in multiple mapping populations and subsequent fine mapping through traditional QTL mapping. This will ensure the effective practical utilization of these well-validated robust QTLs/genes in marker-assisted genetic improvement of chickpea.Simultaneously to expedite the above-mentioned, a multiple QTL-seq (mQTL-seq) approach that involves QTL-seq analysis in multiple mapping populations derived from the common parental accessions could be an attractive genome-wide strategy. Essentially, mQTL-seq deals with NGS-based whole-genome resequencing of DNA bulks (showing two extreme contrasting phenotypic trait values) of progenies that are derived from each of the multiple segregating mapping population with at least single common parental accession (detailed strategy illustrated in Fig. 1). Collectively, the utility of this strategy is evident from the large-scale validation of major QTLs derived from QTL-seq of each preliminary/advanced generation mapping population in diverse genetic backgrounds (multiple mapping populations) along with its efficiency to scale down each QTL-seq originated QTLs into potential candidate genes regulating diverse agronomic traits in chickpea. Henceforth, implementing this mQTL-seq approach can be beneficial for quick genome-wide scanning and fine mapping of trait-associated major genes harbouring robust QTLs (validated in diverse mapping populations) with optimal expense of resources in chickpea. This will provide much needed inputs for molecular dissection of complex quantitative traits culminating into genomics-assisted crop improvement in chickpea at a faster pace.

(C) The <U+0394> (SNP index)-based QTL-seq analysis (following detailed strategies of Takagi et al.42 and Das et al.44) using NGS-genome resequences of parents and bulks from each of the multiple mapping populations to identify major genomic regions that underlie QTLs governing particular agronomic trait in chickpea. The major QTLs identified from each of the multiple mapping populations are localized at varying physical sequence intervals (Mb) spanned by flanking SNP markers on the chromosomes. For instance, QTL-seq analysis in two contrasting pod number mapping populations identified two genomic regions harbouring two major pod number QTLs (PNQTL1 and PNQTL2) that spanned X and Y-Mb sequence intervals between M1 and M2 as well as M3 and M4 flanking SNP markers, respectively, on the same chromosomes. (D) Integration of QTL-seq-derived individual QTL outcomes from multiple mapping populations (with at least one common parent) called ‘mQTL-seq (multiple QTL-seq)’ for large-scale validation of these identified major QTLs in multiple genetic backgrounds to scan the robust QTLs, and further to narrow down the longer robust QTL intervals into shorter genomic intervals for delineation of candidate gene(s) regulating the trait under study. The integration of QTL-seq-derived two pod number QTLs (PNQTL1 and PNQTL2) identified from two mapping populations enabled to validate these QTLs in two diverse genetic backgrounds to ascertain their robustness for pod number regulation in chickpea. Further, the mQTL-seq analysis scaled-down a longer QTL interval (spanned X Mb) into a shorter pod number robust QTL interval (spanned Y Mb) flanking within M3 and M4 SNP markers on the chromosome; this can serve as a potential target genomic region for rapid identification and delineation of candidate gene(s) regulating pod number in chickpea.

For instance, QTL-seq analysis in two contrasting pod number mapping populations identified two genomic regions harbouring two major pod number QTLs (PNQTL1 and PNQTL2) that spanned X and Y-Mb sequence intervals between M1 and M2 as well as M3 and M4 flanking SNP markers, respectively, on the same chromosomes. (D) Integration of QTL-seq-derived individual QTL outcomes from multiple mapping populations (with at least one common parent) called ‘mQTL-seq (multiple QTL-seq)’ for large-scale validation of these identified major QTLs in multiple genetic backgrounds to scan the robust QTLs, and further to narrow down the longer robust QTL intervals into shorter genomic intervals for delineation of candidate gene(s) regulating the trait under study. The integration of QTL-seq-derived two pod number QTLs (PNQTL1 and PNQTL2) identified from two mapping populations enabled to validate these QTLs in two diverse genetic backgrounds to ascertain their robustness for pod number regulation in chickpea. Further, the mQTL-seq analysis scaled-down a longer QTL interval (spanned X Mb) into a shorter pod number robust QTL interval (spanned Y Mb) flanking within M3 and M4 SNP markers on the chromosome; this can serve as a potential target genomic region for rapid identification and delineation of candidate gene(s) regulating pod number in chickpea. This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.As a proof of concept, we made an effort to implement an NGS-based genome-wide high-throughput mQTL-seq approach in two F5 mapping populations of C. arietinum and C. reticulatum inter-specific crosses (Pusa 1103 × ILWC 46 and Pusa 256 × ILWC 46) for identifying the major genomic regions harbouring the robust QTLs associated with pod number per plant in chickpea. The integration of mQTL-seq with QTL region-specific association analysis and differential expression profiling delineated a potential novel candidate gene and natural allelic variants at the major QTL interval governing pod number in chickpea.2. Materials and methods2.1. Development of inter-specific mapping populations and their phenotyping for pod numberTwo inter-specific F5 mapping populations of Pusa 1103× ILWC 46 (population size, 102) and Pusa 256× ILWC 46 (population size, 98) derived from high (cultivated C. arietinum desi accessions Pusa 1103 and Pusa 256 with 129 and 120 pods/plant, respectively) and low (wild C. reticulatum accession ILWC 46 with 10 pods/plant) pod number-containing parental accessions were developed using single seed descent method. The wild accession ILWC 46 serves as a common parent for both the populations generated. The mapping individuals and parental accessions of both populations were grown (following random complete block design with two replications) and phenotyped in the real field conditions at two diverse geographical locations of India (CSKHPKV, Palampur: latitude 32.1°N and longitude 76.5°E and NBPGR, New Delhi: 28.6°N and 77.2°E) for two consecutive years. A set of 15–20 representative plants were selected from each mapping individual and parental accession of both populations, and pod number (PN) was measured by counting the average number of fully developed pods per plant at maturity stage. The mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation (CV%), broad-sense heritability (H2) and frequency distribution of PN (based on ANOVA) were measured in both populations individually as per Kujur et al.10,11 and Bajaj et al.23 To determine the trait inheritance pattern, the effects/interactions among accessions/genotypes (G) and environments (E) (i.e. experimental years and geographical locations) were measured. The broad-sense heritability among accessions [H2 = s2g/(s2g + s2ge/n + s2e/nr)] was measured based on s2g (genetic), s2ge (G x E) and s2e (error) variance with n (number of experimental years/environments) = 2 and r (number of replicates) = 2. Additionally, 92 desi and kabuli chickpea accessions representing a PN-specific association panel were also grown in the field and phenotyped for pod number following aforesaid methods.2.2. Whole-genome resequencing and mQTL-seq analysisAccording to the preliminary clues obtained from our traditional QTL mapping analysis, 10 of each high and low pod number-containing homozygous mapping individuals (a total of 20 individuals) representing two utmost ends of PN normal frequency distribution curve were selected individually from the mapping populations of Pusa 1103 × ILWC 46 and Pusa 256 × ILWC 46 for QTL-seq analysis. The homozygous genetic constitution of these selected 20 individuals from each of the two mapping populations for either of the high and low pod number trait was ascertained by utilizing their PN field phenotyping information and genotyping data of 96 genome-wide SSR markers in QTL mapping. The isolation and quantification of genomic DNA, pooling of equal concentration DNA to constitute low pod number bulk (LPNB) and high pod number bulk (HPNB), construction and sequencing of pair-end sequencing libraries (100-bp read length) using HiSeq2000 (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) NGS platform and generation of high-quality genomic sequences were performed according to Das et al.44 The BWA with default parameters was used to align and map the high-quality sequence reads onto the reference kabuli genome.46 Subsequently, normalization of the mappable sequence reads based on depth of read coverage among mapping parents and individuals constituting LPNB and HPNB was performed. The high-quality homozygous SNPs (minimum sequence read depth: 10 with SNP base quality =20) between two parental accessions as well as among mapping individuals constituting the LPNB and HPNB were discovered and further structurally and functionally annotated with respect to reference genome as per Kujur et al.12,13A SNP index and <U+0394> (SNP index)-based QTL-seq approach was deployed individually in two mapping populations to scan major PN QTLs in chickpea following the earlier defined recommended parameters.42–45, 47 The <U+0394> (SNP index) was estimated according to subtraction of SNP index (proportion of sequence reads supported the SNPs, which are entirely different from the reference kabuli genome sequences) between LPNB and HPNB. The SNP index was estimated as ‘0’ and ‘1’ based on the representation of genomic fragments derived from Pusa 1103/Pusa 256 and ILWC 46, respectively, in entire high-quality sequence reads generated. A sliding window approach with 1-Mb window size and 10-kb increment was utilized to measure the average distribution of <U+0394> (SNP index) of SNPs physically mapped across eight kabuli chromosomes in a given genomic interval. The SNP index plots were generated for two mapping populations individually by plotting the <U+0394> (SNP index) of LPNB and HPNB and their corresponding SNP index within the specified window size in the graphs. The statistical confidence intervals of <U+0394> (SNP index) with a given sequence read depth under the null hypothesis of no QTLs were calculated to assure the accuracy of QTLs derived from QTL-seq as per Takagi et al.,42 Lu et al.43 and Das et al.442.3. QTL region-specific association analysisThe major genomic regions underlying PN QTLs identified from two mapping populations individually using QTL-seq were compared/correlated to identify the consensus robust QTLs that are well-validated across these diverse populations. One of the selected novel genomic region harbouring robust PN QTL was sequenced in low and high pod number-containing homozygous mapping individuals (constituting LPNB and HPNB in QTL-seq analysis) and parental accessions from each of the two mapping populations using the multiplexed amplicons sequencing protocol (as per manufacturer's instructions) of TruSeq Custom Amplicon v1.5 in Illumina MiSeq next-generation sequencer. The mapping of high-quality amplicon sequence reads onto the reference kabuli genome and detection of high-quality SNPs among parental accessions and mapping individuals was performed as per Saxena et al.9 and Kujur et al.12,48 The SNPs discovered at the sequenced genomic region harbouring robust PN QTL was structurally and functionally annotated following Kujur et al.12,48 The physically mapped SNPs revealing differentiation between high and low pod number-containing parental accessions and individuals of two mapping populations at QTL region of interest were genotyped in the genomic DNA of 92 desi and kabuli chickpea accessions belonging to a PN-specific association panel using Illumina GoldenGate assay as per Saxena et al.9 and Bajaj et al.23 The replicated multi-location/years PN field phenotyping data, population structure (K = 2) statistics, principal component analysis (PCA) and kinship matrix of 92 accessions were obtained from Kujur et al.13 The association analysis was performed by correlating the genotyping information of SNPs at robust PN QTL interval with aforesaid phenotyping and diversity statistics using general linear model (GLM), mixed linear model (MLM at optimum level of compression with P3D method) and mixed model approach of EMMA49 following the methods of Kujur et al.13 and Kumar et al.50 The Bonferroni correction of P-value was used for each trait-associated SNPs at 5% significance level to eliminate the confounding effect of population structure and correct the false discovery rate (FDR) based on multiple comparisons. The informative SNPs-carrying candidate gene associated (R2 = correlation potential of significant SNPs with traits) with PN at significant cut-off P = 10-5 was screened by combining the outcomes of GLM and MLM with EMMA and FDR correction.2.4. Differential gene expression profilingTo infer the gene regulation, differential expression profiling of SNPs-containing gene annotated at the major genomic interval harbouring a novel robust PN QTL (validated by both QTL-seq and QTL region-specific association analysis) was performed. The vegetative (leaf and root) and reproductive (flower bud, ovary, anther and mature pollen) tissues and two-pod (~5 mm beginning pod size at 5–10 days after anthesis/DAA and ~2 cm full pod at 15–20 DAA) developmental stages were collected (at least with three biological replicates) from 40–60 days old healthy plants of low and high pod number-containing homozygous mapping individuals (constituting LPNB and HPNB in QTL-seq analysis) and parental accessions from each of the two mapping populations under study. The RNA isolated from all the tissues/stages of mapping individuals and parents were amplified with desirable gene-specific primers and internal control elongation factor 1-alpha (EF1a) using semi-quantitative and quantitative RT–PCR assays. The differential expression level of gene observed in diverse tissues/developmental stages of high and low pod number-containing mapping individuals and parents was compared/correlated following Bajaj et al.223. Results and discussion3.1. Genetic inheritance pattern of pod number in two inter-specific mapping populationsWe observed a significant difference of PN (5-237) with 13% CV and 81% H2 in 102 individuals and parental accessions of an inter-specific F5 mapping population of Pusa 1103 × ILWC 46 (Table 1). A wider phenotypic variation for PN (5-229) with 14.8% CV and 80% H2 was detected in another 98 individuals and parents of an inter-specific F5 mapping population of Pusa 256 × ILWC 46 (Table 1). The continuous variation as well as normal frequency distribution of PN trait was observed in these two mapping populations, which indicates the quantitative genetic inheritance pattern of target trait under study. The pod number is a complex yield component quantitative trait in chickpea, which is known to be governed by multiple abiotic (drought, heat, cold and salinity) and biotic (pod bores and other diseases) stress factors and often influenced by climate/growing conditions. To overcome these intricacies, present study selectively used three contrasting parental accessions-derived inter-specific mapping populations exhibiting wider phenotypic variability and higher heritability (consistent phenotypic expression) for pod number across geographical locations/years for molecular mapping of major QTLs regulating pod number in chickpea through mQTL-seq. Statistical measures of pod number estimated in parental accessions and individuals of two inter-specific F5 mapping populationsStatistical measures of pod number estimated in parental accessions and individuals of two inter-specific F5 mapping populations3.2. NGS-based whole-genome resequencing for QTL-seqThe NGS-based high-throughput whole-genome resequencing of two high and low pod number-containing parental accessions as well as bulks (LPNB and HPNB) of two inter-specific mapping populations [(Pusa 1103 × ILWC 46) and (Pusa 256 × ILWC 46)] were generated on an average of 81.5 million high-quality sequence reads (ranging from 80.7 to 83.5 million reads) with a ~11.6-fold sequencing depth coverage. Notably, 82.1% (varying from 82.3 to 83.6%) sequence reads of these were mapped (minimum mapping quality: 30) to unique physical locations of kabuli reference genome with a 69% mean coverage. The high-quality uniquely mapped sequence reads generated from parental accessions and bulks (LPNB and HPNB) of two mapping populations were normalized based on depth of read coverage to reduce the potential biasness of read depth in the studied samples. Subsequently, the sequencing depth coverage (fold) and genome coverage (%) of uniquely mapped non-redundant sequence reads in mapping parents and bulks were estimated individually, with the average coverage of ~11.6-fold and 64.1% (474.2 Mb) of kabuli chickpea genome (with an estimated genome size of ~740 Mb), respectively (Supplementary Table S1). The normalized individual sequence reads of mapping parents and bulks were compared with reference kabuli genomic sequences (pseudomolecules and scaffolds) to mine the valid homozygous SNPs for QTL-seq analysis. The sequencing data generated in the present investigation was submitted to NCBI-sequence read archive (SRA) database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) with accession number SRR2228974 under BioProject ID: PRJNA294404 (submission ID: SUB1081829). The comparative assessment on desi and kabuli draft chickpea genome assemblies provided clues regarding high-quality and uniform whole-genome sequence assembly of kabuli, including its large size (Mb) chromosome pseudomolecule and scaffolds than desi chickpea genome.51 Henceforth, kabuli rather than the desi genome sequence was preferably utilized as a reference for whole-genome resequencing-based SNPs mining and QTL-seq analyses in mapping parents and bulks of chickpea.3.3. Discovery and annotation of genome-wide SNPs in a mapping population of Pusa 1103 × ILWC 46The comparative genome sequence data analysis of high (Pusa 1103 and HPNB) and low (ILWC 46 and LPNB) pod number-containing mapping parents and bulks with reference genomic sequence (pseudomolecule) of kabuli accession (CDC Frontier) identified 243,896 and 234,921 high-quality homozygous SNPs (with read depth =10 and SNP base quality =20) (Supplementary Tables S2 and S3, Fig. 2A and B). Of these, 108,170 SNPs irrespective of monomorphic/polymorphic allele types were found to be common between high (Pusa 1103 and HPNB) and low (ILWC 46 and LPNB) pod number-containing mapping parents and bulks based on their congruent physical positions (bp) on the reference kabuli genome (with a mean map density of 4.8 kb) (Table 2, Supplementary Table S4, Fig. 2A). These selected SNPs were further used for QTL-seq analysis. The 54,731 (50.6% of identified 108 170 SNPs) SNPs were physically mapped on eight chromosomes of kabuli genome with a mean map density of 6.3 kb that varied from 4.3 (chromosome 7) to 9.1 (chromosome 6) kb (Table 2, Fig. 2B). At a genome-wide level, the density of physically mapped SNPs was maximum on chromosome 7 (235.1 SNPs/Mb) followed by chromosome 4 (213.2 SNPs/Mb) and minimum on chromosome 6 (109.9 SNPs/Mb), with a mean of 157.6 SNPs/Mb (Supplementary Fig. S1A). The remaining 53,439 (49.4%) SNPs were mapped on the unanchored scaffolds of kabuli genome with an average map density of 3.2 kb (Table 2). All the 243,896 and 234,921 high-quality homozygous SNPs were submitted to NCBI dbSNP (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/snp_viewTable.cgi?handle=NIPGR) with SNP submission (SS) accession numbers (1940124817-1945872952; Supplementary Tables S2 and S3) for unrestricted public access.

The CDS (coding sequences), URR (upstream regulatory region) and DRR (downstream regulatory region) of genes were defined as per the gene annotation of kabuli genome. This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.The structural annotation of SNPs exhibited the occurrence of 84,529 (78.1% of total mined 108,170 SNPs) and 23,641 (21.9%) SNPs in the intergenic and different sequence components of 6,179 genes, respectively (Fig. 2D). A maximum (9,280 SNPs, 39.2%) and minimum (1,948 SNPs, 8.2%) frequency of SNPs were observed in the upstream regulatory regions (URRs) and CDS of genes, respectively (Fig. 2E). Notably, 445 and 706 coding SNPs-containing genes exhibited synonymous (666 SNPs) and non-synonymous (1,282 SNPs) (missense and nonsense) substitutions, respectively (Fig. 2F). The non-synonymous SNPs comprise 1,194 missense and 88 nonsense SNPs in the 625 and 81 genes, respectively. The average frequency of SNPs within genes was estimated as 3.8 SNPs/gene. The functional annotation of 6,179 SNPs-carrying genes revealed correspondence of ~9.6 and 8.4% of SNPs to transcription factors and disease resistance-related proteins, respectively. The numerous informative SNPs differentiating desi (Pusa 1103), kabuli (CDC Frontier) and wild (ILWC 46) accessions, structurally and functionally annotated at a genome-wide scale, can be deployed for multi-dimensional high-throughput genotyping applications in chickpea.3.4. Discovery and annotation of genome-wide SNPs in a mapping population of Pusa 256 × ILWC 46We identified 170,032 and 175,796 high-quality genome-wide homozygous SNPs differentiating the high (Pusa 256 and HPNB) and low (ILWC 46 and LPNB) pod number-containing mapping parents and bulks from reference kabuli accession (CDC Frontier) (Supplementary Table S5 and S6, Fig. 2B and C). Of these, 77,097 SNPs identified to be common between high (Pusa 256 and HPNB) and low (ILWC 46 and LPNB) pod number-containing mapping parents and bulks following the aforesaid criteria were further used in QTL-seq analysis (Supplementary Table S7, Fig. 2C). All these 77,097 SNPs were mapped on the kabuli genome with an average map density of 6.7 kb (Table 2). The 34,713 (45% of identified 770,987 SNPs) SNPs mined were physically mapped on eight chromosomes of kabuli genome with a mean map density of 10 kb that ranged from 6.7 (chromosome 4) to 13.2 (chromosome 5) kb (Table 2, Fig. 2B). At a whole-genome level, the density of physically mapped SNPs was highest on chromosome 4 (149.1 SNPs/Mb) followed by chromosome 1 (116.7 SNPs/Mb) and minimum on chromosome 5 (75.9 SNPs/Mb), with a mean of 99.9 SNPs/Mb (Supplementary Fig. S1B). The rest 42,384 (55%) SNPs were mapped on the unanchored scaffolds of kabuli genome with an average map density of 4.0 kb (Table 2). All these 170,032 and 175,796 high-quality homozygous SNPs were submitted to NCBI dbSNP (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/snp_viewTable.cgi?handle=NIPGR) with SNP submission (SS) accession numbers (1945872954–1947070701, Supplementary Tables S5 and S6) for unrestricted use.The structural annotation of SNPs showed the presence of 62,174 (80.6% of total mined 77,097 SNPs) and 14,923 (19.4%) SNPs in the intergenic and various sequence components of 4,175 genes, respectively (Fig. 2D). The URRs and CDS of genes contained maximum (5,557 SNPs, 37.2%) and minimum (1,467 SNPs, 9.8%) frequency of SNPs, respectively (Fig. 2E). Notably, 319 and 475 coding SNPs-carrying genes revealed synonymous (485 SNPs) and non-synonymous (982 SNPs) substitutions, respectively (Fig. 2F). The non-synonymous SNPs contained 909 missense and 73 nonsense SNPs in the 408 and 67 genes, respectively. The average frequency of SNPs within genes was estimated to be 3.6 SNPs/gene. The functional annotation of 4,175 SNPs-carrying genes exhibited that ~7.3 and 5.3% of SNPs were belonging to transcription factors and disease resistance-related proteins, respectively. These functionally relevant SNPs, discriminating desi (Pusa 256), kabuli (CDC Frontier) and wild (ILWC 46) accessions annotated in diverse sequence components of genome/genes, have tremendous practical utility towards establishing efficient marker-trait association and rapid detection of potential genes/QTLs governing important agronomic traits in chickpea.3.5. Molecular mapping of QTL-seq-derived major PN QTLs in a mapping population of Pusa 1103 × ILWC 46The SNP index of individual SNPs showing differentiation between high (Pusa 1103 and HPNB) and low (ILWC 46 and LPNB) pod number-containing mapping parents and bulks was assessed. We estimated an average SNP index across a 1-Mb genomic interval individually in Pusa 1103 and HPNB as well as ILWC 46 and LPNB using a 10-kb sliding window approach. Further, these SNP indexes were plotted against eight chromosomes of kabuli reference genome. The <U+0394> (SNP index) was measured through combining the SNP index information of HPNB and LPNB, and plotted against the genomic positions (Mb) of kabuli reference genome (Fig. 3A). Two major genomic regions (CaqaPN4.1: 13690423 to 14558233 bp and CaqaPN4.2: 31916540 to 33716608 bp) on chromosome 4 demonstrating the average SNP index of higher than 0.8 in HPNB and lower than 0.2 in LPNB were detected (Fig. 3A) following the SNP index estimation criteria as defined in QTL-seq analysis.42–44 The major genomic regions harbouring PN QTLs identified by QTL-seq were assured by <U+0394> (SNP index) value that is significantly different from 0 at 99% significance level. Our comprehensive analysis of these target genomic regions inferred that high and low pod number-containing mapping individuals constituting the HPNB and LPNB comprised majority of the SNP alleles from high (Pusa 1103) and low (ILWC 46) pod number-containing mapping parental accessions, respectively. Taken together, our findings by QTL-seq in an inter-specific mapping population (Pusa 1103 × ILWC 46) ascertained the presence of two major QTLs (CaqaPN4.1 and CaqaPN4.2) governing PN at the 867.8 Kb [13690423 (SNP_20990A) to 14558233 (SNP_21161A) bp] and 1.80 Mb [31916540 (SNP_27349A) to 33716608 (SNP_28364A) bp] genomic intervals on chromosome 4 of chickpea (Fig. 3A). The SNPs flanking the QTL-seq-derived major PN QTL (CaqaPN4.1 and CaqaPN4.2) were validated in accordance with their expected allelic discrimination by resequencing of PCR amplicons amplified from the parental accessions (Pusa 1103 and ILWC 46) and mapping individuals constituting the HPNB and LPNB.

The Y-axis denotes the SNP indexes that are measured according to 1-Mb physical interval with a 10-kb sliding window.

The estimation of average SNP index (across a 5-Mb genomic interval of a 10-kb sliding window) and <U+0394> (SNP index) of HPNB and LPNB, and their plotting across eight kabuli chromosomes (following aforementioned strategies) identified two major genomic regions (CaqbPN4.1: 13770030 to 14407570 bp and CaqbPN4.2: 31916540 to 33195624 bp) on chromosome 4 exhibiting the average SNP index of higher than 0.9 in HPNB and lower than 0.1 in LPNB (Fig. 3B). The authenticity of these identified major genomic regions harbouring PN QTLs was confirmed by valid significant <U+0394> (SNP index) value (at 99% significance level). The detail analysis of these target genomic regions indicated the presence of most of the SNP alleles from Pusa 256 and ILWC 46 in high and low pod number-containing mapping individuals constituting the HPNB and LPNB, respectively. Collectively, the QTL-seq in an inter-specific mapping population (Pusa 256 × ILWC 46) identified two major QTLs (CaqbPN4.1 and CaqbPN4.2) regulating PN at the 637.5 kb [13770030 (SNP_15561B) to 14407570 (SNP_15696B) bp] and 1.28 Mb [31916540 (SNP_18917B) to 33195624 (SNP_19254B) bp] genomic intervals on chromosome 4 of chickpea (Fig. 3B). The SNPs flanking the QTL-seq-derived major PN QTL (CaqbPN4.1 and CaqbPN4.2) were validated according to their expected allelic discrimination by resequencing of PCR amplicons amplified from the parental accessions (Pusa 256 and ILWC 46) and mapping individuals constituting the HPNB and LPNB.3.7. QTL region-specific trait association mappingThe four major genomic regions underlying PN QTLs (CaqaPN4.1, CaqaPN4.2, CaqbPN4.1 and CaqbPN4.2) detected in two mapping populations of Pusa 1103 × ILWC 46 and Pusa 256 × ILWC 46 using QTL-seq were compared and correlated (Fig. 4A and B). This led to identification of two consensus major genomic regions with short physical intervals of 637.5 kb [CaqbPN4.1: 13770030 (SNP_15561B) to 14407570 (SNP_15696B) bp] and 1.28 Mb [CaqbPN4.2: 31916540 (SNP_18917B) to 33195624 (SNP_19254B) bp] on chromosome 4 harbouring PN QTLs (Fig. 4A and B). These QTLs, being well-validated across two diverse chickpea mapping populations under study, were considered as robust QTLs. The scale-down of longer major PN QTL intervals identified by QTL-seq in individual mapping population into shorter QTL regions by mQTL-seq implicates the significance of mQTL-seq over QTL-seq approach for high-resolution molecular mapping along with fine mapping of major potential genomic regions underlying robust trait-regulatory QTLs in chickpea. Based on congruent physical position, one of the robust QTL (CaqbPN4.1) of these exhibited correspondence with a priorly identified known major QTL regulating pod number/plant was mapped on an intra-specific genetic linkage map of chickpea (Fig. 4A and B).41 The remaining one robust PN QTL (CaqbPN4.2) was considered to be novel (not previously identified) and thus selected by us to delineate potential candidate gene-regulating pod number through QTL region-specific high-resolution trait association mapping. A wider practical applicability of mQTL-seq strategy for rapid detection of major as well as robust high-resolution PN QTLs using two F5 inter-specific chickpea mapping populations (with at least one common parental accession) was evident. More recently, such QTL-seq approach has been deployed in multiple mapping populations for scanning the major QTLs controlling fruit weight and locule number in tomato.45 Collectively, this suggests the accuracy and robustness of mQTL-seq as an approach for rapid delineation of high-resolution major QTLs governing traits of agronomic importance at a genome-wide scale in chickpea. The integration of <U+0394> (SNP index)-based QTL-seq-derived four pod number major QTLs in two mapping populations [A: (Pusa 1103 × ILWC 46) and B: (Pusa 256 × ILWC 46)] narrowed down one novel major genomic region harbouring a robust pod number QTL (CaqbPN4.2) into 1.28 Mb sequence interval [between flanking SNP (SNP_18917B and SNP_19254B) markers] indicated by green font on kabuli chickpea chromosome 4. This QTL region was subsequently scaled down into the regulatory (C/T) and coding (C/A) SNPs-containing one candidate PPR (pentatricopeptide repeat) gene associated strongly with pod number by combining mQTL-seq with QTL region-specific association analysis (C). *Known pod number QTLs (CaqaPN4.1 and CaqbPN4.1) documented previously by Varshney et al.41 The details regarding SNPs flanking/localized at the major PN QTLs and SNPs in a PPR gene associated with PN are mentioned in the Supplementary Tables S4 and S7.

This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.The targeted resequencing of this 1.28 Mb delineated novel CaqbPN4.2 robust QTL region in high and low pod number-containing mapping parents (Pusa 1103 × ILWC 46) and bulks (HPNB and LPNB) detected 2,913 high-quality SNPs with an average SNP density of 1/439.4 bp. This contained 1,543 intergenic SNPs and 1,370 SNPs derived from the coding and non-coding sequence components of 448 genes. For QTL region-specific trait association analysis, the genotyping information of 2,913 SNPs mined and mapped on a 1.28 Mb (CaqbPN4.2) novel QTL region was correlated with PN field phenotyping data (PN: 21.9–204.5 with 33% CV and 70% H2) and diversity statistics (population structure, PCA, kinship) of 92 desi and kabuli chickpea accessions (PN-specific association panel). The comprehensive association analysis by effective integration of GLM and MLM outcomes with EMMA and FDR based on multiple-comparisons detected two SNPs (SNP_1 at 32636428 bp: C/A and SNP_19172B at 32640058 bp: C/T) in the CDS and URR of a pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein-coding gene revealing strong association (P: 1.5–2.0 × 10-7 and R2 = 25–28%) with PN in chickpea (Fig. 4B and C). This is further ascertained by identification of similar PPR gene-derived regulatory SNP (SNP_19172B at 32640058 bp: C/T) with high <U+0394> (SNP index) (0.8) at CaqbPN4.2 QTL region governing pod number based on our mQTL-seq analysis in two inter-specific mapping populations of chickpea (Fig. 3A and B). Therefore, this strong PN-associated PPR gene localized at a major PN novel QTL interval (CaqbPN4.2) was selected as one of the potential candidate for understanding its efficacy in pod number regulation through differential expression profiling.3.8. Validation of a PN-associated PPR gene through differential expression profilingOne strong PN-associated regulatory and coding SNPs-containing PPR gene delineated at 1.28 Mb major genomic region harbouring a novel CaqbPN4.2 robust QTL (validated by both mQTL-seq- and QTL region-specific association analysis) was selected for differential expression profiling. The primer-pair designed targeting this gene was used for amplification with the RNA isolated from the vegetative (leaf and root) and reproductive (flower bud, ovary, anther and mature pollen) tissues and two pod (~5 mm beginning pod size at 5–10 days after anthesis/DAA and ~2 cm full pod at 15–20 DAA) developmental stages of low and high pod number-containing homozygous mapping individuals (used in QTL-seq analysis) and parental accessions of two mapping populations using semi-quantitative and quantitative RT–PCR assays. A strong PN-associated PPR gene revealed tissue-specific expression in the anthers, mature pollens and pods of parental accessions and mapping individuals compared with their respective vegetative (leaf and root) and reproductive (flower bud and ovary) tissues (Fig. 5). This gene also exhibited pronounced differential up-regulation (~6.7-folds, P = 10-3) in anther, mature pollen and two pod developmental stages (compared with vegetative tissues) of all high and low pod number-containing parental accessions and individuals of two mapping populations under study (Fig. 5). Interestingly, a significant higher (~3.5-fold, P = 10-3) differential up-regulation of PPR gene in anther, mature pollen and pod developmental stages of high pod number-containing parental accessions and mapping individuals compared with low pod number-containing parental accessions and mapping individuals was evident (Fig. 5). Differential expression profiles of one PPR gene delineated at a novel 1.28 Mb major genomic region underlying the robust pod number QTL (CaqbPN4.2) (detected by integrating mQTL-seq with QTL region-specific association analysis) in diverse vegetative (leaf and root) and reproductive (flower bud, ovary, anther and mature pollen) tissues and two pod developmental stages of low and high pod number-containing parental accessions and homozygous individuals of two mapping populations [(Pusa 1103 × ILWC 46) and (Pusa 256 × ILWC 46)]. The average log signal expression value of PPR gene in various tissues and developmental stages was specified at the top with a colour scale; in which green, black and red colours represent low, medium and high level of expression, respectively. The tissues/stages as well as homozygous mapping individuals and parental accessions utilized for expression profiling are indicated on the top and right sides of expression map, respectively. An endogenous control elongation factor-1 alpha was used in quantitative RT–PCR assay for normalization of the expression value across different tissues/developmental stages of parents and mapping individuals. HPNB: high pod number bulk and LPNB: low pod number bulk. Pod I: Pod development stage 1 (~5 mm beginning pod size at 5–10 days after anthesis/DAA) and Pod II: Pod development stage 2 (~2 cm full pod at 15–20 DAA).

The efficacy of the combinatorial approach integrating genetic and association mapping with expression profiling to scale down potential candidate gene and alleles at a major QTL region governing diverse agronomic traits, including seed weight and pod/seed number is well established in chickpea.9–13, 22,23 A pod number-regulating PPR gene identified in our study, showing >80% sequence conservation with Arabidopsis gene orthologue (At1g52620), is reportedly involved in controlling growth and development-related traits (pollination and embryogenesis) in multiple crop plants, including Arabidopsis and Phaseolus.52,53 Specifically, PPR gene family proteins have definite functional role in regulating proper pollen development by higher accumulation of transcripts in the mature pollen and efficient nuclear-organelle interactions to produce higher fertile seeds (embryogenesis) and pods in diverse plant species.54–62 Accordingly, we observed a higher expression of PPR gene transcripts in the mature pollen and two pod developmental stages of high pod number-containing parental accessions and homozygous mapping individuals vis-a-vis low pod number accessions and mapping individuals in chickpea. However, a detail molecular characterization and functional validation of this gene is essential to decipher its regulation specifically during pollen and pod development causing high pod number in chickpea. The PPR gene once validated in a large scale could be deployed for genomics-assisted crop improvement to develop genetically tailored varieties with higher pod/seed number and yield in chickpea.FundingFunding to pay the Open Access publication charges for this article was provided by the National Institute of Plant Genome Research (NIPGR).The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support for this study provided by a research grant from the Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Government of India (102/IFD/SAN/2161/2013-14).

Many S. pastorianus strains have been isolated and classified into two groups according to geographical origin, but this classification remains controversial. Hybridization analyses and partial PCR-based sequence data have indicated a separate origin of these two groups, whereas a recent intertranslocation analysis suggested a single origin. To clarify the evolutionary history of this species, we analysed 10 S. pastorianus strains and the S. eubayanus type strain as a likely parent by Illumina next-generation sequencing. In addition to assembling the genomes of five of the strains, we obtained information on interchromosomal translocation, ploidy, and single-nucleotide variants (SNVs). Collectively, these results indicated that the two groups of strains share S. cerevisiae haploid chromosomes. We therefore conclude that both groups of S. pastorianus strains share at least one interspecific hybridization event and originated from a common parental species and that differences in ploidy and SNVs between the groups can be explained by chromosomal deletion or loss of heterozygosity.1. IntroductionBottom-fermenting strains of brewing yeast—also known as lager beer yeast—represent a large portion of the beer market and have therefore been the focus of mycological research for centuries. Lager beer yeasts have been taxonomically classified as Saccharomyces pastorianus since the 19th century and are classified into two groups according to geographical origin: the Saaz type (Group 1) originally used in Bohemia and the Frohberg type (Group 2) in Germany.1,2Many pure strains have since been identified, including the type strains S. monacensis (CBS1503; Group 1), S. carlsbergensis (CBS1513; Group 1), and S. pastorianus (CBS1538; Group 1) as well as Weihenstephan 34/70 (Group 2), a widely used industrial strain. Saccharomyces pastorianus is an allopolyploid hybrid of two Saccharomyces species: the ale beer yeast S. cerevisiae and a hypothesized novel species similar to S. bayanus. In 2011, S. eubayanus3 was discovered on southern beech trees in Patagonia, South America, and identified as the absent parental species of lager beer yeast. Saccharomyces eubayanus has also recently been identified on trees in Tibet, Far East Asia, spurring a debate about the precise origin of this species.4Genomic analysis techniques, such as array comparative genome hybridization (array-CGH), have identified a difference in ploidy between the two groups of S. pastorianus strains. Group 1 (Saaz type) strains are approximately haploid for the S. cerevisiae genome, whereas Group 2 (Frohberg type) strains are diploid for the S. cerevisiae genome.5 A Sanger sequencing-based genome sequence analysis of S. pastorianus Weihenstephan 34/706 conducted by our group revealed various genetic features, such as whole-genome structure and genomic divergence, at the single-nucleotide level. The genomes of many interspecies hybrid strains have also been sequenced, including the osmotolerant yeast species Pichia sorbitolphila,7 the Zygosaccharomyces bailii hybrid strain ISA1307,8 and the wine yeast strain VIN7.9 As in our previous study of S. pastorianus,6 most analyses of allopolyploid species genomes have been performed without the genome sequence of one or both parental species. For example, in the case of P. sorbitolphila,7 neither parental species has been isolated; its sequence data are divided into two types based on the GC content of the expected parental species. The lack of information on one or both parental genomes has complicated downstream genomic analyses. Complete (or near-complete) genomes of parental species can provide more information on genomic variation in interspecies hybrids and facilitate the identification of translocation breakpoints between interparental homologous chromosomes at the single-nucleotide level, genome rearrangements, and differences in ploidy.In S. pastorianus, ploidy differences, copy number variations, and single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) identified by array-CGH10,11 or other approaches have suggested that the Saaz (Group 1) and Frohberg (Group 2) types originated from independent hybridization events,11–13 a theory that has gained broad acceptance. In contrast, the recent confirmation of two breakpoints associated with interchromosomal translocation of HSP82 and KEM1 genes implies a common origin.5 Therefore, the evolutionary history of S. pastorianus remains controversial, primarily because of the lack of reference genome information for S. eubayanus. For example, array-CGH analysis was performed based on the S. cerevisiae S288C and S. uvarum CBS7001 genomes,11 which are similar to non-Sc type S. pastorianus, but it was not possible to estimate differences in ploidy or sequence variations between S. pastorianus strains from the results.In the present study, we obtained the whole-genome sequences of 10 S. pastorianus strains by Illumina next-generation sequencing (NGS) to gain insight into the evolutionary history of this species. The strains included five strains each from Groups 1 and 2, including three type strains [S. monacensis (CBS1503), S. carlsbergensis (CBS1513), and S. pastorianus (CBS1538)] and S. pastorianus Weihenstephan 34/70 (W34/70), which we sequenced previously by the Sanger method.6 NGS technology enables more accurate sequencing and produces longer continuous genome sequences. In addition to paired-end sequences, long insert mate-pair libraries were also obtained for the three type strains and W34/70 and were applied to de novo assemblies to obtain overall genomic structures, which were then compared. However, as in the case of previous studies of interspecies hybrid strains,7–9 a more detailed analysis of ploidy and evolutionary relationships based on sequence differences from the assembled sequences was difficult. To precisely determine the sequence differences between strains, we adopted mapping-based analysis using the two parent genomes as reference sequences, including the available S. cerevisiae (Sc) (S288C) genome. Because a reference sequence was not available for S. eubayanus (Se), we assembled the draft genome sequence of S. eubayanus CBS12357 using NGS data. These two reference genomes were used for mapping-based genome comparisons among the 10 S. pastorianus strains that considered the relatively high heterozygosity of S. pastorianus. Here, heterozygosity refers to the sequence difference between intrahomologous (Sc/Sc or Se/Se) chromosomes; loss of heterozygosity (LOH) refers to the loss of heterogeneity between intrahomologous chromosomes. The results provide information on ploidy, novel chromosomal translocations, mitochondrial (mt)DNA sequences, and the phylogenetic relationships among Sc and Se types that provides new insights into the origin and evolutionary history of S. pastorianus.2. Materials and methods2.1. Strain and sequence informationThe following strains were used in this study: S. pastorianus CBS1503 (S. monacensis type strain), CBS1513 (S. carlsbergensis type strain), CBS1538 (S. pastorianus type strain), CBS1174, CBS2440, Weihenstephan 34/70 (W34/70), CBS1483, CBS1484, CBS2156, and CBS5832; S. eubayanus CBS12357 (type strain) and BaiFY1; S. bayanus NBRC1948 and CBS380; and S. cerevisiae S288C. Saccharomyces pastorianus Weihenstephan 34/70 was provided by Fachhochschule Weihenstephan (Freising, Germany); the other strains, except S. eubayanus BaiFY1, were obtained from the CBS-KNAW Culture Collection Center (Utrecht, The Netherland). Sequence data for S. eubayanus BaiFY1 were downloaded from the Sequence Read Archive, NCBI.2.2. Genome sequencing and assemblyWe prepared paired-end sequencing data with the Illumina platform (Hayward, CA, USA) for 14 strains of three species: S. pastorianus Group 1 (CBS1503, CBS1513, CBS1538, CBS1174, and CBS2440) and Group 2 (W34/70, CBS1483, CBS1484, CBS2156, and CBS5832); S. eubayanus (CBS12357 and BaiFY1); and S. bayanus (NBRC1948 and CBS380). With the exception of S. eubayanus BaiFY1, all sequence data were determined in this study by Illumina Miseq. Saccharomyces bayanus sequences were used only for mtDNA analysis. Libraries (insert size = 600 bp) were prepared using the TruSeq PCR-free DNA Sample Prep kit (Illumina) with a read length of 300 bp. Other sequence data for S. eubayanus BaiFY1 obtained from the Hiseq2000 platform with 151-bp paired-end libraries were available from the Sequence Read Archive (accession no. SRX646335). For de novo assembly, mate-pair libraries for CBS1503, CBS1513, CBS1538, W34/70, and CBS12357 were prepared using the Nextera Mate Pair Sample Prep kit (Illumina) and 3,000- to 15,000-bp fragments extracted from an agarose gel for each sample. All libraries were also sequenced using Illumina Miseq. Low-quality regions and adaptor sequences in the reads were trimmed with Platanus_trim v.1.0.7 for subsequent analyses.The genomes of five strains sequenced from the paired-end and mate-pair libraries were assembled using Platanus v.1.2.4 software.14 Contig assembly was performed using only paired-end libraries, and scaffolding and gap closing were performed using both libraries. Prior to scaffolding, mate-pair reads were mapped on contigs using the BWA program15 to remove duplicate reads generated during PCR amplification. Contig assembly for interspecies hybrid strains (CBS1503, CBS1513, CBS1538, and W34/70) was conducted with parameter -n 15 (for W34/70) or 20 (for other strains), and scaffolding was performed with parameter -u 0 to avoid removing low-coverage scaffolds derived from haploid chromosomes. The results of the assembly were evaluated by confirming the physical coverage of 6-kb mate-pair reads. Finally, contamination and mtDNA sequences were removed from scaffolds =500 bp by alignment with NCBI Bacteria DB, RefSeq viral DB, and BLASTN16 for mtDNA sequences (minimum identity = 90% and minimum query coverage = 50%). The assembly of mitochondrial genomes is described below. CBS12357 was assembled using Platanus v.1.2.4 with default settings.To construct a CBS12357 draft genome for hybrid strains in subsequent analyses, scaffolds were aligned with the S. cerevisiae S288C complete genome sequence using BLASTN. Only one locus, covering the rDNA region in chromosome XII, was connected by N-runs sequences manually, and two known interchromosomal translocations6,17 (namely, II–IV and VIII–XV) that were structurally distinct from S288C were not divided and maintained. Finally, we obtained super-scaffolds that were adequate to call chromosome-level reference sequences. To estimate the genome size of the hybrid strains, paired-end reads were mapped to the parental species' genomes (S288C complete and CBS12357 draft genomes) and to the mtDNA of each strain, and the length of regions covering =10 reads was calculated.2.3. Detection of interchromosomal translocations in hybrid strainsInterchromosomal translocations between Sc and Se types were detected based on mate-pair reads, which were mapped to the reference (S. cerevisiae S288C complete and S. eubayanus CBS12357 draft) genomes using BWA after removing low-identity and multihit reads. Chromosomes were divided into 10,000-bp blocks, and the number of mate-pair reads linking the blocks was tabulated. Links consisting of =100 pairs between Sc- and Se-type blocks were displayed in a circus plot.18 To reveal breakpoints at the nucleotide level, local assembly was performed using paired-end reads; when one of these was mapped near a breakpoint (as estimated by the procedure described above) and the opposite side was not mapped, the read corresponding to the latter was identified as a candidate covering the breakpoint region. These reads were collected and assembled.2.4. Estimation of ploidy in hybrid strainsSequence coverage for the 10 S. pastorianus strains was calculated based on the number of reads mapped to the two parental species [S. cerevisiae (S288C) and S. eubayanus (CBS12357)] to confirm the accuracy of the total assembly size and estimate the ploidy of each chromosome. Sequence reads were mapped to the reference genomes using BWA. Mapped reads with <90% identity or with multiple hits were removed. Following realignment using GATK realigner,19 sequence coverage at each locus was calculated using SAMtools mpileup.20 Ploidy was estimated as the ratio of the sequence coverage of the focus region to the haploid coverage obtained from the whole-genome coverage distribution. The moving average of the calculated ploidy (window size = 10,000 bp and step size = 1,000 bp) was then plotted.2.5. SNV calling in 10 S. pastorianus strainsMapping of paired-end reads and filtering were conducted as described above, and SNV calling was performed using SAMtools mpileup and an original Perl script that calculated the number of mapped reads, their strands, variants, and allele frequencies (AFs; i.e. the ratio of reads supporting the variant to mapped reads at the locus) from the mpileup format. SNVs were identified according to the following criteria: =20 reads were mapped to the locus; variants were supported by two or more mapped reads on both the forward and reverse strands; and insertion/deletion (InDel) mutations were excluded. SNVs were classified as either homo (0.8 = AF) or hetero (0.2 = AF < 0.8) type.2.6. Phylogenetic analysisPhylogenetic analysis of the 10 S. pastorianus strains and 2 parental species was performed based on SNV sites for which =20 reads were mapped in all strains, excluding InDel mutations. Analyses were conducted separately for Sc and Se types to identify differences between the types. Heterozygous sites were also considered, and each allele at each SNV site was treated separately. Phylogenetic estimates were calculated by the maximum likelihood approach using phyml (-b 1,000),21 and phylogenetic trees were generated using FigTree (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/).2.7. Assignment of hetero-SNVs and haplotype phasingTo build two intrahomologous chromosomes from the diploid Sc-type chromosomes in Group 2 strains, the linkage relationships of adjacent hetero-SNVs were solved by pair reads mapped on a region bearing two or more hetero-SNVs. Regions in which pair reads solved the linkage relationships of consecutive adjacent hetero-SNVs were divided into two lines corresponding to chromosomal haplotypes and were defined as continuous haplotype-phased blocks. Blocks were divided by unphased (mainly caused by long no-hetero-SNVs) regions. W34/70 sequence reads were used in this analysis for the following reasons: the Sc-type genome of W34/70 has the highest heterozygosity among the five Group 2 strains; and mate-pair data (insert size 3 and 6 kb) were available. A Group 1 consensus sequence was constructed based on the major alleles in the five Group 1 strains. If the major allele was undefined at a locus, the locus was removed from comparison with W34/70 haplotypes.2.8. Phylogenetic analysis based on haplotype-phased chromosomal SNVsThe identities between each haplotype W34/70 sequence and Group 1 consensus sequences were calculated at each block. The W34/70 haplotyped chromosomes with higher homology to Group 1 were labelled as ‘W34/70_a’, and the others were labelled as ‘W34/70_b’. Finally, the identities between Group 1 vs. W34/70_a and Group 1 vs. W34/70_b were aggregated. For comparison, W34/70 artificial intrahomologous chromosomes were virtually constructed by randomly shuffling allele nucleotides and ignoring linkage information at every locus. The obtained artificial chromosomes were divided into two groups, W34/70_a and W34/70_b, according to the same methods for real intrahomologous chromosomes. This ‘shuffling test’ was repeated 100 times, and the average was calculated.2.9. Assembly and phylogenetic analysis of mtDNAMtDNA assembly and phylogenetic analysis were performed for nine strains of four species, i.e. S. cerevisiae (S288C), S. pastorianus (CBS1503, CBS1513, CBS1538, and W34/70), S. eubayanus (CBS12357 and BaiFY1), and S. bayanus (NBRC1948 and CBS380). MtDNA sequences (with the exception of S288C) were assembled using only high-frequency k-mers (i.e. >2-fold higher than the average k-mer frequency value obtained from sequence reads) because the copy number of mitochondria was much higher than that of chromosomes. After gap closing, scaffolds were aligned to S. cerevisiae S288C mtDNA using BLASTN and assembled with paired-end reads that were mapped to the edges of the scaffold to generate a circle.The mtDNA of each strain was aligned with the open reading frames (ORFs) of S. cerevisiae S288C mtDNA using BLASTX to identify the ORFs of each strain. Multiple alignment with the ORFs was performed using ClustalW2. Phylogenetic estimates using the maximum likelihood method were obtained with phyml (-b 1,000), and a phylogenetic tree was generated using FigTree.3. Results and discussion3.1. Genome sequencingThe sequence sizes of each strain and library are presented in Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1; 32-mer frequency distributions were calculated from the sequence reads of five strains each of S. pastorianus Groups 1 and 2 and of S. eubayanus CBS12357 (Fig. 1A–C). In haploid or low-heterozygosity diploid cases, the k-mer frequency distribution exhibited a single peak at the average sequence frequency, as observed for S. eubayanus CBS12357 (Fig. 1C). In contrast, most of the 32-mer distributions for S. pastorianus strains had two or more peaks (Fig. 1A and B), which may have resulted from the aneuploidy of hybrid strains. Based on the previous array-CGH-based analysis,11 Group 1 strains are mainly derived from haploid S. cerevisiae and diploid S. eubayanus, and the left and right peaks in the double peak correspond to sequences originating from these two species, respectively. However, the presence of three or more peaks implies that some chromosomal regions are triploid or polyploid for parental strain chromosomes. Similarly, Group 2 strains are considered to be mainly from diploid S. cerevisiae and diploid S. eubayanus, yet the 32-mer distribution did not exhibit a pure single peak and, indeed, displayed double peaks in some strains (CBS1483) or low peaks resembling shoulders occurring at approximately half the frequency of the highest peak (W34/70, CBS1484, and CBS5832). This irregular distribution may have been due to heterozygosity in addition to polyploidy. The existence of SNVs between homologous chromosomes creates different 32-mers derived from each haplotype, and highly heterozygous genomes cause significant peaks at half the frequency of diploid peaks. The 32-mer distribution graph confirmed that S. pastorianus strains exhibit complex polyploidy or heterozygosity. The left-most peaks derived from the haploid genome range from 30 to 70, suggesting that the number of sequence reads for the hybrid strains was adequate. The total sequence size of the Illumina paired-end reads for S. eubayanus CBS12357 was 1.4 Gb with an estimated genome coverage of 120-fold, whereas that of the mate-pair reads was 2.8 Gb, with insert sizes of 3–15 kb.

Genome assemblyThe assembly statistics for S. pastorianus CBS1503, CBS1513, CBS1538, and W34/70 and S. eubayanus CBS12357 are presented in Table 2 and were, in general, very robust. For example, all N50 lengths exceeded 400 kb, and except in CBS1538, the longest scaffold lengths exceeded 1 Mb, comparable to the length of the longest chromosome of S. cerevisiae S288C (chromosome IV, 1.5 Mb). We previously reported an N50 length of 108 kb for W34/70,6 only approximately one-seventh of the value observed here. In particular, the assembly for S. eubayanus CBS12357 yielded 17 scaffolds >5,000 bp, one more than the chromosome number of 16. The S. eubayanus CBS12357 chromosome corresponding to chromosome XII of S. cerevisiae S288C was divided into two scaffolds that overlapped the rDNA region and were connected by ‘N run 5000 bp’. We ultimately obtained 16 super-scaffolds with a total genome size of 11.7 Mb—slightly smaller than that of S288C—with 30 gaps totalling 22,137 bp. Based on the total size of the scaffolds, the number of scaffolds, and the small number of gaps, the S. eubayanus CBS12357 draft genome was deemed adequate for use as a reference genome. Assembly statistics for five strains of two speciesAssembly statistics for five strains of two speciesThe assembly statistics revealed some interesting features. The total sequence size of the Group 2 W34/70 strain (22.5 Mb) was nearly equal to the sum of the S. cerevisiae S288C and S. eubayanus CBS12357 genome sizes (12.1 and 11.7 Mb, respectively). In contrast, the genome sizes of Group 1 strains—which ranged from 14.4 to 19.2 Mb—were much smaller than this value, suggesting partial or complete chromosomal deletion. Additionally, although the four S. pastorianus strains exhibited robust statistics (e.g. N50 and maximum scaffold length), the scaffold numbers were much higher than those of S. eubayanus CBS12357. Large N50 values and the considerable number of scaffolds suggest the existence of many short scaffolds, potentially due to the complexity of chromosome structure. During interchromosomal translocation, a homologous diploid or triploid chromosome may translocate to another interparental chromosome, leaving behind the remaining one or two homologous chromosomes. A junctional structure would then be present in the chromosome, and assembly results would be divided. Interchromosomal translocations have been reported,5,6,2,2 and this scenario is also supported by the unusual 32-mer distribution (Fig. 1). These complex chromosome structures may not be resolved by the assembly method; in the following sections, we describe our investigation of translocation structure performed by mapping mate-pair reads and the elucidation of ploidy distribution by mapping paired-end reads.3.3. Estimation of ploidy in S. pastorianus strainsThe ploidy of the 10 S. pastorianus strains was estimated based on the sequence coverage of paired-end reads mapped onto the genomes of the parental species (Fig. 2). Clear differences in ploidy between Groups 1 and 2 were observed. In the former, the Sc-type genome was haploid in most cases, and partial or complete chromosomal deletions were frequently observed; chromosomes I, IX, X, and the left arm of VII were present in these strains, and deletions of the right arm of chromosome IV, left arm of XIII, and the entire chromosome XII were common. Most Sc-type chromosomes in Group 1 were haploid or missing, whereas most Se-type chromosomes were diploid or triploid. In contrast, Group 2 Sc-type chromosomes were always haploid or diploid, whereas Se-type chromosomes ranged from haploid to triploid. Each parental type appeared aneuploid in each strain, but the sum of interhomologous chromosomes (between Sc- and Se-type) was approximately identical. Specifically, five strains in Group 1 and CBS2156 were basically triploid, and those in Group 2—except for CBS2156—were tetraploid. Despite the chromosomal deletion trails that were observed, a mechanism for maintaining a constant total number of intra- and interparental homologous chromosomes appears to exist in Sc and Se types. The differences in ploidy between the two groups provide additional evidence that both groups originated independently from the same parental species. Ploidy distribution in S. pastorianus based on sequence coverage mapped onto parental genomes for (A) Group 1 and (B) Group 2 strains. The blue and orange dots indicate the ploidy of Sc- (left) and Se- (right) type chromosomes, respectively. The vertical axis represents the estimated ploidy, which was calculated as the ratio of sequence coverage at each locus to the estimated haploid coverage; the horizontal axis represents chromosomal loci. In general, Group 1 strains had triploid genomes (haploid or non-Sc type, and diploid or triploid Se type), whereas Group 2 strains were tetraploid (haploid to triploid Sc and Se types).

Interchromosomal translocations between Sc- and Se-type genomesInterchromosomal translocations were detected by mate-pair reads in CBS1503, CBS1513, CBS1538, and W34/70 (Fig. 3). Previous studies have detected 11, 9, and 8 Sc-/Se-type translocations in CBS1503,5 CBS1513,5,2,2 and W34/70,6 respectively, and these translocations were verified by PCR amplification prior to the start of our study. Our analysis confirmed these known translocations in the three strains, demonstrating that this method is capable of detecting these events. Moreover, two translocations present at the HSP825,2,2 and KEM1 loci5 were also confirmed in the other six S. pastorianus strains using paired-end sequences (Supplementary Fig. S1). The two breakpoints were completely matched at the nucleotide level among all Group 1 and 2 strains, with the exception of a chromosomal deletion (HSP82 of CBS1538 and CBS1174). Novel interchromosomal translocations were also detected by our study—one each in CBS1503, CBS1513, and CBS1538 and two in W34/70. One of the novel translocations common to the four strains was further investigated by paired-end sequence alignment, revealing that all 10 S. pastorianus strains share a breakpoint within ZUO1 (Supplementary Fig. S2). The remaining translocation present in W34/70 spans from Sc-type chromosome VIII PRP8 to Se-type chromosome XV–VIII (Supplementary Fig. S3). Interchromosomal translocations between Sc- and Se-type genomes. The circular layouts show interchromosomal translocations between Sc and Se types detected by mate-pair links in Group 1 (CBS15103, CBS1513, and CBS1538) and Group 2 (W34/70) strains. Blue and orange bars represent Sc-type (left) and Se-type (right) chromosomes, respectively. The grey histograms within the circles represent sequence coverage, and regions without bars indicate chromosomal deletions. Grey intersecting lines indicate interchromosomal translocations supported by mate-pair reads bridging the Sc and Se types. Green lines indicate translocations shared by the two groups. Three interchromosomal translocations were common to both groups. The line thickness is proportional to the number of links supported by mate-pair reads.

SNV analysis against reference genomes and their chromosomal distributionThe SNVs were analysed using the S. cerevisiae S288C complete and S. eubayanus CBS12357 draft genomes (Sc and Se types, respectively) as references and classified as homo- and hetero-SNVs (Table 3). The number of homo-SNVs was similar among the strains, and the homo-SNVs were present at a density of 1/200 bp in both the Sc and Se types, indicating that the reference genomes of both species were sufficiently similar to be used for mapping-based analysis. For the Sc-type, SNVs were less prevalent in Group 1 than in Group 2; however, this did not reflect a lower SNV density because many Group 1 Sc chromosomes were missing. In contrast, the number of hetero-Sc-type SNVs in Group 2 was markedly increased compared with Se-type SNVs, along with a 10-fold higher density. In Group 1, fewer hetero-SNVs were present because most Sc-type chromosomes were haploid or missing in this group. Number of SNVs in 10 S. pastorianus strainsNumber of SNVs in 10 S. pastorianus strainsThe higher proportion of hetero-SNVs in Sc-type genomes in Group 2 compared with Se-type genomes suggests that the high heterozygosity in the former originated from an ancestral ale beer yeast.2,3 Indeed, ale beer strains—for instance, FostersB and FostersO—reportedly have high numbers of hetero-SNVs (up to 37,784 and 32,600, respectively). In comparison, lager beer yeast Sc-type genomes exhibit low heterozygosity but an uneven distribution of hetero-SNVs along Sc-type chromosomes, with some regions exhibiting many and others few or no hetero-SNVs (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. S4). An even distribution of hetero-SNVs has been reported for the S. cerevisiae sake yeast strain Kyokai no. 72,4 and the industrial fuel-ethanol fermentative strain CAT-1,2,5 presumably as the result of frequent LOH. Distribution of hetero-SNVs in Sc-type chromosomes IV and VIII of Group 2 strains. The distribution of heterozygosity along Sc-type chromosomes IV and VIII in five Group 2 strains (CBS1483, CBS1484, CBS2156, CBS5832, and W34/70 from top to bottom for each chromosome) was determined by calculating a moving average of SNV density (window size = 10 kb and step size = 1 kb). Hetero-SNVs were unevenly distributed, possibly due to LOH. In many regions, low/no heterozygosity was observed in the five strains, whereas in other regions, the distribution pattern of low/no heterozygosity regions differed between strains. LOH was therefore considered a relatively frequent event, with shared low/no heterozygosity regions likely shaped in the common ancestor or by overlapping LOH events. This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.Distribution of hetero-SNVs in Sc-type chromosomes IV and VIII of Group 2 strains. The distribution of heterozygosity along Sc-type chromosomes IV and VIII in five Group 2 strains (CBS1483, CBS1484, CBS2156, CBS5832, and W34/70 from top to bottom for each chromosome) was determined by calculating a moving average of SNV density (window size = 10 kb and step size = 1 kb). Hetero-SNVs were unevenly distributed, possibly due to LOH. In many regions, low/no heterozygosity was observed in the five strains, whereas in other regions, the distribution pattern of low/no heterozygosity regions differed between strains. LOH was therefore considered a relatively frequent event, with shared low/no heterozygosity regions likely shaped in the common ancestor or by overlapping LOH events. This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.Based on these observations and previous reports, the uneven distribution of heterozygosity may be due to the loss of variation between intrahomologous chromosomes. After a hybridization event between S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus, variations between intrahomologous chromosomes in Sc types are thought to have gradually disappeared via LOH. Regions of high hetero-SNV density likely originated from the ancestral ale beer yeast, whereas low-density regions or those with no hetero-SNVs are likely the imprint of LOH. Low/no heterozygosity was observed in various regions in all five Group 2 strains, albeit with different distribution patterns. Therefore, LOH is presumed to have been a relatively frequent event, with low/no heterozygosity regions arising in the common ancestor or as a result of overlapping LOH events.3.6. Phylogenetic analysis based on chromosomal SNVs against reference genomesPhylogenetic trees based on SNVs in chromosomes queried against reference genomes were constructed separately for the Sc and Se types (Fig. 5). In the Sc-type tree, the strains were segregated into two clades, Groups 1 and 2, in agreement with previous studies11,12 based on partial PCR-based sequence data. In contrast, the Se-type phylogenetic tree revealed that S. pastorianus strains were mixed in nearly a single clade, with no significant phylogenetic difference between Groups 1 and 2. Indeed, the Se-type variant rate among the 10 S. pastorianus strains was only 0.063%, which was much lower than that of the Sc-type (0.348%). For the Sc-type, the tree suggests that the two groups—which are separated by geographical location—have independent origins. However, the Se-type phylogenetic tree suggests that the different aspect from that of Sc-type. Se-type genomes of the two groups look like originated from a common ancestor. Thus, the conflicting characteristics of the phylogenetic trees may be attributable to differences in genetic features between the Sc and Se type strains, namely ploidy and hetero-SNV density.

Assignment of hetero-SNVs and haplotype phasingWe further validated these SNVs to address the conflicting phylogenic analysis by focusing on the hetero-SNVs in Group 2. This assessment revealed interesting results for the SNV numbers for Group 1 and Group 2 strains (Table 4). Specifically, nearly all the homo–hetero-SNVs observed between Group 1 and Group 2 are consistent relationships (i.e. Group 1's homo allele is equal to either allele of Group 2's hetero-SNV at the corresponding locus), and there are few conflicting SNVs. With few exceptions, either allele of the Group 2 hetero-type SNVs consists of the same sequence as the corresponding positions' haploid Group 1 allele. To confirm that this relationship was not coincidental, we conducted an additional analysis to solve the linkage relationships of W34/70 adjacent hetero-SNVs (‘phasing’) based on sequence data to construct two separate intrahomologous haploid chromosomes (Supplementary Fig. S5A and B). We obtained 304 blocks containing five or more consecutive hetero-SNVs each. The total size of the blocks was 1,876,249 bp (15.6% of the whole Sc type genome), and the blocks consisted of 9,765 hetero-SNVs (89.6% of all hetero-SNVs in W34/70). To maximize the length of sequences comparable to phased haplotypes of W34/70, a consensus sequence was built for the Group 1 strains. As shown in Fig. 5A, the differences between Group 1 strains are quite few and seemingly negligible for this analysis. Finally, we constructed a total of 274 blocks (1,705,313 bp including 8,731 hetero-SNVs) that could be compared with the Group 1 consensus sequence, covering 80.1% of all hetero-SNVs in W34/70.

Phylogenetic analysis based on haplotype-phased chromosomal SNVsAs the result of the analysis described above, we obtained 274 blocks consisting of three Sc-type chromosome sequences each (i.e. one Group 1 consensus chromosome and two W34/70 haplotype-phased intrahomologous chromosomes). We divided the phased chromosomes into two groups, W34/70_a and W34/70_b, based on sequence identity with Group 1 (Supplementary Fig. S5C and Fig. 6A). The same analysis results for the randomly shuffled hetero alleles of W34/70 dropping off the linkage information (Supplementary Fig. S5D and E) are presented in Fig. 6B. As shown in Fig. 6A, the Group 1 and W34/70_a identity distribution was significantly higher than that between Group 1 and W34/70_b, but no significant difference in the two distributions was observed based on randomly divided allele information (Fig. 6B). In addition, a phylogenetic tree of the consensus sequence of the Group 1 strains, the two haplotypes of W34/70 (W34/70_a and W34/70_b), and S288c is presented in Fig. 6C. The tree was described based on 14,322 sites containing 8,731 hetero-SNVs within 274 blocks. As shown in Fig. 6C, Group 1 and W34/70_a reside in the same clade. Similarly, the phylogenetic tree of the other four Group 2 strains revealed that all Group 2 ‘type a’ chromosomes reside in the same clade as Group 1 (Supplementary Fig. S6). These results support the non-coincidental nature of the observation that either of the Group 2 hetero-type SNV alleles has the same sequence with the corresponding positions' haploid Group 1 allele, thus strongly suggesting that one of Group 2's chromosomes is shared with Group 1's chromosomes.

Traces of frequent LOH events observed in haplotype-phased Sc-type chromosomesAs mentioned above, the uneven distribution of hetero-SNVs might be evidence of frequent LOH events (Fig. 4). In addition, we identified two examples of evidence of LOH in haplotype-phased intrahomologous Sc-type chromosomes. We also observed consecutive regions with hetero-SNVs and both types of homo alleles constituting corresponding hetero nucleotides in the Group 2 strains (Fig. 7A). All SNVs of Group 2 in these regions—which span 16.0 kb—exhibited this pattern, and there were no exclusive SNVs. Moreover, the Group 1 strains exhibited either type of homo allele. Genomes with hetero-SNVs may be more ancestral type, with LOH events likely occurring independently in each strain, thus yielding two types of homo alleles at those loci. Another example is presented in Fig. 7B; blocks spanning ~17 kb indicate that the Group 1 sequences are nearly identical to either sequence in the hetero Group 2 strains (W34/70, CBS1483, and CBS1484). In addition, CBS2156 and CBS5832 lost heterozygosity and have the same sequences as Group 1 strains, with the exception of two continuous regions of homo-SNVs between Group 1 strains and Group 2 strains (~3 and ~5 kb regions shown in green boxes). The full elucidation of the evolutionary history of this 17-kb block is nearly impossible, but these regions suggest the existence of other LOH events for common Group 2 ancestor strains. These homo-SNV ‘island regions’ in the solved linkage blocks are the difference between the Group 1 and W34/70_a-type chromosome sequences. Therefore, Group 1–W34/70_a has different sequences and branch lengths remaining in the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 6A). Here, we set a threshold length and divided into separate blocks if the distance between adjacent SNV loci exceeded the threshold. The phylogenetic trees resulting from threshold lengths of 1000 and 300 bp are presented in Supplementary Fig. S7. The threshold length correlates with branch length in Group 1–W34/70_a. This phenomenon is further evidence of frequent LOH. If an LOH event occurred for a W34/70 chromosome, a homo-SNV region was established. If the opposite allele from Group 1 remained, a homo-SNV is observed in this region and caused branch length in the phylogenetic tree. If the same allele as Group 1 remained, no SNVs were detected in this continuous region. For example, in Fig. 7B, no SNV regions are observed immediately right of the left region from 396,036 to 397,000 bp, which may be the result of an LOH with the corresponding remaining alleles in Group 1. When the threshold was set shorter than this silent SNV region, the blocks were divided. Thus, shorter thresholds facilitate the detection of shorter LOH regions, resulting in shorter branch lengths. Evidence of LOH observed in haplotype-phased chromosomes. Two examples of regions in which LOH is expected to have occurred in some strains. (A) The common ancestor of the strains is considered to have had hetero-SNVs in these regions, and some strains are suspected to have undergone LOH, thus switching SNVs from the hetero to the homo type. (B) In this block, nested LOH events likely occurred.

The origin of S. pastorianus mtDNATo determine the origin of S. pastorianus mtDNA, the mtDNA of eight strains from three species was assembled into a circular scaffold. The mtDNA sizes and GC contents are presented in Table 5. In S. pastorianus strains CBS1503, CBS1513, CBS1538, and W34/70, the mtDNA was ~69 kb, smaller than that of S. cerevisiae S288C (85,779 bp) but slightly larger than those of S. eubayanus CBS12357 (64,290 bp) and BaiFY1 (67,205 bp). The S. pastorianus strain mtDNA exhibited conserved synteny with the mtDNA of S. eubayanus and S. bayanus. Mitochondrial genome in S. pastorianus strains and related speciesMitochondrial genome in S. pastorianus strains and related speciesPhylogenetic analysis based on the mitochondrial ORFs revealed that the mtDNA of S. pastorianus strains shares a common origin between Groups 1 and 2, with BaiFY1 exhibiting greater similarity in mtDNA to S. pastorianus (Fig. 8). The mtDNA of interspecies hybrids can be inherited from either parental species. Although it was previously demonstrated that S. pastorianus mtDNA is not of the Sc type,2,6 it could not be confirmed as Se type because the mtDNA sequence of S. eubayanus had not been determined. Interestingly, BaiFY1 mtDNA (isolated in Tibet)4 differs considerably from that of CBS12357 (isolated in Patagonia),3 with a sequence identity of 90–95% between the two strains despite being pure strains of the same species. Therefore, the Se-type genome of S. pastorianus strains is thought to originate from Tibet or its surrounding regions, consistent with previous studies.4Phylogenetic tree based on mitochondrial ORFs. Shown are the phylogenetic relationships among S. pastorianus (CBS1503, CBS1513, CBS1538, and W34/70), its parental species S. cerevisiae (S288C) and S. eubayanus (CBS12357 and BaiFY1), and the related species S. bayanus (CBS380 and NBRC1948) based on mitochondrial ORFs. Four S. pastorianus strains (from Groups 1 and 2) are located in the same clade. Additionally, the mtDNA of S. eubayanus BaiFY1 is most closely related to that of S. pastorianus, suggesting that the latter originated from a single parental species (S. eubayanus).

Shown are the phylogenetic relationships among S. pastorianus (CBS1503, CBS1513, CBS1538, and W34/70), its parental species S. cerevisiae (S288C) and S. eubayanus (CBS12357 and BaiFY1), and the related species S. bayanus (CBS380 and NBRC1948) based on mitochondrial ORFs. Four S. pastorianus strains (from Groups 1 and 2) are located in the same clade.

Evolutionary history of S. pastorianusOn the basis of these results, we discuss whether the S. pastorianus strains originated from independent hybridization events or a common event. Translocation analysis revealed that the Group 1 and 2 strains share at least three interchromosomal translocations at the nucleotide level, indicative of common ancestors for both the Sc- and Se-type parental strains. The phylogenetic mtDNA genome analysis provided further support for a common origin (Tibet). In contrast, ploidy and phylogenetic analyses using SNVs against reference sequences suggested that the groups have different Sc-type ancestors and therefore independent evolutionary origins. The frequency of translocations is known to be much higher than that of point mutations;2,7 therefore, SNVs provide more robust evidence. However, hetero-SNV analysis indicated that 17.0–39.2% of SNV sites between Groups 1 and 2 could be accounted for by consistent SNV relationships (Table 4). Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis using haplotype-phased sequences suggested that Group 1 and Group 2 strains may share haploid Sc-type chromosomes as well as a common ancestor.Based on these analyses, we hypothesized that at least one hybridization event was shared between Group 1 and 2 strains. Following this hypothesis, the difference in ploidy between the two groups can be explained by the chromosomal deletions in Group 1 (Fig. 9A) or an additional hybrid Sc-type genome in Group 2 (Fig. 9B). In the former scenario, a common ancestor originating from both Sc- and Se-types had a diploid genome, with subsequent chromosomal translocations; the ancestral Group 1 strains then experienced numerous chromosomal deletions in the Sc-type genome, leaving only some haploid chromosomes in the current Group 1 strains. In the latter scenario, a common ancestor originated from the first hybrid between Sc-type haploid and Se-type diploid genomes, followed by the formation of two groups after chromosomal translocations. In the Group 1 strains, chromosomal deletions in the Sc-type genome occurred, whereas the ancestral Group 2 strain interbred with another Sc-type species to produce a second hybrid. Two hypotheses regarding S. pastorianus origins based on shared chromosomal translocations and differences in ploidy between Groups 1 and 2. (A) Hybridization between diploid Sc and Se types occurred before chromosomal translocations, whereas chromosomal deletions occurred only in ancestral Group 1 strains. (B) After hybridization between haploid Sc and diploid Se types and chromosomal translocations, ancestral Group 2 strains gained another Sc type (i.e. a second hybridization event occurred).

This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.However, the remaining 60–80% of SNVs between these two groups are difficult to explain when only accounting for hetero–homo-SNV relationships. To address this point, we assumed that LOH events occurred with high frequency and could produce two homozygous alleles when occurring at a heterozygous location. Therefore, if Group 1 and 2 strains share common chromosomes (dark blue in Fig. 9) and LOH occurred in the diploid ancestor of Group 2 strains (early S. pastorianus in Fig. 9A or after the second hybridization strain in Fig. 9B), these two alleles may be observed randomly. If the opposite allele of Group 1 strains was retained, this site would display a homo-SNV/homo-SNV relationship in the two groups (light blue region for Group 2 in Fig. 9). However, the difference at this site would disappear if the same allele of Group 1 was retained. Consequently, homo-SNVs between the two groups were observed despite their shared common ancestral chromosomes. This speculation is supported by the distribution of hetero- and homo-SNVs between the Group 1 and 2 strains (Supplementary Fig. S8). Hetero-SNVs, homo-SNV regions, and regions with no SNVs co-segregated as continuous blocks, possibly as a result of LOH corresponding to these regions. Furthermore, when we examined individual SNV allele sequences present in the blocks (i.e. at least five continuous SNV sites) in each strain—for which at least one of the alleles of the Group 2 strain exhibited hetero-SNVs—we determined that despite 512 blocks with 11,178 sites expanding to 2.34 Mb, there were only nine conflicting sites (Supplementary Table S2). These observations strongly suggest that the common ancestor of Group 2 had highly heterozygous chromosomes, of which one pair was shared with Group 1. After repeated chromosomal deletions and LOH in continuous regions, some blocks exhibited the homo-SNV/homo-SNV relationship; other blocks displayed no SNVs, and hetero-SNV/homo-SNVs were observed in the remaining 17–39% of the genome.4. ConclusionsSaccharomyces pastorianus is a useful species for investigating the evolutionary history of an interspecies hybrid. The genome sequences of the two parental species, S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus, are available as reference genomes for analysis and can provide details of genome rearrangement events, including interchromosomal translocations, as well as chromosomal deletions and duplications following hybridization. We sequenced 14 strains of three species, including 10 strains of S. pastorianus, by NGS, and we compared the sequences to determine the phylogenetic relationships between S. pastorianus and its relatives. There are two conflicting hypotheses about whether the two S. pastorianus groups are derived from separate or a single hybridization event. Our analyses provide strong evidence that the haploid Sc-type chromosomes of Group 1 genomes and one of the intrahomologous diploid Sc-type chromosomes of Group 2 genomes were shared. Thus, the two S. pastorianus groups are not independent; they may have originated from the same parental species (S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus) and share at least one hybridization event. Many of the SNVs shared by the two groups may have resulted from chromosomal deletion with LOH as an adaptive strategy following hybridization. This evolutionary scenario resolves all of the apparent contradictions, yet the genome sequence alone cannot reveal the driving force behind chromosomal deletions and LOH. Experimental approaches—such as the detection of LOH after hybridization between genomes exhibiting high vs. low heterozygosity—may provide additional insights into these processes.5.
