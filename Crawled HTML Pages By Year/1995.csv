"2","10.1093/dnares/2.1.1","Cloning and Identification of the hemG Gene Encoding Protoporphyrinogen Oxidase (PPO) of Escherichia coli K-12","Koichi Nishimura,Toru Nakayashiki,Hachiro Inokuchi","01 February 1995","Escherichia coli, photoresistant revertant, heme biosynthesis, hemG, protoporphyrinogen oxidase"," Cells of the VSR751 strain, which was previously isolated as a photoresistant revertant of the visA -deleted ( hemH -deleted) strain of Escherichia coli K-12, accumulated uroporphyrin (uro), coproporphyrin (copro) and protoporphyrin IX (proto), but did not accumulate as much protoporphyrin as cells of the parental strain ( hemH -deleted). Therefore, we concluded that strain VSR751 must be defective in protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPO), the product of the hemG gene. By complementation analysis using VSR751, we isolated and identified this gene. The hemG gene is located at 86 mim on the E. coli chromosome, just upstream of the rrnA operon, and is transcribed clockwise in the same direction as the rrnA operon. This gene encodes a 181-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of about 21 kDa. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of flavodoxin motif, suggesting that a cofactor of this enzyme is flavin mononucleotide, which is consistent with the previous report that the mammalian PPO had the flavin cofactor.

"3","10.1093/dnares/2.1.9","In Vitro Processing of Heteroduplex Loops and Mismatches by Endonuclease VII","Karin Birkenkamp,Böorries Kemper","01 February 1995","mismatch, DNA repair, synthetic oligonucleotides, hybrid DNA, phage T4"," Endonuclease VII is a Holliday-structure resolving enzyme of phage T4 which cleaves at junctions of branched DNAs and at mispairings. In extension of these findings we report the following: i) Endonuclease VII can discriminate between a large heteroduplex loop and a TT mismatch arranged in tandem, 6 nt distant from each other, in the same heteroduplex molecule. The enzyme cleaves two nucleotides 3' from the base of the loop or the TT mismatch. ii) Similar to its reactions with mismatches cleavage of heteroduplex loops by endonucleave VII can also initiate correction of perfect double-strandedness by T4 DNA polymerase and T4 DNA-ligase in vitro . Loops of 8 nt and 20 nt were repaired efficiently. iii) For the first time endonuclease VII cleavage sites were also mapped in single-stranded DNA if it was part of the 20-nt loop. This suggests that looping of single-stranded DNA can induce formation of secondary structures, which are recognizable by endonuclease VII. "

Hosseini-Mazinani,Naoki Koshikawa,Kazunori Sugimoto,Yuhko Aoki,Mikio Arisawa","01 February 1995","Saccharomyces cerevisiae, sulfite reductase a subunit, MET10 gene, nucleotide sequence"," A DNA fragment of 2.1 kb was specifically amplified by PCR with primers based on the amino acid sequences obtained from the N-terminal region and the cyanogen bromide-derived peptide of the sulfite reductase a subunit in Saccharomyces cerevisiae . With this fragment as a probe, the gene coding for the sulfite reductase a subunit was isolated froma genomic library of S. cerevisiae . Sequencing analysis revealed that the gene contains a 3105-bp open reading frame, which is large enough to code for a protein of 1035 amino acid residues. The transcript of the sulfite reductase a subunit gene was detected by Northern analysis after methionine deprevation, but the amount of the transcript did not directly correlate with the enzyme activity. The DNA fragment containing the sulfite reductase a subunit gene rescued the met10 phenotype by complementation. "
"5","10.1093/dnares/2.1.21","cDNA Sequences of Three Kinds of ß-tubulins from Rice","Yasunori Koga-Ban,Tomoya Niki,Yoshiaki Nagamura,Takuji Sasaki,Yuzo Minobe","01 February 1995","Oryza sativa, rhizoxin sensitivity, seedling blight disease, gene family, RFLP mapping"," Complete nucleotide sequences of three kinds of rice ß-tubulin cDNA clones (pTUB22, R1623 and R2242) were determined. Southern hybridization indicated that these ß-tubulins consist of one gene family. Using RFLP mapping, these three ß-tubulin cDNAs were mapped to different chromosomes indicating at least three loci for the ß-tubulin gene. The deduced amino acid sequences of these cDNAs showed a high similarity to other plant ß-tubulins. The asparagine residue located at the 100th amino acid from the Nterminus of plant ß-tubulins was also conserved with these three ß-tubulins. This asparagine is thought to be responsible for the sensitivity against rhizoxin, the toxin of the pathogen of rice seedling blight, Rhizopus sp. a soil-borne microorganism. Expression of the three ß-tubulin genes was analyzed by Northern blotting and all three clones were expressed in root, the possible target tissue of rhizoxin. These results suggest that these clones are candidates of ß-tubulins targeted by rhizoxin. "

Therefore we analyzeda sample of 22 Not I linking clones prepared from mouse brain DNA, to determine whether these mouse Not I site associatedclones could be usedfor comparative analysis of mouse andh uman genomes by cross-reaction with both mouse and human genomic DNA andRNA in Southern andNorthern hybridization. We further examined whether we couldestablish the identity of these clones with known genes by comparing the nucleotide sequences surrounding the Not I site with the GenBank database. We observed that 70% of the clones cross-hybridized with human DNA and that 4 of 11 testedclones (36%) detecteda transcript in human HeLa cells RNA whereas 73% clones (8/11) detected transcripts in mouse RNAs from one or more organs. Single pass sequence analysis was successful on 16 of 19 clones. The GC content in these sequences was very high (48.8% to 73.8%) suggesting that 12 of 16 sequencedclones contained a CpG island. Three out of 19 clones showed significant similarity with previously analyzedmouse gene sequences in GenBank, including the mouse rRNA gene family, cathepsin and the scip POU-domain genes. In addition, two sequences showed significant similarity to the human andrabbit protein phosphatase 2A-ß subunit andthe human transforming growth factor-ß. Thus, 5 of 16 clones showed homology with identified genes. These results and the recent work of using RLGS methods for genetic mapping indicate that Not I linking clones can be usedto efficiently cross reference a comparative analysis of the mouse andh uman genomic maps.

The Coding Sequences of 40 New Genes (KIAA0081-KIAA0120) Deduced by Analysis of cDNA Clones from Human Cell Line KG-1","Takahiro Nagase,Nobuyuki Miyajima,Ayako Tanaka,Takashi Sazuka,Naohiko Seki,Shusei Sato,Satoshi Tabata,Ken-ichi Ishikawa,Yutaka Kawarabayasi,Hirokazu Kotani,Nobuo Nomura","01 February 1995","full-length cDNA sequence, unidentified human gene, protein motify, mRNA expression, chromosomal location, myeloid cell line KG-1","We isolated full-length cDNA clones from size-fractionated cDNA libraries of human immature myeloid cell line KG-1, and the coding sequences of 40 genes were newly predicted. A computer search of the GenBank/EMBL databases indicated that the sequences of 14 genes were unrelated to any reported genes, while the remaining 26 genes carried some sequences with similarities to known genes. Significant transmembrane domains were identified in 17 genes, and protein motifs that matched those in the PROSITE motif database were identified in 11 genes. Northern hybridization analysis with 18 different cells and tissues demonstrated that 10 genes were apparently expressed in a cell-specific or tissue-specific manner. Among the genes predicted, half were isolated from the medium-sized cDNA library and the other half from the small-sized cDNA library, and their average sizes were 4 kb and 1.4 kb, respectively. As judged by Northern hybridization profiles, small-sized cDNAs appeared to be expressed more ubiquitously and abundantly in various tissues, compared with that of medium-sized cDNAs."

In-frame insertion/deletion differences were found among the clones at two sites in the open reading frame, suggesting alternative splicing of the message or the presence of multiple genes which code for this protein. The deduced amino acid sequence revealed that one rat CNBP sequence was completely identical to its human counterpart. This striking conservation, together with the fact that homologous genes have been found in various organisms including Schizosaccharomyces pombe , suggests that CNBP plays a basic biological role in eukaryotic cells. The recombinant GST-CNBP fusion protein produced in Escherichia coli bound to a G-rich single-stranded RNA and DNA in a sequence-specific manner. "
