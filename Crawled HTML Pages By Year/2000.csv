2,10.1093/dnares/7.1.1,Tnat1 and Tnat2 from Arabidopsis thaliana : Novel Transposable Elements with Tandem Repeat Sequences,"Kenichi Noma,Eiichi Ohtsubo",NO,NO,NO,1-Feb-00,"Arabidopsis thaliana, transposable element, tandem repeats, target site duplication"," A computer-aided homology search of databases found that the nucleotide sequences flanking ATLN44 , a non-LTR retrotransposon (LINE) from Arabidopsis thaliana , are repeated in the A. thaliana genome. These sequences are homologous to flanking sequences of 664 bp with terminal inverted repeat sequences of about 70 bp. The 664-bp sequence and most of the 14 homologues identified were flanked by direct repeat sequences of 9 bp. These findings indicate that the repeated sequence, named Tnat1 , is a transposable element that duplicates a 9-bp sequence at the target site on transposition and that ATLN44 is inserted in one Tnat1 member. Interestingly, all of the Tnat1 members had tandem repeats comprised of several units of a 60-bp sequence, the number of repeats differing among Tnat1 members. Of the Tnat1 members identified, one was inserted into another sequence repeated in the A. thaliana genome: that sequence is about 770 bp long and has terminal inverted repeat sequences of about 110 bp. The sequence is flanked by direct repeats of a 9-bp sequence, indicating that it is another transposable element, named Tnat2 , from A. thaliana . Moreover, Tnat2 members had a tandem repeat about 240 bp long. Tnat1 and Tnat2 with tandem repeats in their internal regions show no homology to each other or to any of the elements identified previously; therefore they appear to be novel transposable elements.

Although many mutants have been reported, no method to isolate the corresponding genes was reported. We developed a gene tagging and gene-trap system in P. patens by using the shuttle mutagenesis technique, which has been used in the budding yeast. In 5264 tagged lines, 203 mutants with altered developmental or morphological phenotypes were obtained. In 129 of 4757 gene-trap lines, ß-glucuronidase (GUS) activity was detected in some tissue. Although multiple copies of a tag were detected in many tagged lines by Southern analyses, most copies are likely integrated at the same locus according to PCR analyses. "
4,10.1093/dnares/7.1.19,Random PCR-Based Genome Sequencing: A Non-Divide-and-Conquer Strategy,"Koichi Nishigaki,Koichiro Akasaka,Takashi Hasegawa",NO,NO,NO,1-Feb-00,"genome sequencing, strategy, random PCR, PCR-relay, shotgun"," We propose a genome sequencing strategy, which is neither divide-and-conquer (clone by clone) nor the shotgun approach. Random PCR-based and PCR relay sequencing constitute the basis of this novel strategy. Most of the genome is sequenced by the former process that requires only a set of non-specific primers and a template DNA. Random PCR-based sequencing reduces redundancy in sequencing by exploiting known sequence information. The number of primers required for random PCR was significantly diminished by using a combination of primers. The former process can be partially replaced by the shotgun method, if necessary. The gap-filling process can be effectively performed by way of PCR relay. The feasibility of this strategy was demonstrated using the Escherichia coli genome. This strategy enhances the global effort towards genome sequencing by being available through the Internet and by allowing the use of preexisting sequence data. "
5,10.1093/dnares/7.1.27,mRNAs Encoding Zinc Finger Protein Isoforms are Expressed by Alternative Splicing of an In-frame Intron in Fission Yeast,"Koei Okazaki,Osami Niwa",NO,NO,NO,1-Feb-00,"Schizosaccharomyces pombe, zinc finger, alternative splicing"," We report here that a gene encoding a protein with three zinc fingers is expressed predominantly to produce a protein containing only two zinc fingers in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe . A third zinc finger resides within the in-frame intron that is normally spliced out. By RT-PCR analysis, we detected a minor transcript encoding a protein with three zinc fingers. Such alternative splicing for assortment of zinc finger domains have been reported in animals and implicated in switching of the target genes expressed specifically during development. This is the first report of the occurrence of such zinc finger assortment in lower eucaryotes. "

Sequence Features of the Regions of 3,076,755 bp Covered by Sixty P1 and TAC Clones","Shusei Sato,Yasukazu Nakamura,Takakazu Kaneko,Tomohiko Katoh,Erika Asamizu,Hirokazu Kotani,Satoshi Tabata",NO,NO,NO,1-Feb-00,"Arabidopsis thaliana chromosome 5 , genomic sequence, P1 genomic library, TAC genomic library, gene prediction"," In our ongoing project to deduce the nucleotide sequence of Arabidopsis thaliana chromosome 5, non-redundant P1 and TAC clones have been sequenced on the basis of the fine physical map, and as of January, 2000, the sequences of 16.6 Mb representing approximately 60% of chromosome 5 have been accumulated and released at our web site. Along with the sequence determination, structural features of the sequenced regions have been analyzed by applying a variety of computer programs, and we already predicted a total of 2697 potential protein coding genes in the 11,166,130 bp regions, which are covered by 159 P1 and TAC clones. In this paper, we describe the structural features of the 3,076,755 bp regions covered by newly analyzed 60 P1 and TAC clones. A total of 715 potential protein coding genes were identified, giving an average density of the genes identified of 1 gene per 4001 bp. Introns were observed in 80% of the genes, and the average number per gene and the average length of the introns were 4.5 and 147 bp, respectively. These sequence features are nearly identical to those in our latest report in which the data were compiled based on a new standard of gene assignment including the computer-predicted hypothetical genes. The regions also contained 12 tRNA genes when searched by similarity to reported tRNA genes and the tRNA scan-SE program. The sequence data and information on the potential genes are available through the World Wide Web database KAOS (Kazusa Arabidopsis data Opening Site) at Author Webpage . "
7,10.1093/dnares/7.1.65,Prediction of the Coding Sequences of Unidentified Human Genes. XVI. The Complete Sequences of 150 New cDNA Clones from Brain Which Code for Large Proteins in vitro,"Takahiro Nagase,Reiko Kikuno,Ken-ichi Ishikawa,Makoto Hirosawa,Osamu Ohara",NO,NO,NO,1-Feb-00,"large proteins, in vitro transcription/translation , cDNA sequencing, expression profile, chromosomal location, brain","We have carried out a human cDNA sequencing project to accumulate information regarding the coding sequences of unidentified human genes. As an extension of the preceding reports, we herein present the entire sequences of 150 cDNA clones of unknown human genes, named KIAA1294 to KIAA1443, from two sets of size-fractionated human adult and fetal brain cDNA libraries. The average sizes of the inserts and corresponding open reading frames of cDNA clones analyzed here reached 4.8 kb and 2.7 kb (910 amino acid residues), respectively. From sequence similarities and protein motifs, 73 predicted gene products were functionally annotated and 97% of them were classified into the following four functional categories: cell signaling/communication, nucleic acid management, cell structure/motility and protein management. Additionally, the chromosomal loci of the genes were assigned by using human-rodent hybrid panels for those genes whose mapping data were not available in the public databases. The expression profiles of the genes were also studied in 10 human tissues, 8 brain regions, spinal cord, fetal brain and fetal liver by reverse transcription-coupled polymerase chain reaction, products of which were quantified by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay"
