IntroductionAn enormous number of microorganisms, the vast majority of which are bacterial species, are known to colonize and form complex communities, or microbiota, at various sites within the human body. It is estimated that the human microbiota is composed of ∼1014 bacterial cells, which is 10 times more than the total number of human cells. The largest and most complex is the one comprised by intestinal bacteria that includes as many as 1012 cells per 1 g of feces in the average human individual.1 Thus, within each human body, intestinal and other microbiota, along with the ‘host’ human cells, form a complex ecosystem that, as a whole, interactively performs various biological processes.2 Therefore, perhaps we should regard ourselves as ‘superorganisms’ together with the indigenous microbes3 and that the composite genome should be referred to as the human ‘metagenome’.Studies on human intestinal microbiota should include microbial ecology and analysis of the complex metabolism of the microbial community, as well as various host–microbial interactions occurring at the interface between microbes and host intestinal epithelia. Such studies are expected to lead to understanding of the impact of the microbiota on human health and disease.4–6 Along these lines, it should be noted that an international collaborative project, ‘the human microbiome project (HMP)’, was launched7 in 2007 with the aim of collecting and integrating the genomic information from many diverse human microbiomes (the word ‘microbiome’ was first introduced in 2001 to define the collective genomes of microbiota8). This article is intended as an overview of the recent findings in relevant research fields.2. Microbial diversity of the human gut microbiotaOver the past decade, the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene (16S) sequence (∼1.5 kb) has been a useful landmark for analyzing the microbial diversity of human intestinal microbiota. A large-scale 16S phylotype analysis (grouping only by 16S rRNA sequence similarity) was carried out for three human adult microbiota.9 The analysis of 13 335 bacterial 16S sequences identified 395 phylotypes at the strain level using a threshold of 99% sequence identity (% ID) and a single archaeal phylotype (Methanobrevibacter smithii) within the three samples. Members of the genera Bacteroides, Eubacterium, Clostridium and Ruminococcus were the major species found in the adult microbiota. Of the 395 phylotypes, ∼80% represented sequences from species yet to be cultivated. This analysis also indicated high interindividual variations in microbial composition among the three samples. Another large-scale 16S analysis estimated 4074 phylotypes at the species level (≥97% ID) in 18 348 sequences obtained from 14 subjects including 12 obese adults monitored for over 1 year.10 This and a study using obese mice together revealed the association of the intestinal microbiota with obesity.11 More recently, 16S analysis was performed for 15 172 sequences from 190 samples including subjects with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and healthy adults.12 The etiology of IBD is known to largely correlate with the intestinal microbiota or certain microbial members.13–15 These and other studies demonstrated that the intestinal microbiota of IBD patients have reduced microbial diversity compared with those of healthy controls.12,16 The 16S analysis of other disease-afflicted subjects has also been performed in epidemiologic studies involving allergy17–19 and cancer.20,21The analysis of more than 45 000 bacterial 16S data combined with the three large-scale surveys described above estimated at least 1800 genera (≥90% ID), ∼16 000 phylotypes at the species level (≥97% ID) and ∼36 000 phylotypes at the strain level (≥99% ID) in the human intestinal microbiota, predicting even greater diversity at the species level.12 This analysis also revealed that the majority (98% of all species) belongs to only four bacterial divisions: Firmicutes (64%), Bacteroidetes (23%), Proteobacteria (8%) and Actinobacteria (3%), whereas other minor taxonomic divisions are quite diverse.Besides these ‘snapshot’ analyses of the intestinal microbiota composition, other long-term surveys have been performed to follow both the overall composition and that of limited members over periods ranging from several months up to 2 years.10,22–24 These longitudinal studies suggested that the composition of intestinal microbiota do not drastically change in adults within the periods examined.16S analyzes of infant intestinal microbiota have also been carried out.25–27 One analysis revealed a dramatic progression in microbial composition until at least 1 year after birth with higher interindividual variations, but less complex than those between adults, converging toward a profile characteristic to the adult type at the end of the first year of life.25 As might be expected, fraternal twins tend to show a significantly high similarity in their temporal microbial composition profiles.25,28 No clear correlation was found in overall microbial composition due to the mode of delivery (Cesarean section or vaginal birth) and feeding with breast milk or formulated milk. Therefore, the source of these early colonizers is not clear, whereas some specific species are known to be transmitted from mother to baby.26,29,30 Infant intestinal microbiota is mostly composed of bacteria such as Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Bifidobacterium and Enterobacteria. Both adult and infant intestinal microbiota members are restricted to a small subset of species as described above, implying that the intestinal microbiota have evolved to shape overall microbial diversity under strong selective pressures.4,53. Sequence-based metagenomics of the human gut microbiomeThe 16S analysis disclosed the existence of numbers of unculturable bacteria in the human intestinal microbiota, with only up to 20% of the 16S data able to be assigned to known species that have been successfully cultured in the laboratory during the past four decades.9 Purely culturable bacteria are definitely necessary for comprehensive characterization of their biological and genetic natures. On the other hand, it is obvious that the 16S data do not provide any information on functional features of the microbial community. Thus, both culture-based and 16S-based approaches have crucial limitations for further studies, particularly for functional analysis. Metagenomics, the third and newest approach, has made it possible to comprehensively explore the biological nature of these complex communities.31,32 This culture-independent approach includes shotgun sequencing of microbial DNA prepared from the microbiota containing unculturable species isolated directly from the environments, followed by intensive computational analysis of obtained genomic sequences. Metagenomics is a quite effective and powerful approach for collecting and analyzing the information of genes present in the microbial community, because the proportion of the protein-coding regions in bacterial genomes can be as high as 80%, so that most of the metagenomic sequences obtained contain at least partial gene regions directly related to functions.33 Biased data can be minimized in the metagenomic analysis, but a small fraction of genes may be relatively under-represented in the entire data set mainly due to toxicity of the gene products or sequence regions to the host Escherichia coli during cloning of the microbial DNA.34 In addition, the degree of gene coverage is largely dependent on sequencing depth and complexity of the communities. These problems can be overcome by employing next-generation DNA sequencers based on massively parallel sequencing technologies,35 by which the cloning step is eliminated and sequence quantity is increased by orders-of-magnitude compared with that of conventional Sanger sequencers.To date, metagenomic data of human and mouse intestinal microbiomes have been published from three separate groups.11,36,37 Gill et al. obtained ∼78 megabases (Mb) unique metagenomic sequence data from the intestinal microbiome of two healthy human adults. Comparison of gene sets annotated in the intestinal microbiomes with human genes identified significant numbers of bacterial genes that are not encoded in the human genome. The function of these gene products contributes largely to the metabolism of glycans, amino acids and xenobiotics, and biosynthesis of vitamins and isoprenoids, which are necessary processes in human biology. These findings indicate the symbiotic relationship with humans and support the concept that we are superorganisms, the union of humans with their microbiota.3 Kurokawa et al.37 analyzed 13 human intestinal microbiomes including adults, children and unweaned infants and obtained 479 Mb unique metagenomic sequence data. Unexpectedly, more than half (up to 90%) of total shotgun reads were assembled to form unique contigs in each sample, which is in sharp contrast to soil microbiota in which <1% of total reads were assembled. These results suggest that the amount of sequence data produced in the two metagenomic studies (around 50 Mb of Sanger sequence data for each sample) could substantially uncover the major species with the highest orders of magnitude in quantity in each microbiota, and that these species may be comprised of a very limited number of strain-level species, perhaps accounting for <20 species in each microbiome. The constitution of major species by strain-level species, not by high species-level diversity, could be inferred from base-inconsistency in the generated contigs, with most of those ≥5 kb displaying high sequence similarity of >99.5% ID between assembled reads. In order to uncover the vast numbers of other species present at lower orders of magnitude, it would be necessary to produce sequence data of several more orders of magnitude.The analysis by Kurokawa et al. also found 647 novel gene families specific to these intestinal microbiomes when compared with genes present in the metagenomic data of other microbial communities such as sea-surface, deep-sea and soil, and significantly enriched genes in these microbiomes when compared with gene sets in known microbes, except for the gut inhabitants. These gut microbiome-enriched (gut-enriched) genes were assigned to 237 and 136 clusters of orthologous groups (COGs) for the adult/child and the infant microbiomes, respectively, sharing 58 COGs between them for a total of 315 COGs in all. In the 315 enriched COGs, the function related to carbohydrate metabolism was remarkable in both types, but the functional repertories clearly differed between the adult and infant types. The adult type was rich in polysaccharide-degrading enzymes and the infant type was rich in sugar transporters. These data indicate that the functionality of healthy intestinal microbiota relies largely on available nutrients in the diet.38,394. Further analysis of metagenomic genes identified in 13 Japanese samplesGenome analysis of several Bacteroides strains dominant in adult intestinal microbiota indicated the richness of genes involved in polysaccharide metabolism,40–42 exemplifying the functional adaptation of intestinal microbes to gut habitats rich in polysaccharides, which are metabolized by bacteria to generate short-chain fatty acids such as butyrate, the major energy source for the host.38 It is also valuable to examine and compare the content of genes belonging to the 315 gut-enriched COGs in each genome of bacteria isolated from various environments. Our group recently performed a similarity search analysis of the enriched genes for 371 bacteria whose genomic sequences are already available. The 371 bacteria were classified into seven groups according to their origin of isolation. The ratio of adult gut-enriched genes in each genome is shown in Fig. 1. The average percentage ratios were 3.9% for all 371 microbes, 9.2% for 46 commensal bacteria, 4.0% for 94 pathogens and 2.7% for 231 bacteria from the other five groups. Those of infant gut-enriched genes were 2.8% for all microbes, 6.0% for the commensal bacteria, 3.5% for the pathogens and 1.9% for the other bacteria. These data clearly show that most of the commensal bacteria contain gut-enriched genes at a higher ratio than the other environmental bacteria. Interestingly, many of the commensal bacteria with lower ratios overlap those of pathogens, implying that intestinal microbes with a lower ratio of gut-enriched genes might be primary reservoirs for the corresponding pathogens. Table 1 lists the top 15 species with a higher ratio of adult and infant gut-enriched genes, respectively, which differ considerably from one another, except for the two species, Ruminococcus and Dorea. For the adult gut-enriched genes, members aggregated to three species, Bacteroides, Eubacterium and Ruminococcus, all of which are known dominant species in adult intestinal microbiota. For the infant gut-enriched genes, members are relatively diverse with Clostridium, Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus species being characteristic. Some of them (e.g. Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus) are prominent probiotics, living microorganisms having beneficial effects on host health.43 The species with the higher ratios tend to be dominant in intestinal microbiota compared with the species with the lower ratios. For instance, E. coli K12 had a ratio of 3.4% for adult gut-enriched genes, much lower than the 15 species listed, which is consistent with the minority of E. coli in the adult intestinal microbiota. It is also possible that the metabolic mutualism between intestinal members may allow the species with lower ratios, e.g. the human intestinal archaeon (3.6 and 1.2% for the adult and the infant gut-enriched genes, respectively), to stably colonize the gut.44Ratio of gut microbiome-enriched genes (adult) in sequenced genomes of bacteria isolated from various environments. The similarity search was performed with a threshold value of ≤1e−8 for 371 bacteria whose genomic sequences were available from public databases. The 371 bacteria were classified into seven groups according to their origin of isolation; commensals, pathogens, plant-related, soil-born, freshwater-born, seawater-born and others, and shown in red, pink, green, brown, light blue, dark blue and black dots, respectively.Ratio of gut microbiome-enriched genes (adult) in sequenced genomes of bacteria isolated from various environments.

Therefore, intestinal microbes may have additional properties tolerant to transient, but harsh conditions encountered in the mouth and stomach, through which they must travel to reach the gut. Genes encoding these yet unidentified functions may be included in the 315 gut-enriched COGs that contain many conserved but function-unknown genes, accounting for nearly 30% of all gut-enriched COGs, and in the 647 novel gene families identified.37About 75% of the genes annotated in the metagenomic sequences of the 13 human intestinal microbiomes showed sequence similarity ranging from 40 to 100% ID at the amino acid level with known genes.37 When, for each gene, the best blastp-hit was used to tentatively assign the gene to a species, the distribution of sequence similarity for each species assigned could be depicted as shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 shows two distinct distribution patterns; those that peaked at high similarity of over 80% ID and those with low similarity between 50 and 80% ID. Typical species with the first pattern are Escherichia, Klebsiella, Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides, all of which were previously isolated from humans and fully sequenced, so it is reasonable that many of the metagenomic genes showed high sequence similarity with those in these microbes. On the other hand, the metagenomic genes showing low similarity with known genes in tentatively assigned species, such as Bacillus, Clostridium and Streptococcus, probably originate from species that are close to the assigned taxa but have not yet been isolated or sequenced. These data suggest that human intestinal microbes constitute distinct phylogenies from those of other environmental bacteria and have evolved with their own unique histories including co-evolution with the human host and its ancestors.2,5Distribution of sequence similarity of genes identified in the human intestinal microbiome. Only the data for the species that had sufficient numbers of best blastp-hit to known genes were represented. Species names are indicated in the box.

Issues to be considered in 16S and metagenomic studiesIn both cases of 16S rRNA phylotyping and metagenomic analysis, establishment of a reliable method for microbial DNA isolation from any given microbiota is a critical issue. This is because the intestinal microbiota comprise Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and a small fraction of archaea, some of which may be hard-to-lyse species. So far, methods based on mechanical disruption using zirconium/silica beads11,22,36,45 and those based on enzymatic lysis9,25,37,46,47 have been developed and employed for the isolation of microbial DNA from various bacterial sources.48–52 The DNA extraction method has been assessed with respect to the quality and quantity of obtained DNA as well as fecal sample preservation.53 Our group recently assessed and compared the published lysis methods using fecal samples. Our preliminary results, including UniFrac54 analysis of enumerated 16S data, shape and yield of obtained DNA, showed that many of the methods examined gave similar results in quality, but varied by more than 10-fold in quantity and in the degree of DNA fragmentation (data not shown).The 16S analysis also has an intrinsic problem in quantitative evaluation of the microbial composition because of the existence of multiple heterogeneous copies of the 16S rRNA genes within a genome along with uneven PCR-amplification of the 16S region. The range in copy number of the 16S rRNA gene varies from 1 to as many as 15 in prokaryotic species.55 In addition, the PCR primer Bact-8F,56 often used for amplification of the nearly full-length 16S sequence, might not be suitable at least for the quantification of Bifidobacteria, of which the 16S sequence has three base mismatches with the primer, underscoring the composition of this species.25 Recently, an improved primer pool was developed.57 Next-generation DNA sequencers guarantee the rapid collection of genomic data but provide less read-length than that of conventional Sanger sequencers.35 The feasibility of pyrosequencing reads of 200–300 bases for the 16S phylotype analysis58 was evaluated by collecting 141 000 reads from rhesus macaque intestinal microbiota.59 The results showed high reproducibility of the phylogenetic assignments and similarity of the major types and relative numbers of taxa to those obtained from Sanger sequences.6. Functions of the gut microbiotaDeciphering biological features of a taxonomically complex and ecologically dynamic microbial community is a challenging issue in gut microbiome research. Germ-free and gnotobiotic mice,60 pig61 and zebrafish62 provide simplified model ecosystems that allow detailed evaluation of functions of colonized microbiota or microbes and the corresponding host responses in vivo,63,64 as well as their impact on various host physiologies.11,65–69 Immunity in germ-free mice is premature, but is restored by colonization of commensal bacteria and even by a single microbe.70,71 Protection against pathogenic infection is also a characteristic feature of commensal bacteria.72–74Investigations have been made regarding the functions of commensal bacterial genes on their colonization in the mouse intestine. Flexible transcriptional regulation for adaptation to changes in available nutrients, including those during weaning, was found in Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron.39,75 Surface glycans expressed by Bacteroides fragilis are essential for its colonization.76 The analysis of certain Lactobacillus strains, which are thought to have health-promoting properties as probiotics, identified genes inducible upon their colonization.77 Expression profiling of both bacterial and host genes in mono-associated mice colonized by either Bifidobacterium longum or B. thetaiotaomicron and di-associated mice colonized by both bacteria were examined.78 The co-existence of B. longum expanded diversification in the carbohydrate substrates accessed by B. thetaiotaomicron in a host-independent manner. On the other hand, the presence of B. longum significantly reduced the expression levels of host genes responsible for antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria compared with that by B. thetaiotaomicron alone, suggesting the involvement of host responses in competitive colonization between these bacteria.Commensal bacteria share many indistinguishable features with pathogenic bacteria relating to host immune response.79–81 For example, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and peptidoglycan, major cell wall components of all bacteria, are well known ligands recognized by membrane-bound toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and TLR2 (TLR2), that serve as sensors of bacterial infection and lead to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα and IL-6.82 Commensal bacteria have the ability to activate pro-inflammatory responses leading to harmful effects on the host via TLR signaling in mice lacking IL-10,83 an anti-inflammatory cytokine.84 Commensal bacteria also have the ability to activate anti-inflammatory responses leading to beneficial effects on the host via TLR signaling when the cascade to pro-inflammatory responses is lacking.85 These results indicate that the impact of intestinal microbiota on the host physiology largely depends on the state of host immunity and that host-commensal bacteria interactions are considered to be placed at the exquisitely equilibrated state between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses,81,86 where the host preserves intestinal microbes while still being able to sense the bacteria that penetrate across intestinal borders.Mammalian epithelia including Paneth and dendric cells are major sources of endogenous antimicrobial substances, including: lysozymes, phospholipases and various antimicrobial peptides such as α-defensins,87 angiogenin488 and RegIIIγ.89 Several studies have examined the relationships between these antimicrobial peptides and their effect on various intestinal microbes. RegIIIγ is a C-type lectin, of which the expression is mediated by TLR signaling90 and down-regulated by a Gram-positive Bifidobacterium strain.78 The expression of mouse cryptdins, a counterpart of human α-defensins, requires Nod2 (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 2), a cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptor expressed in Paneth cells that senses for bacterial peptidoglycans.91,92 Mutations in the Nod2 gene are highly correlated with the etiological risk of a subset of Crohn’s disease (CD).14,93 The expression of α-defensins at the ileal of patients with CD of the ileal was significantly down-regulated, but not at the ileal of patients with CD of the colon.94 Certain Enterococcus strains have been shown to regulate the phosphorylation of peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) to induce the expression of downstream target genes including interleukin-10 (IL-10).95 PPARγ-deficient mice exhibited dysfunction on the maintenance of gut homeostasis.96Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron induced PPARγ-mediated cytoplasmic re-distribution of the NF-κB subunit RelA in intestinal cells, selectively attenuating the inflammatory response.97 These findings indicate that PPARγ is a nuclear factor associated with anti-inflammatory response. The expression of antimicrobial cathelicidin LL-37 is induced by butyrate, the product of polysaccharide fermentation by intestinal microbes.98 These antimicrobial peptides may suppress microbial overgrowth and excessive contact of bacteria to the epithelia by directly killing them, resulting in minimizing inadequate stimulation of inflammatory responses.80,99Some antimicrobial peptides were shown to dramatically increase in expression during the post-natal period.88,89,99,100 And, it has been shown that TLR signaling by LPS is activated in vaginally delivered newborn mice immediately after birth but not in newborns delivered by Cesarean section.101,102 These findings suggest that exposure of maternal-derived commensals to the intestinal epithelia in neonates is involved in initiating the development of intestinal homeostasis. Secreted (or mucosal) IgA produced by gut-associated lymphoid tissues is largely involved in shaping the intestinal microbiota composition, whereas lack of IgA expression can lead to adaptive immune response.103–105 Intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) was found to dephospholyrate the phosphate moiety in LPS, resulting in detoxification of LPS and prevention of bacterial penetration across the epithelial barrier, suggesting that IAP plays an important role in maintenance of gut homeostasis.106,107 Recently, a study on gene expression of the TLR4-mediated signaling cascade in LPS-stimulated macrophages identified two classes of genes: those responding only to initial LPS stimulation and those responding to repeated LPS stimulation. The former class of genes includes pro-inflammatory cytokine genes, whereas the latter includes antimicrobial genes such as cathelicidin-related peptides. Histone modifications are involved in this regulation,108 which could also be linked to disease susceptibility from environmental factors.109In summary, the host has evolved to establish many processes that sustain unresponsiveness toward the commensal bacteria while at the same time maintaining responsiveness toward pathogens (Fig. 3). These processes include the production of IgA, IAP and various antimicrobial peptides and epigenetic control of pro-inflammatory responses, all of which sever routes leading to excessive inflammatory response. On the other hand, pathogens also have evolved to equip various virulence factors, including effectors, that confer additional abilities for evading the host defense system, eventually inducing pro-inflammatory responses79,110 via change of the microbiota composition in favor of the pathogens.72 In contrast, commensal bacteria may also have evolved not only to acquire specific functions adaptive to the gut habitat, e.g. carbohydrate metabolism, energy production, cell maturation and proliferation toward intestinal homeostasis,111 but also to eliminate undesired appendages that could result in sensing for pro-inflammatory responses, e.g. profound depletion of genes for cell motility function in the metagenomic data of human intestinal microbiomes37 and attenuation of host immune response by loss of flagellar function.112Molecular interactions at the frontline between the host, intestinal commensal bacteria and pathogenic bacteria. Commensal bacteria possess specific functions adaptive to the gut habitat and are beneficial to host cells, including maintenance of intestinal homeostasis, but also include functions such as those of TLRs that signal immune responses to pathogenic infection.81,86 Host cells produce various antimicrobial substances such as IgA, IAP and antimicrobial peptides at the frontline to suppress excessive immune response to commensal bacteria, while maintaining responsiveness to pathogens equipped with various virulence factors to evade the host defense system.Molecular interactions at the frontline between the host, intestinal commensal bacteria and pathogenic bacteria.

HMP and future directionsThe HMP aims at a better understanding of the roles of human microbes on human biology including their relationship with health and disease.7 The project includes metagenomic and 16S analysis of the microbiota inhabiting various body sites such as the oral and nasal cavities, the gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts, and skin in several hundreds of healthy and disease-afflicted subjects, as well as genome sequencing of nearly 1000 human commensal microbes. In addition, various metadata concerning the host are needed, including variations in host genotypes113 and metabolic phenotypes114 that largely influence host–microbe interactions. In this regards, one challenging issue is the construction of an integrated metabolic map, of both human and microbiota,115 which will become the new frontier for medical purposes such as the development of biomarkers for prediction of disease predisposition of individuals, extensive drug design targeting the intestinal microbiota and personalized drug therapies.116,117A simplified model system using gnotobiotic animals has provided fundamental knowledge of the molecular mechanisms involved in intestinal host–microbe interactions, in which active bacterial components have been identified.118,119 However, an enormous number and variety of bacterial components and products must participate in these interactions, and most remain unknown. Future studies will include those to explore and identify intestinal bacteria and their gene products (including",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
metabolites) that are involved in host–microbial interactions, to identify human genes that respond to bacterial signals crucial for human physiology and to identify dietary components that influence and shape the intestinal microbiota composition. These scientific challenges will be achieved by using advanced ‘omics’ technologies coupled with the vast quantities of genomic data that are already being accumulated by the HMP. Thus, the human intestinal microbiome will pave the way leading to a new frontier in human biology, in which the human genome and the intestinal microbiome are tightly linked together as an integral part of the ‘human metagenome’ (Fig. 4).Future direction of human intestinal microbiota research. Human intestinal microbiota function is responsible for both human health and disease in accordance with its own genetic diversity and in association with human genetic variation. The study of human microbes, especially the vastly abundant intestinal microbes, is a new frontier in human biology. Many questions remain to be answered about host–microbe interactions, including: what factors and dietary components shape microbiota diversity, which bacteria and their components interact with host cells, which human genes respond to and how do they react to bacterial signals affecting human physiology.Future direction of human intestinal microbiota research.

The agreement of our result with high protein abundances, microarray data and radioactive data demonstrates that the genomic expression profile available in our method can be applied in a meaningful way to the study of cell physiology and also for more detailed studies of particular genes of interest.1. IntroductionRegulation of gene expression plays a central role in defining cell fate and controlling organ formation. Genomic function can be understood at the nucleotide level, but, the complexity and diversity of genomic function, leading to an emergent picture of the genome as an interacting system with many degrees of freedom, bring experimental and theoretical challenges to the quantitative measurement of the biological state, many of which are of statistical nature. Genes encode proteins, and proteins perform functions in the cell. Hence a gene takes part in biological function only if it is expressed, i.e. the protein produced from it is present in the cell. Gene regulation takes place during transcription, the process by which the cell reads the information contained in a gene and copies it to the messenger RNA which is subsequently used to make a functional protein. This is a most fundamental level of biological process which involves the interaction of DNA and proteins. Its regulation takes place through the binding of proteins to DNA at specific loci in the vicinity of the gene to be regulated. The transcription of one gene may be enhanced or reduced by the expression of the gene itself. The process is complex and not yet understood completely. Genes with high expression levels include those required for an organism’s viability and the ability to identify these genes is crucial for drug development. Certainly the high cost and technical expertise required is an obstacle to many investigators who are interested in pursuing such studies. Although a variety of software tools and technologies have been developed for gene expression studies, a universal standard making these studies more suitable for comparative analysis and for inter-operability with other information sources is yet to emerge. Large-scale, high-throughput experimental methods require material and information processing systems to match. The analysis of high-throughput gene expression data is in an early stage of development. Development of advance technology for whole genome expression studies is thus becoming increasingly recognized. Predicting expression level of genes through computational methods is appealing because it circumvents expensive and difficult experiment.In recent years there has been increasing reports1–23,43,44 on predicted highly expressed genes in several micro-organisms which provide a wealth of information about gene expression. It is suggested that the essential genes primarily include the ensembles of highly expressed genes that encode proteins [transcription/translational factors (TF), ribosomal proteins (RP), proteases and chaperons (CH), degradation, cellular localization, biosynthesis, metabolism, photosynthesis, respiration and glycolysis, etc] vital for cell physiology. Perhaps, the essential functions of these gene products correspond to the biased amino acid composition that might minimize the substantial biosynthesis energy costs indicating the high biological significance of these genes. Besides other mechanisms, it is also suggested that codon bias can influence gene expression by optimization of the translational rate and thus, highly expressed genes can be characterized on the basis of biased codon usages compared with average genes. In several previous studies,3,7–13,17 a number of different patterns of codon usage have been hypothesized and many indices have been proposed to measure the degree of codon bias. Among these, the codon adaptation index (CAI) has been widely applied to the prediction of highly expressed genes in various organisms.3,15,16,24–27 CAI was proposed as a measure of codon usage in a gene relative to that in a reference set of genes.3 The previous studies suggest that CAI index correlates better with expression level of a gene than other codon usage indices, such as the effective number of codons,7 codon bias index,8 the frequency of optimal codons,9 intrinsic codon bias index,10 maximum likelihood codon bias,11 synonymous codon bias orderliness,12 and measure independent of length and composition (MILC),13 etc. The parameters underlying the CAI model rely on the codon composition of only a limited set of highly expressed genes and are based on a fairly simple assumption that the functional class of genes are highly expressed. To define the parameters in the CAI model, Sharp and Li3 considered the codon frequency of only 24 highly expressed genes of which 50% were genes of RPs and the rest mostly metabolic enzymes. A related method, the codon usage model, is based on similar principles, but the parameters are based on a somewhat broader set of highly expressed genes. In application of this model, Karlin and coworkers17–23 have shown that it is a reasonable assumption that for RP genes, CH and TF are highly expressed. Gene expressivity is strongly correlated with protein abundances. A number of studies have also revealed that codon compositions in highly expressed genes are influenced by tRNA abundances.1–6 Generally, highly expressed genes, producing abundant proteins, use a subset of optimal codons which are recognized by the most abundant tRNA species. It is well established that highly expressed genes have strongly biased usage of alternative synonymous codons and that of preferred codons, which are thought to be translated most efficiently by the most abundant tRNAs, and the lowly expressed genes have less biased codon usage patterns.1,2 The observations strongly suggest that natural selection has shaped the codon usage pattern accommodating optimal gene expression levels for most situations of its habitat, energy sources, and life cycle. Codon usages vary considerably within and between organisms. The effect of natural selection on codon usage quantifies the level of gene expression. However, the resulting bias in the codon usage has two main components. One is the correlation with tRNA availability and the other is non-random choices between pyrimidines for third base. A critical analysis of codon usage in a gene shows that mutational bias also plays a role in codon selection. Several studies have analysed the relationship between the GC-content of isochors and the expression patterns of the genes they contain.28 The G + C composition resulting from mutational bias has been hypothesized to determine the major trends in codon usage of high or low G + C organisms. Within a genome, codon bias tends to be much stronger in highly expressed gene than in genes expressed at lower levels, suggesting that there might be some selective advantage to concentrate essential genes on GC rich domains of the genome. Surprisingly, to address this important issue, some studies have also given conflicting results.29–33 Several papers reported very weak correlations, either negative or positive between the GC-content and gene expression. The discrepancy among the studies might be due to the methods used to measure the expression parameter of the data sets analysed or the differences in the way correlations were computed.In fact, the characterization of regulatory elements underlying gene expression is largely an unsolved problem. The hypothesis that codon usage modulates gene expression has been accepted in general. Many researches in this field have formulated their own measures, which has led to a large number of available methods3,7–12,17 for gene expressivity analysis. Unfortunately, these methods are not universally applicable as they exhibit strong artefacts of their formulation with varying sequence length, or overall codon bias, or codon bias discrepancy. Our aim is to develop a measure that will be free from any such possible artefacts and we attempt here to verify the usefulness of such a measure by employing it to predict gene expressivity in Escherichia coli (E. coli).2. Materials and methodsRCB is the difference of observed frequency of a codon from the expected frequency under the hypothesis of random codon usage where the base composition were biased at three sites as that in the sequence under study, divided by the expected frequency. RCBS is the overall score of a gene indicating the influence of RCB of each codon in a gene. Our analysis is based on the hypothesis that RCB reflects the level of gene expression. The expression measure of a gene in this approach is denoted by RCBS. RCBS value close to 0 indicates a lack of bias for the codons and is thus useful for comparing different sets of genes.3. ResultsOur data set includes 4174 complete protein coding sequences from E. coli. Expression profiles of the genes are determined by calculating the score of RCB (RCBS value) for each gene and their distributions are shown in Fig. 1. The majority of genes (63%) have RCBS values lying between 0.2 and 0.4, and the mean and median values are 0.3870 and 0.3295, respectively. Only ∼18% genes have RCBS values >0.5. The analysis of RCBS values among different gene class shows that the gene classes (RP, CH, TF), which serve the representatives of highly expressed genes have RCBS > 0.5 in most of the cases. This suggests that significantly stronger codon bias is a result for translational efficiency as well. This finding is consistent with others,3,17,18 as most of the previous expression measures have considered those as representative standards for highly expressed genes in their calculation. There is also experimental evidence in support of RP, CH and TF as standard derivatives for the highly expressed genes as it is observed that many RPs augmented by abundant TF and CH proteins are needed to assure properly translated, modified and folded protein products which expedite and regulate cellular activities in most prokaryotic genomes. Our data support the proposition that each genome has evolved a codon usage pattern accommodating gene expression level, and RCBS value >0.5 exhibits favourable codon usage. So, we chose this index as an effective expression measure on the basis that it has been shown to correlate highly to expression levels and the predicted expression level based on RCBS (RCBS > 0.5) values suggests that almost 18% of genes in the E. coli genome qualify as highly expressed genes. In our study, the genes are segregated into different functional categories such as metabolism, information transfer, regulation, transport, cell process, cell structure, location of gene products, extra-chromosomal, DNA sites and cryptic genes in accordance with Munich Information Center for Protein Sequence (MIPS) classification. Functional analysis shows that highly expressed genes involved in the location of gene products are the largest functional class followed by genes involved in information transfer, metabolism, cell structure, cell process, extra-chromosomal, regulation and transport function, respectively. A total of 750 genes are identified as highly expressed genes in E. coli with 163 genes involved in energy metabolism, 75 genes involved in translation, 34 genes in transcription, and 29 in CH and folding (Supplementary Table SI). In addition, the functional class of amino acid biosynthesis, nucleotide biosynthesis, fatty acid biosynthesis and other cofactor and small molecule, etc includes 67 highly expressed genes. Besides, there are several (∼185) genes encoding predicted proteins and 15 other genes of unknown function, which are thought to be highly expressed genes in our approach. We observe that 24 genes encoding predicted proteins and 12 genes encoding proteins of unknown function are highly expressed genes with RCBS > 1.0. The highly expressed genes of E. coli with RCBS > 1.0 are reported in Supplementary Table SII (hypothetical protein or predicted protein genes are not listed). Of these, 11 encode proteins that function in energy metabolism, 18 are RP genes, 11 encode TF and the remaining encode proteins that function in different cell process.Distribution of RCBS for all coding genes in the genome of E. coli.Distribution of RCBS for all coding genes in the genome of E. coli.In order to compare our results, we have also calculated CAI values for the same genes. Fig. 2 shows the relationship between RCBS and CAI values. Here, the CAI scores have been calculated according to the original publication of Sharp and Li,3 which stem from 24 highly expressed genes. It can be clearly seen that for genes with high CAI values (>0.5), there is strong correlation between them (r = 0.4614). But for proteins with CAI values significantly <0.3, correlation is worse (r = −0.0572). The novel method of quantitatively predicting gene expressivity is then compared with the other widely accepted measure of Karlin and Marzek.17 In Fig. 3, we plot RCBS values against E(g) of Karlin et al.18 The correlation is surprisingly good with r = 0.6706, P < 0.001. We analyse further the relationship between the length of the coding regions and the expression level of genes. In Fig. 4 we plot RCBS as a function of the gene length. We observe that shorter genes assume the higher value of RCBS while longer genes tend to have lower RCBS. There is a strong correlation between RCBS and gene length (r2 = 0.65878 and χ2 = 0.0149). This effect is not due to systematic bias of gene size. To investigate the effect of protein length on gene expression as measured by RCBS, the data is split into three groups: short (L < 150), intermediate (150 < L < 300) and long (L > 300). Several observations can be made. Genes are sorted according to their expression level. It should be noted that genes of the same expression level may have wide variation in length and also that genes of the same length may have a wide range of RCBS. We observe that the estimate of expression level, as derived from RCBS, ranges from a low value to high value for each of the three length groups. It is evident from our data that RCBS ranges from 0.245 to 3.416 for L < 150, whereas it ranges from 0.123 to 0.907 for 150 < L < 300 and from 0.079 to 1.328 for L > 300. It is noted that the selective pressure on codon usage appears to be lower in genes encoding long rather than short proteins. Our studies, although less extensive, suggest that selection on codon usage as well as sequence composition is primarily responsible for RCBS. For a simple explanation, we select a set of E. coli sequences of equal length and randomize the above sequences 500 times, keeping their (i) codon usage; and (ii) sequence composition conserved. RCBS calculated for those sequences are found to vary in a wide range. We repeat the experiment on different sets of genes with varying length. The results are summarized in Supplementary Tables SIIA and SIIB. Supplementary Table SIIA describes the results of 14 arbitrary nucleotide sequences of different length, each randomized 500 times. In Supplementary Table SIIB, we present the results of the same experiment on a few selected genes of different length. We observe that the smaller sequences have a greater probability of resulting in high value of RCBS (>0.5), but there is nothing to prevent longer sequences from having high RCBS. Although the values for shorter sequences are more variable due to sampling effect, the intrinsic effect of gene length on RCBS reduces with the increase in length. A thorough exploration of theoretical values of RCBS suggests that RCBS can be an effective measure of gene expression, as its value depends on codon usage pattern along with DNA compositional bias of a gene.RCBS plotted against CAI for E. coli genes.RCBS plotted against CAI for E. coli genes.RCBS plotted against E(g)18 for E. coli genes.RCBS plotted against E(g)18 for E. coli genes.RCBS plotted against the length of 4174 genes from the E. coli genome.RCBS plotted against the length of 4174 genes from the E. coli genome.In order to test the RCBS as an expression level predictor, we chose to compare our results with the experiments. We collected data sets (listed in Supplementary Tables SIII and SIV) which consist of mRNA or protein abundance data obtained by different methods—mostly cDNA microarrays27,34,35 or 2D gel electrophoresis data36–39 for abundances of many E. coli proteins are available for comparison with the predicted levels of expression. In Fig. 5, we compare the predicted levels of expression in E. coli with 2D gel patterns34 and expression measure E(g) of Karlin et al.18 The relationship between RCBS values and mRNA levels seen in Fig. 5 agrees better than with the findings of Karlin et al.18 The correlation between expression level (as relative molecular abundance) and RCBS value is found to be 0.4533 whereas that with E(g) value is 0 .2618. Among the 20 most abundant proteins, 17 were identified as highly expressed genes with three exceptions for metE, folA and ilvE. The results are in good agreement with those predicted by E(g). Among the 20 least abundant proteins, only three mismatch with our predicted results whereas there are seven mismatches with the results of Karlin et al.18 Although pck, nusb, vals, args, rpll, thrs, leus are less abundant, according to 2D gel patterns, the high E(g) values of Karlin et al.18 support naming the genes highly expressed. But our data support only nusb, vals and rpll to be highly expressive genes. Of the remaining 55 proteins 22 were identified as highly expressed genes. This agreement with molecular abundance data supports our predicted results better than others. In a step forward we compare RCBS and the concentrations of various proteins in E. coli along with their CAI values24 (Supplementary Table SIV). Concentration is expressed as the number of protein molecules per cell. Concentration being used as a measure of gene expression, we find that our result is surprisingly good. The RCBS values along with the CAI values are plotted against the logarithm of concentration in Fig. 6. The predicted gene expression level using RCBS value is found to correlate well with the protein concentration data24 (r = 0.708211). The correlation is better than the quantitative measure of CAI (r = 0.615546). It suggests that a quantitative estimate of the expression level by RCBS values performs better than other indices of expression measure. Thus, regardless of the state of cell growth, one can measure the relative expression level for each gene under various growth conditions, different genetic states or over a time course during environmental change.RCBS (+) and E(g) (*) plotted against relative molecular abundance of 96 genes from E. coli genome.18 RMB denotes relative molecular abundance.

Despite the fact that the quality of experimental data seems to be a very important factor, we observe a good correlation between RCBS and microarray (radioactive) data (rmicro = 0.2415, rradio = 0.2098).Radioactive data (+) and microarray data (*)35 plotted against RCBS for E. coli genes.

Y-axis is taken in logarithmic scale.In another analysis we compared our expression measure (RCBS) with the genomic expression profiles of the E. coli genome growing on rich (Luria broth glucose) and on minimal culture (glucose) medium (Supplementary Tables SVA and SVB).34 Of the 76 genes expressed at significantly higher levels on Luria broth plus glucose medium, 54 genes show a high expression level in our expression measure, whereas only 12 genes out of 107 genes expressed on minimal glucose medium have a high level of expression. We observe that the correlation co-efficient of minimal culture data with RCBS (r = 0.3011) is good, but very much worse for Luria broth glucose data. The agreement of predicted and actual protein expression level varied greatly between all examined combinations of prediction method and data set. The discrepancy is thought to lie in the quality of experimental data. The preliminary analysis on the quality of experimental data shows that these kinds of experiments are inherently noisy and of low reproducibility. The reproducibility of microarray data can be evaluated through the computation of correlation coefficients within and among the data sets from different microarray experiments. Two data sets from different sources can be chosen for analysis in this study. In the first, the data set was obtained from ExpressDB and the comparison made between expression levels in E. coli grown to either mid-log phase (LP) or stationary phase (SP). In the second, the data set was obtained from the ASAP database, where E. coli is cultured in lysogeny broth (LB). It can clearly be seen that the pair wise correlation coefficient among the gene expression levels from different experiments (rLP-SP = 0.52, rLB-LP = 0.017, rLB-SP = −0.039)34 vary broadly indicating the very noisy nature of microarray experiments and their lack of accuracy. The quality of experimental data seems to be a very important factor in this kind of analysis. Large variances may reduce the significance of statistical tests and might hide interesting trends in complex data. Microarray data tend to suffer from noise introduced at each step of different experimental protocols, while protein abundance data and mRNA expression level do not agree well in all cases. The other probable reason for incoherent results is that prediction of gene expression from genomic data, based solely on codon usage, is oversimplified. Other factors, such as promoter strength and gene copy number should also be taken into account.We now discuss our results in more detail for different functional classes of genes. The highly expressed genes are then classified into different functional categories, e.g. RPs, CH and degradation proteins, transcription and TF, energy metabolism, electron transport, recombination and repair, outer membrane proteins, aminoacyl tRNA synthetases, etc. (The distribution of highly expressed genes of different functional class in the genomes of E. coli is displayed in Supplementary Table SI.) All, but one RP, the major CH/degradation proteins and translation/transcription processing factors attain high expression levels. Supplementary Table SII presents the 52 genes with the highest predicted expression levels in E. coli. The gene for trp operon ladder peptide trpL involved in amino acid (tryptophan) biosynthesis attains the highest RCBS value 3.42, among all E. coli genes.3.1. RP genesRPs are very important in cell biology as thus provide a range of activities required for all steps of protein biosynthesis. Following the analysis based on the definition RCBS and Equation (1) and (2), we observe that virtually all RP genes qualify as highly expressed genes. The genes encoding RPs, which are expected to be expressed at high levels during rapid cell growth, were identified with RCBS values >0.5 (Table 1). All but one RP in E. coli are expressed at significantly higher levels; the only exception is rimK, RP S6 modification protein, where it is thought to contribute to the ribosome maturation and modification. The RCBS values for highly expressed RP genes range from 0.50 to 1.77. In fact, all RP genes in E. coli do not reach the top expression level. Seventeen out of 56 are among the highest 86 highly expressed genes. The highest expression level occurs for L34, with an RCBS value of 1.77. The RPs are the major component, together with the ancillary proteins, involved in protein synthesis. The genes coding for RPs, protein synthesis factors and RNA polymerase subunits are all intermingled and organized into a small number of operons. We observe that the genes for some major translational or transcription processing factors, including tufA, tufB, fusA, fkpA, slyD, rpoB and rpoC, which are within or near the large RP operon, are predicted as highly expressed genes. Although RPs play an exclusive role in determining ribosome structure, several are multifunctional. RplA, rplD and rplT, the 50S ribosomal subunit proteins (L1, L4 and L20 respectively), and rpsH, the 30S ribosomal subunit protein S8 have a regulatory role. The S1 gene, a giant RP gene (labelled as rpsA) is essential to E. coli and putatively contributes to the initiation of protein synthesis. S9 (rpsI) participates in certain repair activities, and S16 (rpsP) acts as an endonucleases.RCBS of the highly expressed genes of different functional class in the E. coli genomeRCBS of the highly expressed genes of different functional class in the E. coli genome3.2. Genes for transcription/translation processing factorsThere are ∼100 genes encoding enzymes, factors and structural components that make up the translational apparatus. Out of these100 genes 75 are identified as highly expressed genes with RCBS values >0.5. Thus the majority of genes involved in translation are predicted to have a high expression level. Of these 75 translational genes, which are expressed at higher level, 55 encoded RPs. Highly expressed genes for transcription/translation processing factors are reported in Table 1 and can be compared with the data available.18There are ∼260 known genes that encode factors involved in translation and ribosome modification including the initiation and elongation factors, 34 of which are indicated to be at a higher expression level. As with RPs, genes coding for elongation factors (efp, yeip, fusA, tsf, tufA, tufB), ribosome recycling factor (frr) and translation initiation factor (infA) register as highly expressed genes which play important roles in translation. The expression level of infB, fused protein chain initiation factor is moderately high (RCBS = 0.49017). The regulation of infB which is downstream and co-transcribed with moderately expressed TF gene nusA (RCBS = 0.46579), is complex and is thought to be the result of auto regulation of the extent of the read through at upstream terminators by moderately expressed nusA. The expression level of infB is higher than nusA. The elongation factor efp has been shown to be essential in E. coli for protein synthesis and viability. The expression levels of other elongation factors (fusA, tsf, tufA, tufB) are gradually higher. Interestingly, the regulation tufB is partially dependent upon the fis gene, global DNA binding transcriptional and the fis gene has significantly higher expression level (RCBS = 0.93575). Small RNA molecules are very important in cell biology and can regulate translation. It is found that genes coding 5S RNAs (rrfA, rrfB, rrfC, rrfD, rrfE, rrfF, rrfG, rrfH) and 23S RNA (rrlA) have distinctive RCBS values >1.0. Gene expression is controlled by a regulator that interacts with a specific sequence of a target RNA. Ffs coding for the 4.5S sRNA component of signal recognition particle works with the ffh protein (RCBS = 0.3524) and is involved in co-translational protein translocation into and possibly through membranes. SsrS coding for 6S sRNA inhibits RNA polymerase promoter binding. It acts as a template for RNA-directed pRNA synthesis by RNAP and mimics an open promoter. RaiA codes for cold shock protein associated with 30S ribosomal subunit. Ffs,ssrS and raiA involved in translational process are predicted to be highly expressed genes in our approach.Moreover we identify four other genes which are involved in the post-translational process and are expressed at higher level. These are riml coding acetylase for 30S ribosomal subunit S18, def coding peptide deformylase, hypC coding protein required for maturation hydrogenases 1 and 3, napD coding for assembly protein for periplasmic nitrate reductage, and npr coding for phosphohistidinoprotein-hexose phosphotransferage component of N-regulated peroximal targeting signal (PTS) system.Transcription is the first stage in gene expression and the principal step at which it is controlled. The gene for major cold shock protein (cspA) attains a significantly high expression level (RCBS = 1.28). The gene cspA is a regulator needed for adaptation to atypical conditions and gives a response to temperature stimulus. CspC coding for other stress proteins and a member of the cspA family is also a highly expressed gene. Among other genes involved in the transcription process RNA polymerase plays a vital role. RNA synthesis is catalysed by the enzyme RNA polymerase. Transcription starts when RNA polymerase binds to the promoter. Among the DNA-directed RNA polymerase rpoB, rpoC, rpoD, rpoH and rpoZ subunits in E. coli qualify the high expression level. RNA polymerase must be able to handle situations when transcription is blocked, e.g. when DNA is damaged. In the case of E. coli RNA polymerase, the proteins greA and greB, which have been predicted to have a high expression level, release polymerase from elongation arrest. Rho, transcription termination factor, attains a moderate expression level (RCBS = 0.4749). Termination and anti-termination are closely connected and involve proteins that interact with RNA polymerase. Anti-termination is used as a control mechanism and controls the ability of the enzyme to read past a terminator into genes lying beyond. The nus loci code for proteins that form part of the transcription apparatus. The nusA, nusb, nusG functions are concerned solely with the transmission of transcription. Transcription anti-termination protein (nusB) and transcription termination factor (nusG) have high expression levels. NusB is required for rho-dependent terminators whereas nusG may be considered with the general assembly of all the nus factors into a complex with RNA polymerase. NusA required for intrinsic terminators has a moderate expression level (RCBS = 0.4658).3.3. CH/degradation protein genesCH/degradation proteins are vital in cell physiology. CHs are proteins that assist the non-covalent folding/unfolding and assembly/disassembly of other macromolecular structures. One major function of CH is to prevent both newly synthesized polypeptide chains and assembled subunits from aggregating into non-functional structures. Many CHs are heat shock proteins, that is, proteins expressed in response to elevated temperatures or other cellular stresses. The reason for this behaviour is that protein folding is severely affected by heat and, therefore, some CHs act to repair the potential damage caused by misfolding. Other CHs are involved in folding newly made proteins as they are extruded from the ribosome. Although most newly synthesized proteins can fold in the absence of CHs, a minority strictly requires them. DnaK (HSP70), perhaps the best characterized CH in E. coli, is identified as a highly expressed gene. The Hsp70 proteins are aided by Hsp40 proteins (DnaJ in E. coli), which increase the ATP (adenosine triphosphate) consumption rate and activity of the Hsp70s. But, dnaJ has a lo",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 expression level (RCBS = 0.3988). It has been noted that increased expression of Hsp70 proteins in the cell results in a decreased tendency towards apoptosis. Although a precise mechanistic understanding has yet to be determined, it is known that Hsp70s have a high-affinity bound state to unfolded proteins when bound to adenosine diphosphate ribosyl, and a low-affinity state when bound to ATP. It is thought that many Hsp70s crowd around an unfolded substrate, stabilizing it and preventing aggregation until the unfolded molecule folds properly, at which time the Hsp70s lose affinity for the molecule and diffuse away. Other highly expressed heat shock proteins are groS, groL, hslO (Hsp33) htpG (Hsp90). GroS and groL are the small subunits of GroESL. These are the best characterized heat shock protein complexes in E. coli, identified as highly expressed genes. HtpG in E. coli is the least well-understood CH. Hsp90, a molecular CH, might be essential for activating many signalling proteins in the eukaryotic cell and is necessary for viability in eukaryotes. Since it is predicted to be a highly expressed gene, it is possibly necessary for prokaryotes as well.Protein degradation plays an important role in cell cycle, in signal transduction and in maintaining the integrity of the proper folded state of a protein. Out of 100 genes involved in macromolecular degradation only six genes qualify as highly expressed genes. In Table 1, the predicted expression levels of highly expressed degradation genes are reported. Among these the genes encoding xseB (exonuclease VII small subunit) and rusA (DLP12 prophage, endonuclease RUS) are enzymes which regulate the degradation of DNA. These are also involved in DNA repair activity. Pnp and csrA are the only two proteins qualifying as highly expressed genes involved in RNA degradation. Pnp, polynucleotide phosphorylase/polyadenylase, is fundamental in RNA processing. Polyadenylation plays an important role in initiating degradation of some RNAs. Triple mutations that remove Pnp have a strong effect on stability. Poly(A)polymerase may create a poly (A) tail that acts as a binding site for the nucleases. DegP, serine endoprotease (Protease D0) encodes an enzyme which is involved in protein and peptide degradation and is predicted to be required for global protein degradation. It responds to temperature stimulus. YhbO, YajG, a predicted lipoprotein and YhbO, a predicted intercellular protease are thought to be involved in degradation of proteins and polysaccharides.3.4. Aminoacyl tRNA synthetases and modification genesThere are 37 genes encoding the tRNA synthetases and other enzymes involved in tRNA modification. Results have been reported in Table 1. Compared with 19 PHX genes as predicted by Karlin et al.,18 only three genes register as highly expressed genes in our expression measure. These include aspartyl tRNA synthetase (aspS), lysine tRNA synthetase (lysS) and valyl tRNA synthetase (valS). The gene encoding glysine tRNA synthetase (glyS) is also predicted to be a highly expressed gene marginally with RCBS = 0.4974. Among other tRNA synthetase genes phes, glyQ, glnS, leus, serS, pros, tyrS, gltX and metG have moderate expression levels. PheM, phenylalanyl tRNA synthetase operon leader peptide registers a high RCB score with RCBS = 2.1835.3.5. Outer membrane proteinThere are ∼13 highly expressed genes encoding outer membrane proteins, as predicted by our expression measure. The expression levels of these genes have been displayed in Table 1. These include outer membrane protein (ompA, ompC, ompF, ompX), outer membrane lipoprotein (slyB), truncated outer membrane porin (nmpC), palmitoyl transferase for Lipid A (pagP), scaffolding protein for murein synthesizing machinery (mipA) and tsx. Moreover, yqiG, a predicted outer membrane user protein, yqhH, a predicted outer membrane lipoprotein, and yddL, a predicted putative outer membrane protein have been predicted as highly expressed genes in our analysis.3.6. Inner membrane proteinAmong the genes encoding inner membrane protein, murein lipoprotein (lpp) has the highest expression level (RCBS = 0.6320). Other than conserved inner membrane protein, 34 inner membrane protein genes have been listed in Table 1 as highly expressed genes. There are ∼83 conserved inner membrane proteins in the E. coli genome. Out of those, 17 have been predicted to be highly expressed genes (Supplementary Table SVII).3.7. Amino acid biosynthesisOverall, 20 of the 255 amino acid biosynthesis genes are expressed at a higher level. The artM, an arginine transporter subunit, flyM, a cystine transporter subunit, glnH and glnP, the glutamine transporter subunits are predicted to be expressed at higher levels. The glnA gene, which encodes glutamine synthetase, and glnB, which encodes regulatory protein for glumine synthetase, are expressed at higher levels. Interestingly, hisL, his operon ladder peptide; ilvL, ilvG operon ladder peptide; ivbL, ilvB operon ladder peptide; leuL, leu operon ladder peptide; pheL, pheA gene ladder peptide; thrL, thr operon ladder peptide; and trpl, trp operon ladder peptide are expressed at higher levels. The monocystronic gene ilvC, which is depressed exclusively by valine has a high value of expression score. The dapD product,2,3,4,5-tetrahydropyridine-2-carboxylate N-succinyl transferage, which encodes the enzyme for lysine biosynthesis process via diaminopimelate has a high expression level.3.8. Nucleotide biosynthesisAccording to MIPS classification, ∼31 genes encode enzymes for nucleotide biosynthesis. In our study, we observe that five genes namely purA, purC, adk, ndk and guaB encoding enzymes which are involved in Purine ribonucleotide biosynthesis and pyrL, pyrBI operon leader peptide for Pyrimidine ribonucleotide biosynthesis, are highly expressed genes. PyrL has a significantly high expression level with RCBS = 1.16.3.9. Genes for energy metabolism and metabolism of carbon compoundsOf the 392 genes involved in metabolism of carbon compound, 39 genes have a significantly high expression level. Of those, 27 are involved in carbohydrate metabolism, 10 are involved in amino acid metabolism, and two are involved in amines metabolism. Lpd is involved both in carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism. Rest one is involved in other carbon compound metabolism. No genes involved in fatty acid metabolism attain a high expression level, but seven of the 27 genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis have a significantly high expression level. The data presented here indicate that accA (acetyl-CoA carboxylase), which encodes one component of acetyl coenzyme A carboxilase is a highly expressed gene. In addition, ymcE, which is cold shock protein and aspS also attain a high expression level. Although less is known about fab genes except the FadR activation on fabA, we predict that some of fab genes (fabA, fabI, fabZ) have a significant expression level. This is consistent with genomic expression profiling obtained from DNA microarray analysis of Tao et al.343.10. Energy metabolism genesThe genes involved in energy metabolism are primarily divided into four groups: glycolysis, pyruvate dehydronage, the pentose phosphate pathway and the TCA cycle. Of the 1530 genes that are involved in energy metabolism, 163 have been predicted to be highly expressed genes in our approach. Two basic metabolic pathways glycolysis and TCA cycle involve eight and four highly expressed genes respectively, whereas the genes in glycolysis and pyruvate metabolism are predominantly highly expressed genes. These include the genes for eno, fbaA, gapA, gpmA, pfkA, pykF, tpiA, pgk.Unlike Karlin et al. the proteins involved in the initial steps of glycolysis (pgi coding glucophosphate isomerage and the proteins involved in the initial steps of TCA cycle (gltA, citrate synthase) are not highly expressed genes in our observation. Besides having the most TCA cycle, pyruvate dehydronage and glycolysis, E. coli genome has several highly expressed genes of anaerobic and aerobic respiration. Among NADH dehydrogenase nuo complex nuoA, nuoI and nuoK are highly expressed genes. Genes encoding α, β and ε subunits of F1 sector of membrane bound ATP synthase and b and c subunits of F0 sector of membrane bound ATP synthase genes have been predicted to be highly expressed genes. With respect to electron transport flavodoxin 1 (fldA) and cytochrome o ubiquinol oxidase subunit III (cyoC) are highly expressed gene with RCBS values 0.6062 and 0.5316, respectively. In addition, cytochrome c biogenesis protein (ccmD), and cytochrome o ubiquinol oxidase subunit IV (cyoD) also register high expression level in our approach.In marked contrast to Kerlin et al., E. coli has six highly expressed flagellar genes flgB, fliE, fliJ, fliQ, fliS, fliT. The flagellum secretion apparatus may be viewed as part of the CH family essential for bacterial viability. Assembly of a flagellum is required to export protein subunits to the outer surface of the cell. Recent evidence indicates that flagellum regulon can also influence bacterium–host interactions independent of motility.3.11. Fatty acid biosynthesisFatty acid metabolism is crucial because not only does it provide various fatty acids and phospholipids necessary for cell growth, but it also serves as a source of precursors for biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. The highly expressed genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis included genes encoding beta-hydroxydecanoyl thioester dehydrase (fabA), NADH-dependent enoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] reductase (fabI), (3R)-hydroxymyristol acyl carrier protein dehydratase (fabZ), holo-[acyl-carrier-protein] synthase 1(acpS), accA, cold shock gene (ymcE). Besides 3-oxoacyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] synthase I (fabB) has moderately high value of RCBS (RCBS = 0.4954).3.12. Central intermediary metabolismSeveral highly expressed genes in this functional class are also involved in carbohydrate metabolism. Besides other genes in this class which are also involved in nitrogen metabolism, phosphorus metabolism, amino acid metabolism, etc., our analysis identified the key genes involved in central intermediary metabolism, encoding aspartate ammonia-lyase (aspA), citrate lyase (citD, citE), glycine cleavage complex lipoylprotein (gcvH), Ni-dependent glyoxalase I (gloA), 3-keto-l-gulonate 6-phosphate decarboxylase (ulaD), d-erythro-7,8-dihydroneopterin triphosphate 2′;-epimerase and dihydroneopterin aldolase (folX) and d-erythro-7,8-dihydroneopterin triphosphate 2′;-epimerase and dihydroneopterin aldolase (mutT) as highly expressed genes. FixX, 4Fe-4S ferredoxin-type protein is also registered as a highly expressed gene predicted to be involved in central intermediary metabolism.3.13. Genomic repair proteinsAn event that introduces a deviation from the usual double-helical structure of DNA is a threat to the genetic constitution of the cell. The repair system is thus very important for the survival of the cell. The repair system can recognize a range of distortions in DNA as signal for action, and is likely to have several systems able to deal with DNA damage. Table 1 reports the highly expressed repair proteins in E. coli genome. Other repair proteins have low to moderate expression levels. Of the 51 genes involved in DNA repair, only six genes reach a high expression level. The principal pathway for recombination repair in E. coli is identified by the rec genes. recA, predicted to be highly expressed genes in our approach is not only involved in recombination–repair activities, but also has another quite distinct function. It can be activated by many treatments that damage DNA or inhibit replication in E. coli. This causes it to trigger a complex series of phenotype changes called the SOS response, which involves the expression of many genes whose products include repair function. The other highly expressed repair genes in E. coli are xseB, dinl, yebG, dinJ, rusA. DinI, DNA damage-inducible protein I, and dinJ, predicted antitoxin of YafQ–DinJ toxin antitoxin system act on damaged DNA and involved in repairing damaged DNA. YebG, a conserved protein regulated by LexA functions as DNA repair.3.14. Regulatory proteinAbout 440 genes in E. coli encode regulatory proteins. Among these regulatory proteins 62 genes are predicted to be highly expressed genes. Several of the genes in this class also function in translation, transcription, DNA repair, replication/recombination, cell process, etc. The predicted expression levels of several other highly expressed genes of specific regulatory proteins are listed in Table 1.3.15. Biosynthesis of vitamins, cofactors and small moleculesVitamin biosynthesis proteins have largely low expression levels. Only ribE, riboflavin synthetase, is highly expressed. This is in contrast to the result of Karlin et al.18 Pathways for the synthesis of vitamins of which only small amounts are generally needed to achieve adequate function, record low RCBS values ranging from 0.1801 to 0.5974. Some of the enzymes that utilize the vitamins as cofactors are highly expressed, e.g. accB, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, BCCP subunit of E. coli is registered as highly expressed gene in our approach with RCBS = 0.5533. Expression of the 10 highly expressed genes involved in the biosynthesis of cofactors and small molecules are listed in Table 1.3.16. Biosynthesis of other macromoleculesAmong the genes encoding proteins for macromolecular biosynthesis, lpp attains significantly high RCBS value (RCBS = 1.6320). In addition to it, other highly expressed genes involved in macromolecular biosynthesis genes are major type 1 subunit fimbrin (fimA), DNA-binding transcriptional repressor (iscR) and truncated cytochrome b562 cytochrome (cybC). GlsG, a predicted glycogen synthesis protein and yfgJ, another predicted protein thought to be involved in macromolecular biosynthesis also attain the score of high expression level.Of the 39 cryptic genes in E. coli analysed in our model, only three register as highly expressed genes. Those are csgA, a criptic curlin major subunit which is involved in glycoprotein biosynthesis, mokC, a regulatory protein of hokC, and gspl, a putative transport protein. The expression levels of these genes are 0.7, 0.62 and 0.55, respectively.Among the genes induced under starvation conditions only dps, Fe-binding and storage protein (RCBS=0.5544) which provides DNA protection during starvation proteins, rpoH, RNA polymerase, sigma 32 (sigma H) factor (RCBS = 0.5129) are predicted as highly expressed genes in agreement with Karlin et al.18 Other starvation protein genes [otsA (RCBS = 0.2349), otsB (RCBS = 0.2700), rpoE (RCBS = 0.2781), rpoN (RCBS = 0.2486), rpoS (RCBS = 0.4093), katE (RCBS = 0.2359), surA (RCBS = 0.3936), bolA (RCBS = 0.4342)] have low to moderate expression levels. The survival protein surA which is registered as PHX with E(g) = 1.10 does not qualify as a highly expressed gene in our approach. Besides, we also observe that a number of genes encoding prophases are recorded as highly expressed genes in our analysis. A phase DNA molecule is often integrated into the DNA molecule of bacterium forming a prophase. A list of highly expressed genes encoding different prophases in E. coli is displayed in Table 2.Predicted expression levels of highly expressed prophage genesPredicted expression levels of highly expressed prophage genesApart from these classified genes, a fraction of poorly characterized genes which are generally annotated based on strong sequence similarity is also found among predicted highly expressed genes. Many of these genes encode predicted proteins and some are poorly characterized hypothetical genes. (A list of highly expressed genes which are thought to encode predicted proteins is given in supplementary Supplementary Table SVII). Our analysis thus provides strong support for significant roles of these genes which may be highly relevant for E. coli.The large data set analysed here shows a clear connection between relative codon usage difference and gene expression level. Codon frequencies are found to vary between genes in the same genome and between genomes. Thus overall nucleotide composition of the genome which influences codon usage pattern introduces selective forces acting on highly expressed genes to improve efficiency of translation. This is also evident from the observation that shorter coding sequence has greater RCBS value, i.e. shorter genes have high expression level4,5,40,41 and this is consistent with the fact that the cost of producing a protein is proportional to its length.Interestingly, we observe that besides highly expressed protein coding genes all tRNA genes (listed in Table 3) are also registered with very high RCBS values. This observation suggests that usage of preferred codons in these and highly expressed genes is positively correlated and the highly expressed genes use a preferred set of optimal codons in accordance with their respective tRNA levels. Moreover, this result might find another important application in tRNA genes. Besides measuring expression levels of a gene, RCBS score can be remarkably used to remove the false positives in tRNA finding algorithm. Moreover, several genes of unknown functions with predicted high expression levels may be attractive candidates for experimental characterization because we assume that they have important functions in those organisms. Table 4 lists such gene families of unknown functions. This kind of analysis is valuable in helping to identify the promising candidate genes to be focused for further experimental characterization.Predicted expression levels of tRNA genesPredicted expression levels of tRNA genesPredicted expression levels of highly expressed hypothetical protein genesPredicted expression levels of highly expressed hypothetical protein genes4. DiscussionOur analysis supports that each genome has evolved codon usage patterns indicating gene expression levels. The three protein families – RPs, major translation/transcription processing factors, and CH/degradation proteins which are fundamental at many stages of the life style in promoting growth and stability, have been identified as highly expressed genes. Although the concept of predicting gene expression from codon usage was proposed a decade ago, only recently these methods have been successfully applied to the identification of highly expressed genes in various bacteria and eukaryotic organisms. But, any such codon usage-based prediction of gene expression relies on a prior definition of a reference set, consisting of highly expressed genes. For instance, CAI listed a set of 27 highly expressed genes for E. coli, which includes gene encoding 17 RPs, four elongation factors, four outer membrane protein, recA, and dnaK. For yeast a set of 24 highly expressed genes has been taken as a reference set. These include 16 genes encoding RPs, one for an elongation factor, two enolase genes, two GA-3-PDH genes, ADH 1, PCK, pyruvate kinase.3 Karlin and coworkers17–23 included transcription/translation-related factors and CHs in the reference set, in addition to the RP genes. MILC-based expression level predictor MELP13 is based on a reference set consisting of all genes coding for RPs, longer than 100 codons. Although the composition of the reference set is based on the functional assignment of the genes, but there is no specific algorithm to construct a reference set for individual species. The outcome is highly dependent on the genome examined. In some instances, in the use of alternative reference sets results are very poor. In principle it is not possible to regulate protein expression level by the judicious use of certain codons. It is worth emphasizing that individual genes tend to favour characteristic codon distributions and there is a strong connection between protein expressivity and the degree of codon bias. So, we emphasize that codon assignment as well as codon preferences should be taken into account in a single measure which will have functional feedback between the constraints of gene expression and microstructure of genomes. To better understand potential expression levels of genes, we developed a methodology that relates codon usage as well as large-scale DNA compositional biases among gene classes to the expression potential of individual genes. The CAI3 and codon usage models13,17 are originally based on somewhat qualitative assumptions about the expression levels of relatively few genes. This is our motivation for using a quantitative measure (RCBS) to recalculate genome-wide expression data. The new approach begins with the assumption, based on the argument just presented; that the general codon usage features observed in highly expressed genes greatly differ from that of randomly generated sequences with their sequence composition conserved. Our proposition is based on the fact that the difference between the geometric average of normalized frequency of codons (fxyz) in a sequence of nucleotides and that of f1(x) × f2(y) × f3(z) is >0.5 of the geometric average of f1(x) × f2(y) × f3(z) for highly expressed genes. The proposed threshold value (0.5) of RCBS is investigated for E. coli genome, Yeast genome and archeal genomes. The data (available on request) provide the evidence in favour of potential strength of our expression measure over the others. The most of the housekeeping genes fall in the category of highly expressed genes. The study also identifies a number of functionally unknown genes as highly expressed genes based on their codon profile. Thus, it often seems sufficient that our approach is a better alternative to the existing expression models. Surprisingly, we have found that there is a strong negative correlation between relative codon usage bias and protein length in contradiction with others.24,42 Although our primary motivation in developing this novel method was to compensate the possible artefacts due to sequence length variability, we have observed that highly expressed genes (identified by RCBS) show negative correlation with gene length leading to a biological relevance. This is suggested to be due to more effective translational selection acting to reduce size of the abundant proteins, to minimize transcriptional and translational energy costs. Although the longer sequences appear to be better optimized in terms of having codons for more abundant tRNAs which increase their probability in proper and timely translation, it is easier for a ribosome to translate a short RNA sequences, as opposed to decrease in fidelity for longer translation. Therefore it is likely that there is a natural selection for the shorter genes to be expressed at higher level.41To summarize, we have introduced a novel method, based on codon usage difference with regard to random base composition at three codon sites, to estimate the level of expression of a gene. In this article, predicted highly expressed genes are characterized for E. coli genome only, but the method equally applies to other microbes to be reported in separate communication. By comparing its performance with other commonly used measures of gene expression, we have established that RCBS is a generally applicable method, being resistant to species specific and introduces little noise into measurements. It is remarkable that the present model usually performs as well as other codon usage model of Kerlin et al.18 sometime lead to a better correlation with expression data according to several other measures based on CAI.3 The prediction of expression level in our approach can be appreciated by comparing them with the protein abundance data and microarray data. Thus, our method is effectively complementary to the experimental procedures of 2D gel electrophoresis and DNA microarray analysis in assessing gene expression levels. In contrast to other existing measures, our model describes the global enrichment of a codon in highly expressed genes with no restrictions on composition of the other codons. Of course, the codon-based expression indicators yield static value, whereas gene expression is a dynamic process with very different expression levels under different conditions. In our view codon usage pattern of genomes evolves as a result of interplay between mutational and selective forces and the proper account of the adaptive response to the codon assignment can lead to a practical solution of gene expression.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available online at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingFinancial support by the University Grants Commission, India, sanction No. F.PSW-060/05-06 (ERO)," is gratefully acknowledged.The authors would like to acknowledge the reviewers for their valuable suggestions and comments to improve the manuscript.Supplementary data"""

IntroductionPlastid genes are embedded in regulatory networks that enable adaptive and developmentally flexible chloroplast biogenesis. Coordination of plastid and nuclear gene expression on both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels is important for chloroplast function.1–4The activity of the plastid-encoded RNA polymerase (PEP) depends on nucleus-encoded sigma factors, which are mainly involved in global, tissue-specific, as well as environmentally and developmentally dependent regulation of transcription.5–11 Moreover, two newly acquired nucleus-encoded phage-type RNA polymerases (NEP, represented by RpoTp and RpoTmp) are involved in the regulation of plastid transcription, adding a further layer of complexity to chloroplast RNA metabolism.12–17Another important characteristic of chloroplast gene regulation is the predominance of post-transcriptional control.18–20 Although nuclear mutants in higher plants often show pleiotropic phenotypes, there is increasing evidence that numerous nuclear genes for chloroplast proteins control post-transcriptional processing and stabilization of individual plastid transcripts.1,21–25DNA array technologies of chloroplast transcriptomes have so far largely been restricted to individual conditions and/or single mutations affecting chloroplast functions.20,26–29 Moreover, in contrast to in-depth studies on nuclear gene expression, relatively little genome-wide information is available regarding the co-regulated expression of groups of plastid genes. Since the expression of nuclear and chloroplast genes must be tightly coupled, comparative array-based analysis of both genomes should provide a framework for the understanding of the integrated gene regulatory network. Affymetrix 22K ATH1 is an Arabidopsis oligonucleotide array containing more than 22 500 probe sets and is currently well used for global evaluation of gene expression from plants grown under various conditions. In order to elucidate the interactive networks and to identify novel Arabidopsis mutants impaired in chloroplast gene expression, we have established macroarrays and complemented our results with data acquired using the Affymetrix 22K ATH1 array for expression profiling.30Distinct expression profiles highlight clusters of plastid genes that are potential targets for concerted nuclear control.2. Materials and methods2.1. Sources of Arabidopsis mutants, phenotypes and plant growth conditionsMutant plants were characterized on the basis of their color and the maximum quantum yield (Fv/Fm) of photosystem II (Supplementary Table S1).31 Wild-type (WT) and mutant seeds were surface-sterilized before plating on an MS medium supplemented with 15 g sucrose/L. Plates were incubated at 4°C for 2 days in the dark, and then placed in a climate chamber under continuous light (60 µmol photons m−2 s−1) at 22°C.2.2. RNA isolation and gel blot analysisTotal RNA was extracted from frozen plant tissues using TRIzol® Reagent according to the manufacturer’s (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) instructions. Northern analysis was performed using radio-labeled DNA probes as described.242.3. Preparation of macroarray filtersNinety-four probes for genes encoding plastid proteins, tRNAs and rRNAs were amplified from DNA of WT plants (accession Columbia) using gene-specific oligonucleotides (data available upon request). Intron-containing genes were amplified with the Titan One Tube RT–PCR Kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Size and quality of PCR products purified with PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) were checked by electrophoresis on 1.2% agarose gels, and three different dilutions (30.0, 7.5 and 1.87 ng/µL) were prepared. Probes were spotted onto 11.9 cm x 7.8 cm positively charged nylon membranes (Hybond™-N+Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Munich, Germany) using a 96-pin tool (0.4 mm pins) with a BioGrid Spotting Device Roboter (BioRobotics, Boston, USA) as described.27,32 Each probe was spotted 20 times in duplicate giving 1.25, 5 or 20 ng per spot (Supplementary Fig. S1A and B). The spotted DNA was denatured (1.5 M NaCl, 0.5 M NaOH), neutralized (0.5 M Tris–HCl pH 7.2, 1 M NaCl) and fixed with UV light (120 mJ, 302 nm, UV Stratalinker 1800, Stratagene, La Jolla, USA).2.4. Hybridization of labeled cDNAs to macroarray filtersBefore hybridization, macroarray filters were incubated at 65°C for 1 h in 10 ml of buffer (0.25 M Na2HPO4 pH 7.2, 7% SDS). [α-32P] dCTP-labeled cDNAs were synthesized at 50°C for 1 h, with hexanucleotide primers (Roche) and 20 µg of total RNA as template, using SuperScript™ III RNase H− Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). After inactivation of the transcriptase at 70°C for 20 min, the labeled cDNAs were incubated at 37°C for 20 min with RNase H (Invitrogen) to remove RNA. cDNAs were purified on MicroSpin™ G-25 columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and used for hybridization (12 h at 65°C in hybridization buffer). Filters were washed separately at 65°C for 20 min each in three different washing buffers (2× SSC, 0.1% SDS; 1.0× SSC, 0.1% SDS; 0.5× SSC, 0.1% SDS).2.5. Normalization and statistical analysisTo maximize the precision of array data, probes were spotted in three different concentrations and in duplicate. The radioactive images were scanned with an FLA-3000 phosphoimager (Fuji, Tokyo, Japan), and the AIDA Image Analyzer (3.52) software was used for background correction and normalization of the signals. The mean value of three selected background dots within each sub-grid was used for background subtraction. Background-corrected hybridization signals were normalized using R/MAANOVA version 0.98.8 implemented in the R program (www.r-project.org).33 The robust locally weighted regression (LOWESS) method in R/MAANOVA was applied for normalization.34 After performing standard t-tests, adjusted P-values for each gene were calculated from ratios of six individual spots using a web-based microarray analysis toolbox (http://nbc11.biologie.uni-kl.de).2.6. Microarray data analysisATH1 (22 k) expression data from Arabidopsis thaliana were obtained from Genevestigator, GEO and AtGenExpress databases, using data for mutants and a variety of biological conditions.35,36 For identification of co-expressed genes located within operons, the MAS 5.0 method is recommended.37 Therefore, all microarray data were normalized by the MAS 5.0 method using Simpleaffy implemented in the R program.38 Expression profiles of 79 plastid genes were selected for cluster analysis. Fold changes were first converted to log2 and expressed relative to the mean value for normalization. Several clustering methods (hierarchical, SOM, K-means and Terrain clustering) were implemented using the program Genesis.39–41 The latter Terrain clustering method was recently successfully applied in DNA microarray experiments of Caenorhabditis elegans. Co-regulated genes were grouped together and visualized in a three-dimensional expression map that displays correlations of gene expression profiles as distances in two dimensions and gene density in the third dimension.423. Results3.1. Plant growth and mutant phenotypesUnless otherwise indicated, leaves from 3-week-old WT and mutant plants grown in a climate chamber (Percival, Iowa, USA) under continuous light (60 µmol photons m−2 s−1) were used for our analyses. Salient information on mutants, their sources and phenotypic characteristics including photosynthetic parameters is given in Supplementary Table S1, together with details of the growth and stress conditions employed. Most of the genes affected in the mutants studied are essential for photoautotrophic growth. Such mutants survived only when grown on medium supplemented with sucrose. The mutants exhibited three major phenotypes: albino mutants arrested at an early stage of chloroplast development, hcf (high chlorophyll fluorescence) mutants with impaired photosynthetic electron transport capacity and yellow to pale-green lines with defects in various, often unknown, chloroplast functions (Supplementary Table S1).433.2. Construction of plastid macroarraysDNA macroarrays bearing probes for genes encoding all plastid proteins, ribosomal RNAs and 11 tRNAs were constructed for comprehensive expression analyses of various Arabidopsis mutants affected in chloroplast development and function, and WT plants grown under various environmental conditions (Supplementary Fig. S1A and B). Mutant names and gene functions are listed in Supplementary Table S2. In order to ensure statistical reliability for the evaluation of expression levels, three different concentrations of each gene probe were spotted in duplicate onto filters, background subtraction for each gene grid was performed, P-values were calculated taking into account all spots and selected experiments were repeated several times (Supplementary Fig. S1). Moreover, scatter-plot analyses were performed routinely (Supplementary Fig. S1C).3.3. Expression profiling of plastid genes from plants grown under various biological conditionsIn addition to non-photosynthetic mutants, different WT tissues (stems, leaves and flowers), and WT plants exposed to various hormones (gibberellin, abscisic acid, auxin and cytokinin), herbicides 3-(3′, 4′-dichlorphenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU) and methylviologen (N,N′-dimethyl-4,4′-bipyridinium, MV), biological stresses (heat, light, cold and dark) or treated with sucrose for defined times, were used to study plastid gene expression patterns (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2).In the flower, some photosynthetic genes tended to be down-regulated and non-photosynthetic genes were preferentially up-regulated when compared with leaves (Fig. 1A). Most of the chosen stress conditions induced significant deviations from the expression pattern observed under standard conditions (Fig. 1B–F). Similarly, excess light, which induces photoinhibition and formation of reactive oxygen species, caused both a reduction in photosynthetic gene expression and an induction of genes required for RNA and protein synthesis in the chloroplast (Fig. 1B). Compared with light stress, DCMU, preventing reduction of plastoquinone, had comparable but milder effects on the expression of plastid genes (Fig. 1C).44 Auxin plays an essential role in the coordination of numerous developmental processes in the plant life cycle.45 Although auxin treatment had a strong bleaching effect, the expression of most plastid genes was not significantly changed indicating that translational and post-translational processes are prevalent to cope with the hormone treatment. However, the 4.5S and 5S ribosomal RNAs were much more abundant following treatment with auxin (Fig. 1D). In contrast, several other stress conditions, including heat (Fig. 1E), cold (Fig. 1F) and sucrose depletion, significantly affected the expression of numerous plastid genes (Supplementary Table S2). Interestingly, differential expression of many plastid genes was more pronounced in WT plants exposed to various physical stress conditions (e.g. light, heat and cold) than in several non-photosynthetic mutants [e.g. hcf145 and cyt160 (cyt b6f mutant)] (Figs. 1 and 2).24Changes in plastid transcript levels in tissues and leaves exposed to the indicated stressors. (A–F) Log2-transformed fold changes in plastid RNA levels were determined in flowers when compared with leaves (A), and in leaves subjected to high light stress (B), DCMU treatment (C), auxin treatment (D), heat (E) and cold stress (F) when compared with untreated control leaves. High expression ratios are indicated by arrows. Detailed information on the stress conditions employed is given in Supplementary Table S1. In all six histograms, genes are listed according to their positions on the plastid chromosome.Changes in plastid transcript levels in tissues and leaves exposed to the indicated stressors.

Cluster analyses of plastid genes based on the analysis of 89 transcriptomesFor all data sets, we calculated P-values as a measure of the significance of the differential expression of plastid genes in 75 mutants, 3 WT tissues and WT plants placed under 12 different stresses (see previous section) relative to levels in WT plants grown under standard conditions. Filtering of genes with P-values below 0.05 or showing more than 1.5-fold expression changes did not significantly affect clustering of co-expressed plastid genes. Therefore, we included all data sets in our clustering analysis to permit a more comprehensive and subtle expression analysis of the plastid genome.K-means clustering of all 89 transcriptomes identified two groups, I and II, which displayed essentially opposite expression patterns (Fig. 3A). Most of the mutants in group I (∼70%) exhibited an albino phenotype. The majority of genes up-regulated in group I had non-photosynthetic functions, whereas most down-regulated genes coded for photosynthetic proteins.Expression profiles of 94 plastid genes in 89 transcriptomes. (A) Transcript levels in 75 mutants and in WT plants exposed to 14 different biological conditions were determined by macroarray analysis. Fold change values were transformed to log2 and normalized relative to the mean value of genes and experiments. Non-hierarchical K-means clustering (K=2) was performed as described in the ‘Results’. Fold changes close to, higher and lower than the mean values are represented by black, red and green colors, respectively. Co-expressed plastid genes were distributed into two major clusters A and B, which were further divided into eight classes (A–H). Cluster A (green bar) and cluster B (red bar) contain each four classes. Detailed information can be found in Table 1 and Supplementary Table S3.

The arrows indicate the two distinct transcriptome groups.Group II comprises transcriptomes of WT plants exposed to a variety of stress conditions and mutants affected in various chloroplast functions. Mutants of group II often showed a pale or hcf phenotype. The behavior of the albino mutants in group II (∼21%), like alb3 and vipp1, deviates from the group I signature typical for most albino mutants.46,47 Unlike those in group I, the albino mutants in group II did not show marked differential expression of plastid genes. Interestingly, early arrest of chloroplast development and the acquisition of an albino phenotype are not necessarily correlated with the expression signature of group I. Most mutants in group II exhibited similar expression patterns, showing less striking expression changes and a smaller number of significantly differentially expressed genes than mutants of group I (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Table S2), which is consistent with primary defects in the gene expression system in mutants of group I. The data also imply that related genetic defects affecting chloroplast functions and resulting in comparable phenotypes exhibit similar expression patterns, like those of albino or hcf mutants, which are characteristic for mutants in group I or II, respectively.K-means clustering identified two major gene clusters, A and B, of similar sizes that exhibited opposite patterns of expression (Fig. 3A and Table 1). Cluster A contains 30 genes involved in gene expression, 6 ATP synthase and 6 NDH genes. Cluster B comprises genes for 31 components of linear and cyclic electron transport, rbcL and 16 non-photosynthetic genes.Functional categories and distribution of plastid genes within the two clusters shown in Fig. 3Functional categories and distribution of plastid genes within the two clusters shown in Fig. 3Remarkably, most Arabidopsis genes known to be transcribed by the NEP are present in cluster A, whereas genes transcribed preferentially by the PEP are found in cluster B.17,48,49 With the exception of rrn16S and ycf1, Arabidopsis genes that contain both NEP and PEP promoters are found in cluster A. In accordance with this, the expression pattern of group I mutants is indicative of a loss of the PEP activity since the expression profile is almost identical to mutants affected in the PEP activity.12,27 Therefore, most group I mutants are affected, either primarily or secondarily, in general RNA metabolism.K-means clustering further sub-classified plastid genes into eight distinct, co-regulated and often functionally associated gene classes; classes A–D are found in cluster A and classes E–H in cluster B (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Table S3). The averaged expression ratios for each class provide a differential expression view (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Table S3). Clustered genes generally derived from the same polycistronic operons (e.g. psbB-, psbD-, atpB-, petG, atpA-, ndhC- and the ribosomal S10 operons) (Supplementary Tables S3 and S4). There are also numerous exceptions, like rbcL/accD, psbE/psbF, psaB/rps14, petA/ycf10 and others. In these cases it is likely that processed monocistronic transcripts of a polycistronic transcription unit undergo different half-lives so that their levels do not correlate with co-transcriptional control. This has also been confirmed genetically since nuclear mutants exist that are specifically affected in the stability of individual RNA segment intervals of polycistronic precursors.1,2,21–24Co-expression of ndhH and ndhA in cluster A and association of ndhI, ndhG, ndhE and ndhD expressed farther downstream of the DNA strand of the former two in cluster B may designate a hitherto unidentified internal PEP promoter within the ndhH operon (Table 1).The sizes and membership of clusters that emerge from clustering analysis are known to strongly depend on the program and parameters utilized. We therefore performed clustering analyses with additional methods to confirm the identification of co-regulated genes, using self-organizing map (SOM) and hierarchical clustering methods.50 We confirmed the existence of two distinct oppositely expressed gene clusters (A and B), and both methods assign essentially the same sets of genes to the two clusters (Fig. 3C, Table 1). Each peak in the terrain map represents a transcriptome and peak heights reflect the dynamics of gene expression. The two-dimensional orientations and distances between peaks, which reflect relationships between transcriptomes, indicate that members of group I are quite unrelated to those of group II (Fig. 3D). The biological significance of the terrain cluster analysis is the existence of two distinguishable groups of related transcriptomes and data obtained are consistent with SOM and hierarchical clustering methods (Fig. 3D).According to the original expression data clustering is largely based on an opposite expression of genes in albino mutants of group I relative to gene members of group II. Notably, clustering of transcriptomes of WT plants adapted to various detrimental conditions failed to assign two main clusters of transcriptomes and genes (data not shown) indicating that post-transcriptional control of plastid gene expression prevails under changing environmental conditions. This finding is consistent with data obtained by using microarry expression profiles (see below).3.5. Identification of mutants affected in the chloroplast RNA metabolismMost mutants of group I exhibiting pleiotropic effects are affected in general plastid gene expression and most likely in plastid RNA metabolism. To distinguish mutants primarily affected in plastid RNA metabolism from those perturbed in other plastid functions, we used the mutants pac,51atprfB122,52 and hcf14524 as controls, which are known to be primarily affected in plastid RNA degradation and processing. The data obtained from the macroarray analysis of these mutants are in good agreement with those obtained previously by northern and quantitative RT–PCR analysis (Fig. 2).22,24,51 For example, the expression of most photosynthetic genes was severely reduced (>2.5-fold) but many genes encoding ribosomal proteins, sub-units of the RNA polymerase, ycf3 and accD were significantly up-regulated (>2.5-fold) in pac (Fig. 2A).51 Severely reduced expression of UGA stop codon-containing psbB and ndhC/K/J transcripts could be confirmed in the atprfB1 mutant defective in the expression of a ribosomal release factor (Fig. 2B).22,52 The nucleus-encoded factor HCF145 is involved in stabilization of the tricistronic psaA–psaB–rps14 transcript in Arabidopsis.24 Accordingly, the histogram for the hcf145 mutant shows that, although the expression of most genes was not severely altered, the abundance of psaA and psaB transcripts was drastically reduced (Fig. 2C), confirming for the first time the high specificity of the effect of this mutation on mRNA metabolism.24 Similarly, the severe defect in accumulation of the cytochrome complex in the mutant cyt160 (data not shown) did not result in the differential expression of most plastid genes (Fig. 2D). In contrast, the newly identified mutant crp135 (chloroplast RNA processing) showed highly elevated levels of some non-photosynthetic genes and down-regulation of 16S and the two autocatalytically cleaved 23S rRNA species a and b, whereas general differential expression of plastid genes was less prominent (Fig. 2E).Our analyses identified 25 mutant lines in which at least 10 genes showed at least a fourfold change in expression level compared with the WT. In 43 mutants, including the pac control and the T-DNA insertion (ins) mutants ins20, ins24 and ins25, the number of genes showing significant differential expression (>2.5-fold change) was greater than 10. In six mutants, levels of only a few transcripts were significantly altered in either direction, whereas in the control mutant hcf145, only the psaA–psaB–rps14 transcript showed a marked decrease (Supplementary Table S2). In the remaining mutants, such as vipp1 and alb3, the degree of up- and down-regulation was less striking (<2.5-fold) suggesting that the expression profile in these mutants essentially reflects secondary or milder primary effects (Fig. 2F). Indeed, the plastid proteins VIPP1 and ALB3 have been shown to be responsible primarily for the assembly of membranes and thylakoid complexes, respectively.47,48Since almost all chloroplast transcriptomes responded rather sensitively to mutations and displayed complex expression patterns, the characteristic expression signatures of groups I and II or simple quantification of changes in transcript levels could not be used to identify specific defects in chloroplast RNA metabolism. Instead, we selected mutants in groups I and II that deviated from the general expression signature for their group, e.g. mutants in groups I and II showing down-regulation especially of co-transcribed genes in clusters A and B, respectively, or vice versa. In addition to mutants of group I generally affected in plastid RNA abundance, this approach allowed the identification of 14 specific RNA metabolism mutants: the three control mutants, pac, hcf145 and hcf109, and 11 new mutants, including crp135 (Supplementary Table S5).Exemplarily, one putative RNA metabolism mutant, crp135 (Fig. 2E), has been selected for preliminary northern analysis to check its deviated expression atypical for group II members. Although the crp135 transcriptome clustered in group II, non-photosynthetic genes, such as clpP and accD, were up-regulated several fold and 16S rRNA was severely down-regulated when compared with the WT (Fig. 4). This is in good agreement with the array data (Fig. 2E). Furthermore, the mutant also showed severe RNA processing defects, indicating a functional link between mRNA processing and abundance. This demonstrates that the array-based approach is well suited to identifying nuclear genes relevant for regulating the general RNA metabolism (group I mutants) and specific plastid RNA transcripts.Northern analysis of the plastid genes clpP and accD in WT and crp135.

Use of Affymetrix microarrays for the evaluation of plastid gene expression in various Arabidopsis mutantsATH1 microarrays of A. thaliana represent probes of ∼24 000 nuclear and 79 plastid genes.53 As has shown before the hybridization signals of plastid genes were generally several-fold higher than or comparable to that of even highly expressed nuclear genes confirming that the ATH1 microarray data are useful for evaluating plastid gene expression.30We collected expression data of plastid genes from 136 different transcriptomes associated with mutants that are mostly affected in non-chloroplast functions, such as morphogenesis of plant organs and signaling pathways. Similar to stress conditions, these data did not allow plastid transcriptomes and genes to be classified into two groups and two NEP and PEP determined clusters, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S2 and Table S6). Nevertheless, in accordance with the operon organization of plastid genes, 35 out of all 79 protein-coding genes co-transcribed in 14 polycistronic units were identified as being co-expressed (Supplementary Table S7). Hierarchical clustering identified nine groups of plastid transcriptomes (I–IX) and six co-regulated plastid gene clusters (A–F) (Supplementary Table S8).

d B (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Taken together, these results demonstrate that genetic defects unrelated to the chloroplast do not impose discernible plastid gene expression profiles or identify new clusters of plastid genes that are under common transcriptional control.3.7. Use of microarrays for the evaluation of plastid gene expression under various stress conditionsFold changes in plastid gene expression were calculated from data for plants subjected to 83 stress conditions, including various abiotic, biotic, pathogen, chemical, nutrient, hormone and light stresses.35 It appeared that plastid transcriptomes and genes clustered according to whether or not different stress conditions affected the chloroplast (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table S9). Again, two groups of generally oppositely regulated transcriptomes, I and II, could be defined. In group I, the stressors included biotic stresses, light (all spectral qualities tested, except UV-B) and various chemicals, whereas group II includes UV-B light, abiotic, nutrient, and hormone stresses. Six clusters (A–F) of co-regulated genes emerged (Supplementary Table S10). Although genes in clusters A–D encode quite heterogeneous functions, clusters E and F contain genes with almost exclusively non-photosynthetic (19 out of 21 genes) and photosynthetic (14 out of 18 genes) functions, respectively (Supplementary Table S10). Genes present in clusters E and F generally show a comparable expression behavior like a down-regulation under biotic stress and an up-regulation after hormone treatment but are oppositely regulated predominantly under different light conditions. This indicates that genes containing NEP and PEP promoters are preferentially light-dependent down- and up-regulated, respectively.Expression map of 79 plastid genes under 83 various conditions generated from Genevestigator.

Transcript levels for genes in clusters C and D were relatively high under various hormone stress conditions, but low under chemical stresses. The average expression views for clusters A–D displayed severe up- and down-regulation of plastid genes, whereas those for clusters E and F did not show significant alterations in plastid gene expression (Fig. 5B). Again, 14 groups of co-expressed and often co-transcribed genes were identified, indicating that co-transcriptional processes contribute to controlling the abundance of transcripts originating from single operons (Supplementary Table S11). However, in accordance with the macroarray data using solely various detrimental conditions, biotic and abiotic effects did not lead to clustering in two major oppositely regulated and transcriptionally determined gene associations, again indicating a prevailing post-transcriptional control under changing environmental conditions rather than a transcriptional control.4. Discussion4.1. Hierarchical clustering of plastid mutant transcriptomes identifies two distinguishable expression signatures and novel mutants impaired in RNA metabolismK-means and hierarchical clustering of transcriptomes of mutants affected in chloroplast functions led to the definition of two groups, I and II. Mutants that fell into group I mostly exhibited an albino phenotype with loss of photosynthetic capability. Group II consists preferentially of expression profiles of hcf and pale green mutants, and patterns characteristic of various tissues or induced by particular environmental conditions. Transcriptomes of group I were generally oppositely regulated relative to those of group II (Fig. 3). The plastid gene expression profile of tobacco PEP mutants revealed that most genes for photosynthesis and ribosomal RNAs were down-regulated and those for ribosomal proteins and RNA polymerase were relatively up-regulated.27 Interestingly, the signature of group I transcriptomes closely resembled not only the expression pattern of the PEP mutants in tobacco, but also those of plastid gene expression mutants in Arabidopsis and WT lines treated with lincomycin which inhibits plastid translation and therefore expression of the PEP.3,12,27,54,55 Several genes in tobacco, which were shown to be transcribed preferentially by the NEP (rpl33, ndhF) or the PEP (ndhA) appeared otherwise to contain most likely PEP and NEP promoters in Arabidopsis, respectively (Table 1), indicating plant-specific strategies for regulation of plastid gene expression consistent with a high diversity of plastid promoters in the two lineages.12,16,27Genes transcribed by the NEP and the PEP were generally severely up- and down-regulated in group I, respectively. Therefore, group I mutants are expected to be primarily affected in plastid gene expression at various levels, allowing preferential or exclusive transcription of plastid genes by the NEP. The data indicate that the activity of the NEP is prevalent in those mutants and under those conditions where expression of the PEP is decreased or limited. The important roles of NEP and PEP for gene expression in plastids in all tissues during plant development is consistent with the assumption that both polymerases are active in non-photosynthetic tissue and important for the early development of the chloroplast during germination.56 The appearance of several albino mutants found in group II indicates that they are not primarily impaired in plastid gene expression. Examples include alb3 and vipp1, mutants known to have defects at the post-translational level.46,47 This contrasts previous assumptions that albino plastids always exhibit strong, pleiotropic aberrations in plastid gene expression.1Reduced levels of plastid 16S and/or 5S rRNAs in mutants of group I imply a severe drop in translation rates and consequently a general loss of transcripts synthesized by the PEP. This makes it difficult to define the primary cause of the lesions in gene expression simply by comparing transcript levels. Instead of changes in levels and diversity of gene expression, deviations from the expression profiles that are generally characteristic for members of groups I and II may provide a more secure basis for identifying mutants primarily affected in the accumulation of specific plastid RNAs. Among the 75 mutant lines analyzed, eight and six bona fide specific plastid RNA metabolism mutants have been identified by this means in groups I and II, respectively (Supplementary Table S5), among them the control mutants hcf145, pac and atprfB1. Representative northern analysis of crp135 finally confirmed the specific defect in plastid RNA metabolism (Fig. 2E). Detailed molecular analysis of identified mutants and gene mapping approaches are in progress.4.2. Analysis of plastid genes based on various transcriptomes of WT and mutants defective in chloroplast functionsGenes previously confirmed to be preferentially transcribed by the NEP and the PEP, respectively, were present in clusters A and B, respectively (Table 1).17,48 It appears that plastid gene expression in mutants impaired in translation and/or chloroplast gene expression is mainly under control of the NEP activity, and, to a lesser degree, under post-transcriptional control. Furthermore, NEP and PEP control different sets of genes in opposite senses. The mutant transcriptomes unequivocally demonstrate the predominance of transcriptional control mechanisms in albino mutants of group I presumably all directly or indirectly affected in the expression of the PEP (Fig. 2). Therefore, clustering analysis identified presumably all plastid promoters, which are preferentially transcribed by the two polymerase types.In contrast, as revealed by macroarray and microarray data, clustering of plastid genes of WT plants exposed to various stress and exogenic conditions, which also affect the chloroplast, did not identify two major transcriptionally determined gene clusters, which behave oppositely (Fig. 5A and Supplementary Table S9). Only two out of the six clusters (E and F) that emerged preferentially contain genes transcribed by the NEP and the PEP, respectively. Cluster E and F genes are only oppositely expressed under changing light conditions, indicating that changes in light quantity and quality significantly induce the transcriptional regulation of photosynthetic gene expression mediated predominantly by the activity of the PEP. However, post-transcriptional events are shown to be major determinants of plastid transcript abundance under most environmental changes in Arabidopsis, providing sufficient fine-tuning for adaptation to environmental changes. A similar situation has been proposed previously for some plastid genes in other organisms.57–59 In contrast, transcriptional control by the PEP and post-transcriptional regulation collapses in mutants that are generally and severely affected in chloroplast gene expression, as is the case for the numerous albino mutants of group I with prevalent NEP-induced transcription (Fig. 3A). This might also be the reason why the degree and diversity of expression changes were often less pronounced in mutants affected in chloroplast functions than in WT plants exposed to various stresses (Figs 1 and 2).Post-transcriptional RNA modifications are relevant not only for the control of transcript abundance but also for the generation of spliced, edited, endo- and exonucleolytically cleaved plastid transcripts in order to generate translation-competent mRNAs.21,60,61 Processing of plastid primary transcripts seems to be especially relevant to both transcript abundance and the translatability of individual gene segments of polycistronic mRNAs to fine tune regulation of gene expression independently of transcriptional control. This is supported by our findings that clustering of plastid genes is less prominent determined by transcriptional control under various biological conditions.4.3. ConclusionIn summary, the present report provides a rich source of information with which to investigate the involvement of the chloroplast and the roles of yet unknown nuclear genes in the management of gene expression in this organelle, especially under conditions of abiotic and biotic stresses. The data allude to defined expression programs regulating plastid functions in response to changing environmental conditions. We show that expression profiles can be used to monitor the functional state of the plant and to identify mutants in plastid RNA metabolism, which deviate from the general expression response. Especially the acquisition of a large number of nuclear genes by de novo synthesis and horizontal gene transfer has significantly increased the complexity of plastid RNA metabolism. The high frequency of plant-specific genes that are important for chloroplast RNA homeostasis demonstrates that transcript regulation has shaped the emergence of plant-specific expression systems for components of the plastid.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available online at www.dna.research.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (SFB TR1 Project B2) to JM.We would like to thank Klaus Apel, Ekkehard Neuhaus, Ute Vothknecht," and Peter Westhoff for providing Arabidopsis mutants.Supplementary data""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IntroductionPost-transcriptional regulation of gene expression includes mRNA processing, splicing, editing, transport, stability and translation. Degradation of mRNA is an important component of gene function that controls the steady-state concentration of functional transcript levels in the cell.1 For example, in human mRNA, stability is estimated to control the mRNA level of about 5–10% of all genes.2 Quantification of this process is important for interpretation of gene-expression data obtained with microarrays as well as data from gene manipulation experiments. Changes in gene expression may be delayed by several days if the corresponding transcript is stable. This may cause serious errors in reconstruction of gene regulatory networks.Studies in several organisms revealed that majority of transcripts are stable.3–5 It appeared that the specific half-life of each mRNA is precisely related to its physiological role.4–8 For example, most housekeeping genes have long mRNA half-lives. In contrast, proteins that are required only for limited time in the cell, e.g. at a certain stage of the cell cycle, during development, growth or differentiation or in response to external stimuli, often have mRNAs with short half-lives.9 Transcriptionally inducible genes are disproportionately represented in the class of genes with rapid mRNA turnover.5RNA stability can be altered in response to external stimuli such as hormones10 or various types of stress. For example, response to UV-B exposure leads to stabilization of many short-lived mRNAs in mammalian cells.11 Conversely, in yeast, mild heat shock promotes rapid degradation of mRNAs encoding the ribosomal proteins,12 while glucose starvation, amino acid starvation, or sugar-induced osmotic stress causes stabilization of at least some yeast mRNAs.13–15 Changes in RNA stability can also play an important role during embryonic development or cell differentiation. In plasmodium it has been shown that a major determinant of mRNA decay rate appears to be tightly linked to intra-erythrocytic development cycle, and to a lesser extent the functional category of the mRNAs themselves.16 During primordial germ cells specification of Oryzias latipes (Japanese medaka) some specific RNA molecules are protected from degradation, thus establishing a specific mRNA expression pattern controlled by post-transcriptional mechanisms.17 Expression of a wide variety of transcripts is controlled by changes in mRNA stability during neuronal development.18,19 During muscle differentiation mRNA half-lives for muscle-specific genes—myogenin and myoD—have been shown to be the highest during differentiation, but declines when differentiation is completed.20 Abnormal changes in RNA stability can be a cause of cell malfunction leading to cancer21,22 and other diseases like diabetic nephropathy,22 muscular atrophy,23 neurological disorders such as Alzheimer disease.9Decay of mRNA is controlled by complex mechanisms that are not fully understood. This mechanism is integrated with other mRNA-related molecular processes including transcript elongation, splicing, polyadenylation, transport and translation.6,9 RNA decay mechanisms include interaction between cis-acting elements and trans-acting factors. Major cis-factors affecting decay rates include AU-rich elements (ARE), iron-responsive elements, histone stem-loops, coding region determinants, Jun-kinase response elements, retained introns, and exon junctions.24–26Trans-factors that control mRNA decay include RNAses that are often assembled into exosomes, RNA-binding proteins (poly-A binding, WD40 repeats, ARE-binding), siRNA, miRNA, piRNA. P-bodies in the cytoplasm can facilitate miRNA-mediated mRNA degradation induced by stress, and ribosomes control nonsense-mediated decay (NMD).27 Recent studies have shown that PUF-domain proteins can promote mRNA degradation of genes involved in development via Pop2-mediated deadenylation.28 Binding motif of PUF protein PUM2 has been identified in mouse.29Estimates of mRNA decay rates may depend on the method of measurement. Functional degradation, defined as decrease of the numbers of functional mRNA capable of producing correct protein, should be distinguished from physical degradation (or mass decay), which represents the decrease of mRNA numbers measured by PCR amplification or hybridization intensity.30 Analysis of functional degradation is appropriate for individual genes, but it is not an option for high-throughput analysis targeted at the whole transcriptome. Thus, we will consider only physical degradation of mRNA with understanding that this measurement may not capture some aspects of mRNA function. The most widely used methods for high-throughput analysis of mRNA degradation is based on transcriptional inhibitors, for example by actinomycin D, which inhibits transcription via binding to single-strand DNA at the transcription initiation complex and preventing elongation by RNA polymerase II.31Multiple studies attempted to measure mRNA decay rates in human,3,5 but only one study has relatively large data of 5245 genes in hepatoma cells.4 There are no data for mouse or any other mammals. Among eukaryotes, comparable data have been generated for plasmodium,16 yeast7 and Arabidopsis.32 To obtain baseline data for the mRNA half-life in mouse, we have selected mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. ES cells are often used as experimental models for cell differentiation and for reconstruction of gene regulatory networks. Genes that control mRNA decay rates may also affect the differentiation of ES cells.33 Despite increasing interest in the study of ES cells, there have been no attempts to measure mRNA decay rates in these cells. Here, we have described mRNA half-life of essentially all mouse genes in mouse ES cells.2. Materials and methods2.1. Cell cultureWe used two mouse ESC lines: MC1 derived from mouse strain 129S6/SvEvTac and MC2-B6 derived from strain C57BL/6J. These lines were purchased from The Transgenic Core Laboratory of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine (Baltimore, MD, USA). To remove contaminating feeder cells, ES cells were first cultured for two passages on gelatin-coated culture dish in complete ES medium [DMEM, 15% FBS; Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF) (ESGRO) 1000 U/ml; 1 mM sodium pyruvate; 0.1 mM NEAA, 2 mM glutamate, 0.1 mM β-mercaptoethanol and penicillin/streptomycin (50 U/50 µg per ml)]. Cells were then seeded in gelatin-coated 6-well plates at the density of 1–2 × 105 cells/well (1–2 × 104/cm2) and cultured for 3 days before the test for mRNA stability. Cells were incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2. Medium was changed daily. Differentiated ES cells were obtained from MC1 cells by LIF withdrawal (complete medium without LIF, below referenced as LIF−) or by retinoic acid (RA) treatment (complete medium with 1 µM RA, below referenced as RA) for 7 days before the test. To measure mRNA stability, transcription was blocked by adding actinomycin D (Sigma, cat # A-9415) to the medium at the concentration of 5 µg/ml. Cells were harvested at 0, 1, 2, 4 and 8 h after addition of actinomycin D.2.2. Microarray experimentsRNA was extracted using Phase lock gel™ (Eppendorf/Brinkman) columns according to the manufacturer’s protocol after adding 1 ml of Trizol™ (Invitrogen) per well. RNA was precipitated with isopropanol, washed with 70% ethanol and dissolved in DEPC dH2O. RNA was hybridized to the NIA Mouse 44K Microarray v2.3 (whole genome 60-mer oligonuleotide probe; manufactured by Agilent Technologies, #014951)34 in duplicate for each cell type and time point. Fluorescently labeled microarray targets were prepared from 2.5 µg aliquots of total RNA samples using a Low RNA Input Fluorescent Linear Amplification Kit (Agilent). A reference target (Cy5-CTP-labeled) was produced from Stratagene Universal Mouse Reference RNA (UMR), and all other targets were labeled with Cy3-CTP. Targets were purified using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, and quantified on a NanoDrop scanning spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies). All hybridizations were carried out by combining a Cy3-CTP-labeled experimental target and a Cy5-CTP-labeled UMR target. Microarrays were hybridized and washed according to Agilent protocol (G4140-90030; Agilent 60-mer oligonucleotide microarray processing protocol—SSC Wash, v1.0). Slides were scanned on an Agilent DNA Microarray Scanner, using standard settings, including automatic photo-multiplier tube adjustment.2.3.

Calibration of microarray signal intensitiesReliable estimation of mRNA degradation rates requires accurate scaling of expression values to ensure that the ratio of hybridization signal intensities is equal to the ratio of mRNA abundance uniformly across the entire range of values. We tested the scaling using a series of dilutions (5×, 1×, 0.2× and 0.04×) of the mRNA pool (obtained from newborn mice of C57BL/6J strain) labeled with Cy3 and hybridized together with the constant amount of the UMR sample labeled with Cy5. Regression of log-transformed Cy3 signals versus log RNA input was close to 1 for most probes with log signal >1.5 (Supplementary Fig. S1), which indicates proper scaling. The results confirmed accurate calibration of intensity signals across the entire range of values.Unexpectedly, Cy5 signals of some probes on the microarray also showed strong positive dependence on RNA input despite the fact that the amount of Cy5-labeled UMR was constant in all the arrays (Supplementary Fig. S2). This effect was observed only when Cy3 signal was much stronger than Cy5 signal. The mechanism of this effect is unknown, but we hypothesize that it stems from the chain hybridization when free ends of Cy3-labeled mRNA bound to probes on the array can hybridize with Cy5-labeled mRNA either non-specifically or via rare antisense segments (termed ‘chain effect’). This effect may cause underestimation of gene expression difference between cell types if values are normalized by UMR signal. To avoid distortion, we did not use UMR for normalization for a small portion of probes where we expected chain effect.Another challenge in interpretation of microarray measurements is that expression values often do not fall below some ‘background’ level, which most likely results from non-specific hybridization. If a gene has low expression and is measured close to probe’s background level, it may show little change in expression value after actinomycin D treatment, which can be erroneously viewed as evidence of high mRNA stability. To avoid these errors, we estimated mRNA decay rates only for sets of data with expression values that were either high, >2.5 in log10 scale, or substantially above the background, >2 fold.2.5. Microarray data analysis by gene ontology termsAnalysis of gene ontology (GO) terms in a selected list of genes was done using the hypergeometric distribution and FDR ≤ 0.05 criterion using NIA Mouse Gene Index (ver. mm8) software.36 Only non-redundant genes with gene symbols were used for analysis. Because many GO categories are redundant (contain similar lists of genes), we adjusted the calculation of FDR in the following way. First, we identified all redundant pairs of GO terms that had a correlation of gene presence ≥0.7. Second, in the list of GO terms ordered by increasing P-values, pi, estimated from the hypergeometric distribution, GO term i was considered redundant, if it was redundant to at least one preceding term.2.6. Real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reactionTotal RNAs were extracted from ES cells using Trizol™ (Invitrogen) and Phase lock gel™ (Eppendorf/Brinkman) columns according to the manufacturers’ protocols. RNAs were precipitated with isopropanol, washed with 70% ethanol and dissolved in DEPC dH2O. Primers for quantitative reverse transcriptase–PCR (qRT–PCR) were designed using the Vector NTI Advance 9.1 software (Invitrogen) and tested for SYBR Green chemistry using an established in-house protocol.37 Reactions were run on the ABI 7500 Sequence Detection Systems using the default cycling program, and data were processed using SDS 2.2 software (Applied Biosystems). Gene expression levels were normalized to a Cyclin D3 as an internal control and to total RNA amount.3. Results and discussion3.1. Measuring mRNA decay rates in mouse ES cellsTo quantify mRNA decay rates in mouse ES cells we measured changes in gene expression with whole-genome microarrays in a time course (0, 1, 2, 4 and 8 h) after treating cells with actinomycin D. Experiments were done for two ES cell lines—MC1 (129S6/SvEvTac) and MC2-B6 (C57BL/6J) cultured in the standard condition in the presence of LIF. To increase the number of genes that can be assayed, we also carried out the analysis of MC1 ES cells undergoing differentiation into two different culture conditions—in the absence of LIF and in the presence of RA for 7 days. Expression data for all genes are available in Supplementary Table S1. Proper calibration of signal intensities in the full range of gene expression values was confirmed using hybridization of different RNA amounts to microarrays (see details in Section 2.2). Expression values for most genes were normalized using UMR, except for 1824 probes (4.3%) where normalization was not possible because UMR signal was low and unstable (see details in Section 2.4). Decay rates were estimated using linear regression of log-transformed data (Fig. 1A and B) and normalized by average expression change of 200 most stable genes (see details in Section 2.4; Supplementary Table S1).Because the earlier work did not fully address the data reproducibility issue, where analysis was limited to estimating statistical (technical) error and validation of expression measurements by PCR for a small number of genes, we felt that it was important to evaluate the reproducibility of the measurements. To this end, we used the following two methods: (i) comparing mRNA decay rates in two independent experiments with different ES cell lines (MC1 and MC2-B6) cultured in the standard conditions and (ii) comparing mRNA decay rates estimated using different oligonucleotide probes on the microarray for the main transcript of the same gene. The first method yielded very high consistency between estimates of mRNA degradation rate (r = 0.925), indicating biological reproducibility of our database (Fig. 1C). The second method gave somewhat lower match (r = 0.744), but the correlation was still within the range expected from the comparison of gene expression data obtained with different array platforms (Fig. 1D).Discrepancy between mRNA half-lives estimated using different oligonucleotide probes for the same gene was likely related to the biological complexity of mRNA processing rather than to the error in measurement. For example, probes located in 3′-UTR often showed shorter mRNA half-lives than probes located in the open reading frame (ORF) (Supplementary Fig. S3A). This may be caused by either alternative termination of transcription coupled with a differential degradation rate or active mRNA truncation at some early step of mRNA processing. Interestingly, some genes of histone H1 family had the opposite pattern of degradation: probes located in the short 3′-UTR showed longer half-lives than probes located in the ORF (Supplementary Fig. S3B). However, because of a high sequence similarity between histone genes and a partial cross-hybridization of probes, this effect may be an artifact.To validate the microarray data, we carried out qRT–PCR analysis and found that qRT–PCR results matched well to those obtained by DNA microarrays for six out of seven selected genes (Supplementary Fig. S4). An exception was Sox17, whose degradation rates measured by qRT-PCR were much lower than those measured by microarrays. The closer inspection of probe locations revealed that all microarray probes for Sox17 were located in the 3′-UTR of the gene, whereas qRT-PCR primers were located in the ORF. This result was, therefore, consistent with differential degradation rates of Sox21 measured with probes located in 3′-UTR and ORF (Supplementary Fig. S3A).3.2. Effect of alternative transcription and splicing on estimation of RNA stabilityIt is conceivable that the influence of probe locations on the estimation of mRNA stability goes beyond the aforementioned simple difference between 3′-UTR and ORF. For example, oligonucleotide probes recognized different transcripts, which are produced by alternative transcription start sites (TSSs), splicing and polyA signals, may lead to the estimation of different half-lives for the same gene. To determine the effect of alternative transcription and splicing on mRNA stability, we compared decay rates identified with the best probe from the main transcript of each gene with decay rates estimated using other probes that matched the same gene. Probes from alternatively spliced transcripts often showed shorter mRNA half-lives compared with the best probe in the main transcript (Fig. 1E). This effect was strongest for probes located in the retained introns of alternative transcripts. Similar effect of alternative splicing was reported in Arabidopsis; however, it was not statistically significant because of the small number of alternatively spliced forms captured by the array.32 Thus, we, for the first time, statistically confirm that alternative transcripts, especially those with retained introns, have shorter mRNA half-life compared with main transcripts.This phenomenon can be simply explained by the possibility that alternative transcripts have a higher degradation rate due to specific sequences located in retained introns or alternatively spliced exons. Alternatively, it is also possible that the degradation of alternative transcripts appears to be accelerated by the splicing that may continue even after the blocking of transcription by actinomycin D. Because RNAs were extracted from whole cells in our experiments, it may contain heterogeneous nuclear RNA with some retained introns, which are able to hybridize with intron-matching probes in the array. If splicing continues for a while after the blocking of transcription by actinomycin D, the number of heterogeneous nuclear RNA would decrease. Further experiments are needed to distinguish between the two possible mechanisms. All subsequent analysis was done only for main transcripts of each gene. We would like to note that for 1391 genes, mRNA decay rates were not consistent between different microarray probes (>2-fold difference). Therefore, mRNA half-lives for these genes estimated with the best oligonucleotide should be considered with caution (marked by an asterisk in Supplementary Table S2).3.3. General trends in stability of mRNAs in ES cellsWe were able to estimate mRNA half-lives of 19 977 non-redundant genes (Supplementary Table S2). For 14 815 genes, estimates are available for two ES cell lines and three culture conditions. We were not able to estimate mRNA half-lives of 7260 genes due to the low level of expression in ES cells and those of 541 genes due to the lack of acceptable probes in the main transcript. Most of the genes had long half-lives, which was in concordance with published data.3–5 In our analysis, median estimated half-life for all genes was 7.1 h (Fig. 1F), which was less than reported for human hepatoma cells (10 h);4 however, this difference may be related to normalization method, as discussed below (see Section 3.9). In our analysis, only 54 genes (including Prdm1, Myc, Gadd45 g, Foxa2, Hes5 and Trib1) showed a half-life shorter than 1 h. Published data indicate that more genes showed RNA half-life shorter than 30 min.3 Therefore, it is possible that the number of genes with very short mRNA life may be underestimated in our study, because we did not collect samples at the time points earlier than 1 h.3.4. Functional annotation of stable and unstable transcriptsWe analyzed over representation of GO terms in the 610 genes with half-life shorter than 2 h and in 4310 genes with half-life longer than 12 h to identify functional categories of genes with unstable and stable mRNA, respectively (Supplementary Tables S3 and S4). Using GO database and additional information on protein domains, we manually assembled lists of genes with functions that were characteristic to stable and unstable mRNA species (Supplementary Table S2). The major functional categories of genes with unstable mRNA were ‘Regulation of transcription’, ‘Cell cycle’, ‘Apoptosis’, ‘Signal transduction’ and ‘Development’, whereas the major functional categories of genes with stable mRNA were ‘Metabolism’, ‘Protein biosynthesis’, ‘Extracellular matrix’ and ‘Cytoskeleton’ (Fig. 1G). Most of these results confirm findings published earlier;4,5,32 however, overrepresentation of ‘Extracellular matrix’ and ‘Cytoskeleton’ groups among stable mRNA species is reported here for the first time. Many transcription factors showed very short mRNA half-life, which may be important for the quick expression changes of target genes. Genes with half-life from 1 to 2 h (n = 557) included early response and cell cycle regulation and also some genes important for pluripotency and early development: for example, Sox2, Klf4, Foxd3, Sox7, Nodal, Ctgf, Id1, Id2, Id3 and Wnt signaling.3.5. Strain-dependent stability of mRNAIn the previous study, we have shown that there are genes differentially expressed between ES cells derived from 129 mouse stain and ES cells derived from C57BL/6 mouse strain (strain-specific signature genes).38 We, therefore, asked if the observed differences were related to differences in mRNA half-life of corresponding genes. We found that a small number of genes (n = 92) had statistically significant differences in mRNA decay rates between MC1 (129S6/SvEvTac) and MC2-B6 (C57BL/6J) ES cells (FDR <0.05 and >2-fold change of half-life) (Supplementary Table S5) and only 10 of these genes overlapped with strain-specific signature genes. Although differential gene expression of at least some strain-specific genes can be explained partially by differences in mRNA stability, we were not able to identify correlation between differential gene expression and mRNA stability between strains on a global scale.3.6. Alteration of mRNA half-life in differentiating ES cellsDifferentiation of ES cells in the absence of LIF or in the presence of RA caused changes in mRNA stability in a large set of genes (n = 3332 in LIF− and n = 2257 in RA) (Fig. 2A and B, Supplementary Tables S6 and S7). These changes were much stronger than the strain difference in mRNA stability between MC1 and MC2-B6 ES cells (Fig. 1C). In general, decay rates of mRNA increased after LIF withdrawal: the median half-life declined from 7.07 to 5.48 h; and out of 3332 genes with significant change of mRNA stability, 77.9% had increased decay rates compared with undifferentiated ES cells (Fig. 2A and C). In contrast, differentiation of ES cells in RA conditions caused a general increase of mRNA stability: the median half-life increased from 7.07 to 8.60 h; and out of 2257 genes with significant change of mRNA stability, 87.1% had decreased decay rates compared with undifferentiated ES cells (Fig. 2B and C). This indicates a substantial difference between two protocols of ES cell differentiation. But despite these global differences, gene-specific changes in mRNA stability in these differentiating ES cells showed a good correlation: the change in decay rates of mRNA (in log scale) in RA conditions was positively correlated with the change of decay rates (in log scale) in LIF− conditions (r = 0.593) (Supplementary Fig. S5A). This means that changes in mRNA decay rates can be viewed as a superposition of two effects: (i) gene-specific effect that is consistent between LIF− and RA conditions and (ii) non-specific effect associated with the culture medium that caused general decrease in stability in LIF− conditions and general increase in mRNA stability in RA conditions.Change in mRNA decay rates in ES cells after differentiation.

(A) Change of mRNA decay rates after 7 days of differentiation in LIF− conditions; significant changes (FDR <0.05 and >2-fold change of half-life) is shown by red and green dots; rates are log-transformed, log10(d + 0.1).

(C) Frequency distribution of mRNA half-life in undifferentiated MC1 cells (LIF+) compared with cells differentiated after LIF withdrawal (LIF−) and retinoic acid (RA) treatment. (D) Half-life of mRNA of genes associated with pluripotent state of ES cells in undifferentiated cells (LIF+) and upon differentiation (LIF− and RA).To select genes whose mRNA were either destabilized or stabilized in differentiated cells in both LIF− and RA conditions, we used one standard deviation cut-off of log decay rates (Supplementary Fig. S5A). Genes with increased rate of mRNA decay upon differentiation were enriched in GO terms ‘transcription regulation’, ‘nervous system development’, ‘apoptosis’, ‘ubiquitin cycle’, ‘ribosome’ (mostly mitochondrial ribosomal proteins), ‘chromatin binding’ and ‘methyltransferase activity’ (Supplementary Table S8). Genes with decreased rate of mRNA decay upon differentiation were enriched in GO terms ‘extracellular space’, ‘extracellular matrix’, ‘calcium ion binding’, ‘actin cytoskeleton’ and ‘lysosome’ (Supplementary Table S9). During the ES cell differentiation, unstable mRNA species became even less stable, whereas stable mRNA species became more stable (Supplementary Fig. S5B).It is believed that in general the differentiation of ES cells is associated with destabilization of pluripotency-related genes and stabilization of lineage-specific genes. Indeed, our data showed that mRNAs of some pluripotency-related genes (Sall4, Eed, Esrrb, Notch4, Mras, Tbx3, Btbd14b and Sap30) were destabilized upon differentiation (Fig. 2D). Interestingly, the strongest increase in mRNA decay rate was observed for Btbd14b (Nac1), which is a known cofactor of NANOG and POU5F1 proteins.39,40 Similarly, mRNAs of some differentiation-related genes (e.g. Bmp1, Acta1, Igfbp1, Igfbp4, Igfbp6, Frzb, Cited1, Flt1, Slit2, Krt8, Krt14, Cnn1, Mest, Wnt3 and Amot) were stabilized. On the other hand, the change in mRNA stability for all genes had no correlation with the change in gene expression levels (Supplementary Fig. S5C and D), indicating that mRNA stability has no global role in controlling gene expression changes during ES cells differentiation.One way to control mRNA degradation is to modulate the expression levels of particular ribonucleases. In metazoans, it is known that the modulation of the expression of ribonucleases and/or associated factors play an important role in the control of mRNA stability during development.6 It has also been shown that many ribonucleases and associated factors are differentially regulated during development. For example, in Drosophila, the expression of ribonucleases pacman/XRN1, twister/SKI2 and tazman/DIS3/RRP44, varies during development at both RNA and protein levels.41–43 We, therefore, focused on genes that are involved in the mRNA degradation or binding and found that 103 genes changed their expression at >2-fold between undifferentiated and differentiated ES cells (Supplementary Table S10). The multiplicity of mRNA degradation pathways makes it difficult to relate expression of these genes with observed patterns of mRNA degradation. However, we noted that the expression ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
evels of Lsm3, Lsm5, Lsm6, Lsm7, Lsm12, Lsmd1, Cnot4, Cnot10, Dcp2, Exosc1, which are known to promote mRNA degradation, decreased in the differentiated ES cells, especially in the RA condition. This may explain increased stability of mRNA in cells differentiated in the RA condition. In contrast, degradation-promoting genes—Zfp36l1 and Cnot6l—showed increased expression in differentiated ES cells, which may have contributed to lower mRNA stability in the LIF− condition, but it does not explain increased mRNA stability in the RA condition.3.7. Multivariate analysis of gene structural features that affect mRNA stabilityDecay rates of mRNA vary substantially between genes (Fig. 1F); however, little is known about factors and mechanisms responsible for these differences. Two major structural factors that affect mRNA stability are known: (i) the presence of introns in genes (i.e. multi-exon genes), which makes mRNA more stable;44 and (ii) the presence of AREs in the 3′-UTR of genes, which makes mRNA less stable.45,46 However, all the previous results have been obtained using single-factor analysis, which may easily lead to erroneous conclusions if factors are correlated. We, therefore, used multivariate regression analysis, which helps to distinguish direct causal effects from mere correlations. We incorporated as many structural characteristics of genes as possible, including the length of ORF, the length of 5′-UTR, the length of 3′-UTR, the number of exons, the occurrence of different kinds of ARE, the presence of CpG di-nucleotides and the presence of PUF binding motifs in all parts of the transcript (Supplementary Table S11). AREs were detected by using three types of reported consensus sequences: AUUUA (ARE1), UUAUUUAWW (ARE2), WWWUAUUUAUWWW (ARE3)45,47 and non-specific A/U 12-mers with no more than one mismatch (ARE4). We used UGUANAUA as PUF consensus motifs.29,48,49 CpG elements were added to the list after we unexpectedly found that they can affect mRNA stability. We did not analyze the effects of miRNA on the mRNA stability, because it would require extensive data mining and integration with the existing miRNA databases.Multiple regression analysis showed that mRNA stability was correlated positively with the number of exons and negatively with the ORF length, number of ARE2, ARE4 and PUF in 3′-UTR, number of ARE4 and PUF in ORF, and number of CpG di-nucleotides in 5′-UTR (Supplementary Table S11). The effect of ORF length was nearly equal to the effect of the number of exons with the opposite sign, which indicated that the number of exon junctions per unit ORF length may be a better predictor of mRNA stability than the number of exons per gene. This is also supported by the fact that most exon junctions are located in the ORF region of genes. Indeed, log-transformed rate of mRNA decay correlated stronger with log-transformed number of exon junctions per unit ORF length (r = −0.326) than with log-transformed number of exons (r = −0.111). Therefore, below we always used the ratio of exon junctions per 1 kb of ORF length as a predictor of mRNA stability.According to the regression equation [Equation (2)], we conclude that the number of exon junctions per unit ORF length shows the strongest and the most consistent effect on mRNA stability between cells types. This conclusion is further supported by the alternative data presentation shown in Fig. 3A. The proportion of genes with ≥5 exon junctions per unit ORF length was higher in genes with longer mRNA half-life, whereas the proportion of genes associated with the destabilizing factors (CpG di-nucleotides in 5′-UTR, and ARE4 and PUF in 3′-UTR) was higher in genes with shorter mRNA half-life (Fig. 3A). Although the role of introns in stability of mRNA has been reported both in experimental and statistical studies,44 here we present the first evidence that the number of exon junctions per unit ORF length is the most important known structural factor that increases mRNA stability. After intron is excised by spliceosome, the exon junction location is marked by binding of the exon junction complex (EJC), which consists of at least 10 proteins.50 EJC remains bound to mRNA after transport to cytoplasm, can stimulate translation, and mediate NMD of mRNA during the pioneer round of translation.50 It is indeed possible that some components of EJC can remain bound to mRNA after the first round of translation and decrease the rate of mRNA degradation.44 But the mechanism of this process remains unknown.Effect of structural and functional characteristics of genes on the rate of mRNA decay.

(B) Regression coefficients for the effect of structural elements (cis-factors) and gene function on the mRNA decay rate; abundance of structural elements and mRNA decay rates are log-transformed. (C) Correlation between functional characteristics of genes and abundance of structural elements (log-transformed).According to the regression equation [Equation (2)], the second strongest factor affecting the mRNA stability was the number of PUF motifs in 3′-UTR, which decreased the mRNA stability. The third strongest factor affecting the mRNA stability was the presence of AREs. Unexpectedly, the sequence non-specific ARE4 in 3′-UTR (to a smaller extent, in ORF) decreased mRNA half-life more strongly than the consensus-matching AREs. Among different consensus matching AREs, only ARE2 in 3′-UTR showed a significant effect on mRNA stability. Several mechanisms are known to be involved in ARE-mediated mRNA degradation. For example, ARE-binding proteins can recruit PARN or exosomes.51 It is also known that the stability of mRNA can be modified by immune factors via AREs in 3′-UTR.52The fourth strongest factor that affects mRNA stability was the number of CpG di-nucleotides in 5′-UTR. Because this was not known before, this is indeed the first report about the effect of CpG di-nucleotides on the mRNA stability. We suspected that the occurrence of CpG di-nucleotides in 5′-UTR may be correlated with the presence of CpG islands at TSS. We, therefore, estimated the number of CpG di-nucleotides near TSS (from −400 to +600 bp) and included it into the regression analysis. We found that the numbers of CpG di-nucleotides in 5′-UTR appeared to have a 5-fold stronger effect on mRNA stability than their numbers in the CpG island adjacent to TSS (Supplementary Table S12), which indicates that CpG di-nucleotides need to be located within 5′-UTR to affect mRNA decay. The mechanism of this effect is unknown, but considering a strong effect of splicing on mRNA stability we can hypothesize that it may be mediated by methyl CpG-binding proteins that regulate splicing.53We have, thus far, shown that both functional categories of genes (Section 3.4) and the structural features of genes (this section) affect the mRNA stability. It will be, thus, interesting to see which factors affect mRNA stability more strongly. To this end, we carried out the regression analysis after including both structural features and functional categories (Fig. 3B, Supplementary Table S13). Among functional groups of genes, the strongest destabilizing effect was shown in the category of ‘Regulation of transcription’ followed by ‘Signal transduction’ and ‘Cell cycle’. In contrast, ‘Metabolism’, ‘Extracellular matrix’ and ‘Cytoskeleton’ functional categories increased mRNA stability, which is consistent with our previous results (Fig. 1G). However, we found that all the effects of structural factors listed in Equation (2) remained strong and statistically significant, and the sign of regression coefficients did not change after adding functional gene categories. This indicates that the stability of mRNAs is more significantly correlated with the structural features of genes than the function of genes.Furthermore, the differential mRNA stability in various functional groups of genes can be partially explained by structural features of genes. For example, low stability of mRNA among genes in the functional category of ‘Regulation of transcription’ and ‘Development’ can be explained by the low number of exon junctions per ORF length and high number of ARE4 and PUF in 3′-UTR and CpG in 5′-UTR (Fig. 3C). Similarly, high stability of mRNA among genes in the category of ‘Metabolism’ can be explained by the high number of exon junctions per ORF length and low number of ARE4 and PUF in 3′-UTR and CpG in 5′-UTR (Fig. 3C). However, several functional categories of genes (e.g. ‘Regulation of transcription’ or ‘Extracellular matrix’) had a significant effect on mRNA stability based on regression (Fig. 3B). This indicates that the effect of gene function cannot fully be explained by structural characteristics of transcripts included in the regression.As mentioned above, differentiation of ES cells in both LIF− and RA conditions caused changes in mRNA stability in a large set of genes (Fig. 3A and B, Supplementary Tables S6 and S7). To identify structural and functional factors that affected these global changes in mRNA stability, we compared the coefficients of multiple regression that related decay rates (log scale) with various factors in undifferentiated and differentiated ES cells in LIF− and RA conditions (Fig. 3B, Supplementary Table S13). Degradation-promoting effects of CpG di-nucleotides in 5′-UTR and ARE in 3′-UTR appeared much stronger in cells differentiated in the LIF− condition compared with undifferentiated cells and cells differentiated in the RA condition. Cells differentiated in the RA condition had weaker degradation-promoting effects of ARE4 in 3′-UTR than in undifferentiated cells. These effects may explain the increased mRNA decay rates in ES cells differentiated in LIF− and the decreased decay rates in ES cells differentiated in the RA condition. Protection of mRNA from degradation by exon junctions was stronger in both types of differentiated ES cells than in undifferentiated cells.3.9. Comparison with human dataInterspecies comparison of mRNA decay rates has been done only among distant evolutionary lineages (plant, yeast and human). The new mouse data set provides an opportunity to compare the two mammalian species: mouse and human. Using Homologene database54 we identified 4153 pairs of orthologous genes for which mRNA rates were estimated both in mouse (this study) and human (Supplementary Table S3). For compatibility with our data, we converted estimates of mRNA decay rates in human from log2 to loge. Because human data are normalized using β-actin, whose mRNA is not highly stable (based on our data), a large set of human genes (11.6%) shows negative degradation rates.4 We, therefore, re-normalized the estimates of human mRNA decay rates using the method we used for mouse (by average decay rate of 200 genes with most stable mRNA). Median rate of mRNA decay for all orthologous genes in mouse (d = 0.098 h−1) was lower than in human (d = 0.137 h−1). Because these experiments differed not just in species (i.e. mouse versus human), but also in cell types (ES cells versus hepatoma), and were done in different laboratories using different microarray platforms, it was impossible to attribute this difference to any specific factor. However, correlation between mRNA decay rates in mouse and human was high (r = 0.610, Fig. 4), which was only slightly lower than correlation between estimates of mRNA decay rates obtained with different probes that matched the same mouse transcript (r = 0.744, see Section 3.1). This finding indicates that pathways of mRNA degradation are mostly conserved between mammalian species. Interestingly, mRNA decay rates in human hepatoma were more similar to decay rates in differentiated ES cells (r = 0.605 for LIF− and r = 0.616 for RA) than to decay rates in undifferentiated ES cells (r = 0.534, SE = 0.013, P = 0.0001). This may be explained by the fact that hepatoma cells are differentiated and, thus, the profile of mRNA decay rate in hepatoma matched better with that in differentiated ES cells. However, this similarity needs to be confirmed with further experiments that use the same cell types in both species.Comparison of mRNA decay rates for orthologous genes in mouse ES cells and in human hepatocytes (from the reference4) Rates are log-transformed, log10(d + 0.1). Human mRNA decay rates were re-normalized using average decay rate of 200 most unstable mRNA species for proper comparison.Comparison of mRNA decay rates for orthologous genes in mouse ES cells and in human hepatocytes (from the reference4) Rates are log-transformed, log10(d + 0.1). Human mRNA decay rates were re-normalized using average decay rate of 200 most unstable mRNA species for proper comparison.3.10. ConclusionIn this paper we present a whole-genome analysis of mRNA decay rates in mouse ES cells. Decay rates were reliably measured for 19 977 non-redundant genes from time course of microarray data in undifferentiated ES cells originated from different mouse strains and in differentiated ES cells obtained by LIF withdrawal (LIF−) or RA treatment. The novelty of this study can be summarized as follows: (i) this is the first study of mRNA decay rates in mouse. (ii) This is the first study of mRNA decay rates in ES cells of any mammalian species. (iii) We have analyzed the difference in mRNA decay rates between cells derived from two different mouse strains and between undifferentiated and differentiated cells. (iv) The set of genes for which mRNA decay rates estimated is 3.8 times larger than in the most extensive earlier study for human. (v) Close match between data from different cell lines has confirmed high reproducibility of mRNA decay rate estimates. (vi) The microarrays have been calibrated. (vii) We have applied multivariate statistics for the analysis of factors affecting mRNA decay rates, which identifies direct effects and distinguishes them from mere correlations. (viii) We have explored the effect of various structural features of transcripts and gene function on mRNA stability in both general and during ES cell differentiation. The major result is that the number of exon junctions per ORF is the strongest factor promoting mRNA stability, whereas decay is promoted by CpG di-nucleotides in 5′-UTR region as well as by non-canonical ARE (without specific consensus sequence) in 3′-UTR and in ORF. We believe that the presented data on mRNA decay rates provides a valuable resource for future experiments in interpreting various gene manipulation and gene expression studies as well as the computational modeling and simulation on gene regulatory networks.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available online at www.dna.research.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThe work was supported by the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute on Aging," NIH (Z01 AG000656).Supplementary data""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IntroductionCell cycle progression is regulated and controlled by a range of mechanisms including protein modification, targeted proteolytic degradation and cell cycle-specific transcription.1 Genes whose expression levels peak at a specific event of the cell cycle are often required to regulate the processes that occur at these stages.2 In the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, of ∼6000 genes, ∼400–800 have transcript levels that oscillate during the cell cycle,3,4 whereas in the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, of ∼5000 genes, ∼400–750 such genes have been found.5–7 In human cancer cell line (HeLa), among a total of 22 000 genes, >1000 are regulated by the cell cycle.8,9 These studies of periodic genes suggest that only the 112th orthologue group is cyclic and common among human cells, as well as budding and fission yeast cells.10 Those taking part in the cell cycle progression include the cyclin B homologs, CDC5, SCH9, DSK2 and ZPR1. Proteins involved in DNA replication include histones, some checkpoint kinases and some proteins regulating DNA damage and repair. Many groups of genes related to translation and other metabolic processes are also cyclic in all three organisms.10 In Arabidopsis thaliana, of ∼25 000 genes, ∼500 cell cycle regulated genes have been identified.11 In tobacco BY-2, of the ∼10 000 genes that could be analyzed by cDNA–AFLP-based gene profiling, ∼1300 were regulated by the cell cycle.12Cell proliferation needs division and partitioning of organelles such as mitochondria and plastids. However, there is no information on periodic gene expressions with respect to mitochondrial division in yeast or animal cells. Furthermore, in the research of the periodic expression in A. thaliana or tobacco BY-2, mitochondrial and plastid divisions were not shown. Mammalian, plant and yeast cells contain many organelles whose divisions occur at random, cannot be synchronized and have shapes that are very diverse and complicated.13 Therefore, genes related to such organelles are not reflected in microarray analyses of the cell cycle in higher organisms. In previous cell cycle studies, the analysis has been based on nuclear proliferation only. Eukaryotic cells, however, have double-membrane-bound organelles, such as the nucleus, mitochondria and plastids, and single-membrane-bound organelle such as ER, the Golgi body, vacuoles (lysosomes) and microbodies. Organelle proliferation is very important for cell functions, as well as differentiation and cell division. However, there are few studies that have investigated the organelle proliferation cycle.The unicellular red alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae has advantages for investigating organelle proliferation as it has a minimum set of organelles,14–16 and organelle division can be synchronized by a light/dark cycle.17 The mitochondrial and plastid division requires the FtsZ,18,19 the Dynamin20,21 and the MD/PD rings.22,23 Northern blot analysis has shown that each transcriptional level of ftsz1 for mitochondrial division, and ftsZ2 for the plastid division, has a peak per cell cycle before each division.18 Moreover, nuclear, mitochondrial and plastid genomes of C. merolae have completely been sequenced.24–27 As the nucleus genome 4775 ORF's coding protein includes 27 introns only, newly designed proteins by alternative splicing are few; therefore, the functioning protein is directly identified as the same gene. Furthermore, most ORFs do not have paralogues.24 We thought that novel organelle division-related genes like ftsZ genes could be found by genome-wide transcriptome of the cell cycle.2. Materials and methods2.1. Synchronous culture and fluorescence microscopyCyanidioschyzon merolae 10D-14 were synchronized according to the method discussed in Suzuki et al.17 Cells were cultured in 2× Allen's medium at pH 2.3. Flasks were shaken under continuous light (40 W/m2) at 42°C. The cells were sub-cultured to <107 cells/mL, and then synchronized by subjecting them to a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle at 42°C while the medium was aerated. For the observation of DNA, the cells were fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde diluted with 2× Allen's medium and stained with 1 µg/mL DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole phosphate). Images were viewed using an epifluorescence microscope (BX51; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) with 3CCD digital camera (C77780; Hamamatsu Photonics, Tokyo, Japan) under ultraviolet excitation. The cultures were harvested every 2 h, and indexes of organelle division were counted.2.2. Reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reactionCells were collected by centrifuging at 1400g for 3 min and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Nuclear acid isolation buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH7.6, 100 mM EDTA, 300 mM NaCl, 4% SDS, 2% N-lauroylsarcosine sodium salt) pre-warmed at 60°C was added to the frozen cell pellets. The lysate was added to an equal volume of PCI (phenol:chloroform:isoamylalcohol = 25:24:1). The aqueous phase was recovered by centrifuging at 15 000g for 5 min at 4°C and re-extracted using PCI. Total nucleus acid was precipitated by adding an equal volume of isopropanol and recovered by centrifugation at 15 000g for 15 min at 4°C. The pellet was melted in DNase I solution (0.1 U/μL DNase I, RNase Free; Roshe, 0.4 U/μL RNase Inhibitor; Sigma, 10 mM DTT, 10 mM MgCl2) and incubated for 45 min at 37°C. Total RNA was precipitated by adding an equal volume of isopropanol and recovered by centrifugation at 15 000g for 15 min at 4°C.The RNA samples were reverse-transcribed in 20 µL of the reaction mix comprising 1 µL of Reverse Transcriptase XL (AMV; TaKaRa Bio Inc.), 50 ng/μL of oligo(dT) primer (Novagen), 2 U/μL of RNase inhibitor and 0.5 mM dNTP mixture (TaKaRa Bio Inc.). The reaction conditions were as follows: 10 min at 25°C, 45 min at 42°C and 10 min at 70°C. Absence of genomic DNA contamination was confirmed by PCR in all the total RNA samples. In the RT–PCR assay, cDNA of ftsZ2-1, ftsZ2-2 and the housekeeping gene ef-1a were amplified by 22 PCR cycles. The quantity of PCR products was analyzed by electrophoresis in 2% agarose gel. The primers used in PCR were described in Supplementary Table S1.2.3. Microarray manufactureOn the basis of the annotated C. merolae genome, we ordered synthesis of the ORF-specific oligonucleotides for Sigam Genosys and searched a unique 50-mer sequence for each of the 4586 ORF-coding protein genes (>96% of the ORFs in the nucleus genome). In brief, 50-mer sequences were first selected from ORF sequences based on a set of criteria that included Tm of 75 ± 10°C. Ninety-eight percent of the ORFs-specific oligonucleotides were selected among 1.5 kb from the 3′ end of the ORF. All the oligonucleotides were synthesized (Sigma Genosys), resuspended into 30% (v/v) DMSO and spotted onto poly-lysine–coated glass slides, using a spotting machine (SPBIO, Hitachi Software Engineering Co.). Methods of spotting were referred to the protocol of the Brown lab in Stanford University (http://cmgm.stanford.edu/pbrown/). Spotted microarray glasses were stored at room temperature in a dry cabinet for later use.2.4. aRNA fluorescence labelingAmino-allyl aRNA was synthesized using an Amino-Allyl MessageAmp aRNA Kit (Ambion, TX, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. It was transcribed in the presence of amino-allyl dUTP by templating double-strand cDNA synthesized using T7 oligo(dT) primer. Cy3- or Cy5-congugated aRNA was prepared by mixing Cy (GE Healthcare 1vial/45ul dissolved in DMSO) and 5 µg amino-allyl aRNA in coupling buffer (0.1 M NaHCO3, pH 9.0), incubating for 60 min at 40°C and then purified by a Bio Spin-Column (Bio-Rad) and microcon-YM30 spin-column (Millipore).2.5. Microarray hybridizationHybridization solution (5× SSC, 0.5% SDS, 4× Denhalt's solution, 10% formamid, 100 ng/μL Salmon Sperm DNA) and Cy3-congugated aRNA was hybridized to spotted microarray slides covered with a coverglass (Matsunami) in a slide hybridization chamber (Sigma) for 18 h at 55°C. Hybridized slides were washed in 1× SSC/0.03% SDS for 6 min at 45°C, followed by 0.2× SSC for 5 min and 0.05× SSC for 4 min, and then spin-dried before scanning.2.6. Microarray data miningMicroarray slides were scanned using an FLA-8000 scanner (FujiFilm) at a wavelength of 532 and 635 nm in the 5-μm resolution. Gene Spot signals on microarray images were measured by the microarray analyzing software ArrayGauge Ver.2 (FujiFilm). As for data at each time point, it was subtracted the average value from 2 to 50 h. Data were analyzed by microarray data mining software AVADIS (Hitachi software). To collect cell cycle expression genes, hierarchical clustering was performed. In hierarchical clustering analysis for gene direction, the distance metric and linkage rule were set for Euclidean and Complete, respectively. Cell cycle regulated genes collected by hierarchical clustering analysis were separated into four groups by K-means clustering. In K-Means clustering analysis for gene direction, distance metric and four number of clusters and numbers of iterations were set for Euclidean, 4 and 50, respectively.3. Results and discussion3.1. Synchronization of the cell nucleus, mitochondrial and plastid divisions in C. merolaeOrganelle division in C. merolae can be synchronized by a light dark cycle.17 Fig. 1A shows typical interphase and mitotic cells fixed at 8 and 18 h after the start of the synchronous culture. Interphase cells had one cell nucleus, a mitochondrial nucleus (nucleoid) and one spherical plastid, whereas mitotic cells contained a dividing cell nucleus, mitochondrion and plastid. On the basis of the previous and present observations, these divisions are illustrated relative to the cell cycle in Fig. 1B. The type I cell is in the G1-phase in which the nucleus is spherical, the mitochondrion flat and the plastid (chloroplast) cup-shaped (Fig. 1BI). Type II cells in the G2-phase contain a cell nucleus that is larger than type I, and a plastid whose volume is increased, indicating that division has been initiated (Fig. 1BII). In type III cells, the M-phase is initiated and the nucleus begins to form a football-like structure. Mitochondrial division begins and plastid division is more advanced. The microbody has moved to the region of mitochondrial division (Fig. 1BIII). In type IV cells, organelle divisions are more advanced (Fig. 1BIV). In type V cells, the mitochondrion remains as a single body and its division is still not finished, while the plastid has divided in two (Fig. 1BV). In type VI cells, the cell nucleus is dividing without chromosome condensation, the mitochondrion dividing prior to cell nuclear separation, and the microbody is dividing (Fig. 1BVI). In type VII, cytokinesis has been initiated after cell nuclear separation and microbody division (Fig. 1AVII). Therefore, types II–IV, III–V and III–VI cells show plastid, mitochondrial and cell nuclear division, respectively.Synchronous culture of C. merolae.

(D) RT–PCR assay during the first synchronized organelle division.In synchronized culture, the cells were taken at 2 h intervals for a period of 50 h to ensure that at least two complete cell cycles were covered. Fig. 1C shows the index of cell nuclear, mitochondrial and plastid division, counted according to shape of the cell in Fig 1B. The main period of plastid division took 4 h, from 16 to 20 h and from 34 to 38 h (Fig. 1C). Mitochondrial division took place about 3.5 h, from 17 to 20.5 h and from 35 to 38 h, and nuclear division took place about 3.5 h, from 17 to 21 h and 35.5 to 38 h (Fig. 1C). The mitotic cycle phase was defined by observing the change in nuclear morphology. An increase in cell nuclear volume in the S-phase occurred from 12 to 15 h and from 31 to 34 h, and the cell nuclear division period (M-phase) occurred from 17 to 21 h and 35.5 to 38 h (Fig. 2C).Scattered plot of transcriptional levels at 14 and 22 h in microarray analysis. The color circle indicated green <0.5-fold ≤ blue < 2-fold ≤ red. The values, 0.5 and 2, is the ratio of (signal at 14 h/signal at 22 h).

This result showed that most genes related to organelle division were expressed synchronously at 14 h in late S-phase. Therefore, microarray analysis was performed in the synchronous culture.3.2. Detection of organelle division genes by microarray analysisMicroarray of C. merolae can identify 4586 genes for >96% of all known and predicted C. merolae gene-coding proteins. We tested whether the microarray could analyze the induction of organelle division genes. Microarray analysis between 14 and 22 h showed that ftsZ2-1 and ftsZ2-2 were strongly induced at 14 h (Fig. 2). Moreover, expressions of cmdnm2 involved in plastid division, and ftsZ1-1 involved in mitochondrial division, were stronger at 14 h compared with 22 h. ftsZ1-2 did not show a remarkable induction, but its expression was slightly stronger at 14 h compared with 22 h. Expression of cmdnm1 that was constantly expressed during the cell cycle20 showed a constant expression and was found to be near the diagonal showing constant expression. These results were consistent with previous experiments and showed that the microarray could analyze time-specific gene expression.3.3. Identification of genes induced during S-, G2- and M-phases by microarray analysisThe microarray analysis of two cell cycles from 2 to 50 hrs, in addition to the previously known periodic genes such as ftsZ1 and ftsZ2, identified 358 cell cycle-regulated genes by hierarchical clustering. They were classified by K-means clustering analysis into four expression patterns, early G1 group, late G1 group, S group and G2-M group. This grouping showed that ftsZ2 and cmdnm2 were strongly induced in the S- and G2-M phases, respectively (Fig. 3A and B). Therefore, in the present study, as the genes related to cell nuclear and organelle division were induced during the S- and G2-M phases, we focused on the genes grouped into these category.Heatmaps and oscillations of genes in S or G2-M groups. (Aa) The heatmap of transcriptional levels of genes in the S-phase group. Genes correspond to the rows, and the time points form the columns. Red and green indicate induction and suppression of genes expression, respectively. (Ab) The oscillations of transcriptional levels in the S-phase group. This group contained ftsZ2-1 and ftsZ2-2.

(C) Real-time RT–PCR assay of some genes in the S-phase group. ftsZ2-2, pcna, cyclin E2, cyclin A and smc1, which were assigned in the S-phase, were confirmed to have peak in S phase.

Twelve genes were related to cell cycle progression such as cyclin E2/CML219C, cdk2/CMH128C and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2/CMS304C. 51 genes were related to cell nuclear function such as DNA replication, and chromosome segregation and organization. The genes characteristically induced were: DNA replication; pcna/CMS101C, mcm3/CMH264C and mcm6/CMJ261C, chromosome segregation; α-tubulin /CMT504C,28 β-tubulin /CMN263C and γ-tubulin /CMN304C, chromosome organization; histone gene set and smc4/CME029C. In addition to the nucleus, genes related to mitochondria and plastids could be identified. 5 genes were related to mitochondrial function. ftsZ1-1, ftsZ1-2 and mda129 were involved in mitochondrial division; moreover, the outer mitochondrial membrane protein, porin/CMO111C and NADH dehydrogenase I (Complex I) beta subcomplex 7/CMC099C, were also induced. 5 genes were related to plastid function. ftsZ2-1, ftsZ2-2 and cmdnm2/CMN262C were involved in chloroplast division. 2 plastid terminal oxidases/CMI243C and CMI244C were also induced. 3 genes, including vps29/CMR405, Rab family protein/CMF181C and CMQ189C, related to vesicle trafficking were induced, and they might be involved in the partitioning of the ER, the Golgi body and endosome.List of genes induced during S or G2-M phaseGene ID and Annotation were shown by the C. merolae genome project.

Phase refers to phase when transcriptional level had peaks in microarray analysis, Fold describes log2(max − min of transcriptional levels); Ev, expect value by SMART or Conserved domain search (CDs).The changes in ftsZ2-1 and ftsZ2-2 transcription levels in the microarray analysis were consistent with those in the RT–PCR assay, supporting effective microarray detection of the change of gene expressions. The expression pattern of some genes, strongly induced in the S or G2-M phases, were analyzed by real-time RT–PCR assay. ftsz2-2, pcna, cyclin E2, cyclinA/CMI203C and smc1/CMI192C, which were assigned to the S-phase by microarray analysis, peaked in the late S-phase (Fig. 3C). cmdnm2, α-tubulin, histone H1/CMN183C, cyclinB/CMI227C, cdk2/CMH128C, smc4/CME029C, condensin kleisin I subunit/CMF069C, which were assigned to the G2-M phase, peaked in the G2- or M-phase (Fig. 3D). These results also supported the accuracy of microarray data in the present analysis.In the division of the mitochondria and plastids, it is very important that ftsZ1-1, ftsZ1-2, mda1, ftsZ2-1, ftsZ2-2 and cmdnm2 have been identified in the S- or G2/M-phase groups. mdv1 and caf4, mda1 homologue in S. cerevisiae, do not show periodic expression in the cell cycle (Saccharomyces Genome Database: http://www.yeastgenome.org/). Moreover, transcriptions of ftsZ2 and cmdnm2 homologues in A. thaliana are also not considered periodic in microarray analysis11 because mitochondria in yeast and animal cells take various shapes and perform fission and fusion randomly. Similarly, synchronous division of mitochondria and plastids do not occur in higher plants. In C. merolae, as organelles divide synchronously, microarray analysis could be utilized to investigate organelle divisions. It was thought that gene expression profiles during the S- and G2-M-phases were important clues for finding novel genes related to organelle division.3.4. Candidates for novel genes involved in organelle divisionUnknown genes periodically expressed during the S- and G2-M-phase groups can be candidates for novel genes involved in cell nucleus and organelle division. The S and G2-M groups comprised a total of 158 genes including 93 known, 46 hypothetical and 19 hypothetical conserved genes. The hypothetical and hypothetical conserved genes were unknown, and searched for using BlastP, CDs: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/wrpsb.cgi and SMART: http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/ (Table 1). The hypothetical genes were specific to C. merolae, the hypothetical conserved had a conserved domain that had significant hits on genes in other organisms. Therefore, the 19 hypothetical conserved genes were good candidates for novel organelle division genes because they are possible for analyzing organelle division in eukaryotes. We grouped candidate genes with known genes into the S, G2 and M phases to show a tendency of function and localization by the phase of expression peaks (Fig. 4). Genes involved in the cell nucleus were widely found among the S-, G2- and M-phase groups. The S-phase group included genes related to DNA replication, and G2- and M-phase groups included genes related to chromosome segregation and organization. The genes involved in mitochondria and plastids were mainly contained in the S group. This suggested that candidate genes contained in the S group were more related to division of organelles such as mitochondria and plastids. In the candidate, 11, 3 and 5 genes were contained in the S, G2 and M groups, respectively. Therefore, 11 genes in the S group might be more related to organelle division, while the 3 and 5 genes in the G2 and M groups might be involved in cell nucleus division.The list of genes related to the function in cell nucleus and organelle, and unknown genes in the S-, G2- or M-phase groups.

The predictions of the S genes were, as expected, occupied by mitochondria and plastids. The G2 genes were predicted to relate to the cell nucleus and ER. The M genes were involved in cell nucleus and microbody and mitochondria. These predictions were consistent with the order of organelle division in C. merolae, i.e. plastid, mitochondrion, finally cell nucleus and microbody (Fig. 1B). These results must provide a tool for the analyzing the genes for organelle division.Predicted localization of unknown genes by PSORTPsort server; http://psort.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/.

IntroductionDevelopmental biologists have long held a view that development naturally progresses from totipotent fertilized eggs with unlimited differentiation potential to terminally differentiated cells, like a ball rolling from high to low points on a slope as depicted in Waddington's epigenetic landscape.1 The epigenetic landscape also points to another important aspect of development, which is the emergence of different cell lineages during the development; cells in specific developmental lineages are thought to take discrete paths (‘chreodes’) on the imaginary slope. Analogy of cell's developmental potency to the potential energy is thus widely accepted2,3 This analogy is also relevant to the fact that converting differentiated cells into pluripotent cells is difficult. In mammals, nuclear transplantation (cloning)4,5 had been the only way to achieve such a ‘up-hill battle’ reprogramming, until the successful production of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells by infecting MEFs with retroviruses carrying expression cassettes for four genes (Myc, Pou5f1, Sox2 and Klf4).6 Notwithsanding its importance, the potency has only been defined operationally by in vitro and in vivo cell differentiation assays as ‘the total of all fates of a cell or tissue region which can be achieved by any environmental manipulation'.7 Nuclear transplantation experiments, where the success rate gradually decreases according to developmental stages of donor cells, provide yet another operational definition of developmental potential.8–10 We previously showed a possibility to derive a scale of developmental potency from the global gene expression (transcript) profile data, but the data could not be that quantitative because of the use of a limited number of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) for the analysis.11 The work also did not address the issue of cell linege separations.Mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells12,13 and embryonic germ (EG) cells14,15 are prototypical stem cells. These cells can be maintained as undifferentiated state in culture (self-renewal) and have the capacity to differentiate into essentially all the cell types (pluripotency). Therefore, these pluripotent stem cells provide tractable systems to study the developmental potency and cell lineage separation. It has been shown that the manipulation of cell culture condition or a single-gene expression level can differentiate ES cells into relatively homogenous cell population that are similar to the first three lineages in mammalian development:16 primitive ectoderm/neural ectoderm,17,18 trophoblast19,20 and primitive endoderm.21 In the first system, ES cells are cultured in monolayer in N2B27 medium, which drives undifferentiated ES cells into neural lineages.17 Previous DNA microarray analysis indicates that this in vitro ES cell differentiation process mimics in vivo cell differentiation to primitive ectoderm, neural ectoderm and subsequently neurons/glia cells.18 In the second system, ES cells are engineered to downregulate Pou5f1 (Oct3/4, Oct4) expression in a tetracycline-controllable manner (ZHBTc4 cell line19). It has been shown that repression of Pou5f1 induces the differentiation of ES cells into trophoblast lineage.19,20 In the third system, ES cells that are engineered to overexpress Gata6 in a dexamethasone-inducible manner differentiate into primitive endoderm (extraembryonic endoderm).21 Although the analyses of these ES cell differentiation systems have revealed the detailed changes of gene expression patterns, it remains to see whether the global comparison among these individual systems provide any further insights into developmental potency and cell lineage separation.Here we show that principal component analysis (PCA), which can reduce the dimensionality of the gene expression profiles,22 maps cells in a multidimensional transcript profile space where the positions of differentiating cells progress in a stepwise manner along trajectories starting from undifferentiated ES cells located in the apex to the first three lineages in mammalian development: primitive endoderm, trophoblast and primitive ectoderm/neural ectoderm. Furthermore, EG cells and iPS cells are mapped near the origin of the trajectories, whereas mouse embryo fibroblast (MEF) and fibroblast cell lines are mapped near the far end of the trajectories.2. Materials and methods2.1 Cells and RNAsFor the majority of cells used in this study, we used a stock of Cy3-labeled cRNA samples that were used in our previous studies. The details of each cell types, their culture conditions, RNA extractions and Cy3-labeling can be found in the main text of this manuscript and in earlier publications.18,20,23–25 Cells cultured for this study and the culture conditions are as follows. G0–G5 cells: Production and characterization of 5G6GR ES cell clones that are engineered to overexpress Gata6 in a dexamethasone-inducible manner are described previously.21 ES cells were harvested every 24 h (Day 0–5) during differentiation in the presence of 100 mM dexamethasone (Sigma). F0–F5 cells: Undifferentiated F9 EC cells (ATCC number: CRL-1720) were treated with 100 nM all-trans-retinoic acid (RA, Sigma) and 1 mM dibutyryl cAMP (dbcAMP, Sigma) on adherent condition as reported.26 Photos of F9 EC cells during differentiation are available as Supplementary Fig. S1 of the published paper.27 F9 cells were harvested every 24 h (Day 0–5) during the differentiation. Both iPS-Fbxo156 and iPS-Nanog28 were cultured on the STO feeder cells as described previously. To remove the feeder cells, the iPS cells were passaged twice on the gelatin-coated culture dish and harvested for RNA extraction. NIH3T3, STO, MEF_BL6 and MEF_DR4 were cultured under the standard condition and harvested for RNA extraction. Total RNAs isolated for this study were labeled with Cy3-dye and used for the DNA microarray hybridization.2.2 Microarray data analysisDNA microarray analysis was carried out as described previously,18 except for the addition of ES cell total RNAs to the Universal Mouse Reference RNA (UMRR) and the use of a 4 × 44K microarray platform. In our previous DNA microarray studies,23 we used the Universal Mouse Reference RNA (UMRR: Stratagene), which is a mixture of total RNAs from 11 different mouse cell lines. However, to increase the representation of genes expressed in ES cells for the current study, we mixed the UMRR with total RNAs from ES cells (MC1, derived from 129S6/SvEvTac strain) cultured in the undifferentiated condition with LIF at 2:1 ratio. These UMRR plus ES RNAs were labeled with Cy5-dye, mixed with Cy3-labeled samples and used for DNA microarray hybridization. To maximize the uniformity of the microarray data, all the samples, including the ones analyzed by DNA microarray previously, were hybridized to the same platform (the NIA Mouse 44K Microarray v3.023 manufactured by Agilent Technologies #015 087). The intensity of each gene feature per array was extracted from scanned microarray images using Feature Extraction 9.5.1.1 software (Agilent Technologies) as described previously.23 Hierarchical clustering analysis and PCA (see Section 2.3) were carried out using an application developed in-house to perform ANOVA and other analyses (NIA Array Analysis software; http://lgsun.grc.nia.nih.gov/ANOVA/).22 Three-dimensional PCA figures were generated using the virtual reality modeling language (VRML) function of the NIA Array Analysis software22 and visualized by Cortona Vrml client (http://www.parallelgraphics.com/products/cortona/). To produce plots and lists of genes for Fig. 2, we used the R-statistical package29 and only non-redundant set of oligonucleotide probes (a total of 25 164 probes/genes). Of these, 21 890 genes were significant in ANOVA with FDR < 0.05 and used for further analyses. Genes correlated to each cell lineage trajectory were identified based on the correlation of >0.90. All the DNA microarray data have been deposited in the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) and are accessible through GEO Series accession number (GSE11 523) and the NIA Array Analysis software website (http://lgsun.grc.nia.nih.gov/ANOVA/).222.3 Principal component analysisPrincipal component analysis is a statistical method to find major patterns in data variation, which is increasingly used for the analysis of gene expression microarray data.22,30–32 Each principal component (PC) is a linear combination of log-transformed expression values of all genes, and all components are orthogonal, i.e. mutually independent. The first few PCs, which explain most of the observed variance, are the most important; the remaining PCs often represent random fluctuations. Therefore, by plotting data against the first two or three PCs, one can reduce the dimensionality of the data without losing much of information. Contribution of genes to each PC (which may be positive or negative) is determined by singular value decomposition algorithm applied to the covariance matrix. Knowing these contributions, the entire gene expression profile of a given cell type can be represented by a single point in a two- or three-dimensional space. If two cell types are represented by closely located points in the PCA plot, global gene expression profiles of these cells are very similar. In contrast, if corresponding points in the PCA plot are far apart, their global expression profiles are very different. The detailed discussion of PCA plots and interpretation of DNA microarray data can be found in the previous publication.323. Results and discussionTo obtain accurate, comprehensive and comparable expression profiles, we carried out all the DNA microarray analyses within a few weeks using the same platform containing essentially all genes encoded on the mouse genome.23 Although two ES cell differentiation systems have been profiled previously using the earlier version of the array platform,18,20 we carried out the DNA microarray analysis again for the data consistency. In the first system, ES cells are cultured in monolayer in N2B27 medium for 6 days, which drives undifferentiated ES cells into neural lineages.17 RNAs were isolated and analyzed every day during the induction and RNAs (N0–N6: Fig. 1A). Previous DNA microarray analysis has been carried out using the array platform containing a limited number of genes, but indicates that this in vitro ES cell differentiation process mimics in vivo cell differentiation to primitive ectoderm, neural ectoderm and, subsequently, neurons/glia cells.18 In the second system, ES cells that are engineered to downregulate Pou5f1 (Oct3/4, Oct4) expression in a tetracycline-controllable manner (ZHBTc4 cell line differentiate into trophoblast lineage for 5 days).19,20 RNAs were isolated and analyzed every day during the induction (Z0–Z5 in Fig. 1A). To include the first three lineages of mammalian development,16 we added a third system: ES cells that are engineered to overexpress Gata6 in a dexamethasone-inducible manner differentiate into primitive endoderm (extra-embryonic endoderm) for 5 days21 (G0–G5 in Fig. 1A). We also carried out microarray analysis of a fourth system: F9 embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells differentiate into parietal endoderm—one of the extra-embryonic endoderm lineages for 5 days26,27 (F0–F5 in Fig. 1A). For comparison, we also analyzed P19 EC cells before (P0) and after 4 days of RA induction (P4); neural stem/progenitor (NS) cells derived from adult mouse brain and their differentiated cells21 (DC); and trophoblast stem (TS) cells26 and E12.5 placenta (PL).27 Altogether we obtained the DNA microarray data of 32 different cell types in duplicate.Global gene expression profiles of 32 different cell types. Names of the cells and their abbreviated forms are shown. Color coding corresponds with the colors in all other figures. DNA microarray analysis was carried out in duplicate: for each cell type, two independent cell cultures were prepared and used for separate DNA microarray analysis. Reproducibility between two microarray data for each cell type was very high as shown by the Pearson correlation coefficient (mean 0.9927; SD 0.0043; range 0.9788–0.9966). The average of two samples is shown here. (A) Hierarchical clustering analysis. (B) Principal component analysis (PCA).

Individual cell types are mapped in the 3D space according to the first three principal components (PC1, PC2 and PC3). A movie file is available as Supplementary Video S1.We first carried out the hierarchical clustering analysis of these microarray data. Although the hierarchical clustering analysis grouped cells mostly into each differentiation system (Fig. 1A), it showed only the degree of similarity between different cell types and did not provide any insights into the relationship between the different cell lineages. To further analyze the data, we employed PCA, which can reduce the dimensionality of the gene expression profiles and map individual cells in a multidimensional space according to their global gene expression patterns (see Section 2.3 for the explanation of PCA). We first mapped the cells in the 3D transcript profile space (PC1, PC2 and PC3) (Fig. 1B). PCA of all these microarray data uncovered three major paths of differentiation from undifferentiated ES cells in 3D transcript profile space (Fig. 1B; Supplementary Video S1). Each path showed progressive changes in global expression patterns toward specific cell lineages: trophectoderm (Z0–Z5), extra-embryonic endoderm (G0–G5; F0–F5) and neural tissues (N0–N6). We call these paths ‘cell lineage trajectories,32’ because the cell differentiation process can be visualized as a trajectory in the multidimensional transcript profile space.What do these trajectories represent? Because the transcript profile space is constructed from the expression patterns of genes, the changes in gene expression patterns are reflected in the changes in the position of a cell. To find gene expression changes that are correlated with these trajectories, we first drew a line for each cell lineage so that the squared distances from the cells of the lineage were minimized. The locations of other cell types, such as TS and NS, were projected onto the closest lineage trajectory (Fig. 1B). The x-axis of Fig. 2 shows the coordinates of these cell types on each trajectory (Fig. 2A–C). We then searched for sets of genes that were positively correlated with each trajectory line. We identified 1738 genes for the primitive endoderm lineage (Fig. 2A; Supplementary Table S1), 2311 genes for the trophoblast lineage (Fig. 2B; Supplementary Table S2) and 2463 genes for the primitive ectoderm/neural lineage (Fig. 2C; Supplementary Table S3) with a correlation of >0.90. The expression levels of these genes gradually increased as ES cells differentiated into each lineage (see Supplementary data for examples of gene expression changes). The average expression levels of these genes (y-axis in Fig. 2: cell lineage index32) can thus be used as surrogates for the coordinates of cell's positions on each trajectory (x-axis in Fig. 2). This lineage trajectory, therefore, not only defines a path to the fates of individual cell lineages, but also provides a scale for the extent of commitment/differentiation.Average expression levels of selected genes correlate well with the locations of each cell type in PCA coordinates. See Fig. 1A for the abbreviated names of the cells. Each point shows DNA microarray data for each sample; therefore, each cell type is represented by two points. (A) Primitive endoderm lineage, represented by the list of 1738 genes (Supplementary Table S1). (B) Trophoblast lineage, represented by the list of 2311 genes (Supplementary Table S2). (C) Primitive ectoderm/neural lineage, represented by the list of 2463 genes (Supplementary Table S3).Average expression levels of selected genes correlate well with the locations of each cell type in PCA coordinates. See Fig. 1A for the abbreviated names of the cells. Each point shows DNA microarray data for each sample; therefore, each cell type is represented by two points.

(C) Primitive ectoderm/neural lineage, represented by the list of 2463 genes (Supplementary Table S3).This notion was further supported by examining the locations of cells cultured and profiled independently in the transcript profile space: P19 EC cells before (P0) and after 4 days of RA induction (P4); NS cells derived from adult mouse brain and their differentiated cells18 (DC); and TS cells25,33 and E12.5 PL.25 These cells were mapped onto the transcript profile space based on their global gene expression profiles. As we expected, we found that P0, P4, NS and DC mapped near the primitive ectoderm/neural lineage trajectory (Figs 1B and 2C). Interestingly, the position of P0 was consistent with the notion that in contrast to ES cells, undifferentiated P19 EC cells are more committed and equivalent to primitive ectoderm cells.18 The position of P4 was also consistent with the notion that P19 EC cells differentiate into neuron-like cells after the induction with RA.34 Consistent with their known differentiation status, TS and PL mapped near the trophoblast lineage trajectory (Figs 1B and 2B). Two extra-embryonic endoderm lineages, which were represented by F9 EC cell differentiation26,35 (F0–F5) and ES cells driven by Gata621 (G0–G5), also showed lineage trajectories close to each other (Figs 1B and 2A). Taken together, these data support the notion that cell differentiation can be visualized as cell lineage trajectories in 3D transcript profile space.We also noticed that these cell lineage trajectories represent the gradual loss of developmental potency or potential of cells (Fig. 1B). To examine this point further, we carried out microarray analysis of 12 additional cell types, including three undifferentiated ES cell lines (MC1, derived from 129S6/SvEvTac; MC2, derived from C57BL/6J; D3_GL; and EBRTcH3) and two undifferentiated EG cell lines [TGC8.5_5, derived from the primordial germ cell (PGC) of E8.5 C57BL/6J embryo; and EG1, derived from the PGC of E9 129 embryo].24 We also analyzed the expression profiles of MEF cells, stromal cells (STO) and a fibroblast cell line (NIH3T3). We then analyzed iPS cells, which have been established by infecting MEFs with retroviruses carrying expression cassettes for four genes (Myc, Pou5f1, Sox2 and Klf4).6,28 We used two different iPS lines: one was established by using Fbxo15 promoter-driven GFP as an indicator of pluripotency6 and the other was established by using Nanog promoter-GFP as an indicator of pluripotency.28Hierarchical clustering analysis of the microarray data of all 44 cell types (original 32 cell types and 12 additional cell types; see Supplementary data for detail) showed that undifferentiated ES and EG cells were clustered together with iPS cells, whereas NIH3T3 fibroblast cells, STO stromal cells and MEF cells were clustered together (Fig. 3A). However, it was difficult to assess the overall relationship among all the cell types analyzed here. We, therefore, analyzed the microarray data of all 44 cell types by PCA (Fig. 3B; Supplementary Video S2). Interestingly, an overall structure of the transcript profile space remained essentially the same as that obtained by 32 cell types (Fig. 1B). The majority of the cells were aligned along the three major cell lineage trajectories, except for fibroblast and stromal cells (NIH3T3, STO and MEFs). The fact that these cells did not fall into any of the three cell lineage trajectories is consistent with their mesodermal origin. Their locations near the bottom of all three trajectory lines also support the general trend that these cell lineage trajectories represent the gradual loss of developmental potency of cells (Fig. 1B). Indeed, undifferentiated ES and EG cells mapped near the apex of the trajectory figures, as expected (Fig. 3B). Similarly, the iPS cells mapped near the apex of the trajectories. It has been demonstrated that these iPS cells have the complete phenotype of pluripotent cells, including germline competency in the case of iPS-Nanog.28 Considering that the iPS cells are derived from MEFs, changing the locations of cells from positions with low developmental potency (MEFs) to those with high developmental potency (iPSs) strongly supports our notion that PCA analysis can visualize and predict the developmental potency of cells.Global gene expression profiles of 44 different cell types.

The PCA figures (Figs 1B and 3B) show remarkable similarity to the conceptual picture of Waddington's epigenetic landscape, where cell lineage trajectories represent creodes.1 Such a concept has been taken for granted by embryologists for over a century, but it now seems to be substantiated by the global gene expression patterns. The locations of cells in the multidimensional transcript profile space can be used to identify cells of unknown origin, determine the differentiation status of cells and to assess the developmental potency of cells, possibly without going through experimental manipulation and testing of the cells. The present work also provides a framework for the future study of ES cell differentiation by visualizing the direction to which cells are going to differentiate.Supplementary DataSupplementary data are available online at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was entirely supported by the Intramural Research Program of National Institutes of Health, National Institute on Aging (Z01 AG000662).We thank Drs.

IntroductionCultivated barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) is a true diploid with genome size estimated to be ca. 5000 Mb.1 In order to approach this large genome, several projects have generated significant numbers of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) (ca. 500 000) (see HarvEST database http://harvest.ucr.edu/). These large numbers of ESTs may represent most of the barley genome's transcripts.Sato et al. (submitted for publication) assigned linkage map positions to 2890 non-redundant 3′ ESTs, providing the densest, reliable barley map available. Other projects have also mapped more than 1000 barley ESTs2 (see also http://harvest.ucr.edu/), but these are consensus maps. Barley ESTs were also mapped on chromosome deletion stocks to estimate their physical locations.3,4 These mapped ESTs will promote the analysis of barley genome structure and are an essential foundation for genome sequencing based on high quality genome libraries.5,6Quality-controlled barley EST sequences were used to develop a GeneChip oligo-microarray7 for analyzing global expression of transcripts in different organs and/or various growth stages.8 However, EST-based microarrays often lack complete gene annotation due to the lower homology between partial sequences of cDNAs (ESTs) and the reference-sequenced plant genomes (e.g. rice and Arabidopsis). Full-length (FL) cDNA sequences are essential for annotation of genome sequences via transcript mapping.There are several procedures for developing an FLcDNA library. Of those, the biotinylated CAP trapper method gives a high level of complete coding sequences (CDSs) in FLcDNAs.9,10 Using this technique, a significant amount of plant FLcDNA sequences was generated. The first comprehensive (14 668) set of FLcDNA sequences was published for Arabidopsis thaliana.11 These FLcDNAs traced to 19 different mRNA samples, covering most of the transcripts in this model plant species for gene annotation. The rice (Oryza sativa) FLcDNA project was the second in plants and released 28 469 sequences.12 In both cases, released genome sequences were already available so that the FLcDNAs assisted in mapping transcripts.13The number of organs in plants is limited, compared with animals, which have various organs with specific profiles of gene expression. The ‘body map’ described the spectrum of transcripts from each organ of the human body collected from organ-specific mRNA samples.14 The FLcDNA projects in both Arabidopsis11 and rice12 used stress conditions rather than organs to achieve higher transcript coverage. The stress induction of transcripts is a frequently used approach in plant EST projects including barley (http://pgrc.ipk-gatersleben.de/cr-est/liball.php) and poplar.15 Even if the stress conditions are similar, responses to specific stresses could be different among plant species.Barley has special features compared with other plant species. It was one of the earliest crops domesticated in the Near East,16 and it is well adapted to semi-arid conditions. It was also known to be more tolerant to salt than wheat in ancient Mesopotamia,17 but it is the cereal crop most sensitive to aluminum toxicity under acid soil conditions.18Within the evolutionary tree of the grass family (Poaceae), which involves many important cereal species, e.g. rice and maize, barley (H. vulgare L.) belongs to the tribe Triticeae. This group includes important crop species such as wheat (Tiriticum aestivum L.) and rye (Secale cereale L.).19 The genetic relatedness between barley and other Triticeae species, especially wheat, is well confirmed based on both genetic nucleotide sequences and intergeneric hybridization.20 Triticeae crop species may have a common diploid ancestor with seven pairs of chromosomes, as was well demonstrated by the direct use of primers from barley ESTs to develop a diploid wheat genetic map.21 The relatively high genomic similarity between barley and rice is known since the early synteny analyses based on restriction fragment length polymorphism markers,22,23 and it is used to isolate genes of importance in barley.24,25 Thus, barley cDNA sequences are expected to show high similarity with wheat cDNA sequences and reasonably high similarity with rice cDNA sequences.In the present study, we collected a significant number of barley FLcDNAs by using the biotinylated CAP trapper method.9,10 The FLcDNA sequences were compared with rice and Arabidopsis genes, and we evaluated the spectrum of transcripts represented by Gene Ontology (GO) mapped by InterProScan. The FLcDNA sequences are also compared with transcripts from barley and wheat in order to obtain access to the genomic and genetic resources available in these species.2. Materials and methods2.1 Plant materialsCultivated barley (H. vulgare L.) cv. Haruna Nijo was used to isolate all the RNA samples used in this study. The types of samples are listed in Table 1.Tissues and stages used for generating an FLcDNA library of barley cv. Haruna NijoTissues and stages used for generating an FLcDNA library of barley cv. Haruna NijoFor heat and cold stress treatments, plants were grown on water agar in a growth chamber at 20°C with a 16 h photoperiod and a light intensity 320 µmol/m2/s. The first leaf stage plants were moved to treatment chambers with fluorescent light and exposed to either 40°C (heat treatment) for 24 h or −1°C for 24 h (cold treatment).All the other stress-treated plants were grown in hydroponic culture. Seed samples were placed on the moist filter paper in Petri dishes at 20°C in the dark for 3 days. Seedlings were then mounted on plastic frames with strips of polyurethane foam. Frames were placed over 35 L plastic tanks containing a nutrient solution consisting of the following components (µM): Ca, 1000; Mg, 400; K, 1000; NO3, 3400; NH4, 600; PO4, 100; SO4, 401.1; Cl, 78; Na, 40.2; Fe, 20; B, 23; Mn, 9; Zn, 0.8; Cu, 0.30 and Mo, 0.1. Iron was supplied as Fe-EDTA prepared from equimolar amounts of FeCl3 and Na2EDTA. Throughout the experiment, solutions were constantly aerated. Plants were grown in a growth chamber at 20°C with 16 h photoperiod and a light intensity of 320 µmol/m2/s. After 3 days in the nutrient solution, the solution was completely changed, as described below for each stress. In the Al stress treatment, plants were exposed to 30 µM of AlK(SO4)2·12H2O, which was added to the complete nutrient solution, adjusted to pH 4.3. In the NaCl stress treatment, 0.1 M of NaCl was added to the complete nutrient solution, adjusted to pH 6.0. For the drought treatment, plants were moved from the solution culture to dry filter paper in the same growth chamber. For the wounding stress, seedling leaves were cut for 5 cm from the top to the bottom of the leaf blade.Organ-specific samples were collected at different plant growth stages. Germinated seed samples were collected from entire plants 2 days after germination. Shoots and embryos were collected from 5-day-old seedlings grown on moist filter paper in a Petri dish at 20°C in the dark. Both whole root and whole shoot samples were collected from 60-day-old plants grown under standard field conditions in Okayama University. Leaf blades of the upper three leaves and young spikes (3–5 cm) were collected at the stage of flag leaf emergence. Spikes at a maturing stage (20 days after flowering) were also collected.2.2 RNA preparation and cDNA library constructionTotal RNA was prepared from each of the samples and mixed as described in Table 1, for a total amount of 4 mg. Each sample was ground with a mortar and pestle in the presence of liquid nitrogen. The ground powder was then mixed with 5 volumes of solution (4 M guanidine thiocyanate, 25 mM trisodium citrate dehydrate, 0.5% sodium N-lauroyl sarcosynate, 0.1 M 2-mercaptoethanol). The cellular debris was pelleted out in microtubes (14 000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C). The supernatant was layered on top of 1.1 mL of 5.7 M CsCl cushion solution (5.7 M CsCl, 0.1 M EDTA) to create a step gradient and centrifuged for 16 h in a SW-60Ti rotor (Beckman, CA, USA) at 35 000 rpm in 20°C. The RNA pellet was dissolved in 10 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mM EDTA (pH 7.5). The supernatant was mixed with an equal volume of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and centrifuged at 14 000 rpm for 5 min at 4°C. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube, and the lower phase was mixed with 10 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mM EDTA (pH 7.5) and centrifuged at 14 000 rpm for 5 min at 4°C. The supernatant and the previous supernatant were mixed with the equal volume of chloroform and centrifuged at 14 000 rpm for 5 min at 4°C. The upper phase was collected and mixed with 1/3 volume of 8 M LiCl. The RNA was precipitated at 4°C for 30 min and centrifuged at 14 000 rpm for 30 min. The pellet was washed with 70% ethanol and centrifuged at 14 000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C. The pellet was dried with centrifugal concentrator and dissolved in diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water. The tube was shaken using a tube mixer for 10 min, and the absorbance was measured. RNA samples were stored at −80°C until use.An FLcDNA library was constructed essentially as reported previously9,10 by biotinylated CAP trapper using trehalose-thermoactivated reverse transcriptase.26 The mRNA isolated from RNA samples was quality checked and used for first-strand cDNA synthesis. After oxidation, biotinylation and RNase digestion of first-strand cDNA/mRNA hybrids, FLcDNA/RNA hybrids were captured on magnetic beads. RNA was removed by alkaline treatment to collect first-strand FLcDNA. The oligo(dG)-tailed first-strand cDNA was used for second-strand cDNA synthesis. The cDNA was restricted with BamHI and XhoI. After purification, cDNA was cloned into a pFLC-III vector.2.3 DNA extraction and sequencingPlasmid DNA was extracted with a multiscreen plasmid extraction kit (Millipore) and then purified by precipitation with polyethylene glycol. DNA sequences were determined using the dye terminator cycle sequencing method with ABI 3700 sequencer. DNA clones were subjected to single-pass sequencing from both 3′- and 5′-ends of the cDNA. 3′ ESTs were assembled by phrap (http://www.phrap.org/) to develop contigs and to identify singlets. From each member of each contig, the corresponding 5′ sequences were assembled to align the sequences on 5′-end. When more than two 5′ assembled sequences were grouped, they were assumed to be different transcripts. The clone with the most extended sequence at the 5′-end was assumed as a representative clone to be sequenced. Individual 3′ singlets with 5′ sequences were also assumed to be non-redundant FLcDNA clones to be sequenced. All the representative clones were cycle sequenced by ABI 3700. Primer walking was used to sequence larger insert clones.2.4 Procedure for sequence annotationInterProScan version 4.3 (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/InterProScan/) was installed on an eight-set PC server, using subprograms of coils, blastprodom, superfamily, seg, scanregexp, profilescan, hmmtigr, hmmsmart, hmmpir, hmmpfam, gene3d and fprintscan. The versions of InterPro databases were release 14 for a total of 5006 sequences and release 16.1 for the selected 555 sequences. A PC cluster was established by the software OSCAR 5.0 (http://oscar.openclustergroup.org/), and the FLcDNA sequences were distributed on each server. The output from InterProScan was analyzed to obtain GO categories of each sequence. GO terms in the second hierarchy of the GO database and the GO edit.obo file (date: 19:12:2007 10:07) were used as a top parent of each category. GO terms in the second hierarchy of the GO database described in the edit.obo file (date: 19:12:2007 10:07), listed in the ‘GO term’ of Table 2, were used as a top parent of each category. Categories of a GO term were defined as a set of the top parents that are accessible from the GO term through the GO graph structure. A set of categories of all GO terms obtained by InterProScan was calculated for each FLcDNA, and the number of clones in the category was counted for all of the categories. Blast homology was analyzed on an in-house blast server installed with the software package Dynaclust (Dynacom Co.).InterProScan analysis and molecular function GO for 5006 FL barley cDNA clones and 555 selected clones showing low blastn homology (E>1E-5) with both rice and Arabidopsis genesaCategories with namespace of molecular function are displayed.InterProScan analysis and molecular function GO for 5006 FL barley cDNA clones and 555 selected clones showing low blastn homology (E>1E-5) with both rice and Arabidopsis genesaCategories with namespace of molecular function are displayed.3. Results and discussion3.1 Clone selection and insert sizes of FLcDNAsA total of 45 897 5′ reads and 47 143 3′ reads were sequenced from both ends of cDNA clones. All the 3′-end sequences were assembled by phrap (http://www.phrap.org/), and a total of 4853 contigs and 1613 singlets were identified from the assembly. For each of the 4853 3′ contig members, respective 5′-end sequences were assembled, although 69 3′ contigs did not have any 5′-end sequences. Singlets were also checked for the availability of 5′-end sequences. A total of 4596 contigs and 1459 singlets were available for 5′-end sequences. These 6055 cDNA clones were served as a basis for complete sequencing of inserts, 5006 of which were successfully sequenced. These cDNA sequences provide for an estimated 15% of the genes of barley. This estimate is based on the number of non-redundant barley transcripts (32 690) by CAP3 assembly,27 using 3′-end sequences of FLcDNA libraries (Sato, unpublished data).After trimming the vector sequences, insert sizes of 5006 clones ranged from 167 to 6780 bp, with an average size of 1474 bp (Fig. 1), which is reasonably large compared with rice (30–16 311 bp; average=1107 bp) (rep_orf_nuc.fa: N = 30 192, http://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/). This indicates that the most of the cDNA clones were sufficiently large to include open reading frame (ORF) sequences.Distribution of insert sizes of 5006 FL barley clones. Average insert size is 1474 bp, with the range of 167–6780 bp.Distribution of insert sizes of 5006 FL barley clones. Average insert size is 1474 bp, with the range of 167–6780 bp.3.2 Comparison with rice and Arabidopsis geneThe homologies of the FLcDNA sequences with rice (rap2_rep_nuc: N = 31 439) and Arabidopsis (TAIR7_seq_20070320: N = 37 022) were determined by blastn28 (Fig. 2). The threshold of E <1E-5 revealed 4451 and 1798 FLcDNAs with homology to rice and Arabidopsis, respectively. With the threshold of E <1E-30, 3909 FLcDNAs showed homology to rice. The numbers of FLcDNAs showing homology to both species, only rice and only Arabidopsis were 1788 (36%), 2663 (53%) and 10 (0.002%), respectively. Other 555 (11%) FLcDNAs did not show homology to either rice or Arabidopsis.Blastn search among barley FLcDNAs, rice genes and Arabidopsis genes (E<1E-5).Blastn search among barley FLcDNAs, rice genes and Arabidopsis genes (E<1E-5).Subsequently, homologies (E <1E-5) to rice representative of ORF amino acid sequences (1397) (rap2_rep_orf_aa: N = 30 192) and Arabidopsis CDS (2172) (TAIR7_pep_20070425: N = 31 924) were also analyzed by blastx.29 The threshold of E <1E-30 revealed 3853 and 3679 FLcDNAs with homology to rice and Arabidopsis, respectively.All the homologous barley FLcDNAs were mapped to the rice pseudomolecule (IRGSP built 3) to show the homology to rice locus, mRNAs and CDS. The Gbrowse data set is accessible online from http://map.lab.nig.ac.jp:8090/cgi-bin/gbrowse/Oryza_vs_Hordeum/.3.3 Estimation of ORF completeness in barley FLcDNAsThe completeness of ORFs in each FLcDNA sequence was estimated by the blastx analysis, using rice ORF and UniProt (http://beta.uniprot.org/) sequences. The results are available at Supplementary Table S1. An ORF was judged as FL when an FLcDNA satisfies the following criterion: (i) strand =1, (ii) subject start position <20 bp and (iii) subject start position ≤ FLcDNA start position. Based on this criterion, 2912 and 304 FLcDNAs were estimated to have complete ORFs compared with rice ORF and UniProt sequences, respectively. Thus, at least 60% of the FLcDNAs probably have complete ORFs.Since only 3853 of the FLcDNAs have high (E <1E-30) homology with rice ORF amino acid sequences, many of the FLcDNAs were lacking the homologous rice genes to compare with. Therefore, the estimate of 60% may underestimate the ORF completeness of the FLcDNAs. A preliminary estimate based on random 5′ sequencing of 96 clones picked from the cDNA library suggested 92% of completeness based on homology search with the GenBank nt database (data not shown). The precise estimate of ORF completeness will have to wait until barley genome sequence is available.3.4 GO annotation and orthologous gene comparison for FLcDNA sequenceInterProScan analysis of the 5006 FLcDNA clones produced results for 4980 clones (Supplementary Table S2). Of the 4980 clones, 3156 had GO results. GO-positive sequences were categorized using their GO terms and categories with the namespace of molecular function (Table 2). ‘Binding’ (32.6%) and ‘catalytic activity’ (31.6%) were the most frequent functions of the FLcDNAs. For all other functions, the percentage of FLcDNAs was less than 5%. The 555 FLcDNA clones that showed no significant homology to either rice or Arabidopsis genes were separately categorized by GO annotation: 70% had no GO. For positives, the category spectrum was similar to that for the total set of clones.GO category (molecular function) comparison between the barley FLcDNAs (Table 2) and rice rap2 (http://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/RAP2_statistics.html) showed similar spectra. However, the frequencies of GO molecular functions (GO slim) in Arabidopsis (http://www.arabidopsis.org/tools/bulk/go/index.jsp) were different from those in barley and rice. Considering the genomic similarity between barley and rice, it may be reasonable to say that the barley FLcDNAs comprised clones, reflecting the spectrum of functions of all genes in grass species.Orthologous relationships between barley FLcDNAs and rice/Arabidopsis proteins were compared using the GreenPhyl Iterative Ortholog Search Tool (i-GOST) with GreenPhylDB30 (http://greenphyl.cirad.fr), which contains 6421 mutigenic families half automatically clustered including 492 TAIR (http://sss.arabidopsis.org/), 1903 InterPro (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/) and 981 KEGG (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/) families. Of the 5028 possible amino acid sequences derived from the 5006 FLcDNAs, 4032 (80.2%) were classified into 1678 GreenPhyl families (Supplementary Table S3). A total of 997 protein families were identified at GreenPhylDB clustering level 1 (Inflation 1.2).31 Other protein families were identified at under clustering level 2–4 (Inflation 2–5). Category levels were due to clustering stringency (http://greenphyl.cines.fr/html/cluster.htm). The abundant families are listed in Table 3. The most abundant were kinase and/or LRR superfamilies, with 84 amino acid sequences from FLcDNA.Abundant orthologous families of barley FLcDNA analyzed by GreenPhyl Ortholog Search Tool with GreenPhylDB (http://greenphyl.cirad.fr), which contain all rice and Arabidopsis gene familiesAbundant orthologous families of barley FLcDNA analyzed by GreenPhyl Ortholog Search Tool with GreenPhylDB (http://greenphyl.cirad.fr), which contain all rice and Arabidopsis gene families3.5 Comparison with published barley EST sequencesThe 5006 FLcDNAs were searched using blastn, against all the barley EST sequences in GenBank. Of these, 4753 (95%) showed high homology (E <1E-30) and 253 showed homology below the threshold. The blastn homology with rice genes showed that 152 of these 253 FLcDNAs showed homologies (E <1E-5) to rice gene sequences, indicating that these genes may be expressed at low levels and their detection is due to our systematic program of mRNA sampling. The other 101 FLcDNAs did not show homologies to any rice genes (all are included in the 555 genes noted in Table 2), Arabidopsis genes or barley ESTs. The blastn search with IRGSP build 4 rice pseudomolecule (http://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/) revealed that only three of these cDNA sequences showed homologies to rice genome. These results indicate that most of these genes may be novel transcripts specific to barley.3.6 cDNA sequences as tools for gene isolation and genome analysis in the TriticeaeThere were high levels of homology with other Triticeae EST-based resources. At E <1E-30, the numbers of significant hits and percentages were as follows: Affymetrix Barley 1 GeneChip (4060; 81%), wheat gene index (4199; 84%) and EST sequences on the genetic map of Sato et al. (submitted for publication) (1328; 27%), which comprised 2890 non-redundant sets of 3′ barley ESTs. The blastn scores and target sequence information are available in Supplementary Table S4. Genetic map positions of FLcDNAs are available in Supplementary Table S5 and cMAP viewer online at http://map.lab.nig.ac.jp:8085/cmap/. The 1328 mapped cDNA sequences are well-distributed on each chromosome (160, 233, 211, 151, 214, 168 and 191 cDNAs on chromosomes 1H to 7H, respectively). Mapped FLcDNAs will be useful for cloning genes, especially when the mapped loci are also represented on an expression profiling array such as the Affymetrix Barley 1 GeneChip. As shown in Supplementary Table S4, 4060 (81%) cDNA sequences are formatted on Barley 1 GeneChip and 1300 of them are assigned genetic map positions. As an example, expressed probes on the Barley 1 GeneChip with genetic map positions in barley were used to identify orthologous transporter gene in rice.18 This strategy led to identifying the corresponding FLcDNAs in barley and ultimately cloning and characterizing the function of Aluminium tolerance gene in barley.There is general colinearity and content of the barley and wheat genomes.22,23 Therefore, it is not surprising that 84% of the wheat genes showed a high level of sequence similarity with the barley FLcDNAs. The homology between barley and diploid wheat (Triticum monococcum and Triticum boeoticum) is complete, except for the reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 4A and 5A21 (see online at http://map.lab.nig.ac.jp:8085/cmap/). There are some excellent examples of how the complementary use of wheat and barley genetic resources, based on homeology, can be of benefit to gene discovery in both species.25,323.7 ConclusionsThe 5006 barley FLcDNAs are the first published sequences in the Triticeae and third largest resource in plants, after rice and Arabidopsis. The present barley FLcDNA sequences are of as high quality as those reported for rice and Arabidopsis. These sequences provide access to nucleotide and amino acid sequences in barley and other related species, especially wheat.Since a whole genome sequence is not yet available for barley, evaluation of these FLcDNA sequences by alignment with genome sequence is not possible, as for Arabidopsis11 and rice.12 However, the FLcDNAs will be immediately useful after the release of the genome sequence of barley. The efficiency was demonstrated by Sato (unpublished data), who sequenced 400 Haruna Nijo BAC clones mapped on the barley chromosome 3H. The FLcDNAs in this study can be aligned on these BAC sequences for gene identification.The mapped ESTs can be assigned physical coordinates using cytogenetic stocks, such as barley–wheat addition lines. For example, barley EST markers on the barley chromosome deletion stocks can estimate the physical location of these ESTs.3,4 Moreover, cDNAs with large insert sizes can be directly mapped to the chromosomes by fluorescent in situ hybridization. Thus, the combination of multiple genomic resources, including EST maps and FLcDNAs, will assist in finally revealing the complete structure and function of the barley genome.Sequence data from this article have been deposited with the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank Data Libraries under accession nos AK248134–AK253139.

IntroductionWhen sequences of hundreds of microbial protein-coding genes became available in 1980, Grantham et al.1,2 analyzed frequencies of 61 codons of all these genes. Consequently, they found that a surprising consistency of choices exists among genes of the same or similar genome. The ‘genome hypothesis’ was hereby proposed.1,2 Soon after that, it was shown that evident intra-genomic variability existed in many microorganisms.3 This variation was interpreted as the effect of nature selection acting at the level of translation, which resulted in the preferential usage of optimal codons.4 The interpretation was reinforced by the finding that the preferred codons in highly expressed genes were recognized by the most abundant tRNA in Escherichia coli5 and as well as in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.6 The selective advantage of optimal codons seems to lie in maximizing the efficiency of translation, particularly during periods of competitive exponential growth.7 In bacteria with slow growth rate, selected codon usage bias may be relatively weak.7 There may be no such bias in those bacteria for which the competitive growth is unimportant.8 On the other hand, the preferred codons vary among species based on the changes in the complement of tRNAs in that bacterium.9Besides translational selection, replicational and transcriptional selection may also have influence on the codon usage of a gene.10,11 Replicational selection is responsible for the higher number of genes on the leading strands, and transcriptional selection appears to be responsible for the enrichment of highly expressed genes on these strands.The effects of mutation may be superimposed on biases generated by natural selection.12 In most bacteria, there are short chromosome segments of unusual base composition due to the relatively recent import of the region through horizontal transfer.13,14 Genes located in these regions possess distinct codon usage or nucleotide composition from other genes, for example, in E. coli15 and in Bacillus subtilis.16 In a single known example, Mycoplasma genitalium, codon usage variation is continuous and associated very strongly with position on the chromosome, perhaps reflecting change in the spectrum of mutations around the genome.17 In addition, many bacteria exhibit skewed base composition between the leading and lagging strands of replication, although the magnitude of this skew varies considerably among species.18Based on the above narration, the variation of codon usage of genes within a species is due to the combined effect of mutation and selection.12 Among these factors, the bias from asymmetric replication mechanism received special attention of researchers in the past 10 years.19 Many researches have been performed to analyze the effect on the codon usage (and/or amino acid composition) exerted by the asymmetric mutation and to investigate the underlying mechanism of the different mutation.20–27 The skewed base composition between two replicating strand was first observed in E. coli, M. genitalium, Haemophilus influenzae and B. subtilis.28,29 Then similar observations were obtained in most of the other bacteria. In 1998, for the first time it was found that the asymmetric replication is the major source of codon usage variation.10 This observation was obtained in Borrelia burgdorferi genome.10 The effect of asymmetry was so strong that the codon usages of genes on the two replicating strands were separated, distinct. After that, the separated codon usages between two replicating strands were also observed in Treponema pallidum,30Chlamydia trachomatis,11Buchnera aphidicola,31Blochmannia floridanus,32Bartonella henselae,33Bartonella quintana,33Tropheryma whipplei34 and Chlamydia muridarum.35Lawsonia intracellularis is an obligate intracellular Gram-negative bacterial pathogen.36 Though primarily recognized in pigs, L. intracellularis is spreading to a wide range of mammals such as horses, and hamsters in North America and elsewhere. The bacterial pathogen invades the intestinal epithelial cells, which causes hyperplasia of the infected cells and leads to the process of disease pathogenesis. The disease has two clinical manifestations: an acute hemorrhagic form often referred as porcine hemorrhagic enteropathy, and a more chronic proliferative form often called porcine intestinal adenomatosis. Genome of L. intracellularis PHE/MN1-00 was determined in 2006, which provided a wonderful opportunity to extract a wealth of information on biochemistry, genetics, evolutionary history and pathogenicity of this organism.Traditionally, codon usage data have been used in a wide variety of areas.10 It is often desirable to use codon usage information to reduce the redundancy of primers for the PCR. Optimizing the codon usage of a gene could increase its expression level. Codon usage tables have been used to identify those ORFs that may encode proteins. Codon usage patterns also have been used to identify ORFs that probably do not code for functional proteins. Because of the importance of the intracellular pathogen and the potential usage of codon usage patterns, the intra-genomic variation in codon usage in L. intracellularis PHE/MN1-00 has been investigated through multivariate analysis method in this study.2. Materials and methods2.1. The databaseThe complete genome sequence of L. intracellularis PHE/MN1-00 was downloaded from GenBank ftp site. One chromosome and three plasmids are contained in the complete genome. In this work, Plasmid 1 and Plasmid 2 are not taken into account because they contain too little genes to be analyzed statistically. Plasmid 3 is the largest plasmid and also analyzed. Chromosome has 1 457 619 bp and Plasmid 3 has 194 553 bp. A total of 1180 and 104 protein-coding genes are listed in the annotations of the chromosome and the largest plasmid, respectively. No attempt was made to alter the sequences or to remove those genes of unknown function. The FASTA formatted files, which are used as input files for codonW software, are proved as Supplementary data. In Supplementary File 1, the DNA sequences of 1180 genes located on the chromosome of L. intracellularis are contained. The first 607 genes correspond to those located on the leading strands and the last 573 ones correspond to those on the lagging strands. In Supplementary File 2, the DNA sequences of 104 genes in the largest plasmid (Plasmid 3) of L. intracellularis are contained. The first 68 genes correspond to those located on the leading strands and the last 36 ones correspond to those on the lagging strands.2.2. Statistical analysisMost analyses were carried out by using codonW,37 which can be freely downloaded from the website (http://sourceforge.net/projects/codonw/). GC3S denotes the frequencies of G and C at the third synonymously variable coding position (excluding Met, Trp and termination codons). NC means the ‘effective number of codons’ used in a gene.38 When all sense codons are used randomly, NC takes a value of 61. Lower values of NC indicate stronger bias, with an extreme value of 20 when only one synonymous codon is used for each amino acid. After calculating NC and GC3S for each gene, NC–GC3S plot can be made, which shows whether there are genes whose codon usage is affected by genome composition pressure and natural selection or mutation. An expected curve is plotted through the formula: N = 2 + s + {29/[s2 + (1 − s)2]}. For each gene, codon adaptive index (CAI) and hydropathy values (gravy) are also calculated by codonW.Correspondence analysis (COA), as implemented in codonW, was used to determine the major source of variation of codon usage among the genes on the chromosome and the genes in Plasmid 3. As suggested by Perrière and Thioulouse,39 parallel COA on codon counts and on relative codon frequencies were performed and then the results were compared. In addition, COA was carried out for genes on the chromosome, for genes in the largest plasmid and for the genes located on the leading strands of the chromosome, respectively. Relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) is defined as the observed frequency of a codon divided by that expected when all codons for that amino acid are used equally. Therefore, RSCU values close to 1.0 indicate a lack of bias for that codon. Compared with simple measurements of codon abundance, RSCU values are normalized and are much more independent of amino acid usage. Only those codons for which there is a synonymous alternative were used in the analysis. Hence, the three termination codons and the codons that encode methionine and tryptophan are excluded. Consequently, each gene is described by a vector of 59 variables (codons). COA maps all the genes analyzed into the 59-dimensional space and attempts to identify a series of new orthogonal axes accounting for the greatest variation among genes. The first principal axis is chosen to maximize the standard deviation of the derived variable and the second principal axis is the direction to maximize the standard deviation among directions un-correlated with the first, and so forth. For details about this method, refer to Dillon and Goldstein.40GC skew [(G − C)/(G + C)] was used to determine the origin and termination of replication for the chromosome and the plasmid.28 A non-overlapping sliding window of 1000 bp was employed for the GC skew. For the chromosome, the origin site is assumed to lie between genes LI0775 and LI0776, whereas the termination between genes LI0227 and LI0228. For the largest plasmid, the origin lies before gene LIC020, whereas the terminus between genes LIC062 and LIC063.In order to check whether there have significant differences of codon usage between genes on the leading strands and those on the lagging strands, a χ2 test was employed. Significance was examined at the 5% level (χ2 value of 3.841). Significance was evaluated for the 59 sense codons for which there are a synonymous alternative.3. Results3.1. Global codon usage of genes on the chromosomeIt is widely accepted that global codon usage in unicellular species that displays extremely biased genomic composition is predominantly shaped by the compositional pressure.41 This viewpoint is confirmed again in L. intracellularis genome. As can be seen from Table 1, the global codon usage in 1180 genes on the chromosome in L. intracellularis shows the expected bias toward AT-rich codons. This enrichment is much stronger at the third codon position than at the first two positions. For all of the 18 amino acids (excepting Met and Trp), the frequencies of A- or T-ending codons are much more than those of G- or C-ending synonyms.Global codon usage of 1180 genes on the chromosome of L. intracellularisGlobal codon usage of 1180 genes on the chromosome of L. intracellularisAs suggested by Wright,38 a plot of NC against GC3S can gives a useful visual display of the main features of codon usage patterns for a number of genes. If a gene is only subject to G + C-biased mutational pressure, it will lie on the GC3S curve. It will lie just below the GC3S curve if a gene is under selection (either negative or positive) for codons in C and/or G. In other words, the gene will lie over the GC3S curve if it is subject to other kinds of selection and/or any kinds of mutation pressure. Such a plot for genes on the chromosome is shown in Fig. 1. According to the figure, there exists significant heterogeneity of codon usage among genes on the chromosome: GC3S values range from 0.07 to 0.61, whereas NC values range from 31.1 to 60.0. It can also be seen that one-third of genes lie above the GC3S curve, and the retaining two-thirds lie below the GC3S curve. For genes that lie above the GC3S curve, there may exist mutational or selectional pressure that leads to A- and/or T-ending codons. On inspection, almost all of these genes are located on the lagging strands and most of these genes are those likely to be lowly expressed. It should also be noted that dozens of genes are located far from the majority. These genes have high GC3S values and high NC values, which are marked by open triangles in the plot. Origin of these genes will be discussed in the later section.The effective number of codons (NC) plotted against the G + C content at the synonymously variable third position (GC3S), for the 1180 genes on the chromosome. Open triangles indicate genes with unusual G + C content, speculated as foreign genes. Open squares denote the other genes.The effective number of codons (NC) plotted against the G + C content at the synonymously variable third position (GC3S), for the 1180 genes on the chromosome. Open triangles indicate genes with unusual G + C content, speculated as foreign genes. Open squares denote the other genes.3.2. Strand-specific composition bias at three codon positions of genes on the chromosomeGC-skew analysis shows a clear polarity switch at two points, around 284 and 975 kb on the chromosome in L. intracellularis, suggesting that the putative replication terminus and origin sites might be located in these regions. According to the record for this bacterium in the Doric database,42 GC disparity that is a component of Z curve also shows a clear minimum and maximum at these points for this genome. Comparisons with the consensus sequence for the non-perfect DnaA box motif (ttttcaaca) reveal that a non-translatable region between 983 356 and 984 329 bp possesses cluster of three putative DnaA boxes, thereby confirming the possible locations of the functional chromosomal origins between two genes, LI0775 (trkH) and LI0776 (psd). The existence of a DnaA gene around 980 kb furthermore confirms this location as replication origin.Table 2 shows the frequencies of nucleotide A, C, G, T and the mean G + T contents at three codon positions of the genes located on the leading and lagging strands of the L. intracellularis chromosome. Strand-specific skews, known to influence codon usage in other bacteria,18 are also found to have the same influences on L. intracellularis. The leading strand genes show an excess of G over C and T over A, whereas the case for the lagging strands is opposite. The t-test shows that the mean G + T content of each codon position of the genes located on the leading strands is significantly different from that on the lagging strands of replication. This indicates that the strand-specific compositional bias has significant influence on nucleotide selection not only at the third codon position but also at the first and second positions. The inter-strand variation in G + T content is highest in the third and lowest in the second codon position, whereas the intra-strand variation is highest in the second codon position, which is reflected by the highest standard deviations.Base compositions and medium G + T content at three codon positions for genes located on the leading and lagging strands of the chromosomeBase compositions and medium G + T content at three codon positions for genes located on the leading and lagging strands of the chromosome3.3. The first trend is associated with strand-specific mutational biasesCOA of codon usage was used to study extensively and quantitatively the variation of codon usage among the 1180 genes on the chromosome. Because the use of relative codon frequency sometimes introduces other biases and often diminishes the quantity of information to analyze, occasionally resulting in interpretation errors, we compute in parallel COA on codon counts and on RSCU and then compare the results in this study. Fig. 2(a) and (b) shows the positions of the genes along the first and second major axes produced by COA on codon counts and RSCU values, respectively. The closeness of any two genes on each plot reflects the similarities of their codon usages. In the following sections, the factors that drive variation of synonymous codon usage of genes on the chromosome are discussed.Plot of the two most important axes after COA for the 1180 genes on the chromosome. The open circles indicate the genes that are transcribed on the leading strands of replication. The filled circles indicate the genes that are transcribed on the lagging strands of the replication. (a) Use codon count to compute COA (COA/counts), the first and second axes account for 10.5% and 7.5% of the total inertia of the 59-dimensional space. (b) Use RSCU to compute COA (COA/RSCU), the first and second axes account for 9.2% and 7.7% of the total inertia of the 59-dimensional space.Plot of the two most important axes after COA for the 1180 genes on the chromosome.

The following two results could indicate that the two clusters correspond to genes on the leading and lagging strands of replication. (i) The first axis is found to strongly correlate with GC and AT skews, particularly at the third position. At the left of the first axis, genes are characterized by richness in nucleotides G and T, whereas it is opposite at the right. On the other hand, it has been found that there is an excess of nucleotides G relative to C in the leading strands and of C to G in the lagging strands in most bacterial genomes, which is frequently accompanied by an abundance of T over A in the leading strand.18 (ii) The coordinates of individual genes along the first axis are plotted against the chromosomal locations of the corresponding genes in Fig. 3. Genes on the Watson strand and those on the Crick strand are denoted by black and gray squares, respectively. It is found that genes on the left side of Watson strand and those on the right side of Crick strand have low values of coordinates along the Axis 1, whereas, for the other genes, the case is opposite. In fact, genes on the left side of Watson strand and those on the right side of Crick strand just correspond to genes on the leading strands, the other ones correspond to lagging strands. Therefore, it is reasonable to say that two clusters in Fig. 2 correspond to genes on the leading strands and lagging strands, respectively. After marking genes located on the leading and lagging strands by different symbols in Fig. 2, the speculation is confirmed.Plot of Axis 1 values of chromosomal genes against their corresponding chromosomal locations in the L. intracellularis genome. Black squares represent genes located on the Watson strand and gray squares represent genes on the Crick strand.

Black squares represent genes located on the Watson strand and gray squares represent genes on the Crick strand. To allow convenient observation, the beginning point of the horizontal axis is shifted to the origin of replication.A χ2 test was performed for RSCU of genes located on the leading versus lagging strands and the results are listed in Table 3. As can be seen, 49 among 59 codons are found to be significantly different between genes on the two strands of replication. The 23 codons used more frequently in the leading strands are G-ending or T-ending, except TTA, ACA, AGA and GCA. Among the 26 codons used more frequently in the lagging strands, 16 are C-ending, eight are A-ending and the exceptions are CTT and ACT. Results of the test confirm that there is a bias toward G, T in the leading strands and toward C, A in the lagging strands of replication. Therefore, it can be concluded that in L. intracellularis, the leading and lagging strands of replication display an asymmetry in the mutational biases and or the differential correction/repair rates, and as shown in several other bacteria,10,11,30–35 this difference is the most important source of codon usage variation.Results of χ2 test for RSCU of genes on the leading and lagging strands of the chromosomea≫ indicates that the leading strand genes use the codon more frequently than the lagging strand genes; ≪ indicates the lagging strand genes use the codon more frequently than the leading strand genes; – indicates that there is no significant difference in the usage of the codon on either strand. Significance is examined at the level of 5%.Results of χ2 test for RSCU of genes on the leading and lagging strands of the chromosomea≫ indicates that the leading strand genes use the codon more frequently than the lagging strand genes; ≪ indicates the lagging strand genes use the codon more frequently than the leading strand genes; – indicates that there is no significant difference in the usage of the codon on either strand. Significance is examined at the level of 5%.Furthermore, there are more annotated genes on the leading strands than on the lagging strands. The numbers are 607 and 573, respectively. However, the two numbers in L. intracellularis are less different than that in B. burgdorferi.10 Therefore, the effect of replication selection is weaker than that in B. burgdorferi. Three sets of genes, including ribosomal proteins, translation/transcription processing factors and the major chaperones and degradation genes,43 are chosen as representative of highly expressed genes. For these putative highly expressed genes, the distribution on the two replicating strands is much more skewed. More than 59% of the 61 putative highly expressed genes are transcribed on the leading strands. So, the differences between the leading and lagging strands indicate the combined effects of mutation and selection induced by the replication–transcription. Replicational selection, although weak, may be responsible for the higher number of genes located on the leading strands,10,11 and transcriptional selection appears to be responsible for the enrichment of highly expressed genes on these strands.10,11 Replicational–transcriptional selection coupled with asymmetric mutational bias is, therefore, the most important cause of intra-chromosome variations of synonymous codon usages in L. intracellularis.As mentioned above, the separated codon usages between the two replicating strands have been found in nine bacteria. Among these species, B. burgdorferi shows an extremely strong bias of codon usage.10 Lobry and Sueoka22 once described a method of graphical display of the influence of replication bias on leading versus lagging strands. It would be interesting to compare the graphics, namely PR2-plots, obtained for L. intracellularis chromosome with those of B. burgdorferi. As can be seen from Fig. 4(a) and (b), the strand biases of G/C, which could be reflected by the values of the horizontal axis of the plot, are slightly weaker in L. intracellularis than those in B. burgdorferi, whereas the strand biases of T/A (reflected by the values of the vertical axis) are much weaker in the former than those in the latter. In both figures, the strand-specific biases are strong enough to separate the genes on the two replicating strands.PR2-plots for L. intracellularis chromosome and B. burgdorferi genome. G/(G + C) and A/(A + T) at the third codon positions of protein-coding genes are calculated and plotted as the horizontal and vertical axes, respectively. For details of the PR2-plot, please refer to Lobry and Sueoka.22PR2-plots for L. intracellularis chromosome and B. burgdorferi genome. G/(G + C) and A/(A + T) at the third codon positions of protein-coding genes are calculated and plotted as the horizontal and vertical axes, respectively. For details of the PR2-plot, please refer to Lobry and Sueoka.223.4. The second trend may be associated with horizontal gene transferWhen analyzing the second trend, it is found that there exists a strong negative correlation between the Axis 2 (COA/RSCU) and GC3S (r = −0.6559). If analysis is restricted to the 87 genes whose coordinates along Axis 2 are less than –0.2, the correlation is more significant. Marking these genes by open triangles in the NC–GC3S plot, it is found that these genes are located far from the other ones and have higher NC and GC3S. And this fact means the different codon usage of these genes with that of the majority. As well known, genes that were recently imported through horizontal transfer would have unusual codon usages and base compositions. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, putative alien genes showed higher NC values than the majority of genes.12 From the widely used public database HGT-DB,14 we downloaded the information for all the predicted horizontally transferred genes in L. intracellularis. Among the 10 genes that have the lowest values of Axis 2, nine are predicted as horizontally transferred genes according to the results in HGT-DB.14 The exceptional gene is as short as 104 codons. Based on the above analysis, it is reasonable to come to the conclusion that most of the 87 genes may be transferred horizontally. It should be noted that 20 of these genes are located around the replication terminus, which has been shown to be a hot spot of mutation and chromosome recombination.3.5. Hydropathy of encoded proteins influences the codon usage variationFig. 5 shows the positions of the 1180 genes along the third and forth major axes produced by COA on codon counts. As can be seen from the figure, the third axis separates another group of genes from the main group. After computing the gravy score (a measure of hydrophobicity) of all the proteins encoded by the genes, it is found that the proteins separated from the others on the third axis have very high scores (gravy > 0.3) and so are hydrophobic. These results are nothing but the superimposition of amino acid bias on codon usage bias. If we use RSCU to compute the COA, the third major axis could not discriminate the genes according to the hydrophobicity values. It should be noted that this is the same case as that in the genome of Lactococcus lactis.44Plot of the third and fourth axes after COA of codon counts for the 1180 genes on the chromosome. Proteins having a gravy score >0.3 are represented as filled circles and the other genes are represented as open circles.Plot of the third and fourth axes after COA of codon counts for the 1180 genes on the chromosome. Proteins having a gravy score >0.3 are represented as filled circles and the other genes are represented as open circles.3.6. Influence of the expression level on the codon usageIn order to investigate whether codon usage patterns are further shaped by factors at the level of translation, we conduct COA of codon counts and RSCU values on the genes located on the leading strands of replication, because most of the 61 putative expressed genes are located in that strand. Fig. 6(a) and (b) shows the positions of the genes along the first and second major axes produced by such COA on codon counts and RSCU, respectively. As can be seen from the two figures, almost all of the putative highly expressed genes have positive scores along the second axis, whereas genes presumably expressed at low level are scattered everywhere of the whole distribution area. In addition, we calculate the CAI value for each gene located on the lagging strands. The correlation between the values of Axis 2 and CAI is statistically significant (r = 0.494, P < 0.0001). The above analyses suggest that the second axis is associated with expression level.Plot of the two most important axes after COA for 607 chromosome genes that are located on the leading strands of replication. The filled circles indicate 36 putative highly expressed genes. The open circles denote other genes.

COA of RSCU of genes in the largest plasmidCOA of RSCU of genes in the largest plasmid in L. intracellularis was performed to determine the most important factor that drives synonymous codon usage patterns. The other two plasmids are not analyzed because there are too little genes to perform multivariate statistical analysis. One plot of the two most important axes after the COA is shown in Fig. 7. The first and second axes account for 12.7% and 8.2% of the total inertia of the 59-dimensional space, respectively. After determining replication origin and terminus sites by GC-skew analysis shown in Fig. 8, 68 genes are found to lie on the leading strands and 36 ones on the lagging strands. There is more significant difference between the numbers of genes on the two replicating strands in the plasmid than those on the chromosome, suggesting that replicational selection in the former is stronger than that in the latter. Marking the two groups of genes by open and filled circles, and then it is found that genes on the leading strands lie on the right side of the Axis 1, whereas lagging strand genes lie on the left side. χ2 test was performed for RSCU of genes located on the leading versus lagging strands in this plasmid. Consequently, 23 among 59 codons are found to be significantly different between genes on the two strands of replication. Among the 13 codons used more frequently in the leading strands, nine are G-ending or T-ending, except TTA, ATA, CCA and GCA. Among the 10 codons used more frequently in the lagging strands, eight are C-ending or A-ending and the exceptions are CTT and TCT. Therefore, the strand-specific mutational biases are responsible for the major variation of synonymous codon usages of genes in the plasmid. No known factors are found to correlate with the second axis of this COA.Plot of the two most important axes after COA of RSCU values for the 104 genes in the largest plasmid.

It is calculated using a non-overlapping sliding window of 1000 bp. As can be seen, there are two clear polarity switches, suggested as putative origin and terminus of replication.To test whether the transcriptional selection exerts influence on the genes, CAI values are calculated for 104 genes in the plasmid by using ribosomal protein-coding genes as reference set. Consequently, it is found that all of the seven genes that have the highest CAI values are located on the leading strands. This suggests that transcriptional selection do have influence on the genes of the plasmid. Replicational selection and transcriptional selection are two different kinds of selective pressures. Although the two selective pressures yield similar consequences, they are very distinct.10 The asymmetric mechanism of replication in the plasmid may also be shown by the following result. CMR database at TIGR lists the function categories of known genes in this plasmid. After comparing the numbers of the known genes on the two replicating strands, it is found that 15 of the 22 cell envelope-related genes are located on the lagging strands. On the other hand, 10 of the 11 genes with mobile and extra-chromosomal element functions are located on the leading strands.4. Discussion4.1. Underlying mechanisms of replicational–transcriptional mutation and selectionIt is widely accepted that codon usage variation in a species is the combined effect of mutation bias and nature selection.12 In L. intracellularis chromosome, genes located on the two replicating strands are shown to have distinct codon usages. On the other hand, genes, particularly those are highly expressed, are mainly located on the leading strands. It is important to investigate the underlying mechanisms of the two effects. According to McInerney10 and Romero et al.,11 the former is caused by the strand mutational bias and the latter results from replication–transcription selection. Also, some researchers believe that the strand-specific compositional biases are not only the result of strand mutation biases but also the superimposition of differential mutation rate and differential correction/repair rates.45Among the theories aimed at explaining strand mutation biases, it seems that the cytosine deamination theory enjoys the most attention.19 The deamination of cytosine results in the formation of uracil. In normal circumstance in vivo, cytosine is effectively protected against deamination because of the Watson–Crick base paring. But the rate of cytosine deamination increases 140 times when the DNA is single-stranded.46 If the resulting uracil is not replaced with cytosine, C to T mutation occurs. During the replicating process, the leading strand is much more exposed in the single-stranded state. Therefore, the C to T mutation occurs more frequently in the leading strands than in the lagging strands and then the excesses of G relative to C and T relative to A are formed in the leading strands. According to Furusawa and Doi,47 such fidelity difference between the leading and lagging strands may make it possible to accelerate the evolution of unicellular and multicellular organisms and avoid the extinction of the population.As far as gene orientation biases are concerned, there exist similar explanations. For genes on the leading strands, RNA polymerase, when transcribing them, moves in the same direction as a replication fork would move during replication, whereas opposite for genes on the lagging strands. Transcription–replication should be more effective if one organism maintains most of its genes, particularly highly expressed genes on the leading strands. The high efficiency results from the three factors: (i) the same direction reduces the probability of head-on collisions between the polymerases involved in the replicational and transcriptional processes; (ii) transcription may not be aborted by the replication complex; and (iii) the inverse orientation is very disadvantageous because of the possible lack of solution mechanism for head-on collisions.48 In highly expressed genes, the selective advantage of transposition to the leading strands is more significant than that of lowly expressed genes. Therefore, highly expressed genes are much more likely to overcome random genetic drift, and these genotypes become fixed more easily in the population. Lowly expressed genes do not interfere with replication to such an extent as highly expressed genes, and, also, the interruption of lowly expressed gene transcription is not nearly as deleterious. So, the selective advantage is not so great in lowly expressed genes. Transposition of a lowly expressed gene from a lagging strand to a leading strand may not offer a sufficient selective advantage and therefore may not become fixed so easily in the population.104.2. Codon usages of genes in the plasmid and asymmetric mechanism of replicationUsually, bacterial plasmids replicate using a different mechanism than that of the chromosome of their host cell. As an exception, cumulative skew diagrams showed that plasmid and chromosome of B. burgdorferi adopted a similar bi-directional replication.49 Such common replication mechanism was consistent with previous suggestions that Borrelia plasmids were actually mini-chromosomes.50 In this work, GC-skew analysis in Fig. 8 shows clear polarity switch at two points, around 27 and 115 kb in the largest plasmid of L. intracellularis. This suggests that this plasmid replicates bi-directionally from an internal origin as the chromosome does. Leading strands and lagging strands are hence determined based on the putative origin and terminus. COA shows that genes on the leading and lagging strands have distinct codon usages. The same results are observed in genes on the chromosome, which is supposed to be caused by the strand-specific mutational bias. Similarly, the difference between codon usages of genes on the two replicating strands in the plasmid is very likely to result from the different mutation and/or repair rates. If this speculation is the real case, then common asymmetric replication would be involved in the chromosome and the largest plasmid of L. intracellularis. Not only both replicate bi-directionally from internal origin, but also have biased mutation/repair rate between the two replicating strands.Replicational–transcriptional selection is also found to exert pressure in the largest plasmid of L. intracellularis. The fact that most (68/104 = 65.4%) genes are located on the leading strands suggests the existence of replicational selection. In addition, all of the seven genes that have the highest CAI values are located on the leading strands. This suggests that transcriptional selection has influence on the genes of the plasmid. All the above facts suggest that this plasmid adopts the similar mechanism of replication as the chromosome in L. intracellularis. Perhaps, the largest plasmid of L. intracellularis is one mini-chromosome, as that in B. burgdorferi.504.3. The ‘GC-richness’ of the putative alien genes in L. intracellularisOver 10 years ago, the tendency of horizontally transferred genes to be A + T-rich had been noted in species having intermediate G + C contents.51 After that, the same phenomenon was observed for Helicobacter pylori and Streptococcus pneumoniae,52 which have low G + C contents. This striking pattern raises questions about the nature and the source of these horizontally transferred genes. Lawrence and Ochman53 hypothesized that the recently transferred genes were adapted to the genomic context of other distant species. The results of Daubin et al.52 suggest that either the donor genomes are always more A + T rich than the acceptor genomes or there is a bias toward the internalization of A + T-rich exogenous DNA in the genome.However, the putative alien genes in L. intracellularis are found to have higher GC than the other genes. And even, some of the putative alien genes are GC-rich. Perhaps, someone will think this is an exception. But we do not think so. In contrast, we suppose that this may be a usual pattern of bacterial genomes with very low GC contents. Genomic GC contents of H. pylori and S. pneumoniae, in which AT-rich alien genes are found, are low but not very low. Their GC contents are still 6% higher than those of L. intracellularis, which is 33%. For bacteria with GC content low as 33%, it is difficult to obtain a donor species that have higher AT contents. Therefore, alien genes will be inclined to GC-richer than the other genes in the acceptor species.4.4. Common genomic characters of bacteria in which strand-specific mutational biases are strongUp to now, the strand-specific mutational bias has been found to be the most important factor that affects codon usage in genomes of 10 bacteria. Names of the 10 bacteria are B. aphidicola, B. burgdorferi, B. floridanus, B. henselae, B. quintana, C. muridarum, C. trachomatis, T. pallidum, T. whipplei and L. intracellularis, which is found in this work. Investigation on the common genomic characters of these bacteria may be useful. Several characters are analyzed in the following sections.First, chromosomes of the 10 bacteria are all shorter than 2000 kb. According to statistics on fully sequenced genomes, bacteria vary from 160 to >10 000 kb in their chromosomal lengths. However, these species are all small bacteria based on their chromosomal length, although some of these bacteria are not endosymbiont. Hence, we hypothesize that the short length of chromosome is a necessary condition to generate strong enough strand-specific mutational bias. Perhaps, in bacteria with larger chromosome, the mutation pressure is hard to prevail translational selection. Alternatively, among genomes that have suffered reductive evolution, the repair mechanism of replication may be inefficient.Secondly, all of the 10 bacteria have medium or low genomic G + C content. Among these species, B. aphidicola has the lowest G + C content as 26%, whereas T. pallidum has the highest ones as 52%. Perhaps, the environment of high G + C contents is adverse to the generation of strong strand mutation biases. Future experimental works are needed to clarify the relationship between replication mechanism and genomic GC content or genome size.Thirdly, the strong mutation bias may be associated with presence or absence of certain genes involved in chromosome replication. As suggested by Klasson and Andersson,25 the strong strand-specific mutational bias in endosymbiont genomes coincides with the absence of genes for replication restart pathways. They performed a comparative analysis of 20 γ-proteobacterial genomes and found that endosymbiont bacteria lacking recA and other genes involved in replication restart processes, such as priA, displayed the strongest strand bias.25 Driven by this viewpoint, we investigate the presence and absence of replication restart-related genes in the 10 genomes, in which the strand mutation biases are strong enough to generate distinct codon usages. The analysis is involved with genes mutH, priA, topA, dnaT, fis and recA, which are all initiation and re-initiation associated genes.25 Consequently, all of these genes are found to be absent in B. floridanus and five absent in B. aphidicola, with mutH as an exception. For the other eight bacteria, priA, topA and recA are present and the other three genes are absent. In a word, dnaT and fis are absent in all of the 10 genomes, whereas both the genes exist in E. coli and other γ-proteobacteria, which have not strong mutation biases. Klasson and Andersson hypothesized that cytosine deaminations accumulate during single-strand exposure at stalled replication forks and the extent of strand bias may depend on the time spent repairing such lesions. Inefficient restart mechanisms result in the long time of the replication forks being arrested and hereby lead to high DNA strand asymmetry.25 As a common character of the genomes mentioned here, we believe that the absence of replication restart involved genes is very likely to appear in the other genomes, found in the future, with strong strand mutational bias.Finally, the strong mutation bias may reflect as the strong cumulative excess of G over C plus T over A along the chromosome. In our previously published work,35 the Z curve was used to compare the chromosome sequences between genomes with or without strand-specific codon usage. The y-component of the Z curve represents the plus of cumulative excess of G over C and T over A. An index is defined as the changing rate of y-component per unit base and denoted by symbol k. In fact, k equals to (G − C + T − A)/(G + C + T + A), where A, C, G and T denote the total number of the corresponding base appearing in the half of chromosome (from replication origin to terminus). After calculating k values for the 10 bacteria mentioned above, it is found that this values for these species are all larger than 0.035 and some even larger than 0.1. However, the value of k for E. coli K-12 is less than 0.02. Therefore, the k value that represents the changing rate of cumulative excess of keto (G + T) over amino (A + C) per unit base could be a good measurement of magnitude of strand composition biases and even strand mutation bias.4.5. ConclusionComplex factors are found to be responsible for variation of codon usage in L. intracellularis chromosome. All of these factors could be interpreted by the paradigm ‘mutational bias-translational selection’. When analyzing genes in the largest plasmid of this bacterium, for the first time it is found that the strand-specific mutational biases are responsible for the primary variation of synonymous codon usages in plasmid. Genes, particularly highly expressed genes of this plasmid, are mainly located on the leading strands and this is supposed to be the effects exerted by replicational–transcriptional selection. These facts suggest that this plasmid may adopt the similar replication mechanism as the chromosome in L. intracellularis. Finally," common genomic characters are found among L. intracellularis and other bacteria in whose genomes the strand-specific mutational biases are the most important source of variation of codon usage.FundingThe present study was supported by Doctoral Fund of Ministry of Education of China (20070614011) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (60801058).Supplementary data""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IntroductionMutations in DNA sequences appear as a result of base substitution or deletions, insertions and DNA sequence inversion.1 At the level of amino acid sequences, substitutions of DNA bases may lead to substitutions of amino acids, i.e. single nucleotide substitution changes one amino acid or none. In this sense, deletions, insertions and inversions of DNA coding regions are more dramatic events for genes because such mutational alteration may lead to a reading frame (RF) shift and to modification of the extensive region of amino acid sequence. Substitution frequencies are well investigated, whereas RF shifts in genes are less studied, which is due to the difficulty in their identification. However, the investigation of the influence of RF shifts in genes on protein structure is of great interest. A single DNA base substitution may result in only one change of amino acid in a protein, whereas an RF shift causes the change of all amino acids coded downstream of the shift point in a gene. If after this the protein does not lose its function, then it is supposed that a frame shift has occurred in a functionally insignificant site or that the RF shift generates functionally similar amino acid sequences. But if after RF shift the protein has changed its function, then it is of great interest to understand how changes in amino acid sequence determine the protein's new function.Answers for these questions can probably be found after a detailed investigation of RF shift statistics. To that end, we need a method for finding RF shifts in existing genes. Currently, general methods for finding RF shifts and inversions comprise the search for similarities between amino acid sequences through the BLAST program or its analogues.2,3 When using such procedures for finding RF shifts, we should in some way mark out the gene region where the RF shift is expected to be found. Then we recode this region of nucleotide sequence into that of the amino acid according to the new RF, thus obtaining the hypothetic amino acid sequence as a result. Thereafter, we run a similarity search for a hypothetic amino acid sequence in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot databank. If statistically significant similarities are found, then we can be sure that the gene contains an RF shift, i.e. we see that sequences related to the hypothetic a amino acid sequence do exist. This method has allowed us to find, so far, several hundred genes in which the RF shift has really taken place.2,3However, this scheme of finding RF shifts and inversions has some limitations. First, we have to choose a gene, using some criterion, where an RF shift is supposed to exist, and after that, find the probable site of RF shift and inversion in it. A full-scale search for RF shifts in all genes would require very powerful computational facilities that are not always available, although modern computer systems have made such search possible.2 Second, even if we solve the first task, then the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot databank will be necessary to contain the amino acid sequence having a statistically significant similarity to the hypothetical amino acid sequence. But it is possible that such a sequence will not be found due to the limitation of the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot databank and because of too great an evolutional dissimilarity accumulated between amino acid sequences. Therefore, the concerned approach can reveal only some RF shifts accumulated to date in existing genes.In order to reveal RF shifts and inversions in genes in a more reliable way, some new approach to seeking RF shifts should be developed instead of searching for similarities between hypothetic and real amino acid sequences. As shown in this work, a search for uniform triplet periodicity (TP) within the nucleotide sequence of gene's coding regions may be used as such an approach. Triplet organization of protein coding DNA sequences is a general feature of all presently known live systems.4–12 The reason for this lies not only in the structure of genetic codes, which is virtually the same either for prokaryotes or for eukaryotes, but also in the saturation of proteins by certain amino acids.13–16 If an RF shift occurs in genes in the presence of TP, then it will be revealed because a shift between TP and RF will also occur (Fig. 1). Since TP in a DNA sequence is unlikely to be changed by a small number of base substitutions,17 then such shift will exist for a long period of time. The presence of such a shift between the TP of a nucleotide sequence and RF may serve as an indication of an RF shift in the concerned gene.Influence of one nucleotide deletion on TP of nucleotide sequence. Numbers above sequence S1 show positions of nucleotides in RF. Twenty-fifth base has been deleted from sequence S1. Consequently, sequence S1 can be presented as two sequences—S2 and S3, i.e. S1 = S2aS3. In S2 and S3 sequences, TP (matrices M2 and M3) will be the same, but in sequence S3, there will be cyclical shifts by one base relative to sequence S2 and to RF in sequence S1. This means that first column of matrix M2 corresponds to third column of matrix M3, second column of matrix M2 corresponds to first column of matrix M3, third column of matrix M2 corresponds to second column of matrix M3. After summing sequences S2 and S3 and formation of sequence S4, TPM (M4 matrix) comes out from addition of first column of matrix M2 to first column of matrix M3 and so on, that leads to merging of non-identical columns and considerably decreases statistical significance of TP in sequence S4. By accounting deletions, we get sequence S4 that has TPM (M4 matrix) in which matrices M2 and M3 are merged in consideration of cyclic permutation. Finding and accounting deletions considerably increases statistical significance of TP in sequence S4.Influence of one nucleotide deletion on TP of nucleotide sequence.

By accounting deletions, we get sequence S4 that has TPM (M4 matrix) in which matrices M2 and M3 are merged in consideration of cyclic permutation. Finding and accounting deletions considerably increases statistical significance of TP in sequence S4.Currently, some methods have been developed that reveal TP by using regularity in symbol preferences over different triplet positions in the DNA sequence. They use Fourier transformation, hidden Markov chains and other statistical methods based on position-dependent preferences for nucleotides in coding sequences as a mathematical apparatus.18–23 The methods are aimed at revealing DNA coding sequences and their separation from non-coding regions. A later, method of information decomposition to find TP 17,24 allows the introduction of the term of a TP class (TPC) as a 3 × 4 matrix. In this matrix, columns represent period positions and rows represent nucleotides.In the current work, two problems were set. First, we wanted to find all genes where RF shifts can be identified by using TP. For each gene from the KEGG-29 databank, analysed25 we extracted a region with TP having maximal statistical significance calculated by information decomposition without allowing any deletions or insertions of nucleotides.17,24 Then we built a corresponding matrix of TP which was linked to the existing RF of the given DNA region. This meant that the first column of the TP matrix (TPM) corresponded to the first base of ORF presented in the DNA region having TP. Then we searched for a statistically significant extension of the TP region in the same gene in the presence of insertions and deletions of nucleotides by using modified profile analysis (Fig. 1). More than 800 genes contained a statistically significant shift between TP and ORF, which points to the presence of mutations in genes originating from the RF shift.Second, we wished to check whether hypothetical amino acid sequences translated by using the RF of TP have homology with sequences from UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot databank (http://www.uniprot.org/). We made such a check for the genes that had mismatches between the gene's RF and TP. We confirmed the existence of such shifts for a part of the genes, since we found similarities between hypothetical amino acid sequences and amino acid sequences from the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot databank.2. Materials and methods2.1. Searching for TP in genes by method of information decompositionWe used gene sequences from KEGG-29 databank as source sequences S. All analysed sequences represent coding region (CDS) of genes without introns. That is why, when L1−1 and L2 are set to a multiple of 3 while defining sequences S and U, then first, second and third columns of matrix M for any values of L1 and L2 will always contain nucleotides corresponding to first, second and third bases of the gene's codon, respectively. In other words, matrix M is linked to RF, which exists in the analysed gene.Conformity of 2I to χ2 distribution with six degrees of freedom and of value Z to standard normal distribution are reached in the case of sufficiently large size of statistical data sample, i.e. sufficiently large length of a sequence S. In order to determine the minimal length of a sequence S that makes possible the usage of function χ2 as approximation for 2I value distribution, we tested conformity of 2I to χ2 distribution for various lengths of sequences S. We produced a set of nucleotide sequences for each length in the range from 30 to 1000 nucleotides by using a random number generator. Each of these sets contained 10 000 sequences. Thereafter, mutual information was calculated for each sequence from each set. For each set the histogram showing distribution of 2I value was also built. We compared this histogram with the theoretical distribution by χ2 criteria. It was found that for sequences of length over 60 bp, 2I distribution conformed to χ2(6) with a probability more than 99%. All sequences with TP, which were found in the current work, were longer than 60 bp. This allows using χ2 distribution for statistical estimations of hitting 2I into interval from some threshold value 2I0 to infinity.For sequence S, we calculated the values of 2I for all possible values of L1 and L2 (L1 < L2 ≤ L) and chose the pair (L1,L2) for which the value of mutual information was maximal. Let us refer to the nucleotide sequence found in such a way as T.If the value of Z was >5.0 for sequence T, then we considered that the region with TP has been found. The value of Z >5.0 ensures the probability of incidental TP revealing in DNA sequence to be <10−6. Thereafter, we saved the found maximal sequence for the given gene, its coordinates in the given gene and periodicity matrix M, which shows the type of TP found. We chose a threshold level Z > 5.0 for finding TP in order to keep the number of incidentally found TPs near 1% of all detected regions with TP found in genes from the 29th release of the KEGG databank. To choose a threshold value for Z, we generated a set of random DNA sequences with the same size and sequence length distribution as for genes from the 29th release of KEGG databank. For Z > 5.0, the number of found random sequences was 7200, which is ∼1.5% of found regions with TP (see below). For Z > 6.0, we found 172 such sequences, and for Z > 7.0, we found no such sequences. We intentionally chose the level of Z > 5.0 in order to find the most complete extension of TP regions (see Section 2.2) that exist in various genes. The point is that gene's TP can be split up by insertions and deletions into several sections that may have rather low level of Z, but which is greater than 5.0. However, matrices M for each such section in gene will be identical or very similar, but cyclically shifted against each other (Fig. 1). In this case, consequent joining of these sections into a single one can considerably increase the statistical significance of a joined region that can be found by making an alignment against matrix M (see Section 2.3). Therefore, using a relatively low threshold value of Z will allow to not miss TP regions in genes separated into several sections by insertions and deletions.2.2. Algorithm of TP region extension in genes from KEGG databankWe applied this algorithm for those DNA sequences in which we have revealed TP without insertions and deletions by the method of information decomposition. Let S = {s(i), i = 1, 2, … , L} be the analysed nucleotide sequence from KEGG databank and t1 and t2 be coordinates of the left and right borders of a region T with continuous TP in sequence S. For region T, we determined TPM and used this matrix to extend the TP region by considering possible nucleotides’ insertions and deletions. Then we carried out local alignment of examined DNA sequence against weight matrix w introduced on the basis of TPM. Let the coordinates of start and end of found local alignment R be r1 and r2. Under extension of TP region T, we mean those R such that r1 < t1 or r2 > t2. Our goal is to choose from the KEGG databank only the genes that contain statistically significant extension of the TP region T. To find statistically significant extensions, we carried out global alignment of sequence S against weight matrix w and determined the values ΔFT = F(t2) − F(t1) and ΔFR = F(r2) − F(r1), where F is the value of similarity function on path of global alignment (Fig. 2). We selected only those genes that had ΔF1 = ΔFR − ΔFT > 0. Thereafter, we have to determine whether the value of ΔF1 is statistically significant. To do this, we used the Monte Carlo method. We generated a set of random nucleotide sequences Q on which the region T was left unchanged and the regions of sequence S within the range from 1 to t1 and from t2 to L were shuffled in a random way. The set Q contained 106 sequences. For each sequence from the set Q, we built global alignment and determined the value ΔFR − ΔFT. Then we calculated such value ΔF0 that the probability of ΔFR − ΔFT ≥ ΔF0 for the set of sequences Q was ∼10−5. We chose the value ΔF0 as a threshold and considered that if ΔF1 > ΔF0, then we found statistically significant extension of the region with continuous TP up to the bounds of region R via considering possible insertions and deletions of nucleotides. We analysed ∼3 × 105 genes in such a way, and detected from 0 to 8 cases of region T extension due to accidental factors with a discovering probability of the given interval equal to 95%. As we revealed more than 750 genes with extension of the TP region T, then the fraction of genes with extension of region T due to merely accidental factors is ∼1.1% which is a relatively small value.Example of alignment against weight matrix obtained from TPM. Here, t1 and t2 are coordinates of region with continuous TP found by information decomposition (T region) and r1 and r2 are coordinates of extended region with TP found by dynamic programming (R region). Points r1 and r2 on optimal alignment path have the coordinates (i0,j0) and (im,jm) in matrix, respectively (see Section 2.3).Example of alignment against weight matrix obtained from TPM. Here, t1 and t2 are coordinates of region with continuous TP found by information decomposition (T region) and r1 and r2 are coordinates of extended region with TP found by dynamic programming (R region). Points r1 and r2 on optimal alignment path have the coordinates (i0,j0) and (im,jm) in matrix, respectively (see Section 2.3).2.3. Implementation of local and global alignment of nucleotide sequence against TPMWe take the sum in Equation (7) for N sequences from QV set. As a result, we have a set of XC where each C from interval [−6,+6] has one XC. We used for further calculation a value of C that has a maximum of XC. We did the selection of C value for each matrix M.Transition to weight matrix ensures assignment of higher weight to infrequent bases when they have high frequency in the given position of profile and, vice versa, assignment of lower weight for such bases having low frequency in the given position. To build optimal alignment of sought sequence against profile, we also introduced the weight for opening insertion or deletion νdo and weight νdc for their continuation. Thereby the correlation in the formation of adjacent insertions or deletions is taken into account.2.4. Choosing values for vdo and vdcThen we generated in a random manner three nucleotide sequences S1(k), k = 1, 2, … , y(1), S2(k), k = 1, 2, … , y(2) and S3(k), k = 1, 2, … , y(3). Nucleotide probabilities in sequence S1 are equal to probabilities m′(i,1), nucleotide probabilities in sequence S2 are equal to probabilities m′(i,2) and nucleotide probabilities in sequence S3 are equal to probabilities m′(i,3). Index i varies from 1 to 4. Thereafter, nucleotides of sequence S1 took positions k = t1, t1 + 3, … , t2 − 2; nucleotides of sequence S2 took positions k = t1 + 1, t1 + 4, … , t2 − 1 and nucleotides of sequence S3 took positions k = t1 + 2, t1 + 5, … , t2. This algorithm was used for the generation of 1000 random sequences contained in QV.Selection procedure of the νdo value for each gene from the KEGG databank from which region T was extracted is described below. First, we chose the value for  and νdc = 0.25 νdo. Then we made alignments for the set of random sequences QV and determined the number of sequences having insertions or deletions within the region from t1 to t2. If the fraction of sequences in set QV having at least one insertion or deletion within region from t1 to t2 exceeded 1%, then we increased the value of νdo by 0.1 and calculated νdc = 0.25 νdo again. Alignments of sequences from set QV were also built again using these new parameters. If the fraction of sequences with insertions or deletions was under 1%, then the process was stopped and the obtained value νdo was used for finding the extended region R by local alignment (Sections 2.2 and 2.3). If the fraction of sequences with insertions or deletions was over 1%, then we increased νdo and νdc again as shown earlier and alignments of sequences from set QV were built again.3. Results and discussion3.1. Finding extensions of the regions with TP for genes accumulated in KEGG databankWe analysed 578 868 genes accumulated in 29th release of the KEGG databank (http://www.genome.ad.jp/kegg/). We found 472 288 regions having continuous TP in 457 333 genes. These data indicate that 79% of genes have regions with TP. These results conform to earlier works on TP detection by either using informational methods or other techniques.4–13,32 From these 472 288 regions containing continuous TP, we selected only those the lengths of which were significantly less than that of a gene. This means that the distance from the left and right edges of the TP region to the start and end of the gene was more than 30 bp. This criterion was satisfied for 326 933 TP regions. Then we aligned nucleotide sequences of corresponding genes against TPM (see Sections 2.2 and 2.3), which were revealed in the gene by the method of information decomposition (Section 2.1).We revealed totally 824 genes in which TP regions were extended by using alignment against TPM. General information describing all these sequences can be found in the Section Supplementary data. Details including periodicity alignment and found protein similarities can be found in online databank installed at http://victoria.biengi.ac.ru/pertails/.3.2. Finding protein similarities for the products obtained using active and ancient gene RFsLet us consider those genes in which the region of continuous TP was extended by taking into account nucleotide insertions and deletions (see Section 2.2). Further, we will discuss nucleotide sequences with coordinates from r1 to t1 and from t2 to r2 (Fig. 2). Let us call these sequences T1 and T2 (the region of continuous TP was earlier referred to as T). In sequences T1 and T2, we found TP with insertions and deletions that were very similar to continuous TP T. This is the reason why we found statistically significant alignment from r1 to r2 in sequence S against the weight matrix constructed on the basis of TPM M. We suppose that TP found in sequences T1 and T2 is a trace of some ancient RF that existed in these nucleotide sequences earlier. First column of the matrix M corresponds to the first codon base in sequence S, whereas due to insertions and deletions of nucleotides, in subsequences T1 and T2 matrix M corresponds to alternative ancient RF which may not match the actual RF there. Let us refer to RF specified by matrix M as ‘ancient RF’. We suppose that it is possible to reveal similarity between amino acid sequences obtained by ancient RF from nucleotide sequences T1 and T2 and amino acid sequences accumulated in modern databanks like UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot. Such an assumption is based on the idea that if a gene responsible for the same genetic function existed in several genomes, then insertion or deletion of nucleotides in this gene within one genome does not ultimately lead to analogous changes in another genome. It is important that these sequences should be now known and should not have accumulated many evolutional alterations. This will allow us to see their similarity. We conducted such an investigation within the scope of the present work. Sequences of regions T1 and T2 were translated to amino acid sequences in accordance with the RF existing in the gene and in accordance with ancient RF's revealed by TPM M. For all amino acid sequences obtained in such a way, we searched for their similarities with sequences accumulated in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot databank33 by using BLAST program.34 Totally we found 824 T regions in genes that were extended via joining regions T1 and/or T2. Sixty-four of TP regions T had protein similarities with regions T1 and/or T2 only by ancient the RF constructed on the basis of matrix M (see above). At the same time, for 176 T regions, protein similarities in regions T1 and/or T2 were found only for the active RF of a gene, and in three cases, for both RFs. Five hundred and eighty-one T regions have no protein similarities in regions T1 and/or T2 for amino acid sequences constructed either by the existing gene's RF or by the ancient RF constructed on the basis of matrix M.Let us consider an example of continuous TP extension in a putative dehydratase gene (locus ‘SMa0056’ in KEGG databank). This gene has a length of 1134 bp and contains the region of continuous TP from 16th to 840th nucleotide. TPM for region T and weight matrix w(i,j) is of the form that is shown in Fig. 3. We extended the found TP region T by adding region T2 that leads to the appearance of TP in this gene from the 840th to 1134th nucleotides. Statistical significance ZR of the found alignment R was equal to 17.7. The value ΔF0 equalled 10.25, whereas the value ΔF1 equalled 13.85. This provides the probability of incidental addition of region T2 to region T at a level <10−5.TPM M and position-specific weight matrix w(i,j) built for T region from 16th to 840th nucleotides of the locus ‘SMa0056’ (KEGG databank). For the calculation of weight matrix, we used C = − 0.3, TPM M and position-specific weight matrix w(i,j) built for T region from 16th to 840th nucleotides of the locus ‘SMa0056’ (KEGG databank). For the calculation of weight matrix, we used C = − 0.3, During alignment of the sequence relative to found continuous TP, we revealed the insertion of the nucleotide at position 841 (nucleotide t) of the locus (Fig. 4). This means that after the 840th nucleotide (towards first nucleotide), a shift occurs between TP and RF. Thus, the first codon base in sequence T2 corresponds to the third column of matrix M, whereas in sequence T, the first codon base T2 corresponds to the first column of matrix M (Fig. 4). We suppose that in the past this gene existed without insertion of the nucleotide t in position 841 (towards first nucleotide of a gene) and mutations could not blur the TP existing in this region (Fig. 5). To check this hypothesis, we recoded T2 region to amino acid sequence by the actual gene's RF and by the ancient RF (Fig. 4). Then we searched for similarities with these two amino acid sequences in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot databank. Consequently, we found five cases of similarities for hypothetic sequence only, i.e. for the amino acid sequence obtained by RF specified by TPM M (Fig. 4). At the same time, amino acid sequence constructed by RF specified in KEGG had no similarities at all (Fig. 4). Similarities for hypothetical amino acid sequence were found to dehydratases. Match ratio was >30% (e-value in range from 10−12 to 10−7), i.e. found similarity is evolutionally distant and statistically significant. All found similarities can be accessed at http://victoria.biengi.ac.ru/pertails/perinfo.php?perid=270869.Sequence of ‘SMa0056’ gene from 818th to 877th nucleotide (1) aligned against weight matrix w(i,j). Insertion of 841st nucleotide (nucleotide t) is shown by asterisk. Further under gene, the consensus sequence for TP (2) is shown, which is constructed by matrix М and also by RF existing in gene (3) and RF specified by TPM М named as ancient RF (4). Below translated fragments of the nucleotide sequences are shown. Translation is made according to RF existing in gene (5) and to ancient RF (6). Regions having RF shift are marked in bold.Sequence of ‘SMa0056’ gene from 818th to 877th nucleotide (1) aligned against weight matrix w(i,j).

We selected a base in sequence T in a random manner and then substituted it, also in a random manner, by one of the nucleotides a, t, c or g (with probability of each being equal to 0.25). Thereafter, we estimated statistical significance of obtained sequence according to Equation (2). As follows from figure, statistical significance of TP decreases relatively slow during mutations' accumulation. For example, 10% difference from the original sequence still allows revealing TP at statistically significant level.Resistance of sequence T with continuous TP of gene ‘mlr4742’ to nucleotides' substitutions.

As follows from figure, statistical significance of TP decreases relatively slow during mutations' accumulation. For example, 10% difference from the original sequence still allows revealing TP at statistically significant level.It is also of great interest to point out that the amino acid sequence corresponding to the gene ‘SMa0056’ from the KEGG databank has similar amino acid sequences in the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot databank. This amino acid sequence is designated as ‘Q931B9_RHIME’ in the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot databank. Similarity is observed from the start of the protein to the 280th amino acid. This is true for a set of different mandelate racemase/muconate lactonizing enzymes and glucarate dehydratases (e.g. ‘Q024C0_SOLUE’, ‘A9FRR8_SORC5’). This set also contains five amino acid sequences (‘GUDH_STRCO’, ‘GUDX_ECOLI’, ‘GUDH_ECO57’, ‘GUDH_ECOLI’ and ‘GUDH_PSEPU’), where we found similarity to amino acid sequence produced from 842nd to the end of the gene by the ancient RF. Therefore, it can be assumed that these five sequences existed before the insertion of the 841st or independently of it. These sequences have similarity to the sequence ‘Q931B9_RHIME’ from 1st to 280th ±10 amino acids for the gene's (KEGG) RF and from 281st to 378th amino acids for ancient RF.3.3. DiscussionIn this work, we managed to show that investigation of shifts between TP and RF can reveal possible mutations via RF shift in a gene. We found 824 such genes in which there existed some single-type TP regions separated by deletions or insertions of nucleotides. They account for ∼0.2% of the total number of analysed genes. We suppose that in the past RF and TP in these regions were explicitly linked to each other and shifts between them appeared only after deletions or insertions of nucleotides. Such relatively small fractions of genes in which an RF shift can potentially occur can be explained by the following reasons. First, we searched only for relatively short deletions or insertions having lengths up to 2 nucleotides (d = 2). We confined ourselves to small deletions and insertions because while the length of deletion and insertion increases, the value of function F decreases [see Equation (6)]. Costs of deletion and insertion can be too high; in this case, the value ΔF1 will be statistically insignificant. Thus, the current method will miss the major part of genes containing long deletion and insertion of nucleotides. Second, the technique used works well for the small number of regions where deletions or insertions of nucleotides occurred. If density of deletions and insertions is more than one deletion and insertion for several tens of nucleotides (∼50), then the accurate placement of deletions and insertions using this algorithm will be difficult. This will lead to the statistically insignificant value of ΔF1 for such a gene.In general, in this work, we aimed to reveal the lower bound for the number of genes in which a shift between RF and TP is possible. Actually, there can be much more such genes. These values are also confirmed by data in work2 where the number of genes with RF shift obtained by BLAST program is >1%.The technique used to find shifts between TP and RF and to reveal mutations via RF shift in genes seems to be more preferable than the usage of BLAST program for finding possible similarities. The current method of revealing mutations via an RF shift in the gene does not require finding similarities in the databank of amino acid sequences. Owing to the limited size of the databank, there will always exist a chance that similarities will not be found, al",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hough actually mutation via RF shift will exist. We suppose that complete revealing of mutations via an RF shift in genes is possible by the integration of these two techniques. That is, we also have to investigate genes having 0 ≤ ΔF1 ≤ ΔF0 and to consider that we found mutations via an RF shift if regions T1 and T2 have statistically significant similarities. In this case, the TP just indicates the possibility of an RF shift and the fact of such mutations can be considered to be proved only after revealing similarities with regions T1 and T2. On the other hand, enhancement of the algorithm used in the current work can facilitate the use of more perfect algorithms for finding TP, such as Markov models. This probably will allow us to reveal RF shifts induced by a set of nucleotides insertions and deletions in various gene regions.From the functional point of view, mutations via RF shift seem to be events that are able to cardinally change the gene function. This fact can explain the relatively small number of such events found during investigations in the past and in the current works.2,3,35 They can make a great contribution to the formation of new genes by copying known genes and generating mutations via an RF shift2,3,35 in them. However, the genetic code has to be adapted for this event in some way,36 and the new amino acid sequence has to possess some biological function. Otherwise, overrun of mutational events for the creation of the new gene's function can be too great, and impossible within reasonable evolutional time.In the light of these assumptions, TP can be some kind of test to check the gene's integrity. If the gene was duplicated in the genome, then its new copy may fail the check," which opens up possibilities for evolutional changes of the gene's copy via the RF shift and for the creation of a new gene with a new biological function as a result.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available online at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by Russian Academy of Sciences.Supplementary data""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IntroductionBeer is one of the most common alcoholic beverages, and ∼1.7 × 1011 L are produced annually worldwide.1 Brewing yeasts are mainly divided into two groups, ale brewing yeasts and lager brewing yeasts, according to their use for the production of ales and lagers, respectively. Lager beers are fermented by using lager brewing strains at low temperatures, ranging from 8 to 15°C, and they represent the largest part of the beer market. Therefore, most of the research on beer yeast has been conducted on lager brewing yeast.Ale and lager brewing yeasts belong to the Saccharomyces genus. The first lager brewing yeast that was studied in cultures derived from a single cell was classified as Saccharomyces carlsbergensis, whereas ale brewing yeast was classified as Saccharomyces cerevisiae.2,3 According to subsequent more sophisticated taxonomic techniques such as DNA–DNA hybridization studies, the species S. carlsbergensis was later included in the species Saccharomyces pastorianus,4 and therefore, lager brewing yeast is now classified as S. pastorianus.3 On the basis of the results of DNA–DNA hybridization studies, lager brewing yeast was described as an allopolyploid interspecies hybrid between S. cerevisiae and Saccharomyces bayanus;5 this finding was later supported by some Southern hybridization studies using S. cerevisiae gene probes.6,7 Single-chromosome transfer from lager brewing yeast to S. cerevisiae and subsequent genetic analyses also showed that lager brewing yeast is a species hybrid between S. cerevisiae and another Saccharomyces species, possibly represented by S. bayanus.8–10 As expected in the case of an interspecies hybrid, two divergent orthologous genes were found in this yeast for almost all the genes tested: in most cases, they were very similar to the corresponding S. cerevisiae and S. bayanus genes.10–13 However, a significant sequence divergence was found between a part of the S. bayanus-type MET2 gene of the lager brewing yeast and the corresponding S. bayanus sequence, suggesting that the Sb-type sub-genome is slightly different from S. bayanus.14 Furthermore, because only a few genes or chromosomes have been identified and analyzed in the lager brewing yeast so far, the overall picture of its genome (e.g. genome size and chromosome number and precise structure) has not been clarified yet.Lager brewing yeast mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) show a similar map of restriction sites and the same gene order as S. bayanus, and it differs from S. cerevisiae mtDNA, suggesting that in lager brewing yeast mtDNA has been inherited from the S. bayanus parental species.15There are several biological features that are characteristic of lager brewing yeast, such as a proper degree and timing of flocculation and the efficient ability to assimilate maltose and maltotriose at low temperature.16,17 Another characteristic of lager brewing yeast is the ability to produce a significant amount of sulfite, which is important for the flavor stability of beer in several ways, including antioxidant activity. Lager brewing yeasts produce a larger amount of sulfite [>4 parts per million (ppm)] than ale brewing yeasts (<2 ppm).18 However, the complete understanding of all these characteristics has been limited so far, due to the lack of a full genome sequence of this yeast.Here, we report the entire sequence of the hybrid genome of the lager brewing yeast S. pastorianus strain Weihenstephan 34/70, and compare it with the genome sequences of other Saccharomyces species in order to explore the genetic basis of the characteristics of lager brewing yeast relevant to beer production. The sequence of a lager beer production strain has implications for understanding not only the biological characteristics of lager brewing yeasts but also the post-hybridization evolutionary history of hybrid yeast and species. We believe that the comprehensive analysis of lager brewing yeasts using this sequence will be highly beneficial to the brewing industry in terms of facilitating beer quality control, promoting the development of breeding programs for the construction of new yeast cultures and the development of new alcoholic products.2. Materials and methods2.1. Strain and sequence informationThe lager brewing strain S. pastorianus Weihenstephan 34/70 was provided by Fachhochschule Weihenstephan, Freising, Germany. Genome sequences and annotations for S. cerevisiae S288C, S. bayanus CBS 7001, Saccharomyces castellii CBS 4309, Saccharomyces kudriavzevii CBS 8840, Saccharomyces mikatae CBS 8839 and Saccharomyces paradoxus CBS 432 were obtained from the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD; http://www.yeastgenome.org/) (30 August 2006). Genome sequences for S. cerevisiae YJM789 and RM11-1a were obtained from the GenBank database (accession no. AAFW02000000) and from the Broad Institute (http://www.broad.mit.edu/annotation/genome/saccharomyces_cerevisiae/Home.html), respectively.2.2. Genome sequencing and assemblyA total of 331 798 clone ends were sequenced by the whole genome shotgun method and from cosmid libraries (Supplementary methods and Supplementary Table S1). The sequences were assembled into contigs (continuous blocks of uninterrupted sequence) and supercontigs (contigs linked by paired forward–reverse reads from the same plasmid) using the Phred19 and PCAP20 software packages.2.3. Phylogenetic analysisA NCBI-BLAST blastp search within S. cerevisiae S288C open reading frames (ORFs) was carried out with default parameters to find potential paralogs ORFs (query; S. cerevisiae ORFs DB; S. cerevisiae ORFs). The ORFs aligned against ORFs with high alignment lengths (match length of at least 50 amino acid) and high identities (≥60%) were listed as potential paralogous ORFs. An S. cerevisiae S288C orthologous ORFs set was prepared by removing the potential paralogous ORFs, and it was used for identification of orthologous ORFs.For eight yeast strains (S. pastorianus Weihenstephan 34/70, S. cerevisiae YJM789, RM11-1a, S. bayanus CBS 7001, S. castellii CBS 4309, S. kudriavzevii CBS 8840, S. mikatae CBS 8839 and S. paradoxus CBS 432), the complete set of all predicted ORFs starting with a methionine and having a length of at least 50 amino acids were gathered.Orthologous ORF sets for each strain were gathered by picking up bidirectional best hits. As for lager brewing yeast, each orthologous ORF of S. cerevisiae S288C was aligned to the two different ORFs of this yeast: the best matching ORFs were considered as class1 orthologous ORFs, whereas the second best matching ORFs (with scores >60) were considered as class2 orthologous ORFs. Pairwise distances between two strains were calculated using the Kimura two-parameter model using all the aligned ORFs, and phylogenetic trees were constructed using the UPGMA method. The relative distance of the closest species was computed using the neighbor-joining method.2.4. Gene finding and annotationsORFs that start with a methionine (ATG codon) and consist of more than 50 amino acids (150 bp) were predicted from the supercontigs of lager brewing yeast. Two sets of ORF data were used as references for gene finding and annotations. One consisted of S. bayanus CBS 7001 ORFs, which were also re-annotated from the genome sequence reported (GenBank accession no. AACG02000000). The other was a set of S. cerevisiae S288C annotated ORFs (SGD; http://www.yeastgenome.org/). Each ORF from a given species was used as a query to compare with ORFs from the two other species using NCBI-BLAST blastp. Blast results with scores above 60 were considered as significant hits for each ORF and used for the following steps. First, clusters of the ORF were generated. The 2930 clusters of the lager brewing yeast were composed of two types of ORF, and each ORF cluster was annotated with the functional role according to the descriptions of the S. cerevisiae ORF. In addition, the two sets of ORF in the lager brewing yeast were classified as Sc-type ORF, having higher identity to the S. cerevisiae ORF, and as Sb-type ORF, having higher identity to S. bayanus ORF. Subsequently, the remaining clusters, which had more than two S. cerevisiae ORFs, were annotated by preferentially keeping matches within gene order (synteny) over non-syntenic matches in the supercontigs. The remaining ORFs that were not annotated by the above methods were annotated to best-hit homologs with an identity of ≥40% and marked as non-orthologs. Of the non-orthologs, the ORFs having no homologies with S. cerevisiae S288C or S. bayanus CBS 7001 ORFs were defined as specific for the lager brewing yeast. These ORFs were annotated to the best-hit homologs and their functions were assigned or predicted by BLASTP against the non-redundant database using three thresholds: i.e. an E-value of ≤1 × 10−5, an identity of ≥40% and a match length of at least 60% of both protein lengths, and the domains by Pfam using one threshold, i.e. an E-value of ≤1 × 10−5. Six mtDNA contigs were obtained and assembled into a circular contig by closing the gaps by further sequencing using specific PCR primers across each gap. Gene annotation of the lager brewing yeast mtDNA genome was carried out using a variation of NCBI-BLAST blastn and blastx against mtDNA genomes of S. cerevisiae and manual curation. The annotation of tRNA genes was performed using the program tRNAscan-SE 1.21.2.5. Identification of chromosomal rearrangementsSupercontigs, in which either the gene synteny was not conserved with respect to the S. cerevisiae genome or both Sc- and Sb-type ORFs were included, were considered as candidates for chromosomal rearrangements. The regions containing the cosmid clones, which had an Sc-type sequence at one end and an Sb-type sequence at the other end, were considered as candidates for the chromosomal translocations. These putative translocations were confirmed by PCR amplification across the breakpoints using genomic DNA from the lager brewing yeast as a template and by sequencing analyses of the amplicons.2.6. Optical mappingOptical mapping (opmap; OpGen, Inc., Madison, WI, USA) was performed as reported earlier21 using XhoI restriction endonuclease. To validate and align the assembled sequence by opmap, the predicted lager brewing yeast chromosomal sequences were constructed on the basis of information provided by the assembled sequences, gene annotations and chromosomal rearrangements identified above.2.7. Data depositionThis Whole Genome Shotgun project has been deposited at DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank under the project accession ABPO00000000. The version described in this paper is the first version, ABPO10000000. The accession number for the mitochondrial genome is EU852811.3. Results and discussion3.1. Genome assemblyWe generated 7.8-fold redundant coverage in paired end sequences from the whole genome shotgun plasmids and additional cosmid clones. The sequences were assembled into 3184 contigs and 796 supercontigs using Phred19 and PCAP20 to yield a draft consensus sequence (Table 1). The sequence has a long-range continuity (N50 supercontig length of 108 kb) and 0.26 kb sequence gaps; such a sequence is short compared with the average gene length. The sum of the supercontig lengths including gaps is 23.4 Mb, not including the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) locus.Genome assemblyaSum of contig lengths.bSum of supercontig length, including contig lengths and estimated gap sizes between consecutive contigs.Genome assemblyaSum of contig lengths.bSum of supercontig length, including contig lengths and estimated gap sizes between consecutive contigs.3.2. Phylogenetic relationshipPrevious works based on the sequences of the rDNA internal transcribed spacers (ITS1, ITS2) have led to the definition of a phylogenetic relationship between the Saccharomyces genus in which lager brewing yeast is closely related to S. bayanus.22 However, this definition has led to the construction of inaccurate phylogenetic trees because of the hybrid nature of lager brewing yeast. In addition, single gene phylogenies are much more error-prone than multiple gene phylogenies.23 Recently, whole genome data from Saccharomyces yeasts have provided a greater resolving power by allowing trees to be constructed based on concatenated sets of genes.23 Using this approach, we studied the relationship between lager brewing yeast and the other Saccharomyces yeasts.A set of 2080 ORFs among class1 and 2 of the lager brewing yeast and eight Saccharomyces strains were compared and concatenated for phylogenetic analysis (see Materials and methods). As expected, the constructed phylogenetic tree showed that class1 and 2 were close to S. cerevisiae and S. bayanus, respectively (Fig. 1). This result supported the hypothesis that the lager brewing yeast is a hybrid between the two species, S. cerevisiae and S. bayanus at genomic level. However, evolutionarily, the set of class2 ORFs of the lager brewing yeast was clearly farther apart from S. bayanus CBS 7001 in comparison with the class1 ORFs and the S. cerevisae strains.Phylogenetic tree of class 1 and 2 of the larger brewing yeast and eight yeast species. Branch lengths denote the number of substitutions per base.Phylogenetic tree of class 1 and 2 of the larger brewing yeast and eight yeast species. Branch lengths denote the number of substitutions per base.To explain the distance between the class2 ORFs of the lager brewing yeast and S. bayanus, it is important to highlight that the S. bayanus species is taxonomically very complex. It contains at least two sub-groups of strains:24,25S. bayanus var. bayanus represented by a variety of strains not currently isolated from natural environment and S. bayanus var. uvarum, commonly known as Saccharomyces uvarum, represented by strains that are typically and abundantly isolated from the enological environment. The only S. bayanus strain that has currently been fully sequenced and can therefore be used as a reference in comparative genomic studies is strain CBS 7001, which belong to the S. uvarum group.26 It is reasonable to conclude that this strain is not an ideal reference for studying the lager brewing yeast genome; it is simply the best approximation available so far. Some of the main differences between this yeast and the corresponding sub-genome of the lager brewing yeast are described in this study.3.3. Chromosomal structureAfter clarifying that lager brewing yeast was a hybrid between S. cerevisiae and S. bayanus, we annotated the ORFs of the lager brewing yeast and produced a large-scale alignment of genomic regions by aligning the lager brewing yeast genome with the S. cerevisiae S288C and S. bayanus CBS 7001 genomes (see Materials and methods). The Sb-type ORFs showed clearly lower sequence identities with the corresponding S. bayanus CBS 7001 ORFs (average 92.7%) in comparison with the Sc-type ORFs and the S. cerevisae S288C (99.2%) (Supplementary Table S2), and it was consistent with the phylogenetic analysis. Most of the supercontigs were classified into two groups, i.e. those consisting entirely of Sc-type ORFs and those consisting entirely of Sb-type ORFs (Supplementary Table S2); therefore, the two sub-genomes were designated Sc- and Sb-type, respectively. Except for the sub-telomeric regions, large regions of the Sc- and the Sb-type sub-genomes shared conserved synteny with the S. cerevisiae and S. bayanus genomes (Fig. 2). On the sub-telomeric regions, where syntenies were not well conserved, ∼59% of non-orthologs (111/187) were found. It is in these sub-telomeric regions where many important genes for beer brewing (sugar transporters; HXT and MAL families and lectin-like protein involved in flocculation; FLO families etc.) were found (Supplementary Table S2).Chromosomal structure of lager brewing yeast. The types of lager brewing yeast chromosomes are summarized. The black horizontal bars indicate the S. cerevisiae genome with tick marks for every 100 kbp. Matching pairs of translocations between chromosomes with different numbers are indicated by the orientation of the arrowheads with their common numbering. The locations of chromosomal rearrangements (inversions and deletions) relative to the S. cerevisiae genome are indicated by colored triangles, and the locations and numbers of non-orthologs and lager brewing yeast-specific genes are indicated by colored dots. The non-orthologs that are split into more than two genes by stop codon or frameshift mutation are counted as one, and the genes whose characteristics are deemed dubious are not counted. The positions of these marks, whether they are shown above or below the chromosome bars, do not indicate the strand in which those rearrangements or genes are located in the lager brewing yeast genome.Chromosomal structure of lager brewing yeast. The types of lager brewing yeast chromosomes are summarized. The black horizontal bars indicate the S. cerevisiae genome with tick marks for every 100 kbp. Matching pairs of translocations between chromosomes with different numbers are indicated by the orientation of the arrowheads with their common numbering. The locations of chromosomal rearrangements (inversions and deletions) relative to the S. cerevisiae genome are indicated by colored triangles, and the locations and numbers of non-orthologs and lager brewing yeast-specific genes are indicated by colored dots. The non-orthologs that are split into more than two genes by stop codon or frameshift mutation are counted as one, and the genes whose characteristics are deemed dubious are not counted. The positions of these marks, whether they are shown above or below the chromosome bars, do not indicate the strand in which those rearrangements or genes are located in the lager brewing yeast genome.In addition to the sub-telomeric rearrangements, several internal rearrangements were found in comparison with S. cerevisiae S288C (Fig. 2). One and three inversions were found in Sc- and Sb-type sub-genomes, respectively (Fig. 2). The Sc-type sub-genome showed an inversion of 30 kb (570–600 kb of Sc-type chromosome XIV) (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table S3A). The sequence of S. cerevisiae RM11-1a27 and YJM78928 revealed that the same region was also inverted in comparison with S. cerevisiae S288C. Two of the inversions found in the Sb-type sub-genome (117–133 and 164–181 kb of Sb-type chromosomes V and VI, respectively) (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table S3A) have also been identified in S. bayanus CBS 7001.26 The remaining inversion spans within the interval between 553 and 560 kb on the Sb-type chromosome XIV. Two translocations were found in the Sc-type sub-genomes. A novel chromosome comprising a combination of Sc-type chromosomes V and XI created by the translocation present in the Ty element was detected, and a fragment corresponding to 32 kb of the Sc-type chromosome XV of S. cerevisiae S288C was also found to be translocated to the Sc-type chromosome XI inside an identical area of 34 bp located between FRE2 and FRE3 (Table 2). On the other hand, two reciprocal translocations (Sb-types II–IV and VIII–XV) were found in the Sb-type sub-genome (Table 2); these translocations have been reported previously in lager brewing yeast6,7 as well as in S. bayanus.26 Furthermore, the genome of S. bayanus CBS 7001 has three reciprocal translocations (right arm of II and left arm of II, VI–X and II–XIV).26 However, the gene syntenies of the corresponding regions in the Sb-type sub-genome are the same as those of S. cerevisiae (Supplementary Table S3C). Eight chimera chromosomes between the Sc- and the Sb-type sub-genomes were found in the lager brewing yeast, indicating a post-hybridization event (Fig. 2). Although the breakpoints of the chromosomal translocations in the Saccharomyces lineage seem to be associated to Ty elements or highly similar pairs of ribosomal protein genes,29 those in the lager brewing yeast were found between the orthologous non-ribosomal protein genes, with the exception of chromosome III (Table 2). One was a reciprocal translocation between the orthologs, ScYJR009C (ScX) and SbYJR009C (SbX), which share the 96.1% sequence identity over an 840 bp homology region (Supplementary Fig. S1). The other seven translocations occurred by non-reciprocal recombinations. The non-reciprocal translocation between ScIII and SbIII was found to be at the MAT-locus, which involved a 604 bp homologous region. The remaining six non-reciprocal translocations (ScVII/SbVII, ScXI/SbXI, ScXIII/SbXIII, ScXVI/SbXVI, ScXVI/SbXVI and ScXVI/SbXVI) occurred between their orthologs ORFs (YGL173C, YKL045W, YMR302C, YPL240C, YPR160W and YPR191W), which share 81–87% sequence identity (Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. S1). The sequencing of these translocation products showed that exchange occurred inside their identical short regions (8–23 bp) (Supplementary Fig. S1).List of chromosomal translocationsList of chromosomal translocationsTranslocations usually occur between sequences at identical positions on homologous chromosomes in order to repair DNA for chromosome disjunction.30,31 Abbreviated translocations have been shown to be common in S. cerevisiae, but most of them are mediated through long regions of homologous Ty or sub-telomeric Y′ element recombination.32 However, in the present study, we observed that most of the chromosomal translocations between the Sc- and the Sb-type chromosomes occurred between the short homologous regions of orthologous genes, which showed 81–96% sequence divergences. Sequence divergence acts as a potent barrier for translocations. The translocations found in the lager brewing yeast are rare since the recombination rates for diverged sequences are 2.2 × 10−9 (82% sequence divergence) and 5.4 × 10−8 (96%) in Saccharomyces yeast.33 The frequencies are increased in double-strand breaks (DBSs). When DSBs were induced by ionizing radiation in the diploid S. cerevisiae genome, a translocation was found between the short homology region (26 bp) of the two homologs (90.7% sequence identity).34 Thus, it seems that the translocations found between Sc- and Sb-type chromosomes were mediated by the fortuitous appearance of broken chromosomes ends produced by DSBs in either of the two orthologs.An optical mapping (opmap)21 using XhoI restriction endonuclease was performed to determine the genome size and chromosomes number. The DNA from the lager brewing yeast yielded an optical map of 36 chromosomes of ∼26.1 Mb, not including the rDNA cluster (Table 3). This genome size and the number of chromosomes are more than twice those of S. cerevisiae S288C (16 chromosomes and 12.1 Mb, respectively). In order to validate the predicted chromosomal structures, 36 chromosomal DNA sequences were constructed by connecting supercontigs without gaps (as shown in Supplementary Table S2) and then compared with the opmap. All the 36 sequences showed clear one-to-one matches to the 36 corresponding chromosomes found by the opmap (Supplementary Fig. S2). The total size of the 36 chromosomal DNA sequences was 25.0 Mb, and hence, the coverage was 95.8% of the estimated genome size, as determined by opmap (Table 3). On the basis of these results, we conclude that the lager brewing yeast has 36 chromosomes, whereas its parental species, S. cerevisiae and S. bayanus, have 16 chromosomes each.Opmap and comparison with the predicted chromosomeOpmap and comparison with the predicted chromosome3.4. rDNA locusThe rDNA of S. cerevisiae is a region of ∼1.5 Mb, consisting of 150 tandem copies of a 9.1 kb repeat containing the ITS and is located on the right arm of chromosome XII. The lager brewing yeast we analyzed has two types of chromosomes XII and two types of ITS sequence: one is closely related to S. cerevisiae and the other to S. bayanus (Fig 2 and Supplementary Fig. S3). Strains S. pastorianus CBS 1538 and S. carlsbergensis CBS 1513, historical lager brewing yeasts, not currently used in beer manufacturing, show only the Sb-type ITS sequence. Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) of these two strains with S. cerevisiae yeast DNA microarrays revealed, in fact, that the Sc-type chromosome XII has been lost in both strains.35 Although the length of the rDNA region on the Sc-type chromosome XII was estimated to be >350 kb, that on the Sb-type chromosome XII, according to the opmap and PCR amplification, was of 18 kb (Supplementary Fig. S2 and Table S3C). This result indicates that the rDNA region on the Sb-type chromosome XII decreased massively. Analysis carried out by genomic in situ hybridization with labeled rDNA sequences in the alloploid grass, Zingeria trichopoda, also revealed that the 45S rDNA from one of the parental genomes had undergone significant reduction.363.5. Structure of the mitochondrial genomeThe mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of the lager brewing yeast was also sequenced and assembled into a circular contig. The size of the mtDNA was 70 578 bp, somewhat smaller than that of S. cerevisiae S288C (85 779 bp) and slightly larger than that of S. bayanus (64.3 kb) (Supplementary Fig. S4). The mtDNA of the lager brewing yeast was also found to contain several differences (gene order, number of exons and intron–exon boundaries of COX1, COB1 and 21SrRNA) in comparison with S. cerevisiae (Supplementary Fig. S4). On the other hand, it showed many aspects of similarity with the mtDNA of S. bayanus. The gene order was the same as that of S. bayanus,37 and it was completely consistent with the results of mapping obtained with restriction enzymes.15 In addition, all mtDNA genes exhibited a higher sequence similarity with the corresponding genes of S. bayanus than with those of S. cerevisiae (Supplementary Table S4). We concluded that the mtDNA of the lager brewing yeast was inherited from its Sb-type ancestor without shuffling between the Sc- and the Sb-type mtDNA genomes.3.6. ORF deletionTwenty-eight and 33 ORFs were found to have been shortened (truncated) by frameshift or stop codon mutation in the Sc- and Sb-type sub-genomes, respectively (Supplementary Table S5), whereas the ORF lengths between Saccharomyces sensu stricto are quite conserved.26 This can be expected as the result of a yeast having two functional copies of each gene that releases the evolutionary pressure on one copy. Of these ORFs, three were found to be essential by a large-scale deletion study in S. cerevisiae,38 indicating that they must have been truncated after the interspecies hybridization event. In addition, some ORFs involved in the characteristics of lager brewing yeast were also found to be truncated (see below).3.7. Maltose and maltotriose uptake genesMaltose and maltotriose are the most abundant fermentable sugars in wort, and the rate at which brewing yeast takes up these sugars can have a major impact on the fermentation performance. The α-glucoside transporter genes, with nine predicted transmembrane domains, are responsible for the uptake of maltose and maltotriose. Increasing the expression of the α-glucoside transporters have been shown to increase the rate of maltose fermentation.39 Three α-glucoside transporter genes in each Sc- and Sb-type sub-genome were found on seven loci (Table 4). LBYG03039 was identical to MTT1, which encodes an efficient maltotriose transporter in lager brewing yeasts,40 and was found to be on both chromosomes ScVII and SbVII (Table 4). This indicates that the gene copy number of MTT1 in the lager brewing yeast has increased thanks to the chromosomal translocation. Another α-glucoside transporter gene (MPH3), which was found in S. cerevisiae S288C, was not found in the lager brewing yeast genome. This is consistent with previous studies carried out with Southern blotting.41,42 LBYG09472 (Sc-type AGT1) and LBYG14145 (Sb-type MAL31) showed truncated forms having only two and three predicted transmembrane domains and are, hence, unlikely to be functional. In total, six α-glucoside transporter genes were found in seven chromosomal regions in the lager brewing yeast sequenced in this work, but two of these were truncated.Genes related to lager brewing yeast characteristicsα-Glucoside transporter genes and genes related to the sulfite production pathway are shown. In Saccharomyces sensu stricto yeast, sulfite is produced in the methionine and cysteine biosynthesis pathway. Sulfate is imported into a cell by sulfate transporters, Sul1p and Sul2p and is converted into APS (adenylylsulfate) by ATP sulfurylase, Met3p. APS is phosphorylated, yielding PAPS (3′-phosphoadenylyl-sulfate) by adenylylsulfate kinase, Met14p. Sulfite is yielded by the reduction of PAPS by 3′-phosphoadenylylsulfate reductase, Met16p. Excess sulfite is passed out of the cell by a sulfite transporter, Ssu1p.The Tr in brackets indicates the truncated genes. The genes were aligned against S. cerevisiae gene using Blastp, and each S. cerevisiae gene with the highest score is shown. Non-truncated and truncated protein sequence identities were calculated by the global alignment tool (needle) and local alignment tool, respectively, which were provided by EMBOSS. Genes that were found in lager brewing yeast but in which the specific chromosome could not be decided are shown as ‘unknown’.aNote that the genes were confirmed by PCR amplification and sequencing (Supplementary Sequence S1).Genes related to lager brewing yeast characteristicsα-Glucoside transporter genes and genes related to the sulfite production pathway are shown.

Hatanaka et al., manuscript in preparation). These results indicate that adaptation to brewing conditions resulted not only in the increase of the copy number of efficient α-glucoside transporter genes but also in the inactivation of less efficient genes, since the capacity of membrane-localized proteins may have been limited.3.8.

fite compared with ale brewing yeasts.18 Two distinct Sc- and Sb-type genes were found in the lager brewing yeast sulfite production pathway, with the exception of MET16 (Table 4). Lager brewing yeast, in fact, has only Sb-type MET16 because of a deletion on chromosome XVI in the area (from 861 to 920 kb) that includes the Sc-type MET16. Lager brewing yeast has four sulfate transporter genes: Sc-type-SUL1, SUL2 and Sb-type-SUL1, SUL2. The SUL1 gene sequences from S. cerevisiae encode an 859 amino acid polypeptide with nine predicted transmembrane domains, but Sc- and Sb-type SUL1 genes were found to encode truncated (183 and 295 amino acids) polypeptides with stop codon and frameshift mutations, respectively. These proteins are unlikely to be functional transporters because they have only one and three transmembrane domains. Five genes (Sc-MET3, Sb-MET3, Sc-MET14, Sb-MET14 and Sb-MET16) were found on two chromosomes due to chromosome translocations (Table 4), indicating that these gene loci were increased in copy number.3.9. Lager brewing yeast-specific genesEight genes were found to be present in the lager brewing yeast but absent in both S. cerevisiae S288C and S. bayanus CBS 7001. Except for an YJM789 homolog (LBYG13 665), these were all located in sub-telomeric regions (Table 5). LBYG05796 (encoding a transcriptional regulatory protein) was also found in YJM789.28 LBYG11275 (encoding a melibiase), LBYG08543 (a fructose symporter), LBYG05774, (a tyrosine permease), LBYG05783 (an amidase) and LBYG09147 (an amidase) have been identified and characterized in lager brewing yeast, and some of their functions are specific of lager brewing yeast.43–46 Only one of the lager brewing yeast specific genes (LBYG09608) did not have any previous Saccharomyces homologs. According to the results retrieved by the PSORT II system (http://psort.hgc.jp/form2.html), this gene is predicted to encode a monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) with major facilitator superfamily, and localize in the plasma membrane or in the endoplasmic reticulum. Subsequent tests demonstrated that it is expressed at the middle and late stages of lager beer fermentation (data not shown).Lager brewing yeast-specific genesLager brewing yeast-specific genes that were found to be present only in the lager brewing yeast strain but absent in S. cerevisiae S288C and S. bayanus CBS 7001. The genes were identified by Blastp search against the non-redundant database and by Pfam search, and each description with the highest score or nearly the highest score is shown.Lager brewing yeast-specific genesLager brewing yeast-specific genes that were found to be present only in the lager brewing yeast strain but absent in S. cerevisiae S288C and S. bayanus CBS 7001. The genes were identified by Blastp search against the non-redundant database and by Pfam search, and each description with the highest score or nearly the highest score is shown.MCTs form a large family of proton-linked carriers that have the ability to transport monocarboxylates such as lactate, pyruvate or acetate across the plasma membrane, and they can be found in bacteria, protozoa, fungi, invertebrates, as well as in vertebrates.47 Pyruvate, acetate and lactate are by-products formed during yeast alcoholic fermentation. Therefore, LBYG09608 gene encoding MCT may be expressed at the middle and late stages of fermentation to control these monocarboxylates in the plasma membrane or in the endoplasmic reticulum.3.10. Origins and evolution of lager brewing yeastThe genome sequencing of S. pastorianus Weihenstephan 34/70 confirmed at genomic level that lager brewing yeasts are hybrids between the two species S. cerevisiae and S. bayanus. The phylogenetic tree shown in Fig. 1, constructed on the basis of concatenated sets of genes of various Saccharomyces yeasts and the high sequence identities between Sc-type and S. cerevisiae ORFs show that the Sc-type sub-genome of the lager brewing yeast is clearly close to S. cerevisiae. Recently, Dunn and Sherlock,48 on the basis of results obtained using two species CGH array analysis, reported that the most probable ancestral parent of lager brewing yeasts Sc-type sub-genome is related to ale brewing yeasts. The contribution of ale brewing yeasts to the shaping of the lager brewing yeast Sc-type sub-genome, already proposed by de Barros Lopes et al.,49 is a very likely possibility.Lager brewing yeast Sb-type sub-genome contributes to the most useful features typical of this yeast. However, the full identification of this sub-genome has never been achieved and this is probably due to the complexity of the S. bayanus species as well as the lack of a proper reference strain, as already described above. Our results show that the Sb-type sub-genome is clearly further apart from S. bayanus CBS 7001, which actually belongs to the S. uvarum group and is closely related to the enological environment. Additionally, although S. bayanus CBS 7001 genome has three reciprocal translocations (right arm of II and left arm of II, VI–X and II–XIV),26 the gene syntenies of the corresponding Sb-type lager brewing yeast chromosomal regions are the same as those of S. cerevisiae. We demonstrated in a previous study that the yeast that best represent the Sb-type sub-genome is strain NBRC 1948.50 This yeast, unlike S. bayanus CBS 7001, is currently classified as S. bayanus var. bayanus and was originally isolated from beer. The typing of 48 gene fragments in various lager brewing yeasts by RFLP analysis showed that the Sb-type sub-genome differed from the genome of strain NBRC 1948 only for a few genes. Saccharomyces uvarum sequences in lager brewing yeasts were limited to the few genes portions in which S. bayanus var. bayanus strains could not be distinguished from S. uvarum strains.50 This indicates a common origin of S. bayanus and S. uvarum yeasts and a subsequent differentiated evolution process in the brewing and in the enological environment, respectively.The origin of the Sb-type sub-genome can also be confirmed by studying mtDNA inheritance. Several works have demonstrated that in lager brewing yeast the mtDNA genome is originating from the S. bayanus parental strain. In artificial interspecies, hybrid mtDNA is inherited by only one of the parental strains.51 Consequently, the sequence analysis of the mtDNA in lager brewing yeasts can be very useful to define the nature of the S. bayanus parental genome. According to our results, the nucleotide sequence of lager brewing yeast COXII, COXIII, ATP8, ATP6 and 21S rRNA showed a 2–4% sequence divergence with the corresponding S. uvarum genes (Supplementary Table S4). On the other hand, the nucleotide sequence of lager brewing yeast COXII gene was identical to S. bayanus var. bayanus NBRC 1948 COXII gene, and mtDNA restriction analysis carried out with three enzymes confirmed this result.52 Considering our present and previous results, the Sb-type sub-genome did not originate from S. uvarum, but from an S. bayanus var. bayanus yeast closely related to strain NBRC 1948.Several studies have been carried out to explain the origin and the evolutionary processes that lager brewing yeasts has undergone. Either a simple hybridization event between an S. cerevisiae and S. bayanus yeast, or more likely, a multiple hybridization event as proposed by de Barros Lopes et al.,49 followed by chromosomal loss and rearrangements are the most likely processes to have occurred, since they are common mechanisms for yeast genome evolution.53 The hybridization between haploid S. bayanus and S. cerevisiae spores proposed by Dunn and Sherlock48 seems a less probable mechanism, given the fact that interspecies hybrid constructed in vitro by conjugating haploid spores are generally stable and do not undergo genome rearrangements.54According to our results, following the hybridization event, lager brewing yeast genome was shaped as follows: eight chromosomal translocations between the Sc- and the Sb-type sub-genomes occurred and due to chromosomal translocations, the number of chromosomes increased with respect to the parental species. We have demonstrated that the lager brewing yeast possess 36 chromosomes, whereas its putative parental species, S. cerevisiae and S. bayanus, possess 16. The translocations between diverged sequences are rare in Saccharomyces yeast as described above.33 The stressful condition typical of alcoholic fermentation might have driven the evolution of lager brewing yeast and the translocation that occurred to shape its genome. An experimental study of S. cerevisiae in a continuous culture under glucose limitation, for example, revealed that the selection pressure imposed by the environmental conditions can result in the selection of strains having translocations, being aneuploid or increasing the copy number of the high-affinity hexose transporter genes.55 Another study proposed that gross chromosomal translocations were enhanced by ethanol and acetaldehyde.56 A chromosomal translocation mediated by short homology has also been found in wine strains which are also exposed to multiple stress factors during alcoholic fermentation.57 Thus, it seems that the multiple stress factors that lager brewing yeast have been exposed to (such as low fermentation temperature, low pH, sugar depletion and high ethanol conditions) could have determined or facilitated chromosomal translocations, as a process of evolutionary adaptation. Most translocations after the hybridization event occurred by non-reciprocal recombination. It has been demonstrated that in S. cerevisiae, chromosomal translocations seem to increase as diploid yeast cells age. While in young cells, translocations occur by reciprocal recombination, in the old mother’s progeny, they occur by non-reciprocal recombination.58 This phenomenon could explain the translocation that occurred in lager brewing yeast by non-reciprocal recombination. Lager brewing fermentation is traditionally carried out by transferring the yeast culture from one fermentation batch to the following; thus, it is possible that non-reciprocal translocations between the Sc- and the Sb-type chromosomes occurred in an aged lager brewing yeast cell that adapted to lager brewing conditions. Non-reciprocal translocations usually cause the change of gene dosage. In the lager brewing yeast we sequenced, one large region of the Sc-type chromosomes and five large regions of the Sb-type chromosomes have been deleted and unilateral chromosomal regions have been increased by these non-reciprocal translocations. The increased number of loci caused by the translocations of one gene associated to an efficient maltose and maltotriose uptakes and of genes associated to sulfite production might have been the result not only of adaptation to the lager brewing conditions, but also and especially to human-driven selection. More than any other yeast the evolution of lager brewing yeasts has been strongly influenced by human-imposed selection, which has favored strains with optimal fermentation characteristics and good organoleptic traits. The lager brewing yeast sequenced in this study, possess a non-functional Sc-type AGT1 gene; however, it still showed an increase in sugar assimilation rate when compared with lager brewing yeast with functional AGT1, suggesting that not only chromosomal translocation but also gene deletion and truncation after the hybridization event have been beneficial for lager brewing yeast.Dunn and Sherlock48 classified lager brewing yeasts into two distinct groups based on their shared sets of chromosomes; group 1 included strains that had lost a significant portion of the S. cerevisiae genome, and group 2 included strains that had preserved all genomic contents of both S. cerevisiae and S. bayanus. The set of 17 lager brewing strains these authors tested did not include any current production strains. The strain sequenced in this work is currently used in lager beer production and could be considered as a representative of lager brewing production strains. According to this grouping, our representative production strain is part of Group 2, in fact it possess almost the two entire sets of sub-genomes. Furthermore, most of the breakpoints of non-reciprocal translocations that we found seem to be consistent with the CGH analysis these authors performed, although they have not been confirmed by sequencing analysis.3.11. ImplicationsLager brewing yeast is economically the most important yeast for beer brewing, but its genome sequence had not yet been determined, partly due to its complexity and partly to the lack of knowledge of its genome structure. In this study, the genome sequence was determined by the whole genome shotgun sequencing, by the additional cosmid sequencing and subsequently confirmed by opmap. This work represents the first example of the whole genome sequencing of a lager brewing yeast strain and demonstrates that lager brewing yeasts comprises two sub-genomes, one originating from S. cerevisiae and the other from S. bayanus. Sequence comparison between Sb-type sub-genome and mtDNA of lager brewing yeast and those of S. bayanus CBS 7001 (S. uvarum) supports the notion that the Sb-type sub-genome in the current lager brewing strain is not originating from S. uvarum, but rather from S. bayanus var. bayanus.There are several specific biological features of lager brewing yeast such as the production of a significant amount of sulfite and the ability to ferment at low temperatures (ranging from 8 to 15°C). The Sb-type sub-genome is possibly responsible for these features since S. cerevisiae produces a relatively small amount sulfite18 and ferments at higher temperatures, whereas the hybrid strains between S. cerevisiae and S. bayanus ferment fast and efficiently at low-temperature.59 However, a clear understanding of these characteristics has been limited because of the lack of a complete genome sequence of this yeast. We have made the lager brewing yeast genome a freely accessible resource, and this represent a significant step towards further analysis of the lager brewing yeast. This may benefit research programs of genetic engineering or breeding designed to improve brewing yeast strains. New technologies for comprehensive analyses (gene expression analysis, polymorphism analysis and proteome analysis) can also be developed. These technologies promise further advances in the science of lager brewing yeast, such as understanding why lager brewing yeast is good for lager beer brewing, and the detection of sequence polymorphisms among lager strains for reference of the strain-specific characteristics. Indeed, comprehensive gene expression analysis of lager brewing yeasts under lager beer production using lager brewing yeast DNA microarray has revealed that the expression level of the Sb-type SSU1 gene, encoding a sulfite transporter, was causing the elevated sulfite production of lager brewing yeast.60To our knowledge, this work is the first example of a genome sequencing project of a hybrid species. In principle, whole genome duplication may allow for large-scale adaptation to new environments, and subsequent gene-loss events then led to current genome by a large number of rearrangement events and individual gene deletions, which persists until the genome returns to functionally normal ploidy through the mutation, gene loss and genomic rearrangements.29 The same is the case in the lager brewing yeast, in which larger chromosomal regions have been deleted, the rDNA cluster of the Sb-type chromosome XII has been drastically reduced, and many truncated genes were found. This indicates that such rearrangements are subsequent to genome hybridization.The genome information and the new technology involved will be useful not only for their possible industrial applications but also for academic basic research. In particular, lager brewing yeast provides an excellent case to understand whole genome duplication and multiple genomes evolution and organization.Supplementary dataSupplementary Material is available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.We thank Y.

IntroductionThe development of DNA markers has made it possible to study the naturally occurring allelic variation controlling quantitative traits loci (QTL).1,2 QTL analysis based on high-resolution linkage maps is now routinely performed in various plant species and has resulted in the mapping loci of many genes involved in agronomically important traits.3–9A high-resolution, high-density linkage map of rice has been constructed10–12 and used for QTL analyses that identified loci and genes involved in heading date13–16 and culm length.17 Like most other QTL analyses in rice, this was performed using crosses between the subspecies indica and japonica where it is relatively easy to obtain molecular markers and construct saturated linkage maps. However, the use of such distant cross combinations can disturb efficient identification of QTLs because of the prevalence of hybrid seed sterility and the simultaneous segregations of many other loci. As such, it is difficult to identify loci or alleles of minor effect. To do so usually requires the generation of additional genetic resources including near isogenic lines or chromosome segment substitution lines which need repeated backcrosses.In contrast, japonica × japonica cross combinations have an apparent advantage in analyzing minor QTL and identifying alleles responsible for local variation, because of the segregation of only a few loci.18 Thus, to breed japonica cultivars, DNA markers that can be used among closely related lines need to be developed. However, the difficulty in obtaining a sufficient number of evenly distributed molecular markers severely restricts the widespread applicability of linkage analysis using cross combination within temperate japonica cultivars. Although several projects to obtain more markers are currently proceeding, the recent reports reaffirmed that it is costly and time consuming to obtain suitable DNA markers.19–21 For example, Shirasawa et al.21 indicated that the average frequencies of genes having single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the whole genome within japonica cultivars are 9.2% (2944/32 000), while those between japonica and indica cultivars are 94.8% (30 336/32 000). Although some QTL analyses using short sequence repeat (SSR), SNP and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers on temperate japonica × temperate japonica populations have been conducted,18,22–27 the ratio of polymorphic markers among these varieties were about 10% (7.3–15.7%) (Table 1). That means, in order to obtain 100 DNA markers, screening ∼1000 markers is required.Summary of QTL analysis among temperate japonica × japonica cross combinationsSummary of QTL analysis among temperate japonica × japonica cross combinationsTransposable elements (TEs) have also been exploited in the development of molecular markers.28–33 In this regard, the most valuable TEs are those that are actively transposing and generating insertion site polymorphisms. Unfortunately, the rice genome is relatively stable with very few actively transposing elements. So far, only two TEs have been employed as markers among temperate japonica varieties.27 Although TE insertion polymorphism was shown to be more frequent (42.3%) than other DNA markers, the total number of applicable TE markers was only 52.27Here we report the successful generation of molecular markers using the newly characterized mPing element. This element was independently discovered by three labs as the first active miniature inverted-repeat transposable element as well as the first active DNA transposon in rice.34–36 A subsequent study revealed that mPing copy number was generally less than 50 in most cultivars, but that it had amplified to over 1000 copies in one strain, Gimbozu EG4 (EG4, hereafter). Thus, there are more than 1000 insertion site polymorphisms of mPing when EG4 is compared with other cultivars including all characterized strains of the japonica subspecies. Of these 1000 insertions, most of them (90%) were into the single copy regions, and more than 70% were located within 5 kb of transcribed DNA.37In this study, we have designed 150 sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) markers based on the sequence information of mPing insertion sites in EG4. We will discuss the advantage of this novel marker system, which can be easily applicable for genetic analyses between closely related genomes.2. Materials and methods2.1 Plant materials and genomic DNA extractionIn 2005, a total of 190 F5 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) (12 plants per line) of EG4 × Nipponbare were grown in the paddy field of Kyoto University (35°01′N) under natural day length conditions. Seeds were sown on 17 May and transplanted on 7 June in an irrigated rice field. The heading date of F5 plants (190 lines × × 12 plants/line = 2280) and parental plants was determined by calculating the average value of each line, monitoring for the appearance of the first panicle. Leaf material for DNA extraction was collected after monitoring heading date to minimize damage to F5 plants.In 2007, a total of 96 F7 RILs (12 plants/line) were grown under the same conditions as described above. Seeds were sown on 1 May and transplanted on 24 May in an irrigated rice field. The culm length of those plants was measured to the top internodes. The heading date of those plants was also determined as described above. Genomic DNA of all plant materials was extracted by the cetyl tri-methylammonium bromide (CTAB) method.382.2 SSR markersPCR for SSR markers was performed in 5 µL containing 0.5 µL 10× Ex-Taq buffer, 0.5 µL dNTPs (2 mM each), 0.25 µL DMSO, 0.02 µL Ex taq, l00 ng genomic DNA and 5 pmol of each primer. PCR conditions were as follows: 94°C for 10 min; 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 50°C for 1 min and 72°C for 30 s; 72°C for 7 min.Reaction products were loaded on 12% polyacrylamide gels, run at 500 v for 2 h, stained with ethidium bromide and gels were scanned with molecular imager FX (Nippon Bio-Rad Laboratories, Tokyo).2.3 mPing-SCAR markersPrimers flanking mPing insertion sites in EG4 were designed based on sequence information from a previous study.37 PCR for mPing-SCAR markers was performed in 5 µL containing 0.5 µL 10× Ex-Taq buffer, 0.5 µL dNTP mix (2 mM each), 0.25 µL DMSO, 0.02 µL Ex-Taq, l00 ng genomic DNA and 8 pmol of each primer. The cycling parameters were as follows: 94°C for 3 min; 30 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 58°C for 45 s and 72°C for 3 min; 72°C for 3 min.Amplicons of mPing-SCAR markers were resolved in 1.0% agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide and visualized under UV light.2.4 Determining mPing excision frequencymPing excision was assessed by PCR. Primers were designed flanking six mPing insertion sites that are shared by Nipponbare and EG4. Their sequences are: AC107315_U1: TGAAATAACATAGCCATACCAG, AC107315_L1: AGGGTTTTTGGATACGAATGA, AC083492_U1: GATGTTGATGGTAGTGTGAGAG, AC083492_L1: TGCTGTAATAGTTTGGGGGTAG, AC121491_U1: GGTAACTGTAGTAGCGTAGTG, AC121491_L1: GAGAGCATCCACAACGAATAAT, AP003542_U1: TTGGGTAGGGTTGTGGGGATTT, AP003542_L1: GAGATGGGACTTGAGGAGAGAC, AP003634_U1: AAAAGAAAACAGAAAACAGTCG, AP003634_L1: CGCTCAACATAAACCAAAAACC, BX000500_U1: AGTTGATACGATAATGCTTCTA, and BX000500_L1: CTTCTTTTCTCTCCTCCTTTTC. For EG4-specific insertion sites, 20 primer pairs of mPing-SCAR markers (MK1_1, MK1_10, MK1_12, MK1_13, MK1_22, MK1_23, MK1_28, MK1_29, MK1_30, MK1_32, MK2_1, MK2_2, MK2_4, MK2_5, MK2_8, MK2_23, MK3_2, MK3_9, MK3_13 and MK5_2) were chosen to analyze excision. PCR conditions were the same as described above.2.5 Mapping of mPing-insertion sitesChromosomal distribution of the mPing-SCAR markers and SSR markers were analyzed with 190 F5 RILs derived from a cross between EG4 and Nipponbare. Linkage analysis was performed with Mapmaker version 3.0.392.6 QTL analysis of heading date and culm lengthComposite interval mapping,40 which combines interval mapping with multiple regression, was done using Windows QTL Cartographer 2.0 with forward and backward regression.41 The experiment-wise LOD threshold significance level was determined by computing 1000 permutations,42 as implemented by the QTL cartographer.3. Results and discussion3.1 Screening for SSR markersSSR markers were first used for genotyping Nipponbare/EG4 RILs. However, only 46 of 661 markers tested (7.0%) were polymorphic. In addition, the distribution of these markers was uneven. Only a few markers were found polymorphic on chromosomes 3, 5, 6 and 9–12. In addition, there were long stretches of the genome without any markers on each of the 12 chromosomes of rice (see Fig. 1 for details). These results illustrate the difficulty of using conventional molecular markers for linkage analysis of japonica × japonica cross.The genetic map based on the mPing-SCAR markers and SSR markers. mPing-SCAR markers are shown in black whereas SSR markers are shown in red (see text for details).The genetic map based on the mPing-SCAR markers and SSR markers. mPing-SCAR markers are shown in black whereas SSR markers are shown in red (see text for details).3.2 Designing mPing-SCAR markersIn a prior study it was determined that there were over 1000 insertion site polymorphisms of mPing between EG4 and Nipponbare.37 To exploit these polymorphisms in the development of molecular markers, we designed primer pairs based on genomic sequences flanking carefully selected mPing insertions (Fig. 2A). Insertion site polymorphisms were easily detected in both homozygous and in heterozygous genotypes, indicating that these primer sets could serve as co-dominant markers (Fig. 2B). The genotypes could be easily determined by 15-min electrophoresis in 1.0% agarose gels (Fig. 2B). Of 219 primer sets tested, 183 were successfully amplified, and 150 were found to be polymorphic between EG4 and Nipponbare.The use of mPing-SCAR markers. (A) Schematic of a polymorphic locus.

The gel image was visualized after 15 min running at 100 V.3.3 Stability of mPing-SCAR markersTransposition usually involves two events, element excision and element reinsertion elsewhere in the genome. In the previous finding, there are approximately 50 new mPing insertions per plant per generation in EG4.37 If mPing excises frequently, it has no value as a molecular markers. Thus, the excision frequency of six insertion sites was checked in 400 Nipponbare and 399 EG4 plants by PCR with flanking primers. Of all insertion sites tested, not a single empty site was detected (data not shown). In addition, 20 EG4-specific insertion sites in 96 EG4 plants were also tested for excision events by PCR using flanking primers. Only one plant showed a single excision at MK1_22 on chromosome 1 (see Materials and methods for details and Fig. 1). No empty sites were detected in any other plants (data not shown).Based on the haploid copy number of EG4 (1163)37 and the average number of new insertions (50)37 per plant per generation, the probability of excision for any single copy of mPing should be 0.0215 (=50/(1163 × 2)). However, the observed excision frequency in the 96 EG4 plants was 80-fold lower than the expected value (only 0.00 026 (=1/(20 × 96 × 2))). How can there be so many new insertions without any apparent excision of mPing? This contradiction can be explained if mPing moves by the gap repair mechanism where double-strand breaks generated by mPing excisions are repaired by utilizing a copy of mPing from either the sister chromatid or from the homologous chromosome.43,44 In total, mPing excisions are very rare events and do not disturb linkage analysis.On the other hand, segregation distortion has always been observed in other linkage analysis. For example, in the F2 population of Nipponbare (japonica) × Kasalath (indica), 11 loci were detected to deviate from the expected 1:2:1 segregation.45 Kwon et al.31 also reported that 40–60% of the markers using insertion polymorphisms of TEs showed distorted segregation in the RILs of Milyang23 (indica) × Gihobyeo (japonica). In contrast, when 190 F5 RILs were surveyed with the 150 SCARs, the segregation ratio of genotypes (EG4:Nipponbare) was 1:1.01 (16 356:16 502), indicating that segregation was not significantly distorted. While this can be attributed to the close relationship between EG4 and Nipponbare, it also demonstrates the reliability of mPing-SCAR markers. However, it should be noted that the frequency of genotypes of the 150 mPing-SCAR marker-loci (EG4:Nipponbare=16 356:16 502) was slightly lower than that of the 46 SSR marker loci (3943:3894). This may reflect mPing activity in the EG4 background, that is, some of the mPing elements may have excised.3.4 Genetic mapping of mPing-SCAR and SSR markersWe constructed a genetic map (with Mapmaker version 3.0) that included 150 mPing-SCAR markers and 46 SSR markers in all 12 linkage groups (Fig. 1; Table 2 and see Supplementary Table S1). The total length of the genetic map was 1771 cM with an average genetic distance between markers of 9.0 cM. The number of markers per chromosome ranged from 9 on chromosome 9 to 31 on chromosome 1, and the length of genetic region per chromosome was from 92.9 cM (chromosome 11) to 223 cM (chromosome 1) (Table 2). This result is consistent with the lengths of these chromosomes as determined by the International Rice Genome Sequencing Project (2005): chromosomes 1 through 3 are larger than chromosomes 9 through 11.46 Moreover, by comparing the genetic distances of mPing-SCAR markers with their physical locations (according to the annotated rice genome) (see Supplementary Table S1), we find that the genetic distances strongly correlate with physical distances, thus providing another indication of the accuracy of mPing-SCAR markers (Table 2; see Supplementary Table S1).The number of mapped markers and genetical distances on each chromosome in the RIL mapping populationsThe number of mapped markers and genetical distances on each chromosome in the RIL mapping populationsAs can be seen in Fig. 1, there are still chromosomal regions lacking markers (the short arm of chromosome 4), or with few markers (only two markers on the short arm of chromosome 9) (Fig. 1; see Supplementary Table S1). However, the upper half of chromosomes 4 and 9 including centromeres is known to be heterochromatic with low gene density (http://www.tigr.org/tdb/e2k1/osa1/).47–49 In addition, no SCAR markers were in centromeric, pericentromeric or telomeric regions, according to their physical positions in the annotated rice genome (see Supplementary Table S1). These facts strongly indicate that mPing-SCAR markers are enriched in euchromatic, gene-rich regions. As such, the lack of mPing markers in heterochromatic regions may not be a serious problem if gene discovery is the objective. However, a total of 926 insertion sites were already identified and some of them are located on such heterochromatic regions (Naito et al., unpublished data). Designing more primer sets to cover the whole genomic region is now underway.3.5 QTL analysis of the heading dateTo perform QTL analysis, days to heading of Nipponbare, EG4 and RIL populations were investigated in 2005 and 2007. The difference in days to heading was very small between these parental lines, with mean values for Nipponbare and EG4 of 98 and 103 days in 2005, and 102 and 104 days in 2007. However, the variation for days to heading of RILs showed transgressive segregation (range 93–111 days in 2005 and 99–110 days in 2007) and was continuous, suggesting a bimodal distribution (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S1). These results indicated that more than two loci with opposing effects were involved in the segregation of heading date in this cross. Both QTL analyses performed in 2005 and 2007 (with QTL chartographer) detected a single QTL peak (LOD score >8.5) on the short arm of chromosome 6. Significant threshold LOD values (P < 0.05) in the F5 populations (2005) and in the F7 populations (2007) were 2.9 and 3.71, respectively. This peak was located within a 847 kb region between MK6_2 (2 034 336 nt) and RM3414 (2 881 883 nt) (Fig. 4). The additive effects of the Nipponbare allele at this locus were −1.9 (2005) and −2.2 (2007) days, respectively.Histograms of days to heading in the F5 RIL populations.

Horizontal bars indicate the values of parental Nipponbare and EG4.QTL likelihood curve of the LOD score of the heading date on chromosome 6.QTL likelihood curve of the LOD score of the heading date on chromosome 6.Although some genes concerning heading date such as Hd3a and RFT1 have been identified on short arm of chromosome 6, they are located in the interval between markers RM3414 and MK6_3 according to their sequences15 which is apparently excluded from the QTL peak detected in this study (Fig. 4).Rather, this QTL locus fell into the same region of the recently identified locus Hd17.50Hd17 was mapped using backcrossed inbred lines derived from Nipponbare (japonica) x Koshihikari (japonica), and the Koshihikari allele at this locus was indicated to increase the days to heading compared with Nipponbare allele by a few days. The Gimbozu allele identified in our study has almost the same effect on heading date versus Nipponbare, indicating that this locus is also Hd17. This fact also indicates that mPing-SCAR markers established here are comparable to large scale analysis using SNP/SSR markers.In addition, it should be noted that classical genetic research had elucidated that the difference in flowering time between Gimbozu (including EG4) and Nipponbare is partly due to a flowering locus E2, with Gimbozu carrying an allele dominant (E2) to that of Nipponbare (e2).51 Koshihikari is also known to carry the dominant E2 allele.51 Thus, Gimbozu and Koshihikari probably have the same allele at this locus. Matsubara et al.50 suggested that the E2 locus corresponds to either Hd16 (between 32 855–33 966 kb on chromosome 3) or Hd17 (between 1964 and 2292 kb on chromosome 6). However, in the absence of information on chromosomal location, they were unable to determine which is the E2 locus. In this study, however, we detected one QTL overlapping Hd17 but none corresponding to Hd16. Taken together, we propose that Hd17 is the previously described E2 locus.52,53However, in 2005, we could not detect any other QTLs although the F5 RILs showed transgressive segregation in heading date. This might be because F5 populations should be segregating for traits, leading to disruption of data analysis. In fact, the analysis using F7 RIL populations in 2007 detected some minor QTL peaks (LOD > 3.71) on chromosomes 1, 2, 3 and 12 (Supplementary Figure S2). Alternatively, the minor QTLs are in involved in response to environmental cues other than day length, such as temperature because the average temperature during the growing season was higher in 2005 than in 2007. In 2005, there were 68 days with average temperature of 25°C or higher while there were only 55 days in 2007. To further identify minor QTL loci, plants may need to be grown in growth chambers that can strictly control the growth conditions.3.6 QTL analysis on culm lengthWe also conducted QTL analysis on culm length using 96 F7 RILs derived from Nipponbare and EG4. The average plant heights of EG4 and Nipponbare were 84 and 70 cm, respectively. The continuous and transgressive segregation was also detected, indicating involvement of more than two loci (Fig. 5). Two putative QTLs were detected on chromosomes 3 and 10 (Fig. 6A and B). The largest QTL (LOD score >9.5) was near mPing-SCAR marker MK3_13 and the other (LOD score >7.5) was near MK10_2. Significant threshold of LOD values (P < 0.05) was 3.14. The additive effects of these QTLs on plant height are −2.8 cm (chromosome 3, Nipponbare allele) and +2.4 cm (chromosome 10, Nipponbare allele). The transgressive segregation on the culm length can mainly be explained by these two loci, although minor QTL (LOD score >3.14) was also detected (near MK9_4 on chromosome 9) (data not shown). Interestingly, no genes or QTL associated with plant height have been previously reported in these QTL regions. Thus, the use of mPing-SCAR markers may have led to the detection of novel loci or alleles within japonica cultivars.Histograms of culm length in the F7 RIL populations.

Although Kwon et al.27 obtained 221 markers in total, not a few markers formed clusters and left many gaps of >30 cM as well. In contrast, we obtained 183 markers with no clusters and attained better coverage of genomic regions than ever. Especially, the Nipponbare and EG4 are closer than any other japonica/japonica cross combinations reported before. The ratio of polymorphisms in SSR markers between the two was only 7.0%, whereas 10% or higher frequency was obtained in most other combinations (See Table 1). Furthermore, mPing-SCAR markers allowed us to easily map the candidate loci in a very short time. For genotyping each marker, only 15 min electrophoresis in 1% agarose gel is required after PCR, which is apparently simpler and easier than any other molecular markers, such as SSR, SNP and RFLP.It should be emphasized that all characterized japonica varieties (other than EG4) have, like Nipponbare, ∼50 or fewer mPing copies.34,37 Thus, by crossing EG4 to other japonica varieties, linkage map construction and QTL analyses can easily be achieved. In this regard it is important to note the recent growing demand for rice with eating quality and the use of the japonica variety Koshihikari as a genetic resource in several molecular breeding projects.23,54 These studies should benefit from the addition of EG4 and mPing-SCAR markers to facilitate the identification of loci or genes controlling eating quality. The mPing-SCAR markers may also be valuable in uncovering genetic ‘treasures’ that remain hidden in the results of classical genetic studies pursued in Japan until 1990s. During that time japonica × japonica cross combinations were widely and vigorously undertaken to identify loci that co-segregate with unique phenotypes or traits. At present, 926 mPing insertion sites in the EG4 genome are identified (Naito et al., unpublished data). When mPing-SCAR markers of this number become available, the average distance among these markers will be estimated to be 402 kb [=372 090 kb/926markers (according to RAP-DB: http://rapdb.dna.affrc.gp.jp/)]. Considering the gene density of 1 gene/11.8 kb [=31 439 genes/372 090 kb (by RAP-DB)] in the rice genome, the estimated gene numbers between markers will be 31.4.Although the progress of next-generation sequencing techniques is remarkable today,55,56 only the sequence information of the whole genome is not enough to clone a gene responsible for a phenotype. However, delimiting candidate genes by ∼30 using mPing-SCAR markers would make it much more efficient to detect the target gene in combination with these sequencing techniques and well-developed database information. Once the candidate region is determined, the few sequence polymorphisms among japonica cultivars also make it far easier to clone the target gene. We are confident that the novel marker system developed in this study will dramatically save time, money and manpower in molecular breeding of rice.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThe study was funded by a grant from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan as Research Project Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research 1830005 and 17380003, and a plant genome grant from the National Science Foundation (to S.R.W.).We thank Qingbo Yuan for his technical assistance and encouragement.Supplementary data",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IntroductionRice (Oryza sativa L.) is one of the most important food crops in the world. It is the staple of diet for heavily populated Asian countries as well as many African countries in which overpopulation is becoming a critical issue. In spite of the successful introduction of resistance to biotic/abiotic stresses into a variety of rice cultivars that resulted in improved crop yield, benefits of the ‘green revolution’1 will soon be exhausted due to the population pressure. Recent progresses in the genomics of rice plant seem promising to speed up its breeding to yield further improved varieties in a shorter period of time. A major challenge in this technology, however, resides in the development of methodology to associate the genomic data with phenotypes of economical significance.The engine used for plant breeding is the selection of naturally occurring variants. Since the beginning of agriculture of rice initiated some 10 000 years ago, the traits of rice plant have been continuously improved through the introduction of naturally occurring beneficial alleles by spontaneous and/or artificial crossings. In the last century, systematic plant breeding theory based on modern Mendelian genetics was widely practiced. A limitation in this approach is that even though we can control the resultant phenotypes to a certain extent, mechanisms governing the genetic control of quantitative traits such as crop yield have been only poorly understood and exploited.Since the last decade, genetic dissection of ‘quantitative trait loci’ referred to as QTL has become a common approach, and has created a new paradigm in plant genetics. The notion emerged to understand the genetic basis of various ‘quantitative traits’ observed in cultivated plants such as crop yield that appeared to vary continuously among cultivars. Since such ‘quantitative traits’ are generally controlled by cooperatively acting genes of related functions, separate analysis of individual genes did not lead to successful characterization of the observed phenotypes. New methodology to categorically analyze the genetic loci involved in the phenotypes was thus necessary.In conjunction with the completion of the rice genome sequencing project,2 QTL analysis has become able to contribute to our understanding of natural variations in rice, thereby producing an enormous amount of information concerning their basis, such as chromosomal location of genes, allelic effects, epistatic interactions and so on. To date, however, such QTL information has not been fully exploited in rice breeding programs due largely to the nature of QTL analysis. Since it is based on statistical analysis, its reliability differs from one QTL analysis to another; in addition, information concerning the interactions with other genes and the effect of environmental conditions is hardly available. In this review, we examine recent progresses in rice QTL analysis, describe the outcomes and problems in its application to current rice breeding and discuss its possible implications toward the analysis of other crops as well as its future prospects.2. Genetic and molecular dissection of complex traits in rice2.1. Brief overview of QTL information through ‘Gramene QTL’Over the last decade, a large number of QTL have been generated using the linkage map constructed from DNA markers in the rice genome. The limited amount of information that anchors those different DNA marker used in different experiments makes it very difficult to compare the QTL generated by different researchers. In 2005, rice genome sequence has completely become available2 and the physical positions of numerous QTL could be determined based on the sequence information of flanking markers. This has permitted the development of a more comprehensive QTL database in rice.Gramene QTL3 is the most popular rice QTL database owing to its comprehensive collection of QTL information, which can be accessed on a genome browser. In April 2008, Gramene QTL annotated 8646 QTL, which were extracted from 247 reports published between 1994 and 2006. These QTL are categorized into nine trait categories (TCs) encompassing 237 characters as subordinate categories. Of the 237 characters, the one representing the largest number of QTL is plant height (categorized into the TC of ‘vigor’) with 1011 QTL, followed by ‘days to heading’ with 618 QTL (TC of ‘development’), 353 QTL for ‘spikelet number’ (TC of ‘yield’), 330 QTL for ‘spikelet fertility’ (TC of ‘sterility or fertility’) and 253 QTL for ‘panicle length’ (TC of anatomy). Of a total of 8646 QTL, the physical position of 6293 QTL (73%) was determined on specific chromosomes (Table 1). The remaining 27% of QTL could be positioned on the linkage map but not on the physical map mainly due to the lack of physical locations of flanking DNA markers. Twenty-five percent of QTL that have a physical position have been mapped to an interval of >1 Mb, owing to the small number of markers used in the analysis. Nearly 32% of QTL with a physical position could be mapped to an interval of <1 kb on specific chromosomes. Some of these locations should be viewed with caution because in some cases only one linked marker has been described in associated papers; therefore, these positions have not been precisely determined.The number of Gramene QTL classified into each trait categoryaMost data were estimated from only one flanking marker.bNo data for the physical position.The number of Gramene QTL classified into each trait categoryaMost data were estimated from only one flanking marker.bNo data for the physical position.A total of 4090 QTL in Gramene QTL are physically distributed unevenly on 12 chromosomes (Fig. 1). There is a tendency for a cluster of QTL to occur in particular chromosomal regions. For example, several hundred QTL including 95 QTL related to vigor has been mapped to specific chromosomal region of 40 Mb of chromosome 1. It is known that the sd1 (semi-dwarf 1) gene is located in this region4 and the variation of plant type originating from sd1 allelic differences may be detected by several QTL analyses. Similarly, many QTL for yield in the region of distal end of chromosome 1 may be detected by the action of Gn1a (Grain-number 1a).5 On the basis of the nature of QTL analysis, it is unavoidable at present to report QTL redundantly. Metric characters such as plant height can be readily measured and have been usually used for the characterization of characters in several QTL analyses. Therefore, it is often the case that different trait characters can be identified as QTL on the same region of a specific chromosome.The location of Gramene QTL on rice chromosomes.

This may be due to the limited number of trials (247 reports) and bias in plant cross-combination that has been used in the QTL analysis. In many different reports, the same populations of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) were used for the analysis of traits. This can generate QTL with unequal distribution on the chromosomes. Furthermore, some QTL have been putatively determined as loci exhibiting epistatic interactions with other loci or environmental factors. The reliability of these QTL cannot be evaluated simply by information provided by each report. This issue is discussed in more detail later in this review.In spite of the accumulated experience in QTL analysis and the relatively large number of QTL analyses performed so far, an overview of QTL information in the Gramene QTL database reveals that it may be premature to use some of that information in marker-assisted selection in rice breeding. In order to cross-reference QTL information in rice, researchers must pay much more attention to the designation of target traits, population size and the number of markers used in the analysis.2.2. Natural variations can be a target of molecular dissectionIn spite of the mixture of different levels of quality in QTL analyses, some of the QTL for morphological and physiological traits have been treated as a single Mendelian factor and cloned by using a map-based strategy (Table 2).6 These studies have also revealed the kinds of nucleotide changes involved in determining phenotypic differences. The cloning of causal genes/QTL for natural variations has allowed us to understand the genetic control mechanisms of naturally occurring complex variations. The clearest example is the analysis of flowering time, for which five QTL have been cloned: Hd1, Hd3a, Hd6, Ehd1 and Ghd7.7–11 Recently, Hd3a was found to act as a flowering promoter, florigen, which had been predicted previously but had not been proved.12 This series of studies has contributed to the description of a pathway of flowering time control in rice.13,14 As a result, this kind of scenario can be applied to other natural variations of agronomical interest. Recent progress in cloning causal genes involving major phenotypic change within natural variation, such as seed shattering, seed size and growth habit, has further elucidated the rice domestication process.11,15–19 For example, the qSH1 gene, a major QTL of seed shattering in rice, encodes a BEL-type homeodomain and a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) has been detected in this gene.15 This SNP, lying in the 5′ regulatory region of qSH1, generates a phenotype characterized by the loss of seed shattering. Furthermore, based on the analysis of several old landraces of Chinese and Japanese rice, this SNP might have arisen during the domestication process. It was demonstrated that a deletion of ∼1 kb has been a key event in changing from small to large seed during the japonica rice domestication process.19 It was also demonstrated that gene duplication and divergence in the Sub1 locus, which is involved in submergence tolerance, also have occurred both prior to and after rice domestication.20 Consequently, the accumulation of several domestication signatures among current and old rice accessions permitted the establishment of a model of the japonica rice domestication process.21QTLs with major effects on agronomic traits in riceaNo. of plants used in large-scale linkage mapping.bPhysical distance of candidate genomic region defined by mapping.cFunctional nucleotide polymorphism causing alleleic difference between parental lines.QTLs with major effects on agronomic traits in riceaNo. of plants used in large-scale linkage mapping.bPhysical distance of candidate genomic region defined by mapping.cFunctional nucleotide polymorphism causing alleleic difference between parental lines.3. Questions in the genetic dissection of natural variation3.1. How do we quantitatively score phenotype?Some morphologically distinguishable quantitative traits, such as grain weight, days to heading or plant height, have been evaluated by QTL analysis, but it is sometimes difficult to characterize the phenotype of economically important traits. A typical example is the genetic analysis of yield potential, which is one of the most important traits in agriculture. Rice yield—the total amount of grain harvested—is broadly divided into two quantifiable components, source potential and sink size.22 Both of these traits must be determined to characterize the yield potential, but progress on the genetic analysis of source potential is far behind that of sink size.5,18,19,21 Since source potential, such as leaf photosynthesis or translocation, is physiological traits, scoring them is time-consuming, laborious and likely to be influenced by environmental conditions. Therefore, these traits are still not applicable to QTL analysis, which needs to score large numbers of segregated progeny at the same growth stage.As another example, general growth habits such as culm length, panicle number, fertility ratio or dry matter weight each measured under drought stress conditions are often used as an index of the degree of drought resistance.23–27 Chromosomal locations of these QTL occasionally overlap with the previously reported QTL for growth habits such as ‘days to heading’ (flowering time) or ‘culm length’ examined under normal conditions. We may detect only a QTL of drought avoidance even though we hope to find a QTL involving drought tolerance. So far, crop physiologists and geneticists have attempted to evaluate drought tolerance by measuring root morphology,28,29 but this might be a part of key factors in the trait in preventing drought stress. Scoring the phenotypic differences of non-morphological traits is a crucial issue for QTL analysis. Recent progress in plant physiology and biochemistry concurrently with the development of novel analytical tools will facilitate the investigation of target traits (see section 4.3).3.2. QTL that have minor effects remain poorly investigatedQTL associated with complex traits have been identified and have already delivered crucial information to aid our understanding of natural variations. In general, a large number of QTL have been detected mainly by using primary mapping populations such as F2, RILs or backcross inbred lines (BILs). One of the major questions in QTL analysis is whether we can detect all QTL including those with minor effects. On the basis of the statistical nature of QTL analysis, some bias in the results are expected due to ‘noise’ inherent in the complex biological and environmental systems involved. We must consider that QTL associated with minor effects might not be detected in the analysis using primary mapping populations (false negatives). In addition, we must also recognize and define false positives.The QTL analysis of ‘heading date’ is a good example of the difficulty of identifying QTL with minor effects. In primary QTL analysis using F2 populations between two varieties, ‘Nipponbare’ and ‘Kasalath’, five QTL have been detected.30 Further analysis using backcrossed progeny derived from the same cross-combination revealed at least 10 additional QTL.31 Some of these QTL are found to be masked by the QTL with relatively large phenotypic effects or an epistatic interaction.32,33 The trait of ‘spikelet number per panicle’ is another example. Nagata et al.34 estimated that 4 QTL controlled the number of ‘spikelet per panicle’ by using BILs derived from the cross between ‘Sasanishiki’ as a recurrent and ‘Habataki’ as a donor. Since then, Ando et al.35 have developed chromosomal segment substitution lines (CSSLs), which are a series of lines covering entire chromosomal regions of ‘Habataki’ dividing it into small segments but on the genetic background of ‘Sasanishiki’. They identified not only the same 4 QTL but also an additional 12 QTL with relatively small phenotypic effect. One of the common QTL located on chromosome 1 may correspond with Gn1a,5 but this did not fully explain the phenotypic difference between the parents. This example clearly demonstrates the importance of finding QTL with small effect to understand the genetic basis of spikelet number.3.3. Epistatic and environmental interactions: easy to estimate but hard to confirmTo thoroughly understand the genetic control of complex traits, the important issues to be clarified are the epistatic interaction among the genes involved [genotype by genotype (G × G) interaction] and the interaction between gene expression and environmental conditions [environmental (G × E) interaction]. Statistical analyses such as two-way ANOVA and multiple regressions have been often used to reveal G × G interactions mainly on yield-related traits including heterosis, by using primary mapping populations.28,36–46 These analyses undoubtedly have provided a clue to understand the complex nature of genetic control mechanisms. Note that very few of the indications of such interactions have been proved by further analysis. It has been sometimes reported that a large number of epistatic interaction pairs distributed whole genome were observed. For example, 195 and 328 digenic interactions were detected in the indica/japonica and indica/indica combinations, respectively.47 Although some of these interactions may be important, it is possible that many false positives are also being included. In general, 100–300 plants or lines have been used in most of the QTL analyses reported. So is the presence of false positives caused by the bias inherent in a small population size, by experimental errors in phenotyping or by some other cause? How do we define a real digenic interaction? This may be particularly true in the case of interaction involving more than three loci. A large primary mapping population (e.g. >500) may be required to avoid the generation of false positives. Again, note that it is very hard to distinguish between real interactions and experimental noise in statistical analysis.Meanwhile, estimation of the G × E interaction needs to be clarified in order to use in a breeding program significant alleles revealed by QTL analysis. G × E is frequently evaluated by year–year and/or location–location variations using mapping populations that are available for replication, such as doubled haploid lines (DHLs), RILs or BILs. Since an indirect methodology of QTL mapping with a ‘QTL by environment’ (QE) interaction was proposed,48 many examples of chromosomal regions involving G × E have been reported for rice.43,49,50 The Gramene QTL database3 handles all locations detected with interaction effects as independent QTL. The largest entry contains 611 QTL information sources,43 which may imply that some epistatic pairs are possibly false positives. To minimize the risk of such false positives, rigorous statistical conditions using repetitive experiments in one environment should be employed in the experimental design.513.4. A proposal: confirmation is more important than estimationAbove we have pointed out that there are three problems that must be solved for a better understanding of the genetic dissection of natural variation in rice: (i) trait evaluation; (ii) detection of minor QTL and (iii) G × G and G × E interactions. On the basis of the nature of the analytical methods including the statistics used in QTL mapping of primary populations, it might be difficult to solve these problems. One practical solution is to design and develop plant materials with a uniform genetic background for validation of the results obtained in the primary analysis. Basically, advanced backcross progeny would be used to prove the genetic effect of major QTL.52 This type of validation of a genetic effect can be performed on QTL with minor effects. The use of CSSLs, single-segment substitution lines (SSSLs) or introgression lines (ILs) will be a practical solution for trait evaluation and detection of minor QTL.35,53–57 As described in section 3.2, Ando et al.35 demonstrated the power of CSSLs to find QTL that have a minor effect. However, CSSLs cannot estimate candidate pairs of G × G interactions because they do not have enough genotype combinations for any two loci. To overcome this disadvantage, the combined use of a primary population (F2s, RILs, DHLs) and a backcrossed population (CSSLs, SSSLs, ILs) is recommended. Successful proof should be obtained by evaluation of the phenotypic difference of both near-isogenic lines (NILs) of the QTL and their combined line after estimations of G × G by primary population.58,59 Because CSSLs or ILs normally have one chromosomal region substituted in the recurrent genetic background, they can be used as NILs themselves or as starting material to develop NILs. These types of plant materials are particularly useful to discriminate between real QTL and false positives, and to prove G × E interactions.60–62Figure 2 illustrates the roles of a primary population, such as F2 or RIL, and a backcrossed population, such as CSSL or NIL. Putative QTL, G × E and G × G interactions are statistically estimated from a primary population. These QTL can be validated based on phenotypic differences between the recurrent parent and the CSSL whose substitution segment corresponds with the detected QTL region in the primary analysis. Moreover, G × E or G × G interactions can be validated by evaluation of phenotypic performance of the CSSLs. Finally, the information integrated from these analyses allows us to proceed to further studies, such as map-based cloning for biological characteristics or marker-assisted breeding. We are developing several kinds of CSSLs on the japonica rice genetic background; we select donor cultivars based on their geographical distribution in the world. Although the process of development is laborious and time-consuming, the resulting CSSLs will contribute to exploration of new economically important alleles as well as clarifying genetic control of natural variation.Scheme for the use of primary and backcrossed populations to investigate genetically complex traits in rice. (A) Two kinds of experimental populations—primary populations such as RILs and backcrossed population such as CSSLs—can be developed by crossing between a donor parent (P1) with trait of interest and a recurrent parent (P2) such as a representative cultivar. (B) Putative QTL, genotype by environmental interaction (G × E) or genotype by genotype (epistatic) interaction (G × G) are statistically estimated by QTL analysis of primary population. (C) A series of CSSL contribute to validation of the estimated QTL, G × E interaction (C1), G × G interaction (C2) and to fine mapping of the QTL followed by marker-assisted breeding and gene isolation (C3).Scheme for the use of primary and backcrossed populations to investigate genetically complex traits in rice.

In the case of flowering time, which is one of the most successfully advanced traits in rice quantitative genetics, knowledge of the identified QTL is being integrated in order to construct the relevant gene network.13,14 Map-based cloning of the QTL is currently becoming one of the standard strategies as a first step of this kind of work. Application of the developed CSSLs will provide a route to accelerate this process.4. Rice QTL for practical use4.1. Rice varieties developed by marker assisted selectionOnce the genes controlling traits with economical and agricultural interest have been identified, there will be opportunities to utilize the resulting information such as the DNA sequence and chromosomal location of these genes in breeding programs. Since the paradigm of marker-assisted-selection (MAS) has emerged, a great deal of effort has been invested in the practice of MAS. Several examples have already been reported for the development of NILs with particular traits in elite rice varieties. For example, submergence by deep water causes severe stress to rice in south-east Asia, where flooding occurs during the monsoon season. A major QTL, Submergence 1 (Sub1), was detected near the centromere of chromosome 9 and was eventually cloned (Table 2).63,64 When the Sub1A allele was introgressed by MAS into an elite cultivar widely grown in Asia, the resultant lines showed promising agronomic performance in yield and other agronomic traits, as well as tolerance to submergence.65,66 Heading date is an example where a series of NILs with different heading dates were developed in the genetic background of an elite cultivar, ‘Koshihikari’, in Japan.67 In these cases, relatively small chromosome segments (∼600 kb) were introduced by MAS. A further example is insect resistance, one of QTL controlling brown plant hopper resistance, which has been identified in a wild relative of rice, Oryza officinalis. This QTL has been introduced into the elite Japanese cultivar, ‘Hinohikari’, by MAS (Hirabayashi et al., unpublished data). In these MAS, it is necessary not only to perform background selection by DNA markers distributed in non-target chromosomal regions, but the size of the introgressed chromosome segment should be minimized to avoid unfavorable trait association (linkage drag). To accelerate the effectiveness of MAS, the precise map location of target QTL must be determined and several flanking markers developed.MAS also offers a new concept in plant breeding. Once NILs representing a particular trait of economic value are independently developed, gene pyramiding can be performed by simple crossing between such NILs.68 In order to develop a new line with lodging resistance and high yield, the combination of two genes controlling the characteristics, ‘semi-dwarf’ and ‘number of grain’ was successfully introduced into ‘Koshihikari’.5 This concept can also be applied to multiple genes controlling specific traits. Four QTL derived from upland rice, control a partial resistance to rice blast and have been successfully pyramidized into lowland rice cultivars by MAS (Fukuoka et al., unpublished data).4.2. Genetic dissection of natural variations observed among closely related cultivarsIn general, performance in QTL analysis and map-based cloning is strongly dependent on sequence difference between two parental lines. In fact, most of the QTL listed in Table 2 have been detected and cloned by using distant crosses, such as indica and japonica. On the other hand, there is considerable phenotypic variation between japonica cultivars.69,70 These variations between closely related cultivars have often been major targets for selection in rice breeding programs. This is particularly true in the breeding of cultivars adapted to regional environmental conditions. As a result, these natural variations are important targets for genetic and molecular dissection. Given this, it has been difficult to detect and clone QTL controlling variations among closely related cultivars, owing to the lack of informative DNA markers. The completion of whole-genome sequencing has dramatically changed this situation. It has allowed us to identify effectively microsatellite motifs and convert them to simple sequence repeats (SSR) markers.2 This situation has allowed us to perform mapping of QTL using progeny derived from a cross between genetically closely related cultivars. Fujino et al.71 cloned the QTL qLTG3-1 for low temperature germinabilty using progeny between temperate japonica crosses. This is the first example of the molecular cloning of genes identified between genetically related cultivars. Recently, the use of SSR markers facilitated the detection of QTL with complex inheritance. For example, QTL controlling grain quality72,73 and eating quality (preference)74–76 among temperate japonica rice have been effectively detected by the combination of SSR genotyping and phenotyping of their RILs. Again, these phenotypic differences are current targets in rice breeding in Japan. Therefore, these techniques of genetic dissection and eventually molecular dissection will contribute not only to the understanding of genetic control of those traits, but will also facilitate MAS in rice breeding.4.3. Impact of technological innovationIn the genetic dissection of natural variations, novel and effective genotyping and phenotyping need to be employed. For genotyping, recent innovations in sequencing technology have enabled us to perform sequence analysis on a massive scale.77,78 This so-called next-generation sequencing technology has opened new opportunities for polymorphism discovery in the rice genome.79 In Arabidopsis, this system has been applied to two natural accessions to perform genome-wide SNP and InDel discovery.80 This method is expected to provide unique opportunities to identify nucleotide polymorphisms between genetically closely related strains, such as Japanese cultivars. Furthermore, the simultaneous genotyping thousands of SNPs on a genome-wide scale has also been recently developed.81 The combination of these two technologies has facilitated genetic dissection of complex traits by QTL mapping and whole-genome association studies. So far, most QTL that have been identified are morphological traits, such as heading date, plant height, seed size, grain number and so on, which can be scored easily. Identification of novel QTL depends on the application of novel phenotyping methods. To further mine natural variations in rice, phenotypic performance should be measured by different and unique methods. Recently, several studies revealed that allelic differences at QTL are the result of subtle variations in the activity of plant hormones such as gibberellic acid and cytokinin in particular tissues. These variations affect plant height and seed number, which contribute to yield performance4,5 Of particular interest will be an understanding of the genetic factors involved in causing these variations in the levels of plant hormones. Recently, simultaneous surveys of different plant hormones and their derivatives have been established.82 Therefore, quantitative variations in a series of plant hormones can be a direct target for QTL analysis. In addition, recent progress with a high throughput monitoring system allowed us to reveal naturally occurring variations in metabolite profiles in plant and this approach could also be a target for QTL mapping in Arabidopsis and tomato.83,84 In rice, a core collection has been subjected to metabolite profiling: metabolite levels in seed between accessions varies considerably.85,86 Therefore, genetic dissection by QTL analysis can be ap",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lied to the rice metabolite profiles. This approach will provide a unique opportunity to understand more thoroughly naturally occurring variation and to improve rice cultivars.5. How rice QTL contribute to functional analysis of genes in other cerealsConservation and colinearity in genome structure in cereals have been recognized for nearly 20 years. Using genetic markers, such as restriction fragment length polymorphism markers, syntenic correspondence of chromosomal regions between wheat, barley and rice has been identified.87–89 Devos and Gale90 established the cereal genome circle, which clearly illustrates the ancestral genome and the evolutional relationship of chromosomal regions between cereals. In this regard, the genome sequence of rice has contributed greatly to the structural and functional analysis of the genomes of other cereals. As the amount of information on the genes and QTL associated with natural variations has increased for rice, a critical question is whether this information can be transferred to the analysis of gene function in other cereals. Since the map location of many QTL has been determined in rice and other cereals, several studies have predicted orthologous relationships among corresponding genes in other species.91,92 However, few proofs of these relationships that have been published so far. One case in particular is the analysis of flowering time in cereals. Comparative QTL studies in cereals have advanced using the knowledge we have accumulated in rice and in the highly studied Arabidopsis plant.93–95 QTL cloning of rice has enhanced our capacity to find candidate ortholog genes in other cereals. Comparative QTL studies for forage grasses will present technical challenges because of their large genome size and the difficulty of molecular dissection due to their allogamous nature. The QTL for flowering time, disease resistance and sterility could be targets of comparative QTL studies.96,97 As yet, there is no clear evidence that such a scenario of gene discovery can be extended to traits with agricultural importance, such as yield performance, environmental stress tolerance and other morphological characteristics of agronomical interest. Despite a large number of studies on complex traits of agronomical importance, very limited numbers of genes have been identified at the molecular level. Once we have the sequence of target QTL in rice, then this information can be transferred to other cereals by identifying and cloning their orthologs. Then comparative studies, such as linkage mapping of those genes and confirmation of co-localization of putative QTL of interest in other cereals, can be performed. The existing approximate chromosomal location of rice QTL can provide a pointer toward a syntenic relationship with corresponding target traits in other species, but further study cannot be done until each relevant QTL is mapped and cloned. In addition, phenotypic traits of agronomical importance such as yield performance and environmental stress tolerance are controlled by a complex network of multiple genes. Therefore, it is not necessary to share the same genes to generate natural variations. In fact, since Hd1, the rice ortholog of the Arabidopsis CONSTANS (CO) gene, has been isolated as a major QTL controlling heading date,7 several studies have been performed to characterize the CO/Hd1 ortholog relationship in other cereals such as wheat, barley and maize.98–100 These studies demonstrate that the ortholog of CO in these cereals might be involved in genetic control of photoperiodic flowering. Interestingly, no clear evidence has been demonstrated to prove that such orthologs are involved in natural variations in flowering time in these species. This may imply that conservation in genetic control mechanisms of particular traits does not necessarily imply conservation in the contribution of orthologs to generate natural variation between cereals.Although there is a strong potential contribution, it may be premature to apply rice QTL information to the comparative analysis of gene function of cereals. To make comparative analysis most effective, more comprehensive understanding of rice complex traits and the identification of genes involved in natural variations of agronomical importance must be achieved.6. ConclusionsRemarkable progress has been achieved in the genetic and molecular dissection of naturally occurring variations in the last decade. Several QTL with major effects have been introgressed into modern rice cultivars by MAS. In addition, some of the QTL involved in sink size and plant statue have been already cloned; therefore, it is expected that these findings will increase the probability of modulating and enhancing cloned genes at the molecular level, thereby increasing yield potential. However, natural variations generated by these major QTLs have already often been recognized and properly utilized by breeders in conventional breeding. It will be necessary to discover new alleles for the improvement of current rice cultivars. In general, traits with relevance to rice breeding, such as yield performance and stress tolerance, have been found to be controlled by minor QTL. We propose that the major research focus in this area should be in the unused and unrecognized variations that have occurred after domestication. QTL with minor effects are often hidden by a large phenotypic variation of major QTL. This may be due not only to the complexity of genetic control but also to the reliability of the evaluation of phenotype. In order to overcome these difficulties, it will be necessary to design and develop appropriate plant materials and to apply phenotyping methods with high reliability. Furthermore, genome-wide genotyping using SNP typing arrays should provide a more robust analytical method to analyze such complex traits. Therefore, the integration of all resources, such as the tools and analytical methods already discussed and plant materials, will be necessary to facilitate further dissection of the complex traits of agricultural importance. We have made considerable progress already, but it is essentially the starting point for a deeper understanding of naturally occurring variations and their utilization in rice breeding.FundingWork in QTL-GRS is mainly supported by funds (Integrated Research Project for Plant, Insect and Animals using Genome Technology and Genomics for Agricultural Innovation) from the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries," Japan.We thank members of the QTL Genomics Research Center (QTL-GRS) at NIAS for helpful discussions and suggestions in the preparation of this manuscript.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IntroductionAlternative splicing (AS) is a mechanism by which multiple forms of mature mRNAs are generated from a single pre-mature mRNA. The most recent genome-wide analysis of AS events in Arabidopsis thaliana found that >4700 transcribed pre-mature mRNAs were alternatively spliced.1 The number of known AS events in Arabidopsis has recently been increasing. AS events are important because they diversify the proteome. The impacts of AS events on the human transcriptome and proteome are also well known. In humans, ∼70% of all genes are thought to be alternatively spliced.2,3 It is thought that many kinds of proteins are translated from the limited number of genes encoded by the human genome. Compared with humans, there are fewer known AS events in plants. AS events in Arabidopsis occur in around 20% of all known genes.1 Although the number of AS events is small, some important AS events have been described in Arabidopsis. For example, the floral promoter FCA, disease resistance protein RPS4 and splicing factor atRSZ33 are known to undergo AS.4–6AS events are not only important sources for the diversification of the proteome, but they also have an important role in post-transcriptional regulation. In a previous study, we reported that the pattern of AS events on a genome-wide scale (called AS profiles) was affected by stress conditions and tissue types, especially by cold stress.7 In a full-length cDNA library from cold-treated plants, cassette exons tend to be selected in mature mRNAs, and introns tend to be retained. Several recent studies have also found that stresses and/or tissue types affect the selectivity of AS events.8–10Recently, several novel technologies have been established, which have improved our ability to study the transcriptome. For studying AS events on a genome-wide scale, a microarray approach, with probes designed for each exon11 or covering the whole genome,2,3 may prove useful. However, it is difficult to elucidate the entire sequence of AS variants with these methods. The best way to analyze the exact AS events for every transcript is still to make libraries of full-length cDNAs and sequence them. In 2004, we found 2092 AS events after analyzing ∼278 000 sequences from full-length cDNAs.7,12,13 However, most of these sequences were partial reads from 5′ or 3′ regions of the full-length cDNAs. Because our previous studies tended to analyze AS events in terminal regions, we could not address impacts of these AS events on the full-length sequences and their coding potentials. In the current study, we chose 1800 cDNAs that had AS events or transcriptional start sites (TSSs) in their 5′/3′ sequences, and sequenced them entirely. On the basis of these novel full-length cDNA sequences, we determined how many AS events occurred in each gene, how multiple AS events within a single gene affected each other and how AS events affected coding potentials.2. Materials and methods2.1. Selecting the full-length cDNAs for determination of the full-length sequencesWe used clones from the RIKEN Arabidopsis full-length (RAFL) cDNA libraries.12,13 We classified the fully and partially read RAFL cDNA sequences based on their locations in the genome, AS events and TSSs. As a first step, we constructed transcription units (TUs) based on locations of the sequences in the genome.7 Next, we checked for the existence of AS events, which were classified as exon skip (ES), alternative donor (AD), alternative acceptor (AA) or retained intron (RI) for each TU. A set of sequences, which did not have any AS events, was classified into an AS group. In some cases, a pair of transcripts in a particular TU lacked overlapping exons. In these cases, although no AS events were found, we classified these two transcripts into different AS groups.Finally, we checked the TSSs for each AS group. If a pair of the 5′ end read sequences or fully read sequences had TSSs with differences in length of >500 bp, we separated them into two different TSS groups. As a result, each transcript was classified into a group based on TU, AS and TSS. If a group lacked fully read transcripts, we chose one clone from this group as a target for determination of the full-length sequences.2.2. End and full-length sequencingPlasmid DNA extraction was performed using an automated DNA isolation system (PI-1100, Kurabo), and end sequencing of the 1800 clones was performed with BigDye terminator ver.3 sequencing kits and ABI 3730 automated capillary DNA sequencers (Applied Biosystems). For full-length sequencing, template DNA was individually prepared from each plasmid DNA using the rolling-circle amplification (RCA) method (TempliPhi DNA amplification kit, GE Healthcare). A pooled sample, consisting of 768 RCA products, was subjected to shotgun sequencing (ABI 3730). Another pooled sample (1032 RCA products) was sequenced using a Genome Sequencer 20 System (454 Life Sciences/Roche). The generated contig sequences were then incorporated into the end sequence data using the Phrap/Consed system.14 Primer walking was used to close gaps and re-sequence low-quality regions of the assembled data. The reconstructed cDNA sequences were completely covered by the Sanger reads. All sequences, excluding 55 sequences that were not mapped to the genome, were submitted to the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) under the accession numbers AK316663–AK317782 and AK318618–AK319175.2.3. Classification of transcripts as known or novelAll novel sequences were mapped to the genome sequence with BLAST and GeneSeqer15,16 using a previously described method.17 Next, the transcripts were classified as known or novel transcripts based on comparisons with annotated gene models. In addition to the four types of AS events (ES, AD, AA and RI), to make a detailed classification of known and novel transcripts, we also checked for alternative structure events, in which transcriptional initiation or termination occurred within the introns of other transcripts (AI and AT). Unlike the method in Section 2.1, we ignored TSS differences in this step, even if those differences were more than 500 bases, because differences found in TSSs could have occurred during the sequencing of potential partial cDNAs.For transcript classification, we used novel sequences and annotated gene model in The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR), version 7,18 which corresponded with the novel sequences. For these sequences, TU clustering and AS-group clustering were performed again, using a method similar to that described in Section 2.1. Every result was checked manually after the computational classification.2.4. Analysis of the number of AS events per geneTo analyze the number of AS events per gene, we chose annotated gene loci with AS variants from TAIR. For the data set in the current study, we used novel sequenced transcripts and the annotated gene models, which were derived from corresponding loci with novel sequences. In this analysis, the number of AS events from each of the four types (ES, AD, AA and RI) was counted. The number of AS events was defined based on the type of AS event and the region affected by the AS event. We noted special cases of splice acceptors with more than three acceptor sites. In a case of an intron of three possible splice acceptor sites, two AS events were counted. One event was defined by the region affected between the first and the second acceptor sites, and the second event by the region between the second and third acceptor sites. If we had defined the AS events based on the combination of acceptor sites of the AS variant, there would have been three events. Therefore, the number of AS events would have increased dramatically due to the increased number of acceptor sites. The new method avoided this great increase in event numbers. There was also a similar rule about multiple AD sites. We compared the number of AS events found in each gene using a Mann–Whitney test and used R package (http://cran.r-project.org/) to calculate the P-values.2.5. Analysis of the AS event combination patternsIn cases of transcripts with more than two AS events, we analyzed the pattern of AS combinations. For these analyses, we sorted AS events that were found in a transcript by the order of their locations. Then, we paired adjacent AS events according to their orders (i.e. first and second, second and third and so forth). Expectation values of each of the AS event combination patterns were calculated based on the probability of a single AS event. Statistical analyses were performed using binomial tests. We also used R package to calculate the P-values.AS events could be classified based on their directions. We called AS events that made longer mRNAs ‘in-type’ events, which means regions affected by AS were included in the mRNAs. In the opposite cases, we called AS events that made shorter mRNAs ‘out-type’ events. We classified all the AS events as in- or out-type. Then, we counted the number of combinations for either the in- or out-types from adjacent AS events. Statistical analysis was performed using a chi-squared test with R package.2.6. Prediction of coding sequences and analysis of the effects of as events on functional motifsWhen transcripts were classified into known TUs, we determined their coding sequences (CDSs) based on their corresponding genes. For novel transcripts, we performed BLASTX searches against the annotated protein sequences encoded in mRNAs from the corresponding loci of TAIR.15 From the result, we determined the core CDSs and phases, and then extended the CDS to its up- and downstream regions until we found the farthest initial codons and the nearest termination codons. The results were checked manually after the computational prediction. For transcripts classified as novel TUs, we searched CDSs based on a BLASTX search results using all protein sequences in TAIR's database (ftp://ftp.arabidopsis.org).To assess the impact of AS events on the encoded protein sequences, we performed motif search analyses for the protein sequences encoded by the novel AS variants and corresponding annotated gene model. In this case, we selected the most similar protein sequences generated from the corresponding loci that were used as reference sequences. The motif search was performed with Pfam.193. Results and discussion3.1. Full sequencing of 1800 full-length cDNAsWe determined the full-length sequences of 1800 RAFL cDNAs; 1657 reads (92%) had clear poly-A tails. The average length was 1495 nt, and the GC content was 42.9%. These features were quite similar to our previous sets of full-length cDNAs (average lengths were 1483 nt and GC contents were 42.8%).12,13 We mapped the transcripts with BLAST and GeneSequer.15,16 A total of 1745 transcripts were mapped to the Arabidopsis genome. We could not find the corresponding loci for the other 55 transcripts (Fig. 1).Flowchart and outline of the classifications used for current data set (upper part) and AS events found in the novel AS variants (lower part).

And 342 AS events were novel ones found in the current study.3.2. Classification of transcripts as known or novelOut of the 1745 mapped transcripts, three lacked corresponding annotated genes in TAIR. They were classified as novel TUs. Another 14 transcripts were chimeric transcripts that were produced from two adjacent genes. In humans, a large number of such chimeric transcripts have been reported.3,20,21 The current data set also showed that Arabidopsis had some chimeric transcripts. A total of 1129 transcripts had corresponding gene models in the annotated gene set (Fig. 1, Supplementary Table S1). Six transcripts had additional exons compared with the annotated gene models in TAIR. The remaining 597 transcripts had novel AS events and/or alternative structure variants (as a whole we called them AS variants). Out of them, 572 transcripts contained novel AS events that had been unknown. The others were AS variants that consisted of novel combinations of known AS events. In addition to these 597 novel AS variants, four chimeric transcripts had novel exon–intron structures in comparison with annotated ones. In total, 601 transcripts were classified as novel alternatively spliced/structure variant transcripts (Fig. 1, Supplementary Table S2). AS events found in the 601 transcripts were summarized in Table 1. We checked relative frequencies of each AS event within all AS events found in the novel transcripts and the novel AS events only within the transcripts. In both cases, the frequencies of AS events were similar to the previous studies;1 RI events were the most abundant ones and AA events were the next.The results of AS and alternative structure event predictionaRI, retained intron; AA, alternative acceptor; ES, exon skip; AD, alternative donor; AI, alternative initiation of transcription; AT, alternative termination of transcription.

AI and AT, the alternative structure events were checked for the classification of the transcripts.3.3. Analysis of the number of AS events per geneSix hundred and one genes were classified as novel AS variants, which was unexpected because we chose full-length cDNA clones that already had AS events in their sequenced 5′/3′ regions. These 5′/3′ sequences and AS events have already been registered to the GenBank database.7,12,13 Since the TAIR group makes efforts to continuously update the gene models, including the AS information,18 it was expected that the AS events in previously sequenced regions would have been included in TAIR's annotation and classified as known AS events. Thus, we thought that the 601 novel AS variants must contain additional AS events in their novel sequence regions. We compared the regions containing the AS events with the regions that were sequenced previously (as 5′/3′ sequences). Out of the 980 AS events without corresponding events in TAIR, 638 AS events were present in the previous 5′/3′ sequences (Fig. 1, Supplementary Table S2). We concluded that the main reason why we found so many novel AS events was that some of the AS events found in the previous 5′/3′ sequences were not reflected in TAIR's annotation. It might be due to TAIR's policy in the database update to exclude alternatively spliced mRNAs with premature termination codons.18Despite that we found many AS events corresponded with the previously sequenced partial sequences, we still found 342 novel AS events in the newly sequenced regions. This result showed that transcripts with AS events tended to have additional AS events in other positions, suggesting that the number of AS events in a single gene should be much greater than what is currently known. Next, we compared the number of AS events per gene between the current data set and TAIR. The average number of AS events per gene was found to be 2.0 in the TUs that corresponded to the current transcripts. On the other hand, it was 1.4 for the genes that had more than two mature mRNA structures in TAIR's annotation. In the current data set, a higher fraction of genes had more than two AS events compared with the genes in TAIR's data set (Supplementary Fig. S1). These differences were statistically significant (P < 2.2E−16) with a Mann–Whitney test. Therefore, we concluded that Arabidopsis genes should have more AS events per gene. In the current analysis, a further sequencing effort showed many more AS events in Arabidopsis. This finding was consistent with a previous report, in which the frequency of AS events is correlated with the abundance of EST/full-length sequences.22 Further sequencing should show that more AS events occur in Arabidopsis.3.4. Analysis of the pattern of AS event combinations in each geneIn the current study of AS events, specific patterns of AS event combinations preferentially occurred. To confirm this result, we focused on transcripts that had more than two AS events. Among the cDNAs characterized in this study, 354 transcripts had more than two AS events. The number of combinations between adjacent AS events was examined and compared with expectation values that were calculated from the frequencies of every AS event type found in the 354 transcripts (Table 2). The frequencies of the individual AS event types were similar between the 601 novel AS variants and the 354 AS variants with multiple AS events (Tables 1 and 2). The four combinations (AD–ES, AD–AA, ES–ES and ES–AA) were observed more frequently than expected, which was statistically significant (P < 0.01 in a binomial test; Table 2). The combination of RI–RI was also observed more frequently than expected, although this was not statistically significant (P = 0.106 in a binomial test). The prominence of these five combinations suggests the following two models for AS patterns: combinations of AD–ES (0∼12 times)–AA and multiple repeats of RI (2∼8 times) events. Out of our 601 novel AS variants, the former model was found in 80 transcripts and the latter was found in 125 transcripts (examples in Fig. 2). In a previous study, Wang and Brendel1 analyzed AS events in Arabidopsis and rice and concluded that most AS events were mutually independent. The reason why their conclusions and ours were different might be due to that we analyzed the sequences of full-length cDNAs in the current studies, whereas Wang and Brendel treated the data sets including a vast amount of partial read sequences. Analysis of full-length cDNAs showed possibilities that some AS events in a transcript were related each other.Examples of multiple occurrences of AS events. (A) The AT2G02910 locus which encodes a predicted hydrolase that acts on carbon–nitrogen bonds. The transcript (MAS-001G06) retains introns 1, 2, 5 and 8 compared with AT2G02910.1. (B) The AT3G07300 locus which encodes a protein from the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B family. The transcript (MAS-004E14) shows an AD, two ES and an AA AS events. All four of these events were of the ‘out-type’.Examples of multiple occurrences of AS events. (A) The AT2G02910 locus which encodes a predicted hydrolase that acts on carbon–nitrogen bonds.

Calculated based on the frequencies of independent events. Case number is the observation number: 788.cResults of the binomial test. P-values are shown if the observation values are greater than the expectation values.It should be noted that 26 out of 125 transcripts with multiple RI events consisted of single exons. Most of these transcripts seemed to be mature mRNAs, because 21 out of 26 had clear poly-A tails. However, it was still possible that these transcripts without intron splicing were immature mRNAs, and therefore they were excluded. In this case, the probability of RI events was 0.40. As a result, the number of RI–RI combinations was 157, which was still greater than the expectation value (114.9). Fig. 2B shows an example of a combination pattern in which multiple, but not all, introns were retained in a single transcript. Thus, the model of multiple repeats of RI events was also enriched in the current data set.We also classified the AS events by their direction, as in- and out-type events (see Section 2 for details). The direction of AS events showed that for two adjacent AS events, a single direction was preferable (Supplementary Table S3). This was clear when the adjacent events consisted of the same type of AS event (e.g. ES–ES or RI–RI, which was frequently observed in the analysis of the patterns of AS event combinations). This observation was supported by a chi-squared test with a P-value of <2.2E−16. Interestingly, this trend was still statistically significant in cases of combinations that were made up of two different AS events (P = 1.7E−07 in a chi-squared test; Supplementary Table S3).For further evidence, we analyzed all public full-length cDNAs of Arabidopsis and rice, respectively (Supplementary Tables S4 and S5). Both results were similar to those of current study concerning the combination of AS events types and directions of the AS events. Thus, we concluded that transcriptome of land plants had preferred combinations of AS event types and directions.3.5. Potential AS regulatory mechanismsIn the first step of intron splicing in plants, it is thought that the splicing machinery recognizes the intron sequences. In contrast, exon sequences are recognized in mammals.23 The present study demonstrates that specific patterns of combinations and directions of AS events are preferred in Arabidopsis. Our results are consistent with a model in which the splicing machinery recognizes intronic sequences.23 If trans-acting factors, which recognize weak splicing enhancers in introns (called intronic splicing enhancers, ISEs24), are abundant in the nucleus, then the recognized regions are spliced out (Fig. 3). This model was similar to the previous one which had explained abundant RI events in plants.1 However, we thought that this model could also explain the existence of another special type of combination of AS events; AD–ES–AA (Fig. 3B). When some trans factors recognize weak splicing signals which lay on close positions, one huge intron might be spliced out from a pre-mRNA.Hypothesis regarding the regulation of multiple AS events. (A) Model for cases of multiple RI events. The circles show the putative trans-acting factors. In this model, if the trans-acting factors, which recognize weak splicing signals (gray circles), are decreased, introns with the weak signals remain in the mRNA. (B) The AS model consisting of AD–ES–AA. The gray circles show putative trans-acting factors, which recognize weak splicing signals. If the concentration of the factors increases, several regions are recognized as introns and then the large region is spliced out as a single intron. It is not known if the trans- or cis-acting factors in the model are the same.Hypothesis regarding the regulation of multiple AS events. (A) Model for cases of multiple RI events. The circles show the putative trans-acting factors. In this model, if the trans-acting factors, which recognize weak splicing signals (gray circles), are decreased, introns with the weak signals remain in the mRNA. (B) The AS model consisting of AD–ES–AA. The gray circles show putative trans-acting factors, which recognize weak splicing signals. If the concentration of the factors increases, several regions are recognized as introns and then the large region is spliced out as a single intron. It is not known if the trans- or cis-acting factors in the model are the same.It is unclear whether or not the same trans-acting factors recognize both weak ISEs and constitutive splicing signals. However, some SR proteins are candidate trans-acting factors in the proposed model. SR proteins are splicing factors that are involved in constitutive and AS.25 It is known that the regulation of many SR proteins is complicated and can vary by tissue and stress conditions.6,10 It has also been noted that some SR proteins can recognize ISEs.24 On the basis of these evidences, it may be possible that SR proteins work as trans-acting factors. Future work must focus on elucidating the ISEs and trans-acting factors in this model.It should also be noted out that our current results are consistent with our previous work on AS profiles. In the previous work, we found a tendency to select cassette exons, retain introns and select AD and acceptor sites to make longer mRNAs in plants during conditions of cold stress.7 All these tendencies could be explained by the fact that in-type events are more frequent during cold stress. In the current analysis, we had 32 transcripts with 111 AS events from a library of cold-treated plants. Out of the 111 AS events, 77 (69%) were in-type AS events. In 324 transcripts with multiple AS events, 569 of 1142 (50%) AS events were in-type events. These differences were statistically significant by a chi-squared test (P < 0.001). It may be possible that one or more trans-acting factors that recognize weak ISEs are down-regulated in response to cold stress. Interestingly, microarray analysis26 showed that expressions of many SR protein genes largely changed under cold stress conditions (Supplementary Table S6). Such regulation on SR proteins might change AS profiles in a large scale.3.6. Analysis of the motifs found in the CDSs of AS variantsWe also analyzed the CDSs encoded in the 601 novel AS variants. Of these, 52 transcripts had no clear CDS and 476 had shorter CDSs compared with the corresponding annotated gene models in TAIR. Out of the 476 transcripts with short CDSs, 96 transcripts had introns in their 3′ UTRs. Including them, we found 112 transcripts with introns in their 3′ UTRs from the data set of the 601 novel AS variants. Similar to mammals, it was reported that nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) mechanism exists in Arabidopsis. The NMD mechanism takes transcripts that have exon junctions downstream of the termination codon and causes them to decay.27 Although we may not know the actual CDS encoded by the transcripts, the number of transcripts with 3′ UTRs that contain introns appears to be large. In addition, comparison of functional motifs between the CDSs of AS variants and their reference proteins showed that most AS variants encoded proteins that lacked some functional domains. For 460 out of 549 genes that provided the novel AS variants, we could assign at least one functional domain for the CDS encoded in the AS variant and/or its reference transcript (Supplementary Table S7). In the protein sequences encoded by the novel AS variants, 392 (85%) had a reduced number of functional domains in comparison with their reference protein sequences (Supplementary Table S7). Only four transcripts had additional motifs when compared with the reference protein sequences. These results seem to show that most AS events decrease the functionality of protein products. We hypothesize that many AS events regulate the amount of functional protein by making mRNAs that are targeted by the NMD or by making mRNAs that encode non-functional proteins. This view is consistent with our previous results from a study on SR proteins in Arabidopsis, rice and moss.28 In this case, three independent AS events of mRNAs encoding SR proteins with incomplete RNA-binding domains were highly conserved in land plants. Similar models have also been proposed for AS events in animals.29,30 Our current results support the existence of a similar regulatory system in Arabidopsis.In the same time, some AS events possibly modulated functions of proteins with multiple domains. A locus AT1G09640 encodes a protein with glutathione S-transferase (GST) domains and elongation factor (EF) 1 gamma domain (Fig. 4A). It was thought that GST activities regulated assembly of a complex containing EF1 subunits and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases.31 An AS variant encoded a protein with GST domains but not EF1 gamma domain (Fig. 4A), which might not be a member of the complexes or have some regulatory roles on assembly of the complex. Another example was found in the locus AT1G10290 encoding dynamin-like protein, ADL6. It was reported that ADL6 had a function in vesicle trafficking from the trans-Golgi network to the central vacuole.32 This protein has dynamin domains followed by pleckstrin homology domain which was required for interaction between the protein and lipid32 (Fig. 4B). An AS variant encodes a protein without dynamin domains, which should lack dynamin activities but may have activities of interaction with lipids. This AS isoform protein possibly affects activity of the intact proteins. These examples showed that some AS events can modulate functions of proteins especially for ones with multiple domains.Examples of AS events affecting functional motifs. (A) The AT1G09640 locus which encodes a protein with GST domains and EF1 gamma domain. An AS variant MAS-002I13 encodes a protein lacking EF1 gamma domain. (B) The AT1G10290 locus which encodes dynamin-like protein ADL6. An AS variant MAS-004M08 encodes a protein lacking dynamin domains. Such AS events might modulate protein functions.Examples of AS events affecting functional motifs. (A) The AT1G09640 locus which encodes a protein with GST domains and EF1 gamma domain. An AS variant MAS-002I13 encodes a protein lacking EF1 gamma domain. (B) The AT1G10290 locus which encodes dynamin-like protein ADL6. An AS variant MAS-004M08 encodes a protein lacking dynamin domains. Such AS events might modulate protein functions.We also checked the CDSs of the 14 chimeric transcripts. Of these, only one transcript (MAS-001H13) had an ORF that spanned between the first and second genes (Supplementary Fig. S2). The transcript was a fused mRNA that began with the AT3G63340 locus (encoding a protein phosphatase 2C-related protein) and ended with the AT3G63330 locus (encoding a protein kinase). Still it is hard to image a function for the protein product of this chimeric transcript, but it is likely that this chimeric protein would function in both adding and removing phosphate groups on target proteins.3.7. SummaryIn the current study, we fully sequenced 1800 full-length cDNAs. Even though this data set was not large, it suggests the possibility that many more AS events occur in Arabidopsis than expected. Furthermore, the analysis of multiple AS events in individual genes suggested a regulatory mechanism that controls AS profiles. We hypothesize that some splicing regulatory elements and trans-acting factors are involved in the regulation of AS profiles. Further computational and experimental approaches should help clarify these cis- and trans-acting factors. We also examined coding potentials and protein sequences in the current study. It was interesting that many transcripts seemed to be targeted by NMD and/or to encode potentia",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ly non-functional proteins. More integrated analyses of the regulation of AS profiles and coding potential should give us a greater understanding of the importance of AS in Arabidopsis and other plants.Supplementary DataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingSupport to characterize the full-length sequences of RAFL cDNA clones discussed in this manuscript was provided by the National Bio-Resource Project of the MEXT," Japan.We thank the entire technical staff of the Sequence Technology Team at RIKEN GSC for their assistance.

IntroductionChloroplasts (cps), plant cell organelles derived from independent living cyanobacteria,1–3 contain their own small genome averaging 150 kb in flowering plants. The cp genome molecules can be circular or linear, mono- or multimeric,4 but the genome can be represented by a monomeric circular map containing two copies of an inverted repeat (IR) region (∼23 kb) which separate a small single copy (SSC) region (∼18 kb) from a large single copy (LSC) region (∼84 kb). In most angiosperm species, the cp genome contains ∼113 different genes5 that primarily encode for proteins and RNAs for the photosynthetic system and that are generally highly conserved in terms of content and order among plant families.6 Cp genomes are usually inherited maternally,7 and this property is useful for several applications such as for defining cytoplasmic breeding pools in plant breeding, and tracking parentage in interspecific hybrids (e.g. Arabidopsis suecica8). Cp genetic engineering is also an ideal approach for minimizing the risk of spreading transgenes into wild plants via pollen.9 In comparison with nuclear genetic engineering, much higher expression of the transgenic insertion can also be obtained because of the high copy number of cp genomes within a single plant cell. Cp genome sequences are also highly suitable for phylogenetic studies.10To date (February 2009), entire cp genome sequences of 117 streptophytic species are publicly available (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/ORGANELLES /plastids_tax.html). Only 18 of these genome sequences belong to the monocot group of angiosperms, and of these 13 are from the grass family Poaceae. Poaceae include the most important agricultural plant species from a socio-economic perspective as they contain the cereals and forage species.11Lolium perenne (perennial ryegrass) is globally one of the most important grassland species especially for the northern hemisphere (http://www.worldseed.org). In 2006–2007, more than one-third of world grass seed production was from L. perenne. Thus L. perenne has the highest economic impact as a forage and grassland crop. It is a cross-pollinating species and cultivar populations consist of a heterozygous nuclear genome background.Several methods exist for obtaining complete cpDNA sequences. The Arabidopsis thaliana cp genome, for example, was sequenced using cpDNA clones found as ‘contaminations’ in genomic libraries.12 The cp genome of Nicotiana sylvestris, the maternal genome donor of Nicotiana tabacum, was obtained by sequencing extracted high-purity cpDNA that was cloned into sequencing vectors.13 A commonly used method involves amplifying the cp genome by rolling circle amplification and then cloning this product into sequencing vectors.14 Recently, consensus cpDNA sequencing primers have become available for sequencing cp genomes using a primer walking strategy.15 For sequencing the cp genome of L. perenne, we extracted high-purity cpDNA which we amplified with a whole genome amplification kit and used a shotgun sequencing approach. Thus each region of the genome was sequenced several fold from independent clones, which allowed us to detect SNPs and indels.Few studies have examined variation of the cp genome within a population of a species. However, McGrath et al.16 discovered more than 500 haplotypes within 1575 individual plants of Lolium, Festulolium and Festuca populations. We hope to add to this information by assessing cp genome variation within a Lolium cultivar by detecting SNPs and indels. This assessment should reveal highly variable regions in the Lolium cp genome, from which markers can be designed for assessing cytoplasmic breeding pools and to add to population genetic and phylogenetic studies.In this study, we also analysed RNA editing sites in L. perenne cp transcripts. RNA editing is a repair mechanism that alters the genetic information of land plant organelles at the transcript level. It is a post-transcriptional modification (mostly C to U conversion) of the nucleotide sequence of pre-mRNAs by inserting, deleting or substituting nucleotides in order to yield functional RNA species.17,18 Editing in cps was first discovered by Hoch et al.19 for the cp rpl2 gene in maize, where it creates a start codon and hence restores the functionality of the rpl2 gene. Knowledge about RNA editing sites is essential for describing the functional capability of cp genes, characterizing different species and obtaining a better understanding of how these sites have evolved.2. Materials and methods2.1. Sequencing, assembling and annotating the cp genomecpDNA was isolated from the L. perenne cultivar Cashel following a protocol from Diekmann et al.20 Approximately 400 g of 3-week-old leaf material derived from ca. 200 g of a heterozygous Cashel seed population was used. Sequencing of the cpDNA was sourced to a commercial company (GATC Biotech/Germany). A shotgun sequencing approach was used resulting in 2179 trace files. A pre-assembly was carried out with the program PHRAP (http://www.phrap.org/index.html). The final assembly was based on the contiguous sequences obtained from PHRAP and done in comparison with the cpDNA sequence of Agrostis stolonifera (bentgrass).21 For three genome regions with low coverage, primers were designed to re-sequence these regions (trnL-trnF: forward primer (FP): AGTTGTGAGGGTTC AAGTCC and reverse primer (RP): GAACTGGTGACACGAGGATT; atpB: FP: GTTCGTTGCCAACAATCCTA and RP: AGGTAGCTCTAGTCTATGGC; atpB-rbcL: FP: TGTGGAAGATCTGTGCCTAC and RP: GCTGAGGAGTTACTCGGAAT).The annotation of the cp genome was based on two online available programs: DOGMA (http://dogma.ccbb.utexas.edu/) and tRNA-Scan SE (http://lowelab.ucsc.edu/tRNAscan-SE/) using the default settings. Intron positions were determined following Sugita and Sugiura.22 The circular cp genome map was drawn using the GenomeVx program.23 Differences between the available cp genomes were analysed based on gene, intergenic spacer (IGS) and intron lengths which were extracted from the published cp genome sequences (A. stolonifera: EF115543; Brachypodium distachyon: EU325680; Hordeum vulgare: EF115541; Oryza nivara: AP006728; Oryza sativa indica: AY522329; Oryza sativa japonica: X15901; Sorghum bicolor: EF115542; Saccharum officinarum: AP006714; Triticum aestivum: AB042240; Zea mays: X86563).2.2. SNP and indel analysisBecause the cpDNA had been extracted from a population of plants belonging to the cultivar Cashel, several SNPs and indels could be detected. A thorough SNP and indel analysis was carried out by manually checking the alignment of the read and trace files from which the genome assembly was undertaken using the programme Lasergene (DNAstar, Inc., Madison, Wisconsin). Only SNPs and indels supported by trace files with low background and clear, distinguishable peaks were recorded. Indels were only taken into account if they were supported by at least two trace files and not located in coding regions where they would cause a frame shift. This way the possibility of cloning and sequencing artefacts was considered.2.3. RNA editing analysisThirty-three genes (atpA, atpB, atpF, clpP, matK, ndhA, ndhB, ndhD, ndhF, ndhG, ndhI, ndhK, petA, petB, psaA, psaB, psaJ, psbC, psbD, psbE, psbJ, psbL, psbZ, rpl2, rpl20, rpoA, rpoB, rpoC1, rpoC2, rps14, rps2, rps8, ycf3) were analysed for RNA editing sites. Of these, 22 were chosen for study because they had been previously reported to be edited in other monocot plants,24–28 and 11 were included because of observed differences from existing expressed sequence tags (EST) in Poaceae,21 but no information was previously available for Lolium. Primers (Supplementary Table S1) for these genes were designed using Primer Express (version 2.0, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and Primer3 software (http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/). For genes > 700 bp, several primer pairs were designed to cover the complete gene region. Primers were designed in the untranslated regions (UTR) to ensure complete coverage of genes. Since the length of the UTR of genes was not known, the primers were designed in the 30 bp region before and after each gene.cDNA was used as template for the RT–PCRs. Total RNA was extracted using TRI Reagent® Solution (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX, USA) following the supplier's protocol (http://www.ambion.com/techlib/prot/bp_9738.pdf) with the following modifications: the incubation of the homogenate was extended to 10 min; instead of 100 µl bromochloropropane, 200 µl of ice cold chloroform was used; the steps including the addition of ice cold chloroform, followed by incubation at room temperature and centrifugation at 12 000g were repeated once; in addition to the 500 µl isopropanol, 0.5 µl Glycogen (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, Missouri, USA) was added to enhance the RNA yield; the centrifugation following the addition of isopropanol was extended to 10 min. The RNA was finally dissolved in nuclease free water and treated with DNA-free™ (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX, USA) following the manufacturer's instructions to remove possible DNA contamination. First strand cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript™ III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen™ Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following the manufacturer's instructions.For each gene region, two independent RT–PCR reactions were set up using the following components per 30 µl PCR reaction: 3 µl cDNA, 3 µl 10 x Thermo Buffer (New England Biolabs, Inc., Ipswich, MA, USA), 0.6 µl FP, 0.6 µl RP, 0.6 µl dNTPs (metabion international AG, Martinsried, Germany) (10 mM), 21.9 µl ddH2O, 0.3 µl Taq-Polymerase (New England Biolabs, Inc.). The PCR programme settings were 95°C 5 min, (95°C 1 min, 55°C 1 min, 72°C 1 min) 35 cycles, 72°C 10 min. The annealing temperature was adjusted according to the optimal primer requirements. The resulting RT–PCR products were sequenced twice using both forward and reverse primers. The analysis of the editing sites was carried out in MEGA 3.129 by aligning the cDNA sequence results with the corresponding DNA sequences and checking visually for SNPs.3. Results and discussionUsing the shotgun sequencing approach an average eightfold genome coverage was achieved. The cp genome of L. perenne has a total length of 135 282 bp with a quadripartite structure typical of angiosperms. The LSC region consists of 79 972 bp, the SSC of 12 428 bp and the IRs of 21 441 bp each (Fig. 1). The genome has a GC content of 38% and codes for 128 genes of which 18 are duplicated in the IR region. The genome contains 264 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) with mononucleotide repeats of 7–16 bp in length. The cp genome sequence of L. perenne is deposited at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory under Accession number AM777385.Circular structure of the chloroplast genome of Lolium perenne.

Comparison to other speciesThe average size of publicly available Poaceae cp genomes is 137 091 bp. The subfamily Ehrhartoideae has the smallest genome with an average size of 134 505 bp; subfamily Panicoideae has the largest genome with an average size of 140 876 bp. The subfamily Pooideae, to which L. perenne belongs, has an average size of 135 614 bp. Thus L. perenne is of average size within Pooideae and of medium size within Poaceae (Fig. 2).Chloroplast genome sizes of 11 different Poaceae species grouped by taxonomic sub-families.Chloroplast genome sizes of 11 different Poaceae species grouped by taxonomic sub-families.The gene content and intron content of L. perenne cpDNA are the same as that of other grasses,21,24,27,30,31,32 with 76 protein-coding genes, 30 tRNA genes and four rRNA genes. Eighteen genes are completely duplicated within the IR, as are the 3′ exons of the trans-spliced gene rps12 and the 5′ part of ndhH which overlaps the IR/SSC junctions. When compared with the standard set of genes in angiosperm cp genomes, the genes accD, ycf1 and ycf2 are absent. After our analysis was completed, the cp genome sequence of the very closely related species Festuca arundinacea became available in GenBank (Cahoon et al., unpublished data; accession number FJ466687). Rather surprisingly, in addition to the expected absences of accD, ycf1 and ycf2, the Festuca sequence also lacks intact copies of the genes psbF, rps14, rps18 and ycf4. All four of these genes are intact and apparently functional in L. perenne.Differences in the cp genome size of L. perenne compared with other Poaceae species are mainly due to length variations of IGS regions and introns (Table 1) and this finding was consistent with previous observations.27,32 The length of IGS regions and introns varies widely from only a few base pairs up to several hundred. Twenty-five IGS regions and four introns were found to vary in length by more than 100 bp (Table 1). The highest variation in size (given in brackets) was found in the trnI-CAU–trnL-CAA IGS (2135 bp), the trnG-UCC–trnT-GGU IGS (1231 bp) and the rbcL–psaI IGS (1221 bp). The trnI-CAU–trnL-CAA IGS and rbcL–psaI IGS are sites that contain pseudogenes for ycf2 and accD, respectively, in Poaceae.27 Both these pseudogenes and a ycf1 pseudogene were detected in L. perenne. The trnG-UCC - trnT-GGU IGS is part of a ‘divergence hotspot’ described by Maier et al.27 whose variability is caused by a large number of deletion/insertion events.Length variation of > 100 bp for intergenic spacer and intron regions in Poaceae chloroplast genomesBold numbers show the shortest length for that intergenic spacer/intron.

Bold and underlined numbers show the largest length for that intergenic spacer/intron.aDifference between smallest and largest values.bHighlights introns.A comparison between L. perenne and the other Poaceae species showed differences in gene length for 26 genes (Table 2). The majority of these genes is in the LSC region. Length variations of more than ten codons were observed in eight genes (codon variation): matK (31), ndhK (21), petB (19), rpoC2 (68), rps3 (15), rps15 (12), rps16 (27) and rps18 (14). The variation in gene length for the rpoC2 gene was more than twice that found in any other gene. L. perenne and A. stolonifera have the shortest rpoC2 genes (each 4 401 bp). The rps18 gene in L. perenne is up to 14 codons shorter than in the other species. The ndhK and rps16 genes are 21 and 27 codons, respectively, longer in L. perenne than in O. nivara.Variation in length of different chloroplast genesIf not otherwise stated numbers shown refer to amount of additional codons; —, no variation to the smallest length observed.Variation in length of different chloroplast genesIf not otherwise stated numbers shown refer to amount of additional codons; —, no variation to the smallest length observed.The length variations observed in rps18 and rpoC2 are noteworthy. In both cases, L. perenne showed the shortest of all sequences. Sequence variation between monocots and dicots for rps18 has been described by Weglöhner et al.,33 based on the occurrence of different numbers of the heptapeptide repeat SKQPFRK near the N terminus of the protein. Our study revealed that length differences among Poaceae rps18 sequences are mainly based on the same heptapeptide repeat (S/F)K(Q/K)(P/T)F(R/L/H/S/N)(K/R) as described by Weglöhner et al.33 (Supplementary Fig. S1). This motif is present six times in rps18 of L. perenne, B. distachyon, O. sativa, O. nivara, S. bicolor and S. officinarum and seven times in rps18 of A. stolonifera, H. vulgare, T. aestivum and Z. mays. The L. perenne rps18 gene is the shortest detected so far, because it has undergone an additional deletion of seven amino acids near its C terminus. The deletions do not result in the creation of stop codons and we expect the L. perenne rps18 gene to be functional.The largest length variation in Poaceae genes was found in rpoC2, of up to 68 codons difference between L. perenne and S. officinarum, and is due to several insertion/deletion events (data not shown). Comparisons of the rpoC2 gene from dicots and monocots revealed that Poaceae have a unique insertion of ∼400 bp in the middle of this gene.34–36 Cummings et al.36 demonstrated that this region is highly variable compared with its flanking regions and is rich with tandem repeats. Nearly, all the variations found between L. perenne and the panicoids are located in this specific insertion region. Analysing cytoplasmic male sterile (CMS) lines of Sorghum, Chen et al.37 discovered a 165 bp deletion in this insertion region that suggests a possible relation between this deletion in rpoC2 and the CMS-system.38 So far this deletion was only observed in Sorghum but sequence comparisons (data not shown) revealed that one deletion that results in the shorter L. perenne rpoC2 gene is located in the same region where the deletion occurs in Sorghum. Hence a higher susceptibility to variation in this gene region could be indicated and an investigation of L. perenne CMS lines in regard to variation to fertile lines may prove valuable for improving future Lolium breeding schemes.3.2. Indel/SNP analysisA total of 10 indels (Table 3) and 40 SNPs (Table 4) were found to be polymorphic among our sequencing reads. All indels are located in intergenic regions. Indels occurred in microsatellite regions, resulting in both shortening (one occurrence) and lengthening (nine occurrences) of the sequenced region compared with the length that was observed in the majority of the trace files. Knowledge gained about the sequence variability of these regions can be used to design primers around those microsatellites for population genetic and phylogenetic studies and can be also used to support breeding schemes via defining cytoplasmic breeding pools. This will be of especially high value for breeding schemes based on interspecific crosses between Lolium and Festuca.Indels observed in the cp genome of Lolium perenneMajor, most commonly found nucleotide; minor, least commonly found nucleotide; absolute and % columns refer to the amount of trace files containing the under-represented nucleotide.Indels observed in the cp genome of Lolium perenneMajor, most commonly found nucleotide; minor, least commonly found nucleotide; absolute and % columns refer to the amount of trace files containing the under-represented nucleotide.Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the chloroplast genome of Lolium perenneMajor, most commonly found nucleotide; minor, least commonly found nucleotide; absolute and % columns refer to the amount of trace files containing the under-represented nucleotide.aInversions.Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the chloroplast genome of Lolium perenneMajor, most commonly found nucleotide; minor, least commonly found nucleotide; absolute and % columns refer to the amount of trace files containing the under-represented nucleotide.aInversions.Nineteen SNPs were found within IGS regions and introns and 21 within coding regions (Table 4). Most of the SNPs are due to transition mutations (20 A↔G and 8 C↔T), with 12 transversions. Closer analysis of the SNPs found at position 100 655 and 100 656 (trnN-rps15 IGS) revealed that these SNPs are caused by a tiny inversion of two nucleotides which are flanked by an IR of 29 bp length forming a stable hairpin secondary structure (Fig. 3). The small inversion of TG within the trnN-rps15 region in the IR is found in 13 of the 29 trace files covering the region. We also noticed another small inversion that was supported by only one sequence read and caused SNPs at position 18, 20, 21 and 23 (rps19-psbA IGS). This inversion spans six nucleotides (TTCTAG) that are flanked by an IR of 25 bp length (Fig. 3).Two hairpin loops found in the chloroplast genome of Lolium perenne.Two hairpin loops found in the chloroplast genome of Lolium perenne.Small inversions like the ones revealed by our study have been found between species,39,40 between genera39,41 and also within populations of one other species, the conifer Abies.42 The two inversions found in the current study lead, together with the level of observed SNPs, to the conclusion that the cp genome of L. perenne cv Cashel consists of at least two haplotypes but potentially scores more. McGrath et al.16 detected five haplotypes in 16 individuals of Cashel using a set of ten primers43 amplifying eight different regions in the cp genome and sizing the PCR products. Eight maternal lines were included in breeding Cashel (Vincent Connolly, personal communication). Thus further analyses based on DNA sequences could reveal up to eight haplotypes, differing by SNPs and indels that include the ones found in this study.Although cp genomes are known to be highly conserved, similar observations of intraspecific cp DNA variation have been recorded in other species.21,44,45 However, this is the only study we know of that has quantified SNP variation of the whole cp genome within a cultivar. Most studies of cp DNA variation within a species have assessed populations of individuals with a limited number of markers, from a few selected gene regions or have sampled wild populations. Tsumura et al.42 studied natural populations of Abies and also detected many minor variations like indels and inversions within species. Although some of the apparent SNPs that were only present in one sequencing read might be due to cloning artefacts, the current results are not surprising in view of the fact that L. perenne is an outcrossing species and the cultivar we used for sequencing is based on a population of several maternal lines and is thus heterogeneous and heterozygous. However, to discover this extent of SNP variation within a single cultivar of Lolium was surprising.3.3. RNA editing sitesIn total, 31 RNA editing sites were detected in 18 genes (Table 5). All editing sites are C to U changes. Most frequently, editing results in changes of the amino acid from serine or proline to leucine. Four editing sites (ndhA, site 4; ndhG, 5′ UTR; rpoB, site 4; rps14), which were previously observed in other Poaceae species, were not edited in L. perenne. For three of them, the conserved nucleotide U exists already at the DNA level. Site 4 in rpoB is not edited, although C is encoded in the DNA.RNA editing sites found in the chloroplast genome of Lolium perenne in comparison with the editing sites found in other monocots—, editing although C encoded in DNA; (—), no editing, U encoded in DNA; blank space, editing not yet determined/no information available; italic text: unique for Lolium perenne.aPartially edited.RNA editing sites found in the chloroplast genome of Lolium perenne in comparison with the editing sites found in other monocots—, editing although C encoded in DNA; (—), no editing, U encoded in DNA; blank space, editing not yet determined/no information available; italic text: unique for Lolium perenne.aPartially edited.Analysis of editing in the ndhA gene was not completed because several primers failed to amplify and the obtained sequencing products did not have the full gene length. Thus site 4, which was observed in O. sativa, S. officinarum and Z. mays, could not be analysed. However, in L. perenne this position is a TTC (phenylalanine) codon, which is the same as the codon that is formed by mRNA editing in the three other species. Thus editing is unlikely to happen at this position in L. perenne.The editing analysis revealed five new editing sites that are so far unique to L. perenne. Four of these sites are in three genes (ndhK, psbJ, psbL) in which editing has never been reported before in Poaceae species. Two of the five new editing sites are synonymous but three result in changes of the amino acid to leucine.Partial editing was observed at eight editing sites (six genes). In most of these editing sites, the amount of incompletely edited transcripts is small. However, approximately one-half and one-third of the matK and psbL transcripts, respectively, are not edited.This study of RNA editing sites in the cp genome of L. perenne demonstrates that predicting editing sites based solely on published EST sequences is not sufficient. Timme et al.45 also showed that editing sites can be easily overlooked, or SNPs can be falsely interpreted as editing sites, using that approach. For example only six of the genes analysed via EST comparisons by Saski et al.21 have had editing sites experimentally confirmed in other species. The SNPs found in EST sequences by Saski et al.21 were in general not based on C–U changes and thus are highly unlikely to be editing sites. Most of the SNPs found by comparing ESTs to cpDNA sequences will be based on the use of different varieties, or on poor quality sequencing data. Our approach of analysing SNPs and editing sites in the same variety of L. perenne ensured that newly detected sites with either complete or partial editing were evaluated correctly as editing sites and not accidentally mistaken as SNPs or vice versa.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThe project funding was obtained from the Teagasc ‘Vision’ programme.We thank Dr Jiri Ködding and Dr Gavin Conant for all their support while sequencing, assembling and annotating the chloroplast genome.

15,10.1093/dnares/dsp007,Transcriptional Regulation of the Capsular Polysaccharide Biosynthesis Locus of Streptococcus Pneumoniae: a Bioinformatic Analysis,"Miriam Moscoso,Ernesto García",NO,NO,NO,8-May-09,"capsular polysaccharide, Streptococcus pneumoniae, transcriptional regulation, bioinformatic analysis, operator sequences","The polysaccharide capsule of Streptococcus pneumoniae is the main virulence factor, which makes the bacterium resistant to phagocytosis. Expression of capsular polysaccharide must be adjusted at different stages of pneumococcal infection, thus, their transcriptional regulation appears to be crucial. To get insight into the existence of regulatory mechanisms common to most serotypes, a bioinformatic analysis of the DNA region located upstream of the capsular locus was performed. With the exception of serotype 37, the capsular locus is located between dexB and aliA on the pneumococcal chromosome. Up to 26 different sequence organizations were found among pneumococci synthesizing their capsule through a Wzy-polymerase-dependent mechanism, mostly varying according to the presence/absence of distinct insertion elements. As a consequence, only ∼250 bp (including a 107 bp RUP_A element) was conserved in 86 sequences, although only a short (ca. 87 bp) region located immediately upstream of cpsA was strictly conserved in all the sequences analyzed. An exhaustive search for possible operator sequences was done. Interestingly, although the promoter region of serotype 3 isolates completely differs from that of other serotypes, most of the proteins proposed to regulate transcription in serotype 3 pneumococci were also predicted to function as possible regulators in non-serotype 3 S. pneumoniae isolates.","The polysaccharide capsule of Streptococcus pneumoniae is the main virulence factor, which makes the bacterium resistant to phagocytosis.

Pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide (CPS) is immunogenic and induces type-specific protective immunity.1 Although a 23-valent CPS vaccine and a heptavalent protein–polysaccharide conjugate vaccine (designed for pediatric use) are currently available, they are far from being satisfactory. At least 91 different CPS have been described to date in S. pneumoniae.2 The cap (or cps) cluster of S. pneumoniae (Supplementary Fig. S1), which appears to be organized as a single transcriptional unit (see below), is located between dexB and aliA (two genes that do not participate in capsule biosynthesis),3 with the notable exception of the serotype 37 CPS whose synthesis depends on a single protein encoded by a gene located far from the cps locus on the S. pneumoniae chromosome.4 At least 89 of the 91 pneumococcal CPS known to date appear to be synthesized by a Wzy-polymerase-dependent mechanism in which individual repeat units assembled on undecaprenyl phosphate on the inner face of the bacterial membrane are polymerized on the outer membrane surface.5 The synthesis of CPS of serotypes 3 and 37 is catalyzed by a single, membrane-bound glycosyltransferase (synthase) referred to as Cap3B/Cps3S, and Tts, respectively. In these two serotypes, the common sequences located at the 5′ end of all the other loci and that code for regulatory proteins either are not present (type 37) or are mutated and not transcribed (type 3) (Supplementary Fig. S1).4One of the most striking features of the pneumococcal cps locus is its huge genetic divergence, since only a few genes are conserved among different clusters.6 These genes are located at the 5′ end of the cps locus and are known to be involved in the processing, regulation and export of CPS and, possibly in the attachment of the CPS to the cell wall.7 Remarkably, only the first gene of the cluster (cap/cpsA) is over 90% identical in all the gene clusters. A near consensus, functional promoter sequence (5′-TAGACA-17 nucleotides-TATAAT3’) (cpsp) has been identified 30 nucleotides upstream of the initiation codon of the cap/cpsA gene, and the transcription start point of the cap/cps operon has also been determined.8Since the capsule makes the bacterium resistant to phagocytosis, maximal expression of CPS is essential for systemic virulence, although the capacity to regulate the amount of CPS also appears to be crucial, e.g. a reduced level of CPS is an absolute requirement for efficient nasopharyngeal colonization.9 It has been reported that the expression of some capsular genes was reduced when pneumococcal cells were treated with penicillin or vancomycin.10,11 Nevertheless, the existence of possible regulatory pathways for CPS biosynthesis, however, is basically unknown and controversial.12–17We identified 115 different entries in the databases fulfilling the requirements established, i.e. the complete nucleotide sequence was available from the termination codon of dexB to the initiation codon of cpsA. As indicated in Supplementary Table S1, 26 different sequence organizations (SOs) were identified in this region. Sequence organization 10 (37 sequences) was by far the most frequent, and together with SO_1 (22 sequences), SO_2 (8 sequences) and SO_22 (18 sequences) accounted for close to 75% of all the SOs. Although, in most cases, the nucleotide sequence of only one isolate per serotype was available, it was noted that different strains with identical CPS may have different SOs, mostly varying according to the presence (or absence) of distinct insertion sequences (ISs) (Supplementary Fig. S2). Despite the appreciable polymorphism in the dexB–cpsA region, two major SO groups could be recognized: those containing an intact or truncated copy of IS630_Spn1 (from SO_1 to SO_21) (designated group I) and SO_22 to SO_26 (group II) lacking this IS and some additional fragments. IS630_Spn1 is a ∼0.9 kb element firstly reported by Oggioni and Claverys.18 When examining group I sequences, with the exception of SO_9, SO_12 and SO_21 that contain one or more IS in this region, it is evident that similarity in the vicinity of the cpsp region was restricted to a ca. 250 bp sequence (Supplementary Fig. S3). Two different regions can be distinguished in this sequence: (i) a 140 bp fragment that includes a 107 bp RUP_A sequence and a ∼34 bp sequence that resembles the insertion site of IS1381 (Fig. 1A) and (ii) a short (∼87 bp) region embracing the cpsp region (Fig. 1B) (indicated by a green rectangle in Supplementary Fig. S2). RUP_A is a highly repeated extragenic element of S. pneumoniae that is very similar to the inverted terminal repeats of IS630-Spn1 and might be trans-activated by transposase and promote sequence rearrangements.18 The possibility that RUP elements may serve as binding sites for regulatory proteins has been proposed.19 Interestingly, transcriptional start sites have been mapped in a RUP_C element located upstream of tts, the gene encoding the polysaccharide synthase responsible for the synthesis of serotype 37 CPS.20Consensus sequences derived from alignments of strains synthesizing CPS through a Wzy-polymerase- (A and B) or a synthase-dependent mechanism (C).

Consequently, the ∼87 bp region that contains the promoter of the cps gene cluster (Fig. 1B) turned out to be the only conserved sequence in all the S. pneumoniae isolates that synthesize their CPS through a Wzy-polymerase-dependent mechanism. However, on closer examination of the full alignment (Supplementary Fig. S3), the existence of potentially significant polymorphisms in this region was revealed. In addition to the T to C transition at position −8 in the unencapsulated R6 strain (AE008412), an identical mutation was found at position −11 in strains E294 (CR931699; serotype 33B), CSF/79 (CR931701; serotype 33D), SP18-BS74 (NZ_ABAE01000002; serotype 18C) and WCH18 (CR9316640; serotype 6B). All these mutations cause a change in the −10 region of cpsp from the consensus sequence TATAAT to TATAAC (in R6)21 or TACAAT (in the latter four strains) thereby potentially reducing the corresponding promoter strength. In particular, the reported reduced transcription of the cps genes associated with capsular polysaccharide formation in the unencapsulated strain R621,22 is likely attributable to a mutation in the −10 box of the R6 cps promoter from the consensus TATAAT to TATAAC (see above). Moreover, only the last four nucleotides of the −35 promoter box (TAGACA) were conserved among the 115 sequences examined (Supplementary Fig. S3). It should be noted that in all the sequences examined, 17 perfectly conserved nucleotides separate the −35 and −10 promoter boxes. The transcription initiation site (indicated as +1 in Fig. 1B) is also conserved in all the sequences analyzed.The effect of intrinsic curvature upstream of a bacterial promoter on the efficiency of transcription was first reported in the early 1980s. To date, there are countless examples indicating the importance of a curved DNA sequence during steps of transcription, mainly in regulating the transcription initiation process.23 It has been recently shown that global transcription factors as well as several other transcriptional regulators have a significant tendency to regulate operons with curved DNA sequences in their upstream regulatory regions.24 Bendability/curvature propensity plots were constructed with the help of the Bend.it server (http://hydra.icgeb.trieste.it/dna/bend_it.html) using defaults parameters with the exception of a 20-nucleotide window size.25 We used the sequence of the 228 bp fragment (including the ATG initiation codon) located upstream of cpsA from the serotype 2 strain D39 (AE026 471) to predict its curvature. The curvature-propensity plot, constructed using DNase I-based trinucleotide parameters, shows four peaks around positions −125, −98, −43 and −17 of magnitudes ≥ 9.0 (data not shown). It should be underscored that the regions showing these potential curvatures occur in the 87 bp fragment containing cpsp, which is the only stretch common to all pneumococci that synthesize their CPS through a Wzy-dependent pathway (see above). A computer prediction of bendability of the above mentioned DNA fragment (AE026471) (data not shown) rendered at least seven conspicuous peaks (positions −175, −137, −128, −77, −57, −9, +5) with magnitudes ≥ 5.0. In addition, the bendability plot showed two long troughs (from positions −158 to −151 and −103 to −96; magnitudes ≤ 3.5) indicative of rigid segments. Interestingly, the latter rigid segment embraces a potential static curvature (centered at −98; see above) and is located near the 3′ end of the RUP_A element.The annotated genome sequence of the S. pneumoniae strains TIGR4, R6 and D39 revealed the presence of, at least, 80 putative transcriptional regulatory genes, representing ∼4% of the complete genome. Unfortunately, in only few cases was the operator site identified. Putative operators were searched for using Fuzznuc (http://mobyle.pasteur.fr/cgi-bin/MobylePortal/portal.py?form=fuzznuc) and the consensus sequences reported in Fig. 1A and B allowing a maximum of two mismatches. Among the currently known (and putative) pneumococcal operators, only sequences similar to the binding sites of ComX1,26 CopY,27,28 MalR,29 GlnR30,31 or RitR32 were detected (Table 1). As a notable exception, it should be mentioned that none of the four potential binding sites for GlnR are located in the region common to all isolates whose CPS is synthesized through a Wzy-dependent pathway.Binding sites of transcriptional regulators putatively involved in CPS biosynthesis of S. pneumoniaeaf and r indicate whether the sequence corresponds to the forward or reverse sequence of that included in the EMBL database (AF026471 or Z47210), respectively. Unless otherwise stated, a maximum of two mismatches were allowed.bSequences corresponding to those common to all strains are indicated with a gray background. Mismatches are indicated by lowercase lettering.cThis sequence is a subset of the CcpA binding site.dOnly one mismatch was allowed.eSimilarity restricted to part of the protein (from residue 145 to 197 of the pneumococcal protein and 12 to 64 of that of B. subtilis).Binding sites of transcriptional regulators putatively involved in CPS biosynthesis of S. pneumoniaeaf and r indicate whether the sequence corresponds to the forward or reverse sequence of that included in the EMBL database (AF026471 or Z47210), respectively.

Many potential Streptococcus pyogenes CovR/CsrR binding sites were found34 and the locations of potential operators for five different B. subtilis transcriptional regulators were also determined (Table 1). Furthermore, we also examined the conserved regions for the presence of direct and/or inverted repeats but, although inconclusive at the moment, these searches suggested that other binding sequences are present in this promoter.As reviewed elsewhere,4 the promoter region of serotype 3 S. pneumoniae isolates completely differs from that of other serotypes. Three different serotype 3 isolates of S. pneumoniae were completely sequenced between dexB and the ATG initiation codon of cps3A (Supplementary Table S1) and two SOs were found, differing only in terms of the length of the IS630_Spn1 element (Supplementary Fig. S4). The three isolates showed ≥ 95% nucleotide sequence identity between the deleted copy of cpsD and the ATG initiation codon of cps3A. This was also true for the serotype 3 strain WU2 (Accession no. U66846 and U15171). Downstream of the deleted copy of cpsD, three pseudogenes were detected: an internal fragment (83 bp) of wchA, a gene putatively encoding the initial sugar transferase from a serotype 20 S. pneumoniae strain; the so-called orf5 (491 bp) putatively coding for a membrane protein (corresponding to Spr1830 in the genome of strain R6) and a 403 bp fragment showing 86% identity to IS1548. A ca. 180 bp DNA fragment containing the serotype 3 promoter (cps3p) was located between IS1548 and cps3A. Polymorphism was only found at four positions in the three serotype 3 isolates that were aligned (Supplementary Fig. S3C).The curvature-propensity plot of the region containing cps3p showed two prominent peaks around positions −61 and −18. Further, two peaks of bendability ≥ 5.0 were predicted at positions −35 and −66 whereas rigid segments (bendability ≤ 3.5) appeared to span positions −49 to −45, −14 to −11, and −2 to +8 (data not shown).We also searched the ca. 180 bp sequence upstream of cps3A (Fig. 1C) for potential operators as for the other serotypes (Table 1). Interestingly, with the exceptions of AdcR and RovS, the proteins proposed to regulate cps transcription in serotype 3 pneumococci were also predicted to function as possible regulators in non-serotype 3 S. pneumoniae isolates, which might indicate the existence of common regulatory mechanism in otherwise divergent sequences. Nevertheless, the potential relevance of this finding remains to be determined.As already mentioned, experiments aimed to demonstrate that CPS biosynthesis is transcriptionally regulated have yielded conflicting results. Notwithstanding, in an elegant electron microscopy study on cultured epithelial cells neither serotype 3 pneumococci in close contact with the host cell membrane nor invading pneumococci exhibited a visible capsular structure, whereas pneumococci not in close contact with the host membrane had a typical capsule. Moreover, S. pneumoniae cells expressed CPS in the lungs of infected mice, whereas bacteria in contact with lung epithelial tissue showed a drastic reduction in the density of the CPS layer.35Recently, in vitro serotype-dependent expression of cpsA in transparent variants of S. pneumoniae has been observed, i.e. the serotypes/groups associated with invasive infections tend to express more cpsA than those frequently isolated from carriers.17 Unfortunately, in that report, the number of isolates examined was insufficient for a reliable comparison of cpsA expression among different clones of the same serotype (or serogroup).We should point out that the catabolite repressor protein CcpA (also denoted RegM) appears to be involved in transcriptional activation of the cps operon in the serotype 2 strain D39.36 Besides, it has been reported that a ccpA mutant of the serotype 4 strain TIGR4 was drastically attenuated for infection of the lung and colonization of the nasopharynx.37 Extracellular glucose concentrations might positively regulate the level of CPS biosynthesis. Thus, the glucose concentration is normally very low (< 1 mM) in healthy nasopharyngeal secretions,38 and a reduced amount of CPS is required for optimal attachment of the pneumococcus to epithelial cells.9 In contrast, invading pneumococci encounter high glucose concentrations (5.4 mM) in the blood stream of healthy individuals39 where maximum CPS biosynthesis is most needed. Although no data are available on serotype 3 pneumococci, it should be underscored that the hasABC operon, which is involved in the synthesis of the hyaluronic acid capsule of S. pyogenes and is phylogenetically related to the pneumococcal cps3ABC operon,40 is significantly down-regulated in a ΔccpA mutant.41Recent studies have also examined the role in virulence of several proven pneumococcal transcriptional regulators using microarrays. Kloosterman et al.31 used a glnR mutant and did not observe a differential expression of the capsular locus, suggesting that the binding sites identified here (Table 1) might not be relevant. However, it has been reported that RitR represses the expression of cps2N, a gene involved in the biosynthesis of dTDP-rhamnose, one of the sugar nucleotides required for the biosynthesis of type 2 CPS.32 Interestingly, binding sites for RitR have been found in the cpsp region (Table 1). It should be kept in mind, that the S. pneumoniae orphan response regulator RitR is very similar to the streptococcal global regulator CovR (also designated as CsrR) and there is conclusive evidence showing that CovR is a global regulator that either represses (S. pyogenes, Streptococcus suis) or upregulates (Streptococcus agalactiae) CPS biosynthesis.42–44 Putative CovR-like operator sequences are located in the region containing the capsular promoter.Although there is no experimental data on the existence of functional promoters (different of cpsp) located in the intergenic regions of the capsular locus, their possible presence and function should be mentioned. For example, an enhanced biosynthesis of the UDP-glucose dehydrogenase Cps2K has been observed in a D39 ΔcodY mutant.45 A close examination of the 129 bp long region located between cps2H and cps2I (both genes located upstream of cps2K) revealed the existence of a putative promoter (5′-TAGTTG-18 nucleotides-TATTTT-3′) and, further upstream, of an imperfect palindrome (AATTTTtAGAgAATT) quite similar to the consensus binding site of CodY (AATTTTCWGAAAATT).46 Whether these sequences are relevant in vivo requires further studies.In summary, this study provides some of the sequence data needed to pave the way for systematically identifying the regulatory pathways of CPS biosynthesis in S. pneumoniae.Supplementary DataSupplemental data are available online at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.orgFundingThis work was supported by a grant from the Dirección General de Investigación Científica y Técnica (SAF2006-00390).

Moench) is the world’s fifth most important cereal crop, after wheat, rice, maize and barley1 and was grown on 43 million hectares in 2004 (http://faostat.fao.org/). There is a great demand for sorghum for human food, livestock feed and green manure production. As in other crop species, it is necessary to improve traits with economic value, including yield potential, sugar content and disease resistance, to enhance sorghum’s potential as a crop. To dissect the morphological and physiological traits of sorghum at a genetic level, many types of molecular markers have been developed, including restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms (RFLPs),2–4 amplified-fragment-length polymorphisms5 and simple sequence repeats (SSRs).6–11 SSR markers are mostly codominant, are readily amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and are effective at detecting genotype variation caused by a high degree of polymorphism. However, only a few hundred sorghum SSR markers are publicly available for use in fine mapping and map-based cloning of genes of interest.Among the five major cereal crops, the genome of sorghum is the second smallest (750 Mb) after that of rice (440 Mb) and is between one-third and one-quarter the size of the maize genome (2500 Mb).12 Sorghum is more closely related to maize and sugarcane than to rice, and it shared a common ancestor as recently as 18–25 million years ago with maize13 and 10 million years ago with sugarcane.14 Owing to its small genome size and evolutionary divergence, sorghum is a potentially important model plant among the panicoid grasses. In sorghum, whole-genome shotgun (WGS) sequencing by means of methylation filtration has tagged 96% of the sorghum genes,15 and recently the whole genome was sequenced and annotated.16 These sequence data were produced by the U.S. Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (http://www.jgi.doe.g.ov/) in collaboration with the research community. The most recent versions of the Sbi1 and Sbi1_4 annotations use pseudo-chromosome alignment (JGI Phytozome Sorghum bicolor website: http://www.phytozome.net/sorghum). The availability of sorghum genomic sequences now provides an opportunity to extend the bank of SSR markers. The sorghum genome sequence project identified ∼71 000 SSRs in the genome;16 however, no information on the SSR motifs and primers is available.We have developed a new set of SSR markers to facilitate the genetic and molecular dissection of sorghum genes that encode traits with economic value, including quantitative traits. This was achieved by using the following procedures: (i) design of primer pairs in regions flanking the SSR motifs from WGS sequences; (ii) mapping of the genomic positions of designed SSR primer pairs by means of electronic PCR (ePCR)17 and comparison of the positions of the new SSR markers with gene loci predicted using the Sbi1_4 annotations and (iii) experimental validation of representative SSR markers by means of fragment analysis among 11 sorghum lines and one sudangrass line.The screening of 570 794 WGS sequences (accession numbers CL147592–CL197752, CC058553–CC059980, BZ329127–BZ342789, BZ342901–BZ352342, BZ365856–BZ368372, BZ369686–BZ370012, BZ421595–BZ424357, BZ625682–BZ629992, BZ779555–BZ781928, CW020594–CW502582 and CW512190–CW514008) from the ATx623 line of sorghum for di-, tri-, tetra- and pentanucleotide repeats provided 11 684 sequences suitable for the design of SSR markers using the SSRIT software.18 To minimize duplication, the 11 684 sequences were screened for redundancy by comparisons among the primer sequences and by means of BLASTN analysis against genomic sequences. Of the 570 794 sequences, 0.98% (5599) contained unique SSR markers that were non-redundant and non-overlapping in sorghum chromosomes. These sequences are referred to as SSR markers and are provided in Supplementary Table S1. Primer sets for SSR markers were automatically designed by using the Perl script srchssr2.pl19 to control the Primer3 core program.20 All parameters of srchssr2.pl were set at the default values.An analysis of the association between SSR motifs and the rate of polymorphism is important for the development of effective SSR markers. Table 1 summarizes the relative frequency of the 10 most common SSR motifs among the set of 5599 SSR markers. The most common dinucleotide motifs were AT/TA (26.1%), AG/TC (20.5%), AC/TG (13.7%) and CG/GC (11.8%). McCouch et al.21 reported that AT-rich motifs in rice have a larger number of repeats and longer repeat tracks than other dinucleotide motifs and were associated with high rates of polymorphism. In our study, the most repetitive SSR motif with a perfect repeat was (TAT)65 in the AT-rich SSR marker SB4593. Moreover, the mean repeat number for the (AT/TA)n motif with three or more repeats was 6.74, which is approximately twice the mean repeat number of 3.31 calculated for the (CG/GC)n motif. We therefore concluded that sorghum SSR markers with an AT-rich motif would show higher polymorphism than SSR markers with other dinucleotide motifs.Distributions of the 10 most common SSR motifs in the data set of 5599 newly developed SSR markers (which are described in Supplementary Table S1)aPosition of SSR marker could not be determined by means of ePCR program.Distributions of the 10 most common SSR motifs in the data set of 5599 newly developed SSR markers (which are described in Supplementary Table S1)aPosition of SSR marker could not be determined by means of ePCR program.WGS sequence analysis by means of methylation filtration15 is likely to lead to the design of SSR markers from hypomethylated or low-copy regions of the sorghum genome. Bedell et al.15 revealed a 200% increase in the number of SSRs in WGS sequences identified by means of methylation filtration compared with the number identified without filtration and an increase in the overall proportion of GC-rich trinucleotide sequences. Similarly, we found that the most frequent trinucleotide motif was GC-rich (CGC/GCG)n and that the rate of appearance of this motif was 3.9%. GC-rich and trinucleotide motifs have also been reported as highly frequent motifs among the documented SSRs found in expressed sequence tags of wheat,22 barley,23 sugarcane,24 perennial ryegrass25 and maize.26 GC-rich and trinucleotide-based microsatellites are most likely to be derived from the coding region of the genome.Map positions for 89.5% (5012 of 5599) of the markers were provided by means of ePCR. Failures to obtain map positions for some 10.5% of the markers may have resulted from the design of the primers on the basis of the WGS sequences of the male-sterile line ATx623, which would not have been mapped when the Sbi1 data derived from the male sterility-maintenance line BTx623 were used for ePCR analysis. To identify target genes and analyze quantitative trait loci in detail, it is necessary to prioritize the development of markers in gene-rich regions. The distribution of our SSR markers appears to be preferentially located at positions with 34 008 gene loci (Fig. 1), and it can be attributed to WGS sequences covering 96% of the sorghum genes over 65% of the genome length.15 The low number of designed SSR markers near the centromeres of the chromosomes is consistent with the low annotation rate for genes at these locations (Fig. 1). It is possible that these loci correspond to methylated or multi-copied genes.Distribution of SSR markers within the sorghum chromosomes. Bars at each chromosome represent the positions of the 34 008 gene loci,16 SSR markers developed in this study, polymorphic SSR markers without an AT/TA motif detected by means of fragment analysis and published SSR markers6–9,11 from left to right.

Positional information for loci was extracted from within the Sbi1_4 annotation database, and all sequence data sets for the chromosomes were used only for SSR mapping by means of ePCR.The ePCR mapping of 317 SSR markers established in previous studies6–9,11 identified the chromosomal locations of 260 of the markers, of which 21 had 50 bp or more of their sequences in common (Supplementary Table S2). This result shows that 239 of the previous SSR markers have different positions within the sorghum genome. A comparison of the distribution of the 5012 markers identified here with the distribution of the 239 non-redundant markers revealed that only 61 of the 5012 markers had 50 bp or more of their sequences in common within the 10 sorghum chromosomes (Supplementary Table S3). Furthermore, Fig. 1 shows that the previously reported SSR markers covered only a small proportion of sorghum’s chromosomes. In particular, there was only one marker (Xtxp6) on the short arm of chromosome 6. Together, these results show that most of the SSR markers in the set designed here are unique and cover the regions that currently lack a sufficient number of SSR markers in each sorghum chromosome.We mapped a set of 970 randomly chosen markers that had fewer AT/TA repeats to possible chromosome locations by means of ePCR and tested the results by means of fragment analysis. Forward and reverse primers were redesigned to provide accurate genotyping with post-PCR fluorescent labeling. AC, AG or AT was added to the 5′ end of the forward primers, and GTTT was added to the 5′ end of the reverse primers. PCR amplification was then performed and the PCR product was directly labeled with fluorescence-labeled R110-ddUTP by the single-tube method.27 The labeled PCR products were then diluted and mixed with Hi-Di formamide containing a size standard. The heat-denatured products were then analyzed with an ABI Prism 3700 Genetic Analyzer, and the resulting allele data were analyzed with GeneMapper v3.7 software.We screened for SSR polymorphisms among a total of 12 lines: four male sterility-maintenance sorghum lines (BTx623, BTx624, MS79B, Nakei MS-3B), seven inbred lines (74LH3213, Challwaxy Sorghum, JN43, SIL-05, bmr-6, Sennkinnshiro, Takakibi) and one sudangrass line (Greenleaf). To do so, we used the following criteria to define the fragment size that would be used for genotyping. (i) If successful amplification was observed for BTx623 and the size difference was ≤5 bp between the fragment size closest to the expected PCR size in BTx623 and the expected fragment size in BTx623, then the corresponding SSR marker was used for the subsequent analysis. (ii) An SSR polymorphism was detected on the basis of a difference of ≥2 bp between the corresponding fragment sizes of each combination in the 12 lines. The mean frequency of total SSR polymorphisms between any two of the 12 lines (Table 2) was nearly identical to that used for calculating both the gene diversity index (D)28 and the degree of differentiation (δT).29Mean rates (%) of SSR polymorphisms detected by means of fragment analysis in 11 sorghum lines and one sudangrass line (Greenleaf)Values represent total frequencies of SSR polymorphisms.

These results are consistent with previous reports of the successful amplification of 90%8 and 85%7 of target SSRs. Moreover, 67.8% (658 of 970) of the SSR markers used for successful amplification in BTx623 revealed a PCR product size that corresponded to the expected product size (Supplementary Table S4). The genotypes of the 12 lines were determined by means of PCR amplification using the 658 primer sets. The mean value of the SSR polymorphisms was 45.1% between any two lines in all 12 lines, including sudangrass (Table 2). The combinations between pairs of sorghum lines (i.e. excluding sudangrass) showed a lower polymorphism rate (43.0%, Table 2). However, the mean difference was only 2.1%, which is not high. In previous studies, mean values of polymorphism rate for SSR loci were reported as 0.546 and 0.698, but these values were detected by using gel electrophoresis, which has lower sensitivity than fragment analysis. Moreover, in a previous report of fragment analysis,9 the estimated polymorphism rate (46.0%) was similar to our mean value of SSR polymorphisms (45.1%). This suggests that the SSR polymorphism rate might be affected more by differences in the materials used in the experiments than by the sensitivity of the analytical methods.In general, the diversity of SSRs developed from cDNA-derived RFLP probe sequences is lower than the genetic variation detected by using SSR loci isolated from SSR-enriched genomic libraries. Schloss et al.9 also suggested that the low variation in SSR loci developed from RFLP probes was associated with a small proportion of dinucleotide motifs and differences in the length of the repeat units. Because of problems related to stutter and noise, we did not attempt to validate SSR markers with the (AT/TA)n motif by using fragment analysis. However, if a set of SSR marker motifs contains markers with an (AT/TA)n motif and an alternative highly sensitive method could be used for polymorphism detection, we would expect to see the same or a higher level of diversity than obtained here, since the AT-rich motif has a greater number of repeat units than most other motifs (Table 1).We did not observe a clear correlation between the distributions of the number of SSR motifs on each chromosome. The distribution of the 558 SSR markers for which we detected polymorphisms in the combination of the 12 lines appears in Fig. 1. These markers were not remarkably localized on each chromosome compared with the distribution of 239 previously developed markers. These results suggest that whether or not newly developed SSR markers include an (AT/TA)n motif, these markers will be helpful in the construction of a linkage map for molecular dissection of sorghum’s agronomic traits.Validation data from our fragment analyses allowed estimation of the polymorphism frequency within the 5012 loci. When the rate of successful amplification with BTx623 was 67.8% and the mean value of the SSR polymorphisms was 45.1%, ∼3400 (67.8% of 5012) were identified as suitable markers for the detection of SSR polymorphisms among Sorghum spp. lines and ∼1500 (45.1% of 3400) markers could potentially indicate SSR polymorphisms in the combinations of Sorghum spp. lines. From this result and an estimated total genomic sequence length of 750 Mb, we estimated that the density of SSR markers developed here for use in polymorphism detection would be approximately one per 220 kb. However, because the gene-rich region and the newly developed markers tend to be located at positions away from the centromere, the distance between the SSR markers is likely to be <220 kb in the gene-rich regions. For this reason, the SSR markers developed here have the potential to be utilized not only as DNA markers for use in breeding but also as a means of map-based cloning. The use of public genomic sequences may provide additional markers in regions with fewer SSR markers.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available online at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by a grant from the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Japan (Genomics for Agricultural Innovation, SOR 0006).Supplementary data",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IntroductionHuman endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) are constitutive elements of the human genome.1 Now transmitted exclusively in a Mendelian way, they derived through infectious retrovirus integration in the germ-line DNA and transmission to the offspring, millions of years ago. Different waves of retroviral endogenization and expansion by retrotranspositional events (copying mechanism) led to the formation of at least 31 phylogenic multicopy families of HERVs, corresponding to over 400 000 HERV copies, dispersed throughout the genome.2 Because of the accumulation of mutations, the contemporary HERV families consist of collections of heterogeneous HERV elements, ranging from full-length proviruses [gag, pol and env gene sequences flanked at each extremity by a long terminal repeat (LTR)] to isolated LTRs derived from inter-LTR recombination events.Some families or family members of HERVs are naturally expressed in particular physiological contexts and display physiological functions. This is not only the case in several LTRs active as alternative promoters of cellular genes in placenta3,4 but also in proviruses driving the expression of their own retroviral protein, e.g. ERVWE1, ERVFRDE1 and ERV3, three phylogenically unrelated proviruses highly active in the placenta. ERVWE1 belongs to the HERV-W family and contains gag and pol pseudogenes but its envelope gene ORF has been preserved (for review see Gimenez and Mallet5). This domesticated envelope, dubbed Syncytin-1, was demonstrated to be involved in trophoblast fusion occurring during placental development6 and was also recently proposed to exert anti-apoptotic function7 and to induce proliferation.8 The ERVFRDE1 provirus from the HERV-FRD family9 and the ERV3/envR provirus from the ERV3/HERV-R family10 also code for functional envelope proteins that probably play a role in placental development, i.e. Syncytin-2 and ERV3 Env, respectively.9,11,12 Syncytin-2, which is fusogenic9 and immunosuppressive,13 appears strictly expressed in placenta.11,14 In contrast, ERV3 Env, which inhibits cell proliferation15 and exhibits immunosuppressive properties,13 is transcribed at various levels in almost all investigated tissues.11,16,17 Except for these few examples of localized physiological activities, HERV elements appear essentially silent in somatic cells.HERV silencing is thought to be the result of the methylation of the LTRs (5′ LTR, 3′ LTR or solo LTR), which, as for infectious retroviruses, contain the regulatory elements and, in particular, the retroviral promoter in the LTR U3-subregion. This epigenetic process, which occurs in mammals on cytosines of 5′CpG dinucleotides, has the property to block the regulatory function of the targeted sequence.18,19 It is believed to have evolved primarily as a defense mechanism against the possible deleterious effects of retroelements and repeated sequences.20 Indeed, whole genome methylation studies showed that repeated elements, including HERVs, are globally methylated in normal somatic cells.21–23 Methylation-mediated repression of HERV LTRs activity was illustrated in vitro by methylation assays on functional HERV-K 5′LTRs.24 Conversely, demethylation-mediated derepression of copies from the HERV-K (HML-2) and HERV-E families was illustrated in cell culture by the use of the demethylating agent 5′-aza-deoxycytidine.25,26In vivo HERV transcripts have been detected in numerous pathological situations and predominantly in autoimmune/inflammatory diseases26–30 and tumoral contexts.31–34 Methylation deregulations are strongly associated with tumors,22,23 and interestingly, tumoral transcriptional reactivations of HERVs have been associated with LTRs hypomethylation for some contexts when compared with normal tissues. This is the case of one HERV-H copy in gastrointestinal cancers,35 several HERV- K members in urothelial carcinomas36 and human primary testicular tumors25 and the HERV-W family in ovarian carcinomas.37Thus, the impact of DNA methylation in the control of HERV elements seems obvious. However, HERV methylation status in physiological conditions has been less considered. HERV-E LTRs acting as alternative promoters of cellular genes in placenta were shown to be unmethylated in this tissue, but hypermethylated in blood where they do not exert promoter function.38 Likewise, the expression of the domesticated ERVWE1 locus has been correlated with hypomethylation of its 5′LTR in placenta in comparison with other tissues.39 Thus, HERV activity in physiological context seems related to a lack of methylation. The HERV-W family contains ∼80 full-length proviruses with flanking LTRs, 200 retrosequences with incomplete LTRs and 400 solitary LTRs.40,41 However, in contrast to ovarian carcinoma, expression of HERV-W family in placenta mainly results from the activity of the ERVWE1 locus.42 The high and specific placental expression of ERVWE1 has been attributed to the co-optation of its own retroviral promoter, localized in the 5′ LTR, with an LTR retrotransposon of MaLR (mammalian apparent LTR retrotransposon) type, acting as a trophoblast-specific enhancer (TSE).43–46 Still neither the methylation status of this enhancer LTR nor the methylation status of family related LTRs is known. Similarly, the methylation status of other proviruses producing envelope proteins, like ERVFRDE1 and ERV3, are unknown.Generally, the features determining HERV methylation status are unknown. In addition, it remains poorly understood whether methylation not only can repress but also regulate HERV activity. Here, we asked whether ERVWE1 5′LTR methylation is related to the HERV family, the LTR role, the LTR-surrounding genomic context, the tissue or the implication of its envelope gene in a physiological process. For this purpose, we investigated and compared the methylation profiles of ERVWE1 5′LTR with ERVWE1 MaLR LTR enhancer, different HERV-W LTRs and the 5′LTRs from HERVs probably involved in placenta development and maintenance. Whether transcriptional activity and methylation were correlated was further addressed using model cell lines.2. Materials and methods2.1. Biological samplesPlacental tissues from the first trimester legally induced abortions (8–12 weeks of gestation) were obtained from the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Broussais, Saint Vincent de Paul and Cochin Hospitals. Second trimester placental tissues were collected at the time of termination of pregnancy at 15 and 25 weeks of gestation (in weeks of amenorrhea) in trisomy 21-affected pregnancies. Fetal Down syndrome was diagnosed by karyotyping of amniotic fluid cells. The indication of amniocentesis was the maternal age. Term placentas were obtained after elective cesarean section from healthy mothers near term with uncomplicated pregnancies. With written informed consent of the pregnant woman, the following samples were collected at term: a fragment of the placenta, umbilical cord fetal blood and maternal blood. The placenta biopsy sample was collected at a depth of 1 cm and at a distance of 8 cm from the edge of the placenta, with the maternal side facing upward. The use of these biological samples was approved by local ethical committee. Villous cytotrophoblastic cells were isolated by sequential enzymatic digestion of chorionic villi from the first trimester, second trimester and term placenta and purified on a discontinuous percoll gradient, as described previously.47–49 These cells were positively stained for cytokeratin 7 at 95%, indicating the cytotrophoblastic origin of the cells. Placental fibroblasts were isolated by prolonged enzymatic digestion from first trimester chorionic villi as in Malassine et al.50 Fibroblastic cells (1.25 × 105 cells/mL) were plated on 35-mm plastic dishes (TPP, Switzerland) and cultured for 48 h, and the culture medium was changed daily. These cultured fibroblasts were characterized using immunocytochemistry. It was found that 98% of the cells were vimentin positive and also positive for a monoclonal antibody against specific fibroblast antigen (clone ASO2, Dianova, Hamburg, Germany). Owing to the limited amount of cells, only DNA was extracted.2.2. Cell linesHuman choriocarcinoma cells BeWo b30 were cultured in F-12K medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (Invitrogen). Human ovarian carcinoma cells OVCAR-3 were cultured in the RPMI 1460 medium supplemented with 20% FCS (LGC Promochem, Molsheim, France). Human astrocytoma cells 85HG66 were cultured in the DMEM medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FCS (Invitrogen). Monocytoid cells U937 were cultured in the RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FCS. All media were supplemented with antibiotics, i.e. 100 IU of penicillin/mL, 100 µg of streptomycin/mL and 0.25 µg/mL amphotericin B (Fungizone) (Invitrogen). Cells were maintained in culture until confluence before DNA and RNA extractions.2.3. Sodium bisulfite modification of genomic DNAGenomic DNA from confluent cell lines, blood samples and villous placenta section was isolated using the Nucleospin®Blood or Tissue kit following the manufacturer's instructions (Macherey-Nagel). Genomic DNA from cytotrophoblasts and placental fibroblasts was obtained following the overnight proteinase K lysis and phenol extraction procedure.51 To perform methylation studies, genomic DNA was submitted to sodium bisulfite treatment. This procedure converts all methyl-free cytosines into uracils, whereas methylated cytosines remain unchanged. For each sample, 1 µg of genomic DNA was mixed with 3 µg of carrier pUC18 DNA in a final volume of 100 µL. The mixture was heated for 10 min at 65°C, and the DNA denatured in 20 µL NaOH 3N for 30 min at 37°C. To convert unmethylated cytosines, denatured DNA was incubated in 50 µL hydroquinone 0.1M and 350 µL sodium bisulfite 3M for 16 h at 50°C. Modified DNA was then purified using Wizard DNA Clean-up System (Promega) and eluted in 50 µL of sterile water. DNA modification was completed by incubation in 5 µL NaOH 3N for 15 min at room temperature. DNA was washed by precipitation for 30 min at −20°C in 10 µL of ammonium acetate 5M and 200 µL of absolute ethanol, followed by centrifugation at 13 000 rpm at 4°C for 10 min. An additional wash was realized by centrifugation in 500 µL ethanol 70% for 5 min. The DNA pellet was eluted in 30 µL of sterile water.2.4. DNA methylation analysesStrand-specific primers were designed to specifically amplify the HERV LTR copy of interest on bisulfite modified DNA by nested PCR (Table 1). First-round PCR was accomplished in a 50 µL mixture containing 3 µL of modified DNA, 0.66 µM of each primer, 1 mM of each dNTP, 1 U of DyNAzyme polymerase (Fynnzyme), 1× Mg-free DyNAzyme buffer (Fynnzyme) and 1.5 mM MgCl2 (Fynnzyme). PCR cycling conditions were: 5 min at 94°C; 35 cycles as follows: 1 min at 94°C, 2 min at a temperature depending on the primer set (Table 1), 1 min at 72°C; and a final extension at 72°C for 5 min. Nested PCR was performed on 1 µL of the first PCR products with internal primers in the same reaction mixture conditions. Nested PCR cycling conditions were 5 min at 94°C; 30 cycles as follows: 1 min at 94°C, 1 min at a temperature depending on a primer set (Table 1), 1 min at 72°C; and a final extension at 72°C for 5 min. PCR fragments were gel-extracted, cloned and sequenced using plasmid forward and reverse primers. To determine CpG methylation, and cytosine conversion rate, the sequence of each clone was aligned and compared with the in silico modified reference sequence (with all cytosines converted into thymines independently of their context). CpG positions were located and the methylation status at each CpG site observed. To prevent false-positive interpretation, only sequences with more than 95% of converted bases (all cytosines out of CpG context) were taken in analyses. Independence of the sequences was determined based either on their within-sample unique methylation pattern and/or on unique non-conversion of cytosines out of CpG context. For some samples, conversion rate was too high to determine the molecular independence of sequences based on unconverted cytosines. In these cases, more than 10 sequences were systematically analyzed to ensure methylation pattern representativity, and results were confirmed on other samples.Primer sets used for determination of HERV LTRs methylationaNucleotides in bold and lowercase letters represent changes in primers relative to the genomic sequence due to bisulfite treatment, as follows: t is C and a is G in the untreated sequence.

Real-time qRT–PCRHERV LTR-derived transcript-specific primer sequences were determined using Oligo 6 software (MBI, Cascade, USA) or taken from published work (Table 2). Systems specificity was checked by in silico PCR on the human genome (UCSC Genome Browser: http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgPcr; reference assembly: March 2006).Primer sets used for analyses of HERV LTR-derived transcriptional activityaFrom De Parseval et al.11Primer sets used for analyses of HERV LTR-derived transcriptional activityaFrom De Parseval et al.11Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Midi Kit including an on-column DNAse treatment in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). RNA quantity was measured at OD260 in a spectrophotometer, and RNA quality was assessed with a Bioanalyzer capillary electrophoresis device (Agilent, Palo Alto, USA). For each sample, 5 µg of total RNA was converted into cDNA in a final volume of 20 µL with random hexamer primers using ThermoScript RT–PCR System for first-strand cDNA synthesis (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's recommendations. Reverse-transcriptase-free reactions were carried out simultaneously to verify the absence of contaminating genomic DNA.Real-time PCRs were performed with the Stratagene Mx3005P quantitative PCR system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) using the SYBR (with dissociation curve) option. Each quantitative PCR was performed on 10 µL of 100-fold diluted cDNA, in a PCR mix containing 0.2 µM of individual target primers, 10 µL of 2× Brilliant SYBR Green QPCR Master Mix (Stratagene) and water to reach a volume of 25 µL. Housekeeping genes were analyzed in the same experiment as the target transcripts. The experiments were performed in duplicate and included RT-minus controls. Following a 10 min denaturation at 95°C, gene amplification was performed as follows: 40 cycles at 95°C for 30 s, 55°C for 1 min and 72°C for 30 s. Melting curve acquisition was performed within a 55–95°C range, and resulting amplicons were sequenced and analyzed to check for false-positive detection. 18S and HPRT were the most stable housekeeping genes among the samples (variation less than a factor of 4.05 and 4.25, respectively). The geometric mean of their expression average was calculated and used to normalize for differences in the amount of total RNA added to the reaction. The relative quantification of transcripts was then calculated with respect to an external standard calibration curve established using serial dilutions of purified genomic DNA amplification products. The copy number of LTR-derived transcripts was related to 1000 cells, corresponding to ∼12.5 ng of total RNA.2.6. In vitro methylation of ERVWE1 promoter constructs and luciferase assaysTo investigate the influence of methylation on the different regulatory regions of the ERVWE1 promoter activity, we used the previously described reporter plasmid pGL3-basic firefly luciferase HW-67/310 (TSE-U3), HW-1/310 (U3 full-length) and HW-90/310 (minimal promoter) constructs.43 Three micrograms of each pGL3-LTR vectors were methylated in a reaction mix containing 4 U of SssI CpG methylase, 1× NEBuffer 2 and 160 µM S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM) in a final volume of 20 µL (New England Biolabs). The methylation reactions were realized at 37°C and stopped after 30, 60, 120 and 240 min by heat inactivation of SssI at 65°C for 20 min. The negative control (no methylation) underwent the same treatment lacking SAM. To determine the methylation level of each reaction, 500 ng aliquots were digested with 0.5 U BstUI methylation-sensitive endonuclease (New England Biolabs) in 1× NEBuffer for 1 h at 60°C, and restriction profiles were analyzed after electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel. BeWo b30 choriocarcinoma cells at 60–70% confluence were seeded in 12-well plates. Twenty-four hours later, cells were co-transfected with 0.7 µg of pGL3-LTR firefly luciferase plasmid either methylated or not (-SAM) and 35 ng of pRL-TK Renilla luciferase plasmid for internal standardization (Kit Dual-Luciferase® Reporter Assay System, Promega) by use of Lipofectamine Plus (GibcoBRL-Life Technologies, Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer. Cells were lysed 24 h after transfection with passive lysis buffer (Promega). Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured by using the Dual-Luciferase® Reporter Assay 1000 System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Promoter activities were normalized to the internal Renilla luciferase control, i.e. (Firefly luciferase activity/Renilla luciferase activity) × 100. All reporter gene assays were performed in triplicate.3. Results and discussion3.1. Methylation of HERV-W LTRs in placenta and placenta-associated tissuesERVWE1/Syncytin-1 (Ch7q21.2; AC007566) transcription is regulated by two distinct elements, i.e. the ERVWE1 5′LTR U3 promoter region and an adjacent upstream TSE. This enhancer is located within a MaLR solo LTR within which the ERVWE1 provirus integrated ∼25–40 millions years ago.43,46 We chose to analyze together the methylation status of these two co-opted but unrelated LTRs involved in Syncytin-1 regulation, further referred to as MaLR[LTR]–ERVWE1[5′LTR]. As a minimal model to test the family related methylation process hypothesis, three other HERV-W LTRs were studied: ERVWE1[3′LTR], HW_4[5′LTR] and HW_12[solo LTR]. ERVWE1[3′LTR] is the 3′LTR of ERVWE1 provirus and represents topographically and phylogenetically the closest HERV-W LTR relative to ERVWE1[5′LTR]. HW_4[5′LTR] is an another functional (data not shown) 5′LTR belonging to a HERV-W provirus located on chromosome 4 (Ch4p13; AC024 022). HW_12[solo LTR] is a full-length solitary HERV-W LTR localized on chromosome 12 (Chr12q24.32; AC005868), and a cDNA overlapping the 51 bp at the 3′ end of the U5 region was found to have 100% identity with this part of the U5 region (BC038735). These HERV-W LTRs exhibit common but also specific CpG sites. An alignment of the investigated LTR U3 regions with highlighted CpG location is presented in Fig. 1. About 200 bp of the upstream env region from the ERVWE1[3′LTR] and ∼100 bp of the upstream region from the HW_4[5′LTR], which contains a MER110 type LTR, were co-amplified with the respective HERV-W LTRs as controls of genomic environment methylation.Alignment of HERV-W LTR U3 promoter. ERVWE1[5′LTR] and ERVWE1[3′LTR] U3 region allelic forms were previously determined on DNA amplified from 24 individuals (e.g. -132A. individual 132, allele A), i.e. 48 sequences.45 HW_12[solo LTR] and HW_4[5′LTR] allelic forms derive from the annotated genome sequence (-A, reference allele; -B, alternative allele; SNP ID, rs6489086). Proportion of each allelic form is given in hooks (e.g. [3], 3 of the 48 sequences hold this allelic form; [nd], not determined). CAAT box, TATA box and transcription binding sites are indicated. Effective transcription factor binding sites are underlined; putative transcription factor binding sites are marked by interrupted lines. CpG sites are indicated by gray background, their position in the U3 region is given relative to ERVWE1 5′LTR sequence.Alignment of HERV-W LTR U3 promoter.

Methylation was determined by bisulfite sequencing PCR in villous trophoblast of term placenta, related fetal and maternal blood cells and in placental fibroblasts from chorionic villi of a first trimester placenta. Each sample result originates from the same conversion reaction. Each line represents an independent clone as determined by methylation and/or conversion differences. Methylated CpG are schematized by black circles, unmethylated CpGs by white circles, the mutated CpG (SNP) in HW_12 is represented by a cross and CpGs with undetermined methylation state by gray circles. Global methylation percentages in the U3 regions (highlighted in gray) as well as in the upstream regions (MaLR LTR, env, MER114 LTR) are given below the respective area for each sample (in parentheses for non-U3 regions).The phylogenetically related HERV-W LTRs schematized in Fig. 2A were found highly methylated in a majority of the investigated normal tissues (Fig. 2B–E). In blood particularly, the high global methylation of the HERV-W LTRs (from 85% to 98.2% of methylated CpGs) was similar to the methylation range observed for various LTRs of another HERV family, namely HERV-E.38 In placental fibroblast, all LTRs were also highly methylated (76.9–93.9% of methylated CpGs) except for HW_12[solo LTR] whose methylation level was found at its lowest (38.5%).The villous placenta appeared to be the tissue with the lower level of methylation for all the LTRs except HW_12[solo LTR]. In spite of it, both the methylation levels and the methyl-group distribution within the molecules were different between the LTRs. Thus, CpG methylation level was low for ERVWE1[5′LTR] and HW_4[5′LTR] (∼40%), whereas it was relatively high for ERVWE1[3′LTR] (∼70%) and even higher for HW_12[solo LTR] (∼80%). Methyl-group distribution on ERVWE1[5′LTR] was bimodal, as molecules were either unmethylated (7 out of 12 clones) or densely methylated. This feature, first described by Matouskova et al.,39 appeared to be specific to ERVWE1 promoter. The methylation defaults on the other HERV-W LTRs were more diffusely distributed. Thus, some molecules were found repeatedly unmethylated on definite CpG sites, solely or together with contiguous CpGs (e.g. the first CpG of ERVWE1[3′LTR] and the second CpG of HW_4[5′LTR]), but no molecule was found fully unmethylated. On the contrary, some other CpG sites were found constitutively methylated (e.g. the first CpG of HW_4[5′LTR], the last CpG of ERVWE1[3′LTR] and the last two CpGs of HW_12[solo LTR]).Interestingly in this tissue, the CpG site located at the end of the ERVWE1[5′LTR] ER binding site and conserved in ERVWE1[3′LTR] and HW_4[5′LTR] was not methylated in approximately the same proportion of clones in both LTRs (e.g. in 7 out of 10 clones and 9 out of 10 clones, respectively). Likewise, the CpG located before the TATA box, conserved in ERVWE1[3′LTR] and HW_12[solo LTR], was not methylated in 4 out of 10 clones and 4 out of 12 clones. However, other conserved CpGs did not have the same pro-rata of methylation default (e.g. the CpG at the U3/R border was not methylated in 2 out of 10 clones of ERVWE1[3′LTR] and 7 out of 10 of HW_4[5′LTR] and none of HW_12[solo LTR]), indicating that the ER binding site and TATA-box-associated CpGs might have particular methylation-targeting features.These results demonstrate that LTRs from the same phylogenetic lineage can be unequally methylated within the same cellular type, suggesting that methylation establishment on HERV sequences might not be family dependent.By definition, ERVWE1[5′LTR] and ERVWE1[3′LTR] belong to the same proviral unit, but appeared differentially methylated in villous placenta. This unmethylation of the 5′LTR corresponds with its promoter function in placenta, as reported previously.39 The 3′LTR methylation in return may prevent a local competition with ERVWE1 5′LTR for promoter activity as well as a 3′LTR-derived transcriptional interference with the nearby antisense-oriented ODAG/GATAD1 gene.46 Such a differential methylation has been observed for HTLV-152 and HIV-1 proviruses during viral latency.53 For these two retroviruses, however, methylation favored repression of the 5′LTR promoter activity as the 5′LTR was methylated and the 3′LTR was not. This suggests different methylation features for exogenous/pathogenic and endogenous/domesticated proviruses but possibly a conserved strategy to prevent methylation spreading on both proviral LTRs, like the use of boundary elements as hypothesized for HTLV-1.52 The CTCF protein is a factor able to create boundaries between methylated and unmethylated genomic domains.54 Interestingly, two domains containing potential binding sites for CTCF were identified within ERVWE1 provirus (www.essex.ac.uk/bs/molonc/spa.htm), respectively, downstream from the 5′ LTR and upstream from the 3′ LTR region that we found methylated. Further investigations are required to ascertain CTCF functional relevance in the context of proviruses. Nevertheless, it appears that methylation might be regionally controlled and linked either to the genomic environment or to the LTR function.The upstream flanking sequence of three out of the four HERV-W LTRs was amplified along with the respective LTRs. Except for one clone in the villous placenta tissue, the MaLR[LTR] directly upstream from ERVWE1 presented the same methylation profiles as the ERVWE1[5′LTR], i.e. either unmethylated, partially methylated or highly methylated (for methylation values, see Fig. 2B). In contrast, the CpG sites contained within the ∼200 bp of the env gene co-amplified with ERVWE1[3′LTR] appeared systematically highly methylated, including those in the villous placenta (with 92.5% of methylation level), despite a lower methylation (68%) of the 3′LTR in this tissue (Fig. 2C). Finally, methylation levels between HW_4[5′LTR] and the upstream MER114[LTR] part were similar in PBL and placental fibroblasts, but in the villous placenta, HW_4[5′LTR] methylation level was much lower (40%) than the MER114 (70%) (Fig. 2D). Thus, except for ERVWE1[5′LTR] and the upstream MaLR[LTR], there was no clear correlation between the methylation of the HERV-W LTRs and their flanking sequence. Reiss et al.38 also recently concluded that the hypomethylation of HERV-E LTRs acting as placenta promoters of cellular genes, when compared with random LTRs, cannot be explained by a difference in methylation of their flanking sequences, irrespective of its nature—repeated element or not.The MaLR[LTR] and the ERVWE1[5′LTR] elements have been earlier demonstrated to be co-opted and to specifically control ERVWE1 placental expression.43,46 Thus, although belonging to distinct LTR types, their shared unmethylation status in placenta could be linked to their involvement in the regulation of Syncytin-1 tra",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
scription. Likewise, the heavy methylation of both LTRs in non-placenta cells supports a repression process outside placenta. Overall, these results are compatible with ERVWE1 env regulation as a bona fide gene.453.2. 5′LTR methylation of HERVs coding for proteins associated with placenta morphogenesisERVFRDE1 Env (Syncytin-2) and ERV3 Env together with ERVWE1 Env (Syncytin-1) are the three retroviral envelope proteins exhibiting a probable function in placenta development.55 Syncytin-2 and ERV3 Env are, respectively, encoded by ERVFRDE1, a provirus belonging to the HERV-FRD family (HERV-FRD_6p24.1; AL136139) and the provirus ERV3 belonging to the ERV3/HERV-R family (HERV-R_7q11.2; AC073210). LTR borders and transcription start sites have already been published for ERVWE1 and ERV3.12,43 ERVFRDE1 LTR borders limits were determined using the RepeatMasker software (www.repeatmasker.org). ERVFRDE1[5′LTR] U3/R boundary, delineating the transcription start site, was located at nt +492 or nt +504 from the [5′LTR] 5′ end, using four human placental full-length or 5′ end containing mRNAs displaying more than 99% identity with ERVFRDE1 genomic sequence (BC068585, AK123938, AL543429 and CR626159).We investigated and compared the 5′LTR methylation profiles of ERVWE1, ERVFRDE1 and ERV3 proviruses (schematized in Fig. 3A), in the same placenta-associated tissues as done for HERV-W LTRs. It appeared that all three 5′LTRs shared a common lack of methylation in villous placenta but under different modalities. In addition, their methylation was widely variable in the non-trophoblastic cells associated with the placenta.CpG methylation envelope-coding HERV 5′LTRs in placenta-associated tissues.

Global methylation percentage values in the U3 regions (highlighted in gray) as well as in the MaLR[LTR] (in parentheses) are given below the respective area for each sample.In villous placenta, ERVWE1[5′LTR] had a global methylation level of 36.7%, and molecules were bimodally methylated, as mentioned above. An important amount of unmethylated molecules (7 out of 12 clones) was observed (Fig. 3B). In contrast, methylation of ERVFRDE1[5′LTR] was close to zero in the villous placenta, as only two CpGs were methylated in the whole sample (Fig. 3C). Finally, methylation of ERV3[5′LTR] reached a level of 23.5% and was distributed within three principal patterns (Fig. 3D). Thus, completely unmethylated molecules were found in high proportion (10 clones out of 17), completely methylated molecules were found in very low proportion (2 clones) and the remaining molecules were methylated only at the U3 area borders (5 clones). Although the methylation distribution of ERVWE1, ERVFRDE1 and ERV3 [5′LTRs] was undoubtedly different, an important amount of totally unmethylated clones was found for all three HERV 5′LTRs in agreement with their promoter function and activity in trophoblast.11In placenta-associated non-trophoblastic cells, i.e. PBLs and placental fibroblasts, ERVWE1[5′LTR] was found heavily methylated. ERVFRDE1[5′LTR] was also essentially methylated in placental fibroblasts (77.9%), albeit CpGs 3, 5 and 8 were regularly unmethylated. In fetal cord blood cells on the contrary, the global methylation level of ERVFRDE1[5′LTR] was only 25.3%. This was due to a quasi-systematic but exclusive methylation on the CpGs neighboring the TATA box. This accurate methylation pattern was conserved in maternal blood cells, although an occasional methylation of the second CpG site slightly increased the methylation level up to 30.2%. ERVWE1 high methylation level in non-trophoblastic cells and ERVFRDE1 high methylation in placental fibroblasts are in agreement with the lack of expression previously established for ERVWE1 and ERVFRDE1 env mRNAs in these tissues.11,14,50 In spite of this, there is no trivial link between ERVFRDE1[5′LTR] low methylation level in PBLs and the described weak transcriptional activity of ERVFDRE1 env (200-fold less than in placenta).11 One explanation could be that essential transcription factors needed for ERVFRDE1 transcriptional activity are missing in PBL. Nonetheless, another explanation could be related to the precise and accurate methylation at only the CpGs closed to the TATA box. Such a local methylation was observed for the RANKL gene promoter and impaired transcriptional induction by disturbing the attachment of the TATA binding protein.56 Contrary to ERVWE1 and ERVFRDE1, methylation patterns of ERV3[5′LTR] in maternal blood cells and placental fibroblasts were highly similar to those found in term trophoblast. However, the proportion of each pattern and consequently the global methylation level varied depending on the sample type. Thus, the global methylation of the ERV3 5′LTR U3 region reached 37.5% in maternal blood (with 6 unmethylated clones out of 16) and 54.6% in placental fibroblasts (with 2 unmethylated clones out of 11). The variation in their relative proportion could explain the variable levels of ERV3 env transcription among human tissues in general and between placenta and PBL11 in particular. An exception to this trend of ERV3[5′LTR] generic methylation patterns was the finding of only one methylated CpG (equivalent to 1.9% of total methylation) in the fetal cord PBLs sample. This lack of methylation was all the more unexpected, since the LTRs of all the other HERVs analyzed in this study had a conserved methylation in fetal and adult PBLs. Whether this lack of methylation correlates with significant ERV3 env mRNA and protein levels in fetal PBLs deserves further investigation.In conclusion, methylation status of these LTRs is globally in adequation with their respective promoter activity and could also be implicated in the modulation of their transcriptional level and consequently in the biological activity of their protein.ERVWE1, ERVFRDE1 and ERV3 env expression is localized in cytotrophoblastic cells of the placenta and is temporally regulated during pregnancy, according to a dynamic specific to each envelope gene. We further investigate whether changes in promoter methylation of the 5′LTR of these HERVs may contribute to the observed transcriptional variations. Analyses were carried out in purified cytotrophoblasts from one normal first trimester placenta (placenta 1.1), trisomic 21 (T-21) second trimester placentas (placentas 2.1 and 2.2) and normal term placentas (placentas 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3) (for clarity, results from one sample for each time of gestation are shown in Fig. 4).CpG methylation dynamics of envelope-coding HERV 5′LTRs in cytotrophoblasts during pregnancy.

One sample is represented here for each trimester i.e. CT of first trimester placenta from legally induced abortion (placenta 1.1), second trimester placenta from trisomy 21-affected pregnancy (T21, placenta 2.2) and term placenta from healthy mother (placenta 3.3).

Each sample result originates from the same conversion reaction. Each line represents an independent molecule. Methylated CpGs are schematized by black circles and unmethylated CpGs by white circles.The bimodal methylation pattern previously observed for the ERVWE1[5′LTR] domain39 and herein shown to equally affect the associated MaLR[LTR] TSE in term villous placenta could have reflected an imprinted regulation of ERVWE1, as was suggested previously.57 This process is regularly mediated by the methylation of one of the two alleles in a parent-of-origin manner and often related to genes involved in placenta morphogenesis.58 However, the bimodal methylation was not clearly observed at all stages of pregnancy. Thus, in the first trimester placenta, the MaLR[LTR]–ERVWE1[5′LTR] was not methylated at all (placenta 1.1 Fig. 4B). Among the two second trimester samples derived from T-21 placentas, placenta 2.1 also showed no methylation at all (not shown), whereas placenta 2.2 presented one fully methylated clone out of 12 (Fig. 4B). In contrast, in all the three CT samples derived from term placenta, the bimodal methylation pattern was clearly observed though with a significant sample-to-sample variation in the proportion of the two methylation patterns. More precisely, the number of methylated clones was 1 out of 12 in placenta 3.1 (not illustrated), 5 out of 12 in placenta 3.2 (not illustrated) and 6 out of 14 in placenta 3.3 (Fig. 4B), respectively. In short, the global amount of methylated CpGs in the MaLR[LTR]–ERVWE1[5′LTR] region varied from 0% in the first trimester placenta to 33.3% at term (as observed in the term placental villi sample). The absence of stability in the bimodal repartition of molecules methylation throughout gestation argues against the proposed imprinting hypothesis. In contrast, the apparent increased frequency of hypermethylated sequences from first trimester to term is consistent with the decrease in ERVWE1 env expression observed between 37 and 40 weeks of gestation.59 In addition, the sample-to-sample variations are compatible with the inter-individual variation observed for the ERVWE1 expression level.59 Consequently, ERVWE1 env mRNA down-regulation in placental dysfunction59,60 could be related to an early remethylation of ERVWE1 promoter. The discovery of a single atypical clone exhibiting a methylated MaLR[LTR] and an unmethylated ERVWE1[5′LTR] in villous placenta (Fig. 3B) may reflect a ‘targeted’ remethylation process that would deserve further investigation.Contrary to ERVWE1, ERVFRDE1[5′LTR] was stably unmethylated in normal first and term cytotrophoblasts as well as in second trimester T-21 cytotrophoblasts, as overall methylation in the samples did not exceed 5.7% (0%, 5.7% and 2.7% in placenta 1.1, 2.2 and 3.3, respectively, see Fig. 4C; and 1.3%, 5.6% and 3.3% in placenta 2.1, 3.1 and 3.3, respectively, not illustrated). This stable unmethylation allows a constitutive transcriptional activity but cannot account for transcriptional modulations. Thus, ERVFRDE1 env mRNA progressive decrease along gestation61 and down-regulation in T-21 affected placenta62 might preferentially be linked to a modulation of the transcription factor pool rather than to alteration of the LTR methylation.ERV3 [5′LTR] methylation levels [investigated in one representative CT sample for each stage of pregnancy, i.e. placentas 1.1, 2.2 and 3.3 (Fig. 4D)] were somewhat same during all gestation. Hence, in the U3 region, 29.2% of the CpGs were methylated in the first trimester, 18.2% in the second trimester and 25.4% at term. Still, as in ERVWE1, ERV3[5′LTR] methylation pattern did change. However, these changes were not progressive but more drastically linked to the gestation stage, and differences were more particularly obvious between the first and the second trimester. Indeed and interestingly, ERV3[5′LTR] methylation profile in the first trimester was very similar to the one observed for ERVFRDE1[5′LTR] in blood, i.e. precisely and systematically associated with the TATA box. The fact that this precise promoter methylation has been found for the conventional RANKL gene,56 and herein for two unrelated HERVs (ERV3 and ERVFRDE1, see Fig. 3C), might indicate an important regulation mechanism and would have to be studied further. ERV3 expression in placenta along gestation has been described sparsely. However, under the same hypothesis as proposed above for ERVFRDE1, this methylation pattern could correlate with the faint or absent ERV3 env expression in the first trimester highly proliferative CTs.63,64 In the second trimester CT sample, we could observe lower methylation of these CpGs leading to an unmethylated U3 region in 5 of the 11 sequences. In contrast, a new methylation occurred on the first CpG downstream from the LTR on all clones, which was never methylated in the first trimester. Finally, three methylation patterns were observed in term CTs, which were similar to those of the term villous placenta sample. Thus, over the 15 clones analyzed, 8 were completely unmethylated in the U3 area, whereas the others were methylated along the whole U3 region or only on the first and last CpGs. Correlating with ERV3 env highest expression,63,64 the maximal number of unmethylated ERV3[5′LTR] U3 sequences was found at this stage of pregnancy.Altogether, these results support the hypothesis that the transcriptional activity of these domesticated proviruses is epigenetically controlled and that methylation might be further involved in the developmentally associated regulation of, at least, ERVWE1 env and ERV3 env transcriptional levels in placenta and possibly of ERV3 env in PBLs. Whether the epigenetic picture observed in the second trimester reflects the 15–25 weeks of amenorrhea or the T-21 pathological context deserves further investigations.3.3. Association between HERV LTRs methylation and transcriptional activityTo investigate whether a systematic correlation exists between LTRs methylation status and transcriptional activities, we conducted paralleled transcription and methylation analyses in various cell lines, namely BeWo (choriocarcinoma), U937 (monocytes), 85HG66 (astrocytoma) and OVCAR-3 (ovarian carcinoma). Although the situation appears complex (Fig. 5), we identified essentially four situations.LTR promoter methylation and derived transcriptional activity. LTR-derived transcriptional activity in cell lines is represented by histograms, and the associated methylation profiles of the U3 promoter region of the LTRs are represented underneath. Real-time qPCR values were normalized by the geometric mean of HPRT and 18S housekeeping genes average and are expressed in copy number/1000 cells or 12.5 ng total RNA (numbers on the top of each bar). The associated methylation profiles were determined by bisulfite sequencing PCR. Each sample result originates from the same conversion reaction by bisulfite. Each line represents an independent molecule. Methylated CpGs are schematized by black circles and unmethylated CpGs by white circles. Percentage values express the global methylation level in the U3 promoter region. MaLR[LTR] methylation percentages are shown in parentheses.LTR promoter methylation and derived transcriptional activity.

Percentage values express the global methylation level in the U3 promoter region. MaLR[LTR] methylation percentages are shown in parentheses.First, there is a strong correlation between transcription and methylation. Thus, ERVWE1 and ERVFRED1 env transcription in placental BeWo cells was correlated with their 5′LTR fully unmethylated status. Similarly, faint transcription (below 2 copies/10 cell) was mostly associated with a high and homogeneous methylation of LTRs (e.g. ERVWE1[5′LTR] in U397 and ERVFRDE1[5′LTR] in OVCAR-3).Second, comparison of ERVWE1 LTRs and HW_12[solo LTR] suggests that the absence of expression is highly correlated with a huge methylation for functional LTRs (ERVWE1), in contrast to the HW_12[solo LTR] which displays a significant amount of unmethylated U3 regions in 85HG66 and OVCAR-3 cells. This LTR, which exhibits extremely heterogeneous methylation status, is probably not functional; even if we cannot exclude that the lack of related transcription could be attributed to transcription factors paucity.Third, comparison of ERVFRDE1 and HW_4 in 85HG66 suggests different processes impairing the activity of these functional 5′LTRs. ERVFRDE1 lack of expression is surely due to dedicated transcriptional activators deficit rather than methylation as several molecules are unmethylated. In contrast, HW_4 lack of expression could be due to the systematic methylation of the CpGs at the 5′LTR U3/R boundary.The fourth situation, concerning ERV3[5′LTR], is more complex. In U937 cells, the env region was very poorly expressed, although the 5′LTR had, so to say, no methylated CpGs. Yet, this permissive methylation is compatible with the induction of ERV3 env upon U937 stimulation with differentiating agents such as retinoic acid.65 In contrast, in 85HG66, BeWo and to a lesser extent in OVCAR-3, we observed a high expression level of the env region, but meanwhile a strong methylation level of ERV3[5′LTR]. Analysis of ERV3 env containing mRNA using the USCS genome browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks, chr7:64088622–64104466) suggests the existence of an alternative initiation site in addition to the published initiation site in the ERV3[5′LTR].12 The mRNA AK295189, which has 99.8% identity with the genomic sequence, notably supports this. It encompasses the full-length ERV3 env region, but not the retroviral sequence ahead, and starts about 7240 bp upstream from the ERV3[5′LTR] transcription start site. It is thus conceivable that in the cell lines 85HG66, BeWo and possibly in OVCAR-3, the observed transcription is related to such an alternate mRNA form. Alternatively although uncommon, we cannot exclude that the ERV3 promoter contains methylation-dependent transcription factor binding sites, as recently described for Epstein–Barr virus.66ERVWE1 is the only known HERV with a juxtaposed enhancer. This TSE is part of a MaLR LTR, and interestingly, all the MaLR CpG sites are located within the TSE. We were thus interested to know the extent to which methylation of the TSE could influence ERVWE1 transcriptional activity. Progressively 5′deleted MaLR[LTR]–ERVWE1[5′LTR] reporter constructs (simplified ‘TSE-U3’, ‘U3 full-length’ and ‘U3 minimal’ promoters, see Fig. 6A) were gradually methylated, transfected in BeWo cell and analyzed for luciferase activity (Fig. 6B). The TSE-U3 promoter activity was the maximal among the three promoter constructs in unmethylated state, but dropped dramatically when methylated. Thus, after 30 min of methylation (incomplete methylation), we observed a 5.4-fold decrease in comparison with only 3- and 1.8-fold for the U3 full-length and minimal promoters. Still, in this state, the TSE-U3 promoter activity remained the highest with 18.4% of the maximal activity, compared with only 10% for the TSE-deleted construct. Further increase in the methylation time to complete methylation reduced the activities to about the same level, i.e. 12.5% for TSE-U3 promoter, 8.5% for the full-length U3 promoter and 7.6% for the minimal U3 promoter. In line with the observed conjoint methylation status of the MaLR[LTR] and ERVWE1[5′LTR], these results underline the importance of the total absence of methylated CpGs on both LTRs to obtain maximal transcription and, conversely the need of a concomitant methylation of both LTRs for an efficient repression.Effect of CpG methylation on MaLR[LTR]–ERVWE1[5′LTR] promoter strength. (A). Schematic representation of TSE-U3, U3 full-length and U3 minimal promoter constructs. Numbering starts from the first position in ERVWE1 5′LTR. Effective and putative transcription factor binding sites associated with the MaLR[LTR] TSE region (Sp-1, c-myb, GCMA, GATA), with the ERVWE1[5′LTR] U3 5′-subdomain (GATA, Pit-1a, ERalpha, Sp-1, Ap-2 and Oct-1), and CAAT and TATA boxes are indicated by black boxes. CpGs are depicted by circles on vertical bars. (B). Relative promoter activities in BeWo cells following in vitro methylation. pGL-LTR firefly luciferase plasmids were methylated in vitro during 30, 60 and 240 min, with and without -SAM. On the basis of restriction profiles with BstUI enzyme -SAM controls were, as expected, not methylated, and methylation level did not evolve anymore after 60 min indicating a similar methylation at 60 and 240 min.

ConclusionsOur analyses provide evidence that methylation status of ERVWE1 and other HERV-W LTRs are not related to a family/phylogenetically related process, nor are they systematically correlated with the integration surrounding area. However, they support both tissue- and locus-specific methylation processes for functional LTRs. Still, methylation status seems to differ in relation to the promoter/enhancer role of the LTR or its use as polyadenylation signal. In addition, our results suggest that methylation of HERV LTRs could be involved in the modulation of their activity. Thus, this could be achieved in several ways, through an enhancer/promoter epigenetic co-regulation (e.g. MaLR[LTR] and ERVWE1[5′LTR]) or through a variation in cell proportion with unmethylated LTR (e.g. ERVWE1[5′LTR] in CTs) or else, by targeting preferential CpG sites such as CpGs closed to the TATA box (e.g. ERVFRDE1[5′LTR] in PBL, ERV3[5′LTR] in first trimester CTs). Thus, the selective and temporal unmethylation of ERVWE1[5′LTR] in placenta during the first trimester may allow Syncytin-1-mediated cell differentiation/fusion.6 In contrast, increased methylation at term may limit Syncytin-1 production and consequent cell fusion or putative anti-apoptotic protection7 in accordance with CT limited fusion and higher apoptosis rate. Syncytin-1 transcriptional alterations observed in placental pathologies59,60 could similarly be associated with a temporally deregulated methylation of ERVWE1. Likewise, local methylation of the ERV3 promoter during the first trimester may limit ERV3 Env production and consequent inhibition of early CT proliferation.15 In contrast, hypomethylation of ERV3 promoter in the second trimester or term placenta and in fetal blood cells may allow ERV3 Env expression and consequently, contribute to immunosuppression.13 So, apparently convergent tropism and redundant functions, such as fusion for Syncytin-1 (ERVWE1) and Syncytin-2 (ERVFRDE1) or immunosuppression for Synctin-2 and ERV3-Env, do not strictly match with similar methylation regulation. Sequence determinants and mechanisms involved in LTR methylation need to be further investigated to better understand HERV regulations and deregulations associated with pathologies.FundingJG and CM are supported by a doctoral fellowship from bioMerieux.JG performed most of the experimental work and wrote the manuscript; CM participated in molecular studies on LTR methylation; GO, J-PP and KR participated in the molecular studies on transcriptional activities; VT, PG and J-LF carried out placental and blood collection, and the isolation of trophoblastic and fibroblastic cells.

IntroductionSoybean [Glycine max (L.) Merrill] is one of the most important grain legumes because it is a staple source of high-quality vegetable protein and oil for food products and industrial material. Over the past 20 years, the global growing area of soybean has increased by a factor of 1.7, whereas the average yield has increased by a factor of 2.3, reaching 2.5 tons/hectare in 2006.1 However, the rate of growth in soybean yield has declined during the last 10 years, increasing by only 8% in this period. It is therefore imperative to develop new technologies and resources that will allow the supply of soybean to meet the large growth in demand anticipated in the near future.An accurate and well-saturated genetic linkage map is fundamental to modern plant breeding because it allows both the identification of agronomic trait loci, including quantitative trait loci, and an understanding of genetic diversity and genome structure of genetic resources. Furthermore, such a linkage map is required for construction of a physical map. Since the first genetic map of soybean was constructed with phenotypic traits,2 several linkage maps have been developed either alone or in combination with various types of molecular markers such as restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD), amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), simple sequence repeat (SSR) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers.3–7 Among these molecular markers, SSRs (also known as microsatellite markers) possess several favorable features: (i) they are inherited in a codominant manner at individual loci; (ii) they exhibit high levels of polymorphism and exist in multiple alleles; (iii) they are distributed evenly and randomly in the genome and (iv) they can be readily analyzed by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and subsequent gel electrophoresis.5,6,8,9 Multiallelic molecular markers with a high level of polymorphism are useful for the detection of allelic differences among many genetic resources.10–12 SSR markers are applicable to analysis of many of the segregating populations derived from the hybridization of any given genotypes. In addition, most PCR primer pairs for SSR markers yield a single amplification product for each soybean genotype,13 allowing the use of a variety of means for the detection of SSR length polymorphisms. The amplification products are usually analyzed by electrophoresis on a polyacrylamide or agarose gel, but they can also be analyzed with a genetic sequencer in combination with a labeling protocol.6,10,14 Moreover, SSR markers can be genotyped more rapidly and cost efficiently by simultaneous detection of multiple loci with the use of multiplex PCR analysis.15 Such analysis is ideal for high-throughput and repetitive genotyping applications for which common sets of SSR marker loci are advantageous.Given that SSR markers were found to map to individual loci with the same order in three different mapping populations, 606 such loci were integrated and aligned with RFLP, RAPD, AFLP and classical markers into a consensus set of 20 linkage groups (LGs) corresponding to the 20 pairs of soybean chromosomes.16 The integrated linkage map was subsequently updated with 420 newly developed SSR markers and two additional mapping populations, giving a total of 1849 molecular markers including 1015 SSR, 709 RFLP, 73 RAPD, 6 AFLP and 46 classical markers.17,18 The framework of 20 consensus LGs with an average of 50 SSR loci per group has provided a resource for construction of a linkage map for genetic analysis of qualitative and quantitative traits. However, there remain several genomic intervals of at least 20 cM that contain no SSR markers, and the number of SSR markers is not sufficient for application to all hybridizing combinations of germplasm, given that the genome size of soybean is 1.1 Gb.19Xia et al.20 recently developed 702 new SSRs from analysis of genomic DNA or by surveying expressed sequence tag (EST)-derived SSRs in the public database, and 121 of these SSR markers were mapped in an F2 population derived from a cross between the Japanese cultivar Misuzudaizu and the Chinese experimental line Moshidou Gong 503. Additionally, 6920 primer pairs were designed to amplify SSRs from 63 676 non-redundant soybean ESTs available in the public database, and 668 EST-derived SSR markers were assigned to a molecular linkage map constructed with F8 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) of Misuzudaizu × Moshidou Gong 503.21 These new SSR markers enrich and saturate the soybean linkage map and provide a framework for analysis of the entire genome. We have now analyzed polymorphism of the new SSRs between parents of three mapping populations including the Misuzudaizu × Moshidou Gong 503 RIL population, generated three molecular linkage maps in combination with the public SSR markers18 and integrated the new SSR markers into the framework of 20 consensus LGs. In addition, we investigated allelic polymorphism for the mapped EST-derived SSR markers in comparison with the public SSR markers, and we consider the transferability of the new SSR markers in soybean germplasm.2. Materials and methods2.1. Mapping populationsTo develop an integrated linkage map, we used the following three mapping populations. (i) The MM population. This population originates from a cross between the Japanese cultivar Misuzudaizu and the Chinese weedy experimental line Moshidou Gong 503, consists of 165 RILs and has been described previously.22,23 The RILs were available from the National BioResource Project of Lotus and Glycine (http://www.legumebase.agr.miyazaki-u.ac.jp/index.jsp). We studied 94 individual plants representing the F8 generation of the RILs to construct a linkage map.21 (ii) The JF population. This population is derived from a cross between the US cultivar Jack and Fukuyutaka, a leading Japanese cultivar, and comprises 179 RILs. We randomly selected 91 individual plants representing the F7 generation of the RILs and used for mapping. (iii) The PA population. This population is created from a cross between the Chinese cultivar Peking and the Japanese cultivar Akita. We randomly selected 68 individual plants representing the F9 generation of 120 RILs.2.2. DNA extraction and marker analysisTotal genomic DNA was extracted from young leaves or seed flour of individual samples with the use of an Automatic DNA Isolation System PI-50a (Kurabo, Osaka, Japan) according to Plant DNA Extraction Protocol (version 2). The concentration of DNA in solution was quantified by comparison with a serial dilution of lambda phage DNA (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and was then adjusted to 10 ng/µL with sterile water. PCR amplification was performed in a reaction mixture (10 µL) containing 10 ng of total genomic DNA, 0.4 µM of each primer and 5 µL of GoTaq Green Master Mix (Promega) and with the use of a GeneAmp PCR System 9700 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The amplification protocol comprised an initial denaturation for 2 min at 95°C; 30 cycles of denaturation for 30 s at 95°C, annealing for 30 s at 47°C13 or 55°C,20 and extension for 30 s at 72°C; and a final extension for 5 min at 72°C. The EST-derived SSR markers were amplified with the modified ‘Touchdown PCR’ protocol.24 PCR products were resolved by 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in Tris-borate-EDTA (TBE) buffer. The gel was stained with ethidium bromide, and the bands were visualized and photographed under ultraviolet light.2.3. Screening and genotyping of DNA markersSSR markers developed by USDA-ARS (United States Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service) and DuPont Corporation16,18 as well as SSR and sequence-tagged site (STS) markers developed by the Chiba University20 were screened to detect polymorphism between parents of the JF and PA populations in addition to the MM population. The polymorphic markers were mapped with each of the three mapping populations. A total of 6920 EST-derived SSR primer pairs developed by the Kazusa DNA Research Institute21 were used to detect polymorphisms between parents of the two mapping populations (JF and PA), and the polymorphic markers were analyzed in the two populations. The genotype data of 693 EST-derived SSR markers in the MM population were used from the previous study by Hisano et al.212.4. Construction of an integrated linkage mapWe first used JoinMap (version 4.0)25 to group and order molecular marker loci within each of the JF, PA and MM populations. The segregated markers were grouped in LGs on the basis of an LOD (logarithm of the odds ratio for linkage) score of ≥7.0 and referral to previously reported LGs of the public SSR marker loci.16,21 Marker order was subsequently determined on the basis of a minimum LOD score of 1.0 and recombination threshold of 0.4 in each LG. Markers were tested for deviation from expected Mendelian segregation by the chi-squared test performed with the JoinMap software under the ‘Locus Genotypic Frequency’ command. Markers were sorted on the basis of the chi-squares test with a P-value of <0.05.The three maps of each LG were integrated with the used of a minimum LOD score of 3.0 and recombination threshold of 0.4 under the ‘Combine Groups for Map Integration’ command of the JoinMap software, and they were reorganized with reference to the 20 consensus linkage map16 and a previously reported map of EST-derived SSR markers.21 The large interval between the two markers Sat_235 and GMES1325 in LG C1 was calculated with the use of MAPMAKER/EXP, version 3.0.26 Recombination values were converted to genetic distance (cM) with the use of the Kosambi mapping function.27 Each map of the 20 LGs was graphically visualized with MapChart.282.5. Evaluation of mapped markers and allele frequenciesPolymorphism analysis was performed with the same 24 soybean cultivars and lines used in a previous study,21 namely 15 Japanese cultivars and lines (Enrei, Fukuyutaka, Hayahikari, Himeshirazu, Ibarakimame 7 gou, Koitozairai, Misuzudaizu, Nourin 2 gou, Saikai No. 20, Suzuyutaka, Tamahomare, Toyokomachi, Toyomusume, Yukihomare and Toiku No. 237), two Japanese breeding material lines (Tokei 758 gou and To-8E), three US cultivars (Adams, Harosoy and Jack), two Chinese lines (Peking and Moshidou Gong 503), an Indonesian cultivar (Wilis) and the Japanese wild accession (Funaba 3). The number of alleles and polymorphism information content (PIC) were analyzed for 304 USDA-ARS SSR markers on a 3% agarose gel12 using Tris-acetate-EDTA buffer and for 934 EST-derived SSR markers mapped in this study on a 10% polyacrylamide gel using TBE buffer. The PIC for each SSR marker locus (i) was calculated according to the formula described by Keim et al.:29 PIC(i)=1 – ∑Pij2, where Pij is the frequency of the jth allele of the ith SSR locus and summation extends over n alleles.3. Results and discussion3.1. Screening of polymorphic molecular markersWe performed PCR amplification of template DNA from the parents of two mapping populations, the JF and PA populations, in addition to the MM population with EST-derived SSR primer pairs.21 Amplification of template DNA from the parents Jack and Fukuyutaka yielded products from both parents with 6079 primer pairs and from only one parent with 31 pairs. Obvious polymorphism between the parents was observed with 360 (5.2%) of the primer pairs (Table 1). Similarly, PCR products were obtained from both parents Peking and Akita with 5517 primer pairs and from only one parent with 82 pairs. Unambiguous polymorphism between the parents was observed with 406 (5.9%) of the EST-derived SSR primer pairs. The polymorphism frequencies obtained for the parents of the JF and PA populations (5.2 and 5.9%, respectively) are approximately half of that previously reported (9.8%) for the parents (Misuzudaizu and Moshidou Gong 503) of the MM population (680 polymorphisms among the 6920 used for analysis).21 A total of 1127 (16.3%) EST-derived SSR primer pairs gave polymorphisms in at least one of each parental pair of the three mapping populations.Numbers of SSR or STS markers analyzed, found to be polymorphic and mapped in each population of RILsaEST-derived SSR markers developed by Kazusa DNA Research Institute.21bSSR or STS markers developed by Chiba University.20,22cPublic SSR markers developed by USDA-ARS and DuPont Corporation.16,18dGenotype data were used from the previous study by Hisano et al.21eNot applicable (NA); not all primer pairs analyzed.Numbers of SSR or STS markers analyzed, found to be polymorphic and mapped in each population of RILsaEST-derived SSR markers developed by Kazusa DNA Research Institute.21bSSR or STS markers developed by Chiba University.20,22cPublic SSR markers developed by USDA-ARS and DuPont Corporation.16,18dGenotype data were used from the previous study by Hisano et al.21eNot applicable (NA); not all primer pairs analyzed.Of the more than 1000 SSR or STS primer pairs developed by the Chiba University,20,22,30 we selected 370 pairs on the basis of their mapping information and banding patterns in order to detect polymorphism between each pair of the parents of the JF and PA populations. Obvious polymorphism between the parents of the JF or PA population was observed with 100 (27.0%) and 103 (27.8%) of the primer pairs, respectively (Table 1). A total of 145 (39.2%) primer pairs yielded polymorphisms for at least one of the parental pairs of the JF and PA populations.The public soybean SSR markers developed by USDA-ARS and DuPont Corporation16,18 were examined for polymorphism between each pair of the parents of the three populations in order to construct a framework for the 20 consensus LGs. Clear polymorphism between the parents of the JF or PA population was observed with 402 (39.6%) and 320 (31.5%) of the 1015 SSR primer pairs, respectively (Table 1). In addition, 164 primer pairs for the 377 public SSR markers analyzed previously12 as well as the 300 SSR markers previously reported21 yielded unambiguous polymorphism between the parents of the MM population. Consequently, obvious polymorphism between at least one of each parental pair of the three populations was observed with a total of 614 (60.5%) SSR markers.3.2. Construction of each linkage mapA total of 862 polymorphisms were scored in the JF population, with each primer pair yielding polymorphic bands at a single locus. After exclusion of 16 unlinked markers and 7 unsuccessfully positioned markers, 839 marker loci, which included 344 EST-derived SSR markers, 97 SSR or STS markers developed by Chiba University and 398 public SSR markers, were assembled into 26 LGs with a total genetic length of 2363.6 cM. Sixteen of these LGs were matched with A1, A2, B1, B2, D1a, D1b, D2, E, F, G, I, J, K, L, M and N of the 20 consensus LGs.18,31 The other four consensus LGs (C1, C2, H and O) were divided into two or three fragments.After exclusion of 12 unlinked markers and 7 unsuccessfully positioned markers, a total of 810 marker loci, including 396 EST-derived SSR markers, 99 SSR or STS markers, and 315 public SSR markers, were grouped into 32 LGs in the PA population. Twelve of these LGs corresponded to A1, A2, B2, D1a, D1b, D2, F, I, J, M, N and O of the 20 consensus LGs. The other eight consensus LGs (B1, C1, C2, E, G, H, K and L) were divided into 2–4 fragments. All but one of the primer pairs yielded polymorphic bands at a single locus; the primer pair for CSSR534 detected two loci. The linkage map covered a genetic distance of 1575.9 cM.Genotype data for 693 EST-derived SSR loci in the MM population were used from the previous study by Hisano et al.21 In addition to these markers, 308 marker loci, including 9 SSR or STS markers and 299 public SSR markers, were assembled into 22 LGs with a total genetic length of 2187.2 cM, after the elimination of one unlinked marker. Eighteen of these LGs matched 18 of the 20 consensus LGs. The other two consensus LGs (C1 and E) were each fragmented into two short pieces. After the addition of two public SSR markers, Sat_137 and Satt684, of LG A1, five EST-derived SSR markers (GMES4205a, GMES6481, GMES2036, GMES4016 and GMES2497) mapped at one end of LG A1, though they were previously assigned to LG C2.21 Twenty-four and one primer pairs detected double and quadruple loci, respectively. Segregation distortion was observed in the same region of consensus LG I in two mapping populations, JF (CSSR366, CSSR529, GMES1137, GMES2783, GMES6339 and Sat_189) and MM (CSSR529, GMES0289, GMES2783, GMES4080, GMES6339 and GMES6428).3.3. Construction of an integrated linkage mapSince 648 of the mapped marker loci were common among at least two of the mapping populations, JoinMap analysis of the 1074 EST-derived SSR including 387 newly mapped marker loci, 141 SSR or STS including 81 newly mapped marker loci and 595 public SSR markers resulted in their successful merger into a genetic linkage map comprised the 20 consensus LGs and spanning 2442.9 cM of Kosambi map distance (Fig. 1, Table 2). The average genetic length of the 20 LGs was 122.1 cM, although the length ranged from 175.8 (LG A2) to 77.4 (LG J) cM (Table 2). The number of marker loci for the LGs ranged from 114 (LG F) to 70 (LG N), with an average of 90.5. The average genetic distance between markers varied between 0.94 (LG J) and 1.78 (LG A2) cM. A cluster of five EST-derived SSR markers (GMES4205a, GMES6481, GMES2036, GMES4016 and GMES2497) was previously assigned to LG C2,21 but this cluster together with GMES0706, CSSR1,20 GMES5782, GMES3776 and GMES1678 was assembled at one end of LG A1 in the present integrated linkage map as well as individual linkage maps (Fig. 1). Most marker loci were relatively evenly distributed along the LGs, although there were some regions with a high or low marker density (Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. S1). The LG C1 still contained a large genetic interval (35.3 cM) between Sat_235 and GMES1325 for which there was no marker locus (Table 3). There were additional six large genetic intervals with a gap of >10 cM (Table 3).Genetic linkage map of soybean constructed with SSR and STS markers. The linkage map was visualized graphically with MapChart. The LGs were constructed from 595 public SSR markers developed by USDA-ARS and DuPont Corporation (black characters), 1074 EST-derived SSR markers developed by Kazusa DNA Research Institute (red), and 141 SSR or STS markers developed by the Chiba University (blue). A total of 468 newly mapped PCR-based markers were polymorphic in one or more of the three mapping populations (bold). The EST-derived SSR markers GMES4205a, GMES6481, GMES2036, GMES4016 and GMES2497 were previously assigned to LG C2,21 but the JoinMap analysis here positioned these markers as well as GMES0706, CSSR1, GMES5782, GMES3776 and GMES1678 at one end of LG A1 (boxed region).Genetic linkage map of soybean constructed with SSR and STS markers.

However, amplified products of each of 77 of these 132 marker loci exhibited polymorphism with bands of different sizes among 23 soybean cultivars and 1 wild soybean line, indicating that most of these loci could be used as codominant markers dependent on the combination of genotypes. Among the mapped molecular markers, 32 EST-derived SSR markers and 2 SSR markers developed by the Chiba University detected double loci in one or more than two of the mapping populations. One EST-derived SSR marker, GMES4205, gave four polymorphic bands positioned in four different LGs, whereas two SSR and one STS markers developed by the Chiba University were mapped to positions different from those reported previously.20 These multiple loci were discriminated by appending a lowercase letter, as in GMES4205a and GMES4205b (Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. S1).3.4. Polymorphism of USDA-ARS SSR and EST-derived SSR markersWe examined allelic variation among the 24 soybean genotypes with the mapped SSR markers on the integrated linkage map. We selected 934 EST-derived SSR markers and 304 public SSR markers on the basis of both their unambiguous banding patterns and their distribution throughout the entire genome.12,21 Though the two groups of the SSR markers were analyzed by the different electrophoresis systems on either polyacrylamide or agarose gel, the resolutions of amplified products were almost equivalent in both systems. For confirmation, the electrophoresis system for each marker was indicated in Supplementary Fig. S1. The number of alleles per locus ranged from 2 to 7 with an average of 2.8 for the EST-derived SSR markers and 3.1 for the public SSR markers (Fig. 2, Table 4). The most frequent allele numbers were 2 and 3 for the EST-derived SSR and public SSR markers, respectively. The PIC value, a measure of allelic diversity at a locus, ranged from 0.08 to 0.83, with an average value of 0.40 for all markers; the average was 0.38 for the EST-derived SSR markers and 0.46 for the public SSR markers (Fig. 2, Table 4). Marker loci with PIC values between 0.40 and 0.50 were the most common among both groups. The highest and lowest average PIC values for the EST-derived SSR markers were detected in LG G (0.49) and LGs D2 and M (0.34), respectively. In contrast, the highest and lowest such values for the public SSR markers were detected in LG D2 (0.52) and LG H (0.34), respectively (Table 4). Clusters of marker loci with a higher than average PIC value, such as those located between GMES1587 and GMES4303 (average PIC value of 0.58), were detected in LG G (Supplementary Fig. S1). In contrast, marker loci located between GMES0688 and GMES4161 in LG O showed an average PIC value of only 0.19.Comparison of allele frequencies and PIC values for markers in 23 soybean cultivars and one wild accession.

General discussionSeveral SSR-based linkage maps have recently been developed independently for different mapping populations.16,17,20,21 Although these previous studies accumulated almost 2000 SSRs mapped to the 20 consensus LGs, the positional relations among SSRs have remained unclear. We have mapped a total of 1810 SSR or other kinds of PCR-based markers in one or more than three mapping populations and have generated an integrated linkage map with the use of JoinMap 4.0 software. In addition to 1343 known SSR markers, 387 EST-derived SSR markers and 81 SSR or STS markers developed by the Chiba University were newly positioned on the map, allowing determination of the relative position for each microsatellite marker. The total length of the present integrated linkage map is 2442.9 cM, which is almost identical to that of an updated integrated map (2524.0 cM)16–18 including SSR, RFLP, RAPD, AFLP and classical markers as well as to that of a transcript map (2550.3 cM) with SNP markers.7 The genetic length of individual LGs in the present integrated map correlates well with that of those in the previous maps (r = 0.73 and 0.72, respectively). Whereas LGs A1 and E are >20 cM longer in the present map than in the previous maps, LGs B2, D2 and F are >20 cM shorter. The estimated length of these LGs, with the exception of LG A1, agrees relatively well with that of those in the latest version of the integrated linkage map.32 In contrast, several new SSR marker loci were mapped outside the existing SSR loci in LG A1, extending its genetic length by >20 cM. The present integrated linkage map thus appears to achieve high coverage of the entire soybean genome.The present integrated linkage map is composed of 1810 molecular markers including 1074 EST-derived SSR markers, 141 SSR or STS markers developed by the Chiba University and 595 public SSR markers with an average marker density of 0.74/cM. Although the markers are distributed relatively evenly, randomly and densely throughout the genome, there remain seven gaps of >10 cM between markers. In particular, LG C1 contains the largest gap of 35.3 cM between Sat_235 and GMES1325, an interval for which no SSR markers were reported in previous studies.17,21,31 This gap may reflect either a lack of polymorphic markers in a highly homozygous region or the presence of hot spots of recombination that enlarge the genetic distance corresponding to a short physical distance.Public SSR markers, which have been developed by USDA-ARS and DuPont Corporation,17,31 were strictly standardized to yield a single amplification product for a given soybean genotype. All the primer pairs for these markers thus corresponded to a single locus in the present mapping populations. In contrast, EST-derived SSR markers sometimes gave multiple bands, which were mapped separately to different LGs in some cases. Thirty-two and one primer pairs for these SSRs detected double and quadruple loci, respectively. A total of 84 public SSR markers were common to the three individual linkage maps and mapped to the 20 consensus LGs described previously.17 Most markers were arranged in the same order and with similar genetic intervals in the JF, PA, MM and present integrated linkage maps as well as in the consensus integrated linkage map. However, reversions or altered orders of markers relative to the consensus linkage map were observed for LGs D1a, D1b, E, J and N. Each RIL population used in this study was derived from a cross between a Japanese cultivar and foreign cultivar or experimental line. All the parents were genetically classified into distant groups by cluster analysis of length polymorphism of SSR markers.12 In contrast, with one exception, previous consensus integrated linkage maps were constructed on the basis of mapping populations derived from US domestic cultivars.16,18 The discrepancy in marker order may be due to inversion, translocation, insertion or deletion of genomic regions specific to mapping populations with different genetic backgrounds.7 Similarly, the frequency of recombination has been found to vary substantially among populations,33 resulting in divergence of genetic distance among mapping populations.In the present study, we analyzed allelic variation for a large number of SSR loci including 934 EST-derived and 304 public SSRs. The overall average PIC value for the EST-derived markers (0.38) was lower than that for the public SSR markers (0.46), consistent with previous observations.21,30 The PIC values and their distribution are indicative of the transferability of mapped SSR markers to different genotypes. The most frequent number of alleles per EST-derived marker was two, suggesting that several such markers might reflect insertion–deletion polymorphisms (indels), as is the case for STS markers.21 The PIC values of EST-derived markers in individual LGs did not correlate with those of the public SSR markers (r = −0.23). The public SSR marker loci with the highest and lowest average PIC values were found in LG D2 (0.52) and LG H (0.34), respectively, whereas the highest and lowest average PIC values for the EST-derived SSR markers were detected in LG G (0.41) and both LG D2 and LG M (0.34), respectively. The reason for this difference between the two SSR marker groups of different origin remains unclear.Soybean is a member of the phaseoloid legumes, which include numerous crops of economic importance such as common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), cowpea [Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.], mungbean [V. radiata (L.) Wilczek] and azuki bean [V. angularis (Willd.) Ohwi et Ohashi]. The availability of an integrated linkage map with markers, such as EST-derived SSR markers, that are transferable to closely related species would allow comparative genetic analysis between soybean and other legume crops as a strategy for applied agriculture.21,34 Comparative genetic mapping and synteny analysis would facilitate gene discovery through the development of markers that are closely linked genetically to the target gene.35 In addition, information on EST-derived SSR markers provides a basis for evaluation of the structural diversity and evolution of these various species.36A chromosome-based assembly of sequence data in soybean, Glyma1.0, is available at Phytozome.37 The accuracy and resolution of genetic linkage maps and physical maps (whole-genome sequencing) can thus be confirmed and refined reciprocally. The availability of physical maps does not diminish the importance of genetic linkage maps, with the two map types having a synergistic influence on modern soybean genomics as well as marker-assisted selection for target traits. The large number of SSR markers positioned in the present and previous studies promote understanding of the soybean genome at the structural and functional levels.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available online at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries of Japan [Genomics for Agricultural Innovation (DD-3260) and Research Project for Utilizing Advanced Technologies in Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries (18063)].We thank Asuka Ueki, Motomi Suzuki, Takako Yamamoto and Ayako Suzuki for technical assistance.Supplementary data",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IntroductionThe mucosal surface of the gastrointestinal tract is continuously exposed to enormous numbers of commensal microorganisms and occasionally to pathogens. In this context, the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), such as Peyer's patches (PPs) and appendix, serve as sentinel for recognition and initiation of the immune response to intestinal microbes.1 One of the unique features of the GALT is to sample luminal antigens directly across the mucosal epithelium for the purpose of immunosurveillance. The luminal side of the GALT lymphoid follicles is covered by follicle-associated epithelium (FAE), within which are M cells that actively transport luminal macromolecules through transepithelial membrane trafficking, a process referred to as transcytosis.2,3The apical plasma membrane of M cells is specialized for the uptake of antigen, featuring reduced glycocalyx and lack of hydrolytic enzymes. In addition, the basal plasma membrane of M cells often is deeply invaginated to form a so-called ‘M-cell pocket’ where dendritic cells (DCs) and lymphocytes migrate. This reduces the migratory distance between the apical and basal plasma membranes for antigen transport. Furthermore, reduction in the number of lysosomes as well as the activity of lysosomal hydrolases has been reported for M cells. These observations are consistent with the notion that M cells transport luminal antigens intact to the GALT lymphoid follicles. The delivered antigens are then captured by immature DCs residing in the subepithelial dome region beneath the FAE, and the antigen-primed DCs undergo maturation and migrate in the T-cell area of the GALT to present antigens to T cells, leading ultimately to the production of IgA antibodies by B cells.1 Antigen delivery through M cells is thus critical for induction of mucosal immune responses for host defense. Paradoxically, the M-cell-dependent antigen uptake can be exploited by diverse pathogenic microbes, including Salmonella spp. and Yersinia enterocolitica, as a portal for entry into the host.4,5,6Despite the importance of M cells in mucosal immune response as well as microbial infection, there are only a few M-cell-specific molecules so far been identified. Elucidation of M-cell-specific molecules is needed for better understanding of M cells, such as the molecular mechanisms for antigen transcytosis and invasion of microorganisms, which may lead to the development of new methods for drug delivery, vaccination as well as prevention of infectious diseases. In an attempt to identify M-cell-specific molecules, we established a method to separate murine FAE and villous epithelium (VE) for subsequent comparative transcriptome analysis.7 However, it is still difficult to identify M-cell-specific molecules, especially those expressed at low levels, because the M cells constitute only ∼5–10% of the FAE cells.8The bursa of Fabricius (BF), a central lymphoid organ in birds, is essential for the diversification of the B-cell repertoire. BF contains 8000–12 000 B-cell follicles, the luminal surface for which is covered almost exclusively by M cells.2,9 The bursal FAE is thus a convenient source of highly enriched M cells for the purpose of identifying M-cell-specific molecules, including the posited receptors for antigen uptake and transcytosis.In this study, we attempted to identify M-cell specific molecules, by taking advantage of transcriptome analysis of the avian bursal FAE that is composed almost entirely of the M cells. The data obtained from chicken FAE were then paired with data obtained from murine PP FAE for comparative transcriptome analysis. M-cell-specific expression of the candidate genes was examined by quantitative PCR (Q-PCR), in situ hybridization (ISH) and immunostaining.2. Materials and methods2.1. AnimalsNineteen-day-old line-M chickens were purchased from the Nippon Institute Biological Science. BALB/c mice were purchased from CLEA Japan and were maintained under specific pathogen-free condition in the vivarium of RIKEN Research Center for Allergy and Immunology and Yokohama City University until use in experiments. All animal experiments were approved by the Animal Research Committee of RIKEN Yokohama Research Institute and Yokohama City University.2.2. Preparation of bursal FAE and interfollicular epitheliumThe BF was dissected from the cloaca and soaked in Hank's Buffered Salt Solution (HBSS) (GIBCO) containing black ink for 5 min at room temperature in order to visualize the FAE. After incubation, the tissue was treated with 40 mM EDTA/25 mM Hepes (pH 7.4) in HBSS for 5 min at room temperature to collect bursal FAE, majority of which is liberated from interfollicular epithelium (IFE) in this condition; to recover pure bursal IFE, the tissue was treaded in the same solution for 30 min at 37°C to completely remove FAE. Bursal FAE and IFE were collected with 29G needle under stereomicroscope monitoring as described previously.72.3. Gene expression analysisChicken genome-wide gene expression was examined by using GeneChip Chicken Genome Array (Affymetrix) containing oligonucleotide probe sets for 32 733 transcripts and expressed sequence tags. Total RNA was extracted from FAE and IFE using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized from 0.1 µg of total RNA by two-cycle target labeling according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNA was subjected to in vitro transcription in the presence of biotinylated nucleotide triphosphates. The biotinylated cRNA was hybridized with a probe array for 16 h at 45°C. The hybridization was performed with pooled samples of FAE or IFE from a chicken. The hybridized products were stained with streptavidin–phycoerythrin, and then scanned with a Hewlett-Packard Gene Array Scanner. The fluorescence intensity of each probe was quantified using GeneChip Analysis Suite 5.0 software (Affymetrix). The level of gene expression was determined as the average difference using the GeneChip software. Data analysis was further performed with Genespring software version 7.0 (Silicon Genetics). Measurement values <0.01 were set at 0.01, and per-chip normalization was performed to the median of all measurements. Finally, two filtering were performed; one was to filter on expression level select raw from 100 to 61 022, and the other on flags that presence or marginal in FAE and IFE. Expression data were considered significant when they differed by at least 2-fold between FAE and IFE. All microarray data have been deposited at GEO under accession number GSE 16081.2.4. Database analysisThe expression of candidates for M-cell-specific molecules in various tissue and immune cells was analyzed with Reference Database for Immune Cells (RefDIC: http://refdic.rcai.riken.jp).10 GOstat (http://gostat.wehi.e.du.au/) was used to find functional annotation or Gene-Ontology (GO) groups which are highly represented in the selected sets of genes.112.5. Q-PCR analysisTotal RNA was extracted from FAE and VE of mouse PP using RNeasy Kit (Qiagen) and was reverse-transcribed using ReverTra Ace-α (TOYOBO). Q-PCR was performed to quantify mRNA expression levels using the SYBR Premix Ex Taq and the Thermal Cycler Dice Real Time System (TAKARA). A specific primer set for each gene was as follows: Anxa10 5′-AACTTGGTCCAGGCAAACAGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACGAACAATAGCAACCAGCAGC-3′ (reverse), Prnp 5′-GGTCCCTTTGATGGAGTCTGTC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGTGGATGCTCTAGCTATCCCA-3′ (reverse).2.6. In situ hybridizationA 470 bp fragment of Anxa10 cDNA was amplified from FAE-derived cDNA by PCR using the specific primers: 5′-ATAGGATCCTAACACAACGCAGCAATG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTACTCGAGGATCATCTGCATCATGGTTTT-3′ (reverse). The PCR product was digested with BamHI and XhoI, and subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and was used for generation of non-targeted RNA probes as a control probes or antisense RNA probes. Paraffin-embedded PP sections of mice were obtained from Genostaff. ISH was done by Genostaff. In brief, the sections were hybridized with digoxigenin labeled RNA probes at 60°C for 16 h. The bound label was detected using NBT-BCIP, an alkaline phosphate color substrate. After ISH, sections were treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide in PBS for 15 min followed by Protein Block (Dako) for 10 min. They were incubated with 0.25 mg/ml Biotinylated Ulex europaeus agglutinin-1 (UEA-1) (Vector), at 4°C overnight. After washing with PBS, the sections reacted with peroxidase conjugated streptavidin (Nichirei) for 5 min. Peroxidase activity was visualized by diaminobenzidine. The control probe treated sections were counterstained with Kernechtrot (MUTO PURE CHEMICALS).2.7. Whole-mount immunostainingPPs were excised from the small intestine, fixed with Cytofix/Cytoperm (BD Biosciences) for 1 h at 4°C and then incubated with 10 µg/ml anti-CD16/32 mAb (93; eBioscience)/0.1% saponin/0.5% BSA in PBS to block non-specific Fc binding. The whole-mount specimens were then stained with 2 µg/ml mouse PrP mAb (SAF-32; Cayman Chemical) or an isotype-matched control IgG (BD Biosciences) overnight at 4°C, followed by 10 µg/ml Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG Ab (Molecular Probes). The specimens were further stained with 20 µg/ml Rhodamine-conjugated UEA-1 (Vector Laboratories) or with a glycoprotein 2 (GP2) mAb (2F11C3) followed by Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated anti-rat IgG (Invitrogen). The specimens were analyzed with a DM-IRE2 confocal laser scanning microscope and Leica confocal software (Leica Microsystems).2.8. StatisticsStatistical analysis was performed with the Mann–Whitney U-test. Differences were considered as significant at P < 0.05.3. Result and discussion3.1. Comparative transcriptome analysis of chicken and murine FAEWe separated the bursal FAE and the IFE surrounding the FAE in the chicken BF by modifying the dissection method used to separate mammalian FAE cells.7 After soaking the BF in HBSS containing black ink, the FAE was easily distinguished as black areas under a stereomicroscope (Fig. 1A, upper left). From these specimens, we separated the bursal FAE and the surrounding IFE (Fig. 1A, lower left and right, respectively). Total RNA prepared from these samples was used for microarray analysis. The scattered plots of the normalized gene expression profile for bursal FAE versus IFE revealed that the expression levels were within 2-fold for the majority of genes (Fig. 1B), whereas the expression of 682 annotated genes was up-regulated at least 2-fold in bursal FAE compared with IFE and the expression of 260 annotated genes was down-regulated in bursal FAE by at least 2-fold. To characterize these genes, we classified them using GOstat. Most of the top 10 GO categories for the up-regulated genes were converged into ‘transmembrane transporter activity’ or ‘ATPase activity’ (Table 1). In contrast, there was no characteristic enrichment of GO categories in the down-regulated genes. Given that BF M cells vigorously take up and transport exogenous antigens, it is conceivable that a group of genes responsible for membrane transport using ATP as a driving force may be constitutively up-regulated in FAE. Thus, the feature of the enriched GO categories for the up-regulated genes in bursal FAE could reflect the specialization of M cells.Comparative transcriptome analysis.

The table summarizes the top 10 GO categories according to the P-value.3.2. Identification of candidates M-cell-specific moleculesWe have previously identified genes specifically up-regulated in FAE compared with VE in mice.7 To identify M-cell-specific molecules conserved in chickens and mice, we compared the genes up-regulated in the FAE of chickens and mice. As shown in Fig. 1C, 28 genes were up-regulated in both species (Supplementary Table S1). These genes were classified mainly as cytoskeleton genes (Actn1, Evl, Lcp1, Rac2 and Vim), nucleic acid binding genes (Cugbp2, Fli1, Poll, Pou2af1 and Slbp), receptor activity genes (CD44, Cxcr4, Tnfrsf19, Tnfrsf1b, Traf3 and Tyro3) and others. We next utilized a public database RefDIC that contains microarray analysis data of different tissues and immune cells, which enabled us to examine tissue- and cell-wide expression of the target genes. Since immune cells often reside in the M-cell pockets, it could be possible that expression of immune cell-specific genes is falsely detected in our FAE preparation. Therefore, we chose genes specifically expressed in FAE but not in VE, with relatively low expression levels in immune cells (Fig. 2). Ten genes (Anxa10, Clu, Gpr137b, Poll, Prnp, Sacs, Sgsh, Slc16a3, Tnfrsf19 and Tyro3) were selected using these criteria, whereas others were not (Supplementary Fig. S1). Among these 10 genes, the expression levels of three genes, Anxa10, Clu and Prnp, were more than 2-fold higher in FAE than in VE regardless of housing condition of mice, germfree or conventional, in RefDIC.10 Since our Q-PCR analysis confirmed the up-regulation of Anxa10 and Prnp in FAE compared with VE (Fig. 3), we decided to further analyze these two molecules to determine whether they are M-cell-specific. Concerning Clu, recent studies have reported that this gene, which encodes clusterin, is expressed in entire FAE, among which a particularly high expression was observed in M cells for mice and humans,12,13 in keeping with our finding.Strong expression of Anxa10 and Prnp mRNA in murine PP FAE among various tissues and cells.

Expression of Anxa10 mRNA in murine PP M cellsHaving identified Anxa10 and Prnp by our comparative transcriptome analysis as candidate for M-cell-specific genes in mice, we examined their expression pattern in FAE. Because antibodies specific for annexin A10 encoded by Anxa10 were not available, we examined the cellular expression of Anxa10 by ISH. A positive signal for Anxa10 mRNA was observed in some of the cells in mouse FAE (Fig. 4A and B), whereas no signals were observed with a control probe (Fig. 4C). The Anxa10 signal co-localized with UEA-1 that recognizes M cells in FAE (Fig. 4B). The result suggests that Anxa10 mRNA is expressed specifically in M cells in the murine gut epithelium.Specific expression of Anxa10 mRNA by murine M cells.

Indeed, the network of annexin A5 reportedly bends the membrane patch into the cell and elicits budding, endocytic vesicle formation and cytoskeleton-dependent trafficking of the endocytic vesicles.19 Intriguingly, annexin A5 is expressed in M cells and implicated in endocytic transport and membrane scaffolding.12 Our findings thus suggest that annexin A10 could also be involved in M-cell-specific membrane traffic events such as antigen transcytosis.3.4. Cellular prion protein (PrPC) expression on the apical plasma membrane of murine M cellsPrnp encodes cellular prion protein PrPC, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored membrane protein. We performed whole-mount immunostaining of PP with a PrP mAb to determine which cell types express PrPC in mouse FAE. The expression of PrPC was observed primarily in a subpopulation of cells in the peripheral region of the FAE (Fig. 5A and C); no signal was observed with specimens stained with an isotype-matched IgG control of irrelevant specificity (Fig. 5B and D). Most of the PrPC-expressing cells were also stained with the UEA-1 lectin (Fig. 5A) and with an mAb to GP2 (Fig. 5C), a specific marker for murine PP M cells,20 although co-localization of PrPC with GP2 was apparently less frequent than with UEA-1. This is at least partly because GP2 is not expressed in all M cells but restricted to more matured M cells compared with PrPC (our unpublished observation). This observation demonstrates that PrPC is preferentially expressed by M cells in the FAE. In addition, the X–Z sectioning images obtained by confocal microscopic analysis indicated that PrPC was expressed on the apical plasma membrane of M cells (Fig. 5C), where it observed to be co-localized with GP2, which is expressed on the apical surface of M cells.20 These findings suggest that PrPC molecules are especially abundant on the apical plasma membrane of M cells.Preferential expression of Cellular prion protein (PrPC) by murine M cells.

The upper part of the image is the apical plasma membrane side, and the lower is the basal side. Scale bars: 75 µm.PrPC is the causative agent of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy. According to the ‘prion hypothesis’, the infectious isoform of prion protein, termed PrPSc, replicates by interacting with PrPC and mediating its conformational change into PrPSc.21 In addition, PrPC has been shown to bind selectively to PrPScin vitro.22,23 Compared with its well-defined pathological significance, the physiological functions of PrPC remain unclear. PrPC is highly expressed not only by cells in the central nervous system, but also by follicular DCs, mature myeloid cells and activated T cells. This cellular distribution suggests an immunosurveillance role for PrPC.24 Our data showing that PrPC is strongly expressed on the apical plasma membrane of M cells (Fig. 5A and C) suggest PrPC as an antigen receptor candidate on M cells. This hypothesis is consistent with the demonstration that exogenously expressed human PrPC is selectively targeted to the apical plasma membrane in polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells and Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells.25 Notably, clusterin possesses a chaperone-like function for PrP.26 Together, the strong expression of both PrPC and clusterin by M cells12,13 may suggest a possible role for clusterin in specific membrane transport of PrPC in M cells.There is accumulating evidence indicating that diverse infectious agents and their toxins utilize GPI-anchored proteins to gain entry into host cells.27 For example, CD48 plays an important role in E. coli phagocytosis via FimH recognition in macrophages and mast cells.28 Furthermore, PrPC on macrophages has been reported to recognize surface-exposed Hsp60 of Brucella abortus and to facilitate internalization of the bacteria.29 By analogy, PrPC on M cells could also interact with Hsp60 of B. abortus. Hsp60 proteins have been recognized as immunodominant antigens of many microbes.30 Our present results suggest that PrPC on the apical plasma membrane of M cells is well placed to contribute to mucosal immunosurveillance through promoting transcytosis of B. abortus or other exogenous antigens. Further studies to elucidate PrPC function on M cells are now underway.In conclusion, we here demonstrate that comparative transcriptomic analysis of chick bursal FAE, which is almost exclusively composed of M cells,2 and mouse FAE, which includes M cells as a minority constituents, is a useful approach to the identification of M-cell-specific molecules. In this study, we have focused on the genes that are up-regulated 2-fold or more in FAE versus IFE (for chicken) or VE (for mice). Genes up-regulated 2-fold or more in chick FAE and less than 2-fold in murine FAE could also contain M-cell-specific genes, in view of the fact that M cells constitute 5–10% of the total FAE population in mice.8 This population of the genes will be a future target in the search for other M-cell-specific genes.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis study was supported in part by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B) (H.O.), Young Scientists (K.H. and S.F.), Scientific Research on Innovative Areas (H.O.) and Scientific Research in Priority Areas (K.H.) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan and Takeda Science Foundation (K.H.).We thank Ms. Y.

To extend this line of approach, it is timely to compile and analyze TCS-associated components of L. japonicus from a genome-wide viewpoint. The special reasons are 2-fold; (i) L. japonicus, together with Medicago truncatula, is a model legume, which has a unique ability to engage in beneficial symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing bacteria,23 and (ii) L. japonicus and M. truncatula are the legumes of choice to conduct comparative genome-wide researches, because the efforts of whole genome sequencing are almost at final stage.24–26 On the basis of these rationales, here we compiled L. japonicus TCS-associated coding-sequences by adopting the currently available database (http://www.kazusa.or.jp/lotus/index.html/).First, it is necessary to introduce general ideas about plant TCS-associated components, briefly. As schematically shown in Fig. 1, the plant TCS-associated components mainly consist of three phosphorelay signal transducers, such as hybrid HK, histidine-containing phosphotransmitter (HPt or HP), and response regulator (RR). The members of RRs are classified into two groups, at least; one is designated type-A RR, and the other type-B RR. The type-A RR consists of only a receiver domain containing an invariant phospho-accepting Asp (D) residue, whereas the type-B RR contains an additional common domain within a C-terminal extension. The motif is generally designated GARP (GOLDEN2, ARR, PSR1), which serves as a sequence-specific DNA-binding domain.27 Therefore, the former would function as a modulator of phosphorelay signal transduction,28,29 whereas the latter would serve as a gene-specific transcription factor.30,31 In addition to these typical TCS-associated components, A. thaliana has a small family of atypical TCS-associated components, which were named pseudo-RRs (PRRs),6,32 because the phospho-accepting aspartate (D) residue had been converted to glutamates (E). These PRRs do not appear to be involved in the phosphorelay signal transduction. However, they coordinately play essential roles within the circadian clock, which are implicated in many characteristic light signal transduction mechanisms of plants growing in natural habitats on the earth exhibiting the 24 h photoperiod.33,34 These views as to the TCS-associated components have been induced mainly from recent intensive studies on the model plant A. thaliana, and many excellent reviews are currently available, in which comprehensive overviews were presented with regard to the respective subjects, including ethylene signal transduction, cytokinin signal transduction, and plant circadian clock.5,6,8–11 On the basis of these backgrounds, here we attempted to compile the genome-wide framework of L. japonicus TCS-associated components.A schematic representation of the structural features of plant TCS-associated signal transduction components. HKs (e.g. cytokinin receptors) consists of three domains; N-terminal cytokinin-binding domain, central HK domain containing an invariant phospho-accepting histidine (H) residue, and C-terminal receiver domain containing an invariant aspartate (D) residue, which is capable of accepting a phosphoric group from a phospho-histidine. The phosphoryl group on the receiver domain is transferred to a histidine containing phospho-transmitter (HPt or HP), which subsequently serves as a phospho-donor toward RR. Other details are given in the text.A schematic representation of the structural features of plant TCS-associated signal transduction components.

Other details are given in the text.To compile a list of L. japonicus TCS-associated genes (or coding-sequence), an extensive computer-aided search was conducted using the current databases (http://www.kazusa.or.jp/lotus/index.html/). The logic and strategy of bioinformatics with regard to TCS-associated genes were described previously.13,14 We identified a number of coding-sequences, each of which most likely encodes a component of TCS (or related one). As summarized in Table 1, L. japonicus has, at least, 14 genes each encoding an HK, 7 HPt-related genes, 7 type-A RR-related genes, 11 type-B RR-related genes, and 5 putative circadian clock-associated PRR genes.A list of His-Asp phosphorelay-associated components found in the whole genome sequence of L. japonicusA list of His-Asp phosphorelay-associated components found in the whole genome sequence of L. japonicusIt is first worth mentioning that A. thaliana has 11 HK genes (including three genes encoding cytokinin receptors, five genes encoding ethylene receptors), 6 HPt-related genes, 10 type-A RR genes, 11 type-B RR genes, and 5 clock-associated genes.3,4 Considering the fact that the TCS-associated genes in higher plants are evolutionarily conserved, these results suggested that most of the L. japonicus TCS-associated genes have already been uncovered in this genome-wide analysis, if not all. These genes (or coding sequences) are listed in Table 1, about which it should be noted that each gene was named quite tentatively, because we believe that the final designation of their nomenclatures should be made more carefully and systematically in order to avoid any future confusion. In any case, by employing the readership friendly Supplementary Table S1, one may directly access each original database of L. japonicus TCS-associated cording-sequences through www hyperlinks (an Excel version of Supplementary Table S1 can be directly download through http://www.agr.nagoya-u.ac.jp/~microbio/phosphorelay/open data/Supplementary Table S1.xls ).As judged by the knowledge about the cytokinin receptor HKs of A. thaliana (i.e. AHK2, AHK3, AHK4/CRE1/WOL), all of them are highly conserved in L. japonicus. One of cytokinin receptor HK has already been characterized experimentally with special reference to the root nodule organogenesis in response to a Rhizobium (named Lhk1, chr4.CM0042.1660 in Table 1).35,36 Likewise, five orthologs of ethylene receptor HKs (e.g. ETR1) are also found in L. japonicus. However, one of them seems to be incorrectly annotated in the current database. In this case, it is possible to deduce a full length of ethylene receptor HK by combining chr5.LjT09623.140 and 150 into a single coding-sequence. At present, no experimental report on these putative ethylene receptor HKs is available, although some reports on ethylene-mediated signaling in L. japonicus are present.37,38 In addition to these well-characterized hormone receptor HKs, A. thaliana has three more HKs, named AtHK1, CKI1, and AHK5/CKI2.39–41 In this regard, L. japonicus has also a set of HKs orthlogous to these A. thaliana HKs, respectively, although some of them might be incomplete (e.g. AtHK1 orthologs of L. japonicus), as noted specifically in Table 1. Interestingly, L. japonicus appears to have two copies for each of these orthologs. In summary, both the members and numbers of HK genes are highly conserved between A. thaliana and L. japonicus. This view is reasonably generalized for many other higher plants when a phylogenetic tree of HK amino acid sequences was constructed through integrating HKs from a grape tree (Vitis vinifera, Vvi; http://www.genoscope.cns.fr/spip/Vitis-vinifera-e.html), a popular (Populus truchocarpa, Ptr; http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Poptr1/Poptr1.home.html), as well as a rice (Oryza sativa, Osa; http://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/) (Fig. 2).A phylogenetic tree of the HK family in some representative plants. Amino acid sequences of A. thaliana HKs were characterized previously, whereas those of L. japonicus were done in this study. In addition to these, a set of putative HK amino acid sequences was analyzed by adopting the databases of some other plants; a grape tree (Vitis vinifera, Vvi; http://www.genoscope.cns.fr/spip/Vitis-vinifera-e.html), a popular (Populus truchocarpa, Ptr; http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Poptr1/Poptr1.home.html), and a rice (Oryza sativa, Osa; http://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/). Using these inferred amino acid sequences, a neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree was constructed by the program of ClustalW. The HKs of A. thaliana and L. japonicus were highlighted by red and blue colors, respectively. Ethylene receptor HKs were not integrated extensively for clarity of this tree. Positions of AtHK1 orthologs of L. japonicus were not certain because their inferred entire amino acid sequences are ambiguous (named HK1a and HK1b, Table 1).A phylogenetic tree of the HK family in some representative plants.

Positions of AtHK1 orthologs of L. japonicus were not certain because their inferred entire amino acid sequences are ambiguous (named HK1a and HK1b, Table 1).Lotus japonicus has seven HPt-related genes, each encoding a typical phosphotransfer intermediate. Notably, two of them (chr2.CM0065.180 and 190) are highly homologous to each other, and they are located next to each other on the same chromosome, suggesting that they were the resultants of recent duplication. Note also that three out of seven inferred HPt factors, including the repetitive ones, are atypical in that they luck the invariant and phospho-accepting histidine residue in their amino acid sequences, as noted in Table 1. Arabidopsis thaliana has also an atypical HPt gene, which encodes an HPt factor without the phospho-accepting histidine residue. In the case of A. thaliana, this atypical one (named AHP6) plays an important role in the cytokining signal transduction, which is responsible for the developmental regulation of vasculature in roots.42 Hence, the atypical HPt factors of L. japonicus might also play some roles.Arabidopsis thaliana has 10 genes encoding type-A RRs, expressions of which are induced very rapidly upon the onset of cytokinin treatment of plants.43–45 So far, seven type-A RR genes were found in L. japonicus, one of which is fragmental though. In any case, the most critical question is: whether these type-A RR genes of L. japonicus respond to cytokinin rapidly at the level of transcription, like those of A. thaliana. Here, this issue was addressed experimentally. In A. thaliana, one of the hallmarked cytokinin actions is inhibition of primary root elongation. This can be observed when young seedlings were grown on agar-plates containing an appropriated concentration of cytokinin (e.g. BA; 6-benzylaminopurine). We confirmed that this is also the case in L. japonicus (Fig. 3A, upper panel), and the effective BA concentrations for inhibition of root elongation is nearly the same in both A. thaliana and L. japonicus (Fig. 3A, lower panel). On the basis of this preliminary experiment, L. japonicus young seedlings were sprayed with cytokinin (t-zeatin), and then RNA samples were prepared at intervals, followed by semi-quantitative reverse-transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR) with each specific pair of primer for type-A RR genes of L. japonicus (for primers used, see Supplementary Table S2). As shown in Fig. 3B, all identified type-A RR genes, except for RRa7, were confirmed to be cytokinin responsive. Note that we failed amplifying cDNA of RRa7, suggesting that this coding-sequence might be non-functional (Table 1). As positive and negative references, it was also shown that an example of L. japonicus type-B RR genes (named RRb4, Table 1) did not respond to cytokinin, whereas an example of L. japonicus cytokinin oxidase genes (named tentatively CKX3, LjT02N03.150) did so markedly under the experimental conditions used, as expected (Fig. 3B). These results were further confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT–PCR) (Fig. 4).Cytokinin responses of L. japonicus. Cytokinin-induced inhibition of root elongation of L. japonicus seedlings. Seedlings were grown on vertically oriented MS agar-plates containing cytokinin (BA, 6-benzylaminopurine) at varied concentrations, as indicated. After being incubated for 9 days, the average lengths of their primary roots (n ≥ 20) were measured. Photographs were taken for each representative (upper panel), and the resulting lengths of root were plotted against the cytokinin concentrations tested. As a reference, essentially the same experiments were carried out with A. thaliana seedlings.Cytokinin responses of L. japonicus.

(A) Cytokinin-induced expression of type-A RR genes in L. japonicus seedlings. Seedlings were grown MS gellan gum-plates under constant light conditions for 17 days, and then these seedlings were sprayed with cytokinin (20 µM t-zeatin in 0.02% DMSO). The seedlings were harvested immediately before and 0.5, 1.0, 3.0 h after the treatment and subjected to RNA preparation. A set of indicated RR transcripts were analyzed by means of semi-quantitative RT–PCR to measure the amounts of each transcript. The UBC transcript encoding ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (chr1.LjT04O06.40, a homologue of Arabidopsis At5g25760) was used as an internal control, the type-B RRb4 transcript was a negative control, and the CKX3 encoding cytokinin oxidase enzyme (LjT02N03.150, a homologue of Arabidopsis CKX4) was a positive control. The results of reference samples treated with 0.02% DMSO for 1.0 h were also presented at the most right-hand side. The primer set, used for these PCR analyses, was listed in Supplementary Table S2. (B) The essentially the same experiments were repeated in a more quantitative manner by means of real-time quantitative RT–PCR.

The experiments were replicated three times to obtain mean values with SD.We identified 11 coding-sequences, each of which was inferred to specify a type-B RR protein, as judged by the fact that their deduced amino acid sequences (except for RRb8) contain the signature GARP DNA-binding motif, which is preceded by a receiver domain (Fig. 1). The current annotation for chr5.CM0072.220 and 230 must be reconsidered, because if these adjacent coding-sequences were combined together, one can deduce the existence of full-length type-B RR gene (here named RRb1). RRb8 (LiSGA contig) appears to be identical to a part of RRb4. It may be also noted that the invariant phospho-accepting aspartate residue is missing in the receiver domains of some RRb sequences (RRb9, RRb10, and RRb11). In any case, it was revealed that L. japonicus has a certain number of type-B RR genes, each of which is assumed to encode most likely a cytokinin-regulated transcription factor.We also found some miscellaneous coding-sequences, which may or may not specify RR-related peptides (Table 1). Among them, chr.LjT07G07.80 seems to encode an intact receiver domain, whose amino acid sequence is related to the so-called type-C ARR24 of A. thaliana.46 We confirmed experimentally that this L. japonicus RR gene is transcribed in a manner independent of cytokinin (data not shown). Other two (chr.CM0133.120 and chr2.CM0695.44) might be derived from the C-terminal receiver domains of the hybrid sensors AtHK1-like and AHK5-like coding-sequences, respectively, as judged by the fact that the inferred amino acid sequences of these truncated forms of RRs are highly similar to those of AtHK1-like and AHK-like HKs, respectively. In any case, it is reasonable to expect that more RR-related genes will be uncovered when the whole genome sequence of L. japonicus has been entirely completed. Nevertheless, our results suggest that it is also certain that most of TCS-associated genes have already been uncovered in the current database of L. japonicus, as inspected above.It may be worth mentioning that Puthiyaveeti and Allen47 claimed recently that A. thaliana has certain nuclear genes, which appear to encode chloroplast-localized HK (designated CSK, At1G67840) and RR (named TCP34, At3G26580), respectively. In this connection, there found L. japonicus coding sequences that encode amino acid sequences homologous to truncated portions of CSK. However, these coding sequences (chr4.LjT06I07.90 and chr4.LjT06I07.40) with different orientation to each other are separated by a large intervening sequence. Hence, it seems likely that L. japonicus lacks an intact CSK homologous gene. The inferred amino acid sequence (76 a.a.) from LjSGA_054723.1 is homologous to that of a small portion of TCP34 (350 a.a). Hence, it is also not certain that L. japonicus has an intact TCP34 homologous gene. In any case, they were included in Table 1.It is also of interest to search for the circadian clock-associated PRR genes in the current L. japonicus database (Fig. 1). Arabidopsis thaliana has five PRR genes (namely, TOC1/PRR1, PRR3, PRR5, PRR7, and PRR9), all of which play crucial roles within the central oscillator that generates fundamental circadian rhythms.6 Here, all of their counterparts (or orthologs) were found in the current database of L. japonicus, as listed in Table 1. Furthermore, one-to-one pairwise assignment was possible between PRRs of A. thaliana and L. japonicus, when phylogenetic tree was constructed for these PRR amino acid sequences (Fig. 5). However, it should be noted that the L. japonicus PRR3 gene might have been disrupted (or it is non-functional), because our inspection revealed that its coding-sequence is separated into three currently annotated ones (LjTo8o17.180, 130, and 120). These sequences are closely located on the same chromosome, but there are a few intervening unrelated coding-sequences between LjT08017.180 and130. Hence, it was assumed that L. japonicus had lost the functional PRR3 gene.A phylogenetic tree of the PRR family in some representative plants. Amino acid sequences of A. thaliana PRRs were characterized previously, whereas those of L. japonicus were done in this study. In addition to these, a set of putative PRR amino acid sequences were analyzed by employing the databases for some other plants, as noted in Fig. 2. In addition, we included a set of putative PRR sequences from Physcomitrella patens (Ppa, a moss) (http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Phypa1_1/Phypa1_1.home.html). Other details were essentially the same as those in Fig. 2.A phylogenetic tree of the PRR family in some representative plants. Amino acid sequences of A. thaliana PRRs were characterized previously, whereas those of L. japonicus were done in this study. In addition to these, a set of putative PRR amino acid sequences were analyzed by employing the databases for some other plants, as noted in Fig. 2. In addition, we included a set of putative PRR sequences from Physcomitrella patens (Ppa, a moss) (http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Phypa1_1/Phypa1_1.home.html). Other details were essentially the same as those in Fig. 2.According to the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 5), it is clear that the PRR gene family is conserved among many higher plants, suggesting that the molecular mechanism underlying circadian clock is also highly conserved. This view is consistent with the fact that some highly related sequences are found even in Physcomitrella patens (Ppa, a moss), which is a basal lineage of land plant, and which had branched ∼450 millions years ago (Fig. 5).48 These inferred Ppa PRRs also have both the typical protein structure, in which a receiver domain is followed by a signature CCT [constans, constans-like, timing of cab expression 1 (TOC1)] motif (Fig. 1) (http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Phypa1_1/Phypa1_1.home.html). In any case, it is assumed that the molecular mechanism underlying the circadian clock appears to be conserved at least among higher plants, as has previously been demonstrated by comparing PRRs from A. thaliana and O. sativa.21 In this regard, it was shown that both A. thaliana and rice have additional clock-associated components, such as late elongated hypocotyl (LHY) (or circadian clock-associated 1) and LUX arrhythmo (LUX) (also known as PCL1).33,34 These clock-components, together with TOC1, constitute a fundamental core transcriptional feedback loop at the level of transcription, which generates a free-running and intrinsic rhythm, as schematically shown in Fig. 6A.49 Therefore, we searched for LHY-like and LUX-like genes in the L. japonicus database. Indeed, L. japonicus has a set of putative LHY and LUX orthologous genes, as also included in Table 1 (other putative clock-associated components in L. japonicus, such as GI, ELF3, ELF4, and ZTL, will be analyzed elsewhere, because they are not directly relevant to this subject).Characterization of free-running circadian rhythms of putative clock-associated genes of L. japonicus. (A) A schematic representation of the currently consistent model of central oscillator. This proposed model for A. thaliana means that the morning clock genes CCA1 and LHY act repressors for the evening clock genes TOC1 and LUX, in turn, these evening genes somehow activate the expression of CCA1/LHY. In addition, PRR9, PRR7, and PRR5 are the daytime clock genes, which are essential for the clock function. On the basis of this well-established clock model for A. thaliana, a set of putative clock-associated genes of L. japonicus was analyzed with regard to their free-running expression profiles. For this purpose, L. japonicus plants were grown in the 12 h light/12 h dark cycles for 17 days, and then they were released into the continuous light. RNA samples were prepared at intervals (every 3 h), as schematically shown in the panels (the shaded duration corresponds to the final dark period). The resulting expression profiles were analyzed with regard to the putative LHY and TOC1 genes (B) and the putative LHY and LUX genes (C), respectively, by means of both real-time and semi-quantitative RT–PCR (upper and lower parts, respectively). The primer set, used for these PCR analyses, was presented in Supplementary Table S2.Characterization of free-running circadian rhythms of putative clock-associated genes of L. japonicus. (A) A schematic representation of the currently consistent model of central oscillator. This proposed model for A. thaliana means that the morning clock genes CCA1 and LHY act repressors for the evening clock genes TOC1 and LUX, in turn, these evening genes somehow activate the expression of CCA1/LHY. In addition, PRR9, PRR7, and PRR5 are the daytime clock genes, which are essential for the clock function. On the basis of this well-established clock model for A. thaliana, a set of putative clock-associated genes of L. japonicus was analyzed with regard to their free-running expression profiles. For this purpose, L. japonicus plants were grown in the 12 h light/12 h dark cycles for 17 days, and then they were released into the continuous light. RNA samples were prepared at intervals (every 3 h), as schematically shown in the panels (the shaded duration corresponds to the final dark period). The resulting expression profiles were analyzed with regard to the putative LHY and TOC1 genes (B) and the putative LHY and LUX genes (C), respectively, by means of both real-time and semi-quantitative RT–PCR (upper and lower parts, respectively). The primer set, used for these PCR analyses, was presented in Supplementary Table S2.Then, we conducted a critical experiment, through which the diurnal expression profiles of these L. japonicus genes were examined. For this purpose, L. japonicus seedlings were grown under the 12 h light/12 h dark cycles for 17 days, and they were released into continuous light to see clock-controlled free-running rhythms. As shown in Fig. 6B and C, a robust oscillation at the level of transcription was observed for LHY of L. japonicus with a peak at the subjective dawn, whereas robust oscillations were observed for both TOC1 and LUX with a peak at the subjective dusk, respectively. These reciprocal expression profiles of LHY and TOC1 are quite similar to those observed for A. thaliana, suggesting the existence of common core oscillator in both L. japonicus and A. thaliana (Fig. 6A). This view was further confirmed by examining the circadian rhythms of putative PRR9, PRR7, and PRR5. These PRR genes showed each robust peak at daytime (e.g. after LHY and before TOC1) (Fig. 7). In this regard, a few specific comments should be made. (i) In contrast to the case of PRR9 of A. thaliana, PRR9 of L. japonicus did not markedly respond to a light exposure at morning.50 (ii) As mentioned above, we could not detect any transcript of putative PRR3 in L. japonicus (data not shown). In A. thaliana, it was recently shown that PRR3 plays a tissue-specific role in modulating the protein degradation of TOC1, and the clock-associated phenotype of a prr3 loss-of-function mutant is subtle.51,52 Hence, PRR3 might be dispensable for the fundamental clock function, and L. japonicus had lost such a PRR3 function, as mentioned above. Taken together, we concluded that the clock mechanism is well conserved between A. thaliana and L. japonicus, if not completely. In other words, the data compiled is informative for further studies on L. japonicus with special reference to the physiological functions of circadian clock, such as regulation of flowering time, as further discussed later.Further characterization of free-running circadian rhythms of putative PRR clock-associated genes of L. japonicus. To extend the results of Fig. 6, other putative clock genes (PRR9, PRR7, and PRR5) were also analyzed with regard to their circadian rhythms. Other details were the same as those given in Fig. 6.Further characterization of free-running circadian rhythms of putative PRR clock-associated genes of L. japonicus. To extend the results of Fig. 6, other putative clock genes (PRR9, PRR7, and PRR5) were also analyzed with regard to their circadian rhythms. Other details were the same as those given in Fig. 6.It has been emphasized repeatedly that legumes are important plant species of choice for future genome-wide studies. One of many obvious reasons is that they have a unique ability to engage in beneficial symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, which allows the host plant to utilize atmospheric nitrogen. Arabidopsis thaliana lacks this ability. This is one of the reasons why the genomes of not one but three leguminous species, namely L. japonicus (http://www.kazusa.or.jp/lotus/), M. truncatula (barrel medic; http://www.medicago.org/genome/), and Glycine max (soybean; http://www.phytozome.net/soybean), are currently the subjects of independent large-scale sequencing projec",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
s. Furthermore, the entire genome sequences of some symbiotic genera of Rhizobia (e.g. M. loti, Sinorhizobium meliloti, Bradyrhizobium japonicum) are also currently available (http://genome.kazusa.or.jp/rhizobase/). In this regard, we previously presented the compiled lists of TCS-associated components for these symbiotic genera. In this respect, notably, two independent groups recently demonstrated in L. japonicus that the cytokinin receptor HK is directly involved in root nodule organogenesis.35,36 Hence, the data compiled will provide us with a basis for further studies on L. japonicus with special reference to the symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.Not only these metabolic natures but also the phyllotaxy (or morphological nature) are quite different between A. thaliana and L. japonicus. It is currently general idea that the cytokinin-mediated signal transduction plays crucial roles in the maintenance of shoot apical meristem (SAM) and root meristematic niche, and also the pattern formation of leaf primordia (or phyllotaxy).53 Hence, L. japonicus would be one of the plant species of choice to study on mechanisms underlying phyllotaxy in connection with the cytokinin signal transduction.Finally, it should be emphasized that A. thaliana is an annual herb, whereas L. japonicus is a perennial temperate pasture, suggesting that the mechanisms underlying circadian clock-controlled photoperiodic responses might also be different between these species.54,55 Such circadian clock-controlled photoperiodic responses should include the control of flowering time and the formation of freeze-tolerant buds (or SAM) of perennial pasture.56 These are just a few examples that fairly rationalize future studies on TCS-related components in L. japonicus. In short, a comprehensive overview was presented with regard to the TCS-associated components (HKs, HPs, RRs, together with PRRs), in comparison with those of A. thaliana. The database compiled here will provide us with a useful platform, on which one can ask many interesting questions with special reference to the general and optional biological roles of TCS-associated genes in L. japonicus.Supplementary DataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis study was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Priority Areas (19039013 to T.M. and 20061016 to T.Y.) and a Grant-in-Aid for the GCOE Programs (Systems Biology) of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology of Japan.We thank National BioResource Project (Legume Base) (http://www.legumebase.agr.miyazaki-u.ac.jp/index.jsp) for providing us with seeds of L. japonicus, and useful information for laboratory conditions to cultivate this legume.

This observation was evaluated by large-scale gene expression data for four species: Arabidopsis, human, mouse and rat.1 IntroductionThe function of every gene depends on that of another gene(s). To predict gene partnerships, gene coexpression databases can be used, because coexpressed genes are generally expected to be involved in related cellular functions.1 Many technical improvements have been achieved in microarray measurements, and thus coexpression databases are now widely used for various experimental objectives, such as gene targeting, regulatory investigations and/or identification of potential partners in protein–protein interactions.2,3 In addition to target-specified research, gene coexpression data provide a fundamental basis for omics studies such as the metabolome or phenome.4,5 To easily extract pertinent information from gene coexpression data, gene coexpression databases with various analysing tools have been constructed for model organisms.6–14In these databases, gene coexpression data, which are similarities of expression patterns of gene pairs over a number of samples, have been calculated using publicly available gene expression data produced using the Affymetrix GeneChip system, most of which are stored in primary databases such as GEO,15 TAIR16 and NASCArray.17 Calculation of gene coexpression can be divided into the following three general steps: (i) selection of microarray samples, (ii) normalization of gene expression data and (iii) calculation of gene coexpression. In many coexpression databases, the MAS5 algorithm18 is used for GeneChip summarization, and Pearson's correlation coefficients (PCCs) are used to measure gene coexpression. In this paper, we especially focus on coexpression measure for construction and usage of large-scale gene coexpression databases.PCC is one of the most convenient measures to evaluate gene expression similarities1 because it is easy to calculate and is familiar to experimental biologists; still, certain caveats have been reported. Yona et al.19 assessed five coexpression measures based on four types of yeast microarray data. The ‘mass–distance’ measure, which they proposed, showed stably higher performance than others, although the most effective measure differed between data sets. Hardin et al.20 reported the insufficiency of PCC against outliers using a small data set based on 25 microarray slides. de la Fuente et al.21 proposed the use of a partial correlation coefficient with PCC to improve causal properties. Although these studies are valuable for the calculation of gene coexpression, it is difficult to directly apply the results to large-scale database construction, because of its extremely high calculation cost for large-scale collections of gene expression data. Condition-independent gene coexpression data are constructed based on hundreds or thousands of GeneChip data to generalize specific experimental conditions; for example, for Arabidopsis, 1310, 1779 and 1388 GeneChips are used for PED,10 CressExpress12 and ATTED-II,14 respectively. To balance high performance and easy calculation for database construction, we re-examined coexpression measures using large-scale gene expression data. Note that we did not specially focus causal relationship, but effective retrieval of coexpressed genes to find functional partner of a gene(s) of interest.To retrieve coexpressed gene sets, users have to set a threshold of coexpression value, because coexpression databases basically return continuous values indicating how strong the two genes of interest are coexpressed in selected samples. Aoki et al.22 specified a minimal PCC value (0.55–0.66) for coexpressed gene retrieval to minimize false gene function relationships. Because the calculation was based on downloadable coexpression data from ATTED-II,14 this estimation is valuable for the users of this database. However, experimental biologists can now use many coexpression databases that were constructed using different samples and different normalization procedures. In addition, some databases provide their own options for sample selection and/or for coexpression measures other than PCC. Moreover, comparison of coexpression data among different species has been a powerful approach to investigate functional modules.23 A question arising from this situation is whether users can apply a particular threshold (e.g. PCC = 0.6) to retrieve coexpressed genes for any databases with any options as pointed out by Manfield et al.9 Another question is whether the PCC threshold can be applied to any genes for various functions such as direct interactions for protein complex formation, successive reactions by enzymes in a particular metabolic pathway or gene regulatory relationships. The number of coexpressed genes under a particular PCC threshold follows a power-law distribution.24 Namely, a small number of genes are coexpressed with thousands of other genes, whereas a large number of genes are not coexpressed with any (or only a few) other genes. Although PCC is a convenient measure of expression similarity between gene pairs of interest, it may not directly indicate the strength of gene functional relationships. The fundamental question we address here is how the strength of gene functional relationships is affected by calculation procedures or gene functions. For simplicity, we hereafter refer to the strength of a gene functional relationship as ‘biological significance’.In this study, we first investigated characteristics of PCC as a measure of gene coexpression. The problems we found for PCC fall into two categories, both of which lead low comparability of PCC value. The first case is derived from the construction of gene expression data, which includes the selection of microarray samples (a specific condition or a mixture of various conditions) and of GeneChip summarization methods [RMA,25 GCRMA,26 MAS518 or PLIER (Affymetrix Technical Note, http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/technotes/plier_technote.pdf)]. The second case is derived from the variety of cellular functions that the gene of interest concerned. The biological significance of a PCC value depends on each type of coexpression data, and thus users cannot directly compare PCC values obtained from different types of coexpression data. To obtain a comparable coexpression measure, we tested several measures and found that correlation rank could normalize these differences and can be used as the comparable measure. Four model species—Arabidopsis, human, mouse and rat—were used to confirm that the correlation rank was useful to directly compare the coexpression level among different genes, conditions and species.2 Materials and methods2.1 Data source of microarray experimentsTo calculate condition-independent gene coexpression data, we constructed gene expression profiles using as many genes and samples as possible. Towards this end, we selected the GeneChip platforms shown in Supplementary Table S1. Because some samples were manually omitted due to different GeneChip usage, e.g. ChIP-on-chip or heterohybridization of close species, we used the following number of GeneChips; 1388 for Arabidopsis, 5188 for human, 2226 for mouse and 632 for rat. The samples used are shown in the Supplementary data. GeneChip summarizations were performed for each experiment using BioConducter packages.27 PLIER was run with quantile normalization, and an offset of 10 was added to expression values of PLIER and MAS5. If these options were not applied, GO prediction performance in this study significantly decreased (data not shown). All the expression values used in this study were in base-2 logarithm. For each experiment, an average expression level for each gene was subtracted to normalize differences in basal expression levels between experiments. Finally, all experiments were combined into one large expression matrix, which was constructed for each summarization method and for each species.2.2 Calculation of gene-to-gene PCC for gene coexpressionEven if technical replications are normalized, some data (e.g. a large series of time-course experiments under a single biological condition) are biologically redundant and result in unfairly biased gene expression data. Because these unexpected biases will affect the PCC values, we used a gene-to-gene PCC weighted by the following sample information scores WS. The weighted PCC has been applied to evaluate the relationships between two variables with data samples by unbalance manner, and also used for microarray analyses.28,29 The weight WSa for a sample Sa of interest was derived from the sample-to-sample similarity JSa,Sx between the sample Sa and anyone of the sample Sx, which was calculated as PCC between the two samples. To focus on significantly similar samples, we introduced the cut-off threshold C. If the sample similarity JSa,Sx is smaller than the cut-off threshold C, J′Sa,Sx is set to 0. On the other hand, if JSa,Sx is larger than C, J′Sa,Sx= (J′Sa,Sx − C)/(1 − C), so that the range of sample-to-sample similarity J′Sa,Sx becomes 0 to 1. We roughly optimized the cut-off threshold C and used 0.4. We did not carry out a fine optimization because the results were not sensitive to this parameter. The sample redundancy JSa for the sample Sa is calculated as the summation of the J′Sa,Sx, namely ⁠. Because a large JSa value indicates highly redundant and thus a poorly informative sample, weight of the sample Sa, WSa, was defined as the inverse of the square root of the sample redundancy JSa. This procedure is analogous to the calculation of the standard error from the standard deviation, where the number of samples corresponds to the sample redundancy. If the sample S is replicated four times without experimental error, the reliability of the data for the sample S is doubled. Finally, the weighted PCC was calculated between two probes, according to the formula of weighted PCC28 with the weight described here. This weighted PCC was used as PCC in this study. Negative PCC values were used as is, namely treated as weaker relationships than zero PCC value, because negative correlations did not promote gene function prediction in our data (see also Fig. 2C, where red dots indicating the same GO annotation to each of the reference gene did not significantly appear in right-bottom anti-correlation region). The effectiveness of the weight was not fully evaluated and it can be different with data set. In our data set, the weighted PCC gave slightly better performance than non-weighted PCC, but the differences were not so large in our data set.In the case of Arabidopsis, genes with a single probe set are used, so that a probe-to-probe correlation directory indicates gene-to-gene correlation. For human, mouse and rat cases, the probe-to-probe correlations are transformed to gene-to-gene correlations using the maximum correlation value between all pairs of probes between the two genes, because most of genes in these three species are supported by multiple probe sets.2.3 Calculation of PCC rank and mutual rank for gene coexpressionWhen we focus one gene of interest, we can obtain coexpressed gene list sorted by PCC values between the gene of interest and all other genes on the microarray. ‘PCC rank’ used in this study is the rank of the gene in the PCC-ordered gene list. When gene A is third strongly coexpressed genes for gene B, PCC rank of gene A to gene B is 3. This PCC rank was used as one of coexpression measures. Since PCC rank between two genes of interest can be different, we introduced another coexpression measure, mutual rank (MR), by taking a geometric average of the PCC rank from gene A to gene B and that of gene B to gene A. The reason why we used ‘geometric average’ rather than arithmetic average is that we think that the difference of PCC ranks will change as logarithmic manner. For example, the impact of the difference of 1 and 3 in PCC rank can be similar with that of 100 and 300. Actually, the geometric-averaged MR showed slightly better gene prediction performances than arithmetic-averaged MR (data not shown).2.4 Extraction of GO terms for the assessment of gene coexpressionEach of the three categories of Gene Ontology (GO) Annotation,16 namely biological process (BP), cellular component (CC) and molecular function (MF), was used to annotate gene function. Because GO terms have hierarchical topology with different importance, we selected appropriate GO terms to represent gene function. The selection was conducted based on the information content of GO terms.30 All annotations were first mapped to all upper GO terms up to the root terms. Because terms that are associated with too many genes have less informative annotations, and thus could not be used to construct new experiments, we used GO terms associated with >4 and <20 genes. As a result, 729 BP terms, 147 CC terms and 391 MF terms were selected on average for the four species. Although we chose this range of gene numbers (i.e. >4 and <20) based on the characteristics of the randomized coexpressed gene lists to be AUC = 0.5 (see next section for AUC), we reached the same conclusion even using other ranges. The statistics of the selected GO terms are shown in Supplementary Table S2.2.5 Prediction of gene functionWe iteratively applied the nearest neighbour approach to predict GO annotations for each reference gene. The actual procedure was conducted as follows. First, we applied it to GO annotations of the most strongly coexpressed gene to the reference gene. Then, the GO annotations of the second-most strongly coexpressed gene were applied. In the same way, GO annotations of all coexpressed genes were iteratively applied. One of the characteristics of this prediction method is that it does not require parameter optimization. Another characteristic is that we can introduce any thresholds to define valid coexpressed genes. Using the predicted result on various thresholds, we generated receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, which is a plot of true-positive rate [TP/(TP + FN)] against false-positive rate [TN/(FP + TN)] with all possible threshold values, where TP, FN, TN and FP are the number of true positives, false negatives, true negatives and false positives, respectively. In gene function prediction, the number of positive gene-to-function relationships is far smaller than that of negative relationships. To evaluate such unbalanced data, evaluation measure such as overall accuracy, the Mathews correlation coefficient and F-measure is not adequate. A representative ROC curve is shown in Supplementary Fig. S1. Because the ROC curves produced in this analysis showed standard convex-upward shapes, we simply showed the area under the ROC curve (i.e. AUC) to compare the effectiveness of the coexpression data. For example of BP in Arabidopsis, 376 GO annotations for 2280 genes were tested (Supplementary Table S2), where all possible associations were 857 280, and positive associations were 3705. We calculated true- and false-positive rates for all possible thresholds (857 280) to draw the ROC curve, and then AUC were obtained as the average of the true-positive rates for the false-positive rate ranging from 0 to 1 by 0.0001 steps.3 Results and discussion3.1 Problems with PCC valuesWe first used the PCC value as a measure of coexpression but found that the inferred biological significance varied depending on the type of coexpression data. This problem can be attributed to two main factors: (i) different gene expression data and data treatments were used in each database, and (ii) different kinds of cellular functions require differences in the strength of gene coexpression. Examples of these two possibilities for Arabidopsis are shown in Figs 1 and 2, respectively.Distributions of PCC values between each gene and its strongest coexpressed gene in Arabidopsis.

(D) Detailed view of the 0–400 range of C.The first factor is related to the expression data construction. Specifically, it depends on the choice of sample set (Fig. 1A) and the choice of normalization method for the expression data (Fig. 1B). Figure 1 shows the distribution of the gene-to-gene PCCs between each gene and the most strongly coexpressed gene. In Fig. 1A, the black line shows the distribution of the PCC values calculated from the 1388 Arabidopsis GeneChip slides downloaded from TAIR,16 and the red line was calculated from the 237 samples related to developmental experiments (TAIR-ME00319) and the green line was calculated from the 328 samples related to abiotic stresses (from TAIR-ME00325 to ME00330), both of which were a subset of the 1388 samples containing various experimental conditions. As seen in the figure, the red- and green-line distributions are shifted to the right compared with the black-line distribution, indicating that high coexpression around PCC = 0.8 was commonly observed in the PCCs from the developmental samples, whereas high coexpression pairs were rarely observed in the unselected samples (black-line distribution). Two possible reasons—one biological and the other mathematical—can account for the differences in PCC values. The biological reason is that gene expression changes among developmental samples were far larger than those elicited in response to environmental stresses. Such large changes in gene expression amplitude can decrease experimental noises that decrease any gene correlations. Therefore, absolute values of the PCC obtained from developmental experiments will be higher than those from experiments with unselected samples. On the other hand, the mathematical reason is that a smaller sample number tends to produce larger amplitude of correlation values between any two genes as discussed previously.12 This can easily be understood by considering an extreme case using only two microarray slides, for which all the PCC values between the most highly coexpressed gene pair should be 1.0 from the definition of PCC. The mathematical issue can be resolved by using statistical significances of the PCC values. In fact, some coexpression databases, such as ACT,9 CSB.DB7 and CressExpress,12 calculate the statistical significance of every PCC value. In the later part of this paper, we introduced rank of PCC. For a given expression matrix, the effect of rank is identical to PCC and to its P-value, because the order of PCC and its P-value of PCC were identical.In the same way, the choice of the normalization method of microarray data affects the PCC values. Figure 1B shows that distributions of the highest PCCs from RMA- and GCRMA-summarized data manifested as a single peak, whereas those of MAS5 and PLIER were bimodal. The peak around PCC = 0.2 observed in MAS5 and PLIER was derived from genes with low expression level (data not shown), where noises in microarray experiments may strongly affected the observed expression patterns to calculated gene coexpression. Similar to Fig. 1A, high PCC values (e.g. PCC = 0.8) were more frequently observed in RMA- and GCRMA-summarized data, whereas those values were less frequently observed in MAS5- and PLIER-summarized data.Gene function is another factor causing differences in biological significance of a PCC value. In Fig. 2A and B, two examples show relationships between PCC values and gene function. The black line in Fig. 2A indicates PCC values of coexpressed genes to a gene, At3g20000 (mitochondria outer membrane protein TOM40), in descending order. Genes with the same function by GO BP annotation as the reference gene (At3g20000) are highlighted by red dots. Because genes with the same cellular function can be expected to be coexpressed, it is reasonable that the red dots accumulated at the top-left area in the graph. Figure 2B is another example with a different reference gene, At5g06140 (PHOX domain-containing protein). Good accumulation of genes with the same function was again observed in the top-left area. However, the absolute PCC values of the red dots were different in these two graphs. Most of red dots in Fig. 2A accumulated around PCC = 0.6, whereas most red dots in Fig. 2B accumulated around PCC = 0.3. This observation suggested that the required strength of gene coexpression might be different for each reference gene. At3g20000 (Fig. 2A) requires stronger gene coexpression than At5g06140 (Fig. 2B) to realize its function. To check the generality of this observation, the correlation curves for all genes were overlaid in Fig. 2C and D (Fig. 2D is a close-up view of Fig. 2C). If the absolute value of PCC directly indicates biological significance, these red dots should accumulate in the upper area in these graphs. This was not the case, however, as they accumulated in the left-most region. Especially in the region of the top-most 20 genes, there is almost no relationship between the PCC values and functional relationship. These results suggest that the rank of PCC is a more effective measure of coexpression (to identify functionally related genes) than the PCC value itself. In the following sections, we focus on the characteristics of the rank of PCC value for each reference gene, which we call ‘PCC rank’ against normal ‘PCC value’, hereafter.3.2 PCC rank can normalize inconsistencies caused by different sample compositions or different GeneChip summarization methodsFrom the analyses of the relationship between PCC value and gene function, we proposed that the PCC rank might be a good measure of coexpression. Next, we assessed how PCC rank is affected by differences in expression data observed in Fig. 1. We observed the distribution between developmental samples and all samples for PCC values (Fig. 3A, left) and PCC ranks (Fig. 3A, right), and that between RMA- and GCRMA-summarized data for PCC value (Fig. 3B, left) and PCC rank (Fig. 3B, right). The left panel of Fig. 3A is a density plot between PCC values calculated from 1388 Arabidopsis GeneChips on the x-axis and PCC values calculated from 237 developmental samples on the y-axis. Each original dot was calculated for all gene pairs and shown as a density plot in logarithmic scale. The distribution was a broad S-shape, indicating weak correspondence of the two types of PCC values. On the other hand, when we used PCC rank instead of PCC value, the distribution aligned on the diagonal (Fig. 3A, right panel), meaning there was a linear correspondence of PCC ranks between the different samples. Notably, the genes in the highest (bottom-left) and the lowest (top-right) rank regions were highly populated between the two types of coexpression data, indicating that PCC ranks, as opposed to PCC values, were robust with respect to different sample compositions when the correlation was relatively high in each reference gene. In the same way, differences in PCC values caused by different GeneChip summarization methods shown in Fig. 1B can be normalized by PCC rank (Fig. 3B). Although it was generally well correlated in both panels, some gene pairs showed exceptionally high values for GCRMA in PCC value (Fig. 3B, left) as was the case in Fig. 1B. Again, these PCC ranks showed very good agreement (Fig. 2B, right). This result indicated that PCC rank was more stable than PCC value with respect to the selection of GeneChip summarization methods, and thus is suitable as a comparable coexpression measure. Correspondence between RMA-MAS5 and MAS5-PLIER showed similar results (Supplementary Fig. S2). Our observation that PCC values obtained after GCRMA summarization were higher than those obtained after RMA summarization is consistent with the report for GCRMA problems by Lim et al.,31 and thus these problematic characteristics of GCRMA may be a general feature.Inconsistency of the PCC values and consistency of the PCC ranks for differently constructed expression data.

All distributions are represented by density plots in logarithmic scale.PCC values and its distribution on a given set of experiments can also be affected by the quality of microarray data, where more noise in microarray experiments causes lower PCC values. On the other hand, we can neglect the original PCC values and its distributions by taking the rank of the PCC values. This may be one of the reasons why rank-based values can compare different coexpression data. As inextricably linked aspect of this comparability, rank-based values do not include any information to estimate the quality of original microarray data. This phenomenon is quite similar with RMA summarization of GeneChip compared with MAS5, where the rank of probe intensity is used to reconstruct common distribution.3.3 Large-scale assessment of PCC rank and MRFor large-scale assessment of PCC rank, we predicted gene function using coexpressed gene lists sorted by PCC value or by PCC rank and compared the results, because many recent studies used gene coexpression data to identify gene function (see review22). After constructing a coexpressed gene list for each gene, we predicted GO annotations assigned to the reference gene using the following procedure (see Section 2 for details). First, the GO annotations for the gene that was most strongly coexpressed with the reference gene were applied as the first prediction. Then, the GO annotations of the second-most strongly coexpressed gene were applied, and so forth until all coexpressed genes under a given threshold of coexpression were applied. On the basis of ROC curves of this prediction, the AUCs were compared as prediction performance. AUC = 1.0 indicates a perfect prediction, whereas AUC = 0.5 means random prediction. We evaluated the performance for each GO category, i.e. BP, CC and MF.We compared the performance of the GO annotation prediction based on PCC values and PCC ranks (Fig. 4). In all the cases for GO BP, CC and MF predictions, PCC rank was more effective than PCC value. This result agreed well with the result in Fig. 2D, which showed that genes with same GO BP annotation accumulated in the high PCC rank region (the left-most region in Fig. 2D) rather than the high PCC value region (top region in Fig. 2D). Note here that we introduced ‘MR’ by taking a geometric average of the PCC rank from gene A to gene B and that of gene B to gene A, because the two ranks between genes A and B are usually different and thus are not convenient to use like a PCC value. The performance of MR was almost the same as or slightly better than PCC rank (Fig. 4). To further confirm the statistical significance of the difference between PCC value and the other two measures, we randomly selected half of the entire genes, and constructed PCC table and calculated PCC rank and MR, and then AUCs of gene function predictions were obtained as the same procedure in this study. This procedure was repeated 100 times and calculated the standard deviation of the difference of AUCs. The result showed clear difference in performances between PCC value and the rank-based measures (Supplementary Table S3). Note that no difference between PCC rank and MR was observed.Effect of rank-based coexpression measures to predict GO annotations. The y-axis indicates AUCs to predict three types of GO annotations (BP, CC and MF) from gene coexpression data represented by PCC value, PCC rank and MR.

BP, biological process; CC, cellular component; MF, molecular function.Our observation that PCC value was less effective for predicting gene function than PCC rank is probably a consequence of the different requirements of coexpression for different biological functions. When we consider genes for a protein complex, strength of required gene coexpression may depend on the stability of monomers. Strong coexpression should be required for unstable monomers, whereas loose coexpression may be sufficient for stable monomers, the half-life of which may be regulated by phosphorylation and/or protein subcellular localization. In the same way, when we consider genes for enzymes of a particular metabolic pathway, strength of required gene coexpression may depend on the stability or toxicity of the metabolites.

xpression of the enzyme genes will be required.PCC is not the only measure of gene coexpression. For example, Spearman's correlation coefficient (SCC), mutual information content and partial correlation have also been used in gene coexpression studies.21,31,32 According to our results, the performance of PCC and SCC values was almost the same for GO term prediction (Supplementary Fig. S3). Although PCC may still have limitations with respect to outliers, as reported previously,20 the outlier effect was smaller in large-scale microarray data. Compared with the difference between SCC and PCC values, PCC rank is very different from PCC value. It may be understood by considering that SCC value as well as PCC value is two-body relationship whereas PCC rank is multi-body relationship, i.e. PCC value can be calculated from just two genes of interest, and PCC rank reflects the distribution of PCC value around the two genes of interest. In this sense, the relationship between SCC and PCC values was more similar than that of PCC value and PCC rank. This viewpoint was also supported by our preliminary observation that SCC rank had a similar effect to PCC rank (data not shown).3.4 Performance of PCC rank and MR in other speciesAlthough to this point we have focused solely on Arabidopsis data, we also tested the effectiveness of PCC rank and MR with respect to gene coexpression in other species to evaluate the generalities of PCC rank. We used RMA-summarized data for Arabidopsis (Fig. 4), and here we show the results with different GeneChip summarization methods (GCRMA,25 MAS518 and PLIER) for different model species (human, mouse and rat), which have been used in several gene coexpression databases. Because the pattern of the results was almost the same for the BP, CC and MF categories of GO (Fig. 4), we show only the average AUC values for the other species and other normalization methods (Fig. 5). Figure 5A shows the results of the gene function prediction in Arabidopsis. AUC values on the y-axis were compared for three coexpression measures (PCC value, PCC rank and MR) and for four GeneChip summarization methods (RMA, GCRMA, MAS5 and PLIER). For all four GeneChip summarization methods, PCC rank and MR showed higher prediction efficiency than PCC values. Figure 4B–D shows the results for human, mouse and rat, respectively. Although the gene expression data for the four species were completely different with respect to sample size and sample composition and the quality or density of GO terms is quite different in each species, PCC rank and MR were consistently more effective at predicting gene function than PCC value, strongly suggesting that the relatively higher performance of PCC rank is a general feature.Effect of summarization methods for GO predictions. The four types of summarization methods were assessed for their ability to predict GO annotations. The y-axes indicate average AUC values of the ROC curves to predict GO BP, CC and MF. Note that the AUCs on the y-axis do not start from 0.5, which corresponds to random prediction, because we focused on differences of AUCs rather than the absolute value of AUCs.Effect of summarization methods for GO predictions.

The selection of the GeneChip summarization method is one of the most analysed issues of GeneChip data. Although many studies have compared GeneChip summarizations, there has been no general consensus. For example, Irizarry et al.33 showed superiority of GCRMA, whereas relatively low performance of GCRMA was shown by titration experiments.34 Srinivasasainagendra et al.12 discussed RMA superiority compared with GCRMA and MAS5 based on their unpublished result using redundant probeset pairs, which should be separated from the probeset pairs randomly selected. This disagreement is partially caused by different assessment systems. The focus of our assessment was to obtain more information from gene coexpression data. From this point of view, Lim et al.31 reported MAS5 superiority and the requirement for GCRMA modification when using human GeneChip data. Although our results do not support the inferiority of GCRMA, MAS5 showed the highest performance for humans and, in that sense, supports the results by Lim et al.31 As for basic properties of GeneChip summarization methods, MAS5 returns relatively high accuracy of gene expression values, but reproducibility of the value is relatively low compared with other summarization methods.33 Because the number of human samples was larger (5188 samples) than that for the other species (1388, 2226 and 632 samples for Arabidopsis, mouse and rat, respectively), the shortcoming of low reproducibility using MAS5 summarization may be overcome by a large number of samples. In fact, when we used 500 randomly selected human samples instead of all 5188 samples, MAS5 showed lower performance than RMA (data not shown). However, MAS5 still has merits to construct coexpression data, because it can be applied to a single GeneChip slide and because the number of available data from MAS5 in public database is larger than that from other methods which requires raw data registrations. Note that we did not use detection call of MAS5 (Present, Marginal and Absent), which provides significance of expression against background noise. Although the effectiveness of detection call of MAS5 has been reported,35 we did not use it to avoid managements of missing values. This probably caused lower performance of MAS5.3.6 Gene coexpression data for Arabidopsis are more powerful than those for mammalian speciesThe AUC of GO term prediction for Arabidopsis genes was higher than for the mammalian genes (Fig. 5). This may be because Arabidopsis has a simpler morphology and gene structure than mammals, i.e. Arabidopsis has fewer tissues and a lower degree of tissue differentiation. For example, flowering plant tissues have totipotency, and thus the developmental programme for each tissue can be maintained independently, e.g. cutting the bulb is not lethal. On the other hand, Arabidopsis has many paralogous genes to increase the variation of transcripts instead of using an alternative splicing strategy that is common in mammals.36 This characteristic in Arabidopsis probably results in a more accurate measurement of the gene expression pattern, because gene expression microarrays cannot distinguish between splicing variants. Also, the sample variety of GeneChip data might be higher in Arabidopsis. The GeneChip data for Arabidopsis include many time-course experiments for external stimuli in addition to precise tissue samples collected by AtGenExpress,37–39 whereas this type of experiment may be more difficult to obtain for mammalian species. In fact, gene coexpression data are extensively used for gene targeting in Arabidopsis research, whereas this is not a major approach used in mammalian studies.3.7 MR effects on hierarchical clusteringTo evaluate the effect of MR on multiple reference genes, we conducted hierarchical clustering using PCC or MR as the metric; (1 − PCC) was used as the PCC metric. Since the result of hierarchical clustering depends on a selected linkage rule, we applied seven methods available in ‘hclust’ function of statistical package R (http://www.r-project.org). To assess hierarchical clustering result, we counted the number of junction whose nodes are filled with a single GO annotation, i.e. the nodes with the same function (Supplementary Fig. S4A). As a result, MR metric showed generally better performance than PCC metric, and the difference between MR and PCC was remarkable for single, centroid and median linkage methods (Supplementary Fig. S4B–D). It may be noteworthy that MR showed very stable performance for every linkage method compared with the variable performances in PCC values. This result may suggest that MR already included some effects caused by multiple gene reference induced by some linkage rules as average, mcquitty, ward and complete, where all pairs of the cluster members are considered to calculate the distance between clusters.3.8 ConclusionIn this study, we investigated the characteristics of PCC (value and rank) as a coexpression measure. The biological significance of PCC could be altered by expression data construction and gene function. We found that PCC rank could normalize differences in biological significance, and we propose a new measure for coexpression analysis, MR, because a single index for a pair of gene is more convenient. MR is easy to calculate from PCC and can be directly compared among different coexpression data. This universality of MR enabled us to introduce a common threshold to all reference genes and to calculate average distances among multiple genes. As a consequence, hierarchical clustering and a combined coexpressed gene list for multiple reference genes can be available more effectively. Tools for these functions based on MR are available in our databases.13,14Although selection of the GeneChip summarization method strongly affected the performance of coexpression data, MR could reduce the difference. This result applies directly to coexpression database construction, because much of the GeneChip expression data have been stored in public repositories as MAS5-summarized data. Our results provide a standard calculation procedure for condition-independent gene coexpression data to elucidate gene-to-gene functional relationships.The generalities and easy calculation of PCC rank or MR will enable the users to directly compare results obtained from different coexpression databases, and this will strongly promote comparative transcriptomics using public databases. Searching conserved coexpression is one of the possible important applications, which is also provided in our databases.13,14 In this study, we did not pay attention to anti-correlation. To analyse anti-correlation using rank-based measures, some normalization such as taking percentile of PCC rank or MR may be useful to standardize the measures from zero to one.3.9 Data availabilityCoexpression data represented by the PCC value and the MR based on RMA-summarized GeneChip data used in this study are available at (http://atted.jp/download.shtml) for Arabidopsis and (http://coxpresdb.jp/download.shtml) for human, mouse and rat.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by a grant-in-aid from the Institute for Scientific Research on Priority Areas from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan to K.K. and by the Global COE Program (Center of Education and Research for Advanced Genome-Based Medicine), MEXT," Japan to T.O.Supplementary data""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CisFinder also showed robust performance in the identification of motifs that were only slightly enriched in a set of DNA sequences.1. IntroductionTranscription factor (TF) binding motifs in eukaryotes have been identified by examining binding sequences of purified TFs (e.g. SELEX1 and Protein Binding Microarrays2) and by carrying out chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq3–5) and microarray (ChIP-chip).6 The ChIP methods can account for biological context of TF binding7–10 because many TFs require co-factors for sequence-specific binding to DNA, which are not present in in vitro assays. On the other hand, TF binding sites identified in the ChIP methods will include not only direct binding sites but also binding sites indirectly associated with the TF through the protein–protein interaction of other TFs that binds directly to DNA. Furthermore, ChIP-seq data often include several million sequence tags and >10 000 binding locations.4,9,11 These features of high-throughput genome-wide ChIP technology make the bioinformatic task of identifying TF binding motifs a great challenge.Various software tools have been developed to identify over-represented DNA sequence motifs (reviewed in Das and Dai,12 Sandve et al.,13 and Tompa et al.14). For example, traditional probabilistic methods include expectation maximization (MEME15), Gibbs sampling,7,16 genetic algorithms (GAME17), integrated Bayesian models,18 neural networks, support vector machines, Bayesian additive regression trees,19 and approximate maximum a posteriory (MAP) scoring functions.20 These methods work well when data sets are small, and thus, only a small fraction of top-scored binding sites is usually processed with these algorithms.10 Weeder, which is based on counting matching patterns with a certain maximum number of mismatches, has been reported to outperform many other software tools.14 However, most existing algorithms are limited to searching only for a single motif at a time. To find additional motifs, the software has to be run again after removing the first motif from the sequence.15 With this approach, results may be different depending on the order in which motifs are processed. For example, a composite motif that supports binding of two TFs (TF1 and TF2) may be lost if a more abundant motif (TF1) is processed first and then removed from the sequence. Machine-learning algorithms, such as Gibbs sampler and neural networks, tend to fall into local maxima7 and often fail to differentiate between similar motifs.In this paper, we present a new algorithm for de novo identification of over-represented DNA motifs, which is implemented as the online software tool CisFinder (http://lgsun.grc.nia.nih.gov/CisFinder). It is a complementary method to existing probabilistic algorithms and has advantages in the exploratory analysis of large input files typical for ChIP-chip or ChIP-seq data sets. CisFinder can effectively process large sequences (up to 50 Mb), extract a comprehensive list of over-represented motifs in a single run, and analyze data with poor enrichment of DNA-binding motifs. Because of high processing speed (<1 min for complete data analyses), the software can be used in an interactive manner to test many different parameter sets. The software has been tested using available ChIP-seq data on TFs expressed in ES cells.92.

The variance of word counts is very close to the mean, which is expected from the Poisson distribution. This was also checked using pseudo-random sequences generated with the third order Markov process. For example, if word counts are 120 in the test set of sequences and 40 in the control set (i.e. 3-fold over-representation), then the relative error (accuracy) is equal to sqrt(120 + 40)/(120–40) = 0.158.2.2 Implementation of the method for PFM estimationA successful ChIP-seq experiment generates a set of genome locations that are enriched in TF binding sites. For a test sequence set, we usually extract 200 bp sequence segments centered at a peak of projected TF binding sites. For a control sequence set, we usually extract 500 bp sequence segments starting from nucleotide positions 400 bp away from both ends of 200 bp test sequence segments. (However, the CisFinder allows users to choose different sequence lengths.) The CisFinder identifies binding motifs of TFs using direct counts of all possible 8-mer words with and without gaps in both test and control sequence sets (Fig. 1F). This word length was selected experimentally based on the observation that longer words have too few matches in target sequences, whereas shorter words may fail to capture the most informative portion of the motif and show lower rates of over-representation. (Note: the command-line version of CisFinder allows the use of 6- and 10-mer words.) Word counts are stored in the array of integers. Although there are many different ways to insert gaps in the 8-mer words, we consider only 8 specific patterns of gap insertions (Fig. 1F). We found that this limited set of gap insertion effectively helps to capture composite motifs with multiple functional elements. For example, search for a word ‘ATGCAAAT’ with a 2 bp gap in the middle is equivalent to the search for word ‘ATGCNNAAAT’. PFM is then estimated for each word based on >1.5-fold (default threshold) enrichment in the test sequences compared with the control sequences using Equation (e2). The adjustable fold enrichment criterion is optional (it can be set to 1), which provides additional flexibility in the use of the program.Over-representation of word counts in the test sequences compared with the control sequences is then evaluated using a z-score which is estimated based on the hypergeometric probability distribution. Let us first consider the case where only one instance of each word is counted per each sequence of equal (or approximately equal) length. The proportion of sequences, q, with a given word in the set of test sequences is compared with the proportion of sequences, p, with the same word in the combined set of test and control sequences (if the null-hypothesis is true, then test and control sets of sequences can be combined) with z-score:  where n is the number of test sequences, and N is the number of combined test and control sequences. If multiple instances of each word are counted per each sequence, then the method is modified as follows. The set of test sequences with the total length T is split into T/m segments of length m, where m is the actual length of the word including gaps. Each instance of the word is then associated with the segment where it starts. Because overlapping instances of the same word are counted as one instance, there is not more than one instance associated with the same segment. Similarly, the set of control sequences with the total length C is split into C/m segments of length m. We use the same equation for the z-score (see above) where q is the proportion of test segments with the word, p is the proportion of test and control segments with the word, n = T/m, and N = (T + C)/m. Although occurrences of word instances in adjacent segments may be weakly correlated, the hypergeometric distribution gives a reasonable approximation of the z-score.To fill the gaps and extend the length of PFMs, the test and control sequences are searched again for the exact match to each word with z > 1.643 (to satisfy the condition of P < 0.05 for one-tail z-test). Each match of the word in the test (or control) sequence is then examined for nucleotides in the gaps and flanking sequences (2 bp at each side) that are not included in the word. In this way, we can count nucleotide frequencies in gaps and flanking regions and estimate the PFM for these positions using Equation (e2) (Fig. 1G). The program is also designed to trim flanking sequences if they are not informative (if the ratio of maximum frequency to minimum frequency is <3). To increase the information content of PFMs, we use the contrasting procedure: the median of minimum PFM values at each position is subtracted from all PFM values; negative values are then replaced by zero; and the PFM is re-normalized.The frequency distribution of nucleotides in the flanking regions and in gaps of a certain word may differ substantially between the test and control sets of sequences. In such a case, this difference can be used to increase the statistical power for identification of significant motifs. To incorporate this factor into the statistical evaluation of motif significance, we compared frequency distributions of nucleotides (counted for each nucleotide and each flanking/gap position) in the test and control sequences using the G-test.21 Assuming that this test is independent from the z-test for over-representation of word counts (see above), we combined P-values from these tests using Fisher's method.22 Finally, we used the false discovery rate (FDR) to account for simultaneous testing of multiple hypotheses.23 We designed the program to generate at least 100 top-scored motifs and additional motifs, if they satisfy the criterion of FDR < 0.05.PFMs are then clustered based on similarity and/or co-occurrence (Fig. 1H). Various methods have been proposed to measure the similarity of PFMs, including Bayesian models.24 Here, we use a simpler method and measure similarity by Pearson correlation between elements of the corresponding position weight matrices (PWMs) for all overlapping positions, where PWM is derived from PFM by log-transformation: xij = log(pij/qj), xij is the weight of nucleotide j in position i, pij the probability to find nucleotide j in position i, and qj the background frequency of nucleotide j. For simplicity, here equal background frequencies (qj = 0.25) are assumed and zero probabilities are avoided by adding pseudo-count = 1 to nucleotide counts in the PFM. Offset and orientation of motifs are selected based on the maximum correlation, restricted to the minimum overlap of 6 bp and maximum overhang of 2 bp. Because correlation is estimated for a minimum of six overlapping positions, there are at least 24 points (six positions × four nucleotides) for estimating correlation. Thus, even low correlation is significant (e.g. r = 0.5; d.f. = 22; P < 0.05). Therefore, the default correlation threshold set in CisFinder (r = 0.7) is always significant (however, users can also adjust the correlation threshold to increase or decrease the size of clusters). As a measure of motif similarity, we use a correlation between PWM elements rather than a previously proposed correlation between PFM elements,25 because the log-transformation increases the contribution of low values to the correlation and represents the binding strength of TFs better. For example, the difference between probabilities 0.99 and 0.7 corresponds to the 1.41-fold change in binding strength, whereas the same difference between probabilities 0.01 and 0.3 corresponds to the 30-fold change in binding strength. After log-transformation (log10), the difference in the second pair of probabilities (1.477) is greater than that in the first pair (0.151).We use single-linkage clustering, and then each cluster is checked for homogeneity. If the cluster is not homogeneous, it is separated into subclusters using the second round of clustering. Subclustering is done iteratively starting from a pair of seed motifs, adding sequentially most similar motifs, and re-estimating the combined PFM for the subcluster. Each pair of motifs is characterized by the score =r m1m2, where r is the correlation between PWMs, and m1 and m2 are the numbers of linked members for motifs 1 and 2, respectively. Then the pair with the highest score is selected as a seed for the subcluster. This procedure is different from the single-linkage clustering because motifs are added to the subcluster based on the similarity to the combined PFM of all motifs that are already included into the subcluster, whereas the single-linkage clustering is based on the similarity between individual (non-combined) motifs. Motifs are added until no motif within the cluster can be added to the subcluster using the given threshold of similarity. If all elements in the cluster appear to be in the same subcluster, then the cluster is considered homogeneous. Otherwise, the elements of the subcluster are removed from the cluster, and the same algorithm is applied to the remaining elements.As an alternative criterion for clustering, the CisFinder also uses co-occurrence of word instances in the test sequences. This method is generally less accurate than the similarity-based method because of the limited number of word pairs in the sequence set. We, therefore, designed the program to use the correlation-based clustering method as a default. However, the co-occurrence method may help to cluster PFMs with a high level of self-similarity (after shifting a position by 1–4 bp), because their relative positions cannot be uniquely identified based on the correlation. Further details of the algorithm implementation are available in Supplementary Text S1 and online (http://lgsun.grc.nia.nih.gov/CisFinder).292.3 Implementation of additional tool to search for motifs that match to PFMs2.4 Data sets used in this studyCisFinder was tested using published ChIP-seq data on binding of 14 TFs [CTCF, ESRRB, KLF4, MYC, POU5F1 (also known as OCT4 or OCT3/4), SMAD1, SOX2, STAT3, TCFCP2L2, ZFX, P300, NMYC, NANOG, E2F1] in ES cells9 (Supplementary Table S1). We also used a deliberately selected low-quality subset of ChIP-PET data10 on binding of POU5F1 to test if CisFinder can process sequences with low enrichment of binding motifs. We used genome locations with 2 (N = 19 803) and 3 ditags (N = 3361) from POU5F1 ChIP-PET that did not include loci with additional NANOG ditags to avoid indirect binding effects (Supplementary Table S2). All binding regions were mapped to the latest mouse genome (mm9, NCBI/NIH) using the UCSC coordinate conversion tool (http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgLiftOver).3. Results and discussion3.1 CisFinder algorithm and its main featuresThe proposed CisFinder algorithm, which is implemented as an online software tool,29 is described in detail in Section 2. In brief, CisFinder has the following features. CisFinder algorithm is based on detecting over-represented short words (i.e. nucleotide sequences) in a sequence and clustering them. Unlike oligo-analysis (RSAT)26, which is also based on the same concept but clusters exact words, CisFinder clusters PFMs that represent binding motifs more accurately than exact words.CisFinder algorithm analyzes words with gaps and expands PFMs over the gaps and flanking regions.CisFinder uses real control sequences to compare against test sequences. This helps to process repeat regions, because motifs that are specific to repeat sequences are expected to be equally abundant in the test and control sets of sequences [thus, the difference of motif frequencies (e1) is close to zero]. Because mammalian functional TF binding sites are often located in repeat regions,32 the ability to search for motifs without removing repeat sequences is useful. An option to use randomized model sequence (a third-order Markov process with probabilities extracted from the test sequences) as control is also provided.CisFinder is designed to carry out exhaustive searches for all over-represented DNA motifs in a single run. It combines motifs only at the clustering step, and users can adjust the correlation threshold used for clustering to make clusters bigger or smaller.CisFinder includes auxiliary functions: comparison of DNA motifs with databases of known binding motifs of TFs,33,34 search for motifs that match to PFMs, visualization of sequences and TF binding motifs with a CisView browser34 and UCSC genome browser,35 and extraction of sequence fractions and subsets of sequences.3.2 CisFinder algorithm accurately identifies PFMs of TF binding motifsTo test the performance of the new algorithm, we used ChIP-seq data for 12 TFs associated with the pluripotent state of ES cells.9 We extracted 200 bp sequence segments centered at TF binding locations identified with ChIP-seq and compared them with control sequences (i.e. 500 bp sequence segments starting from nucleotide positions 400 bp away from both ends of 200 bp test sequence segments). Clustering of PFMs generates highly consistent TF binding motifs that were independent from the correlation threshold used for clustering (Fig. 2A). In contrast, clustering over-represented 8-mer words using the RSAT26 resulted in long aberrant motifs because of the chain effect of clustering. All 12 motifs identified with CisFinder matched well with motifs found by Chen et al.9 with Weeder (Fig. 2B), indicating that the quality of results is comparable. Unlike other existing tools, CisFinder has also generated PFMs for additional over-represented motifs at the same time. Utility of such additional motifs will be presented and discussed below (Sections 3.3–3.5).Testing CisFinder algorithm. (A) Binding motifs of POU5F1 generated by clustering of PFMs (with CisFinder) and over-represented 8-mer words. Binding motifs of TFs in ES cells identified with CisFinder.

(B) Comparison of TF binding motifs generated by Chen et al.9 using Weeder and motifs generated with CisFinder. (C–E) Binding motifs of POU5F1, ESRRB, and CTCF, respectively, identified with CisFinder.Computation time for all steps of the CisFinder algorithm ranged from 5 to 120 s (Supplementary Table S1), with median time 38 s needed to process a 7.5 Mb sequence (sum of test and control sequences). Our estimate is that our software works >1000 times faster than both MEME15 and Weeder36 and >100 times faster than RSAT.26 The MDscan20 works fast; however, it is designed to process a small number of sequences (from 20 to 400, see http://ai.stanford.edu/~xsliu/MDscan), and the online version of the software accepts only 200 sequences.Taken together, the data indicate that CisFinder works faster than existing tools without sacrificing sensitivity. It is, however, difficult to make a fair comparison between tools for sensitivities and calculation speeds because each tool was designed to process different types of data. CisFinder was developed to process ChIP-seq or ChIP-chip data, which typically include several thousands of sequences (i.e. a few megabase) and cannot be effectively processed by probabilistic methods (e.g. MEME and Weeder). On the other hand, the probabilistic methods works efficiently on relatively small numbers of sequences (e.g. a typical benchmark sequence set is <32 kb13), as they are designed to process a small data set by selecting only high-scoring sequences. However, the reduction in the data set often leads to the loss of useful information, as we describe below (Section 3.3).3.3 Cisfinder algorithm detects alternative binding motifsEukaryotic transcription regulation is extremely complex, and most TFs have multiple binding motifs, which correspond to direct binding of single TFs, tandems of identical TFs in various orientations and spacings, binding with various co-factors, and finally, indirect binding via protein–protein interactions with other TFs. Analysis from 50 to 200 high-score binding sites (which is a typical data size for MEME or Weeder) is usually sufficient to extract the main motif, but it is often not sufficient to examine alternative motifs. For example, Chen et al.9 used Weeder36 and reported only a single motif for each TF. In contrast, using the same data set, CisFinder was able to find multiple motifs for each TF, e.g. POU5F1 (also known as OCT4 or OCT3/4), ESRRB, and CTCF (Fig. 2C–E).For the POU5F1, predicted alternative binding motifs included several palindromes (Fig. 2C, b–f). Previous studies have already shown that these motifs are also functional: (b) is a ‘MORE’ motif,37 (e) is a ‘PORE’ motif,38 and (c) is a part of two motifs identified by Tantin et al.39 On the other hand, CisFinder could not detect a well-known OCT–3N–SOX composite motif with a 3 bp spacer between OCT and SOX motifs, which is located in the enhancer of Fgf4.40 To investigate this issue, we searched for this motif in ChIP-selected sequences using a PFM derived from the regular OCT–SOX composite motif after adding a 3 bp spacer. Because OCT–SOX and OCT–3N–SOX motifs are similar, we counted sites only if they matched more strongly to OCT–3N–SOX than to OCT–SOX motif. We found that the OCT–3N–SOX motif was indeed present in ChIP–POU5F1 sites (Supplementary Fig. S1), but its abundance was too low (20-fold less abundant than OCT–SOX motif) to be detected de novo with a statistical confidence.For the estrogen-related receptor beta (ESRRB), CisFinder predicted 12 alternative binding motifs (Fig. 2D), all of which represented different repeat configurations of the same elementary motif AGGTCA. In direct repeats (i.e. repeats in the same orientation) (a–g), monomers were spaced by either 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 bp. In inverted repeats, the spacing between monomers was less flexible. When the first monomer had a positive orientation (h–j), then inverted repeats were spaced by either −3, 0, or 3 bp (−3 means 3 bp overlap). However, when the first monomer had negative orientation (k and l), then motifs were spaced by either 2 or 6 bp. Akter et al.41 tested 12 paired motifs (direct and inverted) with the competitive EMSA and found the increased binding of estrogen-related receptors to direct repeats with 0, 2, and 4 bp spacing and to inverted repeats with 0 and 3 bp spacing. Thus, the in vivo ChIP-seq data confirmed in vitro EMSA data by Akter et al., although the motifs (h), (k), and (l) found in the ChIP-seq data (Fig. 2D) were not tested by Akter et al. Our results indicate that ESRRB can bind in vivo to direct repeats spaced by 1, 3, and 5 bp despite weak competitiveness in EMSA, presenting the largest set of alternative binding motifs detected for the ESRRB.For the CTCF (an insulator in the regulation of transcription42), several alternative binding motifs were detected. The main DNA motif enriched in ChIP–CTCF loci (Fig. 2E, a) matched well to the motifs identified in earlier studies43–45 (Supplementary Fig. S2). Furthermore, CisFinder identified several alternative binding motifs for CTCF (b–e), including three palindromes (b–d). However, further experimental validation is needed to prove that these motifs are indeed functional.3.4 CisFinder algorithm detects binding motifs of potential co-factorsGenome locations identified with ChIP for a specific TF often do not carry the primary or alternative binding motifs, but are enriched with binding motifs for other TFs (cofactors). The most likely interpretation of this phenomenon is that the TF used for the immunoprecipitation binds to DNAs indirectly through binding to a co-factor that directly binds to DNA. Thus, the analysis of co-factor binding motifs may help to infer potential mechanisms of transcription regulation.To explore this issue, we first selected 22 motifs that were over-represented in ChIP loci for single or multiple TFs reported by Chen et al.9 and used the corresponding PFMs generated by CisFinder to search for these motifs in 200 bp DNA segments centered at ChIP loci (Fig. 3). Some of these motifs were well characterized and supported the bindings of known TFs (e.g. ESRRB, GABP, ATF1, and TEF). A motif MIT-008 was shown to be over-represented in mammalian promoters,46 although a TF binding to these sites remains unknown. We also found a novel motif (AP4-L) which is similar to the V$AP4_01 binding motif in TRANSFAC.47 The YY1 motif may correspond to ZFP42 (=REX1) binding because both TFs have nearly identical motifs.48,49Motifs of TFs and their co-factors over-represented in ChIP-seq (data from Chen et al.9) distal binding sites (200 bp segments centered at binding sites and located 500–100 000 bp away from transcription start sites) compared with flanking regions 500–1000 bp away from binding sites. Motifs were selected if they were over-represented by >2-fold for at least one TF; search was done with CisFinder using the option of one false positive match per 10 kb. Groups of TFs and binding motifs with high over-representation rate are outlined.Motifs of TFs and their co-factors over-represented in ChIP-seq (data from Chen et al.9) distal binding sites (200 bp segments centered at binding sites and located 500–100 000 bp away from transcription start sites) compared with flanking regions 500–1000 bp away from binding sites. Motifs were selected if they were over-represented by >2-fold for at least one TF; search was done with CisFinder using the option of one false positive match per 10 kb. Groups of TFs and binding motifs with high over-representation rate are outlined.Next, we compared the abundance of these motifs in the 200 bp DNA segments centered at ChIP loci with the control sequences (i.e. 500 bp sequence segments starting from nucleotide positions 400 bp away from both ends of 200 bp test sequence segments). To obtain a homogeneous data set, we used only the ChIP loci that were located at >500 bp away from the transcription start sites of genes (distal ChIP loci). Another reason to focus on the distal ChIP loci was that pluripotency-related TFs, such as POU5F1 and NANOG, are active mostly at distal locations rather than at proximal promoters.10 We then tabulated the motif abundance data and found that TFs and corresponding binding motifs formed three distinctive groups (Fig. 3, Supplementary Table S3). The first group (group #1) included the major pluripotency-related TFs (POU5F1, SOX2, and NANOG) as well as SMAD1 and P300. As expected, the strongest binding motif in this group was the OCT–SOX composite motif. OCT motif alone was associated mostly with POU5F1 binding, whereas SOX2 motif alone, which was known previously as SOX9 (V$SOX9_B1) in TRANSFAC,47 was associated mostly with binding of SOX2, NANOG, and SMAD1. A novel motif AP4-L was associated with binding of all TFs in the group #1, but the association was strongest for SMAD1 and NANOG. A TEF motif was most abundant in P300 binding locations. The second group (group #2) included STAT3, KLF4, ESRRB, and TCFCP2L1. The third group (group #3) included MYC, NMYC, ZFX, and E2F1 (Fig. 3). Although it is tempting to speculate that these TFs in each group form a protein complex, drawing such a conclusion requires further evidence for the presence of such protein complexes in the ES cells.We also noticed that some DNA motifs were negatively associated with binding of some TFs, which may indicate the inhibition of DNA binding. For example, the major OCT4 palindrome motifs, OCT4-GCGC and OCT4-MORE, were strongly under-represented in many ChIP loci including binding sites of pluripotency-related TFs (NANOG, SOX2, STAT3, KLF4) (green color), except for POU5F1 that bound to these motifs (Fig. 3). This suggests that palindrome POU5F1 motifs are likely to be involved in a different cellular function than supporting ES cell pluripotency. The OCT–SOX and SOX2 motifs alone were negatively associated with the binding of SUZ12, which may explain why Polycomb protein complexes cannot inactivate pluripotency-related genes in ES cells.3.5 CisFinder algorithm can find motifs with a low level of enrichmentWe tested whether the CisFinder algorithm was robust enough to identify motifs that were only slightly enriched in the set of DNA sequences. According to Loh et al.,10 ChIP loci with at least 4 ditags (ChIP-PET data) were reliable enough to infer binding of POU5F1 and NANOG. Thus, we used ChIP loci with 2 or 3 ditags for POU5F1 as examples of data with a low level of motif enrichment. To evaluate the over-representation of binding motifs, we searched for the OCT–SOX motif in 200 bp test DNA segments centered at ChIP loci and in control sequences (i.e. two 500 bp sequence segments starting from nucleotide positions 400 bp away from both ends of 200 bp test sequence segments). To avoid a circular reference, we took the PFM for the OCT–SOX motif from an independent source, where the PFM was estimated on the basis of ChIP-PET loci with at least 4 ditags for POU5F1.10 The over-representation ratios of the OCT–SOX motif density were only 1.57 and 0.99 in ChIP-PET data sets with 3 and 2 ditags, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S3). They were substantially lower than the over-representation ratio (7.10) of the OCT–SOX motif in the ChIP-seq data, which confirms the low level of motif enrichment. The CisFinder algorithm was successful in finding the OCT–SOX composite motif ATTGTTATGCAAAT as the top-scored consensus sequence for the set of 3361 ChIP loci with 3 ditags. Similarly, in the set of 19 803 genome loci with 2 ditags for POU5F1, CisFinder identified a canonical POU-motif ATGCAAAT.50 However, this motif was not the top-scored one (rank = 11), which may be the result of a large proportion of false positives in the data set. The OCT–SOX composite motif was not found, which can be explained by no enrichment of this motif (over-representation ratio = 0.99) (Supplementary Fig. S3). Thus, we hypothesized that the weak binding of POU5F1 does not require SOX2 as a co-factor. Top-scored motifs over-represented in ChIP loci with 2 ditags were also meaningful: they corresponded to NRF1 and KLF motifs, which were associated with POU5F1 binding as shown above (Fig. 3) and reported in the literature.51 In comparison, neither MEME15 nor Weeder36 found any meaningful motifs in both data sets with 3 or 2 ditags of POU5F1.3.6 Other potential applications and limitations of CisFinderAlthough CisFinder was designed specifically for the analysis of ChIP experiments on TF binding, it can be used for other purposes. For example, it can be used to find over-represented motifs in promoters of co-regulated genes, in introns of alternatively spliced genes, or in 3′-untranslated regions of genes with high or low rates of mRNA degradation.

 search for over-represented motifs can be improved by limiting the search to evolutionarily conserved regulatory regions because functional sequences have a tendency to be conserved during evolution.52 [However, recent findings indicate that many regulatory regions are located in transposable elements, which are usually not conserved.32]Because of its high processing speed, CisFinder can be used interactively by adjusting parameters of motif detection. Also, it can be utilized effectively as a component of systems for reconstructing gene regulatory networks. For example, Reiss et al.53 used de novo motif discovery in promoters of co-regulated genes, which were clustered using the data on gene expression in various conditions. Because the identification of motifs is repeated many times in this analysis, the use of CisFinder algorithm can increase the processing speed.The main limitation of CisFinder algorithm is that its performance decreases if the input sequence is too short. For example, if the length of sequence is 32 kb, then it contains only one 8-mer word on average (based on the random model). In this case, the CisFinder can detect only highly over-represented motifs (e.g. with >10-fold enrichment) and, thus, other software (e.g. MEME15) should be used instead.3.7 ConclusionCisFinder implements an express method for de novo identification of over-represented DNA motifs and is specifically designed to process ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq data. It is a complementary method to existing motif-finding tools, which are highly efficient in processing short input sequences. Unique features of CisFinder are: (i) it extracts all over-represented motifs in a single run and describes them with PFMs; (ii) it can effectively process large sequences (up to 50 Mb); (iii) because of its high processing speed, it can be used in an interactive manner by running the analyses multiple times after re-adjusting parameters; and (iv) it can process data with a low-level enrichment of DNA motifs.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis research was supported entirely by the Intramural Research Program of the NIH," National Institute on Aging.We thank Dawood Dudekula for help with configuration of web server and program testing.

The Me value was considered to be useful for analysis of intermediate methylation levels of CGIs.1 IntroductionDNA methylation plays a critical role during mammalian development and differentiation. Methylation of a CpG island (CGI) in a gene promoter region has been known to repress transcription of its downstream gene.1 At the same time, DNA methylation statuses of CGIs are faithfully inherited upon cell replication,2 and are considered to work as a stable switch of gene transcription.1 Once a promoter CGI is aberrantly methylated, it leads to permanent aberrant silencing of its downstream gene. Aberrant DNA methylation is deeply involved in human cancers,3 and is also likely to be involved in other human-acquired disorders.4There is a great interest in genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation, and new technologies involving microarrays and next-generation sequencers are being developed,5 replacing traditional techniques.6 In comparison with techniques using next-generation sequencers, microarray techniques are cost-effective and do not need complex bioinformatics. Their hybridization probes can be prepared by bisulphite modification of unmethylated cytosines, use of methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes, and affinity purification. The affinity purification can be performed by an antibody against 5-methylcytidine or by methylated DNA binding domains (MBDs). It has an advantage over the use of restriction enzymes, since genomic regions analysed by affinity purification are not limited to restriction sites of methylation-sensitive enzymes.Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP)-microarray analysis has been used to obtain a high-resolution whole-genome DNA methylation profile of various genomes.7–17 However, quantitative assessment of intermediate methylation levels has been hampered by the difficulty in appropriate normalization. Methylation levels have a unique distribution pattern that is essentially different from gene transcription and is likely to be bimodal.17,18 Also, global methylation levels in different samples are highly variable, and there are few reference genes that have consistent methylation levels across various samples. To overcome these issues, two methods (Batman and MEDME) were recently developed.14,16Batman (Bayesian tool for methylation analysis) transforms a signal log ratio of an individual probe to a value of methylation level taking account of the methylation levels of nearby CpG sites using standard Bayesian techniques. It is capable of processing data obtained by microarray and by next-generation sequencers. The method was validated by bisulphite sequencing of sperm samples,14 and its validity in samples with different global methylation levels remains to be established. MEDME (modelling experimental data with MeDIP enrichment) weighs signal log ratios of individual probes using a logistic model and signals obtained by neighbouring probes and by using completely methylated DNA samples.16 Both Batman and MEDME had good correlation with methylation levels obtained by bisulphite sequencing (R2 = 0.82 and 0.75, respectively). Also, both are capable of processing data from both CpG-rich and -poor regions, and this made their conversion algorithm complex as a trade-off.In this study, we developed a novel output value, the ‘Me value’, that can be calculated from raw output values, and confirmed that the value had a linear correlation with methylation levels of genomic regions using samples with various global methylation levels. The Me value was used to clarify how methylation of CGIs in various positions against transcription start sites (TSSs) is associated with gene expression, and how demethylation of CGIs is associated with re-expression of genes.2 Materials and methods2.1 Cell lines and tissue samplesAGS and KATOIII gastric cancer cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA) and the Japanese Collection of Research Bioresources (Tokyo, Japan), respectively. HSC39 and HSC57 gastric cancer cell lines were gifted by Dr K. Yanagihara, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan. Treatment with a demethylating agent, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC, Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA), was performed as in our previous study (AGS, 3 days, 1 µM).19 A normal gastric tissue sample was prepared by pooling endoscopic biopsy specimens from three healthy volunteers with informed consents. High-molecular-weight DNA was extracted by the phenol/chloroform method with RNase A treatment.2.2 MeDIP and quantification of the number of immunoprecipitated DNA moleculesFive micrograms of genomic DNA were sonicated by a VP-5s homogenizer (TAITEC, Saitama, Japan) to fragment lengths between 200 and 800 bp. The mode of fragment length was about 300 bp. After heat denaturation at 95°C for 10 min, DNA was incubated with 5 µg antibody against 5-methylcytidine (Diagnode, Liége, Belgium) in 1× IP buffer [10 mM Na-phosphate, pH 7.0, 140 mM NaCl, 0.05% (w/v) Triton X-100] at 4°C overnight. Immune complexes were collected with Dynabeads Protein A (Invitrogen Dynal AS, Oslo, Norway), washed with 1× IP buffer four times, treated with Proteinase K, and purified by phenol and chloroform extraction and isopropanol precipitation.To assess the fraction of immunoprecipitated (IP) DNA molecules among that of the total DNA (whole cell extract DNA, WCE) molecules, the number of IP and WCE molecules was quantified by real-time PCR using SYBR® Green I (BioWhittaker Molecular Applications, Rockland, ME, USA) and an iCycler Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) as described previously.20 All primers used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table S1.2.3 CGI microarray analysisMethylation microarray analysis was carried out using a human CGI oligonucleotide microarray (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) that contained 237 220 probes in or within 95 bp either side of a CGI and covered 27 800 CGIs with an average probe spacing of 100 bp. IP from 4.5 µg of sonicated DNA and 1.0 µg of WCE, without any amplification, were labelled with Cy5 and Cy3, respectively, using an Agilent Genomic DNA Labeling Kit PLUS (Agilent Technologies). Labelled DNA was hybridized to the microarray at 67°C for 40 h with constant rotation (20 rpm), and then scanned with an Agilent G2565BA microarray scanner (Agilent Technologies).From the scanned data, signal values of the IP and WCE were obtained using Feature Extraction Ver.9.1 (Agilent Technologies). These two signal values were normalized using background subtraction, and signal ratio (IP/WCE), signal log ratio [log2(IP/WCE)], P[X], and P were obtained using Agilent G4477AA ChIP Analytics 1.3 software (Agilent Technologies). The P[X] and P values, which are used in chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-on-chip analysis to obtain a binding call,21–25 were defined as the probability how the X (⁠⁠) value deviates from Gaussian distribution of X (⁠⁠) values of the entire genome of a sample. Here, the X value for a probe was obtained as the difference between the IP and the WCE signals after adjusting the symmetry of its distribution. The  value for a probe was calculated as an average X, taking account of signals for neighbouring probes (within 1 kb of the probe). In addition, to calculate signal log ratio in experiments specifically referred to, the two signal values were also normalized by the Median and the Lowess normalization methods. The microarray results were submitted to the GEO database (GSE15291).2.4 Calculation of the Me valueThe Me value of each probe (site Me value) was calculated as Me value = [signal log ratio × (1 − P⁠) − k]/l + 0.5. The P value and signal log ratio normalized using background subtraction were used for this formula. The [signal log ratio × (1 − P⁠)] value mostly ranged from 0 to 2.6 in this study, and in general, the distribution depends on the microarray platform. Accordingly, the constant l was fixed at 2.6 in this study, so that the Me value would be within a range between 0 and 1. Me values larger than 1 and those smaller than 0, which were occasionally produced after calculation, were corrected to 1 and 0, respectively. The constant k was calculated as [the signal log ratio of CGIs that had a 50% fraction of DNA molecules IP (1.7 in this study) – 0.4], which equalled to 1.3 in this study. The signal log ratio of CGIs with 50% methylation depends on the microarray platform, labelling method, and mixture rate of IP and WCE, but does not need to be changed once established to suit a protocol.The Me value was calculated only for probes with high reliability. To select such probes, first, probes that yielded extremely high signal intensities (5-fold higher than average) for the WCE (Cy-3) were excluded. Since the signals obtained for the WCE should be the same theoretically for all the probes, extremely high signals were considered to be due to cross-hybridization. Then, continuity of signal log ratios of neighbouring probes was enforced. If the value of a probe was higher than those of neighbouring probes on both sides, it was corrected to their average because the value was likely to be an error. In addition, efficiency in labelling and hybridization in each microarray analysis was monitored by the signal log ratio and the fraction of DNA molecules IP by MeDIP at 10 probe loci. The data processing for the Me value was performed by Excel 2007 (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA), and the templates are available upon request.2.5 Definitions of genomic regionsThe position of each probe against a TSS was determined using UCSC hg18 (NCBI Build 36.1, March 2006). A single CGI was defined as an assembly of probes in the CGI microarray with intervals <500 bp. CGIs were classified into four categories: upstream CGIs (within 10 kb upstream of the TSS), divergent CGIs (within 10 kb upstream of the TSSs of two genes that are transcribed in opposite directions), gene body CGIs, and downstream CGIs (within 10 kb downstream of genes). A CGI spanning both an upstream region and a gene body was split into an upstream CGI and a gene body CGI. A putative promoter region (promoter) was defined as a region between a TSS, determined by UCSC hg18 (NCBI Build 36.1, March 2006) and its 200 bp upstream. According to these definitions, 34 697 assemblies of probes were defined as CGIs, and 9624 assemblies were defined as promoters. Genes with multiple promoters were analysed as different genes because of their multiple TSSs. CGIs that could not be classified by these criteria (4164 CGIs) were omitted from the following analysis. An average number of probes that covered a single CGI (or a single promoter) was 6.8 (2.0), and the distribution of the numbers is shown in Supplementary Fig. S1.2.6 Expression microarray analysisMicroarray analysis of gene expression was performed using GeneChip (Affymetrix) as described previously,19,26 and the signal intensities were normalized, so that the average intensity of all the genes on a microarray would be 500. The average signal intensity of all the probes for a gene was used as its expression level. Genes with signal intensities of 1000 or more and of 250 or less were defined as those with high and low expression, respectively.2.7 Bisulphite treatment, methylation-specific PCR, and bisulphite sequencingBisulphite modification was performed using BamHI-digested genomic DNA as descried previously.26 Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) was performed using bisulphite-treated DNA as descried previously.26 Bisulphite sequencing was performed after cloning the PCR product (10 clones or more for each sample). We used the data of methylation status previously analysed.19,26–302.8 Determination of methylation levels of a genomic region and CGI (or promoter) using the microarray dataA methylation level of a genomic region analysed by quantitative PCR of IP DNA molecules was assessed by an output value of a probe within the PCR product and closest to the forward primer, or a probe closest to the PCR product when no probes were present within the PCR product. A methylation level of a region analysed by bisulphite sequencing (200 bp) was assessed by an output value of a probe in the centre of the region. This was possible because bisulphite sequencing was performed for a region larger than 100 bp upstream and downstream of a probe, and methylation statuses of CpG sites within the 200 bp region were scored. A methylation level of a CGI (or promoter) was assessed by an average of site Me values of the probes located within the CGI (or promoter), which was defined as the CGI (or promoter) Me value.3 Results and discussion3.1 Assessment of current output values for methylation levelsWe first examined whether or not distribution of the available output values reflected the global methylation levels. The output values analysed were: (i) the signal log ratio, which is most frequently used in microarray analysis, (ii) the P[X] value, and (iii) P value, which is often used in ChIP-on-chip analysis. Their distribution was analysed in two samples, a cell line (AGS) with frequent CGI methylation26 and the same cell line after treatment with 5-aza-dC. Our previous study showed that AGS after 5-aza-dC treatment has demethylation of at least 421 promoter CGIs,19 and its global methylation level was expected to shift towards unmethylated ranges. Among the three values, the signal log ratio showed such a shift (Fig. 1A). On the other hand, the P[X] and P values did not show such a shift (Fig. 1B and C).Distribution of methylation levels assessed by the available output values and the Me value in a gastric cancer cell line, AGS, and the same cell line after 5-aza-dC treatment. The analysis was performed for the signal log ratio with background subtraction normalization (A), the P[X] value (B), the P value (C), and the Me value (D). Lines between the two bar graphs indicate values of individual probes (randomly selected representative 20 values). Distributions of the signal log ratio and the Me value reflected the global methylation level, as shown by their shift towards smaller values in cells with 5-aza-dC treatment. In contrast, those of the P[X] and P values did not show the shift.Distribution of methylation levels assessed by the available output values and the Me value in a gastric cancer cell line, AGS, and the same cell line after 5-aza-dC treatment.

Distributions of the signal log ratio and the Me value reflected the global methylation level, as shown by their shift towards smaller values in cells with 5-aza-dC treatment. In contrast, those of the P[X] and P values did not show the shift.Next, a linear correlation with methylation level, represented here by the fraction of DNA molecules IP by the anti-5-methylcytidine antibody, was examined for individual output values using 31 genomic regions located within various CGIs. In addition to the three output values, (iv) the signal ratio (background subtraction normalization), (v) the signal log ratio with Median normalization, and (vi) the signal log ratio with the Lowess normalization were analysed. Although P gave a correlation coefficient of −0.91 (r, Pearson's), the absolute values of correlation coefficients using other output values were smaller than 0.72 (Supplementary Fig. S2). Median and Lowess normalization did not improve the linear correlation.3.2 Development of a novel output value ‘Me value’To improve the linearity of the signal log ratio, which reflected the global methylation levels, P⁠, which had a strong linear correlation, was used as a coefficient to multiply it. Because P showed an inverse correlation, (1 − P⁠) was used as a coefficient to multiply the signal log ratio ‘=(1 − P⁠) × signal log ratio’. This value showed a higher correlation coefficient (0.93) than the other output values (Supplementary Fig. S2). This value was scaled to a value with a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 1 using the constants in Section 2, and the scaled output value was designated as the ‘Me value’. The Me value had the largest correlation coefficient (0.94) among all of the output values analysed. The distribution of the Me value reflected the global methylation levels by showing a shift towards smaller values after demethylation (Fig. 1D).The Me value was generated taking advantage of the signal log ratio and P⁠. The signal log ratio was not quantitative but reflected the global methylation levels. On the other hand, P had a high linear correlation with the fraction of DNA molecules IP by the anti-5-methylcytidine antibody. The P value is obtained as a probability value that takes account of neighbouring probes, and reflects the methylation level of a small local region. Since the vast majority of CpG sites within a CGI are (un)methylated when the CGI is (un)methylated,31 the P value was considered to have an advantage in faithful reflection of the local methylation status.3.3 High accuracy of MeDIP-CGI microarray with Me valueIn addition to the linear correlation between the Me value and the fraction of DNA molecules IP, a linear correlation between the Me value and the fraction of methylated CpG sites was analysed. Fractions of methylated CpG sites of 11 genomic regions (each 200 bp) with a variety of methylation levels were obtained by bisulphite sequencing in four different cell lines with different global methylation levels26 (44 values in total). The Me value was obtained for a probe (site Me value) in the centre of the genomic region analysed. A strong correlation (r = 0.88, Fig. 2) was observed. The correlation was stronger than any of those obtained by the other output values. When the analysis was limited to genomic regions with intermediate Me values, the correlation coefficients were 0.75 (Me value: 0.1–0.9); 0.53 (0.2–0.8); 0.47 (0.3–0.7); and 0.19 (0.4–0.6). These data further supported that a site Me value reflects a methylation level of a small genomic region (200 bp), even if it is within an intermediate range, and that the Me value is useful for the analysis of various biological samples, such as tissue samples.Correlation between an output value and the fraction of methylated CpG sites by bisulphite sequencing. Forty samples with variable methylation levels (11 loci in four cell lines) were analysed by bisulphite sequencing, and the fraction of methylated CpG sites among all the CpG sites within 200 bp of the microarray probes was obtained. The numbers of CpG sites in this region ranged from 7 to 21. The Me value had a linear correlation with the fraction (r = 0.88, Pearson's correlation coefficient).Correlation between an output value and the fraction of methylated CpG sites by bisulphite sequencing. Forty samples with variable methylation levels (11 loci in four cell lines) were analysed by bisulphite sequencing, and the fraction of methylated CpG sites among all the CpG sites within 200 bp of the microarray probes was obtained. The numbers of CpG sites in this region ranged from 7 to 21. The Me value had a linear correlation with the fraction (r = 0.88, Pearson's correlation coefficient).Cancer tissues sometimes show mixtures of methylated and unmethylated CpG sites on the same DNA molecule (mosaic pattern). Even in this case, multiple CpG sites are usually located within the average size of shearing DNA (300 bp) because there are 9–53 CpG sites in 300 bp regions of promoter CGIs.20 If two or more CpG sites are methylated, such DNA molecules are reported to be efficiently IP.9 Therefore, it is expected that, for most CGIs, the Me value will work even in samples with mosaic pattern methylation, such as cancer tissues.Next, detection of completely methylated and unmethylated statuses of CGIs was attempted. Using output values other than the Me value, this has been achieved by optimizing cut-off values depending upon samples because their global methylation levels were highly variable. Since the Me value well reflected the global methylation levels, we tried to use cut-off CGI Me values common to different samples. Methylation statuses of 113 CGIs in four cell lines with different global methylation levels26 (452 values in total) were scored using various cut-off CGI Me values. A high specificity with little compromise of sensitivity was achieved with the cut-off values of 0.6 and 0.4 for highly methylated and unmethylated CGIs, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S3). Accuracies for methylated and unmethylated CGIs with these cut-off values were 71.8 and 83.8%, respectively (Table 1). Since these cut-off CGI Me values worked in the four samples with different global methylation levels, Me values of 0.6 and 0.4 were considered to be suitable to identify highly methylated and unmethylated CGIs, respectively, with reasonable accuracies.Comparison between methylation statuses determined using the CGI Me value and those by MSPUsing 113 CGIs, we compared methylation statuses determined using the Me value and those by MSP.Methylated/unmethylated, both methylated and unmethylated DNA molecules were detected by MSP.Comparison between methylation statuses determined using the CGI Me value and those by MSPUsing 113 CGIs, we compared methylation statuses determined using the Me value and those by MSP.Methylated/unmethylated, both methylated and unmethylated DNA molecules were detected by MSP.These data showed that, for quantification of methylation levels, the Me value had linearity similar to Batman and MEDME.14,16 Although samples analysed were different, the coefficient of determination (R2, Pearson's) obtained by the Me value was 0.77, being in the same range as Batman (0.82) and MEDME (0.75). The linearity of the Me value was validated also using four samples with different global methylation levels, which has not been done with Batman (one sample) and MEDME (two samples). Further, the CGI Me value enabled us to score completely methylated and unmethylated statuses of CGIs in samples with variable global methylation levels using common cut-off values. It is also of note that the Me value can be conveniently calculated using a spreadsheet and a commercially available software, such as Excel (Microsoft).3.4 Application of the Me value to analysis of the association between CGI methylation and gene expressionUsing the Me value, methylation profiles of CGIs and promoters were analysed in four gastric cancer cell lines, AGS cells after 5-aza-dC treatment, and one normal gastric tissue sample (a pool of four samples from four individuals). CGIs (promoters) with CGI (promoter) Me values more than 0.6 were classified as ‘methylated’. Of the 30 533 CGIs analysed, 3768–7310 CGIs were methylated in the cancer cell lines, and 3393 CGIs were methylated in the normal sample (Table 2). However, methylation was infrequent in promoters (Table 2, Supplementary Fig. S4A and B). The ratio of methylated promoters in cancer cell lines (6.7–12.5%) was in accordance with that in a previous report (10.9% in lung cancer cell lines).32 The difference between overall CGIs and promoters was clearer in the normal gastric tissue than in the human gastric cancer cell lines. Interestingly, CGIs in the vicinity of the LINE and SINE repetitive elements had lower Me values than those further away from them in cancer cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S4C and D). A small peak was observed at 300 bp from SINE, and CGIs closer to SINE and LINE were less methylated than those further apart from SINE and LINE. There is a possibility that a boundary function of these repetitive elements prevents methylation beyond the boundary spread across into CGIs. Actually, SINE is reported to have binding sites for the TFIIIC transcription factor, and to protect promoter CGIs from repressive chromatin modifications.33DNA methylation profiles of CGIs according to their positions against TSSs obtained by MeDIP-CGI microarrayDefinitions of the CGI positions are described in Section 2.DNA methylation profiles of CGIs according to their positions against TSSs obtained by MeDIP-CGI microarrayDefinitions of the CGI positions are described in Section 2.The numbers of methylated CGIs were larger in AGS and KATOIII than in HSC39 and HSC57, which was in accordance with our previous findings.26 The difference among the four cell lines was observed not only at the overall genome level but also on individual chromosomes (Supplementary Fig. S5). In contrast, the numbers of methylated promoters had the same difference at the overall genome level, but some distortions were present on specific chromosomes. For example, HSC39 had the largest numbers of methylated promoters on chromosomes 15, 18, and 22, and HSC57 had the largest number on chromosome 21. This result suggested that promoters have unique mechanisms to be methylated in cancer cells, such as functional selection of a cell with methylation of specific promoters.Gene expression profiles were also obtained by expression microarray analysis of the same four cancer cell lines and the normal gastric tissue sample. When genes were classified by their expression levels, genes with high expression had lower methylation levels in their promoters than those with low expression in all cell lines (Fig. 3A). When genes were classified by methylation levels (unmethylated, moderately methylated, and highly methylated), genes with high methylation in their promoters had lower expression than those with low methylation (left panel in Fig. 3B). In contrast, genes with high methylation in their gene bodies (5 kb or more downstream of TSSs) had slightly, but significantly, higher expression levels (right panel). These results clearly showed that methylation of gene body CGIs was associated with increased gene expression, as in previous reports.34–37 Finally, genes with low expression in normal gastric tissue had higher methylation levels of promoters in cancer cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S6). This result was in line with the fact that genes with low expression are susceptible to DNA methylation.20,38,39Association between DNA methylation level and gene expression. (A) Average methylation levels (site Me values) of genes with high and low expression. Genes with low expression (dashed line) showed significantly higher methylation levels than those with high expression (solid line) in positions close to TSSs. (B) Gene expression levels according to methylation statuses of the promoters (left panel) and gene bodies (right panel). Genes were classified into unmethylated (CGI Me value <0.4, dotted line), moderately methylated (0.4 ≤ CGI Me value ≤ 0.6, dashed line), and highly methylated (CGI Me value >0.6, solid line). Methylation of promoters was strongly associated with low expression (P = 8 × 10−203 in AGS, t-test of expression of methylated genes and unmethylated genes), and methylation of CGIs in gene bodies was associated with higher expression (P = 6 × 10−4 in AGS).Association between DNA methylation level and gene expression.

The relationship between the degree of demethylation of promoters and that of expression induction has not been clarified, either. To address these two issues, we analysed methylation and gene expression levels in AGS before and after 5-aza-dC treatment.Demethylation of the genes with methylated CGIs or promoters (Me value > 0.6) before 5-aza-dC treatment was analysed. The average degree of demethylation was not influenced by the positions of CGIs against their TSS (Fig. 4A), whereas the degree of demethylation of individual CGIs was highly variable (representative genes in Fig. 4B). The average degree was not influenced by the distance between a CGI and repetitive elements (LINE, SINE), either (data not shown). There was no correlation (r = 0.12, Fig. 4C) between the degree of demethylation of promoters (decrease of Me value in MeDIP-CGI microarray) and that of induction of gene expression (fold increase of signal log ratio in expression microarray analysis). The majority of genes with methylation of their promoters showed little or no increase of expression after 5-aza-dC treatment. The number of methylated promoters identified by MeDIP-microarray analysis was much larger than that of genes identified as silenced by expression microarray analysis after 5-aza-dC treatment (Table 3).Degree of demethylation according to the positions against TSSs, and the lack of association between the degree of demethylation and that of re-expression.

Genes with low transcription tend to become methylated,20,38,39 and such genes are unlikely to be expressed even if the methylation is removed. Caution is necessary when the relationship between methylation of the promoter and the expression of a gene is interpreted.3.6 Application of the Me value in future studiesThe differential role of DNA methylation in promoters and gene bodies and the lack of association between the degree of demethylation of promoters and that of induction of gene expression were clearly shown due to the accuracy of the Me value. We here focused on CGIs using a CGI microarray. Roles of methylation of CpG-poor genomic regions in genome regulation are not as clear as those of CGIs,10,40 and focusing on CpG-rich regions is advantageous to isolate genes of interest. Also, the collection efficiency of methylated DNA by MeDIP or MBD is low in CpG-poor genomic regions,7,9,41 and analysis of both CpG-poor and -rich regions leads to a complicated algorithm for normalization. The selective analysis of CGIs enabled us to develop a simple, but reliable output value.The use of MeDIP allowed us to analyse methylation levels of any genomic regions regardless of the presence of restriction sites, and we were able to focus on promoters in some part of this study. We did not amplify the IP DNA during preparation of hybridization probes to avoid any amplification bias, and this was enabled by the use of a microarray platform with a high sensitivity and low signal/noise ratio. Under these optimal conditions, we achieved a high reproducibility (r = 0.98) and simplicity for the quantitative methylation microarray analysis.In conclusion, we developed a new output value for microarray analysis suitable for quantitative assessment of DNA methylation levels. The Me value will be useful in genome-wide screening using heterogeneous samples.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for the Third-term Cancer Control Strategy Program from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare," Japan.

BLSOM was applied to predict functions of vast quantities of proteins derived from mixed genomes in environmental samples.1 IntroductionA large number of protein genes whose functions cannot be predicted by the sequence homology search have progressively accumulated in the International DNA Sequence Databanks and remain of very little use to science and industry. Currently, the situation has become worse, since the number of proteins with unknown functions, such as those found in novel unculturable species derived from environmental samples, has increased rapidly. Considering that such annotation is done based on protein sequence alignment, other methods that are complementary to the sequence alignment would be required. One approach for the prediction of function is detection of similarity in three-dimensional (3D) structure of proteins, by direct comparison of coordinates or threading approach. Another successful approach is an integration of 3D structure information with one-dimensional sequence similarity, and the programs and the structural domain databases (e.g. FUGUE, SCOP and CATH) have been published.1–5 Protein sequence alignments in twilight-zone of similarity have also been studied intensively.6–8 As described earlier, however, the number of proteins with unknown functions, such as those found in novel unculturable species derived from environmental samples, has increased rapidly, and in light of technical limitations and the cost required, it is difficult to apply routinely the higher-order structure determination of proteins for prediction of functions of the increasingly vast quantity of such novel proteins.In the present study, we have developed a sequence alignment- and structural information-free clustering method that will complement the function prediction for proteins for which no or only ambiguous prediction could be obtained even by a combination of conventional tools. Self-organizing map (SOM) is an unsupervised clustering algorithm developed by Kohonen et al.,9,10 which enables us to efficiently and easily interpret the clustering of high-dimensional data utilizing visualization on a two-dimensional plane. More than 15 years ago, Ferran et al.11 performed pioneering and extensive SOM analyses for dipeptide compositions in ∼2000 human proteins stored in the SwissProt Database. They reported clustering (self-organization) of the proteins by both function and higher-order structure with no advance knowledge during the SOM calculation. Although this unsupervised clustering method can be considered useful for predicting protein function, the study was conducted long before decoding of genome sequences, and at that time proteins of unknown function were rare. Furthermore, because a long computation time was required for the conventional SOM of the dipeptide compositions (400-dimensional vectorial data), even using high-performance computers at that time, and because the final map was dependent on both the order of the vectorial data input and the initial vectorial values, the SOM method has rarely been used for prediction of protein function.Previously, we developed a modified SOM (batch-learning SOM: BLSOM), which depends on neither the order of data input nor the initial condition, for codon frequencies in gene sequences12 and oligonucleotide frequencies in genomic sequences.13 The BLSOM recognizes species-specific characteristics of codon or oligonucleotide composition, permitting clustering (self-organization) of genes and genomic sequences according to species without the need for species information during BLSOM calculation. Various high-performance supercomputers are now available for biological studies, and the BLSOM, although not the conventional SOM, is suitable for actualizing high-performance parallel-computing14–16 and thus for a large-scale computation of a huge quantity of data using a high-performance supercomputer. In our previous studies, we used the BLSOM for phylogenetic classification of genomic sequence fragments obtained from mixed genomes of environmental microorganisms by analyzing tetranucleotide frequencies (256-dimensional vectorial data).17–20 The unsupervised method clustered the genomic fragment sequences (e.g. 10 kb) according to phylotype without phylotype information.For the present study, we developed BLSOM to predict protein function on the basis of similarity in oligopeptide composition (di-, tri- and tetrapeptide compositions in this study) of proteins. We searched the BLSOM condition to faithfully reproduce separation (self-organization) of function-known proteins according to functional categories. As a test data set for this purpose, we focused on protein genes which were classified into COGs (clusters of orthologous groups of proteins) by an NCBI group.21 The NCBI COG (abbreviated as NcCOG) is the functional category identified with best-hit relationships between the completely sequenced genomes using the sequence homology search. The NcCOG is not a simple, decisive categorization because of the co-orthologous relationship of protein genes produced by duplication of orthologous genes subsequent to a speciation event.22–24 The NcCOG, however, is undoubtedly a useful categorization of proteins according to function, especially from the view point of the method-oriented purpose of the present study because proteins belonging to a single NcCOG most likely have the same function. In the first approach, by analyzing di-, tri- and tetrapeptide compositions in the 83 962 proteins classified by the NCBI group21 into 2853 function-known NcCOGs, we could obtain BLSOM conditions that faithfully reproduced the NcCOG classifications without an advanced knowledge of the NcCOG information. Then, we applied the BLSOMs to predict functions of proteins obtained from environmental mixed genomes.2 Materials and methods2.1 Amino acid sequencesAmino acid sequences were obtained from http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/GenBank/. Proteins shorter than 200 amino acids in length were not included in the present study. To reduce the computation time as described by Ferran et al.,11 BLSOM was constructed with tripeptide frequencies of the degenerate 11 groups of residues: {V, L, I}, {T, S}, {N, Q}, {E, D}, {K, R, H}, {Y, F, W}, {M}, {P}, {C}, {A} and {G}. BLSOM was also constructed with tetrapeptide frequencies of degenerate six groups of residues: {V, L, I, M}, {T, S, P, G, A}, {E, D, N, Q}, {K, R, H}, {Y, F, W} and {C}.112.2 Blsom constructionWe previously modified the conventional Kohonen's SOM9,10 for genome informatics to make the learning process and resulting map independent of the order of data input.12,13 In the case of the conventional SOM, the initial vectorial data are set at a random value, but this results in a final map which is changed by each initial data set. In contrast, in our BLSOM for genome analyses, we could obtain a reproducible map using the first and second primary components in the principal component analysis of oligonucleotide composition for the initial vectorial data. The initial weight vectors (wij) were arranged in the two-dimensional lattice denoted by i (=0, 1, …, I − 1) and j (=0, 1, …, J − 1). σ1 and σ2 were the standard deviations of the first and second principal components, respectively, and J was defined by the nearest integer greater than (σ2/σ1) × I. Under this condition, I was set to attain the map size which provides a mean ca. 8 data points per lattice point, as described previously.12,13When this strategy was applied to dipeptide composition in proteins in a preliminary study, the first component tended to reflect the length of proteins. Although the length of a protein undoubtedly relates to its function, the length sometimes differs significantly even between proteins with the same function. Furthermore, to predict functions of proteins with high novelty, it would become important to compare the oligopeptide composition of proteins with similar functions derived from the genomes with divergent evolutionary origins, and lengths of proteins with similar functions may differ significantly from each other. Additionally, when the protein-coding regions are estimated computationally from sequences of poorly characterized genomes, including those obtained by metagenome analyses, it is often difficult to specify accurately the initiation codon position and thus the protein length. To develop a method that is less dependent on protein length, we provided a window of 200 amino acids that is moved with a 50-amino acid step. For the final, residual sequence shorter than 200 amino acids, a 200-amino acid window was newly set from the last amino acid of the protein. The BLSOM was constructed for all these overlapped 200-amino acid sequences according to the method described for the oligonucleotide composition in genomic sequnces.13 Introduction of the window with the sliding step enables us to analyze multi-functional and multidomain proteins, which originated often from the fusion of distinct proteins during evolution, collectively with smaller proteins. Only in Fig. 1A and Table 1, dipeptide frequencies in the full-length sequences of proteins were analyzed, resulting in a lower level of proper clustering according to the COG category.The distribution of pure lattice points.

Using 136 CPUs of ‘the Earth Simulator’, calculations in this study could be performed primarily within 2 days. The BLSOM program suitable for PC cluster systems and a PC program for mapping of new sequences on a large-scale BLSOM constructed with high-performance supercomputers could be obtained from our group (takaabe@nagahama-i-bio.ac.jp) and UNTROD, Inc. (k_wada@nagahama-i-bio.ac.jp). Twenty thousands protein sequences could be mapped within a day using the PC system.2.3 Assignment of NcCOGs highly associated with each otherTo examine whether the sharing of one lattice point with different NcCOG sequences reflected similarity of function, we focused on all lattice points that contained 200-amino acid fragments from more than one NcCOG (designated as ‘mixed lattice points’) and then selected the lattice points that had more than four fragments at least of two NcCOGs in order to prevents cases of mere, accidental association; it should be noted that the number of lattice points on each BLSOM was designed to have eight data per lattice point on average. Next, for each of the mixed lattice points thus selected, we listed all pairs of NcCOGs having more than four fragments and summed up the pairs for all of the mixed lattice points. Then, for each pair of NcCOGs, the number of lattice points giving the pair was counted, and the pair found only once was omitted to reduce the case of an accidental association.2.4 Function prediction for protein-gene candidates obtained by metagenome analysesFor each Sargasso protein, a 200-amino acid window moved with a 10-amino acid step was provided and each 200-amino acid segment was mapped on a BLSOM constructed in advance with NcCOG sequences, by identifying the lattice-point with the minimum Euclidean distances in the multidimensional space, as published previously.14 As to every lattice point on which Sargasso fragments were mapped, the most abundant and the second abundant NcCOG segments greater than three were identified, and the mapped Sargasso segments were tentatively assumed to belong to the NcCOGs. Considering the finding that proteins belonging to different but functionally related COGs were often associated with each other on BLSOMs, the second most abundant NcCOG was included in the analysis, but the results were similar to those of the analysis in which only the most abundant NcCOG segment was chosen. Finally, when more than 60% of the number of the 200-amino acid fragments derived from one Sargasso protein gave the same NcCOG category, the Sargasso protein was assigned to that COG and designated as SomCOG, showing that the respective Sargasso protein was assigned to this COG by BLSOM. The 10-amino acid step, rather than the 50-amino acid used for the BLSOM construction, was set for this mapping process in order to reduce the position effect of the 200-amino acid segmentation. This provided five times more mapping data and reduced in part the sequence length-dependency of the prediction accuracy. Although this mapping could be conducted with PC-level computers, BLSOMs could be constructed by using high-performance supercomputers. The 10-amino acid step was not used for BLSOM construction because of the five times more computation time needed.3 Results3.1 Blsoms for proteins belonging to function-known NcCOGsFor the test data set to examine whether proteins are clustered according to function by BLSOM, we chose proteins that were classified into 2853 function-known COGs by an NCBI group21 (NcCOGs) and analyzed oligopeptide frequencies in 83 962 proteins belonging to the function-known NcCOGs. Ferran et al.11 reported, by using the conventional SOM, that the SOM for dipeptide composition after grouping of 20 amino acids into 11 categories (112 = 121 dimensional vectorial data), in which amino acids having similar physico-chemical properties were grouped as the same residue (see Materials and methods), led to a clustering that was similar to the one obtained with the 400 (=202) dimensional vectorial representation for 20 amino acids. This grouping of amino acids resulted in a substantial reduction in the computation time. To further reduce the computation time, they also attempted the amino-acid grouping into six categories (62 = 36 dimensional data; see Materials and methods) and found reduction in proper clustering into functional categories in the case of the dipeptide frequencies. Taking the pioneering findings by Ferran et al.11 into account, we investigated four different BLSOM conditions to determine which gave the best accuracy and to what degree similar results were obtained among these conditions. One was the BLSOM for the dipeptide composition of 20 amino acids (abbreviated as Di20-BLSOM). The second and the third were the BLSOMs for the dipeptide and the tripeptide composition after grouping into 11 categories, 121 (=112) or 1331 (=113) dimensional data (abbreviated as Di11- or Tri11-BLSOM, respectively). The fourth was the BLSOM for the tetrapeptide composition after grouping into six categories, 1296 (=64) dimensional data (Tetra6-BLSOM). BLSOMs for much higher dimensional data such as those for the tripeptide composition of 20 amino acids (8000-dimensional data) and for the tetrapeptide composition after grouping 11 categories (14 641-dimensional data) were impossible in this study because of the limitation of resources of the supercomputers currently available to our group.In order to introduce a method that is less dependent on the amino acid sequence length (see Materials and methods), we provided a window of 200 amino acids that is moved with a 50-amino acid step for proteins longer than 200 amino acids, and the BLSOM was constructed for the overlapped 200-amino acid sequences (a total of 472 572 sequences). Introduction of a window with the sliding step enabled us to analyze multifunctional and multidomain proteins, which originated often from the fusion of distinct proteins during evolution, collectively with smaller proteins.The most critical part of the present study is to know the level at which each lattice point on a BLSOM contains fragments derived from a single NcCOG. The number of the function-known NcCOG categories is 2835, and the map size of a BLSOM was chosen so as to provide a mean ca. 8 data points per lattice point on the BLSOM. If sequences were randomly distributed, the probability that all fragments associated within one lattice point were derived from a single NcCOG by chance should be extremely low, e.g. (1/2853)8 =2.3 × 10−28, whereas this value should depend on the number of fragments derived from proteins belonging to the respective NcCOG. We designate here the lattice point that contained fragments derived from only one NcCOG as a ‘pure lattice point’. By this definition, the lattice points that contained only one sequence fragment were not assigned to the pure lattice point, although such lattice points were minor.Considering that the occurrence probability of the pure lattice point as an accidental event is extremely low, we next compared this occurrence level among six different BLSOMs listed in Table 1. To graphically show the difference among these BLSOMs, pure lattice points were colored as red and ‘mixed lattice points’, which contained fragments derived from different NcCOGs, were colored as blue (Fig. 1). Even no NcCOG category information was given during BLSOM calculation, a high percentage of pure lattice points, i.e. clustering (self organization) of proteins according to one NcCOG category, was obtained, and pure lattice points distributed all over the maps. The highest occurrence level of pure lattice points was observed on the Tri11-BLSOM for 200-amino acid fragments (Fig. 1E); ∼45% of lattice points of the Tri11-BLSOM contained sequences derived from one NcCOG (Table 1). Shorting of the fragment size into 100 amino acids reduced significantly the occurrence level of pure lattice points (Fig. 1D). The dipeptide frequencies in the full-length sequences of proteins (Fig. 1A) gave a lower occurrence of pure lattice points than the dipeptide frequencies in the 200-amino acid window (Fig. 1B).Although the results in Fig. 1 and Table 1 show that the occurrence level of pure lattice points was many orders of magnitude higher than that of random association, it was not clear in what way the 200-amino acid segments belonging to a single NcCOG were distributed on a BLSOM. In Fig. 2, the number of sequences classified into each pure lattice-point on a BLSOM was shown by the height of the vertical bar with a color representing each of the 20 NcCOG cases. These 20 examples were chosen because they were well separated from each other on a BLSOM and thus were easily visualized on one plane. Sequences belonging to a single NcCOG were localized not in a single lattice point, but in the neighboring points, resulting in a high peak composed of neighboring high bars. A few high peaks with the same color located far apart from each other were also observed. Detailed inspection showed that these detached high peaks are mostly due to the different 200-amino acid segments (e.g. anterior and posterior portions) derived from one protein, which have distinct oligonucleotide compositions and likely represented distinct structural and/or functional domains of the respective protein. This type of distinct but major peak may be informative for prediction of functions of multidomain, multifunctional proteins.Clustering of protein sequences according to COG. (A) Di20-W200.

Numbers of sequences classified into each lattice point are presented by the height of the vertical bar with a color representing each of the 20 NcCOGs.3.2 NcCOGs highly associated with each other on BLSOMsProtein sequences contain all the following information: (i) evolutionary origin of the sequence; (ii) functional requirements (e.g. those needed to form active sites, such as functional motifs); and (iii) structural demands (e.g. the need to form a certain 3D structure or to fit into a membrane medium). Proteins belonging to a single NcCOG should have all the common information. At the same time, it should be stressed that the paralogous genes have primarily the same/similar functions. When we consider the prediction of function of the proteins derived from poorly characterized genomes such as those analyzed in metagenomic approaches, proteins that originated by diversifications of one gene during evolution and likely belong to different NcCOGs (e.g. paralogous genes) should become important because they have likely the same/similar functions. In other words, the COG category may be too strict to judge the level of clustering of proteins according to function.Proteins with the same/similar functions such as those belonging to one paralogous group might be associated with each other on BLSOMs. To examine whether the sharing of one lattice point with different COG sequences reflected similarity of protein function, we focused on mixed lattice points, which had sequences derived from different NcCOGs, and selected a set of NcCOGs whose sequences were highly associated with each on Di20-, Tri11- and Tetra6-BLSOMs, as described in Materials and methods. Table 2 lists the associated NcCOG pairs commonly found for the three BLSOMs along with the annotation of the NcCOG. When we referred to their annotations, 10 out of 11 NcCOG pairs were found to have a closely related function (e.g. ATPase, carboxylase or permease) for each pair, showing that the BLSOM can cluster proteins according to function. In the case of the exceptional one pair (COGs 0515 and 5099), a significant sequence similarity could not found. However, after fine tuning of conditions for a dot-matrix method, a weak local similarity for 10 segments was detected, whereas the segments were not linearly arranged along the primary sequence. Detailed study on proteins with such local, weak similarity will be one of our future works.COG pairs associated commonly on three BLSOMsCOG pairs associated commonly on three BLSOMs3.3 Mapping of function-known environmental proteins on BLSOMs constructed with NcCOG sequencesEnvironmental microorganisms cannot be cultured easily under laboratory conditions, and therefore, genomes of unculturable microorganisms have remained mostly uncharacterized but are thought to contain a wide range of novel protein genes of scientific and industrial usefulness. Metagenomic approaches, which determine the sequence of mixed genomes of uncultured environmental microbes, have been recently developed to identify wide varieties of novel and industrially useful genes.25,26 One important contribution of the present alignment-free clustering method is to systematically and efficiently predict functions of the increasingly vast quantity of function-unknown proteins derived from poorly characterized microbe genomes. To examine the feasibility of BLSOMs for function prediction for such environmental samples and compare the BLSOM results with those obtained by the sequence homology search, we next used, as a test data set, protein candidates that were obtained from genomic fragments derived from metagenome libraries originating in the Sargasso Sea27 and examined the similarities and differences in predictions obtained by BLAST and BLSOM. We chose the Sargasso Sea sequences because the sequences covered a wide variety of genes from a wide variety of phylotypes, and in particular we focused on the 97 838 protein candidates that have been registered as ORFs in the International DNA Databanks without function annotation and are longer than 200 amino acids. From these proteins, we initially selected those that could be robustly assigned to COGs with BLAST basing on the strict criterion described by the International DNA Bank of Japan (DDBJ).28It should be mentioned that, as the test data used in Fig. 1 and Table 1, we focused only on proteins belonging to function-known NcCOGs (2853 groups) to examine self-organization of proteins according to function. However, environmental sequences such as those of the Sargasso samples should have functions corresponding not only to the function-known NcCOGs, but also the function-unknown NcCOGs (2020 groups). Therefore, both types of NcCOGs (a total of 4873 groups) were included for this selection of Sargasso proteins robustly assignable to NcCOGs with BLAST.28 A total of 4240 Sargasso proteins were assigned to the NcCOGs, and the COGs thus assigned were called HomCOGs (COGs assigned by the homology search). Then, we divided the HomCOG Sargasso proteins into 200-amino acid segments with a sliding step of 10 amino acids, obtaining a total of 77 504 segments.As a separate analysis, we prepared the Di20-, Tri11- and Tetra6-BLSOMs with 200-amino acid segments with a sliding step of 50 amino acids, which were derived from the function-known plus-unknown NcCOGs (a total of 4873 groups: 124 292 sequences: 693 553 segments). Then, on these BLSOMs, each of the 200-amino acid segments that were derived from the HomCOG Sargasso proteins was mapped by finding the lattice point with the minimum Euclidian distance in the multidimensional space, as described in Materials and methods. For each HomCOG Sargasso protein, we summed up the mapping results of all 200-amino acid segments. If more than 60% of the mapped results gave the same NcCOG category, the Sargasso protein was assigned to this COG and this COG was designated as the SomCOG (the COG assigned with BLSOM). Because the number of COG categories used here was 4873, a probability of random chance that the multiple segments derived from one Sargasso protein were classified into the lattice points tentatively assigned to the same NcCOG should be extremely low. A Venn diagram shows high levels of overlap of the COG assignments obtained by three BLSOMs (Fig. 3A).Venn diagrams representing COG predictions obtained by three BLSOMs. (A) Sargasso HomCOG proteins.

(B) Sargasso proteins unassigned to COG with BLAST. The number in a parenthesis shows the number of Sargasso proteins assigned to COG with each BLSOM.We next compared the results of the COG assignment obtained by BLSOM (SomCOG) with those of the sequence homology search (HomCOG). Approximately 88%, 85% and 79% of the 4240 Sargasso HomCOG proteins were classified into COG categories same to those of BLAST on Tri11-, Di20- and Tetra6-BLSOMs, respectively. The highest level of congruity was found for Tri11-BLSOM. The reason why the 100% congruity and the complete overlap were not found (Fig. 3A) is thought to be related to the aforementioned finding that proteins belonging to different COGs, but having closely related functions, were associated with each other on BLSOMs. Levels of false-positives (i.e. assignment to unrelated COGs) were 6.3%, 6.4% and 7.1% on Tri11-, Di20- and Tetra6-BLSOMs, respectively, and the level was less than 0.2% for the overlapped zones of the two BLSOMs.3.4 Comparison of function predictions by BLSOM and BLASTIn the above analysis, we focused on the Sargasso proteins assigned robustly to NcCOGs by BLAST (HomCOGs) in order to search for conditions giving high prediction accuracy. The most important contribution of the present alignment-free method should be to predict functions that cannot be predicted or can only be hypothesized ambiguously by the sequence homology search. To examine this potentiality, we used, as a test data set, the residual 93 598 Sargasso proteins that have been registered as ORFs in the International DNA Databanks but could not be robustly assigned to NcCOGs with BLAST. We mapped 200-amino acid segments derived from all 93 598 Sargasso proteins on the Di20-, Tri11- and Tetra6-BLSOMs constructed with NcCOG proteins, as described earlier. The overlap levels of the COG assignments for the residual 93 598 Sargasso proteins (Fig. 3B) were lower than those found for the 4240 Sargasso HomCOG proteins (Fig. 3A). This appears to fit the view that the residual Sargasso proteins presumably contain distant relatives of NcCOG proteins (e.g. paralogous genes) and are difficult to be assigned to a single NcCOG.When the same prediction was obtained by different BLSOMs in Fig. 3B, the prediction would be meaningful, rather than accidental. This is because the three BLSOMs differed not only in the length of peptides (2, 3 and 4), but also in the categorization of amino acid residues (20, 11 and 6). A common SomCOG was assigned at least with two BLSOMs for 20 476 Sargasso proteins and was assigned with all three BLSOMs for 11 652 Sargasso proteins. To examine whether such predictions actually have biological meaning, BLAST search was conducted against NcCOG proteins, using each of the Sargasso COG proteins commonly assigned with three BLSOMs as a query. The identity and coverage levels found for the NcCOG protein with the lowest e value for each Sargasso query are plotted in Fig. 4A. Although a major portion of the data had more than 50% level of identity and more than 80% level of coverage, seven proteins had less than 30% identity, for which BLAST may not give convincing assignments. Next, we focused on Sargasso proteins assigned at least with two BLSOMs and conducted the above BLAST search. Data points with low identity and coverage levels increased significantly (Fig. 4B); for example, there were 66 proteins with less than 30% identity. In the final analysis, we focused on 63 752 Sargasso proteins that were assigned with any of the three BLSOMs and conducted the same BLAST search. The number of proteins with low levels of identity and coverage increased significantly, and there were 3097 proteins with less than 30% identity.Identity and coverage levels found for the NcCOG protein with the lowest e value for each of Sarga",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One important contribution of BLSOM should be to provide an independent, separate prediction judgment, permitting us to get integrative assessment. For example, in the cases of Sargasso proteins with less than 60% levels of identity and coverage in the BLAST search, multiple COGs often became the candidates, and it was usually difficult to tell which of the candidates was the proper answer. When the BLSOM prediction fit to one of the candidates obtained by BLAST, this will become more reliable because the two methods are based on clearly distinct principles; sequence alignment-free and -dependent methods. In the cases of proteins with less than a 30% identity level (Fig. 4), convincing prediction will not be obtained with BLAST. For such twilight zone of alignments, various useful strategies have been developed to get reliable alignments.1–8 BLSOM is a sequence alignment- and structural information-free method, and therefore, BLSOM prediction will become the novel, irreplaceable information.The proof of functions, especially for novel proteins, can only be obtained by experimental approaches, and the purpose of any informatics prediction for such novel proteins is to provide the supporting-evidence/guideline for experimental studies. BLSOM will become a novel, irreplaceable strategy for function prediction of proteins for which only ambiguous or no prediction was obtained with sequence homology searches.4 DiscussionOligopeptides are component parts of a protein and involved in formation of both functional motifs and 3D structures. The BLSOM analyzing oligopeptide composition, therefore, appears to be positioned near with the functional motif searches, such as PRINTS and PROSITE,29,30 which are powerful, indispensable methods for the function prediction of proteins. The functional motif search, however, does not adequately incorporate information pertaining to 3D structure formation. In the case of BLSOM, not only the oligopeptides for functional motifs, but also those contributing to 3D structure formation were included for predicting functions. Furthermore, because the functional motifs are obtained mostly from experimentally well-characterized proteins, the method might become less useful in the function prediction for the less-characterized proteins originating from poorly characterized genomes. The present unsupervised clustering algorism has the advantage that no advance knowledge about the target protein is required, and therefore, is thought to be appropriate for analyses of diverse novel proteins.Sequence similarity and functional motif searches undoubtedly are essential, indispensable tools for predicting protein functions, but even after combining these powerful methods, a large number of function-unknown proteins remains. In order to complement these conventional methods and provide the additional new information helpful for integrative assessments, we developed the BLSOM method. The most important contribution of the present unsupervised, alignment-free method should be to predict functions of increasingly vast quantity of function-unknown proteins derived from less characterized genomes, such as those studied in the metagenomic approaches. For identifying functions of novel function-unknown proteins, a large-scale BLSOM that has analyzed all function-known proteins in databases must be constructed to extract their characteristics in advance. Various high-performance supercomputers are now available for biological studies, and the BLSOM developed here is suitable for actualizing high-performance parallel-computing with high-performance supercomputers such as the Earth Simulator ‘ES’.14–16 The present unsupervised, self-classifying strategy to find association of function-unknown proteins to function-known proteins on a large-scale BLSOM constructed with high-performance supercomputers should serve as a new and powerful tool in the post-genome era. In this study, we did not compare the performance of our approach with those of the structure-based methods, which would be one of our future works.It is noteworthy that once the large-scale BLSOM is constructed using a high performance supercomputer and publicized, researchers can predict the function of individual proteins (e.g. those obtained from a newly sequenced genome) by mapping their proteins of interest on the large-scale BLSOM. This mapping is possible using a PC-level computer. The programs for the mapping, as well as the large-scale BLSOMs constructed by supercomputers, were available from our group (takaabe@nagahama-i-bio.ac.jp). This approach should add a new and powerful tool to the genomics and proteomics fields for the systematical and efficient prediction of functions of huge quantities of function-unknown proteins progressively accumulated in the International DNA Banks.FundingThis work was supported by Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C) and for Young Scientists (B) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports," Science and Technology of Japan.The computation was done with the Earth Simulator of Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One is an enterotoxin such as heat-labile (LT) or heat-stable (ST) enterotoxin, which causes diarrhoea. LT consists of two components (A and B subunits), and is immunologically, biochemically and genetically similar to cholera toxin.4,5 ST is a low-molecular-weight peptide consisting of 18 or 19 amino acids.6–8 The other major virulence factor is a colonization factor antigen (CFA), which is responsible for adhesion of bacterial cells to the intestinal epithelial cells.1,9,10It has been reported that these classical virulence factors are carried by plasmids such as pLT (encoding LT), pST (encoding ST), pLT-ST (encoding LT and ST), pCFA (encoding CFA), pCFA-LT (encoding CFA and LT) and pCFA-ST (encoding CFA and ST).6,7,11,12 However, the full sequences of such plasmids have not been reported, with the exception of a pCFA in ETEC O6:H16.13 Among these plasmids, some families such as pLT,6 pST7,14 and pCFA13,15 have been reported to be auto-transmissible and may be evolving rapidly. Moreover, it has been reported that pLT-ST may also be self-transmissible in some serotypes of ETEC such as O78:H12, but non-self-transmissible in others such as in O78:H11.6 Therefore, it has not yet been determined whether pLT-ST has the genes required for transfer to other strains, or what other factors may render pLT-ST non-self-transmissible.Escherichia coli H10407 (serotype O78:H11), the best characterized of the ETEC strains, was isolated from a patient with diarrhoea in Bangladesh in 1971.1,8 It has been reported previously that the original E. coli H10407 strain carries five kinds of plasmid: pCFA/I-STIb [molecular mass (MM) 62 × 106 Da)] specifying CFA/I and STIb production, pEntH10407 (MM 42 × 106 Da) specifying LT and STIa production, pTRANS (MM 42 × 106 Da) specifying self-transmission and two other plasmids (MM 3.7 × 106 and 3.8 × 106 Da) manifesting no detectable phenotype.1,6,7,11,12 It has further been reported that pTRANS promotes transfer of pCFA/I-STIb or pEntH10407 to other bacterial strains, suggesting that pCFA/I-STIb and pEntH10407 may be non-self-transmissible.12Although the H10407 strain has been characterized in detail, there has been no report of the full sequence of the plasmids which it carries. In order to analyse the molecular evolution of pEntH10407 and to identify the factors conferring auto-transmissibility, we determined its full nucleotide sequence.The ETEC H10407 strain maintained in our laboratory was used in these experiments. The sequenced plasmid, which will be referred to as pEntH10407K, was derived from the native plasmid pEntH10407 by an in vitro transposition system using hyperactive Tn516 (1938 bp) to provide the selectable marker of kanamycin resistance.The fully assembled sequence of pEntH10407K (GenBank accession no. AP010910), including the kanamycin cassette, consisted of 67 094 bp, 65 147 bp of which was specific to the pEntH10407 of ETEC H10407. The average G + C content of pEntH10407 is 51.2%. The sequence assembly of pEntH10407K was confirmed by comparing the restriction-enzyme-digestion patterns predicted from the sequence with those obtained by digestion of the plasmid, using several different restriction enzymes (data not shown). We also designed a set of PCR primer pairs to amplify segments overlapped with adjacent segments at both ends, covering the entire region of pEntH10407K. All pairs of primers yielded PCR products whose sizes matched the expected sizes (data not shown). These results show that no region was inserted or omitted in our sequence assembly of pEntH10407K.The map shown in Fig. 1 depicts pEntH10407K, a circular plasmid which consists of 67 094 bp containing 100 open reading frames (ORFs) (Table 1) and three regulatory RNA genes: sok, copA and finP. Putative functions could be assigned to 72 ORFs (72.0%); 24 ORFs were similar to conserved hypothetical proteins; the remaining 4 ORFs had no regions of significant similarity with proteins in the current database.Map of pH10407K. The sequence of pEntH10407K was determined by a whole-genome shotgun strategy. Sequence reads were assembled and gaps were closed by direct sequencing of PCR products amplified with oligonucleotide primers designed to anneal to each end of neighbouring contigs. The sequence was annotated using GenomeGambler (Xanagen Inc., Kanagawa, Japan). ORFs encoding products that were at least 50 amino acids in length were identified first; then possible ORFs were selected by combinations of database matches and by the presence of a ribosome binding site.

These genes encode the major virulence factors accounting for LT and STIa (STp)7,17 and Tra proteins in the plasmid. The toxin region, containing the LT and STIa genes (elt and estIa), was 13 501 bp in length. This region carries three virulence-associated genes (eltAB and estIa). eltAB is 37.6% G + C and estIa is 30.1% G + C. In addition, this region is shown to contain three IS1s (IS1A, B and C), IS600 (Table 1) and an ISEc8-like element (Table 1). IS1A, IS1B and IS600 are on the same side of the toxin region and IS1C is on the other side (Table 1). The ISEc8-like element is located between eltAB and estIa. The outer end (OE) terminal inverted repeats (IR) of IS1A, IS1B and IS600 begin 4014, 1910 and 696 bp downstream of eltB, respectively, and the OE terminal IR of IS1C ends 446 bp upstream of estIa. Although IS1A, IS1B and IS600 have complete direct repeats (DR) on both sides, IS1C has DR sequences only on one side. Moreover, in this region, there were seven transposase genes between eltA and estIa, and two transposase genes were found upstream of estIa. These observations suggest that the toxin region has evolved through multiple transposition events and may have been transferred horizontally into pEntH10407 with IS1s, as predicted previously.18,19 The organization of the toxin region in pEntH10407K is suggestive of a pathogenicity islet,20 an island of small pieces of DNA (1–10 kb).Proteins involved in plasmid replication and DNA maintenance (Table 1) are encoded by 16 ORFs (16.8% of pEntH10407K), constituting a putative replication region characteristic of IncFIIA plasmids. RepA4 (ORF065, ORF066), RepA1 (ORF068), TapA (ORF069), RepA3 (ORF070) and RepA2 (ORF071) of pEntH10407K exhibit 53.8–100.0% amino acid sequence identity with the corresponding proteins from plasmid R100.21–23 As for other IncFII replicons, a 9 bp DnaA box (TTATCCACA) and a putative origin of replication (oriR) were detected downstream of repA1 on pEntH10407K. The putative CopA antisense RNA of pEntH10407K exhibits 89.9% DNA sequence identity with the corresponding sequence of plasmid R100, which suggests that the copy number of pEntH10407 might be similar to that of R100 (NR1), i.e. one or two copies per chromosome.Plasmid segregation systems are essential for inheritance of low-copy number plasmids in daughter cells. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of three segregation systems on pEntH10407K. The first system, designated hok/sok (bp 3062–3330), is similar to the hok/sok system of plasmid R100,24,25 the second system, designated stb (bp 15 284–16 599), is similar to the stbAB (parMRC) system of R100,26,27 and the third system, designated stbDE (bp 39 434–39 969), is similar to the stbDE system of pSS, a large virulence plasmid found in Shigella sonnei.28 The hok/sok system of R100 consists of two hok and mok genes, organized in an operon, and a locus denoted sok. Orf008 and Orf009 of pEntH10407K exhibit 70.6 and 50.0% amino acid sequence identity to Hok and Mok, respectively, of R100, and the region located upstream of hok on pEntH10407K exhibits 82.0% DNA sequence identity to the region (sok) upstream of the hok of R100. With regard to the second segregation system, StbA and StbB of pEntH10407K exhibit 99.1 and 99.1% amino acid sequence identity with StbA (ParM) and StbB (ParR), respectively, of R100, and a cis-acting site (parC) (90.4% DNA sequence identity with the corresponding sequence in R100) is present upstream of stbA on pEntH10407K. These similarities suggest that the hok/sok and stbAB systems of pEntH10407K are functional. In regard to the third segregation system, StbD and StbE of pEntH10407K exhibit 98.8 and 93.7% amino acid sequence identity with StbD and StbE, respectively, of pSS. StbDE is a novel segregational stability system that was identified on plasmid R485, which originates from Morganella morganii. Experimental data have shown that the StbE protein may be toxic to its host and that StbD is likely to be an antitoxin protein.29 This region shows high similarity to the corresponding sequence of the enteropathogenic E. coli plasmid pB171. The ORFs encoding StbD (83 aa) and StbE (95 aa) are totally identical in both nucleic acid and protein sequence to orf44 and orf43 on pB171 (accession no. AB024946). Homologues of the stbDE genes were also identified on the enterohaemorrhagic E. coli plasmid pO86A1 (pO86A1_p141 and p140 in accession no. AB255435) and on the chromosomes of some pathogenic bacteria.Orf011 and Orf012 were found to be very similar to PsiA (97.1% amino acid sequence identity) and PsiB (99.3% amino acid sequence identity), respectively, on R100. They function as inhibitors of SOS induction in bacteria, including E. coli. Orf016 shows high identity (93.7%) at the amino acid sequence level with a single-strand DNA binding protein (SSB) of R100.The complete tra region responsible for conjugal transfer is composed of 40 and 37 ORFs in the R100 and F plasmids,30–32 respectively. However, only 17 genes showing similarity to the tra genes of other bacteria were found in pEntH10407K. This incomplete tra region consisted of traM, traJ, traY, traA, traL, traE, traK, traB, traP, trbD, trbG, traV, traR, traD, traI, traX and finO. It contained multiple insertions of ISEc8 and ISEc8-like elements (Fig. 2A), and comprised about 50% of the complete tra operon seen in R100.32,33 The ORFs (ORF080 and ORF087) on both sides of the multiple insertions were highly homologous to YhfA and YfhA in R100, but no similar ORF was found in the F plasmid (Fig. 2A, B). Moreover, oriT, a 463-nucleotide segment located immediately upstream of traM31,32 in R100, was highly conserved in pEntH10407, having perfect identity to the nicking-site region of R100 (Fig. 2C).Relationship of complete transfer operons of R100 and F plasmid to the incomplete operon of pEntH10407K.

Diagonally hatched arrows indicate genes of the transfer system. tra genes are in uppercase; trb genes are in lower case. ORFs are not to scale. Although transcription proceeds from right to left in R100 and F plasmids, pEntH10407K only contains the portion of the tra region from traM to traR, which are similar to the analogous ORFs in the F plasmid, and another portion from traD to traX, which is similar to the corresponding region from traD to traX of R100. Between the two tra regions, both transposase and putative transposase genes (from ORF080 to ORF087) were recognized.

The trbG of pEntH10407K, however, had unique sequence similarity to the corresponding ORF of the F plasmid but not to that of the R100 (Fig. 2B). The other Tra proteins encoded in pEntH10407K were more similar at the amino acid sequence level to R100 proteins than F plasmid ones with the exceptions of FinO (98.4% similar to F plasmid), TrbD (82.0%), TraL (99.0%), TraY (100%), TraJ (97.8%) and TraM (97.6%) (Fig. 2B). Moreover, the 5′ end of ORF080 and the 3′ end of ORF087 were identical at the amino acid level to YhfA and YfhA, which are found in R100 and not in F, suggesting that the backbone of pEntH10407 might be close to that of R100, and that the multiple insertion events into the R100-homologous region might affect the capabilities conferred by this region, such as self-transmissibility.We compared the self-transmissibility of pEntH10407K with that of R100 using a derivative of the E. coli K-12 strain. R100 was transferred at a frequency of 2.44 × 10−6 transconjugants per donor (Table 2). In contrast, self-transfer of pEntH10407K occurred at a very low frequency of 2.84 × 10−9 transconjugants per donor (Table 2). This value is as low as the transfer frequency reported in the conjugal plasmid R68 of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.34 Parallel experiments using K-12 donor bacteria carrying pUC19 or pBluescript II SK(+) showed that these plasmids are non-self-transmissible (<10−11 transconjugants per donor for each plasmid) (Table 2). These data suggest that pEntH10407 has a low self-transmissibility. Yamamoto and Yokota12 reported that pEntH10407 did not have self-transmissibility and that pTRANS induced co-transfer of pEntH10407 and pCFA/I-STIb into the H10407 strain (O78:H11 strain). Non-piliated cells do not transfer DNA, showing that the pilus is absolutely required for conjugal DNA transfer, while mutations in the traN or traG genes drastically reduce transfer efficiency by several orders of magnitude but do not completely abolish it.32,35 TraN and TraG are thought to stabilize mating pairs through an as yet unknown mechanism.32,35 The genes that code for TraN and TraG are deleted in the incomplete tra region of pEntH10407K. As it has been reported that the products of the incomplete tra region take part in the synthesis and assembly of the sex pilus,32,33 the remaining tra genes in pEntH10407 appear to form a sex pilus which is involved in the transfer of pEntH10407. The formation of an unstable mating pair due to the deficiency of TraN and TraG might be an important cause of the low transfer efficiency in pEntH10407.Transfer proficiency of pEntH10407K and the mutant plasmidsTo evaluate the transmissibility of pEntH10407K, various plasmids [pUC19, pBluescript II SK(+), R100, pEntH10407K and mutated pEntH10407K] were electropolated into a derivative (a spontaneous nalidixic acid-resistant mutant) of the E. coli K-12 strain. The transformants were used in the experiment as donor strains. Aliquots from overnight cultures of the donor and the recipient in Luria–Bertani medium were mixed in 1:1, and incubated at 37°C for 12 h. After mating, the mixtures were diluted and spread (both diluted and undiluted) on selective agar. As controls, aliquots of the donor and recipient cultures were also spread separately on selective plates. Transfer frequencies were calculated per donor bacterium.aNo tra region exists.bA complete tra region is present.Transfer proficiency of pEntH10407K and the mutant plasmidsTo evaluate the transmissibility of pEntH10407K, various plasmids [pUC19, pBluescript II SK(+), R100, pEntH10407K and mutated pEntH10407K] were electropolated into a derivative (a spontaneous nalidixic acid-resistant mutant) of the E. coli K-12 strain.

As controls, aliquots of the donor and recipient cultures were also spread separately on selective plates. Transfer frequencies were calculated per donor bacterium.aNo tra region exists.bA complete tra region is present.About 20 genes encoded within the tra operon in R100 are thought to be necessary for conjugation to occur, since mutations in these genes abrogate a plasmid transfer. Among these genes, it is known that traA gene encodes pilus subunit, pilin, which is an essential factor for plasmid self-transmissibility in F plasmid and R100. Then, we constructed a mutant plasmid (pEntH10407KΔtraA) lacking traA of pEntH10407K by a homologous recombination method and examined the self-transmissibility of the pEntH10407KΔtraA. In the mating assay, the pEntH10407KΔtraA did not exhibit self-transmissibility (<10−11 transconjutants per donor) (Table 2). The results suggest that the traA gene is required for the self-transmissibility of pEntH10407K.Moreover, McConnell et al.6 reported that an Ent plasmid (pEntO78:H12) from the O78:H12 strain in Bangladesh might contain both enterotoxin genes and be auto-transmissible, but that pEntH10407 (from the O78:H11 strain) might not be auto-transmissible. However, these ETEC strains were isolated also in Bangladesh and in the same period in the 1970s. In addition, the difference of the MM of pEntO78:H12 and pEntH10407 is similar to the MM of the region from traC to traT in R100. These suggest that the pLT-ST may originally have a complete set of tra genes matching those of the R100 or F plasmid, and that pEntH10407 might have been formed by multiple insertions into the tra genes to produce the sequence determined in this paper.The dot matrix analysis was performed to elucidate sequence similarity between pEntH10407K and R100. This analysis indicated that the pEntH10407K shared the nucleotide sequence similarities in regions involved in plasmid replication/maintenance, and plasmid transfer (tra region) (Fig. 3). The interruption of the similarity within the incomplete tra region of pEntH10407K corresponded to the swapping of tra genes with ISEc8 and ISEc8-like elements. There was no sequence similarity in the toxin region except for IS1 sequences, which clearly indicates the presence of numerous unique ORFs including eltAB and estIa in the toxin region.Dot plot analysis for pEntH10407K versus R100. Dot matrix analysis was performed using the Harrplot 2.0 software (Software Development) with a windows setting at 15 and threshold at 10. Solid diagonal line represents similarity. The toxin region (pathogenicity islet) and the incomplete tra region of pEntH10407K are indicated by horizontally and diagonally hatched box, respectively, at the top of the dot plot. The region of the ISEc8 and ISEc8-like elements in the incomplete tra region is indicated by open box. The tra region of R100 is indicated by closed box at the right side of the dot plot.Dot plot analysis for pEntH10407K versus R100.

The tra region of R100 is indicated by closed box at the right side of the dot plot.In summary, we report the complete 67 094 bp sequence of pEntH10407K, an Ent plasmid from ETEC H10407. pEntH10407K contains three distinct major regions: (i) a pathogenicity islet containing enterotoxin genes, (ii) a region involved in plasmid replication and maintenance, and (iii) a region including tra genes that cause the self-transmissibility. Our analysis of the pEntH10407 sequence emphasizes its mosaic nature and has implications for its evolution. Self-transmissibility mediated by the incomplete tra region is retained in pEntH10407, despite the deletion of many tra genes. This finding raises the possibility that the enterotoxigenic H10407 strain might have developed due to the helper plasmid assisting in the transfer of the pEntH10407. However, our finding raises another possibility that the H10407 strain might have been born by self-transfer that occurred totally through the self-transmissibility of pEntH10 407. A comprehensive comparative analysis to clarify the evolution and diversity of Ent plasmids is currently in progress in our laboratory.FundingThis work was supported by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research in the Priority Area of ‘Applied Genomics’ from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) and for the Open Research Center's Project of Fujita Health University from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan.We thank Dr H.

IntroductionThe Brassica genus comprises a number of important vegetables and condiment crops and is also a source of oil seed and fodder. Among the Brassica species, B. rapa (AA, 2n = 20), B. nigra (BB, 2n = 16), and B. oleracea (CC, 2n = 18) are diploid species, and B. juncea (AABB, 2n = 36), B. napus (AACC, 2n = 38), and B. carinata (BBCC, 2n = 34) are amphidiploids having combinations of the genomes of these diploids. Genetic maps with molecular markers are necessary to understand the origin and relationship among the genomes of the Brassica species and can be utilized in applied genetics and breeding of Brassica crops. In past decades, genetic maps of Brassica have been constructed with a range of marker types, including RAPD (Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA), AFLP (Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism), RFLP (Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism), and SSR (Simple Sequence Repeats) markers, and these maps have contributed to genetic analysis of quantitative traits. RFLP and SSR markers anchored in genetic maps have also been used for comparison of the chromosome organization among Brassica species, even between Brassica and its related model plant Arabidopsis thaliana.1–3 The numbers of currently available mapped RFLP and SSR markers in Brassica are both more than 1000 in total.3–6Brassica rapa includes a variety of vegetables such as Chinese cabbage, Pakchoi, and turnip as well as oilseed crops such as turnip rape and sarson. More than 20 genetic linkage maps have been generated in B. rapa, some of which have been applied to quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis of morphological traits,7,8 and agronomical traits including fatty acid content,9 glucosinolate accumulation,10 phytate and phosphate concentrations,11 and disease resistance.12,13 Because Brassica belongs to the same family as A. thaliana, in which the complete genome sequence has been determined and functions of many genes have been well characterized, a clear synteny map between them can offer a powerful tool to find candidate genes after QTL analysis. By synteny analysis of QTL regions of B. rapa with the A. thaliana genome, Saito et al.12 have fine mapped the clubroot resistance gene, Crr3, and Zhang et al.14 have successfully cloned a gene controlling hairiness and seed coat color traits. However, AFLP and RAPD markers are anonymous markers, which make it difficult to compare and combine linkage maps. Some RFLP probes give rise to hybridization with multiple loci because of genomic segment replication,1,15 and SSR markers are usually located in non-coding sequences, which are less conserved between the replication blocks than coding regions.5 These shortcomings may limit their application in genome analysis. Other marker types such as SCAR (Sequence Characterized Amplified Region) and CAPS (Cleaved Amplified Polymorphic Sequence) have also been produced and used to construct genetic maps,5,14 but the limited number of markers with polymorphism between different lines in a species does not meet the need of fine mapping. At present, in most detailed linkage map of B. rapa, which comprises 556 markers, only 120 markers have been detected in homologous regions of A. thaliana.5Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most common types of DNA polymorphism in genomes. In plants, SNP frequencies vary widely: 1 SNP/124 bp in coding region and 1 SNP/31 bp in the non-coding region of 36 inbred lines of maize;16 1 SNP/72 bp in expressed genes and 1 SNP/58 bp in non-coding sequences among a panel of 13 lines of sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.);17 and 1 SNP/2.1 kb to 1 SNP/1.2 kb between two cultivars of B. napus, Tapidor and Ningyou 7.18 For genotyping of SNPs, gel electrophoresis, fluorometry, DNA microarrays, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, and labeled oligonucleotide hybridization are the most commonly used techniques.19,20 Among them, for a small-scale operation in common laboratories, the dot-blot-SNP technique20,21 based on labeled oligonucleotide hybridization is considered to be a low-cost, labor-saving technique for analysis of a large number of individuals. SNPs have been extensively applied to genetic studies, including association analysis of candidate genes with phenotypic variation,22 fine mapping of QTLs,14 EST-mapping,17 linkage disequilibrium-based association mapping,23 and genetic diversity assessment.24 Whereas, in Brassica, very limited SNP markers, ∼50, have been developed,14,18 and no SNP linkage map has been published.As ESTs are highly conserved in Brassica and A. thaliana, the linkage map based on ESTs can eventually provide a direct genomic comparison of macro- and micro-collinearity across these species. In the present study, we mainly used EST-based SNP markers to construct a B. rapa linkage map, which was then compared with A. thaliana linkage map based on homologous loci and revealed a fine synteny relationship. Flowering time and leaf morphological traits are important characteristics as vegetables, and therefore ones of breeding objectives. It has been indicated that multiple loci are involved in the variation of these traits,7,8,25,26 but limited gene information has been obtained. We analyzed QTLs for these traits and inferred some candidate genes from the corresponding syntenic regions of A. thaliana.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materials and growth conditionsBrassica rapa cv. ‘Yellow Sarson’ C634, an early-flowering Indian oilseed rape, has been maintained by self-pollination for more than five generations. A doubled haploid line P11 of B. rapa cv. ‘Osome’, a Japanese commercial variety of late flowering leafy vegetable, was provided by Dr Kuginuki of Asahi Noen Seed Co. Ltd. The two lines were crossed to produce an F2 population. As temperature is an important factor for flowering, the F2 population was divided into two subpopulations of 132 and 134 individuals, which were cultivated using 24-cm-diameter pots in an unheated greenhouse and a heated greenhouse, respectively, in Sendai, Japan (38°16′N, 140°52′E), from October 2007 to April 2008. The average highest and lowest temperature of each month in Sendai is listed in Supplementary Table S1. The room temperature of the heated greenhouse was maintained above 10°C. Genomic DNA was prepared from leaves by a modified CTAB (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide) method.272.2. Investigation of phenotypesThe leaf characteristics were scored 60 days after sowing using the largest leaf of each plant. Lamina width (LW) and sinus width (SW) were measured as illustrated in Fig. 1, and lobe depth ratio (LDR) was calculated as (LW − SW)/LW. Leaf hairiness (LH) was scored with 0–5 scale: 0, hairless; 1, some hairs along the leaf edge; 2, some hairs on the margin of abaxial surface of leaf; 3, dense hairs on the margin of abaxial surface of leaf; 4, dense hairs covering ca. 1/3 of abaxial surface of leaf and some hairs on the adaxial veins; 5, dense hairs covering more than 1/3 of abaxial surface of leaf and dense hairs on the adaxial veins. Days to bolting (DBO), budding (DBU), and flowering (DFL) were recorded as the number of days from sowing to achievement of a 3-cm-high main flower stalk, emergence of buds, and opening of the first flower, respectively. Days from bolting to bud formation (DBF) was the difference between DBU and DBO.Diagram of traits of fully expanded leaves. LW and SW indicate lamina width and sinus width, respectively.Diagram of traits of fully expanded leaves. LW and SW indicate lamina width and sinus width, respectively.2.3. Primer designIn total, 533 sequences of genes or hypothetical genes in Brassica from BrassicaDB (http://brassica.bbsrc.ac.uk/BrassicaDB), 80 BAC sequences from the B. rapa Genome Project (http://www.brassica-rapa.org/BRGP/chromosomeSequence.jsp), 6 sequences of A. thaliana genes related to leaf shape from NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), and 308 EST sequences from the Raphanus sativus database (http://radish.plantbiology.msu.edu/index.php/Sequences:All) were selected to design PCR primers using the Primer3 software (http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/), expected sizes of amplified fragments being between 600 and 1500 bp.2.4. SCAR and CAPS analysesPCR was performed in a reaction mixture of 20 µl, consisting of 40 ng genomic DNA as a PCR template, 0.5 µM of primers, 1 U of Taq DNA polymerase (TaKaRa Ex Taq® or TaKaRa Taq™, Takara Biomedicals, Japan), 1×Ex Taq buffer or 1×PCR buffer, and 200 µM of dNTPs. The thermal cycle of PCR was set to be as follows: 1 min denaturation at 94°C, 40 cycles of 30 s denaturation at 94°C, 30 s annealing at 58°C, and 1 min 30 s extension at 72°C, and 1 min 30 s final extension at 72°C. PCR products amplified by the primers of the Brassica sequence were separated on 0.8% agarose gel for SCAR analysis. For CAPS analysis, PCR products were digested by a restriction enzyme MboI or MspI and then were separated by 6% polyacrylamide gel in 1×TBE buffer. The resulting DNA bands of SCAR and CAPS were stained with ethidium bromide.2.5. SSR analysisFrom Brassica microsatellite information exchange (http://www.brassica.info/resource/markers/ssr-exchange.php), 80 SSRs were selected to analyze polymorphism between the two parental genotypes. The PCR products were separated by 8% polyacrylamide gel in 1×TBE buffer.2.6. Nucleotide sequencing and dot-blot-SNP analysisWhen SCAR and CAPS analyses did not differentiate the two parental genotypes, the amplification products were sequenced with a DNA analyzer (CEQ2000, Beckman Coulter, http://www.beckmancoulter.com/Default.asp?bhfv=6) and aligned using SEQUENCHER version 4.7 to identify SNPs. PCR products amplified by the primers of the R. sativus EST sequence were directly sequenced to identify SNPs without SCAR and CAPS analyses, and the SNP frequency between P11 and C634 was estimated.5′-Biotin-labeled probes and bridge probes21 were designed for dot-blot-SNP analysis (Supplementary Table S2). DNA fragments containing SNPs were amplified by PCR using the primers listed in Supplementary Table S2. The PCR products were mixed with an equal volume of a denaturation solution containing 0.4 N NaOH and 10 mM EDTA and dot-blotted onto a nylon membrane by Multi-pin Blotter (ATTO, Japan). After UV crosslinking using GS Gene Linker UV Chamber (Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA), the membrane was hybridized for 3 h or overnight with the probes and washed with washing buffer (Supplementary Table S2). Digoxigenin and biotin were reacted with anti-DIG-IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Roche Diagnostics, Switzerland) and streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Promega Corp., Madison, WI, USA), respectively, and alkaline phosphatase activity was detected using CSPD (Roche Diagnostics).2.7. Linkage analysis and map constructionAll 241 DNA markers were scored in the unheated-greenhouse subpopulation. To investigate the environmental effect on QTLs, about half of the markers covering the whole genome of B. rapa were scored in the heated-greenhouse subpopulation. Linkage analysis and map construction were performed using Antmap version 1.2.28 Linkage groups were identified in the LOD (logarithm of odds) threshold range of 3.0, and the Kosambi mapping function was used to convert recombination frequencies into map distances (cM).QTL analysis was performed using a composite interval-mapping analysis with Windows QTL Cartographer v2.5.29 A permutation test was applied to each data set (1000 repetitions) to determine the LOD thresholds (P = 0.05). LOD values of 3.6 for the unheated-greenhouse subpopulation and 3.8 for the heated-greenhouse subpopulation were used as significant thresholds for the presence of a candidate QTL.2.8. Locus nomenclatureThe markers based on the genes or hypothetical genes were named <Br><Name 2-6 letter code>, and those based on ESTs of R. sativus were named <Br><EST name>. The marker assay types were designated with single letters, following the recommendations of De Vicente et al.30 as follows: m, SSR; p, CAPS; c, SCAR; s, SNP.2.9. Comparison with the A. thaliana genome sequenceThe sequences of sequence-tagged SNP, SCAR, and CAPS loci in the map were aligned with A. thaliana genome sequences using the BLASTN program of the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). We regarded the sequences as homologous loci of A. thaliana genome with a threshold value of E < 10−20, and the homologous loci of A. thaliana were located on a physical map of A. thaliana, according to the TAIR database (http://www.arabidopsis.org/). The regions having conserved collinearity with A. thaliana were regarded as homologous syntenic regions. In the A. thaliana syntenic regions corresponding to QTLs in the present study, loci defined as transcribed units (e.g. AT2G03340) in the A. thaliana genome were searched in the TAIR database (http://www.arabidopsis.org/) to find the related candidate genes.2.10. Sequence and expression analysis of candidate genesYoung leaves were collected from 30-day-old plants in the greenhouse at 20°C for RNA extraction. Total RNA was extracted from 30 mg of leaf using the SV Total RNA Isolation System (Promega Corp.). First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 µg of total RNA by reverse-transcription using a GE Healthcare first-strand cDNA Synthesis kit (GE Healthcare UK Limited, Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, UK). RT–PCR was performed by specific primers of BrFLCs, listed in Supplementary Table S3, by 30 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 58°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 1 min. Real-time PCR was performed to semi-quantify mRNAs of BrTTG1 and BrGA20OX3 using a LightCycler (Roche Diagnostics) with SYBR Premix Ex Taq (Takara Biomedicals) according to Fujimoto et al.31 Specific primers of BrTTG1 and BrGA20OX3 are listed in Supplementary Table S3.Nucleotide sequences of three BAC clones, KBrH080A08 (accession number in NCBI: AC155344), KBrH004D11 (accession number in NCBI: AC155341), and KBrB004B12 (accession number in NCBI: AC189195), which carry BrFLC1, BrFLC2, and BrGA20OX3, respectively, and that of the gene BnTTG1 (accession number in NCBI: EF175930) were used to design primer sequences for nucleotide sequencing.3. Results and discussion3.1. Production of DNA markers and mappingOf the 533 primer pairs designed from Brassica EST and BAC sequences and A. thaliana EST sequences, single DNA fragments were amplified by 383, in which 8 showed polymorphism between the parents of F2 population, i.e. C634 and P11, by SCAR analysis and 70 showed such polymorphism by CAPS analysis (Supplementary Table S4). Of the remaining 305 primers, 160 were used for PCR amplification and the PCR products of C634 and P11 were sequenced and aligned. As a result, 95 SNP markers were produced (Supplementary Table S5). Among the 288 primer pairs from ESTs of R. sativus, 132 amplified single DNA fragments. Of these, 100 PCR amplicons covering ∼34 kb were sequenced, and 71 showed nucleotide variation with a total of 427 SNPs (12.6 SNPs/kb) between the parents, 56 of which were used as SNP markers. Surveying 80 SSR primers, 12 revealed polymorphism between the parents. In total, 241 markers, including 170 EST-based markers (120 being SNP markers), 59 BAC sequence-based markers (31 being SNP markers), and 12 SSR markers, were generated (Supplementary Table S6).A total of 241 markers were assigned to 10 linkage groups (Fig. 2), designated as A01–A10, corresponding to the linkage groups of the JWF3p reference map (http://www.brassica-rapa.org/BRGP/chromosomeSequence.jsp), based on the SSR markers and the BAC sequence-based markers. The linkage group names A01–A10 correspond to R01–R10, a previously determined classification.2,5,15,32 The linkage map had a total length of 1396 cM, and the average distance between ordered adjacent markers was 5.79 cM. The largest linkage group consisted of 38 markers and had a length of 176.7 cM, and the smallest consisted of 12 markers with a length of 73.2 cM. From the physical length of B. rapa, i.e. 717 Mb,33 the relationship between the physical and genetic distances was 1 cM = ca. 514 kb.Linkage map of B. rapa with comparative maps of A. thaliana.

The A. thaliana chromosomes are colored as the bottom right of the figure.Nucleotide sequences of ESTs for primer design in the present study were mainly derived from B. rapa, B. oleracea, and B. napus. Most of these ESTs have known or hypothetical functions (Supplementary Table S4). The nucleotides sequences of ESTs of R. sativus were also used to design primers and the sequencing results showed that PCR products of B. rapa and R. sativus had high nucleotide similarity, suggesting the feasibility of genome comparison between the two species using markers generated from the PCR products amplified by the same primers. The linkage map also contains 59 BAC sequence-based markers, which are located across all 10 linkage groups, and the order of these markers in each linkage group was almost the same as that of the JWF3p reference map (http://www.brassica-rapa.org/BRGP/chromosomeSequence.jsp).A conspicuous characteristic of the present map is that more than half of the markers, 151 markers, are SNP markers, which greatly contribute to increasing the number of sequence-based markers. The SNP frequency between the parents was estimated to be 12.6 SNPs/kb. Such high frequencies of SNPs have also been reported in other species such as maize,16 sugar beet,17 and forage grass species Lolium perenne.34 Therefore, almost all of the EST markers mapped in the present study can be applied to segregating populations of other parental lines in B. rapa, even in different species of Brassica or Raphanus, if they are used as SNP markers.3.2. Synteny between B. rapa and A. thalianaAll the markers except the SSR markers in the present map were sequence-tagged markers. BLASTN was used to test homology between the B. rapa sequence and the A. thaliana genome sequence, the results being shown in Supplementary Table S7. By a significance threshold of E < 10−20, 223 markers had homologous regions in A. thaliana, and these homologous loci covered nearly the whole genome of A. thaliana, except that only one homolog was located on the short arm of chromosome 2 (Supplementary Fig. S1). The five chromosomes of A. thaliana were divided into many segments and distributed to various regions of the B. rapa map (Fig. 2). There were 33 large syntenic regions containing at least three markers and having conserved collinearity with the homologues in A. thaliana. By comparing the syntenic regions from the same chromosome of A. thaliana, doubled and triplicated regions were identified. The region from 3.5 to 6.0 Mb in chromosome 1 was triplicated in A06, A08, and A09 of B. rapa, and that from 3.0 to 5.5 Mb in chromosome 5 was triplicated in A02, A03, and A10. The region between 12.9 and 14.9 Mb in chromosome 2 was doubled in A04 and A05, that between 2.8 and 7.5 Mb in chromosome 3 was doubled in A03 and A05, and that between 8.5 and 13.2 Mb in chromosome 4 was doubled in A01 and A08. Furthermore, these doubled regions also appeared to be partly conserved in other chromosomes of B. rapa. Segment duplications within the same chromosome were shown in A01, A02, A03, A05, A07, and A09. Insertion and rearrangement were the most apparent events and occurred in every chromosome of B. rapa.Brassica and A. thaliana are considered to have originated from a common ancestor and diverged 14.5–20.4 million years ago.35Arabidopsis thaliana has a small genome (∼146 Mb) with relatively little repetitive DNA and a high gene density,36 whereas the diploid Brassica genome is significantly larger and has a lower gene density (B. rapa, 717 Mb).33,37 Comparative genetic mapping between the diploid Brassica species and A. thaliana using RFLP probes has identified genome duplication and triplication in the Brassica genome and collinearity disrupted by multiple rearrangements.3,38,39 Suwabe et al.2 and Choi et al.5 using 74 and 120 sequence-tagged markers of B. rapa, which have corresponding homologous regions in A. thaliana, have also identified some syntenic regions and illustrated the complex nature of the chromosomal rearrangements that may have occurred before/after differentiation of A. thaliana and B. rapa. Physical mapping and microsynteny analysis by nucleotide sequencing have further corroborated these findings.37,40 The present comparative map of B. rapa and A. thaliana using 223 sequence-based markers revealed 33 large syntenic regions, which comprise the previously reported syntenic regions, and shows consistency.2,5 Calculating physical distances of the syntenic regions in A. thaliana provided genome-wide synteny and micro-synteny, enabling detailed identification of duplicated and triplicated regions in every chromosome of A. thaliana. This increased detail will contribute to further study of genome structures and identification of candidate genes in B. rapa.3.3. Analysis of QTLs and candidate genes for flowering timeThere were significant differences in flowering traits, i.e. DBO, DBU, and DFL, between P11 and C634. Budding time of P11 was almost equal to bolting time; however, bolting time of C634 was significantly earlier than budding time. Flowering traits of F1 were similar to those of P11, indicating that late flowering trait was dominant over early-flowering trait. The traits including DBO, DBU, DFL, and DBF showed continuous phenotypic distribution in the F2 population under both heated and unheated conditions (Supplementary Fig. S2).Under the two conditions, three QTLs of bolting time (DBOQTL1–3) were identified on A02, A07, and A10 (Table 1, Fig. 3). DBOQTL1 and DBOQTL2 were detected in both heated and unheated conditions, and the explained phenotypic variance was from 14.0% to 27.1%. DBOQTL3 was detected only in the heated condition with an explained phenotypic variance of 19.9%. Two QTLs (DBUQTL1/DFLQTL1 and DBUQTL2/DFLQTL2) for budding time and flowering time were detected on the same regions in A02 and A10 as DBOQTL1 and DBOQTL3 in two different conditions (Table 1, Fig. 3). One QTL for DBF (DBFQTL1) was detected in both conditions (Table 1, Fig. 3), and this QTL was co-located with DBOQTL2 on A07, but with an opposite effect, i.e. a P11 allele of this locus delayed the bolting time and accelerated bud formation so that the bolting time and the budding time were almost equal. Bolting time and budding time of B. rapa have also been analyzed previously, and some QTLs have been identified.25,26 However, these linkage groups have not been assigned to the reference linkage groups and therefore it is not possible to compare these QTLs with the three QTLs detected in the present study.The genetic locations of QTL for days to bolting (DBO), budding (DBU), flowering (DFL), days from bolting to bud formation (DBF), lobe depth ratio (LDR), and leaf hairiness (LH). Syntenic regions of A. thaliana are shown to the left of the B. rapa linkage groups as patterned vertical bars, which represent different chromosomes of A. thaliana. Candidate genes and locus names of both ends of each syntenic region corresponding to each QTL are shown on the left side of the patterned vertical bars. The lengths of the arrows indicate the 2-LOD support intervals. The traits are indicated above each column. The direction of the arrowheads indicates the allelic effect: upward, P11 increases and C634 decreases for the F2 population; downward: P11 decreases and C634 increases for the F2 population.

These two loci have also been detected in previous study on QTL of flowering time.8,41,42 In A. thaliana, FLC encodes a MADS box protein that acts as a dosage-dependent repressor of flowering.43,44 Evidence has been presented that the FLC homologues in Brassica species act similar to AtFLC and play a central role in the repression of flowering.8,41,42,45 In the present study, QTL with BrFLC2 was detected in both heated and unheated conditions, and that of BrFLC1 was sensitive to environment, which is in accord with previous findings.8,42,46Expressions of BrFLC1, BrFLC3, and BrFLC5 were all detected in the leaves of P11 and C634 (Fig. 4) when the RT–PCR was performed for 30 cycles with the primer pairs of exons 1–4. In contrast, BrFLC2 expression in P11 was strong, whereas very faint in C634. Sequence analysis of BrFLC1 in C634 and P11 revealed three nucleotide polymorphisms (Fig. 5A). One was a nonsynonymous SNP in the first exon, one was in the second intron, and the other was at the 5′ splicing site of the sixth intron. RT–PCR using a primer pair of exons 4–7 revealed two different transcripts of BrFLC1 in C634 (Supplementary Fig. S4), suggesting abnormal splicing of the C634 allele. This splicing site polymorphism has recently been reported to contribute greatly to flowering-time variation in B. rapa.47 For BrFLC2, eight SNP sites were identified between C634 and P11 (Fig. 5B). Four of these SNPs were in the first and sixth introns, one was a synonymous SNP in the third exon, and the remaining three occurred in the region −800 bp upstream of the translation start site of BrFLC2, which might cause the difference of BrFLC2 expression between C634 and P11.RT–PCR analysis of BrFLCs transcripts in B. rapa lines, P11 and C634, using primer pairs of exons 1–4.

In DBFQTL1/DBOQTL2, a Brassica ortholog of CLAVATA1 (BrCLV1)48 was located. In A. thaliana, the CLV1 gene is involved in controlling shoot apical and floral meristem size and contributes to the establishment and maintenance of floral meristem identity.49,50 Opposite effects between DBFQTL1 and DBOQTL2 indicated that at least two related genes located and were responsible for bolting and bud formation, respectively. As the region of DBFQTL1/DBOQTL2 showed a fine syntenic relationship with A. thaliana, we searched the genes in the syntenic region from 27.7 to 30.2 Mb of chromosome 1 in A. thaliana (http://www.arabidopsis.org/) and revealed 705 genes, among which, besides CLV1, a gene involved in the control of flowering time FLOWERING LOCUS M (FLM) (AT1G77080)51 was found. FLM, also called MAF1 (MADS AFFECTING FLOWERING1), encodes a floral repressor closely related to FLC.51 Repression of FLM or non-functional FLM contribute to acceleration of flowering.52 A BAC clone KBrH80C09, containing a tandem array of three MAF genes53 and mapped on the bottom of A02, has been suggested to correspond to the QTL ‘VFR1’, which has been identified by Osborn et al.42 The speculated homolog of MAF1 in A07 of B. rapa needs to be cloned and characterized.3.4. Analysis of QTLs and candidate genes for leaf morphological traitsTwo QTLs for LDR (LDRQTL1 and 2) were detected. A large percentage of phenotypic variance of 35.8% and 43.7% in the unheated-greenhouse subpopulation and the heated-greenhouse subpopulation, respectively, were explained by LDRQTL1 on A10. A minor QTL LDRQTL2, ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
inked with a Brassica ortholog of ASYMETRIC LEAVES 1 (BrAS1) on A03, was only detected in the unheated-greenhouse subpopulation. In A. thaliana, expression of the KNOTTED-like homeobox (KNOX) genes in the shoot apical meristem is required for maintenance of a functional meristem, but suppressed in cells destined for leaf primordia.54,55AS1 maintains the down-regulation of KNOX expression in leaf primordia, and the as1 mutation leads to lobed leaves.56 In Brassica, QTLs in A02 and A038 and an AFLP maker on A0857 have been indicated to be associated with leaf edge shape (LES). In the present study, we analyzed the trait of LDR calculated by (LW − SW)/LW. A similar trait, LES, scored as 1–4, has been analyzed by Lou et al.,8 and a major QTL has been detected on the bottom of A03, where is seemed to be near to the LDRQTL2 in the present study.We searched the genes in the syntenic region of LDRQTL1 from 2.1 to 3.2 Mb of chromosome 5 in A. thaliana (http://www.arabidopsis.org/) and found 348 genes, among which AtGA20OX3 (AT5G07200) encoding a gibberellin 20-oxidase was noted. It has been reported that reduction in GA signaling or biosynthesis increases the number of lobes per leaf of as1 mutation, and conversely, exogenous GA application or constitutive GA signaling suppresses ectopic expression of KNOX and both the number and depth of lobes.58 Blast analysis showed a B. rapa homologue of AtGA20OX3 (BrGA20OX3) in a B. rapa BAC clone KBrB004B12, which contains the sequence of the BrA9s marker located in LDRQTL1. Identities of nucleotide sequences and deduced amino acid sequences between BrGA20OX and AtGA20OX3 were 92% and 86%, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S3). Semi-quantitative RT–PCR analysis showed that BrGA20OX3 expression in leaves of P11 was more than six times as high as that in leaves of C634 (Fig. 6A). The lobed leaves of C634 may be caused by the low expression of BrGA20OX3. Nucleotide sequence analysis of BrGA20OX3 revealed four SNPs in the promoter region of BrGA20OX3 between P11 and C634 (Fig. 6B), which might be the cause of different expression levels of BrGA20OX3 between P11 and C634.Gene expression and SNPs of BrGA20OX3.

A minor QTL, LHQTL2, co-located with LDRQTL2, was detected only in the unheated-greenhouse subpopulation. The LH trait has been reported to be conditioned by a major QTL and a minor QTL in B. rapa.7 Association mapping of leaf trichome detected an associated AFLP marker in A05.57BrTTG1, encoding a WD40 repeat protein, TRANSPARENT TESTA GLABRA01, which has been recently cloned from A06 and verified to simultaneously control both hairiness and seed coat color,14 was located in LHQTL1. However, P11 has hairless leaves and brown seeds, whereas C634 has hairy leaves and yellow seeds.BrTTG1 expression in leaves of P11 was over twice of that in leaves of C634 (Supplementary Fig. S5), which is not in accord with phenotypic difference that P11 was hairless and C634 was hairy. Nucleotide sequences of the coding region of BrTTG1 in P11 and C634 were determined and aligned together with the sequences of hairy DH lines ‘Y177-12’ and ‘P-8’.14 There were 11 nucleotide polymorphisms between P11 and C634, which were not specific to P11 in multiple alignments (Supplementary Fig. S6). It can be inferred that BrTTG1 of P11 is not responsible for the leaf hairless trait of P11.Synteny analysis revealed that GLABRA01 (GL1) (AT3G27920), which is a well-known gene controlling A. thaliana trichome development,59,60 was located just in the syntenic region of a central site of LHQTL1. Blast analysis of GL1 showed that a homologue of GL1 with a maximum nucleotide identity of 90% was present in the B. rapa BAC clone KBrS004A14, which was located in LHQTL1. We determined nucleotide sequences of GL1 alleles of C634 and P11 and found a 5-bp deletion in exon 3 of a P11 allele (Fig. 7). This deletion is considered to be a frameshift mutation causing the loss of the function of the P11 allele.Identification of a 5-bp deletion in exon 3 of GL1 in P11. Exons 1–3 are indicated by different boxes, and nucleotide sequences around the deletion are shown on the bottom.Identification of a 5-bp deletion in exon 3 of GL1 in P11. Exons 1–3 are indicated by different boxes, and nucleotide sequences around the deletion are shown on the bottom.3.5. ConclusionAs the protein-coding regions of the genomes of Brassica species show high sequence conservation with those of A. thaliana, and the SNPs constitute the most common DNA sequence variations found in genomes of most organisms, EST-based SNP markers contribute to fine comparative mapping of Brassica species and A. thaliana. The present study shows that complex rearrangements and overlaps of the A. thaliana genome exist in the genome of B. rapa; however, genomic collinearity is conserved in many segments of B. rapa, which implies that we can use the positional information from the A. thaliana genome. After QTL mapping in B. rapa, we inferred some candidate genes from the corresponding region in A. thaliana. However, these candidate genes need further analyses, such as complementation or association studies.Supplementary dataSupplementary Material is available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported in part by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (A) (19208001) from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) and the Program for Promotion of Basic and Applied Researches for Innovations in Bio-oriented Industry (BRAIN).

In the post-genomic era, this intra-strand relationship between the complementary nucleotides is observed in double-stranded genomes of viruses, bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes, which is known as Chargaff's second parity rule or intra-strand parity (ISP).2 There is no such defined rule to describe ISP in chromosomes like the base-pairing rule in Chargaff's first parity. ISP is also observed between the complementary oligonucleotides in chromosomes,6–9 which has been attributed to genome-wide large-scale inversion, inversion transposition10 and coding sequence compositional symmetry between the strands.9 Violation of ISP is observed with respect to organellar (mitochondria and plastids) genomes of some organisms, single-stranded viral genomes or any RNA genome.11–13Theoretically, under no strand bias in terms of mutation and selection, the base complementary relationship easily explains the presence of ISP in chromosomes.14,15 However, several evidences now prove that both the strands are not identical in terms of mutation/selection.16 This results into violation of ISP in sub-chromosomal regions. Longer the sub-chromosomal region, smaller is the violation of ISP observed.17 The mechanisms that are responsible to cause violation are defined under three categories.18 First, DNA replication: leading strand (LeS) is found to be composed of more K nucleotides (G and T) than the complementary M (A and C) nucleotides and the reverse holds true for the lagging strand (LaS).19 This is due to the fact that the LeS which functions as the template for Okazaki fragment synthesis (functions as template for LaS) remains exposed more as single-stranded than the LaS (functions as template for LeS) during replication that results into higher deamination of the cytosine residues20,21 in LeS (cytosine gets deaminated 140 times faster in ssDNA than in dsDNA22). In addition, the influence of Okazaki fragments and the sliding DNA clamp proteins associated with the synthesis of LaS create functional asymmetry of the mismatch repairing system on DNA.23 Second, transcription: genes are preferentially located in the LeS than in the LaS to avoid head on collision between the machineries of replication and transcription.24 During transcription, the non-template strand remains more exposed as single-stranded than the template strand, which causes asymmetry in cytosine deamination between the strands.22 The transcription-coupled repair system also acts only upon the template strand and thereby contributes to the strand asymmetry.25 Third, translation: uses of synonymous codons are influenced by differential abundance of tRNA molecules which results into the differential abundance of complementary nucleotides at the third position of family box codons. This causes parity violation.14 In spite of these factors favoring violations of the parity in chromosomes, ISP is observed in an entire chromosome due to the cancellation effect of the local violations in opposite directions.14Evolutionary biologists are more interested to understand the role of mutation and/or selection in the violation of ISP by analyzing the weakly selected or selectively neutral regions (third position of family box codons and non-coding regions) in chromosomes.14,26 Whether any specific feature(s) is/are associated with chromosomes exhibiting ISP is yet to be understood. Shioiri and Takahata27 studied ISP by finding out the total AT skew (ATS) and GC skew (GCS) in the chromosomes of several bacteria. In their study, out of 36 bacterial chromosomes, Xylella fastidiosa exhibited maximum ATS and GCS. They observed variable ATS/GCS among chromosomes of different strains of a species as well as chromosomes within a bacterial cell. They also observed ATS and GCS may be different from each other within a chromosome. Since, they did not do any statistical analysis of the skew, the significance of the variability observed among chromosomes was not discussed by them. The usual statistical tool used to find out ISP in chromosomes is a correlation analysis of oligonucleotides abundance described by Prabhu.6 The ISP study between the complimentary mononucleotides is important because it has been proven that oligonucleotide parity and mononucleotide parity are independent.8 Baisnée et al.8 studied parity in chromosomes by measuring the S1 index which is defined as the sum of the absolute values of the differences between complementary oligonucleotides (n mer) frequencies (n varies from 1 to 9 mer). Both these methods do not measure the statistical significance of differences between the abundance values of a mono/oligonucleotide and its reverse complement. For example, if a chromosome carries significant similarity between the abundance values of A and T but carries significant difference between the abundance values of G and C, this will not be identified separately. Similarly, the above methods are unable to find out parity violations in chromosomes with respect to the abundance values of an oligonucleotide and its reverse complement. We have developed a methodology here that can independently study ISP between S nucleotides (any oligonucleotide and its reverse complement) as well as between W nucleotides using the abundance values of mononucleotides. We use the well-known Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) test to study the frequency distribution of the compositional abundance values of the mononucleotides in a chromosome sequence, which gives the statistical significance of the similarity between the distributions of complementary nucleotides. This we called as intra-strand frequency distribution parity (ISFDP), which has been used here to study the chromosomes of bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes.Materials and methodsFrequency distribution calculationChromosome sequences of different bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes (Tables 1–3) were obtained from the genome information broker, DDBJ site (www.gib.genes.nig.ac.jp). Bacterial chromosomes were chosen randomly from the database starting the genus name from A to Z. Chromosome sequences of different strains belonging to the same species in the case of bacteria were taken in several cases to do the intra-species comparison. Each chromosome sequence was divided into smaller-size sequences of 1000 nucleotides each starting from the beginning, and the abundance value of the four nucleotides was determined using the computer program (developed for this study). The distribution of the abundance values of complementary nucleotides in different fragments were analyzed by the KS non-parametric test using XLSTAT program28–30 (Kovach Computing Services, Anglesey, Wales). H0: distribution patterns of any two nucleotides/oligonucleotides in a chromosome are similar; HA: there is a difference between the two distributions. Owing to the large sample size, similarity was considered at the P-value of >0.01, weak similarity was considered at the P-value between 0.01 and 10−4, and the value of <10−4 was considered as strong violation similarity. Group-frequency distributions of the abundance values were plotted to observe the frequency-distribution parity. In the case of the di- and trinucleotides, the abundance values were determined using a different computer program (developed here for this study) in the segments for the 16 dinucleotides and 64 trinucleotides. The analysis was done as described for the mononucleotides earlier.Angular replication asymmetry of the chromosomes was calculated with the help of the information on ori (origin) and ter (termination) cited in the websites (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/GenomeAtlas/suppl/origin/ and http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/software/Oriloc/oriloc.html). The chromosomal region starting from ori to ter was considered as the leading region in the Watson strand (Ws) and the remaining portion of the chromosome as the lagging region. For a circular chromosome, the angular replication asymmetry was calculated as the amount of angular distance of leading region deviating from 180°.Proportionate distribution of forward- and reverse-encoded sequences in a DNA strandFrom the DDBJ site, only coding sequences were downloaded. A continuous stretch of the nucleotide sequence was made from all the sequences by removing the gene names. This resembled a DNA strand only composed of forward-encoded sequences. Frequency distribution analysis was done on this. In another approach, 50% of the above strand was made reverse complement by in silico followed by joining with the rest. This resembled a DNA strand composed of 50% forward-encoded and 50% reverse-encoded sequences. Frequency-distribution study was carried out as described above.Identification of leading and LaS regionATS and GCS analyses of the chromosome sequences were done as described earlier.21 This was used to find out the tentative leading and lagging portions in a DNA strand.Relative proportion of coding sequence distributionThis was found out by deducting ORF numbers between Ws (top strand) and Crick strand (Cs: bottom strand) followed by dividing that with the total number of ORFs. Gene orientation information was obtained from the website (http://cmr.jcvi.org/tigr-scripts/CMR/CmrHomePage.cgi).ResultsISFDP in chromosomes of bacteriaIn this study, a total of 112 bacterial chromosomes were considered, which includes different lineages of bacteria such as protobacteria, cyanobacteria, firmicutes, actinobacteria etc. Samples from each group were taken randomly. The bacteria included in the sample comprised a GC% variation from a minimum of 28% to a maximum of 75% and chromosome size variation from 580 kb to a maximum of 9105 kb. We have studied the frequency distributions of the abundance values of mononucleotides in the uniform sub-chromosomal length of 1000 nucleotides. A collective analysis of the nucleotide abundance values from all the segments of a chromosome was done by frequency distribution smooth curves using Microsoft Excel, and the similarity of the distributions of two complementary nucleotides was tested using the KS test (XL-Stat; http://www.xlstat.com/en/download). Figure 1A(i), B(i), C(i), D(i) and E(i) represents the smooth curves of frequency distributions of nucleotides in chromosomes Campylobacter jejuni RM1221 (30.31%), Escherichia coli K12 MG1655 (50.79%), Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc; 65.07%), X. fastidiosa 9a5c (52.68%) and X. fastidiosa Temecula (51.78%). Smooth curves of complementary nucleotides overlap with each other in the first three chromosomes, whereas those of non-complementary ones do not. In the fourth chromosome, none of the curves overlap with each other. In E. coli chromosome [Fig. 1B(i)], all the four smooth frequency curves are close to each other due to the closeness of the abundance values of the nucleotides, whereas in the graphs of C. jejuni and Xcc, the smooth frequency curves of W (A and T) and S (G and C) nucleotides are distinctly separated as GC% the chromosome are toward both extremes. The distribution was studied by the KS test and the results of the four chromosomes are shown in Fig. 1A(ii, iii), B(ii, iii), C(ii, iii), D(ii, iii) and E(ii, iii). The graphs generated by the KS test suggest the complete overlapping between the complementary nucleotides in the chromosomes except the one of X. fastidiosa strain, which is in concordant with the smooth frequency curve. The distributional similarity between the complementary nucleotides is called as ISFDP. A total of 112 bacterial, 49 archaea and 18 eukaryotic chromosomes (Tables 1–3) were analyzed by the KS test to study ISFDP. The P-values between the A and T distributions as well as between the G and C distributions are given in Tables 1–3.(A–E) Frequency distribution of nucleotides in chromosomes. Smooth curves present the group-frequency distribution of the four nucleotides a (square), t (asterisk), g (triangle) and c (rhombus). The X-axis represents the abundance values of the nucleotide spanning a range, whereas the Y-axis represents the frequency of the abundance values. In (A), the chromosome is AT rich; in (B), the chromosome is composed of similar AT and GC and in (C), the chromosome is GC rich. This is also evident from the group-frequency distribution curve. The smooth frequency curves of complementary nucleotides in these chromosomes are overlapping with each other. The KS test is shown for S and W nucleotides separately adjacent to the figures, respectively [a(ii, iii)–e(ii, iii)]. The KS test is in concordance with the curve obtained by smoothing group-frequency distribution. In (D) and (E), the group-frequency distribution for the chromosomes of two strains of X. fastidiosa is shown. In 9a5c strain chromosome, the smooth frequency curve between the complementary nucleotides does not overlap which is also suggested by the KS test. However, in Temecula 1 strain chromosome, the parity is maintained.(A–E) Frequency distribution of nucleotides in chromosomes.

Similar relation is also observed in other chromosomes.Out of 112 bacterial chromosomes, 60 chromosomes exhibited ISFDP, 16 chromosomes exhibited violation between S nucleotides as well as between W nucleotides, 30 chromosomes exhibited violation only between S nucleotides and 7 chromosomes exhibited violation only between W nucleotides (Table 4). Chromosomes of Alkaliphilus oremlandii OhILAs (36.26%), Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58 (circular; 59.38%), Mycobacterium ulcerans Agy99 (65.47%), Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228 (32.1%) and X. fastidiosa 9a5c (52.68%) exhibited strong violations between S nucleotides as well as between W nucleotides. Chromosomes of the three Bacillus anthracis (35.35%) strains, Lactobacillus reuteri F275 (38.87%), Magnetococcus sp. MC-1 (54.17%), Mycobacterium leprae TN (57.8%), Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae 3841 (61.09%) and Rickettsia bellii RML369-C (31.65%) exhibited strong violation between S nucleotides as well as weak violation between W nucleotides. Chromosomes of Coxiella burnetii Dugway 7E9-12 (42.44%) and Staphylococcus haemolyticus JCSC1435 (32.79%) exhibited weak violation between S nucleotides as well as between W nucleotides. Chromosome of Vibrio cholerae O395 (47.78%) exhibited strong violation of ISFDP only between W nucleotides. Similarly, there are six chromosomes where weak violations only between W nucleotides were observed. Chromosomes of Bacillus thuringiensis serovar konkukian 97-27 (34.41%), Bordetella parapertussis 12822 (68.1%), Bordetella pertussis Tohama 1 (67.72%), Haemophilus influenzae PittGG (38.01%), Helicobacter hepaticus ATCC 51449 (35.93%), Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM (34.72%), Lactobacillus brevis ATCC 367 (46.22%), Nitrobacter winogradskyi Nb-255 (62.05%), Ralstonia solanacearum GMI1000 chromosome (67.04%), Rhizobium etli CFN 42 (61.27%), Thermotoga maritima MSB8 (46.25%) and Thermotoga petrophila RKU-1 (46.09%) exhibited strong violation only between S nucleotides. Similarly there are 17 chromosomes exhibited weak violation only between S nucleotides. An interesting finding that came from this study is that violations of ISFDP within a chromosome with respect to S and W nucleotides may not be of similar magnitudes. This study suggests that although ISFDP is commonly observed among chromosomes, its violation is not as rare as described earlier.13 ISFDP violation found in bacteria belongs to different groups, possessing different GC% and with different genome sizes.Summary of ISFDP violations in chromosomes of Bacteria, Archaea and Eukaryotes*Violation of ISFDP includes both weak (10−2 > P ≥ 10−4) and strong (P < 10−4).aStrong violation between S nucleotides as well as between W nucleotides.bStrong violation between S nucleotides but weak violation between W nucleotides.cWeak violation between S nucleotides but strong violation between W nucleotides.dWeak violation between S nucleotides as well as between W nucleotides.eStrong violation only between S nucleotides.fWeak violation only between S nucleotides.gStrong violation only between W nucleotides.hWeak violation only between W nucleotides.Summary of ISFDP violations in chromosomes of Bacteria, Archaea and Eukaryotes*Violation of ISFDP includes both weak (10−2 > P ≥ 10−4) and strong (P < 10−4).aStrong violation between S nucleotides as well as between W nucleotides.bStrong violation between S nucleotides but weak violation between W nucleotides.cWeak violation between S nucleotides but strong violation between W nucleotides.dWeak violation between S nucleotides as well as between W nucleotides.eStrong violation only between S nucleotides.fWeak violation only between S nucleotides.gStrong violation only between W nucleotides.hWeak violation only between W nucleotides.Usually, different strains within a species are found to be similar with respect to ISFDP such as the eight E. coli strains were observed to exhibit ISFDP between S nucleotides as well as between W nucleotides, the three B. anthracis strains are found to be similar in terms of their ISFDP violation (strong violation of ISFDP between S nucleotides as well as weak violations of ISFDP between W nucleotides). However, variation among the strains of a bacterial species with respect to ISFDP was observed as follows: out of the two strains of C. burnetii, Dugway 7E9-12 strain violated ISFDP, whereas RSA 493 strain exhibited ISFDP. Out of the four H. influenza strains, 86-028NP and PittEE exhibited violation of ISFDP, whereas PittGG and Rd KW20 exhibited strong and weak violations only between S nucleotides, respectively. Xylella fastidiosa 9a5c exhibited strong violation of ISFDP, whereas X. fastidiosa Temecula 1 exhibited weak violation of ISFDP only between S nucleotides. These are called as intra-species ISFDP violations. Chromosomes of four species of Mycobacterium genus exhibited a large difference among each other with respect to ISFDP. Chromosome of Mycobacterium sp. KMS (68.44%) exhibited parity between S nucleotides as well as between W nucleotides, whereas chromosome of M. ulcerans Agy99 (65.47%) exhibited strong violation of the parity between S nucleotides as well as between W nucleotides.ISFDP in chromosomes of archaea and eukaryotesOut of the 49 archaea chromosomes, 30 exhibited ISFDP, 6 exhibited violations of it between S nucleotides as well as between W nucleotides, 6 exhibited violations only between S nucleotides and 7 exhibited violations only between W nucleotides (Table 4). Chromosomes of Methanobrevibacter smithii ATCC 35061 (31.02%) and Staphylothermus marinus F1 (35.71%) exhibited strong violation of ISFDP between S nucleotides as well as between W nucleotides. Chromosomes of Metallosphaera sedula DSM 5348 (46.21%) and Pyrobaculum aerophilum IM2 (51.34%) exhibited strong violations between S nucleotides but weak violations between W nucleotides. Strong violation between W nucleotides and weak violation between S nucleotides were observed in chromosomes of Methanosarcina barkeri Fusaro (39.27%) and Nitrosopumilus maritimus SCM1 (31.15%). This suggests that within a chromosome, the magnitude of parity violation between S nucleotides may be different from that between W nucleotides in archaea also like that of bacteria. Intra-species parity violation was also observed in archaea in the case of Methanococcus maripaludis. The C5 strain exhibited ISFDP violation between W nucleotides but exhibited parity between S nucleotides. The C6, C7 and S2 strains exhibited ISFDP between S nucleotides as well as between W nucleotides.Out of the 18 eukaryotic chromosomes belonging to five species, 15 chromosomes exhibited ISFDP (Table 4). Strong violation of ISFDP only between S nucleotides is observed in Leishmania major Friedlin chromosome 01 (62.84%). Plasmodium falciparum 3D7chromosome 05 exhibited weak violation of parity between S nucleotides as well as between W nucleotides, whereas chromosome 01 exhibited violation of parity only between W nucleotides. The other four chromosomes of P. falciparum exhibited parity between S nucleotides as well as between W nucleotides. Similarly, the eight chromosomes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae even though exhibited parity between S nucleotides as well as between W nucleotides, the P-values either for S nucleotides or for W nucleotides is of more than 10-fold difference among the chromosomes. This differential ISFDP violation observed among chromosomes of an organism suggests that there may not be any strict rule inside a cell to maintain ISFDP.ISFDP between complementary oligonucleotides in chromosomesISP between compositional abundance values of complimentary oligonucleotides is well reported. We studied here the frequency distribution of complementary di- and trinucleotides in chromosomes as described for mononucleotides. The smooth curves of oligonucleotide frequencies have been shown in Supplementary data. In Supplementary Fig. S1a and b, the frequency distributions of dinucleotides have been shown for E. coli K12 MG1655 and Pseudomonas entomophila L48 chromosome (64.16%). Out of the 12 smooth frequency curves (four palindromic dinucleotides were excluded), overlapping of the curves between complementary dinucleotides is observed. In Fig. 2, though the abundance values of aa, tt, tg and ca dinucleotides in E. coli chromosome are close, the distributions between the complementary dinucleotides are found only overlapping and that of the non-complementary ones are different. The distributions for aa and tt follow a higher standard deviation (values not shown) than that of tg and ca. Similarly, gg and cc dinucleotides distributions exhibit a higher standard deviation (values not shown) than that of the dinucleotides tc and ga, although the abundance values of the four dinucleotides are close to each other. The significance of the similarity was studied by the KS test which suggested that the frequency distributions between complementary dinucleotides are statistically similar. Apart from this, dinucleotides distribution parity has been studied in three more bacterial chromosomes, two archaea chromosomes and one eukaryotic chromosome (data not shown) and similar result has been observed. In Supplementary Fig. S2i and ii, the distribution of 22 trinucleotides of E. coli K12 MG1655 chromosome is shown. Like dinucleotides, overlapping between the distributions of complementary trinucleotides is also observed. Distribution similarity between complementary trinucleotides was studied by the KS test for the 64 trinucleotides which suggested that the distributions of complementary trinucleotides within a strand are similar. The same study was done in one more bacterial chromosome (data not shown) and similar results were obtained. Although we did not analyzed the chromosomes of archaea and eukaryotes for trinucleotide distribution parity, it is expected to be there because these chromosomes had exhibite",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the upper row, the entire DNA strand is composed of forward encoded sequences (black color). Parity is not observed in this case. In the lower row, the DNA strand is made up of 50% forward encoded sequences and the other 50% is the reverse encoded sequences (white color).

Parity is observed in this case.ISFDP weakly correlates with Chargaff's second parityComparison of ISFDP was done with the ATS/GCS in chromosomes to find out whether one can define the other. GCS was compared with ISFDP violation between S nucleotides and ATS was compared with ISFDP violation between W nucleotides. Among the bacterial chromosomes, maximum GCS was found in X. fastidiosa 9a5c with the value 0.0529. All of the 16 chromosomes with GCS ≥0.01 were found to violate ISFDP (14 strongly violated and 2 weakly violated). Out of the 18 chromosomes with GCS ≥0.005 but <0.01, 6 exhibited insignificant violation, 7 exhibited strong violation and 5 exhibited weak violation of ISFDP. Similarly, out of 56 chromosomes with GCS ≥0.001 but <0.005, 5 exhibited strong violation, 11 exhibited weak violation and 40 exhibited insignificant violation. Out of the 22 chromosomes with GCS <0.001, except B. thuringiensis Al Hakam chromosome (with GCS value 0.00081 exhibited weak violation of ISFDP) all other exhibited insignificant violation. Maximum ATS was found in X. fastidiosa 9a5c with the value 0.04727. Out of the five chromosomes with ATS ≥0.01, four were found to violate ISFDP (two strongly violated and two weakly violated), whereas Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae J exhibited insignificant violation (with ATS 0.0102). Out of the 14 chromosomes with ATS ≥0.005 but <0.01, 6 exhibited insignificant violation, 3 exhibited strong violation and 5 exhibited weak violation of ISFDP. Out of the 67 chromosomes with ATS ≥0.001 but <0.005, 57 exhibited parity, 1 strongly violated and 9 violated weakly between the W nucleotides. All the 26 chromosomes with ATS ≤0.001 exhibited insignificant violation of ISFDP. These results suggest that chromosomes with high ATS/GCS (≥0.01) have a stronger propensity to violate ISFDP and chromosomes with low ATS/GCS (≤0.001) have a stronger propensity to exhibit ISFDP. However, chromosomes with intermediate ATS/GCS (≥0.001 and ≤0.01) have the possibility of either exhibiting parity or violating the parity.Correlation analysis was done between the P-values (from the KS test between) of W nucleotides and ATS as well as between the P-values (from the KS test between) of S nucleotides and GCS. The r-values are −0.5572 and −0.4526 for W and S nucleotides, respectively. This suggests that the correlation between the two ISP features is weak. The correlation between ATS and GCS is 0.629, which suggests that parity violation between S nucleotides weakly correlates with parity violation between W nucleotides within a chromosome. Unlike ATS and GCS correlation, no correlation was found between the P-values (the KS test) of W nucleotides and that of S nucleotides, which supports that ISFDP and Chargaff's second parity are not the same.In the case of the archaea chromosomes, the ISFDP analysis revealed similar results to that of bacterial chromosomes. Maximum GCS with the value 0.03768 was found in the chromosome of M. smithii ATCC 35061 (31.02%) followed by the value 0.02726 in S. marinus F1 (35.71%), in which significant ISFDP violation was also observed. In the GCS interval 0.005 < GCS ≤ 0.01, there were eight chromosomes out of which five exhibited weak violation and three exhibited insignificant violation of ISFDP. Out of the 24 chromosomes in the interval 0.001 < GCS ≤ 0.005, 2 exhibited weak violation and 22 exhibited insignificant violation of ISFDP. These results suggest that chromosomes with high ATS/GCS (≥0.01) are most likely going to violate ISFDP and chromosomes with low ATS/GCS (≤0.001) are most likely going to exhibit ISFDP. However, chromosomes with intermediate ATS/GCS ((≥0.001 and≤0.01) have the possibility of either exhibiting parity or violating the parity. Pearson's correlation coefficient between ATS and GCS was found to be 0.707847, which is similar to that of the bacterial analysis. The r-values between ATS and the P-values of KS (W) as well as GCS and the P-values of KS (S) were found to be −0.57495 and −0.47557, respectively, suggesting a weak correlation.The chromosomes with asymmetric replication topography are more prone to ISFDP violation in bacteriaBacterial chromosome is a single replicon. Owing to the bidirectional mode of replication, one part of a strand is synthesized as LeS whereas the other part is synthesized as LaS. In most of the chromosomes, the mutational strand asymmetry causes K nucleotides > M nucleotides in LeS and the reverse in (K nucleotides < M nucleotides) in LaS. In an ideal case where the termination site is located symmetrically with respect to the origin of replication in a chromosome, the excess of K nucleotides in LeS will be similar to the excess of M nucleotides in LaS and therefore will cancel each other to exhibit Chargaff's second parity in chromosomes. Potential replication origin and termination sites for different chromosomes based on ATS, GCS, coding sequence skew, nucleotide skew at the third position of codons and oligonucleotides skew in chromosomes have been reported,31,32 which has been reviewed in detail.33 Out of the 112 bacterial chromosomes analyzed in this study, information regarding the potential site for the origin and termination of 56 chromosomes is available. ISFDP violation between S nucleotides was compared with the angular deviation of termination site because G > C in LeS is a more universal feature of chromosomes than T > A in LeS. Of the 112 chromosomes, maximum angular deviation of 71.28° is reported in B. pertussis Tohama 1. Out of the 14 chromosomes where ≥20° angular deviation was observed, 12 exhibited violation of ISFDP between S nucleotides. Pseudomonas putida F1 (61.86%) with 36.8° and C. burnetii RSA 493 (42.66%) with 31.14° angular deviations exhibited insignificant parity violation. Out of the 11 chromosomes with deviation ≥10° but <20°, 4 chromosomes exhibited ISFDP violation between S nucleotides. Out of the 30 strains with deviation ≥1.0° and ≤10°, 9 chromosomes exhibited parity violation between S nucleotides. Chlamydophila abortus S263 with angular deviation only 0.569°, parity violation was observed only between S nucleotides. This study indicates that chromosomes with higher asymmetric topography are more prone to violate the parity. However, chromosomes with symmetric replication topography were also observed to violate the parity.The correlation coefficient between angular deviations and GCS as well as ATS values are 0.474 and 0.357, respectively, suggesting a weak correlation. The correlation between angular deviations and P-value of S (the KS test between S nucleotides) as well as that of W (the KS test between W nucleotides) are −0.259 and −0.048, respectively. The angular deviation in X. fastidiosa 9a5c is 62.96°, whereas the same in Temecula 1 is 6.44°. The difference in the magnitude of ISFDP violation between the strains might be attributed to the chromosome topography. Comparison for the four H. influenzae strains could not be done due to the unavailability of information for all the strains. The Rd KW20 chromosome (that violated ISFDP) has the angular deviation 46°, which might be an important factor to violate ISFDP. Archaea chromosomes have been reported to have more replication origin like eukaryotic chromosomes. Therefore, replication topography will not be applicable to study ISFDP violations in these cases.Composition of forward- and reverse-encoded sequences within DNA strands might influence the parityMost of the regions in prokaryotic chromosomes are composed of coding sequences. Presence of both forward- and reverse-encoded sequences in bacterial chromosomes has been proposed for the observation of Chargaff's second parity in chromosomes.8,9 So we analyzed only coding sequences in chromosomes of bacteria and archaea to study ISFDP as follows (Fig. 2): in one way (Case I), a DNA strand is only composed of only forward-encoded sequences, and in the other way (Case II), a DNA strand is composed of 50% forward-encoded and 50% reverse-encoded sequences. The result is shown for E. coli chromosome (Fig. 3A and B). The smooth frequency curves of complementary nucleotides overlap in Fig. 3B, whereas in Fig. 3A, they do not overlap. The significance of these overlaps were studied by the KS test which suggests that the similarity between the distribution of complementary nucleotides in Case II. Similar results were obtained by the analysis of several bacterial (10) and archaea (15) chromosomes.(A and B) Frequency distribution study of nucleotides in coding sequences. Smooth curves present the group-frequency distribution of the four nucleotides a (square), t (asterisk), g (triangle) and c (rhombus). The X-axis represents the abundance values of the nucleotide spanning a range, whereas the Y-axis represents the frequency of the abundance values. In (A), the frequency of the nucleotides in a DNA strand only composed of forward encoded sequences of E. coli is shown (coding sequences analyzed for other chromosomes exhibited the similar feature). It is evident from (B) that the frequency distributions of the complementary nucleotides do not overlap. In (B), the frequency of the nucleotides of the same DNA strand done where 50% of the sequence was joined with the rest after reverse complementation (see the Materials and methods section). This resembled a strand composed of 50% forward encoded sequences and 50% reverse encoded sequences. It is evident from the figures that parity between the complementary nucleotides is observed in this case. These observations have been confirmed by the KS test.(A and B) Frequency distribution study of nucleotides in coding sequences. Smooth curves present the group-frequency distribution of the four nucleotides a (square), t (asterisk), g (triangle) and c (rhombus). The X-axis represents the abundance values of the nucleotide spanning a range, whereas the Y-axis represents the frequency of the abundance values.

It is evident from (B) that the frequency distributions of the complementary nucleotides do not overlap.

This resembled a strand composed of 50% forward encoded sequences and 50% reverse encoded sequences. It is evident from the figures that parity between the complementary nucleotides is observed in this case. These observations have been confirmed by the KS test.A comparative analysis between the Ws and Cs in a chromosome with respect to their composition of forward-encoded sequences was done in X. fastidiosa species as well as in H. influenza species. The relative differences in the compositional abundance values of forward sequences in Ws and Cs of X. fastidiosa 9a5c and X. fastidiosa Temecula 1 chromosomes are 0.078 and 0.015, respectively, which indicate that the proportion of forward- and reverse-encoded sequence in 9a5c strain is more disproportionate than that of Temecula 1 strain, which might be the reason for a stronger parity violation in the former. The relative differences of the compositional abundance values of forward-encoded sequences in Ws and Cs of H. influenzae 86-028NP (exhibits parity) and H. influenzae Rd KW20 (violates parity) chromosomes are 0.030 and 0.005, respectively, which suggest that the proportion of forward- and reverse-encoded sequences in 86-028NP strain is more disproportionate than that of Rd KW20 strain. This is in contrast to the result of X. fastidiosa, i.e. parity violation is observed in the strain (Rd KW20) with more proportionate gene distribution between Ws and Cs, whereas insignificant parity violation is observed in chromosome with disproportionate gene distribution between the strands. A quantitative estimation of the coding sequences in both the strands of the chromosomes was done in few other bacteria and archaea such as A. tumefaciens, B. subtilis, E. coli, M. smithii and S. marinus (Fig. 4). Maximum difference of ORF numbers between Ws and Cs was found in S. marinus, in which the parity violation was also observed. However, the relative difference of ORFs between the strands is found more in B. subtilis than in M. smithii. The former exhibited the parity whereas the latter violated it. Agrobacterium tumefaciens was shown to possess minimum relative difference of ORF numbers between the strands but violates parity. The results from this indicate that a higher disproportionate composition of forward- and reverse-encoded sequences within a strand has greater propensity to parity violation. However, proportionate composition of the sequences not necessarily implies the exhibition of parity.Relative disproportionate composition of ORFs between Ws and Cs in chromosomes. The composition of ORFs in Ws and Cs of seven bacteria and two archaea was studied. Relative disproportionate composition was found out by deducting the ORF numbers between the two strands and then dividing the value obtained by the total number of ORFs present in both the strands. In A. tumefaciens, relative disproportionate value found to be minimum suggesting that the difference in the number of ORFs between the strands is relatively minimum when compared with others. In the archaea S. marinus, the value is found to be maximum among these nine strains. Both A. tumefaciens and S. marinus exhibited ISFDP violations, whereas insignificant ISFDP violation observed between E. coli and B. subtilis. Comparison between the strains of X. fastidiosa and H. influenzae is shown.Relative disproportionate composition of ORFs between Ws and Cs in chromosomes.

Comparison between the strains of X. fastidiosa and H. influenzae is shown.DiscussionWe have described in this study a new ISP feature in chromosomes, which is found in bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. The methodology used to study this parity gives the statistical significance of similarity between the two distributions of complementary nucleotides/oligonucleotides. The basic qualitative feature of ISFDP is not changing for a chromosome even the segmentation is done at randomly taking any point out of the first 1000 nucleotides as the starting point. In other words, the sampling fluctuation is not affecting the feature. The correlation between the ISFDP and ISP is not strong, which is in accordance with the view that similarity in the total abundance values of two complementary nucleotides will not always yield similarity in their frequency distribution pattern. However, violation of ISP will definitely exhibit violation of ISFDP. Around 50% of the chromosomes in bacteria are found to exhibit ISFDP violations. Chromosomes of H. influenzae Rd KW20, M. tuberculosis F11, etc., which have been reported to exhibit ISP, are found to violate ISFDP.27ISFDP violation observed in all possible combinations in chromosomes: (i) violation of parity between S nucleotides as well as between W nucleotides; (ii) only between S nucleotides and only between W nucleotides. The correlation between ATS and GCS is found to be not strong suggesting that parity violation between S nucleotides not necessarily always associate with parity violations between W nucleotides and vice versa. This can be called as intra-chromosomal parity violations. ISFDP violations of different magnitudes were found among chromosomes of different strains belonging to a species which can be referred as intra-species parity violations. Examples are C. burnetii, H. influenzae and X. fastidiosa. These intra-chromosomal and intra-species violations suggest that there may not be any strict rule existing in cells to maintain ISFDP in chromosomes. Differential ISP among chromosomes within a species and between chromosomes within a bacterium has already been reported in Chlamydophila pneumoniae strains and Deinococcus radiodurans R1 chromosomes,27 respectively. However, these were not considered significant in their study due to the lack of statistical proof. Oligonucleotide skew patterns also have been found to be variable among strains of Yersinia pestis. These intra-species variations in the chromosomal features are interesting and need in-depth analysis of the genome sequences to find out the reason that might reveal the reason for ISP/ISFDP violation in chromosomes and between the two ISP features.Enrichment of LeS with K nucleotides over M nucleotides and the vice versa in LaS due to the mutational strand asymmetry is a general observation in chromosomes. Owing to the bidirectional replication, GCS/ATS in LeS is cancelled with GCS/ATS in LaS which results in the establishment of parity in chromosomes. The cancellation effect indirectly suggests that the compositional abundance values between the two complementary nucleotides even though they differ within a sub-chromosomal region. This is in support of the observation here that chromosomes with higher GCS/ATS values are violating ISFDP and chromosomes with lower GCS/ATS are exhibiting the parity. However, the chromosomes with intermediate range GCS/ATS are found to exhibit parity as well as violate parity and this violation is independent of genome GC%. For example, Streptococcus mutans UA159, Rickettsia conorii Malish 7, C. jejuni subsp. jejuni 81116, Campylobacter concisus 13826 and Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris MG1363, Helicobacter pylori J99 are (all AT-rich organisms) chromosomes with GCS≥0.005 that exhibit ISFDP between S nucleotides, whereas chromosomes of B. anthracis strains (AT rich) with similar GCS (>0.005) violate ISFDP between S nucleotides. So ISFDP in these chromosomes is an interesting aspect of future research.In concordant with the view of the bidirectional replication and establishment of parity in chromosomes, several chromosomes with higher asymmetric replication topography were found to violate ISFDP. The exceptions are P. putida F1 and C. burnetii RSA 493 chromosomes with 36° and 31° angular deviations, respectively. Chromosomes of C. abortus S263 and Magnetospirillum magneticum AMB-1, with very less angular deviations 0.57° and 2.14°, respectively, are found violating ISFDP. This indicates that features apart from the replication topography might contribute to the parity establishment in chromosomes. Proportionate composition of forward-encoded sequences between the two strands though thought to be responsible to establish the parity after the analysis of artificially constructed chromosomes, several observations went against it. The extreme case is A. tumefaciens where the composition is very much proportionate but violations of ISFDP are strong. So the two factors such as asymmetric replication topography and disproportionate composition of forward-encoded sequences between the strands in chromosomes that were assumed to play important roles in determining ISFDP violations were found to be insufficient.In spite of different selection/mutation pressures on chromosomes as exemplified by codon usage,34 replication topography,31 isochores35 and GCS/ATS,21 the tendency of the chromosomes of all types toward maintaining the ISFDP is interesting. Since ISFDP and ISP are the outcomes of compositional abundance of nucleotides (mono/oligo), theories proposed for ISP might hold true for ISFDP. The Nussinov–Forsdyke hypothesis is that stem–loop potential has an adaptive advantage, and therefore an important factor driving the compositional symmetry (ISP) between the complementary oligonucleotides36,37 has been challenged recently by Chen and Zhao38 for human chromosomes. This indicates that the stem–loop (recombination) hypothesis might not be the only explanation for ISP in chromosomes. Baisnée et al.8 have argued that the reverse complement symmetry does not result only from point mutation or from recombination, but from a combination effect of different mechanisms at different orders.8 Two independent reports have theoretically shown that multiple inversion events in chromosomes can establish ISP.10,39 Though this hypothesis looks fine theoretically, frequent inversion unable to explain the universal observation of opposite GCS/ATS in LeS and LaS,40 gene distribution asymmetry between the strands41 and the maintenance of gene orders among different bacterial chromosomes.42 This hypothesis also does not describe any functional significance/advantage of the ISP/ISFDP feature, which is so wide spread in chromosomes. Theoretically, it has also been argued that the mismatch error repairing system is responsible to establish Chargaff's second parity rule in chromosomes.13 However, the intra-chromosomal parity violation observed in eukaryotes (this study) goes against this hypothesis.We think the important factor that determines ISP/ISFDP in chromosomes is the bidirectional replication. This causes one part of a strand Ws/Cs as LeS and the other part as LaS. The strand mutational asymmetry and gene distribution asymmetry between LeS and LaS therefore cancel out each other within the strand to exhibit the parity. In the case of ssDNA/ssRNA viruses, gene distribution is restricted to one strand only depending on which these are called as either plus or – strand viruses. The genome size is also not large (<10 kb) in these phages43,44 and during replication, one strand only acts as the template on which the other strand is made. Most likely these features are responsible for violating the parity in these genomes. The advantages of bidirectional replication in bacteria and archaea where the nucleus is absent are as follows: (i) quicker completion of replication than the unidirectional mode of replication and (ii) the meeting of the two replication forks might be sending some signal to the cell for the completion of chromosome replication where the nucleus is absent. Symmetric replication topography will help to terminate the replication from the origin in a lesser time in comparison with an asymmetric topography. So the selection pressure to maintain the symmetric replication topography in fast-growing bacteria is likely to be more than that in slow-growing bacteria. This proposition has similarity with the Selection Mutation Drift theory proposed for codon usage45 in bacteria. Our study of ISFDP of Vibrio species (the generation time is 0.2–0.3 h; fast-growing) in this context seems to be also not holding true here because its chromosomes violate ISFDP between W nucleotides. Moreover, comparison of generation time40 with asymmetry in replication topography of chromosomes32 exhibits no correlation (data not shown). More research on this aspect will give a conclusive result if the growth rate has any relation with parity establishment in chromosomes. In conclusion, our study has revealed an interesting aspect of ISP. Future research will reveal the reason for the presence of this parity in chromosomes.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.A part of this work has been presented as a poster by S.K.R. in the International Conference ISMB2008 at Toronoto, Canada.

IntroductionPrimary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs) are a genetically heterogeneous group of disorders that affect distinct components of the innate and adaptive immune system, such as neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells, natural killer cells and T and B lymphocytes. The study of these diseases has provided essential insights into the functioning of our immune system. More than 120 distinct genes have been identified, whose abnormalities account for more than 150 distinct forms of PID.1 PIDs are challenging for both researchers and clinicians because they represent natural models of immunopathology, which can usually be studied effectively only in animal models, and manifest with a wide range of clinical symptoms ranging from susceptibility to infections and allergies to autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. The genetic defects that cause PIDs can affect the expression and function of proteins involved in a range of biological processes, such as immune development, effector-cell functions, signaling cascades and maintenance of immune homeostasis.2Because genes and proteins rarely work in isolation, genes that directly or functionally interact with known PID genes could also represent additional PID genes. We have recently developed a database of PID genes designated ‘Resource of Asian PDIs (RAPID)’, which contains information pertaining to genes and proteins involved in PDIs along with other relevant information about protein–protein interactions, mouse knockout studies and microarray gene expression profiles in various cells and organs of the immune system. These significant features of PID genes, including their involvement in immune signaling pathways, were used as input binary features for the prediction of additional candidate PID genes using a support vector machine (SVM) learning approach.SVM is a powerful machine learning technique widely used in the computational biology such as microarray data analysis,3–8 protein secondary structure prediction,9 prediction of human signal peptide cleavage sites,10 translational initiation site recognition in DNA,11 protein fold recognition,12,13 prediction of protein–protein interactions,14 prediction of protein sub-cellular localization,15–18 and peptide identification from mass-spectrometry derived data.19SVM is a learning algorithm that can be used to generate a classifier from a set of positively and negatively labeled training data sets.20 SVM learns the classifier by mapping the input training samples into a possibly high-dimensional feature space and seeking a hyperplane in this space, which separates the two types of examples with the largest possible margin, i.e. distance to the nearest points. If the training set is not linearly separable, SVM finds a hyperplane, which optimizes a trade-off between good classification and large margin.20For predicting a classifier between PID and non-PID genes, we have solved the above problem and obtained a linear classifier (Fig. 1). To prove generalization of the predicted classifier, we have reported leave-one-out (LOO) error for the training data set. In this approach, we have used all the known PID genes that have been described in the literature as a positive data set. The gene list for negative data sets was selected from mouse genomic informatics (MGI) database based on the criterion that mutations in mice do not result in either immune or hematopoietic system phenotypes. We trained SVM with 69 features (Supplementary Table S1) for both PID genes (positive data set) and genes that were not reported to be associated with PIDs (negative data set). The trained SVM was then used to predict candidate PID genes by testing all human genes (except those used in the training data sets) as test data set.A schematic of SVM training strategy.A schematic of SVM training strategy.2. Materials and methods2.1. Initial platformRAPIDs, which is available as a worldwide web resource at http://rapid.rcai.riken.jp/21 was used as a source of information about PID genes. RAPID hosts information on sequences and expression at the mRNA and protein levels of genes reported to be involved in PID patients. The main objective of this database was to provide detailed information pertaining to genes and proteins involved in PIDs along with other relevant information about protein–protein interactions, mouse knockout studies and microarray gene expression profiles in various organs and cells of the immune system.2.2. Features used for training the data setsThe PDIs are characterized by essential defects in the functions of the immune system, leading to increased susceptibility to infections. Although rare, these disorders cover a wide spectrum of defects, including antibody deficiencies, cellular immune deficiencies, combined immune deficiencies, phagocytic defects, complement and other innate immunity defects. On the basis of these observations for all the known PID genes, we selected 69 features (Supplementary Table S1) which not only play an important role in the development, maintenance and normal functioning of immune/hematopoietic systems but also in understanding molecular pathophysiology of PID disease causing genes. These features can be broadly classified as features for signaling pathways from NetPath and KEGG22–24 database, microarray gene expression profile from RefDIC25 database, site of expression from HPRD26 and Human Proteinpedia,27 immune/hematopoietic phenotypes from MGI28,29 and interaction with PID feature from HPRD.2.3. Data setsTo train the SVM, two types of data sets were generated—the positive data set consists of all the known PID genes, whereas the negative data set contained genes where no immune/hematopoietic system abnormalities were described due to mouse knockouts, knockins or spontaneous mutations reported for the mouse orthologs in the MGI database.30 On the basis of these criteria, 148 PID genes were in the positive data set and 3162 genes were in the negative data set. Test data set contains 36 677 genes encoded by the human genome. Genes involved in both the training and test data sets were assigned a binary score of ‘1’ and ‘0,’ respectively, based on their presence or absence in a particular feature. The trained SVM was used to classify PID or non-PID genes from an unlabeled test data set which consists of all human genes (Fig. 2).A schematic of the algorithm for prediction of candidate PID genes.A schematic of the algorithm for prediction of candidate PID genes.2.4. SVM implementationWe used SVMlight (http://svmlight.joachims.org/), an implementation of Support Vector Machines in C, and also used customized functions written in MATLAB (http://www.mathtools.net/MATLAB/) for the calculation of confidence score for each predicted candidate PID gene. Absolute score also known as confidence score can be defined as  where  represents the separating hyperplane calculated by SVM. The score indicates how far that particular gene from the positive side of the hyperplane. In other words, higher the score more likely that a particular gene is a candidate PID gene. Using this approach, 1442 candidate PID genes were predicted which falls on the positive side of the hyperplane.2.5. LOO errorLOO error measurement involves removing one gene from the training set, training the SVM on the remaining genes and then predicting the class label of that gene that was left out. This process is repeated until all the genes are left out exactly once. If the gene was classified correctly, the error was reported as zero, else the error was reported as one. This process was repeated by leaving out each gene once and the LOO error of the data set represent the average of individual errors.3. Results and discussionOver 1500 Mendelian disorders whose molecular basis is unknown are catalogued in the online Mendelian inheritance in man (OMIM) database.31 Most of disease-gene identification efforts involve either linkage analysis or association studies.32,33 Recently, a number of in silico approaches to identify candidate disease genes have been developed that use available information reported from various studies such as functional annotation, gene expression profiles, annotated sequence features, protein–protein interactions and pathway information.34–39 Several machine learning approaches have also been employed to identify important genes for disease classification. SVM approach is generally preferred owing to its superior performance.40 In most instances, SVM is a powerful tool in dealing with high-dimensional low sample size data sets, which also performs well in various biological analyses including text categorization, evaluating microarray expression data and inferring functional annotation from protein sequence and structure data.3,4,41,42 In this study, we trained an SVM with 69 features for both positive (all known PID genes) and negative (genes with no immune/hematopoietic systems affected due to mutations from MGI) gene data sets.As the number of genes in the positive data set is small, the LOO error was calculated for showing generalization of the algorithm. LOO error is explained in detail under the Materials and methods section. For this, we used a data set containing 148 PID genes from positive data sets along with 148 genes that were randomly selected from the negative data set. This process was repeated and from 60 such data sets, the LOO error was calculated. The average LOO error reported over 60 data sets was ∼8%. The LOO error reported by leaving out only the PID (positive) genes one by one (where training set contains same setting of 296 data points) was ∼15%.3.1. Sensitivity and specificityThe sensitivity and specificity of the data sets was 0.85 and 0.98, respectively. On the basis of these results, we conclude that the number of genes falsely predicted to be PID genes by the trained classifier is ∼2%. We believe that availability of comprehensive and accurate biological data is a limitation that restricts the prediction accuracy and performance of this algorithm. As more data accumulates about the human genome and proteome, we expect the performance of this algorithm to improve further in the future. The complete list of predicted candidate genes is provided in Supplementary Table S2 and also available at the RAPID website http://rapid.rcai.riken.jp/. All 69 features of the predicted candidate PID genes can also be downloaded from the RAPID website.3.2. Evaluation studiesWe were able to evaluate our predictions in a limited fashion because a few studies have been published describing novel PID genes that were not included in our original list of PID genes. These experimental studies have confirmed six of the genes in our predicted list of PID genes as true PID genes. These are myeloid differentiation factor-88 (MYD88), catalytic subunit of DNA dependent serine/threonine protein kinase (PRKDC), glucose-6-phosphatase, catalytic subunit 3 (G6PC3),43–45 IL2-inducible T-cell kinase (ITK), coronin, actin binding protein 1A (CORO1A) and Interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL1RN).46–49 MyD88 is a key downstream adaptor protein in IL1 receptor complex and toll-like receptors signaling pathways involved in inflammatory response and host defense. In addition, MyD88 is also involved in tumorigenesis in models of hepatocarcinoma and familial associated polyposis; negative regulation of TLR3 signaling and in PKC epsilon activation.50 Patients with MyD88 deficiency are reported to be susceptible to pyogenic bacterial infections including invasive pneumococcal disease.45 Defect in PRKDC has been reported for the first time in a radiosensitive T-B-SCID patient that results in inhibition of Artemis activation and non-homologous end-joining.44 A report of mutations in G6PC3 gene has been observed among patients with severe congenital neutropenia syndrome and also shown to be susceptible to increased apoptosis that leads to disturbances in cardiac or urogenital development.43 A novel PDI, IL-2 inducible T-cell kinase (ITK) deficiency has been observed due to fatal immune dysregulation followed by EBV infection and identified homozygous mutation in the SH2 domain of ITK gene that resulted in protein destabilization and absence of NKT cells.47 A patient with T cell-deficient, B cell-sufficient and NK cell-sufficient severe combined immunodeficiency has been identified with mutation in CORO1A gene along with reduced T-cell function that was earlier demonstrated in knock-out mice of coro1a gene with similar phenotypes.49 Deficiency of the IL1-receptor antagonist, an autosomal recessive autoinflammatory disease, has been reported for the first time in children presented with clinical phenotypes of multifocal osteomyelitis, periostitis, pustulosis, thrombosis and respiratory insufficiency due to the homozygous deletion of the IL1RN gene.46,48 Further, functional analysis of these mutants confirmed diminished or lack of mRNA and protein expressions leading to cytokine abnormalities.There are two recent independent reports51,52 on the identification and prioritization of candidate disease genes in general as well as specific to primary immunodeficiencies by integrating functional annotations from gene ontology and compilation of protein interaction network data sets from BIND,53 BioGRID54 and HPRD.26 In the latter studies, 24 candidate genes were reported that are likely to be involved in PID have been identified using these parameters, out of which, over 80% of these genes are already listed as candidates in our SVM analysis, thereby, paving the way for successful implementation of this approach in the future.We have also summarized reports of genome-wide association studies and other related studies for newly identified candidate PID genes and the associated immunological disorder (Table 1). Because the candidate PID gene list is still large, this approach of integrating data from high-throughput studies would allow further prioritization of genes for confirmation in patients with PID where the exact gene is not yet identified. We hope that such integrated approaches should assist PID physicians and researchers to gain insights into the pathophysiology of these diseases at a faster pace, which could be translated to improve the diagnosis and/or treatment of PIDs.A list of predicted PID genes whose association with immunological disorders has been reported recentlyA list of predicted PID genes whose association with immunological disorders has been reported recently3.3.

This study provides a basic framework and an important user-friendly public information resource which enables analyses of transcriptional regulation in soybean.1. IntroductionSequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factors (TFs) are the key molecular switches that control or influence many of the biological processes such as development, growth, cell division and responses to environmental stimuli in a cell or organism. By being capable of activating or repressing transcription of multiple target genes, they affect the metabolism, physiological balance and progression in cells and the responses of cells to the environment.1–3 TFs form complex regulatory networks at the transcriptional level and through protein–protein interactions among themselves or with proteins of other classes. Protein–protein interactions may also form with other transcriptional regulators such as chromatin remodelling/modifying proteins to recruit or block access of RNA polymerases to the DNA template. The specific interactions between TFs and a family of cis-regulatory sequences described by a consensus motif play a central part in how genetic regulatory proteins affect spatial and temporal gene expression.4 Additionally, alterations in the activity and regulatory specificity of TFs are emerging as a major source of diversity and evolutionary adaptation.5,6In the past decade, the availability of complete genome sequences and the development of high-throughput experimental techniques have enabled scientists to compile complementary information describing the function and organization of TF regulatory systems in a number of organisms. The identification, characterization and classification of TFs at the genome-wide level will provide an important resource for researchers who are interested in studying the regulation of gene expression. Similar to other proteins, TFs are comprised evolutionarily conserved units called ‘domains’, which belong to families that can occur in many different proteins. The majority of TFs can be grouped into a number of different families according to the specific type of DNA-binding domain (DBD) that is present within their sequence.7–10 Using bioinformatics approaches, computational studies have documented valuable TF repertoires by searching for genes containing DBDs within individual organisms ranging from prokaryotes to eukaryotes or by searching across all completely sequenced genomes.7,8,10–18In plants, ∼7% of the genome encodes putative TFs.19 Despite their importance as a fundamental component of biological systems, the TF repertoires for many plant genomes remain largely unknown and understudied. Analyses of expressed sequence tag (EST) and genome sequence databases have indicated that legumes encode more than 2000 TFs per genome. At the present time, less than 1% of these putative TFs have been genetically and functionally characterized.19 Our basic knowledge of TFs and their role in transcriptional regulation is derived from molecular biological and genetic investigations. Proper characterization of particular TFs often requires a detailed study in the biological context of a whole TF family, since functional redundancy is a common occurrence within TF families.20–24 Furthermore, since TFs control the expression of the genome, it is not possible to completely understand their function without performing detailed functional studies at a genome-wide level.7,25–27Soybean (Glycine max L.) is a nutritionally important crop which provides an abundant source of oil and protein for worldwide human consumption.28–31 In addition, soybean is also viewed as an attractive crop for the production of renewable fuels such as biodiesel. Due to its symbiosis with nitrogen fixing bacteria, soybean can fix atmospheric nitrogen and therefore requires minimal input of nitrogen fertilizer. Agricultural dependence on nitrogen fertilizer often accounts for the single largest energy input in agronomic practices.32 With the recent completion of the soybean genomic sequence (http://www.phytozome.net/soybean#C Soybean Genome Project, DOE Joint Genome Institute), the identification, isolation and functional analysis of important genes will be accelerated. From a biotechnology perspective, this resource will be especially important for studying regulatory genes involved in plant productivity, seed quality, nitrogen fixation and the sensing/response and adaptation to the environment. Within the soy genome model, ∼975 Mb has been captured in 20 chromosomes and 66 153 protein-coding loci have been predicted (http://www.phytozome.net/soybean#C). With the completion of the soybean genome sequence, the full complement of TF-encoding genes from this important crop can be characterized and functionally analysed.In this report, we searched for sequence-specific DNA-binding TFs using a prediction method which uses 51 Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) from the Pfam database. We also used 11 models, which were originally created by HMMbuild of HMMER2 package, to identify the domains within the putative TF proteins. The computational results predict that the soybean genome contains 5035 TF protein models coded from 4342 loci in 61 families. We created a database named ‘SoybeanTFDB’. This database provides open access for researchers to all relevant and basic information on functional motifs, full-length cDNAs, promoter regions, genomic distribution, gene duplication and multiple sequence alignment of the DBDs for each TF family. Since most of these TFs have not been experimentally characterized for regulatory function as indicated by assessment in PubMed, we searched for their putative regulatory function by assessing annotations of the gene ontology (GO) using comparative analysis with their Arabidopsis counterparts. As a complement to this functional prediction using GO annotations, we also mapped all putative cis-regulatory elements that were documented within the PLACE database on all TF encoding genes. In this analysis, we placed a particular emphasis on abiotic stress responsive cis-elements. Knowledge gained from identifying the presence of stress responsive cis-elements, in addition to GO annotation, enables effective prediction of stress responsive TFs. Taken together, in this study, we demonstrate a comprehensive and high-quality census of TFs encoded within the soybean genome. These results provide a solid foundation for further systematic characterization of soybean TFs using traditional molecular approaches and/or genomic techniques at either the single-gene level or family-wide scale.2. Materials and methods2.1. Identification of TF repertoire in soybeanTo identify TF encoding genes from the annotations of Glyma1 in the soybean genome, 51 HMMs of Pfam33 and those of 11 originally created using HMMbuild of the HMMER2 package (http://hmmer.janelia.org/) were applied, which corresponded to a total of 61 TF families (Supplementary Table S1). The modelled proteome data of annotated genes in Glyma1, which were downloaded from Phytozome (http://www.phytozome.net/), were subjected to a profile search for HMM dataset using Pfam-HMM with set thresholds of E-value, E < 1e−5 (Supplementary Table S1). The search results for each of the TF families were then applied to retrieve discovered regions as conserved DBDs and related annotations. To further classify genes with a conserved MYB domain into three subgroups: (R1)R2R3_MYB, MYB_related and atypical_MYB, the MYB soybean protein sequences were searched against previously classified Arabidopsis MYB genes34 using blastp (E < 1e−5) and each top hit combination was applied to the classification. To avoid possible contaminations of pseudo response regulator or histidine kinase sequences into the GARP_ARRB family, genes containing CCT, CHASE, HATPase_c and HisKA together with Response_reg of Pfam domains were searched by InterProScan. Genes, which hit in this search, were subsequently removed from the GARP_ARRB family.The putative TF encoding genes discovered in the soybean genome were classified into the following four categories based on their potential functionality as TFs. The first group of TFs (Category A) consists of TF encoding genes showing sequence identity ≥95% and a blastn E ≤ 1e−100 with GenBank soybean sequences having a functional description as TFs. Category A genes were classified with the highest confidence level after assessment with the PubMed database. The second group of TFs (Category B) is comprised TFs which have an equivalent protein domain arrangement (blastp E ≤ 1e−30) for regulatory function in well-annotated plants, such as Arabidopsis and/or rice. The third group of TFs (Category C) combines possible TFs which show a significant hit with each of the HMM models used for DBD prediction (Pfam-HMM E ≤ 1e−20). The last group contains TFs which have promiscuous HMM models with a threshold of settled E-values.2.2. Structural and functional annotations for putative soybean TFsFor annotating TF encoding genes in soybean,35 we used protein and cDNA sequences of soybean TFs as queries against the following protein and nucleotide datasets using the BLAST algorithm:36 the nr protein DB of NCBI (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/db); the protein data presented in TAIR release 8 (ftp://ftp.arabidopsis.org/home/tair/Sequences/blast_datasets); the protein data from UniProt (http://www.uniprot.org/); the TIGR/MSU Rice Genome Annotation Project (http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/) release 6; the soybean representative cDNA sequences in UniGene (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/repository/UniGene/); the TIGR Transcript Assemblies (http://plantta.jcvi.org/); the Plant GDB (http://www.plantgdb.org/); the sequence sets of ESTs and high throughput cDNAs (HTCs) of RIKEN soybean full-length cDNA clones (http://rsoy.psc.riken.jp/);37 the cDNAs of the previous version of the soybean genome annotation (Glyma0, Phytozome) and the target sequences of the Affymetrix soybean GeneChip (GPL4592 of NCBI GEO platform accession). All of the similarity searches using blastn were performed with threshold E < 1e−100, and the top scoring hit for each query was applied. All similarity searches with blastp against protein datasets were performed with a threshold E < 1e−5 to find possible functional descriptions for TF encoding genes. The top scoring hit for each query was applied.Conserved domains in the protein sequence of putative TF encoding genes were identified with InterProScan and the InterPro DB (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/) to predict structures of DBD of TFs together with other functional domains and associated GO terms. All domains and those positions predicted by the search were retrieved and implemented them into our database. To determine the global characteristic features of functional categories of TF encoding genes of soybean, the TFs were assigned to possible GO terms based on a blastp similarity search to find Arabidopsis counterparts together with those annotated GOs of TAIR8. Particular emphasis was placed on sequences serving under the ‘biological process’ functional category.TFs have been widely reported in plant TF databases such as DATF, AtTFDB, RARTF and PlnTFDB for Arabidopsis and DRTF, GRASIUS and PlnTFDB for rice. To annotate all putative soybean TFs in relation to Arabidopsis and rice counterparts, soybean TF sequences were assigned to annotation data related to TF families provided from each of the aforementioned databases based on sequence similarity searches between soybean proteome data and those of Arabidopsis and rice.8,14,38–42 The interrelated dataset of soybean genes, in combination with related Arabidopsis and rice TF annotations, were implemented into the SoybeanTFDB to provide cross references with other plant TFDBs.2.3. Gene duplications and gene clusters in soybean TF familiesGene duplications and gene clusterings in soybean TF families were estimated by analysing the amino acid sequences of TF genes found on soybean chromosomes. Specifically, the presence of gene pairs or gene clusters of closely homologous genes based on global sequence similarity with threshold of more than 60% amino acid sequence identity using cd-hit program of CD-HIT package were investigated.43 Gene clusters are defined as genetic loci containing three or more closely homologous genes. Once identified, the pairs or gene clusters were used to assess the chromosomal allocation of highly homologous genes. Genes in tandem duplication are arbitrarily defined as those occurring within a sequence distance of 50 kb. On the other hand, genes that are duplicated in the same chromosome but reside >50 kb from each other are referred to as ‘Duplications in same chromosome’. ‘Duplications in different chromosomes’ indicate pairs of highly homologous genes which reside on different chromosomes.2.4. Discovery of cis-regulatory motifs in promoter regions of TF genesTo discover cis-regulatory motifs located in the promoter regions of each putative soybean TF gene and to investigate the enriched representation of cis-motifs in each TF family, cis-motif sequences from the PLACE database (version 30, 469 entries) (http://www.dna.affrc.go.jp/PLACE/)44 and the stress responsive cis-motifs previously reported45 were used as queries to search against the Glyma1 genome scaffold sequence using the fuzznuc program of EMBOSS package (http://emboss.sourceforge.net/). The results of pattern matches were subsequently assessed to identify matched sequences located on the −500, −1000 and −3000 bp upstream sequences from the putative transcription start site for each TF encoding gene defined in the Glyma1 annotation. The cis-element search results were implemented into the SoybeanTFDB as a searchable property. In addition, these search results were also incorporated as an annotation track of the genome browser (Gbrowse).To assess the enrichment for the representative allocation of each cis-element identified on upstream sequences of each TF family, we analysed cis-element representations in the −1000 bp promoter region of TF members for TF families containing more than 50 gene loci to compare cis-element representations of randomly sampled gene loci of Glyma1. The computation of the overrepresentation test and its significance were performed by a Z-test as previously described.462.5. Construction of a web accessible databaseThe database is implemented in MySQL and the web interface of Perl CGI and Java script run on the Apache Web server. The definition strings used for sequence similarity searches for each database, the domain searches by InterProScan, cis-motif names from the PLACE database and the assigned GO terms have been assembled as a keyword database enabling users to specify queries on any keyword and to retrieve relevant information for genes from the SoybeanTFDB. A BLAST server was implemented to provide a similarity search interface for queried sequences using NCBI BLAST together with soybean Glyma1-related sequences, as well as those from Arabidopsis and rice. Generic Genome Browser (Gbrowse)47 was also implemented in SoybeanTFDB with Glyma1 genome annotations released by Phytozome to visualize the gene annotations of the putative TF encoding genes together with cis-motifs found on the upstream sequence of the TF genes. All of the data in the SoybeanTFDB are accessible not only through a web interface but also as downloadable files from the website. The cross references of corresponding data for each of the entries were also implemented into the SoybeanTFDB together with the URLs for each of the original referenced data to provide hyperlinks on the web interface with seamless navigations.3. Results and discussion3.1. Identification of the soybean TF repertoireFor the purpose of identifying the repertoire of TFs within the soybean genome, we first define a class of proteins which bind DNA in a sequence-specific fashion. A protein is classified as a TF if it has a significant match to a model that we annotated as being a DBD, with the significance thresholds for HMM matches. Supplementary Table S1 summarized the HMMs used in TF predictions. For each HMM, we examined the description and associated literature to assess their sequence-specific DNA-binding capabilities. The pipeline that we used to predict soybean TFs began with retrieving the complete set of predicted proteins from the completely sequenced soybean genome. This approach was then followed by a HMMER search with all HMMs taken from the Pfam database (Fig. 1). In total, 4342 putative TF encoding loci which showed a significant match with these selected DBDs were extracted from the soybean genome sequence Glyma1 model (http://www.phytozome.net/soybean#C). These putative TFs represent 6.56% of the total number of predicted genes in soybean (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S2). In soy, this percentage of TFs to total gene number was similar to what has been observed for Arabidopsis. In the Arabidopsis genome, there are at least 1968 TFs which account for 7.23% of the total number of genes. Although the number of TFs generally increase with the number of genes in a genome, interestingly the percentage of TF genes described in rice (3.68%) is less than expected (Table 1). The identified soybean TFs were classified into 61 families based on the presence of domains that were specific for the family (Table 2). Among the identified TFs, a significant proportion of the soybean TF repertoire has not been annotated with full-length open reading frames in the Glyma1 model. As a means to address this deficiency, we took advantage of our recently released soybean FL-cDNA collection of 4712 complete sequences and 68 661 ESTs to assess the Glyma1 annotation of the identified TFs (http://www.legumebase.agr.miyazaki-u.ac.jp).37 Table 2 summarized the full-length information of the soybean TF encoding genes annotated by Glyma1 and the FL-cDNA collection. Detailed information for each gene is available on Supplementary Table S2. Next, we then grouped the TFs into four categories according to our confidence in their structure and functionality by assessing PubMed and relevant databases as described in Materials and methods (Fig. 2, and Supplementary Table S3). Relevant information of the soybean TF repertoire can be easily accessed at our website SoybeanTFDB (http://soybeantfdb.psc.riken.jp). Information that is readily available for the TF repertoire includes nucleotide and amino acid sequences, promoter regions and domain alignments within the family as well as multiple alignments with putative Arabidopsis and homologous rice genes.Schematic workflow of the computational pipeline used to discover and annotate genes encoding putative transcription factors in soybean.Schematic workflow of the computational pipeline used to discover and annotate genes encoding putative transcription factors in soybean.The distributions of soybean TF encoding genes are classified into four categories of annotation levels.

In addition, although the Glyma1 model contains more than 98% of known soybean protein-coding genes in its assembly, part of the TF repertoire may be clarified in the future by fine-tuning of the annotation. Finally, our literature analysis depends on the existing available published information pertaining to each gene, which will need to be updated as new findings are reported. The availability of updated HMM libraries or refinements of existing ones and better fine-tuned annotation and continuous searches for newly reported literature will enable us to improve the TF prediction coverage. We will continue to update the website with new information when it becomes available.Literature analysis, which is achieved by assessing corresponding genes deposited as soybean TF genes in the GenBank core nucleotide division together with associated identifiers of PubMed, has revealed that the majority of soybean TFs remains experimentally uncharacterized. Thus, we attempted to further extend our current knowledge base regarding their regulatory function by assessing the putative functions of soybean TFs via comparative analyses with relevant GO annotations of Arabidopsis in TAIR. First, we analysed the profile of GO terms at the biological process level which could be assigned to soybean TFs based on sequence similarity searches against Arabidopsis counterparts having GO terms in TAIR. In order to grasp the overall representation of GO terms in applied entries of soybean TFs, all of the assigned terms were counted after the similarity searches were completed. With the exception of ‘regulation of transcription’, ‘DNA binding’ and ‘biological process’, the top 21 most abundant terms were subsequently used to classify the TFs. The contig results of these total 21 GO terms for each soybean TF, which was based on similarity with Arabidopsis TFs, are provided in Supplementary Table S4. Figure 3A illustrates the distribution of soybean TFs in the 21 most abundant GO terms. A significant proportion of soybean TFs are related to stress and hormone responses (Fig. 3B), indicating the important role of TFs in controlling these biological processes. Of these assigned regulatory functions, responses to auxin, chitin and salt stress are the most highly represented. It is acknowledged that these annotations are the first steps in functional prediction, and researchers must use original publications as a source for a higher level of detailed information. In addition, it is ideal if functional analyses can be performed in order to gain a detailed understanding of gene function. Overall, these analyses emphasize the limited amount of functional information that we know regarding the biological processes that most of the TFs mediate, even for model plants such as Arabidopsis. Directing research efforts into uncharacterized TFs—for example, using high-throughput genomic surveys to describe the key features combined with a detailed examination using traditional molecular approaches—will undoubtedly accelerate our functional understanding of these important regulatory genes. The NAC TF family, which is widely distributed in plants but so far has not been found in other eukaryotes, is an excellent example of how research interests can suddenly arise the following key findings. The acceleration in functional studies has revealed their diverse functions in different biological aspects and future follow-up studies will rapidly improve our understanding of the regulatory function of NAC members. A greater understanding of how TFs operate will be subsequently translated into their potential applications to enhance plant productivity.4,48,49The representative distributions of the GO terms for biological processes associated with soybean TF encoding genes.

Structural feature of TFsAs mentioned above, the most common classification of TFs is based on the structure of their DBD.7,14 Grouping TFs by their structural domains has been extremely useful in gaining insights into how they recognize and bind specific DNA sequence. This strategy has also been proven successfully for characterizing their evolutionary histories as well. Moreover, the DBD may provide clues to their biological function. For example, ABI3/VP1 TFs are often associated with the regulation of abscisic acid (ABA)-responsive genes during seed development.50Since structural features of TF families have been extensively characterized in other reports, we do not cover this in detail within this report.8 However, it is worthy to note that soybean contains a number of large families which consist of more than 100 members (Supplementary Table S5). For example, the large AP2_EREBP family alone contains 405 TF models and accounts for a total of 8.04% of the TF repertoire. The bHLH and (R1)R2R3_MYB TFs also represent major families with 390 and 333 members, respectively, which together occupy 14.36% of the TF repertoire. These observations agree with the previous studies in Arabidopsis and rice, which confirmed that the same three families contain the highest numbers of TFs in these model systems (Supplementary Table S5). In addition, the plant-specific NAC family, which comprises 205 models in soybean, represents a similar ratio in Arabidposis and rice (Supplementary Table S5). Taken together, these results suggest a similar tendency in the evolution of major TF families in plants. Furthermore, given that the size of TF families is influenced in part by the number of different DNA sequences that they are able to recognize, the DBDs of AP2_EREBP, bHLH and (R1)R2R3_MYB TF families may be able to diversify their collection of target sequences. As a result, they occur in the greater numbers in a genome.4,51,523.3. Chromosomal distribution and gene duplications of TFsOur analysis has indicated that the soybean TF families are scattered throughout the genome. The larger families, such as AP2_EREBP, (R1)R2R3_MYB, have members that are distributed on every chromosome in soybean (Supplementary Table S2). The local distribution of TF genes relative to each other is also of interest. Previous studies have described duplications and clusters of highly homologous genes. In Arabidopsis, tandem gene duplications and large-scale duplications on different chromosomes may account for >60% of the genome.7 In soybean, we were able to distinguish between two types of duplications and clusters based on the evolutionary history of the TF-coding genes that they contain. The first type of duplications and clusters consists of a series of paralogous genes, suggesting that they arose through repeated tandem duplications which originated from a founding locus. In contrast, the second type of duplications and clusters is not comprised paralogous genes. We anticipate that the TF-coding genes in these duplications and clusters arose independently of each other at diverse locations within the genome. Over time, it is likely that they relocated to form these duplications and clusters. Table 3 summarizes gene duplications and gene clusters in soybean TF families. Closely related genes, which are defined by >60% amino acid sequence identity, account for ∼77.75% of the total number in the TF families (Table 3). Pairs of duplicated genes on different chromosomes are most common and gene clusters of three or more highly related genes are also widely found (Table 3). On the basis of the distance of their occurrence, a few of the duplicated genes could be classified arbitrarily as either genes that were duplicated on same chromosome or genes that were tandemly duplicated. Evolutionary studies and haploid genome analysis have suggested that the soybean genome experienced a tetraploidization event which occurred an estimated 10–15 million years ago. Since then, the soybean genome has gone through extensive gene rearrangements and deletions to become diploidized.53 Therefore, we can observe in soybean that multigene families, including TF families, contain highly related genes.24,54Classification of homologous soybean TF genesaNumber of predicted TF loci found in soybean chromosomes (Glyma1 model).bGenes were considered closely homologs if they showed >60% amino acid sequence identity.cPairs of closely homologous genes which are duplicated in different chromosomes.dPairs of closely homologous genes which are duplicated in same chromosome but resided >50 kb apart from each other.ePairs of closely homologous genes which are duplicated in same chromosome but resided <50 kb apart from each other.fClusters of three or more closely homologous genes.Classification of homologous soybean TF genesaNumber of predicted TF loci found in soybean chromosomes (Glyma1 model).bGenes were considered closely homologs if they showed >60% amino acid sequence identity.cPairs of closely homologous genes which are duplicated in differen",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Promoter regions of the TFs and the discovery of cis-elements in the TF promoter regionsCis-regulatory elements, which are the binding sites for TFs located in the promoter regions of genes, are the functional elements that determine the timing and location of transcriptional activity. Over the years, extensive promoter analyses have identified a large number of cis-elements, which are important molecular switches involved in the transcriptional regulation of a dynamic network of gene activities controlling various biological processes such as abiotic stress responses, hormone responses and developmental processes.45,55 The PLACE database (http://www.dna.affrc.go.jp/PLACE/) has consolidated all of the published cis-motifs that have been identified to date. In addition, a number of stress responsive cis-motifs are also reported, which are of great interest to our area of research.45 To facilitate the functional characterization of soybean TFs, we retrieved the promoter regions for all of the TF genes from soybean genomic sequence database. Specifically, we retrieved 500, 1000 and 3000 bp of sequence upstream from putative transcription start sites. We provided this data on our website in addition to other relevant information on the TFs for convenient downloading. The −500, −1000 and −3000 bp promoter regions were subjected to an extensive in silico analyses to search for the existence of all putative known cis-regulatory motifs. In addition, we also analysed the enrichment of all of the cis-motifs in each TF family using −1000 bp promoter regions as described in Materials and methods. Information on the cis-elements located in the promoter region of each TF is accessible on the detailed page of each TF gene under ‘cis-motif prediction’ function (Fig. 4C). In addition, our website provides the ‘cis-motif (PLACE)’ search function, which enables the search for all types of cis-motifs provided by the PLACE database in promoter region of any TF and/or the search for those TFs which contains the cis-motif(s) of interest (Fig. 4A). In combination with GO annotations (Fig. 4H), these data can facilitate the systematic functional predictions of soybean TFs.The web-based user interface of SoybeanTFDB and a demonstration of a typical example of related annotations for a putative soybean TF encoding gene.

Additionally, quantitative models that describe how combinations of cis-elements dictate changes in expression will play an important role for enriching our understanding of the transcriptional response of individual genes to environmental perturbations.263.5. Cis-element- and comparative sequence analysis-based prediction of abiotic stress responsive TFs in soybeanPlants respond to environmental changes by altering large-scale transcriptional responses. The exquisite sensitivity and specificity of these responses are controlled in large part by the cis-regulatory elements. The molecular mechanisms regulating gene expression in response to abiotic stresses have been studied by analysing the cis- and trans-acting elements, i.e. the sequence-specific binding TFs.4,45Genes induced by stresses are classified into two groups: functional genes and regulatory genes. The regulatory group includes genes encoding various TFs which can regulate various stress-inducible genes cooperatively or separately and may constitute gene networks. Identification and functional analysis of these stress-inducible TFs should provide more information on the complex regulatory gene networks that are involved in stress responses. At the present time, the functions for most of stress responsive TF encoding genes are not fully understood. Some of the stress-inducible TFs have been overexpressed in transgenic plants and result in stress-tolerant phenotypes.4,45,49Recent studies have substantiated that sequence similarity-based clustering of the members of several TF families correlates with their function. Phylogenetic analysis of the AP2_EREBP and NAC families of soybean and the rice NAC family with orthologs from other plant species whose stress responsive expression pattern and/or function are known, resulted in a nearly perfect match between sequence conservation and function or expression patterns. These similarities clearly demonstrate that this can serve as a reliable approach to rationalize systematic functional predictions of different TF families.21,24,54 Moreover, increasing evidence indicates that the cis-motifs are highly conserved among orthologous or paralogous genes and coregulated genes and defined cis-elements can effectively aid in the genome-wide screening of ABA and abiotic stress responsive genes.57–59 These observations together prompted us to investigate in a comprehensive fashion the relationship between TFs and abiotic stress with the integration of cis-element annotation and comparative sequence analysis using stress responsive GO terms which aimed to identifying soybean TFs which may function in abiotic stress response. We, therefore, carried out comparative sequence analysis with stress-responsive Arabidopsis TFs to predict the soybean TFs with stress responsive GO terms (Fig. 3B). We also characterized information on stress-responsive cis-element distributions in promoter regions of each soybean TF gene on our webpage for querying and searching for putative stress responsive TFs in each family using ‘cis-motif (stress responsive)’ search function. With the help of our soybean TF database, we can use, for example, the ‘cis-motif (stress responsive)’ search function to identify TF genes which harbour major known stress responsive cis-motif(s) in their promoter regions (Fig. 4A). Next, we screen the identified TFs using GO annotation provided for each TF on detailed annotation page (Fig. 4H). Thus, we will be able to identify the putative stress responsive TFs based on both the existence of stress responsive cis-motif(s) and the associated stress responsive GO terms. The predicted stress responsive function of the identified TFs shall be then confirmed by experiments. The existence of major stress responsive cis-motifs enriched in −1000 bp promoter regions for a number of TF families was summarized in Table 4.Enriched cis-regulatory motifs found in promoter region (1000 bp upstream from transcription start site of each gene) of genes encoding each of the TF familiesaAccording to Yamaguchi-Shinozaki et al.45bThe mean values observed were calculated by counting motif pattern hit in 1000 random samplings in each 1000 trials for promoter pools of each TFs.cThe mean values expected were calculated by counting motif patterns hit in 1000 random samplings in each 1000 trials for promoter pools of all genes annotated in soybean genome.Enriched cis-regulatory motifs found in promoter region (1000 bp upstream from transcription start site of each gene) of genes encoding each of the TF familiesaAccording to Yamaguchi-Shinozaki et al.45bThe mean values observed were calculated by counting motif pattern hit in 1000 random samplings in each 1000 trials for promoter pools of each TFs.cThe mean values expected were calculated by counting motif patterns hit in 1000 random samplings in each 1000 trials for promoter pools of all genes annotated in soybean genome.3.6. RIKEN soybean TF databaseWe constructed a TF database named SoybeanTFDB which is based on the identified soybean TF repertoire. Access to our database is available via the following link: http://soybeantfdb.psc.riken.jp, and all of the data described above are available for viewing and immediate downloading. The scientific community can browse predictions for a total of 5035 TF models and receive classifications for submitted nucleotide and protein sequences. Multiple alignments of amino acid sequences within TF families are also available for downloading and can be used for the construction of phylogenetic trees. We also provided clustered results showing amino acid similarity with different levels of amino acid identity (30, 60 and 90%), search functions for functional motif information of InterProScan, cis-motifs in promoter regions of TFs and GO annotations. Furthermore, cross-references and links to other databases such as Arabidopsis TAIR8, TIGR rice, UniProt, SoyBase, soybean FL-cDNA and other TF databases such as AtTFDB, DATF, RARTF, DRTF, Grassius, PlnTFDB are available. On the first page of SoybeanTFDB, we provide four types of search keywords to find an entry: ‘TF search’, ‘Similarity search’, ‘Genome browser’ and ‘Quick search’. Similarity search allows search using either nucleotide or amino acid sequence of any TF gene. Genome browser enables search using gene IDs and Quick search allows search function via any essential keywords such as ‘NAC’. Within the TF search keyword, we provide seven search functions (Fig. 4A). Figure 4 illustrates the web-based user interface of SoybeanTFDB with a detailed description. One can easily carry out functionality predictions for any TF of interest based on GO annotations and cis-motif search results. For instance, putative abiotic stress responsive TFs can be searched based on the existence of stress responsive cis-motifs and GO annotations. Thus, the database that we have developed consolidates comprehensive information for all of the members of soybean TF repertoire. This database is a very user-friendly interface which aims to meet the broad demands of researchers who strive to perform research with soybean TFs with the goal of gaining greater understanding of their putative roles in plant development, differentiation and environmental responses. Taken together, SoybeanTFDB will serve as an in silico analysis-based basic platform for the elucidation of regulatory mechanisms underlying different developmental and physiological processes and stress responses. We strongly feel that this database will rapidly accelerate the progress in ‘transcription factoromics’ of soybean, comparative genomics of TF repertoires both within legume species and between legumes and other species, as well as facilitate genetic engineering programs to improve the productivity of soybean grown in adverse conditions.Supplementary dataSupplementary Data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingFunding support from Grants-in-Aid (Start-up) for Scientific Research, Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science," and Technology of Japan (No. 21870046) is gratefully appreciated.The soybean sequence data were produced by the US Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute http://www.jgi.doe.g.ov/ in collaboration with the scientific user community.Supplementary data""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IntroductionOne of the most interesting findings revealed by the Human Genome Project is that the human genome contains only 20 000–25 000 protein-coding genes.1 This number is unexpectedly too small. To explain this unexpected result and to understand functions of genes, it is necessary to analyze mRNA diversity.Biologically, multiple transcripts can be generated from a single gene by alternative splicing (AS). According to several reports on genome research, AS occurs in 30–60% of human genes.2–5 It has been reported that AS of a single gene could produce transcripts coding for multiple proteins, each exhibiting different biochemical properties including binding, intracellular localization and regulation of enzymatic activities.6 AS is also of interest to the pharmaceutical research because unwanted AS of genes could lead to various genetic diseases and cancers.7 We have particularly focused on the analysis of AS patterns that are produce by utilizing alternative transcription start sites (TSSs). Indeed, multiple transcripts were produced from a gene by utilizing variable TSSs.8,9 For example, the Pcdh gene, which contained variable TSSs, was shown to produce different transcripts;10 similarly, UGTs (UDP-glucuronosyltransferases), which contained more than 10 TSSs.11 From these findings, it is clear that to elucidate gene function, we have to further our knowledge on and understanding of all transcripts made from each gene, particularly those of the protein-coding transcripts. However, identification of all protein-coding transcripts have so far been difficult due to the fact that a large number of EST data accumulated in the databases are 3'-EST data, which were obtained by sequencing cDNAs from the polyA-end. Thus, even though sequences of a large number of mRNAs are already known, our understanding of these mRNAs remained incomplete because of the fragmentary nature and 3′-end bias of their sequences. Because of the lack of sequence information, it has been difficult to predict TSSs and to identify all the open reading frame (ORF) regions. Although the use of next generation sequencer helped in making advances in analyzing TSSs, it still remains extremely difficult to evaluate diversities of mRNAs transcribed by each gene because of their accumulation of short-length sequences (less than 50 bases) of cDNA clones.12,13We sequenced ∼55 000 human full-length cDNAs, including 11 769 newly identified cDNAs described in this paper, and also obtained ∼1.45 million 5'-end-one-pass sequences (5'-EST).14–17 We believe that these cDNA sequences are very useful in analyzing the diversity of protein-coding transcripts and would definitely contribute to our understanding of mRNA. First, our cDNA clones were isolated from full-length human cDNA libraries constructed by an optimized oligo-capping method, and therefore by utilizing their sequence information, we were able to identify the TSS with 90% or better accuracy.14,18–20 Thus, we could easily and accurately identify TSSs of even low-expressing genes, for which up until now it required comparison of a large amount of data.17 Second, our 5′-EST data contained, on the average, sequence information of ∼500 bases/cDNA clone, which covered two or more exons. Since the average length of the 5'-untranslated region is believed to be 125 bases,21 it was possible to predict ORF regions using our 5'-EST data. Finally, the most important point is that all of our resources were obtained from the full-length cDNAs, including the TSS and the polyA site. Moreover, we could obtain various findings on protein expression from our full-length cDNAs.16 These findings could not be obtained from sequences of short mRNA fragments. Since AS of genes could potentially create a large number of protein-coding transcripts, analyzing full-length cDNAs might be immensely valuable in understanding gene function.Here, we report on our analysis of 11 769 full-length cDNAs, which were identified from our full-length cDNA libraries, and contained ORFs as a result of AS. We also present our analysis on the splice patterns and expression profiles of the identified cDNAs to explore the correlation between the mRNA diversity and gene function. Furthermore, we describe 261 full-length cDNAs with unique TSSs known as multiple variable first exon (FEV) and report on their expression profiles. Finally, we report establishing the FLJ Human cDNA Database based on the results of our analysis of the variable protein-coding transcripts generated from each gene by AS.2. Materials and methods2.1. Construction of full-length cDNA librariesMost total RNAs isolated from various tissues and cells were purchased from Clontech and Ambion. Cells were cultured following established protocol, and cytoplasmic total RNAs were extracted from these cultured cells following a standard RNA purification method. The list of total RNAs used in this study was shown in Supplementary Table S1. We constructed cDNA libraries from total RNAs by an optimized oligo-capping method (detailed method for the optimized oligo-capping is provided in the Supplementary Method 1).18,19 Briefly, total RNAs were treated with bacteria alkaline phosphatase (TaKaRa) and tobacco acid pyrophosphatase. After that, total RNAs were ligated to the oligo-RNA using the RNA ligase (TaKaRa). Oligo-capped polyA(+) RNAs were then isolated oligo-dT columns. The first-strand cDNAs were synthesized using the Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), the synthesized cDNAs were amplified using the Gene Amp XL PCR kit (ABI) and the amplified product was digested with the restriction enzyme SfiI. Fragments longer than 2 kb were selected and purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and cloned into the DraIII-digested pME18SFL3 vector following the standard methods. The 5′-end-one-pass sequences of cloned cDNAs were analyzed using the ABI 377 and 3700 sequencers (ABI). The 5'-end fullness rate of the constructed oligo-capped cDNA libraries was evaluated as described previously,22,23 and the detailed method for determining the 5'-end fullness rate is provided in the Supplementary Method 2.2.2. Genome mapping and clusteringThe 5′- and 3′-ends of cDNA sequences and the full-length cDNA sequences (Supplementary Table S2) were mapped onto the human genome (UCSC hg 18 NCBI Build 36.1). Possible local alignments between the cDNAs and genome sequences were identified by using the NCBI Mega BLAST program (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/). For each cDNA, best mapping of the sequence was determined from these local alignments using a dynamic programming technique that optimized the identity, coverage and topology of exons. The joining portions of consecutive local alignments were refined so as to restore the consensus sequence in the canonical splice sites. On the basis of the mapping results clustering of cDNA sequences were performed as follows: two cDNA sequences were grouped into the same cluster if their mapped positions shared at least one base on the genome. In general, each cluster corresponded to a single gene locus.2.3. Identification of alternatively spliced variants of mRNAsOn the basis of the results of genome mapping and clustering analysis, ESTs that had different regions compared with known full-length cDNAs by AS were selected by Intris, a viewer for cDNA-genome alignments used for analysis of splicing variants and expression profiles.24 To exclude the cDNA fragments derived from the immature mRNA and genomic DNA, reliability of mRNA was evaluated by using not only the human EST data but also the data conserved from other animals (Phastcons; obtained from UCSC Genome Browser). We predicted the ORF regions from the 5'-end sequences of full-length cDNAs on selected ESTs by using ATGpr (http://flj.lifesciencedb.jp/top/).25 Next, we excluded those ESTs from the selected analytical targets when the predicted ORF regions of the selected ESTs were the same as the ORF regions of known full-length cDNAs. In addition, even if the predicted ORF regions were different from the ORF regions of known full-length cDNAs, we excluded cDNA clones containing extremely short ORF regions (mostly 60 amino acids or less) compared with the other full-length cDNAs that mapped in the same locus of the human genome. The selected cDNAs were further sequenced by primer walking method using an ABI3700 sequencer (ABI) to obtain information on 500 additional bases, and the ORF regions were predicted again by using the ATGpr.25 We also evaluated the predicted ORF regions by using TRis,26 translated region inspector, and examined their novelty of amino acid sequences by using ALVISION,27 aligns two cDNA sequences that are splicing variants allowing large gaps. When the reliability of the predicted ORF region was insufficient, we excluded it from our list of analytical targets. When the predicted ORF regions of the selected cDNAs were judged reliable and different from those of the known full-length cDNAs, we then sequenced the full-length cDNA clone all the way up to the stop codon. Consequently, we completely sequenced 11 769 of full-length FLJ cDNAs and analyzed their tissue-specific expression. A detailed method for the analysis of the tissue-specific expression of the cDNAs is provided in the Supplementary Method 3. We have also constructed the FLJ Human cDNA Database (http://flj.lifesciencedb.jp) that contained these sequence information. A detailed method for the analysis of AS by using the information available in the FLJ Human cDNA Database is provided in the Supplementary Method 4. Sequences of 11 769 of our full-length cDNAs were also deposited in the DDBJ/GenBank/EMBL databases (AK293122–AK304890).2.4. Functional analysis of full-length cDNAs in silicoSequences of cDNAs were analyzed for the signal sequences, trans-membrane domains and motifs in the encoded proteins by using Signal P ver. 3.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/), SOSUI ver. 1.5 (Mitsui Knowledge Industry) and Pfam 19.0 (November 2005; http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/), respectively. We obtained information on motifs showing E-values of e-30 or more from the Pfam analysis, and based on these results, we then categorized each cDNA and the corresponding gene according to its gene ontology (GO) (http://www.geneontology.org/) classification by using InterPro (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/).2.5. Quantitative real-time PCR analysisTotal RNAs derived from various tissues were purchased from Clontech, Ambion and STRATAGENE (listed in Supplementary Table S4). From 10 µg of each total RNA, first-strand cDNAs were synthesized using random primers and the Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Real-time PCR was performed using TaqMan Universal Master Mix (ABI) or SYBR Master Mix (ABI) on an ABI Fast7500 System (ABI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Approximately 300 ng of template cDNAs was used in each PCR reaction. Probes and primers were designed using the Primer Express3.0 (ABI) (refer to Supplementary Table S5 for the list of primers). The expression levels of genes were normalized with respect to that of the human GAPDH, and expression values of individual genes were calculated by comparing their Ct values to that of the control using the RQ software (ABI). The expression levels of genes were represented in log10 base. Samples were run in duplicates and the data shown are the average of two experiments.3. Results and discussion3.1. Identification of human genesIt is known that AS could produce mRNA diversity.2–6 However, to analyze the mRNA diversity, it is necessary to identify human genes (i.e. the genome loci from where the protein-coding mRNAs are transcribed). We obtained 1.45 million human full-length cDNAs and sequenced their 5'-ends. We previously selected ∼30 000 cDNAs from these full-length cDNAs based on the novelty analysis, and completely sequenced them.14–16 Later, we also selected ∼25 000 cDNAs based on the mRNA diversity and also sequenced them completely. In our quest to identify human genes, we used, for our analysis, the sequence information on these 55 000 full-length human cDNAs including 11 769 cDNAs reported in this paper (Supplementary Table S2). Furthermore, for the analysis, we not only used our own data but also data from 52 000 full-length human cDNA sequences available from the public databases, 30 000 human RefSeq (NCBI Reference Sequences; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/RefSeq/) and 48 000 Ensembl, human gene transcripts (http://www.ensembl.org/index.html). In addition, we used EST sequences obtained by us and from other public databases (Supplementary Table S2). All the sequence data we collected were mapped onto the human genome and clustered. We then examined reliability of each full-length cDNAs by Intris24 using sequences of all full-length cDNAs and ESTs mapped on the same locus of the genome, and based on this analysis, we selected only the reliable cDNAs for the gene identification analysis. We determined the genome locus of each one of the selected reliable cDNA and manually checked them one by one to identify the corresponding gene. As a result, we identified 23 241 human genes from this analysis (Fig. 1A). Each gene cluster was classified into three categories based on the reliability scores. The number of genes in the high reliability category (high category) were 16 754. Sequences of cDNAs belonging to the high-category group were found to be already analyzed because the genome locus was covered by sequence information available from the three types of databases, the human full-length cDNAs, RefSeq and Ensembl. It accounted for 72% of the total number of genes. The number of genes with intermediate reliability (medium category) was 2854. As for the medium-category group, the genome locus was covered by sequence information available from only the human full-length cDNAs or from two out of three of the above-mentioned databases. The number of genes with low reliability (low category) were 3633. As for the low-category group, the gene locus was covered by sequence information available only from the RefSeq or the Ensembl.Clustering of human cDNA sequences.

Results of reliability analysis according to the category based on the cover rates of 1.45 million of ESTs (B) and 55 000 full-length cDNAs (C).To further assess these reliabilities, we next calculated the cover rate of genes using our cDNAs. First, the cover rate was calculated using our 1.45 million FLJ ESTs, and we found a positive correlation between these reliabilities and the cover rate of FLJ ESTs (Fig. 1B). Next, we calculated the cover rate of genes using our 55 000 FLJ human full-length cDNA sequences. In this case, we also found a positive correlation between the reliability and the cover rate similar to that was observed for the ESTs (Fig. 1C). Thus, we were able to verify reliability irrespective of whether we used the sequences of our ESTs or full-length cDNAs in the analysis.3.2. Analysis of AS and functional classification of sequenced full-length cDNAs by GOWe selected 25 000 full-length cDNAs from among the identified genes by focusing our attention on AS and subsequently sequenced them. In addition, from these cDNAs, we selected 11 769 of human full-length cDNAs in which the ORF regions were predicted to be different from the known full-length cDNAs, and then classified them by GO according to their predicted functions. First, ESTs exhibiting a different splicing pattern than the known full-length cDNAs were selected and were completely sequenced. From the sequence analysis, we were able to predict the ORF regions in only 30% of them (results not shown). Interestingly, a number of cDNA, for which we were unable to predict the ORF region, were thought to produced by AS. But, because our target was to be able to predict the function of the gene from the sequence of its transcript, it was necessary to select protein-coding transcripts efficiently. It is difficult to predict the ORF region correctly from the EST sequences lacking the TSS. However, our 5'-EST sequences not only contained the TSS but also contained sequence information on an average of 500 bases from the TSS. Therefore, we were able to correctly predict the ORF regions of our 5'-EST by using ATGpr.25 As a result, the number of clones containing unpredictable ORF regions decreased to ∼10%. Moreover, by using the tools such as TRins26 for inspecting the translated region and ALVISION27 for evaluating the novelty of amino acid sequences, we succeeded in identifying the ORF regions with high accuracy. Consequently, we obtained 11 769 of human full-length cDNAs in which the ORF regions were predicted to be different from the known full-length cDNAs (Supplementary Table S3). Ninety-six percent of these cDNAs-encoded proteins which differed in at least 10 amino acids from those encoded by their respective known full-length cDNAs, mainly because we selected them based on their altered ORF regions as a result of AS. These full-length cDNAs covered 7025 of 23 241 genes that we had originally identified.Once it was established that human genes could produce multiple protein-coding transcripts, it was important to analyze their putative functions. The GO classification analysis was performed for all 11 769 our full-length cDNAs using Pfam, and their predicted functions, obtained from this analysis, are summarized in Table 1. The classification results revealed that a large number of our cDNA clones were listed under the GO molecular function categories ‘nucleotide binding’, ‘nucleic acid binding’, ‘protein binding’, ‘hydrolase activity’, ‘transferase activity’ and ‘oxidoreductase activity’. Because 11 769 of our full-length cDNAs had ORF regions different from those of the known full-length cDNAs, we also analyzed their functions by predicting domains and motifs using Pfam, SOSUI and SignalP (Supplementary Table S3). Consequently, we discovered full-length cDNAs that encoded proteins with altered functional domains and signal sequences as a result of AS.Functional classification of the 11 769 full-length cDNAs based on the molecular function hierarchy of GOIf a protein was predicted to belong to two or more categories, all categories were included for counting.Functional classification of the 11 769 full-length cDNAs based on the molecular function hierarchy of GOIf a protein was predicted to belong to two or more categories, all categories were included for counting.3.3. Classification of splicing patterns of full-length cDNAsUp until now, majority of the ESTs entered in the public databases were 3'-EST. We succeeded in constructing full-length cDNA libraries efficiently by using the optimized oligo-capping method and obtained ∼1.4 million 5'-ESTs of full-length cDNAs constructed by this method.18,19 Our 5'-EST sequences were especially useful for the analysis of TSSs because 90% or more of our cDNAs contained the TSSs. We analyzed the splicing patterns of the 11 769 cDNAs by using the 5'-EST sequence data (Fig. 2). Results of this analysis revealed that 3403 cDNAs, which correspond to ∼30% of all cDNAs, were transcribed using alternative TSSs (Type A), and thus, the predicted proteins contained new amino acid sequences at their N-terminal ends. In addition, 1962 cDNAs in Type A (designated as Type A1) contained FEV, due to transcripts originating from a TSS that was previously ignored because it was mapped in an intron region of the genome or transcripts originating from a TSS that was mapped upstream from the one that was analyzed before. Taken together, these results led to the discovery of new exons. We analyzed expression profiles of the genes containing multiple TSSs and discovered that the same gene could code for proteins with diverse function in different tissues by the proper utilization of alternative TSS. There were 8277 cDNAs (i.e. ∼70% of all the full-length cDNAs) that were transcribed from the previously identified TSSs, but contained different ORF region because of AS; they were designated as Type B. Because we used our 5'-EST data for the selection, a lot of Type B cDNAs were predicted to contain N-terminal sequences different from those of the known cDNAs, except for a portion of cDNAs which were either selected by PCR or found during sequencing analysis. To assess whether AS or use of alternative TSS could alter the function of the predicted protein, we compared the GO functional categories of the Type A and Type B (Table 2). Our results showed that majority of the Type A belonged mainly to the GO molecular function categories of ‘neurotransmitter binding’, ‘enzyme activator activity’, ‘cyclase activity’, ‘ATPase activity, coupled to movement of substances’ and ‘GTPase regulator activity’. Thus, by using our 5'-EST data, a lot of valuable information were obtained regarding the diversity of TSS and amino acid sequences at the N-terminal ends of proteins. However, since only a portion of the full-length cDNAs was selected for this analysis, information on sequence diversity in regions beyond 500 bases from the TSSs were not obtained. We believe that there are additional alternately spliced transcripts which remained to be analyzed in the future studies.Classifications of the 11 769 full-length cDNAs based on splicing patterns. The 11 769 human full-length cDNAs were classified according to their TSS utilization. Type A: these cDNAs were derived from transcripts which were generated utilizing a TSS different than the previously analyzed TSS of the gene. Type A1: cDNAs contained a sequence variation known as FEV. Type A2: this class of cDNAs did not have the FEV feature. Type B: these cDNAs were derived from transcripts that were generated utilizing the same TSS as the previously analyzed TSS, but were found to be alternatively spliced. We could not classify 89 cDNAs because they coded for newly identified proteins.Classifications of the 11 769 full-length cDNAs based on splicing patterns.

Total is all the results of classification in the category of molecular function. If a protein was predicted to belong to two or more categories, all categories were included for counting.*Functional categories biased to Type A.Functional classification of two types of splicing patterns of 11 769 full-length cDNAs based on GO category analysisThe ratio of Type A and Type B is 3:7 as shown by total.

Analysis of genes showing tissue-specific expressionWe analyzed expression of genes producing multiple protein-coding transcripts by AS and found that many of these transcripts were expressed in specific tissues or cells, suggesting that the genes likely use this diversity according to the need and situation. We next analyzed expression profiles of 10 069 cDNAs, which corresponded to 5542 genes, out of 11 769 full-length cDNAs we identified in this study. As our cDNA libraries were constructed using RNAs derived from more than 100 different types of tissues and cells, we therefore used the 5′-EST data for analyzing gene expression. We next analyzed gene expression profiles of Type A1 cDNAs containing the FEV diversity and found that the FEVs of 261 cDNAs, which correspond to 155 genes, showed specific expression patterns that were different from those already obtained for the genes with alternative TSSs (Table 3). Thus, like the genes with alternative TSSs, the expression patterns of the genes with FEVs likely depended on the tissue and condition. Consequently, we found genes producing multiple protein-coding transcripts by AS.Expressions of a selected list of 261 FEV-containing cDNAs (155 genes)We analyzed expression profiles of the first exons of ∼1.5 million 5'-ESTs constructed by the oligo-capping method. From this analysis, we selected 261 full-length cDNAs based on the expression levels of their FEVs in specific tissues. Expression levels of cDNAs indicated without any label and with a ‘↓’ label were high and low, respectively, in the respective tissues.*NT: NT2 cell induced by retinoic acid; FB, fetal brain; Im, immune tissues; Tu, tumor tissues; pre, precursor; unknown, function unknown.Expressions of a selected list of 261 FEV-containing cDNAs (155 genes)We analyzed expression profiles of the first exons of ∼1.5 million 5'-ESTs constructed by the oligo-capping method.

Analysis of expression patterns of tissue-specific expressed genesWe quantified tissue-specific expressions of 13 out of 261 selected cDNAs by real-time PCR (Fig. 3). Results of our analysis especially suggested that there was a strong relationship between the tissue-specific expression and diversity of gene function or disease. We compared the expression profile of a specific gene by utilizing the TSS identified in this study with that of the same gene in which a previously identified TSS was utilized for expression. These results are summarized in Supplementary Table S6 and are discussed below in more detail.Quantitative evaluation of selected genes by real-time PCR. Expression levels of the first exon regions of the selected genes were analyzed by real-time PCR. The data were normalized with respect to that of the human GAPDH as described in the Materials and methods section. The expression levels of genes were represented in log10 base. Expression levels of cDNAs labeled ‘$$’ represent the very low expression level or undetected. (A) FGF13, (B) OXR1, (C) C6orf142, (D) PLD5, (E) FGD4, (F) C6orf32.

The TSSs we found in each one of them were located upstream from the TSS of FGF13. Whereas the known TSS of FGF13 was expressed highly in both fetal and adult brains, the TSSs of both FLJ57884 and FLJ57068 cDNAs were highly expressed only in the fetal brain. Moreover, the TSS of our FLJ57068 cDNA was also expressed highly in the kidney cancer (Fig. 3A). Second example, OXR1 is one of the oxidation stress receptivity genes localized in mitochondria.30 The TSS of known OXR1 was expressed at equal levels in various tissues. But the TSS we identified in the FLJ56044 cDNA was located upstream from the known TSS of OXR1 and was highly expressed in brain, kidney cancer and lung cancer (Fig. 3B). Thus, these results suggested that these two genes were using different TSSs to regulate their expression levels in the brain. Moreover, our results also suggest that, for both genes, only one of the TSSs was preferentially recognized by the transcription machinery in the cancerous tissue.Third example, C6orf142 (chromosome 6 ORF 142) is a gene of an unknown function. The known TSS of C6orf142 was highly expressed in the heart. However, the TSS we identified in the FLJ58494 cDNA, which was located downstream from the previously identified TSS of C6orf142, was highly expressed in both fetal and adult brains (Fig. 3C). Fourth example, PLD5 is one of the phospholipid-splitting enzymes presumably involved in the intracellular signaling.31 Although the known TSS of PLD5 was expressed equally in various tissues, the TSS we identified in the FLJ57051 cDNA, which was located downstream of the previously identified TSS of PLD5, was highly expressed in the brain (Fig. 3D). Fifth example, SPRED2 is a Ras inhibitory factor belonging to the Sprouty/Spred family.32 The TSS we identified in the FLJ52731 cDNA, which was located downstream from the known TSS of SPRED2, was expressed highly in the brain (Supplementary Table S6). Sixth example, SEMA5B is a nerve guidance factor which is involved in organogenesis, angiogenesis and oncogenesis.33 The TSS we identified in the FLJ55460 cDNA, which was located downstream from the known TSS of SEMA5B, also was expressed highly in the brain (Supplem",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ntary Table S6). Seventh example, CACNB3 is a calcium channel beta-3 subunit, which is involved in modifying sympathetic nervous system, olfaction and control of blood pressure.34 Although the known TSS of CACNB3 was expressed highly in both fetal and adult brains, the newly identified TSSs of FLJ58949 and FLJ58411 cDNAs, both of which were located downstream from the known TSS of CACNB3, were expressed at a low level in the brain (Supplementary Table S6). These cDNAs exhibited different ORF regions as a result of AS. Eighth example, BACE1 is a peptide hydrolase that cleaves the amyloid precursor protein and is one of the factors involved in Alzheimer's disease.35 The known TSS of BACE1 was expressed equally in various tissues. However, the TSS we identified in the FLJ54690 cDNA, which was located downstream from the known TSS of BACE1, was expressed highly in the brain (Supplementary Table S6). Thus, these six genes regulated their expression levels in the brain using a specific TSS in each gene.Ninth example, FGD4 is a gene that seemed to be involved in the regulation of the actin in the cytoskeleton and cell shape and also have various roles in proliferation, differentiation, transcriptional regulation and development.36 The known TSS of FGD4 was highly expressed in the nervous system tissues such as brain, spinal cord and testis. However, the TSS we identified in the FLJ55905 cDNA, which was located downstream from the known TSS of FGD4, was highly expressed in the immune system tissues such as bone marrow and spleen (Fig. 3E). Tenth example, C6orf32 is a gene of unknown function whose expression level increased during the myoblast differentiation of the embryo.37 FLJ56038 and FLJ56137 cDNAs exhibited different ORF regions as a result of FEV and were splicing variants of the known C6orf32 cDNA. The known TSS of C6orf32 was expressed at equal levels in various tissues. However, the TSSs we found in FLJ56038 and FLJ56137 cDNAs were located upstream of the known TSS of C6orf32, and both of these newly identified TSSs were highly expressed in the immune system tissues such as bone marrow, spleen and thymus (Fig. 3F). Eleventh example, PTPN4 is a gene belonging to the PTP (tyrosine escape phosphoric acid enzyme) family that works as a transmitter and controls various cellular processes like cell proliferation, differentiation, mitotic cycle and oncogenesis.38 The known TSS of PTPN4 was highly expressed in the brain, but the TSS we identified in the FLJ53929 cDNA, which was located downstream from the known TSS of TPN4, was highly expressed in the immune system tissues such as bone marrow and spleen (Supplementary Table S6). Twelfth example, BTNL8 is one of the butyrophilin-like proteins and seemed to be involved in conferring immunity.39 The known TSS of BTNL8 was found to be expressed at equal levels in various tissues. However, the TSS we identified in the FLJ51528 cDNA, which was located downstream from the known TSS of BTNL8, was highly expressed in the lung and thymus (Supplementary Table S6). Thus, it seems that these four genes regulated their expression levels in the immune system tissues by using specific TSSs.Thirteenth example, AKT1 is a gene involved in apoptosis and neuronal differentiation and also may have a role in schizophrenia, especially in the neurotransmission system.40 The TSS we identified in the FLJ53606 cDNA, which was located downstream from the known TSS of AKT, was highly expressed in the retinoic acid-induced NT2 cells (Supplementary Table S6). Thus, this gene uses a specific TSS during the neuronal differentiation.Thus, among the newly identified genes we have analyzed in this study, the TSSs of a number of these genes revealed specific expression patterns. These results suggest that a single gene could use alternative TSS for tissue-specific transcription. We also found a close relationship between the predicted function of a gene and its tissue-specific expression. Thus, our results suggest a strong correlation between the mRNA diversity and function of a gene.3.6. Construction and use of the FLJ Human cDNA DatabaseWe constructed the FLJ Human cDNA Database ver. 3.0 (http://flj.lifesciencedb.jp) based on the results of our analysis of variable protein-coding transcripts produced from a gene by AS. A detailed description of our DB is available at the DB website. The DB graphically displays mapping of all the full-length cDNAs in the human genome and their ORF regions and thus provides a lot of useful information on the mRNA diversity. Moreover, the DB not only contain sequence information on full-length human cDNAs but also contain sequence information on a huge number of human ESTs generated using the oligo-capping method, allowing us to obtain useful information on ESTs mapped on the same genome locus. Because the average length of our EST sequences was ∼500 bases, the diversity of mRNAs produced as a result of AS could be efficiently analyzed by using this information. Because we were able to accurately identify TSSs using our 5′-EST data, we believe that they could be used to understand the relationship between the variable utilization of TSSs and biological functions of genes. Moreover, one could analyze the expression profiles of the transcriptional region of genes using the data from our high accuracy 5′-EST sequences, although in some cases the results might be different from those obtained using the 3′-EST data.Despite these useful features, our database specializes on 5′-end sequences, and therefore these data are not suitable for predicting AS in the C-terminal end. Then, a lot of AS-related information still remain to be extracted from our 1.4 million cDNA resources as all of them were not sequenced to completion. Because our cDNA resources are mostly full-length cDNAs including the TSS and the polyA site, complete sequencing of these cDNA clones will add to our understanding of the mRNA diversity. In addition, every full-length sequenced FLJ cDNAs is available from the National Institute of Technology and Evaluation (http://www.nite.go.jp/). We will continue to add new information on our resources to our database, and these resources will be very useful in the analysis of gene functions.Because our interest was on the mRNAs with ORF regions different from those of already known mRNAs, we stopped sequencing the cDNA once we found that the predicted ORF region of the transcript was not different from the known mRNA (for instance, where the alternative TSS only existed in the 5′-untranslated region). We, however, found that there is a tissue specificity in the expression patterns of these genes where the variation in TSS existed in the 5′-untranslated region (results not shown). Collectively, these results suggest that depending on the situation and environment, the transcription machinery utilizes alternative TSS to regulate the expression of a transcript, even when the translated protein is same. These results are also included in our DB. We also did not complete sequencing the clones for which we were unable to predict the ORF regions of their mRNAs. However, we have also included these clones in the DB with the belief that one could obtain some new and useful information by analyzing these clones.We discovered a lot of genes had mRNA diversity due to, for example, FEVs. We also found a lot of tissue-specific splicing patterns. Especially, in the case of FEVs that we analyzed, genes used different regions of the genome loci as the first exon, which seemed to be dependent on the tissue and its condition. We also discovered genes, the TSSs of which were located further away on the same genome locus of the gene. In these cases, there exists a high possibility that their transcription is controlled by individual transcription factors. As the mechanisms for controlling the transcription are closely related to the function, by understanding these mechanisms one could be able to artificially control the expression of an appropriate transcript in the future.In this study, we have identified multiple transcripts producing genes, and we believe that each one of these genes is transcribed into an appropriate transcript according to the need and circumstance. Now, it will be important to know whether there is any correlation between the expression of one of the transcripts produced by a gene and a disease. For example, in the case of transcripts containing FEVs, which we analyzed in detail, only the first exon regions were different from the other previously characterized transcripts. Since the first exon regions of these transcripts are unique, it is possible to distinguish them easily from the other transcripts. It may be possible to control the expression of a specific mRNA from a group of mRNAs transcribed from a gene by targeting the first exon. As we accumulate more information on mRNA diversity of genes using approaches similar to what we have described in this study, we might be able to identify candidate genes as novel targets for the development of drugs with lower side effects.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was partly supported by a grant from New Energy and Industrial Technology Developmental Organization (NEDO) project of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan.We thank the members of the NEDO functional analysis of protein and research application project for cDNA sequencing and clone stock, especially thanks to M.
