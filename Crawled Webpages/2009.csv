IntroductionAn enormous number of microorganisms, the vast majority of which are bacterial species, are known to colonize and form complex communities, or microbiota, at various sites within the human body. It is estimated that the human microbiota is composed of ~1014 bacterial cells, which is 10 times more than the total number of human cells. The largest and most complex is the one comprised by intestinal bacteria that includes as many as 1012 cells per 1 g of feces in the average human individual.1 Thus, within each human body, intestinal and other microbiota, along with the ‘host’ human cells, form a complex ecosystem that, as a whole, interactively performs various biological processes.2 Therefore, perhaps we should regard ourselves as ‘superorganisms’ together with the indigenous microbes3 and that the composite genome should be referred to as the human ‘metagenome’.Studies on human intestinal microbiota should include microbial ecology and analysis of the complex metabolism of the microbial community, as well as various host–microbial interactions occurring at the interface between microbes and host intestinal epithelia. Such studies are expected to lead to understanding of the impact of the microbiota on human health and disease.4–6 Along these lines, it should be noted that an international collaborative project, ‘the human microbiome project (HMP)’, was launched7 in 2007 with the aim of collecting and integrating the genomic information from many diverse human microbiomes (the word ‘microbiome’ was first introduced in 2001 to define the collective genomes of microbiota8). This article is intended as an overview of the recent findings in relevant research fields.2. Microbial diversity of the human gut microbiotaOver the past decade, the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene (16S) sequence (~1.5 kb) has been a useful landmark for analyzing the microbial diversity of human intestinal microbiota. A large-scale 16S phylotype analysis (grouping only by 16S rRNA sequence similarity) was carried out for three human adult microbiota.9 The analysis of 13 335 bacterial 16S sequences identified 395 phylotypes at the strain level using a threshold of 99% sequence identity (% ID) and a single archaeal phylotype (Methanobrevibacter smithii) within the three samples. Members of the genera Bacteroides, Eubacterium, Clostridium and Ruminococcus were the major species found in the adult microbiota. Of the 395 phylotypes, ~80% represented sequences from species yet to be cultivated. This analysis also indicated high interindividual variations in microbial composition among the three samples. Another large-scale 16S analysis estimated 4074 phylotypes at the species level (=97% ID) in 18 348 sequences obtained from 14 subjects including 12 obese adults monitored for over 1 year.10 This and a study using obese mice together revealed the association of the intestinal microbiota with obesity.11 More recently, 16S analysis was performed for 15 172 sequences from 190 samples including subjects with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and healthy adults.12 The etiology of IBD is known to largely correlate with the intestinal microbiota or certain microbial members.13–15 These and other studies demonstrated that the intestinal microbiota of IBD patients have reduced microbial diversity compared with those of healthy controls.12,16 The 16S analysis of other disease-afflicted subjects has also been performed in epidemiologic studies involving allergy17–19 and cancer.20,21The analysis of more than 45 000 bacterial 16S data combined with the three large-scale surveys described above estimated at least 1800 genera (=90% ID), ~16 000 phylotypes at the species level (=97% ID) and ~36 000 phylotypes at the strain level (=99% ID) in the human intestinal microbiota, predicting even greater diversity at the species level.12 This analysis also revealed that the majority (98% of all species) belongs to only four bacterial divisions: Firmicutes (64%), Bacteroidetes (23%), Proteobacteria (8%) and Actinobacteria (3%), whereas other minor taxonomic divisions are quite diverse.Besides these ‘snapshot’ analyses of the intestinal microbiota composition, other long-term surveys have been performed to follow both the overall composition and that of limited members over periods ranging from several months up to 2 years.10,22–24 These longitudinal studies suggested that the composition of intestinal microbiota do not drastically change in adults within the periods examined.16S analyzes of infant intestinal microbiota have also been carried out.25–27 One analysis revealed a dramatic progression in microbial composition until at least 1 year after birth with higher interindividual variations, but less complex than those between adults, converging toward a profile characteristic to the adult type at the end of the first year of life.25 As might be expected, fraternal twins tend to show a significantly high similarity in their temporal microbial composition profiles.25,28 No clear correlation was found in overall microbial composition due to the mode of delivery (Cesarean section or vaginal birth) and feeding with breast milk or formulated milk. Therefore, the source of these early colonizers is not clear, whereas some specific species are known to be transmitted from mother to baby.26,29,30 Infant intestinal microbiota is mostly composed of bacteria such as Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Bifidobacterium and Enterobacteria. Both adult and infant intestinal microbiota members are restricted to a small subset of species as described above, implying that the intestinal microbiota have evolved to shape overall microbial diversity under strong selective pressures.4,53. Sequence-based metagenomics of the human gut microbiomeThe 16S analysis disclosed the existence of numbers of unculturable bacteria in the human intestinal microbiota, with only up to 20% of the 16S data able to be assigned to known species that have been successfully cultured in the laboratory during the past four decades.9 Purely culturable bacteria are definitely necessary for comprehensive characterization of their biological and genetic natures. On the other hand, it is obvious that the 16S data do not provide any information on functional features of the microbial community. Thus, both culture-based and 16S-based approaches have crucial limitations for further studies, particularly for functional analysis. Metagenomics, the third and newest approach, has made it possible to comprehensively explore the biological nature of these complex communities.31,32 This culture-independent approach includes shotgun sequencing of microbial DNA prepared from the microbiota containing unculturable species isolated directly from the environments, followed by intensive computational analysis of obtained genomic sequences. Metagenomics is a quite effective and powerful approach for collecting and analyzing the information of genes present in the microbial community, because the proportion of the protein-coding regions in bacterial genomes can be as high as 80%, so that most of the metagenomic sequences obtained contain at least partial gene regions directly related to functions.33 Biased data can be minimized in the metagenomic analysis, but a small fraction of genes may be relatively under-represented in the entire data set mainly due to toxicity of the gene products or sequence regions to the host Escherichia coli during cloning of the microbial DNA.34 In addition, the degree of gene coverage is largely dependent on sequencing depth and complexity of the communities. These problems can be overcome by employing next-generation DNA sequencers based on massively parallel sequencing technologies,35 by which the cloning step is eliminated and sequence quantity is increased by orders-of-magnitude compared with that of conventional Sanger sequencers.To date, metagenomic data of human and mouse intestinal microbiomes have been published from three separate groups.11,36,37 Gill et al. obtained ~78 megabases (Mb) unique metagenomic sequence data from the intestinal microbiome of two healthy human adults. Comparison of gene sets annotated in the intestinal microbiomes with human genes identified significant numbers of bacterial genes that are not encoded in the human genome. The function of these gene products contributes largely to the metabolism of glycans, amino acids and xenobiotics, and biosynthesis of vitamins and isoprenoids, which are necessary processes in human biology. These findings indicate the symbiotic relationship with humans and support the concept that we are superorganisms, the union of humans with their microbiota.3 Kurokawa et al.37 analyzed 13 human intestinal microbiomes including adults, children and unweaned infants and obtained 479 Mb unique metagenomic sequence data. Unexpectedly, more than half (up to 90%) of total shotgun reads were assembled to form unique contigs in each sample, which is in sharp contrast to soil microbiota in which <1% of total reads were assembled. These results suggest that the amount of sequence data produced in the two metagenomic studies (around 50 Mb of Sanger sequence data for each sample) could substantially uncover the major species with the highest orders of magnitude in quantity in each microbiota, and that these species may be comprised of a very limited number of strain-level species, perhaps accounting for <20 species in each microbiome. The constitution of major species by strain-level species, not by high species-level diversity, could be inferred from base-inconsistency in the generated contigs, with most of those =5 kb displaying high sequence similarity of >99.5% ID between assembled reads. In order to uncover the vast numbers of other species present at lower orders of magnitude, it would be necessary to produce sequence data of several more orders of magnitude.The analysis by Kurokawa et al. also found 647 novel gene families specific to these intestinal microbiomes when compared with genes present in the metagenomic data of other microbial communities such as sea-surface, deep-sea and soil, and significantly enriched genes in these microbiomes when compared with gene sets in known microbes, except for the gut inhabitants. These gut microbiome-enriched (gut-enriched) genes were assigned to 237 and 136 clusters of orthologous groups (COGs) for the adult/child and the infant microbiomes, respectively, sharing 58 COGs between them for a total of 315 COGs in all. In the 315 enriched COGs, the function related to carbohydrate metabolism was remarkable in both types, but the functional repertories clearly differed between the adult and infant types. The adult type was rich in polysaccharide-degrading enzymes and the infant type was rich in sugar transporters. These data indicate that the functionality of healthy intestinal microbiota relies largely on available nutrients in the diet.38,394. Further analysis of metagenomic genes identified in 13 Japanese samplesGenome analysis of several Bacteroides strains dominant in adult intestinal microbiota indicated the richness of genes involved in polysaccharide metabolism,40–42 exemplifying the functional adaptation of intestinal microbes to gut habitats rich in polysaccharides, which are metabolized by bacteria to generate short-chain fatty acids such as butyrate, the major energy source for the host.38 It is also valuable to examine and compare the content of genes belonging to the 315 gut-enriched COGs in each genome of bacteria isolated from various environments. Our group recently performed a similarity search analysis of the enriched genes for 371 bacteria whose genomic sequences are already available. The 371 bacteria were classified into seven groups according to their origin of isolation. The ratio of adult gut-enriched genes in each genome is shown in Fig. 1. The average percentage ratios were 3.9% for all 371 microbes, 9.2% for 46 commensal bacteria, 4.0% for 94 pathogens and 2.7% for 231 bacteria from the other five groups. Those of infant gut-enriched genes were 2.8% for all microbes, 6.0% for the commensal bacteria, 3.5% for the pathogens and 1.9% for the other bacteria. These data clearly show that most of the commensal bacteria contain gut-enriched genes at a higher ratio than the other environmental bacteria. Interestingly, many of the commensal bacteria with lower ratios overlap those of pathogens, implying that intestinal microbes with a lower ratio of gut-enriched genes might be primary reservoirs for the corresponding pathogens. Table 1 lists the top 15 species with a higher ratio of adult and infant gut-enriched genes, respectively, which differ considerably from one another, except for the two species, Ruminococcus and Dorea. For the adult gut-enriched genes, members aggregated to three species, Bacteroides, Eubacterium and Ruminococcus, all of which are known dominant species in adult intestinal microbiota. For the infant gut-enriched genes, members are relatively diverse with Clostridium, Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus species being characteristic. Some of them (e.g. Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus) are prominent probiotics, living microorganisms having beneficial effects on host health.43 The species with the higher ratios tend to be dominant in intestinal microbiota compared with the species with the lower ratios. For instance, E. coli K12 had a ratio of 3.4% for adult gut-enriched genes, much lower than the 15 species listed, which is consistent with the minority of E. coli in the adult intestinal microbiota. It is also possible that the metabolic mutualism between intestinal members may allow the species with lower ratios, e.g. the human intestinal archaeon (3.6 and 1.2% for the adult and the infant gut-enriched genes, respectively), to stably colonize the gut.44Ratio of gut microbiome-enriched genes (adult) in sequenced genomes of bacteria isolated from various environments. The similarity search was performed with a threshold value of =1e-8 for 371 bacteria whose genomic sequences were available from public databases. The 371 bacteria were classified into seven groups according to their origin of isolation; commensals, pathogens, plant-related, soil-born, freshwater-born, seawater-born and others, and shown in red, pink, green, brown, light blue, dark blue and black dots, respectively.Ratio of gut microbiome-enriched genes (adult) in sequenced genomes of bacteria isolated from various environments.

Therefore, intestinal microbes may have additional properties tolerant to transient, but harsh conditions encountered in the mouth and stomach, through which they must travel to reach the gut. Genes encoding these yet unidentified functions may be included in the 315 gut-enriched COGs that contain many conserved but function-unknown genes, accounting for nearly 30% of all gut-enriched COGs, and in the 647 novel gene families identified.37About 75% of the genes annotated in the metagenomic sequences of the 13 human intestinal microbiomes showed sequence similarity ranging from 40 to 100% ID at the amino acid level with known genes.37 When, for each gene, the best blastp-hit was used to tentatively assign the gene to a species, the distribution of sequence similarity for each species assigned could be depicted as shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 shows two distinct distribution patterns; those that peaked at high similarity of over 80% ID and those with low similarity between 50 and 80% ID. Typical species with the first pattern are Escherichia, Klebsiella, Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides, all of which were previously isolated from humans and fully sequenced, so it is reasonable that many of the metagenomic genes showed high sequence similarity with those in these microbes. On the other hand, the metagenomic genes showing low similarity with known genes in tentatively assigned species, such as Bacillus, Clostridium and Streptococcus, probably originate from species that are close to the assigned taxa but have not yet been isolated or sequenced. These data suggest that human intestinal microbes constitute distinct phylogenies from those of other environmental bacteria and have evolved with their own unique histories including co-evolution with the human host and its ancestors.2,5Distribution of sequence similarity of genes identified in the human intestinal microbiome.

Issues to be considered in 16S and metagenomic studiesIn both cases of 16S rRNA phylotyping and metagenomic analysis, establishment of a reliable method for microbial DNA isolation from any given microbiota is a critical issue. This is because the intestinal microbiota comprise Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and a small fraction of archaea, some of which may be hard-to-lyse species. So far, methods based on mechanical disruption using zirconium/silica beads11,22,36,45 and those based on enzymatic lysis9,25,37,46,47 have been developed and employed for the isolation of microbial DNA from various bacterial sources.48–52 The DNA extraction method has been assessed with respect to the quality and quantity of obtained DNA as well as fecal sample preservation.53 Our group recently assessed and compared the published lysis methods using fecal samples. Our preliminary results, including UniFrac54 analysis of enumerated 16S data, shape and yield of obtained DNA, showed that many of the methods examined gave similar results in quality, but varied by more than 10-fold in quantity and in the degree of DNA fragmentation (data not shown).The 16S analysis also has an intrinsic problem in quantitative evaluation of the microbial composition because of the existence of multiple heterogeneous copies of the 16S rRNA genes within a genome along with uneven PCR-amplification of the 16S region. The range in copy number of the 16S rRNA gene varies from 1 to as many as 15 in prokaryotic species.55 In addition, the PCR primer Bact-8F,56 often used for amplification of the nearly full-length 16S sequence, might not be suitable at least for the quantification of Bifidobacteria, of which the 16S sequence has three base mismatches with the primer, underscoring the composition of this species.25 Recently, an improved primer pool was developed.57 Next-generation DNA sequencers guarantee the rapid collection of genomic data but provide less read-length than that of conventional Sanger sequencers.35 The feasibility of pyrosequencing reads of 200–300 bases for the 16S phylotype analysis58 was evaluated by collecting 141 000 reads from rhesus macaque intestinal microbiota.59 The results showed high reproducibility of the phylogenetic assignments and similarity of the major types and relative numbers of taxa to those obtained from Sanger sequences.6. Functions of the gut microbiotaDeciphering biological features of a taxonomically complex and ecologically dynamic microbial community is a challenging issue in gut microbiome research. Germ-free and gnotobiotic mice,60 pig61 and zebrafish62 provide simplified model ecosystems that allow detailed evaluation of functions of colonized microbiota or microbes and the corresponding host responses in vivo,63,64 as well as their impact on various host physiologies.11,65–69 Immunity in germ-free mice is premature, but is restored by colonization of commensal bacteria and even by a single microbe.70,71 Protection against pathogenic infection is also a characteristic feature of commensal bacteria.72–74Investigations have been made regarding the functions of commensal bacterial genes on their colonization in the mouse intestine. Flexible transcriptional regulation for adaptation to changes in available nutrients, including those during weaning, was found in Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron.39,75 Surface glycans expressed by Bacteroides fragilis are essential for its colonization.76 The analysis of certain Lactobacillus strains, which are thought to have health-promoting properties as probiotics, identified genes inducible upon their colonization.77 Expression profiling of both bacterial and host genes in mono-associated mice colonized by either Bifidobacterium longum or B. thetaiotaomicron and di-associated mice colonized by both bacteria were examined.78 The co-existence of B. longum expanded diversification in the carbohydrate substrates accessed by B. thetaiotaomicron in a host-independent manner. On the other hand, the presence of B. longum significantly reduced the expression levels of host genes responsible for antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria compared with that by B. thetaiotaomicron alone, suggesting the involvement of host responses in competitive colonization between these bacteria.Commensal bacteria share many indistinguishable features with pathogenic bacteria relating to host immune response.79–81 For example, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and peptidoglycan, major cell wall components of all bacteria, are well known ligands recognized by membrane-bound toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and TLR2 (TLR2), that serve as sensors of bacterial infection and lead to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFa and IL-6.82 Commensal bacteria have the ability to activate pro-inflammatory responses leading to harmful effects on the host via TLR signaling in mice lacking IL-10,83 an anti-inflammatory cytokine.84 Commensal bacteria also have the ability to activate anti-inflammatory responses leading to beneficial effects on the host via TLR signaling when the cascade to pro-inflammatory responses is lacking.85 These results indicate that the impact of intestinal microbiota on the host physiology largely depends on the state of host immunity and that host-commensal bacteria interactions are considered to be placed at the exquisitely equilibrated state between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses,81,86 where the host preserves intestinal microbes while still being able to sense the bacteria that penetrate across intestinal borders.Mammalian epithelia including Paneth and dendric cells are major sources of endogenous antimicrobial substances, including: lysozymes, phospholipases and various antimicrobial peptides such as a-defensins,87 angiogenin488 and RegIII<U+03B3>.89 Several studies have examined the relationships between these antimicrobial peptides and their effect on various intestinal microbes. RegIII<U+03B3> is a C-type lectin, of which the expression is mediated by TLR signaling90 and down-regulated by a Gram-positive Bifidobacterium strain.78 The expression of mouse cryptdins, a counterpart of human a-defensins, requires Nod2 (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 2), a cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptor expressed in Paneth cells that senses for bacterial peptidoglycans.91,92 Mutations in the Nod2 gene are highly correlated with the etiological risk of a subset of Crohn’s disease (CD).14,93 The expression of a-defensins at the ileal of patients with CD of the ileal was significantly down-regulated, but not at the ileal of patients with CD of the colon.94 Certain Enterococcus strains have been shown to regulate the phosphorylation of peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor <U+03B3> (PPAR<U+03B3>) to induce the expression of downstream target genes including interleukin-10 (IL-10).95 PPAR<U+03B3>-deficient mice exhibited dysfunction on the maintenance of gut homeostasis.96Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron induced PPAR<U+03B3>-mediated cytoplasmic re-distribution of the NF-<U+03BA>B subunit RelA in intestinal cells, selectively attenuating the inflammatory response.97 These findings indicate that PPAR<U+03B3> is a nuclear factor associated with anti-inflammatory response. The expression of antimicrobial cathelicidin LL-37 is induced by butyrate, the product of polysaccharide fermentation by intestinal microbes.98 These antimicrobial peptides may suppress microbial overgrowth and excessive contact of bacteria to the epithelia by directly killing them, resulting in minimizing inadequate stimulation of inflammatory responses.80,99Some antimicrobial peptides were shown to dramatically increase in expression during the post-natal period.88,89,99,100 And, it has been shown that TLR signaling by LPS is activated in vaginally delivered newborn mice immediately after birth but not in newborns delivered by Cesarean section.101,102 These findings suggest that exposure of maternal-derived commensals to the intestinal epithelia in neonates is involved in initiating the development of intestinal homeostasis. Secreted (or mucosal) IgA produced by gut-associated lymphoid tissues is largely involved in shaping the intestinal microbiota composition, whereas lack of IgA expression can lead to adaptive immune response.103–105 Intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) was found to dephospholyrate the phosphate moiety in LPS, resulting in detoxification of LPS and prevention of bacterial penetration across the epithelial barrier, suggesting that IAP plays an important role in maintenance of gut homeostasis.106,107 Recently, a study on gene expression of the TLR4-mediated signaling cascade in LPS-stimulated macrophages identified two classes of genes: those responding only to initial LPS stimulation and those responding to repeated LPS stimulation. The former class of genes includes pro-inflammatory cytokine genes, whereas the latter includes antimicrobial genes such as cathelicidin-related peptides. Histone modifications are involved in this regulation,108 which could also be linked to disease susceptibility from environmental factors.109In summary, the host has evolved to establish many processes that sustain unresponsiveness toward the commensal bacteria while at the same time maintaining responsiveness toward pathogens (Fig. 3). These processes include the production of IgA, IAP and various antimicrobial peptides and epigenetic control of pro-inflammatory responses, all of which sever routes leading to excessive inflammatory response. On the other hand, pathogens also have evolved to equip various virulence factors, including effectors, that confer additional abilities for evading the host defense system, eventually inducing pro-inflammatory responses79,110 via change of the microbiota composition in favor of the pathogens.72 In contrast, commensal bacteria may also have evolved not only to acquire specific functions adaptive to the gut habitat, e.g. carbohydrate metabolism, energy production, cell maturation and proliferation toward intestinal homeostasis,111 but also to eliminate undesired appendages that could result in sensing for pro-inflammatory responses, e.g. profound depletion of genes for cell motility function in the metagenomic data of human intestinal microbiomes37 and attenuation of host immune response by loss of flagellar function.112Molecular interactions at the frontline between the host, intestinal commensal bacteria and pathogenic bacteria. Commensal bacteria possess specific functions adaptive to the gut habitat and are beneficial to host cells, including maintenance of intestinal homeostasis, but also include functions such as those of TLRs that signal immune responses to pathogenic infection.81,86 Host cells produce various antimicrobial substances such as IgA, IAP and antimicrobial peptides at the frontline to suppress excessive immune response to commensal bacteria, while maintaining responsiveness to pathogens equipped with various virulence factors to evade the host defense system.Molecular interactions at the frontline between the host, intestinal commensal bacteria and pathogenic bacteria.

HMP and future directionsThe HMP aims at a better understanding of the roles of human microbes on human biology including their relationship with health and disease.7 The project includes metagenomic and 16S analysis of the microbiota inhabiting various body sites such as the oral and nasal cavities, the gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts, and skin in several hundreds of healthy and disease-afflicted subjects, as well as genome sequencing of nearly 1000 human commensal microbes. In addition, various metadata concerning the host are needed, including variations in host genotypes113 and metabolic phenotypes114 that largely influence host–microbe interactions. In this regards, one challenging issue is the construction of an integrated metabolic map, of both human and microbiota,115 which will become the new frontier for medical purposes such as the development of biomarkers for prediction of disease predisposition of individuals, extensive drug design targeting the intestinal microbiota and personalized drug therapies.116,117A simplified model system using gnotobiotic animals has provided fundamental knowledge of the molecular mechanisms involved in intestinal host–microbe interactions, in which active bacterial components have been identified.118,119 However, an enormous number and variety of bacterial components and products must participate in these interactions, and most remain unknown. Future studies will include those to explore and identify intestinal bacteria and their gene products (including metabolites) that are involved in host–microbial interactions, to identify human genes that respond to bacterial signals crucial for human physiology and to identify dietary components that influence and shape the intestinal microbiota composition. These scientific challenges will be achieved by using advanced ‘omics’ technologies coupled with the vast quantities of genomic data that are already being accumulated by the HMP. Thus, the human intestinal microbiome will pave the way leading to a new frontier in human biology, in which the human genome and the intestinal microbiome are tightly linked together as an integral part of the ‘human metagenome’ (Fig. 4).Future direction of human intestinal microbiota research. Human intestinal microbiota function is responsible for both human health and disease in accordance with its own genetic diversity and in association with human genetic variation. The study of human microbes, especially the vastly abundant intestinal microbes, is a new frontier in human biology. Many questions remain to be answered about host–microbe interactions, including: what factors and dietary components shape microbiota diversity, which bacteria and their components interact with host cells, which human genes respond to and how do they react to bacterial signals affecting human physiology.Future direction of human intestinal microbiota research.

IntroductionRegulation of gene expression plays a central role in defining cell fate and controlling organ formation. Genomic function can be understood at the nucleotide level, but, the complexity and diversity of genomic function, leading to an emergent picture of the genome as an interacting system with many degrees of freedom, bring experimental and theoretical challenges to the quantitative measurement of the biological state, many of which are of statistical nature. Genes encode proteins, and proteins perform functions in the cell. Hence a gene takes part in biological function only if it is expressed, i.e. the protein produced from it is present in the cell. Gene regulation takes place during transcription, the process by which the cell reads the information contained in a gene and copies it to the messenger RNA which is subsequently used to make a functional protein. This is a most fundamental level of biological process which involves the interaction of DNA and proteins. Its regulation takes place through the binding of proteins to DNA at specific loci in the vicinity of the gene to be regulated. The transcription of one gene may be enhanced or reduced by the expression of the gene itself. The process is complex and not yet understood completely. Genes with high expression levels include those required for an organism’s viability and the ability to identify these genes is crucial for drug development. Certainly the high cost and technical expertise required is an obstacle to many investigators who are interested in pursuing such studies. Although a variety of software tools and technologies have been developed for gene expression studies, a universal standard making these studies more suitable for comparative analysis and for inter-operability with other information sources is yet to emerge. Large-scale, high-throughput experimental methods require material and information processing systems to match. The analysis of high-throughput gene expression data is in an early stage of development. Development of advance technology for whole genome expression studies is thus becoming increasingly recognized. Predicting expression level of genes through computational methods is appealing because it circumvents expensive and difficult experiment.In recent years there has been increasing reports1–23,43,44 on predicted highly expressed genes in several micro-organisms which provide a wealth of information about gene expression. It is suggested that the essential genes primarily include the ensembles of highly expressed genes that encode proteins [transcription/translational factors (TF), ribosomal proteins (RP), proteases and chaperons (CH), degradation, cellular localization, biosynthesis, metabolism, photosynthesis, respiration and glycolysis, etc] vital for cell physiology. Perhaps, the essential functions of these gene products correspond to the biased amino acid composition that might minimize the substantial biosynthesis energy costs indicating the high biological significance of these genes. Besides other mechanisms, it is also suggested that codon bias can influence gene expression by optimization of the translational rate and thus, highly expressed genes can be characterized on the basis of biased codon usages compared with average genes. In several previous studies,3,7–13,17 a number of different patterns of codon usage have been hypothesized and many indices have been proposed to measure the degree of codon bias. Among these, the codon adaptation index (CAI) has been widely applied to the prediction of highly expressed genes in various organisms.3,15,16,24–27 CAI was proposed as a measure of codon usage in a gene relative to that in a reference set of genes.3 The previous studies suggest that CAI index correlates better with expression level of a gene than other codon usage indices, such as the effective number of codons,7 codon bias index,8 the frequency of optimal codons,9 intrinsic codon bias index,10 maximum likelihood codon bias,11 synonymous codon bias orderliness,12 and measure independent of length and composition (MILC),13 etc. The parameters underlying the CAI model rely on the codon composition of only a limited set of highly expressed genes and are based on a fairly simple assumption that the functional class of genes are highly expressed. To define the parameters in the CAI model, Sharp and Li3 considered the codon frequency of only 24 highly expressed genes of which 50% were genes of RPs and the rest mostly metabolic enzymes. A related method, the codon usage model, is based on similar principles, but the parameters are based on a somewhat broader set of highly expressed genes. In application of this model, Karlin and coworkers17–23 have shown that it is a reasonable assumption that for RP genes, CH and TF are highly expressed. Gene expressivity is strongly correlated with protein abundances. A number of studies have also revealed that codon compositions in highly expressed genes are influenced by tRNA abundances.1–6 Generally, highly expressed genes, producing abundant proteins, use a subset of optimal codons which are recognized by the most abundant tRNA species. It is well established that highly expressed genes have strongly biased usage of alternative synonymous codons and that of preferred codons, which are thought to be translated most efficiently by the most abundant tRNAs, and the lowly expressed genes have less biased codon usage patterns.1,2 The observations strongly suggest that natural selection has shaped the codon usage pattern accommodating optimal gene expression levels for most situations of its habitat, energy sources, and life cycle. Codon usages vary considerably within and between organisms. The effect of natural selection on codon usage quantifies the level of gene expression. However, the resulting bias in the codon usage has two main components. One is the correlation with tRNA availability and the other is non-random choices between pyrimidines for third base. A critical analysis of codon usage in a gene shows that mutational bias also plays a role in codon selection. Several studies have analysed the relationship between the GC-content of isochors and the expression patterns of the genes they contain.28 The G + C composition resulting from mutational bias has been hypothesized to determine the major trends in codon usage of high or low G + C organisms. Within a genome, codon bias tends to be much stronger in highly expressed gene than in genes expressed at lower levels, suggesting that there might be some selective advantage to concentrate essential genes on GC rich domains of the genome. Surprisingly, to address this important issue, some studies have also given conflicting results.29–33 Several papers reported very weak correlations, either negative or positive between the GC-content and gene expression. The discrepancy among the studies might be due to the methods used to measure the expression parameter of the data sets analysed or the differences in the way correlations were computed.In fact, the characterization of regulatory elements underlying gene expression is largely an unsolved problem. The hypothesis that codon usage modulates gene expression has been accepted in general. Many researches in this field have formulated their own measures, which has led to a large number of available methods3,7–12,17 for gene expressivity analysis. Unfortunately, these methods are not universally applicable as they exhibit strong artefacts of their formulation with varying sequence length, or overall codon bias, or codon bias discrepancy. Our aim is to develop a measure that will be free from any such possible artefacts and we attempt here to verify the usefulness of such a measure by employing it to predict gene expressivity in Escherichia coli (E. coli).2. Materials and methodsRCB is the difference of observed frequency of a codon from the expected frequency under the hypothesis of random codon usage where the base composition were biased at three sites as that in the sequence under study, divided by the expected frequency. RCBS is the overall score of a gene indicating the influence of RCB of each codon in a gene. Our analysis is based on the hypothesis that RCB reflects the level of gene expression. The expression measure of a gene in this approach is denoted by RCBS. RCBS value close to 0 indicates a lack of bias for the codons and is thus useful for comparing different sets of genes.3. ResultsOur data set includes 4174 complete protein coding sequences from E. coli. Expression profiles of the genes are determined by calculating the score of RCB (RCBS value) for each gene and their distributions are shown in Fig. 1. The majority of genes (63%) have RCBS values lying between 0.2 and 0.4, and the mean and median values are 0.3870 and 0.3295, respectively. Only ~18% genes have RCBS values >0.5. The analysis of RCBS values among different gene class shows that the gene classes (RP, CH, TF), which serve the representatives of highly expressed genes have RCBS > 0.5 in most of the cases. This suggests that significantly stronger codon bias is a result for translational efficiency as well. This finding is consistent with others,3,17,18 as most of the previous expression measures have considered those as representative standards for highly expressed genes in their calculation. There is also experimental evidence in support of RP, CH and TF as standard derivatives for the highly expressed genes as it is observed that many RPs augmented by abundant TF and CH proteins are needed to assure properly translated, modified and folded protein products which expedite and regulate cellular activities in most prokaryotic genomes. Our data support the proposition that each genome has evolved a codon usage pattern accommodating gene expression level, and RCBS value >0.5 exhibits favourable codon usage. So, we chose this index as an effective expression measure on the basis that it has been shown to correlate highly to expression levels and the predicted expression level based on RCBS (RCBS > 0.5) values suggests that almost 18% of genes in the E. coli genome qualify as highly expressed genes. In our study, the genes are segregated into different functional categories such as metabolism, information transfer, regulation, transport, cell process, cell structure, location of gene products, extra-chromosomal, DNA sites and cryptic genes in accordance with Munich Information Center for Protein Sequence (MIPS) classification. Functional analysis shows that highly expressed genes involved in the location of gene products are the largest functional class followed by genes involved in information transfer, metabolism, cell structure, cell process, extra-chromosomal, regulation and transport function, respectively. A total of 750 genes are identified as highly expressed genes in E. coli with 163 genes involved in energy metabolism, 75 genes involved in translation, 34 genes in transcription, and 29 in CH and folding (Supplementary Table SI). In addition, the functional class of amino acid biosynthesis, nucleotide biosynthesis, fatty acid biosynthesis and other cofactor and small molecule, etc includes 67 highly expressed genes. Besides, there are several (~185) genes encoding predicted proteins and 15 other genes of unknown function, which are thought to be highly expressed genes in our approach. We observe that 24 genes encoding predicted proteins and 12 genes encoding proteins of unknown function are highly expressed genes with RCBS > 1.0. The highly expressed genes of E. coli with RCBS > 1.0 are reported in Supplementary Table SII (hypothetical protein or predicted protein genes are not listed). Of these, 11 encode proteins that function in energy metabolism, 18 are RP genes, 11 encode TF and the remaining encode proteins that function in different cell process.Distribution of RCBS for all coding genes in the genome of E. coli.Distribution of RCBS for all coding genes in the genome of E. coli.In order to compare our results, we have also calculated CAI values for the same genes. Fig. 2 shows the relationship between RCBS and CAI values. Here, the CAI scores have been calculated according to the original publication of Sharp and Li,3 which stem from 24 highly expressed genes. It can be clearly seen that for genes with high CAI values (>0.5), there is strong correlation between them (r = 0.4614). But for proteins with CAI values significantly <0.3, correlation is worse (r = -0.0572). The novel method of quantitatively predicting gene expressivity is then compared with the other widely accepted measure of Karlin and Marzek.17 In Fig. 3, we plot RCBS values against E(g) of Karlin et al.18 The correlation is surprisingly good with r = 0.6706, P < 0.001. We analyse further the relationship between the length of the coding regions and the expression level of genes. In Fig. 4 we plot RCBS as a function of the gene length. We observe that shorter genes assume the higher value of RCBS while longer genes tend to have lower RCBS. There is a strong correlation between RCBS and gene length (r2 = 0.65878 and <U+03C7>2 = 0.0149). This effect is not due to systematic bias of gene size. To investigate the effect of protein length on gene expression as measured by RCBS, the data is split into three groups: short (L < 150), intermediate (150 < L < 300) and long (L > 300). Several observations can be made. Genes are sorted according to their expression level. It should be noted that genes of the same expression level may have wide variation in length and also that genes of the same length may have a wide range of RCBS. We observe that the estimate of expression level, as derived from RCBS, ranges from a low value to high value for each of the three length groups. It is evident from our data that RCBS ranges from 0.245 to 3.416 for L < 150, whereas it ranges from 0.123 to 0.907 for 150 < L < 300 and from 0.079 to 1.328 for L > 300. It is noted that the selective pressure on codon usage appears to be lower in genes encoding long rather than short proteins. Our studies, although less extensive, suggest that selection on codon usage as well as sequence composition is primarily responsible for RCBS. For a simple explanation, we select a set of E. coli sequences of equal length and randomize the above sequences 500 times, keeping their (i) codon usage; and (ii) sequence composition conserved. RCBS calculated for those sequences are found to vary in a wide range. We repeat the experiment on different sets of genes with varying length. The results are summarized in Supplementary Tables SIIA and SIIB. Supplementary Table SIIA describes the results of 14 arbitrary nucleotide sequences of different length, each randomized 500 times. In Supplementary Table SIIB, we present the results of the same experiment on a few selected genes of different length. We observe that the smaller sequences have a greater probability of resulting in high value of RCBS (>0.5), but there is nothing to prevent longer sequences from having high RCBS. Although the values for shorter sequences are more variable due to sampling effect, the intrinsic effect of gene length on RCBS reduces with the increase in length. A thorough exploration of theoretical values of RCBS suggests that RCBS can be an effective measure of gene expression, as its value depends on codon usage pattern along with DNA compositional bias of a gene.RCBS plotted against CAI for E. coli genes.RCBS plotted against CAI for E. coli genes.RCBS plotted against E(g)18 for E. coli genes.RCBS plotted against E(g)18 for E. coli genes.RCBS plotted against the length of 4174 genes from the E. coli genome.RCBS plotted against the length of 4174 genes from the E. coli genome.In order to test the RCBS as an expression level predictor, we chose to compare our results with the experiments. We collected data sets (listed in Supplementary Tables SIII and SIV) which consist of mRNA or protein abundance data obtained by different methods—mostly cDNA microarrays27,34,35 or 2D gel electrophoresis data36–39 for abundances of many E. coli proteins are available for comparison with the predicted levels of expression. In Fig. 5, we compare the predicted levels of expression in E. coli with 2D gel patterns34 and expression measure E(g) of Karlin et al.18 The relationship between RCBS values and mRNA levels seen in Fig. 5 agrees better than with the findings of Karlin et al.18 The correlation between expression level (as relative molecular abundance) and RCBS value is found to be 0.4533 whereas that with E(g) value is 0 .2618. Among the 20 most abundant proteins, 17 were identified as highly expressed genes with three exceptions for metE, folA and ilvE. The results are in good agreement with those predicted by E(g). Among the 20 least abundant proteins, only three mismatch with our predicted results whereas there are seven mismatches with the results of Karlin et al.18 Although pck, nusb, vals, args, rpll, thrs, leus are less abundant, according to 2D gel patterns, the high E(g) values of Karlin et al.18 support naming the genes highly expressed. But our data support only nusb, vals and rpll to be highly expressive genes. Of the remaining 55 proteins 22 were identified as highly expressed genes. This agreement with molecular abundance data supports our predicted results better than others. In a step forward we compare RCBS and the concentrations of various proteins in E. coli along with their CAI values24 (Supplementary Table SIV). Concentration is expressed as the number of protein molecules per cell. Concentration being used as a measure of gene expression, we find that our result is surprisingly good. The RCBS values along with the CAI values are plotted against the logarithm of concentration in Fig. 6. The predicted gene expression level using RCBS value is found to correlate well with the protein concentration data24 (r = 0.708211). The correlation is better than the quantitative measure of CAI (r = 0.615546). It suggests that a quantitative estimate of the expression level by RCBS values performs better than other indices of expression measure. Thus, regardless of the state of cell growth, one can measure the relative expression level for each gene under various growth conditions, different genetic states or over a time course during environmental change.RCBS (+) and E(g) (*) plotted against relative molecular abundance of 96 genes from E. coli genome.18 RMB denotes relative molecular abundance.

Despite the fact that the quality of experimental data seems to be a very important factor, we observe a good correlation between RCBS and microarray (radioactive) data (rmicro = 0.2415, rradio = 0.2098).Radioactive data (+) and microarray data (*)35 plotted against RCBS for E. coli genes. Y-axis is taken in logarithmic scale.Radioactive data (+) and microarray data (*)35 plotted against RCBS for E. coli genes. Y-axis is taken in logarithmic scale.In another analysis we compared our expression measure (RCBS) with the genomic expression profiles of the E. coli genome growing on rich (Luria broth glucose) and on minimal culture (glucose) medium (Supplementary Tables SVA and SVB).34 Of the 76 genes expressed at significantly higher levels on Luria broth plus glucose medium, 54 genes show a high expression level in our expression measure, whereas only 12 genes out of 107 genes expressed on minimal glucose medium have a high level of expression. We observe that the correlation co-efficient of minimal culture data with RCBS (r = 0.3011) is good, but very much worse for Luria broth glucose data. The agreement of predicted and actual protein expression level varied greatly between all examined combinations of prediction method and data set. The discrepancy is thought to lie in the quality of experimental data. The preliminary analysis on the quality of experimental data shows that these kinds of experiments are inherently noisy and of low reproducibility. The reproducibility of microarray data can be evaluated through the computation of correlation coefficients within and among the data sets from different microarray experiments. Two data sets from different sources can be chosen for analysis in this study. In the first, the data set was obtained from ExpressDB and the comparison made between expression levels in E. coli grown to either mid-log phase (LP) or stationary phase (SP). In the second, the data set was obtained from the ASAP database, where E. coli is cultured in lysogeny broth (LB). It can clearly be seen that the pair wise correlation coefficient among the gene expression levels from different experiments (rLP-SP = 0.52, rLB-LP = 0.017, rLB-SP = -0.039)34 vary broadly indicating the very noisy nature of microarray experiments and their lack of accuracy. The quality of experimental data seems to be a very important factor in this kind of analysis. Large variances may reduce the significance of statistical tests and might hide interesting trends in complex data. Microarray data tend to suffer from noise introduced at each step of different experimental protocols, while protein abundance data and mRNA expression level do not agree well in all cases. The other probable reason for incoherent results is that prediction of gene expression from genomic data, based solely on codon usage, is oversimplified. Other factors, such as promoter strength and gene copy number should also be taken into account.We now discuss our results in more detail for different functional classes of genes. The highly expressed genes are then classified into different functional categories, e.g. RPs, CH and degradation proteins, transcription and TF, energy metabolism, electron transport, recombination and repair, outer membrane proteins, aminoacyl tRNA synthetases, etc. (The distribution of highly expressed genes of different functional class in the genomes of E. coli is displayed in Supplementary Table SI.) All, but one RP, the major CH/degradation proteins and translation/transcription processing factors attain high expression levels. Supplementary Table SII presents the 52 genes with the highest predicted expression levels in E. coli. The gene for trp operon ladder peptide trpL involved in amino acid (tryptophan) biosynthesis attains the highest RCBS value 3.42, among all E. coli genes.3.1. RP genesRPs are very important in cell biology as thus provide a range of activities required for all steps of protein biosynthesis. Following the analysis based on the definition RCBS and Equation (1) and (2), we observe that virtually all RP genes qualify as highly expressed genes. The genes encoding RPs, which are expected to be expressed at high levels during rapid cell growth, were identified with RCBS values >0.5 (Table 1). All but one RP in E. coli are expressed at significantly higher levels; the only exception is rimK, RP S6 modification protein, where it is thought to contribute to the ribosome maturation and modification. The RCBS values for highly expressed RP genes range from 0.50 to 1.77. In fact, all RP genes in E. coli do not reach the top expression level. Seventeen out of 56 are among the highest 86 highly expressed genes. The highest expression level occurs for L34, with an RCBS value of 1.77. The RPs are the major component, together with the ancillary proteins, involved in protein synthesis. The genes coding for RPs, protein synthesis factors and RNA polymerase subunits are all intermingled and organized into a small number of operons. We observe that the genes for some major translational or transcription processing factors, including tufA, tufB, fusA, fkpA, slyD, rpoB and rpoC, which are within or near the large RP operon, are predicted as highly expressed genes. Although RPs play an exclusive role in determining ribosome structure, several are multifunctional. RplA, rplD and rplT, the 50S ribosomal subunit proteins (L1, L4 and L20 respectively), and rpsH, the 30S ribosomal subunit protein S8 have a regulatory role. The S1 gene, a giant RP gene (labelled as rpsA) is essential to E. coli and putatively contributes to the initiation of protein synthesis. S9 (rpsI) participates in certain repair activities, and S16 (rpsP) acts as an endonucleases.RCBS of the highly expressed genes of different functional class in the E. coli genomeRCBS of the highly expressed genes of different functional class in the E. coli genome3.2. Genes for transcription/translation processing factorsThere are ~100 genes encoding enzymes, factors and structural components that make up the translational apparatus. Out of these100 genes 75 are identified as highly expressed genes with RCBS values >0.5. Thus the majority of genes involved in translation are predicted to have a high expression level. Of these 75 translational genes, which are expressed at higher level, 55 encoded RPs. Highly expressed genes for transcription/translation processing factors are reported in Table 1 and can be compared with the data available.18There are ~260 known genes that encode factors involved in translation and ribosome modification including the initiation and elongation factors, 34 of which are indicated to be at a higher expression level. As with RPs, genes coding for elongation factors (efp, yeip, fusA, tsf, tufA, tufB), ribosome recycling factor (frr) and translation initiation factor (infA) register as highly expressed genes which play important roles in translation. The expression level of infB, fused protein chain initiation factor is moderately high (RCBS = 0.49017). The regulation of infB which is downstream and co-transcribed with moderately expressed TF gene nusA (RCBS = 0.46579), is complex and is thought to be the result of auto regulation of the extent of the read through at upstream terminators by moderately expressed nusA. The expression level of infB is higher than nusA. The elongation factor efp has been shown to be essential in E. coli for protein synthesis and viability. The expression levels of other elongation factors (fusA, tsf, tufA, tufB) are gradually higher. Interestingly, the regulation tufB is partially dependent upon the fis gene, global DNA binding transcriptional and the fis gene has significantly higher expression level (RCBS = 0.93575). Small RNA molecules are very important in cell biology and can regulate translation. It is found that genes coding 5S RNAs (rrfA, rrfB, rrfC, rrfD, rrfE, rrfF, rrfG, rrfH) and 23S RNA (rrlA) have distinctive RCBS values >1.0. Gene expression is controlled by a regulator that interacts with a specific sequence of a target RNA. Ffs coding for the 4.5S sRNA component of signal recognition particle works with the ffh protein (RCBS = 0.3524) and is involved in co-translational protein translocation into and possibly through membranes. SsrS coding for 6S sRNA inhibits RNA polymerase promoter binding. It acts as a template for RNA-directed pRNA synthesis by RNAP and mimics an open promoter. RaiA codes for cold shock protein associated with 30S ribosomal subunit. Ffs,ssrS and raiA involved in translational process are predicted to be highly expressed genes in our approach.Moreover we identify four other genes which are involved in the post-translational process and are expressed at higher level. These are riml coding acetylase for 30S ribosomal subunit S18, def coding peptide deformylase, hypC coding protein required for maturation hydrogenases 1 and 3, napD coding for assembly protein for periplasmic nitrate reductage, and npr coding for phosphohistidinoprotein-hexose phosphotransferage component of N-regulated peroximal targeting signal (PTS) system.Transcription is the first stage in gene expression and the principal step at which it is controlled. The gene for major cold shock protein (cspA) attains a significantly high expression level (RCBS = 1.28). The gene cspA is a regulator needed for adaptation to atypical conditions and gives a response to temperature stimulus. CspC coding for other stress proteins and a member of the cspA family is also a highly expressed gene. Among other genes involved in the transcription process RNA polymerase plays a vital role. RNA synthesis is catalysed by the enzyme RNA polymerase. Transcription starts when RNA polymerase binds to the promoter. Among the DNA-directed RNA polymerase rpoB, rpoC, rpoD, rpoH and rpoZ subunits in E. coli qualify the high expression level. RNA polymerase must be able to handle situations when transcription is blocked, e.g. when DNA is damaged. In the case of E. coli RNA polymerase, the proteins greA and greB, which have been predicted to have a high expression level, release polymerase from elongation arrest. Rho, transcription termination factor, attains a moderate expression level (RCBS = 0.4749). Termination and anti-termination are closely connected and involve proteins that interact with RNA polymerase. Anti-termination is used as a control mechanism and controls the ability of the enzyme to read past a terminator into genes lying beyond. The nus loci code for proteins that form part of the transcription apparatus. The nusA, nusb, nusG functions are concerned solely with the transmission of transcription. Transcription anti-termination protein (nusB) and transcription termination factor (nusG) have high expression levels. NusB is required for rho-dependent terminators whereas nusG may be considered with the general assembly of all the nus factors into a complex with RNA polymerase. NusA required for intrinsic terminators has a moderate expression level (RCBS = 0.4658).3.3. CH/degradation protein genesCH/degradation proteins are vital in cell physiology. CHs are proteins that assist the non-covalent folding/unfolding and assembly/disassembly of other macromolecular structures. One major function of CH is to prevent both newly synthesized polypeptide chains and assembled subunits from aggregating into non-functional structures. Many CHs are heat shock proteins, that is, proteins expressed in response to elevated temperatures or other cellular stresses. The reason for this behaviour is that protein folding is severely affected by heat and, therefore, some CHs act to repair the potential damage caused by misfolding. Other CHs are involved in folding newly made proteins as they are extruded from the ribosome. Although most newly synthesized proteins can fold in the absence of CHs, a minority strictly requires them. DnaK (HSP70), perhaps the best characterized CH in E. coli, is identified as a highly expressed gene. The Hsp70 proteins are aided by Hsp40 proteins (DnaJ in E. coli), which increase the ATP (adenosine triphosphate) consumption rate and activity of the Hsp70s. But, dnaJ has a low expression level (RCBS = 0.3988). It has been noted that increased expression of Hsp70 proteins in the cell results in a decreased tendency towards apoptosis. Although a precise mechanistic understanding has yet to be determined, it is known that Hsp70s have a high-affinity bound state to unfolded proteins when bound to adenosine diphosphate ribosyl, and a low-affinity state when bound to ATP. It is thought that many Hsp70s crowd around an unfolded substrate, stabilizing it and preventing aggregation until the unfolded molecule folds properly, at which time the Hsp70s lose affinity for the molecule and diffuse away. Other highly expressed heat shock proteins are groS, groL, hslO (Hsp33) htpG (Hsp90). GroS and groL are the small subunits of GroESL. These are the best characterized heat shock protein complexes in E. coli, identified as highly expressed genes. HtpG in E. coli is the least well-understood CH. Hsp90, a molecular CH, might be essential for activating many signalling proteins in the eukaryotic cell and is necessary for viability in eukaryotes. Since it is predicted to be a highly expressed gene, it is possibly necessary for prokaryotes as well.Protein degradation plays an important role in cell cycle, in signal transduction and in maintaining the integrity of the proper folded state of a protein. Out of 100 genes involved in macromolecular degradation only six genes qualify as highly expressed genes. In Table 1, the predicted expression levels of highly expressed degradation genes are reported. Among these the genes encoding xseB (exonuclease VII small subunit) and rusA (DLP12 prophage, endonuclease RUS) are enzymes which regulate the degradation of DNA. These are also involved in DNA repair activity. Pnp and csrA are the only two proteins qualifying as highly expressed genes involved in RNA degradation. Pnp, polynucleotide phosphorylase/polyadenylase, is fundamental in RNA processing. Polyadenylation plays an important role in initiating degradation of some RNAs. Triple mutations that remove Pnp have a strong effect on stability. Poly(A)polymerase may create a poly (A) tail that acts as a binding site for the nucleases. DegP, serine endoprotease (Protease D0) encodes an enzyme which is involved in protein and peptide degradation and is predicted to be required for global protein degradation. It responds to temperature stimulus. YhbO, YajG, a predicted lipoprotein and YhbO, a predicted intercellular protease are thought to be involved in degradation of proteins and polysaccharides.3.4. Aminoacyl tRNA synthetases and modification genesThere are 37 genes encoding the tRNA synthetases and other enzymes involved in tRNA modification. Results have been reported in Table 1. Compared with 19 PHX genes as predicted by Karlin et al.,18 only three genes register as highly expressed genes in our expression measure. These include aspartyl tRNA synthetase (aspS), lysine tRNA synthetase (lysS) and valyl tRNA synthetase (valS). The gene encoding glysine tRNA synthetase (glyS) is also predicted to be a highly expressed gene marginally with RCBS = 0.4974. Among other tRNA synthetase genes phes, glyQ, glnS, leus, serS, pros, tyrS, gltX and metG have moderate expression levels. PheM, phenylalanyl tRNA synthetase operon leader peptide registers a high RCB score with RCBS = 2.1835.3.5. Outer membrane proteinThere are ~13 highly expressed genes encoding outer membrane proteins, as predicted by our expression measure. The expression levels of these genes have been displayed in Table 1. These include outer membrane protein (ompA, ompC, ompF, ompX), outer membrane lipoprotein (slyB), truncated outer membrane porin (nmpC), palmitoyl transferase for Lipid A (pagP), scaffolding protein for murein synthesizing machinery (mipA) and tsx. Moreover, yqiG, a predicted outer membrane user protein, yqhH, a predicted outer membrane lipoprotein, and yddL, a predicted putative outer membrane protein have been predicted as highly expressed genes in our analysis.3.6. Inner membrane proteinAmong the genes encoding inner membrane protein, murein lipoprotein (lpp) has the highest expression level (RCBS = 0.6320). Other than conserved inner membrane protein, 34 inner membrane protein genes have been listed in Table 1 as highly expressed genes. There are ~83 conserved inner membrane proteins in the E. coli genome. Out of those, 17 have been predicted to be highly expressed genes (Supplementary Table SVII).3.7. Amino acid biosynthesisOverall, 20 of the 255 amino acid biosynthesis genes are expressed at a higher level. The artM, an arginine transporter subunit, flyM, a cystine transporter subunit, glnH and glnP, the glutamine transporter subunits are predicted to be expressed at higher levels. The glnA gene, which encodes glutamine synthetase, and glnB, which encodes regulatory protein for glumine synthetase, are expressed at higher levels. Interestingly, hisL, his operon ladder peptide; ilvL, ilvG operon ladder peptide; ivbL, ilvB operon ladder peptide; leuL, leu operon ladder peptide; pheL, pheA gene ladder peptide; thrL, thr operon ladder peptide; and trpl, trp operon ladder peptide are expressed at higher levels. The monocystronic gene ilvC, which is depressed exclusively by valine has a high value of expression score. The dapD product, 2,3,4,5-tetrahydropyridine-2-carboxylate N-succinyl transferage, which encodes the enzyme for lysine biosynthesis process via diaminopimelate has a high expression level.3.8. Nucleotide biosynthesisAccording to MIPS classification, ~31 genes encode enzymes for nucleotide biosynthesis. In our study, we observe that five genes namely purA, purC, adk, ndk and guaB encoding enzymes which are involved in Purine ribonucleotide biosynthesis and pyrL, pyrBI operon leader peptide for Pyrimidine ribonucleotide biosynthesis, are highly expressed genes. PyrL has a significantly high expression level with RCBS = 1.16.3.9. Genes for energy metabolism and metabolism of carbon compoundsOf the 392 genes involved in metabolism of carbon compound, 39 genes have a significantly high expression level. Of those, 27 are involved in carbohydrate metabolism, 10 are involved in amino acid metabolism, and two are involved in amines metabolism. Lpd is involved both in carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism. Rest one is involved in other carbon compound metabolism. No genes involved in fatty acid metabolism attain a high expression level, but seven of the 27 genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis have a significantly high expression level. The data presented here indicate that accA (acetyl-CoA carboxylase), which encodes one component of acetyl coenzyme A carboxilase is a highly expressed gene. In addition, ymcE, which is cold shock protein and aspS also attain a high expression level. Although less is known about fab genes except the FadR activation on fabA, we predict that some of fab genes (fabA, fabI, fabZ) have a significant expression level. This is consistent with genomic expression profiling obtained from DNA microarray analysis of Tao et al.343.10. Energy metabolism genesThe genes involved in energy metabolism are primarily divided into four groups: glycolysis, pyruvate dehydronage, the pentose phosphate pathway and the TCA cycle. Of the 1530 genes that are involved in energy metabolism, 163 have been predicted to be highly expressed genes in our approach. Two basic metabolic pathways glycolysis and TCA cycle involve eight and four highly expressed genes respectively, whereas the genes in glycolysis and pyruvate metabolism are predominantly highly expressed genes. These include the genes for eno, fbaA, gapA, gpmA, pfkA, pykF, tpiA, pgk.Unlike Karlin et al. the proteins involved in the initial steps of glycolysis (pgi coding glucophosphate isomerage and the proteins involved in the initial steps of TCA cycle (gltA, citrate synthase) are not highly expressed genes in our observation. Besides having the most TCA cycle, pyruvate dehydronage and glycolysis, E. coli genome has several highly expressed genes of anaerobic and aerobic respiration. Among NADH dehydrogenase nuo complex nuoA, nuoI and nuoK are highly expressed genes. Genes encoding a, ß and e subunits of F1 sector of membrane bound ATP synthase and b and c subunits of F0 sector of membrane bound ATP synthase genes have been predicted to be highly expressed genes. With respect to electron transport flavodoxin 1 (fldA) and cytochrome o ubiquinol oxidase subunit III (cyoC) are highly expressed gene with RCBS values 0.6062 and 0.5316, respectively. In addition, cytochrome c biogenesis protein (ccmD), and cytochrome o ubiquinol oxidase subunit IV (cyoD) also register high expression level in our approach.In marked contrast to Kerlin et al., E. coli has six highly expressed flagellar genes flgB, fliE, fliJ, fliQ, fliS, fliT. The flagellum secretion apparatus may be viewed as part of the CH family essential for bacterial viability. Assembly of a flagellum is required to export protein subunits to the outer surface of the cell. Recent evidence indicates that flagellum regulon can also influence bacterium–host interactions independent of motility.3.11. Fatty acid biosynthesisFatty acid metabolism is crucial because not only does it provide various fatty acids and phospholipids necessary for cell growth, but it also serves as a source of precursors for biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. The highly expressed genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis included genes encoding beta-hydroxydecanoyl thioester dehydrase (fabA), NADH-dependent enoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] reductase (fabI), (3R)-hydroxymyristol acyl carrier protein dehydratase (fabZ), holo-[acyl-carrier-protein] synthase 1(acpS), accA, cold shock gene (ymcE). Besides 3-oxoacyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] synthase I (fabB) has moderately high value of RCBS (RCBS = 0.4954).3.12. Central intermediary metabolismSeveral highly expressed genes in this functional class are also involved in carbohydrate metabolism. Besides other genes in this class which are also involved in nitrogen metabolism, phosphorus metabolism, amino acid metabolism, etc., our analysis identified the key genes involved in central intermediary metabolism, encoding aspartate ammonia-lyase (aspA), citrate lyase (citD, citE), glycine cleavage complex lipoylprotein (gcvH), Ni-dependent glyoxalase I (gloA), 3-keto-l-gulonate 6-phosphate decarboxylase (ulaD), d-erythro-7,8-dihydroneopterin triphosphate 2';-epimerase and dihydroneopterin aldolase (folX) and d-erythro-7,8-dihydroneopterin triphosphate 2';-epimerase and dihydroneopterin aldolase (mutT) as highly expressed genes. FixX, 4Fe-4S ferredoxin-type protein is also registered as a highly expressed gene predicted to be involved in central intermediary metabolism.3.13. Genomic repair proteinsAn event that introduces a deviation from the usual double-helical structure of DNA is a threat to the genetic constitution of the cell. The repair system is thus very important for the survival of the cell. The repair system can recognize a range of distortions in DNA as signal for action, and is likely to have several systems able to deal with DNA damage. Table 1 reports the highly expressed repair proteins in E. coli genome. Other repair proteins have low to moderate expression levels. Of the 51 genes involved in DNA repair, only six genes reach a high expression level. The principal pathway for recombination repair in E. coli is identified by the rec genes. recA, predicted to be highly expressed genes in our approach is not only involved in recombination–repair activities, but also has another quite distinct function. It can be activated by many treatments that damage DNA or inhibit replication in E. coli. This causes it to trigger a complex series of phenotype changes called the SOS response, which involves the expression of many genes whose products include repair function. The other highly expressed repair genes in E. coli are xseB, dinl, yebG, dinJ, rusA. DinI, DNA damage-inducible protein I, and dinJ, predicted antitoxin of YafQ–DinJ toxin antitoxin system act on damaged DNA and involved in repairing damaged DNA. YebG, a conserved protein regulated by LexA functions as DNA repair.3.14. Regulatory proteinAbout 440 genes in E. coli encode regulatory proteins. Among these regulatory proteins 62 genes are predicted to be highly expressed genes. Several of the genes in this class also function in translation, transcription, DNA repair, replication/recombination, cell process, etc. The predicted expression levels of several other highly expressed genes of specific regulatory proteins are listed in Table 1.3.15. Biosynthesis of vitamins, cofactors and small moleculesVitamin biosynthesis proteins have largely low expression levels. Only ribE, riboflavin synthetase, is highly expressed. This is in contrast to the result of Karlin et al.18 Pathways for the synthesis of vitamins of which only small amounts are generally needed to achieve adequate function, record low RCBS values ranging from 0.1801 to 0.5974. Some of the enzymes that utilize the vitamins as cofactors are highly expressed, e.g. accB, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, BCCP subunit of E. coli is registered as highly expressed gene in our approach with RCBS = 0.5533. Expression of the 10 highly expressed genes involved in the biosynthesis of cofactors and small molecules are listed in Table 1.3.16. Biosynthesis of other macromoleculesAmong the genes encoding proteins for macromolecular biosynthesis, lpp attains significantly high RCBS value (RCBS = 1.6320). In addition to it, other highly expressed genes involved in macromolecular biosynthesis genes are major type 1 subunit fimbrin (fimA), DNA-binding transcriptional repressor (iscR) and truncated cytochrome b562 cytochrome (cybC). GlsG, a predicted glycogen synthesis protein and yfgJ, another predicted protein thought to be involved in macromolecular biosynthesis also attain the score of high expression level.Of the 39 cryptic genes in E. coli analysed in our model, only three register as highly expressed genes. Those are csgA, a criptic curlin major subunit which is involved in glycoprotein biosynthesis, mokC, a regulatory protein of hokC, and gspl, a putative transport protein. The expression levels of these genes are 0.7, 0.62 and 0.55, respectively.Among the genes induced under starvation conditions only dps, Fe-binding and storage protein (RCBS=0.5544) which provides DNA protection during starvation proteins, rpoH, RNA polymerase, sigma 32 (sigma H) factor (RCBS = 0.5129) are predicted as highly expressed genes in agreement with Karlin et al.18 Other starvation protein genes [otsA (RCBS = 0.2349), otsB (RCBS = 0.2700), rpoE (RCBS = 0.2781), rpoN (RCBS = 0.2486), rpoS (RCBS = 0.4093), katE (RCBS = 0.2359), surA (RCBS = 0.3936), bolA (RCBS = 0.4342)] have low to moderate expression levels. The survival protein surA which is registered as PHX with E(g) = 1.10 does not qualify as a highly expressed gene in our approach. Besides, we also observe that a number of genes encoding prophases are recorded as highly expressed genes in our analysis. A phase DNA molecule is often integrated into the DNA molecule of bacterium forming a prophase. A list of highly expressed genes encoding different prophases in E. coli is displayed in Table 2.Predicted expression levels of highly expressed prophage genesPredicted expression levels of highly expressed prophage genesApart from these classified genes, a fraction of poorly characterized genes which are generally annotated based on strong sequence similarity is also found among predicted highly expressed genes. Many of these genes encode predicted proteins and some are poorly characterized hypothetical genes. (A list of highly expressed genes which are thought to encode predicted proteins is given in supplementary Supplementary Table SVII). Our analysis thus provides strong support for significant roles of these genes which may be highly relevant for E. coli.The large data set analysed here shows a clear connection between relative codon usage difference and gene expression level. Codon frequencies are found to vary between genes in the same genome and between genomes. Thus overall nucleotide composition of the genome which influences codon usage pattern introduces selective forces acting on highly expressed genes to improve efficiency of translation. This is also evident from the observation that shorter coding sequence has greater RCBS value, i.e. shorter genes have high expression level4,5,40,41 and this is consistent with the fact that the cost of producing a protein is proportional to its length.Interestingly, we observe that besides highly expressed protein coding genes all tRNA genes (listed in Table 3) are also registered with very high RCBS values. This observation suggests that usage of preferred codons in these and highly expressed genes is positively correlated and the highly expressed genes use a preferred set of optimal codons in accordance with their respective tRNA levels. Moreover, this result might find another important application in tRNA genes. Besides measuring expression levels of a gene, RCBS score can be remarkably used to remove the false positives in tRNA finding algorithm. Moreover, several genes of unknown functions with predicted high expression levels may be attractive candidates for experimental characterization because we assume that they have important functions in those organisms. Table 4 lists such gene families of unknown functions. This kind of analysis is valuable in helping to identify the promising candidate genes to be focused for further experimental characterization.Predicted expression levels of tRNA genesPredicted expression levels of tRNA genesPredicted expression levels of highly expressed hypothetical protein genesPredicted expression levels of highly expressed hypothetical protein genes4. DiscussionOur analysis supports that each genome has evolved codon usage patterns indicating gene expression levels. The three protein families – RPs, major translation/transcription processing factors, and CH/degradation proteins which are fundamental at many stages of the life style in promoting growth and stability, have been identified as highly expressed genes. Although the concept of predicting gene expression from codon usage was proposed a decade ago, only recently these methods have been successfully applied to the identification of highly expressed genes in various bacteria and eukaryotic organisms. But, any such codon usage-based prediction of gene expression relies on a prior definition of a reference set, consisting of highly expressed genes. For instance, CAI listed a set of 27 highly expressed genes for E. coli, which includes gene encoding 17 RPs, four elongation factors, four outer membrane protein, recA, and dnaK. For yeast a set of 24 highly expressed genes has been taken as a reference set. These include 16 genes encoding RPs, one for an elongation factor, two enolase genes, two GA-3-PDH genes, ADH 1, PCK, pyruvate kinase.3 Karlin and coworkers17–23 included transcription/translation-related factors and CHs in the reference set, in addition to the RP genes. MILC-based expression level predictor MELP13 is based on a reference set consisting of all genes coding for RPs, longer than 100 codons. Although the composition of the reference set is based on the functional assignment of the genes, but there is no specific algorithm to construct a reference set for individual species. The outcome is highly dependent on the genome examined. In some instances, in the use of alternative reference sets results are very poor. In principle it is not possible to regulate protein expression level by the judicious use of certain codons. It is worth emphasizing that individual genes tend to favour characteristic codon distributions and there is a strong connection between protein expressivity and the degree of codon bias. So, we emphasize that codon assignment as well as codon preferences should be taken into account in a single measure which will have functional feedback between the constraints of gene expression and microstructure of genomes. To better understand potential expression levels of genes, we developed a methodology that relates codon usage as well as large-scale DNA compositional biases among gene classes to the expression potential of individual genes. The CAI3 and codon usage models13,17 are originally based on somewhat qualitative assumptions about the expression levels of relatively few genes. This is our motivation for using a quantitative measure (RCBS) to recalculate genome-wide expression data. The new approach begins with the assumption, based on the argument just presented; that the general codon usage features observed in highly expressed genes greatly differ from that of randomly generated sequences with their sequence composition conserved. Our proposition is based on the fact that the difference between the geometric average of normalized frequency of codons (fxyz) in a sequence of nucleotides and that of f1(x) × f2(y) × f3(z) is >0.5 of the geometric average of f1(x) × f2(y) × f3(z) for highly expressed genes. The proposed threshold value (0.5) of RCBS is investigated for E. coli genome, Yeast genome and archeal genomes. The data (available on request) provide the evidence in favour of potential strength of our expression measure over the others. The most of the housekeeping genes fall in the category of highly expressed genes. The study also identifies a number of functionally unknown genes as highly expressed genes based on their codon profile. Thus, it often seems sufficient that our approach is a better alternative to the existing expression models. Surprisingly, we have found that there is a strong negative correlation between relative codon usage bias and protein length in contradiction with others.24,42 Although our primary motivation in developing this novel method was to compensate the possible artefacts due to sequence length variability, we have observed that highly expressed genes (identified by RCBS) show negative correlation with gene length leading to a biological relevance. This is suggested to be due to more effective translational selection acting to reduce size of the abundant proteins, to minimize transcriptional and translational energy costs. Although the longer sequences appear to be better optimized in terms of having codons for more abundant tRNAs which increase their probability in proper and timely translation, it is easier for a ribosome to translate a short RNA sequences, as opposed to decrease in fidelity for longer translation. Therefore it is likely that there is a natural selection for the shorter genes to be expressed at higher level.41To summarize, we have introduced a novel method, based on codon usage difference with regard to random base composition at three codon sites, to estimate the level of expression of a gene. In this article, predicted highly expressed genes are characterized for E. coli genome only, but the method equally applies to other microbes to be reported in separate communication. By comparing its performance with other commonly used measures of gene expression, we have established that RCBS is a generally applicable method, being resistant to species specific and introduces little noise into measurements. It is remarkable that the present model usually performs as well as other codon usage model of Kerlin et al.18 sometime lead to a better correlation with expression data according to several other measures based on CAI.3 The prediction of expression level in our approach can be appreciated by comparing them with the protein abundance data and microarray data. Thus, our method is effectively complementary to the experimental procedures of 2D gel electrophoresis and DNA microarray analysis in assessing gene expression levels. In contrast to other existing measures, our model describes the global enrichment of a codon in highly expressed genes with no restrictions on composition of the other codons. Of course, the codon-based expression indicators yield static value, whereas gene expression is a dynamic process with very different expression levels under different conditions. In our view codon usage pattern of genomes evolves as a result of interplay between mutational and selective forces and the proper account of the adaptive response to the codon assignment can lead to a practical solution of gene expression.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available online at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingFinancial support by the University Grants Commission, India, sanction No. F.PSW-060/05-06 (ERO), is gratefully acknowledged.The authors would like to acknowledge the reviewers for their valuable suggestions and comments to improve the manuscript.Supplementary data"

Overall, the identification of sets of co-regulated genes provides insights into the integration of plastid gene expression into common pathways that ensures a coordinated response.1. IntroductionPlastid genes are embedded in regulatory networks that enable adaptive and developmentally flexible chloroplast biogenesis. Coordination of plastid and nuclear gene expression on both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels is important for chloroplast function.1–4The activity of the plastid-encoded RNA polymerase (PEP) depends on nucleus-encoded sigma factors, which are mainly involved in global, tissue-specific, as well as environmentally and developmentally dependent regulation of transcription.5–11 Moreover, two newly acquired nucleus-encoded phage-type RNA polymerases (NEP, represented by RpoTp and RpoTmp) are involved in the regulation of plastid transcription, adding a further layer of complexity to chloroplast RNA metabolism.12–17Another important characteristic of chloroplast gene regulation is the predominance of post-transcriptional control.18–20 Although nuclear mutants in higher plants often show pleiotropic phenotypes, there is increasing evidence that numerous nuclear genes for chloroplast proteins control post-transcriptional processing and stabilization of individual plastid transcripts.1,21–25DNA array technologies of chloroplast transcriptomes have so far largely been restricted to individual conditions and/or single mutations affecting chloroplast functions.20,26–29 Moreover, in contrast to in-depth studies on nuclear gene expression, relatively little genome-wide information is available regarding the co-regulated expression of groups of plastid genes. Since the expression of nuclear and chloroplast genes must be tightly coupled, comparative array-based analysis of both genomes should provide a framework for the understanding of the integrated gene regulatory network. Affymetrix 22K ATH1 is an Arabidopsis oligonucleotide array containing more than 22 500 probe sets and is currently well used for global evaluation of gene expression from plants grown under various conditions. In order to elucidate the interactive networks and to identify novel Arabidopsis mutants impaired in chloroplast gene expression, we have established macroarrays and complemented our results with data acquired using the Affymetrix 22K ATH1 array for expression profiling.30Distinct expression profiles highlight clusters of plastid genes that are potential targets for concerted nuclear control.2. Materials and methods2.1. Sources of Arabidopsis mutants, phenotypes and plant growth conditionsMutant plants were characterized on the basis of their color and the maximum quantum yield (Fv/Fm) of photosystem II (Supplementary Table S1).31 Wild-type (WT) and mutant seeds were surface-sterilized before plating on an MS medium supplemented with 15 g sucrose/L. Plates were incubated at 4°C for 2 days in the dark, and then placed in a climate chamber under continuous light (60 µmol photons m-2 s-1) at 22°C.2.2. RNA isolation and gel blot analysisTotal RNA was extracted from frozen plant tissues using TRIzol® Reagent according to the manufacturer’s (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) instructions. Northern analysis was performed using radio-labeled DNA probes as described.242.3. Preparation of macroarray filtersNinety-four probes for genes encoding plastid proteins, tRNAs and rRNAs were amplified from DNA of WT plants (accession Columbia) using gene-specific oligonucleotides (data available upon request). Intron-containing genes were amplified with the Titan One Tube RT–PCR Kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Size and quality of PCR products purified with PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) were checked by electrophoresis on 1.2% agarose gels, and three different dilutions (30.0, 7.5 and 1.87 ng/µL) were prepared. Probes were spotted onto 11.9 cm x 7.8 cm positively charged nylon membranes (Hybond™-N+Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Munich, Germany) using a 96-pin tool (0.4 mm pins) with a BioGrid Spotting Device Roboter (BioRobotics, Boston, USA) as described.27,32 Each probe was spotted 20 times in duplicate giving 1.25, 5 or 20 ng per spot (Supplementary Fig. S1A and B). The spotted DNA was denatured (1.5 M NaCl, 0.5 M NaOH), neutralized (0.5 M Tris–HCl pH 7.2, 1 M NaCl) and fixed with UV light (120 mJ, 302 nm, UV Stratalinker 1800, Stratagene, La Jolla, USA).2.4. Hybridization of labeled cDNAs to macroarray filtersBefore hybridization, macroarray filters were incubated at 65°C for 1 h in 10 ml of buffer (0.25 M Na2HPO4 pH 7.2, 7% SDS). [a-32P] dCTP-labeled cDNAs were synthesized at 50°C for 1 h, with hexanucleotide primers (Roche) and 20 µg of total RNA as template, using SuperScript™ III RNase H- Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). After inactivation of the transcriptase at 70°C for 20 min, the labeled cDNAs were incubated at 37°C for 20 min with RNase H (Invitrogen) to remove RNA. cDNAs were purified on MicroSpin™ G-25 columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and used for hybridization (12 h at 65°C in hybridization buffer). Filters were washed separately at 65°C for 20 min each in three different washing buffers (2× SSC, 0.1% SDS; 1.0× SSC, 0.1% SDS; 0.5× SSC, 0.1% SDS).2.5. Normalization and statistical analysisTo maximize the precision of array data, probes were spotted in three different concentrations and in duplicate. The radioactive images were scanned with an FLA-3000 phosphoimager (Fuji, Tokyo, Japan), and the AIDA Image Analyzer (3.52) software was used for background correction and normalization of the signals. The mean value of three selected background dots within each sub-grid was used for background subtraction. Background-corrected hybridization signals were normalized using R/MAANOVA version 0.98.8 implemented in the R program (www.r-project.org).33 The robust locally weighted regression (LOWESS) method in R/MAANOVA was applied for normalization.34 After performing standard t-tests, adjusted P-values for each gene were calculated from ratios of six individual spots using a web-based microarray analysis toolbox (http://nbc11.biologie.uni-kl.de).2.6. Microarray data analysisATH1 (22 k) expression data from Arabidopsis thaliana were obtained from Genevestigator, GEO and AtGenExpress databases, using data for mutants and a variety of biological conditions.35,36 For identification of co-expressed genes located within operons, the MAS 5.0 method is recommended.37 Therefore, all microarray data were normalized by the MAS 5.0 method using Simpleaffy implemented in the R program.38 Expression profiles of 79 plastid genes were selected for cluster analysis. Fold changes were first converted to log2 and expressed relative to the mean value for normalization. Several clustering methods (hierarchical, SOM, K-means and Terrain clustering) were implemented using the program Genesis.39–41 The latter Terrain clustering method was recently successfully applied in DNA microarray experiments of Caenorhabditis elegans. Co-regulated genes were grouped together and visualized in a three-dimensional expression map that displays correlations of gene expression profiles as distances in two dimensions and gene density in the third dimension.423. Results3.1. Plant growth and mutant phenotypesUnless otherwise indicated, leaves from 3-week-old WT and mutant plants grown in a climate chamber (Percival, Iowa, USA) under continuous light (60 µmol photons m-2 s-1) were used for our analyses. Salient information on mutants, their sources and phenotypic characteristics including photosynthetic parameters is given in Supplementary Table S1, together with details of the growth and stress conditions employed. Most of the genes affected in the mutants studied are essential for photoautotrophic growth. Such mutants survived only when grown on medium supplemented with sucrose. The mutants exhibited three major phenotypes: albino mutants arrested at an early stage of chloroplast development, hcf (high chlorophyll fluorescence) mutants with impaired photosynthetic electron transport capacity and yellow to pale-green lines with defects in various, often unknown, chloroplast functions (Supplementary Table S1).433.2. Construction of plastid macroarraysDNA macroarrays bearing probes for genes encoding all plastid proteins, ribosomal RNAs and 11 tRNAs were constructed for comprehensive expression analyses of various Arabidopsis mutants affected in chloroplast development and function, and WT plants grown under various environmental conditions (Supplementary Fig. S1A and B). Mutant names and gene functions are listed in Supplementary Table S2. In order to ensure statistical reliability for the evaluation of expression levels, three different concentrations of each gene probe were spotted in duplicate onto filters, background subtraction for each gene grid was performed, P-values were calculated taking into account all spots and selected experiments were repeated several times (Supplementary Fig. S1). Moreover, scatter-plot analyses were performed routinely (Supplementary Fig. S1C).3.3. Expression profiling of plastid genes from plants grown under various biological conditionsIn addition to non-photosynthetic mutants, different WT tissues (stems, leaves and flowers), and WT plants exposed to various hormones (gibberellin, abscisic acid, auxin and cytokinin), herbicides 3-(3', 4'-dichlorphenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU) and methylviologen (N,N'-dimethyl-4,4'-bipyridinium, MV), biological stresses (heat, light, cold and dark) or treated with sucrose for defined times, were used to study plastid gene expression patterns (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2).In the flower, some photosynthetic genes tended to be down-regulated and non-photosynthetic genes were preferentially up-regulated when compared with leaves (Fig. 1A). Most of the chosen stress conditions induced significant deviations from the expression pattern observed under standard conditions (Fig. 1B–F). Similarly, excess light, which induces photoinhibition and formation of reactive oxygen species, caused both a reduction in photosynthetic gene expression and an induction of genes required for RNA and protein synthesis in the chloroplast (Fig. 1B). Compared with light stress, DCMU, preventing reduction of plastoquinone, had comparable but milder effects on the expression of plastid genes (Fig. 1C).44 Auxin plays an essential role in the coordination of numerous developmental processes in the plant life cycle.45 Although auxin treatment had a strong bleaching effect, the expression of most plastid genes was not significantly changed indicating that translational and post-translational processes are prevalent to cope with the hormone treatment. However, the 4.5S and 5S ribosomal RNAs were much more abundant following treatment with auxin (Fig. 1D). In contrast, several other stress conditions, including heat (Fig. 1E), cold (Fig. 1F) and sucrose depletion, significantly affected the expression of numerous plastid genes (Supplementary Table S2). Interestingly, differential expression of many plastid genes was more pronounced in WT plants exposed to various physical stress conditions (e.g. light, heat and cold) than in several non-photosynthetic mutants [e.g. hcf145 and cyt160 (cyt b6f mutant)] (Figs. 1 and 2).24Changes in plastid transcript levels in tissues and leaves exposed to the indicated stressors. (A–F) Log2-transformed fold changes in plastid RNA levels were determined in flowers when compared with leaves (A), and in leaves subjected to high light stress (B), DCMU treatment (C), auxin treatment (D), heat (E) and cold stress (F) when compared with untreated control leaves. High expression ratios are indicated by arrows. Detailed information on the stress conditions employed is given in Supplementary Table S1. In all six histograms, genes are listed according to their positions on the plastid chromosome.Changes in plastid transcript levels in tissues and leaves exposed to the indicated stressors.

Cluster analyses of plastid genes based on the analysis of 89 transcriptomesFor all data sets, we calculated P-values as a measure of the significance of the differential expression of plastid genes in 75 mutants, 3 WT tissues and WT plants placed under 12 different stresses (see previous section) relative to levels in WT plants grown under standard conditions. Filtering of genes with P-values below 0.05 or showing more than 1.5-fold expression changes did not significantly affect clustering of co-expressed plastid genes. Therefore, we included all data sets in our clustering analysis to permit a more comprehensive and subtle expression analysis of the plastid genome.K-means clustering of all 89 transcriptomes identified two groups, I and II, which displayed essentially opposite expression patterns (Fig. 3A). Most of the mutants in group I (~70%) exhibited an albino phenotype. The majority of genes up-regulated in group I had non-photosynthetic functions, whereas most down-regulated genes coded for photosynthetic proteins.Expression profiles of 94 plastid genes in 89 transcriptomes. (A) Transcript levels in 75 mutants and in WT plants exposed to 14 different biological conditions were determined by macroarray analysis. Fold change values were transformed to log2 and normalized relative to the mean value of genes and experiments. Non-hierarchical K-means clustering (K=2) was performed as described in the ‘Results’. Fold changes close to, higher and lower than the mean values are represented by black, red and green colors, respectively. Co-expressed plastid genes were distributed into two major clusters A and B, which were further divided into eight classes (A–H). Cluster A (green bar) and cluster B (red bar) contain each four classes. Detailed information can be found in Table 1 and Supplementary Table S3.

The arrows indicate the two distinct transcriptome groups.Group II comprises transcriptomes of WT plants exposed to a variety of stress conditions and mutants affected in various chloroplast functions. Mutants of group II often showed a pale or hcf phenotype. The behavior of the albino mutants in group II (~21%), like alb3 and vipp1, deviates from the group I signature typical for most albino mutants.46,47 Unlike those in group I, the albino mutants in group II did not show marked differential expression of plastid genes. Interestingly, early arrest of chloroplast development and the acquisition of an albino phenotype are not necessarily correlated with the expression signature of group I. Most mutants in group II exhibited similar expression patterns, showing less striking expression changes and a smaller number of significantly differentially expressed genes than mutants of group I (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Table S2), which is consistent with primary defects in the gene expression system in mutants of group I. The data also imply that related genetic defects affecting chloroplast functions and resulting in comparable phenotypes exhibit similar expression patterns, like those of albino or hcf mutants, which are characteristic for mutants in group I or II, respectively.K-means clustering identified two major gene clusters, A and B, of similar sizes that exhibited opposite patterns of expression (Fig. 3A and Table 1). Cluster A contains 30 genes involved in gene expression, 6 ATP synthase and 6 NDH genes. Cluster B comprises genes for 31 components of linear and cyclic electron transport, rbcL and 16 non-photosynthetic genes.Functional categories and distribution of plastid genes within the two clusters shown in Fig. 3Functional categories and distribution of plastid genes within the two clusters shown in Fig. 3Remarkably, most Arabidopsis genes known to be transcribed by the NEP are present in cluster A, whereas genes transcribed preferentially by the PEP are found in cluster B.17,48,49 With the exception of rrn16S and ycf1, Arabidopsis genes that contain both NEP and PEP promoters are found in cluster A. In accordance with this, the expression pattern of group I mutants is indicative of a loss of the PEP activity since the expression profile is almost identical to mutants affected in the PEP activity.12,27 Therefore, most group I mutants are affected, either primarily or secondarily, in general RNA metabolism.K-means clustering further sub-classified plastid genes into eight distinct, co-regulated and often functionally associated gene classes; classes A–D are found in cluster A and classes E–H in cluster B (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Table S3). The averaged expression ratios for each class provide a differential expression view (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Table S3). Clustered genes generally derived from the same polycistronic operons (e.g. psbB-, psbD-, atpB-, petG, atpA-, ndhC- and the ribosomal S10 operons) (Supplementary Tables S3 and S4). There are also numerous exceptions, like rbcL/accD, psbE/psbF, psaB/rps14, petA/ycf10 and others. In these cases it is likely that processed monocistronic transcripts of a polycistronic transcription unit undergo different half-lives so that their levels do not correlate with co-transcriptional control. This has also been confirmed genetically since nuclear mutants exist that are specifically affected in the stability of individual RNA segment intervals of polycistronic precursors.1,2,21–24Co-expression of ndhH and ndhA in cluster A and association of ndhI, ndhG, ndhE and ndhD expressed farther downstream of the DNA strand of the former two in cluster B may designate a hitherto unidentified internal PEP promoter within the ndhH operon (Table 1).The sizes and membership of clusters that emerge from clustering analysis are known to strongly depend on the program and parameters utilized. We therefore performed clustering analyses with additional methods to confirm the identification of co-regulated genes, using self-organizing map (SOM) and hierarchical clustering methods.50 We confirmed the existence of two distinct oppositely expressed gene clusters (A and B), and both methods assign essentially the same sets of genes to the two clusters (Fig. 3C, Table 1). Each peak in the terrain map represents a transcriptome and peak heights reflect the dynamics of gene expression. The two-dimensional orientations and distances between peaks, which reflect relationships between transcriptomes, indicate that members of group I are quite unrelated to those of group II (Fig. 3D). The biological significance of the terrain cluster analysis is the existence of two distinguishable groups of related transcriptomes and data obtained are consistent with SOM and hierarchical clustering methods (Fig. 3D).According to the original expression data clustering is largely based on an opposite expression of genes in albino mutants of group I relative to gene members of group II. Notably, clustering of transcriptomes of WT plants adapted to various detrimental conditions failed to assign two main clusters of transcriptomes and genes (data not shown) indicating that post-transcriptional control of plastid gene expression prevails under changing environmental conditions. This finding is consistent with data obtained by using microarry expression profiles (see below).3.5. Identification of mutants affected in the chloroplast RNA metabolismMost mutants of group I exhibiting pleiotropic effects are affected in general plastid gene expression and most likely in plastid RNA metabolism. To distinguish mutants primarily affected in plastid RNA metabolism from those perturbed in other plastid functions, we used the mutants pac,51atprfB122,52 and hcf14524 as controls, which are known to be primarily affected in plastid RNA degradation and processing. The data obtained from the macroarray analysis of these mutants are in good agreement with those obtained previously by northern and quantitative RT–PCR analysis (Fig. 2).22,24,51 For example, the expression of most photosynthetic genes was severely reduced (>2.5-fold) but many genes encoding ribosomal proteins, sub-units of the RNA polymerase, ycf3 and accD were significantly up-regulated (>2.5-fold) in pac (Fig. 2A).51 Severely reduced expression of UGA stop codon-containing psbB and ndhC/K/J transcripts could be confirmed in the atprfB1 mutant defective in the expression of a ribosomal release factor (Fig. 2B).22,52 The nucleus-encoded factor HCF145 is involved in stabilization of the tricistronic psaA–psaB–rps14 transcript in Arabidopsis.24 Accordingly, the histogram for the hcf145 mutant shows that, although the expression of most genes was not severely altered, the abundance of psaA and psaB transcripts was drastically reduced (Fig. 2C), confirming for the first time the high specificity of the effect of this mutation on mRNA metabolism.24 Similarly, the severe defect in accumulation of the cytochrome complex in the mutant cyt160 (data not shown) did not result in the differential expression of most plastid genes (Fig. 2D). In contrast, the newly identified mutant crp135 (chloroplast RNA processing) showed highly elevated levels of some non-photosynthetic genes and down-regulation of 16S and the two autocatalytically cleaved 23S rRNA species a and b, whereas general differential expression of plastid genes was less prominent (Fig. 2E).Our analyses identified 25 mutant lines in which at least 10 genes showed at least a fourfold change in expression level compared with the WT. In 43 mutants, including the pac control and the T-DNA insertion (ins) mutants ins20, ins24 and ins25, the number of genes showing significant differential expression (>2.5-fold change) was greater than 10. In six mutants, levels of only a few transcripts were significantly altered in either direction, whereas in the control mutant hcf145, only the psaA–psaB–rps14 transcript showed a marked decrease (Supplementary Table S2). In the remaining mutants, such as vipp1 and alb3, the degree of up- and down-regulation was less striking (<2.5-fold) suggesting that the expression profile in these mutants essentially reflects secondary or milder primary effects (Fig. 2F). Indeed, the plastid proteins VIPP1 and ALB3 have been shown to be responsible primarily for the assembly of membranes and thylakoid complexes, respectively.47,48Since almost all chloroplast transcriptomes responded rather sensitively to mutations and displayed complex expression patterns, the characteristic expression signatures of groups I and II or simple quantification of changes in transcript levels could not be used to identify specific defects in chloroplast RNA metabolism. Instead, we selected mutants in groups I and II that deviated from the general expression signature for their group, e.g. mutants in groups I and II showing down-regulation especially of co-transcribed genes in clusters A and B, respectively, or vice versa. In addition to mutants of group I generally affected in plastid RNA abundance, this approach allowed the identification of 14 specific RNA metabolism mutants: the three control mutants, pac, hcf145 and hcf109, and 11 new mutants, including crp135 (Supplementary Table S5).Exemplarily, one putative RNA metabolism mutant, crp135 (Fig. 2E), has been selected for preliminary northern analysis to check its deviated expression atypical for group II members. Although the crp135 transcriptome clustered in group II, non-photosynthetic genes, such as clpP and accD, were up-regulated several fold and 16S rRNA was severely down-regulated when compared with the WT (Fig. 4). This is in good agreement with the array data (Fig. 2E). Furthermore, the mutant also showed severe RNA processing defects, indicating a functional link between mRNA processing and abundance. This demonstrates that the array-based approach is well suited to identifying nuclear genes relevant for regulating the general RNA metabolism (group I mutants) and specific plastid RNA transcripts.Northern analysis of the plastid genes clpP and accD in WT and crp135.

Use of Affymetrix microarrays for the evaluation of plastid gene expression in various Arabidopsis mutantsATH1 microarrays of A. thaliana represent probes of ~24 000 nuclear and 79 plastid genes.53 As has shown before the hybridization signals of plastid genes were generally several-fold higher than or comparable to that of even highly expressed nuclear genes confirming that the ATH1 microarray data are useful for evaluating plastid gene expression.30We collected expression data of plastid genes from 136 different transcriptomes associated with mutants that are mostly affected in non-chloroplast functions, such as morphogenesis of plant organs and signaling pathways. Similar to stress conditions, these data did not allow plastid transcriptomes and genes to be classified into two groups and two NEP and PEP determined clusters, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S2 and Table S6). Nevertheless, in accordance with the operon organization of plastid genes, 35 out of all 79 protein-coding genes co-transcribed in 14 polycistronic units were identified as being co-expressed (Supplementary Table S7). Hierarchical clustering identified nine groups of plastid transcriptomes (I–IX) and six co-regulated plastid gene clusters (A–F) (Supplementary Table S8). The largest differences in the average expression views were between clusters A and B (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Taken together, these results demonstrate that genetic defects unrelated to the chloroplast do not impose discernible plastid gene expression profiles or identify new clusters of plastid genes that are under common transcriptional control.3.7. Use of microarrays for the evaluation of plastid gene expression under various stress conditionsFold changes in plastid gene expression were calculated from data for plants subjected to 83 stress conditions, including various abiotic, biotic, pathogen, chemical, nutrient, hormone and light stresses.35 It appeared that plastid transcriptomes and genes clustered according to whether or not different stress conditions affected the chloroplast (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table S9). Again, two groups of generally oppositely regulated transcriptomes, I and II, could be defined. In group I, the stressors included biotic stresses, light (all spectral qualities tested, except UV-B) and various chemicals, whereas group II includes UV-B light, abiotic, nutrient, and hormone stresses. Six clusters (A–F) of co-regulated genes emerged (Supplementary Table S10). Although genes in clusters A–D encode quite heterogeneous functions, clusters E and F contain genes with almost exclusively non-photosynthetic (19 out of 21 genes) and photosynthetic (14 out of 18 genes) functions, respectively (Supplementary Table S10). Genes present in clusters E and F generally show a comparable expression behavior like a down-regulation under biotic stress and an up-regulation after hormone treatment but are oppositely regulated predominantly under different light conditions. This indicates that genes containing NEP and PEP promoters are preferentially light-dependent down- and up-regulated, respectively.Expression map of 79 plastid genes under 83 various conditions generated from Genevestigator.

Transcript levels for genes in clusters C and D were relatively high under various hormone stress conditions, but low under chemical stresses. The average expression views for clusters A–D displayed severe up- and down-regulation of plastid genes, whereas those for clusters E and F did not show significant alterations in plastid gene expression (Fig. 5B). Again, 14 groups of co-expressed and often co-transcribed genes were identified, indicating that co-transcriptional processes contribute to controlling the abundance of transcripts originating from single operons (Supplementary Table S11). However, in accordance with the macroarray data using solely various detrimental conditions, biotic and abiotic effects did not lead to clustering in two major oppositely regulated and transcriptionally determined gene associations, again indicating a prevailing post-transcriptional control under changing environmental conditions rather than a transcriptional control.4. Discussion4.1. Hierarchical clustering of plastid mutant transcriptomes identifies two distinguishable expression signatures and novel mutants impaired in RNA metabolismK-means and hierarchical clustering of transcriptomes of mutants affected in chloroplast functions led to the definition of two groups, I and II. Mutants that fell into group I mostly exhibited an albino phenotype with loss of photosynthetic capability. Group II consists preferentially of expression profiles of hcf and pale green mutants, and patterns characteristic of various tissues or induced by particular environmental conditions. Transcriptomes of group I were generally oppositely regulated relative to those of group II (Fig. 3). The plastid gene expression profile of tobacco PEP mutants revealed that most genes for photosynthesis and ribosomal RNAs were down-regulated and those for ribosomal proteins and RNA polymerase were relatively up-regulated.27 Interestingly, the signature of group I transcriptomes closely resembled not only the expression pattern of the PEP mutants in tobacco, but also those of plastid gene expression mutants in Arabidopsis and WT lines treated with lincomycin which inhibits plastid translation and therefore expression of the PEP.3,12,27,54,55 Several genes in tobacco, which were shown to be transcribed preferentially by the NEP (rpl33, ndhF) or the PEP (ndhA) appeared otherwise to contain most likely PEP and NEP promoters in Arabidopsis, respectively (Table 1), indicating plant-specific strategies for regulation of plastid gene expression consistent with a high diversity of plastid promoters in the two lineages.12,16,27Genes transcribed by the NEP and the PEP were generally severely up- and down-regulated in group I, respectively. Therefore, group I mutants are expected to be primarily affected in plastid gene expression at various levels, allowing preferential or exclusive transcription of plastid genes by the NEP. The data indicate that the activity of the NEP is prevalent in those mutants and under those conditions where expression of the PEP is decreased or limited. The important roles of NEP and PEP for gene expression in plastids in all tissues during plant development is consistent with the assumption that both polymerases are active in non-photosynthetic tissue and important for the early development of the chloroplast during germination.56 The appearance of several albino mutants found in group II indicates that they are not primarily impaired in plastid gene expression. Examples include alb3 and vipp1, mutants known to have defects at the post-translational level.46,47 This contrasts previous assumptions that albino plastids always exhibit strong, pleiotropic aberrations in plastid gene expression.1Reduced levels of plastid 16S and/or 5S rRNAs in mutants of group I imply a severe drop in translation rates and consequently a general loss of transcripts synthesized by the PEP. This makes it difficult to define the primary cause of the lesions in gene expression simply by comparing transcript levels. Instead of changes in levels and diversity of gene expression, deviations from the expression profiles that are generally characteristic for members of groups I and II may provide a more secure basis for identifying mutants primarily affected in the accumulation of specific plastid RNAs. Among the 75 mutant lines analyzed, eight and six bona fide specific plastid RNA metabolism mutants have been identified by this means in groups I and II, respectively (Supplementary Table S5), among them the control mutants hcf145, pac and atprfB1. Representative northern analysis of crp135 finally confirmed the specific defect in plastid RNA metabolism (Fig. 2E). Detailed molecular analysis of identified mutants and gene mapping approaches are in progress.4.2. Analysis of plastid genes based on various transcriptomes of WT and mutants defective in chloroplast functionsGenes previously confirmed to be preferentially transcribed by the NEP and the PEP, respectively, were present in clusters A and B, respectively (Table 1).17,48 It appears that plastid gene expression in mutants impaired in translation and/or chloroplast gene expression is mainly under control of the NEP activity, and, to a lesser degree, under post-transcriptional control. Furthermore, NEP and PEP control different sets of genes in opposite senses. The mutant transcriptomes unequivocally demonstrate the predominance of transcriptional control mechanisms in albino mutants of group I presumably all directly or indirectly affected in the expression of the PEP (Fig. 2). Therefore, clustering analysis identified presumably all plastid promoters, which are preferentially transcribed by the two polymerase types.In contrast, as revealed by macroarray and microarray data, clustering of plastid genes of WT plants exposed to various stress and exogenic conditions, which also affect the chloroplast, did not identify two major transcriptionally determined gene clusters, which behave oppositely (Fig. 5A and Supplementary Table S9). Only two out of the six clusters (E and F) that emerged preferentially contain genes transcribed by the NEP and the PEP, respectively. Cluster E and F genes are only oppositely expressed under changing light conditions, indicating that changes in light quantity and quality significantly induce the transcriptional regulation of photosynthetic gene expression mediated predominantly by the activity of the PEP. However, post-transcriptional events are shown to be major determinants of plastid transcript abundance under most environmental changes in Arabidopsis, providing sufficient fine-tuning for adaptation to environmental changes. A similar situation has been proposed previously for some plastid genes in other organisms.57–59 In contrast, transcriptional control by the PEP and post-transcriptional regulation collapses in mutants that are generally and severely affected in chloroplast gene expression, as is the case for the numerous albino mutants of group I with prevalent NEP-induced transcription (Fig. 3A). This might also be the reason why the degree and diversity of expression changes were often less pronounced in mutants affected in chloroplast functions than in WT plants exposed to various stresses (Figs 1 and 2).Post-transcriptional RNA modifications are relevant not only for the control of transcript abundance but also for the generation of spliced, edited, endo- and exonucleolytically cleaved plastid transcripts in order to generate translation-competent mRNAs.21,60,61 Processing of plastid primary transcripts seems to be especially relevant to both transcript abundance and the translatability of individual gene segments of polycistronic mRNAs to fine tune regulation of gene expression independently of transcriptional control. This is supported by our findings that clustering of plastid genes is less prominent determined by transcriptional control under various biological conditions.4.3. ConclusionIn summary, the present report provides a rich source of information with which to investigate the involvement of the chloroplast and the roles of yet unknown nuclear genes in the management of gene expression in this organelle, especially under conditions of abiotic and biotic stresses. The data allude to defined expression programs regulating plastid functions in response to changing environmental conditions. We show that expression profiles can be used to monitor the functional state of the plant and to identify mutants in plastid RNA metabolism, which deviate from the general expression response. Especially the acquisition of a large number of nuclear genes by de novo synthesis and horizontal gene transfer has significantly increased the complexity of plastid RNA metabolism. The high frequency of plant-specific genes that are important for chloroplast RNA homeostasis demonstrates that transcript regulation has shaped the emergence of plant-specific expression systems for components of the plastid.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available online at www.dna.research.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (SFB TR1 Project B2) to JM.We would like to thank Klaus Apel, Ekkehard Neuhaus, Ute Vothknecht, and Peter Westhoff for providing Arabidopsis mutants.Supplementary data"

IntroductionPost-transcriptional regulation of gene expression includes mRNA processing, splicing, editing, transport, stability and translation. Degradation of mRNA is an important component of gene function that controls the steady-state concentration of functional transcript levels in the cell.1 For example, in human mRNA, stability is estimated to control the mRNA level of about 5–10% of all genes.2 Quantification of this process is important for interpretation of gene-expression data obtained with microarrays as well as data from gene manipulation experiments. Changes in gene expression may be delayed by several days if the corresponding transcript is stable. This may cause serious errors in reconstruction of gene regulatory networks.Studies in several organisms revealed that majority of transcripts are stable.3–5 It appeared that the specific half-life of each mRNA is precisely related to its physiological role.4–8 For example, most housekeeping genes have long mRNA half-lives. In contrast, proteins that are required only for limited time in the cell, e.g. at a certain stage of the cell cycle, during development, growth or differentiation or in response to external stimuli, often have mRNAs with short half-lives.9 Transcriptionally inducible genes are disproportionately represented in the class of genes with rapid mRNA turnover.5RNA stability can be altered in response to external stimuli such as hormones10 or various types of stress. For example, response to UV-B exposure leads to stabilization of many short-lived mRNAs in mammalian cells.11 Conversely, in yeast, mild heat shock promotes rapid degradation of mRNAs encoding the ribosomal proteins,12 while glucose starvation, amino acid starvation, or sugar-induced osmotic stress causes stabilization of at least some yeast mRNAs.13–15 Changes in RNA stability can also play an important role during embryonic development or cell differentiation. In plasmodium it has been shown that a major determinant of mRNA decay rate appears to be tightly linked to intra-erythrocytic development cycle, and to a lesser extent the functional category of the mRNAs themselves.16 During primordial germ cells specification of Oryzias latipes (Japanese medaka) some specific RNA molecules are protected from degradation, thus establishing a specific mRNA expression pattern controlled by post-transcriptional mechanisms.17 Expression of a wide variety of transcripts is controlled by changes in mRNA stability during neuronal development.18,19 During muscle differentiation mRNA half-lives for muscle-specific genes—myogenin and myoD—have been shown to be the highest during differentiation, but declines when differentiation is completed.20 Abnormal changes in RNA stability can be a cause of cell malfunction leading to cancer21,22 and other diseases like diabetic nephropathy,22 muscular atrophy,23 neurological disorders such as Alzheimer disease.9Decay of mRNA is controlled by complex mechanisms that are not fully understood. This mechanism is integrated with other mRNA-related molecular processes including transcript elongation, splicing, polyadenylation, transport and translation.6,9 RNA decay mechanisms include interaction between cis-acting elements and trans-acting factors. Major cis-factors affecting decay rates include AU-rich elements (ARE), iron-responsive elements, histone stem-loops, coding region determinants, Jun-kinase response elements, retained introns, and exon junctions.24–26Trans-factors that control mRNA decay include RNAses that are often assembled into exosomes, RNA-binding proteins (poly-A binding, WD40 repeats, ARE-binding), siRNA, miRNA, piRNA. P-bodies in the cytoplasm can facilitate miRNA-mediated mRNA degradation induced by stress, and ribosomes control nonsense-mediated decay (NMD).27 Recent studies have shown that PUF-domain proteins can promote mRNA degradation of genes involved in development via Pop2-mediated deadenylation.28 Binding motif of PUF protein PUM2 has been identified in mouse.29Estimates of mRNA decay rates may depend on the method of measurement. Functional degradation, defined as decrease of the numbers of functional mRNA capable of producing correct protein, should be distinguished from physical degradation (or mass decay), which represents the decrease of mRNA numbers measured by PCR amplification or hybridization intensity.30 Analysis of functional degradation is appropriate for individual genes, but it is not an option for high-throughput analysis targeted at the whole transcriptome. Thus, we will consider only physical degradation of mRNA with understanding that this measurement may not capture some aspects of mRNA function. The most widely used methods for high-throughput analysis of mRNA degradation is based on transcriptional inhibitors, for example by actinomycin D, which inhibits transcription via binding to single-strand DNA at the transcription initiation complex and preventing elongation by RNA polymerase II.31Multiple studies attempted to measure mRNA decay rates in human,3,5 but only one study has relatively large data of 5245 genes in hepatoma cells.4 There are no data for mouse or any other mammals. Among eukaryotes, comparable data have been generated for plasmodium,16 yeast7 and Arabidopsis.32 To obtain baseline data for the mRNA half-life in mouse, we have selected mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. ES cells are often used as experimental models for cell differentiation and for reconstruction of gene regulatory networks. Genes that control mRNA decay rates may also affect the differentiation of ES cells.33 Despite increasing interest in the study of ES cells, there have been no attempts to measure mRNA decay rates in these cells. Here, we have described mRNA half-life of essentially all mouse genes in mouse ES cells.2. Materials and methods2.1. Cell cultureWe used two mouse ESC lines: MC1 derived from mouse strain 129S6/SvEvTac and MC2-B6 derived from strain C57BL/6J. These lines were purchased from The Transgenic Core Laboratory of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine (Baltimore, MD, USA). To remove contaminating feeder cells, ES cells were first cultured for two passages on gelatin-coated culture dish in complete ES medium [DMEM, 15% FBS; Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF) (ESGRO) 1000 U/ml; 1 mM sodium pyruvate; 0.1 mM NEAA, 2 mM glutamate, 0.1 mM ß-mercaptoethanol and penicillin/streptomycin (50 U/50 µg per ml)]. Cells were then seeded in gelatin-coated 6-well plates at the density of 1–2 × 105 cells/well (1–2 × 104/cm2) and cultured for 3 days before the test for mRNA stability. Cells were incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2. Medium was changed daily. Differentiated ES cells were obtained from MC1 cells by LIF withdrawal (complete medium without LIF, below referenced as LIF-) or by retinoic acid (RA) treatment (complete medium with 1 µM RA, below referenced as RA) for 7 days before the test. To measure mRNA stability, transcription was blocked by adding actinomycin D (Sigma, cat # A-9415) to the medium at the concentration of 5 µg/ml. Cells were harvested at 0, 1, 2, 4 and 8 h after addition of actinomycin D.2.2. Microarray experimentsRNA was extracted using Phase lock gel™ (Eppendorf/Brinkman) columns according to the manufacturer’s protocol after adding 1 ml of Trizol™ (Invitrogen) per well. RNA was precipitated with isopropanol, washed with 70% ethanol and dissolved in DEPC dH2O. RNA was hybridized to the NIA Mouse 44K Microarray v2.3 (whole genome 60-mer oligonuleotide probe; manufactured by Agilent Technologies, #014951)34 in duplicate for each cell type and time point. Fluorescently labeled microarray targets were prepared from 2.5 µg aliquots of total RNA samples using a Low RNA Input Fluorescent Linear Amplification Kit (Agilent). A reference target (Cy5-CTP-labeled) was produced from Stratagene Universal Mouse Reference RNA (UMR), and all other targets were labeled with Cy3-CTP. Targets were purified using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, and quantified on a NanoDrop scanning spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies). All hybridizations were carried out by combining a Cy3-CTP-labeled experimental target and a Cy5-CTP-labeled UMR target. Microarrays were hybridized and washed according to Agilent protocol (G4140-90030; Agilent 60-mer oligonucleotide microarray processing protocol—SSC Wash, v1.0). Slides were scanned on an Agilent DNA Microarray Scanner, using standard settings, including automatic photo-multiplier tube adjustment.2.3.

Calibration of microarray signal intensitiesReliable estimation of mRNA degradation rates requires accurate scaling of expression values to ensure that the ratio of hybridization signal intensities is equal to the ratio of mRNA abundance uniformly across the entire range of values. We tested the scaling using a series of dilutions (5×, 1×, 0.2× and 0.04×) of the mRNA pool (obtained from newborn mice of C57BL/6J strain) labeled with Cy3 and hybridized together with the constant amount of the UMR sample labeled with Cy5. Regression of log-transformed Cy3 signals versus log RNA input was close to 1 for most probes with log signal >1.5 (Supplementary Fig. S1), which indicates proper scaling. The results confirmed accurate calibration of intensity signals across the entire range of values.Unexpectedly, Cy5 signals of some probes on the microarray also showed strong positive dependence on RNA input despite the fact that the amount of Cy5-labeled UMR was constant in all the arrays (Supplementary Fig. S2). This effect was observed only when Cy3 signal was much stronger than Cy5 signal. The mechanism of this effect is unknown, but we hypothesize that it stems from the chain hybridization when free ends of Cy3-labeled mRNA bound to probes on the array can hybridize with Cy5-labeled mRNA either non-specifically or via rare antisense segments (termed ‘chain effect’). This effect may cause underestimation of gene expression difference between cell types if values are normalized by UMR signal. To avoid distortion, we did not use UMR for normalization for a small portion of probes where we expected chain effect.Another challenge in interpretation of microarray measurements is that expression values often do not fall below some ‘background’ level, which most likely results from non-specific hybridization. If a gene has low expression and is measured close to probe’s background level, it may show little change in expression value after actinomycin D treatment, which can be erroneously viewed as evidence of high mRNA stability. To avoid these errors, we estimated mRNA decay rates only for sets of data with expression values that were either high, >2.5 in log10 scale, or substantially above the background, >2 fold.2.5. Microarray data analysis by gene ontology termsAnalysis of gene ontology (GO) terms in a selected list of genes was done using the hypergeometric distribution and FDR = 0.05 criterion using NIA Mouse Gene Index (ver. mm8) software.36 Only non-redundant genes with gene symbols were used for analysis. Because many GO categories are redundant (contain similar lists of genes), we adjusted the calculation of FDR in the following way. First, we identified all redundant pairs of GO terms that had a correlation of gene presence =0.7. Second, in the list of GO terms ordered by increasing P-values, pi, estimated from the hypergeometric distribution, GO term i was considered redundant, if it was redundant to at least one preceding term.2.6. Real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reactionTotal RNAs were extracted from ES cells using Trizol™ (Invitrogen) and Phase lock gel™ (Eppendorf/Brinkman) columns according to the manufacturers’ protocols. RNAs were precipitated with isopropanol, washed with 70% ethanol and dissolved in DEPC dH2O. Primers for quantitative reverse transcriptase–PCR (qRT–PCR) were designed using the Vector NTI Advance 9.1 software (Invitrogen) and tested for SYBR Green chemistry using an established in-house protocol.37 Reactions were run on the ABI 7500 Sequence Detection Systems using the default cycling program, and data were processed using SDS 2.2 software (Applied Biosystems). Gene expression levels were normalized to a Cyclin D3 as an internal control and to total RNA amount.3. Results and discussion3.1. Measuring mRNA decay rates in mouse ES cellsTo quantify mRNA decay rates in mouse ES cells we measured changes in gene expression with whole-genome microarrays in a time course (0, 1, 2, 4 and 8 h) after treating cells with actinomycin D. Experiments were done for two ES cell lines—MC1 (129S6/SvEvTac) and MC2-B6 (C57BL/6J) cultured in the standard condition in the presence of LIF. To increase the number of genes that can be assayed, we also carried out the analysis of MC1 ES cells undergoing differentiation into two different culture conditions—in the absence of LIF and in the presence of RA for 7 days. Expression data for all genes are available in Supplementary Table S1. Proper calibration of signal intensities in the full range of gene expression values was confirmed using hybridization of different RNA amounts to microarrays (see details in Section 2.2). Expression values for most genes were normalized using UMR, except for 1824 probes (4.3%) where normalization was not possible because UMR signal was low and unstable (see details in Section 2.4). Decay rates were estimated using linear regression of log-transformed data (Fig. 1A and B) and normalized by average expression change of 200 most stable genes (see details in Section 2.4; Supplementary Table S1).Because the earlier work did not fully address the data reproducibility issue, where analysis was limited to estimating statistical (technical) error and validation of expression measurements by PCR for a small number of genes, we felt that it was important to evaluate the reproducibility of the measurements. To this end, we used the following two methods: (i) comparing mRNA decay rates in two independent experiments with different ES cell lines (MC1 and MC2-B6) cultured in the standard conditions and (ii) comparing mRNA decay rates estimated using different oligonucleotide probes on the microarray for the main transcript of the same gene. The first method yielded very high consistency between estimates of mRNA degradation rate (r = 0.925), indicating biological reproducibility of our database (Fig. 1C). The second method gave somewhat lower match (r = 0.744), but the correlation was still within the range expected from the comparison of gene expression data obtained with different array platforms (Fig. 1D).Discrepancy between mRNA half-lives estimated using different oligonucleotide probes for the same gene was likely related to the biological complexity of mRNA processing rather than to the error in measurement. For example, probes located in 3'-UTR often showed shorter mRNA half-lives than probes located in the open reading frame (ORF) (Supplementary Fig. S3A). This may be caused by either alternative termination of transcription coupled with a differential degradation rate or active mRNA truncation at some early step of mRNA processing. Interestingly, some genes of histone H1 family had the opposite pattern of degradation: probes located in the short 3'-UTR showed longer half-lives than probes located in the ORF (Supplementary Fig. S3B). However, because of a high sequence similarity between histone genes and a partial cross-hybridization of probes, this effect may be an artifact.To validate the microarray data, we carried out qRT–PCR analysis and found that qRT–PCR results matched well to those obtained by DNA microarrays for six out of seven selected genes (Supplementary Fig. S4). An exception was Sox17, whose degradation rates measured by qRT-PCR were much lower than those measured by microarrays. The closer inspection of probe locations revealed that all microarray probes for Sox17 were located in the 3'-UTR of the gene, whereas qRT-PCR primers were located in the ORF. This result was, therefore, consistent with differential degradation rates of Sox21 measured with probes located in 3'-UTR and ORF (Supplementary Fig. S3A).3.2. Effect of alternative transcription and splicing on estimation of RNA stabilityIt is conceivable that the influence of probe locations on the estimation of mRNA stability goes beyond the aforementioned simple difference between 3'-UTR and ORF. For example, oligonucleotide probes recognized different transcripts, which are produced by alternative transcription start sites (TSSs), splicing and polyA signals, may lead to the estimation of different half-lives for the same gene. To determine the effect of alternative transcription and splicing on mRNA stability, we compared decay rates identified with the best probe from the main transcript of each gene with decay rates estimated using other probes that matched the same gene. Probes from alternatively spliced transcripts often showed shorter mRNA half-lives compared with the best probe in the main transcript (Fig. 1E). This effect was strongest for probes located in the retained introns of alternative transcripts. Similar effect of alternative splicing was reported in Arabidopsis; however, it was not statistically significant because of the small number of alternatively spliced forms captured by the array.32 Thus, we, for the first time, statistically confirm that alternative transcripts, especially those with retained introns, have shorter mRNA half-life compared with main transcripts.This phenomenon can be simply explained by the possibility that alternative transcripts have a higher degradation rate due to specific sequences located in retained introns or alternatively spliced exons. Alternatively, it is also possible that the degradation of alternative transcripts appears to be accelerated by the splicing that may continue even after the blocking of transcription by actinomycin D. Because RNAs were extracted from whole cells in our experiments, it may contain heterogeneous nuclear RNA with some retained introns, which are able to hybridize with intron-matching probes in the array. If splicing continues for a while after the blocking of transcription by actinomycin D, the number of heterogeneous nuclear RNA would decrease. Further experiments are needed to distinguish between the two possible mechanisms. All subsequent analysis was done only for main transcripts of each gene. We would like to note that for 1391 genes, mRNA decay rates were not consistent between different microarray probes (>2-fold difference). Therefore, mRNA half-lives for these genes estimated with the best oligonucleotide should be considered with caution (marked by an asterisk in Supplementary Table S2).3.3. General trends in stability of mRNAs in ES cellsWe were able to estimate mRNA half-lives of 19 977 non-redundant genes (Supplementary Table S2). For 14 815 genes, estimates are available for two ES cell lines and three culture conditions. We were not able to estimate mRNA half-lives of 7260 genes due to the low level of expression in ES cells and those of 541 genes due to the lack of acceptable probes in the main transcript. Most of the genes had long half-lives, which was in concordance with published data.3–5 In our analysis, median estimated half-life for all genes was 7.1 h (Fig. 1F), which was less than reported for human hepatoma cells (10 h);4 however, this difference may be related to normalization method, as discussed below (see Section 3.9). In our analysis, only 54 genes (including Prdm1, Myc, Gadd45 g, Foxa2, Hes5 and Trib1) showed a half-life shorter than 1 h. Published data indicate that more genes showed RNA half-life shorter than 30 min.3 Therefore, it is possible that the number of genes with very short mRNA life may be underestimated in our study, because we did not collect samples at the time points earlier than 1 h.3.4. Functional annotation of stable and unstable transcriptsWe analyzed over representation of GO terms in the 610 genes with half-life shorter than 2 h and in 4310 genes with half-life longer than 12 h to identify functional categories of genes with unstable and stable mRNA, respectively (Supplementary Tables S3 and S4). Using GO database and additional information on protein domains, we manually assembled lists of genes with functions that were characteristic to stable and unstable mRNA species (Supplementary Table S2). The major functional categories of genes with unstable mRNA were ‘Regulation of transcription’, ‘Cell cycle’, ‘Apoptosis’, ‘Signal transduction’ and ‘Development’, whereas the major functional categories of genes with stable mRNA were ‘Metabolism’, ‘Protein biosynthesis’, ‘Extracellular matrix’ and ‘Cytoskeleton’ (Fig. 1G). Most of these results confirm findings published earlier;4,5,32 however, overrepresentation of ‘Extracellular matrix’ and ‘Cytoskeleton’ groups among stable mRNA species is reported here for the first time. Many transcription factors showed very short mRNA half-life, which may be important for the quick expression changes of target genes. Genes with half-life from 1 to 2 h (n = 557) included early response and cell cycle regulation and also some genes important for pluripotency and early development: for example, Sox2, Klf4, Foxd3, Sox7, Nodal, Ctgf, Id1, Id2, Id3 and Wnt signaling.3.5. Strain-dependent stability of mRNAIn the previous study, we have shown that there are genes differentially expressed between ES cells derived from 129 mouse stain and ES cells derived from C57BL/6 mouse strain (strain-specific signature genes).38 We, therefore, asked if the observed differences were related to differences in mRNA half-life of corresponding genes. We found that a small number of genes (n = 92) had statistically significant differences in mRNA decay rates between MC1 (129S6/SvEvTac) and MC2-B6 (C57BL/6J) ES cells (FDR <0.05 and >2-fold change of half-life) (Supplementary Table S5) and only 10 of these genes overlapped with strain-specific signature genes. Although differential gene expression of at least some strain-specific genes can be explained partially by differences in mRNA stability, we were not able to identify correlation between differential gene expression and mRNA stability between strains on a global scale.3.6. Alteration of mRNA half-life in differentiating ES cellsDifferentiation of ES cells in the absence of LIF or in the presence of RA caused changes in mRNA stability in a large set of genes (n = 3332 in LIF- and n = 2257 in RA) (Fig. 2A and B, Supplementary Tables S6 and S7). These changes were much stronger than the strain difference in mRNA stability between MC1 and MC2-B6 ES cells (Fig. 1C). In general, decay rates of mRNA increased after LIF withdrawal: the median half-life declined from 7.07 to 5.48 h; and out of 3332 genes with significant change of mRNA stability, 77.9% had increased decay rates compared with undifferentiated ES cells (Fig. 2A and C). In contrast, differentiation of ES cells in RA conditions caused a general increase of mRNA stability: the median half-life increased from 7.07 to 8.60 h; and out of 2257 genes with significant change of mRNA stability, 87.1% had decreased decay rates compared with undifferentiated ES cells (Fig. 2B and C). This indicates a substantial difference between two protocols of ES cell differentiation. But despite these global differences, gene-specific changes in mRNA stability in these differentiating ES cells showed a good correlation: the change in decay rates of mRNA (in log scale) in RA conditions was positively correlated with the change of decay rates (in log scale) in LIF- conditions (r = 0.593) (Supplementary Fig. S5A). This means that changes in mRNA decay rates can be viewed as a superposition of two effects: (i) gene-specific effect that is consistent between LIF- and RA conditions and (ii) non-specific effect associated with the culture medium that caused general decrease in stability in LIF- conditions and general increase in mRNA stability in RA conditions.Change in mRNA decay rates in ES cells after differentiation. (A) Change of mRNA decay rates after 7 days of differentiation in LIF- conditions; significant changes (FDR <0.05 and >2-fold change of half-life) is shown by red and green dots; rates are log-transformed, log10(d + 0.1).

(A) Change of mRNA decay rates after 7 days of differentiation in LIF- conditions; significant changes (FDR <0.05 and >2-fold change of half-life) is shown by red and green dots; rates are log-transformed, log10(d + 0.1).

(C) Frequency distribution of mRNA half-life in undifferentiated MC1 cells (LIF+) compared with cells differentiated after LIF withdrawal (LIF-) and retinoic acid (RA) treatment. (D) Half-life of mRNA of genes associated with pluripotent state of ES cells in undifferentiated cells (LIF+) and upon differentiation (LIF- and RA).To select genes whose mRNA were either destabilized or stabilized in differentiated cells in both LIF- and RA conditions, we used one standard deviation cut-off of log decay rates (Supplementary Fig. S5A). Genes with increased rate of mRNA decay upon differentiation were enriched in GO terms ‘transcription regulation’, ‘nervous system development’, ‘apoptosis’, ‘ubiquitin cycle’, ‘ribosome’ (mostly mitochondrial ribosomal proteins), ‘chromatin binding’ and ‘methyltransferase activity’ (Supplementary Table S8). Genes with decreased rate of mRNA decay upon differentiation were enriched in GO terms ‘extracellular space’, ‘extracellular matrix’, ‘calcium ion binding’, ‘actin cytoskeleton’ and ‘lysosome’ (Supplementary Table S9). During the ES cell differentiation, unstable mRNA species became even less stable, whereas stable mRNA species became more stable (Supplementary Fig. S5B).It is believed that in general the differentiation of ES cells is associated with destabilization of pluripotency-related genes and stabilization of lineage-specific genes. Indeed, our data showed that mRNAs of some pluripotency-related genes (Sall4, Eed, Esrrb, Notch4, Mras, Tbx3, Btbd14b and Sap30) were destabilized upon differentiation (Fig. 2D). Interestingly, the strongest increase in mRNA decay rate was observed for Btbd14b (Nac1), which is a known cofactor of NANOG and POU5F1 proteins.39,40 Similarly, mRNAs of some differentiation-related genes (e.g. Bmp1, Acta1, Igfbp1, Igfbp4, Igfbp6, Frzb, Cited1, Flt1, Slit2, Krt8, Krt14, Cnn1, Mest, Wnt3 and Amot) were stabilized. On the other hand, the change in mRNA stability for all genes had no correlation with the change in gene expression levels (Supplementary Fig. S5C and D), indicating that mRNA stability has no global role in controlling gene expression changes during ES cells differentiation.One way to control mRNA degradation is to modulate the expression levels of particular ribonucleases. In metazoans, it is known that the modulation of the expression of ribonucleases and/or associated factors play an important role in the control of mRNA stability during development.6 It has also been shown that many ribonucleases and associated factors are differentially regulated during development. For example, in Drosophila, the expression of ribonucleases pacman/XRN1, twister/SKI2 and tazman/DIS3/RRP44, varies during development at both RNA and protein levels.41–43 We, therefore, focused on genes that are involved in the mRNA degradation or binding and found that 103 genes changed their expression at >2-fold between undifferentiated and differentiated ES cells (Supplementary Table S10). The multiplicity of mRNA degradation pathways makes it difficult to relate expression of these genes with observed patterns of mRNA degradation. However, we noted that the expression levels of Lsm3, Lsm5, Lsm6, Lsm7, Lsm12, Lsmd1, Cnot4, Cnot10, Dcp2, Exosc1, which are known to promote mRNA degradation, decreased in the differentiated ES cells, especially in the RA condition. This may explain increased stability of mRNA in cells differentiated in the RA condition. In contrast, degradation-promoting genes—Zfp36l1 and Cnot6l—showed increased expression in differentiated ES cells, which may have contributed to lower mRNA stability in the LIF- condition, but it does not explain increased mRNA stability in the RA condition.3.7. Multivariate analysis of gene structural features that affect mRNA stabilityDecay rates of mRNA vary substantially between genes (Fig. 1F); however, little is known about factors and mechanisms responsible for these differences. Two major structural factors that affect mRNA stability are known: (i) the presence of introns in genes (i.e. multi-exon genes), which makes mRNA more stable;44 and (ii) the presence of AREs in the 3'-UTR of genes, which makes mRNA less stable.45,46 However, all the previous results have been obtained using single-factor analysis, which may easily lead to erroneous conclusions if factors are correlated. We, therefore, used multivariate regression analysis, which helps to distinguish direct causal effects from mere correlations. We incorporated as many structural characteristics of genes as possible, including the length of ORF, the length of 5'-UTR, the length of 3'-UTR, the number of exons, the occurrence of different kinds of ARE, the presence of CpG di-nucleotides and the presence of PUF binding motifs in all parts of the transcript (Supplementary Table S11). AREs were detected by using three types of reported consensus sequences: AUUUA (ARE1), UUAUUUAWW (ARE2), WWWUAUUUAUWWW (ARE3)45,47 and non-specific A/U 12-mers with no more than one mismatch (ARE4). We used UGUANAUA as PUF consensus motifs.29,48,49 CpG elements were added to the list after we unexpectedly found that they can affect mRNA stability. We did not analyze the effects of miRNA on the mRNA stability, because it would require extensive data mining and integration with the existing miRNA databases.Multiple regression analysis showed that mRNA stability was correlated positively with the number of exons and negatively with the ORF length, number of ARE2, ARE4 and PUF in 3'-UTR, number of ARE4 and PUF in ORF, and number of CpG di-nucleotides in 5'-UTR (Supplementary Table S11). The effect of ORF length was nearly equal to the effect of the number of exons with the opposite sign, which indicated that the number of exon junctions per unit ORF length may be a better predictor of mRNA stability than the number of exons per gene. This is also supported by the fact that most exon junctions are located in the ORF region of genes. Indeed, log-transformed rate of mRNA decay correlated stronger with log-transformed number of exon junctions per unit ORF length (r = -0.326) than with log-transformed number of exons (r = -0.111). Therefore, below we always used the ratio of exon junctions per 1 kb of ORF length as a predictor of mRNA stability.According to the regression equation [Equation (2)], we conclude that the number of exon junctions per unit ORF length shows the strongest and the most consistent effect on mRNA stability between cells types. This conclusion is further supported by the alternative data presentation shown in Fig. 3A. The proportion of genes with =5 exon junctions per unit ORF length was higher in genes with longer mRNA half-life, whereas the proportion of genes associated with the destabilizing factors (CpG di-nucleotides in 5'-UTR, and ARE4 and PUF in 3'-UTR) was higher in genes with shorter mRNA half-life (Fig. 3A). Although the role of introns in stability of mRNA has been reported both in experimental and statistical studies,44 here we present the first evidence that the number of exon junctions per unit ORF length is the most important known structural factor that increases mRNA stability. After intron is excised by spliceosome, the exon junction location is marked by binding of the exon junction complex (EJC), which consists of at least 10 proteins.50 EJC remains bound to mRNA after transport to cytoplasm, can stimulate translation, and mediate NMD of mRNA during the pioneer round of translation.50 It is indeed possible that some components of EJC can remain bound to mRNA after the first round of translation and decrease the rate of mRNA degradation.44 But the mechanism of this process remains unknown.Effect of structural and functional characteristics of genes on the rate of mRNA decay. (A) Proportion of genes with increased number of exon junctions, CpG di-nucleotides in 5'-UTR, and ARE4 and PUF motifs in 3'-UTR in groups of genes with different range of mRNA half-life.

(C) Correlation between functional characteristics of genes and abundance of structural elements (log-transformed).According to the regression equation [Equation (2)], the second strongest factor affecting the mRNA stability was the number of PUF motifs in 3'-UTR, which decreased the mRNA stability. The third strongest factor affecting the mRNA stability was the presence of AREs. Unexpectedly, the sequence non-specific ARE4 in 3'-UTR (to a smaller extent, in ORF) decreased mRNA half-life more strongly than the consensus-matching AREs. Among different consensus matching AREs, only ARE2 in 3'-UTR showed a significant effect on mRNA stability. Several mechanisms are known to be involved in ARE-mediated mRNA degradation. For example, ARE-binding proteins can recruit PARN or exosomes.51 It is also known that the stability of mRNA can be modified by immune factors via AREs in 3'-UTR.52The fourth strongest factor that affects mRNA stability was the number of CpG di-nucleotides in 5'-UTR. Because this was not known before, this is indeed the first report about the effect of CpG di-nucleotides on the mRNA stability. We suspected that the occurrence of CpG di-nucleotides in 5'-UTR may be correlated with the presence of CpG islands at TSS. We, therefore, estimated the number of CpG di-nucleotides near TSS (from -400 to +600 bp) and included it into the regression analysis. We found that the numbers of CpG di-nucleotides in 5'-UTR appeared to have a 5-fold stronger effect on mRNA stability than their numbers in the CpG island adjacent to TSS (Supplementary Table S12), which indicates that CpG di-nucleotides need to be located within 5'-UTR to affect mRNA decay. The mechanism of this effect is unknown, but considering a strong effect of splicing on mRNA stability we can hypothesize that it may be mediated by methyl CpG-binding proteins that regulate splicing.53We have, thus far, shown that both functional categories of genes (Section 3.4) and the structural features of genes (this section) affect the mRNA stability. It will be, thus, interesting to see which factors affect mRNA stability more strongly. To this end, we carried out the regression analysis after including both structural features and functional categories (Fig. 3B, Supplementary Table S13). Among functional groups of genes, the strongest destabilizing effect was shown in the category of ‘Regulation of transcription’ followed by ‘Signal transduction’ and ‘Cell cycle’. In contrast, ‘Metabolism’, ‘Extracellular matrix’ and ‘Cytoskeleton’ functional categories increased mRNA stability, which is consistent with our previous results (Fig. 1G). However, we found that all the effects of structural factors listed in Equation (2) remained strong and statistically significant, and the sign of regression coefficients did not change after adding functional gene categories. This indicates that the stability of mRNAs is more significantly correlated with the structural features of genes than the function of genes.Furthermore, the differential mRNA stability in various functional groups of genes can be partially explained by structural features of genes. For example, low stability of mRNA among genes in the functional category of ‘Regulation of transcription’ and ‘Development’ can be explained by the low number of exon junctions per ORF length and high number of ARE4 and PUF in 3'-UTR and CpG in 5'-UTR (Fig. 3C). Similarly, high stability of mRNA among genes in the category of ‘Metabolism’ can be explained by the high number of exon junctions per ORF length and low number of ARE4 and PUF in 3'-UTR and CpG in 5'-UTR (Fig. 3C). However, several functional categories of genes (e.g. ‘Regulation of transcription’ or ‘Extracellular matrix’) had a significant effect on mRNA stability based on regression (Fig. 3B). This indicates that the effect of gene function cannot fully be explained by structural characteristics of transcripts included in the regression.As mentioned above, differentiation of ES cells in both LIF- and RA conditions caused changes in mRNA stability in a large set of genes (Fig. 3A and B, Supplementary Tables S6 and S7). To identify structural and functional factors that affected these global changes in mRNA stability, we compared the coefficients of multiple regression that related decay rates (log scale) with various factors in undifferentiated and differentiated ES cells in LIF- and RA conditions (Fig. 3B, Supplementary Table S13). Degradation-promoting effects of CpG di-nucleotides in 5'-UTR and ARE in 3'-UTR appeared much stronger in cells differentiated in the LIF- condition compared with undifferentiated cells and cells differentiated in the RA condition. Cells differentiated in the RA condition had weaker degradation-promoting effects of ARE4 in 3'-UTR than in undifferentiated cells. These effects may explain the increased mRNA decay rates in ES cells differentiated in LIF- and the decreased decay rates in ES cells differentiated in the RA condition. Protection of mRNA from degradation by exon junctions was stronger in both types of differentiated ES cells than in undifferentiated cells.3.9. Comparison with human dataInterspecies comparison of mRNA decay rates has been done only among distant evolutionary lineages (plant, yeast and human). The new mouse data set provides an opportunity to compare the two mammalian species: mouse and human. Using Homologene database54 we identified 4153 pairs of orthologous genes for which mRNA rates were estimated both in mouse (this study) and human (Supplementary Table S3). For compatibility with our data, we converted estimates of mRNA decay rates in human from log2 to loge. Because human data are normalized using ß-actin, whose mRNA is not highly stable (based on our data), a large set of human genes (11.6%) shows negative degradation rates.4 We, therefore, re-normalized the estimates of human mRNA decay rates using the method we used for mouse (by average decay rate of 200 genes with most stable mRNA). Median rate of mRNA decay for all orthologous genes in mouse (d = 0.098 h-1) was lower than in human (d = 0.137 h-1). Because these experiments differed not just in species (i.e. mouse versus human), but also in cell types (ES cells versus hepatoma), and were done in different laboratories using different microarray platforms, it was impossible to attribute this difference to any specific factor. However, correlation between mRNA decay rates in mouse and human was high (r = 0.610, Fig. 4), which was only slightly lower than correlation between estimates of mRNA decay rates obtained with different probes that matched the same mouse transcript (r = 0.744, see Section 3.1). This finding indicates that pathways of mRNA degradation are mostly conserved between mammalian species. Interestingly, mRNA decay rates in human hepatoma were more similar to decay rates in differentiated ES cells (r = 0.605 for LIF- and r = 0.616 for RA) than to decay rates in undifferentiated ES cells (r = 0.534, SE = 0.013, P = 0.0001). This may be explained by the fact that hepatoma cells are differentiated and, thus, the profile of mRNA decay rate in hepatoma matched better with that in differentiated ES cells. However, this similarity needs to be confirmed with further experiments that use the same cell types in both species.Comparison of mRNA decay rates for orthologous genes in mouse ES cells and in human hepatocytes (from the reference4) Rates are log-transformed, log10(d + 0.1). Human mRNA decay rates were re-normalized using average decay rate of 200 most unstable mRNA species for proper comparison.Comparison of mRNA decay rates for orthologous genes in mouse ES cells and in human hepatocytes (from the reference4) Rates are log-transformed, log10(d + 0.1). Human mRNA decay rates were re-normalized using average decay rate of 200 most unstable mRNA species for proper comparison.3.10. ConclusionIn this paper we present a whole-genome analysis of mRNA decay rates in mouse ES cells. Decay rates were reliably measured for 19 977 non-redundant genes from time course of microarray data in undifferentiated ES cells originated from different mouse strains and in differentiated ES cells obtained by LIF withdrawal (LIF-) or RA treatment. The novelty of this study can be summarized as follows: (i) this is the first study of mRNA decay rates in mouse. (ii) This is the first study of mRNA decay rates in ES cells of any mammalian species. (iii) We have analyzed the difference in mRNA decay rates between cells derived from two different mouse strains and between undifferentiated and differentiated cells. (iv) The set of genes for which mRNA decay rates estimated is 3.8 times larger than in the most extensive earlier study for human. (v) Close match between data from different cell lines has confirmed high reproducibility of mRNA decay rate estimates. (vi) The microarrays have been calibrated. (vii) We have applied multivariate statistics for the analysis of factors affecting mRNA decay rates, which identifies direct effects and distinguishes them from mere correlations. (viii) We have explored the effect of various structural features of transcripts and gene function on mRNA stability in both general and during ES cell differentiation. The major result is that the number of exon junctions per ORF is the strongest factor promoting mRNA stability, whereas decay is promoted by CpG di-nucleotides in 5'-UTR region as well as by non-canonical ARE (without specific consensus sequence) in 3'-UTR and in ORF. We believe that the presented data on mRNA decay rates provides a valuable resource for future experiments in interpreting various gene manipulation and gene expression studies as well as the computational modeling and simulation on gene regulatory networks.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available online at www.dna.research.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThe work was supported by the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute on Aging, NIH (Z01 AG000656).Supplementary data"

IntroductionCell cycle progression is regulated and controlled by a range of mechanisms including protein modification, targeted proteolytic degradation and cell cycle-specific transcription.1 Genes whose expression levels peak at a specific event of the cell cycle are often required to regulate the processes that occur at these stages.2 In the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, of ~6000 genes, ~400–800 have transcript levels that oscillate during the cell cycle,3,4 whereas in the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, of ~5000 genes, ~400–750 such genes have been found.5–7 In human cancer cell line (HeLa), among a total of 22 000 genes, >1000 are regulated by the cell cycle.8,9 These studies of periodic genes suggest that only the 112th orthologue group is cyclic and common among human cells, as well as budding and fission yeast cells.10 Those taking part in the cell cycle progression include the cyclin B homologs, CDC5, SCH9, DSK2 and ZPR1. Proteins involved in DNA replication include histones, some checkpoint kinases and some proteins regulating DNA damage and repair. Many groups of genes related to translation and other metabolic processes are also cyclic in all three organisms.10 In Arabidopsis thaliana, of ~25 000 genes, ~500 cell cycle regulated genes have been identified.11 In tobacco BY-2, of the ~10 000 genes that could be analyzed by cDNA–AFLP-based gene profiling, ~1300 were regulated by the cell cycle.12Cell proliferation needs division and partitioning of organelles such as mitochondria and plastids. However, there is no information on periodic gene expressions with respect to mitochondrial division in yeast or animal cells. Furthermore, in the research of the periodic expression in A. thaliana or tobacco BY-2, mitochondrial and plastid divisions were not shown. Mammalian, plant and yeast cells contain many organelles whose divisions occur at random, cannot be synchronized and have shapes that are very diverse and complicated.13 Therefore, genes related to such organelles are not reflected in microarray analyses of the cell cycle in higher organisms. In previous cell cycle studies, the analysis has been based on nuclear proliferation only. Eukaryotic cells, however, have double-membrane-bound organelles, such as the nucleus, mitochondria and plastids, and single-membrane-bound organelle such as ER, the Golgi body, vacuoles (lysosomes) and microbodies. Organelle proliferation is very important for cell functions, as well as differentiation and cell division. However, there are few studies that have investigated the organelle proliferation cycle.The unicellular red alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae has advantages for investigating organelle proliferation as it has a minimum set of organelles,14–16 and organelle division can be synchronized by a light/dark cycle.17 The mitochondrial and plastid division requires the FtsZ,18,19 the Dynamin20,21 and the MD/PD rings.22,23 Northern blot analysis has shown that each transcriptional level of ftsz1 for mitochondrial division, and ftsZ2 for the plastid division, has a peak per cell cycle before each division.18 Moreover, nuclear, mitochondrial and plastid genomes of C. merolae have completely been sequenced.24–27 As the nucleus genome 4775 ORF's coding protein includes 27 introns only, newly designed proteins by alternative splicing are few; therefore, the functioning protein is directly identified as the same gene. Furthermore, most ORFs do not have paralogues.24 We thought that novel organelle division-related genes like ftsZ genes could be found by genome-wide transcriptome of the cell cycle.2. Materials and methods2.1. Synchronous culture and fluorescence microscopyCyanidioschyzon merolae 10D-14 were synchronized according to the method discussed in Suzuki et al.17 Cells were cultured in 2× Allen's medium at pH 2.3. Flasks were shaken under continuous light (40 W/m2) at 42°C. The cells were sub-cultured to <107 cells/mL, and then synchronized by subjecting them to a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle at 42°C while the medium was aerated. For the observation of DNA, the cells were fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde diluted with 2× Allen's medium and stained with 1 µg/mL DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole phosphate). Images were viewed using an epifluorescence microscope (BX51; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) with 3CCD digital camera (C77780; Hamamatsu Photonics, Tokyo, Japan) under ultraviolet excitation. The cultures were harvested every 2 h, and indexes of organelle division were counted.2.2. Reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reactionCells were collected by centrifuging at 1400g for 3 min and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Nuclear acid isolation buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH7.6, 100 mM EDTA, 300 mM NaCl, 4% SDS, 2% N-lauroylsarcosine sodium salt) pre-warmed at 60°C was added to the frozen cell pellets. The lysate was added to an equal volume of PCI (phenol:chloroform:isoamylalcohol = 25:24:1). The aqueous phase was recovered by centrifuging at 15 000g for 5 min at 4°C and re-extracted using PCI. Total nucleus acid was precipitated by adding an equal volume of isopropanol and recovered by centrifugation at 15 000g for 15 min at 4°C. The pellet was melted in DNase I solution (0.1 U/µL DNase I, RNase Free; Roshe, 0.4 U/µL RNase Inhibitor; Sigma, 10 mM DTT, 10 mM MgCl2) and incubated for 45 min at 37°C. Total RNA was precipitated by adding an equal volume of isopropanol and recovered by centrifugation at 15 000g for 15 min at 4°C.The RNA samples were reverse-transcribed in 20 µL of the reaction mix comprising 1 µL of Reverse Transcriptase XL (AMV; TaKaRa Bio Inc.), 50 ng/µL of oligo(dT) primer (Novagen), 2 U/µL of RNase inhibitor and 0.5 mM dNTP mixture (TaKaRa Bio Inc.). The reaction conditions were as follows: 10 min at 25°C, 45 min at 42°C and 10 min at 70°C. Absence of genomic DNA contamination was confirmed by PCR in all the total RNA samples. In the RT–PCR assay, cDNA of ftsZ2-1, ftsZ2-2 and the housekeeping gene ef-1a were amplified by 22 PCR cycles. The quantity of PCR products was analyzed by electrophoresis in 2% agarose gel. The primers used in PCR were described in Supplementary Table S1.2.3. Microarray manufactureOn the basis of the annotated C. merolae genome, we ordered synthesis of the ORF-specific oligonucleotides for Sigam Genosys and searched a unique 50-mer sequence for each of the 4586 ORF-coding protein genes (>96% of the ORFs in the nucleus genome). In brief, 50-mer sequences were first selected from ORF sequences based on a set of criteria that included Tm of 75 ± 10°C. Ninety-eight percent of the ORFs-specific oligonucleotides were selected among 1.5 kb from the 3' end of the ORF. All the oligonucleotides were synthesized (Sigma Genosys), resuspended into 30% (v/v) DMSO and spotted onto poly-lysine–coated glass slides, using a spotting machine (SPBIO, Hitachi Software Engineering Co.). Methods of spotting were referred to the protocol of the Brown lab in Stanford University (http://cmgm.stanford.edu/pbrown/). Spotted microarray glasses were stored at room temperature in a dry cabinet for later use.2.4. aRNA fluorescence labelingAmino-allyl aRNA was synthesized using an Amino-Allyl MessageAmp aRNA Kit (Ambion, TX, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. It was transcribed in the presence of amino-allyl dUTP by templating double-strand cDNA synthesized using T7 oligo(dT) primer. Cy3- or Cy5-congugated aRNA was prepared by mixing Cy (GE Healthcare 1vial/45ul dissolved in DMSO) and 5 µg amino-allyl aRNA in coupling buffer (0.1 M NaHCO3, pH 9.0), incubating for 60 min at 40°C and then purified by a Bio Spin-Column (Bio-Rad) and microcon-YM30 spin-column (Millipore).2.5. Microarray hybridizationHybridization solution (5× SSC, 0.5% SDS, 4× Denhalt's solution, 10% formamid, 100 ng/µL Salmon Sperm DNA) and Cy3-congugated aRNA was hybridized to spotted microarray slides covered with a coverglass (Matsunami) in a slide hybridization chamber (Sigma) for 18 h at 55°C. Hybridized slides were washed in 1× SSC/0.03% SDS for 6 min at 45°C, followed by 0.2× SSC for 5 min and 0.05× SSC for 4 min, and then spin-dried before scanning.2.6. Microarray data miningMicroarray slides were scanned using an FLA-8000 scanner (FujiFilm) at a wavelength of 532 and 635 nm in the 5-µm resolution. Gene Spot signals on microarray images were measured by the microarray analyzing software ArrayGauge Ver.2 (FujiFilm). As for data at each time point, it was subtracted the average value from 2 to 50 h. Data were analyzed by microarray data mining software AVADIS (Hitachi software). To collect cell cycle expression genes, hierarchical clustering was performed. In hierarchical clustering analysis for gene direction, the distance metric and linkage rule were set for Euclidean and Complete, respectively. Cell cycle regulated genes collected by hierarchical clustering analysis were separated into four groups by K-means clustering. In K-Means clustering analysis for gene direction, distance metric and four number of clusters and numbers of iterations were set for Euclidean, 4 and 50, respectively.3. Results and discussion3.1. Synchronization of the cell nucleus, mitochondrial and plastid divisions in C. merolaeOrganelle division in C. merolae can be synchronized by a light dark cycle.17 Fig. 1A shows typical interphase and mitotic cells fixed at 8 and 18 h after the start of the synchronous culture. Interphase cells had one cell nucleus, a mitochondrial nucleus (nucleoid) and one spherical plastid, whereas mitotic cells contained a dividing cell nucleus, mitochondrion and plastid. On the basis of the previous and present observations, these divisions are illustrated relative to the cell cycle in Fig. 1B. The type I cell is in the G1-phase in which the nucleus is spherical, the mitochondrion flat and the plastid (chloroplast) cup-shaped (Fig. 1BI). Type II cells in the G2-phase contain a cell nucleus that is larger than type I, and a plastid whose volume is increased, indicating that division has been initiated (Fig. 1BII). In type III cells, the M-phase is initiated and the nucleus begins to form a football-like structure. Mitochondrial division begins and plastid division is more advanced. The microbody has moved to the region of mitochondrial division (Fig. 1BIII). In type IV cells, organelle divisions are more advanced (Fig. 1BIV). In type V cells, the mitochondrion remains as a single body and its division is still not finished, while the plastid has divided in two (Fig. 1BV). In type VI cells, the cell nucleus is dividing without chromosome condensation, the mitochondrion dividing prior to cell nuclear separation, and the microbody is dividing (Fig. 1BVI). In type VII, cytokinesis has been initiated after cell nuclear separation and microbody division (Fig. 1AVII). Therefore, types II–IV, III–V and III–VI cells show plastid, mitochondrial and cell nuclear division, respectively.Synchronous culture of C. merolae.

(D) RT–PCR assay during the first synchronized organelle division.In synchronized culture, the cells were taken at 2 h intervals for a period of 50 h to ensure that at least two complete cell cycles were covered. Fig. 1C shows the index of cell nuclear, mitochondrial and plastid division, counted according to shape of the cell in Fig 1B. The main period of plastid division took 4 h, from 16 to 20 h and from 34 to 38 h (Fig. 1C). Mitochondrial division took place about 3.5 h, from 17 to 20.5 h and from 35 to 38 h, and nuclear division took place about 3.5 h, from 17 to 21 h and 35.5 to 38 h (Fig. 1C). The mitotic cycle phase was defined by observing the change in nuclear morphology. An increase in cell nuclear volume in the S-phase occurred from 12 to 15 h and from 31 to 34 h, and the cell nuclear division period (M-phase) occurred from 17 to 21 h and 35.5 to 38 h (Fig. 2C).Scattered plot of transcriptional levels at 14 and 22 h in microarray analysis. The color circle indicated green <0.5-fold = blue < 2-fold = red. The values, 0.5 and 2, is the ratio of (signal at 14 h/signal at 22 h). Red, blue and green circles showed the genes were induced, constantly expressed and suppressed at 14 h, respectively. The yellow circles indicated ftsZ1-1, ftsZ1-2, ftsZ2-1, ftsZ2-2, cmdnm1 and cmdnm2. In addition to ftsZ2-1and ftsZ2-2, cmdnm2 and ftsZ1-1 were confirmed to be induced at 14 h. ftsZ1-2 and cmdnm1 did not show changes remarkably.Scattered plot of transcriptional levels at 14 and 22 h in microarray analysis.

In addition to ftsZ2-1and ftsZ2-2, cmdnm2 and ftsZ1-1 were confirmed to be induced at 14 h. ftsZ1-2 and cmdnm1 did not show changes remarkably.To confirm whether organelle division genes were induced in the synchronous culture, the change of transcriptional level ftsZ2 was analyzed by the RT–PCR assay at 12, 14, 16, 18, 20 and 22 h during the first cell division. ftsZ2, which is involved in plastid division, is an excellent marker for timing-specific gene expression.18 There are two paralogues of ftsZ2, ftsZ2-1/CMS361C and ftsZ2-2/CMS004C, each transcriptional level of ftsZ2-1 and ftsZ2-2 had a peak at 14 h, and then was lowest at 22 h (Fig. 1D). This result showed that most genes related to organelle division were expressed synchronously at 14 h in late S-phase. Therefore, microarray analysis was performed in the synchronous culture.3.2. Detection of organelle division genes by microarray analysisMicroarray of C. merolae can identify 4586 genes for >96% of all known and predicted C. merolae gene-coding proteins. We tested whether the microarray could analyze the induction of organelle division genes. Microarray analysis between 14 and 22 h showed that ftsZ2-1 and ftsZ2-2 were strongly induced at 14 h (Fig. 2). Moreover, expressions of cmdnm2 involved in plastid division, and ftsZ1-1 involved in mitochondrial division, were stronger at 14 h compared with 22 h. ftsZ1-2 did not show a remarkable induction, but its expression was slightly stronger at 14 h compared with 22 h. Expression of cmdnm1 that was constantly expressed during the cell cycle20 showed a constant expression and was found to be near the diagonal showing constant expression. These results were consistent with previous experiments and showed that the microarray could analyze time-specific gene expression.3.3. Identification of genes induced during S-, G2- and M-phases by microarray analysisThe microarray analysis of two cell cycles from 2 to 50 hrs, in addition to the previously known periodic genes such as ftsZ1 and ftsZ2, identified 358 cell cycle-regulated genes by hierarchical clustering. They were classified by K-means clustering analysis into four expression patterns, early G1 group, late G1 group, S group and G2-M group. This grouping showed that ftsZ2 and cmdnm2 were strongly induced in the S- and G2-M phases, respectively (Fig. 3A and B). Therefore, in the present study, as the genes related to cell nuclear and organelle division were induced during the S- and G2-M phases, we focused on the genes grouped into these category.Heatmaps and oscillations of genes in S or G2-M groups. (Aa) The heatmap of transcriptional levels of genes in the S-phase group. Genes correspond to the rows, and the time points form the columns. Red and green indicate induction and suppression of genes expression, respectively. (Ab) The oscillations of transcriptional levels in the S-phase group. This group contained ftsZ2-1 and ftsZ2-2.

Twelve genes were related to cell cycle progression such as cyclin E2/CML219C, cdk2/CMH128C and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2/CMS304C. 51 genes were related to cell nuclear function such as DNA replication, and chromosome segregation and organization. The genes characteristically induced were: DNA replication; pcna/CMS101C, mcm3/CMH264C and mcm6/CMJ261C, chromosome segregation; a-tubulin /CMT504C,28 ß-tubulin /CMN263C and <U+03B3>-tubulin /CMN304C, chromosome organization; histone gene set and smc4/CME029C. In addition to the nucleus, genes related to mitochondria and plastids could be identified. 5 genes were related to mitochondrial function. ftsZ1-1, ftsZ1-2 and mda129 were involved in mitochondrial division; moreover, the outer mitochondrial membrane protein, porin/CMO111C and NADH dehydrogenase I (Complex I) beta subcomplex 7/CMC099C, were also induced. 5 genes were related to plastid function. ftsZ2-1, ftsZ2-2 and cmdnm2/CMN262C were involved in chloroplast division. 2 plastid terminal oxidases/CMI243C and CMI244C were also induced. 3 genes, including vps29/CMR405, Rab family protein/CMF181C and CMQ189C, related to vesicle trafficking were induced, and they might be involved in the partitioning of the ER, the Golgi body and endosome.List of genes induced during S or G2-M phaseGene ID and Annotation were shown by the C. merolae genome project. Phase refers to phase when transcriptional level had peaks in microarray analysis, Fold describes log2(max - min of transcriptional levels); Ev, expect value by SMART or Conserved domain search (CDs).List of genes induced during S or G2-M phaseGene ID and Annotation were shown by the C. merolae genome project. Phase refers to phase when transcriptional level had peaks in microarray analysis, Fold describes log2(max - min of transcriptional levels); Ev, expect value by SMART or Conserved domain search (CDs).The changes in ftsZ2-1 and ftsZ2-2 transcription levels in the microarray analysis were consistent with those in the RT–PCR assay, supporting effective microarray detection of the change of gene expressions. The expression pattern of some genes, strongly induced in the S or G2-M phases, were analyzed by real-time RT–PCR assay. ftsz2-2, pcna, cyclin E2, cyclinA/CMI203C and smc1/CMI192C, which were assigned to the S-phase by microarray analysis, peaked in the late S-phase (Fig. 3C). cmdnm2, a-tubulin, histone H1/CMN183C, cyclinB/CMI227C, cdk2/CMH128C, smc4/CME029C, condensin kleisin I subunit/CMF069C, which were assigned to the G2-M phase, peaked in the G2- or M-phase (Fig. 3D). These results also supported the accuracy of microarray data in the present analysis.In the division of the mitochondria and plastids, it is very important that ftsZ1-1, ftsZ1-2, mda1, ftsZ2-1, ftsZ2-2 and cmdnm2 have been identified in the S- or G2/M-phase groups. mdv1 and caf4, mda1 homologue in S. cerevisiae, do not show periodic expression in the cell cycle (Saccharomyces Genome Database: http://www.yeastgenome.org/). Moreover, transcriptions of ftsZ2 and cmdnm2 homologues in A. thaliana are also not considered periodic in microarray analysis11 because mitochondria in yeast and animal cells take various shapes and perform fission and fusion randomly. Similarly, synchronous division of mitochondria and plastids do not occur in higher plants. In C. merolae, as organelles divide synchronously, microarray analysis could be utilized to investigate organelle divisions. It was thought that gene expression profiles during the S- and G2-M-phases were important clues for finding novel genes related to organelle division.3.4. Candidates for novel genes involved in organelle divisionUnknown genes periodically expressed during the S- and G2-M-phase groups can be candidates for novel genes involved in cell nucleus and organelle division. The S and G2-M groups comprised a total of 158 genes including 93 known, 46 hypothetical and 19 hypothetical conserved genes. The hypothetical and hypothetical conserved genes were unknown, and searched for using BlastP, CDs: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/wrpsb.cgi and SMART: http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/ (Table 1). The hypothetical genes were specific to C. merolae, the hypothetical conserved had a conserved domain that had significant hits on genes in other organisms. Therefore, the 19 hypothetical conserved genes were good candidates for novel organelle division genes because they are possible for analyzing organelle division in eukaryotes. We grouped candidate genes with known genes into the S, G2 and M phases to show a tendency of function and localization by the phase of expression peaks (Fig. 4). Genes involved in the cell nucleus were widely found among the S-, G2- and M-phase groups. The S-phase group included genes related to DNA replication, and G2- and M-phase groups included genes related to chromosome segregation and organization. The genes involved in mitochondria and plastids were mainly contained in the S group. This suggested that candidate genes contained in the S group were more related to division of organelles such as mitochondria and plastids. In the candidate, 11, 3 and 5 genes were contained in the S, G2 and M groups, respectively. Therefore, 11 genes in the S group might be more related to organelle division, while the 3 and 5 genes in the G2 and M groups might be involved in cell nucleus division.The list of genes related to the function in cell nucleus and organelle, and unknown genes in the S-, G2- or M-phase groups.

The predictions of the S genes were, as expected, occupied by mitochondria and plastids. The G2 genes were predicted to relate to the cell nucleus and ER. The M genes were involved in cell nucleus and microbody and mitochondria. These predictions were consistent with the order of organelle division in C. merolae, i.e. plastid, mitochondrion, finally cell nucleus and microbody (Fig. 1B). These results must provide a tool for the analyzing the genes for organelle division.Predicted localization of unknown genes by PSORTPsort server; http://psort.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/.

IntroductionDevelopmental biologists have long held a view that development naturally progresses from totipotent fertilized eggs with unlimited differentiation potential to terminally differentiated cells, like a ball rolling from high to low points on a slope as depicted in Waddington's epigenetic landscape.1 The epigenetic landscape also points to another important aspect of development, which is the emergence of different cell lineages during the development; cells in specific developmental lineages are thought to take discrete paths (‘chreodes’) on the imaginary slope. Analogy of cell's developmental potency to the potential energy is thus widely accepted2,3 This analogy is also relevant to the fact that converting differentiated cells into pluripotent cells is difficult. In mammals, nuclear transplantation (cloning)4,5 had been the only way to achieve such a ‘up-hill battle’ reprogramming, until the successful production of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells by infecting MEFs with retroviruses carrying expression cassettes for four genes (Myc, Pou5f1, Sox2 and Klf4).6 Notwithsanding its importance, the potency has only been defined operationally by in vitro and in vivo cell differentiation assays as ‘the total of all fates of a cell or tissue region which can be achieved by any environmental manipulation'.7 Nuclear transplantation experiments, where the success rate gradually decreases according to developmental stages of donor cells, provide yet another operational definition of developmental potential.8–10 We previously showed a possibility to derive a scale of developmental potency from the global gene expression (transcript) profile data, but the data could not be that quantitative because of the use of a limited number of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) for the analysis.11 The work also did not address the issue of cell linege separations.Mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells12,13 and embryonic germ (EG) cells14,15 are prototypical stem cells. These cells can be maintained as undifferentiated state in culture (self-renewal) and have the capacity to differentiate into essentially all the cell types (pluripotency). Therefore, these pluripotent stem cells provide tractable systems to study the developmental potency and cell lineage separation. It has been shown that the manipulation of cell culture condition or a single-gene expression level can differentiate ES cells into relatively homogenous cell population that are similar to the first three lineages in mammalian development:16 primitive ectoderm/neural ectoderm,17,18 trophoblast19,20 and primitive endoderm.21 In the first system, ES cells are cultured in monolayer in N2B27 medium, which drives undifferentiated ES cells into neural lineages.17 Previous DNA microarray analysis indicates that this in vitro ES cell differentiation process mimics in vivo cell differentiation to primitive ectoderm, neural ectoderm and subsequently neurons/glia cells.18 In the second system, ES cells are engineered to downregulate Pou5f1 (Oct3/4, Oct4) expression in a tetracycline-controllable manner (ZHBTc4 cell line19). It has been shown that repression of Pou5f1 induces the differentiation of ES cells into trophoblast lineage.19,20 In the third system, ES cells that are engineered to overexpress Gata6 in a dexamethasone-inducible manner differentiate into primitive endoderm (extraembryonic endoderm).21 Although the analyses of these ES cell differentiation systems have revealed the detailed changes of gene expression patterns, it remains to see whether the global comparison among these individual systems provide any further insights into developmental potency and cell lineage separation.Here we show that principal component analysis (PCA), which can reduce the dimensionality of the gene expression profiles,22 maps cells in a multidimensional transcript profile space where the positions of differentiating cells progress in a stepwise manner along trajectories starting from undifferentiated ES cells located in the apex to the first three lineages in mammalian development: primitive endoderm, trophoblast and primitive ectoderm/neural ectoderm. Furthermore, EG cells and iPS cells are mapped near the origin of the trajectories, whereas mouse embryo fibroblast (MEF) and fibroblast cell lines are mapped near the far end of the trajectories.2. Materials and methods2.1 Cells and RNAsFor the majority of cells used in this study, we used a stock of Cy3-labeled cRNA samples that were used in our previous studies. The details of each cell types, their culture conditions, RNA extractions and Cy3-labeling can be found in the main text of this manuscript and in earlier publications.18,20,23–25 Cells cultured for this study and the culture conditions are as follows. G0–G5 cells: Production and characterization of 5G6GR ES cell clones that are engineered to overexpress Gata6 in a dexamethasone-inducible manner are described previously.21 ES cells were harvested every 24 h (Day 0–5) during differentiation in the presence of 100 mM dexamethasone (Sigma). F0–F5 cells: Undifferentiated F9 EC cells (ATCC number: CRL-1720) were treated with 100 nM all-trans-retinoic acid (RA, Sigma) and 1 mM dibutyryl cAMP (dbcAMP, Sigma) on adherent condition as reported.26 Photos of F9 EC cells during differentiation are available as Supplementary Fig. S1 of the published paper.27 F9 cells were harvested every 24 h (Day 0–5) during the differentiation. Both iPS-Fbxo156 and iPS-Nanog28 were cultured on the STO feeder cells as described previously. To remove the feeder cells, the iPS cells were passaged twice on the gelatin-coated culture dish and harvested for RNA extraction. NIH3T3, STO, MEF_BL6 and MEF_DR4 were cultured under the standard condition and harvested for RNA extraction. Total RNAs isolated for this study were labeled with Cy3-dye and used for the DNA microarray hybridization.2.2 Microarray data analysisDNA microarray analysis was carried out as described previously,18 except for the addition of ES cell total RNAs to the Universal Mouse Reference RNA (UMRR) and the use of a 4 × 44K microarray platform. In our previous DNA microarray studies,23 we used the Universal Mouse Reference RNA (UMRR: Stratagene), which is a mixture of total RNAs from 11 different mouse cell lines. However, to increase the representation of genes expressed in ES cells for the current study, we mixed the UMRR with total RNAs from ES cells (MC1, derived from 129S6/SvEvTac strain) cultured in the undifferentiated condition with LIF at 2:1 ratio. These UMRR plus ES RNAs were labeled with Cy5-dye, mixed with Cy3-labeled samples and used for DNA microarray hybridization. To maximize the uniformity of the microarray data, all the samples, including the ones analyzed by DNA microarray previously, were hybridized to the same platform (the NIA Mouse 44K Microarray v3.023 manufactured by Agilent Technologies #015 087). The intensity of each gene feature per array was extracted from scanned microarray images using Feature Extraction 9.5.1.1 software (Agilent Technologies) as described previously.23 Hierarchical clustering analysis and PCA (see Section 2.3) were carried out using an application developed in-house to perform ANOVA and other analyses (NIA Array Analysis software; http://lgsun.grc.nia.nih.gov/ANOVA/).22 Three-dimensional PCA figures were generated using the virtual reality modeling language (VRML) function of the NIA Array Analysis software22 and visualized by Cortona Vrml client (http://www.parallelgraphics.com/products/cortona/). To produce plots and lists of genes for Fig. 2, we used the R-statistical package29 and only non-redundant set of oligonucleotide probes (a total of 25 164 probes/genes). Of these, 21 890 genes were significant in ANOVA with FDR < 0.05 and used for further analyses. Genes correlated to each cell lineage trajectory were identified based on the correlation of >0.90. All the DNA microarray data have been deposited in the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) and are accessible through GEO Series accession number (GSE11 523) and the NIA Array Analysis software website (http://lgsun.grc.nia.nih.gov/ANOVA/).222.3 Principal component analysisPrincipal component analysis is a statistical method to find major patterns in data variation, which is increasingly used for the analysis of gene expression microarray data.22,30–32 Each principal component (PC) is a linear combination of log-transformed expression values of all genes, and all components are orthogonal, i.e. mutually independent. The first few PCs, which explain most of the observed variance, are the most important; the remaining PCs often represent random fluctuations. Therefore, by plotting data against the first two or three PCs, one can reduce the dimensionality of the data without losing much of information. Contribution of genes to each PC (which may be positive or negative) is determined by singular value decomposition algorithm applied to the covariance matrix. Knowing these contributions, the entire gene expression profile of a given cell type can be represented by a single point in a two- or three-dimensional space. If two cell types are represented by closely located points in the PCA plot, global gene expression profiles of these cells are very similar. In contrast, if corresponding points in the PCA plot are far apart, their global expression profiles are very different. The detailed discussion of PCA plots and interpretation of DNA microarray data can be found in the previous publication.323. Results and discussionTo obtain accurate, comprehensive and comparable expression profiles, we carried out all the DNA microarray analyses within a few weeks using the same platform containing essentially all genes encoded on the mouse genome.23 Although two ES cell differentiation systems have been profiled previously using the earlier version of the array platform,18,20 we carried out the DNA microarray analysis again for the data consistency. In the first system, ES cells are cultured in monolayer in N2B27 medium for 6 days, which drives undifferentiated ES cells into neural lineages.17 RNAs were isolated and analyzed every day during the induction and RNAs (N0–N6: Fig. 1A). Previous DNA microarray analysis has been carried out using the array platform containing a limited number of genes, but indicates that this in vitro ES cell differentiation process mimics in vivo cell differentiation to primitive ectoderm, neural ectoderm and, subsequently, neurons/glia cells.18 In the second system, ES cells that are engineered to downregulate Pou5f1 (Oct3/4, Oct4) expression in a tetracycline-controllable manner (ZHBTc4 cell line differentiate into trophoblast lineage for 5 days).19,20 RNAs were isolated and analyzed every day during the induction (Z0–Z5 in Fig. 1A). To include the first three lineages of mammalian development,16 we added a third system: ES cells that are engineered to overexpress Gata6 in a dexamethasone-inducible manner differentiate into primitive endoderm (extra-embryonic endoderm) for 5 days21 (G0–G5 in Fig. 1A). We also carried out microarray analysis of a fourth system: F9 embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells differentiate into parietal endoderm—one of the extra-embryonic endoderm lineages for 5 days26,27 (F0–F5 in Fig. 1A). For comparison, we also analyzed P19 EC cells before (P0) and after 4 days of RA induction (P4); neural stem/progenitor (NS) cells derived from adult mouse brain and their differentiated cells21 (DC); and trophoblast stem (TS) cells26 and E12.5 placenta (PL).27 Altogether we obtained the DNA microarray data of 32 different cell types in duplicate.Global gene expression profiles of 32 different cell types. Names of the cells and their abbreviated forms are shown. Color coding corresponds with the colors in all other figures. DNA microarray analysis was carried out in duplicate: for each cell type, two independent cell cultures were prepared and used for separate DNA microarray analysis. Reproducibility between two microarray data for each cell type was very high as shown by the Pearson correlation coefficient (mean 0.9927; SD 0.0043; range 0.9788–0.9966). The average of two samples is shown here. (A) Hierarchical clustering analysis. (B) Principal component analysis (PCA).

Individual cell types are mapped in the 3D space according to the first three principal components (PC1, PC2 and PC3). A movie file is available as Supplementary Video S1.We first carried out the hierarchical clustering analysis of these microarray data. Although the hierarchical clustering analysis grouped cells mostly into each differentiation system (Fig. 1A), it showed only the degree of similarity between different cell types and did not provide any insights into the relationship between the different cell lineages. To further analyze the data, we employed PCA, which can reduce the dimensionality of the gene expression profiles and map individual cells in a multidimensional space according to their global gene expression patterns (see Section 2.3 for the explanation of PCA). We first mapped the cells in the 3D transcript profile space (PC1, PC2 and PC3) (Fig. 1B). PCA of all these microarray data uncovered three major paths of differentiation from undifferentiated ES cells in 3D transcript profile space (Fig. 1B; Supplementary Video S1). Each path showed progressive changes in global expression patterns toward specific cell lineages: trophectoderm (Z0–Z5), extra-embryonic endoderm (G0–G5; F0–F5) and neural tissues (N0–N6). We call these paths ‘cell lineage trajectories,32’ because the cell differentiation process can be visualized as a trajectory in the multidimensional transcript profile space.What do these trajectories represent? Because the transcript profile space is constructed from the expression patterns of genes, the changes in gene expression patterns are reflected in the changes in the position of a cell. To find gene expression changes that are correlated with these trajectories, we first drew a line for each cell lineage so that the squared distances from the cells of the lineage were minimized. The locations of other cell types, such as TS and NS, were projected onto the closest lineage trajectory (Fig. 1B). The x-axis of Fig. 2 shows the coordinates of these cell types on each trajectory (Fig. 2A–C). We then searched for sets of genes that were positively correlated with each trajectory line. We identified 1738 genes for the primitive endoderm lineage (Fig. 2A; Supplementary Table S1), 2311 genes for the trophoblast lineage (Fig. 2B; Supplementary Table S2) and 2463 genes for the primitive ectoderm/neural lineage (Fig. 2C; Supplementary Table S3) with a correlation of >0.90. The expression levels of these genes gradually increased as ES cells differentiated into each lineage (see Supplementary data for examples of gene expression changes). The average expression levels of these genes (y-axis in Fig. 2: cell lineage index32) can thus be used as surrogates for the coordinates of cell's positions on each trajectory (x-axis in Fig. 2). This lineage trajectory, therefore, not only defines a path to the fates of individual cell lineages, but also provides a scale for the extent of commitment/differentiation.Average expression levels of selected genes correlate well with the locations of each cell type in PCA coordinates. See Fig. 1A for the abbreviated names of the cells. Each point shows DNA microarray data for each sample; therefore, each cell type is represented by two points. (A) Primitive endoderm lineage, represented by the list of 1738 genes (Supplementary Table S1). (B) Trophoblast lineage, represented by the list of 2311 genes (Supplementary Table S2). (C) Primitive ectoderm/neural lineage, represented by the list of 2463 genes (Supplementary Table S3).Average expression levels of selected genes correlate well with the locations of each cell type in PCA coordinates.

(C) Primitive ectoderm/neural lineage, represented by the list of 2463 genes (Supplementary Table S3).This notion was further supported by examining the locations of cells cultured and profiled independently in the transcript profile space: P19 EC cells before (P0) and after 4 days of RA induction (P4); NS cells derived from adult mouse brain and their differentiated cells18 (DC); and TS cells25,33 and E12.5 PL.25 These cells were mapped onto the transcript profile space based on their global gene expression profiles. As we expected, we found that P0, P4, NS and DC mapped near the primitive ectoderm/neural lineage trajectory (Figs 1B and 2C). Interestingly, the position of P0 was consistent with the notion that in contrast to ES cells, undifferentiated P19 EC cells are more committed and equivalent to primitive ectoderm cells.18 The position of P4 was also consistent with the notion that P19 EC cells differentiate into neuron-like cells after the induction with RA.34 Consistent with their known differentiation status, TS and PL mapped near the trophoblast lineage trajectory (Figs 1B and 2B). Two extra-embryonic endoderm lineages, which were represented by F9 EC cell differentiation26,35 (F0–F5) and ES cells driven by Gata621 (G0–G5), also showed lineage trajectories close to each other (Figs 1B and 2A). Taken together, these data support the notion that cell differentiation can be visualized as cell lineage trajectories in 3D transcript profile space.We also noticed that these cell lineage trajectories represent the gradual loss of developmental potency or potential of cells (Fig. 1B). To examine this point further, we carried out microarray analysis of 12 additional cell types, including three undifferentiated ES cell lines (MC1, derived from 129S6/SvEvTac; MC2, derived from C57BL/6J; D3_GL; and EBRTcH3) and two undifferentiated EG cell lines [TGC8.5_5, derived from the primordial germ cell (PGC) of E8.5 C57BL/6J embryo; and EG1, derived from the PGC of E9 129 embryo].24 We also analyzed the expression profiles of MEF cells, stromal cells (STO) and a fibroblast cell line (NIH3T3). We then analyzed iPS cells, which have been established by infecting MEFs with retroviruses carrying expression cassettes for four genes (Myc, Pou5f1, Sox2 and Klf4).6,28 We used two different iPS lines: one was established by using Fbxo15 promoter-driven GFP as an indicator of pluripotency6 and the other was established by using Nanog promoter-GFP as an indicator of pluripotency.28Hierarchical clustering analysis of the microarray data of all 44 cell types (original 32 cell types and 12 additional cell types; see Supplementary data for detail) showed that undifferentiated ES and EG cells were clustered together with iPS cells, whereas NIH3T3 fibroblast cells, STO stromal cells and MEF cells were clustered together (Fig. 3A). However, it was difficult to assess the overall relationship among all the cell types analyzed here. We, therefore, analyzed the microarray data of all 44 cell types by PCA (Fig. 3B; Supplementary Video S2). Interestingly, an overall structure of the transcript profile space remained essentially the same as that obtained by 32 cell types (Fig. 1B). The majority of the cells were aligned along the three major cell lineage trajectories, except for fibroblast and stromal cells (NIH3T3, STO and MEFs). The fact that these cells did not fall into any of the three cell lineage trajectories is consistent with their mesodermal origin. Their locations near the bottom of all three trajectory lines also support the general trend that these cell lineage trajectories represent the gradual loss of developmental potency of cells (Fig. 1B). Indeed, undifferentiated ES and EG cells mapped near the apex of the trajectory figures, as expected (Fig. 3B). Similarly, the iPS cells mapped near the apex of the trajectories. It has been demonstrated that these iPS cells have the complete phenotype of pluripotent cells, including germline competency in the case of iPS-Nanog.28 Considering that the iPS cells are derived from MEFs, changing the locations of cells from positions with low developmental potency (MEFs) to those with high developmental potency (iPSs) strongly supports our notion that PCA analysis can visualize and predict the developmental potency of cells.Global gene expression profiles of 44 different cell types.

The PCA figures (Figs 1B and 3B) show remarkable similarity to the conceptual picture of Waddington's epigenetic landscape, where cell lineage trajectories represent creodes.1 Such a concept has been taken for granted by embryologists for over a century, but it now seems to be substantiated by the global gene expression patterns. The locations of cells in the multidimensional transcript profile space can be used to identify cells of unknown origin, determine the differentiation status of cells and to assess the developmental potency of cells, possibly without going through experimental manipulation and testing of the cells. The present work also provides a framework for the future study of ES cell differentiation by visualizing the direction to which cells are going to differentiate.Supplementary DataSupplementary data are available online at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was entirely supported by the Intramural Research Program of National Institutes of Health, National Institute on Aging (Z01 AG000662).We thank Drs.
