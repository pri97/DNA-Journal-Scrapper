IntroductionGlutathione (GSH) is the tripeptide <U+03B3>-glutamyl-cysteinyl-glycine and plays a central role in the processes of detoxification and redox buffering.1 Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs, EC. 2.5.1.18) catalyze the conjugation of GSH to an electrophilic substrate.2 Plant GSTs have been actively investigated during last decades.2–8 Currently, large numbers of GST genes have been identified or annotated from at least 17 plant species.7–9 In Arabdopsis, the complete identification in a genome-wide level revealed at least 53 GST genes.5,10,11 In rice, 59 GST genes have been identified.12 However, their works were carried out by BLAST searches against the rice expression sequence tag (EST) database; thus, some members may escape from their collection. Recently, 81 GST genes have been genome-widely identified in Populus trichocarpa and they exhibit extensive functional diversification.13 However, no other data have been reported on the genome-wide identification of the GST family, although at least 20 plant genomes have been completely sequenced (http://www.genomesonline.org/gold.cgi).Since GST functions have been closely linked to stress responses, expression analyses were carried out under a wide variety of stress conditions. Evidence showed that the transcript of plant GST genes was regulated by various abiotic and biotic stresses as well as hormones including xenobiotic-type stresses, such as herbicide application,2 chilling,14 hypoxic stress,15 dehydration,16,17 wounding,18 pathogen attack,19 ethylene,20 auxin,21 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene,22 hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and the defence signal salicylic acid (SA).23 However, whole family-based expression analyses were carried out only in Arabidopsis,11P. trichocarpa13 and rice,24 the transcript profiling of all family members is not available for the other plants.Although many GST genes have been isolated or annotated, only a small number of them have been functionally characterized. Reports showed that plant GSTs might play important roles in herbicide resistance2 and detoxification.25 Overexpression of GSTs in plants improved herbicide and stress tolerance,26–32 and some of GST genes have been patented.8 On the other hand, efforts have been put on the understanding of the role of GSTs in endogenous plant developmental processes. For example, studies revealed the role of GSTs in the vacuolar sequestration of anthocyanins in maize, petunia and Arabidopsis.33–36 Evidence also showed that GSTs might function as binding proteins by binding to various hormones including auxin37–39 and cytokinin40 as well as porphyrin compounds41 to regulate their activities.Generally, although plant GSTs have been discovered for more than 30 years,5 limited data are available on the genome-wide identification and expression analysis as well as their functional divergence of the GST family. Thus, we do not know the family size in a genome and its member that are involved in biotic and abiotic stress-related biological processes. On the other hand, little is know about how these genes have been evolved or expanded with such functions. In this report, we first genome-widely identified and characterized all GST genes encoded by the sorghum and other nine plant genomes, especially focusing on the Tau and Phi classes, which are the top two subfamilies in the plant kingdom. We then evaluated their expansion and evolutionary mechanisms by investigating their duplication and/or transposition history. Subsequently, we examined their transcript profiling by the full-length cDNA, EST, microarray and massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS42) data sets as well as by RT–PCR and quantitative real-time RT–PCR (qRT–PCR). Finally, we investigated their expression divergence under various stresses to further annotate their biological functions and retention mechanisms. Our data show that monocot and dicot GST genes exhibit differences in their evolutionary history and they have been involved in lineage-specific expansion and species diversification. Our data further confirmed their functions in biotic and abiotic stress-related developmental processes and also demonstrated that plant GSTs may be involved in the sugar-related signalling pathway.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materials and treatmentsGrain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) L. Moench cultivar BT × 623 was used for all experiments in this study. Seeds were imbibed in water. After germination, they were planted in greenhouse and were grown under natural light and temperature conditions. The 2-week-old seedlings were used for all treatments. For the drought treatment, seedlings were treated with 30% polyethylene glycol (PEG) and whole plants were collected in various time intervals (0, 0.5 and 2 h), and then frozen in liquid nitrogen for RNA preparation. For salinity and cold treatments, seedlings were subjected to the 250 mM NaCl solution and 4°C conditions, respectively. Samples for RNA extractions were collected in 0, 2 and 8 h time intervals. For glucose and sucrose treatments, seedlings were subjected to 5% of glucose and sucrose solutions, respectively, as suggested by Kojima et al.43 Samples were then collected in 0, 2 and 6 h intervals, respectively.2.2. Expression analysis of sorghum Tau GST subfamily members by RT–PCRs and qRT–PCRsExpression of sorghum Tau GST members was evaluated using the sorghum EST collections from several databases (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbEST/index.html, http://www.phytozome.net/sorghum and http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/tgi/est_ann.pl?gudb=Sorghum). Since low percentages of Tau members have been detected with EST expression evidence, expression analysis was carried out by normal and qRT–PCR. All gene-specific primers used for both normal and qRT–PCR analyses in this study were designed by Applied Biosystems Primer Express® software. Supplementary Table S1 lists all the primer sequences used in this study.QIAGEN RNeasy Mini Kit was used for total RNA isolation. The first-strand cDNA was synthesized using Invitrogen kit. RT–PCRs were performed in 20 µl of reaction mixtures with 20 ng of first-strand cDNA, 200 µM of each dNTPs, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 µM each of primers, 1 U of Taq-DNA polymerase in 1× PCR buffer. These reactions were carried out using PTC-100 thermo-cyclers. The temperature profiling for PCR is as follows: 94°C for 2 min followed by 35 cycles at 94°C for 10 s, 59°C for 10 s and 72°C for 25 s followed by a 2-min extension step at 72°C. PCR products (10 µl) were visualized in 2% agarose gel, and all pictures were taken in BIORAD UV-Gel documentation system using Quantity one 1-D Analysis software. The qRT–PCR analyses were carried out according to our previous description.442.3. Expression divergence of rice, Arabidopsis and soybean Tau GST subfamily membersRice Tau ESTs were collected from the Michigan State University (MSU) rice genome annotation database (http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/) and the NCBI EST database. Arabidopsis and soybean Tau ESTs were obtained from The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR, http://www.arabidopsis.org/) and the Soybase (http://soybase.org/index.php), respectively. The rice MPSS database (http://mpss.udel.eud/rice/)42 was used to evaluate differentially regulated genes under abiotic (drought, high salinity and cold) and biotic (Magnaporthe grisea, Mg, and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, Xoo) stresses according to our previous description.45 For Arabidopsis, the expression data under abiotic (drought, high salinity and cold) and biotic (Erysiphe orontii and Botrytis cinerea, Bcin) stresses were downloaded, and differentially expressed Tau genes were identified according to the description.46To evaluate the expression divergence of tandemly or segmentally duplicated genes, the Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) of their expression was computed for each pair according to the method by Lin et al.47 The cut-off r-value, below which duplicated genes can be considered divergent in their expression, might be determined by calculating r between the expression profiles of 10 000 pairs of randomly selected genes.47,48 Based on the method, we have calculated the cut-off r-value for the Arabidopsis expression data set in this study as 0.53. Thus, we utilized r < 0.53 as an indicator of divergent expression in Arabidopsis. We have used r-value = 0.59 calculated by Lin et al.47 as a cut-off in rice since we employed the same data set (MPSS) for our expression analysis. For sorghum, due to the lack of enough expression data for calculating the cut-off r-value, r < 0.5 was used as an indicator since r-values from 0.5 to 0.59 have been used for criteria to determine the diverged expression.47–492.4. Genome-wide identification of plant genes encoding GST proteinsThe Pfam database (http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/)50 was used to locate the GST_N (PF02798) domains in 53 key GST proteins from a variety of organisms. Similarly, the GST_C domains (PF00043) were retrieved from 58 key GST proteins from the same database. These key domain amino acid sequences were aligned by ClustalX 2.051 and were then used to generate the hidden Markov model (HMM) profiles for HMM searches with E-value cut-off of 1.0 against annotated protein databases from 10 plant organisms. These species include four monocots (Brachypodium distachyon, Oryza sativa, S. bicolor and Zea mays) and six dicots (Arabidopsis lyrata, Arabidopsis thaliana, Carica papaya, Glycine max, Medicago trunculata and P. trichocarpa). For rice, the O. sativa spp. japonica cv. Nipponbare release 6.1 pseudomolecules in the MSU Rice Annotation was used for the search. For A. thaliana, the latest version (TAIR9) of Arabidopsis genome annotation was employed (http://www.arabidopsis.org). For the remaining eight species, the latest versions were from the phytozome database (http://www.phytozome.net/). The key domain amino acid sequences were also used as queries for BLASTP/TBLASTN searches for possible homologues encoded by the 10 plant organisms with an E-value cut-off of 0.01 to confirm the HMM searches.The presence of the domain GST_N or GST_C in the putative GST members detected by the HMM or BLAST searches was confirmed by searching the Pfam database with E-value = 0.01 as the cut-off level. The SMART database (http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/)52 was also employed to detect conserved domains with default parameters. Proteins confirmed by domain searches were regarded as putative GST_N or GST_C domain-containing proteins (referred to GST_N or GST_C domain-containing proteins for convenience); otherwise, they were excluded from our data set.2.5. Alignment and phylogenetic analysisGST_N/GST_C domain or full-length amino acid sequences were aligned using ClustalX 2.0 (http://www.clustal.org/)51 and manually edited in Jalview (version 2).53 The aligned sequences were used for phylogenetic analysis according to the description by Jiang and Ramachandran.542.6. Expansion and evolutionary analysisChromosomal distributions of GST genes were performed by searching and mapping physical positions of their corresponding locus numbers in their genomes. Tandemly duplicated GST genes in 10 plant genomes were identified by three criteria (i) =10 genes apart, (ii) belong to the same GST subfamily and (iii) within 100 kb for both A. lyrata and A. thaliana or 350 kb for the remaining species as suggested by Lehti-Shiu et al.55 Segmentally duplicated chromosome blocks have been previously identified in a genome-wide level in Arabidopsis,56 rice57,58 and soybean (http://www.phytozome.net/soybean.php). We examined the segmental duplicates by comparing the positions of GST genes with known duplicated chromosomal blocks. For the remaining genomes, we identified duplicated blocks using the flanking regions (50 kb upstream and downstream) of GST genes according to the method by Kong et al.59To determine the contribution of transposable elements to the expansion of the GST family, the flanking genomic sequences of the 50-kb upstream and downstream of GST genes in different genomes were used for the identification of major transposon family members including mutator-like transposable element (MULE), hAT, CACTA and Helitron families as well as the identification of retrogenes according to the description.45 Retrotransposon elements were identified by executing the LTR_Finder program60 or RetrOryza.61 Non-synonymous (Ka) and synonymous (Ks) values and their ratios (Ka/Ks) were estimated and were statistically tested according to Jiang et al.453. Results3.1. The sorghum and other plant genomes encode different numbers of the GST family membersTo identify and characterize the sorghum GST family members in a genome-wide level, HMM and BLAST searches were carried out against the whole sorghum genome sequences (the ‘Materials and methods’ section). Our data show that the sorghum genome encodes at least 99 GST_N or GST_C domain-containing proteins (Table 1). Supplementary Table S2 lists the details of these members including their locus names, genome positions, coding sequences and amino acid sequences. Among these two domains, GST_N contains catalytically essential residues and is thought to be a key component of catalysis in GSTs, whereas GST_C may be responsible for substrate specificity.62 Therefore, these two domains were investigated either separately or jointly to better understand their evolution or function. Based on the GST_N domain sequences, the sorghum GST family can be divided into seven different classes by phylogenetic analysis (Supplementary Fig. S1). They are Tau, Phi, Theta, Zeta, Lambda, GSH-dependent dehydroascorbate reductase and tetrachlorohydroquinone dehalogenase, as reported in other studies.5,7,11,13 Among them, both Tau and Phi are the major classes, consisting of 56 (64%) and 19 (22%) members, respectively (Table 1). Genome-wide identification of GST encoding genes in the 10 completely sequenced plant genomesaClassification was based on the GST_N domain amino acid sequences.Genome-wide identification of GST encoding genes in the 10 completely sequenced plant genomesaClassification was based on the GST_N domain amino acid sequences.In addition to the sorghum GST family, we have also genome-widely identified GST members from other nine genomes as described in the ‘Materials and methods' section. Our data show that the sorghum and other plant genomes encode different numbers of the GST family members, and both Tau and Phi classes of GST members consist of at least 73% of total GSTs as shown in Table 1. Their locus names, genome positions, coding sequences and amino acid sequences were included in Supplementary Table S2. Currently, the GST members from Arabidopsis, rice and poplar have been reported12,13,63 and members from the remaining 7 plant genomes were newly identified. Among the 53 previously identified GSTs in Arabidopsis (http://www.arabidopsis.org/browse/genefamily/gst.jsp),63 two of them, AtT3g55040 and At5g02780, were not included in this study since no GST_N or GST_C domains could be detected with E-value = 0.01 as the cut-off level. However, we have identified nine more GST_N or GST_C members (Supplementary Table S3). Soranzo et al.12 have identified 59 rice GST members. However, three members OsGSTMU357, OsGSTU37 and OsGSTT2 were not included in this study since we cannot detect any GST domains in these members and we have also identified 28 more GST members (Supplementary Table S4). On the other hand, we have identified the same numbers of the poplar GST members as reported by Lan et al. (2009)13 and we have used them for this study.Besides the full-length GST_N and/or GST_C domain-containing genes, we have also identified numbers of partial GST fragments. They encode only partial GST_N or GST_C or both of partial domains. These members contain no typical domain structure and have no expression evidence with the characters of pseudogenes. Due to the low feasibility of phylogenetic analyses by integrating these partial fragments, we removed these members from our analyses although we may underestimate the rate of gene duplication.3.2. A significantly larger Tau and Phi subfamily of most recent common ancestor in monocots than in dicotsSince both Tau and Phi classes are the largest subfamilies in all analysed 10 genomes, we evaluated the patterns of expansion of these two classes by analysing the phylogenetic relationships of these GST members from different organisms (Fig. 1A–D and Supplementary Fig. S2 and S3). Most of dicot members fell into their own subclasses, separating from monocot plants. Members from each species intended to be clustered together, exhibiting lineage-specific expansion. To determine the degrees of expansion of these two classes among monocot and dicot plant lineages, we broke down the phylogeny into ancestral units according to the method.64 Due to possible gene loss and pseudogenes, the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) members may be underestimated. Thus, at least 2 Tau or Phi members would have been present in the MRCA among these 10 organisms (red circles in Fig. 1A and B for Tau and C and D for Phi). The MRCA among the 4 monocot plants possessed 15 Tau (green stars in Fig. 1A and B) and 10 Phi (green stars in Fig. 1C and D) members; thus, 7.5-fold and 5-fold expansions have occurred for Tau and Phi, respectively, in this period. Following this era, they underwent relatively lower expansion rates except for rice, resulting in the current Tau or Phi members. These results suggested that the rapid gene expansion for the 4 monocots occurred after the divergence of monocot from dicot plants. However, the MRCA among the 6 dicot plants contained only 6 Tau (blue triangles in Fig. 1A and B) and 2 Phi (blue triangles in Fig. 1C and D) members; thus, only 3-fold or no expansion has occurred for Tau and Phi, respectively, in this period. The large-scale expansion of Tau or Phi members for dicot plants occurred during their divergence from their MRCA (Eurosid I and II) (Fig. 1). These data demonstrate that both monocot and dicot plants exhibit the differences in their Tau and Phi subfamily expansion history. Phylogenetic analysis and evolutionary dynamics of the Tau and Phi classes of the GST superfamily. (A and C) Phylogenetic analyses of the Tau and Phi subfamily members, respectively, in four monocot and six dicot plants.

Significant contributions of tandem duplications to family sizeTo explore the possible mechanisms of the Tau and Phi GST subfamily expansion, we investigated the contributions of both tandem and segmental duplications to the expansion of these subfamilies in the sorghum genome. We examined the physical positions of the Tau and Phi GST members on different sorghum chromosomes (Supplementary Fig. S4). The results showed that both Tau/Phi GSTs were located on multiple chromosomes with non-random distributions. For example, chromosome 1 contained the highest density of the Tau or Phi GSTs with 30 or 7 members, respectively. Similar results were observed in rice and Arabidopsis.5,12 However, more even distributions were observed in soybean with fewer members in most of chromosomes (data not shown). Based on the physical positions of the Tau or Phi GSTs, the tandem cluster was defined as described in the Methods. Among the 56 Tau and 19 Phi GSTs in sorghum, 44 Tau (78%) and 12 Phi (63%) GSTs are found in tandem clusters, respectively (red locus name in Supplementary Fig. S4; Fig. 2), indicating tandem duplications as the main mechanism for the Tau and Phi GST expansion. On the other hand, only two members of Tau and Phi GSTs (Sb01g005990 and Sb01g013590 for Tau and Sb01g030240 and Sb01g047980 for Phi) were involved in segmental duplications (indicated by blue lines in Supplementary Fig. S4). Besides both tandem and segmental duplications, we also investigated the contributions of other expansion mechanisms including transpositions and retrotranspositions to the expansion of these subfamilies (see Methods). However, our data showed that limited contribution by both transposons and retrotransposons to the expansion was detected. Similarly, we have investigated the contributions of tandem and segmental duplication, transpositions and retrotranspositions to the expansion of Tau and Phi subfamilies in the remaining 9 plant species (Fig. 2). The results showed that the expansion of 46–82% of Tau and 33–76% Phi GSTs were found in tandem clusters (Fig. 2), suggesting tandem duplication as the major mechanism for Tau and Phi GST expansion. In addition, 2–23% of Tau and 0–72% Phi GSTs were segmentally duplicated (Fig. 2), suggesting that segmental duplication should also be regarded as the major expansion mechanism for the Phi class in some species such as in soybean and Arabidopsis. Pie diagrams showing expansion mechanisms of the Tau and Phi classes of the GST superfamilies in 10 plants. The figure indicates the contributions of tandem (red), segmental (green) duplications and both of them (pink) as well as other mechanisms (blue) to the expansion of the Tau and Phi class members in 10 genomes. In each pie diagram, the number prior to the comma indicates the total expanded members by different expansion mechanisms and its percentage is given following the comma.Pie diagrams showing expansion mechanisms of the Tau and Phi classes of the GST superfamilies in 10 plants. The figure indicates the contributions of tandem (red), segmental (green) duplications and both of them (pink) as well as other mechanisms (blue) to the expansion of the Tau and Phi class members in 10 genomes. In each pie diagram, the number prior to the comma indicates the total expanded members by different expansion mechanisms and its percentage is given following the comma.Since tandem duplication is regarded as the major expansion mechanism, we re-constructed their expansion history using the largest tandem cluster with 23 members in the sorghum chromosome 1. The 23 tandem genes are in two clades (Supplementary Fig. S5A), suggesting that this cluster is the results of two ancestral units, which may be evolved from ancient tandem duplication events. One of them contains only 3 genes whereas the secondary clade contains 20 members. The data suggested that different ancestral genes duplicated themselves by differential expansion rates. On the basis of the phylogenetic tree, we deduced the hypothetical origins of 23 genes from two ancestral units by tandem duplication (Supplementary Fig. S5B). For the ancestral unit with 3 descendents, only two rounds of tandem duplications were required to generate these genes. However, for the secondary unit with 20 descendents, at least 9 rounds of tandem duplications were expected to produce such a population. After expansion, these genes were then not always inserted into the loci according to their physical orders. For example, the putative tandem pair of the Sb01g030810 gene is Sb01g030990 but not its physical neighbour Sb01g030820. On the other hand, we found that most of tandem duplications occurred by a one-gene mode, i.e. only one gene was duplicated in a one tandem duplication event. This case was also observed in our previous report on tandem duplication of the lectin gene superfamily.65 Taken together, our data showed that parental genes were not always physically linked to their descendant genes and different expansion rates were observed for different parental genes.3.4. Different selection forces between monocot and dicot plants and between GST_N and GST_C domains in a speciesSince both monocot and dicot plants exhibited the distinct difference in their expansion history, we investigated whether they were under different selection forces. We first identified reciprocal best matches for all Tau or Phi GST members either from 4 monocot or 6 dicot plants. These identified matches were then used to calculate Ka/Ks ratios for their GST_N domain (Fig. 3A and B). Evolutionarily, the ratio of Ka to Ks can be used as an indicator of selective pressure acting on a protein-coding gene. A Ka/Ks ratio <1 indicates functional constraint with purifying selection on a gene, and a Ka/Ks ratio >1 indicates accelerated evolution with positive selection and a Ka/Ks ratio = 1 indicates neutral selection. Although the period with large scale of expansion of Tau or Phi GSTs from 6 dicot plants was later than 4 monocot plants, the average Ka/Ks for 6 dicots (0.29) is significantly higher than that for 4 monocots (0.15). Furthermore, the frequency distribution of the Ka/Ks ratios is also significantly different between dicot and monocot plants. For 6 dicots, most of the mass were centred near Ka/Ks = 0.2 or >0.5 whereas most of the mass for 4 monocots were centred near Ka/Ks = 0.12. These data suggested that GST_N in dicot plants evolved faster than that in monocot plants. Similar results were observed when GST_C domain regions were used for such analyses (Fig. 3C and D). To further analyse the reason why both dicot and monocot plants exhibited the difference in their evolutionary rates, we compared their Ka and Ks values separately. We found that their Ka values between dicot and monocot plants were similar (Fig. 3E and F). However, both dicot and moncot plants exhibited significant differences in their Ks values (Fig. 3E and F). As a result, they showed significant differences in their Ka/Ks ratios. Ka/Ks ratio analysis. Frequency distributions of Ka/Ks ratios were analysed using the best matched pairs among six dicot plants (A and C) or four monocot plants (B and D). (A) and (B) show the data analysed from the GST_N regions. (C) and (D) show the analysis from the GST_C regions. The average Ka, Ks and their ratios in monocot and dicot pairs were indicated in (E) for GST_N and in (F) for GST_C. Asterisks indicate significant differences between monocot and dicot plants at P < 0.05 (*) and P < 0.01 (**) by t-test, respectively. The Ka/Ks plots for the GST_C versus GST_N domains of the sorghum Tau members are shown in (G).Ka/Ks ratio analysis. Frequency distributions of Ka/Ks ratios were analysed using the best matched pairs among six dicot plants (A and C) or four monocot plants (B and D). (A) and (B) show the data analysed from the GST_N regions. (C) and (D) show the analysis from the GST_C regions. The average Ka, Ks and their ratios in monocot and dicot pairs were indicated in (E) for GST_N and in (F) for GST_C. Asterisks indicate significant differences between monocot and dicot plants at P < 0.05 (*) and P < 0.01 (**) by t-test, respectively. The Ka/Ks plots for the GST_C versus GST_N domains of the sorghum Tau members are shown in (G).Since most of plant GST proteins consist of two functional domains including GST_N and GST_C, we were wondering if these two domains exhibited different evolutionary rates. We analysed the Ka/Ks ratios of these two domains of the sorghum Tau members separately. The ratios of GST_C plotted against that of GST_N of same proteins were shown in Fig. 3G. The results suggested that both domains were under differential selective pressures and the GST_C domain might have been subjected to more relaxed functional constraints. Similar results were observed in the remaining 9 organisms (data not shown). The recent analysis on the Populus GST superfamily also showed similar results.133.5. Expression abundance of the Tau subfamily members among 9 sorghum tissuesTau class is the largest GST subfamily in plants and is a good candidate for surveying the expression divergence of duplicated members. Therefore, we further investigated the expression profiling of this class. We have detected 33 out of 56 sorghum Tau members with EST expression evidence. To examine if the remaining genes are expressed in sorghum and to explore their expression divergence, we have investigated the expression of 50 annotated Tau genes in 9 different tissues including young and mature leaves, panicles, seeds and roots as well as stems by RT–PCR analysis. The results showed that not all annotated Tau genes were expressed under normal growth conditions. Among 50 tested Tau members, 37 genes (74%) were expressed in at least one of 9 tissues (Fig. 4) and the remaining 13 genes showed no expression in all tested tissues. All these results have been confirmed by qRT–PCR (Supplementary Fig. S6). Among the 37 expressed genes, nine of them were expressed in all tested tissues. These genes were listed as follows: 01g030800, 01g030810, 01g030990, 02g022210, 02g038130, 03g045780, 03g045830, 03g045860 and 05g001525. Interestingly, 10 genes showed root-specific expression including 01g027620, 01g030830, 01g030880, 01g030890, 01g030940, 01g031010, 01g031020, 01g031040, 01g031050 and 03g031780. They were mainly expressed in either young or mature roots. On the other hand, we have detected two genes with leaf-specific expression patterns including 01g030840 and 03g025210.

Regulated expression of the Tau subfamily members in sorghum under various abiotic stresses and sugar treatmentsTo investigate if some members are expressed only under stressed conditions and to explore their roles and functional divergence, RT–PCRs were carried out to detect their expression abundance under various abiotic stress conditions (cold, PEG or high salinity) and sugar (glucose and sucrose) treatments. The results indicated that 37 Tau members showed expression under one or more stressed conditions (Supplementary Fig. S7A). All of them were also expressed under normal growth conditions (Fig. 4). The results were confirmed by qRT–PCR (data not shown). Furthermore, we have detected additional 6 genes with significant expression signals under various stresses (Supplementary Fig. S7B). Most of them showed low expression level, which may explain why their signals could not be detected by normal RT–PCR. Thus, we have detected total of 43 GST Tau members with detectable expression signals under normal or stressed conditions.By comparing the RT–PCR with qRT–PCR results and by statistic analysis, 37 genes were detected with significant differences in their expression level under one or more stress conditions or treatments. These genes and their responses to stresses and treatments were shown in Fig. 5A. Total of 35 Tau genes were significantly regulated by abiotic stresses including cold, PEG and high salinity (Fig. 5B). Among them, 12 genes were regulated by only one of these stresses (8 by PEG and 2 by salinity or cold). Another set of 14 genes were regulated by two of these three stresses and the remaining 7 genes were regulated by all three stresses. Besides abiotic stresses, sugar treatment was also shown to play important roles in regulating Tau GST gene expression. Totally, 26 Tau GST members were detected with significant differences in their expression level under both glucose and sucrose treatments (Fig. 5C). Among them, 6 genes were regulated by only glucose treatment and 7 genes were by sucrose. The remaining 13 genes were regulated by both treatments.

These data suggested the possible interaction between abiotic stresses and sugar signalling.3.7. Expression divergence among tandemly and fragmentally duplicated genes in sorghum, rice and ArabidopsisTo understand the functional divergence of duplicated Tau genes, we compared the expression profiles of these genes under various stresses or different sugar treatments in sorghum. Totally, 7 tandem arrays and 1 pair of segmentally duplicated genes were submitted for such analyses. If r < 0.5, 0.59, and 0.53 (see Methods) between a tandem array or a segmental pair in sorghum, rice and Arabidopsis, respectively, the tandem array or segmental pair was regarded as a divergent array or pair in their expression. Based on the criteria, no expression divergence has been observed between segmentally duplicated gene pair 01g005990 and 01g013590. Among 7 tandem arrays, 57–71% of them exhibited significant divergence in their expression patterns in response to cold, NaCl, PEG, glucose or sucrose treatments (Fig. 6A). Statistically, 86% of arrays showed significant divergence under abiotic stresses, sugar treatments or both of them (Fig. 6A). More detail analysis by comparing the expression data with phylogenetic relationship showed that expression divergence was observed even in closely related genes.

(B and C) Gene expression divergence of tandemly/fragmentally duplicated Tau members under abiotic and biotic stresses in rice and Arabidopsis, respectively.Similarly, we have also investigated the expression divergence of duplicated Tau genes in Arabidopsis and rice, respectively (Fig. 6B and C). For Arabidopsis, we have analysed total of 3 pairs of segmentally duplicated pairs (At1g10360 and At1g59670, At1g17190 and At1g78340, At1g27130 and At1g69920), two of them (67%) showed expression divergence in response to either abiotic or biotic stresses. Among 7 tandem arrays, 43–71% of them were differentially expressed under cold, NaCl, PEG, Bcin or EQr treatments (Fig. 6B). As a result, 71% of them showed significant divergence under abiotic or biotic stresses and 86% of them exhibited expression divergence under both abiotic and biotic stresses (Fig. 6B). For rice, two pairs of segmentally duplicated Tau genes (LOC_Os03g57200 and LOC_Os07g05800, LOC_Os11g03210 and LOC_Os12g02960) have been detected. The former pair exhibited divergence in their transcript abundance among various tissues and no expression divergence has been detected in the latter pair. On the other hand, among 5 tandemly duplicated Tau gene arrays, 40–80% of them were divergent in their expression under cold, NaCl, PEG, Mg or Xoo treatments (Fig. 6C). Thus, 60–80% of them exhibited expression divergence under either abiotic/biotic or both of them (Fig. 6C).4. Discussion4.1. Evolutionary origins of GST domains and their combinationsIn this study, we have genome-widely identified more than 700 GST_N or GST_C domain-containing GSTs from 10 higher plants. Besides these, our searches and reports show that GSTs are ubiquitous not only in higher plants but also in other eukaryotes and prokaryotes.62,66 Thus, GSTs are evolutionarily ancient proteins and one may be interested in the origin of this family. Reports suggested Theta, Zeta and Omega GSTs as the most ancestral classes.66,67 Our phylogenetic analysis also supported both Theta and Zeta as the ancestral classes in plants (Supplementary Fig. S1). On the other hand, GSTs were thought to have evolved from a thioredoxin-like ancestor in response to the development of oxidative stress68,69 and glutaredoxins are the suggested ancestors of the GST_N domain.70 In this study, we indeed detected several GST_N domains, for example, in the sorghum locus Sb02g003090, with very high sequence similarity to the glutaredoxin domain, supporting the putative origin of GSTs from glutaredoxins.Among these identified hundreds of GSTs, both GST_N and GST_C domains are usually encoded in a single gene, indicating that most of GSTs are homodimers in plants. The fact also suggests the co-evolution of both GST_N and GST_C domains. However, we have also identified some GST genes encoding only GST_N or GST_C domain (Table 1). The fact may imply the loss of GST_N or GST_C domain during long evolution. One of such examples was shown in Supplementary Fig. S8A. The figure shows a tandem cluster consisting of 4 rice GSTs and their domain organizations. After duplication, only the GST_C domain was detected in one of duplicates LOC_Os10g38150 whereas both domains could be detected in the remaining tandemly duplicated genes.Besides the detection of putative domain loss events, we are also interested in the detection of domain combinations, which may generate new proteins and thereby functional divergences.71,72 Our data showed that most of GSTs contained only GST-N/GST_C or both of them, suggesting the limited domain combination in this family. However, we have detected some exceptions. For example, both members of the Theta class Sb04g007760 and Sb10g022570 contained the Elongation factor 1 gamma domain (EF1G) except for both GST_N and GST_C domains (Supplementary Fig. S8B). These cases were also detected in Arabidopsis (Supplementary Fig. S8B) and other plants (data not shown). In Arabidopsis, we have also detected the integration of other domains such as EF-1 guanine nucleotide exchange domain (EF1_GNE) and Myb transcription factor domain (Myb_DNA-binding) (Supplementary Fig. S8B). The integration of the transcription factor domain resulted in the localization of this protein to the nucleus,73 suggesting the functional divergence by domain combination.4.2. Differential evolutionary history of the Tau and Phi subfamilies in monocot and dicot plantsIn eukaryotes, most of genes with structural and regulatory functions are members of gene families. They are descendants from gene duplication, which plays a major role in plant evolution.74 These duplicates may be lost or be survival by either retaining their original functions, subfunctionalization or neofunctionalization.75 However, limited information is available on the patterns of functional diversification governing the evolution of most classes of gene families in the plant kingdom.13Sorghum has been regarded as a biofuel crop of growing importance for ethanol production. Now both methylation filtration-based genome sequencing and 8-time-assembly draft sequencing have been finished and their data have been freely released.76,77 Thus, it is now becoming more feasible and imperative to further characterize its genes and their families for better understanding their evolutionary mechanisms. However, comparing with other plants, limited data has been reported on the genome-wide analysis of a gene family in sorghum. We have constructed a hypothetical evolutionary history of the Tau and Phi classes of the GST family and found numbers of pseudogenes with partial domain structures, indicating that some duplicated genes failed to persist similar to other gene families.75 On the other hand, we found that the era for a large-scale expansion was different between dicot and monocot plants. Our data from 6 dicot and 4 monocot plant genomes showed that different dicot plants exhibited similar evolutionary patterns, so did monocot plants. The MRCA of all analysed dicot plants had a small family of the Tau and Phi GST subfamilies and the MRCA of all monocot plants had evolved into bigger sizes of these subfamilies (Fig. 1). The data suggested that the MRCA of monocot plants duplicated Tau and Phi GST members faster than the MRCA of dicot plants. However, during the period from the MRCA of monocot or dicot plants to current species, dicot plants evolved faster than monocot plants with more rapid expansion and higher Ka/Ks ratios (Figs. 1 and 3). Our data also show that sorghum plants exhibit high percentages of regulated expression patterns among different tissues and under various abiotic stresses (Figs. 4 and 5) and both monocot and dicot plants have also been detected with high expression divergence under these stresses (Fig. 6). Therefore, it is reasonable to suggest that differential evolutionary history between monocot and dicot plants may be due to the changed adaptability to various environmental conditions during the divergence of monocot plants from dicot plants.4.3. Lineage-specific expansion and species diversificationWe have detected two large-scale expansion events of the Tau or Phi subfamily by investigating the expansion history of these classes in 6 dicot and 4 monocot plants. The MRCA of monocot plants experienced the first large-scale expansion with 7.5-fold increase for Tau and 5-fold for Phi while dicot plants required only 3-fold more members for Tau or no expansion for Phi GSTs (Fig. 1). The second large-scale expansion occurred mainly in dicot plants with the maximum 8-fold expansion during the species diversification of some dicot plants from their common ancestors (Fig. 1). These results suggested that the large-scale expansions might be required for species diversification although more GST members from such expansion might be also for the environmental adaptability or biological processes. On the other hand, we have also detected some species-specific Tau or Phi members as reported by Lan et al.13 In fact, Tau or Phi classes of GSTs are plant-specific and species-specific GST members have been detected not only in plants but also in non-plant organisms.5,7,8 Thus, both evolutionary history and lineage-specific expansion suggested that GST members may have contributed to species diversification.4.4. Expansion patterns and mechanisms of duplicationsWe have demonstrated that dicot and monocot plants exhibited different expansion patterns. We have also shown that tandem duplication represented the major mechanism for the subfamily expansion. At least eight classes of the GST subfamily have been identified7 and they exhibited different rates of expansion, resulting in different sizes of classes. Further investigation showed that the sizes of subfamilies were proportional to the tandem duplication rates (data not shown). The results suggested that tandem duplication could be regarded as the major driver for the expansion of not only the Tau/Phi GST subfamily but also the other subfamilies.On the other hand, the rice genome has been reported to undergo large-scale duplication 40–50 million years ago78 and rice is likely an ancient aneuploid rather than a polyploidy57; however, we do not see evidence for the significant contribution of large-scale duplications within a relative short period to the expansion of the rice GST family. On the other hand, we also investigated the contributions of other mechanisms to the expansion of this family since different organisms have evolved into different sizes of GST families. We have identified all possible transposons (MULE, hAT, CACTA and Helitron) and retrotransposons (LTR and non-LTR) using flanking genomic sequences of the 50-kb upstream and downstream of GST members in four monocot and six dicot plants. We found very limited contribution of transposons/retrotransposons to the expansion of this family in multiple organisms. For example, only one of the rice Tau members LOC_Os10g38710 was located in a PACK-MULE member TI0007202, which was identified by Juretic et al.79 However, we cannot detect its parental gene.4.5. Expression divergence and biological functionsAt least 26 sorghum Tau members were regulated by glucose or sucrose treatments (Fig. 5C). In Arabidopsis, we have also detected five Tau genes with up-regulated expression under sucrose treatment based on the microarray analysis.80 These data suggested that the Tau subfamily members in plants might play a role in sugar signalling.The complexity of the gene family functions was mainly reflected by the very high expression divergence under various stresses.81 Our data revealed that the Tau subfamily has evolved into a highly divergent group in their expression under various abiotic stresses and sugar treatments. These phenomena have been observed in all tested organisms including sorghum, rice and Arabidopsis (Fig. 6). Furthermore, the expression divergence was also observed among different individuals within a tandem array. For example, among 23 tandem duplicates (Supplementary Fig. S5), 20 GST genes show detectable expression and none of them exhibit the same expression pattern when their expression patterns were examined among different tissues (Fig. 4) or under different stresses/treatments (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S7). In addition, expression divergence of the Tau members was observed not only under these stresses but also under various hormones. For example, in sorghum, we have detected at least 40% of tandemly duplicated Tau genes with diverse expression patterns under various hormones including SA, methyl jasmonate or the ethylene precursor aminocyclopropane based on the microarray data.82 All these data suggested that expression divergence should be regarded as one of the major drivers to facilitate the retention of the tandemly duplicated genes in this subfamily. Additionally, these data also suggested that the Tau subfamily members should play important roles in stress regulation as well as sugar and hormone signalling.On the other hand, functions of plant Tau and Phi members may be retained with a relatively low divergence as shown by Ka/Ks analysis (Fig. 3). We also showed that both GST_N and GST_C domains were under different selective pressures (Fig. 3). GSTs have been thought to function in detoxification of xenobiotics and in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. Thus, both more relaxed functional constraints in the GST_C domain and high degree of expression divergence should be regarded as the major mechanisms to facilitate the retention of duplicated genes and the adaptability to the diversity of potential xenobiotics and stressors.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by Strategic Research Program from Temasek Life Sciences Laboratory in Singapore.We thank the Joint Genome Institute, the MSU Buell Lab and the Arabidopsis Information Resource for providing annotations and sequences.

IntroductionDrought stress is one of the several adverse environmental factors that are commonly encountered by plants and can result in significant reductions in crop productivity worldwide. In response to drought stress, plants activate a number of endogenous defence mechanisms that function to increase the drought tolerance.1 Plants have evolved molecular machinery that initiates complex signal-transduction networks which minimize the impact of a suboptimal water supply on plants. The identification of signalling pathways acting in stress-affected cells and the mutual interactions between these pathways are the major research efforts. As a result of the complexities of stress-related signal transduction and its huge potential for impact on modern agriculture, this research field has garnered a substantial amount of attention. The early events of plant adaptation to environmental stresses involve the perception of stress signals and subsequent signal transduction, leading to the activation of various physiological and metabolic responses.1–4In the signal-transduction networks involved in the perception of stress signals to stress-responsive gene expression, phosphorylation, which is mediated by two-component systems (TCSs) or His-to-Asp phosphorelays, is a key mechanism for stress signal transduction in cells. TCSs, consisting of sensor hybrid histidine kinases (HKs), histidine phosphotransfers (HPts) and effector response regulators (RRs), have been systematically identified and analysed in two completely sequenced and well-annotated model plant species: Arabidopsis thaliana and rice (Oryza sativa).5–7 A number of studies in Arabidopsis have suggested that among the Arabidopsis HKs (AHKs), AHK1, AHK2, AHK3 and AHK4 function in response to drought stress. In planta studies have demonstrated that the cytokinin (CK)-independent AHK1 functions as a positive regulator, whereas the CK-responsive AHK2, AHK3 and AHK4 function as negative regulators in drought stress signalling in both ABA-dependent and ABA-independent pathways.8,9 Although the AHK2, AHK3 and AHK4 proteins all positively regulate shoot growth, they exert a negative regulation of root growth.10–13 AHK1 also positively regulates shoot growth but its function in root growth is not known at this time.8 The involvement of AHKs in drought stress response suggests that the downstream Arabidopsis HPts (AHPs) and Arabidopsis RRs (ARRs) may also function in drought stress response. However, at the present time, there is not any in planta evidence or expression data, which have characterized the regulatory roles of AHPs in drought stress signalling. As for the ARRs, which can be classified into the type-A, type-B, type-C and pseudo ARRs based on their sequence signatures,14 loss-of-function studies indicated that among the type-A ARRs, ARR3, ARR4, ARR5 and ARR6 may function as positive regulators, whereas ARR8 and ARR9 as negative regulators in osmotic stress response, suggesting that these type-A ARRs might play a role in drought stress response.9 Recently, mutations in the pseudo aprr5, aprr7 and aprr9 genes enhanced tolerance of the triple mutant to drought stress, demonstrating that these three APRRs play negative roles in drought response.15 Since the rice TCS genes have been identified,7 expression studies have indicated that transcription of several rice TCS members, including HK, HPt and RR encoding genes, is altered by salt stress treatments.16–18 However, drought-related functions and/or expression profiling of rice TCS genes under dehydration and/or drought stress remain to be determined. TCSs were also identified in the important model legume Lotus japonicus.19 None of the abiotic stress-related data are currently available for L. japonicus TCS components.Global soybean (Glycine max) production is frequently impacted by drought stress, which may reduce soybean yield by ~40%.20 Given the importance of TCS signalling pathways in the regulation of various biological processes and responses to environmental stimuli, including drought stress, we have recently compiled a list of putative TCS-associated components in soybean.21 Within the soybean genome, a total of 21 HK, 10 authentic and 3 pseudo HPt, 18 type-A RR, 15 type-B RR, 3 type-C RR and 13 pseudo RR encoding genes were identified. Comparative analysis of the Arabidopsis, rice and soybean TCS members revealed the conserved architecture of the TCSs between these plants.21 In this study, we aimed to identify tissue-related and dehydration-related soybean TCS genes by characterizing their expression profiles in both root and shoot tissues of soybean plants treated with a time-coursed dehydration stress. These findings will enable us to perform in planta functional analyses of the candidates and will allow us to identify appropriate stress-responsive TCS candidate genes and their respective promoters for the future improvement of drought resistance in soybean via genetic engineering. Therefore, the identification, characterization and molecular tailoring of novel TCS members will have the potential to overcome a number of important limitations involved in the generation of transgenic soybean plants with superior yield under drought conditions.1,2,82. Materials and methods2.1. Plant growth, dehydration treatment and collection of tissuesSoybean cv. Williams 82 seeds were germinated in 6-l pots containing vermiculite and were well-watered and grown under greenhouse conditions (continuous 30°C temperature, photoperiod of 12 h/12 h, 80 µmol m-2 s-1 photon flux density and 60% relative humidity). For tissue-specific expression profiling of TCS genes, root and shoot tissues were collected from 12-day-old soybean plants in three biological repeats. For expression profiling of TCS genes under dehydration stress, the dehydration treatment was carried out in time-course experiments to identify dynamic changes in transcripts in response to dehydration stress. Specifically, 12-day-old plants were carefully removed from soil, and roots were gently washed to remove soil. The plants were subsequently transferred onto a filter paper and allowed to dry for 2 and 10 h under the following conditions: 60% relative humidity, 25°C temperature and 10 µmol m-2 s-1 photon flux light intensity. The intensity of the dehydration stress treatments was quantified by the levels of relative water contents and standardized water contents, which were determined as described previously (n = 5; Supplementary Fig. S1).22 For mock control, seedlings were removed from soil and washed exactly as above, then grown hydroponically in water for 2 and 10 h under the same conditions. Root and shoot tissues of dehydrated and control plants were separately collected in three biological repeats for expression profiling.2.2. RNA isolation, DNase treatment and cDNA synthesisPlant tissue samples were ground into a fine powder using a mortar and pestle. Total RNA was isolated using the TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen), and RNA concentration was determined using the NanoDrop ND-1000 UV-Vis spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA). For each sample, 4 µg of total RNA was digested according to the manufacturer's instructions in a 25-µl volume with Turbo DNA-free DNaseI to remove genomic DNA contamination (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA). After DNaseI treatment, RNA concentration was determined again with the NanoDrop spectrophotometer. The A260/A280 values of all RNA samples used in this study were 2.08 or higher, and the A260/A230 ratios of all samples were higher than 2.2. First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using 1 µg of DNaseI-treated RNA with the ReverTra Ace® qPCR RT Kit (Toyobo, Japan) in a 20-µl reaction volume according to the manufacturer's supplied protocol.2.3. Quantitative real-time PCRGene-specific primers for soybean TCS genes were designed using the Primer3 software.23 Primer specificity was confirmed by blasting each primer sequence against the soybean genome (Glyma1 model),24 followed by analysing the melting curves and amplicon fragments. Primers were redesigned if the corresponding melting curve did not yield a single sharp peak and/or if they had an electrophoresis pattern that failed to produce a single amplicon of the correct predicted length. The CYP2 gene was selected as a reference gene in the expression profiling of soybean genes as recommended previously.25 Quantitative real-time PCRs (RT-qPCR) were performed in 96-well plates on a Stratagene MX3000P system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) using Thunderbird™ SYBR® qPCR Mix (Toyobo, Japan) reagents. Primer sets of 0.4 µM final concentrations for each primer were used in a final volume of 10 µl well-1. The thermal profile of the RT-qPCRs was at 95°C for 1 min, 40 cycles at 95°C for 15 s and at 60°C for 1 min. Dissociation curves were obtained using a thermal melting profile performed after the last PCR cycle: 95°C for 15 s followed by a constant increase in the temperature between 60°C and 95°C. Background-corrected raw fluorescence data were exported from the MX3000P system and analysed in LinRegPCR software with a built-in baseline correction and amplification efficiency calculation.26,27 Amplicon-based fluorescence thresholds were used to obtain the Ct values, and these values together with the amplicon-based mean efficiency were used for calculating the initial quantity of mRNA transcripts. Finally, the mRNA levels of each transcript were normalized with those of the corresponding CYP2 transcript.2.4. Statistical analysis of the dataMean values of three biological repeats were used to plot figures, and error bars on each figure represent the standard errors. When appropriate, a Student's t-test (one tail, unpaired, equal variance) was used to determine the statistical significance of the differential expression patterns between tissues and/or between treatments. Differential expression data which failed to pass the t-test with a P-value <0.05 were regarded as insignificant. These insignificant data were regarded as ‘ubiquitous’ in the case of tissue-specific comparisons and as ‘unresponsive’ in comparisons between normal and stress treatments; regardless of the fold change between the expression levels. Dehydration-responsive genes were defined as the differentially expressed genes with at least 2-fold induction or repression at 2 h and/or 10 h after dehydration treatment, whereas their expression in the mock control seedlings did not significantly change in a similar manner (Student's t-test, P < 0.05).3. Results and discussion3.1. Confirmation of primer specificitySince the specificity of primers is crucial in RT-qPCR assays,28 we carefully designed each primer pair as described in the ‘Materials and methods' section. Furthermore, we determined their specificity by analysing their respective melting curves and amplicon fragments. All primer sets used in this study produced only one peak in their respective melting curves, and corresponding amplicons detected under our RT-qPCR conditions generated a single band of expected size on 2% agarose gels (data not shown). The sequences and calculated amplification efficiencies of the specific primers used in this study can be obtained in Supplementary Table S1.3.2. Expression of the soybean TCS genes in root and shoot tissuesIncreasing evidence suggests that the mechanisms of drought resistance are either related to root and/or shoot traits.29 Root morphology and development is one of the key traits that is correlated with mechanisms of drought resistance.30 Because the distribution of water within the rhizosphere is critical to maintaining function in different environmental conditions, plasticity for root traits is a vital factor to acquire resources. For instance, plants can adapt to drought by developing a longer taproot which helps reach lower soil layers where water is more readily available. In addition, an extensive fibrous root system can be useful for foraging subsoil surface moisture and nutrients such as phosphorus.29 On the other hand, a restraint of shoot growth has been shown to be advantageous in adverse environments by minimizing the evaporative leaf surface area. The growth restraint conferred by DELLA proteins, whose functions are regulated by different hormones such as gibberellin (GA), auxin and ethylene, is beneficial and promotes survival.31 Overexpression of the GhDREB1 gene from cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) in Arabidopsis resulted in a cold, salt and osmotic stress-tolerant phenotype as a consequence of growth retardation caused by GA deficiency, decreased sensitivity to CKs and repression of CK signalling.32 Therefore, the appropriate control of shoot- and root-related morphological traits is a promising approach for developing drought resistance in a number of crops, including soybean.29,31,32In Arabidopsis, numerous reports have suggested that TCS members regulate shoot and root growth and branching.10–14 In order to identify candidate genes that could be potentially used for enhancing drought resistance by altering shoot and/or root growth when overexpressed or repressed in transgenic plant systems, we determined expression profiles for all root- and shoot-specific soybean TCS members. As shown in Fig. 1 and summarized in Table 1 (detailed in Supplementary Table S2), the majority of soybean TCS genes were preferentially or specifically expressed in roots according to the criteria defined for the analysis of tissue-specific expression (Table 1; Supplementary Table S2).33 Forty-eight of the 83 soybean TCS genes were expressed highly in roots. Among these 48 genes, 20 genes were further classified into a root-specific group, as their transcript abundance in roots was more than 10-fold higher than that of shoots. The remaining 28 genes fell into the root-preferential group as their corresponding root/shoot expression ratios were between 3 and 10 (Fig. 1, Table 1). One gene (GmRR18) was found to be ‘very specifically expressed’ in root tissues as its root/shoot transcript abundance ratio was more than 118-fold (Fig. 1C). Another gene (GmHK02) was identified as a root ‘exclusively expressed’ gene since it was only detected in root tissues (Fig. 1A). Only four genes (GmHP07, GmRR04, GmRR17 and GmPRR46) displayed higher expression in shoots and the remaining 30 genes showed ubiquitous expression patterns. All four of the shoot-related genes were grouped into the shoot-preferential group with root/shoot expression ratios ranged between -10 and -3 (Fig. 1, Table 1, Supplementary Table S2). Expression of the soybean TCS genes in root and shoot tissuesaFold difference was calculated as the ratio of mean expression levels of the same gene in roots and the shoots, when the root/shoot ratio is <1.0, the ratio was reversed and a minus sign (-) was added.bGenes whose differential expressions between root and the shoot tissues did not pass Student's t-test with P-value <0.05 are also classified as ubiquitously expressed genes.Expression of the soybean TCS genes in root and shoot tissuesaFold difference was calculated as the ratio of mean expression levels of the same gene in roots and the shoots, when the root/shoot ratio is <1.0, the ratio was reversed and a minus sign (-) was added.bGenes whose differential expressions between root and the shoot tissues did not pass Student's t-test with P-value <0.05 are also classified as ubiquitously expressed genes.Expression of soybean TCS genes in root (white bars) and shoot (black bars) tissues under normal conditions.

Data represent the means and standard errors of three independent biological samples. Asterisks on the top of bars indicate statistically significant differences between tissues with a P-value <0.05 (*) or 0.01 (**).The expression levels of the soybean TCS genes were widely divergent. For example, the GmHK genes, which express more highly in roots than in shoots, can be divided into three groups (low, medium and high) based on their transcript abundance, in which the lowest (GmHK08) and highest (GmERS2) transcript abundance in roots was more than 3200-fold different (Fig. 1A). Among the GmHK genes, the genes encoding ethylene-receptor HKs, especially the GmERS1 and GmERS2, were expressed more highly than the others in both root and shoot tissues. Three GmHK genes (GmHK07–09), encoding proteins with highest homology to the osmosensor AHK1 of Arabidopsis,21 have a similar root-enriched expression pattern to the AHK1 gene.34 Similarly, TCS genes, coding for the Arabidopsis AHK4-like HKs in soybean (GmHK14–17), are more preferentially expressed in roots than in shoots (Fig. 1A),10,21 suggesting that a correlation between sequence conservation and expression patterns may exist. The soybean HPt encoding TCS genes formed a highly divergent group based on their transcript abundance. Specifically, their highest/lowest expression ratios in root and shoot tissues were more than 16 000- and 65 000-fold, respectively (Fig. 1B). Among the GmRR genes, the type-A GmRRs possessed the most diverse expression levels in both roots and shoots (Fig. 1C). GmRR06 had the highest expression in the root tissues, which was 170 000-fold higher than that of the lowest one (GmRR16). The expression levels among type-A GmRR genes in shoots were less variable than in roots, and the difference in expression was 28 000-fold between the highest (GmRR10) and the lowest (GmRR16) expressed genes (Fig. 1C). Twelve of 15 genes encoding type-B GmRRs were expressed either preferentially (eight genes) or specifically (four genes) in root tissues (Table 1). There were no shoot-preferential expression patterns detected among the type-B GmRR genes (Fig. 1D). The greatest amount of divergence in root/shoot expression levels among GmRRs was found for GmRR27, which had a root/shoot transcript abundance ratio of 39-fold. According to a comparative sequence analysis,21 the 15 type-B GmRRs showed the highest amino acid sequence identity to five ARRs (ARR1, ARR2, ARR11, ARR12 and ARR14). With the exception of the ARR14 gene that was not expressed in roots, semi-quantitative analyses determined that the remaining four ARR genes were expressed ubiquitously in root and leaf tissues.35 All of the GmPRR genes were expressed in both root and shoot tissues, of which four, eight and one genes were expressed root preferentially, ubiquitously and shoot preferentially, respectively (Table 1, Fig. 1F). Among the soybean TCS genes, the three type-C GmRR genes (GmRR34–36) exhibited the lowest levels of expression under our experimental conditions (Fig. 1E). In an analysis of soybean short transcript sequence reads by Libault et al.,33 the transcripts of two type-C GmRR genes (GmRR34 and GmRR35) were not detected in all the tissues except from the green pods. It should also be noted that the transcripts of GmHK05, GmHK06 and GmRR36 were not found in any of the nine tissues tested in their studies, including a transcriptomic analysis of root hair cells.33,36 However, in our experimental settings, the presence of the transcripts of these genes were reliably detected, albeit at low levels (Fig. 1A and E). It is possible that this discrepancy is due to the duplicated nature of the soybean genome,37 resulting in very high homology between duplicates. As a result, the method used in the authors’ study failed to detect expression because it could not assign reads matching with two or more closely related loci.33,363.3. Expression of the soybean TCS gene during dehydrationPlant TCSs have been implicated in the regulation of environmental stress responses, including drought stress,8,16–18,38 suggesting that the TCS genes, which function in stress responses, may be used to enhance drought tolerance in plants via genetic engineering.8,38 Stress-related soybean TCS genes can be predicted based on comparative sequence analyses21; however, this approach has limitations. Although TCSs have been systematically identified and characterized in Arabidopsis, rice, L. japonicus and soybean,5–7,19 only a few members of Arabidopsis TCS genes have been identified as drought-related genes based on expression and/or functional analyses.8,38Cis-element-based targeted gene finding approach can also be used to predict stress-responsive genes, and tissue-specific genes.21,39–41 However, because of their short length (5- to 9-bp core) and flexibility, the frequency of a cis-motif sequence in the whole genome is relatively high. In addition, a number of cis-element sequences might be syntactically correct without providing practical regulatory function.42 Therefore, our major goal of this study was to characterize the expression profile of all soybean TCS members under dehydration stress in order to precisely identify dehydration-responsive TCS genes that can potentially used to engineer soybean plants with improved drought resistance. We employed RT-qPCR analyses to conduct systematic expression profiling of all 83 TCS genes in root and shoot tissues of 12-day-old soybean plants subjected to 2 and 10 h dehydration stress. The evaluation of expression patterns in individual stressed tissues, rather than whole plants, might provide information on the mode of action of stress-responsive genes in specific tissues.43 As presented in Figs 2 and 3, a large number of soybean TCS genes appeared to be dehydration responsive. To precisely determine the dehydration-responsive genes, the expression of those soybean TCS genes, whose mRNA levels were found to be changed under dehydration treatment, was also examined in the water-treated control plant samples (Supplementary Figs S2 and S3). As a result, among 83 soybean TCS genes, a total of 18 induced and 33 repressed genes were identified (Fig. 4, Table 2, Supplementary Table S3). Previously, a cis-motif-based prediction using 12 stress-responsive cis-motifs suggested that out of 83 soybean TCS genes, 30 genes might be dehydration responsive because these genes were found to contain dehydration-responsive ABRE and/or MYBR and/or MYCR motifs in their promoter regions.21 It should be noticed that the ABRE and MYBR were discovered as dehydration-inducible cis-motifs, whereas MYCR was shown to act as both dehydration-inducible and dehydration-repressible regulatory motifs.44 We found that among the 30 predicted dehydration-responsive TCS genes, 11 genes were confirmed by our RT-qPCR analysis. Eight genes (GmHK10, GmRR01, GmRR02, GmRR25, GmRR34, GmRR35, GmRR36 and GmPRR39) are induced, and three genes (GmHP01, GmRR09 and GmRR29), which contain MYCR(s) in their promoter regions, are repressed (Supplementary Table S3).21 Thus, although the cis-element-based targeted gene finding approach has demonstrated a wide application in the genome-wide prediction due to the availability of a large number of cis-elements in many plant species, expression profiles of the cis-motif-based predicted genes should be verified experimentally using an expression profiling approach, such as RT-qPCR, prior to the launching of laborious in planta functional studies.39,40,42,45Genes with altered expression under dehydration in each familyGenes with altered expression under dehydration in each familyExpression of TCS genes encoding HKs and HPts in root (white bars) and shoot (black bars) tissues of soybean plants under dehydration stress.

The reported differential expression patterns passed the Student's t-test (one tail, unpaired, assuming equal variance) with a P-value <0.05.Although the soybean TCS genes were predominantly expressed in roots than in shoots (Fig. 1), their expression patterns upon dehydration stress were opposite (Fig. 4). Specifically, there were only 8 and 17 genes whose expression was induced or repressed in the roots, respectively, upon dehydration. At the same time, there were 14 and 20 genes whose expression was either induced or repressed, respectively, in shoots (Fig. 4). Only a small number of the genes responded in a similar fashion (induced or repressed) in both tissues. Specifically, the GmHK06, GmHK08 and GmHK11 genes were down-regulated, and the GmRR16, GmRR34, GmRR35 and GmRR36 genes were up-regulated. These data support the hypothesis that the majority of soybean TCS genes respond to dehydration stress in either root- or shoot-specific manner. It is worth mentioning that the dehydration responsiveness of the GmHK10 gene were opposite in the root and the shoot tissues. The expression of GmHK10 was induced in the roots at 2 h but was repressed in the shoots at 10 h after dehydration treatment (Fig. 2A, Supplementary Fig. S2A). Not only having a larger number of dehydration-responsive genes, but the extent of the responsiveness of GmHKs, i.e. the fold change, was also higher in shoot tissues. For example, the expression levels of the GmHK01 and GmHK12 genes, which encode proteins most similar to the Arabidopsis CKI1 and AHK3, respectively,21 exhibited a 5–6-fold induction in shoots but insignificant induction in roots (Supplementary Table S3). Similarly, the extent of repression was also more severe in shoots than in roots. A maximum of 6-fold repression was found in roots, whereas a 17-fold repression was observed in shoots (Supplementary Table S3). GmHK08 was the most repressed among all soybean TCS genes during dehydration treatment and in both tissues, and its expression in shoots at 10 h after dehydration treatment was not detectable (Fig. 2A, Supplementary Fig. S2A). In Arabidopsis, the osmosensor AHK1 and the CK receptor AHK2, AHK3 and AHK4 have been shown to function in drought stress response. The expression of all four of these AHK genes is induced by dehydration.8 Among the three AHK1-like protein encoding GmHK07–09 genes,21 the expression of GmHK07 was induced by dehydration, suggesting that GmHK07 may play a positive regulatory role in drought response of soybean plants similar to that of AHK1 in Arabidopsis.8 Out of eight GmHK genes (GmHK10–17), which are predicted to encode CK-receptor HKs based on sequence similarity to their Arabidopsis counterparts,21GmHK10 and GmHK12 showed significant induction in roots and shoots, respectively (Fig. 2A, Supplementary Fig. S2A). It is possible that GmHK10 and GmHK12 may act as negative regulators in drought stress response in a similar fashion as their Arabidopsis orthologs.8 Based on our analyses, all of the GmHK07, GmHK10 and GmHK12 genes appear to be good candidates for in planta studies.Among the 13 soybean TCS genes encoding HPt proteins, two genes (GmHP03 and GmHP06) were induced and four other genes were repressed upon dehydration (Table 2). Interestingly, none of the induced genes were found in root tissues. Among the induced genes, GmHP06 exhibited the highest induction (>6-fold) in shoots, meanwhile its induction in roots was not significant. The most repressed gene was GmPHP2, whose expression was reduced by 7.5-fold in shoots upon dehydration (Fig. 2B, Supplementary Fig. S2B, Supplementary Table S3).The expression of soybean GmRR genes followed different patterns (Fig. 3A, Supplementary Fig. S3, Supplementary Table S3). Repression of the type-A GmRRs genes in roots was not statistically significant. In addition, only two genes (GmRR01 and GmRR16) were induced in the same tissues. In shoots, three and six genes of this group were induced and repressed upon dehydration, respectively. Together, 11 of the 18 type-A GmRR genes were either induced and/or repressed by dehydration in root and/or shoot tissues, suggesting their diverse functions in the regulation of dehydration stress response (Supplementary Table S3). Diverse functions were also reported for Arabidopsis type-A ARRs. Mutations in arr3, arr4, arr5 and arr6 increase sensitivity, but an additional loss of ARR8 and ARR9 decreases the sensitivity to osmotic stress. These data suggest that ARR3, ARR4, ARR5 and ARR6 may function as positive regulators, whereas ARR8 and ARR9 function as negative regulators.9 In soybean, the six dehydration-repressed type-A GmRR genes (GmRR07–09 and GmRR11–13) encode ARR8- and ARR9-like GmRRs, providing correlative evidence that these GmRRs function in stress response, and may act as negative regulators in a similar fashion as their ARR8 and ARR9 orthologues (Supplementary Table S3). Similarly, the ARR4- and ARR6-like protein encoding GmRR01 and GmRR02 genes were up-regulated in response to drought, suggesting that they may function as positive regulators in stress response in a similar fashion as their Arabidopsis counterparts. The expression of type-B GmRR genes in soybean, which encode transcription factors, was mostly repressed in both tissues. Only two genes (GmRR25 and GmRR32) were induced in response to drought, and they exhibited shoot specificity (Fig. 3B, Table 2, Supplementary Fig. S3, Supplementary Table S3). As for the type-C GmRR genes, all three genes (GmRR34–36) were found to be induced strongly in both roots and shoots by dehydration (Fig. 3C, Table 2, Supplementary Fig. S3, Supplementary Table S3).Among 13 pseudo GmPRR genes, the expression of six genes was altered by dehydration, suggesting that they may play a physiological role in response to dehydration (Fig. 3D, Table 2, Supplementary Fig. S3, Supplementary Table S3). Genes encoding GmPRR39 and GmPRR44 were significantly induced in shoots and roots, respectively, upon dehydration treatment. Four other genes encoding GmPRRs were repressed upon dehydration, of which two genes (GmPRR46 and GmPRR47) were repressed in the roots, whereas two other genes (GmPRR48 and GmPRR49) were repressed in the shoots (Supplementary Table S3). The dehydration-inducible GmPRR39 and GmPRR44 genes were shown to encode either APRR5- or APPR9-like proteins.21 In Arabidopsis, the APRR5 and APRR9 proteins were reported to negatively regulate drought response.15 Therefore, it is possible that the dehydration-responsive GmPRR39 and GmPRR44 may function as negative regulators in soybean as well. On the other hand, although the transcripts of GmPRR38, GmPRR42, GmPRR43 and GmPRR45 were accumulated under dehydration, the transcripts of these genes were also increased in a similar manner in the water-treated mock control plant tissues (Supplementary Fig. S3), suggesting that circadian clock-related regulation affected the expression of these GmPRR genes rather than dehydration stress. This is not a surprise because it has been reported previously that these four GmPRR genes encode circadian clock-associated APRR1-, APRR7- and APRR9-orthologous proteins.21,463.4. Clustering analysis of the expression data of soybean TCS genesA gene's expression is regulated through several mechanisms, of which some are still unknown.47 Nonetheless, the regulation of gene expression via the interaction of transcription factors and promoters has been well documented.1 Similarities in expression patterns and responsiveness to stresses may likely be a result of the involvement of similar cis-elements and/or transcription factors. In order to gain an overall understanding of the expression patterns of soybean TCS genes, we performed hierarchical clustering using their log-transformed expression data. Figure 5 shows the result of hierarchical analysis of soybean TCS genes performed on each of the groups (GmHKs, GmHPs and GmRRs). As shown in Fig. 5A, the expression patterns of GmHK genes clustered into two distinct nodes. Within these two distinct nodes, each group was separated into two subnodes. The high correlation coefficient (0.85–0.96) of each subnode indicates that the expression patterns of the genes in each node were highly similar to one another. The expression of several genes with high homology, which is an indication of duplicated pairs, did not cluster in the analysis. For instance, GmHK02 and GmHK05, and GmHK10 and GmHK11 did not cluster, implying that their divergence in expression was the cause. The expression patterns of GmHP genes in roots and shoots during dehydration were clustered into three nodes with high correlation coefficient values (Fig. 5B). It should be noted that GmHP07 and GmHP08 did not fall into those nodes. With the exception of GmPHP1 and GmPHP2, the expressions of other highly homologous pairs in this group clustered together. These data indicated that functional redundancy is still high among duplicated HPt proteins of soybean. Expression profiles of each of the RR types (A, B, C and pseudo) clustered into two nodes mainly based on the expression levels (Fig. 5C–E). Some of the groups were clustered into two or more subgroups based on the responsiveness to dehydration in the tested tissues (Fig. 5C–E).

The groups of genes clustered in this analysis will not take into account the gene-to-gene expression divergence. We found that several nodes were formed (Supplementary Fig. S4), implying the possibility that similar dehydration-regulated pathways exist for each node.3.5. ConclusionsThis report has provided the first insight into the previously uncharacterized TCS members of soybean and placed a special emphasis on the relation to dehydration stress responsiveness. Our results have provided useful information by identifying candidate dehydration-responsive genes. By combining these genes with their associated dehydration-responsive promoters, scientists can utilize these resources to engineer soybean plants for enhanced stress resistance. We have selected a number of dehydration-responsive genes for further analysis in Arabidopsis to corroborate their functional significance in planta. By implementing these functional studies, we aim to identify a suite of candidate genes that are best suited for the genetic engineering of soybean plants with improved drought resistance.Supplementary DataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingD.T.L. is supported by the RIKEN Foreign Postdoctoral Fellowship.

IntroductionNext-generation sequencing technology has the potential to allow sequencing of whole genomes to be carried out in standard molecular genetics laboratories. However, an important current application is the sequencing of specific genomic regions, e.g. genes with known or suspected mutations in patient samples. In order to sequence parts of the genome of interest, a number of target enrichment procedures have been developed. These include standard PCR, long-range PCR, nested patch PCR, template circularization, the use of gapped molecular inversion probes, microarray capture, in-solution capture and microdroplet-based PCR enrichment.1–9 All these methods work but each has its own advantages and disadvantages. A recent review on target enrichment strategies for next-generation sequencing, which discusses the methods listed above, concluded that the ability to combine DNA samples prior to enrichment would be an important advancement for targeted next-generation sequencing: ‘The logical extension of sample pooling is to perform multiplexed target enrichments in which many samples are barcoded before capture’.10 Here, we describe a method that delivers this advancement by combining DNA samples using indexes or barcodes prior to target enrichment.We have adapted the indexing protocol published by Craig et al.11 and combined it with the Agilent Technologies SureSelect Target Enrichment System to develop a cost-efficient method for targeting smaller regions of the genome (e.g. 100 kb–1 Mb) in multiple DNA samples. SureSelect is a capture protocol based on the in-solution method developed by Gnirke et al.12 This method allows targeting of regions of the genome in custom designed reactions by using cRNA baits. By enabling simultaneous enrichment of multiple samples with no impact on individual sample identification for downstream analysis, this method significantly reduces the cost and time required for this type of experiment. Our method is highly suited to target enrichment of smaller genomic regions. The method can accurately detect SNPs at enriched target sites. Within a single sequencing experiment, it has the capacity to analyze the exonic regions of hundreds of genes in tens of samples for sequence variation using as little as 1 µg of input DNA.2. Materials and methods2.1. Enrichment reaction eArray designWe focused on two genes on chromosome 1 (PTBP2 and CDC42). The plan was to sequence the genes in full and include upstream and downstream regions. The target region for CDC42 was 108 139 bp, and for PTBP2, it was 184 850 bp. Bait libraries were designed and assessed for coverage across the target genomic regions using the Agilent eArray website (https://earray.chem.agilent.com/earray/). The online design recommends repeat masking of the target sequence in order to minimize off-target capture. With the default repeat masking option turned on, it was only possible to design target capture baits for just under 40% of CDC42 and just under 43% for PTBP2 (see cRNA baits RM track in Supplementary Fig. SA, e.g. of coverage across PTBP2 with default options). In order to try and increase the percentage of target capture, we adopted an alternative repeat masking protocol: the repeat masking constraints were relaxed to allow relatively unique baits to remain in the pool of target capture baits. This was achieved by designing baits using the Agilent eArray website to the target region with the repeat masking option turned off. The resulting baits were searched against the human genome reference (hg18) for similarity. If a bait mapped to more than one location with greater than 90% sequence identity using BLAST (~12 mismatches across the bait), this bait was removed from the design. Using this protocol, we were able to design baits for just over 54% of CDC42 and 77% of PTBP2 (see cRNA baits SRM in Supplementary Fig. SA, e.g. of coverage across PTBP2 with our alternative relaxed repeat masking). Because the bait library was a fraction of the total possible for eArray design, we replicated it four times using 92.18% of the available space on the array.2.2. Index designThe indexing methodology was taken from the study by Craig et al.11 The specific 6 bp indexes used in this study (listed in Supplementary Table SA) were from a group of 19 indexes that performed most reliably in that study (Fig. 2 in Craig et al.11). Each index is designed such that it can tolerate at least 1 bp change as a result of a sequencing error without mutating into one of the other indexes used in the study. This helps guard against potential mix-up of individual sample data.2.3. Library preparation, target enrichment and sequencing of genomic DNA samplesDNA from each of nine CEU HapMap samples (three trios) was used in this study. A total of four enriched sequencing libraries were generated using these samples (Fig. 1). Library 1 contained one target enriched non-indexed DNA sample. Library 2 contained one target enriched indexed DNA sample. Library 3 was a multiplex sequencing library of three equimolar indexed samples, which was enriched using one target enrichment reaction. Library 4 was a multiplex sequencing library of nine equimolar indexed samples, which was enriched using one target enrichment reaction. Figure 1 identifies the HapMap samples used in each lane of sequencing. The issue of potential differences in quantity of sequence reads between indexed samples due to the efficiency of indexed adapter ligation to input DNA, as previously reported by Craig et al.,11 was addressed in this study by multiplexing the indexed in equal quantities pre-enrichment. Experimental Design. Genomic DNA from nine HapMap samples was chosen for the study (three trio families). DNA from one of the samples (NA11881) was prepared twice (with and without an indexed adapter), target enriched and sequenced separately as single samples (non-indexed sample and one indexed sample in Step 1 and enriched libraries 1 and 2 in Step 2). One trio family (NA11881, NA11882 and NA10859; all indexed) was pooled after the Illumina genomic DNA sample prep and enriched together using one SureSelect enrichment reaction to produce the enriched library 3 sample. Indexed DNA from all nine samples was also pooled after the Illumina genomic DNA sample prep and enriched together using one SureSelect enrichment reaction to produce the enriched library 4 sample. Note: enriched libraries 3 and 4 were also sequenced using 80 bp reads to generate additional data for validation of the method for SNP detection.Experimental Design.

Note: enriched libraries 3 and 4 were also sequenced using 80 bp reads to generate additional data for validation of the method for SNP detection.The preparation of each sample is a two-step process; in the first step, the DNA is prepared as an Illumina sequencing library, and in the second step, the sequencing library is enriched for the desired target using the Agilent SureSelect enrichment protocol. The library preparation and enrichment methods were followed according to the Agilent Illumina Single-End Sequencing Platform Library Prep protocol (v1.2 April 2009) with the following modifications: (1) instead of shearing the DNA with a covaris system, a biorupter (Diagenode) was used. The samples were sonicated on high for 30 s and off for 30 s for a total 30 min with addition of ice after every 10 min to keep the samples cool. (2) For the indexed samples (libraries 2–4), the Illumina adapters were replaced with custom made indexed adapters supplied by IDT DNA. During the SureSelect enrichment process, blocking oligos are used (provided by Agilent) to temporarily block the Illumina adapter sequence and prevent off-target pull-down of genomic DNA due to similarity of sequence in the cRNA baits and Illumina adapter sequence. (3) For the pre-capture enrichment PCR, 1.3 µl of DNA was used as input with 11 cycles of PCR instead of 1 µl of input DNA and 14 cycles of PCR. (4) Post-enriched library DNA from the individual samples were combined (one, three or nine samples) to a total quantity of 500 ng per pool. This solution was allowed to evaporate off overnight instead of using a vacuum concentrator and resuspended in 3.4 µl of elution buffer to give a final concentration of ~147 ng/µl. The individual sample combinations (one, three or nine-samples) were each enriched using one custom SureSelect enrichment reaction (library design ELID: 0236181). Target enriched libraries were stored at a stock concentration of 10 nM ready for sequencing. A total of 6/8 pM of target enriched libraries were sequenced on the Illumina Genome Analyzer II using 40 bp reads following the manufacturers protocol. Libraries 3 and 4 (three and nine samples) were also sequenced using 80 bp reads to generate additional data for the study.2.4. Data analysisThe base sequence data were called from the image files with the Illumina Bustard.py script and the Illumina GA pipeline version1.4. The RunInfo.xml file was edited to allow for the 6 bp index to be called as a separate index read in the analysis, with matrix and phasing estimated from the PhiX control lane. This allowed the 6 bp index to be ignored in the alignment of the sequences to the reference genome (hg18) to facilitate calculation of basic QC measures, i.e. % clusters passing filters and alignment to hg18 (Supplementary Table SB). Both indexed and non-indexed sequence reads were treated in this way so that the effective read length for samples was 34 bp (for 40 bp reads) and 74 bp (for 80 bp reads). The sequenced reads were then parsed based on the index using an in-house Perl script to allow analysis of the data on an individual per sample basis. SNP detection and generation of data used to determine coverage were performed using MAQ13 on the individual sample sequence data. The Illumina quality scores were converted to the standard Phred scores required by MAQ by using a modified version of the fq_all2std.pl script supplied with MAQ. A SNP masked reference genome was used for alignment of the reads.3. ResultsFigure 1 outlines the experimental design for this study. Four sequencing libraries were enriched for 377 kb of target sequence. Libraries 1 and 2 each contained the same HapMap DNA sample but differed because library 2 included a 6 bp index. Comparison of sequence data from these indexed and non-indexed samples determined the impact of the index on the efficiency of the enrichment reaction. The third and fourth libraries were multiplex libraries containing three- and nine-indexed HapMap samples, respectively. Sequence data from these libraries were used to assess the performance of the indexes in distributing the reads from a single sequencing reaction to multiple samples and to measure the accuracy of SNP calling in multiplex samples.3.1. Comparison of on-target versus off-target sequence coverage in indexed and non-indexed samplesSequence data from the non-indexed DNA sample show that 20% of sequence reads were on-target, i.e. they mapped back to a target region of the enrichment reaction ±50 bp (Table 1). Across the target regions, there was a 1708-fold enrichment of target DNA in this sample. Ninty-eight percent of the targeted bases were covered by at least one sequence read and on average the target regions were covered to a depth of 169x. We investigated the effect of including a 6 bp index in the adaptor sequence on the efficiency of the enrichment reaction by enriching and sequencing the same DNA sample with an index. The on-target (22%) and fold enrichment (1885) metrics are similar for both samples (Table 1) indicating that the inclusion of the index did not compromise the performance of the enrichment reaction. Figure 2A and B show that for both ‘on-target’ and ‘off-target’ locations, the pattern of sequence coverage obtained is consistent between the single indexed and single non-indexed samples. The higher sequence coverage observed for the non-indexed sample compared with the indexed sample reflects the larger number of clusters (and therefore sequence reads) that passed QC filtering for the non-indexed sample (Supplementary Table SB). The three-index sample and the nine-index sample libraries had medians of 21 and 18% on-target sequence and medians of 1689- and 1467-fold enrichment, respectively, based on combined 40 and 80 bp read data.

Comparison of read count for three-index sample versus nine-index sampleFigure 3 shows the performance of the indexing methodology in combination with target enrichment. The numbers of reads attributable to each index/sample are calculated as a percentage of the total number of sequence reads per lane of data. For both the three-index sample and nine-index sample libraries, there is a relatively even share of sequence reads for the individual samples, especially in the nine-index library. This indicates that the enrichment process has been consistent across all samples within each indexed library. The individual read counts uniquely aligning to the hg18 reference, percentage on-target and fold enrichment for each sample in the three- and nine-index sample libraries are detailed in Supplementary Table SC.

Concordance of SNP calls with known HapMap genotypesTo illustrate the capacity of this method to detect SNPs with very high accuracy, we present data from the sequenced PTBP2 and CDC42 regions. Concordance rates for SNP calls compared with known HapMap genotypes are listed in Table 2. Only SNPs that had at least one copy of the non-reference allele, a sequencing depth of =8x and MAQ base quality score >30 were considered for analysis for each test sample. For the three-index sample library at a sequencing coverage of =8x, the concordance rate across the three samples was 99.1%. For the nine-index sample library at =8x coverage, the concordance rate was 98.9%. Combined these data give an overall concordance rate of 99% for SNP calls in the three- and nine-indexed samples. If we consider the concordance of SNP calls at all sites, the false-negative rate (i.e. the proportion of HapMap SNPs not detected in the sequence data irrespective of coverage) was 1.4% for the three-index sample library and 4.9% for the nine-index sample library. This assumes that the genotypes in the HapMap database are correct. Concordance of SNPs called by MAQ in sequencing data with known HapMap genotypesaOnly 97 of the 103 SNPs had =8x coverage and a Phred-like consensus score >30 and were included in concordance analysis.Concordance of SNPs called by MAQ in sequencing data with known HapMap genotypesaOnly 97 of the 103 SNPs had =8x coverage and a Phred-like consensus score >30 and were included in concordance analysis.4. DiscussionWe present a method where multiple DNA samples are first indexed and combined into one sequencing library and then target enriched using a single reaction. By indexing prior to enrichment, this method (i) dramatically reduces the costs associated with target enrichment and (ii) introduces significant flexibility into the design of targeted next-generation sequencing studies.The efficiency of the enrichment reaction is not compromised by the inclusion of the 6 bp index in adaptor sequence as determined by enrichment and sequencing of the same DNA sample with and without an index. We were able to show that use of index-specific blocking oligos during the enrichment process is not necessary. The enrichment process is reasonably consistent across all indexed samples in both the three-index sample and nine-index sample libraries analyzed in this study. The problem of differential ligation efficiency for individual indexes11 has been resolved here by quantifying each ligated and PCR-enriched sequencing library and then combining individual indexed sample libraries in equimolar amounts prior to target enrichment. In the three-index sample library, the sample with the ACACAT index (NA10859) had approximately one-third less reads than the other two indexed samples in that library. However, in the nine-index sample library, where the read counts for all nine individual samples were within a tight range of each other, the same ACACAT index did not under perform compared with the other indexes. Differences in sample read counts are more likely due to pipetting or quantitation error when the sequencing libraries are initially combined prior to the enrichment process.We demonstrate that multiplex target enrichment using DNA indexing can detect SNPs with high accuracy. In accordance with other next-generation sequencing studies, SNP detection is highly dependent on sequence coverage and is more difficult for heterozygous sites.14 Even at a relatively low coverage of =8x, 99% of SNPs were called correctly when data from the PTBP2 and CDC42 loci from the three- and nine-index samples were compared with online HapMap data. This concordance call rate compares well with rates reported for other target enrichment studies: 99.7% for variants with a sequencing coverage >5x, MAQ quality score >3014; 99.4% for high-quality calls inferred using Bayesian model12 and 99.57% for variants with a sequencing coverage >8x, MAQ quality score >30.15Alternative methods amenable to combining multiple target enrichment and sample indexing such as high-throughput microdroplet-based PCR technology7 and on-array sequence capture8,15,16 require up to 7.5 and 20 µg of input DNA, respectively. These large requirements for input DNA put a significant strain on studies with limited amounts of source biological material. We used 3 µg of input DNA for our method but this could be lowered to 1 µg or less because the input requirement for the enrichment reaction is only 500 ng of Illumina sequencing library. Therefore, we believe our method is ideally suited to multiplex target enrichment of samples with limited DNA resources, e.g. clinical samples.The factors that affect sequence coverage, and consequently SNP detection, are the volume of aligned sequence data generated from an experiment and the efficiency of the enrichment reaction. The former can be increased by repeating the sequencing experiment and/or loading a higher quantity of library DNA onto the flowcell to generate more data, sequencing to a longer read length, performing paired-end sequencing and implementing newer calling algorithms that can identify more sequence reads on a flowcell. The efficiency of the enrichment reaction is largely dependent on its design. In this study, we used a relaxed repeat masking protocol in an effort to increase the proportion of the PTBP2 and CDC42 genes that could be sequenced. Although this did allow us to sequence more of these genes than would have been possible with the stricter Agilent default repeat masking settings, it came at a cost of generating more off-target sequence. On-target sequence using this enrichment reaction was ~21%. This is lower than achieved in other studies that used the SureSelect system (42–5012 and 40–45%14) or Agilent microarray capture (36–76,17 36–5516 and 37–54% for whole exome resequencing15). In this study, the reduction in on-target specificity is most likely due to the relaxed repeat masking used in the design of the target enrichment reaction, which resulted in a large proportion of reads mapping to repetitive regions (Supplementary Fig. SB). The advantage of implementing the default repeat masking settings during SureSelect eArray design will be greater on-target specificity. The disadvantage of these settings is that it will not be possible to target some genomic regions. How punitive this will be depends on the proportion of target regions that contains repetitive sequences. It will certainly impact on studies that plan to sequence entire genes including introns. For example, in this study, just under 40% of CDC42 could be targeted with default repeat masking settings. However, studies targeting exonic sequence at multiple sites will be less influenced by repetitive sequence.In summary, we have designed an effective strategy to allow target enrichment and sequencing of multiple samples in parallel using DNA indexing. This method is very accurate for SNP detection. By combining DNA samples prior to enrichment, this method dramatically saves on enrichment and sequencing costs, and the inclusion of the DNA index permits each sample to be analyzed individually downstream. The method is an important inclusion in the range of next-generation sequencing applications below the level of whole exome resequencing but with the capability to sequence the exonic regions of hundreds of genes in tens of samples in a single sequencing experiment.Supplementary DataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis material is based on works supported by the Science Foundation Ireland (SFI/07/RFP/GEN/F327/EC07) and the Health Research Board (Ireland) (HRB/HRA/2009/45).Supplementary data"

IntroductionCircadian rhythms are endogenous biological oscillations with a period of 1 day, and they are controlled by an autonomous oscillator, the circadian clock.1 This clock regulates the timing of metabolism, physiology and behaviour of organisms, coordinating them with environmental factors that cycle with the rotation of the earth.1,2 The mechanisms of the eukaryotic clocks are proposed to be founded on interlocked autoregulatory loops between genes that function as components of the clock machinery, whereas the identities of these genes are largely different between animals, plants and fungi.3 In the model dicot Arabidopsis thaliana, a representative set of such component genes is the pseudo-response regulator (PRR) gene family, which comprises five member genes, TOC1 (also called PRR1)/PRR3/PRR5/PRR7/PRR9, which play regulatory roles at multiple nodes in the interlocked loops of the A. thaliana circadian network.4 All the PRR genes are, largely based on phenotypic analyses of mutants, supposed to be functionally important in the A. thaliana circadian system.5 Although phenotypic changes in a single mutation of each PRR gene are not large, combinations of mutations of different PRRs often result in stronger phenotypes, e.g. essentially arrhythmic in an extreme case.4PRRs share a conserved domain, the receiver-like domain (RLD), along with another domain CONSTANS/CONSTANS-LIKE/TOC1 (CCT). The RLD is similar to the receiver domain of the RRs in the histidine to aspartic acid (His–Asp) phosphorelay, a versatile signal transduction system in organisms from bacteria to eukaryotes other than animals.5,6 In the His–Asp phosphorelay, a phosphate group is transferred from a histidine kinase (HK), via an intermediate signal transducer histidine-containing phosphotransmitter (HPt), down to a counterpart RR, thereby transducing various environmental and endogenous signals intracellularly.6 An aspartic acid residue in the receiver domain of RRs is conserved as the phosphoacceptor site,6 whereas the RLDs of all the A. thaliana PRRs lack this aspartic acid residue, and they carry a glutamic acid instead.5,6 Consistent with this, Makino et al.7 showed that the RLD of TOC1 did not undergo phosphotransfer in vitro.Here, we hypothesize that the ancestors of PRRs were authentic RRs and they have lost the phosphorelay function through the course of evolution. If so, it is of particular interest to know in what evolutionary scenario PRRs lost the phosphorelay function, in order to understand the evolution of plant clock machineries. Homologue sequences of the A. thaliana PRR genes have recently been characterized in several other angiosperms.8–15 Importantly, Corellou et al.16 recently showed that the green alga Ostreococcus tauri has a PRR homologue sequence (OtTOC1) that functions as a master clock gene. The OtTOC1 protein carries a potential phosphoacceptor aspartic acid in its RLD,16 indicating that the substitution of the aspartic acid to the glutamic acid is likely to date back to the period between the emergence of the green alga and the divergence of angiosperms. It would be informative, therefore, to characterize their homologues from non-angiosperm land plants, which cover a wide spectrum of phylogenetic groups.17,18Physcomitrella patens, a species of Bryopsida (moss), one of the basal land plants,17,18 diverged from vascular plant lineages at least 450 million years ago.18 This moss is an attractive model plant because various molecular biology techniques such as targeted gene disruption have been well established.19 In a recent study, we isolated and characterized two P. patens cDNAs PpCCA1a and PpCCA1b encoding moss homologues of A. thaliana CCA1/LHY. CCA1/LHY is a pair of paralogous single myb proteins, which function as another type of important component proteins in the A. thaliana circadian network.3,4 Disruption experiments on PpCCA1a and PpCCA1b genes indicate that these two genes are functional counterparts of CCA1/LHY.20 We also identified four candidate genes that encode PRR homologues in the P. patens genome database.20–22 We isolated the full-length cDNA for one of these four moss PRR genes and showed that this gene is expressed in a circadian manner.20 Very recently, Holm et al.23 reported a survey of clock-associated genes on the P. patens genome database, including the four moss PRRs. They constructed an unrooted tree of plant PRR homologues, in which the four moss PRRs clustered independently from angiosperm PRR subfamilies.23In this study, we isolated and characterized cDNAs for the remaining three moss PRR genes, for which gene structures were so far predicted only from the genomic sequences. Using experimentally validated sequences of the moss PRR cDNAs, we constructed a rooted phylogenetic tree, thereby clearly defining the evolution of plant PRRs. We also conducted biochemical characterization and expression analyses of the moss PRRs; the results of these experiments suggest that at least one of the moss PRRs functions as an authentic RR and that there are intraspecific divergences among the moss PRRs. Finally, we will discuss scenarios of the evolution and divergence of PRR homologue genes in land plants.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materials, growth conditions and light treatmentPhyscomitrella patens ssp. patens24 was maintained in 12-h light and 12-h dark cycles (12:12LD) under white fluorescent light (light intensity ~40 µmol m-2 s-1) at 25°C. Protonemal and gametophore tissues were grown on BCDAT/G medium and BCD medium, respectively, both supplemented with 1 mM CaCl2.25 Protonemal cells were collected every 5–7 days and were ground with a homogenizer before application to new BCDAT agar plates. For light sources of the light induction experiments, the light-emitting diodes (STICK LED, Tokyo Rikakikai) were used for blue light (<U+03BB>max = 470 nm) and the red-emitting fluorescent tubes (FL20S-Re-66, Toshiba Lighting & Technology) filtered through a red plastic sheet (Acrylite102, Mitsubishi Rayon) for red light (<U+03BB>max = 660 nm). White light was provided by fluorescence lumps (FL20SS-W/18, Toshiba Lighting & Technology).2.2. Identification and isolation of cDNAs covering the entire coding regions of PpPRRsThe 5'- and 3'-terminal portions of the PpPRR2 and PpPRR4 cDNAs were RACE-amplified using GeneRacer (Invitrogen) with primers based on the JGI database sequences. The amplified cDNA fragments were cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) and sequenced with DYEenamic ET terminator [GE Healthcare (Former Amersham Biosciences)]. The middle region of each gene was amplified by RT-PCR with primers based on the RACE-amplified sequences. The entire regions of both cDNAs were amplified with KOD plus polymerase Ver.2 (TOYOBO), subjected to A-tailing by Taq polymerase (TAKARA Bio), cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector and sequenced using a primer walking method. The PpPRR3 cDNA that spans its entire coding region was amplified with KOD plus polymerase Ver.2 using primers based on the JGI database sequences. Nucleotide sequences were assembled by DNASIS software (Hitachi software engineering). All primer sets used are described in Supplementary file 1.2.3. Phylogenetic analysesAmino acid sequences of PRR homologues were aligned using the ClustalW program26 and the numbers of amino acid substitutions between each pair of PRR proteins were estimated by the Jones–Taylor–Thornton (JTT) model27 with the complete-deletion option. From the estimated numbers of amino acid substitutions, a phylogenetic tree was reconstructed using the minimum evolution (ME) method.28 The bootstrap values were calculated with 1000 replications.29 These procedures were all performed using MEGA4.1 software (http://www.megasoftware.net/index.html30). We also reconstructed a phylogenetic tree by the maximum-likelihood method using PhyML (http://atgc.lirmm.fr/phyml/31) applying the JTT model for amino acid substitutions. We obtained a similar phylogeny pattern with both the methods.2.4. Semi-quantitative and quantitative RT-PCR analysesSemi-quantitative RT-PCR (sqRT-PCR) analysis was performed as described previously.20 We conducted preliminary experiments to improve its quantitativeness as follows. First, thermal cycle numbers were optimized so that signals from PCR products did not reach a plateau. Next, we confirmed that when various known relative amounts of cDNA for each tested gene were used as PCR templates, the amount of the PCR product of each reaction showed a linear relationship with that of the input cDNA. The primers and optimal cycle numbers for PCR are described in Supplementary file 1. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis was performed as described previously.32 The primers are same as those used in the qRT-PCR analysis (Supplementary file 1).2.5. Construction of plasmidsTo express the PpPRR1 and PpPRR2 RLD peptides in E. coli cells, a cold shock expression system (pCold-II vector; TAKARA Bio) was used as follows. The coding region for the RLD of each PpPRR protein was PCR-amplified with primers described in Supplementary file 1. The resultant fragment was cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector, digested with KpnI and XbaI and inserted into KpnI–XbaI-cleaved pCold-II vector (pCold-II-His-PRR1 and pCold-II-His-PRR2 for PpPRR1 RLD and PpPRR2 RLD, respectively). The nucleotide sequence was determined by DYEenamic ET terminator. The RLD peptides are fused with a 6×His-tag, by expression from pCold-II vector, allowing their purification with a TALON™ metal affinity resin column as described below.2.6. Expression and purification of the PpPRR1 and PpPRR2 RLD peptidesThe E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) harbouring pG-KJE8 (TAKARA Bio), which encodes chaperone proteins DnaK, DnaJ, GrpE, GroEL and GroES, was transformed with pCold-II-His-PRR1 or pCold-II-His-PRR2. To overproduce the RLD peptides of PpPRR1 and PpPRR2, each transformant was cultivated in 1 l of LB medium containing ampicillin (50 µg ml-1), Chloramphenicol (25 µg ml-1), tetracycline (20 ng ml-1) and l-arabinose (10 mg ml-1) at 37°C until the logarithmic phase of growth in a rotary shaker (at 110 r.p.m.). They were cold-shocked by standing at 15°C for 30 min after the addition of IPTG at the final concentration of 1 mM and cultured in a shaker (at 110 r.p.m.) at 15°C for 5 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation and suspended in 20 ml of a standard buffer [50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl and 10% glycerol]. The cell suspension was mixed with DNase I (25 µg ml-1), EDTA (1.25 mM) and lysozyme (250 µg ml-1) at 4°C for 15 min, and then passed through a French Press at 100 MPa. The resultant cell lysate was centrifuged and separated from cell debris and then applied onto a TALON™ metal affinity resin (Clontech Laboratories) column. After washing the TALON™ column with 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0), 10% glycerol and 100 mM NaCl, each of 6×His-tagged PpPRR1 and PpPRR2 RLD peptides was eluted with the same buffer including 250 mM imidazole and finally dialysed against 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0) and 10% glycerol. Dialysed semi-purified protein was concentrated by loading on Amicon Ultra Filter (Ultracel-10K, Millipore) and centrifuged for 15 min at 4700 r.p.m. at 4°C. The sample was quantified by the Lowry method33 and subjected to SDS–PAGE and detected with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. It was also analysed by western blotting with anti-6×His antibodies (Cat. No. A190-114A, Bethyl Laboratories).2.7. Preparation of the E. coli ArcB-enriched cytoplasmic membraneEscherichia coli DAC903/pIA001-ArcB and DAC903/pIN-III were used as an ArcB overproducer and a negative control, respectively.34 From each strain, membrane vesicles were isolated and pelleted as an insoluble fraction of the cell lysate according to the method of Azuma et al.35 They were suspended in a small volume of a buffer comprising 50 mM Tris-acetate (pH 8.0), 1 mM DTT, 2% glycerol and 250 mM sucrose in order to isolate cytoplasmic membrane as follows. The suspended membrane vesicles were layered over a 21-ml five steps gradient of sucrose dissolved in the same buffer (3 ml of 50%, 9 ml of 45%, 3 ml of 40%, 3 ml of 35% and 3 ml of 30% from bottom to top) in a bottle assembly polycarbonate tube (part no. 355618, Beckman Coulter) and centrifuged at 47 000 r.p.m. for 2 h at 4°C with the type 50.2 Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter). The cytoplasmic membrane was collected by taking the fraction between the layers of 35 and 40% sucrose and diluted with a large volume of a buffer (TAGS-buffer) comprising 50 mM Tris-acetate (pH 7.8), 1 mM DTT, 10% glycerol, 100 mM sucrose. The cytoplasmic membrane was collected by centrifugation at 127 000g for 2 h and then resuspended in a small volume of TAGS-buffer. Finally, F1-ATPase was stripped from the cytoplasmic membrane as follows. The isolated cytoplasmic membrane (2 mg of protein) was treated with 1 ml of TAGS-buffer containing 4 M urea for 30 min on ice, and then recovered by centrifugation at 50 000 r.p.m. for 30 min. Then, the pellet was washed once with 1 ml of TGS buffer and finally with 1 ml of a buffer comprising 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mM DTT and 10% glycerol. The urea-treated cytoplasmic membrane was suspended in 0.5 ml of the same buffer and stored at -80°C.2.8. In vitro autophosphorylation assayIn vitro autophosphorylation reaction of the ArcB protein was carried out according to the method of Azuma et al.,35 4.0 µg of ArcB-enriched Escherichia coli cytoplasmic membrane was incubated with 0.05 mM <U+03B3>-[32P]-ATP (37 kBq) in TEG buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0, 0.35 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol) containing 5 mM MgCl2, 200 mM KCl and 2 mM DTT at 25°C for 1, 5 and 10 min. Four micrograms of E. coli cytoplasmic membrane, which was prepared from the strain which does not overproduce ArcB, was also used as a negative control experiment. The reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS–PAGE sample buffer [finally 20 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0), 1% ß-mercaptoethanol, 1% SDS, 6% glycerol and 0.02% Bromophenol Blue]. The samples were subjected to SDS–PAGE. The gel was dried and analysed with an imaging scanner (BAS-2500; Fuji Film).2.9. In vitro His–Asp phosphotransfer assayIn vitro His–Asp phosphotransfer reaction from ArcB to the RLD peptides of PpPRR1 and PpPRR2 was examined according to the method of Azuma et al.35 Four micrograms of E. coli ArcB-enriched cytoplasmic membrane was incubated with 0.05 mM <U+03B3>-[32P]-ATP (37 kBq) and 4.5 µg of semi-purified PpPRR1 or PpPRR2 RLD peptide in TEG buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0, 0.35 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol) containing 5 mM MgCl2, 200 mM KCl and 2 mM DTT at 25°C for 1, 5 and 10 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS–PAGE sample buffer. The samples were subjected to SDS–PAGE. The gel was dried and analysed with BAS-2500.3. Results3.1. Phylogenetic analyses of the moss PpPRR genesPreviously, we identified four PRR homologue genes, PpPRR1 (protein ID in the JGI P. patens database: 154145), PpPRR2 (165025), PpPRR3 (173125) and PpPRR4 (165029) in the JGI genome database.21 We characterized the PpPRR1 gene (and its corresponding cDNA) as ‘PpPRRa' before,20 but in this paper, we use the name ‘PpPRR1', not PpPRRa, to avoid confusion. Holm et al. also followed this nomenclature (PpPRR1–PpPRR4) deposited in the JGI genome database.21 Other than these four sequences, we found no gene models that are significantly similar to the angiosperm PRR genes in the moss genome. We isolated cDNAs that cover the entire coding regions for the PpPRR2, PpPRR3 and PpPRR4 genes and confirmed that all of their predicted proteins share, as do PpPRR1,20 an N-terminal RLD and a C-terminal CCT domain (Fig. 1a and b; Supplementary file 2). The receiver domains of authentic RRs share the aspartic acid–aspartic acid–lysine (DDK) motif, essential for the phosphotransfer activity,36,37 whereas the first two residues of this motif are diverged in the angiosperm PRR proteins (Fig. 1a; for review, see Mizuno and Nakamichi4 and Mizuno6). In all the available angiosperm PRR sequences, the second aspartic acid, conserved as the phosphoacceptor residue in the His–Asp phosphotransfer, is replaced by a glutamic acid (E) (Fig. 1a). In contrast, RLDs of moss PpPRR proteins are all predicted to retain the second aspartic acid; furthermore, PpPRR2, PpPRR3 and PpPRR4 also retain the first aspartic acid, hence exhibiting the complete DDK motif (Fig. 1a). PpPRR1 replaces the first aspartic acid residue with a tyrosine (Y) (Fig. 1a). These observations suggest that at least PpPRR2, PpPRR3 and PpPRR4 are potentially phosphorylated by a HK(s) as authentic RRs. The CCT domain is well conserved in all PpPRR proteins (Fig. 1b). Alignment of conserved domains of PRR homologues from various species. RLDs (a) and CCT domains (b) of PRR homologue sequences from various plant species are aligned using ClustalW program.26 Shading was performed using BOXSHADE ver 3.21 (http://www.ch.embnet.org/software/BOX_form.html). Amino acids identical or similar in more than 70% of the sequences are shaded by black or grey background, respectively. The number at the end of each line indicates the rightmost amino acid. Arrowheads show amino acids corresponding to the DDK motif.

We used the PRR homologue of the green alga O. tauri (OtTOC1)16 as the outgroup because: (i) OtTOC1 is positioned relatively distant from any other PRR homologue sequences in an unrooted tree of PRRs23; and (ii) OtTOC1 is sister to all the other PRR homologue sequences when an authentic RR sequence is used as the outgroup (Supplementary file 3). Also included were three algal sequences: two from C. reinhardtii and one from Chlorella variabilis. In the phylogenetic tree, the angiosperm sequences are divided, as previously reported,8,12,15 into three groups: TOC1, PRR7/3 and PRR9/5 (Fig. 2). The TOC1 group is basal to all the other sequences that include both PRR7/3 and PRR9/5 groups, indicating a more ancient origin of the TOC1 group than the other two groups. The four moss PpPRR sequences are grouped with one another, further forming a cluster with two lycophyte sequences, and this cluster is sister to the PRR7/3 group (Fig. 2). This indicates that the moss PpPRR genes are more closely related to the PRR7/3 group than to the two other groups. The four moss sequences are divided into two groups PpPRR1/PpPRR3 and PpPRR2/PpPRR4 (Fig. 2). Phylogenetic tree of PRR homologues in various plants. Amino acid sequences of PRR homologues including entire RLD and CCT domain regions were aligned using ClustalW program and the phylogenetic tree was reconstructed by the ME method28 by using MEGA4.1.30 The O. tauri PRR homologue (OtTOC116) was used as the outgroup.

For other sequences, refer to the legend for Fig. 1.Next, we compared the distribution of intron insertion sites on the RLD and CCT coding regions between PRR genes (Fig. 3). In the RLD region, two insertion sites are conserved among all the PRR sequences examined (Fig. 3a; see Takata et al.15). This distribution pattern of intron insertion sites is clearly different from those seen in the receiver domain of authentic RRs,13 confirming the idea that PRR genes diverged distinctly from authentic RR genes. In the CCT domain region, the TOC1 group sequences are unique in that they show no intron, whereas all sequences in the other two groups have a conserved single insertion site in the middle of the domain (Fig. 3b; see Takata et al.15). PpPRR sequences are divided into two groups, PpPRR1/PpPRR3 with one intron (like the PRR7/3 and PRR9/5 groups) and PpPRR2/PpPRR4 with no intron (like the TOC1 group; Fig. 3). This divergence is consistent with the results of the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 2), whereas the loss of an intron in PpPRR2/PpPRR4 should have occurred in the moss lineage independently from the TOC1 group (Fig. 2). Distribution of intron insertion sites on the conserved domains of PRR sequences. From the aligned amino acid sequences of PRR proteins, only three stretches [two from RLD (a) and one from CCT (b)] are shown, each consisting of nine amino acids with the amino acid corresponding to an intron insertion site (shaded in grey) being centred. The number of the rightmost amino acid of each stretch is indicated in parentheses. For the sequences used, refer to the legend of Fig. 2.Distribution of intron insertion sites on the conserved domains of PRR sequences. From the aligned amino acid sequences of PRR proteins, only three stretches [two from RLD (a) and one from CCT (b)] are shown, each consisting of nine amino acids with the amino acid corresponding to an intron insertion site (shaded in grey) being centred. The number of the rightmost amino acid of each stretch is indicated in parentheses. For the sequences used, refer to the legend of Fig. 2.3.2. In vitro phosphotransfer from a HK to the RLD of PpPRR2We examined whether RLDs of PpPRR1 and PpPRR2, both of which retain the potential phosphoacceptor residue while showing mutually diverged features (Figs 1–3), are phosphorylated by a His–Asp phosphorelay process in an in vitro phosphotransfer assay (Fig. 4). In this assay, ArcB, an E. coli HK, added in excess and hence lacking substrate specificity, transfers its phosphate to the phosphoacceptor site in a receiver domain. We purified the RLD peptides of PpPRR1 and PpPRR2 overexpressed in E. coli cells (Fig. 4b and c) and tested each of them to assess whether or not they undergo phosphotransfer. The PpPRR2 RLD peptide was phosphorylated within 5 min in the presence of ArcB (Fig. 4g). The phosphorylation levels of ArcB decreased concomitantly (Fig. 4g), indicating that the phosphorylation of PpPRR2 RLD is due to phosphotransfer from ArcB. On the other hand, we could not detect any phosphorylation signal with PpPRR1 RLD (Fig. 4f), consistent with its relatively diverged RLD sequence (Fig. 1a). When the PpPRR2 RLD peptide was incubated with the membrane fraction with no overexpressed ArcB, we could not detect the phosphorylation signal (Fig. 4h). This supports the interpretation that the increased levels of phosphorylation seen with the PpPRR2 RLD peptide (Fig. 4g) is due to phosphotransfer from ArcB, but not due to other types of kinases. These observations indicate that PpPRR2 presumably functions as an RR in an unknown His–Asp phosphorelay signal transduction pathway in P. patens. Moreover, PpPRRs likely diverged from one another based not only on their RLD sequences but also on their phosphotransfer ability. In vitro His–Asp phosphotransfer to the PpPRR2 RLD peptide. (a) Overproduction of ArcB in E. coli cells. The cytoplasmic membrane proteins were extracted from an ArcB overproducer (right lane) and a negative control strain of E. coli (left lane), subjected to SDS–PAGE and detected with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (C.B.B.)

Circadian regulation of PpPRR expression profilesIn a previous study,20 we reported that the PpPRR1 mRNA accumulation showed circadian variation in 12-h light and 12-h dark cycles (12:12LD) and in continuous darkness (DD), but not in continuous light (LL), by conducting sqRT-PCR analysis. Here, we studied mRNA accumulation profiles for all four PpPRR genes with the same method (Fig. 5). In 12:12LD, all genes showed high-amplitude mRNA rhythms with a period of ~1 day, which peaked in the latter half of the light phase (Fig. 5a). In DD, all genes showed endogenous rhythms with damping (Fig. 5b). These rhythms in 12:12LD or DD showed phase relationships roughly similar to A. thaliana PRR3, PRR5 or PRR7 genes.4,6 In LL, in contrast, all the genes exhibited no hint of circadian regulation and were arrhythmic as demonstrated for PpPRR1 (Fig. 5c; see Okada et al.20). The arrhythmic profiles in LL are consistent with our observations that the moss genes so far tested are, if clock gene homologues or clock-controlled genes, all arrhythmic in LL,38–40 and this is in contrast to angiosperm PRR genes, all of which show robust circadian rhythms in LL.4,6Changes in mRNA abundance for the PpPRR genes under 12:12LD, DD and LL conditions examined by the sqRT-PCR analysis. Physcomitrella patens protonemal cells were maintained in 12:12LD for more than 2 weeks after which cells were harvested in 12:12LD (a), DD (b) or LL (c) conditions at indicated times. From the top, changes in mRNA abundance for PpPRR1, PpPRR2, PpPRR3 and PpPRR4 are shown. Light conditions are overlaid with each graph: regions with no shade and those shaded with dark grey represent light and dark phases, respectively; regions shaded with light grey represent subjective light phases in (b) or subjective dark phases in (c). Graphs show the results of quantification of the mRNA levels for each gene after normalization to those for actin as a control.39 The maximum levels are set to 1.0. The photo below each graph shows the hybridized bands for each test gene or the control actin gene, detected as chemiluminescence signals. We obtained similar results in two independent experiments.Changes in mRNA abundance for the PpPRR genes under 12:12LD, DD and LL conditions examined by the sqRT-PCR analysis.

The photo below each graph shows the hybridized bands for each test gene or the control actin gene, detected as chemiluminescence signals. We obtained similar results in two independent experiments.The results of the sqRT-PCR experiments suggest that phases of the four genes seem to be differentially fine-tuned into two types: in 12:12LD, troughs of PpPRR1/PpPRR3 occurred 4 h before dawn, whereas those of PpPRR2/PpPRR4 just at dawn (Fig. 5a). We also measured mRNA accumulation for PpPRRs in one cycle of 12:12LD by the qRT-PCR analysis with a shorter sampling interval (Fig. 6). At ZT01 (ZT, zeitgeber time: time in a light–dark cycle, putting the light onset as ZT0), the levels of PpPRR1/PpPRR3 showed certain increase (30–40% of the maximum levels), whereas those of PpPRR2/PpPRR4 were still very close to zero (Fig. 6), confirming the distinction of expression profiles between PpPRR1/PpPRR3 and PpPRR2/PpPRR4. This differential fine-tuning appears to be conferred by the endogenous circadian clock, because the sampling of cells at dawn (Fig. 5a, hours 0 and 24) was performed in the absence of light. This idea is also supported by the rhythms of PpPRRs in DD, where endogenous clock regulation is more clearly seen: the first peaks of PpPRR2/PpPRR4 lagged behind those of PpPRR1/PpPRR3 by around 4 h (Fig. 5b; Supplementary file 4). Changes in mRNA abundance for the PpPRR genes for one 12:12LD cycle examined by the qRT-PCR analysis. Physcomitrella patens protonemal cells were maintained in 12:12LD for more than 2 weeks after which cells were harvested in one full cycle of 12:12LD at indicated times. Shown are the changes in mRNA abundance for PpPRR1 (a), PpPRR2 (b), PpPRR3 (c) and PpPRR4 (d). Light conditions are overlaid with each graph: regions with no shade and those shaded with dark grey represent light and dark phases, respectively. The graphs show the averages and the standard deviations of four independent experiments, in which the results of quantification of mRNA levels for each gene were normalized to those of actin as a control.39Changes in mRNA abundance for the PpPRR genes for one 12:12LD cycle examined by the qRT-PCR analysis.

Induction of PpPRR by lightWe examined the effect of light on the accumulation of the PpPRR mRNAs by sqRT-PCR analyses. The mRNAs of all four PpPRRs were induced by a 2-h pulse of white, blue or red light (Fig. 7). The rates of induction by white light are 8.7 for PpPRR1, 2.6 for PpPRR2, 6.2 for PpPRR3 and 2.5 for PpPRR4. The rates of induction for PpPRR1 and PpPRR3 are the highest and second highest, respectively, for any colour of light; this observation does not contradict the idea that there is an intraspecific divergence between PpPRR1/PpPRR3 and PpPRR2/PpPRR4. The rates of induction by blue light and red light are lower than those of white light for any PpPRR gene. Light-induced expression of the PpPRR genes examined by the sqRT-PCR analysis. Physcomitrella patens protonemal cells were maintained under LL for 1 week, exposed to darkness for 24 h, and 2 h of white light, blue light, red light or dark period was administered before the cells were sampled. The fluence rate of each colour or light was 40 µmol m-2 s-1. Total RNAs were extracted, and the abundances of PpPRR mRNAs were measured and normalized to those for actin as a control. The graph shows the mRNA levels of PpPRRs induced by different colour of light (white light, open bars; blue light, bars with horizontal hatches; red light, bars with vertical hatches) relative to those from samples maintained in the prolonged darkness, the latter of which are set to 1.0. Values are the mean ± SD of three replications. The bottom photos show the hybridized bands for PpPRRs (upper four slips) or the control actin gene for each PpPRR (lower four slips), detected as chemiluminescence signals.

We obtained similar results in two independent experiments.4. DiscussionThe results of the current study help to understand the origins of the angiosperm PRR genes. In our in vitro assay, the PpPRR2 RLD peptide underwent phosphotransfer (Fig. 4), consistent with its complete DDK motif (Fig. 1a), strongly suggesting that PpPRR2 functions as an RR. Besides, according to our phylogenetic tree (Fig. 2), PpPRRs are phylogenetically closely related to angiosperm PRRs. Therefore, it is presumed that the similarity of RLDs of PRRs to the authentic receiver domain is not only superficial but that PRRs were certainly derived from an authentic RR. Most probably, angiosperm PRRs have lost their phosphorelay function through the course of evolution, largely due to the substitution of the phosphoacceptor aspartic acid to a glutamic acid in their RLDs, and other critical residues such as the first aspartic acid of the DDK motif should have concomitantly diverged. Importantly, the O. tauri OtTOC1 and the C. reinhardtii CrPRR2 also share not only the potential phosphoacceptor aspartic acid but also the entire DDK motif (Fig. 1a; see Corellou et al.16). Although there has so far been no report about whether or not these algal proteins undergo phosphotransfer, they are also assumed to function as RRs, representing prototypic proteins of the land plant PRRs.Our results also offer evolutionary explanations not only for the origin but also for the diversity of PRRs in land plants (Fig. 8). The pattern of our tree indicates that the TOC1 group first diverged, and then split the PRR9/5 group and the other branch, the latter containing the PRR7/3 group. Since PpPRRs are positioned inside the branch containing the PRR7/3 group, the origins of the TOC1 and PRR9/5 groups date back before the divergence of moss from higher plant lineages. The ancient origin of the TOC1 group is supported by the observation that C. reinhardtii and C. variabilis seem to have a TOC1 ortholog (Fig. 2). Furthermore, since the cluster of PpPRRs and lycophyte SmPRR7a/7b is sister to all the angiosperm PRR7/3 sequences (Fig. 2), the divergence between the PRR7/3 group and the ancestor of PpPRRs and SmPRR7a/7b also predate the divergence of moss from higher plants. Therefore, the common ancestor of moss and higher plants possessed TOC1, PRR7/3 and PRR9/5 orthologues in its genome, but these genes appear to have been lost later within the moss lineage (Fig. 8). In the lycophyte lineage, PRR7/3 and PRR9/5 orthologues have been lost and the unique combination of the TOC1 (SmTOC1) and PpPRR (SmPRR7a/7b) orthologues still now remain (Fig. 8). In the angiosperm lineage, only PpPRR ortholog(s) has been lost, resulting in the current three PRR groups (Fig. 8). Concerning the timings of substitution of the phosphoacceptor residue, there are two alternative explanations. In one scenario (Fig. 8a), the phosphoacceptor aspartic acid residue of the PpPRRs and SmPRR7a/7b can be traced back to that found in the algal sequences; the phosphoacceptor residue in these sequences has never been substituted. This explanation might seem simple and more likely; however, if this were the case, the aspartic acid residue must have been substituted, according to the branching patterns of our tree, independently within each lineage of the TOC1, PRR7/3 and PRR9/5 groups (Figs 2 and 8a). In another scenario (Fig. 8b), simpler at least in terms of the frequency of substitutions, the aspartic acid was substituted only once to a glutamic acid before the divergence of all the land plant PRR subfamilies. In this case, an aspartic acid was regained by a second substitution in the ancestral lineage of PpPRRs and two lycophyte genes (Fig. 8b). If this were the case, PpPRR1 might be, again, in the process of divergence from authentic RR-type sequences. In order to know which hypothesis, or yet another scenario, is more plausible, we need more sequence data; in particular, PRR sequences should be characterized from other primitive plants, i.e. liverworts, hornworts, ferns and gymnosperms. Evolutionary scenarios for divergence of PpPRR genes in land plants. Two alternative explanations are presented: (a) scenario in which the phosphoacceptor aspartic acid residue in PpPRR and SmPRR7a/7b sequences has never been substituted and (b) scenario in which the aspartic acid was substituted to glutamic acid only once and it was regained by a second substitution in the ancestral lineage of PpPRRs and two lycophyte genes. Closed circles represent amino acid substitution events at the potential phosphoacceptor residue. Grey circles represent alternative timings of amino acid substitutions indicated by the closed circles.

Grey circles represent alternative timings of amino acid substitutions indicated by the closed circles. Crosses represent gene loss events (see the main text for detailed description).Our results demonstrate intraspecific divergences among the PpPRR genes. The phylogenetic tree (Fig. 2), intron insertion sites (Fig. 3) and expression profiles (Figs 5–7 and Supplementary file 4) suggest the divergence between PpPRR1/PpPRR3 and PpPRR2/PpPRR4. The A. thaliana PRR family members show differentially regulated expression profiles, reflecting the fact that they act at different nodes in the circadian network and functionally diverged from one another.4,6 Therefore, PpPRR1/PpPRR3 and PpPRR2/PpPRR4 are also predicted to be functionally diverged. It should be noted that Holm et al.23 did not detect any differential expression among the four genes in a light–dark cycle followed by DD. This may be because their light–dark regime is different from ours: they used a long day regime, a 16-h light and 8-h dark cycle, whereas ours is a 12-h light and 12-h dark cycle(s) (12:12LD; Figs 5 and 6). All PpPRRs are induced by light (Fig. 7), and this light responsiveness may have apparently synchronized the trough phases of PpPRRs with the earlier dawn in the short night of their long day regime, whereas difference in trough phases between PpPRR1/PpPRR3 and PpPRR2/PpPRR4 are obvious in our longer nights (Fig. 5a).On the other hand, the results of the in vitro assay (Fig. 4) and detailed sequence comparison (Fig. 1a) suggest that PpPRR2/PpPRR3/PpPRR4 function as RRs, whereas PpPRR1 does not or its phosphotransfer ability is very weak. The moss PpPRRs, if not all of them, are anticipated to have some clock-associated functions as do A. thaliana PRRs, from the following facts: (i) the circadian networks of A. thaliana and P. patens are predicted to be at least partially conserved20; and (ii) O. tauri, which belongs to green algae, the closest relative of land plants, has a PRR homologue that functions as a clock gene.16 Since RRs are generally involved in signalling cascades responsive to environmental/endogenous signals, PpPRR2/PpPRR3/PpPRR4 might function, rather than in the core clock circuitry, in an input pathway(s) that must be responsive to environmental cues such as light and temperature.In a future study, in parallel with gene knock out experiments, it should also be addressed whether PpPRRs are involved in phosphotransfer functions in planta. Moreover, a HK(s) and a HPt(s) that are partners to (at least some of) PpPRR proteins should be characterized. It might not be easy to identify a partner HK(s) because the P. patens genome contains as many as ~50 HK sequences,22 unlike A. thaliana, which contains only 8 HK genes.41 However, the availability of the entire genome sequence, many full-length cDNA clones and the tractability of gene functional analysis based on gene targeting techniques will support the identification of such HK and HPt genes in P. patens, possibly as novel clock genes.4.1. ConclusionHere, we demonstrated that the moss PpPRRs have close relationships with angiosperm PRRs and at least PpPRR2 can function as an RR, indicating that the plant clock-associated PRR families are derived from an authentic RR(s). Moreover, here, we offered evolutionary explanations for divergence of PRR genes in land plants. This study should be a foundation for understanding how a particular set of genes involved in regulation of the clock evolved their functions, in coordination with changes (or maintenance) of the clock mechanisms.4.2.

IntroductionChickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) is the third most consumed legume crop, which is cultivated in arid and semi-arid areas around the world.1 Chickpea is a self-pollinated, diploid (2n = 2x = 16) and annual plant with a moderate genome size of about 740 Mb. Despite growing demand and high-yield potential, chickpea productivity is very low. Several biotic such as Ascochyta blight, dry root rot, Fusarium wilt and pod borer, and abiotic such as drought, salinity and low temperature, constraints are major factors for lower chickpea production. Modern breeding technologies with biotechnological techniques are required to increase the productivity.2 Unfortunately, very limited genomic information is available for chickpea.Various genomic tools have facilitated greatly the development of improved genotypes/varieties in several crop species.3,4 Although a few expressed sequence tags (ESTs) have been generated and gene-based markers have been developed, the functional genomics studies in chickpea is still in its infancy. Most of the ESTs have been generated with the aim to identify the candidate genes involved in various abiotic and biotic stress responses and development of molecular markers.5–9 In addition, other microarray and SAGE technologies have also been used to identify the stress-responsive transcriptome in chickpea.10,11 The efforts have been made to clone genes of interest via candidate gene approach.2 The function of a few genes in stress responses has also been demonstrated using transgenic approach.12,13The generation of large-scale ESTs is a very useful approach to accelerate the research on non-model species. Although ESTs and other cDNA sequences are among the most reliable evidences for the identification of gene-rich regions in a genome, gene identification and genome annotation, very less effort has been made for chickpea in this direction when compared with other crop plants. This is reflected by a very small number of ESTs (34 587) present in the dbEST database at NCBI (release 100110; 1 October 2010) for chickpea. The next generation sequencing technologies provide a cost-effective means of sequencing the transcriptome of an organism.14 Several studies have reported the transcriptome sequencing of various model and non-model species using these technologies. However, most of these studies are based on the long-read sequence data using 454 pyrosequencing or employing hybrid approach.15,16 Although the efforts have been made to develop tools for de novo assembly using short-read sequence data,17–19 their use in transcriptome assembly has not been well demonstrated yet. Recently, the de novo assembly of human transcriptome has been reported using ABySS program.20 Here, we present a de novo assembly approach for transcriptome of a plant species using only short-read sequence data.The present study has two major goals. First, we report a strategy for de novo assembly of transcriptome using short-read sequence data and effect of sequence quality and various parameters. Secondly, we report for the first time the complete transcriptome of chickpea, the legume crop plant. We have generated millions of sequence reads from chickpea transcriptome sequencing. A non-redundant set of transcripts have been generated and various analyses, including GC content analysis, sequence similarity/conservation with other plant species, functional categorization and identification of simple sequence repeats (SSRs) have been done. Our data provide a very useful genomic resource for future studies in chickpea.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materialChickpea (C. arietinum L. genotype ICC4958) seeds procured from ICRISAT, Hyderabad, India, were grown as described.21 Root and shoot tissue samples were collected from the 15-day-old seedlings grown in autoclaved mixture (1:1) of agropeat and vermiculite in 3in. plastic pots at 22 ± 1°C in a culture room with a photoperiod of 14 h. The mature leaves and flower buds were collected from plants grown in the field. At least three independent biological replicates of each tissue sample were harvested and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen.2.2. RNA isolation and quality controlsTotal RNA was extracted from all the tissue samples using TRI Reagent (Sigma Life Science, USA) according to manufacturer's instructions. The quality and quantity of each RNA sample was assessed as described previously.21 Only the RNA samples with 260 of 280 ratio from 1.9 to 2.1, 260 of 230 ratio from 2.0 to 2.5 and RIN (RNA integrity number) more than 8.0, were used for the analysis.2.3. Illumina sequencing and quality controlsThree cDNA libraries were generated using mRNA-Seq assay for transcriptome sequencing on Illumina Genome Analyzer II platform. One paired-end (PE) cDNA library was generated from the pooled total RNA of shoot, root, mature leaf and flower buds in equal quantity and sequencing was done in one lane to generate 72 bp PE reads. Two cDNA libraries were generated one each from total RNA of root and shoot tissues and sequencing was done in one lane each to generate 51 bp single-end (SE) reads. The library construction and sequencing was performed by commercial service providers (PE, Genotypic Technology, Bangalore, India; SE, BC Cancer Agency Genome Sciences Centre, Vancouver, Canada). The sequence data generated in this study have been deposited at NCBI in the Short Read Archive database under the accession number SRA023503 (experiment accession numbers SRX025413 and SRX025414 for PE and SE read sequencing, respectively). Various quality controls, including filtering of high-quality reads based on the score value given in fastq files, removal of reads containing primer/adaptor sequences and trimming of read length were done using in-house tool kit (Patel and Jain, unpublished). We evaluated the effect of sequence quality on the de novo assembly of sequence reads.2.4. De novo assemblyAll the assemblies were performed on a server with 48cores and 128GB random access memory. We used various programs for de novo assembly of the PE and SE sequence reads to generate a non-redundant set of transcripts. Among the various programs available, we validated publicly available program, Velvet (version 0.7.62; http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~zerbino/velvet/), which have been developed for assembly of short reads using de Bruijn graph algorithm.17 Various assembly parameters were also optimized for best results. In addition, we used other publicly available programs, including Oases (version 0.1.8; http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~zerbino/oases/), ABySS (version 1.1.2; http://www.bcgsc.ca/platform/bioinfo/software/abyss)18 and SOAPdenovo (version 1.04; http://soap.genomics.org.cn/soapdenovo.html), and commercially available CLC Genomics workbench (version 3.7.1), which have also been developed for de novo assembly of short reads, to obtain best assembly results with our data set.2.5. Similarity search and functional annotationThe proteome data sets for all the completely sequenced plant genomes so far were downloaded from their respective genome project websites. For generating non-redundant unigene data sets from various legume species, including Glycine max (soybean), Medicago truncatula, Lotus japonicus, Vigna unguiculata and Pisum sativum, all the available EST and mRNA sequences were downloaded from Genbank and assembled using TGI Clustering Tool (TGICL) after removing/trimming contaminating vector sequences and short reads (<100 bp) using SeqClean. The parameters used for assembly were more than 95% identity over a minimum of 40 bases with maximum of 20 bases of unmatched overhangs at sequence end. The chickpea transcripts were searched against proteome sequences and legume unigenes sets using BLASTX and TBLASTX searches, respectively, with an expect (E)-value cut-off of =1E-05 to reveal sequence conservation.To deduce the putative function, chickpea non-redundant transcript data set was subjected to BLASTX analysis against the non-redundant protein database of UniProt and all annotated protein sequences of Arabidopsis (available at The Arabidopsis Information Resource). The results of only the best hit were extracted and the hits with an E-value = 1E-05 were considered to be significant. The GOSlim terms for molecular function, biological process, and cellular component categories associated with the best BLASTX hit with Arabidopsis protein were assigned to the corresponding chickpea transcript. For the identification of transcription factor families represented in chickpea transcriptome, the chickpea transcripts were searched against all the transcription factor protein sequences at Plant transcription factor database (PlnTFDB; http://plntfdb.bio.uni-potsdam.de/v3.0/downloads.php) using BLASTX with an E-value cut-off of =1E-05.2.6. GC content analysis and SSRs identificationGC content analysis was done using in-house perl scripts. The perl script program MISA (MIcroSAtellite; http://pgrc.ipk-gatersleben.de/misa/) was used for identification of SSRs. The repeats of mono-nucleotide more than 10 times, di-nucleotides repeats more than 6 times, tri-, tetra-, penta- and hexa-nucleotide repeats more than 5 times were considered as search criteria in MISA script.2.7. Mapping of sequence reads onto chickpea transcriptsWe mapped all the reads from three experiments onto the non-redundant set of transcripts to quantify the abundance of transcripts assembled, using CLC Genomics Workbench and Maq (v0.7.1; http://maq.sourceforge.net/index.shtml) softwares and the number of reads and reads per million (rpm) corresponding to each transcript were determined. In addition, the coverage of each transcript was determined in terms of number of reads per kilobase per million (rpkm).3. Results3.1. Sequencing of chickpea transcriptomeWe generated a total of 134 954 354 sequence reads, including 65 900 072 PE sequence reads (32 950 036 from each end) each 72 bp in length and 69 054 282 SE sequence reads each 51 bp in length, encompassing about 21GB of sequence data in fastq format (Table 1). We filtered the sequence data for low-quality reads at high stringency (reads with more than 30% of bases with Phred quality score of =20) and reads containing primer/adaptor sequence. This resulted in a total of 106 660 317 (79%) high-quality sequence reads, including 50 523 492 (76.7%) PE sequence reads each 72 bp in length and 56 136 825 (81.3%) SE sequence reads each 51 bp in length (Table 1). After filtering, the average quality score increased significantly at each base position of the sequence reads (Supplementary Fig. S1). The average quality score was more than 30 at each base position in all the three data sets except for last seven bases at the 3' end in PE data set. The final data set comprising ~107million very high-quality reads was used for optimization of de novo assembly and analysis of chickpea transcriptome (Supplementary Fig. S2). Summary of data generated for chickpea transcriptomeSummary of data generated for chickpea transcriptome3.2. De novo assemblyThe de novo assembly of chickpea transcriptome was optimized after assessing the effect of various assembly parameters, trimming bases at sequence read ends and different assembly programs as described below.The untrimmed high-quality sequence reads were assembled using Velvet program at different k-mer length of 21, 27, 31, 37, 41, 47, 51 and 57. We analysed various output parameters like number of used reads, nodes, total number of contigs, contigs longer than 100 bp, N50 length, longest contig length and average contig length as a function of k-mer length (Supplementary Table S1A; Fig. 1). The results suggested that k-mer length affects inversely to the number of contigs. We found the best assembly to be that for k = 47, as it resulted in highest N50 length of 675 bp, largest contig length of 7827 bp and largest average contig length of 432 bp (Fig. 1A). The assembly resulted in a total of 74 651 contigs of at least 100 bp length. The total number of reads used for the assembly was also highest (73.6%) for k = 47 (Supplementary Table S1). We assessed the effect of other parameters such as insert length and expected coverage on Velvet assembly at different k-mer length and did not find any significant effect (data not shown). Comparison of de novo assembly of three data sets using Velvet program as a function of k-mer length. The three data sets include (A) untrimmed data set (72 bp PE and 51 bp SE reads), (B) trimmed data set 1 (70 bp PE and 50 bp SE reads) and (C) trimmed data set 2 (65 bp PE and 50 bp SE reads). The bars indicate number of contigs 100 bp or longer (left axis). The lines indicate N50 length (rectangles) and average contig length (triangles) in bp (right axis).Comparison of de novo assembly of three data sets using Velvet program as a function of k-mer length. The three data sets include (A) untrimmed data set (72 bp PE and 51 bp SE reads), (B) trimmed data set 1 (70 bp PE and 50 bp SE reads) and (C) trimmed data set 2 (65 bp PE and 50 bp SE reads). The bars indicate number of contigs 100 bp or longer (left axis). The lines indicate N50 length (rectangles) and average contig length (triangles) in bp (right axis).To improve the quality of assembly and observe the effect of trimming of low-quality bases at the end of reads, we generated two trimmed data sets; first data set containing 70 bp PE (2 bp trimmed from 3' end) and 50 bp SE (1 bp trimmed from 3' end) sequence reads and second data set containing 65 bp PE (7 bp trimmed from 3' end) and 50 bp SE (1 bp trimmed from 3' end) sequence reads. We then assembled both these data sets also with different k-mer length using Velvet and noted various output parameters (Supplementary Table S1B and C; Fig. 1B and C). For first trimmed data set, the best assembly was for k = 47 with improved highest N50 length of 683 bp, largest contig length of 7666 bp and average contig length of 437 bp. The total number of contigs generated with at least 100 bp in length was 71 217 using 75% of the total reads. For the second trimmed data set, although the largest contig length was highest for k = 41 (10 616 bp), N50 length of 730 bp and average contig length of 453 bp were better for k = 47. The total number of contigs generated with at least 100 bp in length was 63 365 at k = 47 using highest number of total reads (77.8%). Taken together, we considered the assembly results of second trimmed data set for k = 47 as the best. The results show that the trimming of low-quality bases at the sequence read ends improved the assembly significantly.It has been suggested that assembly of Velvet followed by Oases yields better contigs/transcripts. The Oases program has been developed specifically for the de novo assembly of transcriptomes using short reads, which takes the assembly generated by Velvet as input and exploits the read sequence and pairing information to produce transcript isoforms. We performed assembly of contigs generated by Velvet for the second trimmed data set (k = 47) into transcripts using Oases with default parameters. This resulted in a total number of 59 178 transcript isoforms (=100 bp in length). The number of reads used increased by 5% in Oases (82.8%) when compared with Velvet (77.8%). Among these, 4232 transcripts were represented by 10 001 transcript isoforms, which might represent alternative splicing events. From the 59 178 transcript isoforms obtained by Oases assembly, a set of 53 409 non-redundant transcripts (including only the largest transcript isoform) was obtained with N50 length of 900 bp, largest contig length of 8173 bp and average contig length of 523 bp (Fig. 2A). In addition, we also performed assembly of above three data sets (untrimmed data set, trimmed data set 1 and trimmed data set 2) using CLC Genomics workbench. We obtained the best assembly results with the second trimmed data set with a total number of 113 893 contigs (=100 bp in length) with N50 length of 1151 bp, largest contig length of 15 684 bp and average contig length of 428 bp (Supplementary Table S2; Fig. 2A). Although N50 length was better in CLC Genomics Workbench, the average contig length was lower than that of Oases and total number of contigs generated was also much higher than expected (Fig. 2A). Further, the assembly of second trimmed data set using ABySS (k = 47) and SOAPdenovo (k = 31) programs generated 48 185 and 124 160 contigs, respectively, of at least 100 bp length. The N50 and average lengths for contigs generated by ABySS were 1192 and 613 bp, respectively, and that of contigs generated by SOAPdenovo were 525 and 340 bp, respectively (Fig. 2A).

The bars indicate number of contigs 100 bp or longer (left axis). The lines indicate N50 length (rectangles) and average contig length (triangles) in bp (right axis). (B and C) Percentage of contigs generated using Velvet, Oases, CLC Genomics Workbench, ABySS and SOAPdenovo showing significant hits with Arabidopsis (B) and soybean (C) proteins at different E-value cut-offs.Further, the validation of assembly output was done by BLASTX search of contigs/transcripts generated by various programs against Arabidopsis and soybean annotated proteomes. The significant hits were identified at different E-value cut-offs. The largest number of transcripts generated by Oases assembly showed significant similarity with Arabidopsis and soybean proteins at all E-value cut-offs when compared with the contigs generated by Velvet, CLC Genomics Workbench, ABySS and SOAPdenovo programs (Fig. 2B and C). Although the contigs generated by ABySS showed higher N50 and average lengths, lesser number and percentage of contigs showed significant similarity with Arabidopsis and soybean proteins. Overall, taken together, the assembly of second trimmed short-read data set obtained by Oases was found better than others and this non-redundant transcript data set (53 409) was analysed further. The statistics of the final assembly obtained from Oases program are given in Table 2. The comparative analysis of all (32 747) the ESTs and ESTs reported in various individual transcriptome studies,6–8 available at NCBI [after removing/trimming contaminating vector sequences and short reads (<100 bp) using SeqClean] with the above non-redundant transcript data set of chickpea showed that most (79% of the total and 74–88% of the individual EST data set reported in previous studies) of the ESTs are represented in our data set showing =90% identity over a length of =100 bp.

GC content analysis of chickpea transcriptomeGC content (ratio of guanine and cytosine) of all the chickpea transcripts along with soybean (legume reference), Arabidopsis (dicot reference) and rice (monocot reference) was determined. The average GC content of chickpea transcripts (40.3%) and soybean unigenes (40.9%) was little lower than that of Arabidopsis (42.5%). The average GC content in rice was much higher (55%) as reported previously as well.22 Although the average GC contents of chickpea and Arabidopsis were comparable, chickpea has a higher proportion of transcripts with GC content in range of 35–40% but lower proportion of transcripts with high GC content in range of 40–45% (Fig. 3). In addition, the range of GC content was broader in chickpea and soybean when compared with Arabidopsis (Fig. 3). A similar observation was found for the unigene sets from other legume species as well (data not shown). GC content analysis of chickpea transcripts. The average GC content of each transcript for chickpea, soybean, Arabidopsis and rice was calculated and percentage of transcripts with GC content within a range are represented.GC content analysis of chickpea transcripts. The average GC content of each transcript for chickpea, soybean, Arabidopsis and rice was calculated and percentage of transcripts with GC content within a range are represented.3.4. Identification of SSRsThe transcript/EST-based markers are important resource for determining functional genetic variation.23 Among the various molecular markers, SSRs are highly polymorphic, easier to develop and serve as rich resource of diversity. For identification of SSRs, all the chickpea transcripts were searched with perl script MISA. We identified a total of 4816 SSRs in 4180 (7.8%) transcripts of chickpea with frequency of one SSR per 5.80 kb of the sequence (Table 3). The mono-nucleotide SSRs represented the largest fraction (41.9%) of SSRs identified followed by tri-nucleotide (36.1%) and di-nucleotide (19.3%) SSRs. Although only a small fraction of tetra- (50), penta- (22) and hexa-nucleotide (58) SSRs were identified in chickpea transcripts, the number is quite significant.

Sequence similarity of chickpea transcripts with other plantsThe transcript set of chickpea was analysed for similarity/sequence conservation against the unigene data sets of various legumes species namely soybean, Medicago, Lotus, Vigna and Pisum using TBLASTX search. An E-value cut-off threshold of =1E-05 was considered to define a significant hit. The largest number (72.4%) of chickpea transcripts showed significant similarity with soybean unigenes followed by Medicago (69.5%), Lotus (65.5%), Vigna (60.1%) and the least similarity with Pisum (39.3%; Fig. 4A). Overall, a total of 43 516 (81.5%) of the chickpea transcripts showed significant similarity with at least one of the other legume unigenes. Likewise, we analysed the sequence conservation of chickpea transcripts with proteomes of all sequenced plant species. A total of 42 012 (79%) transcripts exhibited significant similarity with at least one of the predicted protein from sequenced plants. The largest number (75%) of chickpea transcripts showed significant similarity with soybean followed by Medicago (69%) and least with Physcomitrella (50%; Fig. 4B). As expected, lesser number of chickpea transcripts showed significant similarity with monocots (52–61%) when compared with dicots (65–75%). Although a large number of the chickpea transcripts showed significant similarity with predicted proteins from legumes, the extent of coverage of the coding region was quite less than expected. Only 28.4 and 29.5% of the transcripts which showed significant similarity covered =50% of the coding region of the predicted proteins from soybean and Medicago, respectively. Considering a high degree of conservation among legumes, it may be assumed that the assembly of chickpea transcriptome may further be improved as more sequence data become available.

(B) Sequence conservation of chickpea transcripts with annotated proteins of completely sequenced plant species. The percentage of transcripts showing significant similarity (E-value = 1E-05) in TBLASTX (A) and BLASTX (B) searches are shown.Further, the combined analysis of BLAST results with legume unigenes and plant proteomes revealed that a total of 45 636 (85.5%) transcripts were conserved in chickpea showing significant similarity with at least one sequence. Among these, 3624 (6.8%) transcripts were conserved only in legumes representing legume-specific genes. However, 7773 (14.5%) transcripts did not show significant similarity with any of the data set analysed, and may represent chickpea-specific genes.3.6. Functional annotation and characterization of chickpea transcriptsTo identify the putative function of chickpea transcripts, they were compared against the non-redundant protein sequences available at UniProt database and Arabidopsis proteins using BLASTX search. A total of 23 864 (44.7%) and 34 993 (65.5%) chickpea transcripts showed significant hit with UniProt and Arabidopsis proteins, respectively. Together, 35 279 (66.1%) transcripts showed significant hit with at least one UniProt or Arabidopsis protein. Broadly, the putative orthologs of genes involved in various pathways and cellular processes were found to be conserved in chickpea. In addition, many chickpea transcripts showed homology to uncharacterized proteins annotated as unknown, hypothetical and expressed proteins as well. Further, GO terms were assigned to chickpea transcripts, which showed significant similarity with Arabidopsis proteins annotated with GO terms. A total of 34 676 (64.9%) transcripts were assigned at least one GO term, among which 31 250 were assigned at least one GO term in biological process category, 31 598 in molecular function category and 30 264 in cellular component category. Among the various biological processes, ignoring unknown and other biological process categories, protein metabolism (19.5%) and developmental processes (15.6%) were most highly represented (Fig. 5). The genes involved in other important biological processes such as response to abiotic and biotic stimulus/stress, transport, transcription and signal transduction, were also identified through GO annotations. Similarly, transferase activity and hydrolase activity were most represented among the various molecular functions, and chloroplast and plasma membrane were most represented among the cellular component categories (Fig. 5). Further, we identified transcription factor encoding transcripts by sequence comparison to known transcription factor gene families. In total, 6577 putative chickpea transcription factor genes, distributed in at least 57 families, were identified representing 12.3% of chickpea transcripts (Fig. 6). The overall distribution of transcription factor encoding transcripts among the various known protein families is very similar with that of soybean and other legumes as predicted earlier.24,25 However, a few families showed the events of expansion (for example, Aux/IAA-ARF, bHLH, C3H, MADS, NAC, PHD and RWP-RK etc.) and contraction (for example, C2C2 zinc finger, CCAAT, LIM and MYB etc.) indicating their evolutionary significance (Supplementary Table S3). In fact, the number of predicted transcription factor encoding genes in Medicago and Lotus are very less when compared with soybean.24,25 As the complete genome sequence is available only for soybean as of now, the complete picture about evolution of various transcription factor families will emerge once the complete genome sequences and analyses thereof will be available for other legume species too.

Quantification of chickpea transcriptsThe digital expression profiling, also called RNA-Seq, is a powerful and efficient approach for gene expression analysis.26,27 The mapping of all the reads onto the non-redundant set of chickpea transcripts revealed that the number of reads corresponding to each transcript ranged from 14 (0.16 rpm) to 270 894 (3,137.3 rpm) with an average of 1617 reads (18.7 rpm) per transcript, indicating a very wide range of expression levels of chickpea transcripts (Supplementary Table S4). It also indicates that very low expressed chickpea transcripts are also represented in our assembly. The minimum coverage (rpkm) of a chickpea transcript was 1.2 and maximum of 9015.1 with an average of 25.7 (Table 2). Further, we analysed the expression of chickpea transcripts in root, shoot and pooled (root, shoot, mature leaf and flower bud) tissue samples. The mapping of reads on the chickpea transcript data set revealed that a total of 1974 and 1174 transcripts are not represented in the root and shoot tissue sequence data sets, respectively. Among these, 420 transcripts have no read mapped from root and shoot data sets, indicating their expression in mature leaf and/or flower buds (Supplementary Table S4). Further, another 250 transcripts were found to have root-specific expression, as they have no read mapped from shoot data set and at least 3 rpm mapped from root data set (Supplementary Table S4). Likewise, another 217 transcripts were found to have shoot-specific expression, as they have no read mapped from root data set and at least 3 rpm mapped from shoot data set (Supplementary Table S4). However, their expression in other chickpea tissues not analysed in this study is not ruled out.4. DiscussionThe transcriptome sequencing enables various functional genomic studies for an organism. Although several high throughput technologies have been developed for rapid sequencing and characterization of transcriptomes, expressed sequence data are still not available for many organisms, including crop plants. The next generation sequencing technologies provide a low cost, labour saving and rapid means of transcriptome sequencing and characterization.14 Similar to sequencing technologies, many bioinformatics tools have also been developed for the short-read sequence data assembly and analysis,17,18 but the requisite knowledge is very limited. The de novo assembly of short reads without a known reference is considered difficult.28 Therefore, the use of more expensive 454 Life Sciences (Roche) technology is used for non-model organisms, which produces longer sequence reads.15 However, the de novo assembly of transcriptomes using short reads has also received attention.20,29 In this study, we demonstrate a strategy for de novo assembly of transcriptome using short reads for a non-model crop plant, chickpea, for which sequence data is very limited so far in the public databases. We showed that there is significant effect of the assembly program parameters and sequence quality on the assembly output. A larger N50 length and average length are considered indicative of better assembly. Our results show that N50 length of the contigs generated using Velvet assembly program varied greatly as a function of k-mer length and increased from 675 bp for untrimmed data set to 730 bp after trimming low-quality bases. Hence, we suggest that the optimization of program parameters and trimming of low-quality bases at the ends of sequence reads might improve the assembly output significantly. In addition, the validation of different assembly programs is also required to get the optimum results. We found the assembly of Velvet followed by Oases program better than that of Velvet alone, CLC Genomics Workbench, ABySS and SOAPdenovo programs based on various assessment parameters such as N50 length, average contig length and sequence similarity with closely related species.Chickpea is one of the most important legume crop plants rich in proteins, carbohydrates and other nutrients, which makes it very important target for genomic studies.1,2 For the model legumes such as soybean, Medicago and Lotus, genome sequencing has been nearly completed and a vast collection of ESTs are available for functional genomic studies.25,30–32 However, very few genomic resources, including genome sequence, EST sequences and molecular markers are available for chickpea so far when compared with other legumes. We have generated more than 100million sequence reads for chickpea and report a non-redundant set of 53 409 transcripts representing about 28 Mb sequence and 3.8% of the chickpea genome. The coverage of chickpea transcripts was quite high (average of 25.7 rpkm), which is very crucial for quality and length of transcripts obtained. The GC content analysis revealed that chickpea transcripts have a low GC content similar to other dicots. However, the GC content range was broader when compared with other dicots which cover a narrow GC range.33 The GC content analysis provide insights into various aspects related to genome of an organism, including evolution, gene structure (intron size and number), thermostability and gene regulation.22,34,35 We identified a large number of SSRs in the chickpea transcripts. The number of tri-nucleotide SSRs was much higher than di-nucleotide SSRs. Earlier studies have also reported the higher number of tri-nucleotide SSRs when compared with di-nucleotide SSRs in ESTs than genomic sequences.23,36 However, recently the larger number of di-nucleotide SSRs than tri-nucleotide SSRs has been reported in pigeonpea ESTs.37 The frequency and distribution of SSRs have been proposed to be dependent on various factors such as size of data set, tools and criteria used.23 The identification of SSRs provides a very cost-effective option to develop functional markers for various marker-assisted breeding purposes.The analysis of sequence conservation helps in transfer of knowledge from model plants to chickpea for functional genomic studies. A large number (60–72%) of chickpea transcripts showed significant similarity with legumes at protein level as expected except for Pisum, indicating that their function might also be conserved. The low similarity with Pisum unigenes may be due to the availability of lesser number of sequences. The low similarity of chickpea transcripts with monocot proteomes when compared with dicot proteomes is also not unexpected due to the phylogenetic divergence of monocots and dicots during evolution. A significant number of transcripts were found to be conserved only in legumes, which may perform legume-specific functions. Interestingly, about 15% of the transcripts did not show significant homology with any other sequences, which may be novel and perform species-specific functions. The lineage- and species-specific genes have been identified in other plant species, including legumes as well.38–40 The study of these genes will be very important to dissect the lineage- or species-specific cellular processes and study evolutionary processes such as speciation and adaptation. Further, the chickpea transcripts were found to belong to various functional categories conserved in other plants also. However, overrepresentation of few functional categories might provide a clue towards specific functions/pathways operative in legumes or chickpea. Likewise, the conservation of transcription factor families indicates the presence of conserved gene regulatory machinery in chickpea. However, the lineage- and/or species-specific evolutionary expansion and contraction along with unique gene expression patterns of some of transcription factors may contribute to the legume-specific traits.In conclusion, we have demonstrated the use of short-read sequence data to rapidly characterize a draft transcriptome of an organism. The strategy of de novo assembly described here can be potentially used for any species. In addition, our study contributes a significant non-redundant set of 53 409 transcripts in chickpea. The detailed analyses of the data set has provided several important features of chickpea transcriptome such as GC content, conserved genes across legumes and other plant species, assignment of functional categories and identification of SSRs. It is anticipated that this study is a significant contribution towards development of genomic resources for chickpea and will accelerate functional genomic studies and breeding programmes.Supplementary DataSupplementary Data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis study was supported financially by the Department of Biotechnology, Government of India, New Delhi, under the Next Generation Challenge Programme on Chickpea Genomics.Supplementary data"

IntroductionTo reconcile increasing energy consumption with worsening global environmental conditions is a fundamental concern of the contemporary society. Fossil fuel deposits are rapidly diminishing, and their consumption raises carbon dioxide discharge levels. Alternative fuels, such as bioethanol and biodiesel, show great promise for alleviating the problems caused by the consumption of fossil fuel.Jatropha curcas L. is a plant belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae that is endemic to tropical America. It is now grown commercially in tropical and subtropical Africa and Asia. Jatropha has considerable potential for various uses including biofuels.1 The plant can grow at rainfall levels as low as 200 mm per annum.2 Medicinal compounds are found in various parts of the plant,1 but it is the potentially high yield of oil per unit land area, which is second only to oil palm,3 that makes Jatropha an outstanding biofuel plant. Furthermore, the quality of oil in its seeds is suitable for production of biodiesel as they contain more than 75% unsaturated fatty acids.4 Despite its cultivation throughout the tropical and subtropical world, the positive attributes of this plant are not fully understood in terms of breeding and utilization.3 This can be attributed mainly to the lack of information on its genetics and genomics. The genome size (~410 Mb) and the base composition have been estimated by flow cytometry, and karyotypes have been characterized.5 Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from developing and germinating Jatropha seeds have been reported.6 However, no further information on the genomic structure of J. curcas is available.To understand the genetic system of this plant and to accelerate the process of molecular breeding, we analysed the structure of the whole genome of J. curcas. For genome sequencing, we adopted a combination of BAC end sequencing and shotgun sequencing by the conventional Sanger method and the new-generation multiplex methods, which was followed by information analyses. In addition, microsatellite markers have been developed using the sequence information, and polymorphism among various J. curcas varieties was examined. The information and material resources for the Jatropha genome generated in this study will enhance both fundamental and applied research with J. curcas and related plants.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materialsA J. curcas line originating from the Palawan Island in the Philippines was subjected to genome sequencing. The following 12 lines were used for diversity analysis: Palawan, Indonesia, Indonesia IS, Thai, Chinese, Mexico 2b, Guatemala 1, Guatemala 2, Tanzania, Madagascar, Cape Verde, and Uganda. The Indonesia IS and Thai lines were purchased from IS Co. Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan) and Nikko-Seed Co. Ltd. (Tochigi, Japan), respectively. The Uganda and the remaining nine lines were kindly provided by BBL International (Osaka, Japan) and Nippon Biodiesel Fuel Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan), respectively.2.2. Construction of BAC librariesBAC genomic libraries were constructed using the genomic DNA of J. curcas partially digested with either MboI or HindIII and Copy Control pCC1BAC as a cloning vector. The average insert size of these libraries was 80.2 kb for the MboI library and 94.9 and 63.4 kb for two independent preparations of the HindIII libraries. Both libraries covered the haploid genome 9.2 times in total.2.3. BAC sequencingTo analyse end sequences, BAC DNAs were amplified using a TempliPhi large construction kit (GE Healthcare, UK), and the end sequences were analysed according to the Sanger method using a cycle sequencing kit (Big Dye-terminator kit, Applied Biosystems, USA) with DNA sequencer type 3730xl (Applied Biosystems). High-quality BAC sequences were determined by the shotgun method using the Sanger sequencing protocol, as described previously.72.4. Shotgun genomic sequencingFor sequencing by the Sanger method, shotgun libraries with average insert sizes of 2.5 kb were generated using pBluescript SK- as a cloning vector, and these were used to transform Escherichia coli ElectroTen-Blue (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The shotgun clones were propagated in microtiter plates, and the plasmid DNA was amplified using a TempliPhi kit (GE Healthcare). Sequencing was performed using a cycle sequencing kit (Big Dye-terminator Cycle Sequencing kit, Applied Biosystems) with DNA sequencer type 3730xl (Applied Biosystems) or DeNOVA-5000HT (Shimadzu Co., Japan) according to the protocols recommended by the manufacturers.High-throughput multiplex sequencing was carried out using a Genome Sequencer (GS) FLX Instrument (Roche Diagnostics, USA) and Genome Analyzer II (Illumina Inc., USA) sequencers. A 5-µg sample of Jatropha total cellular DNA was sheared by nebulization and subjected to library preparation followed by shotgun sequencing using the GS FLX platform. For the 3-kb paired-end sequencing, the library was prepared using GS Titanium Library Paired End Adaptors according to the manufacturer's instructions. For sequencing by an Illumina-solexa GAII sequencer, the sample was prepared according to the manufacturer's manual. Briefly, 1 µg of the total cellular genomic DNA was fragmented by the Covaris S1 instrument (Covaris Inc.). The fragmented DNA was repaired, and the adapters for paired-end sequencing (36, 51, and 76 cycles) were then ligated to the repaired DNA fragment. The size-selected fragment (300–350 bp) by agarose gel electrophoresis was PCR amplified, and the PCR product was validated using a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) and a 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR system (ABI). The sample was then run on a Genome Analyzer II using the 36 cycles sequencing kits. Base-calling was performed using the Genome Analyzer Pipeline.2.5. cDNA sequencingTotal RNA was extracted from leaf and callus tissue using an RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany). mRNA was purified from the total RNA using Oligotex-dT30 (Takara Bio Inc., Japan). Sequencing was performed with a GS FLX Instrument (Roche Diagnostics) using the cDNA rapid library method according to the manufacturer's instructions.2.6. Assembly of sequence dataReconstruction of the genome sequence of J. curcas was performed in the following two steps: assembly of sequence data generated by different types of DNA sequencers, and scaffolding and base correction.The sequence data collected according to the Sanger protocol using a 3730xl capillary sequencer were subjected to trimming of sequences derived from cloning vectors with the Figaro and Lucy programs,8 followed by assembly with the PCAP.rep program.9 Base-calling of the sequence data generated by pyrosequencing using a GS FLX sequencer was performed using the Pyrobayes program.10 The sequence reads artificially replicated during an emulsion PCR were removed by a 454 replicate filter,11 and the remaining reads were assembled using MIRA version 3 rc4 software.12 Contigs and singlets generated by assembly using the Sanger protocol and pyrosequencing were separately subjected to similarity searches for sequences of the chloroplast (GenBank: FJ695500) of J. curcas and the mitochondria (GenBank: Y08501) of Arabidopsis thaliana13 using the Megablast program.14 Matching sequences were then removed. All remaining contigs and singlets were assembled using the PCAP.rep program.9 BAC end sequences in which the vector sequences were trimmed by Figaro and Lucy programs8 in advance were further integrated in the resulting sequences using PCAP.rep.9 Then, sequences 99 bp and shorter were removed.The resulting contigs and singlets were designated as follows. The contigs containing sequences from the Sanger sequencing, pyrosequencing, and BAC end sequencing were prefixed with ‘JcCA’ followed by a seven-digit number. The contigs containing sequences from both the Sanger and 454 sequencing were prefixed with ‘JcCB’ followed by a seven-digit number. The contigs containing sequences from the Sanger sequencing and the pyrosequencing were prefixed with ‘JcCC’ and ‘JcCD', respectively. The singlets from the Sanger sequencing and pyrosequencing that were not assembled into other sequences throughout the whole process were prefixed with ‘JcSR’ and ‘JcPR', respectively.For improvement of data quality, both single and mate-pair reads by an Illumina GAII sequencer were collected and assembled using the Velvet program.15 The resulting contig sequences were mapped onto the contigs generated by hybrid assembly to correct the short insertion–deletion (indels) errors.Both paired-end reads of the genomic DNA and single reads of cDNAs by the GS FLX sequencer were used for scaffolding. Paired-end reads of the genomic DNA were assembled with the MIRA program12 according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the resulting sequences were used for scaffolding of the contig sequences generated by the Sanger sequencing and pyrosequencing using the GS reference mapper ver. 2.3 program. In parallel, a mixture of cDNAs derived from leaf and callus tissue of Jatropha was subjected to sequencing by GS FLX, and the data obtained were subjected to assembly with the MIRA ver. 3.0.5 program in the EST mode.12 In addition, the resulting cDNA sequences as well as the Jatropha ESTs retrieved from public DNA databases were used for scaffolding using the Blat program.162.7. Gene assignmentGene prediction and modelling were performed by automatic gene assignment programs that employ ab initio gene finding and similarity searches. For ab initio gene finding, predictions of protein-coding regions were carried out using GeneMark.hmm17 and Genescan18 programs with the matrix trained by an A. thaliana gene set, and predictions of exon–intron structure were performed using NetGene219 and SplicePredictor20 programs. Similarity searches for potential protein-coding regions and all contigs were performed against a Uniref database (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/uniref/) using Blastp and Blastx programs21 with a cut-off (E-value = 1e-3). The exon–intron structure of potential protein-coding regions and the contigs homologous to the Uniref database (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/uniref/) were predicted using the Nap program.22 Suitable exon-intron structures were determined by considering all the information above. The predicted gene structures were further confirmed by comparison to cDNA sequences analysed in this study. The protein-coding genes assigned in this manner were denoted by IDs with the contig names followed by sequential numbers from one end to another. They were classified into four categories based on sequence similarity to registered genes: genes with complete structure, pseudogenes, genes with partial structure, and transposons/retrotranspons.2.8. Functional assignment and classification of potential protein-coding genesTo assign the gene families, functional domains, GO terms, and GO accession numbers,23 the predicted genes were searched against InterPro using InterProScan24 software. Genes with an E-value of <1.0 were taken into account. GO terms were grouped into plant GO slim categories using the map2slim program (http://www.geneontology.org/GO.slims.shtml).The predicted protein-encoding genes were mapped onto KEGG metabolic pathways25 using the Blastp program21 against the GENES database.25 Thresholds of amino acid sequence identity =25% and of length coverage of the query sequence =50% with a cut-off (E-value = 1e-10) were applied.2.9. Phylogenetic analysisEvolutionary relationships of proteins of casben synthase genes, disease resistance genes, MADS-box genes, flowering genes, and COL genes were analysed using predicted amino acid sequences from different databases aligned with the program CLUSTALW (Ver. 1.83).26 Evolutionary relationships were inferred using a neighbour-joining algorithm.27 All positions containing alignment gaps and missing data were eliminated only in pairwise sequence comparisons. Phylogenetic trees were constructed with MEGA4 software.282.10. Polymorphism analysisMicrosatellite or simple sequence repeats (SSRs) 15 nucleotides in length, containing all possible combinations of di-nucleotide (NN), tri-nucleotide (NNN) and tetra-nucleotide (NNNN) repeat, were identified from the Jatropha genome sequences using the SSRIT (SSR Identification Tool) program.29 Primer pairs for amplification of SSR-containing regions were designed based on the flanking sequences of each SSR with the Primer 3 program30 so that amplified fragment sizes were between 90 and 300 bp in length. One hundred microsatellite markers were subjected to examination of polymorphisms among 12 lines of J. curcas.3. Results and discussion3.1. Sequence analysis of the Jatropha genomeThe strategy and the status of sequencing and assembly are summarized in Fig. 1. Briefly, the 1 025 000 reads of the Sanger sequencing and the 2 312 828 reads of pyrosequencing, which were appropriately processed in advance as indicated in Fig. 1, were independently assembled using the PCAP.rep9 and MIRA programs,12 respectively. The resulting contigs and singlets were subjected to hybrid assembly by PCAP.rep,9 and the 53 000 BAC end sequences were further integrated. The strategy and status of sequencing and assembly.The strategy and status of sequencing and assembly.For improvement of data quality, 86 028 428 (36 bases long from each end for each read) and 96 580 336 short-reads (50 and 31 bases long from each end for each read) by mate-pair sequencing with the Illumina GAII sequencer were assembled into 569 576 contigs (total length: 75 539 079 bp) by the Velvet program.15 The resulting contig sequences were mapped onto those generated by hybrid assembly to correct short indels errors. These indels were probably attributed to classified insertions, deletions, and mismatches by their association with miscall from homopolymer effects. As a result of mapping, 7459 loci on the 5025 contigs were revised.A total of 695 928 3-kb paired-end reads by the GS FLX sequencer were used for scaffolding of the generated contigs and singlets using the GS reference mapper ver. 2.3 program, as described in the ‘Materials and Methods’ section. In parallel, 991 050 reads of cDNA sequences by pyrosequencing were collected; 534 137 were derived from leaf tissue and 456 913 from callus tissue. The cDNA sequences were assembled with MIRA 3.05 in the EST mode,12 and 21 225 unigene sets were generated consisting of 13 610 contigs and 7615 singlets used for scaffolding by the BLAT program.16 In addition, unigenes generated from 26 447 ESTs registered in public DNA databases (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbEST/) were also used for scaffolding. As a result of scaffolding, the 44 153 contigs and singlets constructed by hybrid assembly were integrated into 15 300 scaffolds. The total length of the scaffolds was 129 291 074 bp. The longest scaffold (JcS_100001) had 56 042 bp, and the average scaffold length was 8450 bp. The constructed scaffolds were designated as JcS followed by sequential numbers.The total length of the final genomic sequences of J. curcas obtained was 285 858 490 bp, consisting of 120 586 contigs (276 710 623 bp total) and 29 831 singlets (9 147 867 bp total), which is ~70 and 75% of the whole genome of 4105 and 380 Mb (N. Wada, unpublished result), respectively, estimated by flow cytometry. The average length of contigs and singlets was 1900 bp. Statistics of the assembly are summarized in Table 1. The longest contig was 29 744 bp, and N50 length was 3833 bp. The distribution of contig lengths is shown in the Supplementary Fig. S1. The average G + C content of the contigs was 34.3%. Assembly statisticsAssembly statisticsCoverage of gene space in the Jatropha genomic sequences was estimated roughly by surveying the matched non-redundant cDNA sequences obtained in this study. Of 21 225 non-redundant cDNA sequences and 26 447 EST sequences in the public databases, 45 029 matched Jatropha genomic sequences with an identity of 95% or more for a stretch of 50 nucleotides, suggesting that 95% of the gene space in the Jatropha genome was covered by the genomic sequences in this study.We adopted here the sequencing strategy that combines the conventional Sanger method and the new-generation multiplex sequencing methods with the aid of various computer software for assembly. This strategy is superior in that shortcomings of respective methods are compensated by each other, enabling acquisition of sequences of higher quality in lower cost within a shorter period of time, thus is becoming popular for genome sequencing in both bacteria and eukaryotes.3.2. Characteristic features of the genomeA total of 41 428 di-, tri-, and tetra-nucleotide SSRs =15 bp were identified in the Jatropha genomic sequences (Supplementary Table S1). The frequency of the occurrence of these SSRs was estimated to be one SSR in every 7.0 kb in the 289 Mb sequences of the Jatropha genome. The di-, tri-, and tetra-nucleotide SSRs accounted for 46.3, 34.3, and 19.4% of the identified SSRs, respectively (Supplementary Table S1). The SSR patterns that appeared frequently were (AT)n, (AAT)n, and (AAAT)n, each representing 71% of di-nucleotide, 60% of tri-nucleotide, and 58% of tetra-nucleotide repeat units, respectively. The tri-nucleotide SSRs, particularly (AAG)n and (AGC)n, were preferentially found in exons. (AT)n, (AG)n, and (AAT)n were enriched in 5' and 3' untranslated regions, and (AC)n frequently occurred in introns (Supplementary Table S1).A search of the Jatropha genomic sequences using the repeat sequence finding program RECON31 unravelled the occurrence of a variety of repeat elements including class I and class II transposable element (TE) subfamilies and some that were difficult to classify into known subfamilies. Composition of these repeat sequences was analysed with the RepeatMasker program (http://repeatmasker.org/); the results are summarized in Table 2. The identified repetitive sequences in total occupied 36.6% of the Jatropha genomic sequences. The most abundant repeat category was class I TE (29.9%), in which Gypsy type (19.6%) and Copia type (8.0%) LTR retroelements constituted major components. Repetitive sequences in the Jatropha genomic sequencesRepetitive sequences in the Jatropha genomic sequencesA combination of computer prediction and similarity searches of the structural RNA sequence library resulted in identification of 597 putative genes for transfer RNAs in the Jatropha genomic sequences. Although 80 of these were likely to be pseudogenes, the remaining 517 could code for intact tRNAs with 54 species of anticodons (Supplementary Table S2). This is sufficient for translation of all the amino acids based on the universal codon table.A total of 65 genes for snRNAs were assigned by referring to the list of A. thaliana snRNAs (Supplementary Table S3).32 Some of these genes were found on the same contigs and scaffolds; thus, they are likely to form clusters in the genome, as they do in A. thaliana.3.3. Characteristic features of protein-encoding genesThe Jatropha genomic sequences were subjected to an automatic assignment of protein-encoding genes, and a total of 40 929 genes, besides 16 447 transposon-related genes, were assigned. Complete structures were predicted for 9870 genes, but only partial structures were predicted for 17 863 genes. In addition, 1960 and 11 236 genes were likely to be pseudogenes with complete and truncated structures, respectively. Of the 40 929 presumptive protein-encoding genes, 15 573 (38.0%) carried ESTs with sequence identity of 95% or more for a stretch of 50 nucleotides.Structural features of the protein-encoding genes in J. curcas were investigated in detail for 146 genes predicted on the 17 BAC clones (1.36 Mb in total) for which high-quality sequences were obtained by manual finishing and annotation (Supplementary Table S4). As shown in Supplementary Table S5, the basic structures of the protein-encoding genes in J. curcas are similar to those of A. thaliana except for the average lengths of genes and introns: 3064 versus 1918 bp and 356 versus 157 bp in J. curcas and A. thaliana, respectively.A similarity search of translated amino acid sequences of the 40 929 presumptive protein-encoding genes was performed using the TrEMBL database as a protein sequence library.33 The results indicated that 31 822 (77.7%) genes had significant (E-value = 1e-20) sequence similarity to those in this database. Of these genes, 13 067 (41.0%) genes showed sequence similarities to those in a public EST database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbEST/) with a cut-off (E-value = 1e-20) using tBLASTN.The 40 929 presumptive protein-encoding genes assigned in J. curcas and those in castor bean (Ricinus communis; 31 221 genes),34 which belongs to the same family as Jatropha, and A. thaliana (32 615 genes), were classified into plant GO slim categories35 for comparison (Fig. 2). The percentage of the number of genes classified into each GO slim category (i.e. ‘biological process’, ‘cellular component', and ‘molecular function’) was calculated for J. curcas, R. communis, and A. thaliana (Fig. 2). GO category classification. The percentages of number of genes classified into each GO slim category in J. curcas, R. communis, and A. thaliana are, respectively, shown in blue, red, and yellow bars.

(A) GO terms; (B) biological process; (C) cellular component; and (D) molecular function.Of 40 929 presumptive genes in the Jatropha genomic sequences, 2213 genes could be mapped onto 134 of the 155 metabolic pathways in the KEGG database,25 whereas the 2975 and 4115 genes of R. communis and A. thaliana were mapped onto 140 and 135 pathways, respectively. Twenty-nine pathways, including ‘fatty acid metabolism’ in lipid metabolism, ‘methionine metabolism’ and ‘lysine degradation’ in amino acid metabolism, and ‘benzoate degradation via hydroxylation’ in xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism, contained enzyme(s) on which the genes in the Jatropha genome were solely mapped (Supplementary Table S6).3.4. Characteristic features of the genes in J. curcasJatropha curcas is expected to contribute to biodiesel production through its ability to biosynthesize and accumulate considerable amounts of triacylglycerols (TAGs) in seeds. For this reason, the genes involved in TAG biosynthesis are of great interest and some of those genes have already been cloned from J. curcas.36,37 Recently, the collection of ESTs from developing and germinating Jatropha seeds has been reported.6 We manually annotated and summarized the gene models for fatty acid and TAG biosynthesis that were predicted in this work, together with related data that have been deposited to GenBank (Supplementary Table S7). The Jatropha genome appears to contain basically one gene for each enzyme isoform, and no obvious gene duplication particular to this plant was identified in this category. One gene model for a recently identified soluble type of DGAT38 also existed in the Jatropha genome. To improve Jatropha oil quality for biodiesel, its fatty acid composition could be changed by altering the expression of some of the genes listed in Supplementary Table S7.Jatropha curcas is known to produce tumour-promoting phorbol esters.39 Accordingly, depression of the phorbol ester biosynthetic gene in high oil content lines would be a step towards safe utilization of this plant. To our knowledge, genes involved in biosynthesis of phorbol esters have not been reported in J. curcas, with the exception of the gene for geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (GGPPS).40 In the current study, we searched genes for GGPPS, casbene synthase (CS), terpene hydroxylase (cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenase), and acyltransferase in the Jatropha genome with the tBLASTN program21 using the corresponding amino acid sequences in diterpene-producing plants as queries (Supplementary Table S8).One (JcCS1), two (JcCS2 and JcCS3), and six (JcCS4–JcCS9) homologues of a gene for CS in R. communis were identified in the BAC clones, JHL23C09, JHL22C18, and JHL17M24, respectively. JcCS2 is a pseudogene because there are several stop codons in the putative open reading frame (ORF). Interestingly, JcCS4–JcCS9 are tandemly aligned and are likely to be active because their ORFs seem to be intact. The phylogenetic tree demonstrates that JcCS4–JcCS9 forms a cluster, suggesting that continuous duplication of the original JcCS gene occurred recently (Supplementary Fig. S2 and Supplementary Table S9). There are 40 genes for terpenoid synthase (AtTPS) in A. thaliana that are most closely related to JcCS phylogenetically.41 They form clusters consisting of two or three tandem repeats at six loci in the genome. The clustered organization of JcCS may be an implication of the evolutionary process of genes related to the synthesis of terpenoid natural products.Curcin is a Type I ribosome-inactivating protein (RIP) common among the members of the Euphobiaceae family. Curcin in J. curcas is analogous to ricin, a Type II RIP, in R. communis, although the toxicity of curcin is significantly lower than that of ricin.42 Research on curcin has been extensive,42 and it has revealed antitumour activity.43,44 The activity of a curcin protein isoform against viral and fungal diseases has been proven by heterologous expression in tobacco; the expression of this curcin gene was induced by abiotic and biotic stresses in leaves.45–47 So far, Jatropha genes encoding three isoforms of curcin have been reported and deposited in public DNA databases. In our Jatropha genome sequence, only three contigs were identified to encode amino acid sequences highly similar to those coding for curcin, confirming that the Jatropha genome contains three curcin genes. However, there are four more contigs with presumptive genes predicted to encode curcin-like proteins with E-values from 1e-117 to 1e-91, as listed in Supplementary Table S10, suggesting that at least two more curcin isoforms are encoded in the Jatropha genome because these four additional genes make two pairs with highly similar counterparts. Data from proteomic analysis of developing seeds that is briefly mentioned in Costa et al.6 appear to support this observation as they identified five isoforms of curcin.In response to pathogens, plants have evolved disease resistance (R) genes. Most of them are NBS-LRR (nucleotide-binding site and leucine-rich repeat) proteins, which are classified into two groups on the basis of the presence of Toll and human interleukin receptors (TIR) at their amino termini.48 We identified 42 TIR NBS-LRR proteins and 50 non-TIR NBS-LRR proteins. We analysed five BAC clones (JHL06P13, JHS03A10, JHL25H03, JHL25P11, and JMS10C05) including R genes to reveal their gene structure (Supplementary Table S4). Two BAC clones (JHS03A10 and JMS10C05) include singletons of JcTIR-NBS-LRR1 and JcNBS-LRR9, whereas three clones (JHL06P13, JHL25H03, and JHL25P11) contain gene clusters as tandem repeats of R genes, JcNBS-LRR1 and JcNBS-LRR2, JcNBS-LRR3–5, or JcNBS-LRR6–8. JcNBS-LRR8 is a pseudogene with a stop codon in the ORF. The phylogenetic tree of R genes including eight R genes in J. curcas demonstrated that JcNBS-LRR3–5 or JcNBS-LRR6 and JcNBS-LRR7 are closely related, suggesting that these gene clusters evolved recently by the way of gene duplication (Supplementary Fig. S3 and Supplementary Table S11). Interestingly, JcNBS-LRR1 and JcNBS-LRR2 belong to different clades. This relationship indicates that gene duplication was not recent and that these gene segments were conserved after evolutionary diversification of J. curcas.MADS-box genes, typical homeotic genes coding for transcription factors, form a family and are involved in several aspects of plant development.49 Many plant species are known to harbour multiple MADS-box genes that belong to a range of functionally divergent subfamilies.50 We searched for MIKC type II MADS-box genes in the genome of J. curcas using amino acid sequences of PI in A. thaliana as a query. A total of 28 potential MADS-box genes (JcMADS01–JcMADS28) were identified (Supplementary Table S12). The phylogenetic analysis classified these genes into several subfamilies (Supplementary Fig. S4).SVP controls flowering time by negatively regulating the expression of a floral integrator, FLOWERING LOCUS T in response to ambient temperature changes in A. thaliana.51 Interestingly, there are five paralogs of SVP in Jatropha, yet only a single copy and three copies were identified in A. thaliana and Oryza sativa, respectively.52,53 Eight paralogs of SVP copies have been found in 57 MIKC type II MADS-box genes of Populus trichocarta,54 suggesting amplification and functional diversification of the SVP gene in woody plants.Flowering in J. curcas is closely related to the production of seeds. Jatropha curcas is a monoecious species, which forms unisexual flowers, male and female flowers, separately in an individual plant. The unisexual flowers are produced on the same inflorescence, with the ratio of male flowers to female flowers ranging from 10:1 to 30:1.55 The male bias ratio within an inflorescence limits seed production because more female flowers mean more fruits. Accordingly, modification of floral identity genes involved in organ identity could change the number or size of male and female organs or flowers.In the Jatropha genomic sequences, we identified eight orthologs of flowering-related genes including five flowering regulators, CONSTANS, FLOWERING LOCUS D, FLOWERING LOCUS F, LEAFY, and SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1, designated as JcCO, JcFD, JcFT, JcLFY, and JcSOC1, respectively, and three floral identity genes, APETALA2, APETALA3, and PISTILLATA, designated as JcAP2, JcAP3-1, and JcPI, respectively (Supplementary Table S13). Phylogenetic analysis indicated that all Jatropha flowering-related genes except JcCO are closely related to those of woody plants, including Betula pendula, Hevea brasiliensis, R. communis, and Vitis vinifera (Supplementary Fig. S5 and Supplementary Table S14). JcCO belonged to evolutionary lineages that differ from its homologues in monocot and dicot species. Further phylogenetic analysis indicated that JcCO is not related to any flowering-related genes including CO paralogs, a rice CO orthologue Hd1 and light-signalling genes of AtCOLs, which are CO-like genes in A. thaliana (Supplementary Fig. S6 and Supplementary Table S15). This finding suggests that JcCO is not directly involved in flowering regulation, although JcCO has all CO-conservative domains as a transcription factor including B-box and CCT motif. There were other CO homologues in the Jatropha genome; for example, JcCOL2 in JcCB0217351.10 and JcCOL9 in JcCA0317951.10, which suggests that different components participate in the response to light in J. curcas.3.5. Comparative analysisTo identify genes conserved specifically in the family Euphorbiaceae, amino acid sequences translated from the putative Jatropha genes predicted in this study were compared with those of genes in the genomes of A. thaliana, O. sativa, P. trichocarpa, V. vinifera, L. japonicus, and Glycine max, as well as protein sequences in the TrEMBL protein database.33 Sequences from the predicted genes in the R. communis genome34 and the gene index database for cassava (Manihot esculenta) were used as references for Euphorbiaceae protein-encoding genes. BLAST searches with a cut-off (E-value = 1e-20) indicated that 1529 genes (4% of the predicted protein-encoding genes) were found only in the Euphorbiaceae. The InterPro annotations of these Euphorbiaceae-specific genes were surveyed to find conserved motifs in these genes, and consequently, 22 InterPro motifs were likely to be conserved in five or more genes (Supplementary Table S16). Of these, the C1-like motif (IPR011424), the pentatricopeptide repeat motif (IPR002885), and the cytochrome P450 motif (IPR001128) were found in 10, 10, and 9 genes, respectively.Furthermore, 1176 of the genes predicted in the Jatropha genome assembly had matching sequences only in the Jatropha cDNA database suggesting that these genes are specific to J. curcas. The most common InterPro motifs found in these genes were the protein kinase-like domain (IPR011009) detected in six genes (Supplementary Table S17). The entire list of the Euphorbiaceae- and Jatropha-specific genes is provided in Supplementary Tables S18 and S19, respectively.To investigate the syntenic relations between the Jatropha and the other plant genomes, status of conservation of relative gene positions was surveyed using the scaffolds of Jatropha genomic sequences. Among the 1556 scaffolds with five or more predicted genes, conservation of the relative positions of three or more genes was observed in 829 scaffolds (53%) against genes predicted in the R. communis genomic sequences34 (Supplementary Tables S20 and S21). It appears that a significant degree of synteny can be expected within the family Euphorbiaceae. A syntenic relationship was also detected against the genomes of G. max and A. thaliana to a lesser degree. Microsyntenic relations have been observed in 178 (11%) and 256 (16%) of the 1556 scaffolds of the Jatropha genomic sequences, respectively (Supplementary Tables S20 and S21). The microsyntenic relationships between these plant species may provide useful information for predicting gene organization in the ancestral genome of dicots.Five SSR motives were found in the 100 genome-derived microsatellite markers tested. Most of the SSRs were poly (AT)n (83 SSRs), followed by poly (AAT)n (8 SSRs), poly (AG)n (5 SSRs), poly (AAG)n (3 SSRs), and poly (AC)n (1 SSR). A total of 88 markers generated specific amplicons, whereas the other eight and four markers showed no amplification and non-specific amplification, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S7). The small number of markers detecting non-specific amplification suggested less redundancy of SSR regions in the Jatropha genome. The number of alleles per locus ranged from one to four with a mean value of 1.31. Markers showed no polymorphisms; those detecting a single allele were most frequent. PIC values ranged from 0 to 0.45 with a mean value of 0.06 (Supplementary Fig. S8). The large number of markers detecting no polymorphisms and the low mean value of the PIC indicated that genetic diversity in Jatropha lines is generally narrow. An UPGMA genetic tree of the 12 lines of J. curcas illustrated that the three lines derived from meso-America regions (Guatemala1, Guatemala2, and Mexico2b) are genetically distinct from the other lines derived from Asia and Africa, whereas no significant difference was observed between the Asian and African lines (Supplementary Fig. S9).4.

IntroductionTranscription factors play a key role in modulating the acclimation response of plants to various internal or external cues. A subset of these transcription factors belongs to the zinc finger proteins (ZFPs) characterized by zinc finger domains (ZFs) enabling protein interaction with DNA. The term “zinc finger” refers to a protein motif that binds a zinc ion in order to stabilize its three-dimensional structure consisting of a two-stranded antiparallel ß-sheet and a-helix.1 ZFPs are classified according to the number and the order of the Cys (cysteine) and His (histidine) residues that bind the zinc ion. Among these different ZFPs types, C2H2-ZFPs are one of the most abundant and often studied transcription factors in eukaryotes.2In silico analysis has shown that ~3% of all genes in mammals, ~2.3% in Diptera, ~0.8% in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and ~0.7% in Arabidopsis thaliana encode C2H2-ZFPs.3 In A. thaliana, more than 2000 potential transcription factors have been identified,4,5 of which ~9% belong to the C2H2-ZFP family.C2H2-ZFPs are characterized by a conserved sequence CX2–4CX3FX5LX2HX3-5H (where underlined C and H represent Cys and His interacting with the zinc ion). Plant C2H2-ZFPs possess one to five ZFs. Two main features distinguish most of them from other eukaryote C2H2-ZFPs. First, most plant C2H2-ZFPs contain an invariant QALGGH motif inside the ZF, whereas yeast and animals do not. Second, for multiple-fingered C2H2-ZFPs, ZFs are separated by longer spacers than in other eukaryotes.1,6 Both the QALGGH motif and length of sequences between two successive ZFs are thought to be important for the affinity of the protein to its DNA target.6–8 C2H2-ZFPs can be divided into three classes according to the number, types and arrangement of ZFs.3,9 According to an in silico genome-wide comparative analysis performed in A. thaliana,3 two classes, A and B, encompass ZFPs that contain tandem ZFs in one or in more than one array, respectively (as proposed earlier for yeast genome). Class C corresponds to ZFPs containing a single ZF or dispersed ZFs (ZFs being considered dispersed when more than 10 amino acid (AA) residues separate two consecutive ZFs). Most C2H2-ZFPs in animals and yeast can be classified in Classes A and B, but plant C2H2-ZFPs are found mainly in Class C. This third class can be divided into three subclasses according to the number of AA residues separating the two invariant His of the ZFs: three, four or five residues for Subclasses C1, C2 and C3, respectively. Inside Subclass C1, 85% of the C2H2 proteins contain strictly the QALGGH motif (or with few modifications),3 also called Q-type ZFs in rice.3,10In silico studies on ZFPs have identified 64 Q-type C2H2-ZFPs in A. thaliana,3 99 in rice (Oryza sativa)10 and 47 in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum).11First considered exclusively as transcription factors with sequence-specific binding to DNA, ZFPs are now known to recognize RNA or other proteins.12 However, their role as transcription factors is still most often studied. In plants, the C2H2 proteins belonging to Class C are the largest family. They are involved in a wide range of processes including development and organogenesis along with response to stress and defence pathways. These proteins have been shown to be involved in salt stress, cold, dehydration and light stress in A. thaliana,13–16 the switch from vegetative to floral development and drought in rice,11,17 flower development and drought in Petunia,18,19 pathogen defence in Capsicum annuum20 and water and salt stress in Thellungiella halophila.21 These studies suggest that C2H2-ZFPs may not be specific to one particular stress but may regulate responses to several stresses.In Populus tremula × alba, by studying the first molecular stages of the mechanosensing response, we recently identified a C2H2 Q-type gene called PtaZFP2. Its expression is induced as fast as 5 min after the bending of a poplar stem.22 As in other plant species,6 this gene is also regulated by other stresses such as cold and salt stress.22 Apart from this PtaZFP2 gene, little is known about the Q-type C2H2 gene subfamily in poplar (and in woody species more generally) or their specific responses to different abiotic stresses, in particular to mechanical loadings. In this study, we performed a genome-wide identification of Q-type ZFP genes in poplar, using PtaZFP2 protein sequence as a query in the NR protein and Phytozome databases. In all, 310 sequences were identified, belonging to more than 50 plant species. We then focused on two-fingered Q-type ZFPs encompassing 168 non-redundant sequences from different plant species, including 16 Populus trichocarpa sequences. Expression analyses of different members of the poplar Q-type subfamily were performed by designing primers according to the different poplar phylogenetic groups. We determined their mRNA distribution in different organs with or without abiotic stresses. Finally, poplar cell cultures were used to study the effect of calcium, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and phytohormones on the expression of the two genes previously described as showing the strongest response to stem bending.2. Materials and methods2.1. Identification of C2H2 plant proteinsA BLAST search (blastp with default parameters)23 against the NR protein database of NCBI and P. trichocarpa Phytozome database was performed, using the AA sequence of the PtaZFP2 gene from P. tremula × P. alba (GenBank: FM172949.1) as query sequence. All hits below an E-value of 10-4 were retrieved. We found 310 and 26 sequences in NCBI and P. trichocarpa Phytozome databases, respectively. These 336 sequences were analysed using the Multiple Expectation Maximization for Motif Elicitation (MEME)24 program with default settings to detect ZF motifs. Only two-fingered C2H2 sequences were further analysed (243 sequences).2.2. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysisProtein sequences were aligned using MUSCLE.25 Identical and incomplete sequences were excluded from the alignment. The final alignment was composed of 168 sequences. Due to the high variability of sequences and length of spacers between the two ZFs, phylogeny was carried out only on the ZF motifs. The phylogenetic tree of 100 bootstrapped samples was constructed using the maximum likelihood (ML) method implemented PhyML26 using the GTR + I + G model, chosen after using the program ProtTest27 on the sequence set.2.3. Identification of conserved two-fingered C2H2 plant protein-associated motifsThe program MEME24 was used with default settings, except for the maximum number of motifs to find, which was set to 15, to detect potential conserved motifs including the known ZF motifs.2.4. Plant material and culture conditionsYoung poplars (P. tremula × P. alba INRA clone 717-1B4) were obtained by in vitro micropropagation and grown on nutrient solution28 after acclimation (for more details, see Martin et al.22). Trees were grown in a growth chamber (16 h/8 h light/dark at 40 µmol m-2 s-1 at 24°C/20°C with relative humidity of 60 ± 10%). Two months after micropropagation, the poplars were ready to be used in experiments; stems were about 35 cm tall at this stage. The tested stems ranged in diameter from 4.3 to 6.3 mm, with an average of 5.18 ± 0.51 mm.2.5. Cell culture conditionsPoplar suspension cells were initiated by transferring 2–3 g of fresh callus to 20 ml of liquid MB5 medium containing 2 mg ml-1 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), 0.2 g l-1l-glutamine and 1 mg l-1 vitamins (nicotinic acid, pyridoxine hydrochloride and thiamine hydrochloride). Cell cultures were maintained in the dark at 120 rpm on a gyratory shaker in a culture room at 23°C for at least 8 days. Cell cultures were then maintained in the same environmental conditions by putting 10 ml into 40 ml of fresh MB5 medium each week containing 2 mg ml-1 2,4-D, 0.2 g l-1l-glutamine and 1 mg l-1 vitamins (nicotinic acid, pyridoxine hydrochloride and thiamine hydrochloride).2.6. Plant treatmentsPlants were subjected to salt, osmotic, cold, wounding, or bending stresses, or were unstressed (controls). Salt stress was applied by adding NaCl to the hydroponic solution to a final concentration of 50, 100 or 200 mM. Osmotic stress was applied by adding polyethylene glycol (PEG) to the hydroponic solution to a final concentration of 20% (w/v). In cold treatment, plants were left at 4°C for 1 h. Plants were wounded by crushing their laminae (leaves without the petiole and central vein) with a pestle. Sampling was carried out 1 h after the treatments. Finally, stem bending was performed by rolling stems on a plastic tube according to Martin et al.29 taking care that the applied mechanical loading was the same for all stems. The bent portion (3 cm long) was collected 0, 10, 15, 30 min, 1, 3, 5 or 24 h after bending. Samples were quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen after sampling and stored at -80°C until analysis.2.7. Cell treatmentsAliquots of 5 ml of 4-day-old cell cultures were placed in 15 ml sterile tubes and left with stirring at 120 rpm in the dark at 23°C for 2 h to prevent aliquoting stress. The culture cells were then treated with calcium 10 mM (CaCl2), hydrogen peroxide 500 µM (H2O2), abscisic acid 100 µM (ABA), ethephon 1 mM (Ete), gibberellic acid 100 µM (GA), methyljasmonate 100 µM (MeJA) or cycloheximide 50 µM (Chx). Stirring, darkness and temperature were maintained throughout the experiment. After different times, the medium was removed and cells were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80°C until analysed.2.8. RNA isolation and cDNA synthesisTotal RNAs were extracted from 5 ml of culture cells using CTAB extraction buffer as described by Chang et al.30 and then treated with RNase-free RQ1 DNase (Promega, Charbonnières-les-Bains, France). RNA was quantified spectrophotometrically and checked by agarose gel electrophoresis. First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 µg total RNAs using oligodT and SuperScript III (Invitrogen, Cergy-Pontoise, France) following the supplier's protocol.2.9. RT–PCR analysisRT–PCR analyses were performed on 4 µl of 1:40 dilution of the first-strand cDNA. After a heat step at 95°C for 5 min, PCR cycling conditions were: denaturation (95°C, 30 s), annealing (temperature according to primers, Supplementary data 1, 30 s) and elongation (72°C, 45 s), ending with a final elongation step at 72°C for 5 min. Transcripts of each studied gene and of reference genes EF-1a (Elongation Factor-1a) and ubiquitine (Ubq) were amplified using the primers described in Supplementary data 1. The PCR products were separated on a 2% agarose gel.2.10. Real-time quantitative RT–PCR experimentsThe real-time quantitative RT–PCR amplifications were performed using an iCycler IQ (Bio-Rad) with SYBR green as a fluorescent dye. Each PCR reaction (25 µl) contained the following: cDNA (4 µl of 1:40 dilution of the first cDNA strands), MESA GREEN qPCR MasterMix Plus for SYBR® Assay w/ fluorescein (Eurogentec, Angers, France) (1×) and primers (200nM of each). After a heat step at 94°C for 3 min, PCR cycling conditions were 40 cycles of denaturation (94°C, 15 s), annealing (temperature according to primers, Supplementary Table S1, 15 s) and elongation (72°C, 20 s), ending with a final elongation step at 72°C for 5 min. Transcripts of each studied gene and of reference gene EF-1a were amplified using the primers described in Supplementary data 1.3. Results and discussion3.1. Identification of Q-type C2H2-ZFPs in P. trichocarpa and their phylogenic relationships with Q-type C2H2-ZFPs of other plant speciesThe mechanosensitive PtaZFP2 gene isolated in P. tremula × P. alba encodes a C2H2-ZFP with two Q-type ZFs, i.e. containing an invariant plant QALGGH motif.22 To gain a better understanding of the putative function of this gene subfamily in poplar in response to mechanical loading, the PtaZFP2 protein sequence was used for BLAST searches against the NR protein and P. trichocarpa Phytozome databases. The search with the NR protein database resulted in a total of 310 Q-type C2H2-ZFPs sequences belonging to more than 50 species (data not shown). A first search with the MEME program on these sequences enabled us to determine Q-type ZF domains and manually to distinguish 16 sequences with only one ZF, 226 with two ZFs, 53 with three ZFs, 13 with four ZFs and two sequences with five ZFs. The same was done with the P. trichocarpa Phytozome database and 26 C2H2-ZFPs sequences from P. trichocarpa genome were identified. Among these sequences, 16 contained two ZFs, 6 had three ZFs, 3 had four ZFs and 1 had five ZFs. No one-fingered ZFPs were identified in poplar with our method. However, when only one ZF motif was used for supplementary BLAST analysis against the P. trichocarpa Phytozome database, five poplar ZFPs with one QALGGH finger were detected. Because they are known to be implicated in abiotic stress responses,6 in this study we focused the phylogenic analysis on two-fingered sequences, corresponding to the C1-2i subclass of ZFPs described in A. thaliana.3 AA sequence alignment enabled us to discriminate redundant sequences, and the final tree was constructed with 168 sequences (152 from NCBI and 16 from P. trichocarpa Phytozome database). Among the 16 P. trichocarpa sequences, the POPTR-1833s00200 is a very short sequence (partial EST), corresponding to a predictive peptide sequence of only 77 AA, whereas the other Q-type ZFP protein contains between 193 AA and 318 AA. In the case of POPTR-0008s03220, the N-terminus part of the predictive sequence seems shorter than would be expected for a complete sequence. Analysis of the P. trichocarpa genome32 revealed that 15 of these sequences could be localized on nine different chromosomes (1,2,4,6,8,9,10,14,16) out of the 19 chromosomes of the poplar genome. Examination in the P. trichocarpa genome browser showed that in the same chromosome, these Q-type C2H2 genes are not particularly close to each other. To illustrate phylogenetic relationships between these sequences, the ML tree (unrooted) was constructed (Supplementary data 2) using PhyML.26 Bootstrap values from 100 replicates were used to indicate the robustness of the result. This analysis clearly identified two major groups with a strong bootstrap value of 87: Group G1 and Group G2 (Fig. 1a and b, respectively). Sequences from monocots and eudicots were found in both, but in each group, the monocot sequences were grouped. This finding suggests that the separation of these two groups was ancestral to the monocot/eudicot separation. Within each group, the bootstrap values are weak. As most C2H2-ZFPs share little homology with highly variable spacer length outside the conserved C2H2-ZFs, the phylogeny was performed on their C2H2-ZFs domains, justifying these lower bootstrap values. Interestingly, some motifs other than the ZF motifs were strictly associated with a group (e.g. MALEAL with Group G1 and LVDCHY with Group G2). These data reinforce the phylogenetic separation of the two groups and may reveal different functions between the corresponding proteins. An ML tree was also constructed with the 16 P. trichocarpa sequences (Fig. 2a). Here again two major independent groups were strongly differentiated, with a bootstrap value of 100, and a different distribution of conserved motifs could be observed between the two groups (Fig. 2b). Group G1 comprised four of these poplar sequences (POPTR_0009s09250, POPTR_0001s30260, POPTR_0002s12010 and POPTR_0014s01760). Inside Group G2, POPTR_0001s24250 corresponded to the P. trichocarpa orthologous gene of P. tremula × P. alba mechanosensitive gene PtaZFP2. When we compared these phylogenic relationships with the classification proposed for the A. thaliana C1-2i subclasses,3 Group G1 comprised STZ/ZAT10 (gi.15217692),33ZAT6 (gi.15237692)34 and AZF3 (gi.15239195)33 genes of A. thaliana, previously grouped in the C1-2iD subclass by Englbrecht et al.3 In our study, the other A. thaliana subclasses (C1-2iB and C1-2iC) were found in Group G2. The P. trichocarpa sequences POPTR_0009s03280, POPTR_0001s24250, POPTR_1833s00200, POPTR_0008s05110 and POPTR_0010s21650 had closest similarity with ZAT7 (gi.15231335), ZAT12 (gi.21593615) and At2g28710 (gi.15226942) A. thaliana genes (C1-2iB subclass), whereas the other poplar sequences of group G2 shared similarity with ZAT 5 (gi.15242772) and At3g10470 (gi.15228303) genes of A. thaliana (subclass C1-2iC). No poplar sequence corresponding to the A. thaliana C1-2iA (including the ZAT11 gene-gi.1418335) was found in this analysis.

C2H2 zinc finger domains and other conserved motifsFor a better analysis of these phylogenic relationships, we searched all the sequences for conserved motifs. Eight motifs including the ZFs were identified using the MEME algorithm and MUSCLE multiple sequence alignments (Fig. 1c). For each sequence of the tree, we manually annotated the absence or presence of each motif (Figs 1a, b and 2; Supplementary data 1). Interestingly, in each protein, the first and second ZF differed in their sequences and in particular by AAs localized in the C-terminus of the conserved QALGGH motif. The first ZF was characterized by a QALGGH R/K A/T S motif, whereas the second was characterized by QALGGH M/K RXH R/Y. These different signatures in the two ZFs had already been detected in A. thaliana and Petunia genomes. The first ZF was called Q2-2 or type A ZF for A. thaliana and Petunia, respectively, and the second ZF was called Q2-3 or type B.3,8 Also, the signatures in the different ZFs varied appreciably between the two phylogenic groups G1 and G2. In Group G1, the first ZF was QALGGHKA/TS, whereas in Group G2, it was QALGGHRA/TS. For the second ZF, the signature was QALGGHKRXHY in Group G1, but corresponded to QALGGHMRXHR in Group G2. Inside Group G1, five sequences out of the 72 sequences possess the first ZF of Group G2. These several proteins possessed a “mixed” signature forming a monophyletic group distinct from the other Group G1 proteins. Thus two subgroups, G1a and G1b, could be defined (Fig. 1a). For poplar sequences, the discrimination between the first and second ZF and between Group G1 and Group G2 was strict (Fig. 2a). In Petunia, in vitro binding analysis revealed that the conserved QALGGH motif played a critical role in DNA binding activity.7 Other work showed that the flanking residues at the C-terminus of QALGGH motif were important for the specific DNA recognition.8 Also, the optimal binding sites of the Petunia ZPT2-2 protein corresponded to the AGC(T) sequence for the first ZF and to the CAGT core for the second ZF,35 confirming the role of the residues flanking the QALGGH motif in the specificity of the DNA target-sequence recognition and in DNA binding. The function of the different isoforms of Q-type ZFPs proteins inside the same species is not well understood. It is debatable whether the different signatures in the C-terminus of the ZF between Group G1 and Group G2 confer an ability to regulate different sets of genes and different plant regulation pathways.Outside of the ZF motifs, a conserved DLN motif was found to be present at the C-terminus of all the sequences except in 11 sequences of Group G2, all belonging to monocot species. Two of these monocot sequences corresponded to TaZFP2 and TaZFP34, transcription factors of Q-type C2H2 subfamily in T. aestivum.11 In their study, the authors reported that these two sequences of 135 AA and 176 AA, respectively, were full length and effectively lacked a DLN motif, like 20 other T. aestivum Q-type sequences out of the 27 full-length two-fingered proteins identified. Apart from POPTR_1833s00200, which is probably a partial EST, all poplar sequences contain this domain (Fig. 2a). This DLN motif was first reported as the DLN box in A. thaliana Q-type C2H2 gene subfamily.33,34 This DLN-box domain has been shown to confer a repression activity to these transcription factors.16,36,37 Also, the DLN box corresponds to the EAR domain (ethylene-responsive element-binding factor (ERF)-associated amphiphilic repression domain) found in the ethylene-responsive element binding factor and auxin/indole-3-acetic acid families of transcriptional regulators.38 Recent in silico analysis revealed two distinct conservation patterns of the EAR domain: LxLxL and DLNxxP. Interestingly, in all the poplar sequences, a proline (P) was found three or four AAs after the DLN motif, and a leucine (L) was present before the aspartate (D). The plant proteins containing these motifs are involved in developmental, hormonal and stress signalling pathways.38 Although it should be tested experimentally, these results suggest that most of the poplar two-fingered Q-type C2H2 proteins could also be transcriptional repressors.Two lysine-rich motifs were found: the KG/RKRS/TKR domain was localized in the N-terminal part of the proteins before the first ZF and the KKPK domain at the end of the first ZF (Fig. 1c; Supplementary data 3). The first lysine-rich motifs has already been described in A. thaliana C2H2 proteins (named the B box) and may function as targeting signals for the translocation of proteins to the nucleus (NLS-nuclear localization signal).33 As the C2H2-ZFPs are known mainly as transcription factors, nuclear localization is necessary for their function. Most of the Q-type proteins of the phylogenic tree (Supplementary data 1) contained either the first motif (Group G1) or the second motif (Group G2). However, part of the proteins from Group G2, including the proteins homologous to the C1-2iC subclass of A. thaliana, possessed both motifs. Some monocot proteins of both Group G1 and Group G2 lacked these motifs, in particular the proteins that also lacked the DLN box. However, some plant transcription factors may lack an NLS, and they are thought to be imported into the nucleus by dimerizing with proteins that possess these signals.39 Alternatively, these proteins could be involved in interaction with RNA or other proteins as described for some of the ZFPs2 and do not need nuclear localization.Another motif found to be widely distributed among Q-type C2H2 proteins corresponds to the CLIMLAR domain (Fig. 1c), localized between the first lysine-rich motif and the first ZF (Supplementary data 3). This motif was present in all sequences except in some of the Group G2 monocot proteins. However, the CLIMLAR sensu stricto (CLIMLAR) domain was present only in a part of Group G1, again excluding any monocots. Such distribution of the motif sensu lato (C/S/Y L I/M/L/V M/L/A L A/S R/Q/K/N/H) or sensu stricto may reflect a different evolutionary story. This motif has been described as the L-Box domain (EXEXXAXCLXXL) in some C2H2 A. thaliana proteins and has been thought to be involved in protein–protein interactions or in maintaining the protein folding.33Finally, two other motifs were identified: the MALEAL domain localized in the N-terminal part of some G1 proteins and the LVDCHY domain located at the C-terminus end of some G2 proteins (Fig. 2b). The MALEAL motif was restricted to 42 out of the 50 eudicot proteins of Group G1 and the LVDCHY domain in 24 out of the 60 eudicot proteins of Group G2 (Fig. 1a and b). Interestingly, the MALEAL motif was completely absent in monocot sequences of Group G1, whereas the LVDCHY domain was detected in five monocot sequences of Group G2. The distribution between Group G1 and Group G2 of each motif was very strict: no Group G1 sequence possessed the LVDCHY motif and no Group G2 sequence possessed the MALEAL motif. This strict distribution reinforces the phylogenetic separation already shown with ZFs. These motifs have not been described before in other Q-type C2H2 proteins and no function has been assigned to these domains. However, such cluster distribution may indicate a distinct role for the corresponding proteins in regulation or response to specific stresses.3.3. Expression pattern of poplar two-fingered Q-type C2H2-ZFPs in various organs and in response to different stressesNumerous studies have shown a role for C2H2 Q-type genes in response to different environmental stimuli.6 In poplar, PtaZFP2 mRNAs accumulated strongly and rapidly after stem bending, i.e. mechanical loading.22 For a better characterization of this gene subfamily in poplar, we studied the expression of different poplar two-fingered C2H2-ZFPs in different organs (leaf laminae, stems, roots) and in response to various treatments [salt, osmotic stress (PEG), cold stress (4°C), wounding (W) and bending]. As our poplar model species corresponded to the P. tremula × P. alba hybrid, we searched for homologous sequences of P. trichocarpa genes in the PopulusDB database, where cDNA libraries were built from P. tremula or P. tremula × P. tremuloides (Populus section) samples. We then designed specific primers outside the conserved regions to amplify, by RT–PCR, several P. tremula × P. alba Q-type C2H2 sequences corresponding to different groups in the phylogenic tree. Three of these genes are included in Group G2 of the poplar phylogenic tree (Fig. 2a): PtaZFP2, isolated earlier,22 is orthologous to POPTR-0001s24250, its closest homologous gene PtaZFP1 homologous to POPTR-0009s03280 and PtaZFP3 corresponding to POPTR-0010s21650 (Fig. 2a). Three other sequences were chosen in Group G1 (PtaZFP4, PtaZFP5 and PtaZFP6) that correspond, respectively, to POPTR_0009s09250, POPTR_0001s30260 and POPTR_0014s01760 (Fig. 2a). As shown in Fig. 3, all mRNAs isoforms were detected in laminae, stems and roots, except for PtaZFP3 which were not detected in the laminae. PtaZFP3 was found to be poorly regulated in all organs, whatever the applied treatments, and will not be described further. When poplar plants were not subjected to any treatment (Fig. 3 lines C and C’), mRNA levels of all genes were higher in roots except for PtaZFP1. mRNA levels of the 5 Q-type C2H2 genes increased strongly in laminae after wounding treatment (Fig. 3a). The higher salt treatment (200 mM) also induced mRNA accumulation for all genes tested in all organs. In laminae, this mRNA induction was also observed for two Group G1 genes (PtaZFP4 and PtaZFP5) and for one Group G2 gene (PtaZFP2) for the smaller salt concentration (50 and 100 mM) (Fig. 3a). In roots, mRNA levels were high whatever the salt concentration tested (Fig. 3c). The various treatments were directly applied in the nutritive solution where roots were directly and continuously in stress conditions. In the case of osmotic stress with PEG treatment, mRNA levels increased for all genes in all organs. The osmotic stress induced by PEG treatment was close to the NaCl 200 mM treatment (hydric potential measurements: -1.3 and -1 MPa, respectively). mRNA induction was similar for the two treatments. Finally, the cold treatment induced all genes in laminae and stems except for PtaZFP1 in laminae and stems. This study suggests that expression patterns are not clearly different between the different Q-type C2H2 genes in poplar whatever their position in the two phylogenic groups. These results are in accordance with the role described for the A. thaliana Q-type C2H2 subfamily. For example, ZAT10 gene (included in phylogenic group G1) has been shown to be involved in the regulation pathway of osmotic, salinity and cold stresses.14 Other transcriptomic analyses have described an important function of A. thaliana ZAT12 gene (included in phylogenic group G2) in strong light, osmotic, oxidative and also cold stresses.15,40 However, in our study, all stresses (NaCl, PEG and cold) had an osmotic and therefore mechanical component. This may explain similarities in gene responses. Accumulation of PtaZFP1, PtaZFP2, PtaZFP3, PtaZFP4, PtaZFP5 and PtaZFP6 transcripts after different treatments in laminae (a), stems (b) and roots (c) of P. tremula × P. alba plants. Total RNAs were extracted from control plants (C and C’) or from treated plants (NaCl 50, 100 or 200 mM, PEG 20% (w/v), cold treatment at 4°C or wounding (for laminae only) 1 h after the treatment. Changes in the abundance PtaZFP1, PtaZFP2, PtaZFP3, PtaZFP4, PtaZFP5 and PtaZFP6 mRNAs were analysed by RT–PCR using specific primers (Supplementary data 1).

(d) Summary of the inductions of mRNA accumulation (+) observed in different agarose gels (a–c) according to each gene, organ and treatment.PtaZFP2 has already been shown to be implicated in mechanical stress.22 To test the putative role of other poplar Q-type C2H2 genes in response to mechanical loading, we subjected poplar plants to stem bending and studied the expression of the six genes in the stem at different times after treatment. As shown in Fig. 4, only the expression of PtaZFP2 and PtaZFP1 genes was strongly induced by mechanical loading in stems. The maximum mRNA accumulation occurred between 15 and 30 min after bending. Except for PtaZFP3, by increasing the cycle number of PCR, a small mRNA increase was also detected for the other poplar genes but to a much lower extent (data not shown). These variations were difficult to detect experimentally, but the plant might be able to perceive these slight inductions. Interestingly, PtaZFP1 mRNA accumulation occurred earlier than for PtaZFP2. A previous work on A. thaliana suggested a possible cascade between the different C2H2 genes during a signalling pathway. For example, ZAT12 is necessary for the expression of ZAT7 in response to oxidative stress.41 In the same way, a C2H2-ZFPs cascade might exist in poplar. Time course accumulation of PtaZFP1, PtaZFP2, PtaZFP3, PtaZFP4, PtaZFP5 and PtaZFP6 transcripts after stem bending of P. tremula × P. alba plants. Total RNAs were extracted from the stems of control plants (C) and from bent stems at different times (10, 15, 30 min, 1, 3, 5 and 24 h).

Upstream regulation of the two mechanosensitive genes PtaZFP1 and PtaZFP2Whereas physiological responses to mechanical stress are well described,42–46 little is known about the regulation of molecular actors of the mechanical signalling pathway. Calcium is known to be an important second messenger involved in numerous transduction pathways including mechanoperception,47 and several calmodulin-like (TCH2 and TCH3) proteins are involved in mechanical response in A. thaliana (for review, see Braam44). Other signalling molecules such as ROS and phytohormones (including jasmonates and ethylene) have been implicated in the mechanical transduction pathway.48 As shown in Fig. 4, PtaZFP1 and PtaZFP2 Q-type C2H2 genes are the most responsive to mechanical stress in P. tremula × alba. The corresponding orthologous genes of P. trichocarpa are very close in the phylogenetic tree, the proteins sharing 83.8% similarity. Also, the promoter sequence of PtaZFP2 contains putative cis-elements related to these signalling molecules.22 We therefore studied putative signals involved in the regulation of these two mechanical responsive genes by testing the effect of calcium, ROS, ethylene, MeJA, ABA, GA and Chx on the expression of both genes in poplar cell cultures (Figs 5 and 6 for PtaZFP1 and PtaZFP2, respectively).

For a better understanding, a semi-logarithmic scale has been used for g.As shown in Fig. 5a, external calcium treatment (10 mM) seems to significantly induce PtaZFP1 mRNA accumulation as little as 15 min after the treatment. In the case of PtaZFP2, the mRNA accumulation was weaker and not significantly different from the Mg2+ treatment used as control (Fig. 6a). In A. thaliana, some mechanosensitive genes have been shown to be regulated by calcium.49 However, the calcium concentrations necessary to detect a significant increase in TOUCH genes expression were higher (50 mM, 100 mM) than those used in our study. With stronger but non-physiologic concentrations of Ca2+ (50 or 100 mM), PtaZFP2 gene expression was also strongly induced (data not shown).Concerning the effect of ROS, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) increased mRNA accumulation for both genes, with higher levels for PtaZFP1 than for PtaZFP2 (Figs 5b and 6b, respectively). Several Q-type C2H2 genes in other species have been shown to be responsive to H2O2.15,20 Interestingly, transcriptome and transgenic plant analysis has shown that the A. thaliana ZAT12 and ZAT7 genes, included in the same phylogenetic group as PtaZFP1 and PtaZFP2, are associated with the response of plants to ROS during abiotic stresses.15,41In hormonal treatments, to test the effect of ethylene, ethephon (known to release ethylene in solution)50 was added to cell culture medium. Both PtaZFP1 and PtaZFP2 mRNA levels increased 15 min after ethephon application (Figs 5c and 6c). Whereas the mRNA accumulation was very transient for PtaZFP2, it was stronger and longer for PtaZFP1. Such induction of Q-type C2H2 genes by ethylene has already been reported in C. annuum20 and an ethylene burst was observed in response to mechanical stress.45,51 However, some reports suggest that ethephon could release both ethylene and H2O2 into the medium52 and so further analysis is needed to confirm the regulation of these genes by ethylene.Among the other hormones tested (Figs 5d–f and 6d–f), only MeJA had a slight effect on PtaZFP2 mRNA accumulation 30 min after the treatment (Fig. 6d). It has been demonstrated that wind and touch can induce the expression of lypoxygenase, the first enzyme of the biosynthesis pathway of jasmonate, in T. aestivum.53 Also, the STZ/ZAT10 gene of A. thaliana has recently been demonstrated to be involved in the jasmonic signalling pathway.54,55 To our knowledge, no study has revealed the involvement of abscisic and GAs in the mechanical signalling pathway, in accordance with the results in this study.As PtaZFP1 and PtaZFP2 gene expressions are induced very rapidly after stem bending, we tested whether they were primary genes by testing the effect of Chx, an inhibitor of protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells, alone or associated with ethephon. PtaZFP1 and PtaZFP2 mRNAs levels strongly increased with Chx treatment (Figs 5g and 6g) and by Chx associated with ethephon (data not shown). It thus seems that these genes may be primary genes whose expression may be regulated by the presence of a repressor on their promoters, as it has been demonstrated in other signalling pathway such as for genes responsive to auxin56 or wounding.574. ConclusionNumerous studies have shown that Q-type C2H2 ZF proteins play a key role in plant acclimation to biotic and abiotic stresses.6 However, the mode of regulation of C2H2 genes is complex and the specific role of each isoform in the different signal transduction pathways is still difficult to define. This study allowed the detection of two phylogenetic groups in the Q-type C2H2 ZFPs in plants that are distinguished essentially in their different signatures at the C-terminus of their two QALGGH domains. As these protein domains are essential for DNA binding, these results suggest that proteins inside these two groups may regulate different sets of genes. Although the phylogenetic study was conducted only on the ZF-conserved motifs, two new motifs have been shown to be clearly associated with each group. These data confirm a phylogenetic relationship inside these groups. Concerning these two additional motifs MALEAL and LVDCHY revealed by this analysis, biochemical analyses of these proteins would help to define their importance in protein–protein interaction, protein folding or protein localization. The expression analysis of six poplar Q-type C2H2 ZFPs confirms their involvement in response to abiotic stresses such as cold, salt, osmotic and mechanical stresses. However, no real specificity of expression was detected between these genes towards these different stresses. However, as noted by Telewski,45 a number of these abiotic stimuli induce plasma membrane deformation via turgor pressure variation and they can also be considered as mechanical stimuli similar to wind and gravity. Finally, despite the high protein similarity between PtaZFP1 and PtaZFP2 and the similar response of corresponding genes to mechanical stress, some differences have been revealed in their expression in response to signalling molecules such as calcium, H2O2 and MeJA, suggesting their implication in different regulation pathways. It remains to be clarified how such signalling molecules could regulate these two genes in response to mechanical stress.Supplementary DataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis research was funded by a Ministry of Research grant (to D.G.) and received support from the French Agence Nationale de la Recherche, grant ANR-09-BLAN-0245-01.The authors are grateful to Christelle Boisselet for her help with plant and cells productions and to Sylvaine Labernia for her help in molecular experiments.Supplementary data"

IntroductionComprising one-tenth of all flowering plants and containing over 20 000 species, the Asteraceae are one of the largest vascular plant families.1 With the exception of Antarctica, the Asteraceae are distributed on all continents. Species in this family are extremely various in secondary chemistry,2 inflorescence morphology3 and chromosome numbers.4 This huge variation provides great opportunities to acquire insight into the diversification process in this family, which began 42–36 million years ago.5 The Asteraceae are not only interesting because of their phenotypic and species diversity, but this family also includes members of economically important food crops, herbal species, ornamentals and plants for the cut-flower industry. Other members such as Jacobaea vulgaris, Senecio vulgaris and Taraxacum officinale are weedy and have an economical and ecological impact.6,7We sequenced the complete chloroplast genome of J. vulgaris with next generation sequencing techniques to find new genetic markers that are phylogenetically informative and to discover intraspecific polymorphic markers for population studies. The conservative structure of the chloroplast genome makes it easy to compare with other members of the Asteraceae family. In a recent study of Panero and Funk,8 12 major lineages of Asteraceae were found with the Bayesian and maximum parsimony methods by combining 10 chloroplast loci from 108 taxa. Within the subfamily Asteroideae, strong statistical support was found for tribal relationships except for the Senecioneae tribe. In the Bayesian analysis, this tribe was unresolved, and in the maximum parsimony analysis, it was placed as a sister group to Calenduleae without strong statistical support (52% bootstrap proportions). In other studies of Pelser et al.,9,10 a phylogenetic analysis of the nuclear ribosomal (nr) internal spacers and external spacer and five chloroplast loci were done to clarify intergeneric relationships within Senecioneae and to delimitate the genus Senecio. Although these phylogenies gave more insight, they still lacked strong statistical support and resolution.No chloroplast genome has been previously sequenced from any species in the Senecioneae clade, and the chloroplast genome sequence of J. vulgaris can yield more information about variation within this clade, as well as between clades of the Asteroideae subfamily. In this study, the chloroplast genome of J. vulgaris (tribe Jacobaea) was compared with Guizotia abyssinica, Helianthus annuus, Parthenium argentatum (all belonging to tribe Heliantheae) and Lactuca sativa (tribe Lactuceae). To guide future phylogenetic studies within the Asteraceae family, we identified new phylogenetically informative chloroplast markers by finding differences within and between genome organization.Jacobaea vulgaris is a troublesome weed that belongs to the Asteraceae family and is native to Europe and western Asia, ranging from Norway through Turkey, and from Great Britain to Siberia. It was first reported in the 1850s in Canada,11 in 1875 in New Zealand12 and shortly thereafter in Australia13 and in 1900 at the west coast of North America.14 In introduced areas, J. vulgaris is a pest species, outcompeting local plants and containing pyrrolizidine alkaloids which are toxic to herbivores.15 Control is difficult, since the lifecycle can vary from annual to short-lived perennial, depending on the genotype. Moreover, seeds remain viable in the soil for several years.16Jacobaea vulgaris causes four million dollar losses annually to cattle poisoning and control in Australia alone.17Joshi and Vrieling18 compared J. vulgaris plants from the invasive areas with plants from the native area and found that invasive individuals contained higher pyrrolizidine alkaloid levels, have a 30% higher reproductive effort, are more susceptible to attack by specialist herbivores and less susceptible to generalist herbivores. These results suggest that selection pressures in the invasive area shaped the different allocation patterns in J. vulgaris in the invasive areas within 70 generations. However, it is possible that introduced populations were derived from native European populations that happened to express pyrrolizidine alkaloid and allocation patterns that are similar to those currently observed in invasive ranges.To exclude the null hypothesis that these patterns are observed as a result of genetic drift rather than natural selection, native source populations need to be identified and compared with invasive populations.19 Source populations can be pinpointed by using neutral molecular markers such as amplification fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs). A previous study on J. vulgaris, based on nuclear AFLP data, did not show a difference in the amount of variation between native and invasive individuals. These findings suggest that introductions from multiple source populations have occurred.20 Other neutral markers are single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and microsatellite markers in the chloroplast genome.21–23Next generation sequencing can produce DNA sequences cheaply and quickly,24 facilitating the rapid sequencing of nuclear and organellar genomes. Chloroplast genomes are known for their conservative rates of evolution.25 With an average size of 150 kb, chloroplast genomes are sufficiently large to find differences between and within species.26–28 The absence of recombination and maternal transmission of the chloroplast genome (limiting gene flow to seed dispersal only) makes cpDNA markers useful for tracing source population(s).29,30In this study, we sequenced the chloroplast genome of 17 J. vulgaris individuals by using the Illumina genome analyzer platform. This is the first study sequencing multiple individuals of the same species with next generation sequencing. Multiple individuals were sequenced to reveal intraspecific variation (SNPs and microsatellite loci). Finally, we compared two different procedures of preparation for sequencing the chloroplast genome, namely direct extraction of the chloroplast DNA and amplifying the cpDNA with a long-range PCR.2. Materials and methods2.1. Extraction of chloroplasts and isolation of DNA from chloroplastsBy using the chloroplast extraction kit of Sigma-Aldrich (CP-ISO) and following the manufacturer's protocol, chloroplasts from sample nr. 17 (Table 1) were isolated out of 30 g of fresh leaf material. To remove unwanted whole cells and cell wall debris, the blended leaf material with the chloroplast isolation buffer was centrifuged. To separate the intact from the broken chloroplasts, a 40% Percoll layer was used. Before DNA extraction, the intact chloroplasts were treated with ST buffer (400 mM sucrose, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.8, 0.1% bovine serum albumin) with a final concentration of 25 µg/ml DNAse-1 (Sigma-Aldrich) per gram of leaf material to digest DNA outside the intact chloroplasts. After centrifuging, the chloroplast pellet was resuspended in a Tris EDTA NaCl buffer (100 mM Tris, pH 7.2, 50 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 100 mM NaCl, 0.2% ß-mercaptoethanol). To extract the DNA from the chloroplasts, the chloroplasts were lysed with 1% sodium dodecyl sulphate followed by a phenol/chloroform step to remove proteins. The DNA was precipitated overnight with 1/10 vol. of 5 M ammonium acetate and 1 vol. of isopropanol. After centrifuging, the pellet was washed with 70% ethanol and redissolved in TE buffer (1 M Tris–HCl, pH = 8.0, 0.5 M EDTA).31Geographical information, percentage of the chloroplast genome sequenced, method used for preparing the template for Illumina sequencing, lane number on the Illumina platform and reads obtained from the 17 individuals of J. vulgaris that were sequencedNumbers given in parenthesis are the number of single-end reads × 1000.aPaired-end reads.Geographical information, percentage of the chloroplast genome sequenced, method used for preparing the template for Illumina sequencing, lane number on the Illumina platform and reads obtained from the 17 individuals of J. vulgaris that were sequencedNumbers given in parenthesis are the number of single-end reads × 1000.aPaired-end reads.2.2. Total DNA extractionTotal DNA extractions from samples 1 to 16 of J. vulgaris (Table 1) were carried out on five leaf punches of 1 cm diameter each, using the CTAB extraction protocol of Doyle and Doyle.322.3. Long-range PCRTo develop primers for a long-range PCR, the sequences of H. annuus (NC007977), L. sativa (DQ383816) and G. abyssinica (EU549769) were aligned with BioEdit. With the aid of this alignment and the annotation of H. annuus, primers were designed in conserved regions of genes. A total of 18 primer pairs was designed by Primer3 software,33 which collectively amplified the total chloroplast genome of J. vulgaris with overlapping fragments resulting in amplicons between 5808 and 11 110 bp (see Supplementary Table S1 for primer sequences). For amplification, the Takara La Taq kit (Takara Bio Inc., Otsu, Shiga, Japan) was used. PCR was carried out in a total volume of 20 µl containing 8–80 ng of DNA, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 2.5 mM of each dNTP, 0.7 µM of each primer and 1 U Taq DNA polymerase. The PCR cycling conditions were as follows: 1 min at 94°C; 30 cycles of 10 s at 98°C and 12 min at 69°C; followed by 10 min at 72°C. PCR products were loaded on a 1.5% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide and visualized under UV light to check for amplification. If the PCR products contained more than one band, the total product was always loaded on a 1% agarose gel and bands of the right size were cut out of the gel. To extract and purify the DNA fragments from the gel, the Wizard SV gel and PCR Clean-Up System of Promega was used. All cleaned PCR products were run on a gel to estimate the amount of product, and in addition, the amount of DNA was quantified with an ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technologies). All 18 amplicons for each individual sample were pooled in equal molar ratios containing roughly 200–300 ng of DNA resulting in 16 pooled samples of 75 µl each.2.4. SequencingFor sequencing of the cpDNA, three lanes on an Illumina sequencer (Illumina 1G/Solexa, Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) were used. Sequencing was carried out at the Leiden Genome Technology Center. In the first lane, the DNA isolated from the chloroplasts of sample 17 was run with paired-end reads of 32 bp. In the second lane, the pooled long-range PCR products of samples 1–13, 15 and 16 were run and in the third lane sample 14. Both were single-end runs of 35 bp (Table 1). Sample 14 was run in a separate lane because of its low DNA concentration. Preparation of all products was done following the protocol of Illumina kits with minor modifications. For sample 17, DNA was fragmented by a nebulizer using 32 psi N2 for 6 min. After purification, the DNA was eluted in 15 µl elution buffer. The samples were blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase, Klenow polymerase and T4 polynucleotide kinase. After purification, an A-residue was added to the 3' end of the DNA fragments using Klenow fragment (3'–5' exo-minus). Purification was done with a Qiagen MinElute column. Adapters of the paired-end adapter oligo mix were ligated to the DNA fragments. After purification with a Qiagen MinElute column, adapter-ligated DNAs in the range of 200–250 bp were size selected using agarose electrophoresis. Products were isolated from the gel using a QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit and after purification a PCR was done.For samples 1–16 (Table 1), sonication with a Bioruptor was used to fragment the DNA. This machine was placed in a room at 4°C and was kept cool by adding ice. For a total of 15 min, the machine was set on 30 s active and 30 s inactive. This sonication step was repeated four times. All other steps were the same as done for sample 17 except for the PCR step. Unique index tags of six bases provided in the Multiplexing Sample Preparation Oligonucleotide Kit were added in the PCR step to discriminate between the 16 samples. The amplified libraries were quantified by lab-on-a-chip (Agilent Technologies) followed by equimolar mixing of 10 nM per sample. Cluster generation was performed after applying 6 pM of each sample to the individual lanes of the Illumina flow cell, and sequencing was carried out on the Illumina Genome Analyzer according to the manufacturer's instructions. Image analysis and base calling were performed using the Illumina Pipeline 1.3.2, where sequence tags were obtained after purity filtering. This was followed by an alignment using MAQ.2.5. Data filtering and genome assemblySample 17 from the first lane was used to assemble a draft chloroplast (cp) genome of J. vulgaris. The software package MAQ v0.5.0 was used to map all quality-filtered paired reads of the first run against the chloroplast genome of H. annuus. To solve gaps in this consensus sequence, a de novo assembly was done with the same data using the software package Velvet v 0.634 (parameters: hash length = 21), which produced 37 747 contigs. To find contigs with homology to the reference, these contigs were aligned to the H. annuus reference sequence with the program Mummer v3.0.35 The contigs having homology to the reference were extended by using the original reads with Velvet. These extended contigs were aligned to the reference of H. annuus with Mummer once again, and the contigs which assembled properly were saved. These final contigs were aligned against the consensus sequence; as a result, some of the gaps in the consensus were solved. A new MAQ alignment was performed, mapping all the Illumina reads against the last consensus sequence made, to produce the draft sequence.2.6. Bridging the gaps that were still in the draft sequenceThe draft sequence still contained 23 gaps with an average gap length of 394 bp. Gaps were bridged by adding the data from the runs of the cpDNA amplified by a long-range PCR of 16 individuals. These data were used in Velvet to produce a de novo sequence (parameters: hash length = 21, short-fastq reads). The resulting de novo contigs were aligned against the draft sequence in the Blast's bl2seq multiple sequence aligner. In this way, five gaps with a total of 1822 bp were bridged. The last 18 gaps were bridged by developing primers around the gaps, and traditional Sanger sequencing to yield the final complete cp genome.2.7. AnnotationThe program DOGMA36 was used for annotating all genes and to identify rRNAs and tRNAs. A circular cp genome map (Fig. 1) was drawn using the program GenomeVx.37Representative map of the chloroplast genome of J. vulgaris (GenBank accession HQ234669).Representative map of the chloroplast genome of J. vulgaris (GenBank accession HQ234669).2.8. Comparison of the chloroplast DNA of J. vulgaris with other Asteraceae genomes analysedA total of 22 conserved protein-coding genes from five species, extracted from all available complete chloroplast genomes from Asteraceae deposited at NCBI GenBank (H. annuus, NC007977; L. sativa, DQ383816; P. argentatum, GU120098; G. abyssinica, EU549769 and J. vulgaris, HQ234669), were aligned using the pairwise automatic alignment tool in MacClade 4.0638 with further adjustment by hand. To get insight in the informative character of the selected protein-coding genes, maximum parsimony analyses were run on the individual alignments comprising a total of 33 669 bp with PAUP* 4.0b1039 using heuristic search, random addition with 100 replicates and tree bisection-reconnection (TBR) swapping. The relative robustness for clades found in all single most parsimonious trees (MPTs) was assessed by performing 1000 replicates of bootstrapping40 using fast, stepwise additions, TBR branch-swapping with 10 random taxon additions per replicate, MULTREES on and holding 100 trees per replicate. We also calculated tree lengths and consistency index (CI) and retention index (RI) values measuring the extent of homoplasy.2.9. Detection of polymorphic lociFor visualizing the output of all reads, Mapview was used.41 This program visualizes all reads that are mapped against the reference genome. Furthermore, it can produce a SNP list. The final assembled cp genome was used as a reference. To find SNPs, genomes of individuals 1–17 were used. SNPs were only added to the list if at least one individual that varied from the reference genome had a coverage of at least 30 reads traversing that particular nucleotide and only when SNPs were located outside A and T polymer regions. Potential microsatellite regions were tracked by looking for 10 or more repeats of A and T nucleotides.3. Results and discussion3.1. Construction of the chloroplast genome of J. vulgarisThe chloroplast genome of J. vulgaris is 150 686 bp in length. The genome contains two inverted repeat (IR) regions of 24 777 bp each. The IRs are separated by a large single-copy (LSC) and a small single-copy (SSC) region of 82 855 and 18 277 bp, respectively. The genome comprises 81 protein-coding genes of which seven are located in the IRs. Ycf1 lies partly in the IR and the single-copy region. The four rRNA genes are all located in the IR. There are 29 unique tRNA genes. Twenty-two tRNA genes are located in the single-copy region, whereas the others are located in the IR (Fig. 1).The single lane on Illumina yielded sufficient reads to map more than 99.9% of the complete cp genome of J. vulgaris. For the pooled individuals, on average 92% of the whole genome was mapped. There was a highly significant correlation between the number of reads and percentage of the genome mapped (Fig. 2). From the figure, it is estimated that ~1 300 000 single-end Illumina reads of 32 bp are needed to reach a mapping percentage higher than 99.9% of the cp genome of J. vulgaris. Number of Illumina sequencing reads plotted against percentage of the chloroplast genome mapped for 17 individuals of J. vulgaris.Number of Illumina sequencing reads plotted against percentage of the chloroplast genome mapped for 17 individuals of J. vulgaris.3.2. Comparison of the sequencing success of cpDNA extracted from chloroplasts with amplified cpDNA using long-range PCRFor the first lane with cpDNA extracted from isolated chloroplasts, a paired-end run was carried out on the Illumina platform, yielding 582 Mb of sequence with a read length of 32 bp. Of all reads, only 2.1% (391 604 reads) mapped against the chloroplast genome of H. annuus. The obtained reads covered 99.9% of the cp genome of J. vulgaris (Table 1, Fig. 3). The average coverage was 83 with a coefficient of variation of 0.34 (Fig. 4).

(B) Whole chloroplast genome coverage plotted for 16 individuals of J. vulgaris run in two lanes total, of which DNA was obtained by using the long-range PCR method.For the other two lanes, containing long-range PCR products of 15 individuals in one lane and the long-range PCR products of one individual in a separate lane, a single-end run was carried out on the Illumina platform. This run yielded reads of 35 bp resulting in 339 and 388 Mb of sequence, respectively. For both lanes, more than 99.9% of the reads (96 894 177 and 11 075 400, respectively) mapped against the chloroplast genome of H. annuus. In both lanes, the reads obtained covered more than 99.9% of the cp genome of J. vulgaris (Table 1, Fig. 3). The average coverage obtained for both lanes combined was 4920×. Average coverage varied largely between primer pairs, with average coverage ranging from 542× for the lowest to 19 755× for the highest primer pair (Fig. 4). The average coefficient of variation of coverage within primer pairs, averaged over all primer pairs, is 1.04 (Fig. 4). In summary, the variation was three times higher than that obtained with the direct cpDNA extraction.However, extraction of chloroplasts and subsequent extraction of DNA from these chloroplasts were not very efficient for sequencing the complete chloroplast genome. The cpDNA extract still contained around 98% of non-cpDNA. The low efficiency of the chloroplast extraction method might be due to the fact that (nuclear) DNA sticks to the surface of the chloroplast31 or to a shortage of DNAases to remove DNA in the intact chloroplast solution. Furthermore, the low efficiency can be caused by poor lysis of the chloroplasts. In contrast, the cpDNA amplified with a long-range PCR contained less than 1% non-cpDNA. Apparently, the long-range PCR worked very efficiently in J. vulgaris, and the results were much better than the results obtained with the same method for Pinus cpDNA sequencing42 where non-cpDNA ranged from 19% to 24%.Although the number of cpDNA reads obtained with the chloroplast extraction method was far lower than that obtained with the long-range PCR methods, the variation in coverage over the total chloroplast genome was approximately three times lower (Fig. 4). Moreover, the variation in the coverage of the long-range PCR products was primer-dependent (Fig. 4B). Despite the higher variation in coverage, using the long-range PCR products as templates for Illumina sequencing was far more efficient than using cpDNA directly. Moreover, the cpDNA extraction method proved to be cumbersome because we needed 30 g of fresh material per individual.3.3. Comparison of the chloroplast DNA of J. vulgaris with other Asteraceae genomes analysedWhen comparing the full chloroplast genome of J. vulgaris with all complete Asteraceae chloroplast genomes (including those from G. abyssinica, H. annuus, L. sativa and P. argentatum), a few regions (trnS-trnC and trnE-rpoB) could not be aligned because these regions were absent in P. argentatum, and most other regions showed almost no sequence divergence. Regions that could be aligned and that showed moderate sequence divergence between these five species are listed in Table 2. Five markers (ndhC-trnV, ndhC-atpE, rps18-rpl20, clpP and psbM-trnD) contained parsimony-informative characters higher than 2% and contained equally high phylogenetic information when compared with other phylogenetic markers that are frequently applied among Asteraceae species such as trnL-trnF (6.9%), trnH-psbA (1.7%), rbcL (1.4%), rps16 (0.5%) and ndhF (0.4%). In Fig. 5, the corresponding single MPTs are depicted.

The phylogram called ‘combined regions’ in the middle is derived from MP analysis of all 27 regions together.In a former comparison with H. annuus against L. sativa43 and with H. annuus against G. abyssinica,44 the regions ndhC-trnV and clpP were already identified as divergent regions within the Asteraceae. CIs of the newly discovered phylogenetic markers, indicating homoplasy, of the newly discovered markers were all in the same range as the commonly used markers except for ycf3-trnS and cemA, which had slightly lower values. RI values ranged from 0.52 to 0.83 for the commonly used markers and from 0.50 to 1.00 for the newly discovered markers.Analysis of all 27 regions combined resulted in a congruent topology with high support for all internal nodes. Gene trees can be incongruent with species trees when evolution of genes and species did not occur congruently.10 Gene trees of five regions (trnL-trnF, clpP, psbM-trnD, rps8-rps14 and rps15) were found to be incongruent with the generally inferred species tree of the Asteraceae species analysed (Table 2; Fig. 5).With a length of 150 686 bp, J. vulgaris has the smallest chloroplast genome compared with the four other Asteraceae cp genomes sequenced so far. The length is 2215 bp less than the largest cp genome of P. argentatum. The genome is identical in gene content to H. annuus and L. sativa and differs in gene number with G. abyssinica (which has one gene less) and P. argentatum (which has four genes more). Although the similarity in gene content was high, few non-coding regions showed a high sequence divergence between the five Asteraceae species. A number of regions showing sequence divergence between these species contained a high phylogenetic content compared with the standard applied phylogenetic markers used in the Asteraceae. Those regions seem promising for development of universal primers to further investigate clades in molecular phylogenies of Asteraceae hitherto unresolved. Furthermore, many of these regions are not yet used in angiosperm molecular phylogenetic studies45 and seem worthwhile to investigate further.3.4. Detection of polymorphic lociThe 17 individuals of J. vulgaris yielded a total of 32 SNPs (Table 3), which is on average one SNP per 4705 bp. In 66% of the cases, an SNP allele was found only in a single individual. Fifty-nine per cent of the SNP polymorphisms where substitutions from a purine to a pyrimidine or vice versa. No SNPs were found in tRNAs (Table 4). Within the single-copy region (LSC and SSC), SNPs were almost equally divided over coding DNA (tRNA + exons + genic) (13) and intergenic spacers and introns (19). However, in the coding DNA, on average one SNP every 4573 bp was found compared with one SNP on average for every 2780 bp in intergenic and intron spacers (Table 4). Within the genes, two SNPs were located in introns, this is on average one SNP per 3439 bp compared with one SNP per 4811 bp located in coding gene sequences (genes + exons; Table 4). Of the 13 SNPs found in coding DNA, three resulted in non-synonymous substitutions (Table 3). List of positions and variants of SNPs and microsatellites in the chloroplast genome of J.

All comparisons are made for the single copy region (SCR) and for one IR.Reads derived from the IRs are distributed randomly to IRa or IRb by the assembly software. However, if IRa is different from IRb by an indel or SNP, this would be observed as a polymorphism within an individual. That was, however, never observed as we specifically checked for this. In the one case where we found that the sequence of the IR of individual 11 was deviating from other individuals for four positions, these positions within individual 11 were fully homozygous in both IRa and IRb. All SNPs found in the IRs, 2 × 4 in total, were located in the intergenic spacers of individual 11. The four SNPs found in individual 11 in IRa were found in exactly the same place and the same mutation as in IRb. This suggests ‘concerted evolution’ or gene conversion for the IR region. On average, one SNP in every 1808 bp was found in the intergenic spacers in the IR. For a subset of 11 SNPs, primers were developed (Table 3) and several individuals were genotyped using high-resolution melting. For all these individuals, the SNPs were confirmed.The number of SNPs that were found in this study might be slightly underestimated because the whole cp genome was not mapped with sufficient coverage to detect all SNPs in the 17 individuals analysed. Although the number of synonymous substitutions in chloroplast genes is on average at least three times lower than that of nuclear genes,24 we still found SNPs using chloroplast genomes of 17 individuals of J. vulgaris originating from different populations. We found that SNPs were 1.8 times more frequent in intergenic spacers and introns when compared with DNA coding genes. These findings are in line with the assumption that coding DNA generally evolves more slowly than non-coding regions.30The result that individual 11 has four SNPs in both the IR regions suggests that a mechanism is present that provides simultaneous mutations in both IRa and IRb. In all 17 individuals, the sequences of IRa and IRb did not differ from each other by a single base. The gene Ycf1 starts at the end of IRb and extends into small single copy (SSC) to yield the full Ycf1 sequence. In IRa, the Ycf1 gene starts but is not extended into SSC yielding a non-functional sequence. It suggests that there is a selective force that prevents that the IR regions start to deviate from each other even when all the mutations are located in the intergenic spacer or non-functional genes. As a consequence, the IRs may contribute to the structural stability of the cp genome. Two plant groups, legumes and conifers, lost their IR and comparative sequence studies showed that these chloroplasts experienced a 4-fold increase in silent substitutions compared with chloroplasts containing the IR.46A total of 34 microsatellite regions were found with A/T repeats longer than nine repeats, which is one microsatellite per 4432 bp. Only one microsatellite region was found with 11 G repeats and no repeats of 10 or more Cs were found in the chloroplast genome of J. vulgaris.Within the single-copy region, 5.6 times as much microsatellite regions were found in intergenic spacers and introns compared with coding DNA (28 against 5, respectively). No microsatellites were found in the tRNA and rRNA. We found on average one microsatellite region every 1489 bp in intergenic spacers and introns against 1 of 11 889 bp in coding DNA (Table 4). Within the genes, microsatellite regions were almost equally divided over exons and genes (6) and introns (5). This is on average 1 of 1375 bp for introns against 1 of 96 222 bp for exons and genes (Table 4). This is not in accordance with the data of SNPs where the number of SNPs per base pair was relatively almost the same for exons + genes and introns. An insertion or a deletion in an exon or gene will lead to a frame shift and therefore likely leads to a non-functional protein. Both microsatellite regions and SNPs occur less in DNA coding regions (exons + genes + tRNA) compared with non-coding regions (intergenic spacers + intron). However, this difference is more marked for microsatellite regions than SNPs.Of the 34 microsatellite regions, only one was located on IRb in an intergenic spacer. This is surprising because concerted evolution, as earlier suggested, should lead to exact sequence duplication in IRa compared with IRb, and therefore both IRs should contain the same number of nucleotide repeats. Indeed, we found a microsatellite region at the same place on both IRs, but this repeat was only 8 bp on IRa and is therefore not included in Table 5. For 10 repeat regions, primers were developed and multiple individuals from different populations were genotyped (Table 5). Optimization failed for one primer pair, but the other nine regions were amplified and they were all polymorphic. We tested 93 J. vulgaris individuals in total and found that all were polymorphic with the number of alleles per locus varying from two to six with an average of 3.3 alleles per locus.

The number of variable microsatellites might be higher since we arbitrarily decided to include only mononucleotide repeats that were at least 10 bp long. We found that potential microsatellite regions were 4.7 times more located in intergenic regions and introns compared with coding regions. Because SNPs were only 1.8 times more located in intergenic regions and introns compared with coding regions, we conclude that point mutations are more frequent in coding DNA than indels leading to frame shifts immediately. Although the location of potential microsatellite loci is certain, the repeat length is an approximation. During the long-range PCR and PCR steps in the sample preparation steps for the Illumina platform, indels can occur in microsatellite loci, leading to less or more repeats. Consequently, the Illumina reads for microsatellite loci differed, making it hard to deduce the repeat length. This could also be the explanation for finding a difference in repeat length of a potential microsatellite locus between the IRs.In conclusion, we found promising regions for development of universal primers that can be used for further investigation of clades in molecular phylogenies of Asteraceae. Considering the number of SNPs and microsatellites found in this study, we recommend screening of the complete chloroplast genome to find differences within a species. Despite the higher variation in coverage, using the long-range PCR products as templates for Illumina sequencing seemed to be far more efficient than using cpDNA directly.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.We thank T.

IntroductionA comprehensive genetic linkage map is fundamental to modern plant genetics and breeding because it allows the identification and utilization of agronomic trait loci, such as qualitative and quantitative trait loci, as well as the evaluation of genetic diversity and genomic structure of genetic resources. It also serves as a scaffold for construction of a physical map. In the case of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merrill], a grain legume of global importance, many useful agronomic trait loci associated with growth, product quality, tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses, and other characteristics have been identified in genetic resources and deposited in public databases such as Soybase (http://soybase.org). The first soybean linkage map was constructed on the basis of phenotypic traits,1 but it did not contain sufficient information for application to the above-mentioned purposes. Since the 1990s, various types of molecular markers, including restriction fragment length polymorphism, random amplification of polymorphic DNA, amplified fragment length polymorphism, simple sequence repeat (SSR, or microsatellite), and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers, have been developed and applied to soybean, and enriched marker information has enabled genetic analyses of qualitative and quantitative traits.2–4Among such molecular markers, SSRs in particular have contributed to the construction of a genome-wide linkage map for soybean with a converged linkage group (LG) number equal to the chromosome number. As previously described,5 these microsatellite markers have several advantages, including (i) a codominant manner of inheritance at each locus, (ii) a high level of polymorphism in the form of multiple alleles, (iii) a non-biased distribution in the genome, and (iv) ease of detection of polymorphism by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and subsequent electrophoresis.6–9 It is thus possible to detect allelic differences at highly polymorphic loci among genetic resources as well as among many segregating populations derived from the hybridization of any given genotypes.10–12 Furthermore, given that most PCR primer pairs for SSR markers were designed to yield a single amplification product for each allele in spite of the complex chromosomal structure of soybean,13–15 each SSR marker localizes a definite site in the genome, unlike other molecular markers. These features also allow the simultaneous detection of multiple SSR loci with the use of multiplex PCR analysis.11 In addition, high-throughput and repetitive genotyping can be performed by semiautomated methods with a combination of fluorescently labelled SSR markers.11,12,16 This strategy has been successfully adapted and improved for analysis of genetic diversity and high-throughput mapping in various species, including human,17,18 mouse,19 rat,20 rice,21,22 and sunflower.23 However, in spite of the public availability of many SSR markers for soybean,24 no comprehensive SSR genotyping panel has yet been developed for whole-genome coverage. A high-throughput genotyping system for soybean that is based on an SNP array capable of high multiplexing and which discriminates up to 384 or 1536 mapped SNPs in one reaction has been described.25,26 Although the high multiplexing capacity and continued improvement of the SNP array may make this a standard technique in the foreseeable future, the quantity and quality of SNP loci in soybean are still not sufficient for application of this system to many genotypes. Moreover, the present panel system for SNPs is not sufficiently flexible for modification of marker selection and is not a cost-effective solution.In the latest extensive molecular linkage map, nearly 2000 SSR markers were mapped to the 20 consensus soybean LGs without any large gaps with the exception of one region in LG C1 (chromosome 4).5 In addition, allelic variation at a large number of SSR loci was examined in 23 different soybean genotypes. The availability of this large amount of information prompted us to develop a whole-genome SSR panel for high-throughput genotyping in soybean. We selected SSR markers on the basis of their polymorphism and chromosomal location, and then redesigned them for adaptation to multiplex PCR. The resulting SSR panel system was applied to construct linkage maps of three segregating populations with different genetic backgrounds, and the positions of the redesigned SSR markers were confirmed.2. Materials and methods2.1. Design of a whole-genome SSR panelOn the basis of their positions and polymorphism information content (PIC) values previously described,5,27 we initially selected 322 SSR markers from the mapped SSR loci. The selected markers in principle had a PIC value of >0.5 and were separated from each other by a distance of <20 cM. They consisted of 263 SSR markers developed by USDA-ARS (United States Department of Agriculture, Agriculture Research Service),27,28 15 SSR markers developed by Chiba University,29 and 44 expressed sequence tag (EST)-derived SSR markers developed by Kazusa DNA Research Institute.30 For adaptation to multiplex PCR, most of the primer pairs for the SSR markers developed by USDA were redesigned with the use of the Primer 3 program on the basis of the following parameters: a melting temperature of 50°–60°C (optimum, 55°C); a product size of 80–600 bp; and all other items set to default.31 One of the four different fluorophores (6-FAM, VIC, NED, or PET) was attached to each forward primer, and a 5' tail was added to the reverse primer in order to promote full adenylation (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Each SSR marker was arranged to eliminate overlap with other SSR markers labelled with the same fluorophore in each multiplex set. Details of the markers and primers are provided in Supplementary Table S1.2.2. PCR conditions and SSR fragment detectionPCR was performed in a reaction mixture of 5.5 µl containing 50 nM of each primer, 5 ng of total genomic DNA, and 2.5 µl of 2× Qiagen Multiplex PCR Master Mix (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and with the use of a GeneAmp PCR System 9700 thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems). Total plant DNA was extracted from 10 mg of seed powder with the use of an automated purification system (BioSprint 96 DNA Plant Kit, Qiagen). The amplification protocol comprised an initial denaturation for 15 min at 95°C; 35 cycles of denaturation for 30 s at 95°C, annealing for 90 s at 50°C, and extension for 90 s at 60°C; and a final extension for 30 min at 60°C. A portion (1 µl) of the amplification products was then mixed with 0.3 µl of GeneScan 600 LIZ Size Standard (Applied Biosystems) and 10 µl of Hi-Di Formamide (Applied Biosystems), and the resulting mixture was heated for 3 min at 95°C and then cooled rapidly to 4°C in the thermal cycler. Sizing of SSR fragments was performed with a 3730 DNA Analyzer equipped with POP-7 Polymer and a 36-cm Capillary Array (Applied Biosystems), and allele calling and binning were performed with GeneMapper software v4.0 (Applied Biosystems).2.3. SSR mappingThree mapping populations were used to position fluorescently labelled SSR markers. (i) The JI population, which consists of 94 F2 individuals originating from a cross between the Japanese wild accession JP-36121 and the Japanese landrace Ibarakimame 7. (ii) The OA population, which is derived from a cross between the Japanese cultivar Osuzu and the USA cultivar Athow and comprises 225 F6 recombinant inbred lines (RILs). (iii) The IF population, which consists of 143 F7 RILs derived from a cross between the Japanese landrace Ippon_sangoh and a leading Japanese cultivar, Fukuyutaka. On the basis of allelic information for the SSR markers of the whole-genome SSR panel, individual linkage maps of the three populations were constructed with the use of MAPMAKER/EXP 3.0b.32 Recombination values were converted to genetic distance (cM) with the use of the Kosambi mapping function.33 Each map of the 20 LGs was visualized graphically with MapChart.34 The nomenclature of LGs was as described previously,27 based on the common markers mapped.2.4. Diversity analysis3. Results and discussion3.1. Detail of the designed whole-genome SSR panelA whole-genome SSR panel was designed predominantly on the basis of SSR markers developed by USDA-ARS, since these markers have been well documented.27 The markers were selected according to their map position and polymorphic information.5 However, given that the USDA markers alone did not cover the entire soybean genome with an even distribution, we selected additional SSR markers that were in the public domain. The selected markers were designed according to different strategies and could not be amplified under the same conditions.28–30 In particular, primer pairs for the USDA markers were characterized by a relatively low annealing temperature (~47°C) and the presence of a GCG-clamp near the 5' end of each primer. Most (255 out of 263) of the primer pairs for the USDA SSR markers were therefore redesigned to enhance their suitability for multiplex PCR analysis and to yield PCR products within the detection range of the DNA analyser. All of the 322 fluorescent SSR markers initially constituting the whole-genome SSR panel were individually assessed with the six parents of the three mapping populations as well as with two standard cultivars, Enrei and Williams 82, that have been used for genomic studies in Japan and the USA, respectively. Eighteen SSR primer pairs yielded no amplicons by singleplex PCR with the eight test genotypes (Supplementary Table S1), likely because of the primer modification for multiplex PCR and fluorescence labelling. The remaining 304 primer pairs, which generated unambiguous and stable PCR amplicons, were therefore selected and assembled into 41 multiplex sets of six to eight markers each (Supplementary Table S1). The SSR primer pairs in each multiplex set were assigned one of the four different fluorescent labels (6-FAM, VIC, NED, or PET) in such a manner that no two markers with the same fluorescent dye showed overlap in allele size range. The 304 SSR markers were estimated to cover 2306 cM, or 95%, of the previous integrated linkage map,5 and were separated by an average interval of 7.6 cM (Table 1). Each chromosome (Chr) was covered with 9 (Chr 16) to 21 (Chr 7) SSR makers. There remained a large gap of 35.3 cM between Sat_235 and GMES1325 on Chr 4, but no public SSR markers have been described for this region.5 A gap of 33.9 cM existed between GMES2057 and GMES1693 on Chr 9, because the selected marker Satt539 gave no amplicons. An additional eight regions on different chromosomes showed a gap of >20 cM between proximal markers (Supplementary Table S1). No confident SSR markers were selected in these regions. The longest and shortest average distances between markers were on Chr 4 (9.6 cM) and Chr 7 (5.9 cM), respectively, indicating that the SSR panel was capable of genotyping with a relatively uniform marker density over the entire soybean genome, with only a few exceptions. Assignment of SSR markers designed for the whole-genome SSR panel systemaThe coverage (cM) of the SSR marker loci in each LG is based on information for the previous integrated linkage map.5bCoverage/marker number.Assignment of SSR markers designed for the whole-genome SSR panel systemaThe coverage (cM) of the SSR marker loci in each LG is based on information for the previous integrated linkage map.5bCoverage/marker number.3.2. Genetic mapping of SSR loci in three mapping populationsLinkage analyses were performed with the three mapping populations (JI, OA, and IF) to assess the efficacy of the whole-genome SSR panel. At the same time, we verified whether the fluorescent SSR markers, including those that had been redesigned, were located at the same positions as those originally determined. Among the three populations, the JI population, comprising 94 F2 individuals, was assumed to be diverse at many SSR loci because it was developed from a cross between a wild soybean (JP-36121) and a Japanese landrace (Ibarakimame 7).35 For each multiplex set, the allele products for each SSR locus were readily distinguished from each other as well as from those of the other loci represented (Fig. 1A). One multiplex set built a rough map of Chr 5 (Fig. 1B), whereas the two multiplex sets for Chr 5 made up a linkage frame spanning 142.1 cM with 11 polymorphic markers (Fig. 2). Given that the other three markers selected for Chr 5 in the SSR panel did not exhibit polymorphism between the parents of the JI population, the polymorphic ratio for Chr 5 was calculated at 0.786 (Table 2). This process was applied sequentially to all 20 chromosomes, with the 41 multiplex PCRs achieving genotyping of the 304 SSR markers. All the primer pairs yielded amplicons from at least one of the parents of the JI population, although 55 primer pairs showed no polymorphism between the parents. A linkage map covering 2864 cM was thus constructed from 249 markers with an average interval of 11.5 cM (Fig. 2, Table 2). All of the mapped markers were arranged in the same order and with similar genetic intervals compared with previous studies.5,27–30 Our whole-genome SSR panel thus appears to achieve highly accurate and efficient genotyping with sufficient marker coverage.

A total of 304 SSR marker loci were analysed with the 41 multiplex PCR sets of six to eight primer pairs, resulting in the generation of a linkage map consisting of 249 SSR marker loci covering 2864 cM of the soybean genome.Wild soybeans including JP-36121 are thought to be more genetically diverse than cultivated soybeans, with the result that the genome panel was able effectively to build a linkage map of the JI population. However, molecular linkage maps are frequently constructed from segregating populations with relatively similar genetic backgrounds in order to analyse important agricultural traits such as maturity and yield performance.36 We therefore next applied the SSR genome panel to the analysis of two mapping populations, OA and IF, derived from crosses between soybean cultivars. The polymorphic ratio (0.549) of the IF population, which is derived from Japanese germplasm, was found to be much lower than that (0.819) of the JI population, but it was similar to that (0.615) of the OA population (Table 2). A total of 187 SSR markers showed polymorphism between the Japanese cultivar Osuzu and the US cultivar Athow, which are the parents of the OA RILs, and provided a linkage map covering 2613 cM with an average marker interval of 14.0 cM. The Japanese landrace Ippon_sangoh and the elite Japanese cultivar Fukuyutaka, which are the parents of the IF population of 143 F7 RILs, exhibited allelic variation at 167 SSR loci, and the genotype data for these RILs allowed the construction of a linkage map covering 2470 cM with an average interval of 14.8 cM. The SSR genome panel system thus achieved the construction of linkage maps with sufficient marker coverage in the three mapping populations, and it was less labour-intensive and more rapid than the precedent methods by singleplex PCRs and gel electrophoreses. The molecular linkage maps obtained provide a basis for genetic analysis of specific traits such as deficiency of group A acetylated saponins.35The polymorphic markers were evenly distributed among the 20 LGs, with 201 (66.1%) of the 304 SSR loci being mapped in at least two populations. We thus verified that the SSR genome panel system was well designed to minimize bias of marker location and to include highly polymorphic markers. A total of 21 markers were not polymorphic in the three mapping populations; however, their locations were not confirmed. Although these markers may show polymorphic alleles in other genetic backgrounds, they should possibly be excluded from the genome panel. Many of the markers exhibiting no polymorphism were selected from the EST-derived SSR markers, which were previously found to be less diverse, with fewer alleles, than the USDA SSR markers.5,30 Large marker intervals of >30 cM were observed between Satt634 and Satt600 on Chr 2 and between Sat_039 and Satt663 on Chr 13 in all three mapping populations. The addition of new highly polymorphic markers to these two regions and other relatively sparse regions would enhance the capability of the SSR genome panel system. We are currently in the process of arranging additional SSR markers for these genomic regions based on the recently completed whole-genome sequence of soybean and the abundant SSR motifs identified in the genome.24,373.3. Diversity analysis of 87 soybean genotypes with the whole-genome SSR panelWe next examined allelic diversity of selected SSR markers in 87 soybean genotypes, comprising 8 wild accessions and 79 cultivars, including Japanese elite cultivars, that we had analysed previously.12 From the 304 SSR loci in the whole-genome SSR panel, we selected four markers for each chromosome, to give a total of 80 SSR loci, on the basis of their map position and polymorphism (Supplementary Table S2). The previous analysis by PCR and 3% agarose gel electrophoresis12 revealed that the allele number for the 80 SSR loci ranged from 2 to 7, with an average of 4.0 (Fig. 3A). The most frequent allele number was 3, which accounted for 31.3% of all the marker loci. The PIC value, a measure of allelic diversity at a locus, ranged from 0.12 (Satt568) to 0.80 (Sat_115), and the average PIC value was 0.55 (Fig. 3B). In contrast, in our panel system with the selected 80 SSR marker set, the number of alleles for each locus ranged from 3 (Satt307) to 32 (Satt263), with an average of 14.8, and the PIC value ranged from 0.45 (Satt568) to 0.96 (Sat_115), with a mean of 0.78 for all the marker loci. This level of polymorphism was thus substantially higher than that obtained previously by analysis with agarose or polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis,5,12 likely reflecting the fact that a capillary sequencer is able to determine the size of repetitive motifs with higher resolution and greater accuracy. The mean PIC value and the average allele number obtained in the present study are similar to those determined in previous studies with high-resolution analysis systems, although different diverse materials were used in each study.10,11,38 However, the PIC value and allele number for each SSR locus in the present study did not correlate well with our previous results,12 indicating that allelic diversity at each SSR locus includes small differences that are difficult to determine by 3% agarose gel electrophoresis. The high level of diversity of the SSR loci will allow wide application of the whole-genome SSR panel to detailed genotype identification as well as to mapping phenotypic and quantitative trait loci in various segregating populations.

ConclusionThousands of microsatellite markers in soybean have been developed over the last two decades, with >2000 SSR loci having been integrated into a common linkage map.5,27–30 The abundant and well-documented SSR loci allow the relatively unlimited selection of SSR markers on the basis of their diverse length polymorphism and map location. We selected 304 SSR markers and assembled them into 41 multiplex PCR sets to give a whole-genome SSR panel. This genome panel system has been applied to linkage analysis of >10 segregating populations in addition to the three populations analysed in the present study, and it has successfully built the framework of each linkage map (data not shown). The results indicate the wide applicability of the genome panel system to various combinations of soybean genotypes. The combination of multiplex PCR and the high-resolution detection system is also applicable to other genotyping studies such as marker-assisted selection and the fine mapping of qualitative and quantitative traits. The flexibility of our genome panel system should improve the efficiency of molecular marker genotyping by reducing the labour intensity and time required for this process, although this system requires a fluorescent sequencer and hundreds of custom-labelled primers with fluorescent dye.The recent breakthrough of high multiplexing has moved the SNP array into the mainstream of genotyping technology.39 Many thousands of SNPs have been identified in soybean and have been used to design the GoldenGate assay, which discriminates up to 1536 SNPs in one reaction.4,25,26 On the basis of its high multiplexing capacity, automation, and continued improvement, the SNP array is becoming one of most reliable methods for whole-genome genotyping. However, the quantity and quality of SNP loci in the entire soybean genome are currently not sufficient for application of this system to many genotypes. In addition, the GoldenGate assay is not flexible for modification of SNP marker selection and is expensive for each reaction. Although the multiplex PCR system coupled with high-resolution detection is capable of analysing at most 20 SSR loci at a time, it is possible to combine in a flexible manner the mapped SSR markers and SSR motifs that are scattered throughout the soybean genome.24Supplementary data:Supplementary Data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis research was supported by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries of Japan [Genomics for Agricultural Innovation (DD-3260)].Supplementary data"

IntroductionThe double helix forms the structural basis of semi-conservative DNA replication.1,2 Less intuitively, it also has implications on the information content of DNA for double-stranded DNA as such only has about half the storage capacity of single-stranded DNA. This is because a given sequence and its reverse complement, while the same in the double-stranded form, are different entities in single-stranded DNA—except for those sequences which are identical to their reverse complement. Centrally symmetric when double-stranded, such sequences read the same from either 5' end and are called DNA palindromes (e.g. 5'-GATC-3'). Consider the 44 = 256 different single-stranded sequences of length 4; only the 42 = 16 possible palindromes are unique in the double-stranded form. The remaining 240 form 120 pairs of identical sequences when complemented to the double strands (e.g. 5'-GACT-3' and 5'-AGTC-3'). Thus, the total number of different double-stranded sequences of length 4bp is 120 + 16 = 136. It follows that the generally accepted maximal information content of 2 bit per base pair only holds true if the two sister strands can be distinguished (which requires extra information).Given that palindromes are the only sequences which are unique in double-stranded DNA, it is not surprising that they are of particular importance in genome biology. Dimeric restriction endonucleases and DNA methyltransferases bind palindromic recognition sites.3,4 The same applies to transcription factors such as the bacterial trp repressor5 or the mammalian oestrogen receptor.6 Palindromes also fulfil an important role as spacers in the prokaryotic CRISPR/Cas system (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats), which forms the basis of immune memory against bacteriophages and plasmids.7 Viral and bacterial genomes possess palindromic replication origins.8,9 Palindromes also contribute to genome instability: as target sites for insertion sequence elements10 and for homologous strand invasion during recombination,11 and by inducing double-strand breaks due to hairpin-specific nucleases.12While statistically, palindromes are expected to occur half as often as non-palindromic sequences in double-stranded DNA, they are even rarer than this in natural DNA sequences. Short palindromes were found to be underrepresented in various genomes including bacteriophages,13 bacteria,14–16 and fungi.17,18 In the human genome, palindromes were found to be underrepresented in exons but overrepresented in introns and in upstream regions of genes.19 In bacteria, restriction endonucleases which cleave palindromic DNA recognition sites were proposed as a selective force against palindromes.20 In vertebrate genomes, the underrepresentation of palindromes is partly attributable to the drift of CG dinucleotides to TG by deamination of methylated cytosine.21 Other factors accounting for the scarcity of palindromes in genomic DNA sequences are the potential adverse effects of palindromes on chromatin structure,17 bias of the mismatch repair system,22 and selection against palindromes to avoid inappropriate binding of transcription factors.17 Here, we make use of the large number of available sequenced genomes, scanning them for the occurrence of short palindromes and demonstrating that (i) the underrepresentation of short palindromes is ubiquitous and (ii) the frequency distribution of short palindromes lends itself for species-specific typing of DNA sequences.2. Materials and methods2.1. Genome sequencesGenomic DNA sequences were analysed of 200 species from 10 different phylogenetic groups, 20 species per group: vertebrates, invertebrates, fungi, plants, protozoa, bacteria, archaea, mitochondria, dsDNA viruses, and retroviruses. Complete genomes or chromosomes were analysed if available, otherwise large contigs of at least 100 kb. Twenty was the maximal number of available genome sequences for groups like invertebrates or plants; to be able to compare the variances between the different groups, the number of species per group was therefore fixed to 20 (randomly selected). See Supplementary Table S1 for a complete list of species including accession numbers.2.2. Calculation of palindrome expectancy2.3. Counting of palindromesThe counting of palindromes in DNA sequences (Fasta format) was performed with a Perl script, available on request under the GNU public licence. Input DNA sequences were first rid of all perfect repeats (word size four or longer, repeated in tandem for at least five times) to avoid a possible bias from telomeric or centromeric repeats. Then, the occurrence was counted of each of the 16 different palindromes of length 4 (Table 1). To allow for comparison of variance, the same number of control sequences were included that did not contain any palindromic duplets nor compatible ends (Table 1). Each of these controls was counted alongside its reverse complement to render the result independent of the DNA strand searched. The log2 of the ratios R of occurrence to expectancy for each 4-mer palindrome was plotted as vectors of 16 components, which were clustered by average linkage based on the city-block distance (i.e. the sum of absolute differences in the components of a given pair of vectors). Clustering was performed with the programs Cluster and TreeView23 from the Eisen lab (http://rana.lbl.gov/eisen/). The 16 palindromes of length 4 and an equal number of non-palindromes, their mean ratio R of occurrence to expectancy, and variance of R, across 200 genomesValues significantly deviating from 1 are given in bold (P < 0.01, one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's multiple comparison test).The 16 palindromes of length 4 and an equal number of non-palindromes, their mean ratio R of occurrence to expectancy, and variance of R, across 200 genomesValues significantly deviating from 1 are given in bold (P < 0.01, one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's multiple comparison test).2.4. Random controlsRandom sequences of variable length were generated with the program makenucseq of the EMBOSS package.24 Randomly selected, non-overlapping 10 kb fragments of bacterial genomes were generated with a self-made Perl script using srand(time) as the random number seed.3. Results and discussion3.1. Palindrome occurrence across the tree of lifeWe counted the occurrence of the 16 palindromic words of length 4 (Table 1), along with an equal number of non-palindromic words of length 4 (Table 1), in DNA sequences of selected genomes. Twenty different species were analysed for each of 10 different phylogenetic groups, i.e. the vertebrates, invertebrates, fungi, plants, protozoa, mitochondria, bacteria, archaea, double-stranded DNA viruses, and retroviruses. Perfect repeats were removed from the input sequences to avoid introduction of a trivial bias from regions of extremely low complexity such as telomeric or centromeric repeats. For each input DNA sequence and each 4-mer word, we then calculated the ratio R of actual occurrence of the word divided by the expected number of occurrences, given its GC content and that of the input DNA sequence. Most of the palindromes were underrepresented (R < 1) across all genomes analysed. Overall, the palindromes exhibited a mean R of 0.86, in contrast to a mean R of 1.08 for the non-palindromic controls (Table 1). The underrepresentation of palindromes was most pronounced in vertebrate genomes, plants, double-stranded DNA viruses, and retroviruses (Fig. 1). Contrary to previous reports,20 palindromes were underrepresented even in mitochondrial genomes, demonstrating that the infrequence of palindromes in prokaryote genomes cannot solely be explained by the selective pressure exerted by restriction enzymes. Additional selective forces against palindromes might comprise their impact on DNA structure or their role as transcription factor-binding sites.17 Whatever the underlying forces, short palindromes are underrepresented in all kinds of genomes (Fig. 1). Exactly which palindromes and how strongly depend on the source of the DNA. Interestingly, the inter-genome frequencies of short palindromes exhibit more than twice the variance of the non-palindromic control sequences (22 versus 9%; Table 1), whereas the intra-genome frequencies, e.g. between different chromosomes of the same organism, are uniform (Figs 2–4). This renders short palindromes optimally suited for the typing of DNA. Frequency of palindromes throughout a diverse selection of genomes. Palindrome frequency is expressed as the ratio (R) of occurrence to expectancy. Palindromes are underrepresented (R < 1, dotted line) in all kinds of genomes, most strongly in vertebrates, plants, and viruses, and they exhibit about twice the inter-species variance in frequency (error bars) than non-palindromes.

Note the striking difference between vertebrate and invertebrate DNA.3.2. Clustering of DNA based on palindrome frequencyHere, we represent a given DNA sequence by a vector of 16 numbers: for each of the 16 palindromes of length 4, the log2 of the ratio R of actual to expected frequency (given the GC content of the analysed DNA and that of the palindrome). When such vectors, generated from a diverse selection of DNA sequences, were aligned and hierarchically clustered based on the city-block distance, different DNA sequences of the same species readily grouped together (see Fig. 2 for a representative set of diverse genomes). The clustering worked for all kinds of genome sequences tested—eukaryote, prokaryote, plastid, or virus—but the topology of the resulting tree was not phylogenetically meaningful (Fig. 2). The lack of a large-scale phylogenetic signal was equally apparent from the analysis of the complete set of 200 genomes (Supplementary Fig. S1). The resolution of palindrome frequency clustering would increase further by using the 64 different palindromes of length 6. However, this would also require the input sequences to be longer. On the basis of the random sequences included in Fig. 2, the present approach appeared to work for sequences longer than about 10 kb. To obtain a better estimate on the minimally required size of input DNA, we analysed randomly generated sequences of increasing length (Fig. 3). Above 9 kb, the average variance of R per palindrome dropped below the value obtained for different vertebrate chromosomes (0.025, dashed grey line in Fig. 3). For comparison, the average variance of R per palindrome across human chromosomes was 0.0008 (dotted grey line in Fig. 3), demonstrating again that the variance of palindrome frequency is much lower intra- than inter-genome.Invertebrates exhibiting the smallest inter-genome variance of palindrome frequency (Fig. 1), we chose Caenorhabditis species to challenge its power of discrimination. The complete nuclear genomes of C. briggsae and C. elegans were compared as described above and all the chromosomes were correctly resolved in spite of the weak patterns (Fig. 4A). Clustering based on palindrome frequency also segregated different mammalian chromosomes which, in contrast to invertebrate DNA, showed the characteristic pattern caused by strong underrepresentation of palindromes containing a CG dinucleotide (ACGT, TCGA, CCGG, GCGC, and CGCG; Fig. 4B). This is in agreement with the model that in vertebrates, DNA methylation is restricted to cytosines followed by guanine (CpG), whereas in invertebrates, cytosines are methylated in a wider context.25 Spontaneous mutation of the palindromic CG to the non-palindromic TG by deamination of methylated cytosine thus eliminates short palindromes from vertebrate DNA. The limit of resolution of palindrome frequency clustering was reached with a data set of highly similar sensu stricto yeasts.26 The different chromosomes of the closely related species Saccharomyces cerevisiae, S. bayanus, S. mikatae, and S. kudriavzevii did not segregate perfectly; those of the more distantly related S. castellii did (Fig. 4C).Clustering based on palindrome frequency also worked for prokaryotes, generating species-specific patterns for archaea as well as bacteria. Prokaryote genomes exhibited highly diverse patterns (Supplementary Fig. S1). Natural plasmids of Escherichia coli clearly clustered with the host DNA (Fig. 5A). The same applied to certain dsDNA bacteriophages such as Lambda or P2. However, other dsDNA phages such as T3, as well as all analysed ssDNA phages, did not exhibit the same palindrome frequency patterns as E. coli (Fig. 5A). An interesting picture emerged when comparing human viruses: while all ssRNA minus-strand viruses and the retro-transcribing HIV clustered with human DNA, dsDNA viruses and ssRNA plus-strand viruses did not (Fig. 5B).

Potential application to metagenomicsThe quickly developing field of environmental shotgun sequencing allows metagenomic analyses of communities of microorganisms, the majority of which cannot be cultured in the lab and have therefore remained undetected until recently.27 A key challenge in interpreting environmental shotgun sequencing data is the binning of non-overlapping DNA scaffolds into groups which, ideally, correspond to the different species of microorganisms present.28 Standard methods such as similarity searches to known genomes or phylogenetic analysis of marker genes are of limited use when dealing with DNA fragments sampled from previously undescribed species.28 Di-, tri- and tetra-nucleotide frequencies have been proposed to provide DNA signatures.29–31 Palindrome frequencies carrying a species-specific signal (Figs 2 and 4), the ratios of occurrence to expectancy as applied here may also be useful to bin environmental shotgun sequencing data, provided that the contigs to be analysed are longer than 9 kb (Fig. 3). From the 2007 Sorcerer II Global Ocean Sampling Expedition, which at that time predominantly produced novel sequences,32 the hundred largest contigs, sized between 11 and 59 kb, were analysed as described above. This revealed a diverse picture of palindrome frequency patterns with several major clusters (Supplementary Fig. S2). However, the analysed sequences still did not return high-quality hits when searched with blastn33 against the NCBI non-redundant nucleotide collection, with only one exception of 99% identity to Prochlorococcus phage P-SSM4 (GenBank accession no. AY940168). Thus, it was not possible to assess the benefit of palindrome frequency clustering with this data set. To nevertheless test the potential of the method, we randomly selected 10 non-overlapping fragments of length 10 kb from each of the 20 different bacterial genomes analysed in Fig. 1 (Supplementary Table S1). When these 200 sequences were clustered according to palindrome frequency patterns, over 90% of them correctly assembled according to species of origin.4. ConclusionAccustomed to reading DNA as linear sequences, we tend to forget that it is double-stranded in nature. In double-stranded DNA, the only sequences which are unique are palindromes. Here, we confirm the notion that short palindromes are underrepresented across all different kinds of genomes. The frequency distribution of short palindromes exhibits highest inter-species but low intra-species variance. We take advantage of this to type DNA based on palindrome frequency, generating highly specific patterns which discriminate the DNA from different species, clustering together sequences from the same species. The method allows for the assignment of plasmids and certain viruses to their respective host genomes. Although the underlying selective forces are not fully understood, these patterns are highly useful for analysis of DNA sequences of unknown origin, such as those generated by the gigabase in metagenomic high-throughput sequencing surveys. Palindrome frequency ratios as presented here could be incorporated into more sophisticated classifiers such as self-organizing maps,34 Bayesian classifiers,35 or support vector machines.36 Concentrating on palindromes may help to estimate the diversity of microbial communities and to bin different, non-overlapping sequences originating from the same genome, to classify sequences by comparison to reference patterns, and to assign plasmids and bacteriophages to their respective host genomes.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingWe wish to thank the Swiss National Science Foundation for financial support.Supplementary data"

Without prior information with regard to their hosts, sequences derived from strains isolated from avian or human sources were successfully clustered according to the hosts. Notably, the pandemic H1N1/09 strains have oligonucleotide and codon compositions that are clearly different from those of human seasonal influenza A strains. This enables us to infer future directional changes in the influenza A viral genome.1. IntroductionOne important issue for bioinformatics studies of virus genomes, especially of influenza viruses, is to develop a strategy to predict genome sequence changes that will become hazardous.1–3 The phylogenetic analysis based on sequence homology searches is a well-established and an irreplaceably important method for studying genomic sequences.4,5 However, it inevitably depends on alignments of sequences, which is potentially error-prone and troublesome especially for distantly related sequences. This difficulty becomes increasingly evident as the number of sequences obtained from a wide range of species, including novel species, increases dramatically because of the remarkable progress of the high-throughput DNA sequencing methods. To address the difficulty and complement the sequence homology searches, we previously established an alignment-free clustering method BLSOM (batch-learning self-organizing map)6,7 that can analyse a million sequences simultaneously on the basis of SOM originally developed by Kohonen and his colleagues.8,9 SOM is a powerful unsupervised clustering method that provides an efficient interpretation of complex data, using visualization on one map. Unlike the SOM, the BLSOM depends on neither the data-input order nor the initial conditions, and therefore, is suitable for studying genomic sequences.G + C% has been used for a long period as a fundamental parameter for phylogenetic classification of microbial genomes, including viral genomes, but the G + C% is apparently too simple a parameter to differentiate a wide variety of known microbial genomes. Oligonucleotide composition, on the other hand, can be used to distinguish the species even with the same G + C%, because the oligonucleotide composition varies significantly among the genomes and is called ‘genome signature’.10 When we constructed a BLSOM for oligonucleotide frequencies in fragment sequences (e.g. 10 kb) from a wide variety of microbial species, sequences were clustered (self-organized) according to species. BLSOMs could recognize and visualize species-specific characteristics of oligonucleotide composition.6,7 The alignment-free clustering methods, BLSOM11–13 and SOM,14,15 have been successfully applied to phylogenetic classification of a large number of microbial sequences obtained by metagenome studies of environmental and clinical samples. Here, we have analysed influenza A viruses, including those of the pandemic H1N1/09,16–18 with BLSOM and developed a strategy for predicting directional sequence changes in influenza A viruses. This strategy should be widely applicable for other zoonotic viruses. Introduction of BLSOM into viral genome studies can undoubtedly provide a powerful tool for efficiently extracting profound knowledge from a vast number of viral genomic sequences obtained by high-throughput sequencers currently available.2. Materials and methods2.1. Viral genome sequencesA total of 43 831 virus sequences analysed in Fig. 1A were obtained from the DDBJ Genome Information Broker for Viruses (GIB-V; http://gib-v.genes.nig.ac.jp/),19 and a total of 59 512 segment sequences derived from 7439 influenza A virus strains were obtained from the NCBI Influenza Virus Resource (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/FLU/).20Oligonucleotide-BLSOMs for virus genome sequences.

Batch-learning self-organizing mapSOM is an unsupervised neural network algorithm that implements a characteristic non-linear projection from the high-dimensional space of input data onto a two-dimensional array of weight vectors.8,9 We modified the conventional SOM for genome informatics to make the learning process and resulting map independent of the order of data input, and established a BLSOM.6,7,21 The initial weight vectors were defined by principal component analysis instead of random values. BLSOM learning for oligonucleotide composition was conducted as described previously.6,7 BLSOM learning for synonymous codon usage and visualization of diagnostic codons for the category separation were conducted as described by Kanaya et al.21 BLSOM program was obtained from UNTROD, Inc. (y_wada@nagahama-i-bio.ac.jp).3. Results and discussion3.1. Oligonucleotide BLSOM for all virus genome sequencesTo test the clustering powers of BLSOM for large numbers of sequences from a wide variety of virus genomes, we initially constructed BLSOM with tri- and tetranucleotide frequencies in all 1-kb fragment sequences (ca. 200 000 sequences) from 42 957 virus genomes, which have been compiled and classified into 79 phylogenetic families by DDBJ GIB-V19 (Fig. 1A). Lattice points that contained sequences from one phylogenetic family are indicated in colour, and those that included sequences from more than one family are indicated in black. A major portion was coloured, showing a major portion of sequences to be self-organized according to phylotype; ~80 and 86% of lattice points had sequences from one phylotype on tri- and tetra-BLSOMs, respectively. Notably, no information in regard to phylotype was given during the BLSOM calculation. Tetra-BLSOM for 0.5-kb sequences (ca. 4 000 000 sequences) also showed a clear clustering according to phylotype, with a slight reduction (~5%) in the separation (Fig. 1A); tri-BLSOM for 0.5-kb sequences is presented in Supplementary Fig. S1.3.2. Oligonucleotide BLSOM for influenza A virus genomesWe next analysed influenza A virus sequences available from Influenza Virus Resource20 in NCBI. Influenza A virus genome is composed of eight segments, each of which encodes primarily one protein. Genome sequences from a total of approximately 7400 strains were available even when we focused on strains for which all eight segments were sequenced, and approximately 2300 strains corresponded to the new pandemic H1N1/09. The direct target of natural selection is a virion containing a full set of the eight genome segments, and analyses at the genome level should provide valuable information for characterizing individual strains. Viruses are inevitably dependent on many host factors for their growth (e.g. pools of nucleotides, amino acids and tRNAs), and at the same time have to escape from antiviral host mechanisms such as antibodies, cytotoxic T cells, interferons, and RNA interferences.22–25 Actually, mononucleotide compositions and codon usage biases in influenza A virus genomes were shown to differ between strains isolated from human and avian sources.26,27To clarify the host-dependent characteristics of influenza A virus sequences with BLSOM, di-, tri-, or tetranucleotide frequencies in eight genome segments of virus strains were summed up for each strain, and BLSOM was constructed with the summed frequency for each strain. The merit of the present sequence data set of viral genomes was to include those from the H1N1/09 strains isolated in an early stage of the new pandemic, which was caused by a new virus invasion from other hosts. To specifically study sequence characteristics of the strains isolated in the early stages, we first analysed the data set only including approximately 170 H1N1/09 strains that were isolated from April to May in 2009 (Fig. 1B). Lattice points containing virus strains isolated from one host species were indicated in a colour representing the host and those containing strains isolated from more than one host were in black. Without information with regard to the host during the BLSOM calculation, strains isolated from avian (red) or human (light green) were clustered, forming a large contiguous territory on each BLSOM. This showed host-specific characteristics of oligonucleotide composition and was consistent with the observation of Rabadan et al.2,6 that mononucleotide compositions in influenza A virus genes differed between strains isolated from human and avian sources.Notably, a minor human territory (dark green and indicated by an arrow) appeared, which was separated from the major human territory representing human seasonal strains and surrounded by avian, equine, and swine territories on each BLSOM. This minor human territory was composed of the pandemic H1N1/09 strains, which have resulted from genetic re-assortment between the recently circulating swine H1 viruses in North America and the avian-like swine viruses in Europe.17,18To further investigate human virus subtypes other than the H1N1/09, lattice points that contained human seasonal viruses of one subtype on the tetra-BLSOM (Tetra in Fig. 1B) were specified with one colour representing the subtype (Hum Sub in Fig. 1C). Human seasonal H1N1 (light blue) and H3N2 (dark blue) were clearly separated from each other. In contrast to the compact minor territory of H1N1/09 (dark green, arrowed), human H5N1 strains (red) were rather scattered within the avian territory (achromatic in Hum Sub in Fig. 1C). This should show that these human H5N1 strains jumped to humans but were not able to spread from human to human,24 and therefore, they had characteristics of avian viruses. These human H5N1 strains were more separated from the swine and human territories than H1N1/09 strains, and this difference may relate with their infection power in the human and swine populations.In order to identify avian strains that were located near the swine and human territories, we next marked lattice points containing sequences from one avian subtype by one colour (Avi Sub in Fig. 1C). Avian subtypes were clearly separated from each other. Some avian strains were in closer proximity to human or swine territory than the human H5N1 strains already known (Avi Sub near Hum Sub in Fig. 1C); for example, H5N1 isolated in Russia (red), H6N1 in Taiwan (yellow), H9N2 in Israel (brown), H5N2 in Minnesota (violet), and H7N2 in New York (light blue). These strains should have oligonucleotide compositions more similar to those of human and/or swine viruses than the known human H5N1 strains. This similarity may reflect in part their evolutionary histories, during which the virus themselves or their segments have changed hosts. If so, the similarity is of particular interest with regard to potential infection powers in human and/or swine populations when these strains invade these populations. The finding that the H1N1/09 strains were located in a closer vicinity of both swine and human territories than the H5N1 strains isolated from humans on BLSOM was consistent with this view, although much more data of new pandemics of various subtypes should be needed before proving this view. Even when analysing a large number of strains, BLSOM could effectively visualize and characterize, from various angles, the strains with peculiar characteristics, on which experimental and/or medical research groups will focus their interests. In the present study, strains isolated from various avian hosts (e.g. chicken, duck, mallard and turkey) were grouped into one category. In the near future, a large number of strains isolated from various avian hosts will be sequenced because of importance both in medicine and in chicken and cattle industries, and difference in oligonucleotide composition might be detectable for different avian hosts on BLSOM.In order to clarify an overall feature of the H1N1/09 pandemic, we next investigated the data set including all 2300 H1N1/09 strains available (Fig. 2). Again, host-dependent separation of strains was observed, and 2300 H1N1/09 strains formed a large contiguous territory on all BLSOMs (Fig. 2). This showed that even at the late stage of the 2009 pandemic, H1N1/09 strains had sequence characteristics distinct from human seasonal strains. To analyse possible changes that might occur during this pandemic period, strains isolated in the very early stage (April), the middle stage (August), and the later stage (December) in the 2009 pandemic were separately marked in pink in Fig. 2. In the very early stage (April), a major portion of the strains were located in the vicinity of avian and swine territories, but in the later stage (December), strains near the avian territory became a minority and a major portion moved towards the human territory, indicating directional sequence changes. Dispersion within the H1N1/09 territory for strains isolated at the same pandemic stage appeared to reflect primarily their geographical differences. Oligonucleotide-BLSOMs for all influenza A virus sequences. Di, Tri, or Tetra: BLSOMs were constructed for di-, tri-, or tetranucleotide composition in genome sequences from influenza A viruses including all 2256 H1N1/09 strains (arrowed), and lattice points were coloured as described in Fig. 1B. April, August, or December: lattice points containing the H1N1/09 strains isolated in April, August, or December were coloured in pink in the H1N1/09 territory, and lattice points in the territories other than the H1N1/09 territory were coloured as described in Fig. 1B.Oligonucleotide-BLSOMs for all influenza A virus sequences. Di, Tri, or Tetra: BLSOMs were constructed for di-, tri-, or tetranucleotide composition in genome sequences from influenza A viruses including all 2256 H1N1/09 strains (arrowed), and lattice points were coloured as described in Fig. 1B. April, August, or December: lattice points containing the H1N1/09 strains isolated in April, August, or December were coloured in pink in the H1N1/09 territory, and lattice points in the territories other than the H1N1/09 territory were coloured as described in Fig. 1B.3.3. Host-specific codon biasesSynonymous codon choice sensitively reflects constraints imposed on genome sequences and thus provides a sensitive probe for searching for molecular mechanisms responsible for the constraints, e.g. genome G + C% and tRNA composition in the cases of micro-organisms.28–31 We previously found that BLSOM efficiently detected species-specific codon-choice patterns of micro-organisms, resulting in self-organization of genes according to microbial species.21 Furthermore, in the case of genes horizontally transferred relatively recently, codon choice reflected primarily that of the donor, but not the recipient, genome. We next constructed BLSOM for synonymous codon usage in influenza A virus genes including genes from the H1N1/09 strains isolated in the early stage of the 2009 pandemic (Fig. 3A); in order to know codon biases for each strain, codon usages in eight genes were summed for each strain. Human and avian territories were again clearly separated from each other, and human H1N1/09 strains (arrowed in Fig. 3) were again separated from the major human territory and surrounded by avian, equine, and swine territories. Synonymous codon-choice patterns of newly invading viruses, such as H1N1/09, should be close to those of the original host viruses, at least for a period immediately after the invasion. Codon-BLSOM. (A) Codon: BLSOM was constructed for synonymous codon usage in approximately 34 000 genes from influenza A strains including H1N1/09 isolated in the early stage (April and May), as described by Kanaya et al.,21 and lattice points were indicated in a colour representing the host as described in Fig. 1B. Occurrence levels of seven codons, which were diagnostic for host-specific separation, were indicated with different levels of two colours: pink (high), green (low), and achromatic (intermediate) as described by Kanaya et al.21 Because the synonymous codon usage was analysed, two codons belonging to each two-codon box gave the complementary patterns, and therefore, the pattern of one codon was listed for those belonging to two-codon boxes. (B) Codon: BLSOM was constructed for synonymous codon usage in approximately 60 000 genes from influenza A strains including all H1N1/09strains, and lattice points were indicated in a colour representing the host as described in Fig. 1B. (C) Occurrence levels of four diagnostic codons in the Codon-BLSOM presented in (B) were indicated as described in (A). Scale for the occurrence levels in (A) and (C) was indicated in the colours shown at the bottom of (C). (D) Retrospective time-series changes for human subtype strains (H1N1 and H3N2) on the Codon-BLSOM presented in (A). A zone for H1N1/09 or equine strains was additionally marked for reference to help recognize the position in Codon-BLSOM in Fig. 1A. Each strain was indicated in the colours shown at the bottom of (D).Codon-BLSOM. (A) Codon: BLSOM was constructed for synonymous codon usage in approximately 34 000 genes from influenza A strains including H1N1/09 isolated in the early stage (April and May), as described by Kanaya et al.,21 and lattice points were indicated in a colour representing the host as described in Fig. 1B.

A zone for H1N1/09 or equine strains was additionally marked for reference to help recognize the position in Codon-BLSOM in Fig. 1A. Each strain was indicated in the colours shown at the bottom of (D).Because viruses depend on many cellular factors for their growth, codon choice will most likely shift towards the pattern of seasonal human viruses during many infection cycles among humans. If so, the direction of sequence changes in H1N1/09 in the near future is predictable, and this should be testable because of the high mutation rate and short generation time of influenza A viruses.24,32 By analysing retrospective changes of codon bias of human seasonal H1 and H3 strains isolated before 2006, Wong et al.27 found the overall reduction of G + C% during course of their evolutions. To examine whether the codon choice in H1N1/09 strains also changed even within the 2009 pandemic, we constructed codon-BLSOM in which genes from all 2300 H1N1/09 strains were included and marked strains isolated in the very early stage (April), the middle stage (August), and the later stage (December) separately in pink (Fig. 3B). A major portion of the strains isolated in the very early stage (April) was located in the vicinity of the avian territory but a major portion in the later stage (December) was apart from the avian territory, as found in the tetra-BLSOM (Fig. 2), supporting the directional sequence changes.3.4. Diagnostic codons for host-specific clusteringWe next attempted to identify codons that will change their occurrence levels during the course of the H1N1/09 evolution. BLSOM provides a powerful ability for visualizing diagnostic codons or oligonucleotides that contribute to self-organization of sequences according to hosts.6,7,21 In Fig. 3A, the frequency of each codon in the representative vector at each lattice point was calculated and sorted according to the frequency, and this rank order was represented at different levels in colours pink (high) and green (low) for each codon, as described previously.21 Transitions between the high and low ranks often coincided with host territory borders, and seven examples of the codons diagnostic for host separation were presented (Fig. 3A). Clear difference was observed between human and avian territories for these seven codons. Minor differences in the pattern between codons were observed mainly for swine and equine territories. For example, AAG was preferred in the avian territory but neither in a major portion of the human territory nor in the equine territory, which was specified in yellow in the ‘Codon' panel in Fig. 3A. In the cases of CAG and UUC, these were preferred in both the avian and equine territories, but not in a major portion of the human territory.In Table 1, all diagnostic codons for the separation between human and avian territories were summarized. When we focused on diagnostic codons (Codon in Table 1), one simple tendency was observed. Codons ending with G or C were more favourable for the avian strains than the human strains. This supported the previous observation of codon biases found by Wong et al.27 in their analyses in which individual genes were analysed separately with Corresponding Analysis. Confirmation of the previous finding concerning codon usage with the BLSOM method showed the reliability of this new method. The G + C% effect was most apparent in two-codon boxes (Table 1, Fig. 3A). This was also observed for many codons in four- or six-codon boxes, but there were few exceptional cases, such as codons ‘GCA’ preferred in the avian territory and ‘UUG’ preferred in the human territory (Table 1), indicating the presence of constraints other than the G + C% effect. Preferred codons and oligonucleotides in avian or human virusesTo specify the characteristic codon/oligonucleotide preference in the H1N1/09 strains, codons and oligonucleotides preferred in both H1N1/09 and avian strains are indicated in bold italic letters in the column ‘Preferred in avian viruses’. Similarly, those preferred in seasonal human viruses but not in H1N1/09 are indicated in bold italic letters in the column ‘Preferred in human viruses’.Preferred codons and oligonucleotides in avian or human virusesTo specify the characteristic codon/oligonucleotide preference in the H1N1/09 strains, codons and oligonucleotides preferred in both H1N1/09 and avian strains are indicated in bold italic letters in the column ‘Preferred in avian viruses’. Similarly, those preferred in seasonal human viruses but not in H1N1/09 are indicated in bold italic letters in the column ‘Preferred in human viruses’.Notably, for many diagnostic codons, H1N1/09 strains (arrowed) had the avian-type preference rather than the human-type preference (Fig. 3A). In Table 1, to specify this characteristic codon preference in the H1N1/09 strains, codons preferred in both H1N1/09 and avian strains are indicated in bold italic letters in the column ‘Preferred in avian viruses’, and codons preferred in seasonal human viruses, but not in H1N1/09, are indicated in bold italic letters in the column ‘Preferred in human viruses’. Adaptation of codon choice to a new cellular environment (e.g. host body temperature and cellular factors) may be a process for a newly invading virus to establish continuous and efficient infection cycles among humans by increasing fitness.Next, we analysed diagnostic codons for the host-specific separation found in the codon-BLSOM in Fig. 3B, which included all 2300 H1N1/09 strains, and presented four diagnostic examples in Fig. 3C. Codon preference in the H1N1/09 territory (dark green, arrowed) was again similar to that of the avian territory but not of the human territory, showing that even in the late stage of the 2009 pandemic, the codon bias in the H1N1/09 genes did not reach the level found for a major portion of human seasonal virus genes. Uneven pink and green levels were observed within the H1N1/09 territory, and this presumably represented in part the sequence changes accumulated during the 2009 pandemic.3.5. Diagnostic oligonucleotides for host-specific clusteringTo identify the oligonucleotides that may change their occurrence levels after the present new virus invasion into human populations, we next identified diagnostic oligonucleotides for host-specific separation on the di-, tri-, and tetranucleotide BLSOMs, which were constructed for the data set including only the 170 H1N1/09 strains isolated in the early stage. Three examples of diagnostic dinucleotides for the host-specific separation on the dinucleotide BLSOM (Di in Fig. 1B) are presented in Fig. 4A, seven examples of diagnostic tetranucleotides are presented in Fig. 4B, and seven examples of diagnostic trinucleotides are presented in Supplementary Fig. S2. All diagnostic di-, tri-, and tetranucleotides for the separation between human and avian territories are summarized in Table 1. Two sorts of distinct tendency were immediately apparent: (i) G- and C-rich oligonucleotides were more favourable in avians than in humans. This G + C% effect was previously reported by Rabadan et al.26 (ii) Oligonucleotides containing AG, CG, or GA dinucleotides were more favourable in avians than in humans. The observation about the CG dinucleotide was consistent with the previous finding by Greenbaum et al.33 that human viruses exhibit a lower CG dinucleotide content than avian viruses. Most of diagnostic di- and trinucleotides could be explained by the above two rules, but there were various exceptional cases for tetranucleotides, indicating the presence of factors other than the two rules. For example, as observed in Fig. 4B, GGGG, a tetranucleotide composed only of G, was preferred mainly in the human territory, whereas UCUU, a tetranucleotide rich in U, was preferred mainly in the avian territory. In the case of interaction of viral components with host factors (e.g. host proteins), oligonucleotide compositions, rather than the mononucleotide composition, will become important, because interactions with host factors primarily depend on oligonucleotide sequences. This should also be true in considering escape processes from host antiviral mechanisms. BLSOM for oligonucleotide composition should provide valuable information to experimental studies of adaptation mechanisms, such as interactions between viral and host factors. Diagnostic di- or tetranucleotides for host-specific separation. (A) Di: dinucleotide-BLSOM listed in Fig. 1B. Occurrence levels of three dinucleotides, which were diagnostics for host-specific separation, were indicated with different levels of two colours as described in Fig. 3A. (B) Tetra: tetranucleotide-BLSOM listed in Fig. 1B. Occurrence levels of seven diagnostic tetranucleotides were indicated with different levels of two colours as described in Fig. 3A. Scale for the occurrence levels was indicated in the colours shown at the bottom of this figure.Diagnostic di- or tetranucleotides for host-specific separation. (A) Di: dinucleotide-BLSOM listed in Fig. 1B. Occurrence levels of three dinucleotides, which were diagnostics for host-specific separation, were indicated with different levels of two colours as described in Fig. 3A. (B) Tetra: tetranucleotide-BLSOM listed in Fig. 1B. Occurrence levels of seven diagnostic tetranucleotides were indicated with different levels of two colours as described in Fig. 3A. Scale for the occurrence levels was indicated in the colours shown at the bottom of this figure.Notably again, H1N1/09 strains (arrowed in Fig. 4) have characteristics of avian, rather than of human, strains. In the ‘Preferred in avian viruses’ column in Table 1, oligonucleotides that were preferred in both avian and H1N1/09 strains, but not in human seasonal strains and thus have the potentiality for decrease in H1N1/09 genomes in the near future, are indicated in bold italic letters. Similarly, oligonucleotides that were preferred in human seasonal viruses, but not in H1N1/09 and thus have the potentiality for increase in H1N1/09 genomes in the near future, are indicated in bold italic letters in the ‘Preferred in human viruses’ column. Searches for nucleotide positions in H1N1/09 genomes with the elevated potentiality of directional changes within antigenic sites,1–3 antiviral drug-binding sites34,35 and sites affecting virus growth and virulence24,32 will provide valuable information for predicting possible H1N1/09 descendant sequences that may present potential hazards. Although protein sequences evolve undoubtedly under the selection on protein sequence, consideration at the nucleotide sequence level is also important. For example, when a certain nucleotide position with an elevated potentiality of the directional changes is the position responsible for coding the amino acid in a certain antigenic site, the probability of this amino acid change is expected to be higher than that for other amino acids in this or other antigenic sites. Additionally, if a certain H1N1/09 strain isolated in a certain geographical area has, in an antiviral drug-binding site, an oligonucleotide with the elevated potentiality of the directional changes, the strains and the area may be counted as a potentially hazardous strain and area. This type of information obtained by informatics methods will become increasingly important in accord with the increase of nucleotide sequences obtained from a wide variety of virus strains.3.6. Retrospective time-series changes visualized for human virusesInvader viruses will change their sequences on balance between a stochastic process of mutation and selection pressure derived from various constraints, including constraints from hosts. As a model case to study the virus evolution after changing hosts, the 2009 pandemic was very informative because genomes of a large number of strains isolated in various stages, including those isolated in the very early stage, were sequenced. The finding that even in the late stage in the 2009 pandemic the H1N1/09 strains had the characteristics appreciably distinct from human seasonal viruses (Figs. 2 and 3B) indicated that the sequence changes had not reached the presumable equilibrium state, which represented the sequence characteristics common among human seasonal strains. It will take a more extended period to reach the hypothesized equilibrium. Actually, by analysing retrospective changes of codon biases of human seasonal H1 and H3 strains isolated from 1918 to 2006, Wong et al.27 found the overall reduction of G + C% during the course of their evolutions with Corresponding Analysis. We thus examined whether BLSOM could detect the retrospective long-period changes in codon biases in human seasonal H1 and H3 strains. On the codon-BLSOM listed in Fig. 3A, human H1N1 or H3N2 strains that were isolated in the five different periods were separately coloured in light or dark blue for H1N1 or H3N2 strains, respectively (Fig. 3D). Strains isolated before 1975 (shown in the panel ‘–1974’) were located around the border between the human and avian territories, and pandemic descendants (shown in the panels specifying the time period) moved apart from the avian territory (achromatic in Fig. 3D). If human viruses had changed their sequences solely by stochastic processes, pandemic descendants should move primarily in a non-directional way from year to year. Absence of such non-directional movements indicated a directional pressure during the course of establishment of human seasonal strains after the onset of their new pandemics. This finding also showed that BLSOM had a power to visualize evolutionary histories of various subtype viruses, and more importantly to visualize any categories of strains, in which experimental and medical groups will be interested.3.7. Segments separately analysedAt the onset of a new pandemic, re-assortment of virus genome segments in a certain host (e.g. swine) and successive invasion of the new re-assortant into the human population were often essential.17,18,24,32 Therefore, we next analysed sequences of eight segments separately, which were derived from approximately 5300 strains including 170 H1N1/09 strains isolated in the early stage. The length of the shortest segment (segment 8) is approximately 0.8 kb, and therefore, enough clustering power can be expected as already shown in Fig. 1A. Tetra-BLSOMs for eight segments are presented separately in Fig. 5A; clear clustering of sequences according to host was observed for all segments, and this was true also for di-, tri-, and codon-BLSOMs (data not shown). Segment 2 of H1N1/09 was in close proximity to the human territory, but some other segments (e.g. segments 1 and 3) were within the avian territory. This similarity of the oligonucleotide composition of H1N1/09 with that of human, swine, or avian viruses was consistent with the findings obtained by conventional phylogenetic studies.17,18 For example, segment 1 in H1N1/09 was shown to be derived originally from avian strains in the phylogenetic studies, and sequences of segment 1 in the H1N1/09 strains isolated in the early stage were located within the avian territory on BLSOM (Fig. 5A), supporting their evolutionary origin disclosed previously by the phylogenetic studies. During the course of the H1N1/09 evolution, sequence characteristics in segment 1 may have changed towards the characteristics of seasonal human viruses in order to adapt to the new host cellular environments, and this will be examined in the last part of this paper. Sequences of segment 2, which was evolutionarily derived from human strains, were located between human and avian territories, again supporting their evolutionary origin. Tetra-BLSOMs for eight genome segments derived from human, avian, and swine viruses. (A) Gene product name was listed along with the segment number. Lattice points were indicated in colours representing the hosts, as described in Fig. 1B, and thus a zone for H1N1/09 was in dark green. (B) Examples of avian strains whose segments were located in close proximity to human and/or swine segments were marked in light green or blue to specify the geographical areas where the subtype strains were isolated: segment 2 of H7N2 strains and segment 4 of H5N2 strains that were isolated in New York (NY), segment 4 of H5N2 strains isolated in Minnesota (MN), H6N1 for segment 6 isolated in Taiwan and Hong Kong (HK), and segment 6 of H9N2 strains isolated in Wisconsin (WI) and Hong Kong (HK). Segments of other avian strains were in red and segments from other hosts were achromatic, but a zone for H1N1/09 was marked in dark green for reference to help recognize the position in (A).Tetra-BLSOMs for eight genome segments derived from human, avian, and swine viruses.

Segments of other avian strains were in red and segments from other hosts were achromatic, but a zone for H1N1/09 was marked in dark green for reference to help recognize the position in (A).Importantly, approximately 5300 sequences were effectively characterized and visualized on one map, supporting efficient knowledge discovery such as those described in what follows. In Fig. 1C (Avi Sub near Hum Sub), we present examples of avian subtype strains that were in close proximity to human and/or swine territories for four subtypes, along with the geographical information of places where the subtype strains were isolated. This provided the information of their similarity at a strain level, potentially unveiling their evolutionary histories at a strain level. In contrast, BLSOM analyses of individual segments presented in Fig. 5A may provide evolutionary histories at a segment level. Visualization and identification of avian- or swine-virus segments whose oligonucleotide and codon compositions were closely related to those of humans should be valuable for predicting candidate strains that may cause pandemics among humans after segment re-assortment. For example, by summarizing potentially hazardous segments, we may specify avian strains that will come to resemble the human or swine strains with re-assortment of only a few segments. This type of information should be very valuable for gaining new perspectives on systematic surveillance of viruses presenting potential hazards. By analysing a large number of virus sequences collectively, BLSOM can efficiently discern such hazardous segments and strains on the basis of its strong visualization power.Identification of codons or oligonucleotides that are preferred in individual hosts (Table 1) may also provide novel information to aid the design of vaccine candidate strains with high growth rates for supporting high-yield vaccine production and/or the design of generation of recombinant influenza viruses containing various mutations in their genes,36 which will stably be maintained through infection cycles by avoiding unfavourable codons and oligonucleotides.3.8. Confirmation of sequence changes on a basis of sequence homology searchesTo further test the feasibility of the present strategy for predicting directional changes in H1N1/09 sequences, we compared the gene sequences of the strain that was isolated in the very early stage of the pandemic (California/04/2009) with the sequences from approximately 100 H1N1/09 strains that were isolated in the latest stage of the 2009 pandemic (after 1 December 2009). As observed in time-series changes on oligonucleotide- and codon-BLSOMs in Figs. 2 and 3B, a significant level of sequence changes appeared to have accumulated in the H1N1/09 strains during the course of the 2009 pandemic. Next, we analysed base changes at a gene sequence level after alignment with BLAST search, by focusing only on protein-coding sequences because one purpose of the analysis was to recognize changes in codon usage. Furthermore, the exclusion of UTR sequences enabled us to avoid mistakes and/or uncertainties with regard to sequence alignments, which increased significantly for UTR sequences. For each gene of the 100 strains isolated at the latest stage in the 2009 pandemic, nucleotide positions where the base was changed from the sequence of the very early isolated strain were searched for. Then, by keeping focus on the base-changed positions, the number of the codons or oligonucleotides indicated in bold italic letters in the ‘Preferred in avian viruses’ column in Table 1 (i.e. codons or oligonucleotides predicted to decrees in the near future) that were actually lost or gained in each strain isolated in the latest stage was calculated and summed for the 100 strains (Dec or Inc in Table 2). In this summation, the same mutation found for more than one strain was treated as one change, because it was uncertain whether this base change occurred independently. The number of the lost codons or oligonucleotides of attention exceeded generically the number of those gained (Table 2) (red vertical bars in Fig. 6), supporting the view that the unfavourable codons or oligonucleotides predicted with BLSOM analyses actually had a higher tendency to be lost at the gene sequence level. Notably, this tendency differed among segments. For example, the tendency was evident in segment 1 harbouring PB2 gene (Fig. 6): approximately two times more losses than gains in total (97/185: Inc/Dec in Table 2). It should be mentioned that the PB2 of the H1N1/09 was derived from an avian virus.17,18 In the case of the segment-2-harbouring PB1gene, which was originally derived from the human seasonal virus, the tendency was less evident and slightly reversed (Fig. 6) (147/139 in Table 2), suggesting that a large portion of the base changes observed in this gene might represent non-directional, stochastic mutation processes.

The ratios ‘Inc/Dec’ for Sum (summation of di-, tri-, and tetranucleotides and codons) in Tables 2 and 3 were shown in red and green, respectively.Sequence changes observed in the strains isolated in the latest stage in the 2009 pandemic from an H1N1/09 strain isolated in a very early stage.

In this case, the number of the gained codons or oligonucleotides exceeded the number of those lost (green vertical bars in Fig. 6), supporting the view that the favourable codons or oligonucleotides predicted with BLSOM were actually favourable for growth in human cellular environments. The tendency again differed among segments, and this was evident in segments 1, 6, and 7 but less evident in segment 2 (Table 3) (Fig. 6). General trend of the difference among segments was similar with that observed in Table 2, but the direction was reversed. Although one important factor contributing to the difference among segments appeared to be due to the difference in their evolutionary histories, there should exist other factors which are related to adaptation mechanisms of an invader virus in a new host. For example, the high level of losses of unfavourable codons and oligonucleotides and of gains of favourable codons and oligonucleotides in segment 1 suggests a possibility that the PB2 protein and/or RNA of the invader viruses may feel foreign in the human cellular environment because of its interaction with various host cellular factors.25,32,33,37 Detailed inspection of differences among genes may provide information about molecular mechanisms of adaptation processes in a new host, and therefore, additional information useful for predicting sequence changes which will occur in the invader virus genome in the near future. Effects of these predicted sequence changes on protein functions, including bindings with antiviral drugs and antibodies, can be studied in detail.

IntroductionPhosphorylation is a reversible post-translational modification of proteins, and, in many cases, substrate proteins are involved in signal transduction in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. Protein kinases transfer phosphate groups, mostly from ATP, to proteins, with resultant changes in the enzymatic activities and/or properties of the substrate proteins. Prokaryotes widely employ two-component regulatory systems composed of histidine kinase and its cognate response regulator to control various regulatory functions that require fine-tuning of gene expression.1,2 Most protein kinases in eukaryotes are tyrosine or serine/threonine protein kinases (2.7.1.37; the latter are abbreviated as STPKs). They catalyse phosphorylation of the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine residues of their substrate proteins.3 All STPKs analysed to date include a conserved domain of 250–300 amino acids, which binds first to ATP (and, in very few cases, like casein kinase 2, to GTP) and then binds to a substrate protein for transfer of the phosphate group derived from ATP (GTP) to the substrate protein.3The complete sequences of the genomes of Arabidopsis thaliana, rice, human, and rat reveal the presence of hundreds of genes for STPKs. Homologues of eukaryotic-like STPKs have been found in many bacterial species.4–6 For example, Bacillus subtilis has three and Mycobacterium tuberculosis has 11 genes for STPKs. Myxococcus xanthus carries nearly 100 genes for eukaryotic-like STPKs.5 In contrast, Escherichia coli has no such genes; however, Ser/Thr protein kinase activity was found in E. coli cells.7 Substrate proteins for Ser/Thr phosphorylation were identified in E. coli by phosphoproteomics,8 and the protein YihE, which has no homology to eukaryotic STPKs, but possesses Ser/Thr protein kinase activity, has been identified and crystallized.9In bacteria, STPKs are involved in central metabolism and regulate the activity of enzymes such as enolase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, inorganic pyrophosphatase, cell division proteins, FtsZ, and others,10 or globally control the gene expression.11,12 Usually, mutation of genes that encode STPKs in bacteria leads to multiple changes in overall metabolism and/or gene expression, and identification of the original targets for Ser/Thr phosphorylation is not easy.Among cyanobacteria, unicellular freshwater Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (hereafter abbreviated as Synechocystis) has 12 genes for putative STPKs,13–15 whereas filamentous nitrogen-fixing Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 has 52 such genes.16,17 Zhang18 demonstrated that one of these genes in Anabaena, pknA, is essential for normal cell growth and the differentiation of heterocysts. Another STPK, Pkn22, is involved in the acclimation of Anabaena cells to iron starvation and oxidative stress, and it regulates the expression of the isiA gene for chlorophyll-binding CP43' protein.19Of the 12 putative genes for Ser/Thr kinases in Synechocystis, seven of these genes encode proteins that belong to the PKN2 subfamily of STPKs and five encode proteins that belong to the ABC1 subfamily.15,20 The genes for kinases of the PKN2 type are designated spkA, spkB, spkC, spkD, spkE, spkF, and spkG and those for kinases of the ABC1 type are designated spkH, spkI, spkJ, spkK, and spkL (http://genome.kazusa.or.jp/cyanobase/). The spkA21,22 and spkB23 genes appear to encode proteins that participate in the formation of thick pili and the control of cell motility, whereas the spkC gene encodes a kinase that was reported to be involved in the regulation of nitrogen metabolism.24 The involvement of SpkE in the control of cell motility has been proposed but not yet confirmed.25 Until today, the protein substrates, which are the targets for Ser/Thr phosphorylation in Synechocystis, have not yet been identified.In this study, we identified several proteins that change the extent of their Ser/Thr phosphorylation upon heat stress. GroES co-chaperonin was one of the targets for such phosphorylation. Here we introduced mutations into 11 genes for STPKs, from spkB to spkL. The phenotype of the mutation in spkA has been described earlier by Panichkin et al.22 Analysis of their capacity to phosphorylate the externally provided GroES demonstrated the involvement of three STPKs into phosphorylation of this co-chaperonin in Synechocystis. Inactivation of either spkC, spkF, or spkK, leads to inability of cells to phosphorylate GroES, suggesting the existence of a regulatory circuit or cascade, in which these three STPKs interact with each other.2. Materials and methods2.1. Strains and culture conditionsSynechocystis sp. PCC 6803, a glucose-sensitive strain (GS), was obtained from Department of Genetics, Moscow State University.26 It served as a wild-type strain for construction of the gene knock-out library of individual spk genes. This strain already possesses a spontaneous frame-shift mutation in the spkA gene.21 All cyanobacterial cells were grown in a liquid or on agar-solidified BG11 medium27 that had been buffered to pH 7.6 with 20 mM HEPES-NaOH. Cells in 50 ml liquid cultures were grown photoautotrophically in 100 ml glass tubes in a water bath at 32°C with continuous illumination at 50 µmol photons m-2 s-1, which was provided by incandescent lamps, and with continuous bubbling with air that contained 1% CO2 (v/v) (hereafter referred to as normal growth conditions). The concentration of cells in liquid cultures was estimated from the optical density at 750 nm (A750), as determined with a spectrophotometer (Genesis 10UV; Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA). Cultures for experiments were inoculated with cells from liquid precultures at a concentration of cells that corresponded to A750 = 0.1 and were grown under normal growth conditions. Cells at a density that corresponded to A750 = 0.4–0.6 were used for analysis. Mutant strains were maintained on a agar-solidified or liquid medium that contained 50 µg ml-1 kanamycin, 1 µg ml-1 gentamycin, 20 µg ml-1 chloramphenicol, or 20 µg ml-1 spectinomycin, as appropriate. No antibiotics were added to the final cultures used for analysis to avoid the possibility of phenotypic changes due to the presence of an antibiotic.For heat-shock experiments, both GS and mutant cultures were withdrawn form 32°C and placed to 44°C and incubated at the same light intensity for 30 min. After treatment, the cells were collected by centrifugation (5000g, 10 min, 4°C), washed twice with 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.6), 10 mM MgCl2, and washed pellets were used immediately for protein isolation.Competent cells of E. coli strains JM109, DH5a, or BL21 (DE3 pLysS) were obtained with the standard CaCl2 protocol28 and were used for the cloning and isolation of plasmids. Cells were grown overnight at 37°C in Luria–Bertani medium supplemented with 50 µg ml-1 ampicillin.2.2. Construction of the plasmid library of mutated genes for Ser/Thr kinasesPartial sequences of individual spk genes have been amplified by PCR with the primers listed in Supplementary Table S1. The amplified DNA fragments were ligated into pGEM®-T or pGEM®-T Easy (Promega Inc., Madison, WI, USA), or into pT7Blue-T, or pUC18.29 Antibiotic-resistance gene cassettes,30–33 a transposon EZ::TN™ <KAN-2> (Epicentre, Madison, WI, USA), or pGPS2.1 (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA, USA) have been inserted into the cloned DNA fragments. Each of the resultant plasmids was used for transformation of Synechocystis cells. The transformed cells were selected on a agar-solidified BG11 medium that had been supplemented with an appropriate antibiotic, as described by Grigorieva and Shestakov.26 Each cyanobacterial cell contains several copies of the cyanobacterial chromosome.34,35 In order to mutate every copy of the chromosome, we transferred the transformed cells to several plates of the agar-solidified BG11 medium with increasing concentrations of the antibiotic. We confirmed the complete replacement of native copies of the chromosome by mutated copies by amplification by PCR (Supplementary Fig. S1) with the pairs of primers listed in Supplementary Table S2. Positions of insertions are shown in Fig. 1. A schematic representation of the mutation of individual spk genes in Synechocystis by insertion of antibiotic-resistance gene cassettes. Open arrows represent the open reading frames (ORFs). Shaded arrows represent the target spk genes. Small black triangles indicate sites for binding of primers (see Supplementary Table S2) and directions of elongation of primers.

Construction of the <U+0394>hrcA (<U+0394>sll1670) mutantSynechocystis sp. PCC 6803, a GS, was used for disruption of the hrcA (sll1670) gene that encodes a transcription factor, which negatively controls transcription of some heat stress genes.36 The complete nucleotide sequence of the hrcA gene36 was amplified with forward (5'-TTGGACTGGAATTCTAAGATG) and reverse (5'-TTAATTTTTGCTCAATGCTTCCG) primers, agarose-purified, and cloned into pT7-Blue. The HincII Kmr-cassette derived from pUC4K30 was inserted into blunted Eco91I site of the hrcA to substitute a part of a gene (positions from 223 to 939 of the gene sequence). Complete segregation of the mutated chromosomes was confirmed by PCR with the primers described above.2.4. Complementation of mutations in spkC, spkF, and spkK genesThe spkC, spkF, and spkK genes together with their upstream regions were amplified with Pfu DNA polymerase (Fermentas) from the genomic DNA of Synechocystis GS with synthetic nucleotides (Supplementary Table S3) used as primers for PCR. The amplified DNA fragments, which contained the spkF and spkK, were ligated into the SmaI site of pVZ321.37 The amplified DNA fragment that contained the spkC was ligated into the EcoRI site of pVZ321 blunted with Klenow exo- enzyme. Mutant cells of Synechocystis GS defective in spkC, spkF, and spkK genes were transformed with recombinant pVZ-spkC, pVZ-spkF, and pVZ-spkK plasmids, respectively. The clones that carried the spkF and spkK genes were selected on spectinomycin (30 µg ml-1) and chloramphenicol (5 µg ml-1). The clones that carried the spkC gene were selected on kanamycin (10 µg ml-1) and chloramphenicol (12.5 µg ml-1).2.5. Other manipulations of DNADNA was isolated from Synechocystis cells with lysozyme and purified with chloroform as described previously.37 Restriction analysis with restriction enzymes (Fermentas), isolation of plasmids, transformation of E. coli, and ligation of DNA fragments were performed by standard methods.272.6. Protein isolationAll chemicals were purchased from Sigma. All procedures were carried out at 4°C. To isolate the soluble protein fraction, the cell pellets were suspended in ice-cold buffer which contained 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.6), 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM EGTA, 2 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM benzamidine, 10 mM NaF, 50 mM ß-glycerophosphate, and 250 mM sucrose. Disruption was achieved using French Press (2.8 MPa; SLM, American Instruments Co., Urbana, IL, USA). The crude extracts were centrifuged stepwise, first at 7500g to remove unbroken cells and afterwards at 16000g for 20 min. The final supernatants were transferred into an appropriate buffer by gel filtration on NAP-5 columns (GE Healthcare) and used for biochemical assays. Protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay.2.7. Protein phosphorylation in vitro and 2D PAGEProtein phosphorylation in vitro was performed in a mixture that contained 20 mM MES-KOH (pH 6.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 10 µM ATP, and 740 kBq [<U+03B3>-32P]ATP (148 TBq mmol-1). The reaction was initiated by the addition of 50 µg protein and allowed to proceed for 15 min at 30°C. After labelling, the proteins were precipitated at –20°C with 80% (v/v) acetone in the presence of 15% TCA and 1% 2-mercaptoethanol and pelleted by centrifugation. The pellets were washed twice with 80% (v/v) acetone.Labelled proteins were dissolved in rehydration buffer (130 µl) contained 6 M urea, 1.5 M thiourea, 3% CHAPS, 66 mM DTT, 0.2% Bio-Lytes (pH 3–10, Bio-Rad), and traces of bromophenol blue. The samples (125 µl each) were loaded on IPG strips (7 cm, pH 4–7; ReadyStrips, Bio-Rad) for passive rehydration at 20°C for 12 h. The strips were then run using a Bio-Rad Protean IEF Cell at 20°C as follows: 200 V constant voltage for 15 min, 500 V constant voltage for 15 min, linear increase up to 1000 V for 30 min, low increase up to 5000 V for 30 min, and 5000 V constant voltage until a total of 10 000 V h-1 was reached. After IEF, the strips were equilibrated for 15 min with the buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.8, 6 M urea, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS) containing 10 mg ml-1 DTT followed by equilibration for 15 min with the same buffer, which contained 25 mg ml-1 iodoacetamide instead of DTT. The strips were then placed on the top of 12.5% polyacrylamide mini gels (0.75 mm thick) and subjected to SDS–PAGE at 200 V in a Bio-Rad MiniProtean III. After electrophoresis, the gels were fixed in 50% methanol with 3% phosphoric acid to remove the phosphate groups associated with His residues. After acidic treatment, the gels were stained with colloidal CBB G-250, dried, and subjected to autoradiography on a Kodak Biomax MR film.The resultant autoradiographs were aligned with the corresponding images of the CBB G-250-stained gels using Image Quant 5.2 (Molecular Dynamics) gel analysis software. Selected protein spots were excised, digested in-gel with trypsin, and subsequently analysed by MALDI-TOF-MS at the service centre of Postgenomic Technology at the Institute of Biomedical Chemistry (Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, Moscow, Russia).2.8. Western blottingAfter 2DE separation, phosphoproteins were transferred onto 45 µm nitrocellulose filters (Hybond-C Extra) for western blotting using a Trans-Blot SD Electrophoretic Semi-Dry Transfer Cell (Bio-Rad) at 0.8 mA cm-2 for 2 h at room temperature. Air-dried membranes were subjected to autoradiography on Kodak Biomax MR films. After exposure to X-ray films, nitrocellulose blots were treated with rabbit antisera that had been raised against a mixture of Hsp60s (homologous GroEL and Cpn60) of Synechococcus vulcanus.38 Protein bands were visualized with secondary antibodies coupled with horseradish peroxidase.Phosphoserines and phosphothreonines have been determined with the corresponding anti-P-Ser and anti-P-Thr monoclonal antibodies produced in mouse purchased form Sigma-Aldrich (Product Nos P 3430 and P 3555 with dilution of 1:1000 and 1:500, respectively). Anti-mouse secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and raised in rabbits have been used for visualization.2.9. Expression and purification of the recombinant GroESThe recombinant GroES protein was expressed in the E. coli strain BL21(DE3 pLysS) harbouring the recombinant plasmid pET22b(+) (Novagen) with His-tagged groES. A DNA fragment carrying the groES gene was amplified from the genomic DNA of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 by PCR using synthetic oligonucleotides (5'-CATATGGCCGCTATTTCC and 5'-CTCGAGGGCAACGGAGGC) as forward and reverse primers, respectively. The amplified DNA fragment was digested with NdeI and XhoI restriction endonucleases and cloned into the corresponding sites of the pET22b(+). The resultant plasmid, pET-groES, was used for transformation of E. coli cells. The transformed cells were grown in LB-medium until the OD750 of suspension reached 0.5. Overproduction of the recombinant protein was initiated by the addition of isopropyl thio-ß-d-galactoside to a final concentration of 1 mM and continued for 3 h at 37°C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, disrupted by French Press, and the expressed protein was purified from the soluble fraction by affinity chromatography on a Ni2+-resin with a Protino® Ni-IDA Kit (Macherey-Nagel Gmbh & Co, Düren, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Alternatively, the recombinant GroES was purified by FPLC on a Mono Q column (GE Healthcare). Expression and purification protein profiles are shown in Supplementary Fig. S2.2.10. Ser/Thr protein kinase assay on GroESSupernatant protein factions (5–10 µg of protein), obtained from Synechocystis wild-type and its 11 mutant (<U+0394>spkB-L) cells, were incubated with purified GroES (0.04 mg ml-1) for 15 min at 30°C in a final volume of 25 µl of buffer that contained 20 mM MES-KOH (pH 6.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 10 nM ATP, and 74 kBq [<U+03B3>-32P]ATP (148 TBq mmol-1). The reaction was terminated by adding half of the reaction volume of three times concentrated Laemmli SDS sample buffer,27 and samples were boiled for 5 min. Phosphorylated GroES was resolved using 18% SDS–PAGE, stained with CBB R-250 in 40% (v/v) methanol with 10% (v/v) acetic acid, dried, and autoradiographed as described above. The same kinase assay was performed with the protein fractions obtained from the Synechocystis mutants defective in spkC, spkF, and spkK, which have been complemented with the pVz-spkC, pVZ-spkF, and pVZ-spkK, respectively.2.11. pH-dependence of the phosphorylation of the GroES protein in vitroProteins were isolated from control and heat-stressed wild-type cells and phosphorylated with [<U+03B3>-32P]ATP. Phosphorylated proteins were loaded on a 15% SDS–PAGE and blotted onto the PVDF membrane after electrophoresis. The membrane was then stained with Ponceau red, and the portion of the membrane containing the GroES was incubated at a different pH in the following buffers: 50 mM KCl (pH 1.0), 0.1 M Tris–HCl (pH 7.0), and 1 M KOH (pH 14.0). After incubation for 2 h at 45°C, membranes were washed thoroughly with deionized water, air dried, and exposed onto a Kodak X-ray film.3. Results and discussion3.1. Complete replacement of wild-type copies of individual spk genes by mutated copiesWe inactivated 11 spk genes (spkB through spkL) in the GS strain of Synechocystis by insertional mutations (Fig. 1). In the GS strain, the spkA gene has already been inactivated by a frame-shift mutation. Therefore, we previously mutated the spkA gene in the Pasteur strain, in which the spkA gene is intact and the corresponding kinase is active.21We examined the extent of replacement of wild-type copies of individual genes after each mutagenesis by PCR, using DNA isolated from wild-type and mutant cells as templates and appropriate forward and reverse primers (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table S2). Analysis of each mutant (Supplementary Fig. S1) confirmed that the PCR-amplified fragment from mutant's DNA was longer than that amplified from the wild-type genomic DNA. The increase in the length of PCR-amplified fragments in the mutants was due to the insertion of the antibiotic-resistance gene cassette, except the spkF::Spr and spkH::Spr mutants, where both insertion and deletion occurred (Fig. 1). No mutant cells yielded an amplified fragment of the same length as the parental wild-type gene (Supplementary Fig. S1). This fact indicates that there were no copies of the respective wild-type genes in any of the 11 mutants.Phenotype of all mutants was similar to wild-type cells in terms of size, colour, and the shape of colonies during cultivation on solid medium and in terms of the growth rate in liquid bubbling cultures under standard growth conditions.3.2. Ser/Thr phosphorylation of the soluble proteins in relation to high temperature treatmentPhosphorylation of proteins catalysed by the sensory histidine kinases and STPKs is the key regulatory mechanism that ensures the perception and transmission of the intracellular and intercellular signals in eukaryotic39 and prokaryotic cells.40 The evidence exists that typical prokaryotic two-component signalling systems may work in cooperation with eukaryotic-like STPKs.6 In Synechocystis, sensory histidine kinase Hik34 is a repressor of heat-shock genes at normal growth temperatures.41 The involvement of STPKs into temperature signal transduction pathways was not yet demonstrated.Here we tried to visualize the substrates of Ser/Thr phosphorylation in Synechocystis upon a rise in temperature. Cells that have been grown at 32°C were subjected to high temperature treatment (44°C) for 30 min. The influence of heat stress on Ser/Thr protein phosphorylation has been studied in soluble protein fractions using in vitro phosphorylation technique (see Experimental procedures). It is generally accepted that phospho-Ser/phospho-Thr are stable at low pH but labile at alkaline conditions. On the contrary, phospho-His is both acidic and heat labile. PAGs have been fixed in a 50% methanol in the presence of 3% phosphoric acid to remove the phosphate groups associated with His residues. Therefore, we are confident that under phosphorylation conditions described above, we were dealing with Ser/Thr phosphorylation.Short-term heat stress had no significant influence on soluble protein composition as demonstrated by 2D gels stained with colloidal CBB G-250 (Fig. 2A and B). However, the extent of phosphorylation of the individual polypeptides changed upon heat treatment (Fig. 2C and D). The phosphorylation signals from polypeptides presented by spots 1 and 2 increased twice, whereas the phosphorylation signal from spots 3<U+0430>/3b decreased 1.5 times. Phosphopeptide 4 did not show any temperature-dependent change in phosphorylation. The high-intensity signal from phosphopeptide 5 dropped significantly upon an increase in temperature from 32 to 44°C (Fig. 2C and D). Proteome of soluble fractions of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Soluble proteins (50 µg) from wild-type GS cells grown at 32°C (A) and wild-type GS cells treated for 30 min at 44°C (B) were separated by 2DE and stained with Colloidal Coomassie Briliant Blue G-250. Corresponding autoradiographs (C and D). Dried gels were exposed to X-ray films for 30 h at –70°C. Spot numbers of the identified proteins correspond to those presented in Table 1.Proteome of soluble fractions of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Soluble proteins (50 µg) from wild-type GS cells grown at 32°C (A) and wild-type GS cells treated for 30 min at 44°C (B) were separated by 2DE and stained with Colloidal Coomassie Briliant Blue G-250. Corresponding autoradiographs (C and D). Dried gels were exposed to X-ray films for 30 h at –70°C. Spot numbers of the identified proteins correspond to those presented in Table 1.Thus, one can see that the increase in temperature causes significant changes in the intensity of Ser/Thr phosphorylation of proteins in Synechocystis. These changes might be due to autophosphorylation of the individual polypeptides, or due to temperature-dependent changes in the activity of different STPKs. For example, high temperature may inactivate certain STPKs. Protein kinases may phosphorylate either the same or a similar set of protein, or, alternatively, each individual STPK may phosphorylate its own substrate in vitro. To discriminate between these two possibilities, it is necessary (i) to identify the proteins, which correspond to the phosphorylated spots, and (ii) to clarify which of the 11 STPKs is able to phosphorylate the identified substrate in vitro.3.3. MALDI-TOF MS identification of phosphorylated proteinsSeven proteins that have been identified as phosphoproteins phosphorylated by STPKs were subjected to MALDI-TOF MS analysis. We analysed similar spots that were visible in soluble protein extracts obtained from cells that had been grown at optimal growth temperature and subjected to heat treatment for 30 min. This was done to ensure that the visible temperature-dependent changes in Ser/Thr phosphorylation referred to the same protein(s). Thus, all together, 14 spots have been subjected to mass-spectrometry analysis. These spots were easily and reproducibly separated by 2DE and isolated with sufficient amounts for MALDI-TOF MS analysis (Table 1). The phosphoproteins observed at 32°C (Fig. 1C) were identical to those observed at 44°C (Fig. 1D). It means that, indeed, the raise in temperature causes changes in Ser/Thr phosphorylation. List of Synechocystis phosphoproteins detected by in vitro assays and identified by MS analysisSpot numbers correspond to those in Fig. 2.

The table summarizes the results of three independent experiments.In general, we obtained rather high compliance with calculated and experimental data concerning molecular mass, pI, and peptide location in 2D gels and autoradiograms. It should be noted that the results of MS analysis were compared with the database of Synechocystis proteins, which, among others, includes polypeptides phosphorylated at His and Asp residues. In our case, however, such proteins were never found, since in our case phosphoproteins have been exposed to low pH at several stages of sample preparation (precipitation after phosphorylation in vitro, fixation of 2D gels at pH 1.0 after 2DE).The identified phosphoproteins belong to several functional groups: (i) the enzymes for basic metabolism (nos 1, 2, 3a, 3b, and 6); (ii) proteins for general stress response (nos 4 and 5); and (iii) proteins with unknown function (no. 7). Among the first group, there is a protein that participates in the Calvin cycle (no. 2, RuBisCo large subunit), and another protein is involved in protein biosynthesis (no. 1, methionyl-tRNA synthetase). It might be that an increase in phosphorylation of these proteins correlates with an increase in their enzymatic activity—the fact, which was demonstrated for some enzymes of the cycle of tricarbonic acids.426-Phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (no. 3a), which also belongs to the first group of identified proteins, participates in the first phase of pentose phosphate pathway. Phosphorylated status for proteins that are involved in this pathway has been demonstrated in B. subtilis.43Elongation factor Tu (no. 3b) exists in its phosphorylated form in all organisms, from archaeabacteria to humans, and it is characterized by the conserved sites of phosphorylation.7 Phosphorylation of factor Tu is, probably, required for optimization of the rate of translation. Here, we identified this protein with relatively high level of probability, higher than 70% (Table 1).It was not surprising that we have found the so-called heat-shock proteins among the identified phosphoproteins (nos 4 and 5). It should be noted, however, that these proteins, GrpE and GroES, were highly labelled with phosphate in the extracts obtained from cells grown at the normal temperature. Heat stress had no effect on the phosphorylation of GrpE, and it caused a decrease in phosphorylation of GroES (Fig. 2C and D). These changes might reflect temperature-dependent changes in the rate of translation of these proteins, in the activity of phosphatases, and/or changes in the activity of STPKs that use these proteins as the substrates.Our further efforts have been concentrated on the co-chaperonin GroES of 10 kDa as a putative substrate for STPKs activity. Identification of this polypeptide met the stringent criteria of analysis: in all our samples, this protein (no. 5) was digested with trypsin into five polypeptides with the 83% coverage of GroES amino acid sequence of Synechocystis (Table 1).It was earlier demonstrated that the expression of the groESL operon and the amount of GroES protein increase after 60 min of heat stress.44,45 Our experimental setup (44°C for 30 min) did not reveal any significant changes in the amount of GroES (Fig. 2B). However, we observed distinct changes in its Ser/Thr phosphorylation in vitro (Fig. 2D) under the heat stress. To our knowledge, phosphorylated form of GroES had been recently reported in E. coli,8 although the functional significance of such phosphorylation is still unknown. Much work has been done on GroEL phosphorylation and its importance for correct assembly of the GroESL chaperonin machinery.46–48 Here we show that (i) GroES is phosphorylated by STPKs, (ii) its Ser/Thr phosphorylation runs even at low temperature, and (iii) its Ser/Thr phosphorylation is reduced upon heat stress.3.4. GroES is a substrate for in vitro phosphorylationTo confirm that GroES might be a substrate for STPKs in Synechocystis and to identify the individual STPK, which participate in phosphorylation of GroES, we applied in vitro phosphorylation with the purified recombinant GroES (SupplementaryFig. S2) as a substrate for the protein kinase activity.Wild-type and 11 mutant (<U+0394>spkB-L) cells were treated at 44°C for 30 min, and soluble protein fractions were isolated from each strain. Twelve protein fractions isolated from those cells were equalized by protein content and used for phosphorylation of equal amounts of the purified recombinant GroES in the presence of [<U+03B3>-32P]ATP. The products of reaction were resolved with SDS–PAGE, and phosphorylated GroES was visualized by autoradiography (Fig. 3A). Since equal amounts of isolated proteins were incubated with equal amounts of the recombinant GroES in the presence of equal amounts of [<U+03B3>-32P]ATP, we can reliably validate the data on GroES phosphorylation presented in Fig. 3A. Phosphorylation in vitro of recombinant GroES by soluble protein fractions isolated from Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 (GS), spk mutants, and some of the complemented mutants. (A) GroES was phosphorylated in vitro with protein extracts obtained from the wild-type cells of Synechocystis (GS) and spk mutants grown at 32°C, and incubated for 30 min at 44°C. Autoradiographs and Coomassie R-250-stained gel are presented. (B) Similar reactions have been performed with wild-type cells of Synechocystis (GS), and with the mutant strains defective in SpkF, SpkC, and SpkK, which have been complemented with pVZ-spkC, pVZ-spkF, and pVZ-spkK (designated as +spkC, +spkF, and +spkK, respectively).Phosphorylation in vitro of recombinant GroES by soluble protein fractions isolated from Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 (GS), spk mutants, and some of the complemented mutants.

Phosphorylation, however, increased in the extracts obtained from heat-stressed cells. Other mutants could be divided into the following groups according to their character of GroES phosphorylation. Mutants defective in spkB and spkL displayed relatively high levels of GroES phosphorylation at 32°C when compared with wild-type cells grown at 32°C. Heat stress at 44°C caused a severe decrease in the level of GroES phosphorylation. Mutants defective in spkD, spkE, spkH, spkI, and spkJ phosphorylated GroES less intensively than <U+0394>spkG-mutant or wild-type cells at 32°C. Heat stress at 44°C also caused a decrease in GroES phosphorylation in those mutants.Finally, three mutants defective in spkC, spkF, and spkK displayed nearly null level of GroES phosphorylation either at normal or at high temperatures.Thus, one can conclude that, in Synechocystis, indeed, small co-chaperonin GroES is a target of phosphorylation by STPKs. It is unlikely that SpkC, SpkF, and SpkK all phosphorylate GroES. If this would be the case, the other two kinases should successfully phosphorylate GroES in vitro when the third kinase is knocked out. However, this does not happen. We suggest that these three protein kinases compose a chain or a cascade, and they phosphorylate one another with the final target of GroES. The place of each kinase in this cascade and the order of their functioning are still unclear, but it could be suggested that they might work in the following order: SpkF (transmembrane) <U+2192> SpkC (membrane associated)<U+2192> SpkK (soluble). Anyway, only such mode of action explains the fact that phosphorylation of the GroES is lost, when any of the three kinases is knocked out.To prove such a sequential (one after another) way of action, we complemented these three mutations in the mutants defective in SpkF, SpkC, and SpkK, with the corresponding genes expressed in the autonomously replicating plasmid pVZ321 under control of their own promoters. One can see that complementation of any of the STPK restores the ability of cells to phosphorylate GroES (Fig. 3B). This confirms the suggestion that the SpkF, SpkC, and SpkK might comprise a cascade to phosphorylate the GroES.To ensure that the recombinant GroES is not phosphorylated by E. coli cells, we compared the patterns of phosphorylation obtained with Synechocystis and E. coli-soluble protein extracts. Figure 4 demonstrates that E. coli cells did not phosphorylate expressed and/or externally provided recombinant GroES protein. Thus, we conclude that phosphorylation of GroES demonstrated in Fig. 3 entirely results from the activity of the cyanobacterial STPKs. Phosphorylation of the recombinant GroES protein by soluble protein fractions obtained from Synechocystis and E. coli. (A) Soluble protein fraction was obtained from disrupted cells of Synechocystis GS, which had been grown at 32°C and transferred to 44°C for 30 min, by centrifugation at 100 000g for 1 h. Soluble protein fraction of E. coli BL21cells transformed with pET-GroES was obtained from disrupted cells by centrifugation at 16 000g for 20 min. Cells were grown at 37°C, and the protein extracts were obtained from non-induced cells, and from cells, in which the expression of GroES was induced by 50 mM IPTG for 3 h. About 1.8 µg of the purified recombinant GroES was added to each protein fraction (7.5 µg) in the presence of 1.5 µCi of [<U+03B3>-32P]ATP. The reaction of phosphorylation was carried out for 15 min at 30°C. Upper panel represents the results of phosphorylation of externally provided GroES.

Lower panel shows parts of gels stained with CBB.To make sure that we are dealing with Ser/Thr-type of protein phosphorylation, the stability of the in vitro phosphorylated proteins in the presence of different pH was examined.Proteins were isolated from control and heat-stressed wild-type cells, phosphorylated with [<U+03B3>-32P]ATP, separated by electrophoresis, blotted onto PVDF, and stained with Ponceau red. The portions of the membrane containing the GroES were incubated in solutions with different pH: 1.0, 7.0, and 14.0. A majority of phosphate incorporated into GroES was released when the incubation was carried out at 45°C for 2 h at pH 14 (Fig. 5A). N-Phosphate amino acids (phoshohistidine, phospholysine, and phosphoarginine) are known to be stable at pH of 14.0 but not at pH of 1.0, while O-phosphate amino acids (phosphoserine and phosphothreonine) are known to be stable at pH of 1.0 but not at pH of 14.0.49 On the other hand, acyl-phosphate amino acids (phosphoaspartate and phosphoglutamate) are labile at both pH of 1.0 and 14.0, whereas the phosphotyrosine and phosphocysteine are stable at both pH. We observed a disappearance of the radioactive signal from the blots at pH of 14.0. Therefore, the stability profile for phosphorylated GroES is in agreement with Ser/Thr nature of protein phosphorylation (Fig. 5A). Stability of phosphorylated GroES at different pHs. (A) Autoradiographs of the phosphorylated GroES. Purified GroES (2.5 µg) mixed with either protein extracts derived from control (32°C) wild-type cells (10 µg) (lanes 1, 3, and 5) or with heat-treated (44°C for 30 min) cells (10 µg) (lanes 2, 4, and 6) was phosphorylated in vitro with [<U+03B3>-32P]ATP. The reaction was terminated with 3× concentrated SDS–PAGE sample buffer and immediately subjected to SDS–PAGE (15% PAG). After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred onto PVDF membrane. The membranes were stained with Ponceau red and incubated at 45°C for 2 h in 50 mM KCl–HCl (pH 1.0), 0.1 M Tris–HCl (pH 7), or 1 M KOH (pH 14). The radioactivity remaining in the membrane was revealed after its exposure onto a X-ray film. (B).

Right panel: The same as the middle panel but probed with anti-P-Ser antibodies.Additional confirmation of the presence of phosphoserines and phosphothreonines in the protein was obtained by western blotting with the use of the anti-P-Ser and anti-P-Thr specific monoclonal antibodies (Fig. 5B). This experiment confirmed the presence of the Ser/Thr phosphorylation in the protein extract obtained from the wild-type cells of Synechocystis (Fig. 5B, left panel), and the ability of this extract to phosphorylate Ser and Thr residues of the externally added GroES (Fig. 5, central and right panels).3.5. Ser/Thr phosphorylation of the soluble proteins isolated from the <U+25B5>hrcA mutantUp to date, it is known that a number of heat-inducible genes are under negative control of the histidine kinase Hik34,41 and some of them (like groESL operon) are under negative control of the transcription factor called HrcA (Sll1670).36 Taking into account the results described above, it is reasonable to suggest the involvement of STPKs into the temperature signal transduction pathway(s). If this is the case, it would be predicted that the mutants defective in HrcA and/or Hik34 actively express heat-shock genes and demonstrate the maximum level of Ser/Thr phosphorylation at normal temperature, such as 32°C.Indeed, total Ser/Thr phosphorylation was much higher in <U+25B5>hrcA cells than in wild-type cells (Fig. 6). Among individual polypeptides, those with nos 1, 2, 4, 6, and 7 were phosphorylated most intensively. In <U+25B5>hrcA cells grown at 32°C, the phosphorylation level of polypeptides 1, 2, and 6 was higher (Fig. 6A) than in wild-type cells exposed to 44°C (Fig. 2D). Phosphorylation in vitro of soluble protein fraction isolated from Synechocystis GS <U+0394>HrcA mutant grown at 32°C and treated at 44°C for 30 min. Autoradiographs of phosphoprotein patterns at 32°C (A) and 44°C (B) and the corresponding western blots (C and D) developed with anti-Hsp60 (GroEL) antibodies are presented. Dashed circles designate the positions of GroEL. Dried gels were exposed to X-ray films for 20 h at –70°C.Phosphorylation in vitro of soluble protein fraction isolated from Synechocystis GS <U+0394>HrcA mutant grown at 32°C and treated at 44°C for 30 min. Autoradiographs of phosphoprotein patterns at 32°C (A) and 44°C (B) and the corresponding western blots (C and D) developed with anti-Hsp60 (GroEL) antibodies are presented. Dashed circles designate the positions of GroEL. Dried gels were exposed to X-ray films for 20 h at –70°C.When <U+25B5>hrcA cells that had been grown at 32°C were exposed at 44°C, the extent of phosphorylation of these polypeptides increased, at least, two times, when compared with 32°C-grown mutant cells (Fig. 6A and B), whereas that of the polypeptide no. 4 decreased more than three times. Heat treatment at 44°C did not affect phosphorylation of phosphoprotein 7, resembling its temperature-independent behaviour in wild-type cells (Fig. 2C and D). The observed patterns of phosphorylation are in agreement with the repressive nature of HrcA regulation. Our results suggest that most of genes for Ser/Thr-phosphorylated proteins (Fig. 6) might be under the control of transcription factor HrcA.The most striking difference between wild-type and <U+25B5>hrcA cells was that the latter displayed phosphorylated protein, which was similar to 60 kDa chaperonin GroEL, in terms of its molecular weight and pI characteristics. This protein in its phosphorylated form was visible only in <U+25B5>hrcA cells grown at 32°C (Fig. 6A), and it was not visible in cells exposed to 44°C (Fig. 6B). Cross-reaction of this polypeptide with antibodies against GroEL (Fig. 6C and D) revealed the presence of GroEL in protein extract obtained from both, 32°C-grown and 44°C-treated cells.Since in vitro phosphorylation demonstrates only de novo incorporation of exogenously provided [<U+03B3>-32P]ATP into polypeptides due to intrinsic protein kinase activities, it did not display any phosphorylation that had already occurred in cells or cell extract before the addition of radioactively labelled ATP. In the <U+25B5>hrcA cells, GroEL should be expressed constitutively at 32 and 44°C. It is very likely that GroEL was actively phosphorylated at 32°C and, therefore, the exposure of cells to 44°C did not contribute significantly to Ser/Thr phosphorylation in vitro of GroEL, as shown in Fig. 6. It is also possible that phosphorylation of GroEL occurs within few minutes under heat stress conditions, and additional incubation (30–60 min) at 44°C did not further affect its phosphorylation status (Fig. 6B).It is known that chaperonin GroEL can prevent misfolding of polypeptides and promote the refolding and proper assembly of unfolded proteins generated that had been generated under heat stress. It is generally accepted that in E. coli cells, heat stress promotes reversible phosphorylation of GroEL,46,47 which is necessary for the formation of an active oligomeric GroESL complex. However, in Synechocystis mutant cells that lack transcription regulator HrcA, GroEL is produced and, perhaps, phosphorylated by STPKs constitutively.Phosphorylation of GroES (phosphoprotein no. 5) was lower in the <U+25B5>hrcA mutant (Fig. 6A) than in wild-type cells at 32°<U+0421> (Fig. 2C). After heat treatment at 44°C for 30 min, the signal from GroES in <U+25B5>hrcA mutant cells (Fig. 6B) became comparable with that of wild-type cells exposed to 44°C (Fig. 2D). Therefore, it seems that phosphorylation of GroES also ran constitutively at 32°C, and a decrease in its phosphorylation at 44°C reflected a decrease in the activity of the corresponding STPK(s).3.6. Ser/Thr phosphorylation of the soluble proteins isolated from the <U+25B5>hik34 mutantHistidine protein kinase Hik34 (Slr1285) is a negative regulator for the expression of heat-shock genes. Disruption of the hik34 gene causes constitutive expression of a number of genes for heat-shock proteins at normal temperature.41 This allows mutant cells to survive under severe heat stress, such as exposure to 48°C for 3 h. Inactivation of hik34 up-regulates transcription of groESL, htpG, hspA, dnaK2, and slr1634,41 whereas inactivation of hrcA up-regulates only groESL and cpn60.36 DNA microarray analysis demonstrated that mutation in hik34 does not affect transcription of the hrcA gene at 34 or 44°C.41 Possible interaction of Hik34 and HrcA has been suggested,50 although experimental evidence for that is unavailable.Here we examined the phosphorylation patterns in wild-type cells and in mutant cells that lack histidine kinase Hik34. It should be noted that the parental strain for the Hik34 mutant possessed the glucose-tolerant (GT) phenotype, whereas all other mutants were generated with a parental strain, which had GS phenotype.51 The intensity of Ser/Thr phosphorylation in the protein extracts of GT cells was, in general, lower than that of GS cells (Fig. 7A; Supplementary Fig. S3).

Dashed circles designate the positions of GroEL. Dried gels were exposed to X-ray films for 30 h at -70°C.Heat stress caused alterations in the phosphorylation pattern in <U+25B5>hik34 cells that differed from the alterations observed in GS cells. There was no effect of temperature on phosphoproteins nos 1 and 3<U+0430>/3b. Phosphorylation of phosphoproteins 2 and 6 increased, although to a less extent than it was observed in GS cells. In <U+25B5>hik34 cells, constitutive phosphorylation of phosphoprotein 7 was lower than in GS cells. Heat stress, however, caused the increase in its phosphorylation (Fig. 7B).In <U+25B5>hik34 cells grown at 32°<U+0421>, phosphorylation of GroES was lower than in GS cells, but higher than in <U+25B5>hrcA cells. Heat stress for 30 min diminished GroES phosphorylation (Fig. 6B), although to a less extent than it was observed in GS and <U+25B5>hrcA cells (Figs 2 and 6).The GroEL chaperonin appears in equal amounts in <U+25B5>hik34 cells at both 32 and 44°C, as revealed by western blotting (Fig. 7C and D). However, we could not find even the traces of its phosphorylation in vitro. This implies that GroEL might be rapidly and intensively phosphorylated already at 32°C. Slabas et al.44 identified five spots that corresponded to GroEL1 and three spots that corresponded to GroEL2 (Cpn60) by proteomics. The antibodies used in our assay were raised against a mixture of GroEL1 and GroEL2, and they certainly recognize both forms of this chaperonin. There is no doubt about the constitutive expression of GroEL in <U+25B5>hrcA and <U+25B5>hik34 cells, but there is a serious doubt about its temperature-dependent phosphorylation. Also, comparison of the phosphorylation patterns for GroEL in <U+25B5>hrcA and <U+25B5>hik34 mutant cells leads to the suggestion that phosphorylation of GroEL somehow depends on the activity of HrcA, but not on the activity of Hik34.Phosphoproteome of E. coli also did not demonstrate any phosphorylated GroEL at normal growth temperature,8 although the enrichment of phosphorylated proteins was carried out in that work. However, the phosphorylated GroES was apparent in E. coli cells. Since GroES and GroEL are encoded in one operon in E. coli and Synechocystis (the latter organism has an additional gene for GroEL-like protein, called groEL2 or cpn60), it is reasonable to expect their co-transcription, co-translation, and, finally, 1:1 ratio in cells. Differences in their Ser/Thr phosphorylation observed in Synechocystis imply that either (i) they have different affinity to similar or same STPKs or (ii) they are phosphorylated by different protein kinases.Anyhow, it is evident that the expression of groESL operon is regulated by HrcA and Hik34, but phosphorylation of GroEL and GroES is regulated differentially with possible participation of HrcA, but not Hik34.The data obtained here allow us to conclude that STPKs are involved in phosphorylation of several proteins during routine growth and under heat stress in Synechocystis. We found that the small co-chaperonin GroES was phosphorylated by STPKs, as it was previously found for 60 kDa chaperonin GroEL.46,47 We also found that the SpkC, SpkF, and SpkK might comprise a regulatory cascade that ensures phosphorylation of the GroES. Phosphorylation in vitro of the recombinant GroES demonstrated that heat stress at 44°C caused an increase in its phosphorylation by STPKs. However, we could not observe such an increase in our in vitro assays when no GroES was provided externally. Our data imply that Ser/Thr phosphorylation in Synechocystis runs intensively and constitutively at normal growth temperature.Supplementary DataSupplementary Data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThe work was supported by grants from the Russian Foundation for Basic Research (nos 09-04-01074-a, 10-04-00840-<U+0430>, 11-04-01006, and 11-04-01509) to D.A.L., V.V.Z., G.V.N., and I.E.M., and by a grant from the ‘Molecular and Cell Biology Program' of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and by a grant from Russian Ministry of Education and Science (no. 16.740.11.0176) to D.A.L.Supplementary data"

IntroductionPigeonpea (Cajanus cajan L.) is one of the major pulse crops of the tropics and subtropics. The crop is grown on over 4.8 Mha across the world, with an annual production of 4.1 Mt (http://faostat.fao.org). It is a major food legume crop in South Asia and East Africa, with India as the largest producer (3.07 Mha) followed by Myanmar (0.54 Mha) and Kenya (0.20 Mha). It is the only cultivated food crop of the Cajaninae subtribe and has a diploid genome with 11 pairs of chromosomes (2n = 2x = 22) and an estimated genome size of 858 Mb.1 Pigeonpea is a rich source of protein and vitamin B, and as a leguminous plant, it contributes as much as 40 kg nitrogen per hectare to the soil.Despite its economic and ecological importance, this crop has gained less attention in terms of improvement in production. As a result, production has reached a plateau. As demonstrated in other crops, modern genomics approaches can facilitate breeding, leading to enhanced crop productivity. Integration of genomic approaches in breeding programmes has been referred to as ‘genomics-assisted breeding’.2 Availability of genomic resources like molecular markers, genetic maps, transcriptomic or genome sequence data, and metabolome analyses are the pre-requisites for undertaking genomics-assisted breeding. While these platforms are available in many cereal and major legume crops like soybean, cowpea and common bean,3 pigeonpea has not had the development and application of this genomic revolution. In this crop, only a few hundred (172) simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers4–7 and a recent genetic map8 have become available.Without a genome sequence, transcriptome sequencing is an effective approach for gene discovery and identifying transcripts involved in specific biological processes. Expressed sequence tag (EST) studies have provided insight into genomic architecture and helped to elucidate genes involved in biological processes [grapevine, Populus, Arabidopsis].9–11 As of October 2010, ~10 817 pigeonpea EST sequences were available at the NCBI GenBank (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/gquery?term=pigeonpea). This small set of ESTs highlights the need for a larger collection of sequence information before employing effective functional genomics studies in pigeonpea research.In recent years, the advent of next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies has made it possible to inexpensively and quickly generate large-scale transcript sequence data.12 With an objective of characterizing functionally important genes in pigeonpea, transcriptome analysis was undertaken by sampling a large number of reads from normalized cDNA libraries prepared from different tissues, developmental conditions and physiological stages. The initial part of the present study was aimed at discovering and characterizing genes from the pigeonpea variety Pusa Ageti by developing and analysing the transcriptome assembly of pigeonpea based on FLX/454 sequencing. Secondly, the Illumina 1G, RNA-seq approach was employed on mRNA of 10 parental genotypes of five mapping populations that segregate for Fusarium wilt (FW) and/or sterility mosaic disease (SMD). Alignment of Illumina sequence data of these parental lines with the transcriptome assembly provided a framework for quantitative measurement of gene expression as well as single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) detection in these parental lines.This may be the first report in pigeonpea of large-scale transcriptome data generation and the corresponding comprehensive analysis to understand transcriptome and evolutionary genome dynamics. Based on digital expression analyses, we have also identified candidate FW- and SMD-responsive genes. Finally, this study provides a resource of both SSR and SNP markers identified from these sequences.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant material and library constructionPusa Ageti (ICP 28), an early maturing pigeonpea variety, was selected for library construction and transcriptome analysis. Seeds were sown in pots (three seeds per pot), and maintained in a glass-house. In order to maximize the diversity of expressed genes in pigeonpea, tissues from different developmental stages were targeted for collection and construction of cDNA libraries. These tissue samples included embryo, cotyledon, root and shoot primordia, apical meristem, leaves, senescing leaves, flowers, stamen and roots, harvested from several individual glass-house grown pigeonpea plants at different time intervals. This was done to analyse gene expression associated with the developmental process. Tissues were washed briefly with 0.1% DEPC water and then were frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted from all the harvested tissues using modified hot-acid phenol method.13 The integrity and purity of all the samples were assessed both on 1.2% formaldehyde agarose gel and UV Spectrophotometer at A260:A280. An equal amount of each appropriate RNA sample was pooled to form a composite collection of total RNA sample for each tissue. Ten cDNA libraries were constructed to characterize specific stages of gene expression.In order to minimize differences among the abundance of different transcripts (i.e. genes expressed at different levels), amplified cDNA was normalized employing the Smart cloning methodology14 using the services of Evrogen (www.evrogen.com) and Sfi IA/B primers/adapters that permit directional cloning. The detailed methodology of library construction and normalization has been described in Cheung et al.152.2. Sequence data assembly and clusteringSequence analyses and assembly was conducted using publicly available software and custom Perl scripts. Quality trimming of the sequences involved trimming adapter sequences, removing short sequences (<50 nucleotides) for the assembly process as this will lead to false joining of reads, and chimeras that were sequenced hence reducing the quality of unique sequences. The vector-trimmed high-quality sequences were selected for further clustering and alignment to form transcript assemblies (TAs) using the CAP3 program.16 The following parameters were used for all CAP3 assemblies: –p 95–o 50–g 3–y 50–t 1000. These parameters were chosen to satisfy three primary goals: (i) to maximize contig length, (ii) to minimize production of contigs with highly variable read coverage, as these tend to be spurious assemblies and (iii) increasing the value of the ‘–t’ parameter improves the quality of the assembly at the cost of using additional memory on the assembly server; the value of 1000 was chosen as it was higher than the default but remained within the memory constraints of the assembly server. The assembly included the publicly available 10 817 ESTs of pigeonpea along with the FLX/454 reads.2.3. Identification of paralogouesIdentification of paralogous genes was conducted using both the contig consensus sequences and the singletons following assembly. The longest open reading frame was identified using EMBOSS: getorf (http://emboss.open-bio.org/wiki/Appdocs) to identify all open reading frames and a custom Perl script to retain only the longest. Clustering of these sequences followed using a virtual suffix tree generation with six frame translation using Vmatch.17 Gene families of size 2–6 were clustered with the following parameters, i.e. subject per cent match of 85, query per cent match of 70, a minimum length of 20 amino acids and an exdrop of 30. Pair-wise alignments were obtained using ClustalW18 and synonymous distances (Ks values) calculated using the method of Goldman and Yang19 as implemented in PAML.202.4. Alignment of CcTA to the soybean genomeAlignments of CcTA with the soybean genome were made with GMAP, requiring 80% identity and 80% coverage, maximum intron length of 10 000 bp, and maximum of 10 introns per gene fragment. The highest scoring alignment satisfying the stringency criteria was taken as the best hit. Alignments within 1% identity and 1% coverage of each other were retained as multiple equally good matches.2.5. Functional annotation and similarity searchFunctional annotations of 127 754 TUSs were made using BLASTX comparisons against the UniRef non-redundant protein database. Sequence similarity was considered at a bit-score >50 and a significant e-value = 1E-08. Each TUS was assigned a putative cellular function based on the significant database hit with the lowest E-value. Subsequently, TUSs that showed a significant BLASTX hit were used for functional annotation based on Gene Ontology (GO) categories from the UniProt database (UniProt-GO). TUSs were thus assigned to primary and sub-GO functional categories.2.6. Gene expression analysiscDNA pools from disease-stressed tissues of 10 pigeonpea genotypes were sequenced using Illumina 1G sequencing. These 10 genotypes are responsive to SMD and FW and represent parental genotypes of five mapping populations and segregate for the given stresses. FW stress was induced in four genotypes: ICPL 87119 and ICPL 99050 (resistant), ICPL 87091 and ICPB 2049 (susceptible). SMD stress was induced in six genotypes: ICPL 20096, ICPL 7035 and BSMR 736 (resistant), ICPL 332, TTB 7 and TAT 10 (susceptible). Stress was imposed on 15th day after sowing, using two methods: (i) root dipping method for FW infection and (ii) leaf stapling method for sterility mosaic virus infection. The tissues were harvested after 10 days of infection. Total RNA was extracted from all the harvested tissues using modified hot-acid phenol method.13 cDNA libraries were constructed and subjected to Illumina 1G sequencing. Illumina tags were aligned to the CcTA and counts were assigned to each TUS for all 10 genotypes. These expression values were used for estimation of expression patterns of these TUSs in the parental combination of each cross. Differentially expressed genes/TUSs between pairs of SMD- and FW-responsive genotypes were identified. The expression values of TUSs were transformed to log 2 scale. Expression values of each gene were used to compare respective libraries of susceptible and resistant genotypes in each cross. Expression differences between TUSs from susceptible and resistant lines were considered with a minimum of a two-fold difference in log 2 expression. The set of TUSs with high differential expression =5 were considered for functional annotation using BLASTX analysis as described above.2.7. Identification of microsatellite/SSRsSSR mining of 127 754 TUSs was carried out using the MIcroSAtellite (MISA)21 (http://pgrc.ipk-gatersleben.de/misa/) program, with the following parameters: at least 10 repeats for mono-, 6 repeats for di- and 5 repeats for tri-, tetra-, penta- and hexa-nucleotide for simple SSRs. Both perfect (i.e. SSRs containing a single repeat motif such as ‘AGG’) and compound (i.e. composed of two or more SSRs separated by =100 bp) SSRs were identified. The Primer3 program22 was used for designing the primer pairs for identified SSRs based on the following criteria: (i) annealing temperature (Tm) between 50–65°C with 60°C as optimum; (ii) product size ranging from 100 to 350 bp; (iii) primer length ranging from 18 to 24 bp with an optimum of 20 bp; and (iv) GC% content in the range of 40–60%.2.8. Identification of SNPsIdentification of SNPs from Illumina data was carried out using the Alpheus software system.23 SNPs were identified on the basis of alignment of Illumina reads generated from each of the genotypes against a reference—in this case, the CcTA and respective counter genotype, allowing not more than two mismatches. Based on alignment results, variants at a particular nucleotide position were identified. Significant variants were selected based on two criteria, allele frequency between two genotypes >0.8, and number of tags aligned to the reference >5.2.9. Identification of intron-spanning region (ISR) markersUsing alignments of paralogous genes (Section 2.4), primers were selected to span introns in predicted genes. The Primer3 program was used to design primers with default parameters, except for the requirement of spanning one predicted intron.3. Results and discussionThis is the most comprehensive study of pigeonpea transcriptomic data to date. Pusa Ageti (ICP 28), a leading pigeonpea variety in India, was chosen for developing these genomic/transcriptomic resources, based on its phenology and the utility of this genotype in breeding programmes. The sequence data generated have been analysed to understand the transcriptome architecture and genome organization with respect to potential duplication, identification of candidate genes for FW and SMD based on digital gene expression profiling and the development of genetic markers.3.1. Clustering and assembly of transcript readsUntil recently, only 10 817 ESTs were available, of which >90% were developed during last 2 years. With the objective of generating a comprehensive transcriptomic resource, deep sequencing was undertaken on cDNAs pools of 31 different developmental stages from early vegetative growth through the reproductive organs (Supplementary Fig. S1). Following cDNA synthesis, these libraries were pooled and normalized. FLX/454 sequencing of this normalized cDNA pool generated 494 353 short transcript reads (STRs), with an average length of 171 bp. At the time of data analysis, 10 817 Sanger ESTs, with average read length 527 bp, were available in the public domain via NCBI. These two data sets were analysed separately and in combination. Clustering of 354 131 STRs alone yielded 52 827 contigs, with an average length of 262 bp including 4308 high confidence singletons (that contain only two reads with zero read coverage) and 140 222 singletons. Clustering of Sanger ESTs yielded 746 contigs, with an average length 637 bp, and 5553 singletons. In order to develop a transcriptome reference in pigeonpea, 505 170 FLX/454 STRs and Sanger ESTs were assembled in combination to yield a pigeonpea transcriptome assembly (CcTA) comprising of a total 127 754 tentative unique sequences (TUSs). The sequence data from this study have been submitted to the Legume Information System (LIS) (http://comparative-legumes.org). The sequence data can be accessed at http://cajca.comparative-legumes.org/data/2011/1e0b2bbdb4a3dca874759a9c7d23d46b/transcript_contigs.fa.gz.The CcTA includes 48 726 (38.1%) contigs (average length 273 bp, maximum length 2067 bp) and 79 028 (61.9%) singletons (average length 198 bp, maximum length 1720 bp). A total of 3021 contigs (6.1%) were longer than 500 bp. Details about length distribution and read depth of contigs are given in Table 1 and Fig. 1, respectively. The overall redundancy of the library was calculated at 25.2%, suggesting that the normalization process was effective and that the libraries generated have the potential to uncover many more unique transcripts. These results support that FLX/454-based gene discovery represents a viable and perhaps favourable alternative to Sanger-based sequencing of EST libraries, when a diverse sampling of genes is more important than obtaining full transcript-length contigs.15,24Sequence length distribution before and after assembly of FLX/454 STRs and Sanger ESTsSequence length distribution before and after assembly of FLX/454 STRs and Sanger ESTsDistribution and read depth of sequence tags in the contigs.

A maximum of 12 contigs showed a read depth of >1000 tags.3.2. Evaluation of paralogous genesTo evaluate characteristics of the CcTA sequences and to identify potential signatures of genome duplication in pigeonpea, the transcriptome assembly was analysed by comparing all TUSs against one another. Of the 127 754 TUSs sequences, 9.8% (12 515) could be clustered into families of similar genes (requiring subject per cent match of 85, query per cent match of 70, and a minimum alignment length of 60 nt). Of these, 3098 occurred in clusters of size 2, 537 of size 3, 181 of size 4, 89 of size 5 and 68 of size 6. The modal per cent identity among paralogues was 98.5, with the proportion of paralogues dropping to less than half the modal value at ~96.5 per cent identity. Stated differently, the paralogue pairs are dominated by nearly identical or highly similar sequences. These alignments can also be used to find pair-wise synonymous distance measures, and tallied for Ks ranges for comparison with published Ks values for soybean (Fig. 2). There is a sharp Ks peak for Cajanus at roughly 0.04—contrasting with the soybean peak at ~0.12.25 While this might be indicative of a recent whole-genome (or other large-scale segmental) duplication in Cajanus, a likely cause is incompletely collapsed contigs. The chromosome number of pigeonpea (2n = 22) is the same as in the other phaseoloids such as common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), which are not known to have experienced recent polyploidy. Examination of 40 random near-identical paralogous alignments (data not shown) shows that the majority (>60%) of the differences are indels in the vicinity of homopolymer runs—which very likely derive from the large proportion of 454 STRs used in the TA construction.

Characterization of the pigeonpea transcriptomeAs an effort to validate gene structures in the newly developed assembly, the 127 754 TUSs were aligned to soybean using GMAP, with identity and coverage thresholds of 90% and 80%, respectively.26 Of these TUSs, 33 874 had matches at these thresholds, corresponding to 10 857 soybean genes. The TUSs were distributed similarly across the 20 chromosomes of soybean, with an average of ~1693 loci on each chromosome, with the exception of chromosome 13, which had 4162 matches. The excess on chromosome 13 is primarily due to many matches across a long ribosomal array on this chromosome. The alignment results are available as a track in the SoyBase genome browser (http://soybase.org/gbrowse/cgi-bin/gbrowse/gmax1.01/).Putative assignments of 127 754 TUSs into functional categories resulted in the assignment of 32 719 TUSs (25.6%) with similarity to the UniRef non-redundant protein database (BLASTX bit-score >50 and a significant e-value = 1E-08), while 8949 sequences (7.0%) had low similarity and 86 086 (67.3%) sequences had no significant matches (Supplementary Table S1). The TUSs could be placed into GO categories: biological process (5455), cellular component (3958) and molecular function (6491). Enzyme IDs retrieved from the UniProt database were distributed in one of the six major enzyme classes: transferases 31% (474), followed by hydrolases 28% (443), oxido-reductases 25% (389) ligases 6% (98), lyases 5% (79) and isomerases 5% (79). Further details about the GO categories and enzyme IDs of the TUSs are shown in Supplementary Table S2. A noteworthy aspect of this analysis is that the majority of the transcripts were involved in metabolic and cellular process—as expected since most libraries were derived from developing tissues.27SMD and FW are two serious diseases that adversely affect pigeonpea production. With an objective of identifying candidate genes for these diseases, Illumina 1G sequencing was used on the transcriptomes of FW-challenged root tissues and SMD-challenged leaf tissues of five each resistant (ICPL 87119, ICPB 2049, ICPL 20096, BSMR 736 and ICPL 7035) and susceptible genotypes (ICPL 87091, ICPL 99050, TAT 10, ICPL 332 and TTB 7). The number of Illumina tags (36 bp long) ranged from 18 644 113 (ICPL 87119) to 14 514 194 (TAT 10) for the 10 genotypes. The sequence data of these Illumina tags have been submitted to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). The data can be accessed at (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and accession numbers are: SRA030523.1 to SRP005971.1. These tags were aligned to the CcTA (Supplementary Table S3). As a result, ~35 million Illumina tags could be aligned to 54 426 TUSs. Numerical comparison of these tags between a pair of resistant and susceptible genotypes for a disease (usually the parents of a mapping population) was used to identify differentially expressed genes for a disease.Since the numbers of Illumina tags mapped to the transcriptome assembly varied among genotypes, the data were normalized per million reads. For the SMD study, a numerical comparison of SMD-responsive reads generated from three resistant (ICPL 20096, BSMR 736 and ICPL 7035) and three susceptible (ICPL 332, TAT 10 and TTB 7) genotypes representing three mapping populations was conducted. The Log 2 threshold for this analysis was taken as -2 to +2. The number of TUSs showing expression differences at these cutoffs ranged from 7505 (BSMR 736 × TAT 10) to 10 497 (ICPL 20096 × ICPL 332). In the case of the TTB 7 × ICPL 7035 combination, the number of differentially expressed genes was 9402. Similarly, in the FW study, a comparison was made between the specific parental combinations used to develop two different mapping populations (with the same thresholds) to find TUSs with differential expression. The number of TUSs with significant differentially expressed genes ranged from 6673 (ICPB 2049 × ICPL 99050) to 11 518 (ICPL 87119 × ICPL 87091) (Fig. 3). Distribution of differentially expressed genes in SMD- and FW-responsive genotypes. Differential expression was calculated based on Log 2 value, with a threshold of less than -2 to greater than +2 number of differentially expressed gene was calculated for three SMD- and two FW-parental combinations. Comparison of expression values from susceptible parent to the resistant gave an estimate of up- and down-regulated genes in each cross.Distribution of differentially expressed genes in SMD- and FW-responsive genotypes.

Comparison of expression values from susceptible parent to the resistant gave an estimate of up- and down-regulated genes in each cross.Based on the expression values for differentially expressed genes in SMD- and FW-responsive genotypes, hierarchical clustering was done for SMD- and FW-responsive genes separately to compare the pattern of gene expression. These clusters show the pattern of co-regulated genes for the SMD-responsive genotypes (Fig. 4A) and for the FW-responsive genotypes (Fig. 4B). Hierarchical clustering of differentially expressed TAs within SMD- and FW-responsive genotypes. Hierarchial clustering of the gene involved in SMD- and FW-stress responses was done using HCE version 2.0 beta web tool. These two dendrograms illustrate the co-regulation of genes in resistant and susceptible genotypes under stress, (A) clustering of 5106 genes showing expression variation across six SMD-responsive genotypes (three resistant, ICPL 20096, ICPL 7035, BSMR 736, and three susceptible, ICPL 332, TTB 7, TAT 10). (B) Clustering of 3384 genes showing expression variation across four FW-responsive genotypes (two resistant, ICPL 87119, ICPL 99050, and two susceptible, ICPB 2049, ICPL 87091).

Colour scale (from green to red) represents the range of expression level.In order to study the gene expression pattern between two parental genotypes of a mapping population, the numbers of up-regulated and down-regulated TUSs were calculated with respect to the resistant parent. The numbers of up-regulated TUSs remained high in all the crosses studied, with an exception of ICPL 87119 × ICPL 87091, which had more down-regulated TUSs (11 364) when compared with up-regulated (154). Log 2 fold differences between the parental combinations are shown in Table 2. Summary of differentially expressed TUSs across five parental combinationsSummary of differentially expressed TUSs across five parental combinationsFunctional annotations of differentially expressed TUSs are described next, with the additional requirement of =5 fold differences across all the parental combinations. The annotation analysis was conducted in three ways: (i) TUSs differentially expressed across all the 10 genotypes, (ii) TUSs differentially expressed in 6 SMD-responsive genotypes separately and in 4 FW-responsive genotypes separately and (iii) the common set of TUSs that is differentially expressed in both FW- and SMD-responsive genotypes. Based on these analyses, in the first category, 6107 TUSs (with fold difference =5) were selected for functional classification. Considering an E-value cutoff of =1E-08 and a bit-score value of =50, functional annotation for 3698 TUSs showed significant similarity with the UniRef non-redundant protein database. No significant matches were found for 2409 TUSs. For 3698 TUSs with functional classes, we found that in addition to basic housekeeping genes, these TUSs also showed homology to genes involved in stress response, such as proline-rich protein, Syringolide-induced protein, desiccation protective protein of soybean, ABA-responsive protein, and leucine zipper protein (Supplementary Table S4).Among these 3698 TUSs, 2106 could be assigned into three major categories: (i) molecular function, (ii) biological process and (iii) cellular component. These categories were further subcategorized, i.e. under molecular function category, the subcategory ‘binding’ accounted for highest percentage of TUSs (594), followed by ‘catalytic activity’ (513), ‘transporter’ (58), ‘structural molecule’ (52) and rest of the subcategories accounting for 75 TUSs. Similarly, under ‘biological process’ category, the highest number of TUSs were assigned to the subcategory ‘metabolic process’ (571) followed by ‘cellular process’ (542), response to ‘stimuli’ (152), ‘biological regulation’ (118), ‘establishment of localization’ (108) and 363 TUSs accounted for rest of the subcategories. Under ‘cellular component’ category, the highest percentage of TUSs was assigned to the subcategory ‘cell part’ (562) followed by ‘organelle’ (381), ‘organelle part’ (202), ‘macro molecule complex’ (158) and 75 TUSs were assigned to rest of the subcategories.Differentially expressed genes included those encoding proline-rich proteins, zinc finger proteins, leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase and RAS-related protein. There were seven TUSs that correspond to proline-rich protein. This protein forms a component of glutamate pathway and has multiple developmental and stress-related functions. High expression of this protein in leaves has been reported to play major role in the early stage of virus infection in soybean.28 The glutamate pathway assimilates nitrogen and produces glutamate, which then acts as a starting point for amino acid synthesis. A 5-fold up-regulation of this gene in resistant genotype (ICPL 2049) probably implicates its role in response to this stress. A gene for zinc finger protein showed an average of 5-fold differential expression in both SMD- and FW-responsive genotypes. This protein is a component of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways which are demonstrated to play an important role in regulating the gene expression in response to various biotic as well as abiotic stress in species such as Arabidopsis.29,30 MAPK pathways transduce a large variety of external signals, leading to a wide range of cellular responses, including growth, differentiation, inflammation and apoptosis. A total of six TUSs had homologies to leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase, and showed an average of 5-fold differential expression. The up-regulation of this gene (in the flavonoid pathway) is known to play an important role in defence against both biotic and abiotic stress by acting as a passive or inducible barrier against pathogens.31 A total of 21 TUSs showed homology to gene for RAS-related protein ARA-3. These TUSs were up-regulated 6-fold. This gene is involved in the ethylene-mediated signalling pathway, suggesting an important role in stress response.With an objective of identifying candidate genes for FW and SMD, as mentioned above, the common set of TUSs with =5 fold expression difference was identified in SMD- and FW-responsive genotypes, separately. From this, 99 common TUSs were found for FW-responsive genotypes and 13 for SMD-responsive genotypes. Functional characterization of these genes showed function for 51 FW-responsive TUSs and 3 SMD-responsive TUSs (oxygen-evolving enhancer protein, NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase and sedoheptulose-1,7-biphosphate). FW responsive TUSs include genes such as mannose-1-phosphate guanyltransferase, prolinedehydrogenase, cellulose synthase, pectinesterase inhibitor, superoxide dismutase [Fe] and vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein.Among FW-responsive genes were TUSs showing cellulose synthase homology. These genes are essential for secondary cell wall synthesis. Among the SMD-responsive TUSs, one showed homology to oxygen evolving enhancer protein, with an average 5-fold expression difference. These proteins are components of glycine-rich protein 3/wall-associated kinase. One TUS showed homology to a gene coding for NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase and was up-regulated in resistant with respect to susceptible genotypes for SMD. This is a common component for energy evolving pathways in the cell.Considering biotic stress responsive genes in common for FW and SMD, no TUS was found common at the threshold of =5 fold difference. When this threshold was decreased to =2 fold, the number of common TUSs across FW- and SMD-responsive genotypes was found to be 192. Of this set, 99 TUSs were functionally annotated and 93 were uncharacterized proteins. These annotated TUSs showed sequence similarity to several stress responsive genes such as zinc protein, aminocyclopropane carboxylate oxidase, cysteine protease and hexokinase. For example, two TAs showed homology to a gene corresponding to zinc finger protein and expressed with an average of 3.4-fold difference. As mentioned, this gene is a component of MAPK. TUSs with sequence similarity to gene for 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase were expressed with an average 3.3 folds. This gene is a component of ethylene-biosynthesis pathway which plays an important role in ethylene biosynthesis at stress conditions.32 TUSs with sequence similarity to gene for synthesis of germination-specific cysteine protease also showed an average of 3-fold difference in expression value, this gene is responsible for cell death hence regulating response to stress. Sequence similarity for another gene encoding for hexokinase-2 was also discovered for one TUS which showed an average-fold difference of 2.9. This gene is known to play a major role in metabolic pathways, e.g. fructose and mannose metabolism, galactose metabolism and glycolysis.Genes responding in the FW- and SMD-resistant lines will provide a rich basis for further explorations of the mechanisms of disease resistance for these important viral and fungal diseases, and may also be useful in identifying regulatory networks and targets for breeding efforts, As no controls (Illumina tags generated from non-challenged tissues) were used for identification for FW- and SMD-responsive genes, like recent studies in wheat (Triticum aestivum)33 and yam (Dioscorea alata L.)34, it is, therefore suggested to use other techniques like qRT–PCR to validate and establish magnitudes of expression levels of identified genes before they are used for further studies.3.4. Development of gene-based molecular markersGenetic markers are important tools for understanding variation, and for identification of gene/QTLs for traits of interest in molecular breeding activities. Until recently, a very limited number of genetic markers have been available for pigeonpea.35 One of the main reasons for the lack of mapping resources in pigeonpea is the low level of polymorphism. An approach to develop genetic markers is the mining of ESTs or transcript sequences for the presence of SSRs and SNPs.36 Although markers developed from ESTs/transcripts are less polymorphic, they have been found useful for assaying the functional diversity in the germplasm collection37,38, trait mapping27 and comparative genomics studies.39As microsatellite or SSR markers are the markers of choice for many plant breeding applications, the TUSs were analysed for identification and development of SSR markers. Analysis of 127 754 TUSs with the MISA search program21 identified 50 566 SSRs in 41 899 TUSs (32.7%), with a frequency of one SSR per 570 bp. In terms of abundance, mono-nucleotide repeats were most abundant (33 262, 65.7%) followed by di- (13 204, 26.1%) and tri-nucleotide repeats (3063, 6%). Other type of repeat units occurred at <1% each (Supplementary Table S5). SSRs were divided into perfect (i.e. SSRs containing a single repeat motif such as ‘AAG’) or compound (i.e. composed of two or more SSRs separated by =100 bp) SSRs. A total of 6350 (15.1%) compound SSRs were identified. The frequency of SSR repeat motifs was calculated after excluding the mono-nucleotide repeats. Among di-nucleotide repeats motifs, AG/CT was the most abundant with 46.8%; tri-nucleotide repeats motifs were rich in AAG/CTT (32.5%); and among tetra-, penta- and hexa- nucleotide repeat motifs, the most abundant repeats were AAAT/ATTT (24.1%), AAGGT/ATTCC (20.8%) and AAAAAG/CTTTTT (8.4%), respectively.With an objective of converting the identified SSRs into genetic markers, 9157 primer pairs were designed for all SSRs except mono-nucleotides. Recently, 3312 SSR markers have been designed for pigeonpea4–8,35. An analysis to determine overlap between the 9157 newly designed primer pairs and 3312 published SSR markers (using BLAST) identified 8137 primer pairs as novel SSR markers for pigeonpea (Supplementary Table S6). Validation of these SSR primer pairs, however, is required to determine their potential to amplify and to detect polymorphisms. In several crop species, SNP markers are becoming more popular because of their low cost and potential for automation.40In total, 150.8 million Illumina sequence tags were generated from 10 genotypes. For identification of SNPs, tags for two genotypes of a given mapping population were aligned with 127 754 TUSs (the pigeonpea transcriptome assembly), and variants were identified using the Alpheus program of NCGR.23 The number of SNPs in an individual cross ranged from 704 (BSMR 736 × TAT 10) to 6263 (ICPL 87119 × ICPL 87091) (Table 3). In total, 12 141 SNPs were identified; however, only six SNPs were found in common across three populations (ICPL 20096 × ICPL 332, ICPL 7035 × TTB7 and BSMR 736 × TAT 10). The number of common SNPs across any two mapping populations ranged from 8 (ICPL 99050 × ICPL 2049 and BSMR736 × TAT 10) and 39 (ICPL 87119 × ICPL 87091 and ICLP 20096 × ICPL 332). Although a large number of SNP genotyping platforms are available,36 depending on the need and requirements, most suitable platform can be selected for using the SNPs in pigeonpea genetics and breeding applications. For instance, GoldenGate assays of Illumina (www.illumina.com/) will offer high-throughput SNP genotyping while KASPar (www.kbioscience.co.uk) or cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) assays41 will allow low-cost SNP genotyping. Illumina sequencing based SNP discovery in five parental combinationsIllumina sequencing based SNP discovery in five parental combinationsIdentification of potential splice site was undertaken as an extension to the usability of data generated from 127 754 TUSs aligned against soybean genome sequence for development of genetic markers in pigeonpea. Thresholds were set to a minimum alignment length of 70 nucleotides, minimum query coverage of 90% and minimum per cent identity of 80%. A total of 8532 (6.0%) TUSs showed valid alignment with 8491 unique soybean loci, and having not more than 1000 bp gaps between aligned components. Alignment of these 8532 TUSs with one or more splice sites yielded 13 862 putative intron-spanning splice junctions. Alignment results were used for development of intron-spanning region (ISR) markers in silico for pigeonpea. These markers were derived for portions of genes and were designed from low copy sequences (sequences showing single match to the reference). In summary, a total of 5845 ISR primer pairs were designed across the pigeonpea genome (Supplementary Table S7). These potential ISR markers are also available as a GBrowse track at http://soybase.org/gbrowse/cgi-bin/gbrowse/gmax1.01. These ISR markers can be assayed on mutation detection enhancement (MDE) gel for detection of polymorphism.In summary, large-scale transcriptomic resource has been developed in an under-resourced crop species by deploying two prominent NGS technologies namely FLX/454 and Illumina IG sequencing. These transcript data have been used for both basic and applied aspects in pigeonpea genetics and breeding. Similarly, genes responsive to FW and SMD have been identified, and are ready for further study and validation. Additionally, a large number of molecular markers have been developed that will accelerate molecular mapping and molecular breeding activities for pigeonpea improvement.Supplementary dataSupplementary Data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis study was supported financially by SP2 Leader Discretionary Grant of CGIAR Generation Challenge Programme, Mexico; and Pigeonpea Genomics Initiative (PGI) of Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) of Government of India.The authors are thankful to Dr Pawan Kulwal, Dr Punjabrao Deshmukh Krishi Vishwavidalaya, Akola (India), for providing the seeds of some genotypes used in this study.Supplementary data"

The A. sojae NBRC4239 genome data will be useful to characterize functional features of the koji moulds used in Japanese industries.1. IntroductionKoji moulds are widely used in the production of traditional fermented foods and beverages such as Japanese miso, soy sauce, and sake. Two typical koji moulds, Aspergillus sojae and A. oryzae, are used. During the fermentation process, koji moulds act by breaking down the ingredients. Each species of koji moulds reacts differently to the ingredients used and must therefore be selected based on the desired product. For example, A. sojae is selected to produce miso and soy sauce due to its high proteolytic ability, and A. oryzae is used widely in sake, miso, and soy sauce production for its high amylolytic ability. Among Aspergillus strains deposited in the RIKEN Bioresource Center Japan Collection of Microorganisms (http://www.jcm.riken.jp/JCM/JCM_DB.shtm), 15 strains out of 53 in A. oryzae strains were derived from sake koji, 6 from miso, and 17 from soy sauce koji, while 16 strains out of 20 strains of A. sojae were derived from soy sauce koji.For taxonomic classification of Aspergillus species, molecular strategies have been developed to discriminate several Aspergillus species.1Aspergillusoryzae and A. sojae are classified in the Aspergillus section Flavi, which also includes plant pathogen A. flavus and A. parasiticus that produces aflatoxins known to be carcinogenic substances. The analysis based on restriction-site polymorphisms of genes coding for 11 proteins and sequences of five of those genes suggested that A. oryzae is a species derived from A. flavus through human handling.2 From a viewpoint of evolutionarily close relation of A. oryzae and A. sojae with pathogenic Aspergillus species, it is vital to distinguish between aflatoxin productive and non-productive moulds and to select the latter for industrial use. It has been reported that A. oryzae does not produce these substances from expressed sequence tag (EST) analysis of A. oryzae RIB40, in which many of the aflatoxin biosynthesis gene clusters were found to be unexpressed.3 For A. sojae, a termination point mutation in aflR which controls transcription of aflatoxin biosynthesis gene clusters and lack of the polyketide synthase (PKS) gene are correlated with its aflatoxin non-productivity.4The genome of A. oryzae RIB40 was recently completely sequenced and the comprehensive analysis showed that this strain possesses 134 protease genes including many paralogous genes and multiple copies of a-amylase and a-glucosidase genes.5 These genetic features may account for its high proteolytic and amylolytic abilities in A. oryzae RIB40.Many of the moulds classified in Aspergillus section Flavi are known to produce various secondary metabolites. The A. oryzae RIB40 genome encodes genes for numerous secondary metabolites other than aflatoxins,6 although EST and microarray analysis of A. oryzae RIB40 suggested that it has almost no productivity of secondary metabolites.7 These features of A. oryzae on the basis of quality, productivity, and safety may be one of the reasons for that A. oryzae strains have gradually been selected as industrially useful strains.8Though similar studies in A. sojae have not been conducted so much as A. oryzae, it is thought to be a domesticated strain selectively bred from natural strains as well as A. oryzae above.However, the whole genetic information of A. sojae is insufficient to investigate the functional features important for its industrial use including the protease and amylase activities as well as safety. Therefore, we conducted the whole-genome sequencing of the practical strain A. sojae NBRC4239 isolated from Japanese soy sauce koji by using the next generation sequencer 454 pyrosequencer. The genetic information of A. sojae NBRC4239, combined with that of A. oryzae, will synergistically provide the knowledge for deep understanding of the biological nature of industrially important koji mould and for its further development of usefulness in food science field.2. Materials and methods2.1. Strain and DNA preparationAspergillus sojae NBRC4239 was obtained from NBRC (http://www.nbrc.nite.go.jp/). This strain is a practical strain isolated from Japanese soy sauce koji.Aspergillus sojae NBRC4239 was incubated in PD liquid media (1% peptone, 2% dextrin, 0.5% KH2PO4, 0.1% NaNO3, 0.05% MgSO4, and 0.1% casamino acids, pH 6.0) on a shaker at 150 rpm at 30°C for 24 h. After collection on a mortar, mould was frozen in liquid nitrogen and then crushed with a pestle. The genome was extracted from this mould using a Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega Corporation, USA) and purified using a DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (QIAGEN Sciences, USA), according to the respective manufacturer's protocols.2.2. Genome sequencing and data assemblyFor GS FLX Titanium fragment sequencing, 500 ng of genomic DNA was sheared into DNA fragments ranging from 300 to 800 bp by nebulization. After both ends of the DNA fragments were repaired and phosphorylated, two types of adaptors (A and B) were ligated to the DNA fragments. Next, the DNA fragments carrying the 5'-biotin of adaptor B from the ligation mixture were immobilized onto magnetic streptavidin-coated beads. The single-stranded template DNA (ssDNA) molecules carrying Adaptor A at 5'-end and Adaptor B at 3'-end were isolated by alkaline denaturation. These purified ssDNAs were then hybridized to DNA capture beads and clonally amplified by an emulsion polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. After denaturation of the amplified double-stranded DNAs on the capture beads, these beads with single-stranded molecules were spread onto each well of a pico titre plate. For GS FLX Titanium Paired-end sequencing, 15 µg of genomic DNA was sheared into DNA fragments ranging from ~8 kb by fragmentation. After the ends of the DNA fragments were repaired and internal adaptors were ligated to the DNA fragments, each DNA fragment was circularized and self-ligated. The circular DNA was sheared into DNA fragments ranging from 300 to 800 bp by nebulization. The DNA fragments carrying the 5'-biotin of internal adaptor from the ligation mixture were immobilized onto magnetic streptavidin-coated beads. Paired-end sequencing was carried out similar to the method described above. Two sequencing runs in total were carried out. The GS FLX sequence data were assembled using Newbler assembly software.2.3. Gene prediction and annotationGlimmerHMM,9 AUGUSTUS,10,11 SNAP,12 and GeneMark + ES13 were used as ab initio predictors, and Genewise14 was used as the evidence-based predictor. The ab initio GlimmerHMM, AUGUSTUS, and SNAP parameters were trained on all A. oryzae RIB40 gene models, while GeneMark + ES performed an iterative self-training procedure. The amino acid sequence of A. oryzae RIB40 was used for alignment by Genewise. GFF files obtained from these prediction programmes were incorporated by Evigan15 to produce prediction results. Out of the predicted open reading frames (ORFs), those with more than 100 amino acid residues were selected as predictor genes.Amino acid sequences of the predictor genes were matched with non-redundant protein database (nr, NCBI) by BLAST16 and were annotated based on identity. tRNA were predicted by tRNAscan-SE.172.4. Comparative genomicsNucleotide and amino acid sequences of A. oryzae RIB40 were obtained from DOGAN (http://www.nbrc.nite.go.jp/dogan/). Nucleotide and amino acid sequences of A. flavus NRRL3357, A. fumigatus Af293, and A. nidulans FGSC A4 were obtained from the Aspergillus Genome Database (AspGD).18 Putative domains were predicted with the HMMER19 programme hmmscan using the hidden Markov models from the pfam database.20 For A. oryzae RIB40, A. flavus NRRL3357, A. fumigatus Af293, and A. nidulans FGSC A4, ORFs with Pfam domain scores of >150 were subject to comparison.A domain list for protease was created by matching amino acid sequences registered in MEROPS21 with the HMMER from the Pfam database. Based on this list, amino acid sequences with protease domain scores >150 were compared between A. sojae NBRC4239 and A. oryzae RIB40. For phylogenetic analysis, multiple alignments were carried out by ClustalX22 and phylogenic trees were drawn with TreeView.23It is known that out of the glycoside hydrolases, families 13, 15, and 31 are involved in amylolysis. Entries of glycoside hydrolase belonging to these three families in relation to A. oryzae RIB40 were extracted from the Carbohydrate Active Enzyme (CAZy) database.24 From these data, amylolytic enzymes possessed by A. sojae NBRC4239 strains were predicted. Furthermore, for these predicted amylolytic enzymes, checks were made to confirm the presence of active centre residues (data not shown). Alignment of nucleotide and amino acid sequences were carried out by GENETYX, and BLAST was used for homology searches. PCR primer sequences used for partial nucleotide sequence checks are shown in Supplementary Table S1.Sequences of secondary metabolite gene clusters in A. oryzae RIB40 were obtained from the Secondary Metabolite Unknown Region Finder (SMURF) database.25 Cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) biosynthesis gene cluster sequences of A. flavus were obtained from Broad Institute (http://www.broadinstitute.org/annotation/genome/Aspergillus_group) with reference to reports by Chang et al.26 Sequences near the aflatrem gene clusters in A. flavus and A. oryzae were obtained from reports by Nicholson et al.,27 where the sequences for A. flavus NRRL3357 and A. oryzae RIB40 were obtained from Broad Institute and DOGAN, respectively. For A. flavus NRRL6541, sequences ATM1 (AY559849.2 GI:161621808) and ATM2 (AM921700.1 GI:162286818) entered in GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank) were used. Harr plots were generated by In silico Molecular Cloning Series IMC, genomics edition (In Silico Biology, Inc.). PCR primer sequences used for partial nucleotide sequence checks are shown in Supplementary Table S2.2.5. Accession numbersNucleotide sequence data were entered into the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank DNA databases. Accession numbers for the 65 scaffold sequences are DF093557–DF093585 and for the 1034 contig sequences are BACA01000001– BACA01001034.3. Results and discussion3.1. Sequencing and assemblyWe obtained 1034 contigs (>100 bp) and 65 scaffolds by assembling the reads obtained from sequencing (Supplementary Table S3). The 65 scaffolds are composed of 557 contigs, thus 477 contigs did not make up scaffolds. Out of the 1034 contigs, 707 were >500 bp. Total length of the contigs and scaffolds each exceeded 39 Mb. As the genome size reported for A. oryzae RIB40 is 37.6 Mb,5 the genome of A. sojae NBRC4239 was predicted to exceed that of A. oryzae RIB40.3.2. Gene prediction and annotationORF prediction was carried out on the 65 scaffolds and the 477 contigs that did not make up scaffolds. As a result, we obtained 13 033 ORFs with amino acid residues >100. Also, 275 tRNAs were predicted by tRNAscan-SE. Table 1 showed the comparison of ORFs of A. oryzae RIB40 and A. sojae NBRC4239. Comparison of ORFs of A. oryzae RIB40 and A. sojae NBRC4239The methods of the sequencing and the ORF prediction procedure were different in A. oryzae and A. sojae, and the value 101, the minimum size, just indicated the artificial value for cutoff.Comparison of ORFs of A. oryzae RIB40 and A. sojae NBRC4239The methods of the sequencing and the ORF prediction procedure were different in A. oryzae and A. sojae, and the value 101, the minimum size, just indicated the artificial value for cutoff.3.3. Comparative genomicsThe proportion of ORFs with Pfam domain scores of >150 was 2847/13 033 (21.8%) for A. sojae NBRC4239, 2868/12 074 (23.8%) for A. oryzae RIB40, 2880/12 604 (22.9%) for A. flavus NRRL3357, 2517/9887 (25.5%) for A. fumigatus Af293, and 2641/11 272 (23.4%) for A. nidulans FGSC A4.ORFs with Pfam domain scores of  >150 were compared between A. sojae NBRC4239 and A. oryzae RIB40 by BLASTP, and it was found that 2326/2847 (81.7%) had >90% identity (Supplementary Fig. S1a). Next, 397/2847 ORFs from A. sojae NBRC4239 were found to have <70% identity with those from A. oryzae RIB40. Of those, 134 ORFs had >90% identity and 192 ORFs had <70% identity in the nucleotide sequence to the corresponding regions in A. oryzae RIB40 by tBLASTN. Therefore, the 134 ORFs found in A. sojae NBRC4239 may have been missed in the gene prediction of A. oryzae RIB40, and the orthologous ORFs to the 192 ORFs may be absent in A. oryzae RIB40. These 192 ORFs in A. sojae NBRC4239 were matched with A. flavus NRRL3357 genes with domain scores >150 using BLASTP. As a result, 22 had >90% identity and 170 had <70% identity. These results indicated that the 22 ORFs are present in both A. sojae NBRC4239 and A. flavus NRRL3357 but absent in A. oryzae RIB40. The 170 ORFs with <70% identity were matched with nr of the NCBI database by BLASTP, and 132 ORFs were found to have <70% identity. Thus, these 132 ORFs may be unique to A. sojae NBRC4239 (Supplementary Fig. S1b).Out of the 2847 ORFs of A. sojae NBRC4239 and 2868 of A. oryzae RIB40, 83 ORFs in A. oryzae RIB40 and 76 in A. sojae NBRC4239 had protease domain scores >150; thus, A. sojae NBRC4239 had seven fewer ORFs. The total number of predicted protease genes in A. oryzae RIB40 was considerably less than the reported 134,5 and this difference is likely due to the strict domain score set at >150.ORFs with domain scores >150 from A. sojae NBRC4239 and A. oryzae RIB40 were sorted and compared by domains. The number of proteases with specific domains was not very different in either species. Four types of proteases in A. sojae NBRC4239 had one more gene than those in A. oryzae RIB40, respectively. Eleven types of proteases in A. sojae NBRC4239 had one gene less than those in A. oryzae RIB40, respectively. In both A. oryzae RIB40 and A. sojae NBRC4239, serine carboxypeptidases were most abundant, followed by aspartic proteases. Aspergillus sojae NBRC4239 had 13 serine carboxypeptidases, which was one more than A. oryzae RIB40, and it had seven aspartic proteases which was two less than A. oryzae RIB40.Under the strict condition of protease domain scores >150, we found no significant difference in the number of protease genes between the two species. However, by using a less strict condition, a difference in the number of protease genes may be observed between A. sojae and A. oryzae.Phylogenic tree for serine carboxypeptidases based on sequences with domain scores >150 was constructed and then compared for A. sojae NBRC4239, A. oryzae RIB40, A. flavus NRRL3357, A. fumigatus Af293, and A. nidulans FGSC A4 (Fig. 1). We found that A. sojae NBRC4239 possesses a serine carboxypeptidase gene (scaffold00048.369) that has low sequence similarity with the other four species. This gene was also included in the 132 ORFs that had <70% identity against nr (refer to the ‘Comparative genomics’ section). The similarity search of scaffold00048.369 against the ORFs of A. oryzae RIB40 by BLASTP identified a gene AO090103000026 with the closest match of 56% identity. AO090103000026 was annotated as a serine carboxypeptidase in A. oryzae RIB40 (Fig. 1). In addition, Scaffold00048.369 was found to have the highest similarity to carboxypeptidase S1 in Neosartorya fischeri NRRL181 with 58% identity by searching against the nr NCBI database by BLASTP. From these results, scaffold00048.369 is likely to be a serine carboxypeptidase unique to A. sojae NBRC4239. We confirmed the expression of scaffold00048.369 by RT–PCR for mRNA isolated from A. sojae NBRC4239 incubated in wheat bran media. The sequencing of the RT–PCR product revealed a sequence identical to the predicted ORF, indicating that our ORF prediction for scaffold00048.36 was correct, and this gene is expressed in wheat bran media (data not shown). Phylogenic analysis of serine carboxypeptidase in five Aspergillus species.

Red shows the gene unique to A. sojae. Oranges show extra homologues in A. oryzae reported in Machida et al.6Phylogenic analysis showed that serine carboxypeptidase genes are classified into five clusters that are in common with the five Aspergillus species (C1–5), and seven clusters that are in common only with three species of Aspergillus section Flavi (F1–7). Three of the five common clusters contained serine carboxypeptidase genes that are unique to Aspergillus section Flavi, in addition to the putative orthologous genes. The serine carboxypeptidases unique to A. oryzae RIB40 previously reported6 are therefore considered to be in common with the Aspergillus section Flavi. It is conceivable that A. sojae and A. oryzae have been used widely in miso and soy sauce fermentation because of their possession of highly similar protease genes.Phylogenic tree for aspartic proteases based on sequences with domain scores of >150 was constructed and then compared for A. sojae NBRC4239, A. oryzae RIB40, A. flavus NRRL3357, A. fumigatus Af293, and A. nidulans FGSC A4 (Fig. 2). We found that A. sojae NBRC4239 possesses an aspartic protease gene (scaffold00063.1451) that showed low in sequence similarity with those in the other four species. This gene was also included in the 132 ORFs that had <70% identity against nr (refer to the ‘Comparative genomics’ section). Scaffold00063.1451 was searched against the ORFs of A. oryzae RIB40 by BLASTP, and AO090701000002 was found to be the closest gene with 33% identity. AO090701000002 was annotated as an aspartic protease in A. oryzae RIB40 (Fig. 2). Similarity search of scaffold00063.1451 identified yapsin of Penicillium marneffei ATCC18224 with the highest similarity of 46% identity against the nr NCBI database by BLASTP. From these results, scaffold00063.1451 is likely to be an aspartic protease unique to A. sojae NBRC4239. We confirmed the expression of scaffold00063.1451 by RT–PCR followed by sequencing, as described in the ‘Serine carboxypeptidase' section, indicating that our ORF prediction for scaffold00063.1451 was correct, and this gene is expressed in wheat bran media (data not shown).

Oranges show extra homologues in A. oryzae reported in Machida et al.6Phylogenic analysis showed that aspartic protease genes are classified into four clusters that are in common with the five Aspergillus species (C1–4). Only one cluster was in common with only the three species belonging to Aspergillus section Flavi (F1), and other three clusters were shared with two of the three species. These data suggested that aspartic protease genes are less conserved among Aspergillus section Flavi, in contrast to serine carboxypeptidase genes.It is known in general that A. sojae has lower amylolytic activity compared with A. oryzae. We studied the genes for amylolytic enzymes in A. oryzae RIB40 and A. sojae NBRC4239 to analyse this difference. First, we compared the number of glycoside hydrolases belonging to Family 13, 15, and 31 in both strains, respectively (Supplementary Table S4). We found no difference in gene numbers of glycoside hydrolases between A. sojae and A. oryzae for Family 31 including a-glucosidase (EC.3.2.1.20), and for Family 15 including glucoamylase (EC.3.2.1.3). Thus, there is unlikely to be a difference in these enzymatic activities between the two Aspergillus strains. In contrast, we found that A. sojae has two copies less glycoside hydrolases in Family 13 including a-amylase (EC.3.2.1.1) than those in A. oryzae. Missing of the two genes in A. sojae was due to the copy number variation between the two strains; A. sojae only has one copy of amyB compared with the three copies (AO090023000944: amy1, AO090120000196: amy2, and AO090003001210: amy3) in A. oryzae.28 In A. oryzae, amyB codes for so-called Taka-amylase, which is important for amylolysis. Therefore, a decreased copy number of amyB orthologues in A. sojae likely accounts for the lower amylolytic ability of A. sojae than that of A. oryzae.The above-mentioned three a-amylase genes and their flanking 20-kb regions of A. oryzae were further compared with the corresponding regions in A. sojae NBRC4239 scaffolds. We investigated whether the difference in a-amylase gene copy numbers results from the difference in genomic structures. The results are shown in Fig. 3. In the A. sojae amy1 region, the 12.5-kb sequence including 2.2 kb of amy1 ORF, and its promoter and terminator regions were absent. Instead of the 12.5-kb region, a unique 2.9-kb sequence excluding amy1 was present. This was also the case for amy2, where the 12.4-kb region including amy2 ORF, and its promoter and terminator regions were absent, but a sequence unique as observed in the amy1 region was not present in amy2. Furthermore, a 7.2-kb region was also absent and an inverted region was observed near the missing amy2 regions in A. sojae. These results indicated that this region of the A. sojae genome was structurally rearranged. In the amy3 region, we found that amy3 structural genes and its terminator regions were conserved between A. oryzae and A. sojae. However, a 1.9-kb insertion sequence was found at 0.53 kb upstream of the translation initiation site in the A. oryzae amy3 promoter. Comparison of a-amylase genes and their flanking regions.

Grey box, conserved regions; shaded box, regions unique to A. sojae; white box, regions unique to A. oryzae ; black box, inversed regions; black arrow, a-amylase gene ORF; black triangle, PCR primer-binding site.We therefore confirmed that the genomic structures of the a-amylase regions predicted from genome analysis were correct for this strain by PCR (Supplementary Fig. S2). These results indicate that the difference in copy numbers of a-amylase genes between A. sojae NBRC4239 and A. oryzae RIB40 is a result of a rearrangement in genomic structure.We investigated transposons existing near the a-amylase genes in A. oryzae and A. sojae (Fig. 4A). We found that the ~1.9-kb insertion sequence locating upstream the A. oryzae amy3 promoter is a transposon Tao1 (DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank accession number: AB021710.1). This transposon was flanked by inverted repeat sequences characteristic to ClassII DNA transposons (Fig. 4A).29 The Tao1 insertion site at the A. oryzae amy3 promoter region was found to correspond to the ‘TA’ sequence in the -533 to -532 region upstream the A. sojae amy3 promoter. This is consistent with that ClassII transposons tend to be preferentially integrated at a TA sequence, resulting in target site TA duplication on both flanking of the integrated transposon.29 The Tao1 is located at the further upstream of the amylase transcription factor AmyR recognition site30 and the CreA recognition sites31 involved in carbon catabolite repression (Fig. 4B). It is not clear whether Tao1 insertion affects the expression of the A. oryzae amy3 gene or not, and further study will be needed to clarify the effect of Tao1 insertion.

(A) Expected insertion site of A. oryzae Tao1 transposon. (B) Map of transposons surrounding A. oryzae and A. sojae a-amylase genes.The Tao1 transposon was also present within the promoters of amy1 and amy2 of A. oryzae. The insertion sites were identical to amy3 insertion (Fig. 4A). However, Tao1 inserted in the amy1 and amy2 promoters were largely truncated and only partial sequences of 575 bp at the 3'-end of the total 1.9 kb sequence were left. The truncation of Tao1 in amy1 and amy2 have occurred after triplication of the single amy gene having Tao1 transposon, which inserted in the A. oryzae lineage after divergence of A. sojae from the common ancestor.We also found a 981-bp ORF similar to Ant1 transposase near amy1 and amy2 of A. oryzae. Ant1 transposon is a member of ClassII DNA transposon classified in the Tc1/mariner group,29,32 and Ant1 in A. niger is reported to have transfer activity.33 The corresponding Ant1 transposase homologues were not found in the downstream regions of amy3 of A. oryzae or amyA of A. sojae.As shown above, several transposons, such as Tao1 and Ant1 transposase homologue, were found near the three a-amylase genes of A. oryzae, but were absent around amyA of A. sojae. The mechanism for the multiplication of a-amylase gene in A. oryzae is unclear, but these transposons might have a crucial role for the amylase gene multiplication in A. oryzae. The difference in a-amylase gene copy numbers might result in the difference in amylolytic activity between the two strains. This is likely to be a major factor for why A. oryzae became widely used in industry, such as in fermentation of sake, soy sauce, and miso, whereas A. sojae became used solely for soy sauce fermentation.The 56 secondary metabolite cluster sequences were predicted using SMURF in the A. oryzae RIB40 genome.25 We analysed these clusters for the A. sojae NBRC4239 genome by Harr plots. Out of the 56 predicted secondary metabolite clusters, 24 clusters were found to be almost identical and the remaining 32 clusters differed from those in A. oryzae RIB40 (Supplementary Table S5). Aspergillus sojae NBRC4239 had no sequence homologous to Cluster 51 located on the end of chromosome 5 in A. oryzae. In addition, large portions of Clusters 38 (non-ribosomal peptide synthetase: NRPS) and 47 (NRPS) were missing in A. sojae NBRC4239 (Fig. 5). For Cluster 38, A. sojae NBRC4239 had a replaced 363-bp sequence and a sequence containing the 5' portion of 460 bp and the 3' portion of 2.9 kb generated by a deletion of 23 188 bp from the 26 571 bp (SC026: 1081838–1108408) predicted in A. oryzae RIB40 (Fig. 5A). For Cluster 47, the 3' portion of 14 kb in 30 338 bp (SC102: 1249352–1279689) predicted in A. oryzae RIB40 was replaced by unrelated 17-kb sequence (Fig. 5B). Also, small deletions and insertions were observed in the remaining 29 clusters (data not shown). Comparison of A. oryzae predicted secondary metabolite clusters with A. sojae. Secondary metabolite Clusters 38 (A) and 47 (B) which were predicted from A. oryzae RIB40 by SMURF were compared with sequences in A. sojaeNBRC4239 by Harr plots.Comparison of A. oryzae predicted secondary metabolite clusters with A. sojae. Secondary metabolite Clusters 38 (A) and 47 (B) which were predicted from A. oryzae RIB40 by SMURF were compared with sequences in A. sojaeNBRC4239 by Harr plots.Unlike Cluster 51 (PKS) located near the end of chromosome 5 (SC113: 1828103-1841684) in A. oryzae RIB40, missing of the equivalent cluster to Cluster 51 in A. sojae NBRC4239 may be partly explained by the instability of the region near the chromosome end in A. sojae NBRC4239. On the other hand, Clusters 38 and 47 in A. oryzae RIB40, of which equivalent clusters that had large deleted portions in A. sojae NBRC4239 are located near the centre of arm of chromosome 3 (SC26: 1081838–1108408 of 2 324 132 bp) and near the centromere of chromosome 4 (SC102: 1249352–1279689 of 1 779 707 bp), respectively. Therefore, the reasons for the depletion of these secondary metabolite gene clusters may be different from that for missing of the equivalent cluster to Cluster 51 at the chromosomal end.Gene cluster regions for CPA biosynthesis in A. flavus and A. oryzae were analysed for genomes of A. sojae NBRC4239, A. flavus NRRL3357, and A. oryzae RIB40 by BLASTN.34 The results are shown in Fig. 6. In A. flavus and A. oryzae, CPA clusters were found at the end of chromosome 3, next to the aflatoxin biosynthesis gene clusters (Fig. 6). Genes mfs1, mao1, dmaT, Pks-nrps, and cttr1 shown in the figure are considered to be involved in CPA biosynthesis. Since the large portion of Pks-nrps at the telomere side is deleted, CPA cannot be synthesized in A. oryzae RIB40.34 On the other hand, 18 508 bp of the CPA biosynthesis cluster region was found to be deleted in A. sojae NBRC4239, thus most of the mfs1, mao1, dmaT, and Pks-nrps sequences were missing (Fig. 6). Furthermore, a 7653-bp sequence including ord1, ord2, and ord3 is present 25 kb distant from the CPA cluster toward the telomere side in A. flavus. This sequence was found to be inserted inversely next to the missing CPA gene cluster in A. sojae. Comparison of CPA biosynthesis gene cluster regions between A. sojae NBRC4239, A. flavus NRRL3357, and A. oryzae RIB40. Nucleotide sequences of CPA biosynthesis gene cluster regions were compared between A. sojae NBRC4239, A. flavus NRRL3357, and A. oryzae RIB40 by BLASTN and are presented diagrammatically.Comparison of CPA biosynthesis gene cluster regions between A. sojae NBRC4239, A. flavus NRRL3357, and A. oryzae RIB40. Nucleotide sequences of CPA biosynthesis gene cluster regions were compared between A. sojae NBRC4239, A. flavus NRRL3357, and A. oryzae RIB40 by BLASTN and are presented diagrammatically.PCR was carried out to confirm the missing A. sojae CPA biosynthesis gene cluster region and the inverted insert (Supplementary Fig. S3). These results confirmed the 18.5-kb deletion and the inverted 7.6-kb insertion found in the A. sojae NBRC4239 genome.In addition to the finding of complete deletion of mfs1, mao1, and dmaT, the present analysis also found the deletion of a promoter and the half of the ORF containing the ketoacyl synthase (KR) domain and the acyltransferase (AT) domain for Pks-nrps in A. sojae. The genes mao1, dmaT, and Pks-nrps are essential for CPA biosynthesis in A. flavus.26 Therefore, the present data lead to the conclusion that A. sojae is unable to produce CPA, which also verifies the safety of A. sojae for use in industry.The A. sojae genome was analysed for the aflatrem biosynthesis gene cluster found in A. flavus.27 Aflatrem biosynthesis genes in A. flavus are known to consist of genes required to synthesize the intermediate paspaline (atmG, atmC, atmM, and atmB) as well as genes required to convert paspaline to aflatrem (atmP, atmQ, and atmD), which are encoded at two separate loci ATM1 and ATM2 in A. flavus, respectively.27 ATM1 (34 816 bp) and ATM2 (25 256 bp) were analysed for the A. oryzae and A. sojae genomes by BLASTN. We found almost identical sequences to ATM1 and ATM2 with a few base substitutions in A. oryzae. In contrast, five gaps with >100 bp were found in the corresponding region to ATM1 locus in A. sojae (Fig. 7A). In Gap 4, a 1140-bp sequence in A. flavus was replaced by unrelated 6138-bp sequence in A. sojae (Fig. 7A). Nine gaps with >100 bp were also observed in the corresponding region to ATM2 locus in A. sojae (Fig. 7B). In Gap 7, a 2761-bp sequence in A. flavus was replaced by unrelated 11 493-bp sequence in A. sojae (Fig. 7B). All these gaps found in A. sojae were present in the non-coding regions. A frameshift due to single base insertion in exon 7 of atmQ was reported to account for the non-productivity of aflatrem in A. oryzae,27 but such mutation was not found in A. sojae in this study. The presence of insertions in A. sojae NBRC4239 was confirmed by PCR (Supplementary Fig. S4). Comparison of aflatrem cluster regions in A. sojae NBRC4239 and A. flavus. Diagram of aflatrem cluster sequence comparison between A. flavus NRRL3357 and A. sojae NBRC4239 strains. (A) ATM1 region. (B) ATM2 region.Comparison of aflatrem cluster regions in A. sojae NBRC4239 and A. flavus. Diagram of aflatrem cluster sequence comparison between A. flavus NRRL3357 and A. sojae NBRC4239 strains. (A) ATM1 region. (B) ATM2 region.In this study, we showed that A. sojae NBRC4239 had many differences in ATM1 and ATM2 loci including deletions and insertion of unrelated sequences in comparison with those in A. oryzae and A. flavus, where both loci are well conserved. In addition to these differences, more than 10 gaps <100 bp were also observed in the corresponding loci in A. sojae NBRC4239 (data not shown). As described above, all the 14 gaps were present in the non-coding regions in A. sojae. To date, production of aflatrem in A. sojae has not been reported but the present study did not provide the evidence for aflatrem non-productivity from the sequence information. Further analysis will be needed to solve this discrepancy on the aflatrem production in A. sojae.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available online at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.We thank S.W.

IntroductionThe neutral theory of molecular evolution1,2 predicts that synonymous sites of codons are evolving faster than non-synonymous sites because of the smaller selective pressure. This is true in general; however, several factors are known to influence on a certain region of a coding sequence and suppress synonymous substitution.One of the well-known factors is the codon bias towards optimum codons. Optimum codons reflect the composition of genomic tRNA pool.3–5 Because optimum codons are advantageous for fast and accurate translation, highly expressed or biologically important genes would have more optimum codons than others.6–8 Changes from an optimum codon to a non-optimum codon will be suppressed in such genes. Because optimum codons are similar in closely related species, highly expressed genes tend to show similar codon usage; therefore synonymous substitution is lowered. In fact, the requirement for translational efficiency or accuracy enhances the optimum codon usage and suppresses nucleotide changes through purifying selection.5,6,9–11 Codon bias towards optimum codons is strong in fast-growing organisms such as Escherichia coli or Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but generally weak in species with slow growth rate small population size.12,13Another factor is exonic splicing enhancer or silencer, which are splicing signals embedded in exons.14,15 Existence of such elements lowers the synonymous substitution.16,17 In addition, ultraconserved elements (UCEs), which majorly reside in non-protein coding regions, sometimes extend to coding regions.18 In mammals, UCEs are reported to exist near to or overlap with genes associated with nucleotide binding, transcriptional regulation, RNA recognition motif, zinc finger domain, and homeobox domain.18–20 Hox genes also contain long conserved nucleotide regions other than UCEs outside the homeobox domain.21Although the primary role of protein coding region is to encode amino acids, there may be also functional nucleotide elements embedded within coding regions. For example, transcription-factor-binding sites are found in coding regions,22 messenger RNAs are targeted by various post-transcriptional regulations,23 and the requirement for a specific secondary structure for RNA editing decreases synonymous substitution.24,25Functional nucleotide elements are extensively explored in the non-coding regions,26–30 but less studies have been done to explore probable functional elements within the coding regions. We extracted significantly conserved coding sequences (SCCSs) from orthologous genes of six mammalian species (human, rhesus macaque, mouse, rat, cow, and dog), and compared genes containing SCCSs and genes without SCCSs. Analyses on gene ontology (GO), InterPro codes, and KEGG pathways enlighten difference between the two gene groups. We also investigated RNA secondary structures, codon preference, GC content, exonic splicing signals, and gene expression of SCCSs to survey the influence of these factors.2. Materials and methods2.1. Genome dataWe obtained peptide and nucleotide sequences of orthologous genes of six mammalian species (Homo sapiens, Macaca mulatta, Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, Bos taurus, and Canis familiaris) from Ensembl database31 version 54 (http://May2009.archive.ensembl.org/index.html). These species are selected considering genome data quality and evolutionary diversity. We selected one-to-one type single copy orthologs and compiled 10 790 orthologous gene sets (Supplementary file S1). We then constructed multiple alignments of peptide sequences using ClustalW32 and constructed nucleotide alignments based on the peptide alignments. From the nucleotide alignments, we extracted sequences that are invariant among all the species.2.2. Identification of SCCSsWe performed permutation simulation to identify SCCSs, or abbreviated as SCCSs, which are invariant longer than 10 codons. This length is set to confine the permutation run time within a feasible range. For an N-codon long alignment, we generated a non-redundant series of random numbers from 1 to N, and permuted codon columns (rows of codons in the same site of the alignment) according to the generated random numbers. In this process, gap sites are fixed and the rest of the sites are permuted. Then the length and numbers of invariant sequences in the permuted alignment are counted. We repeated this process 500 000 times per ortholog set and took averages of the frequency of invariant sequences. We used the length and averaged frequency of invariant sequences obtained from the permutation results as random expectation, and evaluated the probability of invariant sequences in the original alignment based on the expectation. This approach helps identify sequences whose conservation is rare to occur in the substitution background of each alignment. Multiple testing correction of p-values is done by FDR (false discovery rate).33 Then we identified invariant sequences longer than 10 codons and P < 0.01 as SCCSs.2.3. Analysis on GO, InterPro, and KEGG pathwaysProtein coding genes that contain at least one SCCS is named SCCS genes and those that do not contain an SCCS is named non-SCCS genes. We used Fatigo web service (http://babelomics.bioinfo.cipf.es/functional.html) to identify GO terms, InterPro codes, and KEGG pathways that are significantly enriched with the SCCS gene group or with the non-SCCS gene group. Fatigo accepts a list of Ensembl gene IDs as input and provides P-values for enrichment of the above terms. P-values are calculated by Fisher's exact test and corrected by FDR. We used Ensembl gene IDs of H. sapiens as input and performed two-tailed comparison between SCCS genes and non-SCCS genes.2.4. Analysis on preferred codons and average codon degeneracy of SCCSsWe defined preferred codons as the most frequently used codons for a given amino acid referring to Codon Usage Database (http://www.kazusa.or.jp/codon/index.html) provided by Kazusa DNA Research Institute. Because the codon usage pattern was similar among the six species we used, the codon table of human was used as the representative. We counted the number of preferred codons in a SCCS and divided it by the codon length of the SCCS, and then used the quotient as the ratio of preferred codons. The average codon degeneracy is calculated by summing up the degeneracy of each codon and dividing it by the codon length of the SCCS.2.5. Prediction of RNA secondary structuresWe computationally predicted secondary structures and free folding energy of SCCSs using Vienna RNA software package34 (http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/~ivo/RNA/). Because folding free energy varies depending on the sequence length, we constructed free energy distribution by 1000 randomly chosen sequences for each length (33–246 nucleotides). The P-value for a given free energy was evaluated based on these distributions. Multi testing correction is done by FDR.2.6. Evaluation of exonic splicing enhancer densityWe obtained 238 hexamers from RESCUE-ESE Web Server34 as candidates of exonic splicing enhancers. We counted the number of the hexamers in the SCCSs and the rest of the coding regions of the 10 790 genes (human sequences). We also measured the total nucleotide length of the SCCS and the other regions and applied the chi-square test for the ratio of hexamers.2.7. Analysis on gene expressionWe used EGenetics (http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/your_health/egenetics/index.htm) to investigate gene expression of SCCS genes and non-SCCS genes. Human anatomical system data, which give information about in which organs a gene is expressed, were obtained from EGenetics database by Ensemble Biomart. We counted how many of SCCS genes and non-SCCS genes are expressed in each organ and divided the numbers by the total number of SCCS genes and non-SCCS genes, respectively. Then we performed the Fisher's exact test to evaluate whether the difference between SCCS and non-SCCS genes is significant. All P-values were corrected by FDR.3. Results3.1. Identification of SCCSsIf an alignment has a high ratio of conservation, long invariant sequences may occur easily, and vice versa. Therefore, the rareness of invariant sequences differs depending on the conservation background in each alignment. To compensate this, we performed permutation simulation. The idea of permutation is to count the length and frequency of invariant sequences after random change of loci and use the result as the random expectation.We used the frequency distribution of invariant sequences in the permuted alignments as the random expectation and evaluated probability of invariant sequences in the original alignments, and defined invariant sequences longer than 10 codons and whose probability is below 0.01 (corrected by FDR) as SCCSs.In total, 4150 SCCSs (192 306 bp) were obtained from 2273 alignments of 10 790 orthologous gene sets (Supplementary file S2). This occupies 0.94% of the coding region of the 10 790 genes. Table 1 shows the number of SCCSs per gene and the number of genes that contain that number of SCCSs. Figure 1 is a graph of lengths and numbers of SCCSs (grey bars). Black dots indicate the random expectation obtained from the permuted alignments.

X and Y-axes represent the length and frequency of SCCSs, respectively. Grey bars show the length and the number of SCCSs. Black dots indicate the number of sequences with probability below 0.01 in the permuted alignments.In the permuted alignments, there are 141 sequences (their total length is 5550 bp) whose probability is below 0.01, which means the region size of SCCS is 35-fold larger than this expectation (Supplementary file S3). The <U+03C7>2 test between SCCSs and the permutation result showed a significant difference (P < 2.2E-16).If invariant and variant sites distributed randomly in the original alignment, the frequency of invariant sequences in the permuted alignments would show similar frequency to the original alignment because of the randomness at the start point. The difference before and after the permutation suggests that the distribution of invariant sites in the original alignments is rather clustered than being random.3.2. GO, InterPro, and KEGG pathways enriched in SCCS containing genesWe used Fatigo web service to investigate difference in GO, InterPro codes, and KEGG pathways between the SCCS genes and non-SCCS genes. The difference was evaluated by the two-tailed Fisher's test, and P-values were corrected by FDR.

One term of Cellular components (GO:0014704) mediate mechanical and electrochemical integration between cardiomyocytes and the rest of the five (GO:0043198, GO:0030425, GO:0043025, GO:0015629, and GO:0043005) have an association with the neuron. In the molecular function category, three terms (GO:0004843, GO:0031625, and GO:0004221) are related to the ubiquitin system, two (GO:00042054 and GO:00003682) are associated with chromatin. Ubiquitins are known to be involved not only with protein degeneration but also with signal transduction, chromatin modification, and cell cycle.Of the ten Interpro codes listed in Table 3, IPR001827 is related to ubiquitin and IPR002077 represents calcium channel and other eight are all associated with DNA or RNA-binding functions that mediate transcriptional regulation or chromatin modification.Tow KEGG pathways (hsa04340 and hsa04310) in Table 3 are developmental signalling pathways, hsa04120 is related to the ubiquitin system, and hsa04360 is involved in axon guidance, which well corresponds with the GO and Interpro terms.Table 4 shows the terms that are significantly scarce in SCCS genes. In contrast to Tables 2 and 3, majority of the terms are involved with metabolic processes.

Overlap with UCEsUCEs are defined as nucleotide sequences that are absolutely conserved longer than 200 bp between orthologous regions of the human, rat and mouse.18,19 UCEs are found in both coding and non-coding regions. Precedent studies report that genes with low synonymous substitution or genes overlapped with UCEs are associated with DNA binding, RNA binding, transcription activity, and Homeobox.18,19 In our 10 790 genes, 4009 bp in 29 genes are found to overlap with UCEs. In the 4009 bp region, 2835 bp in 22 genes overlap with SCCSs (Supplementary file S4). Because SCCSs are conserved in six mammalian species, including the three species referred for UCEs, the 2835 bp reflect conservation in other three species (macaque, cow, and dog). We surveyed nucleotide sites in the 10 790 genes that are conserved among human, rat, and mouse, and evaluated how many of them are also conserved in macaque, cow, and dog. The resulted ratio is 0.751; therefore the expected conservation is 3035 bp. This matches well with the observation. The regions overlapped with UCEs make only 1.47% of the entire SCCS regions. Other SCCSs convey shorter but deeper conservation than UCEs.3.4. SCCSs that form stable RNA secondary structuresThere are cases that a secondary structure of mRNA conveys functions.24,25 We examined secondary structures and free energy of the SCCSs using Vienna RNA package. We found three SCCSs whose folding energy were significantly low (Table 5). Genes containing SCCS with significantly (P < 0.001) low free folding energyThe gene names are represented by those of human.Genes containing SCCS with significantly (P < 0.001) low free folding energyThe gene names are represented by those of human.Polg encodes a catalytic subunit of mitochondrial DNA polymerase POLG. The POLG protein is the only polymerase known to be involved in replication of mtDNA. Gal3st3 encodes a member of the galactose-3-O-sulfotransferase protein family. This protein exists on the membrane of Golgi apparatus. Smarcd3 encodes a protein of SWI/SNF family, whose members display helicase and ATPase activities. This protein is thought to regulate transcription of target genes by altering the chromatin structure around those genes.Figure 2 shows the probability density of the folding free energy constructed by randomly extracted sequences. Each line shows the free energy of the sequences of the same length as the above three SCCSs. Gene names on the lines represent free energy of the SCCSs. This figure suggests that these three SCCSs have extremely low free energy and that these regions will form stable secondary structures. These SCCSs may be conserved because of the requirement for the secondary structures. However, substitution restriction of this type might be modest because a secondary structure can be retained by another combination of nucleotides as far as the complementarity is maintained.

Probability density was created using software package R.383.5. The density of exonic splicing enhancers in SCCSs and in the other coding regionsOne of the well-known functional nucleotide elements in the coding region is splicing signals. We obtained 238 hexamers from RESCUE-ESE Web server as candidates of exonic splicing enhancers, and counted the number of hexamers in SCCSs and non-SCCS regions of the 10 790 genes (Table 6). Splicing signals in non-SCCS regions are counted on human sequences. We observed 20 420 hits of signals in 192 306 bp of SCCS regions and 2 183 544 hits in 205 666 520 of non-SCCS regions. The number of the signals per nucleotide is both 0.106 for SCCS and non-SCCS, and there was no significant difference (P = 0.99, <U+03C7>2 test).

Gene expressionWe investigated the difference of gene expression between SCCS genes and non-SCCS genes referring to anatomical system data of EGenetics, which give qualitative information about in what organs a gene is expressed. We counted the number of SCCS genes and non-SCCS genes expressed in the organs and performed the Fisher's exact test as described in Materials and method section.We compared the percentages of genes that are expressed in each organ. Table 7 shows organs in which significantly higher percentage of SCCS genes are expressed compared with non-SCCS genes. In general, SCCS genes are expressed in a wider variety of organs. This observation agrees with a previous study.35 Only in medulla oblongata and trophoblast, non-SCCS genes showed significantly higher percentage than SCCS genes (data not shown).

Preferred codons, GC content, and codon degeneracy of SCCSsCodon usage biases towards optimum codons are known to suppress synonymous substitution. Optimum codons reflect the composition of the genomic tRNA pool and are advantageous for translation efficiency or accuracy. As the approximate index of optimum codons, we used preferred codons, or most frequently used codon for an amino acid, and evaluated the preferred codon fraction in SCCSs. In SCCS regions, 28 188 of 64 102 codons are preferred codons and in non-SCCS regions, 2 961 482 of 6 855 505 codons are preferred codons. The ratio of preferred codons in SCCS and non-SCCS regions are 0.440 and 0.432, respectively. The difference is significant at the 0.05 significance level (P = 0.013) but the difference of the ratios is merely 0.008. We also observed that the ratio of preferred codon decreases as the length of SCCS increases (Fig. 3). Judging from these results, SCCSs are unlikely to be retained solely by codon preference.

Classes whose sample size < 20 were combined. Error bars represent 1 SE.In mammals, of the influence GC content on nucleotide change as a result of CpG hyper mutability. We investigated GC content of SCCSs. GC content in the first (GC1), second (GC2), and third position (GC3) of codons show different patterns along the sequence length (Fig. 4). GC1 is mostly constant but GC2 increases while GC3 decreases as the length of SCCS increases. Because mammalian genomes prefer GC-ending codons, the decrease of GC3 corresponds to the decrease of preferred codons. The decrease of GC3 seems to be complementary with the increase of GC2 because GC content as a whole is constant (Supplementary Fig. S1). GC content of the first (GC1), the second (GC2), and the third (GC3) position of codons in SCCSs: (A) GC1, (B) GC2, (C) GC3.

Error bars represent 1 SE.Conservation of SCCSs may occur by chance in a region where amino acid constraint is strong and codon degeneracy is low. We investigated codon degeneracy of SCCSs to examine this possibility. The average degeneracy is between three and four and increases as the sequence length increases (Fig. 5). This result suggests that even if the first and second positions of codons are restricted, the third position has enough freedom to change. Therefore, it is unlikely that SCCSs are conserved because of the amino acid constraint combined with the low degeneracy of codons. Codon degeneracy of SCCSs.

DiscussionGO terms, InterPro codes, and KEGG pathways enriched with SCCS genes show a strong commitment to the developmental process, transcriptional regulation, and the neurons. Genes associated with transcriptional regulation or the neurons are known to have a low synonymous substitution ratio. This phenomenon is discussed in relation with codon biases to improve translational efficiency or accuracy. However, our analysis on the preferred codons in SCCSs suggests that codon preference is not likely the major factor influencing on the conservation of SCCSs.Analyses on the ratio of preferred codons, GC content, and codon degeneracy enlighten the characteristics of SCCSs. The ratio of preferred codons decreases as the SCCS length increases. Drummond and Wilke36 investigated the correlation between synonymous substitution rate (dS) and fraction of optimum (Fop) codons, and detected negative correlations between dS and Fop in rodents (mouse and rat) and positive correlation in human–dog comparison. If the SCCSs have the same trend as the rodents of the previous study, the ratio of preferred codons in SCCSs should be high; however, our result is not. There was no factor that would lower nucleotide substitution in GC content and codon degeneracy.Methodological difference is that our research focused on local and complete conservation of nucleotides instead of the dS in the entire region of a gene and that we investigated conservation among the six mammalian species instead of a pair-wise comparison. The difference of results may suggest that factors underlying local and strong conservation such as SCCS differ from the factors working on the gene-wide conservation.Makalowski et al.37 showed a correlation between synonymous substitution rate (dS) and non-synonymous substitution rate (dN). Such correlations may occur when the constraint on a certain nucleotide sequence is so strong that dN is also lowered.The usage of relatively rare codons and strong local conservation of SCCSs may be preferable as regulatory signals. The fraction of SCCSs in the coding region of the 10 790 genes is 0.94%. This fraction is so small that it would not have an influence on conventional evolutionary analysis. Although the fraction is small, or because the fraction is small, SCCSs may have potential as regulatory elements.Supplementary dataSupplementary Data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis study was supported partly by Grant-in-Aid for scientific research from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology of Japan to N.S.We thank Drs Kenta Sumiyama, Kiyoshi Ezawa, and Hiroshi Akashi for their insightful suggestion and discussion.Supplementary data"

IntroductionIn eukaryotes, most mRNAs have a poly(A) tail at their 3' end. 3'-end-processing of eukaryotic pre-mRNA involves endonucleolytic cleavage and polyadenylation.1–3 The 3'-end cleavage and polyadenylation site are regulated by several sequence elements, which have been extensively studied in mammalian, yeast, and plant cells.4–8 In mammals, three elements are known as primary sequence elements: the polyadenylation signal, cleavage site, and downstream U/GU-rich elements. In addition, two auxiliary sequence elements (upstream U-rich elements and downstream G-rich elements) have also been identified. Among these elements, the polyadenylation signal, which is the hexanucleotide AAUAAA or its variant AUUAAA, located 10–35 nucleotides (nt) upstream of the poly(A) site is the most highly conserved sequence. In yeast and plants, A-rich sequence elements also exist ~10–30 nt upstream of the cleavage site, but these elements are less well conserved compared with mammalian polyadenylation signals. Among many sequences identified as A-rich sequences, AAUAAA is the most well-conserved sequence in both yeast and plants. In addition to A-rich sequence elements, further upstream elements, designated efficiency elements in yeast or far upstream elements in plants, the cleavage site, and the downstream U-rich element flanking the cleavage site have been described.In Japan, the filamentous fungus Aspergillus oryzae has long been used for the production of traditional fermented foods, such as sake, soy sauce, and miso (soybean paste), and its long history of use in the food industry is a testament to its safety.9 In addition, A. oryzae has the ability to secrete large amounts of protein, and therefore, it has recently gained recognition as a favourable host organism for recombinant protein production.10,11 However, secretion yields of heterologous proteins from A. oryzae are low compared with those of homologous proteins or proteins from closely related fungal species.12 Recently, we revealed that the transcript of a heterologous gene containing the AT-biased codon was prematurely polyadenylated within the coding region of A. oryzae.13 This premature polyadenylation was prevented by the alteration of its codon to better suit Aspergillus codon usage. This result suggested that cryptic 3'-end-processing signals are recognized by A. oryzae within the coding region of the heterologous gene and that these signals are eliminated by codon optimization. However, no experimental data exist on 3'-end-processing signals in filamentous fungi, including A. oryzae.To elucidate 3'-end-processing signals in A. oryzae, we created a nucleotide sequence data set of the 3'-untranslated region (3' UTR) and 100 nt downstream of the poly(A) site using A. oryzae expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and genomic sequencing data. Using this data set, we identified several putative 3'-end-processing signals in A. oryzae. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the identification of 3'-end-processing signals in filamentous fungi.2. Materials and methods2.1. Creation of the A. oryzae poly(A) data setA total of 21 446 EST sequences in the A. oryzae EST database (http://nribf2.nrib.go.jp/EST2/index.html), created by sequencing from the 5' end of the cDNA insert,14 were searched for sequences that contained at least eight consecutive A residues, yielding 1647 EST sequence entries. Subsequently, EST sequences containing oligo(A) stretches inherently present in the genome were eliminated by comparison with genomic DNA sequences.15 In addition, to eliminate mis-annotated genes, only EST sequences in which the poly(A) site was located within 1000 nt downstream of the stop codon were selected. EST sequences with poly(A) sites located within the coding region, probably caused by internal priming, were also eliminated in this manner. Nine pairs of redundant EST sequences with identical poly(A) sites were considered to be derived from a single cDNA and were removed from the data set. Finally, 1065 EST sequences were selected by these processes. Genomic DNA-based sequences within the 3' UTR and 100 nt sequence downstream of the poly(A) site were extracted for the poly(A) site data set (T residues were converted to U residues). This data set contained 22 pairs of EST sequences derived from the same gene with different poly(A) sites. Therefore, this data set comprised only sequences derived from 1043 unique genes.The poly(A) site was designated as the last nucleotide in the genome sequence preceding the poly(A) tail. When an adenine residue was found at the poly(A) site in the genome sequence, this adenine was termed the poly(A) site nucleotide according to the recent reports of 3'-end-processing signals in plants and Chlamydomonas on the basis of EST sequencing data,8,16 indicating that the first adenine of a poly(A) tail tended to be transcribed from the genomic DNA.17–192.2. DNA microarray analysisThe A. oryzae wild-type strain RIB40, which was used for genome sequencing analysis,15 was grown in sterilized wheat bran media (3.0 g wheat bran with 1.8 ml distilled water) at 30°C for 33 h. Total RNA extraction, mRNA preparation, and DNA microarray analysis were performed according to the methods of Tamano et al.20 Purified Cy3- or Cy5-labelled cDNA probes were hybridized using 12 K A. oryzae oligonucleotide microarrays (Fermlab, Tokyo, Japan). After global normalization, the relative fluorescence intensity of each gene was normalized to that of the histone H4 gene, which was used as a reference. We selected 5384 genes whose intensities were found to be reproducible and reliable (P < 0.1) in dye-swap experiments.2.3. Generation of sequence logosSequence logos of around the poly(A) site were generated using the enoLOGOS web tool.212.4. Analysis of oligonucleotide frequencies2.5. Search for protein factors involved in pre-mRNA 3'-end-processing in A. oryzaeHomologs of protein factors involved in eukaryotic pre-mRNA 3'-end-processing were retrieved by searching the A. oryzae genome database (http://www.bio.nite.go.jp/dogan/project/view/AO, http://nribf2.nrib.go.jp/) using the BlastP program.3. Results and discussion3.1. Profile of the A. oryzae poly(A) data setWe obtained 1065 sequences for the A. oryzae poly(A) data set from the EST database, as described in the Materials and methods section. First, 1043 unique genes contained in the A. oryzae poly(A) data set were classified into functional categories known as eukaryotic orthologous groups,23 according to the gene list in the A. oryzae genome database. Compared with the classification of all genes found in the genome database, the number of genes classified into the Unannotated category was markedly lower in the poly(A) data set [43% in the genome database vs. 30% in the poly(A) data set]. In contrast, the number of genes classified into Information storage and processing and Cellular processes and signalling categories was higher in the poly(A) data set [7 and 12% in the genome database vs. 14 and 20% in the poly(A) data set, respectively]. The number of genes classified into Metabolism and Poorly characterized categories was similar between the genome database and poly(A) data set. These results indicated that the poly(A) data set covers a wide range of genes classified into diverse functional categories despite the poly(A) data set comprising only 1043 unique genes of the 12 074 genes predicted in the A. oryzae genome database.In contrast, because EST sequences were accumulated by single-pass sequencing of the 5' end of the cDNA insert,14 the poly(A) data set could cover <10% of the total genes, and thus, the poly(A) data set might show some bias towards highly expressed genes. To assess this possibility, we compared the frequency distributions of EST contigs that corresponded to each of the 1043 genes in the poly(A) data set with those of the total 7589 contigs in the EST database14 (Fig. 1A). Whereas contigs with frequencies of >6 accounted for ~10% of the total EST contigs, contigs with corresponding frequencies accounted for ~25% of the poly(A) data set. However, singletons accounted for 40% of the poly(A) data set. In addition, we examined the expression levels of genes in the poly(A) data set by DNA microarray analysis (Fig. 1B). Of the total of 5384 genes selected by microarray analysis, the number of relatively highly expressed genes (expression ratio > 0.1) accounted for approximately 7%, whereas it accounted for 20% of the 618 genes of the poly(A) data set. The remaining genes (80%) were expressed at low levels. These results suggested that the poly(A) data set was somewhat biased towards highly expressed genes, but this fact enabled the identification of 3'-end-processing signals.

The fluorescence intensity of each gene was normalized to that of the histone H4 gene.In eukaryotes, many genes including >50% of human and rice genes have multiple polyadenylation sites.8,24 This alternative polyadenylation has been recognized as an important mechanism for gene expression regulation.25 However, no study has investigated on alternative polyadenylation on the basis of bioinformatics analyses in filamentous fungi. Although only 22 pairs of duplicated EST sequences with alternative poly(A) sites were included in the poly(A) data set, 14 pairs of these sequences had distant poly(A) sites located at least 30 nt apart (Supplementary Table S1). This result suggested that alternative polyadenylation also generally occurs in filamentous fungi.3.2. Analysis of 3' UTR length and sequence elements of 3' UTR-binding proteinsIn eukaryotes, 3' UTR regulates mRNA stability and translational efficiency through sequence elements for 3' UTR-binding proteins and microRNAs or through its length.26–31 In A. nidulans, stability of transcripts involved in nitrogen metabolism was dependent on their 3' UTRs.32,33 Therefore, the 3' UTRs may play an important role in gene expression regulation in filamentous fungi. However, no comprehensive information exists about 3' UTRs in filamentous fungi. Hence, we analysed the distribution of 3' UTR lengths in A. oryzae and determined their average and median lengths to compare with those in yeast and plants, which were also determined by analysis of EST sequencing data. In A. oryzae, 3' UTR lengths were predominantly distributed in the range of 51 to 350 nt (Fig. 2). The average 3' UTR length in A. oryzae was 241 nt, while the median 3' UTR length was 203 nt. The average 3' UTR length in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is 144 nt (median 3' UTR length is 121 nt)5 and that in plants is 289 nt (Oryza sativa) and 223 nt (Arabidopsis thaliana).8 These results suggested that 3' UTR length in A. oryzae is greater than that in yeast but similar to that in plants. Distribution of 3' UTR lengths determined for 1065 unique EST sequences. The average length is 241 nt.Distribution of 3' UTR lengths determined for 1065 unique EST sequences. The average length is 241 nt.The most well-known sequence elements for 3' UTR-binding proteins in eukaryotes are AU-rich elements (AREs) and the PUF consensus motif.34,35 We searched for transcripts containing the yeast putative AREs (UAUUUAUU and UUAUUUAU) and PUF consensus motif (UGUANAUA) within the A. oryzae 3' UTR.36–38 In the poly(A) data set, 12 and 23 genes possessed AREs and the PUF consensus motif within the 3' UTR, respectively (Supplementary Table S2). One gene (AO090011000041) particularly exhibited overlapping AUUUA sequences (AUUUAUUUA), a typical ARE motif. In addition, we found orthologs of the yeast ARE-binding protein (Pub1) and four of six yeast Puf family proteins (Puf1, Puf3, Puf4, and Puf6) in the A. oryzae genome (Supplementary Table S3). These results suggested the existence of a regulation system for gene expression that utilizes 3' UTR-binding proteins in filamentous fungi.3.3. Nucleotide profile of the A. oryzae 3' UTRTo determine 3' end processing elements in A. oryzae, we first measured the single nucleotide frequencies for all positions within the 3' UTR and 100 nt sequence downstream of the poly(A) site (set at position 0). As shown in Fig. 3A, this region was notably U-rich, while AU accounted for 62% of nucleotides in this region (U = 34%; A = 28%). Meanwhile, AU content of the coding region in A. oryzae was 48% (http://www.kazusa.or.jp/codon/), suggesting that a high AU content is characteristic of this region. The 3' UTR was markedly U-rich, but a A-rich region was observed upstream of the poly(A) site—particularly, the -29 to -14 nt region had a high A content with >30%. In addition, a high U content was also observed in the +1 to +20 nt region immediately downstream of the poly(A) site, but A and U content in the downstream +20 to +100 nt region was almost equal. This AU-rich element (ARE) located in the region immediately downstream of the U-rich region flanking the poly(A) site was also found in yeast and plants, but it has not been defined as the 3'-end-processing element in those organisms.4,7,8 Moreover, the poly(A) site (position 0) had an extremely high A content (78%), and as described in the Materials and methods section, the first adenine of the poly(A) tail was designated as the poly(A) site nucleotide. High C nucleotide usage was observed at position -1 immediately before the poly(A) site compared with other positions (position -3, 20%; position -2, 21%; position -1, 37%; and position 0, 7%; Fig. 3B). The content of pyrimidine nucleotides (C and U) at position -1 was 68%, suggesting that CA or UA dinucleotides form the optimal cleavage site in A. oryzae, similar to that observed in plants.

(C) Six regions of the 3' UTR and 100 nt sequence downstream of the poly(A) site formed according to the single nucleotide profile. The cleavage and polyadenylation site is located between regions IV and V.Importantly, the nucleotide distribution profile of the 3' UTR in A. oryzae was similar to that in plants,7,8,39 yeast,4 and mammals,24 although the U-rich region was expanded towards the coding region of A. oryzae. On the basis of the nucleotide profile observed, the 3' UTR plus 100 nt sequence downstream of the poly(A) site was divided into six signal element regions, designated regions I–VI, to identify the sequence elements for 3'-end-processing (Fig. 3C).3.4. Search for nucleotide sequence elements for 3'-end-processingTo identify 3'-end-processing elements, we searched for tetramer–heptamer nucleotide sequences that appeared most frequently in each signal element region (Table 1, the top 50 list is available in Supplementary Table S4). In region II, equivalent to the region containing the polyadenylation signal in mammals, no significantly conserved hexanucleotide sequence was observed, similar to that observed in yeast and plants. The top-ranked hexanucleotide was AAUGAA in region II. The top two pentanucleotides (AAUGA and AUGAA) were partial sequences of AAUGAA, and all of the top three heptanucleotides contained the AAUGAA sequence (Table 1). In addition, according to the zeroth- and first-order Markov chain models, calculation of a standard score (Z-score) to measure the standard deviation of the hexanucleotide sequences from its expected occurrence revealed that AAUGAA was the most over-represented hexanucleotide sequence in region II (Table 2). These results suggested that AAUGAA is the most predominant hexanucleotide sequence in region II, although it accounted for only 6% of all transcripts (64 of1043). In contrast, according to the order of Z-scores, the AAUAAA sequence was not the major hexanucleotide sequence in region II, although it ranked third in the list of hexanucleotides. This was also demonstrated by plotting the distribution of hexanucleotide sequences, including AAUGAA and AAUAAA, in the region ranging from -40 to -1 nt (Fig. 4). The AAUGAA sequence was a single nucleotide variant of AAUAAA, but no study has reported that AAUGAA is the most effective A-rich sequence for the 3'-end-processing element in any eukaryote. Interestingly, point mutation of AAUAAA to AAUGAA results in a significant reduction of polyadenylation efficiency by in vitro 3'-end-processing reactions, using nuclear extracts from Xenopus and mammalian cells.18,40 Thus, the 3'-end-processing machinery in A. oryzae may be somewhat different from that in higher eukaryotes.

The best sequence for yeast efficiency elements is UAUAUA and its single nucleotide variants (UAUGUA and UACAUA).4,41,42 In contrast, the best sequence of plant far upstream elements is UGUA.8,38 In addition, this region in mammalian cells is defined as the auxiliary upstream element, and the UGUAN sequence element may function as a recognition element for 3'-end-processing proteins in case of A(A/U)UAAA-lacking 3' UTRs.43 However, these sequences were not predominant in region I of the A. oryzae poly(A) data set (Table 1). Moreover, no other sequence motif was highly conserved in this region, although the top nucleotide sequences were notably U-rich sequences. Similarly, no conserved sequence motif was observed in two other U-rich regions (regions III and V), suggesting that these sequences can be defined only as U-rich elements.In region IV, equivalent of the cleavage site, the CA sequence ranked top and this motif existed in 31% of the sequences (Table 1). This suggested that the CA sequence is the most optimal cleavage site in A. oryzae. However, the GA sequence ranked third, and this motif existed in 22% of the sequences, suggesting that CA or UA dinucleotide sequences are not strictly conserved as the cleavage site. In region VI, no commonality was observed in the high-ranked tetramer–heptamer sequences (Table 1), suggesting that this region cannot be defined as a 3'-end-processing element, similar to that in yeast and plants.3.5. Putative 3'-end-processing signals in A. oryzaeBased on the information presented in this study, we proposed putative 3'-end-processing signals in A. oryzae (Fig. 5). The putative 3'-end-processing signals in A. oryzae were similar to those in yeast and plants but some differences were observed between them. First, A-rich sequences upstream of the poly(A) site were less well conserved in all three species than in mammals, and the predominant hexanucleotide in this region of A. oryzae differed from that of yeast and plants. The canonical hexanucleotide AAUAAA signal in mammals is also the most frequently occurring signal in this 3' UTR of yeast and plants, whereas it is found only in ~13% and 7–10% of yeast and plant genes, respectively. In contrast, the most over-represented hexanucleotide in A. oryzae was AAUGAA, although this sequence accounted for only 6% of all transcripts, similar to yeast and plant AAUAAA sequences. Second, in the upstream of the A-rich region, while most dominant sequence motifs are well defined in yeast and plants (UAUAUA in yeast and UGUA in plants), no conserved sequence motif was observed in A. oryzae, except for the U-rich elements described earlier.

The arrow indicates the cleavage and polyadenylation site.A schematic representation of the alignment of 3'-end-processing signals in A. oryzae, yeast, and plants. The arrow indicates the cleavage and polyadenylation site.In a previous study, we showed that a cDNA of the mite Dermatophagoides farinae, known as Der f7, contains the AT-biased codon and therefore is prematurely polyadenylated within the coding region of A. oryzae. We also showed that codon optimization circumvents this premature polyadenylation.13 The GC content of the native Der f7 open reading frame (ORF) was 37.8%, while that of the codon-optimized Der f7 ORF was 52.8%. Thus, A- and U-rich sequences within the coding region of native Der f7 cDNA were eliminated by codon optimization. The putative 3'-end-processing signals in A. oryzae deduced from this study supported that the A- and U-rich sequences present within the coding region of native Der f7 pre-mRNA were involved in incorrect 3'-end-processing. Although two AAUGAA sequences were present in the coding region of native Der f7 pre-mRNA, neither were located within the region located 10–30 nt upstream of the premature poly(A) sites.13 This suggested that the AAUGAA sequence within the coding region of the AT-rich heterologous gene could not function by itself as an efficient 3'-end-processing signal in A. oryzae. The A- and U-rich sequences located upstream of the cleavage site might work co-operatively in 3'-end-processing. In future, whether the elimination of the top-ranked A-rich sequences within the coding region of heterologous genes results in the prevention of aberrant, premature transcription termination must be examined empirically.3.6. Protein factors involved in the pre-mRNA 3'-end-processing machinery of A. oryzaeThe recognition mechanism of 3'-end-processing signals has been well studied in yeast and mammals, and a large number of protein factors, e.g. ~14 proteins in mammals and ~20 proteins in yeast, are required for 3'-end-processing.2,3 To examine whether these factors involved in 3'-end-processing are conserved in A. oryzae, we searched for homologous proteins of 20 yeast polyadenylation factors in the A. oryzae genome (Table 3). Most homologs of yeast polyadenylation factors, except for 3 factors (Ref2, Syc1, and Pti1), were found in the A. oryzae genome. These three factors are components of the cleavage and polyadenylation factor in yeast,44 but no homologous proteins of these three factors are observed in plant and mammal genomes, suggesting that they are specific to yeast. In comparison with polyadenylation factors in human genomes, although no homologs of CFIm68 and CFIm59 were found in yeast, A. oryzae, and plant genomes, the homologue of CFIm25 was present in A. oryzae and plant genomes but not in the yeast genome. In contrast, the homologous protein (AO090001000725) of yeast Hrp1, reported to bind to RNA with specificity for the AU-rich efficiency element in yeast,45,46 was found in the A. oryzae genome, whereas no Hrp1 homologue with higher similarity was found in plant and mammalian genomes. Furthermore, although homologs of human CstF-50 and CPSF73-II were present in the plant genome, these were not found in yeast and A. oryzae genomes. These observations suggested that the protein factors involved in the 3'-end-processing machinery of filamentous fungi resemble, in part, those of yeast and those of plants. This could be indicative of the evolutionary relationship between filamentous fungi, plants, and yeast. Some protein factors homologous to their counterparts in other organisms show differences in their RNA-binding specificity, positioning, and function. For example, while mammalian CPSF160 binds directly to the hexanucleotide AAUAAA signal, the homologue of yeast Yhh1 binds near the A-rich cleavage site but not the A-rich polyadenylation signal.47 In this regard, because no sequence motif equivalent to the yeast AU-rich efficiency element or the mammalian UGUAN sequence was observed among the putative 3'-end-processing signals in A. oryzae, the RNA-binding specificity and positioning of the homologs Hrp1 and CFIm25 involved in 3'-end-processing in A. oryzae must be investigated. Comparison of protein factors involved in pre-mRNA 3'-end-processing between Aspergillus oryzae, yeast, plants, and humanProtein factors involved in pre-mRNA 3'-end-processing in yeast, plants, and humans are based on the data described in the studies by Mandel et al.,2 Millevoi and Vagner,3 and Hunt et al.48aHomologue of A. oryzae Fip1 was retrieved by searching the A. oryzae genome database deposited by the National Research Institute of Brewing, Japan (http://nribf2.nrib.go.jp/genome/blastscope.html).Comparison of protein factors involved in pre-mRNA 3'-end-processing between Aspergillus oryzae, yeast, plants, and humanProtein factors involved in pre-mRNA 3'-end-processing in yeast, plants, and humans are based on the data described in the studies by Mandel et al.,2 Millevoi and Vagner,3 and Hunt et al.48aHomologue of A. oryzae Fip1 was retrieved by searching the A. oryzae genome database deposited by the National Research Institute of Brewing, Japan (http://nribf2.nrib.go.jp/genome/blastscope.html).3.7. ConclusionsIn this study, we identified putative 3'-end-processing signals in A. oryzae using EST and genomic sequencing data. The putative 3'-end-processing signals in A. oryzae identified in this study comprised four elements: the furthest upstream U-rich element; A-rich sequence element (the most dominant sequence being AAUGAA); cleavage site (the most dominant sequence being CA); and U-rich element flanking the cleavage site. Although these putative 3'-end-processing signals in A. oryzae were similar to those found in yeast and plants, obvious differences were observed in the furthest upstream element and A-rich sequence element. To our knowledge, this is the first study of 3'-end-processing signals in filamentous fungi, and we believe that the data presented in this paper will provide knowledge critically important to the understanding of pre-mRNA 3'-end-processing in eukaryotes. In addition, this study also provides useful information on codon optimization of heterologous genes to prevent aberrant, premature polyadenylation within the coding region of filamentous fungi.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported, in part, by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Priority Areas, Applied Genomics (no. 17019001), from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology of Japan.

IntroductionHaematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a well-established treatment in various haematologic malignancies. Advances in clinical practice and improvements in donor–patient matching have produced significant better outcomes in related and unrelated allogeneic HSCT. Especially, refinements in high-resolution DNA-based tissue typing and knowledge which transplantation antigens are most significant when selecting donors for recipients helped to improve and prolong survival rates.1 The classical transplantation antigens defined as human leukocyte antigens (HLA) are physically located within a ~4 Mb highly polymorphic multigene region, known as the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on chromosome 6.2–4 Many of the genes annotated inside the MHC have immune-related functions, for instance genes involved in HLA expression and transport or antigen degradation and presentation. Hence, MHC-located genes with distinct extensive polymorphisms play a fundamental role in transplantation medicine and moreover in autoimmune, inflammatory and infection diseases in humans.5,6From the clinical perspective, exact HLA typing for class I and class II genes is a necessity for haematologic stem cell transplantation.7,8 In addition to HLA, MHC-resident unidentified transplantation determinants recently were proposed to be responsible for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).9 Petersdorf et al. identified significantly increased risks of severe acute GVHD and lower incidence of disease recurrence in haplotype-mismatched HLA-matched unrelated HSCT. Extended haplotypes of unrelated donors and recipients were allusively defined by applying a mapping approach using the physical linkage of HLA-A, -B and -DRB1. Another methodological approach, measuring risks associated with donor–recipient MHC microsatellite marker matches or mismatches, showed increased or decreased risk for death and GVHD development.10In case of yet unknown transplantation determinants located inside the MHC region, new technologies are essential for providing direct insights. Current approaches to define MHC-resident disease association are generally based on analytical methods for indirect haplotype determination. Definition of haplotype blocks11 with linked dedicated genetic variants is an effective tool, however phasing of long-distance segments is required and comes with several challenging issues and systemic limitations.11 Due to the long genetic distances between MHC loci and the necessity for phasing of uneven distributed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), long-range haplotyping is hard to achieve.Now, we hypothesize that applying targeted sequence capture to the human MHC, ideally combined and enhanced by HLA typing12–14 in one single diagnostic sequencing experiment, provides additional information on transplant outcome.Here we describe for the first time NimbleGen sequence capture on solid surface for targeted MHC resequencing by 454 sequencing in a clinical transplant setting. Moreover, to address the accuracy of the sequencing approach, we analysed approximately 1500 SNP markers mapping along the sequenced MHC region using genome-wide SNP arrays. For this study, we selected a patient who underwent unrelated HLA-matched allogeneic stem cell transplantation, the fully matched unrelated donor and also the parents of the patient. The patient developed acute GVHD after transplantation and died 1.5 months later.Thus, we show that MHC resequencing, although applied to two HLA-identical genomes, reveals a large number of genetic differences and variants potentially linked to GVHD development. Various differences causing non-synonymous amino acid exchanges are discussed for their influence on GVHD development or drug efficacy and donor selection. In contrast to microarray-based SNP analysis or haplotype association studies, direct resequencing offers the near-complete information on genotypic differences for important transplantation outcome determinants at the single nucleotide resolution level.2. Material and methods2.1 Clinical setting and experimental designWe performed a comprehensive MHC resequencing approach and analysed a patient with acute myeloid leukaemia undergoing HLA-matched allergenic HSCT, the unmatched donor and the patient's parents. Initial donor selection was performed using molecular high-resolution HLA typing by Sanger sequencing. Written consent was obtained from all patients and donors as required by the institutional review board in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The transplant was matched for 10 out of 10 alleles. The patient underwent a myeloablative busulfan/cyclophosphamide-based conditioning regime before transplantation. Short-course methotrexate combined with mycophenolate mofetil was used as a standard GVHD prophylaxis, due to intolerance to calcineurin inhibitors. On Day +21 after transplantation the patient developed acute GVHD Grade IV (skin IV, liver IV, gut II; Seattle criteria) and died 3 weeks later.After microarray sequence capture and enrichment (SCE), MHC-targeted resequencing of 3.5 million base pairs for all four DNA samples was performed on a single Genome Sequencer instrument run. Additionally, microarray based genome-wide SNP analysis (Affymetrix Genome-wide Human SNP Nsp/Sty 6.0) was performed for donor and recipient for further MHC and genome-wide SNP analysis.2.2 DNA samplesGenomic DNA was isolated and purified from venous blood samples using the magnetic bead extracting MagNaPure Compact instrument (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) following the manufactu-rer's instructions. DNA concentration and quality were photometrically determined (BioPhotometer, Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany).2.3 High-resolution sequence-based HLA typing (SBT)The samples were typed initially for loci A, C, DQB1 and DRB1 using a commercial typing kit (S4 HLA-DRB1 and S3 HLA-A/C/DQB1; Protrans, Hockenheim, Germany) and HLA-B (AlleleSEQR HLA-B; Atria Genetics, South San Francisco, CA). PCR products were treated with ExoSAP-iT (Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany) to remove primers and dNTPs and purified by size exclusion chromatography with Sephadex® G-50 (Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany). Direct cycle sequencing was performed in a 9800 Fast Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using the BigDyeTerminator™ v1.1 chemistry (Applied Biosystems) with the respective sequencing primers. The sequencing platform was an ABI Prism 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). The sequences representing frequent and well-known alleles were analysed by the Assign 3.5 software (Conexio Genomics) and presented in Table 1. HLA typing results*DNA based typing.HLA typing results*DNA based typing.2.4 Affymetrix genome-wide SNP analysisFor genome-wide SNP determination, an Affymetrix Genome-wide Human SNP Array (Nsp/Sty Assay Kit 5.0/6.0; carrying 909,622 SNP markers) processing with sample preparation, digestion, ligation, amplification, labelling, hybridization, staining and scanning were conducted according to the manufacturer's instructions. For donor and recipient, 250 ng of double-stranded genomic DNA starting material were digested with Nsp I and Sty I (New England BioLabs GmbH, Frankfurt, Germany). Hybridizations were conducted with one replicate of all times and treatments concurrently. Each array image was visually screened to count for general signal quality and then submitted to Genotyping Console 4.0 (Affymetrix). Genotype calling was determined by the Birdseed version 2.0 using 90 HapMap reference samples for cluster analysis.2.5 Sequence capture and enrichmentDesign and production of a GS FLX Titanium optimized sequence capture array (385k) was done at NimbleGen (Roche NimbleGen, Madison, WI) targeting 5 Mb reference sequence (human hg18) spanning the MHC complex on chromosome 6 (NCBI: chr6 NGS primary_target_region 29,594,756-33,046,546). Targeted sequence capture, with pre-capture ligation-mediated PCR (LM-PCR), hybridization, washing, elution and quantitative PCR (qPCR) to assess capture success, was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. According to ENSEMBL v49 release (HG 18 in UCSC nomenclature) reference genome, the final target bases covering the complete MHC class I, II and III regions were defined to be 3 451 791 bp; of those 2 922 962, target bases (84.7%) were covered by capture oligonucleotides as defined by NimbleGens default settings for probe selection. 528 829 bp (15.3%) of the initial target region were omitted due to reasons of specificity and uniqueness.2.6 MHC genotyping by Roche/454 Genome Sequencer FLX sequencingUsing the titanium-optimized sequence, capture protocol provides the captured DNA ready for use in 454 emPCR because required adaptor sequences are integrated during the LM-PCR step. The four captured DNA-sequencing libraries were prepared separately and each one loaded on one of the four-lane gasket PicoTiterPlate device (PTP; 70×75 mm; Roche/454), respectively. Each library was quantitated by Pico-Green® (Quant-iT™, Molecular Probes, Invitrogen), diluted to 1 × 105 molecules/µl and used for emPCR at a ratio of 0.1 copies of library fragments per DNA capture bead. After the DNA capture bead recovery, DNA capture bead enrichment, to separate DNA-carrying beads from non-DNA carrying beads, was performed. Finally, we loaded 490 000–690 000 then single-strand DNA carrying beads on the PTP. The sequencing itself was performed on a Genome Sequencer FLX system using titanium chemistry and standard Roche 454 protocols (Lib-L SV; Rev. Jan 2010). Sequence information is available on NCBI (release on 2011-11-24; Accession nb: SRP004546).2.7 Data analysisImage processing and base calling was performed with GS FLX software (Roche/454 Life Sciences). For 100% identity contiguous sequence production, the GS Reference Mapper (Roche/454 Life Sciences) was used. The MHC Haplotype Project with the analysis of eight MHC haplotypes provided a comprehensive reference sequence database, which is consequently used for variation assessments in the present study4. Haplotype (A3-B7-DR15) of the cell line PGF was designated as the new MHC reference sequence, representing the reference sequence for the used capture oligonucleotide design (NCBI human HG 18). Genes were annotated according to the Vertebrate Genome Annotation database (http://www.VEGA.sanger.ac.uk) on the basis of the referenced PGF cell line.A series of Perl scripts was developed and applied to determine the type (substitute, insertion, deletion, synonymous or non-synonymous) and quantity (number of reads per variant) of variation between the four samples and the reference cell line and in between donor and recipient. A simple, but clear-cut ratio of the number of matched or mismatched variants in relation to the total number of sequenced base pairs defines the similarity of actual or potential donor and recipient MHC, reliably enabling fast qualification of possible donor-recipient matches with a single quality factor over and above the obligatory HLA match.2.8 Variant analysis to graft-versus-host or disease susceptibilityAdditional series of Perl scripts allow to search and compare for known disease associations or other valued medical information. Parameters such as intergenic, intronic, coding/non-coding, synonymous/non-synonymous and coverage as well as prevalence are used to define a list of SNPs to start batch analysis in NCBI's OMIM or related databases. Once the sequence data were generated by the sequencing instrument, it took just 2 h for the data analysis programs to analyse the raw data and generate report variation and disease association information. A summary table with all prominent types of SNPs in resequenced regions with at least 20-fold coverage is presented in Table 2.

Results and Discussion3.1 Efficiency of the enrichment processWhen estimating the efficiency of the enrichment process, the four different probes (NSC0237, NSC0247, NSC0268 and NSC0272) included in the sequence capture assay were quantified by qPCR before and after the enrichment process revealing that ~337-fold enrichment was achieved (ranging from 164- to 851-fold). This is clearly above the quality standard of 100-fold enrichment, which should be realized when using microarray-based sequence capture systems.3.2 Specificity of the enrichment processAccording to PGF reference alignment observations, a total of 706 431 reads representing 78% of the 908 152 high-quality reads produced were located inside the specified MHC target region. 61 455 reads (8.7%) were rejected due to length (<50 b), repetitive or chimeric characteristics.3.3 454 pyrosequencingLibraries 1–4 (MHC Parent 1, MHC Parent 2, MHC donor, MHC recipient) showed a post-emPCR and recovery enrichment efficiency of 2.5, 4.5, 5.7 and 5.8%. As a consequence 490 450, 544 500, 682 950 and 690 900 DNA-capture beads per lane were loaded to the GS-PTP (PicoTiterPlate) regions 1–4. The number of individual read sequences which passed internal quality control filters, with a mean read length of 350 bp, were 223 005, 225 385, 226 501 and 234 017, respectively, for each region.3.4 MHC-resequencing coverageIn total, we were able to annotate 273 genes to our MHC sequence data. For samples 1–4 (Parent 1, Parent 2, donor and recipient) 165 956, 167 376, 178 588 and 194 511 reads were MHC matched (Table 3). For contig analysis (parameters: 90% homology; three reads minimum for base pair position), a sum of 1246 (3 009 032 bp, 87% of target), 1287 (2 931 090 bp, 85% of target), 1073 (3 036 931 bp (88% of target) and 1129 (3 048 429 bp, 88% of target) contigs with on average 140, 131, 174 and 179 reads per contig were generated. In total, 4735 contigs with 12 025 482 bp and 706 431 reads were submitted for further analysis. On average, 13% of the targeted 3.5 Mb MHC were missed by this resequencing approach. For an annotated gene list of 273 genes (pseudogenes included) from the telomeric gene DAQB-12N14.5 (MHC-extended class I) to the centromeric gene BRD2 (MHC-class II) for which we have full sequence, the coverage is on average 17-, 18-, 19- and 20-folds for each position for Parent 1, Parent 2, donor and recipient, respectively (Table 3 and Fig. 1).

Graph for reference cell line PGF show known annotated gene loci in black (gene annotation = 1).3.5 MHC-resequencing variation analysisWhen comparing the sequence data of the four individual MHC regions to PGF, a significant number of known (dbSNP included) and new (non-dbSNP included) variant positions were detected. For parent 1 5 577, for parent 2 4139, for donor 4781 and for the bone marrow transplanted patient 4659, variant positions were detected. Among these 6% are insertions, 1% are deletions and 93% represent substitutions. An estimated 10% of all detected variants affiliate to exonic, 31% to intronic and 59% to intergenic regions. The complete numbers are shown in Table 1.Comparing the MHC sequences of donor and recipient with the reference PGF cell line, in sum 32 586 variant positions were detected with a 3-fold coverage. Analysing donor and recipient sequences directly to each other, with the restriction to 10- or 20-fold coverage these numbers drop to 15 699 and 4596, respectively. Taking the mean of 3-, 10- and 20-fold coverage numbers, these variant positions are equally distributed and located 59% to intergenic, 7% to exonic and 34% to intronic regions.Now, in the case of comparing the MHC sequences of donor and recipient directly to each other, 3025 different positions were observed with coverage greater or equal to 20-fold. Additional 1517 positions are shared among donor and recipient, but differ with PGF sequences. Comparing Parent 1 to recipient, 3639 variant positions differ. Comparing parent 2 and recipient showed 5790 differences. Analogous, 1574 and 2276 positions shared differ in comparison to the referenced cell line. Figure 2 shows the graphical interpretation of similarities and dissimilarities among possible donor and recipient genotypes. Although, being far from perfect, donor versus recipient correlation compared with recipient versus parent correlation show the influence of the HLA match. Ultra-deep sequencing would be necessary to bring the data closer to the homogenous or heterogenous distribution values (50, 100%). MHC resequencing results.

These 360 exon variants represent, with 6.6 variant positions per gene, a list of 59 genes (Fig. 3). MHC resequencing results.

Summary of variant positions between parents, donor and recipient.3.6 Variation analysis SNP microarraySNP microarray variants (Affymetrix) with at least 10-fold coverage for recipient and donor with 1345 and 1382 SNPs show that ~93.38% (n= 1,256) for recipient and 94.07% (n= 1,300) for donor are validated by GS-FLX data, or vice versa. SNPs with no coverage with GS-FLX data represent 1.3%, meaning, that only 1.3% fall in gap regions, a value acceptable to be low. Among those SNPs which differ with PGF, 46% are heterozygous and 54% are homozygous. Data for SNPs outside MHC comprise 885 576 specified SNPs; among these, 551 954 (62.33%) are concordant between donor and recipient. In contrast inside MHC, 1365 (86.6%) SNPs match.Taken together, here we report the performance of newly developed methods for human MHC locus resequencing, namely targeted microarray-mediated SCE by NimbleGen and massively-parallel clonal pyrosequencing with 454's next generation sequencing technology. The genomes we partly resequenced represent a typical HSCT situation with 10 out of 10 HLA-loci matched. The procedures we used were tested with respect to efficiency and specificity of on-surface sequence capture, and the ability to discover genetic variation in coding and non-coding regions comparing the genotypes with single-base resolution for selected 3.5 Mb MHC sequence. In total, four MHC captures from four different samples were performed using DNA extracted from peripheral blood, prepared for 454 sequencing separately and subjected to one of the four sequencing regions on a single picotitre plate. The intention of the study was not to look at known or unknown GVHD-determining parameters, but to show whether available technologies and analytical software were powerful enough to start considering a study that addressed this problem comprehensively.3.7 Enrichment, sequencing and recipient-donor pairingIn total, a mean of 337-fold enrichment achieved, among these sequences 83% could be adjusted to the targeted MHC sequences. We qualified both values (enrichment and specificity) highly sufficient for sound comparison of sequence among samples. 454-pyrosequencing gave approximately und genau? 200 000 reads per sample. A mean of 87% of the MHC was resequenced with at least 3-fold coverage. The MHC-resequencing variation analysis we chose resulted in a simple but clear score for comparing genotype variants. When comparing two individuals on the genotype level, we, first, describe and second, simply count the numbers of single nucleotide variant positions, including insertions or deletions neglecting any known functional background and score a simple number to each possible transplant-pair donor versus recipient 3025, Parent 1 versus recipient 3696 and Parent 2 versus recipient 5790. Applying this type of analysis can reveal the best fit donor out from a series of equally well fully HLA-matched candidates. As already mentioned, we cannot yet discriminate between expected transplant outcome, but we can analyse each MHC with single nucleotide resolution what can help with dependence on known disease association or possible immunologic activity generating as well as drug-acceptance potential for each and any SNP to select the best-suited donor candidate.3.8 Genes and SNPsOn the basis of this individual MHC resequencing data and gene annotation, all database including genetic variant information for a total of 273 genes was gathered. To date numerous SNPs are described for these regions. Among these, all variants located in exons of the ~45 MHC resident genes with known immunologic function, presented in Supplementary data only, show that a huge amount of possible proteinous structural variation, which could be responsible for inflammation induction when encountered by immunologic competent cells not tolerant against them. In total, we have 30 protein-coding genes with 56 non-synonymous (44%) and 71 synonymous (56%) sequence variants in exonic regions, three RNA genes (HCG17, HCG27 and NCRNA00171) and one transposable element (TIGD1L). Genes with non-synonymous amino acid exchanges are TUBB, GNL1, PRR3, HCG17, MDC1, HCG27, UBD, PSMB9, HSPA1L, TAP2, PPP1R10, MSH5, CLIC, CFB, C6orf10, TRIM40, CSNK2B, C6orf136 and BAT3. The list of protein-coding genes with synonymous amino acid exchanges, includes the genes PPP1R11, TRIM10, MICB, C6orf205, TRIM26, TCF19, ZFP57, NEU1, KIAA1949, GABBR1, DDR1, C6orf26 and AIF1 (Table 4). List of genes with variant positionsa between donor and recipientaVariants located in exonic regions only.List of genes with variant positionsa between donor and recipientaVariants located in exonic regions only.The gene most affected by sequence variation is Tubulin beta. It is different in 54 positions in all four exonic regions including 5 insertions (GG, T, TAAGA, AA and TG) and 3 deletions (A, TG and T) with all variants >22-fold coverage, among those positions different 33 distinct variants result in 21 synonymous amino acid changes. The data need further verification with additional bioinformatic tools with the purpose to discriminate among tubulin family members and true variants. But, tubulin beta functions in microtubule formation and is therefore important for many aspects of cell activity, including morphogenesis, intracellular vesicle/signal transport and cell cycle regulation. In breast cancer, tubulin-associated SNPs are known to be responsible for taxol/taxane resistance.15 Another aspect of tubulin-drug interaction is that beside taxane, noscapine, its analoga and colchicine have tubulin-binding properties and influence anti-inflammatory activity by inhibition of cytokine and chemokine release from macrophages. Consequently, if tubulin-variant dependent microtubule dynamics influence cytosolic signalling, thus dampening inflammatory responses the described individual differences might possibly help explain why GVHD signals originate and sprout.16 In that context it is interesting to mention that GVHD often starts in skin, gastrointestinal tract or liver and that tubulin is involved in pathogenic Escherichia coli infections, which cause inflammation and sepsis, therefore it should be allowed to think, that tubulin variants can contribute to GVHD in one or the other way.17,18TIGD1L (tigger transposable element derived 1-like) is a DNA transposon, or class 2 transposable element, has also 17 genomic variants between recipient and donor—meaning full or not? Generally spoken, the influence of this class of elements on mammalian genome evolution is very interesting and it would be helpful to better understand their influence on the immune system and why some species/individuals are more susceptible to invasion by parasites or principal stress situations than others.19The next gene with high amounts of SNP differences in our specific recipient and donor setting are the genes for the inhibitory units 11 and 10 of protein phosphatase 1 (PPP1R11; protein phosphatase 1, regulatory (inhibitor) subunit 11 with 9 synonymous exchanges; PPP1R10 1 non-synonymous and 1 synonymous amino acid exchange). Especially, in combination with CsA, most immunosuppressive drugs that support successful allograft survival act by inhibiting or depleting T lymphocytes by inhibiting protein phosphatases.20Another gene with two non-synonymous, five synonymous amino acid exchange differences between recipient and donor is the gene guanine nucleotide-binding protein-like 1 (GNL1). Recently, guanine nucleotide binding protein-like 3-like (GNL3L), another member of the GNL family was described to bind TRF1 (telomeric repeat-binding factor 1). In addition to GNL, TRF1 can be bound and modulated also by two nucleolar GTP-binding proteins, nucleostemin, which exhibit apparently opposite effects on the protein degradation of TRF1. In particular, in a recent paper from Zhu et al., GNL3L is able to stabilize TRF1 protein during mitosis and promote the metaphase-to-anaphase transition.21 Telomeric repeat binding factor 1 (TRF1) is a component of the multiprotein complex ‘shelterin’, which organizes the telomere into a high-order structure.TRIM10, TRIM 26, TRIM 40 have 4, 2 and 1 SNPs different with 1 non-synonymous amino acid exchange in TRIM 40. A study using a cDNA expression screening procedure in a patient–donor model with full HLA match, the major target antigen of donor lymphocytes was identified to be TRIM22-442 C, a polymorphic allele of the tripartite motif family member TRIM22 (synonym: STAF50). The authors described that an arginine(R)-to-cysteine(C) exchange at position 442 generated an immunogenic T cell epitope equivalent to a minor histocompatibility antigen (mHag). Approximately 1.3% of Caucasians carry TRIM22-442 C in association with HLA-A*02:01.22MICB, with only four synonymous exchanges encodes a heavily glycosylated protein, which is a ligand for the NKG2D type II receptor. Binding of the ligand activates the cytolytic response of natural killer (NK) cells, CD8 alpha/beta T cells and gamma/delta T cells, which express the receptor. This protein is stress induced and is similar to MHC class I molecules. MICB seems to have no role in antigen presentation, but acts as a stress-induced self-antigen, a ligand for KLRK1/NKG2D receptor, that is recognized by gamma/delta T cells.23,24Ubiquitin-binding domains of the gene ubiquitin D (UBD) are modular elements that bind non-covalently to the protein modifier ubiquitin. The sequence context of UBDs and the conformational changes that follow their binding to ubiquitin also contribute to ubiquitin signalling and can therefore influence ubiquitins functions in HLA molecule expression and antigen presentation as well as dendritic cell activation.25PSMB9 is different at three exonic positions. A recent publication with a rat cardiac allograft model has shown that immunoproteasome beta subunit 10 was found to be specifically increased in the graft and blood samples during chronic active antibody-mediated rejection. Using this model, they found that administration of the proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, delayed acute rejection and attenuated the humoral response in both the acute phase and established state of this syndrome in a dose-dependent manner.263.9 Genome-wide SNP analysisThe analysis of the SNPs located inside MHC by next generation sequencing was complemented by whole genome SNP analysis. In total, we compared 885 576 SNPs equally well distributed throughout the genome observing that 62% (551 954) are shared between donor and recipient outside the MHC, whereas 86% (1365) are shared inside the MHC, reflecting the higher linkage equilibrium of MHC localized loci (Fig. 4). Taken into account that great variance exists between persons as well as demographic groups, this analysis can for the time being only be an estimate as a consequence of missing data on an individuals’ variant level. Validation results from Affymetrix-SNP data within the MHC region show 93.38% concordance with the next generation sequence data. On the basis of more individuals' sequence availability for MHC, the data for SNP design will improve accordingly, but whether it will ever meet the power of direct resequencing is an unanswered question.

ConclusionsRapidly evolving next generation sequencing technologies have reduced the hands on time and the cost per base compared with Sanger sequencing and are beginning to spread into disease prog- and diagnostics. New methodological applications, for intensive characterization of donor and recipient, minor and major histocompatibility antigens or other biomarker candidates affecting transplant outcome can clearly help select the best-matched donor by extending the list of genes screened. The list of candidate genes affecting GVHD induction and maintenance is long and the mechanisms are likely to be diverse. The data presented here demonstrate the utility of targeted sequence capture and massive parallel sequencing in detailed characterization of the genetic diversity of the donor and the recipient MHC repertoire. Such a wealth of information derived from such studies will lead to extended personalized genomic knowledge on individual MHC structures, SNPs disease associations, drug efficacy information, minor histocompatibility antigen polymorphisms or T-cell epitope formation, all crucial for further improvement of donor selection and T cell transfer strategies. Ongoing developments in targeted sequence capture in solution and the scheduled 1 kb read length in 454's pyrosequencing technology together with supplemental analysis for haplotype structures will increase the impact of that type of analysis in the field of transplant medicine.Acknowledgements: The authors thank Henry A.

IntroductionAbout 40% of our genome is derived from transposable elements, such as DNA transposons and retrotransposons.1–3 They have long been considered as junk DNAs. However, it has become clear that certain genes derived from retrotransposons play essential roles in mammalian development as newly acquired endogenous genes. We previously identified human and mouse PEG10 (Paternally expressed 10) as a novel paternally expressed imprinted gene.4,5PEG10 is a single-copy gene located between SGCE (Sarcoglycan epsilon) and PPP1R9A (Protein phosphatase 1, regulatory (inhibitor) subunit 9A). It is highly conserved in not only eutherian but also in marsupial mammals, but it is absent from monotreme mammals and from other vertebrates, such as birds and fish.5,6 A structural analysis of PEG10 clearly showed that it was derived from one of the sushi groups of Ty3/Gypsy LTR (long terminal repeat) retrotransposons. PEG10 has two separate open reading frames (ORF1 and ORF2) that produce proteins similar to Gag and Pol proteins of the sushi-ichi retrotransposon from fugu fish, and still retains a -1 frame-shifting mechanism to produce Gag-Pol (ORF1 and ORF2) fusion protein, as is always seen in the Ty3/Gypsy retrotransposons and retroviruses.4,7–9Peg10 deficient mice, which lack both ORF1 and ORF2, have early embryonic lethality before 10.5 days post-coitus owing to severe placental defects.10 Similarly, Peg11/Rtl1, another retrotransposon-derived imprinted gene highly conserved in the eutherian species, also plays an essential role in the maintenance of the placenta during pregnancy.11 Its loss leads to late fetal/neonatal lethality because of placental malfunction. PEG11 retrotransposon insertion occurred before divergence of the eutherians and marsupials, but PEG11 became degenerated in the marsupial lineage.12 Therefore, PEG11 is a eutherian-specific SIRH (Sushi-Ichi Retro-transposon Homologues) family gene, which is critical for the maintenance of the normal placental structure and function during the middle and late embryonic period in mice.11,13There are 11 genes that are similar to the sushi-ichi retrotransposon (SIRH family genes, also called MART or SUSHI genes), including PEG10 and PEG11/RTL1 in humans and mice, and they are highly conserved in the eutherian mammals.4,5,8,10,14–17 As mentioned above, PEG10/SIRH1 and PEG11/SIRH2 are paternally expressed imprinted genes on human chromosome 7q21/mouse proximal chromosome 6 and human chromosome 14q32/mouse distal chromosome 12, respectively.13,18 In mice, Sirh3/Ldoc1l is another autosomal gene showing biallelic expression on the distal chromosome 15, while Sirh4, Sirh5, Sirh6, Sirh7, Sirh8, Sirh9, Sirh10 and Sirh11 are located on the X chromosome. To elucidate functions of all the SIRH family genes, systematic production of KO (knock out) mice for all the SIRH family genes are now in the process. It is possible that the other SIRH family genes have essential functions like PEG10/SIRH1 and PEG11/SIRH2.With the recent availability of marsupial genome data, it is possible to screen marsupial-specific SIRH family genes by comparing them with those of eutherians and those of other vertebrate genomes. Here we report the identification of SIRH12 as a novel retrotransposon-derived gene in tammar wallaby.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Animals and tissue collectionTammar wallabies of Kangaroo Island origin were maintained in the University of Melbourne marsupial breeding colony in grassy, outdoor enclosures. Lucerne cubes, grass and water were provided ad libitum and supplemented with fresh vegetables. Fetuses and yolk sac placentas were collected between days 23 and 25 of the 26.5-d gestation.19,20 A series of tissues were collected from pouch young [d152 post partum (pp)]. Experimental procedures conformed to Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (1990) guidelines and were approved by the Animal Experimentation Ethics Committees of the University of Melbourne.2.2. RT-PCR and 5'- and 3'-RACEGenomic DNA and total RNA were prepared from fetuses and yolk sac placentas from wallaby conceptuses and several tissues from a pouch young, using TRISOL (Invitrogen), as described in manufacturer's protocol. cDNA was synthesized from 1 µg of total RNA using Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) with an oligo dT primer. Gene expression profiles were deduced by agarose gel electrophoresis of RT-PCR products with ethidium bromide (EtBr) staining. The primers used for the expression profiles were as follows: SIRH12-F (5'-TTTCTCCAGCTGTTCTGGCT-3'), SIRH12-R (5'-CAGGGTAGAGGGGAGGTTTC-3'), GAPDH-F (5'- AGAAAGTGGTGAAGCAGGCAT-3') and GAPDH-R (5'-TGGAGGACATGTAGACCATGAG-3'). RACE reactions were performed with wallaby liver and large intestine using RNA SMARTER RACE cDNA Amplification kit (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The 5'- and 3'-RACE fragments were generated with the gene-specific primers SIRH12-5'-RACE (5'-TCCATGTGGCCAAGTTCTGAGGATTC-3') and SIRH12-3'-RACE (5'-GAATCCTCAGAACTTGGCCACATGGA-3'), respectively. PCR conditions were as described previously.52.3. Comparative genomics analysisIdentification of SIRH family genes was performed using the TBLASTN and BLSTP program from NCBI server (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/) against eutherian and marsupial genomes using sushi-ichi Gag protein as a query (GenBank ID. AF030881). Sequence analysis was performed using the ClustalW program (http://clustalw.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/top-j.html). The sequences of opossum SIRH12 syntenic region [6993247–8893247 Monodelphis domestica chromosome 3 genomic contig, reference assembly (based on MonDom5)], tammar wallaby Macropus eugenii SIRH12 region, mouse Sirh12 syntenic region (5099338–6288585 Mus musculus strain C57BL/6J chromosome 13 genomic contig, MGSCv37), human SIRH12 syntenic region (c24594359–23494359 Homo sapiens chromosome 5 genomic contig, GRCh37.p2 reference primary assembly), platypus (12010399–12780399 Ornithorhynchus anatinus chromosome 1 genomic contig, reference assembly [based on Ornithorhynchus_anatinus-5.0.1)], chicken (930001–1330000 Gallus gallus chromosome Z genomic contig, reference assembly [based on Gallus_gallus-2.1)], Frog (c1800000–1200001 Xenopus (Silurana) tropicalis unplaced genomic scaffold, v4.2 XENTRscaffold_113) and Fugu (FUGU4:scaffold_49:800001:930000:-1) were extracted from NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). The tammar BAC (Bacterial artificial chromosome) library (MEB1) were screened using tammar SIRH12 sequence as a probe by PCR at the RIKEN Yokohama Institute. Sequence of BAC clone (MEB1-141D12), which includes SIRH12 was determined at the National Institute of Genetics by a combined shotgun/nested deletion strategy adopted to sequence the BAC inserts as described previously.21–24 The primer sequences and conditions for their use are available on request. The sequence data have been submitted to GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) under GenBank ID. JF720345. RepeatMasker (http://www.repeatmasker.org) was used for the detection of long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs), short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs) and LTR elements in the genomic region. Alignments were obtained using the VISTA Web server (http://www-gsd.lbl.gov/VISTA). SIRH12 syntenic regions of several species identified above were aligned using the default setting (>70% identity and >100 bp in length) of mVISTA with the LAGAN program.3. Results3.1. Identification of a SIRH family gene in marsupialsSushi-ichi is the first full-length vertebrate LTR retrotransposon isolated from Fugu fish. The sushi-ichi Gag protein has a unique amino acid sequence among the LTR retrotransposons, so sushi-ichi retrotransposon homologues (SIRH) were screened by TBLASTN and BLASTP analyses. In humans and mice, 11 SIRH family genes have been identified previously.4,5,8,10,14–17 (Table 1A, B). In two marsupials (the grey short-tailed opossum and tammar wallaby), five sequences were identified in tammar wallaby (Table 1C) and none in the grey short-tailed opossum. One corresponded to tammar PEG10 as previously reported.6 Another sequence (GenBank ID. ABQO010016898) also shared high homology in the amino acid sequence with other SIRH family genes, therefore, we named it SIRH12, as a novel candidate in the SIRH gene family (Fig. 1). The remaining three sequences seemed to be non-functional because their open reading frames had accumulated multiple nonsense mutations.

Genomic structure and expression of SIRH12 in tammar wallaby pouch young tissuesSIRH12 full-length sequence consisting of 1492 bp was determined by 5' RACE (Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends) and 3'-RACE (GenBank ID. JF710845). SIRH12 is an intron-less gene, as are most SIRH family genes, such as SIRH3, SIRH4, SIRH5, SIRH6, SIRH7, SIRH8 and SIRH10. SIRH12 has a candidate ORF consisting of 107 amino acids showing high similarity with the Gag protein of sushi-ichi (Fig. 2A). However, it lacks CCHC zinc finger motif, conserved in the Gag protein in retrotransposons and retoviruses, and a part corresponding with Pol protein that is retained in PEG10, PEG11/RTL1 and SIRH9. LTR sequences that are usually attached at both ends of the retrotransposons and retoviruses are not recognizable as there are no terminal redundancy sequences and no homology with existing LTR sequences within both 5 kb sequences of upstream and downstream of SIRH12. Therefore, SIRH12 may be transcribed from a promoter that was derived from host genome. However, it is also possible that a promoter on the SIRH12 LTR has degenerated during evolution but still drives SIRH12 transcription. All these data suggest that SIRH12 has already lost its retotranspositional ability. Genomic structure and expression profiles of SIRH12. (A) Genomic structure of full-length tammar SIRH12.

SIRH12 was not expressed in head and limb but was expressed in the bodies of the tammar fetuses and yolk sac placentas while, in pouch young tissues, SIRH12 was expressed in the endoderm-derived tissues, liver, pancreas, large intestine, spleen and stomach, but was not detected in the lung nor in the tissues primarily of mesodermal and ectodermal origin, namely kidney, heart, adrenal and bladder. This endodermal expression pattern in pouch young is unique compared with those of other SIRH family genes in the eutherian mammals, while expression in the placenta is relatively common in SIRH family genes.3.3. Comparative analysis of SIRH12To elucidate whether SIRH12 is an orthologue for either one of the SIRH1-11 genes in humans and mice, precise mapping of tammar wallaby SIRH12 was carried out by sequencing a wallaby BAC clone containing SIRH12. SIRH12 was located between two neighbouring genes, ENC1 (ectodermal-neural cortex) and RGNEF (Rho-guanine nucleotide exchange factor) that are conserved in vertebrates. In the BAC sequence, there are several syntenic regions, so-called evolutionary conserved regions (ECRs A–I in Fig. 3A), in the interval between ENC1 and RGNEF. ECRs B, C, D and I are conserved among all three mammalian groups including the egg-laying mammals (the monotreme platypus), while ECRs A, E, F, G and H are conserved only in therian mammals (the eutherians and marsupials). It is clear that tammar SIRH12 is located between ECRs C and D and that a SIRH12 orthologue in the South American opossum resides in the same location, although it is degenerated and does not have a long ORF corresponding to the wallaby SIRH12 (Fig. 3B). Importantly, in eutherian mammals there are no SIRH12 orthologues present between the ECRs C and D. The same is true of the platypus, chicken, frog and fish, indicating that SIRH12 retrotransposition occurred only in the marsupial lineage after their divergence from the eutherian mammals that occurred between 130 and 148 million years ago.25,26Mapping and comparative genomic analysis of the tammar wallaby SIRH12.

When these regions coincide with exonic sequences of ENC1 or RGNEF, the peaks are shaded in purple. There are nine ECRs (evolutionary conserved regions) in the tammar BAC sequence (ECRs A–I; green boxes) between mice and opossum in a region orthologous to ENC1/RGNEF.

There is no evidence of SIRH12 in eutherian mammals, monotremes, chicken and fugu.3.4. Evolutions of SIRH family genesUsing published sequences, we compared the entire region between ENC1 and RGNEF among several vertebrates from fish (fugu) to mammals. As is reported, the size of this region is the smallest in fugu fish and that of opossum is the largest. There are numerous LINEs and SINEs (red and green bars in Fig. 4) in all mammalian groups. By insertions of these elements mammalian genomes become longer than those of fugu fish and chicken. Consistent with the previous report, LTR-type retrotransposons are absent in the platypus27 (blue bars in Fig. 4). The PEG10 retrotransposon insertion occurred in the genome of the therian ancestor and was incorporated into the genomes of both marsupials and eutherians6 (Fig. 5A), while PEG11/RTL1 is a eutherian-specific gene12 (Fig. 5B). It is highly likely that other eutherian SIRH family genes, SIRH3 to SIRH11, are not present in the marsupials (M. Naruse, M. Ishii and R. Ono, unpublished data), suggesting that their retrotranspositions occurred only in the eutherian lineage. Our data in this report indicate that the original SIRH12 was retrotransposed into the ancestral marsupial genome after the eutherian–marsupial divergence and became incorporated into the tammar wallaby genome but degenerated in that of the opossum (Fig. 5C).

DiscussionIn this study, we identified a novel sushi-ichi retrotransposon-derived gene, SIRH12, in the tammar wallaby, an Australian marsupial species of the kangaroo family. Comparative genomic analysis suggests that SIRH12 is present in the marsupial lineage but is not present in the eutherian and monotreme lineages. Together with other SIRH genes, PEG10, PEG11/RTL1 and SIRH3-11, it is probable that the sushi-ichi-like retrotransposons were once active and retrotransposed around the time of the divergence between marsupials and eutherians, contributing to the evolution of both the extant eutherian and marsupial mammals. In general, as retrotransposons are harmful for host animals, they tend to be inactivated by DNA methylation, nonsense and frame-shift mutations.28 However, some were incorporated into their genomes and became functional, so were selected positively, presumably because they were advantageous to their host animals.10,11,29–33 Although it remains unknown when the opossum SIRH12 degenerated after its incorporation in the marsupial lineage, SIRH12 may be functional at least in the wallaby because its protein-coding frame has been maintained and is actively transcribed in several tissues. As species-specific genes are strong candidates for species-specific functions, it would be interesting to know whether SIRH12 has a specific function. The opossum and the tammar are very different marsupials. The tammar is a macropodid marsupial of the highly evolved kangaroo family, but the grey short-tailed opossum is a generalized marsupial closest in form to the ancestral marsupials. The tammar placenta is more highly specialized than that of the opossum34 and there are many structural and functional differences between tammar and opossum placentas.35–37 Although both Peg10 and Peg11 are derived from the sushi-ichi retrotransposon and have Gag and Pol-like sequences, they have biologically very different functions: the former has a function in the formation of spongiotrophoblast and labyrinth layer, while the latter has a function in the maintenance of feto-maternal interface.10,11 Therefore, SIRH family genes could have a wide variety of functions not only in the placenta but in some other organs to perform eutherian- or marsupial-specific functions. Because tammar SIRH12 is expressed in the yolk sac placenta, it is therefore possible that SIRH12 fulfils some role in tammar placentation.FundingThis work was supported in part by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Priority Area (R.O.) and Innovative Areas ‘Genome Science’ (R.O., Y.K., A.T.) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) of Japan, Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientist (R.O.), Creative Science Research (F.I. and T.K.-I.), and Bilateral Program on Joint Research Project (F.I.) from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (J.S.P.S.), grants from Mochida Memorial Foundation for Medical and Pharmaceutical Research and The Nakajima Foundation (R.O.).

The resources are available at http://marker.kazusa.or.jp/Daikon.1. IntroductionDNA markers are essential tools for plant genetics. In early studies, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) techniques were widely used since no sequence information was required for their development. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is the most abundant source of genomic variation, and genetic studies using large-scale genotyping of SNPs have been performed with several plant species.1–5 However, SNP markers only detect two alleles and biases in allelic frequency reflect the targeted population structure,5 making it difficult to develop SNP markers that widely function across species. Although no similar high-throughput genotyping system has been developed for simple sequence repeats (SSR), these markers have several advantages over SNPs, including multi-allelic detection, high-transferability across species and flexibility with various laboratory systems.6 SSR markers can be classified into two categories: genomic SSRs and expressed sequence tag (EST)-SSRs, which are designed from intergenic and intragenic sequences, respectively. Even though the polymorphic ratio of EST-SSR markers is sometimes lower than that of genomic SSRs, EST-SSRs can be expected to have greater transferability between species than genomic SSRs, since genic regions are more likely to be conserved among related species/genera.5Comparative genomics has had a significant impact on the fields of plant genetics and genomics. It has provided information on genomic evolution through the identification of chromosomal rearrangements and duplication/deletion events, as well as enabling large amounts of knowledge gained by studying model plants to be transferred to crops. The dicot species Arabidopsis thaliana (2n = 10) is a member of the family Brassicaceae. A. thaliana is the most studied model plant and extensive genomic resources have been developed in this species, including genomic sequences, EST information, mutant lines, DNA libraries and molecular markers, all of which are available to the research community (http://www.arabidopsis.org).7 Similarly, the Brassica belong to the Brassicaceae and many Brassica species are cultivated as vegetable and oil crops. Commercially important Brassica species include broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, Chinese cabbage, turnip, oilseed, and black mustard. Therefore, it is not surprising that the genomes of many members of the Brassica have been well studied. In particular, karyotype analysis has shown that B. rapa (2n = 20), B. nigra (2n = 16), and B. oleracea (2n = 18) are diploids with AA, BB, and CC genomes, respectively. In contrast, B. juncea (AABB: 2n = 36), B. carinata (BBCC: 2n = 34) and B. napus (AACC: 2n = 38) are amphidiploids, which were derived from combinations of two of the diploids.8 Comparative genomics between A. thaliana and different members of the Brassica have revealed syntenies in which regions of the A. thaliana genome have doubled or tripled.9–11 In B. rapa, comparative studies have enabled map-based or candidate-gene cloning strategies to identify several quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and genes for agronomically important traits, such as flowering time, leaf morphology, and disease resistance.12,13Raphanus sativus (2n = 2x = 18) is also a member of the Brassicaceae and it is used around the world as a vegetable crop, i.e. the radish or Japanese daikon. In particular, R. sativus is a common crop in East Asia and is the second most produced vegetable in Japan (www.e-stat.go.jp). The genus Raphanus is originated from coastal regions along the Mediterranean and Black Seas and it is classified into two sections that comprise six species.14R. sativus was thought to have derived by hybridization between R. maritimus and R. landra, exhibiting an RR genome of 468–662 Mb.14–16Raphanus sativus genomic research has not progressed as far as for members of the Brassica, possibly because the genus Raphanus is less speciose and less economically important. Several genetic maps of R. sativus have been constructed using RFLP, AFLP, and RAPD markers, and these have been applied to QTL identification of disease and pest resistance, the shape and pigmentation of roots, and the flowering time.14,17–19 However, few studies have reported comparative genomics between R. sativus and A. thaliana because the R. sativus maps have no sequence-tagged markers. Kamei et al.18 used genomic SSR markers for B. rapa to perform a genetic analysis of R. sativus, but found low transferability of markers between the two species. Therefore, further advances in the genetic and genomic analyses of R. sativus will require the development of genic sequence-based markers.In the present study, genomic resources were developed for R. sativus. These resources include cDNA libraries, EST sequences, EST-SSR markers, and a genetic map, all of which have great advantages to subsequent genomic studies in comparison with genomic SSR markers. Comparison with the A. thaliana genome indicated that the two genomes differentiated from a common ancestor and that A. thaliana genomic fragments had been doubled and tripled in the R. sativus genome. This comparative map could be used for the identification of candidate genes in QTLs from R. sativus.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materialsPreviously, an F2 mapping population derived from a cross between two inbred lines, ‘GSK3-1’ and ‘HA2’, was used for construction of a genetic map of R. sativus.14 ‘GSK3-1’ is a selfed progeny from a leading Japanese variety of R. sativus known as Utsugi-Gensuke and ‘HA2’ is a Tokinashi type that exhibits late bolting. In the present study, F8–10 progeny (n = 155) generated by single seed descent were used as recombinant inbred lines for linkage analysis. Genomic DNA from each line was extracted using the DNeasy Plant Mini kit (Qiagen, Germany).2.2. Development of EST-derived SSR markersPlant RNA Purification Reagent (Invitrogen, USA) was used to extract total RNA from 5 g samples of seedlings, roots, leaves, and flowers of R. sativus ‘GSK3-1’. cDNA libraries were constructed for each organ and then sequencing analysis and data processing were performed as described previously.20 High-quality reads that comprised >50 bp of contiguous sequence were submitted to the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank databases with the accession numbers FY428055 to FY454660. BLASTN was used to perform similarity searches between non-redundant R. sativus ESTs that clustered using the PHRAD program and the UniGene data sets for R. sativus, A. thaliana, B. napus, B. oleracea, B. rapa, Lotus japonicas, and Oryza sativa (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/unigene). BLASTX searches against amino acid sequences in the KOG set (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/COG) enabled EST contigs to be classified into KOG categories.21 These sequence similarities were judged to be significant when the E-value was less than 1e-10.Microsatellites or SSRs of =15 nucleotides in length were identified. All possible combinations of di- (NN), tri- (NNN), and tetra-nucleotide (NNNN) repeats were represented. Primer pairs were designed against the flanking sequences of each SSR, as described previously.22PCR reactions were performed using 0.5 ng genomic DNA in each 5 µl reaction. In addition to template, PCR reaction mixes contained 1 × PCR buffer (BIOLINE, UK), 3 mM MgCl2, 0.04U BIOTAQ™ DNA polymerase (BIOLINE, UK), 0.2 mM dNTPs, and 0.8 µM of each primer. The thermal cycling conditions were as follows: 1 min denaturation at 94°C; 35 cycles of 30 s denaturation at 94°C, 30 s annealing at 60°C and 1 min extension at 72°C; and a final 3 min extension at 72°C. The PCR products were separated by 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in TBE buffer, according to the standard protocol, or with a Type 3730 DNA fragment analyzer (Applied Biosystems, USA). In the latter case, the data were analysed using GeneMapper software (Applied Biosystems, USA).2.3. Genotyping and map constructionLinkage analysis was performed with genotypic data derived using the EST-SSR markers developed in this study, as well as segregation data generated from 223 published RAPD, RFLP, and trait marker loci,14,23,24 using JoinMap® software version 4.25 The marker loci were classified roughly into nine linkage groups using the JoinMap® grouping module and LOD scores of 4.0–10.0. The mapped positions of the RAPD, RFLP, and trait marker loci were used as a frame for linkage analysis. Marker order and genetic distance were calculated using a regression mapping algorithm and the following parameters: Haldane's mapping function, recombination frequency =0.35 and LOD score =2.0.2.4. Synteny analysisR. sativus amino acid sequences were deduced from mapped ESTs. BLASTX was used to compare predicted R. sativus sequences against the TAIR9-predicted protein database (http://www.arabidopsis.org) with a threshold E-value of 1e-50. Because Kim et al.11 reported a B. rapa genetic map constructed with EST-based markers, a comparative map between A. thaliana and B. rapa was also constructed by locating nucleotide sequences of marker loci from B. rapa on the A. thaliana genome.3. Results3.1. Features of R. sativus ESTsA total of 32 256 cDNA clones, including 9216 clones from a seedling library, 7680 clones from a root library, 7680 clones from a leaf library, and 7680 clones from a flower library, were sequenced from the 5'end. A total of 26 606 sequences (8458, 6320, 6721, and 5107 from seedling, root, leaf, and flower libraries, respectively) consisting of 19 391 246 qualified bases were obtained, and the average EST length was 729 bp.The PHRAD program was used to cluster EST sequences in order to identify the number of independent EST species. These analyses indicated 10 381 potential non-redundant EST sequences, which included 6625 contigs and 3756 singletons with an average GC content of 45.6%. Non-redundant EST sequences were compared against the Unigene data of R. sativus, A. thaliana, B. napus, B. oleracea, B. rapa, L. japonicas, and O. sativa (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/unigene). These comparisons indicated 9758 non-redundant ESTs with significant similarity (E-value <1e-10) to registered sequences of the seven species and the remaining 623 non-redundant ESTs were unique to the data from this study.To investigate the functional classification of R. sativus ESTs, BLASTX was used to compare non-redundant EST sequences with eukaryotic clusters of orthologous groups (KOGs) and these ESTs were then classified into KOG categories.21 Among the 10 381 non-redundant R. sativus EST sequences, 6265 showed similarities to KOG sequences that have functional classification, and their distribution is similar to those of the seven species (Fig. 1).

SSR motifs in R. sativus ESTsIn silico data mining of the 26 606 sequences yielded 3800 SSR markers, which were designated as RSS (Raphanus sativus EST-derived SSR) markers (Supplementary Table S1). Out of the 3800 SSR markers, 3733 markers (98.2%) had motif lengths ranging from 20 to 35 bases (Supplementary Table S1). The RSS marker motifs contained 3094 (81.4%), 381 (10.0%), and 325 (8.6%) tri-, di-, and tetra-nucleotide repeats, respectively (Table 1). The most abundant trinucleotide repeats were poly (AAG)n (21.4%), poly (GGA)n (14.2%), and poly (ATC)n (10.1%). Four types of dinucleotide repeats were observed and the poly (AG)n motifs were the most abundant (6.8%). The tetranucleotide repeats poly (AAAG)n (2.7%), poly (AAAC)n (2.1%) and poly (AAAT)n (1.4%) were more frequently observed than the other motifs. Among the 3800 SSR motifs, 1604 and 242 were located on coding and untranscribed regions, respectively (Table 1, Supplementary Table S1). SSRs on coding regions consisted of 30 di-, 1533 tri-, and 41 tetra-nucleotide repeat motifs, while those on untranscribed regions included 96 di-, 104 tri-, and 42 terta-nucleotide repeat motifs. The other 1954 SSRs were not assigned to the regions because the length of each EST was not enough to predict open reading frames.

Linkage analysis and map constructionAll 3800 SSR markers were used for polymorphic analysis of parental lines from the mapping population and 642 (16.9%) SSR markers were selected (Table 1, Supplementary Table S1). These markers identified 18 double polymorphic loci and one triple polymorphic locus and, consequently, 662 polymorphic loci were generated from the 642 SSR markers. Among the 662 SSR loci, 545 and 117 identified co-dominant and dominant loci, respectively. Null alleles were observed in 98 and 19 of the 117 dominant markers from ‘HA2’ and ‘GSK3-1’, respectively. The polymorphic ratios of the di-, tri-, and tetra-nucleotide repeats were 19.9, 16.3, and 19.1%, respectively, and the polymorphic ratio of SSRs on UTRs (20.2%) were higher than that on coding regions (16.8%) (Table 1).Segregation data were generated from the 662 SSR and 223 RAPD, RFLP, and trait marker loci in the mapping population. Following linkage analysis, 843 loci (630 SSR and 213 RAPD, RFLP and trait loci) were mapped into nine linkage groups, while the remaining 42 loci (32 SSR and 10 RAPD, RFLP, and trait loci) were excluded from the analysis. Linkage groups were named according to the previous report.14 The linkage groups covered 1129.2 cM (Table 2, Fig. 2, and Supplementary Table S2) and the average distance between neighbouring loci was 1.3 cM, with distances ranging from 1.0 cM in linkage group 3 (LG3) to 2.0 cM in LG6. Segregation distortion was observed for 8.9% of the mapped marker loci (Table 2 and Supplementary Table S2). The segregation distortion ratios varied among linkage groups; LG5 showed distortions with 3.7% of the mapped loci, while LG2 showed distortions for 20.2% of the loci.

Detailed information about the map and markers is shown in Supplementary Table S2 and is also available at http://marker.kazusa.or.jp/Daikon.3.4. Genomic comparison of R. sativus, A. thaliana, and B. rapaBLASTX was used to compare the nucleotide sequences of 630 ESTs mapped into linkage groups with the predicted-protein database of A. thaliana. Of the 630 ESTs, 358 showed significant homology (=1e-50 E-value) to 500 A. thaliana genes, and 230, 87, and 22 ESTs mapped onto one, two, and three regions of the A. thaliana genome, respectively, while 19 other ESTs mapped onto four or five regions and 273 ESTs showed no significant homology to the A. thaliana genome (Supplementary Table S2). To compare the genome structures of R. sativus and A. thaliana, syntenic regions were deduced when more than three continuous EST loci on R. sativus linkage groups aligned to a single portion of the genome of A. thaliana. Chromosomal segments of A. thaliana were assigned onto the R. sativus genetic map (Fig. 2). Approximately 65% (739.1 cM) of the genetic map was covered by 35 A. thaliana chromosome segments, which ranged from one segment on LG9 to six segments on LG3 and LG4. The longest segment (84.4 cM) was found on LG2 and it had derived from A. thaliana Chr2. The shortest segment (2.1 cM) was detected on LG7 and it arose from Chr1. The average length of a single segment was 21.1 cM.Conversely, the R. sativus genetic map could be assigned to almost the whole A. thaliana genome, with the exception of the ribosomal DNA repeat regions on Chr2 and Chr4 (Fig. 3). R. sativus linkage groups showed average mapped depths of 2.0 on the A. thaliana genome and depths ranged from 1 to 4. Two R. sativus linkage groups were redundantly assigned to 48% of the A. thaliana genome and the remaining 18, 24, and 4% of the A. thaliana genome were covered by single, triple, and quadruple R. sativus linkage groups, respectively. A. thaliana Chr3 was covered with two R. sativus LG3s, each of which was derived from both distal parts of LG3, respectively (Supplementary Table S2). In addition to the R. sativus map, a published genetic map of B. rapa was also assigned onto the A. thaliana genome. This analysis confirmed that the B. rapa genome contains two or three copies of at least 24 genomic segments from A. thaliana, as suggested by a previous report.11 The average mapped depth of B. rapa linkage groups on the A. thaliana genome was 1.4 and ranged from 1 to 3. Forty-eight per cent of the A. thaliana genome was covered by two B. rapa linkage groups, while 24 and 7% of the genome was covered by single and triple B. rapa linkage groups. Large syntenic segments were identified between the three species on the following A. thaliana (At) chromosomes: At Chr1, B. rapa (Br) LG9, R. sativus (Rs) LG7, and Rs LG9; At Chr2, Br LG3, Br LG4, Rs LG2, and LG4; At Chr3, Br LG3 and Rs LG3; At Chr4, Br LG 3, Br LG8, Rs LG4, Rs LG5, and Rs LG7; and At Ch5, Br LG10, and Rs LG2. Scattered syntenic segments were also observed on several genomic regions of A. thaliana. The most overlapping and disrupted syntenic region was identified on a distal part of the long arm of At Chr5. Synteny map of A. thaliana and R. sativus or B. rapa.

DiscussionA genetic map of R. sativus was constructed using 630 EST-SSR and 213 RAPD, RFLP, and trait marker loci. This map comprised nine linkage groups, which corresponded to the number of chromosomes in haploid R. sativus (n = 9). The genetic map was calculated to cover 1129.2 cM and the average interval between marker loci was 1.3 cM. To our knowledge, this map comprises the highest number and density of marker loci of all the published R. sativus genetic maps.14,17–19,26,27 However, the genetic map generated in this study was shorter than the map reported by Budahn et al.,17 which was 1517 cM. That map was constructed using 245 F2 plants and most of mapped markers were dominant, i.e. AFLPs and RAPDs. In contrast, the map from this study was developed using 155 RILs, with a large number of co-dominant SSR markers. These differences in length can be accounted for by the differences in size of mapping population, as well as in the number and types of DNA markers.28 Another contributing factor could be differences in the frequency of chromosome recombination caused by environmental factors and genetic diversity of the mapping parents.29,30EST-SSR markers are often preferable to RFLP, AFLP, and RAPD markers, since EST nucleotide sequences generally show higher levels of similarity across different species, genera, and families than sequences from intergenic regions. Therefore, the primers of EST-SSR markers are often directly applicable to PCR analyses of related species, although the efficiency of transferability depends upon the genetic distance between the species.6 Moreover, the multi-allelic nature of SSRs makes them more efficient than SNP markers for polymorphic analysis of diverse accessions. A preliminary experiment showed that R. sativus EST-SSR markers could be transferred to a mapping population derived from a cross between a Japanese daikon and a rat-tailed radish. PCR amplified specific DNA fragments in 665 (98%) of 676 tested EST-SSR markers and 291 (43%) markers showed polymorphism between the two lines. The order of mapped markers on this linkage map matched the order on the high-density linkage map from this study (data not shown).EST-based markers are also valuable for comparisons of genome structure between different plant species. To demonstrate their utility, R. sativus and A. thaliana were compared using homoeologies between amino acid sequences predicted from the EST sequences and their locations on the present linkage map. The genetic map of R. sativus was covered by at least 35 disrupted A. thaliana genomic fragments and 90% of the genetic map corresponded to regions of the A. thaliana genome that had been doubled, tripled, or quadrupled. All ESTs that mapped onto LG9 in the R. sativus map corresponded to ca. 70% of A. thaliana Chr5. However, no perfectly homologous linkage groups were observed within the genetic map of R. sativus. These results suggest that the tripling of the R. sativus genome occurred at some point after divergence from its common ancestor with A. thaliana, and that this amplification was followed by structural rearrangements, including deletion of parts of the chromosomes. Alternatively, one part of the genome may have undergone a duplication event, while another part tripled. These events may have occurred at or after the time of divergence between R. sativus and A. thaliana, ca. 20 million years ago.31,32In addition to comparative analysis between R. sativus and A. thaliana, the genome structure of B. rapa was compared with R. sativus via the A. thaliana genome. The two species shared large syntenic regions across the A. thaliana genome, which suggests that large regions of the R. sativus and B. rapa genomes are conserved. Several scattered syntenic regions were also observed on the A. thaliana genome, e.g. the distal part of the long arm of Chr5. However, there was no conservation in the order or composition of the corresponding genomic segments between R. sativus and B. rapa (Fig. 3),11 which suggests no chromosomal synteny in this region among the three species. Absence of chromosomal synteny was also reported between A. thaliana and B. oleracea or B. nigra.9,10 It has been suggested that the three Brassica diploids, i.e. B. rapa, B. oleracea, and B. nigra, evolved via chromosomal structural rearrangements and/or polyploidy.9–11 The results from this study confirm the hypothesis that R. sativus and the three Brassica diploids differentiated independently from a common ancestor with A. thaliana and that this divergence occurred via genome rearrangement and/or polyploidy events at and/or after differentiation.Since the first report for artificial amphidiploids between R. sativus and B. oleracea,33 amphidiploids derived from crosses between several combinations of Brassicaceae have been synthesized.34 Because the amphidiploids were important materials for plant breeding due to their vigorous growths and adaptability for alien chromosomes, the mechanisms for the hybridization and the amphidiploid formation have been investigated by cytogenetic, epigenetic, and genomic approaches.33 According to our results of the comparative genomics of the Brassicaceae, chromosomal synteny is unnecessary for hybridization and the amphidiploid formation, suggesting that genetic factors like Ph1 reported in wheat,35 micro-syntenies, and/or nuclear-organella interactions might be required.As has been observed with the genetic and genomic studies of Brassica species,12,13 a comparative map between R. sativus and the A. thaliana genome will accelerate gene identification in Raphanus species. In particular, it will aid candidate gene isolation since a large number of genes/traits have already been characterized and mapped onto the A. thaliana genome. Kaneko et al.14 identified a QTL associated with resistance to yellow disease caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. raphani, and this QTL was linked to the OPJ14 locus on LG1. According to our comparative map between R. sativus and A. thaliana, this locus is predicted to correspond to the long arm of A. thaliana Chr1, 27 Mb from the top of the chromosome (Supplementary Table S2). TIR-NBS genes have been implicated in disease resistance in many plant species.36 A cluster of these genes was identified in the chromosomal region of A. thaliana that corresponds to resistance to yellow disease in the comparative map, a finding which suggests that a member of the TIR-NBS gene family is responsible for F. oxysporum resistance in R. sativus.The R. sativus EST data, SSR markers and genetic map developed in this study can be used for various genetic analyses including gene mapping, QTL analysis, population genetics, marker-assisted breeding, and whole-genome sequencing studies. This study has provided a standard map for genomics, genetics, and breeding of R. sativus and related species.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by the Kazusa DNA Research Institute and the Mikado Kyowa Seed Co., Ltd.We are grateful to Prof. Kazunari Nomura (Nihon University, Japan) for providing the rat-tailed radish.Supplementary data"

IntroductionClassifying high-level phenotypes based on high-throughput gene-level data1 is a fundamental task in bioinformatics, and analysing corresponding sets of important features improves our understanding of the genotype–phenotype map,2 delivering basic insights into the biology underlying a particular phenotype. For the cellular phenotype commonly called ‘pluripotent stem cell’3 and its more heterogeneous counterpart ‘differentiated’ or ‘non-pluripotent stem’ cell, we set out to collect data in the form of gene expression data (microarrays) from the GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus database4). Gene expression data are among the most abundant molecular data, and they are still very close to the true genotype of the (static) genome; they may inform us about which genes are responsible for the phenotype we wish to understand. This information comes in several ways. It is of interest:
A univariate statistical testing approach (often involving normalization/regularization) together with the inspection of ‘fold change’ is a standard approach to answer question a.5–7 Answers to question b shall yield a comprehensive description of the molecular basis of pluripotency, based on machine learning and feature selection approaches. Answers to question c shall highlight the ‘tips of the iceberg’, and are useful to define small sets of best biomarkers for pluripotency; such ‘minimal-best’ approaches to machine learning have gained popularity in recent years, in particular in search for cancer biomarkers.8–13(a) Which genes are differentially expressed, i.e. expressed more or less strongly in the pluripotent stem cell state, compared to the differentiated one?(b)  Which sets of genes enable the best distinction of the pluripotent stem cell state from the differentiated one, considering their (differential) expression?(c)  Which small sets of genes still enable a good distinction of the two states?In the past years, the difference between pluripotent stem cells (e.g. embryonic stem/ES cells) and differentiated (e.g. fibroblast) cells has triggered a great deal of interest; it is at the centre of basic research into developmental biology.3,14 At the same time, there are a multitude of potential applications in regenerative medicine and beyond.15 Moreover, exciting progress has been made in the in vitro control of basic cellular phenotypes.16,17 Finally, computational methods such as hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis have been used to investigate pluripotency and differentiation in systematic ways, often based on gene expression data.18–20 At the end of the Discussion section, further related work will be discussed.In this paper, we start with a large normalized data set of gene expression experiments obtained from the mouse, using the answer to question a to filter out genes that are not informative. We then tackle question b taking a machine learning approach (including appropriate cross-validation), and we use various machine learning methods resulting in high-accuracy classifiers based on gene expression signatures. Finally, we look into question c by using feature selection methods such as genetic algorithms (GAs)21 to obtain classifiers of slightly lower accuracy, working with few features (genes). We evaluate the feature lists obtained to assess their biological plausibility by enrichment analyses. Finally, we discuss the value we may put into the ‘newly discovered’ genes that are supposedly involved in pluripotency.2. Methods2.1. Gene expression dataWe obtained gene expression data from the GEO database,4 taking samples from experiments (data series) related to pluripotency in the mouse, and aiming for a large data set, correctness in class labels and variety in phenotype. As GEO data series usually consist of no more than 5–20 samples, we collected gene expression data from many different GEO series. To ensure straightforward comparability and easy merging of data based on an identical set of probes, we decided to use only data series from the Affymetrix mouse 430.2 oligonucleotide chip (GEO: GPL1261), which is the most popular platform available, containing 45 101 probe sets. To consider a GEO series, it had to contain at least one sample that we could label pluripotent; usually, the GEO series consisted of a mixture of pluripotent and non-pluripotent samples. Based on the sample descriptions, we manually identified samples as pluripotent or non-pluripotent and labelled them as positive (pluripotent) or negative (non-pluripotent). If we were not sure about the label of a sample, we dismissed it rather than risk adding an incorrectly labelled sample. In this paper, pluripotency always refers to stem cells; we do not consider data from cells like zygotes that are pluripotent, but do not have the ability to self-renew. As different microarray platforms have different approaches on how to sample the transcriptome, and about how to represent the concept of ‘genes', the details may differ between different platforms. However, they should converge on the more generic levels of annotation, in particular with respect to most of the UniGene gene symbol annotations of the genes in our analysis; in our analysis, we study mouse genes.The positively labelled samples are gene expression data of pluripotent stem cells and the inner cell mass (ICM) of the embryo, whereas the negatively labelled samples arise from all sorts of differentiated cells/tissues. We took care to sample a variety of types of pluripotency, including ‘late stages’ up to embryonic day 3.5, pluripotent germline stem cells and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, and of differentiated phenotypes, including ‘early stages’ from embryoid bodies of day 5 onwards, germline stem cells and partially reprogrammed iPS. More specifically, we included samples described as pluripotent from embryonic stem cells (GSE4309, GSE10806, GSE10871 and others), from the ICM up to embryonic day 3.5 (GSE4309), from germline pluripotent stem cells (GSE11274) and from iPS cells (GSE10806, GSE10871 and others). We included samples described as differentiated from embryoid bodies of day 5 (GSE9563) and day 10 (GSE3653), from partially reprogrammed iPS cells (GSE10871), from germline stem cells (GSE10610, GSE11274) and from tissues including testis, ovary and foetus (GSE9954), but also a wide variety of other organs (GSE9954). The final data set contains 286 samples from 25 GEO data series; 146 labelled as pluripotent and 140 labelled as non-pluripotent (Supplementary Table S1).2.2. Data preprocessingTo summarize the probe sets from the Affymetrix gene expression arrays, we used the robust multi-array average method22,23 as implemented in the Affymetrix Power Tools.24 First, background adjustment was performed using unmodified perfect match intensities. Then, the intensities were quantile normalized.25 As quanti<U+FB01>cation method we used median polish.22,23 The resulting expression values are logarithmized on the log2 scale. We then combined all Affymetrix probe set identifiers that correspond to the same gene symbol from the UniGene record26 by calculating the mean value. This way, we obtained the expression values of 20 668 genes. This data set was the starting point for filtering, feature selection and classification, all in the framework of 3-fold cross-validation. Thus, the data set was randomly split into three subsets (folds), to set up a 3-fold cross-validation process. Two-thirds of the data were used to perform filtering, feature selection and finally training of classifiers. The classifiers were then tested on the remaining one-third of the data. This was repeated three times, using different folds for training and testing each time.As we wanted to identify genes that affect pluripotency, we preferred those having similar expression values within the pluripotent or the non-pluripotent samples and different expression values between these two groups—i.e. differentially expressed genes. Hence, we filtered the genes by applying a two-sample t-test for samples with unequal variances, testing the difference in mean expression of the genes in the respective training set and corrected resulting P-values based on the concept of false discovery rate.27 We dismissed all genes with a q-value (corrected P-value) larger than 0.1. Depending on the training set, we obtained lists of around 16 000 genes. These were sorted by their fold changes determined as log FCi = |Xi – Yi|, where Xi is the mean of the gene expression values of gene i for pluripotent samples, and Yi is the mean of the gene expression values of gene i for non-pluripotent samples, both on the log-scale. The first 5000 and the first 1000 genes of these lists formed our data sets for classification.As described, filtering, feature selection and training of classifiers were always performed on two-thirds of the data and testing on the remaining third. Only such strict separation of training and test data (which is unfortunately not standard practice, as noted by Rocha et al.28) can ensure that results are not overly optimistic. On each of the three folds, the GA was run 200 times. However, the whole data set was used for calculating feature importance (Fig. 1), for the list of biomarkers we found (Table 2) and for the enrichment analyses (Tables 3 and 4), since these parts of the work did not involve training and testing. In this case, the GA was run 500 times. Feature-importance distribution. Each feature (gene) from the 1000-gene data set was assigned an importance score by each of the three feature selection methods. The scores were scaled to the [0, 1] interval. The features were then sorted by their importance, separately for each method, and their importance was plotted.Feature-importance distribution. Each feature (gene) from the 1000-gene data set was assigned an importance score by each of the three feature selection methods. The scores were scaled to the [0, 1] interval. The features were then sorted by their importance, separately for each method, and their importance was plotted.In Supplementary File S2, we provide all lists of input genes we discuss here. Please note that the term ‘gene’ always refers to a gene from the mouse genome (UniGene gene symbol), and its function will be described based on its protein product. Genes are also called ‘features’ in the description of our machine learning methodology. Thus, ‘feature selection’ is synonymous with ‘gene selection’.2.3. ClassificationClassification using both the whole (filtered) data set, and the feature sets selected by the feature selection methods under investigation, was performed with the Weka machine learning suite.29 The following machine learning algorithms were used:
Concentrating on the discovery of optimal feature sets (biomarkers), we did not tune parameters to maximize classification performance, and all parameters of the machine learning algorithms were kept at Weka's default values. The only exception was the SVM with Gaussian kernel, for which the default LibSVM35 parameter values were used, consistent with the use of LibSVM during feature selection with the GA (see below). We briefly describe two of the machine learning algorithms: the random forest, because of its relevance to feature selection (see below), and the SVM, because it is the algorithm we also used for feature selection with the GA.Naive Bayes30;C4.5 decision trees, implemented in Weka as J4831;Random forest32;Nearest neighbour, implemented in Weka as IBk33;SVM, implemented in Weka as sequential minimal optimization (SMO).34The random forest32 is a machine learning approach working with an ensemble of decision trees. Let N be the size of the training set and M the number of features (in our case gene expression values). To grow a tree, N instances from the training set are selected randomly with replacement (which means that some are selected more than once and some never). Then m features (m << M) are selected randomly. Out of these, the one that splits the instances into sets purest with respect to the class is assigned to the root of the tree. This procedure is repeated recursively until the leaves of the tree contain only instances of one class (pluripotent or non-pluripotent in our case). The whole forest consists of a number of such decision trees. To classify an instance, it is classified by all the trees in the forest and the final class is selected by majority voting.The support vector machine (SVM34) finds a hyperplane across the M-dimensional space occupied by instances that best separates the two classes. In cases where the instances are not linearly separable, their features can be mapped into a higher-dimensional space. Let xi and xj be a pair of M-dimensional feature vectors. Let F(xi) and F(xj) be these vectors mapped into a higher-dimensional space. Since computing the hyperplane that separates the instances only involves computing inner products of feature vectors, the mapping can be efficiently accomplished by a kernel function K(xi, xj), which returns the inner product of F(xi) and F(xj) without explicitly performing the mapping. The linear kernel function returns the plain dot product: Klin(xi, xj) = xi · xj. The Gaussian kernel function is defined as follows: KGauss(xi, xj) = exp (–<U+03B3> (xi - xj)2). The value of <U+03B3> controls how much the classifier can adapt to an irregular boundary between classes, and must be selected by the experimenter. As mentioned before, we used the default LibSVM value of <U+03B3> = 1/number_of_features.The classification performance was evaluated by 3-fold cross-validation as described in the previous subsection. The performance is presented in terms of the accuracy and the area under the receiver operational characteristics (ROC) curve (AUC). The accuracy is defined as the number of correctly classified instances divided by the total number of instances. It is an appropriate measure when the data set has roughly the same number of instances belonging to each class (as is the case in ours), when misclassifying any class to any other class is equally undesirable and when one is interested in crisp classification. Let one class be considered negative (non-pluripotent in our case) and the other positive (pluripotent) and let the classifier return a continuous value (instead of just one class or the other). The ROC curve is a plot of the true positive rate vs. the false positive rate, obtained by varying the threshold above which the value returned by the classifier is considered to indicate the positive class. The true positive rate is the number of correctly classified positive instances, divided by the number of all positive instances (the probability to recognize pluripotent samples as such). The false positive rate is the number of incorrectly classified negative instances, divided by the number of all negative instances (the probability to mistake a non-pluripotent sample for a pluripotent one). The AUC is an aggregate measure of the performance of the classifier when one considers different thresholds in order to correctly classify more positive instances at the expense of misclassifying negative ones and vice versa. It is appropriate regardless of how many instances belong to each class.2.4. Feature selection with the information gain2.5. Feature selection with the random forestThis subsection describes the procedure to measure feature importance with the random forest32; an overview of how the random forest works is given in the Classification subsection. To grow a tree in a random forest, N instances from the training set are selected randomly with replacement. N is also the size of the training set, but since the instances are selected with replacement, around one-third of the training instances are left out—these are called the out-of-bag instances. The out-of-bag instances are classified with the tree and the number of correct classifications cbefore is counted. For each feature F, its values in the out-of-bag instances are randomly permuted, the out-of-bag instances are classified again and the new number of correct classifications cafter is counted. The difference between cbefore and cafter, averaged over all the trees in the forest, is a measure of the importance of F.Feature selection with the random forest was performed in a custom Weka distribution by Livingston.36 The number of trees in a forest was set to 1000 and the other parameters were kept at default values. A random forest was generated three times and the importance of features was averaged over the three runs.2.6. Feature selection with the GAWe are looking for small sets of genes that enable us to classify a sample as pluripotent or not, which we call minimal sets of best biomarkers. We search for such sets with the GA21 guided by a fitness function. The fitness of a gene set is defined by the classification accuracy of the SVM34 using that set of genes as features, and the size of the set. Thus, the objective of the GA is to find optimal sets of features for classification. Each set of genes/features is binary encoded in a ‘chromosome’. Each bit of the chromosome represents one gene/feature. If a gene belongs to the set of features encoded by the chromosome, the corresponding bit is set to 1, otherwise it is set to 0. (Apart from the binary representation used here, more compact representations may be used, as was done, for example, by Rocha et al.28 A systematic evaluation of such alternative representations is future work.) The initial population of 200 chromosomes is created by setting a random number of bits in each chromosome to 1, and calculating the fitness of the resulting feature set, as follows. The value |set_of_all_genes| is the number of filtered genes we begin with, in our case 1000. The value start_chromosome_size is the mean number of selected genes for each chromosome of the initial population, which in our case is set to 15. That way each chromosome of the initial population consists of 15 genes on average.Based on this initial population, we breed a new generation using recombination and mutation. Recombination is implemented as follows. Due to the recombination rate of 0.8, in each generation, about 160 new chromosomes are generated by recombination using uniform crossover.38 Two parent chromosomes are selected using roulette wheel selection, i.e. the probability for a chromosome to be selected is proportional to its fitness. Then, the bits at the same position in both parent chromosomes are compared with each other. If they have the same value, this value is chosen for the child chromosome. If the values are different, the bit in the child chromosome is selected randomly.Subsequently to the recombination step, all chromosomes are mutated. On average, we flip 1.5 bits on each chromosome, as follows. Finally, following an elitist approach, the resulting chromosomes as well as the chromosomes of the initial population are sorted in descending order of fitness. Then, the first 200 chromosomes are selected to form the new population. This new population serves as the initial population for the next generation. Gene sets with very good cross-validation accuracies were already found after 15 to 20 generations. Thus, the whole process was repeated for 25 generations to obtain the final population.The best chromosome of the final population contains the potential biomarkers we are looking for. To compare the GA to the other two classification methods, we ran the GA 200 times for each of the three folds. Then, we sorted the genes in decreasing order by frequency of occurrences, generating a ranked list of all genes that is comparable to the lists we obtained with the random forest and the information gain. For those parts of the paper that do not involve training and testing, we ran the GA 500 times, using the whole set of samples.2.7. Top 20 most important genesTo obtain the list of the top 20 most important genes, an importance score for each gene in the 1000-gene data set was computed by each of the three feature selection methods: the information gain, the random forest and the GA (as described in the previous three subsections). The information gain and the random forest both assign a real-number score to each feature, which we used directly. The GA selects a well-performing set of features that differ from run to run. In our experiments, the size of the set selected by the GA was between 3 and 9 and the features selected varied considerably. Hence we measured the importance of a feature by the number of times it was selected over 500 runs of the GA, using 1000 genes and all the samples in the data set. The genes were ranked by their importance according to each method.To compute the overall top 20 most important genes, the ranks for each gene were averaged and the overall top 20 genes were chosen by the average rank. We used ranks instead of numeric importance scores because (Fig. 1) the scores assigned by the information gain are on average much larger than those by the random forest and the GA. As a consequence, using the scores instead of ranks would give the information gain much greater weight in the overall ranking.2.8. Enrichment analysisTo evaluate the biological relevance of our results, we applied gene set enrichment analysis using the hypergeometric distribution.39 We assumed that the genes selected by our feature selection methods are over-represented in gene sets that can be directly associated with the pluripotent status of cells. For this reason, we compared our selected genes with several pluripotency-related networks and pathways40–46 (http://c-it.mpi-bn.mpg.de/, http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html). As the reference set, we used the set of all genes in the Affymetrix array. The over-representation analysis (ORA) determines whether a pluripotency-related gene set based on a network or pathway is over- or under-represented in one of the gene sets selected with our feature selection methods, and estimates how likely this is due to our selection method (as opposed to observing the same over- or under-representation by chance).3. Results3.1. Classification without feature selectionOur first objective was to establish how easy it is to classify samples as pluripotent or non-pluripotent with machine learning, and to explore the various machine learning algorithms available for the task. We compared five algorithms chosen to represent different approaches to machine learning: the naive Bayes, the C4.5 decision trees, the random forest (an ensemble of decision trees), the nearest neighbour and the SVM. Two kernels were tried with the SVM: Gaussian and linear. The algorithms were tested on the full set of 20 668 genes as well as on the filtered sets of the 5000 and 1000 most strongly differentially expressed genes. Each sample represented one machine learning instance with gene expression values as features and ‘pluripotent’ or ‘non-pluripotent’ as class labels. The cross-validated classification results are presented in Table 1 in terms of the accuracy and the AUC. Comparison of machine learning algorithms and data setsThe highest cross-validated accuracy and AUC in each column are shown in bold type. The highest accuracy and AUC in each row are shaded in gray.Comparison of machine learning algorithms and data setsThe highest cross-validated accuracy and AUC in each column are shown in bold type. The highest accuracy and AUC in each row are shaded in gray.The first conclusion we can draw from Table 1 is that machine learning classifies very well, in many cases perfectly. Furthermore, the SVM + linear kernel is the algorithm best suited to this task. The reason the SVM + Gaussian kernel performs worse than the SVM + linear kernel on the larger two data sets is probably that we have a lot of features compared to the number of instances, and the Gaussian kernel effectively increases the number of features.47,48 Using a large number of features is problematic because this approach increases the chance of learning spurious relations (overfitting). Based on these findings, our first choice for testing the classification performance of small feature sets (see the next subsections) was the SVM; both linear and Gaussian kernels were considered because the reduction in the number of features by feature selection may favour the Gaussian kernel.Table 1 shows that for the three best performing machine learning algorithms (the SVM with both kernels and the nearest neighbour), classification with 5000 genes is better than with all 20 668 genes, and classification with 1000 genes is better than with 5000 genes. Therefore, searching for pluripotency biomarkers in the 1000-gene data set is sufficient and in fact preferable, because many irrelevant genes are already eliminated. Reducing the number of genes further was left to the feature selection methods we investigated (see the next subsection), for which we did not wish to exclude any genes prematurely. Based on Table 1, the list of 1000 genes in Supplementary File S3, sorted by feature importance, may be called the set of genes that enable the best distinction between pluripotent and non-pluripotent, answering question b of the Introduction.3.2. Feature selectionFeature selection is a technique used in machine learning to reduce the set of features to the most relevant ones, which often improves classification, and, in our case, also identifies biomarkers with potentially important roles in pluripotency. We used three feature selection methods of increasing complexity. The first method is the ranking of features by information gain. The information gain measures how much information about the class one gains by knowing the value of a feature. It considers each feature on its own. The second method is the ranking by feature importance computed by the random forest machine learning algorithm. The importance is obtained by randomly permuting the values of a feature and measuring the resulting decrease in classification accuracy. While this method still evaluates single features, it measures their importance as a part of a classifier that uses other features as well. The third method is feature selection with the GA. Here, the set of features is optimized by the GA guided by the classification accuracy as the main part of the fitness function, computed using the SVM with Gaussian kernel; the size of the feature set also has a minor influence on the fitness function, since we aimed at small sets of best features. This method evaluates whole sets of features.Figure 1 shows that the three feature selection methods yield considerably different feature-importance distributions. The importance based on the information gain is distributed fairly evenly. The opposite is the case for the importance based on the GA: there are few genes with a high importance and many with a low importance. The random forest is between the two extremes. The most likely explanation for this stems from the well-known redundancy of biomarkers.49 Information gain, which considers each gene on its own, finds many of them predictive of pluripotency. The GA selects only the genes most indispensable for classification many times. From the remaining (redundant) genes, different ones are selected in each run due to the random nature of the algorithm, so none ends up with a high importance.In order to evaluate the performance of the three feature selection methods, we compared cross-validated classification accuracy on the feature sets selected by them. The samples were split in three folds and the first 1000 genes of each fold were selected (see the Methods section), the GA was run 200 times on each of them. For each of the three folds, we sorted the features by their importance (as for Fig. 1) and selected the top 50, 40, 30, 20, 10, 5, 3, 2 and 1 features, and employing these, we computed the classification accuracy using the SVM with the Gaussian and linear kernel, and using the random forest. Then, we calculated the average accuracy over all three folds. The SVM was chosen for its high performance shown in the previous subsection. However, since it was already used as a component of the feature selection with the GA, the feature sets selected by the GA might favour classification with the SVM. We therefore used the random forest for balance. If the features selected by the GA (using the SVM internally) turned out best even for classification with the random forest, we would obtain an unbiased recommendation for using the GA for feature selection. The results are shown in Figs 2–4. Classification accuracy measured by the SVM with Gaussian kernel. Feature selection with information gain, random forest and GA was evaluated using incrementally smaller sets of most important features from the 1000-gene data set.Classification accuracy measured by the SVM with Gaussian kernel.

Likewise, the classification with the random forest does not seem to favour features selected by the random forest. We may thus conclude that the genes selected by these methods are tied to pluripotency in general and not to any particular machine learning algorithm.Figure 3 shows that the classification accuracy of features selected by information gain and random forest is very similar, starting at around 96% with 50 features and dropping to around 92% with a single feature. The situation is similar in Fig. 4, except that the accuracy is overall slightly lower, because the random forest (Fig. 4) does not classify as well as the SVM (Fig. 3). The difference between feature selection with information gain and random forest in Fig. 2 is larger, which indicates that the random forest may be better at identifying good features than the information gain; however, since this does not occur in Figs 3 and 4, no firm conclusion may be drawn. The behaviour of the features selected by the GA is consistently different from those selected by the other two methods. One feature, two features and in one case three features yield a lower classification accuracy than the same numbers of features selected by the other two methods, but once we have more features, those selected by the GA perform better. This is probably due to the GA selecting sets of features that classify well together but not necessarily individually, whereas the other two methods select features that are good individually.Finally, we compared the classification accuracy of features selected by the GA many times over 200 runs in each fold (shown in Fig. 2, for a large number of feature (gene) set sizes) with the accuracy of features selected in single runs. This comparison enables us to investigate the change of accuracy due to aggregation of output (i.e. merging output lists together). The results are shown in Fig. 5. For feature sets of size 7, 6 and 5, features selected most often over 200 runs performed slightly better. For feature sets of size 9 and 8, features selected in single runs were slightly better, but the difference in accuracy was extremely small. This shows that feature sets consisting of features selected most often by the GA offer reasonable performance, while eliminating the variation in features selected in single runs. Only for feature sets of size 4 and 3 did features selected in single runs perform considerably better. This is because the GA selected so few features only when they achieved sufficient classification accuracy by themselves, in exactly this combination; aggregation of output destroys the exact combinations. The features selected most often came from different sets; one could already observe in Figs 2–4 that such features, if they were too few, performed poorly. Classification accuracy measured by the SVM with Gaussian kernel, evaluating features selected many times vs. features selected in single runs by the GA. For feature set size s, the classification accuracy of the features selected by the GA in single runs is averaged over all the final feature sets of size s. The features selected many times are the s features most often selected by the GA (classification accuracy is averaged over the three folds).Classification accuracy measured by the SVM with Gaussian kernel, evaluating features selected many times vs. features selected in single runs by the GA. For feature set size s, the classification accuracy of the features selected by the GA in single runs is averaged over all the final feature sets of size s. The features selected many times are the s features most often selected by the GA (classification accuracy is averaged over the three folds).Table 2 lists the top 20 most important genes selected from the 1000-gene data set by each of the three feature selection methods. It also lists the overall top 20 genes, which are the ones ranked highest by the three individual methods on average. All the samples in the data set were used and the GA was run 500 times. We can see that the lists by the random forest and the information gain are quite similar, whereas the one by the GA is different. The list of the overall top 20 genes does not contain many of the genes considered important by both the random forest and the information gain, because they were ranked too low by the GA. In the Discussion section, we will describe what is known about the listed genes, with reference to pluripotency. Top 20 most important genesThe genes that appear in two of the top 20 lists of the individual feature selection methods are shown in italics. The only gene that appears in all three lists (BB001228, also known as Tet1) is underlined. Complete lists are available as Supplementary File S2.Top 20 most important genesThe genes that appear in two of the top 20 lists of the individual feature selection methods are shown in italics. The only gene that appears in all three lists (BB001228, also known as Tet1) is underlined. Complete lists are available as Supplementary File S2.3.3. Enrichment analysisThe enrichment analysis was done (as described in the Methods section) for the most important genes identified by feature selection with the GA, information gain and random forest. In the absence of a pre-defined number of most important genes to select, we started with the top 40 genes and increased the number in steps of 20 up to 200 genes. This resulted in 27 gene sets, 9 for each of the three feature selection methods.A significant enrichment (P-value < 0.05) of pluripotency-related genes published by Som et al.,40 MacArthur et al.41 and Muller et al.42 can be found for nearly all 27 tested sets, as shown in Table 3. For the sets selected by information gain and random forest, we could also observe a consistent significant enrichment of the genes from two other published pluripotency gene lists (PluriUp and PluriPlus43; for calculating enrichments with respect to human genes, we took their mouse orthologs). The analysis was also done with a set of genes which are enriched or depleted in embryonic tissue (abbreviated ‘Tissue+’ and ‘Tissue–' in the table, obtained from http://c-it.mpi-bn.mpg.de/). For the genes known to be enriched in embryonic tissue, the lists selected by information gain and random forest show a significant enrichment, whereas no significant enrichment can be found in any of the sets chosen by the GA. For the genes which are depleted in embryonic tissues, there is no enrichment in any of the tested sets.

See text for abbreviations. Exact counts and p-values can be found in Supplementary File S4.Enrichment could also be observed in different pluripotency-related pathways.44–46,50 Here, the gene sets selected by the GA show an enrichment in more pluripotency-related pathways than the gene sets selected by the other two methods (Table 4). The larger variety of pathway annotations for the genes selected by the GA reaffirms that this feature selection method selects a broader variety of biomarkers related to different aspects of pluripotency. Enrichment of genes in pluripotency pathways (Table 3)Enrichment of genes in pluripotency pathways (Table 3)4. DiscussionWe have shown that on the basis of gene expression data, the distinction between the pluripotent and the differentiated (non-pluripotent stem) cell state can be learned with cross-validated accuracies reaching 100%. We provided evidence that the features (genes) selected by the combination of the GA and the SVM are small sets of features that classify well and that work best in combination (Figs 2–5). We listed these genes as potential biomarkers in Table 2 together with the features (biomarkers) selected by two other methods (information gain and random forest). Analysing each of the top 10 pluripotency biomarkers in the columns of Table 2, we now wish to answer the following questions: What can we find out about the selected genes by literature investigations?Why are the genes generally known to be involved in pluripotency under-represented among the selected genes?How much reliability can be assigned to the selection of genes? What kind of relevance do the selected genes have for pluripotency?4.1. Literature investigation of the most important pluripotency biomarkersThe sets of pluripotency markers returned by the GA include the Fam134b gene in 35% of the selected gene sets (174 times out of 500), making it the most important feature by a large margin (the Pam gene is the runner-up selected in 21% of the feature sets—106 times out of 500). In human, mutations of FAM134B cause severe neuropathy, leading to a recent effort to characterize the mouse ortholog.51Fam134b expression was found predominantly in ganglia. The protein co-localized with the cis-Golgi marker giantin, and (partially) with the trans-Golgi marker TGN38; relocation after brefeldin A treatment followed a pattern typical for Golgi-resident proteins. shRNA knockdown to levels of 19–27% reduced the size of the cis-Golgi compartment and impaired cell proliferation in N2a cells. Interestingly, isoform 2 of Fam134b is found in testis, but not in neural tissue. In the neural context, Golgi-mediated processing and/or transport of neurotrophin precursors and their receptors may be impaired by a lack of Fam134b. In the ES cell context, Golgi-mediated processing and/or transport of two cell surface markers of unknown function in pluripotency, SSEA1 (stage-specific embryonic antigen 1) and AP (alkaline phosphatase) may be impaired; both SSEA1 and AP52 are localized in the Golgi, to be transported to the cell surface. The observed role of Fam134b in cell proliferation in the mouse is reflected in human; FAM134b is implicated in oesophageal carcinoma, and it promotes cell proliferation.53 It is also overexpressed in benign tumours (adenomas), but underexpressed in adenocarcinoma.54In 52 cases, the Fam134b gene was selected together with the F2rl1 gene (a.k.a. PAR-2, see below), which is ranked fourth by the GA. By the design of the genetic-algorithm-based feature selection, the most likely ‘connection’ between both genes is that they cover complementary aspects of pluripotency, F2rl1 being concerned with the distinction of pluripotency and multipotency,55 acting as a G protein-coupled receptor with a putative role in the mouse blastocyst.56The Pam (peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase, a.k.a. Phm) gene is the second-most important feature selected by the GA. The only evidence we could find for its role in pluripotency is provided by Lyczak et al.,57 who investigated a putative remote(!) homolog in C. elegans and concluded ‘Our analysis of PAM-1 requirements shows that a puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase is also required for proteolytic regulation of the oocyte to embryo transition’. Dub1 (deubiquinating enzyme 1) is ranked third; the gene is also a novel candidate involved in pluripotency. (De-)ubiquination of histones has recently been shown to have an important role in repressing developmental control genes in ES cells, however.58 As described, the F2rl1 (PAR-2) gene is ranked fourth, and was implicated in the distinction between multipotency and pluripotency.Positions 5–10 are assigned to genes already implicated in pluripotency. Gldc is discussed by Boue et al.59 and Spp1 (a.k.a Osteopontin) is regulated by Pou5f1/Sox2.60Dazl functions in the maintenance of pluripotency of mouse primordial germ cells,61 and as a translational regulator during ES cell differention.62Ccnd2 is repressed by Tcf3 in embryonic stem cells.63100043292 (a.k.a. GM4340) is found only in embryonic tissue in cleavage state (Supplementary File S5) and Otx2 is part of the gene regulatory network in mouse ES cells, working with Oct4 (Pou5f1), possibly to maintain gene expression in early progenitors of ectodermal lineages.64 All the named genes just mentioned are listed by Boue et al.59 in the human or mouse networks of their Figures 2 and 3; none of them is a well-known pluripotency gene, however.Genes selected as features by the random forest are more well-known. The top 10 are 3 Dppa (development- and pluripotency-associated) genes, 5 other well-known genes, namely Gdf3,65,66Mybl2 (a.k.a. B-Myb),67Rex2,55Zfp42 (a.k.a. Rex1)68 and Tet1 (listed by Affymetrix as BB001228, see below) and two unnamed genes (Ottmusg00000010173 and 2610305d13rik).Information gain highlights the largest set of well-known genes, with Esrrb among the top 10, and 6 of the 10 random forest genes just mentioned. Curiously, however, we find Ottmusg00000010173 (a.k.a. Gm13051) on the top of the list, so we investigated it further. The gene is transcribed predominantly in embryonic tissue in the blastocyst and organogenesis stage (Supplementary File S6). Moreover, NextBio.com lists the study ‘Pluripotent stem cells gene expression at different stages of development in Sox2-deficient embryos’ (GSE15358) as the first study for this gene, reporting its downregulation in epiblast-derived pluripotent stem cells vs. ES cells.Combining the three lists of features selected by the GA, the random forest and the information gain should highlight those genes which work best as discriminative markers, no matter whether they are used as features in isolation or together with others. The combined list should thus be superior in its general utility and its resistance to outliers, just as combined lists in homology search are.69 Three observations are noteworthy. First, the mouse gene BB001228 representing the Tet oncogene 1 (Tet1) according to the Affymetrix array annotation scores best. Tet1 is deemed responsible for the generation of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC)70 in mouse ES cells under physiological conditions,71 and during ES cell differentiation, the amount of Tet1 and 5hmC decreases. Also, Tet1 maintains Nanog expression and its knockdown impairs the self-renewal and maintenance of mouse ES cells72 by participating in the upregulation of pluripotency factors73,74 and the downregulation of developmental regulators.73 Secondly, the E130012a19rik gene is ranked third; it was most recently discussed as a Klf5 target with strongest effect (see Figure 2 in Parisi et al.75). Finally, Calcoco2 (a.k.a. NDP52l1) and Cnpy1 are now among the top 10; the former has been implicated in pluripotency before,76–79 and the latter has been reported to be a target of Smad2/3 signalling in mouse ES cells, noting its expression in the embryo (2-cell-stage,80 their Table S7), and it is a regulator of FGF signalling in zebrafish, albeit in a neural context.814.2. Underrepresentation of canonical pluripotency genesWe found some generally known genes such as Esrrb, Gdf3, Mybl2, Zfp42, some Dppa (development- and pluripotency-associated) genes and, as the cumulative top scorer, BB001228 (Tet1). This list does not include many generally known genes such as Pou5f1 (a.k.a. Oct4), Sox2, Nanog etc., but not finding these by machine learning is a common phenomenon, as discussed in the subsection on Related Work at the end of the Discussion. The genes Pou5f1, Sox2, Nanog, Lin28 and Klf4 were found at positions 196, 414, 203, 594 and 83 of our list, respectively; the two genes Tcf3 and cMyc are not part of the 1000 gene data set, because the fold changes of these genes are too small.Our hypothesis is that the latter genes are general indicators of pluripotency (in particular, they are strongly upregulated in pluripotent samples, see Table 5), and with certainty they are involved in its mechanistic basis, but they do not provide crisp classification power because (a) they are involved in other processes such as neural stemness (Sox282) and germline maintenance (Oct4 (Pou5f1)83) and/or their activity is shut down gradually, and (b) they are redundant in particular in the GA setting: this method may select any one of them for ‘getting the idea’, in combination with more powerful discriminating genes that reflect pluripotency in a complex, context-dependent and non-linear way. With respect to (a), we indeed observed that Sox2 and Oct4 (Pou5f1) are still found in some negative samples, such as GSM272848 or GSM275556. This is not surprising, since, as described, we included pluripotent stages up to embryonal day 3.5 as well as iPS cells as actual positives, and embryonic body stages from day 5 onwards as well as non-pluripotent germline stem cells as actual negatives. With respect to (b), we observe at least one gene of the pluripotency-related network by Som et al.40 in 54% of the feature sets selected by the GA. Also, at least one gene of networks published by MacArthur et al. 41 and Muller et al.42 can be found in 33% and 27% of the selected feature sets, respectively. We hypothesize that each feature set includes at least one ‘general indicator’ of pluripotency; some of them are documented in a pluripotency-related network, but some are not known yet. Gene expression values of pluripotency genesThe table shows the mean expression values for the pluripotent samples and the non-pluripotent samples as well as the resulting fold changes for three generally known pluripotency genes. For comparison, the first three genes found by the GA are also listed.Gene expression values of pluripotency genesThe table shows the mean expression values for the pluripotent samples and the non-pluripotent samples as well as the resulting fold changes for three generally known pluripotency genes. For comparison, the first three genes found by the GA are also listed.The underrepresentation of canonical pluripotency genes is also reflected by the lower levels of enrichment of relevant genes in the feature sets based on the GA (when compared with information gain and random forest, see Table 3). In turn, the larger variety of relevant pathways enriched in feature sets based on the GA (Table 4) may indicate an overrepresentation of non-canonical pluripotency genes that are (at least peripherically) associated with diverse aspects of pluripotency.4.3. Reliability and relevance of the most important pluripotency biomarkers found by the GAThe GA is a stochastic search, so we repeated it for a second time with the same data set yielding very similar results, as shown in Table 6, confirming the reliability of our list. The evidence for relevance is given in several ways: (a) the literature investigation at the start of this section revealed that most genes we found are related to pluripotency, even though most of them are not well-known pluripotency genes. (b) Our enrichment analyses show that many genes that are selected as features are implicated in pluripotency, being included in networks describing pluripotency, and being overexpressed in embryonic tissue (Table 3). (c) The enrichment analyses of Table 4, together with the observations of Figs 2–4, imply that the genes selected by the GA cover a wide spectrum of many aspects of pluripotency, and they are most informative about pluripotency in combination. Similarity of the results of the reference run and the confirmation run of the GAThe table shows the similarity of the top 20 genes from the confirmation (second) run of the GA, compared to the reference (first) run. The colour code for the first, second, third and fourth quartile of the genes of the reference run is carried over to the confirmation run; the two genes coloured white are found up to position 30 in the reference run.Similarity of the results of the reference run and the confirmation run of the GAThe table shows the similarity of the top 20 genes from the confirmation (second) run of the GA, compared to the reference (first) run.

Related workBioinformatics approaches have a long history in pluripotency/stem cell research. The method of ‘Digital differential display’ (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/UniGene/help.cgi?item=ddd) may be called a success story, allowing the discovery of the Nanog gene,84 which was later recognized to form, together with Oct4 (Pou5f1) and Sox2, the so-called ‘core circuit’ behind pluripotency in both the human and mouse. Basically, Nanog emerged by contrasting transcriptomes from mouse ES cells with those from various other sources, identifying differentially expressed genes and experimentally checking for enhancements in self-renewal triggered by these. Moreover, the discovery of the ‘Yamanaka factors’, transcription factors which can reprogram a fibroblast into an ‘induced pluripotent’ stem cell state (iPS),85 was based on testing 24 ES cell marker genes known from several sources, partially discovered by gene expression analyses. There are many approaches86,87 using gene expression (but also proteomics88,89) data to derive lists of genes involved in pluripotency. In some publications, the intersection of these lists is studied, and it is long known that such intersections feature only a small number of common genes90,91; this problem of ‘small overlap’, ‘missing consensus signature' or ‘missing reproducability’ is not confined to investigations into pluripotency, but it is also found in attempts to define cancer biomarkers.92,93 Moreover, gene lists associated with pluripotency often do not feature the obvious suspects such as the ‘core circuit’ of Oct4 (Pou5f1), Sox2 and Nanog, the other ‘Yamanaka factors’ Klf4 and cMyc,85 or other genes commonly associated with pluripotency in the literature,40 such as Stat3 or Esrrb; see references87,94 for examples of gene lists including mostly ‘unexpected markers’. Other analyses based on large data sets feature commonly associated genes, but they also include a large proportion of ‘unexpected markers’.59,95,96 Literature curation, expression data analysis and machine learning were applied to derive and enhance networks of genes/proteins involved in pluripotency in the mouse41 and in human,42,43 yielding even more novel candidates for marker genes.In contrast to previous work, we investigated and compared two complementary learning approaches: (i) comprehensive learning of pluripotency, employing many features (genes) and striving for maximum accuracy, and (ii) ‘minimal-best’ learning of pluripotency, seeking small sets of best features, akin to ‘biomarker signatures’.11,86 From a bioinformatics perspective, it is known that small sets of features may even improve classification by reducing noise and overfitting, which is often related to the use of megavariate approaches.97 For classification, we used a naive Bayes approach, decision trees, random forest, nearest neighbour and SVM. To select features, we employed information gain, random forest and a wrapper consisting of the GA and the SVM. Wrappers are feature selection methods that search the space of feature subsets and evaluate each subset by testing how well a machine learning algorithm can classify the data using that subset.Feature selection methods known from machine learning are a standard approach to identifying biomarkers from gene expression data. Wrappers employing the GA to search the space of feature subsets are known to be well suited for biomarker identification, although they were mostly tested on cancer data in the past. Examples include the work of Lin et al.,98 Küçükural et al.,99 Gan et al.,100 Zhang et al.101 and Cannas et al.102 Each group of researchers proposed some enhancement to the basic wrapper approach. Lin et al.98 made the final selection of genes based on the number of times they were selected during multiple runs of the GA, which we adopted. Küçükural et al.99 ‘restarted’ the GA after every 10 generations to improve the classification accuracy on training data, which was used as a part of the fitness function. We could already achieve perfect classification on training data without such restarts. Gan et al.100 filtered the initial set of features to make the job of the GA easier. They utilized all their data for filtering instead of using cross-validation. We also filtered our data, but we used an appropriate cross-validation in all steps of our work. Zhang et al.101 used multiple classifiers to evaluate the feature subsets selected by the GA. Cannas et al.102 also employed filtering and used a combination of classification accuracy and size to evaluate feature subsets; we used feature-subset size in a similar fashion.5. ConclusionsWe demonstrated that the wrapper approach to feature selection using the GA and SVM, which was previously used to identify cancer biomarkers, works well for pluripotency data. It yields high cross-validated classification accuracy even if the accuracy is not measured by the SVM, but by another method such as the random forest. The biomarkers it identifies are enriched in pluripotency-related genes and pathways, and while many of them are ‘unexpected markers’, a literature review can connect most of them to pluripotency. Ultimately, experimental validation of the new markers is required, and we encourage other researchers to scrutinize our approach and, possibly, to investigate the genes we found in an experimental setting.Authors' contributionsL.S. developed the feature selection based on the GA, performed the enrichment analyses and wrote parts of the manuscript.

IntroductionCarnivorous plants fascinate both scientists1 and the general public (Audrey Jr. in: Corman, 1960). One carnivorous plant genus is Sarracenia (pitcher plants) which typically grow in highly acidic, nutrient poor soils that are water saturated for at least part of the year, such as bogs, grassy savannas, fens, and similar wetlands. They obtain a portion of their nutrients from prey captured in their pitchers—highly modified tubular leaves. Sarracenia species may digest their prey directly with secreted proteases, phosphatases, and nucleases.2,3 However, one of our focal species, Sarracenia purpurea, hosts a complex food web of bacteria, protozoa, and arthropods that mineralize the prey and release nutrients that are taken up by the plant.4 The other focal species, Sarracenia psittacina, does not host such a food web. Despite the interspecific variability in pitcher form, the flowers of the different species are morphologically quite similar, and they are pollinated by a range of generalist bees and sarcophagid flies;5,6 interspecific hybrids with intermediate morphologies are common in nature and are fertile. A number of the taxa within the genus are considered endangered. As a genus, Sarracenia provides a wealth of opportunities for ecological and evolutionary studies.Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of the transcriptome (cDNA) of two Sarracenia species (S. psittacina and S. purpurea) obtained by 454 sequencing technology (454 GS FLX). Transcriptome sequencing represents the subset of genes from the genome that are functionally active in a selected tissue and species of interest. In non-model organisms lacking genomic resources, such as sequenced genome, transcriptome study is an effective way to study the gene expression and address comparative genomic-level questions.7,8 Moreover, massive parallelized sequencing technologies have made transcriptome studies, one of the most cost-effective methods for gene discovery,7 even more robust and efficient. 454 sequencing was selected as its sufficiently long-sequence reads can help compensate for the lack of a reference genome during de novo sequence assembly.9As this is the first set of sequence data for any pitcher plants, we addressed a number of questions in this study ranging from: identifying the events of genome duplication, determining the level of orthology between two species, estimating the substitution rates between the orthologous contigs, and investigating the contigs which show signatures of diversifying natural selection (a non-neutral rate of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions between sequence pairs). These comparative genomics methods along with genetic mapping, expression profiling, and candidate gene approaches are part of investigating the genetic basis of phenotypic variation.10 We also performed a functional annotation, through gene ontology analysis, of all contigs in order to detect any pattern (biological process, molecular function, and cellular component) which may be unique or predominant to pitcher plants.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materialTwo species of Sarracenia were chosen based on morphology and differences in insect trapping/digestion. Sarracenia purpurea has the widest natural range among all species within the genus. It is found from Mississippi eastward up the entire US east coast. It is also found in all the Great Lake states and throughout the majority of Canada. Natural populations of S. psittacina can be found in all Gulf coast states except Texas and it also has populations in Georgia. Fresh juvenile leaf samples were taken from greenhouse maintained plant stocks. Samples came from identical or very similar cultivars generated from rhizome propagation.2.2. RNA extractionAfter multiple extraction attempts using various kits and other wet lab techniques, a successful protocol was found using the Spectrum Plant Total RNA Kit (Sigma #STRN50-1KT). Only the youngest unopened leaves were used as older tissues yield negligible RNA amounts. Certain steps call for the use of RNase-free water; this was created by adding 0.1 ml of diethylpyrocarbonate to 100 ml of water, incubating at 37°C for 12 h and then autoclaving for 15 min to remove trace amounts of the chemical. All instruments and surfaces were cleaned thoroughly, treated with an RNase deactivating solution (100 mM sodium hydroxide plus 0.1% sodium lauryl sulphate) and wiped dry. The mortar and pestles were frozen with liquid nitrogen for about 20 s prior to the start of tissue and maintained at a subzero temperature throughout tissue grinding to prevent RNA degradation. A single total RNA prep of 100 mg of young leaf tissue yielded on average 4–8 µg of high-quality RNA. The extraction was repeated 40–50 times. We obtained ~0.25 mg of total RNA for each species.2.3. mRNA isolation and cDNA generationThe Oligotec mRNA Kit (Qiagen # 70022) was used to purify mRNA from 0.25 mg extracted total RNA, according to the manufacturer's recommendation. During the elution steps, 25 µl of OEB buffer was used in the initial step and 25 µl in the follow-up step for the maximum mRNA concentration in the smallest volume possible. mRNA quality was checked with a Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Inc.) and a NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo Scientific). For cDNA generation, the Evrogen cDNA synthesis kit (SK001) was used with a modification to the kit's 3' primer. We used ~26 ng of mRNA for each species.Normalization of the cDNA was performed using Evrogen Normalization Trimmer Kit (NK001) in order to minimize the repetition of transcripts. This normalization protocol is based on denaturing-reassociation of cDNA, followed by digestion with a duplex-specific nuclease. The single-stranded cDNA fraction was amplified twice by sequential PCR reactions according to the manufacturer's protocol. A Qiagen MiniElut kit (#28006) was used to purify the normalized cDNA and sterile water was used in the final elution in order to prevent the likely interference of TE with 454 processing. Normalized cDNA in 100 µl sterile water was submitted to the Georgia Genomic Facility (www.dna.uga.edu) for 454 sequencing in a Genome Sequencer TM (GS) Titanium FLX instrument (Roche Diagnostics) employing a standard protocol. Sarracenia psittacina and Sarracenia purpurea cDNAs were submitted at a concentration of 49 and 45 ng/µl, respectively.2.4. Sequence assembly, contig annotation, and ortholog/paralog identificationWe called the bases from the sequence data using pyrobayes11 from the 454 sequencer generated sff files. Vector and other contaminants were removed using seqclean (http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu); assembly of the cleaned reads was performed by MIRA.12Blast2Go (B2G)13 was used at the default criterion to functionally annotated the contigs. In order to localize the contigs, we obtained Vitis genomic sequences (since this genome had the top hits in blastx searches) and gff files from the phytozome project (http://www.phytozome.net/) and then mapped both the assemblies against the Vitis genome using blat (step size = 11, minScore = 40).14 Orthologous sequences between the two Sarracenia species were predicted using the reciprocal blast (blastn)15 hit method at e-value 1e- 20. This stringent e-value cut-off leads to a higher identification of orthologous as opposed to paralogous sequences. Paralogous sequences were identified by doing all vs all blast (blastn) within the species. Sequences producing a significant alignment over 300 bp and 40% identity were defined as paralogs.162.5. Detection of genome duplication and speciation eventsThe approach used in the detection of genome duplication and speciation event was adapted from Blanc and Wolfe.16 Identified paralogous pairs were organized into gene families using single-linkage clustering. Afterwards, synonymous substitution rates (Ks) were estimated for all possible pairs within a gene family. One potential drawback of measuring the substitution rates from transcriptome data is that multiple entries of the same gene can be present which leads to redundant Ks measures. To minimize this false peak in the Ks distribution plot, we discarded one of the sequence from paralogous pairs with Ks = 0 (assuming that no synonymous substitutions between sequences means they belong to the same gene) and all other Ks values involving that particular sequence. We corrected for multiple Ks comparisons from gene families which contain non-overlapping incomplete sequences by a simple clustering method, as described in Blanc and Wolfe.162.6. Estimation of substitution ratesTo estimate the synonymous (Ks) and non-synonymous substitutions (Ka) rates between paralogous and orthologous sequences pairs, we first aligned the sequence pairs using tblastx;15 sequences producing significant alignments were extracted using their aligned coordinates and further analysed by translation and then amino acid sequence alignment was performed by Clustalw.17 Only the longest uninterrupted reading frame was used for the analysis. Corresponding codon alignments were produced using PAL2NAL18 and finally rates were estimated using a maximum likelihood method implemented in the CODEML program of the PAML package Version 4.1.19 Pair-wise maximum likelihood analyses were performed in runmode-2. In order to minimize the statistical artefacts which could arise due to short alignments and a saturation of Ks, we further discarded those alignments which are less than 30aa in length and which had Ks >2. The Ks frequency in each interval size of 0.01 within the range [0, 2.0] was plotted.3. Results3.1. Sequencing and assemblyThe amount of raw sequences obtained was 123 and 88 Mb with a mean raw read length was 249 and 258 bp for S. psittacina and S. purpurea, respectively. Raw sequences were cleaned and assembled into contigs. Since the Sarracenia genome sequence was not available, a de novo assembly of the cDNA sequences was performed. We obtained 46 275 and 36 681 contigs with an N50 value of 479 and 485 for S. psittacina and S. purpurea, respectively. The number of assembled contigs and the mean average coverage per contig were found to be correlated with the number of cleaned reads. The complete assembly statistics are shown in Table 1 and assemblies are available under Supplementary data S1.

Functional annotation of contigsWe used B2G to functionally annotate the contigs. The B2G annotation has three steps which involve using blast against the public or private databases, mapping against GO resources, and annotating to generate reliable functional assignments. From our data, 20 920 (45.2%) of the S. psittacina and 17 821 (48.6%) of S. purpurea cDNA sequences were shown to have significant matches to currently known proteins in the NCBI non-redundant protein database. The B2G blast hit bar plot (Fig. 1) shows Vitis, Ricinus, and Populus as the top three species with greatest number of hits for both species. Contigs with the significant blast matches were functionally annotated. We found GO resource assignments for 19.92% and 21.19% of contigs for S. psittacina and S. purpurea, respectively. A summary of B2G mapping is given in Table 2.

The two most abundant categories were: (i) ‘cellular and metabolic processes’, to which 75% of both species’ contigs were associated (S. psittacina: 7543 sequences and S. purpurea: 6285 sequences) and (ii) ‘biological regulation’, to which 8% of contigs were dedicated (S. psittacina: 802 sequences and S. purpurea: 684 sequences) (Fig. 2A).

Most of the contigs in the molecular function division were dedicated to binding functions and catalytic activity (82% of both species; S. psittacina: 7367 sequences and S. purpurea: 6170 sequences) (Fig. 2B).The last GO division is ‘cellular component’, which refers to sub-cellular location where gene product is active.20 In this, eight major categories were identified and again a similar type of coverage was found for both species. Gene products were mainly expressed intracellularly (52% for both species; S. psittacina: 3033 sequences; S. purpurea: 2562 sequences) or in the membrane-bound/non-membrane-bound organelle (29% for both species; S. psittacina: 1730 sequences; S. purpurea: 1386) (Fig. 2C). The complete B2G results are shown in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2.3.3. Localization of the contigs with respect to genic featuresWe used the Vitis genome as a reference in order to locate the contigs with respect to genomic sequence. Vitis was the species whose sequences were found as the top hit for sequences from both Sarracenia species in the blast (blastx) search. Blat was used to map the assemblies against the Vitis genome. Sequences uniquely mapped to a particular feature (5'UTR, 3'UTR, CDS, 1 kb up, 1 kb down, and intergenic) were plotted as a bar plot (Fig. 3). A total of 8501 and 7224 contigs were uniquely mapped to features under consideration for S. psittacina and S. purpurea, respectively. Based on the Vitis genome annotation, nearly 60% of the mapped contigs were found to be in CDS regions and 33% of the contigs were associated with the putative intergenic region (shown as NA in the figure). Only a very tiny fraction of the contigs were mapped to 5'UTR/3'UTR and regions 1 kb upstream/1 kb downstream of them. A bar plot displaying the proportion of contigs mapped to a particular region of Vitis genome in two species.A bar plot displaying the proportion of contigs mapped to a particular region of Vitis genome in two species.3.4. Orthologous and paralogous contigsWe identified 16 163 pairs of orthologous contigs by the reciprocal best blast hit approach; this approach has been found superior to more sophisticated orthology detection algorithms.21 We used a stringent e-value cutoff (1e -20) in order to separate the paralogous sequences from the orthologous sequences. A total of 8706 orthologous contigs matched to open reading frames of known or putative proteins. The Venn diagram indicating the orthologous and unique contigs is shown in Fig. 4. We also identified 18 296 and 9565 paralogs pairs by all vs all blast (blastn); these were organized into 2555 and 1708 gene families by a single linkage clustering method for S. psittacina and S. purpurea, respectively.

Estimation of Kaand KsWe calculated the Ka and Ks values for 10 715 orthologous contigs and their ratio for 4810 contigs (a Ks = 0 made the ratio incalculable for some of the contigs). Similarly, we estimated the Ks value for each of the paralogous pairs. We further studied substitution rates and GO categorization within the orthologous contigs only. Out of these 4810 contigs, we were able to find the functional annotation for 3444 contigs. We identified 491 contigs which are under diversifying selection Ka/Ks = 1 (Fig. 5). Most of these contigs were found to be involved in the molecular function related to nucleotide binding. The complete Ka/Ks result for 3444 contigs is shown in Supplementary Table S3.

Genome duplication and speciationFrom the estimation of synonymous substitution rates, we were able to find signatures of genome duplication within both S. psittacina and S. purpurea. The Ks value distribution for both species is shown in Fig. 6A. The secondary peak in the paralogous Ks distribution plot indicates a genome duplication event.16 The estimated Ks value between orthologous pairs was also plotted along with paralogous (Fig. 6B). The secondary peak in the orthologous Ks value distribution indicates the speciation events. The number of sequences involved in the genome duplication events and gene family statistics are shown in Table 3. Considering a clock-like rates of synonymous substitution of 1.5 × 10-8 substitutions/synonymous site/year for dicots,22 we estimated the age of these events and found that they are fairly recent [~2 million years (myr) for both duplication and speciation]. The purpose of these estimates is just to give an idea of the time scale involved because they are certainly highly approximate.

DiscussionWe generated the 46 275 and 36 681 contigs by pyrosequencing for S. psittacina and S. purpurea, respectively, using young pitchers as the starting material. We normalized our cDNA library in order to maximize coverage of transcripts and prevent biases due to highly expressed transcripts. Based upon the sequence similarity searches, we found Vitis to have the greatest number of hits to contigs from both species. This is an interesting result since Sarracenia is currently considered to belong to the order Ericales which is a part of clade asterids, whereas Vitis belongs to clade rosids (http://www.mobot.org/mobot/research/apweb/). The expectation might have been that an extensively sequenced asterid such as Lycopersicon would have had the greatest number of blast hits, rather than a rosid. To test the statistical significance of this result, we divided the species with the top 20 number of blast (blastx) hits into two parts based upon their phylogenetic position in asterids and rosids and performed a t-test of significance (two-sample t-test for unequal variances, one-tail t-statistics t(6) = 1.943180274, P~0.05 for the S. psittacina sequences, with a similar result for the S. purpurea sequences). The t-test shows that the observed difference is significant. Relationships among familial clades in the order Ericales have been considered as problematic23 and Ericales was placed in the clade dilleniidae in the previous classifications.24 Our results are thus consistent with the original placement of the Ericales, as being closer to rosids than asterids.Since a genomic sequence is not available for any pitcher plants, we used the Vitis genome as a reference for contig localization. About 60% of contigs aligned uniquely to the protein coding regions of Vitis genome in both species. The nearly equal coverage in 5'UTR and 3'UTR regions showed the success of the protocol in full-length cDNA construction. We also found a number of contigs belong to intergenic regions based upon the Vitis genome annotation. As the Vitis genome annotation is still not finished and many more genes have yet to be identified, it is possible that contigs currently localized in intergenic regions might be as-yet unidentified protein-coding genes, or they might be non-coding RNA genes or alternatively spliced exons. To test this, we took the contigs belonging to intergenic regions and checked whether they had similarity to any known or hypothetical protein. Out of 1773 putative intergenic sequences of S. psittacina, 1280 sequences had shown similarity (=1e -5) to known/hypothetical proteins. We also obtained ncRNA sequences for Arabidopsis and Oryza from ncRNA database25 and mapped our intergenic sequences against them. Only few sequences had showed similarity to known ncRNA. Similar patterns were obtained from S. purpurea. The detailed mapping results are shown in Supplementary Table S4.The paired pattern in functional annotation for all three GO divisions reflects that our library and 454 sequencing covered the transcriptome of the two species equally well. We can speculate about the significance of the GO annotations relative to the pitcher plant insectivorous adaptations. In the biological process and molecular function division, an abundance of genes were found to be related with metabolic process and catalytic activity and inside the metabolic process and catalytic activity, a number of genes were found related to macromolecule metabolic process and hydrolase activity (Supplementary Figs S1A, B and S2A, B). The hydrolytic enzymes (protease, RNase, nuclease, phosphatase) may be required for the digestion of prey.26 The pitchers of pitcher plants may contain water with microorganisms; a high level of hydrolytic enzymes in the pitcher plant transcriptome may favour the hypothesis that pitcher plants do not rely solely on microorganisms to digest their insect prey.27 More detailed information about Sarracenia, its prey-digestion system and its microbial food web, can be found in a review by Ellison et al.28Previously, we estimated the genome sizes (25% more nuclear DNA than maize) of these two species29 and based on that, we expected that the species might be polyploid. To test our hypothesis, we estimated the substitution rate for all the paralogous contigs showing a significant sequence similarity at protein level and plotted the Ks value distribution histogram. We were able to detect a moderate signature of a duplication event within this data set. Time estimates suggest that these events were fairly recent. The lack of clear secondary peaks can be attributed to the fact that signal of this event, provided it is relatively recent, is not dissociable from the initial peak. The orthologous contig comparison secondary peak is in the same time frame as the ortholog/paralog duplication peak. Possibly speciation within the genus Sarracenia might have occurred after the duplication event, which is a well-recognized pattern of plant evolution.30A substitution rate within the orthologous contigs (identified by reciprocal blast) found 491 contigs having the Ka/Ks ratio =1. This ratio is considered to be a good measure of selective pressure acting at the sequence level31,32 and has been used in different studies to identify the contigs under positive/adaptive evolution (Ka/Ks > 1) or under negative/purifying selection (Ka/Ks < 1).33 The majority of contigs under diversifying selection were found to be related to binding activity in the molecular function category of GO assignment (Supplementary Table S3).In summary, our analysis showed a high degree of similarity in sequence existed between the pitcher plants, with Vitis as the model species outside the genus with the greatest sequence similarity. Functional annotation of all the contigs showed the major categories of genes that exist, and the substitution rate estimation identified the signatures of genome duplication and rapidly evolving genes in the pitcher plants. We believe that these sequences and analysis will greatly aid the research community working on insectivorous plants and their ecology.4.1.

IntroductionCultivated soybean (Glycine max L.), which provides an abundant source of oil and protein-rich food for human consumption and animal feed, is one of the major and most important legume crops native to East Asia. Soybean growth, productivity and seed quality are adversely affected by a wide range of environmental stresses.1,2 Among the adverse environmental factors, drought is considered the most devastating abiotic stress. Drought stress affects all stages of plant growth and development, resulting in significant yield loss by ~40%; as well as severely impacting seed quality.2 In response to drought stress, plants activate a number of defence mechanisms that function to increase tolerance to water deficit.3,4 The early events of the adaptation of plants to drought stress includes the perception of stress signals and subsequent signal transduction, leading to the activation of various physiological and metabolic responses.3,5,6 Within the signal transduction networks that are involved in the conversion of stress signal perception to stress-responsive gene expression, various transcription factors (TFs) and cis-acting elements contained in stress-responsive promoters function not only as molecular switches for gene expression, but also as terminal points of signal transduction in the signalling processes. The identification and molecular tailoring of novel TFs have the potential to overcome a number of important limitations involved in the generation of transgenic crop plants with superior yield under stress conditions.Within higher plants, ~7%; of their genomes encodes for putative TFs.7 Typically, the TFs contain a distinct type of DNA-binding domain and transcriptional regulation region (TRR) and are capable of activating or repressing the transcription of multiple target genes.3,5,8,9 The NAC TFs contain a highly conserved N-terminal DNA-binding NAC domain and a variable C-terminal TRR.10 Research in Arabidopsis has indicated that there are at least five different target DNA-binding sites for the NAC TFs. These include the drought-responsive NAC recognition sequence (NACRS) containing the CACG core motif; the iron deficiency-responsive IDE2 motif containing the core sequence CA(A/C)G(T/C)(T/C/A)(T/C/A); the CBNACBS-binding site of the Arabidopsis calmodulin-binding CBNAC protein having the GCTT as core-binding motif; the secondary wall NAC-binding element (SNBE) with 19-bp consensus sequence (T/A)NN(C/T) (T/C/G)TNNNNNNNA(A/C)GN(A/C/T) (A/T); and the 21-bp segment of the 35S promoter (-83 to -63) containing two core sequences CGTA and CGTC.11–17 In addition to DNA binding, the NAC domain also possesses the capacity for mediating protein:protein interactions.13,18 The highly variable C-terminal TRRs of NAC TFs can act as either a transcriptional activator or a repressor.11,14,19 Interestingly, the C-terminal domains of numerous NAC TFs also exhibit protein-binding activity.14 On the other hand, the C-terminal regions of some NAC TFs also contain transmembrane motifs (TMs) which are responsible for the anchoring to the plasma membrane. These NAC TFs are classified as membrane-associated and are designated as NTL (NTM1-Like or ‘NAC with Transmembrane Motif 1’-Like) TFs.20,21NAC TFs have been shown to regulate a number of biological processes, including those which protect plants under water stress conditions.10,22,23 There are at least 105 ANAC and 140 ONAC members in Arabidopsis and rice (Oryza sativa), respectively.24–26 The first evidence demonstrating the involvement of NAC TFs in the improvement of drought tolerance in plants was reported in Arabidopsis by the identification and functional analyses of the ANAC019, ANAC055 and ANAC072 genes. Following this work, a number of studies on abiotic stress-related functions of NAC TFs in various plant species have been reported.2,4,11,19,27 The recent completion of the soybean genomic sequence has facilitated the prediction of at least 61 TF families in soybean, among which the plant-specific NAC TF family consists of more than 180 putative members.28–32 Given the importance of NAC TFs in diverse biological and physiological processes and their potential application for the development of improved drought-tolerant transgenic crop plants, we carried out a systematic analysis of the soybean NAC TF family in the present study. Putative GmNAC TFs predicted by genome-wide surveys of the soybean genomic sequence (Glyma 1 model) and those provided by various databases have been carefully analysed and subjected to phylogenetic analyses with their Arabidopsis and rice counterparts. These comparisons have enabled the identification of gene orthologs and clusters of orthologous groups that can be studied for further functional characterization. Taking advantage of the wealth of available expression data, which were generated by either high-throughput microarray expression profiling experiments or Illumina transcriptome sequencing, we also performed a comprehensive analysis of tissue-specific expression of all GmNAC genes, which in turn provided important complementary datasets to assist in the elucidation of their function. Furthermore, we used a time-coursed dehydration stress treatment and subsequent quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis as a precise mechanism for detailing the root- and shoot-related expression patterns of predicted stress-responsive GmNAC genes. The results of this systematic analysis of the GmNAC family have enabled us to identify appropriate root- or shoot-related and/or dehydration-responsive GmNAC candidate genes and their respective promoters to be used as candidates in further in planta functional analyses. Ultimately, these findings will lead to potential applications for the improvement of drought resistance in soybean via genetic engineering.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant growth, treatments and collection of tissuesSoybean cv. Williams 82 seeds were germinated in 6-l pots containing vermiculite and were well-watered and grown under greenhouse conditions (continuous 30°C temperature, photoperiod of 12 h/12 h, 80 µmol m-2 s-1 photon flux density and 60%; relative humidity). For tissue-specific expression profiling of GmNAC genes, root and shoot tissues were collected from 12-day-old soybean plants in three biological replicates. For expression profiling of GmNAC genes under dehydration stress, the dehydration treatment was carried out in time-course experiments to identify dynamic changes in transcripts in response to dehydration stress as previously described.33 Root and shoot tissues were collected separately in three biological replicates for the expression profiling studies.2.2. Identification of the GmNAC members in soybeanAll GmNAC members predicted in soybean were collected for manual analysis,28,30,31 and only those GmNAC proteins containing full open reading frames (ORFs), as predicted by Glyma1 model, were used for further analyses. We used the TMHHM server ver. 2.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/) to enable the prediction of the membrane-bound GmNAC members.2.3. Phylogenetic analysisSequence alignments of related proteins belonging to each class from Arabidopsis, rice and soybean proteins were performed with a gap open penalty of 10 and a gap extension penalty of 0.2 using ClustalW implemented on MEGA 4 software.34,35 The alignments were subsequently visualized using GeneDoc (http://www.nrbsc.org/gfx/genedoc/) as presented in Supplementary Fig. S1.36 The sequence alignments were also used to construct the unrooted phylogenetic trees by the neighbour-joining method using MEGA4 software. The confidence level of monophyletic groups was estimated using a bootstrap analysis of 10 000 replicates. Only bootstrap values higher than 40%; are displayed next to the branch nodes.2.4. Soybean affymetrix microarray data analysisGene expression data available for each putative soybean GmNAC gene were retrieved from the soybean gene expression data housed within the Genevestigator database by correspondences between soybean genes from the Glyma1 model and probe identifiers from Affymetrix GeneChip probes.37 The respective model IDs used in the Glyma1 model for the respective model IDs that were used in the Affymetrix Genechip were identified by Soybase (http://soybase.org/AffyChip/index.php).38 A total of 61 probes were found and corresponded to 48 GmNAC genes in this study. These probes were subsequently used for data retrieval and analysis.2.5. Soybean Illumina expression data analysisWe utilized Illumina transcriptome sequencing data that was previously generated and analysed by Libault et al.39,40 to evaluate the expression of GmNAC genes. Sequencing data included transcriptome analyses from 13 different conditions, including nodules, roots, root tips, leaves, flowers, green pods, apical meristem, mock-inoculated and Bradyrhizobium japonicum-infected root hair cells harvested at 12, 24 and 48 h after inoculation.2.6. RNA isolation, DNaseI treatment, cDNA synthesisPlant tissue samples were ground into a fine powder using a mortar and pestle. Total RNA was isolated using the TRIZOL reagent according to the manufacturer's supplied protocol (Invitrogen). RNA concentration, DNaseI treatment and cDNA synthesis were performed as previously described.332.7. qRT-PCR and statistical analysesGene-specific primers for soybean GmNAC genes were designed using the Primer3 software.41 Primer specificity was first confirmed by blasting each primer sequence against the soybean genome (Glyma1 model).32 We performed subsequent analysis of melting curves and visualization of amplicon fragments. Primers were found gene-specific if corresponding melting curves yielded a single sharp peak and if the primers exhibited an electrophoresis pattern of a single amplicon with the correct predicted length. Under these strict criteria, we were able to design primers for 42 out of 58 putative stress-related GmNAC genes (Supplementary Table S1). As previously described, the CYP2 gene was selected as a reference gene for the expression profiling of soybean genes.42 qRT-PCR reactions and data analyses were performed as previously described.33 When appropriate, a Student's t-test (one tail, unpaired, equal variance) was used to determine the statistical significance of the differential expression patterns between tissues and/or between treatments. Differential expression data were regarded as statistically significant only when passing the t-test with a P-value of <0.05. Considering the biological significance of the differential expression in this study, we adopted a cut-off value of 3-fold for tissue-specific expression and 2-fold when analysing stress induction or repression. The expression levels were designated as ‘different’, ‘induced’ or ‘repressed’ only if such differences met the above criteria and passed the Student's t-test.3. Results and discussion3.1. Identification and chromosomal distribution of the GmNAC members in soybeanThe GmNAC members in soybean have been predicted by three independent groups using genome-wide screening of soybean genomic sequences (Glyma1 model). However, each group provided different numbers of putative GmNAC TFs within their public databases. The highest number of GmNAC TFs (226) was reported by SoyDB, while SoybeanTFDB and PlantTFDB predicted 205 and 183 putative GmNACs, respectively.28,30,31,43,44 As an initial step, we collected the sequences for all of the putative GmNAC TFs from three databases for sequence comparison. Among all of the predicted putative GmNAC TFs, 152 members were found to contain full ORFs as predicted by the Glyma1 model. Only these predicted full-length GmNAC TFs were used for further analyses. If Glyma1 predicted several splice variants for a given gene, all of the alternative splice variants were carefully checked. Splice variants encoding the longest reading frames were selected as representatives for subsequent sequence alignments and phylogenetic analyses. For these studies, we also utilized the soybean FL-cDNA information that is also publicly available (http://rsoy.psc.riken.jp/).The GmNAC genes are distributed on every chromosome in soybean (Fig. 1A). Chromosome 12 contains the highest number of GmNACs, with14 out of 152 members (~9%), while chromosomes 3 only contains one member (<1%; Fig. 1A). The relative locations of the GmNAC genes were indicated on their respective chromosome and genes located within 20 loci from each other were marked with a star to indicate possible tandem duplications (Fig. 1B). Supplementary Table S2 provided significant information including gene IDs as defined by the Glyma1 model for each predicted GmNAC TF, lengths of amino acid sequences and corresponding available full-length cDNA (FL-cDNA) accession numbers (RIKEN) for the identified 152 full-length GmNAC TFs. Additionally, the cDNAs and protein sequences annotated by the Glyma1 model of these 152 GmNAC TFs are provided as additional data that can be easily downloaded for convenient use (Supplementary Dataset 1). A uniform nomenclature for all the GmNAC genes identified in this work and those, which were previously characterized,42,45,46 has been adopted taking into account the order of the chromosomes to facilitate scientific communication (Supplementary Table S2).

Structural and phylogenetic analyses of GmNAC TFsIn order to examine the structure of GmNAC TFs identified in our study, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of their deduced protein sequences together with three representative ANACs of Arabidopsis11 (Supplementary Fig. S1). As expected, most of the GmNAC TFs shared a highly conserved N-terminal DNA-binding domain of the typical NAC domain containing five consensus subdomains and a highly variable C-terminal transcriptional regulation domain. Several GmNACs do not contain the typical NAC domain. For example, Gm04g08320/GmNAC015, Gm13g18620/GmNAC096 and Gm19g08510/GmNAC142 lack the conserved A and B subdomains and Gm08g18050/GmNAC060 lacks the conserved C and D subdomains. In these cases, these proteins are described as NAC-like proteins, according to the classification of ONACs of rice.25 Additionally, all of the examined GmNAC TFs, with the exception of Gm05g32470/GmNAC028 and Gm08g18050/GmNAC060, contain a conserved bipartite nuclear localization signal. This signal sequence has been identified in the D subdomain from many NAC domain proteins among different plant species, suggesting that these GmNACs are nuclear localized (Supplementary Fig. S1).47To study the evolutionary relationship between the GmNAC TFs and among the NAC TFs from different plant species, all GmNACs and NAC TFs from the dicot (Arabidopsis) and monocot (rice) models systems were subjected to a multiple sequence alignment. The multiple sequence alignment file was then used for the construction of an unrooted phylogenetic tree. As illustrated in Supplementary Fig. S2, the phylogenetic analysis classified the GmNACs into a number of different subgroups together with their ANAC and ONAC orthologs. Similar to Arabidopsis and rice, these data identified the existence of a diversified GmNAC family in soybean with diverse functions.25,26 Interestingly, among the subgroups identified by phylogenetic analysis, one subgroup only contains rice ONACs. This finding suggests that NACs from monocots and dicots are evolutionarily distinct. Specifically, ONACs originate from rice and the ANACs and GmNACs are exclusive to Arabidopsis and soybean, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S2).One of our main interests for performing phylogenetic analysis of GmNAC TFs was to enable the prediction of abiotic stress-responsive GmNAC genes that could be subsequently prioritized for further in planta functional studies. Previous reports have provided strong evidence for phylogenetic analysis-based prediction of the stress-related function of several gene families, including TF families. Phylogenetic analysis of the soybean AP2_EREBP and rice ONAC families with their orthologs from other plant species, whose stress-responsive expression patterns and/or functions are known, resulted in a nearly perfect match between sequence conservation and functions or expression patterns.25,48 Among the ANACs and ONACs, many proteins which are involved in the regulation of physiological and biochemical responses are associated with resistance to various abiotic stresses, including drought.10 For instance, Arabidopsis ANAC019, ANAC055 and ANAC072 and rice SNAC1/ONAC002 and OsNAC6/SNAC2/ONAC048 act as positive regulators in drought stress response.11,18,19,27 On the basis of sequence alignments and phylogenetic analyses, which included a number of known stress-related NAC TFs from Arabidopsis and rice, we identified 50 new putative stress-related GmNAC genes. These predicted GmNACs clustered into six monophyletic groups (Fig. 2A and B). Eight of nine GmNAC genes (names are highlighted by red colour), which were previously reported as dehydration-responsive genes,42 were also clustered in the stress-responsive clades III, IV, V and VI. These data suggest that the phylogenetic analysis-based gene identification approach is reliable for rationalizing systematic functional predictions of different TF families (Fig. 2A).42,46,49Phylogenetic analysis-based prediction of abiotic stress-related GmNAC genes.

The membrane-bound GmNAC subfamilyIt has been established that the activities of TFs are co-ordinately regulated at multiple steps through transcriptional, posttranscriptional, posttranslational and translocational mechanisms.50,51 A number of these proteins are expressed as membrane-bound TFs (MTFs) and are stored in their dormant forms, and the degradation of their cytoplasmic anchors is required for their activation.50 The activated TFs enter the nucleus where they are then capable of functioning to regulate the expression of their respective target genes. There are at least 85 and 45 MTFs in Arabidopsis and rice genomes, respectively, and virtually all of the MTFs exist in all major TF families. Within the NAC family, a genome-wide analysis predicted at least 18 and 5 MTFs in Arabidopsis and rice, respectively.21 Each of the NAC MTFs, which are also called NTLs in other publications, contains an a-helical TM in their C terminal regions. This TM is responsible for anchoring to either plasma membranes or endoplasmic reticulum membranes and is involved in the regulation of activities of NTLs primarily at the processing step.20Among the 152 soybean GmNACs, 11 GmNAC MTFs were predicted based upon the existence of the TMs identified using the TMHMM server 2.0 (Table 1; Supplementary Table S2). All Arabidopsis and rice NAC MTFs members have been predicted to contain a single TM.21 In contrast, 9 of the 11 identified GmNAC MTFs were found to contain a single TM, whereas the remaining two (GmNAC013 and GmNAC136) contain two TMs (Table 1). A phylogenetic tree of the NAC MTFs from soybean, Arabidopsis and rice was constructed and is visualized in Fig. 3. Strong lines of evidence have indicated that a number of the functionally characterized NAC MTFs are closely related with plant responses to environmental stresses.20,50 In Arabidopsis, studies have shown that at least four NTLs (NTL6/At3g49530, NTL8/At2g27300, NTL9/At4g35580 and NTL12/NTM1/At4g01540) function in stress responses. These NTLs are activated by membrane-associated proteases in the endoplasmic reticulum by liberating the TFs from their TM domain when plants experience environmental stresses.20,52,53 Thus, it is feasible that a number of the GmNAC MTFs identified in this study play an important role in gene regulatory networks that serve as an adaptive strategy for soy plants to survive under adverse growth conditions.

Analysis of expression patterns of GmNAC genes using Affymetrix arraysTissue-specific expression profiles are useful data because they identify the genes which are involved in defining the precise nature of individual tissues. It is well established that the mechanisms controlling drought resistance are either associated with root- and/or shoot-related traits.1 For instance, an extensive fibrous root system can be useful for foraging subsoil surface moisture and nutrients such as phosphorus. In addition, plants can adapt to drought stress by developing a longer taproot which enables the plant to reach lower soil layers where water is more readily available. On the other hand, a restraint of shoot growth has been shown to be advantageous in adverse environments by minimizing evaporative leaf surface area. Hence, the appropriate control of shoot- and root-related morphological traits is a promising approach for developing drought resistance in a number of crops, including soybean.1,54,55 In Arabidopsis, the CUC1, CUC2 and CUC3 (CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON) NAC TFs have been shown to be involved in shoot apical meristem formation and development,22,56 while NAC1 and AtNAC2 are involved in the regulation of lateral root development.13,57 Overexpression of the NAC1 and AtNAC2 genes, which are preferentially expressed in roots, promoted lateral root development in Arabidopsis.13,57 These data suggest that tissue-specifically expressed NAC genes have the potential to be used for the genetic engineering of specific traits.As a result, we first utilized the Affymetrix array data housed within Genevestigator to examine the specific expression patterns of GmNAC genes.37 This was our first approach towards the identification of candidate genes that could be potentially used for enhancing drought resistance by altering shoot and/or root growth when overexpressed or repressed in transgenic plant systems. The Affymetrix Soybean Array GeneChip was specifically designed to analyse ~37 500 soybean, 15 800 Phytophthora sojae as well as 7500 Heterodera glycines transcripts. The current Affymetrix array data available at Genevestigator contain measurements of transcript levels for 35 different organs and tissues. The respective model IDs of GmNAC genes used in the Glyma1 model for the respective model IDs that were used in the Affymetrix Genechip were identified by Soybase (http://soybase.org/AffyChip/index.php).38We confirmed that probes exist for a total of 48 GmNAC genes on the soybean GeneChip. The heat map shown in Supplementary Fig. S3 displays the patterns of expression of these GmNAC genes within 35 major organs and tissues. Clustering analysis of the expression data indicates high variability in transcript abundance of the GmNAC genes. Among the 48 GmNAC genes, many are highly and specifically expressed in roots and/or leaves, suggesting that these could be candidate genes for the potential engineering of plant responses within those specific tissue types. Only a small portion of GmNAC genes were found to be ubiquitously expressed in all of the examined tissues. The data supplied here are useful to assess the extent of GmNAC gene expression, as they provide the first line of temporal and spatial evidence which links them to putative in planta functions. With respect to the response to P. sojae infections, our clustering analysis detected a group of 10 GmNAC genes which showed strong induction in all of the studies examined (Supplementary Fig. S4). These data suggest that these GmNACs potentially function in response to P. sojae infections.3.5. Analysis of expression patterns of GmNAC genes using Illumina transcriptome dataSince the current soybean Affymetrix Genechip platform was limited and did not enable analysis for all 152 GmNAC genes, we also utilized transcriptome data derived from Illumina sequencing of soybean short transcripts to assess the expression patterns of all GmNAC genes. This transcriptome atlas provided expression data for 55 616 putative soybean genes in eight types of tissues and organs, including root tips, roots, root hairs, nodules, leaves, shoot apical meristems, flowers and green pods.40 Although there were fewer tissues and organs examined in comparison to Affymetrix Genechip data, expression profiles for all 152 GmNAC genes could be investigated. Consistent with observations from Affymetrix Genechip data, the results shown in Supplementary Fig. S5A indicate high variability in the transcript abundance of GmNAC genes. As shown in the heat maps, the spatial expression patterns of numerous GmNAC genes are tissue-specific, while others are ubiquitous. These observations indicate that the functions of the GmNACs are diversified in a similar manner as that of their Arabidopsis counterparts.10,22,58 Figure 4 highlighted the expression patterns of 58 GmNAC genes, which were predicted as stress-related genes by phylogenetic analysis. Eight genes were expressed strongly and ubiquitously in all eight tissues (Fig. 4, box A), while 16 genes were preferentially expressed in roots, root hairs and flowers (Fig. 4, black bar at right). Interestingly, among these 16 genes, only seven genes were also found to be preferentially transcribed in root tips (Fig. 4). The tissue-specific and stress-related genes could serve as good candidates for the engineering of stress-related traits under stress conditions. Additionally, for those who have an interest in studying the functions of GmNACs in response to B. japonicum innoculations, expression data for all 152 GmNAC genes in mock-inoculated and B. japonicum-infected root hair cells harvested at 12, 24 and 48 h after inoculation are summarized and provided on Supplementary Fig. S4. The expression of a number of GmNAC genes was remarkably altered after the infection with the bacterium.

On the other hand, ubiquitously expressed GmNACs alone, in isolation or in combination with each other or with other type(s) of TFs, might control general cellular machinery. Combinations of specific and/or stress-related GmNACs with other type(s) of TFs might regulate tissue-specific and/or stress-responsive downstream genes. Alternatively, ubiquitous GmNACs might serve as a platform to regulate a broad set of genes which are subsequently fine-tuned by specific regulators. Molecular dynamics involving extensive protein–protein interactions, such as specific homodimerizations and heterodimerizations, as well as modular flexibility and posttranslational modifications, have been shown to determine the functional specificity of TFs. Analysis of such interactions will help elucidate patterns of combinatorial regulation and will ultimately help define the regulatory functions of the GmNAC TFs themselves.3,18,59,603.6. Expression patterns of predicted GmNAC genes in roots and shoots during dehydration stressIn a previous section, we used sequence similarity comparisons and phylogenetic analyses to predict 58 stress-related members, of which 50 were new, among all 152 GmNAC genes (Fig. 2). With the goal of identifying candidate dehydration-responsive GmNAC genes for the engineering of soybean plants with improved drought resistance, we aimed to first perform systematic expression profiling of GmNACs prior to launching laborious in planta functional studies for multiple GmNAC genes. Specifically, we employed qRT-PCR analysis of 38 predicted stress-related GmNAC genes with gene-specific primers in root and shoot tissues of 12-day-old soybean plants subjected to 2 and 10 h dehydration stress. Five (GmNAC011, GmNAC019, GmNAC 043, GmNAC092 and GmNAC109) and three (GmNAC041, GmNAC061 and GmNAC102) GmNAC genes previously reported as dehydration-responsive and dehydration-unresponsive, respectively, were also included in the qRT-PCR experiment as decoys to verify the positive and negative discovery rates (Supplementary Table S2).42 Additionally, the evaluation of expression patterns in individual stressed tissues, rather than whole plants, might provide information on the mode of action of stress-responsive genes in specific tissues.On the other hand, in comparison with the in silico expression analyses based on either the Affymetrix Genechip platform or Illumina sequencing, this experimental design also provided us with more reliable information on the expression patterns of these 42 GmNAC genes in root and shoot tissues of soybean seedlings grown under normal conditions. The expression of all 42 genes was detectable under our experimental conditions and the qRT-PCR results allowed us to classify the 42 GmNAC genes into four groups based on their transcript abundance detected in roots and shoots (Fig. 5A–D). Twenty-two of the 42 GmNAC genes were preferentially or specifically expressed in either roots or shoots of seedlings according to the criteria defined for the analysis of tissue-specific expression (Fig. 5E).40 Specifically, 12 and 10 GmNAC genes were preferably or specifically expressed in root and shoot tissues, respectively, whereas 20 out of 42 GmNAC genes tested were ubiquitously expressed in roots and shoots (Fig. 5).

(A–D) The GmNAC genes were classified into four groups based upon their expression levels. (E) Number of GmNAC genes expressed ubiquitously or tissue-specifically in roots or shoots.As for dehydration-responsive expression, a significant number of soybean GmNAC genes were found to be dehydration-responsive in either roots or shoots or both tissues (Fig. 6). A total of 29 induced and six repressed GmNAC genes were identified with a fold change of two or more, representing 83%; of the 42 genes examined being stress-related. Among 29 GmNAC genes, including four decoy dehydration-responsive genes, 4, 13 and 12 genes were induced in root, shoot and both tissues, respectively (Fig. 6A). As for the repressed GmNAC genes, expression of all six genes was down-regulated by dehydration in the shoots (Fig. 6B). Expression levels of GmNAC genes that did not respond to dehydration were not shown. Overall, the qRT-PCR verification demonstrated that the sequence similarity-based method has an accuracy rate of 83%; for the stress-related GmNAC genes. This rate suggests that this sequence similarity-based targeted gene identification approach has great potential for genome-wide prediction for stress-related TFs in plants or other species. Additionally, among the induced GmNAC genes, GmNAC085 was the most induced by dehydration with 390-fold and 20-fold induction in shoots and roots, respectively. The protein encoded by GmNAC085 exhibited 39%; and 50%; identity and similarity, respectively, to the most extensively characterized rice NAC TF (SNAC1/ONAC02) which conferred drought tolerance to transgenic rice plants under field conditions.19GmNAC085, therefore, appears to be an excellent candidate for further in planta studies in soybean.

Expression patterns of 38 predicted stress-responsive and 4 decoy dehydration-responsive GmNAC genes were analysed in dehydration-treated root (white bars) and shoot (black bars) tissues of soybean seedlings.

ConclusionsThe focusing of research efforts on uncharacterized TFs using high-throughput genomic surveys and the analysis of huge resources of available expression data to describe key features of novel TFs, in combination with a detailed examination using traditional molecular approaches, will undoubtedly accelerate our functional understanding of these important regulatory genes. This report has provided the comprehensive identification and characterization of the soybean NAC TF family, with a special emphasis on the relation to dehydration stress responsiveness. Additionally, our results have provided useful information by identifying candidate tissue-specific and/or dehydration-responsive GmNAC genes. By combining these genes with their associated dehydration-responsive promoters, scientists will be able utilize these resources to engineer soybean plants for enhanced stress resistance. The foundation of knowledge presented in this work has revealed the diverse functions of the GmNAC TFs in different biological aspects. Future follow-up studies will rapidly improve our understanding of the regulatory function of NAC members. A greater understanding of how TFs operate will be subsequently translated into their potential applications to enhance plant productivity.Supplementary dataSupplementary Data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingD.T.L. is supported by the RIKEN Foreign Postdoctoral Fellowship.

IntroductionBrassica species include many important crop vegetables and oil seeds, such as cabbage, Brussels sprouts, broccoli, cauliflower, radish, mustard, oilseed rape, kale, and turnip. These species belong to the Brassicaceae (Cruciferae) family, which includes more than 3300 species.1Arabidopsis thaliana is one of the most important species in the Brassicaceae family as it has been widely studied as an experimental model plant. Many useful genomic resources and other information are now available for A. thaliana (MASC report 2010: http://www.Arabidopsis.org/portals/masc/masc_docs/masc_reports.jsp). Sequencing of the Arabidopsis genome was completed in December 2000 by the Arabidopsis Genome Initiative (AGI 2000).2Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa subsp. pekinensis) originated in China and is one of the most important Brassica vegetables found in Asian countries. Presently, genome sequencing of B. rapa is being carried out as a multinational collaboration between China, the UK, Korea, Canada, Australia, and Japan (http://brassica.bbsrc.ac.uk/), and has recently entered the final phase.3 It has been estimated that the Chinese cabbage genome contains ~46000 genes,4 whereas 27379 genes are currently believed to exist in the Arabidopsis genome (TAIR9 information: http://www.Arabidopsis.org/).Arabidopsis and Brassica were originally estimated to have diverged from a common ancestor between 14.5 and 20.4 million years ago.5 Recently, Mun et al.6 reported that B. rapa diverged from the Brassica progenitor around 8 million years ago as a result of a whole-genome triplication event. They also performed genetic mapping for genome-wide comparative analyses, which revealed co-linear chromosome segments shared between Arabidopsis and B. rapa. Linkage arrangements between Arabidopsis and Brassica oleracea were also reported.7,8 In the light of these findings, knowledge gained from Arabidopsis becomes very useful for the study of Brassica crops. The development of a catalogue of gene transcripts from Brassica plants will serve as a critical resource for future molecular studies. Currently, 24963 Brassica unigene sequences have been obtained (http://www.brassica-rapa.org/BrEMD/microarray_overview.jsp) from different tissues, organs, or seeds and from different developmental stages of Brassica plants. However, this information is insufficient for the effective transfer of knowledge about Arabidopsis to Brassica crops.Development of full-length cDNA collections is one of the effective strategies for increasing the catalogue of gene transcripts. These data serve as a valuable resource to describe gene expression profiles and ultimately classify genes into families based on their functions. Full-length cDNA collections can also serve as a powerful tool to facilitate genomic or other -omics research.9 Several techniques have been established to prepare enriched full-length cDNA libraries.10 The usefulness of full-length cDNAs has been confirmed in humans,11 mice,12 and in various plants such as Arabidopsis,13,14 rice,15 poplar,16 maize,17 tomato,18 and soybean.19 A major advantage of this approach is that most of the clones contain the complete coding sequences, in addition to the 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions. Ichikawa et al.20 reported the development of the full-length cDNA overexpressing gene hunting (FOX hunting) system. They reported that 10000 independent Arabidopsis full-length cDNAs were expressed in Arabidopsis plants under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter. The FOX hunting system has also been applied to full-length cDNA clones from rice.21 This system has aided in the isolation of several important genes that confer tolerance to environmental stresses or resistance to biotic stresses.22–24In the present study, we prepared a RIKEN BRC B. rapa full-length (BBRAF) cDNA library and cDNA clones, and we isolated 5476 independent sequences from 10 000 clones. In addition, we identified marker genes for the plant defence response in B. rapa based on homology to Arabidopsis genes and compared their expression in several B. rapa cultivars.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materials and cultivationWe grew Chinese cabbage (B. rapa subsp. pekinensis) plants in soil (Professional soil: Dio Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan). We used KmP02, a clubroot-resistant (CR) double-haploid line derived from a CR F1 cultivar of Chinese cabbage (Hatakeyama et al., unpublished result), for our expression analyses and for constructing the full-length cDNA library. We also used Kyoto No. 3, Kigokoro 85, Okiniiri, Muso (Takii Seed Co. Ltd, Kyoto, Japan), and Chifu hakusai (Tohoku Seed Co. Ltd, Utsunomiya, Japan) for expression analyses. Seeds were sown in sterile soil in pots, moistened, and held at 4°C for 7 days in the dark to synchronize germination. The pots were then transferred to 22°C with a long-day photoperiod (16 h light/8 h dark). Except as noted in subsequent sections, all plants were grown under these conditions for the various stress treatments that we applied. Plants at the four-leaf stage were transferred individually into new pots and grown to the rosette stage.2.2. Foliar treatment with chemicalsTo determine the effects of chemical stress on gene expression, we sprayed the leaves with solutions of 5 mM salicylic acid, 0.5 mM benzothiadiazole, 1 mM ethephon, 0.1 mM methyl jasmonate, 0.025 µM paraquat, 0.1 mM abscisic acid, or 10 mM CuSO4. The plants were then placed in a growth chamber at 22°C under a 16 h light/8 h dark cycle. Leaves were harvested at 5, 10, and 24 h after treatment.2.3. Drought, salt, and cold stressesTo create drought stress, the seedlings were transferred from the soil pots onto dry filter paper and allowed to air-dry. For salt stress, the seedlings were transferred into 250 mM NaCl solution. For cold stress, seedlings were transferred into a refrigerated chamber, in which the temperature was controlled at 4°C. Leaves were harvested at 5, 10, and 24 h after treatment.2.4. WoundingTo simulate wounding stress, the leaves were wounded with scissors. The plants were then placed in a growth chamber at 22°C under a 16 h light/8 h dark cycle. Leaves were harvested at 5, 10, and 24 h after treatment.2.5. Ultraviolet radiationUltraviolet (UV-C) irradiation (0.1 kJ/m2) was supplied by a UV-C light. The plants were then placed in a growth chamber at 22°C under a 16 h light/8 h dark cycle. Leaves were harvested at 5, 10, and 24 h after treatment.2.6. Root treatment with chemicalsThe seedlings were transferred from soil pots into 0.5 mM benzothiadiazole solution or 1 mM ethephon solution. The roots were harvested 24 h after treatment.2.7. RNA preparationTotal RNA was isolated using a modification of the method of Chirgwin et al.25 The tissues were ground to a fine in the presence of liquid nitrogen. The powder was then mixed with 10 volumes of GTC solution containing 4 M guanidinium thiocyanate, 25 mM sodium citrate (pH 7.0), 0.5% sodium N-lauroylsarcosine, and 0.1 M 2-mercaptoethanol. The cellular debris was pelleted out (14000g for 10 min at 4°C). About 2.4 ml of the supernatant was layered on top of 1.1 ml of 5.7 M CsCl cushion solution (5.7 M CsCl, 0.1 M EDTA) to create a step gradient and centrifuged at 240000g for 2 h at 20°C. The RNA pellet was dissolved in a mixture of 10 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.5) and 5 mM EDTA (pH 8.0). The supernatant was extracted with successive, equal volumes of phenol–chloroform and chloroform. The upper phase was collected and mixed with one-third of its volume of 8 M LiCl. The RNA was precipitated at 4°C overnight and centrifuged at 14 000g for 30 min. The pellet was washed with 70% ethanol and dissolved in DEPC-treated water. Poly(A) + RNA was isolated by using Oligo(dT)-Latex (OligotexTM-dT30-Super; Roche, Tokyo, Japan) by following the manufacturer's instructions.2.8. Construction of the cDNA libraryAliquots of total RNA extracted from the plant materials after each treatment were mixed equally to obtain one composite sample per treatment. The RNA mixture was used for the construction of an enriched full-length cDNA library based on the method of Kato et al.26 by using a vector-capping method. The resultant double-stranded cDNAs were ligated into a pGCAP10 vector. The primary library size was estimated at 2.4 × 106 colony-forming units (cfu) in the Chinese cabbage library.2.9. Sequencing of both ends of the BBRAF cDNA clonesThe plasmid DNA of each clone was prepared from bacterial cultures by using a NucleoSpin Multi-96 Plus Plasmid kit (Nihon Genetix Co.). End sequencing of 10 000 clones was carried out with an ABI 3700 capillary sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The BBRAFpGCAP10F primer (5'-ACTGCTCCTCAGTGGATGTT-3') and the BBRAF-polyT primer [mixture of equal amounts of 5'-T(30)AA-3', 5'-T(30)AT-3', 5'-T(30)AC-3', 5'-T(30)AG-3', 5'-T(30) CA-3', 5'-T(30)CT-3', 5'-T(30)CC-3', 5'-T(30)CG-3', 5'-T(30)GA-3', 5'-T(30)GT-3', 5'-T(30)GC-3', and 5'-T(30)GG-3'] were used for forward and reverse sequencing, respectively.2.10. Trimming and assembly of sequence dataRaw sequence data (chromatograms) were base-called using version X of the Phred software and vector sequences were then detected by using cross_ match. We trimmed off low-quality regions (for which the average quality score of a five-base window was <20) and the vector sequences of both ends of each read. Poly-A sequences of 15 or more bases were also trimmed off if found at the end of 5' expressed sequence tags. Sequences that were shorter than 30 bases and left behind after the trimming process were also omitted from further analysis. The expressed sequence tags were assembled using version X of the PCAP.REP software without mate-pair constraints27 as the insert size of each clone could not be assigned a priori. All sequences were submitted to the DNA Databank of Japan (DDBJ).2.11. Annotation of the sequencesWe aligned the above sequences with known Arabidopsis sequences in the TAIR9 transcript database (http://www.Arabidopsis.org/) using a BLASTN search (e-value < 0.1) to estimate the degree of homology to Arabidopsis genes. To detect genes that did not exist in the Arabidopsis database, we used a BLASTN search with e-values >0.1.2.12. Quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCRWe treated 2-week-old Chinese cabbage plants at the rosette stage with 100 µM jasmonic acid or 1 mM salicylic acid for 2, 5, 10, or 24 h (n = 5 per duration, with two replicates). The plants were then frozen in liquid nitrogen and total RNA (2 µg) was isolated with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and an RNeasy MinElute Cleanup Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). Quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR was carried out with the Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) by using the first-strand cDNA as a template and an ABI Prism 7900HT sequence detector (Applied Biosystems). Expression of BrACT2 was used for normalization (i.e. values for all other genes were divided by the activity of this gene). Nucleotide sequences for the B. rapa gene-specific primers were as follows: BrVSP2 (forward, 5'-GACTC CAAAACGGTGTGCAAA-3'; reverse, 5'-AGGGTCTCG TCAAGGTCAAAGA-3'); BrLOX2 (forward, 5'-TCCCCA CTTCCGCTACACC-3'; reverse, 5'-AATACTTTCCGGGC CAGAAAC-3'); BrPR1 (forward, 5'-TACGCTCAAAACTA CGCCGA-3'; reverse, 5'-GAAAGGTCCCCGCTACTTCC-3'); BrBGL2 (forward, 5'-GCAGAACATCGATAGAGC GGT-3'; reverse, 5'-TGAATGTCCCACTCGAAGGC-3'); and BrACT2 (forward, 5'-ACCCAAAGGCCAACAGA GAG-3'; reverse, 5'-CTGGCGTAAAGGGAGAGAACA-3').2.13. Accession numbersThe GenBank accession numbers for the genes mentioned in Section 2.12 are as follows: BrPR1 (BBRAF03K11), BrBGL2 (BBRAF10P08), BrVSP2 (EX103556), BrLOX2 (EX100417), and BrACT2 (BBRAF03F20).3. Results and discussion3.1. Construction and sequencing of the BBRAF clonesWe used the CR breeding line, KmP02, for constructing the RIKEN BRC B. rapa full-length cDNA (BBRAF cDNA) library, because the resistance to clubroot disease is one of the most important breeding aim for Chinese cabbage. The library was constructed by using plants subjected to the biotic and abiotic stresses summarized in Table 1. We then determined the 5' and 3' sequences from 10 000 independent BBRAF clones, resulting in 4251 full-length sequences that corresponded to 2621 independent clones. The average length of these BBRAF clones was 900 bp. Further analyses will be required to determine the full-length sequences of the remaining 5749 BBRAF clones. The number of independent B. rapa cDNAs was 5476 from 10000 BBRAF clones. We built a cluster profile representing the number of each independent clones (Fig. 1A). The most frequently encountered gene was the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase (RuBisCO) small subunit 2B (rbcs-2B) gene with 87 BBRAF clones.

Comparative analyses between the BBRAF clones and Arabidopsis genesChinese cabbage belongs to the same family (Brassicaceae) as Arabidopsis, an experimental plant with a large body of functional information and expression data for each gene. It is therefore useful to take advantage of the Arabidopsis-related information to serve as a reference for Brassica genes. To do so, we searched for Arabidopsis homologues of each BBRAF clone using the BLASTN software and the TAIR9 Arabidopsis DNA database (ftp://ftp.Arabidopsis.org/home/tair/Genes/TAIR9_genome_release/), which includes coding sequences.28The BLASTN search revealed that 85.2 and 53.2% of the BBRAF sequences corresponded to Arabidopsis sequences with e-values <1e - 50 and <1e - 150, respectively (Fig. 1B). This analysis revealed that B. rapa cDNA showed high homology to Arabidopsis cDNA sequences and suggested the facile formation of counterparts between Chinese cabbage and Arabidopsis. On the other hand, the BBRAF library also contained clones with no homology to Arabidopsis genes. When we used an e-value of >0.1 to identify such clones, we found that 3.1% of the BBRAF clones lacked any Arabidopsis homologues (Fig. 1B). We then carried out BLASTX analyses to search for homologues in the DDBJ plant protein sequence database (http://blast.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/top-j.html).We found the 30 clones with homology to some protein in BLASTX search (e-value <0.001) and have summarized the information on these clones in Table 2. The 16 clones of which were homologous to genes encoding proteins from species other than Arabidopsis. The remaining 14 clones were homologous to genes that encoded Arabidopsis proteins in BLASTX search (Table 2). In Fig. 1C, we have summarized the distribution of gene annotations for the BBRAF clones by using Arabidopsis TAIR9 annotations. Table 3 summarizes the 20 Arabidopsis genes with the largest number of BBRAF counterparts. The two most frequently observed Arabidopsis annotations were for ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase small chain 2B (rbcs-2B, At5g38420) and ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase small subunit 3B (rbcs-3B, At5g38410) in that order. In addition, At1g79040, At2g34430, At2g34420, and At2g39730 were also frequently observed photosynthesis-related annotations.

Importantly, 12 of the 20 most frequently observed annotations summarized in Table 3 were stress-related. To further understand the characteristics of the stress-related clones, we compared the results of searches for the biological functions and molecular processes involving the BBRAF clones in the Arabidopsis gene ontology database (http://www.Arabidopsis.org/tools/bulk/go/index.jsp) with those for the Arabidopsis whole-genome categorization (Fig. 2). Gene ontology searches showed that the BBRAF clones tended to be those with selective responses to abiotic or biotic stimuli (Fig. 2A). As seen in Fig. 2B, the frequency of clones of unknown molecular function was also lower in the BBRAF library than in the Arabidopsis whole-genome library (Fig. 2B). In addition, unknown molecular function was observed at a lower frequency for BBRAF clones with higher homology to Arabidopsis genes (=1e - 150) than for BBRAF clones with lower homology to Arabidopsis genes (Fig. 2B).

Evaluation of the quality of the BBRAF clones and comparison of the BBRAF and Arabidopsis RuBisCO small subunit gene familiesThe quality of the BBRAF library was evaluated based on the presence of a start ATG codon in the 5' sequence of the 20 most frequently observed BBRAF clones in the Arabidopsis annotations (Table 3). The start ATG codon was estimated using the position of the ATG codon in the corresponding Arabidopsis gene. We found that 93.9% of the corresponding BBRAF clones had ATG codons, indicating that the quality of our BBRAF clones was sufficient.To understand more about the BBRAF clones and the degree of similarity between BBRAF clones and Arabidopsis genes, we compared the CDS nucleic acid sequence and the amino acid sequence of rbcs2b and rbcs3b, the two most frequently observed Arabidopsis annotations in the BBRAF clones. RBCS encodes the small subunit of RuBisCo, which is one of the most strongly conserved and well-analysed plant proteins because it catalyses carbon fixation, the first major step in the Calvin cycle.29 In addition, the expression of rbcs is well known to be differentially regulated by light, sugar, and abscisic acid.30,31 In the present study, rbcs-2B was the most frequently observed BBRAF clone (87 clones, Table 3). Comparison of the sequences of the open reading frames (ORFs) of the rbcs gene families in Chinese cabbage and Arabidopsis revealed four rbcs genes in the Arabidopsis genome versus five independent rbcs genes from Chinese cabbage in the BBRAF clones. Sequence alignment (Fig. 3) revealed that six DNA residues at positions located at 184 (A/G), 420 (C/T), 442 (G/C), 455 (A/C), 500 (C/A), and 528 (T/C), and four amino acid residues, located at positions 62 (I/V), 223 (E/Q), 227 (K/T), and 242 (T/N), distinguished Arabidopsis rbcs from Chinese cabbage rbcs (Fig. 3A and C).

(C) Comparison of the amino acid sequences of the five Chinese cabbage and four Arabidopsis RBCS proteins. Fully conserved bases are shown in yellow.

Chinese cabbage rbcs could be grouped into two classes: one is the Arabidopsis-related class (BBRAF12C04, BBRAF34A23) and the other class is weakly related (BBRAF07F11, BBRAF08D01, BBRAF41C02). Genkov and Spreitzer32 reported that the primary residues (Leu-73, Tyr-87, Glu-98, and Trp-127) that are responsible for RBCS protein stability and function were also conserved in all of the Chinese cabbage and Arabidopsis RBCS proteins. Most of the BBRAF clones contained whole-ORF sequences, as described above. We believe that it will be important to determine the full-length sequence of every BBRAF clone. In the future, comparative analyses of Brassica and Arabidopsis proteins at the amino acid sequence level would help us to understand the key residues, important domains, and important functions of these proteins.3.4. Identification of Brassica defence response genesIt is important to compare the changes in gene expression of Arabidopsis and Brassica crops to understand their common and species-specific defence mechanisms. To identify the relevant marker genes in Chinese cabbage, we searched for homologues to Arabidopsis marker genes for the salicylic acid and jasmonic acid pathways. We found putative B. rapa counterpart genes for AtPR1 and AtBGL2 (i.e. BrPR1 and BrBGL2) for the salicylic acid pathway. We compared the DNA sequences of AtPR1 and BrPR1 (Fig. 4A) and the amino acid sequences of their respective proteins, ATPR1 and BRPR1 (Fig. 4B). The DNA sequence identity between AtPR1 and BrPR1 was lower (83.5%) than that between Atrbcs and Brrbcs, which had more than 90% homology (data not shown). We also identified putative B. rapa counterpart genes for AtLOX2 and AtVSP2 (i.e. BrLOX2 and BrVSP2), which are marker genes for the jasmonic acid pathway.

Conserved base positions are shown in yellow.Next, we analysed the effects of salicylic and jasmonic acids on the expression of these Brassica putative marker genes by quantitative real-time RT–PCR. Gene expression of BrPR1 and BrBGL2 was induced by salicylic acid treatment but not by treatment with jasmonic acid or the ethylene precursor, 1-aminocyclopropane-carboxylic acid treatment (Fig. 5A and B), as is the case for Arabidopsis AtPR1 and AtBGL2. BrLOX2 and BrVSP2 gene expression was induced by jasmonic acid but not by salicylic acid, as is the case for Arabidopsis AtLOX2 and AtVSP2. Interestingly, BrLOX2 was slightly induced by 1-aminocyclopropane-carboxylic acid treatment, but this response was not detected for BrVSP2.

The expression level of each gene was normalized to the expression of BrACT2, which is constitutively expressed and shown as the reference value.Next, we compared the effects of salicylic and jasmonic acids on gene expression in several Chinese cabbage cultivars (Kyoto No. 3, Muso, Kigokoro 85, Okiniiri, Chifu hakusai, and KmP02) (Fig. 6). We observed expression of all four marker genes in each of the varieties, which suggests that these genes will be useful in future research on other B. rapa varieties. Interestingly, we detected a stronger response in Muso to jasmonic acid, which regulates resistance to insects such as thrips.33 This suggested that it would be useful to analyse the relationship between this higher sensitivity to jasmonic acid and herbivore resistance in Muso. However, when we compared the resistance of Kyoto No. 3 and Muso with thrips, we found no significant difference (data not shown). Insect resistance is a primary breeding objective but is difficult to improve because it is controlled by a complex signalling cascade. Further trials are needed to identify the Brassica genes involved in jasmonic acid-regulated plant defence responses so as to determine whether the cultivars differ in their resistance to caterpillar and leafminer feeding as well as thrips feeding. Similarly, the Brassica genes involved in salicylic acid-regulated plant defence responses would also be important breeding targets as this pathway is involved in disease resistance.

BBRAF as the Brassica genome resourceMany uses have been reported for full-length cDNA clones in -omics analyses9 as full-length cDNA is a powerful tool to create overexpressors that can be used in research. It is particularly worth noting that several important genes involved in plant stress tolerance have been isolated using the FOX hunting system.34 As in other plant species, several transformation systems have been reported in B. rapa.35–37 Min et al.38 developed the mannose selection system, which is based on tolerance of phosphomannose isomerase. Using a B. rapa transformation system, several researchers have attempted to create stress- and disease-tolerant plants through the overexpression of transgenes.39,40 The BBRAF resource described in the present study would be a good tool for the identification of genes that will be useful for creating Brassica crops with special characteristics, such as insect and disease resistance.Molecular markers have gained considerable importance in plant science and breeding. Among the different classes of existing markers, single sequence repeat (SSR) markers are known to be optimal for plant breeding41 and several studies to develop the SSR markers for B. rapa have been reported.42–45 However, most of these SSRs were genomic SSRs and were frequently located in heterochromatin regions of the chromosomes. Therefore, EST-derived SSRs are preferable because they tend to be randomly distributed along the chromosomes.46 Full-length cDNA contains 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions in addition to complete coding sequences. Parida et al.47 reported that interspecific polymorphism between B. napus and B. rapa detected in silico for the unigne-derived SSR markers was 4.16 times higher in untranslated regions than in coding sequences. The BBRAF clones could therefore be good materials to develop the new SSR markers for B. rapa. Development and mapping of SSRs derived from the BBRAF clones are currently in progress, and some of these SSR markers have already been used for mapping of the late-bolting characteristic of B. rapa.48Developing and enhancing such resources will support and accelerate many aspects of research on B. rapa, for which the genome sequencing of which is now entering its final phase. The importance of such genome resources will increase in the future. For example, Yu et al.49 recently reported the development of 3400 T-DNA insertion mutagenesis lines in Chinese cabbage. Stephenson et al.50 also reported the development of the TILLING platform (Targeting Induced Local Lesions in Genomes), which consists of 9216 M2 plants. Interestingly, the self-fertile line R-o-18 was used to develop the TILLING platform. Self-infertility of Brassica crops is one of the major obstacles in Brassica research. The availability of a self-fertile line could therefore be a breakthrough for Brassica research.We report here the development of new B. rapa genomic resources, the RIKEN BBRAF. The BBRAF resource will be publicly available from the RIKEN Bioresource Center (http://www.brc.riken.go.jp/lab/epd/Eng/). The BBRAF library was constructed using many stress-treated plants. Gene ontology searches showed that BBRAF clones were successfully collected counterpart genes of stress-related Arabidopsis genes. Further transcriptomic data, in addition to the sequence data described in this paper, are required to improve our understanding of the relationships between B. rapa cDNAs and Arabidopsis genes. We are now developing an informatics resource based on the BBRAF clones that will function as a bridge between information for the model plant Arabidopsis and Brassica research. We hope that the BBRAF collection will be a useful tool that can be used to accelerate Brassica research.FundingThis work was supported in part by the Program for Promotion of Basic and Applied Researches for Innovations in Bio-oriented Industry (BRAIN), provided by the Industrial Technology Research Grant Program from the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) of Japan.We thank F.

IntroductionThe mammalian digestive tract harbours diverse microbes, with populations as high as 100 trillion organisms. Their metabolic activities, such as energy harvesting from otherwise indigestible dietary polysaccharides and the synthesis of essential vitamins, and colonization resistance against enteric pathogens are considered beneficial for the host.1,2 The gut microbiota play pivotal roles in the maturation and differentiation of the gut immune system. However, alteration of the gut microbial composition is often linked to various pathological conditions, such as inflammatory bowel diseases, colon cancer and obesity.3–7Our understanding of gut microbiota has been severely hampered by its extreme complexity; however, the recent advent of culture independent techniques that employ 16S rRNA gene sequencing has revealed that mammalian gut microbiota comprise several hundred or more species, and the majority of the constituents are yet to be cultured or characterized.8–11 Moreover, 20–80% of gut microbes are predicted to be non-culturable by current cultivation techniques. Therefore, genomic information of these non-culturable populations is essential to a more thorough understanding of the biology of gut microbiota; however, genome sequencing of non-culturable microbes is still a significant scientific challenge even with metagenome analysis or single cell sequencing using new sequencing technologies.8–12Segmented filamentous bacteria (SFBs), which are clostridia-related, spore-forming, Gram-positive bacteria, are well-known members of these non-culturable populations. SFBs inhabit the terminal ilea of a wide range of mammals.13,14 Their characteristic prevalence at weaning periods and unique morphology of being tightly attached to the epithelial cells around Peyer's patches strongly suggest their involvement in the maturation of the gut immune system.15,16 In fact, it was found that SFB colonization enhances the luminal IgA production.17 More recently, several groups have shown that SFBs play a crucial role in the post-natal maturation of gut immune function, especially in the induction of a specific subset of proinflammatory T helper lymphocytes, Th17 cells.18,19 Thus, more attention is being paid to SFB-derived molecules and the signal transduction pathways responsible for such immunomodulatory effects; however, no technique is available to cultivate and genetically manipulate the SFB in vitro.Here, we report the genome sequence determination of mouse SFBs, the first complete genome of a non-culturable mammalian gut microbe, using SFB cells grown in germ-free mice. An analysis of the genome sequence revealed the genomic features underlying the non-culturability of SFBs and their unique triphasic lifestyle, which would help us to establish an SFB cultivation protocol. In addition, our results are the first to provide insight into the mechanisms of the immunostimulating activities of SFBs and some of the genomic information relevant for human-associated SFBs.2. Materials and methods2.1. Preparation of the genomic DNASFB-gnotobiotic mice were prepared according to the method described by Umesaki et al.15 Briefly, the terminal ileum of an 8-week-old male BALB/c mouse (Clea Japan) was cut into 1-cm pieces. Mucosal epithelial cells were separated from the lamina propria (LP) as described previously.20 The epithelial cells were transferred to a fresh tube containing 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and homogenized using a Teflon grinder. The homogenate was treated with 3% chloroform to lyse the host epithelial cells and non-spore-forming bacteria. After removing the chloroform by bubbling with carbon dioxide, 5-week-old male germ-free BALB/c mice (Clea Japan) that had been kept in vinyl isolators were orally inoculated with the sample. At 2 weeks after inoculation, caecal contents were collected and bacterial DNA was extracted as described previously.212.2. Preparation of mouse LP lymphocytesThe small intestines were opened longitudinally, washed with PBS and incubated for 20 min at 37°C in a FACS buffer [PBS containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 10 mM EDTA, 20 mM HEPES, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 10 µg/ml polymyxin B sulphate, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin]. The intestines were then cut into small pieces and incubated with RPMI1640 containing 10% FBS, 400 units/ml collagenase D and 100 µg/ml DNase I (all from Roche Diagnostics) for 1 h at 37°C. The digested tissues were washed with the FACS buffer, resuspended in 10 ml of 40% Percoll (GE Healthcare) and overlaid on 5 ml of 80% Percoll to perform Percoll gradient separation. Interface cells [LP lymphocytes (LPLs)] were collected and suspended in PBS containing 2% FBS and 0.05% NaN3. For IFN-<U+03B3> and interleukin (IL)-17A detection, the LPLs were stimulated for 4 h with 50 ng/ml of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, 1 µg/ml of ionomycin and 2 µM monensin (all from Sigma). Cells were first stained for surface CD4 and then for intracellular IFN-<U+03B3> and IL-17A after fixation with a 4% paraformaldehyde phosphate buffer solution and washing with a 0.1% saponin-containing buffer. Antibodies used in this part of the study included biotinylated anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody (mAb), FITC-labelled anti-IFN-<U+03B3> mAb, PE-labelled anti-IL-17A mAb and streptavidin-PE-Cy7 (all from eBioscience). Flow cytometry analysis was performed using a FACSCanto II with the FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences).2.3. Genome sequencing, annotation and comparative genomicsThe genome sequence of SFBs was determined using a combined strategy of 454 pyrosequencing (GS FLX; Roche) and Sanger sequencing. A total of 234 915 GS FLX reads were assembled with the GS Assembler software into 242 large contigs (=500 bp). These contigs were then reassembled using the Phred/Phrap/Consed software (http://www.phrap.com) with 25 257 Sanger sequencing reads from plasmid libraries (3 and 10 kb inserts). Gap closing and the re-sequencing of low-quality regions were performed by sequencing the PCR products and the appropriate plasmid clones. The genome sequence was automatically annotated with the Microbial Genome Annotation Pipeline22 and manually curated using the IMC-GE software (In Silico Biology, Inc.). The genome sequence of SFBs has been deposited in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank databases under accession number AP012202.The SFB gene contents were compared with those of Clostridium difficile strain 630 (CD) and C. novyi strain NT (CN). The orthologous protein coding sequences (CDSs or CDS groups) for CD and CN were taken from the MBGD (http://mbgd.genome.ad.jp/). On the basis of the results of a reciprocal BLASTP search between SFB and CD and between SFB and CN (threshold; =25% sequence identity and =60% aligned length coverage of a query sequence), we categorized the CDSs (or CDS groups) from the three genomes into groups of ‘conserved in all’, ‘conserved in SFB and CD but not in CN’, ‘conserved in SFB and CN but not in CD’, ‘conserved in CD and CN but not in SFB’ and those unique to each species.2.4. Analysis of Toll-like receptor 5-linked NF-<U+03BA>B signaling pathway activationFour flagellin genes were PCR-amplified and cloned into pGEX-6P-1 (GE Healthcare) to generate glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-flagellin fusion genes. GST-fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 via incubation with 1 mM IPTG at 20°C overnight and purified with Sepharose 4B GST resin (GE Healthcare). The Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5)-stimulating activities of SFB flagellins were determined by a luciferase reporter assay system as described previously.23 Briefly, the 293T cells were transfected with pNF-<U+03BA>B-Luc (Clontech) and pRL-TK (Promega) in addition to the mouse TLR5-encoding pGA vector or empty vector. pNF-<U+03BA>B-Luc contains the firefly luciferase gene, expression of which is controlled by the upstream NF-<U+03BA>B response elements, and pRL-TK contains the Renilla luciferase gene, which is control by the promoter of the thymidine kinase. At 20 h after transfection, the cells were stimulated with 1 µg/ml of recombinant Salmonella flagellin (IMGENEX Corp.), GST or GST-fusion SFB flagellins for 24 h. After stimulation, the cells were harvested and the luciferase activities in the cell lysates were measured by the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) using a Lumat LB9507 (Berthold). Luciferase activity was expressed as a ratio of the NF-<U+03BA>B-dependent firefly luciferase activity divided by the control Renilla luciferase activity (relative luciferase units).2.5. The search for human SFB-derived sequences in human gut metagenome sequencesFrom the Illumina sequence reads produced in the MetaHIT project,11 we removed reads containing one or more Ns. The remaining 7 345 361 234 reads were trimmed for low-quality sequences and used as queries in a BLAST search against the SFB genome sequence, 1334 RefSeq complete microbial genome sequences (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/RefSeq/) and 16 276 contig sequences produced by the Human Microbiome Project (http://www.hmpdacc.org/). If a query sequence returned a top hit to the mouse SFB genome with a =95% sequence identity for =95% of the query sequence and the difference in the BLAST bit score between the top (to SFB) and second hits was larger than zero, we defined it as a human SFB-related sequence. In the 277 reads we identified, BLASTN bit score differences between the top and second hits ranged from 2.0 to 121.0 (hits for only SFB) and the median value was 11.9, indicating that the 277 sequences showed a significantly higher sequence identity to SFBs than to other known genomes.2.6. EthicsAll animal experiments were performed at the University of Tokushima according to the university's guidelines for animal experiments. The experimental designs were approved by the university animal committee.3. Results and discussion3.1. Genome sequencingTo obtain genomic DNA for sequencing, we generated SFB-associated gnotobiotic mice by orally inoculating SFBs into germ-free BALB/c mice. The SFB cells used for inoculation (mostly in the endospore form) were obtained from the ileal mucosa of an 8-week-old male BALB/c mouse. Monoassociation was confirmed by Gram-staining and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. For the latter, a chromatography comprising single peaks was detected. The SFB cells in the gnotobiotic mice had a segmented filamentous morphology and were tightly attached to the gut epithelia with a deep indentation of the epithelial cell surface where the SFB was attached (Fig. 1A). We further confirmed that the colonization of SFBs in the germ-free mouse intestine induced Th17 and Th1 subsets in the gut LP CD4+ lymphocyte preparation as reported previously18,19; the IL-17-producing Th17 population increased from 0.6% (germ-free mouse) to 8.4% (SFB-gnotobiotic mouse) and the IFN-<U+03B3>-producing Th1 population from 20.5 to 37.0% (Fig. 1B).

BALB/c germ-free mice were colonized with the SFB, and the terminal ilea collected 14 days after inoculation were examined by scanning electron microscopy. SFBs show a characteristic long filamentous morphology and preferentially colonized around Peyer's patches. Epithelial cell surfaces to which SFB attach are deeply indented. (B) Induction of Th1 and Th17 cells by SFB colonization. Intestinal LPLs were isolated from BALB/c germ-free mice or SFB-monoassociated gnotobiotic mice and the percentages of IFN-<U+03B3>+ or IL-17+ cells within the CD4+ lymphocyte population in each LPL preparation were determined by FACS analysis.Morphology and immunostimulatory activity of SFBs grown in SFB-monoassociated gnotobiotic mice.

Because it is currently impossible to generate SFB-gnotobiotic mice from a single SFB cell, the DNA sample contained DNA molecules derived from multiple SFB clones. In fact, we observed many single-nucleotide polymorphisms and small indels. Therefore, when sequence polymorphisms were observed, we regarded the most frequently appearing sequence as representative of the SFB genome sequence.3.2. General genome featuresThe genome of SFBs comprises a single circular chromosome of 1 620 005 bp with an average 28.8% GC content (Table 1). The chromosome encodes 1491 CDSs, 6 rRNA (rrn) operons, 37 tRNA genes and only 24 pseudogenes. Of the 1491 CDSs, 994 (66.7%) were functionally assigned. Like other low GC content Gram-positive bacteria, the SFB chromosome exhibits clear GC skew transitions at the replication origin and terminus and a strong coding bias with 82.4% of the CDSs being encoded on the leading strand (Fig. 2). Chromosome regions showing GC bias anomalies correspond to rrn or prophage regions.

The sixth depicts prophages, the seventh GC content, the eighth GC skew, the ninth rRNA operons and the tenth tRNA genes.The SFB contains no IS elements but four prophages (Fig. 2). Among the four prophages, one (SFBMP01) is apparently intact, whereas the others (SFBMP02~SFBMP04) are highly degraded phage remnants and SFBMP02 is similar to a part of SFBMP01 (Supplementary Fig. S1). The presence of multiple prophages suggests that phages are the main driving force for horizontal gene transfer between SFBs and other microbes. Frequent exposure to invading foreign DNAs is also suggested by the presence of three loci of clustered, regularly interspaced and short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) in the SFB genome (Supplementary Fig. S1). CRISPRs are involved in a recently discovered microbial adaptive immunity system that protects microbial cells from invading foreign genetic elements, such as bacteriophages and conjugative plasmids.24,25 CRISPR loci typically consist of several non-contiguous direct repeats separated by stretches of variable sequences called spacers, which correspond to segments of captured phage and plasmid sequences. The CRISPR sequences thus provide an adaptive, heritable record of past infections and express small RNAs that target invading nucleic acids. One of the CRISPR loci in the SFB genome (CRISPR3) contains 13 spacer-repeat units, which are preceded by a gene cluster encoding six CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins. Interestingly, the other two loci (each contains three and four spacer-repeat units, respectively) are located on prophage SFBMP01. Neither is associated with cas genes, but they share the same 160-bp leader sequence and 32-bp repeat sequences with CRISPR3, suggesting that the precursor RNAs derived from these prophage-encoded CRISPRs may also be matured to short CRISPR RNAs by the CRISPR3-associated Cas proteins. Prophage-encoded CRISPRs were previously described in C. difficille.26 Any spacer sequences found in the three CRISPR loci of SFBs showed no significant homology to the sequences in databases.3.3. The phylogenetic position of SFBsIn our initial BLAST analysis against the RefSeq database, 66.2% of the SFB CDSs had best-hit homologues of the order Clostridiales but with relatively low levels of sequence identity (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table S1). These results are consistent with the phylogenetic position of SFBs previously inferred by 16S rRNA sequence analysis; SFBs belong to a distinct lineage within the Clostridium subphylum at the rank of genus, whose proposed genus name was Candidatus Arthromitus (Fig. 3A).27 We further confirmed this phylogenetic position by constructing a genomic phylogenetic tree based on the sequences of 31 universal genes28 from fully sequenced species belonging to the order Clostridiales (Fig. 3B).

Phylogenetic trees constructed based on the 16S rDNA sequences (A) and the concatenated sequences of 31 universal genes28 (B) are shown.The phylogenetic position of SFBs among the fully sequenced Clostridium species. Phylogenetic trees constructed based on the 16S rDNA sequences (A) and the concatenated sequences of 31 universal genes28 (B) are shown.3.4. Comparative genomicsBecause no closely related species has yet been sequenced, we chose CD and CN for genomic comparison because both are gut-associated clostridia and they have the largest or smallest genome among the fully sequenced Clostridiales (4.3 and 2.5 Mb, respectively).26,29 Based on the orthologous gene group classification of CD and CN genes in the MBGD database (http://mbgd.genome.ad.jp/), in which 3741 CDSs of CD were grouped into 2851 CDSs (or CDS groups) and 2315 CDSs of CN were grouped into 2129 CDSs (or CDS groups), we compared the gene content of SFBs with these two gut-associated clostridia via an all-to-all BLAST analysis. The results revealed that 940 and 890 of the SFB CDSs (or CDSs groups) are conserved in CD and CN, respectively; 756 are conserved in both strains, whereas 425 are unique to SFB (Fig. 4A). Most of the unique genes are of unknown function. More importantly, we identified 577 CDSs that are shared by CD and CN but not SFB. The distribution of the 577 CDSs into the functional categories of the clusters of orthologous groups (COGs) of proteins indicates that, in comparison to CD and CN, the SFB lacks remarkable numbers of genes involved in the following processes: ‘energy production and conversion (C in Fig. 4B)’, ‘amino acid transport and metabolism (E)’, ‘nucleotide transport and metabolism (F)’ and ‘coenzyme metabolism (H)’. Significant portions of the CD/CN shared genes that are related to ‘carbohydrate transport and metabolism (G)’, ‘transcription (K)’ and ‘inorganic ion transport and metabolism (P)’ are also absent in SFBs. These results and the smaller genome size of SFBs suggest that during its strict niche specialization, genome reduction has taken place and many metabolic functions have been lost (see below).

Metabolic capabilitiesConsistent with the prediction that SFBs are strict anaerobes, no CDS for tricarboxylic acid cycle- or respiratory chain-related proteins were identified, whereas the SFB contains two catalases and one peroxidase. They may confer some level of oxygen tolerance, which is required for the SFB to pursue an epicellular life on intestinal epithelia where a microaerobic environment is formed. However, SFBs contain a complete enzyme set for the glycolytic pathway from glucose to pyruvate (Supplementary Fig. S2A). SFBs can further metabolize pyruvate using the pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase–hydrogenase system to produce acetate or ethanol but not butyrate and butanol. Pyruvate can also be metabolized to lactate. These are the primary energy production pathways for the SFB, like many other clostridia.30 Furthermore, SFBs possess a D-ribose ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, ribokinase and transketolase and can, therefore, uptake extracellular ribose and metabolize it to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, an intermediate of the glycolytic pathway. Although the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is conserved, components for the de novo synthesis of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides from phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) are missing. Thus, it is not likely that the PPP of SFBs is involved in nucleotide biosynthesis.A more striking metabolic feature of SFBs is the almost complete lack of de novo biosynthesis pathways for amino acids, vitamins/cofactors and nucleotides (Table 2). As for amino acid biosynthesis, we identified only 20 genes related to this function. Genes for lysine biosynthesis are relatively well conserved, but they probably just function to synthesize diaminopimeric acid as a component of peptidoglycan. Similarly, SFBs possess only 14 genes for vitamin and cofactor biosynthesis, and almost all the genes required for the biosynthesis of thiamin, riboflavin, pyridoxine, nicotinamide, pantothenate, coenzyme A, biotin, folate and vitamin B12 are absent. As mentioned above, SFBs are unable to synthesize purines and pyrimidines from PRPP. In addition, key enzymes for nucleotide interconversion, such as thymidylate synthase and guanine monophosphate reductase, are also absent in the SFB. Gene repertoires for amino acid and vitamin/cofactor biosynthesis in C. difficile (CD), C. novyi (CN) and SFBGene repertoires for amino acid and vitamin/cofactor biosynthesis in C. difficile (CD), C. novyi (CN) and SFBSevere deficiency in the biosynthesis capability of amino acids, vitamins/cofactors and nucleotides suggests that SFBs uptake these compounds from extracellular environments. Consistent with this, at least 103 genes are devoted to transport functions (Supplementary Table S2). They include ABC transporter systems for oligopeptides, amino acids, sugars, phosphate, phosphonate, iron compounds and cobalt. SFBM_1365, SFBM_1366 and SFBM_1367 may constitute an energy-coupling factor transporter to uptake vitamins and cofactors,31 although the substrate-binding components therein have yet to be identified. In addition, SFBs possess nine phosphotransferase systems to uptake various simple sugars and several other types of transport systems for nucleotides, amino acids and other compounds.Although the Tat protein secretion system is not present in the SFB, the Sec system is conserved. It may be noteworthy that, among the eight glycosyl hydrolases of SFBs (Supplementary Table S3), only SFBM_0066 was predicted as an extracellular enzyme by the PSORT program (http://psort.hgc.jp/). This suggests that SFBs have a very limited ability to digest food- or host-derived polysaccharides by themselves and, instead, primarily uptake simple sugars present in ready-for-use states in food or provided by the host or other gut bacteria. In contrast, 41 protease/peptidases are encoded by SFB. Of these, 4 are extracellular enzymes and 20 are membrane-associated (Supplementary Table S3). In SFBs, it is very likely that these enzymes, together with transporters for oligopeptides and amino acids, contribute to the acquisition of amino acids derived from external polypeptides. Similarly, two extracellular nucleases (SFBM_0242 and SFBM_0633) probably contribute to nucleotide acquisition from external sources.In summary, SFB growth heavily relies on the uptake of essential compounds from extracellular environments, some of which may be supplied by host cells that SFB tightly attaches to. These metabolic features form the basis of the non-culturability of SFBs in vitro and would be valuable information for developing culture media and protocols for the SFB.3.6. Sporulation and germinationDuring the epicellular parasitic phase, SFB probably obtain various nutritional components via intimate interactions with host cells; however, once they are detached from the host cells or SFB-attached host cells slough off in the process of epithelial cell turnover, such nutrition supply from the host cells would be shutdown, which probably induces the sporulation process in the SFB. We identified 66 genes related to sporulation or germination in the SFB, which are dispersed throughout the chromosome (Supplementary Table S4). They include key proteins for the sporulation signalling cascade, such as sporulation sigma factors, and other stage-specific sporulation proteins (Supplementary Fig. S2B); however, in common with other sequenced clostridia, SFBs lack several proteins that have been shown in B. subtilis to be involved in the phosphorelays that trigger sporulation, such as Spo0F, Spo0B and the Kin proteins.32,33 In B. subtilis, all the five sensor histidine kinases (KinA to KinE) are orphan kinases. Among the 10 sensor kinases identified in the SFB (Supplementary Table S5), SFBM_0504 is the sole orphan kinase and has a PAS domain-like domain, like the B. subtilis KinA protein32 and, thus, could be a candidate sensor kinase for sporulation initiation.Key elements in the germination process involve germinant receptors that sense appropriate germinants, such as specific amino acids, to trigger germination. The GerA family of germinant receptors are encoded by tricistronic ger operons,34 and bacilli and clostridia often contain multiple ger operons to sense different germinants. For example, CN and C. botulinum (CB) possess two and three operons, respectively (Fig. 5), although the ger operon was not identified in the CD genome.26 In SFBs, we identified only one ger operon (Fig. 5), indicating that SFBs can sense limited types of germinants. A comparison of the analogous ger operon loci between SFB, CN and CB have revealed that, although many genes downstream of the ger operon are missing in the SFB, the overall genetic organization of this locus is conserved. Comparison of the SFB ger operon locus with C. novyi (CN) and C. botulinum (CB). SFB contains a single ger operon encoding a germinant receptor, whereas CN and CB possess two and three ger operons, respectively. Among these, only the loci analogous to that of SFBs are shown. The genes conserved in the three species are depicted by blue arrows, those conserved in the CN and CB but not in SFB by green and those unique to each species by white. Regions missing in each genome are indicated by a dotted line.Comparison of the SFB ger operon locus with C. novyi (CN) and C. botulinum (CB).

The genes conserved in the three species are depicted by blue arrows, those conserved in the CN and CB but not in SFB by green and those unique to each species by white. Regions missing in each genome are indicated by a dotted line.As shown in Fig. 5, the ispE and cphAB genes are located just upstream of the ger operon in the SFB. The presence of these genes may be noteworthy in terms of the metabolism of SFBs. The ispE gene encodes 4-(cytidine-5'-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-d-erythritol kinase, a component of the methyl-erythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway to synthesize terpenoids that are essential for membrane and peptidoglycan biogenesis. Because other components for the pathway were also identified (Supplementary Fig. S2C), the MEP pathway is completely conserved in the SFB. The cphAB genes encode cyanophycin synthase and cyanophycinase (Fig. 5). Cyanophycin is a prokaryote-specific copolymer of aspartate and arginine, which has been shown in many cyanobacteria to serve as a storage compound for nitrogen, carbon and energy.35 The presence of the cphAB and isoaspartyl dipeptidase (SFBM_1358) genes suggests that SFBs can synthesize cyanophycin and may utilize it as an amino acid pool in the germination process. In a previous analysis of 570 microbial genomes, it was predicted that only 24 strains, which include several clostridia (C. beijerinckii, C. botulinum, C. perfringens and C. thermocellum), can synthesize cyanopycin.363.7. Chemotaxis and flagella-mediated motilitySFBs possess a full set of genes for the chemotaxis and flagella-mediated motility system. These genes are separately located in five genomic loci (Locus-1 to Locus-5; Fig. 6A and Supplementary Table S4). In addition, two methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (receptors for attractants) are encoded in other loci (SFBM_0442 and SFBM_1032). Flagellated SFB cells were not observed in our electron microscopic examination of SFB-monoassociated gnotobiotic mice (from 3 days to 2 weeks after oral inoculation) as well as in previous examinations.13,37,38 Thus, it is possible that in SFBs, the system has been inactivated or is used for some other purposes, such as a type III secretion system (flagella type); however, the presence of a complete set for chemotaxis genes and four flagellin genes and the absence of recognizable pseudogenes in the gene set (except for one flagellin gene; see below) strongly suggest that SFBs possess an active chemotaxis and flagella-mediated motility system. This information provides us a previously unknown aspect of SFB biology and life cycle. It is unknown at which life cycle stage SFBs produce flagella, but the most plausible scenario may be that after germination, SFBs swim in the intestine, by sensing some chemoattractant(s), to the distal parts of the small intestine where they colonize. In this regard, it is worth mentioning that SFBs contain only two methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (SFBM_0442 is probably the intracellular type). This may suggest that SFBs can sense very limited types of attractants.

Results are presented as fold-increase relative to the control value.3.8. Multiple flagellins and immunostimulation activityA unique feature of the SFB flagella system is the presence of four types of flagellins (FliC1 to FliC4). Of these, FliC3 and FliC4 are encoded in tandem in Locus-1 (Fig. 6A) and show a high sequence similarity (82.3% identity). All contain conserved N- and C-terminal flagellin domains, but FliC1 lacks a variable region between the N- and the C-terminal domains.Flagellins are recognized by TLR5 as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and induce cytokine production to activate the host innate immune system.39 TLR5 is highly expressed in LP in the small intestine, wherein dendritic cells are the dominant antigen-presenting cells and only CD11chiCD11bhi LPDCs express TLR5.40–42 These flagellin-exposed LPDCs produce IL-6 and IL-12, which results in the generation of IgA+ plasma cells and polarization towards the Th17 and Th1 functions.42 Therefore, the identified flagellins could be the key molecules responsible for the unique immunostimulation activity of SFBs. To test this presumption, we prepared recombinant proteins for each type of the SFB flagellins and examined whether they could activate the TLR5-linked NF-<U+03BA>B signalling pathway. As shown in Fig. 6B, although FliC1 was unable to activate the pathway, the other three activated it like that achieved by Salmonella flagellin. These results indicate that the immunostimulation activity of SFBs is attributable to the FliC2, FliC3 and FliC4 flagellins, although other molecules, such as cyanophycin and sporulation-related byproducts, may also be involved.The tight association of SFBs to Peyer's patches, which could make LPDCs more easily accessible to SFB-derived PAMPs, may also directly or indirectly contribute to innate immunity activation. In this regard, the presence of a fibronectin-binding protein (SFBM_0986) and a phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC; SFBM_0755) is noteworthy. The elevation of intracellular free calcium levels induced by PI-PLC from various pathogens plays key roles in various processes of microbe–host cell interaction, such as bacterial internalization and host cell actin rearrangement.43,44 Therefore, SFB PI-PLC may also be involved in the formation of dense aggregates consisting of actin-like microfibrils beneath the host cell membrane where the SFB attached.13 Other unidentified factors are also probably required for the intimate binding of SFBs to host epithelial cells, and many of such factors may be encoded by SFB-specific genes, most of which are of unknown function (Fig. 4).3.9. Human SFB-related sequences in the human gut metagenome sequence dataSFBs have also been found in humans, but SFBs are known to have strict host specificities and the SFB from a different host species may represent a different species.13,14 The availability of the mouse SFB genome sequence provided us a first opportunity to search for human SFB-related sequences in the large data set of the human gut metagenome sequences.11 By searching 7 345 361 234 high-quality Illumina sequences in the data set, we identified 277 reads that are highly homologous to the mouse SFB sequence (sequence identity; =95%, alignment length; =95% of the read, excluded reads related to rRNA and tRNA sequences) (Supplementary Table S6). Only a small number of reads corresponding to 0.31% of the mouse SFB genome were identified. This may be because non-mapped regions exhibit significant sequence divergence between mouse and human SFB (our search was conservative) or, more likely, because the currently available metagenome sequence data set does not include samples from children at weaning periods. In mice, SFBs become prevalent at this age. Thus, the metagenome sequence data from such children would be required to obtain more genomic sequence information on human SFB.4. ConclusionThe whole-genome sequence of mouse SFBs revealed that this unique gut microbe has a very limited range of metabolic capabilities similar to those of obligate intracellular parasites. In particular, SFBs lack nearly all de novo biosynthesis pathways for amino acids, vitamins and cofactors and nucleotides. These features well explain the non-culturability of SFBs and further suggest that they acquire these compounds, probably from the host intestinal epithelia to which SFBs are tightly attached, via well-conserved transport systems. In addition to a full set of genes for sporulation and germination, SFBs possess a chemotaxis and flagella-based motility system. This finding suggests a triphasic lifestyle of SFBs that comprises swimming, epicellular and dormant (spore) phases. Moreover, SFBs encode four different types of flagellins, and three of these are capable of activating the TLR5-linked NF-<U+03BA>B signalling pathway, which could promote the luminal IgA production and the induction of particular T helper cell subclasses (Th1 and Th17). Thus, SFB genome sequence determination discloses the genetic basis for their non-culturability, which could help us to develop SFB-specific cultivation techniques. In addition, it reveals a previously unknown lifestyle including a flagellated swimming phase, and it provides a first glimpse into understanding the molecular basis for SFB-induced immunostimulation. Furthermore, through a systematic search of the human gut metagenome sequence database, the first pieces of the genomic information on human-associated SFB were obtained.Supplemental dataSupplemental data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by grants-in-aid for Scientific Researches (C) and (B) (to T.K. and T.H., respectively), for Young Scientists (B) (to H.N-I.) and for Scientific Research on Priority Areas ‘Applied Genomics’ (to T.H.) and ‘Comprehensive Genomics’ (to M.H.) from the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology of Japan and by that from the Institute for Bioinformatics Research and Development, the Japan Science and Technology Agency (BIRD-JST) (to K.K.).We thank Drs K.

Analysis of allelic diversity in 24 B. rapa germplasm using 234 mapped EST-SSR markers showed amplification of 2 alleles by majority of EST-SSRs, although amplification of alleles ranging from 2 to 8 was found. Transferability analysis of 167 EST-SSRs in 35 species belonging to cultivated and wild brassica relatives showed 42.51% (Sysimprium leteum) to 100% (B. carinata, B. juncea, and B. napus) amplification. Our newly developed EST-SSRs and high-density linkage map based on highly transferable genic markers would facilitate the molecular mapping of quantitative trait loci and the positional cloning of specific genes, in addition to marker-assisted selection and comparative genomic studies of B. rapa with other related species.1. IntroductionBrassica rapa (AA, 2n = 20) is an important diploid Brassica crop mainly grown for as a vegetable foodstuff, and to some extent for producing oilseed and fodder crops. Among the six cultivated Brassica species [the other five are the two diploids Brassica nigra (BB, n = 8) and B. oleracea (CC, n = 9) and the three amphidiploids B. juncea (AABB, n = 18), B. carinata (BBCC, n = 17), and B. napus (AACC, n = 19)], B. rapa has a comparatively small genome size (529 Mb), and has the second largest morphological and genetic diversity after B. oleracea. It is also one of the progenitor parents which contributed the A genome to the widely cultivated amphidiploid oilseed crops B. juncea and B. napus, as beautifully shown by U's triangle.1During the last two decades, several genetic maps with conventional anonymous molecular markers, such as amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs), restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs), and genomic simple sequence repeats (SSRs), have been constructed in Brassica species, including B. rapa.2–7 These maps have been used to map, tag, and clone genetic loci [genes and/or quantitative trait loci (QTL)] that are associated with economically important traits, such as leaf traits, glucosinolates, seed coat colour, and other important agronomic traits.3,8–14 Further, the construction of a detailed genetic map helped to study comparative genome organization, evolution, and conservation among the Brassica species and with Arabidopsis thaliana, the closest related model plant to the Brassicaceae family.4,6 Comparative mapping between B. rapa and A. thaliana was used to identify and clone candidate genes at the QTL regions for flowering time,13,15 leaf hairiness,13 and other traits.14However, a detailed high-density integrated genetic map combining many genetic maps developed from different populations and marker types has not been generated for B. rapa. The importance of high-density genetic maps in the understanding of genome organization, evolution, and the mapping and tagging of important QTL for molecular breeding and map-based cloning of economically important trait-related genes has created widespread interest for their development in many crop plants.16–22 Further, previously developed conventional markers are anonymous, laborious to genotype (e.g. AFLPs and RFLPs), less reproducible (e.g. random amplification of polymorphic DNA, RAPD), require more time for development (e.g. genomic SSRs), and, more importantly, are less transferable between species. Due to these disadvantages, these conventional markers are being replaced by SSRs or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) isolated from transcribed regions [such as complementary DNA, messenger RNA, and expressed sequence tags (ESTs)]. Recent advances in plant functional genomics projects are producing enormous amounts of ESTs which have been deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database. These sequences from transcribed genes are assembled into unique gene sequences and used to design SSRs from genes with a unique identity and position in the genome.23–25 The co-dominant, multi-allelic, and high reproducibility nature besides amenable for high throughput marker analysis led to the rapid and economical expressed sequence tag-derived simple sequence repeat markers (EST-SSRs) development in several plant species since a large number of SSRs are found in coding regions.22–24,26–32Although the draft genome sequence of the euchromatic regions of B. rapa is expected to become available soon from the Multinational Brassica rapa Genome Sequencing Project (MBrGSP), the development and mapping of more uniformly spaced high-density genic markers, such as unigene-derived microsatellites (UGMS) and intron polymorphic (IP) markers along with bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-derived SSRs, would facilitate the mapping of important traits and their utilization in molecular breeding. In addition, a high-density map of anonymous and genic markers would help in the correct alignment of gene-rich euchromatic and repetitive heterochromatic sequences in the B. rapa genome because the soon-to-be released draft B. rapa genome sequence covers only 384 Mb of the 529 Mb Brassica A genome (personal communication from MBrGSP).In B. rapa, Parida et al.24 recently developed 347 unigene-derived SSR markers, suggesting that there are many more unidentified genic SSRs that would allow for the complete coverage of the B. rapa genome. This would help uniformly select genic SSR markers covering the total genome and facilitate the mapping, tagging, and identification of economically important genetic loci. Further, uniformly distributed markers would be useful for comparative mapping and evolutionary studies with other closely related Brassica species. Hence, the objectives of this study were to develop more EST-SSR markers, map the newly developed EST-SSRs along with the previously mapped BAC-derived SSRs, IP markers, and publicly available SSR markers into the Brassica rapa genome to construct a high-density gene-based updated integrated map, and transferability analysis of the mapped EST-SSRs markers in other Brassica relatives so that these markers could be used for comparative mapping between them.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materialsWe used four B. rapa mapping populations to develop an integrated linkage map: CKDH, CRF2, PF2, and CSKF2. The CKDH population consisted of 78 double haploid lines derived from a cross between ‘Chiifu-401’ and ‘Kenshin’, which were earlier used to construct a reference genetic linkage map of B. rapa.5,7,33 The CRF2 population consisted of 190 F2 individuals derived from crossing the ‘Chiifu-401’ and ‘Rapid cycling B. rapa (RCBr)’ parental lines, and was previously used by Li et al.33 to construct a linkage map. The CSKF2 population consisted of 94 individual lines derived from crossing between the clubroot resistance cultivar ‘CR Shinki’ and a susceptible cultivar ‘94SK’. The fourth population, PF2, consisted of 144 F2 populations that were derived from crossing the diverse Chinese cabbage inbred lines ‘501’ with a large head and ‘601’ with a small head. In order to detect the polymorphic level and allelic frequencies of the newly mapped EST-SSRs, we selected 24 different B. rapa cultivars belonging to different sub-species and morphophytes which included Chinese cabbage, pak choi, and oil yielding types from the Korea Brassica Genome Resource Bank (Table 1, serial number 1–24). Different Brassica species and wild relatives collected from Centre for Genetic Manipulation of Crop Plants, Delhi University South Campus, India; Korea Brassica Genome Research Bank, Korea; and Leibniz institute of Plant Genetics and Crop Plant Research, Gatersleben, Germany were used for marker transferability analysis (Table 1).

Searching for SSR-containing sequences and primer designWe downloaded a total of 182 703 B. rapa EST sequences from NCBI database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and assembled using CAP334 to identify unigenes. The unigene sequences (singlets and contigs) were then searched for the presence of SSR motifs using the MIcro SAtellite identification tool (MISA) available at http://pgrc.ipk-gatersleben.de/misa/misa.html and sputnik software following the criteria described earlier by Hong et al.35 The contig or singleton sequences were used to design primers flanking the putative SSRs using Primer 3.36 The primer designing conditions were: 58–60°C melting temperature with a difference of only 1°C between each forward and reverse primer, 40–60% GC content, and 19–21 bp primer length and an estimated amplicon size of 150–400 bp. ORF Finder37 (http://bioinformatics.org/sms/orf_find.html) and UTRScan (http://utrdb.ba.itb.cnr.it/tool/utrscan) were used to find the location of repeat motifs in coding region and untranslated regions (5'UTR and 3'TR) or in open reading frames.2.3. DNA extraction, marker analysis, and cloning of PCR ampliconDNA was extracted from young expanded leaf samples collected from greenhouse-grown plants using an RBC Genomic DNA Extraction Kit (Real Biotech Corporation, Taipei, Taiwan). A total of 707 newly developed UGMS markers (prefixed by ACMP, hereafter referred to as EST-SSRs, Supplementary Table S1) were used for a polymorphism survey between the parental lines Chiifu-401, Kenshin, and RCBr. A total of 999 BAC-derived SSRs, which were previously developed in our laboratory (designated by ‘cnu’, ‘nia’, and ‘BRPGM’),7,33 272 IP markers developed and mapped by Panjabi et al.,6 and 707 new EST-SSRs were screened between CR Shinki and 94SK. In another experiment, a total of 450 newly developed unigene-derived SSR markers (prefixed by ‘sau_um’, unpublished), which were developed in Shenyang Agricultural University, and 651 public SSR markers5,38–47 were screened for polymorphisms between the parental lines ‘501’ and ‘601’ of the PF2 population. The PCR reaction conditions used by Li et al.33 were followed for the BAC-derived SSRs, IP markers, and the newly developed EST-SSRs. The PCR conditions for the EST-derived SSR markers were as follows: 5 min at 95°C; 36 cycles of 45 s at 95°C, 45 s at 55°C, and 45 s at 72°C; with a final step of 10 min at 72°C. PCR products were resolved in 8% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described by Kim et al.7 The PCR amplicon from different species was cloned in pGEM-T Easy cloning vector (www.promega.com) according to the manufacturer's instruction and at least one clone were sequenced two times from each Brassica species.2.4. Construction of linkage maps and diversity analysisThe four individual maps and the integrated genetic map were constructed with Joinmap version 4.048,49 using the same parameters as described by Li et al.33 The Kosambi mapping function was used to calculate map distances.50 Logarithm of the odds (LOD) scores of 4.0–8.0 was used to group markers. A recombination frequency <0.4 and a LOD score >1.0 were used to arrange the marker order. Common markers were used as ‘bridge’ markers to integrate the four maps using the function ‘Combine the Groups for Map Integration’. We used two approaches to integrate the four maps: first, we used the CKDH map as the reference map and sequentially integrated the other three maps in the order CRF2, PF2, and CSKF2; and secondly by simultaneously integrating the four maps to identify consistency. The final integrated linkage map was drawn using MapChart.51 Power Marker 3.1 was used to calculate the polymorphic information content (PIC) value and gene diversity. The PIC value was estimated according to the method of Botstein et al.52 The crucifer building blocks proposed by Schranz et al.53 were identified in B. rapa genetic map based on homology search of primers pairs against the Arabidopsis genome sequence as described previously by Kim et al.73. Results3.1. Development of UGMS markersWe downloaded a total of 182 703 B. rapa EST sequences from NCBI database in April 2010 and alignment of these EST sequences gave 19 497 (18 931 contigs and 566 singlets) unigenes. Analyses in these unigenes identified 4174 microsatellite motifs in 3037 genes. Of these many unigenes containing one or more SSRs, we designed a total of 707 EST-SSR markers (Supplementary Table S1). Among the primer pairs designed, trinucleotide repeats were the highest (573, 81.05%) followed by di- (126, 17.82%) and tetranucleotide repeats (8, 1.13%), respectively (Table 2). Analysis of the location of the 707 SSR motifs in the sequence used to design primers showed that majority of them was located in the coding region (CDS, 491) compared to 5'UTR (107) and 3'UTR (109) (Supplementary Table S1). Of the 707 EST-SSR primer pairs, 691 (97.74%) produced repeatable and reliable amplifications of expected size in at least one line of the five B. rapa parental lines (Chiifu 401, Kenshin, Rapid cycling B. rapa, 94 SK and CR Shiki) screened, while 16 (2.26%) primer pairs either completely failed or led to weak amplifications and thus were excluded from further analysis.

Construction of individual mapsThe CKDH linkage map was adopted as the reference genetic linkage map by the MBrGSP. The version I CKDH reference genetic map of B. rapa was constructed by Choi et al.,5 while Kim et al.7 generated version II by incorporating more BAC-anchored SSRs, and this was further updated with the inclusion of 95 gene-based IP markers by Li et al.33 We screened 707 newly developed EST-SSR markers (prefix ACMP) for polymorphisms between the parental lines of the CKDH mapping population, Chiifu-401 and Kenshin, in the present study. However, only 99 (14%) of these markers were polymorphic between the 2 parental lines, and finally 95 EST-SSR markers were mapped to the 10 linkage groups of B. rapa. These 95 EST-SSR markers were distributed in all of the 10 B. rapa linkage groups, except in A2, and the number of markers ranged from 4 in A10 to 19 in A5. After adding the new EST-SSR markers, most of the previous markers were assigned in the same order without any major changes with respect to their position. The total length of the updated CKDH map was 1217.6 cM, which is 42.5 cM larger than the earlier map (1175.1 cM; Li et al.33). The linkage groups A3 (145.8 cM) and A6 (165.2 cM) increased by 10 cM compared to the map of Li et al.33 because of the addition of new EST markers. The average distance between adjacent markers decreased from 1.45 to 1.34 cM. The updated EST-SSRs CKDH map consisted of a total of 907 markers with 190 BAC-derived SSRs, 95 new EST-derived SSRs, 94 IP markers, and 528 other markers (Choi et al.,5 Table 2, Supplementary Table S2).The CRF2 map was initially developed by Li et al.33 using BAC-derived SSR and IP markers. Of the 707 EST-SSRs screened for polymorphisms between the parental lines, Chiifu-401 and RCBr, we identified 144 pairs of polymorphic EST-SSRs, of which only 142 pairs could be used for genotyping and the construction of the linkage map. After excluding the distorted and ungrouped markers, a total of 129 new EST-SSRs were successfully integrated into the 10 linkage groups of B. rapa, giving a total length of 1119.5 cM. The distribution of the newly mapped EST-SSRs varied from 7 in linkage group A10 to 19 in A3. Compared to the previous CRF2 map,33 most of the BAC-SSRs and IP markers remained in the same order; however, two SSR loci and one IP locus in linkage group A4, one IP locus in A5, and one SSR locus in A9, all distorted markers, were deleted from the map as they reshuffled the marker order in these two linkage groups. The updated CRF2 linkage map now contains a total of 444 markers with 129 new EST-SSRs, 249 BAC-derived SSRs, and 66 IP loci (Supplementary Table S3). The length of the individual linkage groups ranged from 79.9 cM in A06 to 170.1 cM in A9. Although the total length of the genetic map did not significantly increase compared to the previous CRF2 map,33 the average distance between adjacent markers decreased from 3.47 to 2.53 cM.The new CSKF2 population was developed by crossing the clubroot resistant cultivar CR Shinki and the susceptible 94SK line. For the construction of the genetic linkage map, we screened SSRs and IP markers for polymorphisms between the parental lines. Of the 707 EST-SSRs, 250 BRPGM-SSRs, 50 cnu_SSRs, 30 nia_SSRs, and 272 IP markers screened between the parental lines, and only 99 EST-SSRs, 28 BRPGM-SSRs, 19 cnu_SSRs, 6 nia_SSRs, and 19 IP makers were polymorphic. All markers, except the EST-SSRs, were previously described and some of them have already been mapped in the B. rapa genome.7,33 The previously mapped markers enabled us to align and integrate the different maps in the present study. We used the genotype data from a total of 173 markers to construct the linkage map, although only 161 markers [93 EST-SSR, 49 BAC-SSR, 17 IP, and 2 sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) markers] could be grouped and assigned to the 10 linkage groups, covering 602.3 cM of the B. rapa genome (Supplementary Table S4). The number of markers in each linkage group ranged from 7 in A1 to 33 in A3, with an average distance of 3.74 cM between adjacent markers.The PF2 genetic map was constructed using 144 F2 lines derived from crossing between two diverse Chinese cabbage inbred lines, 501 with a large head and 601 with a small head, at Shenyang Agricultural University, China. This genetic map of B. rapa contains a total of 277 markers (72 EST-SSR loci, 154 genomic SSRs, and 1 leaf hairiness phenotypic marker) in the 10 linkage groups with total genome coverage of 908.4 cM. The average distance between adjacent markers was 4.02 cM (Supplementary Tables S1 and Table S5) and the shortest and longest linkage groups were A8 (74.9 cM) and A9 (122.0 cM).3.3. Construction of the updated consensus genetic map of B. rapaThe four individual maps were integrated using the commonly mapped markers as bridge markers. In total, 241 bridge markers (including 66 EST-SSRs) were identified among at least two of the mapping populations. The distribution of bridge markers was 22 in A1, 12 in A2, 38 in A3, 13 in A4, 37 in A5, 19 in A6, 25 in A7, 17 in A8, 42 in A9, and 16 in A10, respectively. SSR and IP markers with more than one polymorphic locus in the same linkage groups were correctly identified for size and order before designating the common loci between the maps. A total of 1426 markers were mapped on the 10 linkage groups of B. rapa. The number of markers in the integrated map ranged from 97 markers in linkage group A2 to 209 markers in A3, and the length of the linkage groups varied from 95.5 cM in A10 to 160.0 cM in A9. The total length of the integrated consensus map was 1245.9 cM, with an average distance between adjacent markers of 0.87 cM (Table 3 and Fig. 1). The comparison of the four individual maps and the integrated map revealed a similar order of the markers, even though changes of order and the position of a few markers were observed within a 5 cM distance in some of the linkage groups, with the exception of five linkage groups (A3, A5, A7, A9, and A10) where an inversion of more than 10 cM was observed. The integrated map contained 306 new EST-derived SSR markers (prefixed by ACMP and sau-um), 395 BAC-derived SSRs, 153 IP markers, and 572 other markers (Table 3 and Fig. 1). The number of EST-derived SSRs mapped in the 10 linkage groups of B. rapa ranged from 16 in linkage group A2 to 50 in A3. The density of the updated EST-SSR-rich integrated map increased compared to the previously integrated CKDH and CRF2 maps by Li et al.33 since the average distance between marker loci decreased from 1.24 to 0.87 cM. The length of the integrated linkage groups was similar to the corresponding longest linkage groups of the component maps with a slight increase in map length, except for the linkage groups A1, A6, A8, and A10 where decreases of approximately 20, 13.1, 8.4, and 10 cM, respectively, were observed in comparison to the maximum lengths of the individual maps. The EST-SSR marker ACMP00682, which mapped to the top portion of the A08 linkage group, increased the map length by 4.8 cM. The large gaps observed in individual maps were reduced due to the increased marker density, and the final consensus integrated map had only one large gap (>10 cM) in the A2 linkage group.

Identification of crucifer building blocksWith the addition of more markers, we could accurately resolve the B. rapa genome for collinearity blocks with A. thaliana chromosomes.53 Blast analysis of B. rapa BAC and EST sequences, wherefrom the SSRs were identified, helped to identify homologous Arabidopsis chromosomal blocks which, in turn, helped to identify conserved ancestral crucifer building blocks in the B. rapa genome (Fig. 1).53 We could confidently establish homologous blocks that were previously identified with slightly less stringent criteria due to low marker density,33 such as W and E blocks in linkage group A2, the B and C blocks in A5, the Q block in A6, the T block in A8, and the W block in A10. Furthermore, as the blocks were already identified in the corresponding homologous A genome chromosomes of B. juncea and B. napus, we could identify new blocks containing mostly one marker in the B. rapa A genome, and these could be regarded as probable blocks since the available evidence supports the highly conserved nature of the A chromosomes at gross level among the three species, despite their divergence a long time ago.4,6 The new probable conserved blocks identified in this study are the M block in linkage group A1, the V block in A2, the X block in A6 and A9, and the I block in A7 (Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. S1). However, further addition of markers is necessary to accurately resolve these blocks, even though we used already established evidence from the corresponding A genome chromosome blocks in B. napus and B. juncea while considering these blocks.3.5. Evaluation of the mapped EST-derived SSR markers for allelic diversityWe selected 238 EST-SSRs (234 ACMP and 4 sau-um) that mapped to different B. rapa linkage groups to study their allelic diversity in 24 B. rapa genotypes belonging to the sub-species oleifera (oil type), pekinensis (Chinese cabbage), and chinensis (Pakchoi) type. Brassica rapa plants belonging to these sub-species are morphologically different with respect to leaf types, heading habits, and overall plant morphology. The PCR successfully amplified all of the 238 EST-SSRs markers in the 24 B. rapa genomes. The number of alleles amplified per EST-SSR ranged from 2 to 8, with an average of 2.9 (Fig. 2, Table 4). The majority of SSRs consisted of two alleles. The PIC value, which is a measure of allelic diversity, varied from 0.08 to  0.65, with an average of 0.40. The most commonly observed PIC values were between 0.4 and 0.5 (Table 4). The highest average PIC value was detected in the linkage group A1 (0.45) and the lowest one was in A9 (0.36).

Transferability of EST-SSRs in other cultivated and wild Brassica relativesTo assess the utility of EST-SSR loci across other cultivated and wild relatives of Brassica species, 167 EST-SSRs (146 EST-SSRs mapped and 21 EST-SSRs that were not mapped in the 10 linkage groups of B. rapa) (Supplementary Table S6) were used to amplify 48 germplasm belonging to 35 species of Brassicaceae family which includes five genotypes from B. rapa, two each from B. oleracea, B. nigra, B. napus, B. carinata and Arabidopsis thaliana, five from B. juncea and wild relatives (Table 1 and Fig. 3). Of the 167 primer pairs used to amplify in germplasm, cultivated Brassica species other than B. rapa showing 100% amplification were B. carinata, B. juncea and B. napus. Only one primer pair was not amplified in B. oleracea, while 17 primer pairs did not amplify in B. nigra. In Arabidopsis thaliana, 52 primer pairs did not show amplification. Among the wild species under Brassica genus, highest number of transferability was found in B. incana (amplified 161 out of 167 primer pairs) followed by B. bourgeaui and B. insularis (158 amplified in both the species). Brassica balearica DNA showed lowest number of primer pair amplification suggesting less cross-species transferable among them. Among the wild relative species, Herba chichori showed the highest number of amplification (163) and the lowest number for amplification was shown by Sysimprium leteum (71 primer pairs) (Supplementary Table S6).

All species are listed in Table 1.A total of 1326 SSR alleles were scored from 167 EST-SSRs primer pairs with an average of 7.94 alleles per primer pair across all 48 genotypes representing 35 species. The primer pair of ACMP00904 produced the highest number of alleles (17 bands), while two primer pairs namely ACMP00561 and ACMP00832 produced the lowest number of alleles (three bands) among the 48 germplasm. Most of the primer pairs showed the amplification of 5–6 alleles followed by primer pairs amplifying 7–8 and 9–10 alleles, respectively. There was a wide variation among species in the average number of alleles per primer pairs.To validate the sequence level conservation of SSRs across the species, at least one amplified product of EST-SSR ACMP00321 from 31 different species were cloned and sequenced. The EST-SSR primer pair for ACMP00321 was designed flanking four tri-nucleotide repeats (GAA). Although sequence alignment showed high conservation of nucleotide sequences from 31 different species, several single nucleotide substitutions and InDel polymorphism of 3-bp to 11-bp flanking the microsatellite repeats were observed besides variation in number of repeat motifs (Supplementary Fig. S2). Variations of repeat numbers were observed from four repeats to a maximum of six repeats. Brassica barreilieri and B. bourgeaui showed six numbers of repeats, while B. creteca, B. incana, and Camelina Sativa showed five numbers of repeats. Remaining species showed conserved four repeats.4. DiscussionEST-SSRs are highly useful in molecular plant breeding and evolutionary studies since these markers are developed from transcribed region of the genes and are highly cross-species transferable. Although, recent study reported the development EST-SSR markers in B. rapa,24 the exact genomic location of the developed markers in the B. rapa genome were not determined by mapping, and there remained many more EST-SSRs to be identified owing to the large number of genes present in B. rapa genome (expected gene number is over 40 000, MBrGSP, personal communication). Therefore, in this study, we developed 707 new EST-SSRs, of which 691 (97.73%) primer pairs were successfully amplified the DNA fragments of expected sizes in the B. rapa genome. The majority of these EST-SSR markers were single locus markers, while only a few of them were duplicated and mapped to different linkage groups.The EST-SSR markers were less polymorphic than the genomic SSRs as they were derived from genic regions. Of the 707 EST-SSRs, only 99 (14%) were polymorphic between the parental lines Chiifu-401 and Kenshin, whereas 311 SSRs (41.5%) from 749 BAC-SSRs were polymorphic.7 For the CRF2 population, 20% of the EST-SSRs were polymorphic between the parental lines Chiifu-401 and RCBr, which is also lower than for genomic SSRs (67%). Similarly, reduced levels of polymorphisms were detected between CR Shinki and 94SK (14%, the parental lines of the CSKF2 population) and between 501 and 601 (15.56%, the parental lines of the PF2 population). Similar results were also reported in pearl millet30 and soybean.20 These findings indicate that the SSRs located in coding regions were relatively more conserved than those in non-coding regions. Despite showing lower levels of polymorphisms, the EST-derived SSRs have much more potential than genomic SSRs to reveal the functional variation between individuals.The updated high-density integrated map of B. rapa now contains a total of 1426 markers that include 414 new markers (306 EST-SSRs, 55 BAC-SSR, 10 IP, and 40 public SSR markers, 1 phenotypic marker, and 2 SCAR markers) and covers a total length of 1245.9 cM, which is almost similar to the earlier map (1262.0 cM; Li et al.33). We found a slight decrease in the map length due to the addition of more markers, thereby increasing the marker density from 1.27 cM in the previous map33 to 0.87 cM in the present one. The majority of the mapped EST-SSR markers were randomly distributed in the 10 linkage groups; however, a few were clustered in narrow regions of a few linkage groups, e.g. A3 (20–28 cM), A5 (59–62 cM), A8 (17–24 cM), and A10 (25–29 cM). These EST-SSR clusters may be indicative of gene-rich regions, although more gene-based markers are needed to fully characterize these regions.We compared the updated integrated map and the component maps and found the overall order and positions of the markers to be same, despite observing minor local inversions within a 5 cM distance in many linkage groups, with the exception of a few markers with longer distance inversions (in A2, A3, A4, and A9). These kinds of local inversions were reported earlier in map integration in Arabidopsis, B. oleracea, lettuce, rapeseed, and many other plant species.54–60 The various reasons cited were: (i) mapping inaccuracies resulted from small mapping populations,55 (ii) closely spaced markers in one population,21 (iii) distorted segregation of markers, and (iv) real inversions. We believe that the addition of more common markers would help solve up to certain extent the local discrepancies observed in few linkage groups due to any one or combination of above-cited reasons. However, while comparing the mapped IP markers in our map with the B. juncea map,6 we observed the overall conservation of A genome chromosomes (data not shown) between the two species, which further supports the correct alignment of our map.The addition of new BAC-SSRs, EST-SSRs, and IP markers in the updated consensus genetic map helped to confirm the accuracy of the previously identified cruciferous building blocks53 and to identify previously unidentified probable blocks33 in our linkage map by blast analysis against the A. thaliana genome sequence. We identified an additional five novel probable blocks (M in linkage group A1, V in A2, X in A6 and A9, and I in A7) compared to B. napus4 and B. juncea.6 However, additional markers are necessary to confirm these blocks since only one or a few markers were identified and the blocks were designated on the basis of the corresponding A chromosomes of B. juncea6 and B. napus.4The analysis of allelic variation of the 238 mapped EST-SSRs in 24 B. rapa germplasm belonging to the sub-species oleifera, chinensis, and pekinensis revealed that the number of alleles ranged from 2 to 8. It is known that the observation of different allele frequencies of any given marker is closely related to its transferability among germplasm, as well as to the degree of variability within the marker locus.61 However, the most frequent number of alleles amplified per EST-SSRs was 2, suggesting that these markers were probably generated by insertion–deletion polymorphisms, as previously observed in soybean.20,62 We observed that the average PIC values of the mapped markers in the 10 linkage groups of B. rapa were 0.40 (range, 0.36–0.45), similar to the PIC of 0.40 observed in soybean by Hossain et al.61 and Hisano et al.;62 furthermore, they reported that the average PIC values of EST-derived markers were lower than for random genomic DNA-derived markers because of the highly conserved nature of the coding regions. We also expect lower PIC values for the EST-SSRs used in the present study than for the random and BAC-derived SSRs, even though we did not examine their PIC values, as the BAC-SSRs were more polymorphic than the EST-SSRs in the parental lines.The advantage of high cross-species transferability of EST-SSRs can be widely exploited in comparative mapping studies to see the conservation and diversification of gene order in the related species and isolate the candidate genes from the target species using candidate genes. Cross-species transferability experiment analysis of newly developed EST-SSRs in 35 other cultivated and wild Brassica relatives showed varying number of amplification of EST-SSRs ranging from 100% in B. napus, B. juncea, and B. carinata to 45.50% in Sysimprium leteum. Varying rates of transferability of EST-SSR markers among related species or genera have been demonstrated in several studies.28,32 For example, all of the 61 EST-SSRs markers developed in Camellia sinensis were fully transferable to Camellia assamica and Camellia assamica ssp. Lasiocalyx, while it showed various rates of transferability to C. lutescens; C. irrawadiensis, and C. japonica.25 Raji et al.32 found cross-species amplification of 94% of cassava EST-SSRs in related wild species, while amplification of up to 100% of EST-SSRs designed in barley was observed in Hordeum chilense, and 76–100% amplification in different Triticum species.28 Further, comparison of DNA sequence from 31 species showed highly identical nature of the DNA sequences with only few SNPs and Indels among the species suggesting the highly conserved nature of the gene sequences even among the distantly related species. Although variation in repeat motifs was observed, Indels surrounding the SSR motifs were the main reason for getting sequence polymorphism between the species beside few SNPs observed throughout the sequences.The development of an updated high-density integrated B. rapa genetic linkage map based on highly cross-species transferable gene-based markers such as EST-SSRs and IP markers would allow comparative genetic analysis between B. rapa and other Brassica crops. Further, the mapping of previously developed public SSRs in our genetic map would also facilitate the identification of candidate genes through the fine mapping of candidate QTL/gene regions for important traits as our map contains BAC-SSRs, EST-SSRs, and IP markers adjacent along with those markers. These could then be used for the marker-assisted selection of economically important trait loci/QTL in the respective populations.41,43,44,47 The soon-to-be available draft genome sequence of the euchromatic regions of the B. rapa genome does not diminish the importance of genetic linkage maps, as our map will facilitate the alignment of gene-rich euchromatic regions with less gene-dense repetitive regions, thereby helping to confirm and refine the integration of the genetic map with genomic sequences. The large number of gene-based markers mapped in the present study will promote the understanding of the comparative analysis of the Brassica genome at the structural and functional levels.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by grants from the Technology Development Program for Agriculture and Forestry, Ministry for Food, Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries (grant no. 607003-05), Republic of Korea; and National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 30771468).

IntroductionThe availability of complete genomic sequences of several important grasses, including Brachypodium distachyon, rice (Oryza sativa), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), and maize (Zea mays), has provided a unique opportunity for comparative genomics studies of grass transcriptional regulatory networks controlled by sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factors (TFs) which bind to DNA and either activate or repress gene transcription.1–4 The specific interactions between TFs and their binding sites, i.e. the cis-regulatory sequences, play a central role in the regulation of different biological processes such as development, growth, cell division, and responses to environmental stimuli.5,6 Identification, characterization, and annotation of TF repertoires from different grass species will provide an insight on TF organization and biological functions of the TFs in grasses as well as their evolution. Additionally, from a biotechnology perspective, TF annotations are especially important for studying transcriptional regulatory switches involved in plant productivity, seed quality, and the sensing/response and adaptation to the environment. A great deal of evidence has demonstrated that identification and molecular tailoring of novel stress-responsive TFs have the potential to stabilize and protect crop performance under adverse conditions.7,8In plants, ~7% of all genes encodes putative TFs.9 The majority of TFs can be grouped into a number of different families according to the specific type of DNA-binding domain that is present within their sequence.5,10,11 In the past decade, the completion of various plant genome sequences and the development of high-throughput experimental techniques have enabled scientists to carry out genome-wide analyses of TF repertoires and described the function and organization of TF regulatory systems in a number of plant species.12–22Taking advantage of the available complete sequence of B. distachyon and maize, we have identified the full complements of TFs from these species using a prediction method which used 51 Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) from the Pfam database.23 We also used 11 models, which were originally created by HMMbuild of HMMER2 package, to identify the domains within the putative TF proteins. Given the importance of barley (Hordeum vulgare) and wheat (Triticum aestivum) as major cereals, their TF repertoires also deserve attention. However, currently their genome sequences have not yet been completed. We, therefore, used available full-length cDNA and coding sequence (CDS) resources (http://trifldb.psc.riken.jp) to identify all potential TFs from these two plants.24 We integrated all the TF data from these four grasses together with those from rice and sorghum to develop a knowledge integrative database, named GramineaeTFDB. This database provides open access for researchers to all relevant and basic information on functional motifs, promoter regions, available FL-cDNAs, genomic distribution, and multiple sequence alignment of the DNA-binding domains for each TF family of each grass species. In addition, we supplied hyperlinks linking TFs of maize, rice, and barley to their expression profiles documented in Genevestigator. Since most of these TFs have not been experimentally characterized for regulatory function as indicated by assessment in PubMed, we searched for their putative regulatory function by assessing annotations of the gene ontology (GO) using comparative analysis with their Arabidopsis counterparts. In addition, we also mapped all putative cis-regulatory elements on the promoter regions of all TF encoding genes using a total of 480 cis-motifs, which include 11 well-defined abiotic stress-responsive ones. In this analysis, we placed a particular emphasis on stress-responsive cis-elements. Knowledge gained from identifying the presence of stress-responsive cis-elements, in addition to GO annotation, phylogenetics-based annotation, and expression data, enables effective prediction of stress-responsive TFs. Additionally, the supplied information on Ds and FOX and T-DNA insertion lines for a number of TFs from maize and rice, respectively, which can easily identified on GramineaeTFDB, have made convenient access to novel resources for loss- and gain-of-function analyses. Taken together, our results provide comprehensive information on TFs of six major grass species as well as tools for comparative genomic analyses of large TF data sets found in the grasses and non-grass plants.2. Materials and methods2.1. Identification of TF repertoires in six grassesThe strategy and bioinformatics pipeline established previously were used to identify the complete sets of TFs from the annotated proteomes of B. distachyon (v1.0), maize (v4a.53), rice (v6.0), and sorghum (vSbi1_4), and the partial TF repertoires from barley and wheat using their FL-cDNA and CDS resources.21,24 Fifty-one HMMs of Pfam and those of 11 originally created using HMMbuild of the HMMER2 package (http://hmmer.janelia.org/) were applied, which corresponded to a total of 61 TF families because there are two HHM profiles which are completely matched.23 A pre-defined threshold of E < 1e-5 was used as the common value cut-off for HMMER search using built HMM profiles. The criteria described previously for the classification of each TF family were applied.25 Additionally, the TFs identified by initial HMMER search were subjected to a homology search (blastp) with known TFs of Arabidopsis classified previously by PlantTFDB (http://planttfdb.cbi.pku.edu.cn/) and PlnTFDB (http://plntfdb.bio.uni-potsdam.de/v3.0/) to confirm the HMMER search results based on the results of homology search (blastp E-value = 1e-30).18 TFs for which the homology search yielded results of 1e-30 < blastp E-value < 1e-5 were inspected manually to exclude false-positive hits and determine the true E-value for each family (GramineaeTFDB Help page, Statistics). For wheat and barley, we also used the NCBI UniGene sequences of wheat and barley as queries in a blastx homology search against B. distachyon protein data set with a threshold E-value < 1e-10 to identify putative TFs.2.2. Structural and functional annotations of putative grass TFsStructural and functional annotations of putative grass TFs were done as described previously.21 All of the similarity searches using blastn were performed with a threshold E-value < 1e-100, and the top scoring hit for each query was applied. All similarity searches with blastp against protein data sets were performed with a threshold E-value < 1e-5 to find possible functional descriptions for TF encoding genes. The top scoring hit for each query was applied. To determine the global characteristic features of functional categories of TF encoding genes of the grasses, the TFs were assigned to possible GO terms based on a blastp similarity search (E-value < 1e-10) using the data set of Arabidopsis of TAIR10.26 The GO annotation and TFs of Arabidopsis were retrieved from TAIR and PlnTFDB, respectively. Particular emphasis was placed on sequences serving under the ‘biological process’ functional category.2.3. Discovery of cis-regulatory motifs in promoter regions of TF genesDiscovery of cis-regulatory motifs located in the -500, -1000, and -3000 bp upstream sequences from the putative transcription start site for each TF encoding gene using 469 cis-motif sequences collected from the PLACE database (http://www.dna.affrc.go.jp/PLACE/)27 and 11 major stress-responsive cis-motifs reported previously28 was performed as described previously.21 The cis-element search results were implemented into the GraminaeTFDB as a searchable property. In addition, these search results were also incorporated as an annotation track of the genome browser (Gbrowse).2.4. Expression data for TF encoding genesHyperlinks linking those putative TF encoding genes of maize, rice, barley, and wheat, whose expression data are available in Genevestigator (https://www.genevestigator.com),29 were built and supplied on GramineaeTFDB. For putative rice TF encoding genes, hyperlinks linking their expression patterns available at RiceXPro (http://ricexpro.dna.affrc.go.jp/)30,31 were also built and supplied on our database.2.5. Genetic resources for TF encoding genesHyperlinks linking putative TF encoding genes of maize and rice to genetic resources available at http://www.plantgdb.org,32,33http://ricefox.psc.riken.jp,34 and http://signal.salk.edu/cgi-bin/RiceGE databases were built and supplied on GramineaeTFDB.2.6. Construction of a web-accessible databaseThe database is implemented in MySQL and the web interface of Perl CGI and Java script run on the Apache Web server. The definition strings used for sequence similarity searches for each database, the domain searches by InterProScan, cis-motif names from the PLACE database, and the assigned GO terms have been assembled as a keyword database enabling the users to specify queries on any keyword and to retrieve relevant information for genes from the GramineaeTFDB. A BLAST server was implemented to provide a similarity search interface for queried sequences using NCBI BLAST together with sequences of the six grasses, as well as those from Arabidopsis. Generic Genome Browser (Gbrowse)35 was also implemented in GramineaeTFDB for sequenced grasses to visualize the gene annotations of the putative TF encoding genes together with cis-motifs found on the upstream sequence of the TF genes. All of the data in the GramineaeTFDB are accessible not only through a web interface but also as downloadable files from the website. The cross-references of corresponding data for each of the entries were also implemented into the GramineaeTFDB together with the URLs for each of the original referenced data to provide hyperlinks on the web interface with seamless navigations.3. Results and discussion3.1. Identification of putative TFs in B. distachyon, maize, rice, sorghum, barley, and wheatWe have used the strategy and bioinformatics pipeline established previously to identify the complete TF repertoires from B. distachyon and maize from their annotated proteomes.20,21 We started with retrieving the complete sets of predicted proteins from B. distachyon (v1.0) and maize (v4a.53), followed by an HMMER search with all HMMs assembled using a predefined threshold of E < 1e-5. We then refined the results by combined automatic and manual inspections of the raw alignments to exclude false-positive hits and determine the true E-value for each TF family (GramineaeTFDB, Help page, Statistics). Given the importance of wheat and barley as major cereal crops, although their completed genomic sequences are currently not available yet, we attempted to identify partial TF repertoires from these two grass species using their FL-cDNA and CDS resources housed at TriFLDB (http://trifldb.psc.riken.jp).24 Thus, a total of 2152, 3623, 444, and 916 TF models were identified in B. distachyon, maize, barley, and wheat, respectively. These TFs were grouped into 60 families, while those of barley and wheat were classified into 49 and 58 families, respectively, based on the presence of domains that were specific for the family (Table 1).

In our study, we used the newest release version of maize and rice annotated protein sequences, the v4a.53 and TIGR6 for maize and rice, respectively, for TF prediction. Furthermore, we also included the TF repertoires of sorghum (Sbi1.4), which were identified using the same approach (Table 1), with the aim to construct a comprehensive grass TF database of six major grass species for comparative genomics of the grass TFs.Our distribution analysis has indicated that the TF families of the sequenced species, including B. distachyon, maize, rice, and sorghum, are scattered throughout the genome. The larger families, such as bHLH and PHD, have members that are distributed on almost every chromosome. Currently, the genomic sequencing and annotations of barley and wheat have not been finished yet; we will update their TF repertoires when completed genome sequences are available. Additionally, the number of predicted TFs of B. distachyon, maize, sorghum, and perhaps rice may be changed by future fine-tuning of gene annotations and/or HMM profiles. We will continue to update our website with new information to enhance the accuracy of TF prediction and annotation.A number of studies have substantiated that sequence homology-based clustering of the members of several gene families correlates with their function.21,36–38 The complete sequence of the wild grass B. distachyon, the first member of the Pooideae subfamily, can serve as a template for analysis of the large genomes of economically important pooideae grasses, including wheat and barley. We, therefore, subjected all the putative UniGene sequences of wheat and barley to a blastx homology search with their B. distachyon counterparts (E < 1e-10) as a means to identify putative TFs by homology search-based approach. A significant proportion of wheat and barley TFs showed high homology to B. distachyon TFs (Supplementary Table S1A and S1B, Fig. 1). Additionally, data shown in Fig. 1 suggest that the HMM search of FL-cDNA/CDS and this homology search-based approach may complement and support each other. Furthermore, recognition of B. distachyon as an important model system has led to the development of highly efficient transformation, genetic markers, microarrays, and databases (http://www.brachybase.org, http://www.phytozome.net, http://www.modelcrop.org, http://mips.helmholtz-muenchen.de/plant/index.jsp) and various valuable genetic resources, such as mutant and germplasm collections, have facilitated the use of B. distachyon by the research community.4,39–41 All these available tools can effectively aid homology-based functional annotations of the TFs of wheat, barley, and other pooideae grasses. Distribution and number of TFs of T. aestivum and H. vulgare, which were found by HMM search or homology search with TFs of B. distachyon. The HMM search was performed against full-length cDNA/CDS of both species.

GO-based functional annotation of identified TFs of B. distachyon, maize, sorghum, and riceA search for potential functions of the identified TFs of B. distachyon, maize, sorghum, and rice by literature analysis of published papers on PubMed database has revealed that although the sequences of B. distachyon, maize, sorghum, and rice have been completed, the majority of their TFs remain experimentally uncharacterized. Thus, as a means to extend our current knowledge base regarding their regulatory function, especially in abiotic stress responses, we assessed the putative functions of the TFs of these four species via comparative analyses with relevant GO annotations of Arabidopsis in TAIR. First, sequence similarity searches against Arabidopsis counterparts having GO terms in TAIR were carried out to assign the profile of GO terms to the grass TFs at the biological process level. All of the assigned terms were then counted to grasp the overall representation of GO terms in applied entries of grass TFs, and the top 20 most abundant terms, excluding broad terms of ‘regulation of transcription’, ‘DNA-dependent regulation of transcription’, ‘positive regulation of transcription’, ‘negative regulation of transcription’, and ‘biological process’, were subsequently used to classify the TFs (Fig. 2). A number of the analysed TFs are found to be related to stress and hormone responses, indicating important role of these TFs in controlling these biological processes. The assigned GO terms for each TF can be accessed through the detailed page of each TF of each grass species on our database (Fig. 3I). These annotations provide an insight into potential functions of identified TFs of B. distachyon, maize, sorghum, and rice which would aid researchers in selection of TFs of interest for further studies. At the same time, a large number of analysed TFs could not be classified into any GO category, indicating the limited amount of functional information that we know regarding the biological processes that most of the TFs mediate, even for model plants such as Arabidopsis. The representative distributions of the GO terms for biological processes associated with TFs from B. distachyon (B.d.), Z. mays (Z.m.), S. bicolor (S.b.), and O. sativa (O.s.) in comparison with A. thaliana (A.t.).

Discovery of cis-elements in the promoter regions of identified TFs and cis-element-based functional prediction of the TFsNumerous cis-elements have been reported for their essential roles in determining the tissue-specific or stress-induced expression patterns of genes.28,42 Strong lines of evidence have indicated that the cis-motifs are highly conserved among orthologous or paralogous genes and co-regulated genes, and defined cis-elements can effectively aid in the genome-wide screening of ABA and abiotic stress-responsive genes, which is our major interest.42–45 To facilitate the functional characterization and prediction of the TFs, especially the stress-related TFs, we retrieved the -500, -1000, and -3000 promoter regions of all the TF genes from B. distachyon, maize, rice, and shorgum, whose complete genomic sequences are available. We provided this promoter sequence data set on our website in addition to other relevant information on the TFs for convenient downloading. The -500, -1000, and -3000 bp promoter regions were subjected to an extensive in silico analyses to search for the existence of a total of 480 putative known cis-regulatory motifs, including 11 major abiotic stress-responsive cis-motifs.27,28 Information on the cis-elements located in the promoter regions of each TF is accessible on the detailed page of each TF gene under ‘cis-motif prediction’ function (Fig. 3K). By clicking on either ‘500 bp’, ‘1000 bp’, or ‘3000 bp’ function, the users will find additional page displaying the 500, 1000, or 3000 bp promoter region and the genomic sequence of the TF encoding gene, respectively, together with the cis-motifs located in the corresponding promoter region. The ‘+’ was added to indicate the putative transcription start. In addition, by clicking on ‘Go to TF search’ (Fig. 3A), the users will be navigated to the search page that provides the ‘cis-motif (stress-responsive)’ and ‘cis-motif (PLACE)’ search functions, which enables the search for all types of cis-motifs implemented in our database in promoter region of any TF and/or the search for those TFs which contains the cis-motif(s) of interest. In combination with comparative sequence analysis-based GO annotations, cis-motif analysis can facilitate the systematic functional predictions of grass TFs. For instance, first we search for grass TF genes which harbour stress-responsive cis-motif(s) in their promoter regions using our grass-specific database. Next, we screen the identified TFs using GO annotation provided for each TF on detailed annotation page (Fig. 3I). Thus, we will be able to identify the putative stress-responsive TFs based on both the existence of stress-responsive cis-motif(s) and the associated stress-responsive GO terms. The predicted stress-responsive function should be verified using an expression profiling approach prior to the launching of laborious in planta functional studies.3.4. Expression patterns of TF encoding genes from maize, rice, and barleyThe specifically expressed TFs are interesting as they are involved in defining the precise nature of individual tissues. Additionally, both in silico and genetic inspection suggested a positive correlation between the existence of cis-regulatory motifs and tissue-specific and/or stress-responsive expression patterns.46 To make our database a comprehensive integrated database for functional characterization and selection of stress-responsive TFs, we provided access to tissue-specific expression profiles documented in Genevestigator and RiceXPro through hyperlinks for those TF encoding genes of barley, maize, and rice, for which data are available. These TF genes are indicated by either [Genevestigator] and/or [RiceXPro] strings on the detailed page of our database (Fig. 3B). It is important to note that TF activity often depends on post-translational events and that levels of gene expression are not necessarily directly correlated to their regulatory activity. However, it is still useful to assess the extent of TF expression as it provides the first line of temporal and spatial evidence for linking them to putative in planta functions. The tissue-specific expression data can be used to address the combinatorial usage of TFs, which allows great precision and flexibility in dictating the transcriptional programme of different tissues. Ubiquitous TFs might control the general gene expression either in isolation or in combination with each other. Combinations of specific TFs might regulate tissue-specific genes. Alternatively, and perhaps most commonly, ubiquitous TFs might serve as a platform to regulate a broad set of genes, which are subsequently fine-tuned by specific regulators. Additionally, co-operativity among TFs has been shown to involve extensive protein–protein interactions, both within families of homomeric and heteromeric TFs and between structurally unrelated TFs.6,47,48 Analysis of such interactions will help elucidate patterns of combinatorial regulation and ultimately the regulatory functions of the TFs.49One of our main interests in the functional analysis of grass TF encoding genes is to identify abiotic stress-responsive TFs. At the present time, the Genevestigator resource contains stress-related expression data derived from high-throughput microarray experiments for the TF encoding genes of rice and barley. These expression patterns related to drought, cold, and salt stresses can also be accessed through the same hyperlinks provided on GramineaeTFDB for tissue-specific expression. The expression data together with information of cis-motif analyses, GO annotations, and sequence similarities inferred from comparative sequence analyses can facilitate the systematic functional predictions of identified TFs as well as provide valuable insights into further functional analyses of TFs. We will continue to update our database when expression information for other TF encoding genes becomes available.3.5. Mutant resources for functional studies of maize and rice TFsAn advantage in functional analyses of maize and rice TFs is the availability of the Ds, FOX, and T-DNA insertion mutant resources for a number of maize and rice TFs.32,50,51 A two-element Activator/Dissociation (Ac/Ds) gene trap system was successfully established and used for insertional mutagenesis in maize and numerous heterologous species to generate collections of stable, unlinked, and single-copy Ds mutants.32,52,53Ds mutant lines are generally gene knockout or knockdown mutants, but Ds activation tagging lines can also be identified among the mutants.54,55 On the other hand, FOX lines are basically gain-of-function mutants which were constructed by constitutively overexpressing rice FL-cDNAs under the control of 35S promoter in Arabidopsis.50 As a means to make the search for FOX and Ds lines convenient, we provided [RiceFOX] and [Closet DS] strings on the list of the search page of each TF family of rice and maize, respectively, for those TFs for which mutants are available (Fig. 3B). Users can gain full access to the respective mutant lines through the supplied hyperlinks on the detailed page (Fig. 3M) or Supplementary Tables S2 and S3. Additionally, for loss-of-function analysis of rice, the RiceGE database (http://signal.salk.edu/cgi-bin/RiceGE) is very useful and has broad functions. For instance, RiceGE provides information about available T-DNA insertion lines generated by an enhancer trap system. We, therefore, supplied [RiceGE] strings and hyperlinks linking directly the rice TFs to RiceGE on the detailed page (Fig. 3B and M). Supplementary Table S4 summarizes the GramineaeTFDB-RiceGE hyperlinks available for the rice TFs. Our database will be occasionally updated when more information are available in public resources or new mutant resources of other grass species are constructed and made available to public.3.6. Construction and description of a web-accessible database: GramineaeTFDBExtensive annotations were performed at both gene and family levels to provide comprehensive knowledge on the identified TFs of B. distachyon, maize, rice, sorghum, barley, and wheat (for details, see the GramineaeTFDB Help page). All the annotation data were integrated to develop GramineaeTFDB (http://gramineaetfdb.psc.riken.jp) aimed at integrating TF repertoires of major grasses for functional analyses and comparative genomics of the grass TFs. Figure 3 illustrates the web-based user interface of GramineaeTFDB. More detailed descriptions are provided on the Help page of GramineaeTFDB. Users can conveniently access to the detailed information on gene annotations, including gene structure, cDNA and protein sequences, domain structure predicted by InterProScan, promoter regions, domain alignments, clusters of homologous proteins within families, and GO terms derived from GO annotation using comparative analysis with their Arabidopsis counterparts. The data supplied are available not only for viewing but also for immediate downloading. The scientific community can browse predictions for a total of 2152, 3623, 444, and 916 TF models of B. distachyon, maize, barley, and wheat, respectively, as well as 1597 and 2205 TF models of rice and sorghum. Users can access to the search results listed for each TF family with description of each gene based on similarity search with TFs of other grasses and Arabidopsis as well as with sequences found in NCBI nr and UniProt databases. In detailed page for each TF gene, multiple alignments of amino acid sequences within TF families are also available for downloading and can be used for the construction of phylogenetic trees. Clustered results showing amino acid similarity with different levels of amino acid identity (30, 60, and 90%) and search functions for functional motif information of InterProScan, cis-motifs in promoter regions of TFs, and GO annotations are also provided. Additionally, GramineaeTFDB supplies an interface to perform sequence similarity searches using the NCBI BLAST program, as well as cross-reference links to different plant TF databases, including the general PlantTFDB and PlnTFDB, the grass-specific GRASSIUS, and the species-specific DATF, DRTF, and RARTF,17–19,56–58 making it a comprehensive integrated database for comparative studies of the TFs derived from different plant species.Integration of expression analysis, cis-motif, and GO annotations as well as comparative sequence analysis provided through this study may effectively aid in functional prediction of the TFs. It is noteworthy that for rice TF researchers, information about the availability of FOX and T-DNA insertion lines for rice TFs supplied through hyperlinks are very useful (Fig. 3B and M). Together with FOX, T-DNA insertion, and Ds lines, all the genetic and DNA resources, which are currently available for functional analyses of the grass TFs, can be accessed from our database. Table 2 summarizes all these useful resources available for each of six grass species. Providing such an information to the users has made our database unique in comparison with either GRASSIUS or PlantTFDB or PlnTFDB. GramineaeTFDB will therefore meet the broad demands of researchers who strive to perform research on TFs of grasses with the goal of gaining greater understanding of their regulatory roles in different signalling pathways underlying plant development, differentiation, and environmental responses. Our database may accelerate functional genomics and comparative genomics of TFs within individual grass, among grasses themselves, between grasses and non-grass plants, as well as other organisms. We will expand GraminaeTFDB by adding TF repertoires from other grasses upon their genomic sequencing and annotations are completed.

However, promoter length and preference of cis-elements are thought to be a direct reflection of core type-specific transcriptional initiation mechanisms.1. IntroductionPol II-dependent promoters of vertebrates are divided into two major groups: the TATA and CpG types. The former has sharp and peaky transcription start site (TSS) clusters with the peak TSS at a strict distance from the TATA box, and, in contrast, the latter has broad TSS clusters.1,2 The core type also affects the expression profile: the TATA and CpG types tend to show tissue-specific and constitutive expression profiles, respectively.3 In addition, the type of promoters has been reported to alter sequence diversity at the promoter region.4 Recent studies of the human genome have revealed that genes with TATA-type promoters have more compact gene structures than the ones with TATA-less promoters with respect to exon number, intron length, and mRNA length.5 These reports show that the core promoter type can influence not only transcriptional characteristics but also mutation rate and gene structure.With regard to the organization of transcriptional regulatory elements, analysis of the human genome has revealed that distinct elements preferentially localize far upstream, at the promoter region, at the first intron, and at the 3' region of genes.6 However, their relationship to core type is still poorly understood.Looking at non-vertebrate promoters, a recent analysis of Drosophila melanogaster found both sharp and broad TSS clusters as in the case of mammalian ones, while Drosophila does have the TATA type but not the CpG type.7 These findings suggest that broad TSS clusters are not necessarily associated with the CpG type promoters in non-vertebrates. However, association of the broad type promoter with constitutive expression is conserved in Drosophila as well.7The TATA box was found in plant promoters decades ago and has been thought to drive almost all plant promoters.8 Identification of a TATA-less promoter from tobacco9,10 suggested heterogeneity of plant core promoters, but it has only been recently that other core elements have been identified in plants.11,12 It is now known that TATA-type promoters account for only 20–30% of plant promoters12,13 as is the case in mammalian promoters.14Recent studies on plant core promoters have revealed that higher plants do not have the CpG type,11 supporting the idea of vertebrate-specific possession of this type of promoter.15 Instead, a plant-specific core, the GA type, has been identified by a bioinformatics approach called LDSS analysis.11,12 Genome-wide quantitative TSS analysis of Arabidopsis has revealed that the sharp cluster shape of the TATA type is conserved between mammals and plants, and the broad clusters of CpG type in mammalian genomes are found in the GA type of Arabidopsis.12In this report, we characterize three Arabidopsis core types, TATA, GA, and Coreless, with regard to their expression profiles and also their gene structure including promoter length and the distance from the TSS to the coding sequence (CDS). Results indicate that the core type does affect the gene structure as well as the expression profile. Furthermore, a new finding is that there is selective utilization of transcriptional regulatory elements in relation to the core type.2. Materials and methodsAll the bioinformatics analysis was done using homemade Perl scripts and Excel (Microsoft Japan, Tokyo). A total of 10 285 promoters that have quantitative TSS information in Arabidopsis thaliana (Col) were prepared in our previous study.12 The TSS information is supported by 158 237 TSS tags containing the Cap Signature from a single library, determined by the Cap Trapper-Massively Parallel Short Sequencing (CT-MPSS) methodology. For the rice analysis, 11 509 promoters for which there was full-length cDNA information were used.11 Promoter length was determined as the distance from the peak TSS of the promoter in question to the end of the gene model that locates upstream of the promoter. Versions used for the genome annotation are TAIR8 for Arabidopsis and RAP2 for rice. Nested genes were excluded from the measurements.2.1. TSS information and core typeThe position of the peak TSS for each TSS cluster identified by CT-MPSS analysis, the expression level and peak ratio of each TSS cluster, the core promoter type of each promoter, and the sequences of the Regulatory Element Groups (REGs) were determined in our previous reports.11,12,16 ‘Coreless’ promoters were defined in a previous report12 as the ones that do not have any TATA, Y Patch, GA, or CA elements at the expected positions. Otherwise mentioned, statistical examination of multiple populations was carried out by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey–Kramer's test after log transformation of length. P-values of <0.05 under the assumption of non-biased distributions were considered as significant.2.2. Utilization of microarray dataAccessions of microarray data used in Fig. 5 are as follows. Wound: response after 1 h TAIR_ME00330;17 HL: high-light treatment at 150 W/m2 for 3 h;18 drought: 1 h treatment, TAIR_ME00338;17 cold: 6 h treatment, E-GEOD-3326;19Pseudomonas syringe pv tomato DC3000 for 6 h; ABA: 10 µM abscisic acid for 1 h, TAIR_ME00333; pathogen infection: P. syringe pv tomato DC3000 for 6 h, E-GEOD-3326; ABA: 10 µM abscisic acid for 1 h, TAIR_ME00333;20 auxin: 1 µM IAA for 3 h, TAIR_ME00336;20 CK: 1 µM zeatin for 3 h, TAIR_ME00356;20 JA: 10 µM methyl jasmonate for 3 h, TAIR_ME00337;20 SA: 10 µM salicylic acid (SA) for 3 h, TAIR_ME00364;20 H2O2: spraying 3% solution for 3 h.18 Genes that showed no expression (A/M Flags in the GeneChip data) were excluded from the analysis. Genes that did not have any TSS information were also excluded from the analysis.Predicted transcriptional regulatory elements shown in Tables 1 and 3 (high RARf octamers) were determined based on microarray data.21 Analyses shown in Fig. 5A and B were achieved by scanning promoter ratios with bins of 51 (thin line) and 201 (thick line) promoters for average after sorting them according to their responses to ABA or wounding.

Results3.1. Promoter lengthFirst, we analysed the relationship between core promoter type and the distance from the most major TSS of a gene to the end of the neighbouring upstream gene, that is an indication of room for promoters in the genome. This distance is not equal to the functional promoter length but longer and, technically to say, much easier to measure. We expect that the former distance in the compact Arabidopsis genome is reflected to the latter length. A total of 10 285 Arabidopsis genic promoters with experimentally identified peak TSSs12 were subjected to the analysis. The distance from the peak TSS to the end of the upstream gene model was measured for each gene, and the distribution of the length between the core types was determined. End of upstream gene model is the closer point of either start or endpoint of the transcribed region of the gene. As the distance varied considerably depending on the direction of the upstream gene, we analysed two situations as shown in Fig. 1A, head-to-head and tail-to-head cases. In general, the tail-to-head pattern had shorter length, and median values for head-to-head and tail-to-head were 1.30 and 0.85 kb, respectively (Fig. 1B). Statistical analysis revealed that these two populations are significantly different (P = 2e-11 in the Tukey–Kramer's test). The left graph of Fig. 1A (HEAD to HEAD) shows that the Coreless type, that is defined as a promoter group not containing either TATA, Y Patch, GA, or CA elements,12 is more abundant in the fractions of shorter length (1–1000 bp) than the average (‘All’ in the graph), while the TATA type is more abundant in the fractions of longer length (2001 to over 5000 bp). The same tendency is observed in the tail-to-head pattern as shown in the right graph. These inclinations are reflected in the median values for each promoter type (Fig. 1B), demonstrating a shorter length for the Coreless types and a longer one for the TATA type. The GA type showed a similar length to ‘All’. Promoter length and core promoter type. Promoters were divided into two groups according to the orientation of the upstream gene, and for each group, distribution of promoter length from the major TSS to the end of the upstream gene, defined by the gene model, is shown with respect to the core promoter types.

Statistically distinguished groups are labelled with different alphabetical letters over the bars.The Arabidopsis genome is tightly packed with an average gene length of 4.5 kb.22 Therefore, it was expected that there has been strong pressure towards shorter promoter lengths in the Arabidopsis genome, which provides an ideal situation to measure the required promoter length. The average gene length of the rice genome is 10 kb,23 and thus, in this case, less stringency for promoter length was expected. Although rice promoters showed the same tendencies as the Arabidopsis promoters, difference in the distance according to the core types was not statistically significant in the rice genome (Fig. 2).

Statistically distinguished groups are labelled with different alphabetical letters over the bars.We previously confirmed in Arabidopsis a positive correlation between the TATA ratio and the expression level, as is the case in the mammalian TATA type.12 In this report, we analysed the relationship of the ratio of the Coreless promoters to the expression level, which is measured by counts of TSS tags in a library (tpm, tag per million). In this case, there was a negative correlation in contrast to the TATA ratio (Fig. 3A). These observations suggest the possibility that the different promoter lengths, according to the core type, are correlated with their expression level. We therefore directly compared promoter length with expression level (Fig. 3B) regardless of the core type, but as shown in the figure, no correlation was found. Thus, we concluded that the observed difference in promoter length between the core types is not an indirect result of expression level but a characteristic of the core type itself.

Distance from TSS to CDSAnother parameter of gene structure that is related to transcription is the distance from the peak TSS to the CDS. This distance represents the length of 5' UTR when there is no intron in the region. We analysed the relationship of the core types to this length. As shown in Fig. 4A, the TATA type has a shorter distance while that of the Coreless type is longer. The former has a narrow and sharp TSS cluster12 that might shorten the distance from the TSS to the CDS in comparison to a broad TSS cluster. Another possibility is that this results from a direct relationship with expression level. These two possibilities were then investigated. Distance from TSS to CDS is tightly associated with expression level. (A) The distance from the major TSS to the downstream translation start site is shown for the core types. (B) The distance from the TSS to the CDS is shown in relation to the shape of the TSS cluster. (C) The distance from the TSS to the CDS is shown in relation to the expression level (tpm). (D) For each core type, the expression level (tpm) is shown. Statistically distinguished groups are labelled with different alphabetical letters over the bars.Distance from TSS to CDS is tightly associated with expression level.

(D) For each core type, the expression level (tpm) is shown. Statistically distinguished groups are labelled with different alphabetical letters over the bars.Figure 4B and C shows the relationship between the distance to the CDS with the shape of the TSS cluster (grey graph on the left) and with the expression level (black graph on the right). The results show that this distance does not have any relationship with the shape of the TSS cluster but clear correlation with the expression level. Statistical analysis revealed that the latter correlation is significant.We then analysed the relationship between the core types, distance to the CDS, and expression level (Fig. 4A and D). As expected, the figure revealed a clear mirror image between Fig. 4A and D, indicating that difference in the distance among the shown core types can be explained by difference in the expression level of each type. These results reveal that the relationship shown in Fig. 4A is not necessarily direct.3.3. Regulated and constitutive expressionThe results in our previous report, which were obtained with the aid of microarray data of light stress, drought stress, and H2O2 responses, suggested that the TATA is rich in stress-responsive promoters while the GA and Coreless types are rich in constitutive ones.12 Here, we extend the analysis with various other microarray data including those of several plant hormone and stress responses.Figure 5A shows the promoter ratio of TATA, GA, and Coreless types with regard to response to ABA. A clear valley-shape distribution in the top graph indicates there is an enrichment of the TATA type among ABA-responsive promoters, including both positive and negative responses. While the TATA ratio of the no-response promoters (response to ABA is 1.0) is 0.195, the ratio increases to 0.484 and 0.508 where the response to ABA is 0.40 and 5.13 (ends of the thick lines in the graph), respectively, demonstrating a 2.5–2.6 fold increase in the TATA ratio. The middle graph of Fig. 5A shows the GA ratio, and this does not show any clear tendency. The bottom graph for the Coreless ratio shows a hill-shape distribution, meaning enrichment of the Coreless promoters at the no-response group to ABA. Figure 5B shows results of the same analysis but with the wound response, and the same tendency is observed. Regulated expression and core promoter type. (A and B) The ratio of the core promoter types (TATA, GA, and Coreless) in relation to the response to ABA treatment or to wounding is shown. All the promoters were aligned according to their response, and the mean core ratio was calculated with a bin of 51 (grey) and 201 (black) promoters each. 1.0 on the horizontal axis indicates no response to the treatments. (C and D) The promoter ratio of the TATA and Coreless type is shown in relation to the type of gene response. Significantly different value from All, judged by Fisher's exact test, is shown with an asterisk.Regulated expression and core promoter type. (A and B) The ratio of the core promoter types (TATA, GA, and Coreless) in relation to the response to ABA treatment or to wounding is shown. All the promoters were aligned according to their response, and the mean core ratio was calculated with a bin of 51 (grey) and 201 (black) promoters each. 1.0 on the horizontal axis indicates no response to the treatments. (C and D) The promoter ratio of the TATA and Coreless type is shown in relation to the type of gene response. Significantly different value from All, judged by Fisher's exact test, is shown with an asterisk.The TATA and Coreless ratios were calculated for promoters that respond to various stresses and phytohormones (Fig. 5C and D, genes with >3.0- and <0.33-fold responses were selected as responsive genes), including wounding, high-light stress (HL), drought, cold, pathogen infection (P. syringe pv tomato DC3000), ABA, cytokinin (CK), auxin, jasmonic acid (JA), SA, and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). ‘All’ in Fig. 5C and D means the average of all the Arabidopsis promoters. As shown in the graphs, the TATA ratio of the promoters that have positive and negative responses to the stresses and phytohormones are all higher than the average (‘All’), and the Coreless ratios are all lower than the average. From these results, we concluded that ‘regulated’ promoters are rich in the TATA type, and constitutive ones are rich in the Coreless type.3.4. REG densityREG is a group of putative position-sensitive cis-regulatory elements identified form their distribution profiles in the promoter region. They have been identified as octamer elements that showed preferential appearance in -400 to -40 bp relative to the peak TSS. Because this group includes many reported cis-regulatory elements, we named it as REG.16 One unique characteristics of REG is no directional preference in the distribution profiles. From the Arabidopsis genome, 308 REGs have been identified.16 We next analysed the relationship between core type and REG density. Figure 6 shows the number of REGs per 8 bp in a promoter according to the promoter position for each core type. The analysis revealed that the GA and Coreless types have a 2-fold higher REG density than the TATA type. REG density and core promoter type. The distribution of REG according to the promoter position is shown for each core promoter type.REG density and core promoter type. The distribution of REG according to the promoter position is shown for each core promoter type.3.5. Preferred and avoided sequences for each core typeFigure 6 reveals that the GA and Coreless types have more REGs per promoter than the TATA type. One question this raises is whether the core type has any preference for REG species. We extended this question to various types of octamers representing core elements, REGs, and also other types of putative cis-regulatory elements extracted using microarray data, called high RARf octamers. This last category has been identified as overrepresented sequences in a promoter set showing transcriptional responses to several phytohormones and some environmental stresses, and includes many sequence motifs that are recognized by DNA-binding proteins.21 For each octamer category, appearance rates were compared between the total promoters in the genome and sets of promoters belonging to the individual core types. The probability of the observed difference under the assumption of random distribution was calculated regardless of the degree of difference in the appearance rates, and the number of octamers that showed P< 0.05 were counted. The identified octamers are thus preferentially found in promoters of a specific core type.Table 1 shows the summary of the analysis. We have reported that TATA and GA elements have a mutually exclusive relationship in the Arabidopsis genome.12 This tendency is confirmed in the table: the TATA-type promoters have GA octamers that have significantly decreased appearance rates (Core: TATA~Octamer: GA, 15 decreased octamers) where as no GA octamers were found for increased appearance rates (0 increased octamers), and vice versa (Core: GA~Octamer: TATA, 3 decreased and 0 increased octamers).Looking at the cis-related octamers (REG and high RARf), the table shows that there are preferred and avoided sequences for each core type. Consistent with the REG density analysis (Fig. 6), decreased REGs are found more in the TATA type than the increased ones (118 vs. 9) while the GA and Coreless types show the opposite tendency (20 vs. 5 for GA, and 14 vs. 9 for Coreless, respectively). In the case of the high RARf octamers, the number of preferred and avoided sequences is equal for each core type (196 vs. 184, 73 vs. 105, and 177 vs. 102 for TATA, GA, and Coreless, respectively).The analysis shown in Table 1 identified high RARf sequences with biased appearance rates according to the core type. We then investigated whether these putative transcriptional regulatory elements have any specificity to core type. Results of REGs and high RARf octamers are shown in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. These results suggest the presence of core type-specific cis-regulatory elements whose function is dependent on the core type.

LDSS-positive core-related octamers are removed.4. DiscussionTable 4 summarizes the characteristics of the Arabidopsis core types. The TATA type is rich in promoters with regulated expression profiles, while the Coreless type is rich in constitutive promoters. The GA type was also suggested to be constitutive,12 but further analyses shown in Fig. 5 could not confirm this suggestion. Considering the other characteristics shown in the table, a clear contrast is found between the TATA and the Coreless types. The Coreless type has no recognizable core elements, but still functions as a genic promoter with constitutive expression. One of the essential questions about this promoter type is how the position and direction of transcriptional initiation is determined. These results do not offer an answer, but the presence of unique and abundant cis-elements, revealed by Fig. 6, Tables 2 and 3, might play a role, at least in determining the position. Another possibility for transcriptional initiation in the Coreless type is guidance by the open nucleosomal status. Because it can be made by nucleotide sequences much longer than ~10 bp, this idea is not contradictory to the absence of any core elements in the Coreless type. Characteristics of core promoter typesA summary of this work is shown.aAlso supported by Yamamoto et al.12Characteristics of core promoter typesA summary of this work is shown.aAlso supported by Yamamoto et al.12The TATA type has characteristics of regulated gene expression. At the same time, Fig. 6 reveals that REG density of the promoter group is less than average. Currently, we do not have additional data explaining this apparent discrepancy. One possible explanation is that REG functions not only for transcriptional regulation but also for constitutive expression. Further studies would be necessary to understand this discrepancy.Analysis of light activation of the TATA-less psaDb promoter has been suggested compatibility between the core type and some regulatory elements.10 While there is no clear evidence to support this hypothesis, the proposed model can be extended as a generalized question: do different core types require distinct sets of regulatory elements? Our analysis as shown in Tables 2 and 3 detected groups of putative regulatory elements that are preferentially used by specific core types. The presence of specific regulatory elements is not very surprising if we assume different transcriptional initiation mechanisms according to core types.In spite of finding of specific regulatory elements, the majority of the examined elements do not show preference to specific core types (Table 1). This would imply that mechanisms for transcriptional initiation largely overlap among the three core types.In this report, a close, negative relationship has been revealed between the distance from the TSS to the CDS and the expression level. There are at least three possible explanations of this relationship: transcriptional activation by closer CDSs, post-transcriptional mRNA stabilization by shorter 5' UTRs, and an indirect relationship between two parameters with no functional relationship at all. The second possibility is unlikely because mRNA accumulation is thought to be determined primarily at the transcriptional level for nuclear-encoded genes. In order to assess the third possibility, we examined translational efficiency according to the distance from the TSS to the CDS on the assumption that genes requiring high expression would have high mRNA accumulation and high translation efficiency without any functional relationship between these two phenomena, and the latter correlates with a short distance from the TSS to the CDS. However, preliminary analysis of the translational efficiency with the aid of the ribosome-loading ratio24 did not show any significance in relation to the distance from the TSS to the CDS (data not shown). The lack of positive evidence for any of these three possibilities means that further study is required to reveal the explanation.The suggested longer promoter length of the TATA type implies that the requirement for promoter length is more stringent for this promoter type. These different requirements of the core types would reflect different mechanisms of transcriptional initiation. Requirement of the differential promoter length between the TATA and the Coreless types is clear in the compact Arabidopsis genome (gene density: 4.9 kb/gene) and, although less obvious, it is still detectable in the rice genome (10.4 kb/gene). However, in large genomes, like the maize and human ones (both ~100 kb/gene), detection of promoter length would be difficult. Hence, use of the Arabidopsis genome is advantageous when analysing promoter length requirements.This report confirmed that individual core promoter types have distinct functional aspects in plants as well (Fig. 5), indicating differentiation of their biological roles. The TATA type is ubiquitously found in eukaryotes from yeast to human and rice, and their characteristics, that is regulated and high expression profiles and sharp shape of TSS clusters, are well conserved between plants and mammals, suggesting that it is essential for eukaryotes.In addition to the TATA type, detection of the second type in both plants and vertebrates may suggest that there are some biological situations where the TATA type is inappropriate, that promote emergence of the second type of promoters. Current knowledge, including finding of this article, suggests that the TATA type is not good at performing low or constitutive expression patterns.3,12 This idea of the TATA type as a specialist, not an all-round player, is supported by the presence of some putative regulatory elements that tend to be avoided for the TATA type (Table 2 and 3), and a low ratio of the TATA type (10–30%) of promoters in an eukaryotic genome.12–14 Further comparison of various eukaryotic promoters would help understanding necessity of heterogeneity of core promoters in an eukaryotic genome.5. ConclusionOur genome-wide analysis has revealed that the core promoter type is related to gene structure, including room for promoters in the genome, the distance from the TSS to the CDS, and the number and species of the cis-regulatory elements. Although the relationship between the distance from the TSS to the CDS and the core type appears to be indirect, promoter length and the preference for cis-elements are suggested to reflect the respective transcriptional initiation mechanisms of the core type.FundingThis work was supported in part by Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Priority Areas ‘Comparative Genomics’ (Y.Y.Y. and J.O.), Scientific Research (B) (Y.Y.Y., Y.Y., M.H., and J.O.), Scientific Research (C) (Y.Y.Y.), Scientific Research on Innovative Areas (Y.Y.Y.) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan.We would like to acknowledge Dr Masaki Ando for excellent advice on statistical tests."

IntroductionAs a predominant domestic animal, pig (Sus scrofa) not only provides us plenty meat, but also is an important model organism for medical research. Understanding the genetic principle of growth and reproduction traits is helpful for S. scrofa production and also has scientific significance for basic biology and human medicine.1 Notable progress has been achieved to identify causative genes or single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) underlie complex traits in the past decades. A recessive missense mutation of S. scrofa ryanodine receptor (RYR1) gene was proved to induce malignant hyperthermia and halothane sensitivity in S. scrofa, which was effectively applied in selection program by many breeding farms.2 In 2003, an SNP in intron 3 of insulin-like growth factor 2 was identified as a causative quantitative trait nucleotide for porcine muscle growth.3With the accomplishment of S. scrofa genome sequencing, it is realistic and efficient to identify genes or genetic markers underlying complex traits at whole-genome or transcriptome level. In 2005, a 0.66× coverage S. scrofa genome including 3.84 million shotgun sequences was generated from Hampshire, Yorkshire, Landrace, Duroc and ErHuaLian pigs, giving rise to 2.08 billion nucleotide bases, indicating that the S. scrofa genome is much closer to human than mouse does.4 Later, the complete S. scrofa genome was available online in 2009 (November 2009, SGSC Sscrofa9.2/susScr2; http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgBlat). From 4.8 million whole-genome shotgun sequences, 98 151 SNPs were predicted with one sequence representing the polymorphism, and most SNPs were confirmed by testing in three purebred boar lines and wild boar.5 Recently, a high-density SNP chip (Illumina Porcine 60K + SNP iSelect Beadchip) was designed and supplied for commercial use, which included 64 232 SNPs after reliable validation.6 The developed SNP chip was subsequently used in whole-genome association analysis to identify genes for body composition and structural soundness traits in S. scrofa.7Based on genomic background, investigation of S. scrofa transcriptome is realistic and extremely useful for identification of candidate genes account for quantitative traits at the global level. The cDNA microarray or gene chip is a common tool for transcriptomic analysis. Confirmed by real-time RT–PCR and association analyses, some candidate genes and SNP markers for S. scrofa reproduction traits have been identified with microarray profiling by Affymetrix Porcine Genechip™.8 With the use of S. scrofa whole-genome 70-mer oligonucleotide microarray, 62 expression quantitative traits loci (eQTLs) were successfully identified from loin muscle tissue through global genome-wide linkage analysis.9 Nevertheless, cDNA microarray has some limitations as it fails to recognize new genes (transcripts) and sequence variations.RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is a new but efficient technology for the thorough investigation on transcriptome. With the rapid development of second-generation sequencing, RNA-seq becomes more efficient and less costive by some latterly developed platforms, i.e. Roche 454, Illuminate Solexa GA IIx, Life Technology SOLID, Helicos Biosciences tSMS and others.10 The Roche 454 can generate long reads and is generally used in transcriptome analysis in human,11,12 mammals,13 insects,14 fish,15 plants16,17 and microorganisms.18Until now, reports on S. scrofa transcriptome by RNA-seq technology are very limited. In this study, we performed 454 pyrosequencing of muscle and ovary tissues to characterize S. scrofa transcriptome and to identify potential markers for growth and reproduction traits.2. Materials and methods2.1. Animal and RNA preparationOne landrace female at 6-month age was subject to transcriptomic analysis of S. scrofa. Landrace is a typical commercial S. scrofa strain and widely used in domestic livestock production. The animal was slaughtered quickly to collect two tissues of the ovary and back-leg muscle. The fresh tissues were steeped in liquid nitrogen immediately after collection, and then kept at -80°C refrigerator (Thermo Forma, USA) for preservation before use. Trizol (Invitrogen, CA, USA) was used to isolate total RNA following the manufacturer's protocols.2.2. Construction of cDNA library and 454 sequencingApproximately 10-µg total RNA was delivered to Shanghai Majorbio Bio-pharm Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China) for the construction of a cDNA library. RNA quality was assessed by 260/280 and 260/230 ratios with the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. The SMART cDNA library construction kit (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA) was used to construct the cDNA library of the muscle and ovary tissues following the manufacturer's protocol step by step. cDNA was sheared by nebulization and DNA bands (500–800 bp) were extracted from gel after agarose gel electrophoresis. The obtained DNA was purified, blunt ended, ligated to adapters and finally small fragments were removed. The quality control of a double DNA library was performed using High Sensitivity Chip (Agilent Technologies). The concentration was examined by TBS 380 Fluorometer. One-plate whole run sequencing was performed on the GS FLX Titanium chemistry (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA) by Shanghai Majorbio Bio-pharm Biotechnology Co., Ltd. following the manufacturer's protocol.2.3. Bioinformatic analysisFor each of the sequencing reads, low-quality bases and the sequencing adapter were trimmed using LUCY and SeqClean. The remained 454 reads of the ovary and back-leg muscle were first assembled using the Newbler software using default parameters. The combined reads of the ovary and back-leg muscle were also assembled using the Newbler software.To improve the assembler quality, we collected the ESTs of S. scrofa from PigEST database (http://pigest.ku.dk/download/index.html), which included 398 837 Pub EST sequences and 823 871 Sino-Danish S. scrofa EST sequences. All the ESTs from Roche 454 and PigEST databases were used to run the final assemble of S. scrofa. We chosen the trans-Abyss software for the final assemble, which assembled the ESTs through combining the results of different Kmer parameters. The unigenes with >100 bp in length were used for the subsequent analysis. Moreover, all ESTs were mapped to the S. scrofa draft genome version 9 (download from Ensembl ftp server http://asia.ensembl.org/info/data/ftp/index.html). ESTs were considered to be mapped successfully if it had over 95% identities to the corresponding genome sequences.The unigenes were compared with the protein non-redundant database using BlastX19 with E-value < 1.0 × 10-5 (E-values <1.0 × 10-5 were considered as a significant level). Gene ontology (GO) terms20 were extracted from the best hits obtained from the BlastX against the nr database (E-value = 1.0 × 10-6) using blast2go and then were sorted for the GO categories using in-house perl scripts. The metabolic pathway was performed using Kyoto Encyclopaedia of genes and genomes.EST reads from the ovary and back-leg muscle were mapped to a unigene sequence using the SSAHA software, respectively. The expression of each unigene was calculated using the numbers of reads with a specific match. Genes with different expression were identified using R package DGEseq.21The unigene sequences were screened for microsatellites using software MISA (MicroSAtellite, http://pgrc.ipk-gatersleben.de/misa/). All the 454 reads were mapped to the unigenes using SSAHA. The SNPs were extracted using VarScan with the default parameter only when both alleles were detected from 454 reads. The released S. scrofa genome (download from Ensembl ftp server http://asia.ensembl.org/info/data/ftp/index.html) was used to confirm and locate the SNPs. Only those SNPs that both specifically match a certain genomic region and have a minor allelic frequency no less than 20% are included in analysis.2.4. Data depositionThe Roche 454 reads of S. scrofa by this study are now available from Animal Genomics databases by National Animal Genome Research Program (NAGRP, USA) with URL of http://www.animalgenome.org/repository/pub/SCAU2011.0502/.3. Results3.1. 454 sequencing and assemblyIn this study, we constructed two cDNA libraries and subsequently obtained two sets of transcriptomic reads for the back-leg muscle and ovary each. The schematic of 454 EST analyses is showed by Fig. 1. For the back-leg muscle, Roche 454 sequencing yielded a total of 558 743 reads with a total nucleotide size of 219 021 745 bp, giving rise to average 392 bp per read (Table 1; Supplementary Fig. S1). For the ovary, meanwhile, we obtained 528 260 reads for 202 745 596 bp in total, giving rise to average 384 bp per read (Table 1; Supplementary Fig. S1).

The steps include 454 sequencing, assembly of reads into contigs and isogroups, GO annotation, KEGG analysis and discovery of SNPs and SSRs.By assemble analysis, we obtained 71 327 ESTs (11 057 contigs averaging 787 bp and 60 270 singletons) for the back-leg muscle and 82 396 ESTs (12 204 contigs averaging 780 bp and 70 192 singletons) for the ovary, as well as 121 299 ESTs (18 938 contigs averaging 810 bp and 102 361 singletons) for combined tissues (Table 2; Supplementary Fig. S2). Most of these contigs distributed in the 401–1500-bp region, and about half of them distributed in 401–700 bp for each of the back-leg muscle (51.35%), ovary (51.79%) and combined tissue (49.62%) (Table 3; Supplementary Fig. S2). Summary on assemble analysisSummary on assemble analysisStatistics of contigs by 454 sequencingStatistics of contigs by 454 sequencingContigs were further assembled to 9496 isogroups averaging 662 bp for the back-leg muscle, 10 440 isogroups averaging 719 bp for the ovary and 15 825 isogroups averaging 1267 bp for combined tissues (Table 2). In average, each isogroup has 1.16, 1.17 and 1.20 contigs for the back-leg muscle (11 057 contigs for 9496 isogroups), ovary (12 204 contigs for 10 440 isogroups) and combined tissues (18 938 contigs for 15 825 isogroups), respectively. As far as all contigs were concerned, the concentration of A, T, C and G was 29.0, 28.7, 21.1 and 21.2%, respectively, giving rise to the overall GC content of 42.3% for S. scrofa transcriptome.By comparison, our original 454 sequence with the S. scrofa genome, 246 628 ESTs could match the genome, and among them, 216 739 specifically locate on one region and 29 889 locate on two or more regions. As far as different chromosomes are compared, chromosome 1 (23 237 or 10.72%), 4 (17 087 or 7.88%), 2 (16 957 or 7.82%), 14 (16 724 or 7.72%) and 13 (15 738 or 7.26%) contained more transcripts than others, whereas X (4495 or 2.07%) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA; 1665 or 0.77%) had very fewer EST (Supplementary Fig. S3).3.2. Alternative splicingMore contigs than isogroups are found because some contigs or called isocontigs are attributed to the same isogroups due to alternative splicing (Tables 2 and 4). There are 7.0% (662 of 9496), 6.9% (719 of 10 440) and 8.0% (1267 of 15 825) isogroups have no less than two contigs in the back-leg muscle, ovary and combined tissues, respectively. The alternative-spliced isogroups in the back-leg muscle, ovary and combined tissues averagely have 3.4, 3.5, and 3.5 isocontigs, respectively (Table 4).

GO assignmentsA total of 56 589 transcripts of S. scrofa were assigned for GO analysis based on matches with sequences whose functions were known previously. Among these transcripts, 45 846 transcripts were successfully annotated with confident matches.

Tissue-specific analysis for differentially expressed genesComparison of gene expression by DEGseq showed that a total of 336 genes expressed in the back-leg muscle with a significantly higher level than that of the ovary. These genes are involved in biological process (160 genes), cellular components (96) and molecular function (80) (Supplementary Fig. S4). In addition, another 553 genes significantly expressed in the ovary rather than the back-leg muscle. These genes are involved in biological process (295 genes), cellular components (130) and molecular function (128) (Supplementary Fig. S5).3.6. Single-nucleotide polymorphismsBy excluding those that either could not specifically match the S. scrofa genome or had minor allele frequencies lower than 20%, we totally obtained 24 214 SNPs which comprised various substitutions of A-G (8484), C-T (8697), A-C (1635), A-T (1991), C-G (1325) and G-T (2082). The ratio of transitions (17 181) to transversions (7033) is ~2.44. Except for 125 SNPs in mtDNA, all others (24 089) are in nucleic DNA including 1–18 autosomes (23 481) and X chromosome (608). The distribution of SNPs in each chromosome is described in Table 6. Distribution of SNPs in the S. scrofa genomeaChromosomes 1–18 and X indicate 18 autosomes and sex chromosome each, whereas MT indicates mtDNA.Distribution of SNPs in the S. scrofa genomeaChromosomes 1–18 and X indicate 18 autosomes and sex chromosome each, whereas MT indicates mtDNA.3.7. Simple sequence repeats or microsatellitesWe obtained 11 928 simple sequence repeats (SSRs), of which 45.72% were di-nucleotide repeats (5453), followed by 36.06% tri-nucleotide repeats (4301) and 14.85% tetra-nucleotide repeats (1771), as well as 3.38% penta-nucleotide repeats (403) (Table 7). There are six types of di-nucleotide repeats, and among them (GT)n, (AC)n and (AT)n are three predominant types with frequencies of 28.5, 27.6 and 23.12%, respectively (Supplementary Table S1). Among tri-nucleotide repeats, the frequencies of 20 SSR types seem to vary moderately from 0.19 to 17.11%, and the most common repeats are (GTT)n (17.11%) and (ACC)n (10.14%) (Supplementary Table S2). As many as 45 SSRs present for tetra-nucleotide repeats, and five of them [15.70% for (ATTT)n, 14.85% for (AAAT)n, 14.00% for (GTTT)n, 12.70% for (CTTT)n and 12.37% for (AAAC)n] are major ones with frequencies over 10% (Supplementary Table S3). Among 21 penta-nucleotide repeats types, (GTTTT)n (34.99%) and (AAAAC)n (20.60%) are two predominant types, followed by 10.42% for (ATTTT)n, and the rest less than 10% (Supplementary Table S4). Summary on microsatellite loci in S. scrofa transcriptomeSummary on microsatellite loci in S. scrofa transcriptome4. DiscussionThe obtained transcriptomic sequences by this study are useful for us to understand the genetic makeup of S. scrofa whole transcriptome, and to our knowledge, it is very limited until now. Even though the draft S. scrofa genome was released on November 2009, very fewer articles could be found regarding the S. scrofa genome or trancriptome based on large-scale sequence data. The 454 pyrosequencing yield 1 087 003 reads in total, including 558 743 for the back-leg muscle and 528 260 for the ovary and 421 Mb nucleotide residues for S. scrofa transcriptome by this study. A recent research obtained 1 253 361 454 sequences for the skeletal muscle (701 695) and heart (551 666) and showed the reproducibility within 454 sequencing and cDNA microarray; however, further analyses of S. scrofa transcriptome with 454 sequences were not reported thereby.13 Most transcripts (78.7%) identified by this study could match the released S. scrofa genome, and they scattered on chromosome 1–18, X and mtDNA. The bigger chromosomes seem to contain more transcripts compared with others. The obtained overall GC content of S. scrofa transcriptome was 42.3%, which was lower than the reported GC content in 5'UTR (59.2%), coding (49.6%), but a little bit higher than 3'UTR (41.8%) in the S. scrofa genome.4 It seemed that more 3'UTR than other regions (coding and 5'UTR) were included in analyses, as far as only assembled contigs rather than singletons were concerned. The genome-wide average GC content of the human genome is 41%, varying from different chromosomes and regions.22 It is known that the mouse has a slightly higher overall GC content (42%), but the distribution is tighter.23 Over 1 million 454 reads and 121 299 ESTs by this study are useful resource for further research on S. scrofa functional genomics.Both gene annotation and pathway analyses are helpful for us to predict potential genes and their functions at a whole-transcriptome level. In S. scrofa transcriptome, as discovered by this study, the predominant gene clusters are involved in the cellular process and metabolic process of biological process, the binding and catalytic activity of molecular function, as well as the cell, cell part and organelle of a cellular component. Similar results are found in European eel,24 rainbow trout15 and Red bugs.14 Whereas, in Chickpea transcriptome, genes are predominantly involved in the protein metabolism of biological process and the transferase activity of molecular function, as well as the chloroplast of cellular component, which indicated notable differences between animals and plants.25 In addition, we also predicted overall 4268 ESTs (or transcripts) that are involved in 132 predicted KEGG metabolic pathways, and two major pathways (biosynthesis of secondary metabolites and oxidative phosphorylation) comprised over 1000 ESTs. The predicted pathways altogether with gene annotation are useful for further investigation on gene function in future.The differentially expressed genes in the back-leg muscle and ovary tissues are probably related to their metabolism and functions. In this study, we found 336 and 553 genes that were significantly expressed in the back-leg muscle and ovary, and they were involved in biological process, cellular components and molecular function by further gene annotation. A recent study identified a total of 306 differently expressed genes between muscle and heart tissue based on 1 253 361 Roche 454 reads and confirmed most genes by a microarray approach.13 In this study, more differently expressed genes were found between back-leg muscle and ovary based on 1 087 003 reads. As far as different tissues are used by both studies, these differently expressed genes still require for further confirmation. As the muscle and ovary are crucial tissues for growth and reproduction, the identified genes with different expression are the potential candidate for growth and reproduction traits of S. scrofa.Plenty expression SNPs (eSNPs) as identified by this study are valuable molecular markers for further research on S. scrofa. A total of 24 214 SNPs (minor allele frequencies =0.2) were found to specifically match the S. scrofa genome, in which 608 and 125 are in X chromosome and mtDNA, and the rest (23 481) in 18 autosomes. In general, these SNPs should be reliable eSNPs and act as candidate markers for identification of eQTL. In the genome level, a total of 98 151 SNPs were predicted based on 4.8 million whole-genome shotgun sequences.5 Another study, moreover, discovered as many as 372 886 SNPs by sequencing with Illumina's Genome Analyzer (GA), and 62 621 loci of them were used to design the Illumina Porcine 60K + SNP iSelect Beadchip.6 This SNP chip is useful for identification of candidate genes or QTLs underling quantitative traits such as body composition.7SSRs, or microsatellite, are neutral molecular markers that wildly distribute in a genome. It was formerly proved that SSRs comprise 3% of the human genome, with the greatest contribution from di-nucleotide repeats (0.5%).22 In this study, 45.72% of 11 928 SSRs are di-nucleotide repeats, follows by tri-nucleotide repeats (36.06%) and tetra-nucleotide repeats (14.85%), as well as penta-nucleotide repeats (3.38%). In addition to (AC)n and (AT)n of di-nucleotide repeats, and (AAT)n and (AAC)n of tri-nucleotide, (GT)n and (GTT)n also have high frequencies as indicated by this study, which is different from that of the human genome.22 It is probably because (GT)n and (GTT)n are equal to (AC)n and (ACC)n each, since the reverse strands for some ESTs are used in de novo analysis. In fact, slight differences are found for SSRs among human, mouse and dog, as well as S. scrofa.23In conclusion, we have demonstrated the muscle and ovary transcriptome of S. scrofa by the use of high-throughout 454 pyrosequencing. Our study obtained a set of 121 299 transcripts or ESTs and demonstrated some important features of S. scrofa transcriptome, such as GC content, gene annotation and pathways across whole transcriptome. In addition, we identified reliable markers of 24 214 SNPs and 11 928 SSRs. This study is helpful for understanding the genetic architecture of S. scrofa transcriptome and provides useful resource and markers for functional genomic research in future.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis research was supported by the National Major Special Projects on New Varieties Cultivation for Transgenic Organisms (2008ZX08006-005 and 2009ZX08009-145B) and the Important Projects in Key Fields in Guangdong and Hongkong, 2008 (2008A02).Supplementary data"

These methods reveal two distinct levels of organization of genetic information encoding. It is shown that latent profility in genes may correlate with specific structural features of their encoded proteins.1. IntroductionThe notion of latent periodicity in nucleotide DNA sequences has arisen from the discovery of various regularity levels in the structural organization of a DNA molecule. For example, a DNA double-helix pitch has been found to equal ~10–11 bp, a length of ~200 bp has been found for DNA fragments in nucleosomes, and a loop length of ~2 × 104–105 bp has been determined at the higher level of quasi-regular DNA compactization.1 Such particularities are probably due to non-random alternation of bases in the original DNA sequence. Thus, research on both short- and long-range base correlations2 is of great importance for understanding known structural particularities in DNA sequences and for revealing new ones.Images of various functions demonstrating nucleotide correlations in DNA coding regions show regular peaks with the steps of three bases corresponding to the triplet nature of the genetic code. This has led to the notion of triplet periodicity in the coding regions. It is likely that use of the term ‘latent triplet periodicity’ has also been influenced by the hypothesis on the universal RNY triplet pattern (R, purine; Y, pyrimidine; N, purine or pyrimidine) of codons in ancient genes, because correlations with this pattern can be traced in base distribution over recent coding regions.3In light of the current understanding of latent periodicity as approximate tandem repeats,4 the occurrence of periodicity has been corroborated by textual ‘consensus pattern’, which is an estimate of a pattern in the original repeat. If alterations in the copies of the pattern account for more than 30% of the pattern, the validity of the revealed consensus pattern is in doubt. Although tandem repeats of tri- and hexa-nucleotides occur in coding regions,5,6 as a rule it is impossible to deduce a reliable consensus pattern of an approximate tandem repeat over the whole length of a coding region.Weak three-base periodicity in Escherichia coli mRNA with pattern G-non-G-N, complemented by pattern NNC in 16S RNA, has been considered as a mechanism for monitoring translation frames in ribosomes.7 Despite the discovery of a few short tracks of corresponding patterns, this case would be more accurate to consider only as the domination of G and C bases in corresponding triplet positions. The weak preference of a certain type of base in a fixed position of triplets in the coding region promotes the appearance of a dominant peak in the Fourier spectrum at a frequency of 0.33 corresponding to the three-base period.8 Nevertheless, this preference is not the key cause behind this observation. It appears that the greater the variance of certain base distributions over period positions, the more impact such a base has on the amplitude of spectral density at the three-period frequency, even when the base is not dominant at triplet positions.9 Thus, appearance of the peak at the frequency of 0.33 in the Fourier spectrum is due to non-uniform base distribution over the triplet positions.Use of the Fourier methods for revealing imperfect periodicity8,10–13 has become common. Other statistical methods have also arisen for determining latent periodicity in nucleotide sequences.14–16 These methods are based on measuring heterogeneity in base distributions over period positions.14 In practice, in the absence of weak periodicity in a sequence that is not an approximate tandem repeat, a high index of heterogeneity and a Fourier spectrum with a dominant peak may be observed. It is incorrect in this case to use the term ‘latent periodicity’, until the discovery of a pattern indicating some new type of periodicity, for example, such as the flexible patterns17 of 11th nucleotide periodicity in the genomes of prokaryotes and low eukaryotes.In the present work, a spectral–statistical approach (2S approach)14,18 to identifying a new type of latent periodicity, called profile periodicity or profility, is proposed. The notion of latent profility in DNA sequences has been introduced earlier.14 It expands on the idea of approximate tandem repeat4 in which textual string (DNA sequence) is presented as a chain of eroded copies (with ~80% identity) of the textual pattern. Latent profile periodicity occurs in DNA regions where nucleotide correlations can be described by hypothesizing on the generation of successive uni-length DNA fragments according to a fixed probability distribution of bases appearance at each fragment position. A pattern of latent profility can be described with the aid of a finite random string consisting of independent random characters with corresponding probability distribution for the textual characters from the DNA alphabet. Excepting certain cases, the DNA sequences considered in this work could not be identified as approximate tandem repeats. The usual methods4,19–22 applied for identification of approximate tandem repeats therefore cannot be used to reveal new types of latent periodicity.Via a procedure that identifies patterns of latent profile periodicity in DNA, it is possible to reveal the two levels of organization in encoded genetic information: regular heterogeneity of nucleotide distribution over positions in the codons and latent profility. It is shown that the Fourier analysis does not enable the second level (latent profility) to be distinguished in the genetic encoding. The Fourier spectra for the DNA coding regions have been built using FFT programs,12,13 available from http://www.imtech.res.in/raghava/ftg/.A number of examples are given when the latent profility revealed in the DNA coding regions is translated into features of protein structure. The direct detection of such features is challenging because the goal of the search is not a priori known. The present work shows that it is possible to determine signs of local features in the structure of genes and corresponding proteins through latent profile periodicity (latent profility).2. Methods of identifying latent profile periodicity in DNAIn the proposed model of latent profile periodicity, a DNA sequence (textual string) is considered as a realization of a special random periodic string called a profile string. This string, consisting of independent random characters, represents a perfect tandem repeat of a random string, so called because of its random periodicity pattern. Therefore, in order to determine the latent profile periodicity (profility) in the DNA sequence (textual string), it is necessary to specify the criteria for considering an analysed textual string as a realization of some profile string. The random pattern of such a profile string is not dependent on the quality of the periodicity pattern for the analysed textual string.2.1. Statistical structure of random strings consisting of independent random charactersDNA sequences are considered as textual strings in the four-character (K = 4) simply ordered alphabet <U+2060>, where a is the adenine, g the guanine, t the thymine and c the cytosine.Let  be a random character with the frequency column <U+2060>. Such a character is a random variable that takes the value of the ith character of the alphabet  with a probability of <U+2060>.A special random string  of n independent random characters is induced by the matrix <U+2060>, called an n-profile matrix. Let  be a textual string, where  is the number of a character  in alphabet A. If the str is a realization of the random string <U+2060>, then the product  determines the probability of such a realization.The character  can be identified with a random character for which all components of the frequency column are null, excepting for the ith, which is a unity component. Therefore, any textual string in alphabet A can be identified with the corresponding special random string of the same length.An integer number L from the diapason <U+2060>, where <U+2060>, is called the test-period of the string <U+2060>.Let L be the test-period of random string <U+2060>, and  be a decomposition of string Str into substrings of length L, where  (if <U+2060>, substring  is not complete; if M= 0, substring  is empty). Then, if M= 0, the matrix  is called the L-profile matrix of string Str. If <U+2060>, then corrections are made in the  matrix. Thus, the profile-matrix spectrum <U+2060>, defined at each test-period, is introduced for string Str. The profile-matrix spectrum characterizes the statistical structure of the realizations of random string Str. If the statistical structures of string Str and of analysed textual string str are indistinguishable (at a corresponding level of significance), then it can be considered that the string str is a realization of random string Str. Further methods for verifying this will be proposed on the basis of the latent profile periodicity model.2.2. A stochastic model of the latent profile periodicityOccurrence of the latent profile periodicity in the analysed textual string manifests in the statistical string structure observed in the sample profile-matrix spectrum. In fact, if the analysed string is sufficiently long, this sample spectrum takes the form of the profile-matrix spectrum of periodic random string Str consisting of independent random characters. In this case, random string Str is given by <U+2060>, where L is the period of string Str, <U+2060>,  and <U+2060>. Such a string Str is called the L-profile string with a random periodicity pattern <U+2060>. Moreover, in this case, the designation  is used for the string Str.Matrix  is called the main profile matrix of the string  because matrix  initiates the entire profile-matrix spectrum of this string. Profile string  is a perfect tandem repeat with a random periodicity pattern <U+2060>. The profile-matrix spectrum of the string  can be considered as a stochastic model of heterogeneity manifestation in textual strings that are realizations of the string <U+2060>.2.3. Size estimation for pattern of latent profile periodicity in a textual stringTo estimate the pattern size of the latent profile periodicity, a characteristic spectrum is established for a textual string. Characteristic spectra of the three approximate tandem repeats from the database TRDB (http://tandem.bu.edu/cgi-bin/trdb/) are shown in Fig. 1a–c. In each of these spectra, the first clear maximum arises at the test-period that is a period of approximate tandem repeat. A similar observation is made for the characteristic spectra of textual strings with latent profile periodicity (Fig. 2a–c). Therefore, the first test-period at which the maximum value of the characteristic spectrum for the analysed textual string is clear is used to estimate the pattern size for the latent profile periodicity, or profility.

(d) Fourier spectrum for the coding region of the apolipoprotein mRNA (c) of G. gallus.

Estimation of pattern of latent profile periodicityLet L be the proposed estimation of pattern size for the latent profile periodicity of analysed textual string str of length n in alphabet A of K characters. Then, to estimate the pattern of the latent periodicity in this string, the periodicity pattern of profile string  is proposed. Hence,  is an estimation of the pattern of latent profile periodicity in an analysed string str. If such an estimation is valid then string str is statistically indistinguishable from the profile string TdmL. In this case, string str can be considered a realization of the string TdmL.The hypothesis on the statistical indistinguishability of the strings str and TdmL = TdmL(<U+041F>str(L), n) is accepted if the condition  is met, where  and  is the number of test-periods at which the values of the spectrum <U+2060>. For example, as can be seen in Fig. 3, for the coding region of chicken Gallus gallus Apo A-IV mRNA, the hypothesis is accepted if L= 33, and it is rejected if L= 3.

Results and discussionMethods of identifying a new type of latent periodicity in DNA called latent profile periodicity, or profility, have been proposed in the present work. A characteristic of this profile periodicity is the random nature of its pattern. The profile matrix of the pattern determines statistical periodicity in the appearance of the characters in textual strings. As a result, latent profile periodicity manifests in the analysed string.3.1. Profile-statistical basis of structural domains in protein familiesApplication of the methods proposed in this work enabled us to discover the occurrence of latent profility for the 33 nucleotides (33-profility) in the coding gene regions of the PF01442 apolipoprotein family from the Pfam (http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/) database of protein families. This family contains the apolipoproteins Apo A, Apo C and Apo E, which are members of a multigene family that probably evolved from a common ancestral gene. Apolipoproteins function in lipid transport as structural components of lipoprotein particles, cofactors for enzymes and ligands for cell-surface receptors. The family contains more than 800 protein sequences from ~100 species. In each position of the family, multiple alignment shows an average identity of amino acids of ~30%. By taking this apolipoprotein family as a case study, we can demonstrate a procedure for identifying latent profility.The characteristic spectra of coding regions for the apolipoproteins Apo E of house mouse Mus musculus, Apo A-I of gilt-head sea bream Sparus aurata and Apo A-IV of chicken G. gallus are shown in Fig. 2a–c. In these spectra, the first clear maximum is found at the test-period of the 33 base pairs (bp). Thus, the estimation of a pattern size equal to the 33 bp is proposed. The maximum values in the spectra of deviation from the 33-profility [Equation (3)] do not exceed a figure of one (D33 < 1) that illustrated in Fig. 3a for chicken Apo A-IV. Using the result for the considered coding regions, estimates of patterns for the 33-profile periodicity may be proposed. These estimates are determined by a sample 33-profile matrix of the corresponding analysed region. The reasonableness of each pattern estimate is confirmed by similarity between the spectrum of deviation from homogeneity and its theoretical, or statistical, reconstruction for the analysed coding region. An example of verification of pattern estimation for latent 33-profility in the chicken Apo A-IV coding region is shown in Fig. 4. Comparison of Fig. 4a with d disproves the presence of latent 3-profility in the region, though a peak at frequency 0.33 corresponding to the test-period of 3 bp dominates in the Fourier spectrum (Fig. 2d).To check a robustness of the latent 33-profility pattern estimation found for the coding regions of apolipoproteins the damages in different consecutive segments of 33 bp have been simulated. Every kth (k = 5,4,3,2) segment of the coding region has been substituted by a fragment (of the same length) from homogeneous sequence with equally probable distribution of the nucleotides. The example of analysis of gene sequence with such a noise is shown in Fig. 5 for Apo A-IV mRNA of chicken G. gallus. Spectral–statistical analysis reveals a cutoff in pattern recognition when the sequence damages became equal to 25% (k = 4). In this case, there is a dilemma that what pattern size should be chosen—33 or 66 bp. According to the theoretical reconstructions (Fig. 5c and d) of the spectrum of deviation from homogeneity (Fig. 5b), an estimate of 66 bp appears to be more preferable. Such a preference becomes obvious with 50% of damages when the latent profile periodicity of 66 bp arises naturally. In the analysis done, no essential regions in the apolipoprotein gene sequences were revealed which determinate the occurrence of latent profility in the genes. The latent 33-profility of the apolipoprotein genes seems to be a consequence of consistent statistical low of their structural organization.

The supposition was also made that, before the genes of Apo E, Apo A-I and Apo A-IV were formed by duplication of the general 33-bp unit, copies of the ancient 11-‘pattern’ in the tandem 33-repeat underwent essential mutational alterations. In mouse Apo E mRNA fragment (GenBank M12414, 275–604 bp), 3-, 11- and 33-profility were examined in the present work. It is this fragment for which an ancestral 11-bp sequence was derived previously.23 Using the methods proposed here, only 33-profility has been revealed and confirmed for the fragment. The same conclusion is made for the entire mouse Apo E mRNA sequence. Fig. 6 illustrates the performed analysis. Theoretical reconstructions of the D1 spectra of deviation from homogeneity (Fig. 6a and e) were undertaken with the assumption of the occurrence of latent 33-profility in both the particular fragment and the entire Apo E mRNA (Fig. 6b and f, respectively), follow the corresponding D1 spectra. Theoretical reconstructions (Fig. 6c and g) of the same D1 spectra, undertaken with the assumption of the presence of latent 11-profility in the analysed sequences, are not similar to the corresponding D1 spectra. Moreover, the D11 spectra of deviation from 11-profility (Fig. 6d and h) at numerous test-periods exceed the threshold (D11 > 1), indicating the absence of 11-profility in the analysed sequences. Domination of some nucleotides (more than 50%), revealed earlier23 in four positions (the 2nd, 3rd, 7th and 9th) of the quasi-pattern of the 11 bp, is probably due to structural particularity of textual 33-repeat from the central part (275–604 bp) of mouse Apo E mRNA. In contrast, 33-profility undoubtedly settles a fixed periodicity of appearance for the nucleotides both in the central part and over the whole analysed Apo E mRNA.

Such a spatial organization correlates with the 33-bp profile periodicity of the apolipoprotein genes. The generic size of the pattern of latent profile periodicity in the PF01442 family genes possibly influences the formation of the typical secondary structure for the protein family and agrees well with the hypothesis on family origin from a common ancestral gene.A generic size of ~290 bp for the latent profile periodicity pattern is observed in the genes of fibronectin type III domain-containing protein, which is a protein of an intercellular matrix. It is a glycoprotein that many cells synthesize and secrete into intercellular space. The fibronectin consists of two identical polypeptide chains joined by disulfide bridges near the C-terminuses. Each polypeptide chain contains ~10 domains, each of which holds the specific sites binding the various substances. The proposed spatial structure of the domain contains seven antiparallel ß-strands.24Orthologous genes of the fibronectin type III domain family that have been analysed in the present work are listed in Table 1. Table 2, using data from the KEGG database (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/), shows an identity percentage between pairs of the protein family. In characteristic spectra (e.g. see Fig. 7a) of genes from this family, the generic pattern size of latent profile periodicity is found to be 291 bp. Statistical reconstruction (Fig. 7<U+0441>) corresponding to the pattern size of 291 bp reconstitutes the spectrum of deviation from homogeneity (Fig. 7b), which verifies latent profile periodicity with this period. The pattern size of 291 bp is in good agreement with the size of repeated domains (~90–100 amino acids) in the proteins of the family.

Manifestation of levels of organization of genetic information encodingRegularity of the peaks at 3 bp is observed in the characteristic spectra of the coding regions (Figs 2a–c, 7a and 8). Thus, an encoding organization level caused by the genetic triplet code is manifested. This regularity of a characteristic spectrum is called further as 3-regular heterogeneity, or 3-regularity. As in the Fourier spectra, 3-regular heterogeneity of a characteristic spectrum can be observed in the absence of latent periodicity of 3 bp (see Fig. 2, for example). If 3-regularity exists in the characteristic spectrum of a coding region, then revealing latent profility (different from 3-profility) in the spectrum determines the second level of the encoding organization. For example, Fig. 2a–c shows the characteristic spectra in which, as discussed above (Figs 3 and 4), latent 33-profility is revealed against the background of 3-regularity. The characteristic spectrum for the coding region of cya gene from bacterium B. pertussis (GenBank Y00545, region: 981–6101 bp).The characteristic spectrum for the coding region of cya gene from bacterium B. pertussis (GenBank Y00545, region: 981–6101 bp).An investigation of different levels in the organization of genetic information encoding has been carried out on a sample of 18 140 human coding regions (CDS) from the KEGG GENES-54.1 database (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/genes.html). Only those coding regions were chosen for which there is experimental evidence of protein translation. Open reading frames, hypothetical proteins, tRNA and rRNA, and genes assumed by their sequences to show similarity to other known genes were excluded from the sample. It appears that 3-regularity in the characteristic spectra is fixed for 93% of the sample (16 786 CDS). Against the background of 3-regular heterogeneity, latent 3-profility is revealed for 62% (11 200 CDS) of the original sample. For the 11% of the sample (1953 CDS), two levels of organization of the encoding are manifested (3-regular heterogeneity and the latent profility different from 3-profility).Taking into account the inaccuracy of the statistical methods, the following conclusions can be made from the results obtained. Owing to amino acids triplet encoding, the 3-regular heterogeneity of the characteristic spectra is generic for human genes. However, such regularity is not due to latent periodicity of 3 bp. Thus, it is essential to differentiate between the phenomena of regular heterogeneity and latent periodicity in the genetic sequences. In order to verify the existence of latent periodicity of some type, it is necessary to observe a pattern inducing the periodicity.3.3. Local profile periodicityIn the coding regions, the manifestation of tha local two-level organization of genetic information encoding is possible. Thus, for the whole coding region, 3-regular heterogeneity only is observed (see Fig. 8, for example). Regions with local profile periodicity (local profility) can be revealed by scanning the sequence with a small window. For example, regarding local profility in the coding region of the cya gene from the bacterium Bordetella pertussis (GenBank Y00545, 981–6101 bp), in the entire coding region, 3-regular heterogeneity only is revealed (Fig. 8), and there is no latent profility. Latent profile periodicity is observed solely in local areas of the coding regions. Three local areas of latent profile periodicity with a period of 27 bp (Figs 9a–c and 10) can be distinguished in the coding region of the cya gene of bacterium B. pertussis.

(b) A spectrum of theoretical reconstruction of the D1 spectrum in (a) assuming the presence of 27-profility in the local area.Let us note again that the first level of encoding is manifested in the 3-regularity of characteristic spectrum (Fig. 9a–c) and in existence of dominant peak at frequency equal to 0.33 in the Fourier spectrum (see, for example, Fig. 9d). The second level of encoding organization—the 27-profile periodicity—in the local areas of the cya gene is pointed at by the dominant peaks of characteristic spectra. Such a profile periodicity is proved by reconstruction of the spectrum of deviation from homogeneity in every local area (see, for example, Fig. 10a and b). In contrast to the characteristic spectra, the second level of encoding organization is not manifested in the Fourier spectra (see, for example, Fig. 9d).The cya gene encodes bifunctional hemolysin/adenylate cyclase (UniProtKB P15318) in which the areas corresponding to the gene local 27-profility hold the hemolysin-type calcium-binding sites. These sites have a periodic structure of 18 amino acid residues (Fig. 11) corresponding to 54 bp (2 × 27 bp) in the gene.

ConclusionsMethods for identifying a new type of latent periodicity—latent profility in DNA—have been proposed. For DNA coding regions, latent profility enables us to distinguish two levels of organization of genetic information encoding. The first level (the triplet level of encoding), revealed via the Fourier analysis techniques, indicates the phenomenon of regular heterogeneity in the DNA coding regions. The second level of organization in the encoding is due to latent profile periodicity of the DNA sequence. It has been shown that latent profile periodicity in genes of the same family may correlate with the structural features of encoded proteins. Such an effect may manifest in the local areas of coding regions where latent profile periodicity is observed."

IntroductionAutophagy is a highly evolutionarily conserved cellular degradation process common to organisms from yeast to plants and animals.1,2 The autophagy process can be broken down into a series of steps, including induction, cargo recognition and packaging, vesicle nucleation, vesicle expansion and completion, autophagy-associated protein cycling, vesicle fusion with the vacuole/lysosome, vesicle breakdown, and recycling of the macromolecules.2,3 In the process, the macromolecules or organelles are sequestered into a double-membrane vesicle, called an autophagosome, and finally delivered into the vacuole/lysosome for breakdown.1,2The genes involved in this pathway are called autophagy-associated genes (ATG). In yeast, at least 32 ATGs have been identified and shown to participate in the autophagy process.1,4 The knowledge concerning the machinery and molecular mechanism of autophagy mainly comes from yeast.1,2 Autophagy is maintained at a basal level under normal growth conditions but can be induced in response to nutritional demand, biotic or abiotic stresses, and senescence, thereby relieving the cell from various stress conditions. Autophagy also plays a critical role during cellular development and differentiation.Many orthologues of ATGs have been identified in higher eukaryotes. In Arabidopsis thaliana, 25 homologues to 12 yeast ATGs essential for autophagy have been discovered.5 They have essentially similar biochemical roles as those in yeast.2 In plants, autophagy is important in the formation and degradation of protein storage vacuoles during seed development and germination, de novo vacuolar biogenesis, nutrient recycling during starvation, senescence, apoptotic processes such as xylem and sclerid cell morphogenesis, and the pathogen-induced hypersensitive response.6 Some of these roles have been demonstrated by the phenotypic analyses of ATG-knockdown transgenic plants. RNAi-AtATG18a transgenic pants are hypersensitive to oxidative stress, suggesting a physiological role for this gene in response to this stress.7 When Arabidopsis-null mutants of AtATG5, AtATG7, AtATG9, and AtATG4 are grown under either carbon- or nitrogen-deficient conditions, the mutants exhibit the abnormal phenotypes of chlorosis, bolting, and senescence.6AtATG6 is essential for pollen germination, and disruption of AtATG6 by T-DNA insertion causes male sterility, as AtATG6-deficient pollen develops normally but does not germinate.8In the Arabidopsis, rice and corn (Zea mays) genomes, some ATG homologues have been found, indicating that comparable autophagy systems exist in plants.7,9 However, there are some differences between plants and yeast in the number of paralogues of ATGs. The Arabidopsis genome has nine AtATG8s, whereas yeast has just one ATG8. The nine AtATG8s10,11 and the eight AtATG18s7 show differential expression patterns, indicating their diverse roles. Although extensive studies have revealed the roles of some ATGs and the underlying mechanisms in plants, there is a lack of systematic analysis of ATGs in plants and their expression patterns under normal growth and stress conditions. In this study, 33 putative rice ATGs (OsATG homologues) were identified in the rice genome, and their expression profiles under normal growth conditions and stress treatments were analysed with semi-quantitative RT–PCR and mining the rice expression database. This study gives a systematic clue to investigate the physiological functions of OsATG homologues and forms a basis for further studies of the OsATG family in rice.2. Materials and methods2.1. Identification of OsATG homologuesA preliminary search for OsATG homologues was performed using the key word ‘autophagy’ in the Rice Annotation Project Database (RAP-DB, http://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/). Another approach was to search for OsATG homologues using BLASTP in RAP-DB and the NCBI database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) with yeast ATG proteins downloaded from Pfam 24.0 (release October 2009) (http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/). In addition, eight OsATG homologues from a previous publication9 were also included in our analysis. After removing the redundant genes, all putative OsATG homologues were searched in the Pfam database to confirm the presence of ATG domains. The corresponding full-length cDNAs and the predicted proteins of these OsATG homologues were downloaded from the KOME full-length cDNA database (http://cdna01.dna.affrc.go.jp/cDNA/) or NCBI. The information of all the analysed putative OsATG homologues is listed in Supplementary Table S1.2.2. Chromosomal localization and gene duplicationThe OsATG homologues were positioned on the rice chromosomes using BLASTN at the Rice Genome Annotation Project website (MSU-RGA, http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/analyses_search_blast.shtml). The OsATG homologues present on the duplicated chromosomal segments were identified by segmental genome duplication of rice available at MSU-RGA with the maximum distance permitted between collinear gene pairs of 100 kb. The OsATG homologues separated by a maximum of five genes were identified as tandem duplicated genes.2.3. Protein sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysisMultiple sequence alignments of amino acid sequences were performed using ClustalX (version 2.0.9). The unrooted phylogenetic trees were generated by the neighbour-joining (NJ) method using ClustalX and with the p-distance substitution model in MEGA 4.12 Bootstrap analysis was performed with 1000 replicates to obtain a support value for each branch.2.4. Analysis of gene and protein structureScans for the active sites of OsATG homologues were performed using PROSITE (http://www.expasy.ch/tools/scanprosite/). Exon–intron organization was determined using the genome browser tool in RAP-DB. Gene structure was manually assessed for each predicted OsATG homologue. The isoelectric point and molecular weight were estimated using the tools from ExPASy (http://us.expasy.org/tools/protparam.html).2.5. Plant materials and growth conditionsThe rice cultivar Zhonghua 11 (Oryza sativa L. japanica) was used in this study. For expression analyses of OsATG homologues under normal conditions, total RNA was extracted from different tissues of the rice plants, grown in the natural field of South China Botanical Garden.For various treatments, seeds were soaked in water and germinated at 28°C for 2 days and then grown in Hoagland's solution13 for 3 weeks. For salt treatment, 3-week-old seedlings were grown in Hoagland's solution containing 250 mM NaCl for 4 h; for cold treatment, the seedlings were kept at 4°C for 4 h; for drought treatment, the seedlings were dried for 4 h between folds of tissue paper at 28 ± 1°C; for carbohydrate starvation, the seedlings were kept in the dark for 48 h; for gibberellic acid (GA3), 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (an auxin; 2,4-D), kinetin (a cytokinin; KT), or abscisic acid (ABA) treatment, the seedlings were cultured in Hoagland's solution containing 5 µM GA3, 5 µM 2,4-D, 5 µM KT, or 25 µM ABA, respectively, for 24 h.For nitrogen treatment, Zhonghua 11 seeds were sterilized with 70% ethanol for 1 min, followed by 2.5% sodium hypochlorite containing one drop of Tween 20 per 50 ml for 25 min, then rinsed five times with sterile distilled water. The sterilized seeds were inoculated on 1/2 MS solid medium14 containing 1% sucrose and cultured under a 16/8 h light/dark cycle for 10 days. On the 10th day, some rice seedlings were washed and subcultured on NO3--free solid medium for 7 days. NO3--free medium was a modification of MS salts in which the macronutrient composition was changed to 3 mM KCl, 0.15 mM CaCl2, 0.075 mM MgSO4, 0.0625 mM KH2PO4, 0.5 mM NH4Cl, and 0.5 mM succinic acid. Within 7 days, two changes of medium were made to deplete stored nitrate in the plants. After that, some seedlings were subcultured into liquid nitrate induction medium. NaNO3 was added to a final concentration of 25 mM for nitrate induction, and plants were collected at a series of time points. For ammonium induction, NO3--free medium used on the 10th day was replaced by nitrogen starvation solution (NO3--free medium minus 0.5 mM NH4Cl), and 5 mM NH4Cl was used as the nitrogen source. After collection, all samples were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C for subsequent RNA extractions. The seedlings were grown in normal MS medium as a control.The growth conditions, treatments, and experiments on the plant materials in the digital expression database could be referenced to published papers15,16 and the web page (http://bioinformatics.med.yale.edu/riceatlas/overview.jspx).2.6. Semi-quantitative RT–PCR analysisTotal RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen, http://www.invitrogen.com). First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 3 µg of total RNA from each sample using M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega, http://www.promega.com). The first-strand cDNA was used as a template for semi-quantitative PCR analysis after normalization using rice Actin1 (accession no. AB047313). The appropriate amount of template cDNA and number of PCR cycles were determined for each gene to ensure that amplification occurred in the linear range and that amplified products were quantified accurately. All primer sequences used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table S2. To ensure that the primers were specific for the correct OsATG homologues, primers were designed using software Primer Primier v5.00 (PREMIER Biosoft International). Some of the amplification products obtained with the different primer pairs were purified from the gel and sequenced, then the sequences were aligned on the RAP-DB website to make sure that they were specific. The PCR products were analysed on 1% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide and visualized using the Fluorescence Chemiluminescence and Visible Imaging System. The RT–PCR bands were digitalized using Gel-Pro Analyzer (Media Cybernetics Inc.), and the expression values of OsATG homologues were normalized using the band values of the rice Actin1 gene.2.7. Digital expression analysis of OsATG homologuesFour approaches were used in digital expression analysis of OsATG homologues. The Rice Expression Profile Database (RiceXPro) (http://ricexpro.dna.affrc.go.jp/index.html) is a repository of gene expression data derived from microarray experiments encompassing the entire life cycle of the rice plant from the germination, seedling, tillering, stem elongation, panicle initiation, booting, heading, flowering, and ripening stages.17 The expression of OsATG homologues from this database is summarized in Supplementary Fig. S1.Second, the massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS) database was searched at the rice MPSS project (http://mpss.udel.edu/rice/) for 20-base signatures from 22 mRNA libraries representing 18 different tissues/organs in rice expression evidence analysis.15 Only the signatures that uniquely identified an individual gene and showed a perfect match (100% identity over 100% of the length of the tag) were used for the analysis. The normalized abundance (tags per million, tpm) of these signatures for a given gene in a given library represents the quantitative estimate of the expression of that gene. The tissue expression results from this database are listed in Supplementary Table S3, and the results from the rice plants infected by Xanthomonas oryzae and Magnaporthe grisea are listed in Supplementary Table S4. The results from the rice plants under abiotic stresses are listed in Supplementary Table S5.Third, the cellular expression profile data of OsATG homologues were extracted from Yale Virtual Center for Cellular Expression Profiling16 of Rice (http://bioinformatics.med.yale.edu/riceatlas/overview.jspx.) using gene locus IDs. This analysed result is listed in Supplementary Tables S6–S9.Fourth, the rice microarray data were extracted from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) using OsATG locus IDs. The data from the series accession number GSE4471 were the expression profiles of 1-week-old roots from rice varieties Azucena and Bala following treatment with 1 ppm sodium arsenate.18 The data from GSE3053 were the expression data from salt-tolerant (FL478) and salt-sensitive (IR29) rice plants treated with salt.19 The data from GSE5167 were the expression profile when the rice was treated with cytokinin.20 The OsATG expression results from these data are listed in Supplementary Table S10.2.8. Ka/Ks analysis and calculation of the dates of the duplication eventsThe number of non-synonymous substitutions per non-synonymous site (Ka) and the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (Ks) of duplicated genes were analysed by DnaSP Version 5. The dates of the duplication events were calculated by the equation T = Ks/2<U+03BB>, for rice, <U+03BB> = 6.5 × 10-9.21,223. Results and discussion3.1. Identification of 33 OsATG homologues in the rice genomeNumerous studies in A. thaliana have suggested that autophagic processes occur in plants;2 however, the knowledge of ATGs in plants is still lacking. The availability of complete rice genome sequences provides the possibility of identifying OsATG family members in rice. Here, we identified a total of 33 putative OsATG homologues in rice (Supplementary Table S1, Fig. 1). All of them were predicted to play roles in the autophagy process, including from the first step of induction to the last step of vesicle fusion with the vacuole/lysosome.1 Among the 33 OsATG homologues, 23 were identified from RAP-DB build 5: OsATG1a, OsATG1b, OsATG1c, OsATG3b, OsATG4b, OsATG5, OsAT G6a, OsATG6b, OsATG7, OsATG8d, OsATG8e, OsATG8f, OsATG9a, OsATG9b, OsATG13a, OsATG13b, OsATG16, OsATG18a, OsATG18b, OsATG18c, OsATG18d, OsAT G18e, and OsATG18f. Eight (OsATG3a, OsATG4a, OsATG8a, OsATG8b, OsATG8c, OsATG10a, OsATG10b, and OsATG12) were cited from Chung et al.9 Then we used the above OsATG proteins as queries to search NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) by BLASTP and finally identified two other OsATG homologues, OsATG6c and OsATG8i. However, OsATG8i could not be mapped to the rice genome. OsATG8f had a gene locus ID in RAP-DB, but not in the MSU Rice Genome Sequence Annotation Project Database (http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/index.shtml), and OsATG8f had no corresponding full-length cDNA. Six genes (OsATG1a, OsATG1b, OsATG9a, OsATG18a, OsATG18c, and OsATG18f) are alternatively spliced genes (Supplementary Table S1).

The OsATG homologues present on duplicated chromosomal segments between two chromosomes are connected by lines.To confirm the 33 OsATG homologues as ATG-like homologues and identify their domains, the predicated OsATG protein sequences were analysed for Pfam matches in the Pfam database.1,23 The 33 OsATG proteins could be classified into 13 ATG classes by their phylogenetic relationships (Supplementary Fig. S2) and their active domains (Supplementary Table S1). These suggested that all 33 OsATG homologues could be considered as ATGs. However, OsATG3b was matched with ATG3 but lacked a C-terminus domain present in ATG3, and OsATG10a was classified into the ATG10 subfamily but only had the active-site domain of ATG10. In addition, the number of members among the 13 ATG subfamilies was uneven in rice; the ATG8 and ATG18 subfamilies (with seven and eight OsATG members, respectively) of rice had more copies than other subfamilies, whereas four subfamilies (ATG5, ATG7, ATG12, and ATG16) had only a single OsATG member each; other ATG subfamilies had two to three members (Supplementary Table S1). Some homologues of these OsATGs were also identified in indica rice, and they were tightly clustered with their corresponding homologues in japonica rice (Fig. 2). Phylogenetic relationships of nine ATG subfamilies among rice and other species. The unrooted tree was constructed using the ClustalX program based on the multiple sequence alignment of the ATG protein sequences by the NJ method. The number at each node represents the bootstrap value from 1000 replicates. Accession numbers of OsATG homologues are given in Supplementary Table S1, and gi numbers of ATG proteins from other species are given.Phylogenetic relationships of nine ATG subfamilies among rice and other species.

Genomic organization and expansion of OsATG homologuesThe physical locations of the 33 OsATG homologues could be assigned to the 12 rice chromosomes, except OsATG8i (Fig. 1). The distribution of these OsATG homologues among the chromosomes appeared to be uneven. Four chromosomes (1, 2, 3, and 4) harboured a total of 20 OsATG homologues, each with four to six OsATG homologues, whereas four chromosomes (6, 7, 10, and 11) harboured only one OsATG homologue each. Each of the other four chromosomes had two OsATG homologues. Only one pair of OsATG homologues (OsATG1a and OsATG1b) was located in the tandem region of chromosome 3. On the other hand, five pairs (10 members) of OsATG homologues were located on duplicated chromosomal segments of rice chromosomes: OsATG8b and OsATG8c, OsATG8e and OsATG8f, OsATG9a and OsATG9b, OsATG13a and OsATG13b, and OsATG18b and OsATG18d. The distribution of these OsATG homologues relative to duplicated chromosomal segments in rice is illustrated with lines in Fig. 1.Nine of 13 rice ATG subfamilies contain more than one homologue members (Supplementary Fig. S2). To investigate the phylogenetic relationships of the different ATG subfamilies with multiple copy members in rice, the unrooted trees of nine ATG subfamilies were constructed from alignments of their full-length amino acid sequences in rice and other plants (Fig. 2). We found that all ATGs from monocots in six ATG subfamilies (ATG3, ATG4, ATG6, ATG9, ATG10, and ATG13) could be clustered within the monocot clades with high bootstrap values (Fig. 2B–D, F–H). In addition, the members of these six subfamilies had similar gene structures within their subfamilies (Supplementary Fig. S3). These data suggest that the member diversification within the six ATG subfamilies might have occurred after the divergence of monocots and dicots. Further, the two members of each of the OsATG3, OsATG4, and OsATG10 subfamilies were not split by other monocots (Fig. 2B, C, and G), indicating that their member divergence occurred after the divergence of the cereals. On the other hand, the two members of each of the OsATG9 and OsATG13 subfamilies were split by other monocots, suggesting that the member diversification of the OsATG9 and OsATG13 subfamilies might have occurred before the divergence of the cereals (Fig. 2F and H). Within the ATG6 subfamily (Fig. 2D), the phylogenetic relationship of OsATG6b to OsATG6c was closer than either of them to OsATG6a, suggesting that the diversification of OsATG6a from OsATG6b and OsATG6c might have occurred earlier than the divergence of OsATG6b from OsATG6c.We found that the OsATG homologues of the other three ATG subfamilies (ATG1, ATG8, and ATG18) were split by dicots. Within the ATG1 subfamily (Fig. 2A), OsATG1a was separated from OsATG1b and OsATG1c by the dicots, but OsATG1b and OsATG1c were clustered tightly. This indicates that the divergence of OsATG1a from OsATG1b and OsATG1c might have occurred before the diversification of the monocots and the dicots, but OsATG1b and OsATG1c might have diverged after the diversification of the monocots and dicots (Fig. 2A). Within the OsATG8 subfamily (Fig. 2E), seven OsATG8s were clustered into three groups (I: OsATG8a; II: OsATG8b and OsATG8c; III: OsATG8d, OsATG8i, OsATG8f, and OsATG8e), and the three groups were split by the dicots, indicating that the divergence of the three groups might have occurred before the divergence of the monocots and dicots. OsATG8b and OsATG8c of Group II were split by the monocots but not by the dicots, which indicates that the divergence of OsATG8b and OsATG8c might have occurred after the divergence of the monocots and dicots and before the divergence of the cereals. The four members of Group III (OsATG8d, OsATG8i, OsATG8f, and OsATG8e) were split by the dicots, which suggests that the divergence of OsATG8d and OsATG8i from OsATG8f and OsATG8e might have occurred before the divergence of the monocots and dicots. The phylogenetic distances from Group III to Groups I and II were large, indicating that the divergence of OsATG8d, OsATG8i, OsATG8f, and OsATG8e from OsATG8a, OsATG8b, and OsATG8c might have occurred very early. Within the ATG18 subfamily (Fig. 2I), six OsATG homologues could also be clustered into three groups, which were split by the dicots, indicating that the divergence of the three groups of the ATG18 subfamily might have occurred before the divergence of the monocots and dicots. With Group II of the ATG18 subfamily, OsATG18b, OsATG18c, and OsATG18d were mixed with the ATGs of dicots and monocots, suggesting that their divergence might have occurred before the divergence of the monocots and dicots; however, two members of Group III (OsATG18e and OsATG18f) were clustered into the monocots, suggesting that their divergence might have occurred after the divergence of the monocots and dicots.3.3. Ka/Ks analysis and calculation for the date of the duplication eventsThe Ka/Ks ratio is a measure to explore the mechanism of gene divergence after duplication. Ka/Ks = 1 means neutral selection, Ka/Ks < 1 means purifying selection, and Ka/Ks > 1 means accelerated evolution with positive selection.24 We calculated six duplicated pairs in the ATG family (Table 1). The Ka/Ks ratios of OsATG13a/OsATG13b, OsATG8b/OsATG8c, OsATG8e/OsATG8f, and OsATG1a/OsATG1b were <1, suggesting purifying selection on these four duplicated pairs. For the other two duplicated pairs, OsATG9a/OsATG9b and OsATG18a/OsATG18d, the Ka/Ks ratios were >1, suggesting positive selection on the two duplicated pairs. Ka/Ks analysis and estimate of the absolute dates for the duplication events between the duplicated OsATG homologuesKa/Ks analysis and estimate of the absolute dates for the duplication events between the duplicated OsATG homologuesWe also calculated the dates of the duplication events (Table 1). All duplication events occurred after the origin of the grasses.25,26 Duplication events for the pairs OsATG8b/OsATG8c and OsATG8e/OsATG8f occurred within last 70–55 million years, according to the first whole-genome duplication events of grass genomes.27,28 Latest duplication event was the duplication of OsATG18a/OsATG18d among all the duplicated OsATG homologues, which might occur ~21.43 million years ago.3.4. Differential expression of OsATG homologues under normal growth conditionsAutophagy plays critical roles during cellular development and differentiation and may be linked to life-span extension,1 even under normal growth conditions without the imposition of environmental stresses.4,6 Three approaches were used to investigate the expression of OsATG homologues in various organs or in different cell types and at different developmental stages. First, semi-quantitative RT–PCR amplified all 33 OsATG homologues from at least one tissue when the rice plants were grown under normal conditions from the seedling stage to the booting stage (Fig. 3), including the three OsATG homologues (OsATG6c, OsATG8d, and OsATG8f) whose corresponding mRNAs could not be found in GenBank (Supplementary Table S1). At the booting stage, 22 genes were expressed in all five tested organs: roots, culms, flag leaf blades, young panicles, and leaf sheaths. The other 11 genes were expressed in one to four tissues. At the seedling stage, all 33 OsATG homologues were expressed in roots, culms, and leaf blades. Notably, the expression patterns of some OsATG homologues showed differences from the seedling stage to the booting stage, such as OsATG3a being expressed in the culms of the seedlings but not in the culms of the booting plants. Second, the expression data of 22 OsATG homologues could be extracted using the gene locus ID search from the leaf expression profiles throughout the entire growth period in the field at RiceXPro,17 and their expression data were used to construct a heatmap. The heatmap showed that all 22 OsATG homologues were expressed in at least one growth stage throughout life (Supplementary Fig. S1). Notably, their expression levels were not very high in the chip data. Third, the Yale Virtual Center for Cellular Expression Profiling of Rice16 was also used to analyse the cellular expression of the OsATG homologues available in this database. In most tissues, the OsATG homologues were expressed in nearly all cell types, from the scutellum to the radicle of the germinating rice seeds (Supplementary Table S6), the different meristem tissues (Supplementary Table S7), from the bulliform to the vein of the leaves (Supplementary Table S8), and from the lateral root cap to the vascular bundle of the roots (Supplementary Table S9). All of these data indicate that the OsATG homologues are expressed in different typical cells of all rice tissues at various developmental stages.

Total RNAs were from different organs when the rice plants were grown under normal growth conditions. R, roots; C, culms; L, leaf blades; Yp, young panicles; Sh, leaf sheaths.

The accession numbers of mRNAs on the right side indicate that the bands from RT–PCR were actually amplified by the primers, and the NA indicates that this gene has no mRNA record in GenBank.Transgenic Arabidopsis plants with five AtATG8 promoters have shown that in plants, the cellular processes involving the AtATG8 genes function efficiently in young, non-senescing tissues, both under favourable growth conditions and under starvation stress.29 The expression analyses of OsATG homologues under normal conditions provided a strong indication of the roles of autophagy in plant cell development and differentiation even under normal growth conditions. However, the roles of plant autophagy under normal conditions have come into question because of the lack of an obvious growth phenotype of the ATG mutants.30 This sharply contrasts with their animal counterparts.4 The reasons for this distinction may be as follows. Most plants have several homologues of each ATG gene. For example, rice has seven OsATG8 homologues and eight OsATG18 homologues,7 respectively, and their homologues, such as OsATG8a, OsATG8b, and OsATG8c, are sometimes expressed at the same time in the same tissues (Fig. 3, Supplementary Table S3). This may result in functional complementation for a single ATG mutant. However, disruption of the Arabidopsis single-copy gene ATG5 or ATG7 also produces no phenotype under normal conditions;31 therefore, other, unknown mechanisms may explain the lack of ATG mutant phenotypes in plants.However, by analysing the cycle numbers in semi-quantitative RT–PCR and the digital expression data (Supplementary Table S3), we found differences in the expression levels of some OsATG homologues. OsATG8a, OsATG8b, and OsATG8c were expressed more highly than OsATG8e (Fig. 3, Supplementary Table S3). Further, we found that an OsATG8b mutant showed the phenotype of delayed flowering time in rice, but it lacked an obvious growth phenotype under normal growth conditions (data not shown). OsATG10a and OsATG10b share significant sequence similarity and are ubiquitously expressed in all organs,32 but we found that they were expressed differently in the organs at the booting developmental stage (Fig. 3). Nine AtATG8s of Arabidopsis also show distinct spatial and temporal expression patterns in roots and in young, non-senescing tissues, both under favourable growth conditions and under starvation stresses.29 These observations indicate that the different ATG homologues, even within the same ATG subfamily, might play various roles in rice even under normal growth conditions.3.5. Differential expression of OsATG homologues in response to hormone treatmentsTo monitor the responses of OsATG homologues to various hormones, their expression was investigated by semi-quantitative RT–PCR. A total of 31 OsATG homologues could be amplified in 3-week-old rice seedlings subjected to various hormone treatments, including 2,4-D, KT, ABA, and GA3. The fold-change values of the OsATG homologues are given in Fig. 4, considering the expression levels of the control (water) as 1. Thirty OsATG homologues showed differential expression in at least one pair of tissues or at least one hormone treatment compared with the control, except OsATG8c. However, the expression response patterns of these OsATG homologues to hormones were complex. Most of the OsATG homologues showed various degrees of down-regulation by GA3, but the alternatively spliced AK070612 mRNA form of OsATG9a was up-regulated by at least 8-fold in all the three organs (Fig. 4H). For the other three hormone treatments, the OsATG homologues exhibited differential patterns of up- and down-regulation. Interestingly, some OsATG homologues showed different responses to the same hormone in various organs. For example, the expression of OsATG8d was down-regulated about 10-fold in roots, while it was up-regulated at least 5-fold in sheathes and more than 2-fold in leaves after 2,4-D treatment (Fig. 4G). The digital expression results after KT treatment were analysed, and they were consistent with our semi-quantitative RT–PCR results (Supplementary Table S10). Semi-quantitative RT–PCR analysis of the relative expression levels of rice OsATG homologues under various hormone treatments. Three-week-old seedlings were irrigated with Hoagland's solution containing 5 µM gibberellic acid (GA3), 5 µM 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), 5 µM KT, or 25 µM ABA for 24 h. Expression levels in treated seedlings were normalized to those of the water-treated seedlings, whose expression levels were defined as 1. A gene name with two or more mRNA accession numbers in the parentheses indicates that this set of primers could amplify two or more alternatively spliced mRNA forms; a gene name without an mRNA accession number indicates that this gene has no mRNA record in GenBank; the same applies to Figs 5 and 6.Semi-quantitative RT–PCR analysis of the relative expression levels of rice OsATG homologues under various hormone treatments.

Our results clearly show that OsATG homologues might play important roles in responses to various plant hormones. Jain et al.33 postulated that disruption of cytokinin flux to detached leaves triggers the selective degradation of carbonylated proteins via autophagy. Our results may have implications for the linkage between autophagy and hormones in the control of protein mobilization and in response to changes in nitrogen availability.3.6. Differential expression of OsATG homologues in response to stress treatmentsTo gain insight into the comprehensive roles of OsATG family members in response to various stresses, their expression patterns were investigated in rice seedlings subjected to salt, drought, cold, and dark treatments by semi-quantitative RT–PCR (Fig. 5). The responses of OsATG homologues to arsenate and salt stresses (Supplementary Tables S5 and S10) were also analysed using the digital expression data. Among 31 OsATG homologues, 30 showed differential expression in at least one tissue or at least one stress treatment compared with the control, and only the alternatively spliced AK069243 form of OsATG1a and OsATG16 did not show differential expression in response to any stress treatments (Fig. 5A and L), when judged by at least 2-fold increased or decreased expression change. Some OsATG homologues were only regulated by a specific stress condition; however, others were regulated by more than one stress condition. Relative expression levels of rice OsATG homologues under abiotic stresses. Three-week-old rice seedlings under normal growth conditions were the control. Expression levels in treated seedlings were normalized to those of the control seedlings, whose expression levels were defined as 1. For salt treatment, the seedlings were kept in a 250 mM NaCl solution for 4 h. For drought treatment, seedlings were dried for 4 h between folds of tissue paper at 28 ± 1°C. For cold treatment, the seedlings were kept at 4 ± 1°C for 4 h. For dark treatment, seedlings were kept in the dark for 48 h.Relative expression levels of rice OsATG homologues under abiotic stresses.

For cold treatment, the seedlings were kept at 4 ± 1°C for 4 h. For dark treatment, seedlings were kept in the dark for 48 h.In response to salt treatment, 13 OsATG homologues (OsATG1a, OsATG 4a, OsATG6c, OsATG7, OsATG8a, OsATG8d, OsATG8f, OsATG9a, OsATG18a, OsATG18c, OsATG18d, OsATG18e, and OsATG18f) were up-regulated and 13 OsATG homologues (OsATG1a, OsATG3a, OsATG6c, OsATG8b, OsATG8c, OsATG8f, OsATG9b, OsATG10a, OsATG12, OsATG13b, OsATG18b, and OsATG18f) were down-regulated (Fig. 5). Notably, the expression changes of the different alternatively spliced mRNA forms of OsATG3a showed different response to the salt treatment, and the expression changes of OsATG6c, OsATG8d, and OsATG in the roots and the leaves showed different response to the salt treatment. In response to drought treatment, 13 OsATG homologues (OsATG1a, OsATG3b, OsATG4a, OsATG4b, OsATG6b, OsATG6c, OsATG7, OsATG8d, OsATG8f, OsATG9a, OsATG9b, OsATG18a, and OsAT G18f) were up-regulated and 9 OsATG homologues (OsATG1a, OsATG6c, OsATG8a, OsATG8b, OsATG8d, OsATG8f, OsATG8i, OsATG13b, and OsATG18f) were down-regulated. In response to cold treatment, most (21) of the OsATG homologues were down-regulated and three genes (OsATG3a, OsATG4a, and OsATG8a) were up-regulated, only 10 OsATG homologues (OsATG1b, OsATG3b, OsATG4b, OsATG5, OsATG8b, OsATG10a, OsATG13a, OsATG16, OsATG18a, and OsATG18c) did not respond to the cold treatment. In response to 48 h dark treatment, 19 OsATG homologues were up-regulated and 8 OsATG homologues were down-regulated. Notably, the expression changes of OsATG8d in the roots and the leaves showed different response to the dark treatment, and six OsATG homologues (OsATG1a, OsATG6a, OsATG6b, OsATG8c, OsATG12, and OsATG16) did not respond to the dark treatment. Through mining the digital expression data, only OsATG5 and OsATG18e showed differential expression under arsenate treatment (Supplementary Table S10).We also analysed the responses of OsATG homologues to infection with M. grisea or X. oryzae, which causes severe loss to rice yield. We mined the rice expression database to determine their expression fold changes (Supplementary Table S4). The microarray data and the infection with M. grisea or X. oryzae were published previously.15 We found that some OsATG homologues (OsATG3a, OsATG3b, OsATG4b, and OsATG18e) showed differential responses to the disease infection between the resistant and the susceptible reactions.High salt and osmotic stresses induce autophagy in an A. thaliana, and autophagy-defective RNAi-AtATG18a plants are more sensitive to salt and drought conditions than wild-type plants, demonstrating a role for autophagy in response to these stresses.34 Recent evidence suggests that autophagy is also necessary for the proper regulation of hypersensitive response-programmed cell death during the plant innate immune response.35–37 Together, these data suggest that autophagy plays roles in the responses of plants to biological and abiotic stresses.3.7. Differential expression of OsATG homologues under nitrogen and carbon starvationIn plants, autophagy is important for nutrient remobilization during sugar and nitrogen starvation and leaf senescence.37,38 To gain insight into the roles of OsATG homologues during nitrogen starvation conditions, their expression patterns were investigated in rice seedlings subjected to NH4+ and NO3- starvation (Fig. 6I and II). For 48 h nitrate starvation, 18 OsATG homologues were up-regulated and 10 OsATG homologues were down-regulated in at least one organ. For 48 h ammonium starvation, 18 OsATG homologues were up-regulated and 8 OsATG homologues were down-regulated in at least one organ (Fig. 6I and II). Notably, the expression change of some OsATGs was different in response to ammonium and nitrate treatments. The most-changed expression levels in response to ammonium included AK069206 of OsATG1a, AK069012 of OsATg4b, OsATG8d and AK072244 of OsATG18f (Fig. 6IA, C, G, and M); however, the most-changed expression levels in response to nitrate treatment were AK069243 of OsATG1a, OsATG6c, OsATG8d, and AK072244 of OsATG18f (Fig. 6IIA, B, G, and M). Relative expression levels of OsATG homologues in response to ammonium (I) and nitrate (II) treatments. Ten-day-old seedlings were transferred to nitrogen-free medium (-NH4+ or -NO3-) containing modified MS salts for 7 days for nitrogen starvation, then part of these seedlings were transferred to MS medium containing NH4+ or NO3- (+NH4+ or +NO3-) as the nitrogen source. Total RNAs were extracted from these treated seedlings for RT–PCR. Expression levels in treated seedlings were normalized to those of the control seedlings grown under normal conditions, whose expression levels were defined as 1.Relative expression levels of OsATG homologues in response to ammonium (I) and nitrate (II) treatments.

To monitor the responses of OsATG homologues to dark-induced carbohydrate starvation, we analysed the expression changes of OsATG homologues when the rice plants were kept in the dark for 48 h. We found that 17 OsATG homologues were up-regulated and 10 OsATG homologues were down-regulated by dark treatment (Fig. 5). Notably, 15 OsATG homologues were up-regulated only in the roots, but not in the leaves, while OsATG8a and OsATG18a were up-regulated in both the roots and the leaves after 48 h dark treatment (Fig. 5). In Arabidopsis, AtATG4a, AtATG4b,41 and AtATG95 are up-regulated in response to dark-induced carbohydrate starvation. In rice, OsATG4a, OsATG4b, OsATG9a, and OsATG9b were up-expressed by dark treatment, indicating that they are involved in dark-induced carbohydrate starvation. Our results indicate that as in other plants, most OsATG homologues are required to maintain cellular viability under nutrient-limited conditions and for efficient nutrient use in the whole plant.73.8. Expression divergence of duplicated OsATG homologuesGene duplication leads to functional redundancy and diversification.42 Under normal conditions (Fig. 3), the tandem duplicated pair OsATG1a and OsATG1b was both alternatively spliced and showed various expression patterns among the different alternative splice forms. The pair OsATG8b and OsATG8c did not show significant expression difference. For the pair OsATG8e and OsATG8f, OsATG8e was expressed in all tested tissues, but OsATG8f was only expressed in the leaf blades and the leaf sheaths at the booting stage. For the pair OsATG9a and OsATG9b, OsATG9a was alternatively spliced, but OsATG9b was not. For the pair OsATG13a and OsATG13b, OsATG13b was expressed more weakly than OsATG13a in the roots and culms. For the pair OsATG18b and OsATG18d, OsATG18b was expressed more strongly than OsATG18d. These data suggest that the duplicated OsATG homologues show differential expression patterns in normal nature fields (Fig. 3).For the tandem duplicated pair OsATG1a and OsATG1b, their different alternatively spliced mRNA forms showed different responses to various treatments (Figs 4–6). For the segmental-duplicated pair OsATG8b and OsATG8c, OsATG8b was down-regulated by drought, salt, ABA, and GA3 treatments, but the expression of OsATG8c was not obviously changed after any of the four treatments (Figs 4 and 5G). For the pair OsATG8e and OsATG8f, their responses were similar after nitrogen treatment (Fig. 6G). For the pair OsATG9a and OsATG9b, up-regulation of OsATG9a expression and down-regulation of OsATG9b expression were observed after salt treatment (Fig. 5H). For the pair OsATG13a and OsATG13b, OsATG13b was substantially down-regulated after various stress treatments, but OsATG13a was slightly up-expressed by abiotic stresses (Fig. 5K). The pair OsATG18b and OsATG18d showed similar responses to the different treatments. Comparison of the expression profiles of the OsATG homologues in the segmentally duplicated regions and in the tandemly duplicated regions showed either similar or differential expression in the case of one of the partners, reflecting conservation, neofunctionalization, or pseudogenization after the duplication event.423.9. ConclusionIn this study, we identified 33 OsATG homologues in rice, which formed 13 ATG subfamilies and may be involved in all steps of the autophagy process, as supported by phylogeny and motif organization. Gene duplication analysis revealed that expansion of some OsATG homologues has occurred via segmental duplication events, and all of these duplication events might occur after the origin of the grasses. The expression analysis revealed differential temporal and spatial expression patterns of OsATG homologues, which suggest their roles in regulating plant growth and development throughout the life cycle of rice. Further, we found that the expression of OsATG homologues was influenced by several environmental stimuli, including hormones, abiotic stresses, and biotic stresses, indicating their role in hormonal and stress responses. However, only the functional validation and biochemical characterization of various members will provide definitive clues about the specific roles of different classes of ATG proteins. These data provided in this study will be valuable for further in-depth functional analysis of ATGs in rice.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis research was supported by grants CNSF31071841/30900116 from the Chinese Natural Science Foundation (CNSF), grant KSCX3-EW-N-07 from the Chinese Academy of Science, and grant (8251065005000005) from the Guangdong Natural Science Foundation.Supplementary data"

IntroductionThe signal transduction pathway initiated by IL-4 stimulation is involved in various biological phenomena, such as Th2 cell differentiation, immunoglobulin class switching in B cells and inflammatory responses in epithelial cells.1–3 Malfunctions of the IL-4 signalling pathway cause improper responses in these cell types that subsequently result in chronic allergic diseases such as asthma and atopic disorders.4,5 For example, in asthma, IL-4 is excessively produced by Th2 cells and induces differentiation and class switching of allergen-specific B cells towards IgE production.6,7 At the same time, IL-4 also initiates response cascades in various cell types, such as eosinophils, basophils, mast cells and epithelial cells.8 In particular, CCL11 (eotaxin-1) synthesis is enhanced in epithelial cells,9,10 and mucus-producing goblet cells become hyperactive and differentiate.11 Reflecting the pivotal roles of the IL-4 pathway in allergic responses, knockout mice deficient in signalling molecules, such as the IL-4 receptor and STAT6, show symptoms that resemble those of allergic disorders.12–14In various cell types, the transcription factor (TF) STAT6 is a common downstream effector of the IL-4 signalling pathway. When bound by IL-4, IL-4 receptor a is phosphorylated by JAK kinases and recruits STAT6. The JAK kinases phosphorylate STAT6, induce its dimerization and facilitate its translocation to nucleus, where it acts as a transcriptional activator.15 Several dozen STAT6 target genes have been identified, such as IL-4,16 RETNLB,17 SOCS1,18,19 CD23A20 and CCL11. It has also been shown that the target sites of STAT6 have a consensus sequence: TTCNNNNGAA. However, a comprehensive view of the target genes of STAT6 remains elusive. In particular, previous studies mainly searched for STAT6 target genes in T cells21,22; target genes in other cell types (such as B cells or epithelial cells) have not been fully characterized.Recently developed massively parallel sequencing technologies coupled with chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP Seq) have enabled comprehensive analyses of binding sites for TFs.23,24 Recent papers have reported the comprehensive identification of STAT6 target genes in Th2 cells in both mice and humans.22 ChIP Seq analysis has also been used to comprehensively assess chromatin status by monitoring changes in histone modification patterns.25–27 Indeed, for many genes in various cell types, epigenetic changes have been shown to play important roles in transcriptional regulation in response to cellular environmental changes. Moreover, we also developed a method to enable large-scale analysis of transcriptional start sites (which we termed TSS Seq) by combining our full-length cDNA technology (oligo-capping) with massively parallel sequencing.28,29 In this method, a sequence adaptor necessary for the sequencing reaction is introduced into the mRNA as a cap-replacing oligo so that the region immediately downstream of the TSS can be sequenced (TSS tag).30 We demonstrated that the position of a TSS and its transcriptional level can be analysed at the same time by digital counting of the TSS tags. Integrative analysis of epigenomic and transcriptomic data collectively revealed that the human gene transcriptome and its regulation are truly dynamic and depend on the cell type. Every cell seems to have a unique chromatin status, harbouring its own set of active promoters, and a large amount of transcription occurs even from intergenic regions.31,32 These results again suggest that it is essential to identify and characterize STAT6 target genes and their regulation in a wider variety of cell types to obtain a more complete view of the biological relevance of the IL-4 signalling pathway.In this paper, we characterized STAT6 target genes and the chromatin status of the target sites by using ChIP Seq to evaluate STAT6, RNA polymerase II (pol II) and histone modifications. We further combined the ChIP Seq data with TSS Seq data to monitor the transcriptional consequences of STAT6 binding. We identified and characterized 44 putative STAT6 target genes in the Ramos cell line, which is a Burkitt's lymphoma cell line, and 132 in the BEAS2B cell line, which is a normal lung epithelial cell line. We also compared the STAT6 target genes identified in these cell types with recently reported STAT6 target genes in human Th2 cells. These results collectively illustrate that different cell types have their own mode of STAT6-mediated transcriptional regulation. Here, we report that STAT6 has diverse target gene repertoires depending on cell type.2. Materials and methods2.1. Sequence dataThe short-read sequence archive data appearing in this paper are registered in GenBank/DDBJ under the following accession numbers: SRA008161, SRA008162, SRA008163, SRA008164, DRA000017, DRA000018, DRA000019, DRA000020, DRA000021, DRA000022, DRA000046, DRA000047, DRA000048, DRA000049, DRA000050, DRA000051, DRA000052, DRA000053, DRA000054, DRA000055, DRA000056, DRA000057, DRA000058, DRA000059, DRA000326, DRA000327, DRA000328, DRA000329, DRA000330, DRA000331, DRA000332, DRA000333, DRA000334, DRA000335, DRA000336, DRA000337, DRA000338, DRA000339, DRA000340 and DRA000341.2.2. Cell cultureCells of the human B lymphoma line Ramos were cultured in RPMI1640 medium (Nissui) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.3 g/l l-glutamine (GIBCO), 0.36% bicarbonate and 60 mg/l kanamycin (GIBCO). Human lung epithelial BEAS2B cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium: Nutrient Mixture F-12 (GIBCO) with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin–100 µg/ml streptomycin (GIBCO) and 1 µg/ml puromycin (BD Biosciences). These cells were cultured at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Ramos and BEAS2B cells were stimulated by 50 ng/ml recombinant rhIL-4 (BD Biosciences). Ramos cells were stimulated 10 µg/ml human Anti-IgM (BETHYL). RNA interference was accomplished by transfecting cells with siGENOME SMARTpool STAT6 siRNA and siGENOME Non-Targeting siRNA #1 (Dharmacon). Short oligo-RNAs (50 nM) were transfected using 2 µl/ml Dharmafect 1 transfection reagent (Dharmacon) as recommended by the manufacturer.2.3. Construction of the ChIP Seq libraryFor each IP, 5 × 107 cells were stimulated with rhIL-4 at 37°C for 30 min. Cells were fixed with a 0.5% formaldehyde solution (50 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES)-KOH, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM ethylendiaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 0.5 mM ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA) and 5.5% formaldehyde) at room temperature for 10 min. Glycine (150 mM) was added to quench the cross-linking. Cells were rinsed twice with cold-Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) and harvested. Each cell pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of Lysis Buffer 1 (50 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% NP-40 and 0.25% Triton X-100). The cell lysate was rocked at 4°C for 10 min and spun at 1500 rpm for 5 min at 4°C. The supernatant was discarded. Each cell pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of Lysis Buffer 2 (10 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA and 0.5 mM EGTA). The cell lysate was rocked at room temperature for 10 min and spun at 1500 rpm for 5 min at 4°C. The supernatant was discarded. Each cell pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of Lysis Buffer 3 (10 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 0.1% Na-deoxycholate and 0.5% N-lauroylsarcosine). The cell lysate was sonicated with 10 cycles of 30 s in ice water with a sonicator (TOMY SEIKO). Triton X-100 (100 µl of a 10% solution) was added to the sonicated cell lysate. The cell lysate was spun at 14 000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube, and 50 µl of the supernatant was saved as whole cell extract (WCE)-DNA. The WCE-DNA was stored at -20°C. The supernatant was transferred to 100 µl of magnetic beads (Dynal) that were bound to 10 µg of antibody. The samples were rotated at 4°C overnight and washed eight times with 1 ml of Wash Buffer and once with TE buffer containing 50 mM NaCl. Elution Buffer (200 µl) was added and eluted at 65°C for 15 min. The samples were spun down, and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube. The samples were incubated at 65°C overnight. WCE-DNA (50 µl) was thawed, and 150 µl of Elution Buffer was added to it. The samples were incubated at 65°C overnight. TE (200 µl) was added to the IP and WCE-DNA samples. RNase (8 µl of 10 mg/ml; Funakosi) was added. The samples were incubated at 37°C for 2 h, and 4 µl of 20 mg/ml proteinase K (Takara) was added. The samples were incubated at 55°C for 2 h. Phenol chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation were performed. Samples destined for ChIP Seq by Illumina GAIIx were prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions. Anti-STAT-6 antibody (Santa Cruz, M-20), anti-RNA pol II antibody (Abcam, ab817), anti-H3K4me3 antibody (ab1012) and anti-H3Ac antibody (Millipore, 06–599) were used for the indicated experiments.2.4. Construction of the TSS Seq libraryCells were seeded 48 h before stimulation. At 24 h after seeding, the cells were transfected with STAT6 targeting and control siRNA and cultured for 24 h for the indicated experiments. At 24 h after transfection, the transfected cells were stimulated with IL-4 and control 0.1% Bovine serum albumin (BSA) PBS solution. At 24 h after stimulation, the cells were harvested, and RNA was extracted using an RNeasy Kit (Qiagen). Fifty micrograms of the obtained total RNA was subjected to oligo-capping with some modifications of the original protocol; BAP-TAP-treated total RNAs were ligated with 1.2 µg of RNA oligo (5'- AAUGAUACGGCGACCACCGAGAUCUACACUCUUUCCCUACACGACGCUCUUCCGAUCUGG-3'). After the DNase I treatment (TaKaRa), polyA + RNA was selected using oligo-dT powder (Collaborative). First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 10 pmol of random hexamer primer (5'-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGANNNNNNC-3') using Super Script II (Invitrogen) at 12°C for 1 h and 42°C overnight. Template RNA was degraded by alkaline treatment. One-fifth of the first-strand cDNA was used as the PCR template. For the PCR, a Gene Amp PCR kit (PerkinElmer) was used with the PCR primers 5'-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAG-3' and 5'-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACG-3' under the following reaction conditions: 15 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 56°C for 1 min and 72°C for 2 min. The PCR fragments were size-fractionated by 12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the fraction at 150–250 bp was recovered. The quality and the quantity of the obtained single-stranded first-strand cDNA were assessed using a BioAnalyzer (Agilent).2.5. Deep sequencing and data processing of the ChIP Seq and TSS Seq librariesApproximately 1 ng of the size-fractionated cDNA was used for sequencing using an Illumina GAIIx. Statistics of the tags generated for each experiment are summarized in Tables 1–3 and Supplementary Fig. S1. The generated sequence tags were mapped onto the human genomic sequence (hg18 as of UCSC Genome Browser) using the sequence alignment Programme Eland (Illumina). Unmapped or redundantly mapped sequences were removed from the data set, and only uniquely mapped sequences without any mismatches were used for further analyses. Positions relative to RefSeq genes were calculated based on the respective genomic coordinates. Genomic coordinates of exons and the protein-coding regions of the RefSeq transcripts are as described in hg18.

The numbers of peaks detected using different parameters are shown in Supplementary Fig. S1.Identification of STAT6 targets: summary of the ChIP Seq analyses of STAT6 and pol IIThe numbers of peaks detected using the described parameters are shown.

For each genomic position, the number of overlapping extended tags was counted. Based on the calculated tag information, the sum of the included tags was evaluated to determine whether more than a 10-fold difference between the IP and the WCE was present. Genomic regions in which positive enrichment of the tags continued for more than 121 bp were then selected. The statistical significance for this selection procedure compared with the background rate was evaluated using the Poisson probabilities as previously described in the reference.24For the TSS Seq analysis, the TSS tags were clustered into 500-bp bins. Representative TSSs were selected as the position from which the largest number of TSS tags was mapped. The selected representative TSSs were used for further analyses. When the genomic coordinates of a representative TSS was located within -10 to +1 kb of the 5'-end of a RefSeq transcript model, it was associated with the RefSeq gene as the TSS of its authentic promoter. For digital TSS-tag count analysis, TSS-tag counts were normalized as parts per million tags and used for further comparisons.2.6. Other computational proceduresFor Gene Ontology (GO) term analysis, GO terms were associated with the identified STAT6 target genes using loc2go at NCBI. GO term enrichment was evaluated by calculating hypergeometric distributions. The statistical significance between the expression levels and their fold inductions in Ramos and BEAS2B cells was evaluated by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. To analyse the gene expression changes of the TFs in Ramos and BEAS2B cells, 140 TFs were selected in TRANSFAC (Rel. 2010.1). Fold changes of the expression levels in response to IL-4 stimulation were evaluated by digital TSS-tag counts. The consensus sequences of the TFs were evaluated using MATCH33 with cut-off values determined using minFP, which minimizes false-positive results. The enrichment of the detected putative binding sites in the active target and silent targets in Ramos and BEAS2B cells was evaluated by calculating hypergeometric distributions. Putative TF binding sites that were significantly enriched (P < 0.05) in the respective groups were selected.2.7. Gene-specific PCRFor real-time PCR analysis of independent genes, template DNA was prepared using essentially the same protocol used for the short-read tag library construction. PCR primers were designed using Primer3 (http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/primer3/). The PCR primers used in this study are shown in Supplementary Table S1. Semi-quantitative Reverse Transcription (RT)–PCR was performed using an ABI 7900HT (ABI).2.8. Electrophoresis Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)BEAS2B cells were stimulated with rhIL-4 at 37°C for 30 min. Cells were suspended in 400 µl of Buffer A (10 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.8, 10 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1% NP-40). Cells were spun at 5000 rpm for 1 min at 4°C. The supernatant was discarded. Cell pellet was resuspended in 100 µl of Buffer C (50 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.8, 420 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl2, 20% Glycerol and 1 mM sodium orthovanadate). The cell lysate was rotated at 4°C for 30 min and spun at 15000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C. The supernatant was used as nuclear extract. Remaining procedures were performed using the LightShift Chemiluminescent EMSA kit (Thermo SCIENTIFIC). The DNA probe sequences used in this study are shown in Supplementary Table S1.3. Results and discussion3.1. Identification of putative STAT6 binding sites in Ramos and BEAS2B cellsTo identity STAT6 binding sites, we generated a total of 19 099 520 and 18 981 052 36-bp sequence ChIP Seq tags in Ramos and BEAS2B cells, respectively (Tables 1–3). We selected genomic regions at which ChIP Seq tags were enriched at the estimated false detection rate of P < 5e-6 (assuming a Poisson distribution of background tags). We further selected the sites at which no such enrichment was observed in the absence of IL-4. In total, we identified 556 and 467 STAT6 binding sites that were specifically detected in IL-4-stimulated Ramos and BEAS2B cells, respectively (Fig. 1A and B). The validation analysis using real-time RT–PCR for individual genes is presented in Supplementary Fig. S1A and B. Details of the experimental and computational procedures are also described in the ‘Material and methods’ and in the Supplementary figures. See Supplementary Fig. S1C and D for results using different parameters for the computational target identification procedure and for the GenBank accession numbers of the short-read tag data sets.

TSSs indicated by arrows showed reduced induction in knockdown cells.We analysed the genomic positions of the identified STAT6 binding sites (Fig. 1C and D). In BEAS2B cells, 358 (77%) sites were located within -10 to +1 kb of a RefSeq gene region (the 5'-end of the most upstream RefSeq transcript model was designated as zero). In contrast, in Ramos cells, 150 (27%) of the binding sites were located in these regions, whereas 37% were located in internal gene regions (Fig. 1C). MEME analysis34 of the binding sites in Ramos cells detected the consensus sequence TTCNNNNGAA, which matches previous studies.35,36 However, a different consensus sequence, TCTCGCG, was detected in BEAS2B cells (Fig. 1E). For the results of the validation analysis in the representative cases, see Supplementary Fig. S2. These results may indicate that STAT6 employs different modes of transcriptional activation in these cells.3.2. TSS Seq analysis and ChIP Seq analysis of RNA pol IITo directly analyse the transcriptional consequences of STAT6 binding, particularly in Ramos and BEAS2B cells, we constructed and analysed TSS Seq libraries using the same materials. We expected that TSS Seq analysis would allow us to associate the binding sites in intergenic regions and genic regions distant from the 5'-end of the authentic RefSeq transcript models with TSSs of previously uncharacterized transcripts. We generated a total of 31 027 908 and 26 447 563 36 bp single-end read TSS tags in Ramos and in BEAS2B cells, respectively. Of these, 22 227 238 (72%) and 20 964 221 (78%) of the tags mapped within the 5'-end exon of RefSeq genes and upstream proximal regions in Ramos and BEAS2B cells, respectively, indicating that the estimated accuracy of the TSS tags for determining TSS positions was ~86% (also see Supplementary Fig. S3C). The mapped tags were further clustered into bins of 500 to represent putative promoter groups (TSS clusters, TSCs). Consistent with our previous results,28 although the numbers of the TSCs were generally large, those having TSS tags of >1 ppm (corresponding to one copy per cell, assuming every cell has 1 million mRNA copies) represented a very minor population (Supplementary Fig. S3D for statistics). In total, there were 33 196 and 41 359 TSCs with expression levels of >1 ppm in IL-4-stimulated Ramos and BEAS2B cells, respectively. To further ensure the validity of the TSS Seq analysis, we also analysed pol II binding sites by ChIP Seq. We generated and analysed 21 903 762 and 21 709 675 36-bp single-end read tags and identified a total of 17 431 and 13 457 pol II binding sites with an estimated false detection rate of P < 0.001 (Tables 1–3) in Ramos and BEAS2B cells, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S1E–G). Of these, ~63, 20 and 17% overlapped TSC regions located in the 5'-ends, internal parts and intergenic regions, respectively, of the RefSeq genes.We associated the STAT6 ChIP Seq data with the TSS Seq data and the pol II ChIP Seq data. As summarized in Tables 4 and 5, in BEAS2B cells, among 358 putative STAT6 binding sites that were identified within RefSeq gene regions, 132 (37%) had TSCs that were induced by at least 2-fold by IL4 stimulation and pol II binding sites in their proximal region (-10 to 1 kb compared with the binding site). In nine cases, there were neither TSCs nor pol II binding signals in the surrounding regions, but we found them in other locations in the same RefSeq gene region. To determine whether these TSCs are associated with the STAT6 binding site, we conducted a TSS Seq analysis using 27 912 131 TSS tags in STAT6-knockdown BEAS2B cells (Table 2; also see Supplementary Fig. S3E–G). In 85% of the STAT6 target TSSs, the transcriptional induction indicated by digital TSS Seq-tag counts was repressed in STAT6 knockdown cells, indicating that the observed transcriptional induction at the associated TSCs was directly mediated by STAT6 (Fig. 1F). Altogether, we identified 44 and 132 STAT6 target TSCs located at the 5'-ends of RefSeq genes, 45 and 9 TSCs previously uncharacterized TSCs (putatively alternative promoters of the same gene) and 34 and 6 TSCs located in intergenic regions in Ramos and BEAS2B cells, respectively. Full lists of the identified STAT6 targets in the respective categories are shown in Supplementary Table S2. For the remainder of the 435 and 320 STAT6 binding sites, there was no induced TSC associated with the binding site (see the following sections for detailed characterization). For the results of the similar analyses using antigen-stimulated Ramos cells, see Supplementary Fig. S4A–E.

Characterization of STAT6 targetsWe identified STAT6 targets in multiple categories (see also Supplementary Fig. S5 for other examples).In Ramos and BEAS2B cells, 44 and 132 RefSeq genes were identified as STAT6 target genes, respectively, for which binding of STAT6 to the 5'-end region was observed together with the presence and induction of TSC and pol II binding (Fig. 1A). Previously reported target genes such as the SOCS1 in BEAS2B cells and low-affinity Fc receptor genes (CD23A) in Ramos cells are included, as are some uncharacterized genes. For example, the MS4A1 gene (NM_021950) was identified as a STAT6 target gene in Ramos cells. MS4A1 is a human B-lymphocyte surface molecule, and in vitro studies with an MS4A1 monoclonal antibody showed that this gene plays important roles in the regulation of B cell activation and proliferation.37,38 Moreover, this antibody is clinically used as an anti-rheumatic drug.39,40 Identification of a STAT6-mediated pathway of MS4A1 induction may present a target for the design of novel drugs. In general, GO term41 enrichment analysis showed that GO terms associated with protein secretion and trafficking molecules were enriched among the STAT6 targets in Ramos cells. However, in BEAS2B cells, GO terms associated with transcription and chromatin remodelling were enriched (Fig. 2A). STAT6 may have different repertoires of targets in Ramos and BEAS2B cells.

Statistical significance between the indicated populations is shown in the margin. STAT6 target genes in Ramos and BEAS2B cells.In 45 cases in Ramos cells and 9 cases in BEAS2B cells, STAT6 binding sites were found to be associated with previously uncharacterized putative alternative promoters of protein-coding genes (left panel; Fig. 1B). For example, a putative STAT6-responsive alternative promoter was identified in the second intron of the GAB1 gene (Supplementary Fig. S5). GAB1 is tyrosine-phosphorylated upon stimulation by various cytokines, growth factors and antigen receptors. Phosphorylated GAB1 interacts with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and the N-terminal PH domain of GAB1 binds to 3-phosphoinositide (PI3).42 Putative transcripts from the alternative promoter of GAB1 lack the PH domain, which may reduce PI3K lymphocyte activation via immunoreceptors and cytokine receptors by competing as a PI3 docking-deficient isoform.Among the STAT6 binding sites associated with intergenic TSCs, one TSC overlapped a previously identified putative ncRNA gene (‘NR’ gene) according to the UCSC Genome Browser. In one additional case, an intergenic TSC was associated with a fully sequenced full-length cDNA, suggesting that STAT6 intergenic targets are mostly uncharacterized transcripts.43–45 The right panel in Fig. 1B presents one such case. Although the molecular functions of these intergenic transcripts remain elusive, this is the first report to indicate the possibility that STAT6 also regulates the expression of so-called putative non-coding RNA transcripts.3.4. Diverse regulation of STAT6 targets in different cell typesWe compared the STAT6 target genes identified in Ramos cells with those in BEAS2B cells and found that they did not overlap at all (Fig. 2B). Also, as shown in Figs 1 and 2, STAT6 target genes showed distinct characteristics between Ramos and BEAS2B cells. Specifically, the target genes had different consensus binding sequences, different relative binding site positions compared with the RefSeq region and different associated GO terms. We also included in the comparison STAT6 target sites in human Th2 cells that were identified in a recent study.22 The reported consensus binding sequence of TTCNNNNGAA in Th2 cells was similar to the consensus sequence we identified in Ramos cells. However, the reported target genes in Th2 cells very rarely overlapped with those in Ramos or BEAS2B cells. In contrast, the expression and induction levels of the STAT6 target genes in Ramos and BEAS2B cells were nearly equivalent (Fig. 2C).Having observed that different cells have different repertoires of STAT6 targets even when they are similarly activated, we speculated that this differential regulation of STAT6 activation may be mediated by distinct chromatin structures in distinct cell types. We examined changes in histone modification patterns in response to IL-4 stimulation, namely trimethylation of lysine 4 (H3K4me3) and acetylation (H3Ac) of histone 3, using ChIP Seq analysis of a total of 496 279 125 36-bp single-end read tags (Table 4). These histone modifications are thought to be representative markers of active chromatin.46 As shown in Fig. 3A, we observed that H3K4me3 and H3Ac were similarly enriched around the TSSs of STAT6 target genes (STAT6-positive, pol II binding-positive and TSS induction-positive genes) both in Ramos and BEAS2B cells, suggesting that active transcription occurs at the identified target sites. Interestingly, in both cell types, active histone markers were already present around the target sites prior to IL-4 stimulation. It is possible that, upon IL-4 stimulation, STAT6 is recruited to the chromatin that is already programmed to be bound by STAT6 or other TFs (left panels; Fig. 3A and B; also see Fig. 4B for a schematic representation).

Interestingly, active histone markers were also observed in Ramos cells even though these regions were silent in this cell type; neither STAT6 binding nor the presence of TSS tags was observed (right panels; Fig. 3A). Pol II recruitment was even observed in these regions (right bottom panel; Fig. 3A). Although they are in a cellular context in which no transcriptional induction occurs, these sites seem to be resting in a prepared state until STAT6 is recruited.3.5. Distinct modes of STAT6-mediated transcriptional induction in different cell typesWe also noticed that numerous STAT6 binding sites in Ramos cells did not consequently induce transcription even though STAT6 binding was clearly detected by ChIP Seq and confirmed by real-time PCR (Tables 4 and 5; also see Supplementary Fig. S6 for examples). We found that a majority of these STAT6 binding sites also resided within H3K4me3- and H3Ac-positive regions and that pol II was frequently recruited. Thus, only the induction of the TSS was absent in these regions (Table 5). Similar observations were also made regarding putative alternative promoter binding sites of STAT6 and intergenic targets of STAT6. In these cases, some additional factors seemed to be missing, which hampered the full activation of transcription.In BEAS2B cells, we also found a number of STAT6 binding sites lacking transcriptional induction, which is similar to the case in Ramos cells (Table 5). However, in BEAS2B cells, active histone markers were found to be less prevalent around the silent target regions (STAT6 target sites in Ramos cells), and pol II was not bound in these regions (right panels; Fig. 3B). In the active target sites, active histone markers were already present prior to STAT6 binding, but pol II recruitment occurred only after IL-4 stimulation (left panels; Fig. 3B). Results of a similar analysis for Th2 target regions in Ramos and BEAS2B cells are shown in Supplementary Fig. S7. It is possible that STAT6-mediated transcriptional activation consists of multiple regulatory steps ranging from the formation of active chromatin to the recruitment of STAT6 and transcriptional activation, each of which requires different factors that may be cell-specific (Fig. 4B).3.6. Transcriptional regulation of Ramos and BEAS2B cellsTo search for factors missing in Ramos and BEAS2B cells that drive transcriptional activation in other cells, we analysed the transcriptional induction of genes encoding TFs in response to IL-4 stimulation by counting TSS tags. For this purpose, we selected 183 previously functionally characterized TF genes from TRANSFAC.47 As shown in Fig. 4A, ~45 (25%) of the TF genes were either up- or down-regulated in Ramos or BEAS2B cells. Although similar numbers of TF genes were up- or down-regulated, they rarely overlapped between cell types (P = 0.8). We further examined which particular TFs had consensus binding sites enriched in the population of STAT6 target genes, although they were diluted in the surrounding regions of the STAT6 binding sites at which no transcriptional induction occurred. In BEAS2B cells, we found that the predicted binding sites of FAC1, which catalyses nucleosome sliding as a component of the NURF complex,48,49 were enriched (P < 3e-5) in the former population. The expression of FAC1 was induced in response to IL-4 by 23-fold in BEAS2B cells, whereas it was repressed by 50-fold in Ramos cells. On the other hand, in Ramos cells, the predicted binding sites of CEBP-<U+03B3> were found to be enriched around the transcription-inducing STAT6 binding sites (P < 0.02), and transcription level of CEBP-<U+03B3> was induced 27-fold upon IL-4 stimulation. These TFs may be responsible for the cell-specific regulation of STAT6 target genes. A complete list of the identified TFs in the respective cell types and their statistical significance is shown in Supplementary Fig. S8. These TFs should be the first targets in any attempt to elucidate the TFs that cooperatively regulate the transcription of STAT6 targets in a cell-specific manner.3.7. ConclusionsIn this paper, we describe the characterization of STAT6 target genes in Ramos and BEAS2B cells using various types of massively parallel sequencing analyses. Among the 44 and 132 STAT6 target genes identified in these two respective cell types, several previously uncharacterized target genes were included (Supplementary Table S2). The target genes identified in this study reside in various functional categories in different cell types and expand the opportunities to treat IL-4-related allergic diseases by offering potential pharmacological targets.It should also be noted that putative alternative promoters were among the STAT6 targets identified in this study. Because the potential transcripts from these alternative promoters lack or have different N-terminal protein-coding regions in many cases (exemplified in Fig. 1B), they are likely to have diversified protein functions. Although elucidating the detailed biological roles of these targets will require further in-depth functional assays, it is likely that STAT6 also utilizes these previously poorly characterized transcripts in addition to canonical protein-coding transcripts for the fine tuning of target gene function. We also identified STAT6 target genes in intergenic regions of RefSeq transcripts that are likely to drive non-protein coding transcripts. Multi-layered regulation mediated by canonical promoters of protein-coding genes, alternative promoters and non-coding RNAs may further increase the complexity of the responses to STAT6-mediated IL-4 stimulation in various cell types, thereby collectively orchestrating immune responses in humans. One of the greatest advantages of integrating ChIP Seq data with TSS Seq data may be that previously uncharacterized molecules could be analysed in a uniform platform.We also found that different cell types have different repertoires of STAT6 targets. In Ramos cells, genes mainly involved in protein secretion and protein trafficking (such as MS4A1 and CCR650) were identified as STAT6 targets, suggesting that one of the main biological roles of STAT6 activation is to change patterns of secretory proteins and/or cell surface proteins during the maturation of B cells. On the other hand, in BEAS2B cells, genes involved in the alteration of transcriptional programs (such as PTRH251 and FUBP152) were found to be enriched. We further compared the newly identified STAT6 targets in Ramos and BEAS2B cells with recently identified STAT6 targets in Th2 cells. We found that neither overlapped regarding functional categories, suggesting that STAT6 targets bring distinct cellular consequences depending on cell types (Fig. 2).We attempted to identify how different STAT6 transcriptional activation programmes are realized in different cell types. We found that the chromatin status and pol II binding patterns were different between Ramos and BEAS2B cells (Fig. 3). In BEAS2B cells, the formation of active chromatin and recruitment of pol II were specific to active STAT6 target sites. Pol II recruitment occurred only upon IL-4 stimulation. In contrast, in Ramos cells, this event sometimes occurred even around silent STAT6 targets, which are active in different cell types but silent in this cell type. Different cell types seem to have different modes of STAT6-mediated target activation. We therefore searched for factors that may be necessary for full transcriptional activation of STAT6 targets in Ramos and BEAS2B cells. As putative cooperative factors for STAT6, we identified FAC1 (which is a component of the nucleosome sliding complex NURF) in BEAS2B cells and CEBP-<U+03B3> (which is a transcriptional activator53) in Ramos cells. The identification of different categories of TFs in different cell types may indicate that transcriptional induction mediated by STAT6 requires modification of the chromatin structure in BEAS2B cells, whereas the recruitment of synergetic TFs is more important in Ramos cells. Distinct cellular responses may be mediated by the intrinsic chromatin status and unique sets of TFs, and the factors that play the most important roles may be different depending on cell type.We also found that STAT6 binding did not always result in transcriptional activation. On the contrary, the targets that were transcriptionally activated upon STAT6 binding were relatively few in both Ramos and BEAS2B cells. This feature of STAT6 binding was also observed in Th2 cells by other groups.22 There seems to be complex regulation of transcriptional induction even after the formation of active chromatin and the recruitment of TFs. The advantage of using massively parallel sequencing as a common platform is that genome-wide data can be generated simultaneously for different steps of transcriptional activation, ranging from the binding of STAT6 and histone modification to pol II binding and transcriptional induction. It will be important to determine which regulatory step is the most important for each gene to fully understand STAT6-mediated transcriptional activation mechanisms. Further in-depth analyses of the identified target genes will also be necessary to understand the mechanisms whereby these factors in their respective cell types collectively induce necessary and/or harmful immune responses in healthy and diseased individuals. Biochemical and phenotypic analyses at the cellular and organismal levels are still beyond the reach of genome-wide approaches. However, the target gene catalogue identified and characterized in this study in different cell types should serve as a valuable resource.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by grants from the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) project of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan, the Japan Key Technology Center project of METI of Japan, and a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Priority Areas from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan.

PCC 6803 was determined by Kazusa DNA Research Institute in 1996 as the first genome of photosynthetic organism.1 After that, this strain has been serving as a standard of cyanobacteria in various areas of research, such as photosynthesis, stress response and metabolism.2 However, the sequenced strain (called Kazusa strain in the present study) is different from the stock in Pasteur Culture Collection (called PCC strain in the present study). In fact, the Kazusa strain is a derivative of a ‘glucose-tolerant’ strain, which was obtained by J.G.K. Williams in DuPont Institute.3 The published sequence of the Kasuza strain included some genes inactivated by a putative point mutation, a putative frame shift, or an Insertion Sequence (IS) insertion, such as a one in the pilC gene. The mutation within the coding sequence of the pilC gene was pointed out to be a possible reason for the non-motility of the Kazusa strain.4 A 154 bp deletion was also found in the GT strain with respect to the PCC strain.5 The location of some IS elements in the Kazusa strain is known to be different with respect to other GT and PCC strains.6 Even within the PCC strains, different strains having different light responses have been isolated.2 All these slightly different strains bear the common strain name PCC 6803, but we need to recognize differences in exact strains used in various studies. For this purpose, we will have to pinpoint the differences in genome sequences of various different strains.One of the authors (N.S.) constructed 40 site-directed mutants in a previous work on comparative genomics of plants and cyanobacteria7 using the laboratory stock of Synechocystis GT strain (called GT-S). We thought that this strain should be identical to the Kazusa strain, because it originated in the late 1980s from the strain owned by Dr T. Omata, which was also the source of the Kazusa strain. However, in view of the small but significant differences in genome sequence as reported earlier, it was important to establish the genetic background of our strain to assess correctly the phenotype of the above-mentioned mutants. Therefore, we attempted to analyse the genome sequence of the strain GT-S and to compare it with the reference sequence of the Kazusa strain. We found significant differences with respect to the database sequence, but we were finally convinced that the differences in the real sequences were minimal.2. Materials and methods2.1. Strain and genomesSynechocystis GT-S strain was originally a gift from Dr Tatsuo Omata (Nagoya University, but he was in Riken Institute then) in the late 1980s, and then maintained in Sato laboratory as frozen glycerol stocks. In the present study, we used the stock originally frozen in the early 1990s. The cells were grown in the BG-11 medium at 32°C with aeration as described before.8 The cells were harvested by centrifugation, and then washed twice with 4 M NaI to remove extracellular polysaccharide, and then, treated with lysozyme. DNA was released by treatment with proteinase K and sodium N-dodecanoylsarcosinate, extracted with phenol and chloroform and purified by CsCl ultracentrifugation.9 As a reference, we also used an aliquot of the DNA of the original Kazusa strain, which had been stored as a stock in Kazusa DNA Research Institute.2.2. Sequencing and data analysisGenomic DNA was sheared by ultrasonic treatment and sequenced by a genome sequencer FLX instrument (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol (this is usually referred to as ‘454 sequencing’). To find its genomic origin, namely, main genome or plasmids, each read was analysed by BLASTN10 software version 2.2.18 using the sequences of the four plasmids as well as the main genome as targets (the accession numbers are given in Supplementary Table S5). The options were: -FF -e 0.0001 -v 2 -b 2 -m 8 -C F (no filtering, cut-off E-value = 0.0001, output and list sequences = 2, table-formatted output, no compositional adjustments). In the table-formatted output, only the first line corresponding to the highest identity was selected for each read, which was assigned to the genome shown therein. The authentic reads assigned for genomic DNA obtained in this way were mapped onto the reference sequence of the Kazusa strain (GenBank and RefSeq accession numbers: BA000022 and NC_000911 for the main genome) by the inGAP software version 2.3.1.11 Unfortunately, the details of internal algorithm of the software are not clear, and there is no option related to the detection of SNPs. Therefore, all putative SNPs detected by default settings were analysed. Plasmids were also analysed by using respectively assigned reads. A list of putative SNPs was obtained as an output. Homology of affected open reading frames (ORFs) with orthologues in other cyanobacteria was analysed by the cluster data of CyanoClust database12 prepared by the Gclust software.13 Processing of DNA and protein sequences was performed with the SISEQ software version 1.59.14 Sequence alignments were constructed with the Clustal X software version 2.0.9.15 Genomic sequence was manipulated by the Artemis software version 13.0.162.3. Sequence confirmationFor each putative SNP, a genomic region of 200–300 bp was amplified (see Supplementary Table S1 for primer sequences). For each putative IS element, a genomic region of ~300 or 1500 bp was amplified (see Supplementary Table S2 for primer sequences). The amplification of a long DNA was to overcome repeated sequences. DNA templates of both GT-S and Kazusa strains were used. The products were sequenced by conventional Sanger sequencing, using the sequencing services of MACROGEN Japan Corp. (Tokyo, Japan) or FASMAC Co. Ltd. (Atsugi, Japan).3. Results3.1. Identification of SNPsWe obtained 197 912 reads having an average length of 399.3 bases for the GT-S strain by 454 sequencing. Without the preliminary classification of reads, 68 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were obtained for the main genome, but many of them were not correct, because of the presence of highly homologous genes in plasmids. Then the reads were allocated to the main genome and the four plasmids by homology analysis as described in Section 2.2. The 173 217 reads that were classified as reads for the main genome were mapped to the reference sequence NC_000911. Using the default settings of inGAP software (see Supplementary data for the list of options), the entire genome was covered by at least one read, except four small regions (Supplementary Table S3). The analysis of such gap regions was performed separately, as described below. As a result, 31 putative SNPs were detected by the inGAP analysis. All of them were selected as highly probable SNPs for experimental validation.Each of the putative SNPs was checked by PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing of both strands. Twenty-two SNPs (Table 1) were finally identified as the differences of the sequence of the GT-S strain with respect to the database sequence NC_000911 (identical to BA000022 with respect to the DNA sequence). To verify that these represent real differences of the two strains, we analysed, by Sanger sequencing, the DNA of the Kazusa strain, which had been stored in small aliquots. Surprisingly, all the putative SNP sites were found identical in the Kazusa strain and the GT-S strain except No. 8 (Table 1). The SNP No. 8 is the mutation within the pilC gene, which had been reported earlier.4 The two putative SNPs in the psbA3 coding region were identical to the corresponding sites of the psbA2 gene. Since the correct psbA3 sequence had been published before the genome sequence,17 these putative SNPs are probably sequencing artefacts in NC_000911. A putative SNP site in the psaA gene also matches the previously published sequence.18 In other cases, we have no clear explanation, and might be sequencing errors and/or mutations in cosmid clones used in the original sequencing.

Insertion site numbers represent the last position of insertion site + 0.5. N/A indicates that the amino acid change is not applicable because SNP site is not in an ORF.Unfortunately, the mapping of reads on to the reference genome was not perfect using the obtained reads. In 14 short regions, no reads or at most two reads were mapped (Supplementary Tables S3 and S4). These regions were amplified by PCR for both GT-S and Kazusa strains (results not shown). Conventional sequencing of the PCR products confirmed that there is no sequence difference in 11 of these regions with respect to the database sequence. The remaining three regions having two reads were close to one another and located within a 3 kb region. Clean PCR amplification of this 3 kb region was not successful because of repeated sequences. However, the presence of two reads led us to tentatively conclude that there is no sequence difference in these regions.3.2. Analysis of plasmidsPlasmids were also analysed by inGAP mapping. There were no putative SNPs in pSYSM and pSYSG (Supplementary Table S5). In pSYSA, four sites were reported as putative SNPs, but all of them represent sites having only two reads and one of the reads matched database sequence. Therefore, these were not considered as SNPs in pSYSA. In pSYSX, four sites within or near ssr6089 gene were detected as putative SNPs. Analysis using the CyanoClust database indicated that this plasmid contains 30 kb homologous regions, ssr6002–slr6038 and ssr6062–slr6094. The ssr6089 gene has a nearly identical homologue ssr6030. However, the sequence corresponding to the four putative SNPs were identical in the two genes in the database sequence NC_005232. Therefore, the SNP calling was not due to mixing of reads for homologous genes. The SNPs could possibly represent mutations in the strain GT-S, but final validation is hampered by high similarity of the long homologous regions.3.3. Alteration of ORFs due to frame shiftThere are five cases in which a single gene is split into a pair of genes as a result of frame shift. Figure 1A shows the site of putative SNP 12, namely the sll0762–sll0763 region. There is an extraneous C in the database sequence, and accordingly, the removal of this C results in fusion of the two ORFs. This new ORF encoding a hypothetical protein has well-conserved orthologues in other cyanobacteria (Anabaena, Cyanothece, Arthrospira etc.) as shown by the alignment of the cluster 2611 of the CyanoClust (Fig. 1B).

Arrowhead indicates the nucleotide variations detected as putative SNP site.To correct the database sequence to obtain the GT-S genome sequence, we should combine (i) slr0162 (gspF) and slr0163 (pilC), (ii) slr0364 and slr0366, (iii) sll0762 and sll0763 (this is described above), (iv) sll0751 (ycf22) and sll0752, and (v) ssl0787 and ssl0788 (Supplementary Figs S1 and S2). In addition, the extended C-terminus of Sll0422 protein should be removed after correction for the nucleotide change (Supplementary Fig. S1). All these changes except (i) also apply to the real sequence of Kazusa strain.3.4. Large indelsWe also checked large indels (insertion/deletions). The exact sites of insertion of various IS elements have already been analysed.6 Among them, ISY203b insertion between slr1862 and slr1863 and ISY203g insertion between sll1473 and sll1475 were found in the Kazusa strain but not in the GT-S strain. ISY203e insertion between ssl2982 and slr1636 was detected in both Kazusa and GT-S strains (Table 2) but not in another GT strain in Ikeuchi laboratory. It has also been known that a 154 bp element upstream of the slr2031 gene is deleted in the GT strains.5 This deletion was shared by all GT strains analysed in the present study. List of ISY203s detected in GT strainsList of ISY203s detected in GT strains3.5. Finally validated differences of the two strainsAll previous description was based on the comparison using the database sequence as the sole reference. Given that there are a number of changes that have to be made for the database sequence, we summarize our results as the differences between the real sequences of GT-S and GT-Kazusa. The two sequences are essentially identical except a single frame-shift mutation in the pilC gene and two more insertions of ISY203 in GT-Kazusa with respect to GT-S.4. DiscussionThe present study revealed that a significant number of differences are present in the database sequence and the genome sequences of laboratory strains of the same ‘species’ Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. The detailed analysis using the genomic DNA of both Kazusa and GT-S strains indicated that the detected 21 putative SNPs were, in fact, differences in the database sequence, but not real differences in the two genomes. The final balance sheet indicates that we found a single nucleotide change and two IS insertions between the Kazusa strain and the GT-S strain. The time of separation of the two strains may be estimated as the mid-1980s according to the opinions of concerned people, which are now quite obscure. The time interval until the DNA isolation for sequencing may be roughly estimated as about 10 years for the Kazusa strain. The GT-S strain was stocked in the early 1990s, and re-plated in 2010 for the present analysis. The effective time interval from the separation of the two sub-strains was also about 10 years. The results suggest that nucleotide change (mutation) could be kept to a minimum (only one, in this case) if due attention is paid for maintenance of strains, but IS mobilization may be more frequent (two events). The rapid mobilization of IS could be limited to the particular element ISY203, but we do not know the actual trigger of activation of this IS element. We, therefore, should be careful about IS activation in the maintenance of laboratory stocks. We will need a convenient way of detecting a mobilized ISY203 to be sure about our research using the GT strain.The nucleotide changes as a result of re-sequencing caused significant effects on gene annotation. As mentioned, five genes had been thought split into two by a single nucleotide difference before this analysis. The length of another gene was also changed. The IS element inserted in the sll1474 (ccaS) gene is known to inactivate it.6 Altogether, the nucleotide changes (whether sequencing errors or real mutations) have an important impact on molecular biological researches using cyanobacteria or other bacteria. A single run of new generation sequencing with some additional PCR experiments can establish identity of the organism that is being used in the laboratory. This will become a standard of molecular genetics in microbiology.The genomic database is very important in not only experimental studies but also computational analysis. The use of correct sequence is a prerequisite for detailed comparative genomics research. The 21 sites per 3.6 Mb genome are significantly large number for present-day level of genome analysis. The correction of the standard sequence will be especially useful in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, which is a standard cyanobacterial strain in various areas of research such as photosynthesis and stress response among others. We hope our data deposited as a new separate entry will be useful for all those who are using this cyanobacterium in various researches.5.

IntroductionAngiosperms evolved from a common ancestral genome that underwent duplications, rearrangements, and mutations in succeeding generations. Phylogenetic relatedness of different species correlates with a degree of synteny between their genomes.1,2 Comparative genomics contributes greatly to understanding the basic processes of genome evolution from or to related organisms within a phylogenetic framework3–5 and applying model species genome information to the study of related organisms.6,7 Comparative mapping studies in the grass family (Poaceae) have pioneered the field of plant comparative genomics.3,8 The collinear genomic regions between domesticated cereals and forage crops have been detected by such studies, which have opened the way to efficient map-based cloning and enabled inference of the basic organization of the ancestral grass genome.The dicot family Brassicaceae consists of 338 genera with ca. 3700 species in 25 tribes,9 and their chromosome number varies greatly from n = 4 to 128.10 Comparative genomics in Brassicaceae has largely focused on direct comparisons between the model species Arabidopsis thaliana and the species of interest, especially, the agronomically important Brassica crops. Comparative linkage mapping among three diploid Brassica species, i.e. Brassica nigra, Brassica oleracea, and Brassica rapa,6 and that between A. thaliana and three Brassica species11 have suggested that genomes of the diploid Brassica species are composed of a triplicated and rearranged ancestral genome. Additional evidence for the genome triplication in Brassica has been shown by nucleotide sequencing12,13 and cytogenetic methods.14,15 However, some genomic regions are present in less or more than three copies in Brassica genomes.7,16 Furthermore, ~30–40% of genes in the syntenic regions of A. thaliana have been lost in their counterparts of the Brassica genomes,13,16 and genomic rearrangements and gene duplications have occurred in A. thaliana after the divergence of Brassica and Arabidopsis,17,18 making the comparative maps between A. thaliana and Brassica species complicated.7,11,19A Brassicaceae ancestral karyotype (n = 8) has been previously deduced from comparative genetic maps of two n = 8 species in the tribe Camelineae, i.e. Capsella rubella and Arabidopsis lyrata, with A. thaliana.5,20–22Arabidopsis thaliana and its closely related species with six or seven chromosome pairs have been suggested to be derived from the ancestral karyotype through a similar mechanism of chromosome reduction.23 Based on a set of 21 conserved genomic regions within the Arabidopsis genome identified in Brassica napus by Parkin et al.,19 Schranz et al.5 have proposed a set of 24 genomic blocks within the Brassicaceae ancestral karyotype. These 24 genomic blocks represent the conserved segments among the Brassicaceae ancestral karyotype, Arabidopsis, and Brassica. Using these genomic blocks, the homoeologous relationship and evolution of the A, B, and C Brassica genomes have been studied,24 and a conserved chromosome (AK1) of the Brassicaceae ancestral karyotype has been revealed in Sinapis alba.25More recently, Mandáková and Lysak4 have proposed a Proto-Calepineae karyotype (n = 7), which has been suggested to be descended from the Brassicaceae ancestral karyotype and to be the karyotype of the common progenitor of the tribes Calepineae, Conringieae, and Noccaeeae, and the Brassicaceae lineage II, including the tribes Brassiceae, Isatideae, Sisymbrieae, and Eutremeae. Two to three copies of genomic blocks associated closely in the Proto-Calepineae karyotype have also been found in the Brassica genome,5,19 suggesting that the Proto-Calepineae karyotype has undergone the whole-genome triplication in the clade leading to the tribe Brassiceae. However, the genomic evolutionary process from the primary paleo-hexaploid ancestor to the present Brassiceae species is not clear. Reconstruction of karyotypes of different species using the common genomic blocks of the Brassicaceae ancestral karyotype is expected to solve this problem.Radish (Raphanus sativus L., 2n = 2x = 18) belonging to the tribe Brassiceae and closely related to B. rapa is an important commercial crop that is grown and consumed all over the world, especially in eastern Asia. Raphanus sativus has great variations in the root shape from round and thick with a diameter of more than 30 cm to thin and long with a length of more than 2 m. The thick roots are commonly harvested as vegetables, while there are some cultivars used as leafy vegetables, silique vegetables, or oil crops. As a genetic map with DNA markers can be utilized in applied genetics and breeding, several genetic linkage maps have been constructed in R. sativus26–29 based on Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP), Random Amplified Polymorphism (RAPD), and Simple Sequence Repeats (SSR) markers, and quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for shape and colour of roots, club-root resistance, and cyst nematode resistance have been detected.27,29,30 However, since the AFLP and RAPD markers are anonymous and SSR markers are usually located in non-coding sequences, the comparative genomics of R. sativus with other species has not been performed, and utilization of the genome information of Arabidopsis and B. rapa in the study of R. sativus is limited.Recently, abundant information on expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences of radish has been published on the radish sequence database (Radish DB; http://radish.plantbiology.msu.edu). As single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most abundant type of DNA polymorphism in genomes, in order to construct a linkage map of R. sativus, we explored these EST sequences to design primer pairs for specific amplification of genes, and identified SNPs for production of EST-based SNP markers by determining nucleotide sequences of two lines used for production of an F2 population. Genotyping of EST-based SNP markers of F2 plants was performed using dot-blot-SNP analysis combining multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR)31 and mixed probe hybridization,32 and a high-density linkage map was constructed to reveal synteny with the genome of A. thaliana. Furthermore, the genome structure of R. sativus was reconstructed using the 24 genomic blocks of the Brassicaceae ancestral karyotype and was compared with those of other Brassiceae species.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materialsTwo radish lines self-pollinated for three generations from ‘Sayatori 26704’ (National Institute of Vegetable and Tea Science, Japan) and ‘Aokubi S-h’ (Takii Seed Co., Japan), respectively, were used. ‘Sayatori 26704’ (hereafter ‘Sayatori’) is a seedpod vegetable with a very thin and small root like a rat tail cultivated in South Asia. ‘Aokubi S-h’ (hereafter ‘Aokubi’) is a Japanese radish with a long and thick root. F1 hybrids were produced by crossing ‘Aokubi’ with ‘Sayatori’, and F2 seeds were obtained by selfing with bud pollination of a single F1 hybrid plant.2.2. Analysis of DNA polymorphism between ‘Aokubi’ and ‘Sayatori’Genomic DNAs of the ‘Aokubi’ and ‘Sayatori’ inbred lines were extracted from leaves by the CTAB method.33 For designing primer pairs, ~9000 unigenes were selected from the RS2 library of the Radish Database (http://radish.plantbiology.msu.edu). The exon/intron junction and the UTR region of the unigenes were predicted by the MAEZATO system, which aligns a target EST sequence with a possible homologous Arabidopsis cDNA.34 Forward primers were designed within an exon region and reverse primers were designed within a region containing a predicted 3'-UTR using Primer3 plus (http://www.bioinformatics.nl/cgi-bin/primer3plus/primer3plus.cgi). As flowering time is important for the production of vegetables in R. sativus, the coding sequence of an FLC1 homologue in B. rapa35 was also used for designing primers. PCR was conducted with these primer pairs using genomic DNA of the ‘Aokubi’ and ‘Sayatori’ inbred lines as templates. A 20 µl reaction mixture contained 20 ng of plant genomic DNA, 10 pmol of each primer, 1× ExTaq buffer, 2 nmol of each dNTP, and 0.5 U of Taq DNA polymerase (ExTaq, Takara Biomedicals, Japan). The thermal cycling condition was 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 58°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 2 min. A 4 µl PCR product was electrophoresed on 1.2% agarose gel, and a single fragment amplified by PCR was sequenced by the Sanger method.36 The sequences were aligned using SEQUENCHER version 4.7 (Gene Codes Corporation, MI, USA) to identify SNPs. Sequences having SNPs between ‘Aokubi’ and ‘Sayatori’ were used for designing bridge probes37 for dot-blot-SNP analysis.2.3. Dot-blot-SNP analysisGenomic DNAs from 189 plants of the F2 population were prepared using the modified CTAB method.38 In order to achieve cost-effective and high-efficiency SNP genotyping, a dot-blot-SNP method combining multiplex PCR31 and a mixed probe37 was developed and named multiplex PCR–mixed probe (MPMP) dot-blot analysis. First, 36 primer pairs of SNP markers were grouped into six by MultiPLX 2.031 and were assigned to six lines in a table. Secondly, hybridization conditions of probes of the markers were predicted as described by Shiokai et al.32 using the DINAMelt web server (http://mfold.rna.albany.edu/?q=DINAMelt/Hybrid2),39 and the probes having similar hybridization conditions in different primer groups were placed into the same column to design an MPMP table (an example being shown in Supplementary Table S1). Multiplex PCR was conducted in a 10 µl reaction mixture containing 4 ng plant genomic DNA, 10 pmol of each primer mixed as designed in the MPMP table, 1× KAPATaq EXtra buffer (without Mg2+), 1.75 mM MgCl2, 0.3 mM of each dNTP, and 0.25 U of DNA polymerase (KAPATaq Extra, KAPABIOSYSTEMS, Boston, MA, USA). Thermal cycling conditions were as follows: 1 min denaturation at 94°C, 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 56°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 1 min, and a final extension at 72°C for 2 min. Amplified DNA was denatured in a solution of 0.4 N NaOH and 10 mM EDTA, and dot-blotted onto a nylon membrane (Nytran, Pall, NY, USA) using Multi-pin Blotter (Atto, Tokyo, Japan). Probes in the same columns of the MPMP table were mixed and hybridized together with digoxigenin-labelled probes having sequences complementary to the bridge probe.37 Allele-specific signals were detected according to Shiokai et al.37 This MPMP dot-blot analysis using 36 EST-SNP markers was compared with dot-blot-SNP analysis using a single EST-SNP marker.2.4. Linkage analysisLinkage analysis was carried out using the JoinMap 4.0 software (Kyazma B.V., Wageningen, The Netherlands).40 The SNP markers were grouped into nine linkage groups (LGs) at high LOD threshold (=6). Marker order was subsequently determined by a regression mapping algorithm on the basis of a minimum LOD score of 1.0 and a recombination threshold of 0.4 in each LG. Recombination values were converted to genetic distance (cM) using the Kosambi mapping function.41 Each map was graphically visualized with MapChart.42 The EST-based SNP markers were named <Rs> <EST name or gene name> <s>.2.5. Comparison with the A. thaliana genome sequencesSequences in the A. thaliana genome homologous with the loci of EST-based SNP markers in the linkage map were surveyed using the BLASTN program of the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) with a threshold value of E < 10-20. Syntenic regions were identified according to the conserved collinearity of the markers of R. sativus and corresponding homologous genes of A. thaliana. A single non-collinear homologue in a syntenic region was ignored.3. Results and discussion3.1. SNP identification and production of DNA markersTo identify SNPs between the parental lines, i.e. ‘Sayatori’ and ‘Aokubi’, 4709 primer pairs were designed and used for amplification of coding regions of genes containing 3'-untranslated regions, and single DNA fragments in both parental lines were amplified by PCR with 3576 primer pairs and sequenced. After trimming ambiguous sequences at both ends and excluding the sequences with a quality score <90% (Sequencher, http://www.genecodes.com/), 2290 sequences, covering 791.9 kb, were obtained (Supplementary Table S2). Among them, 1465 (64.0%) DNA fragments showed nucleotide polymorphism. The frequency of variable bases, i.e. SNPs and indels, was 1/72 bp, and the frequency of SNPs was 1/107 bp. As continuous SNPs or indels can be designed as one marker, such sites were regarded as one SNP site or one indel site. The frequencies of SNP sites and indel sites were 1/115 and 1/520 bp, respectively. These results suggest that the use of SNP markers enables construction of a high-density EST-based genetic map. Of the 1465 sequences having SNPs or indels between the parental lines, we randomly selected 1410 fragments for designing dot-blot-SNP markers.3.2. Dot-blot-SNP analysis and mappingSince dot-blot-SNP analysis allows hybridization of only a fully complementary sequence without hybridization of a mismatched sequence, this method ensures accuracy of genotyping,37 and enables genotyping of multiple-copy genes in polyploid species, e.g. B. napus, and diploid species having ancestral genome replication, e.g. B. rapa and R. sativus. In MPMP dot-blot-SNP analysis, more than half of the makers showed allele-specific signals in the first round of probe hybridization under the conditions predicted by the method of Shiokai et al.32 In the second round of probe hybridization, conditions were adjusted according to the signals shown in the first round. At most, three rounds of probe hybridization were conducted. The results of the genotyping data were consistent with the dot-blot-SNP method using a single SNP marker. In this way, the MPMP dot-blot-SNP method was found to speed up the genotyping and to reduce the cost of analysis. Of the 1410 dot-blot-SNP markers, 881 yielded clear dot-blot signals with distinct differences between SNP alleles.Using 772 dot-blot-SNP markers among the 881 SNP markers, genotypes of 189 F2 plants were analysed. By linkage analysis with the JoinMap 4.0 software, 746 were assigned to nine LGs. Primer sequences, probe sequences, and hybridization conditions of the 746 markers are listed in Supplementary Table S3. Nine LGs were designated as LG1–LG9 in decreasing order of map distances (cM) (Fig. 1). The longest group LG1 consisting of 88 markers and the shortest one LG9 consisting of 75 markers have lengths of 126.5 and 62.7 cM, respectively. The total length covered by the linkage map was 806.7 cM with an average distance of intervals between markers of 1.1 cM. Based on the physical length of 530 Mb in R. sativus,43 1 cM was estimated to be 657 kb. A linkage map of R. sativus with a comparative map of A. thaliana.

Each locus was tested for homology with A. thaliana using BLAST and segments of two or more markers showing homology with A. thaliana in collinearity are regarded as syntenic regions, which are shown to the right of the R. sativus LGs as coloured vertical bars.

Except for both ends of each syntenic region, the names of identified homologous loci in A. thaliana are not shown, but are shown in Supplementary Table S4.A linkage map of R. sativus with a comparative map of A. thaliana.

Except for both ends of each syntenic region, the names of identified homologous loci in A. thaliana are not shown, but are shown in Supplementary Table S4.Many ESTs, which were used for developing the markers in the present study, have high similarity to genes with known or hypothetical functions. For example, on the shortest LG9, RsFLC1 amplified by the primers designed from BrFLC1 (accession no. AY115678.1) was mapped. LG9 also contained RS2CL4436, a homologue of AtPPa in the S locus of B. rapa (AB257127.1), and Rs2CL2115, a homologue of the B. rapa disease resistance gene BrTN3 (FJ842847.1). Furthermore, ESTs homologous to A. thaliana genes involved in cadmium ion transmembrane transportation (NM_104680.2), salt stress response (NM_106207.3), cold and drought response (NM_122163.2), sucrose synthesis (NM_122090.3), and amino acid biosynthesis (NM_001036839.2) were mapped on LG9. Other LGs also contain many interesting genes.3.3. Synteny between R. sativus and A. thalianaAs protein-coding regions in the genomes are conserved in related species more than intergenic regions, EST-based markers are useful for comparative mapping between them. We searched for genes homologous with these markers in the A. thaliana genome by BLASTN. The results are shown in Supplementary Table S4. Under a significance threshold of E < 10-20, A. thaliana loci homologous with 726 R. sativus markers were identified, these homologous loci covering nearly the whole genome of A. thaliana. The five chromosomes of A. thaliana were divided into many segments and distributed to various regions of the R. sativus map (Fig. 1). There were 72 syntenic regions, mostly containing at least three markers and having conserved collinearity with the homologues in A. thaliana. The whole LG8 showed collinearity to more than half of chromosome 1 of A. thaliana. This synteny information is considered to be useful for utilizing the genome information of A. thaliana in the study of R. sativus and may speed up map-based cloning, as shown in B. rapa.7,44The 24 genomic blocks within the ancestral karyotype proposed by Schranz et al.5 have been identified in many species of the family Brassicaceae4,16,23–25,45 and can contribute to build a unified comparative genomics system in the Brassicaceae. The genome structure of R. sativus was reconstructed by these genomic blocks (Fig. 2). Except for the G block, all the blocks were found in the genome of R. sativus. The absence of G block in the present map is possibly due to its shortness and closeness to the AK3 centromere of the Brassicaceae ancestral karyotype.5 Half of the genomic blocks within the Brassicaceae ancestral karyotype, including A, B, C, E, F, I, J, O, P, R, U, and W, were triplicated. Some parts of A, U, and E blocks were revealed to have been further replicated, resulting in four, four, and six copies, respectively. It has also been reported that half of the genomic blocks are triplicated, while others occur only once or twice in B. rapa genome.16 These results indicate recent replication and loss of blocks during genomic evolutionary processes from the paleohexaploid to the present Brassiceae species. Some neighbouring blocks, e.g. I/J, A/B, and O/P, in the Brassicaceae ancestral karyotype were not separated in the genome of R. sativus. One chromosome (AK1) of the Brassicaceae ancestral karyotype comprising A, B, and C blocks was found to be completely conserved, forming LG8 of R. sativus, as the case of S05 in S. alba.25 The other copies of AK1 may have incurred genomic rearrangement and dispersed in LG1, LG2, and LG7. The blocks of V, K, L, Q, and X from different chromosomes of the Brassicaceae ancestral karyotype associated to form parts of LG1 and LG3. Similarly, the blocks of R, W, O, and P associated to form parts of LG4 and LG6, and possibly LG5. These V/K/L/Q/X, R/W, and O/P block associations have been detected in the Proto-Calepineae karyotype (Supplementary Fig. S1),4 and found to be replicated in the A, B, and C genomes of Brassica species.4,5,19,24 In S. alba, although V/K/L/Q/X block association has not been observed, probably due to the small number of markers used, R/W block association has been found to be triplicated.25 These findings reinforce the hypothesis on the origin of the Brassicaceae lineage II from the common Proto-Calepineae karyotype.4Genome structure of R. sativus based on 24 genomic blocks within the Brassicaceae ancestral karyotype. The genomic blocks of the Brassicaceae ancestral karyotype, shown on the bottom right, are labelled by the letters A to X. One of the eight colours corresponds to each chromosome. Boundaries of the blocks are defined by their flanking locus name of A. thaliana, according to Schranz et al.5 The position of each genomic block in R. sativus was defined according to the comparative map of R. sativus and A. thaliana in Fig. 1.Genome structure of R. sativus based on 24 genomic blocks within the Brassicaceae ancestral karyotype.

Boundaries of the blocks are defined by their flanking locus name of A. thaliana, according to Schranz et al.5 The position of each genomic block in R. sativus was defined according to the comparative map of R. sativus and A. thaliana in Fig. 1.3.4. Identification of homoeology between the genomes in Brassiceae speciesIn terms of the 24 genomic blocks within the Brassicaceae ancestral karyotype, the structures of the A, B, and C genomes of Brassica species and that of S. alba have been reconstructed.5,16,24,25 The chromosome organization of R. satiuvs was compared with those of the four genomes using these genomic blocks. Eight groups were formed with the extent of homoeology between them, as shown in Fig. 3. Except for LG5 of R. sativus, in which only short regions such as W/E and O/P were shared by other chromosomes, all the chromosomes in R. sativus were inferred to have corresponding homoeologous chromosomes in other species. Large homoeologous regions could be observed in each set of homoeologous chromosomes. According to the homoeology shared between them, we assign a new nomenclature for the R. satiuvs LGs, i.e. R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, and R9 to LG8, LG4, LG6, LG3, LG2, LG1, LG9, LG7, and LG5, respectively. Only R1 (LG8) and S05 are homoeologous to AK1, which was rearranged in the Brassica A, B, and C genomes (Fig. 3a). The structure of R2 (LG4) is nearly the same as that of B2, while the U block is not shared by A2, C2, and S09 (Fig. 3b). Since the Rapa/Oleracea lineage including R. sativs and the Nigra lineage are considered to have diverged ~7.9 Mya,14 U/R/W/O/P/E shared by both B. nigra and R. sativus might be of a more ancestral Brassiceae chromosome. The genomic blocks in R3 (LG6) could be found in all the other homoeologous chromosomes except that I, P, and O blocks were not detected in S03 of S. alba (Fig. 3c). Block association N/S/T/I/J was conserved in all genomes except for S. alba (Fig. 3d), although rearrangements may have occurred in R. sativus, B. nigra, and B. oleracea. Block association F/C/J was shared by A5 and B5 (Fig. 3e), while F/C/B/A was conserved in R5 (LG2) and C5. Since the A, B, and C genomic blocks originally neighboured, formation of F/C/J needs more arrangement than that of A/B/C/F, indicating A/B/C/F to be more ancestral than F/C/J. Block association A/B/C was conserved in A6, B6, and S07 (Fig. 3f), and block association V/K/L/Q/X was shared by all homoeologous chromosomes except for S07. N/E block association in R7 (LG9) was found to be shared by A7 and C7 (Fig. 3g), while it was not detected in B. nigra and S. alba, revealing that it was formed after the split time between the Rapa/Oleracea lineage and the Nigra lineage. The A, B, C, T, and U genomic blocks were present in both R8 (LG7) and A8 (Fig. 3h), and A, B, U, and C blocks were also detected in C8 and S08, indicating a high syntenic relationship between them.

Eight homoeologous chromosome sets [from (a) to (h)] were grouped with the extent of homoeology between them. LG5 of R. sativus is not shown, because a corresponding homoeologous chromosome in other species was not identified. The block arrangements in the A, B, and C genomes of Brassica species are based on Panjabi et al.,24 except that A3 and A8 are based on Mun et al.24 and Trick et al.,48 respectively.

The block arrangements in S. alba are based on Nelson et al.25Since the A, B, and C genomes of Brassica species are of major economic and calorific importance, contributing to a lot of world-wide edible vegetables and oil crops, great progress has been achieved in their genetics and genomics studies (www.brassica.info), especially in the A genome (http://www.brassica-rapa.org/BRGP/index.jsp). The chromosome A3 in B. rapa has been sequenced using the traditional Sanger technology.46 Recently, next-generation sequencing technology has also been used to determine the genome sequence of B. rapa, and 183 scaffolds have been anchored onto the chromosomes, the total coverage of the genome being 88.9%.47 The homoeology shared between R. sativus and the A, B, and C genomes of Brassica species indicates that genomic study of R. sativus would benefit from the rich genomic information available in Brassica species and inversely may also promote the study of Brassica species.4. ConclusionHigh frequency of SNPs and a high-efficiency SNP genotyping method developed in the present study facilitated the construction of a high-density R. sativus linkage map with EST-based SNP markers. Establishment of syntenic relationship between R. sativus and A. thaliana based on these EST markers would be greatly beneficial for identification and positional cloning of genes involved in important agronomic traits in R. sativus. Identification of the chromosome homoeology in Brassiceae species based on 24 genomic blocks of the ancestral karyotype would facilitate transfer of available genomic information between the homoeologous chromosomes to speeding up the exploration of genetic resources in Brassiceae species.

IntroductionMycoplasma hyopneumoniae is the key aetiological agent of porcine enzootic pneumonia (EP) and is a major contributor to porcine respiratory disease complex.1 EP is a chronic respiratory disease that mainly affects finishing pigs. Although major efforts to control M. hyopneumoniae infection and its detrimental effects have been made, swine production has suffered from significant economic loss.Like other mycoplasmas, M. hyopneumoniae has a small genome with limited biosynthetic potential.2–4 Up until now, four M. hyopneumoniae genome strains have been sequenced.2–4 Despite the significant amount of data produced by genome sequencing, information on its open read frame (ORF) cluster (OC) organization, transcriptional unit (TU) formation and transcriptional regulation is very limited. Genes organized in an ORF cluster (OC) or TU are arranged in tandem in the genomic sequence, being delimited by the location of the upstream promoter and the downstream transcriptional terminator. TU identification is commonly based on bioinformatics approaches combined with experimental data. Mycoplasma studies have demonstrated the occurrence of polycistronic mRNA and TUs in some genomic regions.5–12 However, information on characterized TUs is available for exceptional cases, making it difficult to judge the accuracy of current in silico TU or OC prediction methods in mycoplasma genome sequences.Prediction and recognition of mycoplasma promoter elements are poorly developed. The unusual A + T content of intergenic regions (IRs) in mycoplasma13 and the weak -35 consensus14 prevent efficient prediction of promoters by current bioinformatics approaches. Moreover, in spite of the development of artificial transformation and other genetic tools for some species of Mycoplasma,14–17 these methodologies are yet to be developed for M. hyopneumoniae. Therefore, strategies for the mapping of genome organization and gene transcription in M. hyopneumoniae can help understand regulatory mechanisms and form the basis for future work on mapping promoters and terminators.Information regarding transcription promoter or terminator sequences have yet to be defined in M. hyopneumoniae. Therefore, any analyses at the level of transcription regulation are difficult. Recently, Gardner and Minion18 demonstrated that transcription occurs in IRs of M. hyopneumoniae, indicating that M. hyopneumoniae does not strictly control transcription termination. An analysis of the average RNA folding energy near stop codons suggested that no stem-loops are formed in Mycoplasma genitalium and Mycoplasma pneumoniae TUs, indicating the existence of qualitatively different and uncharacterized mechanisms for transcription termination.19 Defining a transcription termination region in mycoplasmas has revealed some contradictory results. In some operons of M. genitalium,8 the presence of stem-loop structures have been found, and results from Hoon et al.20 suggest that the Rho-independent terminator represents the main mode of transcriptional termination in mycoplasmas. However, it has been suggested that genes are arranged in long clusters in mycoplasmas, indicating the possibility that the starting point of transcription occurs in the first gene and stops at low frequencies due to the absence of specific regions for transcription termination.21Although gene co-regulation occurs in mycoplasmas, to date only little information is available on ORF organization in the M. hyopneumoniae genome, as well as its relationship with pathogenicity. In order to establish differences between the gene organization of pathogenic and non-pathogenic M. hyopneumoniae and also to relate this gene organization to transcription regulatory mechanisms, we systematically analysed the synteny and conservation of ORF order among three M. hyopneumoniae genomes (two pathogenic strains: 7448 and 232; one non-pathogenic strain: J). We then performed the experimental characterization of some OCs predicted in the M. hyopneumoniae 7448 strain. This is the first report where gene organization analysis was systematically performed and compared in three M. hyopneumoniae genomes, two of which are pathogenic to swines and a significant number of predicted OCs are experimentally demonstrated and named TUs. These results could contribute to promote the understanding of M. hyopneumoniae transcription regulation.2. Materials and methods2.1. In silico analysis of TUsOC prediction was performed by Artemis Release 10.5.2 software.22 The criteria for the manual examination of possible OCs in M. hyopneumoniae genomes (MHP7448_GenBank: NC_007332; MHP232_GenBank: NC_006360 and MHPJ_GenBank: NC_007295) were established on the occurrence of clusters with two or more genes in tandem in the same DNA strand. This was performed by systematic annotation comparison of the protein sequences encoded in all ORFs from the analysed genomes. According to the complexity of adjacent ORF rearrangements, two groups were created: OCs characterized by the presence of two or more ORFs in the same DNA strand until the occurrence of ORFs in the opposite strand, and monocistronic (mC) group representing single ORFs. Differences in the annotation among the genomes were evaluated by comparing protein sequences using the NCBI/BLASTP program.The comparative analysis of OC organization found among the three M. hyopneumoniae genomes (7448, 232 and J) was accomplished based on the M. hyopneumoniae 7448 genome results by Artemis Comparison tools Release 9.0.232.2. Primer designThe primers were designed in Vector NTI Advance 10 (Invitrogen) based on the M. hyopneumoniae 7448 genome sequence (GenBank: NC_007332). Primer pairs were chosen to enable synthesis by reverse transcriptase–PCR (RT–PCR), whose products span each IR, demonstrating the occurrence of polycistronic mRNA and confirming the prediction previously made. The OC7448111 (Fig. 1) was used as an example where three primer pairs were designed for utilization in the RT–PCR analysis. As shown in Fig. 1, primer pairs were distributed in the predicted OC and used in the following combination in the RT–PCRs: 1°F/1°R; 2°F/2°R; 3°F/3°R; 1°F/2°R and 2°F/3°R. To generate experimental data, a total of 71 primer pairs were projected and employed with this methodology (Supplementary Table S1). OCs in M. hyopneumoniae.

DNA and RNA manipulationsMycoplasma hyopneumoniae strain 7448 was grown in 5 and 25 ml of Friis broth24 at 37°C for 48 h for DNA extraction and RNA isolation, respectively. Genomic DNA of M. hyopneumoniae was isolated using standard protocols.25 The quality of the isolated DNA was verified by gel electrophoresis and displayed pure high-molecular-weight DNA.Total RNA of M. hyopneumoniae extraction was performed with Trizol® (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's guidelines, including 1 U/µg DNase/RNAse free (Promega) treatment, and then the extracted RNA was quantified in Qubit™ system (Invitrogen) and also analysed by gel electrophoresis. The RNA extraction was stored at -70°C.2.4. Reverse transcriptase–PCRA first-strand cDNA synthesis reaction was conducted by adding 1 µg of total RNA to 132.5 ng of pd(N)6 random hexamer (GE Healthcare) and 10 mM deoxynucleotide triphosphates. The mixture was heated to 65°C for 5 min and then incubated on ice for 1 min. First-strand buffer (250 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.3, 375 mM KCl, 15 mM MgCl2), 0.1 M dithiothreitol, 40 U RNase inhibitor (Invitrogen) and 200 U M-MLV RT (Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus Reverse Transcriptase—Invitrogen) was then added to a total volume of 20 µl. The reaction mixture was incubated at 25°C for 10 min and at 37°C for 50 min followed by 15 min at 70°C. Negative control was prepared in parallel, differing only by the absence of the RT enzyme.PCRs included 1 U Taq DNA polymerase (Cenbiot Enzimas), 10× buffer (100 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.5, 500 mM KCl), 1 mM magnesium chloride, 100 mM deoxynucleotide triphosphates, 10 pmol of each primer (Supplementary Table S1) and 1 µl of the first-strand cDNA reaction in a final volume of 25 µl. Negative control of RT–PCR was prepared in parallel, which differed only by the absence of cDNA, and no genomic DNA was added to the reaction mixture for the PCR control. PCR positive control was prepared using the genomic DNA of M. hyopneumoniae as a template. The PCR conditions were as follows: 1 cycle at 94°C for 5 min was followed by 30 cycles of 94°C for 30 s; denaturation and extension temperature and time varied according to each primer pair (Supplementary Table S1). The final extension step was at 72°C for 10 min. Reaction products were analysed in 1.2% agarose gels and fragments of the expected size were precipitated with tRNA (Invitrogen) as follows. To each RT–PCR (22 µl), 1 µg of tRNA and 2.5 V of absolute ethanol (4°C) were added and then incubated for 16 h at -20°C. After 30 min of centrifugation and wash with 70% ethanol, the pellets were resuspended in 15 µl of ultrapure water and sequenced with the DYEnamic ET Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Amersham Biosciences) in the MegaBACE 1000, as recommended by the manufacturer.3. Results and discussion3.1. Genes in M. hyopneumoniae are preferably organized in OCsThis study represents a global assessment of OC organization with in silico and in vitro analysis of the M. hyopneumoniae genome. Our detailed analysis indicated that genes are organized preferably in OCs. The gene-by-gene genome organization of the three strains of M. hyopneumoniae was analysed, gene localization was compared to detect ORFs with order conservation and two groups were created as described in Materials and methods: the OC group (named OC74481–OC7448117 in the 7448 strain; OCJ1–OCJ117 in the J strain and OC2321–OC232116 in the 232 strain) and the mC group (named mC74481–mC744834 in the 7448 strain; mCJ1–mCJ34 in the J strain and mC2321–mC23236 in the 232 strain). In summary, 117 OCs and 34 mCs (strains 7448 and J) and 116 OCs and 36 mCs (strain 232) were detected (Table 1). The mC ORFs of the three M. hyopneumoniae strains are listed in Supplementary Table S2. Surprisingly, just 5% of the ORFs in the three genomes were mC. Therefore, the majority (95%) of M. hyopneumoniae ORFs are transcribed in long polycistronic mRNAs, thus forming extensive OCs. Moreover, the ORF numbers that constitute each OC was very variable (Table 2). As shown in Table 2, the majority of the OCs were composed of two ORFs (22%), with increasing numbers of up to 29 ORFs. Interestingly, in the three genomes analysed, approximately 85% of the OCs were composed of two to eight ORFs, demonstrating the presence of OCs with fewer numbers of ORFs.

In the genus Mycoplasma, during genome reduction both processes seem to have occurred. In M. hyopneumoniae, the genome has been reduced by a loss of genes as those related with the ability to formylate Met-tRNAi3 among others. Moreover, as shown in Table 2, the density of genes in OC74487 and OC7448102 could be explained by the genome compaction. Our results in Table 2 are in agreement with those reported by Rogozin et al.,26 suggesting that, in diverse organisms, the majority of gene clusters are formed by a strings of two to four genes. Therefore, this arrangement found in the three M. hyopneumoniae strains could be the result of the maintenance of the size of the gene clusters during genome reduction.3.2. High level of synteny of the OCs is found among M. hyopneumoniae strainsDetailed analysis of each OC revealed a high level of synteny between the OCs defined for the 7448 and J strains as well as for the 7448 and 232 strains. Gene order was conserved with 85% similarity when comparing the 7448 and J strains, and 82% when comparing the 7448 and 232 strains (Table 1, Supplementary Tables S3–S5). Previous comparative analysis of these three genomes was performed at a genomic scale and strain-specific differences were demonstrated, but high rates of conservation were detected in regions of rearrangements, which were probably involved in pathogenesis.3 In agreement with Vasconcelos et al.,3 our work also demonstrated that the prevalence of ORFs transcribed in the DNA strand with conserved OCs reflected the high level of synteny among the strains' genomes. This occurs not only due to the same arrangement of ORFs but, more interestingly, also due to the presence of IRs of the same size. Although most of the strains display high synteny, low-degree conservation regions also occur. The analysis of genome regions with lower synteny evidences differences in ORF organization and size of intergenic distance. Some cases with common differences are shown in Fig. 2 and are related to: (Fig. 2A) ORFs that are separated into different OCs (for example OC23246, OC744810 and OC744847, Supplementary Tables S3 and S5); (Fig. 2B) addition or removal of OCs (see OC23202 and mC23201, mC744801 and mC744802, Supplementary Tables S2, S3 and S5); (Fig. 2C) OCs with addition or removal of ORFs, generally encoding hypothetic proteins (for example OC744806 and OC23207 or OC7448100 and OCJ100, Supplementary Tables S3–S5).

(C) OCs with addition or removal of ORFs, generally encoding hypothetic proteins. The bars connecting the arrows represent close matches. White arrowheads represent the ORFs and indicate the direction of transcription.In M. hyopneumoniae, the overall distribution of ORFs within the OCs is highly variable in the number of ORFs and size of the intergenic distances, as well as in the functional categories of the encoded products. Approximately 92% of the OCs display some variations related to these parameters (see Supplementary Tables S3–S5). However, some of the OCs are composed of ORFs whose products are related functionally, some examples are: OC744822, OC744843, OC744886, OC7448105 and OC7448115, all OCs with orthologs in the 232 and J strains (Supplementary Tables S3–S5). Taken together, these results suggest that the classical definition of operon cannot be applied to M. hyopneumoniae genomes.Despite the high level of synteny between the genomes of M. hyopneumoniae 7448, J and 232, strain-specific differences, such as inverted regions and rearrangements, were demonstrated, being potentially related to pathogenesis.3 The inverted segment present in the 232 strain was further analysed and compared with the cognate 7448 region, taking into consideration the ORF string organization and OC distribution (Fig. 3). In M. hyopneumoniae 232, this region corresponds to genome positions from nucleotides 104 691–353 186 bp (OC23211–OC23246), with a total length of 248 495 bp. In M. hyopneumoniae 7448, the equivalent location is from nucleotides 101 560–354 533 bp (OC744810–OC744846), with a size of 252 973 bp. In this location, the overall conservation of gene order and OC distribution were preserved (Fig. 3). Typical examples of this organization are OC744828 and OC23228, each containing 29 ORFs. Other examples are OC23215 and OC744841 with 12 conserved ORFs each (see Supplementary Tables S3 and S5). A closer inspection of the regions bordering these inverted genome segments showed that, in each case, OC conservation was also preserved (see OC23210 and OC74489). Therefore, the genome was inverted but the ORF organization was maintained. Moreover, at the right border side, the distribution of the ORF order was maintained, even when OC23246 split from OC744810 and OC744847. It should be noted that the inversion event did not change the relative ORF order in the OCs. Taken together, these results demonstrate the similarity in ORF strings among the three strains, further supporting the hypotheses of Chen et al.27 Price et al.28 and Roback et al.29 that the conservation in OC or TU organization in two or more phylogenetically related species is an important criterion for OC and after TU determination. Therefore, our results suggest that comparative genomics is a plausible approach for predicting OCs in mycoplasma genomes.

The other detached OCs are discussed in the text. Visualization by the software Artemis Compare.Some of the differences in ORF strings found among the three M. hyopneumoniae strains could be related to the presence of transposases or to the integrative conjugative element.3 Although the number of transposases is almost similar in all the three genomes (Table 1), their localization in some cases, probably, could be involved in the generation of instable regions where most changes occur, leaving the rest of the genome stable. The integrative conjugative element (ICEH), related to genome rearrangement and probably pathogenesis, is present in the genomes of M. hyopneumoniae 7448 and 232 strains but have a different organization.3 The ICEH is located within OC744870, together with ORFs usually associated with bacterial conjugative elements and ORFs encoding hypothetical products, and within OC23286 with a similar organization.3.3. Experimental analysis of OCs cotranscriptionAiming to validate some of the OCs predicted by our in silico analysis, 21 OCs encompassing 115 ORFs from M. hyopneumoniae 7448 were further characterized, corresponding to 17% of the total ORFs in the genome and 18% of the predicted OCs (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S6). The selection of these OCs was initially based on functional category variation among the ORFs and OCs with ORFs with long IRs. Usually, experimental validation of TUs is often established by measuring the length of mRNAs through Northern analysis. However, this approach failed to yield reliable transcript sizes in our experiments (data not shown). This experimental difficulty was also reported for other mycoplasmas and is probably due to the large size and instability of the transcripts in this genus.7,8 Therefore, we performed gene-specific RT–PCR strategy to amplify the IRs between the ORFs of the predicted OC7448 for experimental validation. Briefly, as shown in Fig. 1, we designed primer pairs that would only amplify a product if adjacent genes could be found on a single mRNA molecule. In the example shown in Fig. 1, OC7448111 encompassed four ORFs and one tRNA gene and amplicons were generated from: MHP7448_0653 and ksgA (amplicon 263 bp), ksgA and rpsL (amplicon 706 bp), rpsL and tRNA30 (amplicon 357 bp), MHP7448_0653 and rpsL (amplicon 1555 bp), ksgA and tRNA30 (amplicon 1157 bp), indicating that a polycistronic mRNA spanning from MHP7448_0653 to tRNA30 is produced.The experimental data from RT–PCR analysis of M. hyopneumoniae 7448, using primer pairs to each gene spanning the junctions between genes, demonstrated that the ORFs localized within each OC were linked. Therefore, 18% of the OCs characterized in silico in the 7448 strain were validated, corresponding to 21 of 117 OCs (Supplementary Table S6). To better demonstrate these results, three segments of the M. hyopneumoniae 7448 genome encompassing 63.2 kb (Fig. 4A), 27.5 kb (Fig. 4B) and 21.4 kb (Fig. 4C) are shown. The first genome region analysed contained nine OCs (OC7448109–OC7448117) with a total of 44 ORFs (Fig. 4A), representing the typical ORF string distribution as previously described: (i) ORF number: two ORFs in OC7448110, OC7448113, OC7448114, OC7448115 up until 11 ORFs in OC7448109; (ii) ORF product: OC7448114 products from the same functional category and OC7448112 products not functionally related and (iii) ORF string conservation: OC7448112 with conserved gene order in OCJ112 and OC232111; OC7448113 with same gene order as OCJ113 and OC232112 (Supplementary Tables S4–S6).

Visualization by the software Artemis.Some reports have suggested that genes co-transcribed as TUs or operons are likely to be compactly arranged on the genome with short IRs, although there are cases where regulatory elements can cause variations in the length of TUs.30,31Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae has a reduced genome with limited biosynthetic potential, and the presence of short intergenic sequences would help us to allow efficient transcription. Interestingly, the size of the IRs was extremely variable within different OCs (Supplementary Tables S3–S5). RT–PCRs with specific primers were applied to amplify all the IRs present in the 21 OCs and cotranscription was observed, even with large IRs (Fig. 4B, Supplementary Table S6). The OC744833 contained six ORFs (Supplementary Table S6) with a significant variation in the IR: (i) IR length of 2757 bp between glyA and nrdF genes; (ii) IR length of 2 bp between nrdF and nrdI genes; (iii) IR length of 76 bp between nrdI and nrdE genes; (iv) IR length of 89 bp between nrdE gene and an ORF encoding a hypothetical protein (MHP7448_0220) and (v) IR length of 711 bp between two ORFs encoding hypothetical proteins (MHP7448_0220 and MHP7448_0219).3.4. Cotranscription of ORF strings in the same DNA strandThe genome region detailed in Fig. 4C illustrates the analysis to validate the criteria used in silico for OC definition, based on the presence of ORF strings in the same DNA strand until the occurrence of ORFs in the opposite strand. The ORF strings in OC744890 and OC744891 were interrupted by the presence of mC744825 in the opposite strand. For the RT–PCRs, two primer pairs were designed to evaluate the presence of a polycistronic transcript corresponding to the ORFs strings in OC744890 plus OC744891. The first primer pair (gyrF/gyrR, Supplementary Table S1) amplified a 941 bp DNA fragment of the MHP7448_0528_gyrA (mC744825). The other primer pair was localized within the coding sequence of first ORF (deo) of OC744890 and in the IR between OC744890 and OC744891 (gyr/deoC, Supplementary Table S1), potentially generating an amplification of 1338 bp. Although the presence of mRNA for the gyrA ORF was demonstrated, no transcript (single polycistronic mRNA) was observed, including both OC (OC744890 plus OC744891) ORF strings. Therefore, these results support the criteria used in silico for defining the OCs characterized by the presence of two or more ORFs in the same DNA strand until the occurrence of ORFs in the opposite strand. Taken together, these findings demonstrated that the typical gene organization present in other bacteria, as Escherichia coli or Bacillus subtilis, cannot be applied to M. hyopneumoniae genome.Although in M. hyopneumoniae genes are arranged in long clusters, suggesting that the starting point of transcription occurs in the first gene, the transcription termination regions have yet to be defined. Aiming to contribute to the definition of the terminator sequences, one IR between OC7448112 and OC7448113 (see Fig. 1A) was analysed by RT–PCR. Primers pairs were designed to amplify the region between the ends of each OC (Supplementary Fig. S1). Our results demonstrate the presence of transcripts in this region, suggesting the absence of specific regions for transcription termination. These findings are supported by the observation of Gardner and Minion18 that transcription occurs in IRs of M. hyopneumoniae, and that transcription run off the end of the last ORF.The gene encoding the elongation factor Tu (tuf) is the last of five ORFs to constitute an OC (OC744890), expressed from a promoter upstream of the first ORF (deoC) (Supplementary Table S6, Fig. 4C). However, in the 299 bp IR between tuf and lon, a promoter-like sequence was found by primer extension analysis (data not shown). The OC744890 represents a typical OC in M. hyopneumoniae, with ORFs encoding products not related functionally as deoC (deoxyribose-phosphate aldolase), upp (uracil phosphoribosyltransferase), MHP7448_0525 (hypothetical protein), lon (heat shock ATP-dependent protease) and tuf (elongation factor Tu, EF-Tu).EF-Tu is necessary for protein synthesis in metabolically active cells, being possibly involved in the synthesis of alternative transcripts in the M. hyopneumoniae 7448 strain. It is already known that, in TUs, discoordinate expression occurs when the product of an individual gene needs to be expressed apart from the others to mediate a different role.31,32 The OC744890 has upstream and internal promoters resulting in two different sizes of clusters, indicating that the entire OC could be expressed from a common promoter or a subset of the OC (tuf) is separately transcribed in response to a specific signal. Previous reports have suggested a relationship between the expanded IRs and presence of internal regulatory elements in highly expressed TUs.31,33 Güell et al.12 in an M. pneumoniae transcriptome analysis demonstrated many alternative transcripts. The experimental evidence of the presence of regulatory elements such as internal promoters in the expanded IRs provided by the analysis of the tuf gene (IR of 299 bp between adjacent genes) and the variable size of the M. hyopneumoniae IRs analysed by RT–PCR suggest the presence of internal promoters in the IRs of M. hyopneumoniae OCs and a complexity in transcription regulation.4. ConclusionsDifferent approaches have been used to analyse gene organization in bacterial genomes through the development of new algorithm34 or prediction programs,35,36 which are based on characteristics such as intergenic distance, closely related gene function, conservation of gene order in phylogenetically close genomes, or even the prediction of promoter region37 and transcriptional terminators.19,20 Although these algorithms have shown a great promise in terms of being able to predict operon structure with a high degree of specificity and sensitivity, the data that they rely on are available only for a small number of bacterial species36 and their application to all bacterial species could present some difficulties. Furthermore, combinations of these prediction analyses with experimental data are scarce. Not surprisingly, analysis of OC prediction followed by experimental confirmation in mycoplasma genomes was not conducted prior to this study. Moreover, experimental data on TUs are also scarce.Similar to M. hyopneumoniae genes, some M. pneumoniae genes are arranged in long OCs but only with short or almost no intergenic sequences.12 Analysis of P97 and P102 paralog families have also suggested that a distance of up to 54 bp is an upper limit for defining the cotranscript structure in M. hyopneumoniae.9 However, we have systematically mapped in silico all the OCs in three different strains of M. hyopneumoniae and experimentally validated 115 ORFs in 21 OCs with variably sized IRs in the 7448 strain. It has been proposed that intergenic distances between ORFs in OCs are similar in prokaryotes and can be used to predict OCs and to estimate the total number of OCs in genomes.26,28,29,38,39 However, according to our analysis, the distance models do not seem to be applicable for OC prediction in M. hyopneumoniae genomes. Furthermore, the variability in size of intergenic distances within an OC can be related to the complexity of mechanisms of gene regulation. Therefore, the unusual distribution of intergenic distances between ORFs within OCs in M. hyopneumoniae may reflect a biological difference in the genome structure as previous suggested for Synechocystis.28 Furthermore, transcription analysis across the IRs of the M. hyopneumoniae 232 genome demonstrated the presence of transcripts in the IRs and that transcription run off the end of the last ORF and RNA polymerase is gradually released from template.18Taken together, these findings suggest that OCs are continuously transcribed until reaching the next OC or ORF present in the opposite strand. However, a subset of the OCs could be independently transcribed due to the presence of internal promoters. These new data suggest complex transcriptional organization in M. hyopneumoniae genomes and the probability of the occurrence of other not-yet-known mechanisms that are involved in transcription. Furthermore, the high synteny of gene organization between pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains indicates that pathogenicity is not related to gene organization. The accelerating pace of molecular research into this important pathogen is certain to provide additional data to refine the results described in this work, forming a solid empirical foundation for our future understanding of the relationships between gene organization and transcription regulation in M. hyopneumoniae.Supplementary data:Supplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by grants from the Brazilian National Research Council (CNPq).Supplementary data"

IntroductionSake is a traditional Japanese alcoholic beverage that is fermented from steamed rice by the concerted action of two types of microorganisms, filamentous fungi and yeast. In the production of sake, enzymes secreted by the fungus Aspergillus oryzae, which is grown on steamed rice, convert rice starch into glucose. Yeast cells in the sake mash then produce ethanol, higher alcohols and their esters, organic acids and amino acids, which are important components that contribute to sake aroma and taste. Hence, the choice of a yeast strain is one of the most critical factors in determining the resulting aroma and taste characteristics of sake products. Yeast strains that were originally isolated in sake breweries have been identified as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and are now commercially distributed as sake yeast.1Phylogenetic studies conducted using DNA markers have indicated that sake yeast strains are closely related, forming a sake strain cluster that belongs to a lineage distinct from other industrial and laboratory strains in the phylogenetic tree of S. cerevisiae.2–5 Comprehensive genome-wide studies of diverse S. cerevisiae strains have also indicated the existence of a unique sake cluster that is distinct from wine and laboratory strains.6,7 Consistent with their unique phylogenetic position, sake yeast strains possess characteristic traits that differ from other S. cerevisiae strains and are ideal for sake brewing, including ability for high ethanol productivity (reaching 20%)1,8,9 efficient growth and fermentation at low temperatures (below 15°C).1 In addition, nearly all sake yeast strains generate a foam on the mash surface during the brewing process, which results from yeast cells fermenting sugars into CO2 bubbles10 and possess biotin biosynthetic ability.11Several sake yeast-specific genes that are responsible for the desirable features of sake yeast and affect the brewing process have been identified. For example, AWA1, which encodes a cell-surface hydrophobic protein with a GPI anchor, was identified from a sake yeast genome and is responsible for foam formation in sake mash.10 Many S. cerevisiae strains are biotin auxotrophs due to the lack of certain biotin biosynthetic pathway genes. BIO6, a homolog of a bacterial biotin biosynthetic pathway gene, was identified in sake yeast strains and is essential in them for the production of biotin.11 In addition to these studies, several genes involved in yeast's quantitative phenotypes, including fermentability and aroma production, have been suggested.12,13 However, because the genetic basis for the superiority of sake yeast in sake brewing is largely unknown, genome-wide genetic approaches are required to understand these complex traits. Since the first complete genome sequencing of strain S288C in 1996,14 the genomes of several other S. cerevisiae strains have been sequenced.15–18 Strains such as K11, Y9 and Y12 were also subjected to genome sequencing and the sake cluster was consequently proposed. However, in each case, total length of sequence reads reached <0.9-fold of the haploid genome, not enough to get whole picture of the genome.6 In addition, these sequenced strains are not the typical industrial sake yeast strains. Accordingly, yeast strains used in sake brewing have not been subjected to whole-genome analyses, despite their importance in industry and yeast phylogenetic systematics.In the present study, we performed the whole-genome sequencing of the sake yeast strain K7 (kyokai is the Japanese word for ‘society’) as the first step for subsequent functional, phylogenetic and evolutionary genomic studies. K7 has been one of the most extensively used industrial sake yeast strains over the past several decades and has also been employed in numerous genetic and biochemical studies as a model sake yeast and a parent strain for breeding.8,10–13,19–24 Here, we report the overall chromosome structure and remarkable features of the K7 genome.2. Materials and methods2.1. StrainSaccharomyces cerevisiae K7 was distributed to Japanese sake breweries by the Brewing Society of Japan in 2004 and used as a DNA donor.2.2. Sequencing, assembly and validationThe nucleotide sequence of the K7 genome was determined using the whole-genome shotgun sequencing approach. Genomic DNA was isolated from cells according to the method described by Hereford et al.25 Plasmid libraries with average insert sizes of 1.6 and 5.0 kb were constructed in pUC118 (Takara Bio Inc.), while a fosmid library with an average insert size of 35 kb was constructed in pCC1FOS (Epicentre Biotechnologies), as described previously.26 Raw sequence reads corresponding to a 9.1-fold coverage of the haploid genome (42 842, 88 830 and 15 227 reads from libraries with 1.6, 5.0 and 35 kb inserts, respectively) were first obtained by sequencing from both ends of the inserts on an ABI 3730xl DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Sequence reads were trimmed at a threshold quality value (Phred) of 20 and assembled using the Phrap assembler.27,28 We obtained a total of 712 contigs that were then put in order based on paired-end information from the constructed fosmid library to obtain supercontigs. The overall assembly was then validated and refined using Optical Mapping (OpGen, Inc.). A number of short contigs were incorporated into supercontigs with the assistance of optical maps and transposon-mediated random sequencing from fosmid clones (2112 reads). Following this analysis, the final contig number was reduced to 706.2.3. Sequence comparisonAn overall comparison of the K7 chromosomes with S288C (NC_001133–NC_001148), EC1118 (FN393058–FN393060, FN393062–FN393087, FN394216 and FN394217) and YJM789 (AAFW2000000) strain chromosomes was performed using MUMmer 3.0 software.29 Similarity-based searches of individual genes were performed using BLAST30 and BLAST2.31 Phylogenetic analyses were carried out using CLUSTALW 1.83.322.4. Extraction of heterozygous positionsTo determine the positions of heterozygosity in the K7 genome, nucleotide positions containing one or more bases different from the consensus base with the Phred quality values >20 were automatically extracted as candidates for heterozygous positions. The identified positions were then manually validated on the electropherogram to validate the sequence. Non-supercontig contigs, which failed to be assembled into supercontigs, were not included in the analysis because their chromosomal positions were unknown.2.5. Gene prediction and annotationFor predicting protein-encoding genes, ORFs larger than 90 bp were comprehensively included as candidates. ORF prediction was then carried out based on a direct comparison of S288C ORFs with the K7 genome supercontigs. When direct comparison was difficult, ORFs were predicted using the software programs CRITICA,33 Glimmer2,34 GlimmerHMM35 and SIM4.36 Finally, all K7 ORFs were manually validated by expert annotators. When one or more incomplete ORFs, such as those truncated by a sequence gap and lacking a start or a stop codon, were mapped to a single S288C ORF, each incomplete K7 ORF was annotated as a single ORF. Functional annotation was based primarily on the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD; http://www.yeastgenome.org/), secondarily on the Saccharomyces species database (yeast comparative genomics: http://www.broadinstitute.org/annotation/fungi/comp_yeasts/) and also on COG/KOG (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/COG/) and DDBJ/EMBL/GENBANK non-redundant databases. Orthology with the S288C ORF was evaluated using the BLASTP similarity and calculated as the percent of matched amino acid residues versus the total covered region between a K7 ORF and the best-hit S288C ORF (Supplementary Table S4) as truncated by a sequence gap. Similarity was calculated by the number of matching residues in only the corresponding regions of the S288C ORF. Dubious ORFs, ORFs in Ty elements and ORFs in telomeric regions were excluded as possible protein-coding genes and were not annotated. Prediction and annotation of RNA genes, Ty elements including solo long terminal repeats (LTRs) and telomeric elements were manually performed based on the results of BLASTN searches of the K7 genome with the S288C sequences of these genes and elements as queries.All annotated ORFs and genetic elements were given individual numbers (Supplementary Table S4). Nomenclature of the K7 genes was based on the following rules: (i) each protein-encoding or RNA gene was named according to the orthologous S288C gene using the format ‘K7_’ plus the S288C standard gene name (with >80% similarity) and the systematic name (with >50% similarity) given in SGD; (ii) K7 identification numbers or K7 original gene names, such as AWA1, were given to genes that were non-orthologous or of low similarity to S288C genes (with =50% similarity); (iii) each name of a gene truncated by a sequence gap or segmented by point mutations was followed by a lower case ‘a’, ‘b’ or ‘c’, such as ‘XXX1a’ and ‘XXX1b’, to show its correspondence to a partial region of the ortholog; and (iv) Ty elements and LTRs were independently termed according to the identical nomenclature used for S288C.3. Results and discussion3.1. Sequencing and assembly of the K7 genomeGenome sequencing of the diploid sake yeast strain K7 was performed by a whole-genome shotgun method that yielded 1.49 × 105 sequence reads with an estimated 9.24-fold redundancy of the haploid genome. Following de novo sequence assembly, 17 supercontigs were generated. Since homologous chromosome pairs of K7 were almost indistinguishable from each other during the assembly process, nearly all the reads from each homologous chromosome pair were assembled together into a single supercontig. Consequently, the resulting consensus chromosomal sequences represented a diploid genome, although they seemed to be that of a haploid genome. The total length of the supercontig corresponded to 98.1% of the estimated K7 genome size. The sequencing results and the assembled supercontigs are summarized in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2. Comparison with the S288C genome revealed that the 17 supercontigs corresponded to the set of S288C chromosomes and mitochondrial DNA (Fig. 1; Supplementary Table S2). No DNA sequence for the yeast 2-µg plasmid was detected from any reads, which was consistent with a previous study.37Dot-plot alignments of homologous chromosomes of S. cerevisiae strains K7 and S288C. The nucleotide sequence of each K7 supercontig was compared with that of the homologous S288C chromosome (indicated above each alignment) using MUMmer 3.0.Dot-plot alignments of homologous chromosomes of S. cerevisiae strains K7 and S288C. The nucleotide sequence of each K7 supercontig was compared with that of the homologous S288C chromosome (indicated above each alignment) using MUMmer 3.0.In the assembly process, only 200 of 706 contigs were used for generating the supercontigs because the remaining 506 contigs failed to align with any of the supercontigs. The total length of these non-supercontig contigs was ~604 kb. Of the 506 non-supercontig contigs, 360 (71.1%) were singletons and 395 (78.1%) contained <1000 bases (Supplementary Fig. S1A and B). The majority of these contigs seem to be excluded from the supercontigs due to the repetition of telomeric and Ty-related type sequences. The remainder seemed to be excluded as a result of considerable heterozygosity between the two homologous chromosomes due to base substitution, in-del, Ty insertion or other such events (Supplementary Fig. S1C and D). Several non-supercontig contigs contained ORF-like sequences that were not found in the supercontigs. For example, the nucleotide sequence of MATa was found in a non-supercontig contig due to its considerable heterozygosity, while the supercontig corresponding to the K7 chromosome III only contained the MATalpha sequence, even though K7 possesses both mating-type loci, MATalpha and MATa. Contigs including the sequence corresponding to VTH1/VTH2, which are paralogous and nearly indistinguishable from each other, were not assembled in the supercontigs, presumably due to adjacent repetitive sequences. Similarly, the sequence for ARR3 was also present only in the non-supercontig contigs (data not shown). The non-supercontig contigs were excluded from subsequent analyses such as comparison with related strains, gene prediction and the survey of heterozygosity and Ty elements.To date, the genome sequences of several S. cerevisiae strains have been reported; therefore, we compared the K7 genome with available genomes.14,15,17 Pairwise nucleotide polymorphisms among four strains (K7, S288C, YJM789 and EC1118) were analyzed by sequence alignment using MUMmer 3.0 software.29 The number of substitutions and small indels between K7 and the three other strains ranged from ~67 900 (5.6/kb) to 78 000 (6.5/kb) and ~19 300 (1.6/kb) to 23 500 (2.0/kb), respectively, while those among the remaining three non-K7 strains ranged from ~46 100 (3.8/kb) to 56 700 (4.7/kb) and ~14 800 (1.2/kb) to 16 700 (1.4/kb), respectively (Supplementary Fig. S2). These results indicate that the phylogenetic position of K7 is relatively distant from that of S288C, YJM789 and EC1118, as expected from previous studies.2,3,5–7,173.2. Inversions in chromosomes V and XIVWe compared chromosomal structures between K7 and S288C using MUMmer 3.0 software,29 as shown in Fig. 1. Although the overall genome structure of K7 closely resembled that of S288C, we identified two types of chromosomal rearrangements. One type involved several complicated subtelomeric rearrangements that are also observed or suggested by previous genome-wide studies of various S. cerevisiae strains, indicating that such rearrangements were not infrequent events.14,17,18,38–40 The other type of rearrangement was characterized by two large internal inverted regions. We confirmed that these inversions were homozygous by PCR analysis (data not shown). One inversion of the ~100-kb region on the right arm of chromosome V had not previously been described. Both boundary regions of this inversion on the K7 chromosome V were flanked by two Ty2 elements (K7_YERCTy2-3 and K7_YERWTy2-4) that were inverted in relation to each other and were absent in the corresponding region of S288C. Therefore, these Ty2 elements have been proposed to mediate this reciprocal inversion (Supplementary Fig. S3).15 Since Ty insertions differ by strain or lineage, this inversion would be unique to K7 or related lineages (Supplementary Fig. S3). The second identified inversion was a ~30-kb region on the left arm of chromosome XIV. This inversion was also observed in other strains.15,17 Inverted homologous regions located close to the breaking points on chromosome XIV (YNL018C–YNL019C and YNL033W–YNL034W) may have mediated this reciprocal inversion.3.3. Uneven distribution of heterozygosityThe sequence obtained for the K7 genome represents the consensus haploid sequence derived from the two homologous chromosomes, although K7 is a diploid. Accordingly, we surveyed the positions of heterozygosity by carefully examining the sequence reads. A total of 1347 heterozygous sites between the homologous chromosomes were detected, and their positions were subsequently mapped (Fig. 2). Interestingly, the windows containing multiple heterozygous sites were unevenly distributed as clusters in several chromosomal regions. Genome-wide distribution of heterozygosity between homologous chromosomes of K7. Heterozygous sites were identified by manually checking sequence reads assembled within the supercontigs. The frequency of the extracted heterozygosity in homologous K7 chromosomes was plotted by each 10 kb window of the chromosomal coordinates. x-axis, chromosomal corrdinates; y-axis, heterozygosity counts; arrow heads, position of centromeres.Genome-wide distribution of heterozygosity between homologous chromosomes of K7. Heterozygous sites were identified by manually checking sequence reads assembled within the supercontigs. The frequency of the extracted heterozygosity in homologous K7 chromosomes was plotted by each 10 kb window of the chromosomal coordinates. x-axis, chromosomal corrdinates; y-axis, heterozygosity counts; arrow heads, position of centromeres.Simple evolutionary accumulation of point mutations is insufficient to explain such uneven distribution of heterozygosity.41 It is more likely that a heterozygous diploid was generated by the out-crossing of two different haploid strains and subsequent loss of heterozygosity (LOH), resulting in the observed pattern. Alternatively, a complex history of out- and/or back-crossings of the ancestral strain in natural environments could have also caused this pattern. However, repeated backcrossing is unlikely to have occurred in nature since the sporulation efficiency of sake yeast, including K7, is markedly low. Thus, we speculate that sequential LOH events have resulted in the uneven distribution of heterozygosity in K7. Conversely, it is reasonable to presume that isolated heterozygosities were introduced by point mutations independent of LOH events. Genome-wide LOH was also proposed for the diploid strain YJM128.41 However, LOH in K7 was far more extensive than that found in YJM128, resulting in 82.7% of the entire genome being almost homologous. As LOH is mainly caused by mitotic recombination, the probability of LOH events is dependent on the number of clonal generations during asexual proliferation. Therefore, it is likely that K7 passed through more mitotic generations than YJM128 after the out-crossing event. A sporulation defect of K7 may have contributed to a long-term clonal proliferation that allowed extensive LOH events without meiosis. LOH events also result in the selection of one haplotype between two homologous chromosomes whose haplotypes differ from each other. Consequently, LOH can be a major driving force in the diversification and microevolution of diploid strains, such as K7, which lost a meiotic life cycle, as observed in Candida albicans.423.4. Gene predictionsFollowing the sequencing and assembly of the K7 genome, we predicted and annotated 5815 ORFs on 16 nuclear chromosomes and mitochondrial DNA (Supplementary Table S4). We observed many incomplete ORFs interrupted by a sequence gap between contigs: 39 ORFs had a truncated terminal at one end and 124 ORFs (62 pairs) had internal gaps. When compared with the S288C genome, frame shifts caused by small indels and single-nucleotide changes at the start or the stop codons resulted in many ORF polymorphisms, including terminal disagreement, such as extension or truncation (132 genes), segmentation of a single S288C ORF into multiple K7 ORFs (89 genes corresponding to 43 orthologs in S288C) and the fusion of ORFs (13 genes corresponding to 26 orthologs in S288C; Supplementary Table S4). The influence of these polymorphisms on each respective gene function is unclear and remains to be elucidated, although for several cases, such as the K7 ortholog of MSN4, polymorphism appears to influence the characteristic features of K7.43The average BLAST similarity between K7 ORFs and the most similar S288C ORFs was greater than 95% (95.7 and 95.8% at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively). More than 90% of the K7 ORFs displayed a similarity exceeding 97%, with the corresponding S288C ortholog at the amino acid level (Fig. 3). Genes for tRNAs and other non-coding RNA were also annotated (Supplementary Table S3), which revealed that they corresponded to an almost complete set of S288C RNA genes. However, K7 lost three tRNA genes and one copy of two RUF5 ncRNA genes (data not shown). Their absence would not be expected to have an effect on the cellular functions of K7 because tRNA genes corresponding to a specific codon are highly redundant and one copy of RUF5 was still present in the K7 genome. Identities of K7 ORFs with the top-hit S288C ORF. Each K7 ORF was compared with the corresponding orthologous S288C ORF using BLASTN (nucleotide level) and BLASTP (amino acid level). The ORF proportion based on the observed identities was then plotted.Identities of K7 ORFs with the top-hit S288C ORF. Each K7 ORF was compared with the corresponding orthologous S288C ORF using BLASTN (nucleotide level) and BLASTP (amino acid level). The ORF proportion based on the observed identities was then plotted.3.5. Differentially present genes between K7 and S288CThe comparison of ORFs between K7 and S288C genomes disclosed 97 differentially present genes: 48 ORFs unique to K7 and 49 ORFs unique to S288C (Supplementary Tables S5 and S6). In this analysis, we excluded differences in subtelomeric multicopy gene families such as PAU, COS, DAN, SNO and MAL. Many of the unique genes were located at subtelomeric plastic regions of K7 and S288C, indicating that they may have been acquired or lost by chromosomal rearrangement events. Most differentially present genes located in internal chromosomal regions resulted from small mutations such as frame shifts or gene duplication events in a single strain.The genes predicted as present in K7 that are absent in S288C are listed in Supplementary Table S5. Several K7 genes already demonstrated involvement in the characteristic features of sake yeast, including K7_AWA1 (K07_06182) and a paralogous set of K7_BIO6 genes (K7_BIO6-1/BIO6-2a/BIO6-2b/BIO6-3/BIO6-4a/BIO6-4b: K07_11198/11203/11204/03384/11206/11207), which are unique to sake yeast strains.10,11BIO1, which is absent in S288C, is also required for biotin biosynthesis in yeast.44 As expected from the biotin prototrophy displayed by K7, BIO1 orthologs were also found in K7 (K7_BIO1-1/BIO1-2/BIO1-3: K07_00624/03376/03381).11,45Three paralogous genes that are not found in S288C, K07_00009/11194/04100 (named K7_EHL1/EHL2/EHL3 in this study), were predicted to encode proteins similar to bacterial epoxide hydrolase. Numerous bacterial orthologs to K7_EHL1/EHL2/EHL3 have been identified in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank non-redundant database, whereas eukaryotic orthologs have only been found in S. paradoxus to date (Supplementary Fig. S4). Thus, these epoxide hydrolase genes may have been horizontally transferred from bacteria to a common ancestor of these yeasts. K7_EHL1/EHL2/EHL3 should be involved in the detoxification of harmful epoxide compounds. However, the actual substrates are unknown, and to date, no epoxide compounds have been identified from sake or fermenting sake mash.K7_02354, which was located in a subtelomeric region, is orthologous to YJM-GNAT of YJM789, which encodes a gene similar to bacterial GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase, suggesting that a common ancestor of K7 and YJM789 acquired their ancestral gene by horizontal transfer.15 Sequences of K7_02354 and YJM-GNAT were almost identical (over 99%) at both the nucleotide and the amino acid levels (Supplementary Fig. S5).K7_KHR1 (K07_03550), which encodes a previously identified heat-resistant killer toxin,45 was located in an internal region of chromosome IX and wedged between two solo LTRs. Although a similar structure was observed in the EC1118 genome,17 S288C does not possess KHR1, and only a solo LTR (YILCdelta3) is located in the corresponding locus. This suggests that the loss of KHR1 in S288C was caused by LTR-mediated recombination, as predicted in a previous study.17 A large proportion of genes unique to K7 (Supplementary Table S5) have not been characterized, and their involvement and function in the characteristic features of sake yeast remain to be explored.Forty-nine genes predicted as present in S288C but absent in K7 are listed in Supplementary Table S6. We confirmed that these genes are not present in K7 non-supercontigs. Notably, two subtelomeric paralogous blocks in the S288C genome, containing HXT15–SOR2–MPH2 on chromosome IV and HXT16–SOR1–MPH3 on chromosome X, were not identified in the K7 genome. The paralogous pairs of HXT15 and HXT16, SOR1 and SOR2 and MPH2 and MPH3 encode nearly identical hexose transporters, sorbitol dehydrogenases and maltose transporters, respectively.46–48 It is likely that non-reciprocal chromosomal recombinations in subtelomeric regions caused duplication of these sequences in S288C, but resulted in their loss in the K7 lineage. Another subtelomeric gene, AIF1, which is located on S288C chromosome XIV and encodes a mitochondrial cell death factor,49 was also lost in K7. CWP1, encoding a cell-wall protein linked to glucan chains,50 was disrupted by a frame-shift mutation in K7. Although the effects of the loss of this protein are unclear, it is possible that the cell-wall properties of K7 are affected.PPT1, which encodes a protein phosphatase,51 is located at an internal region of chromosome VII in S288C, whereas the corresponding 2.6-kb region was lost and replaced with a Ty element (K7_YGRCTy2-2) in the K7 genome (Fig. 4A). The effect of the loss of PPT1 on cellular function or the sake brewing character of K7 is unclear. A tRNA gene tR(UCU)G3 on the left side of PPT1 was also absent in K7. However, the tI(AAU)G gene located on the right side of PPT1 in S288C was present in K7. Sequences located several hundred bases upstream of a tRNA gene can serve as potential target sites for Ty integration. Consequently, multiple Ty insertion and subsequent excision events may have resulted in the two solo LTRs on both sides of PPT1 in a K7 ancestral genome. Recombination, including insertion or gene conversion, between a Ty cDNA and yeast chromosome with LTRs, was reported in laboratory experiments.52 Therefore, we speculate that gene conversion between a double-stranded Ty cDNA and two solo LTRs pre-existing on the chromosome VII may have occurred in the K7 ancestor, resulting in the replacement of PPT1 with Ty2 (Fig. 4, Supplementary Fig. S6). Alternatively, double reciprocal crossing-over may have resulted in the observed structure; however, this is unlikely, as PPT1 was not found in either the supercontigs or the non-supercontig contigs of K7. A similar structure was also observed in the K7 right arm of chromosome I (Fig. 4B), involving the replacement of two tRNA genes tL(CAA)A and tS(AGA)A with Ty2, which we speculate may have involved a similar gene conversion mechanism. In previous studies, Ty cDNA-mediated gene conversions were only observed in genetically modified strains and were thought to be an artificially induced phenomena.52 The structures identified in the K7 genome would represent the first example of the spontaneous direct Ty-mediated gene conversion in a wild-type strain. Loss of genomic regions by Ty2 replacement in the K7 genome. Each region within the dotted-line box in the S288C genome was replaced by a Ty element (Ty2) in the K7 genome. (A) A 2628-bp region containing the tRNA gene tR(UCU)G3 and PPT1/YGR123C in S288C chromosome VII was replaced by K7_YGRCTy2-2 in K7 chromosome VII. (B) A 2464-bp region containing two tRNA genes, tL(CAA)A and tS(AGA)A, in S288C chromosome I was replaced by K7_YARWTy2-1 in K7 chromosome I.Loss of genomic regions by Ty2 replacement in the K7 genome. Each region within the dotted-line box in the S288C genome was replaced by a Ty element (Ty2) in the K7 genome. (A) A 2628-bp region containing the tRNA gene tR(UCU)G3 and PPT1/YGR123C in S288C chromosome VII was replaced by K7_YGRCTy2-2 in K7 chromosome VII. (B) A 2464-bp region containing two tRNA genes, tL(CAA)A and tS(AGA)A, in S288C chromosome I was replaced by K7_YARWTy2-1 in K7 chromosome I.Two tandemly-duplicated acid phosphatase genes, PHO3 and PHO5, are located on chromosome II of the S288C genome.53 However, K7 possessed only PHO5 (K07_00381), consistent with the observation that K7 shows repressive, but not constitutive, acid phosphatase activity.54 These tandemly arranged acid phosphatase genes are also present in YJM789, EC1118 and several other Saccharomyces species.15,17,55 The prevalence of these genes suggests that PHO3 was looped out of the K7 genome by homologous recombination. In the K7 genome, no copies of ASP3 and its neighboring ORFs, which encode cell-wall l-asparaginase II and putative proteins of unknown function, were found, even though S288C chromosome XII contains at least four copies of ASP3 adjacent to rDNA repeats.56 These sequences are also absent in numerous other S. cerevisiae strains.15–17,39 Although tandemly triplicated ENA1/ENA2/ENA5, encoding P-type ATPases are located on chromosome IV in S288C,57 only one copy was identified in K7 (K7_ENA1/K7_01190), as observed in many other strains.15–17,39 The triplication is a relatively specific feature of S288C and its related strains. The K7 genome also contained one copy of CUP1 (K7_CUP1/K07_03116), encoding a metallothionein, whereas S288C contains two copies in tandem,58 consistent with the lower copper resistance of K7 than that of X2180, an isogenic diploid of S288C (data not shown).3.6. Hexose transporter and GAL genesTransport of sugars across the membrane is one of the key steps in ethanol fermentation. The S288C genome contains 20 genes that encode hexose transporter family proteins (HXT1–HXT17 and GAL2) and glucose sensors (SNF3 and RGT2) as shown in Fig. 5. The products of these genes show different glucose affinities and are differentially expressed in order to coordinately control glucose uptake in environments with a broad range of glucose concentrations.59 Many of these genes, including two glucose sensors, were highly conserved among S288C and K7. In particular, both the low-affinity glucose transporter genes HXT1/HXT3 were conserved, implying that they may be responsible for glucose uptake during the sake brewing process, as reported in wine yeast.60HXT5/HXT6/HXT7 were located at contig ends, and the DNA sequences of these regions in K7 were not completely analyzed. In S288C, HXT6 and HXT7 encode nearly identical proteins and are arranged in tandem; however, they may have been combined into a chimeric gene (HXT6/7) in K7, as observed in other strains.59Phylogenetic tree of hexose transporter family proteins identified in S288C. The amino acid sequences of S288C HXT gene products were clustered by CLUSTALW 1.83, and the dendrogram was plotted using the TreeView program. Symbols at the end of the branches indicate the structural class of K7 orthologous gene products, as shown in the box under the dendrogram. Two groups of Hxts, whose functional structures were disrupted in K7, are framed with rectangles. Underlines indicate genes whose expression is repressed under high-glucose conditions. The letter (a) denotes each of the two K7 orthologs is indicated as a half round.Phylogenetic tree of hexose transporter family proteins identified in S288C.

The letter (a) denotes each of the two K7 orthologs is indicated as a half round.We revealed that two distinct classes of S288C HXT genes displayed almost altered gene structures in K7. The first contains HXT9/HXT11 and HXT12, which is annotated as a possible pseudogene due to a frame-shift mutation in SGD. In the K7 genome, although one of the duplicated HXT9 orthologs was conserved (K7_HXT9-2/K07_02205: 98% identical to HXT9 at the amino acid level), all other HXT9/HXT11 orthologs were divide into two ORFs due to frame shifts (K7_HXT9-1a/HXT9-1b/HXT11a/HXT11b: K07_03662/03663/06179/06180). The disrupted structure of HXT12 was also conserved in K7 (K7_HXT12a/HXT12b: K07_03394/03395) as well as in S288C (Supplementary Table S4). Four genes HXT13/HXT15/HXT16/HXT17 are classified into the second HXT class. In the K7 genome, the HXT13/HXT17 orthologs (K7_HXT13a/HXT13b/HXT17a/HXT17b: K07_01805/1807/06162/ 06164) contained frame-shift mutations that may have resulted in the loss of function (Supplementary Table S4), while the sequences corresponding to HXT15/HXT16 were absent in the K7 genome (Supplementary Table S6). Thus, in K7, the functions of gene products in this class appeared to be completely lost, although their molecular functions were unclear.In the K7 genome, we also identified frame-shift mutations in the GAL3 and GAL4 genes that divided each gene into two ORFs (K07_01156 and K07_01157 for GAL3 and K07_06847 and K07_06846 for GAL4). Thus, both Gal3p and Gal4p in K7 are shorter at their C termini than their orthologs in S288C, suggesting that their molecular functions may be impaired. Since Gal3p and Gal4p function as an inducer and activator, respectively, which constitute the transcriptional induction system of galactose assimilating genes,61 the loss of Gal3p and Gal4p functions may lead to defective GAL gene induction in response to galactose. Consistent with this speculation, the assimilation and fermentation of galactose are remarkably weakened in several sake yeast strains, including K7.62Our analyses suggest that K7 possesses different sugar uptake and assimilation properties from those of S288C. It is likely that sake yeast cells could tolerate a functional loss from these genes without a negative selective force due to the growth of these strains in the glucose-rich environment specific to sake mash.3.7. Structure of the HO geneAs K7 is a heterothallic diploid, HO involved in mating-type switching was predicted as non-functional in K7.63 Indeed, a homozygous mutation of A1424T (H475L), which was reported to cause a loss of function in S288C,64 was observed in the K7 ho allele. Moreover, a 36-amino acid deletion at 524–559 was also present in K7, as was reported in the heterothallic bioethanol strain JAY291.18 Collectively, these differences are likely to be responsible for the observed K7 heterothallism.3.8. Comparison of Ty elements and LTRsThe chromosomal insertion of a Ty element can result not only in the loss or alteration of gene function, but may also modify gene expression levels. The annotated Ty elements and solo LTRs from K7 are summarized in Supplementary Tables S7 and S8. Nearly all Ty and solo LTR insertions followed the target-site-selection rule, displaying preferential insertion within a 1-kb upstream region of RNA polymerase III-target genes (Supplementary Table S8). We compared Ty insertion events, which included intact Ty elements and solo LTRs, between K7 and S288C. If flanking regions of two Ty elements, a Ty element and a solo LTR or two solo LTRs, were identical between the two strains, we estimated that these insertion sequences should be derived from the same Ty element insertion event in the common ancestral strain. A total of 198 Ty insertion events were estimated to be identical between K7 and S288C, while 121 and 137 insertion events were unique to K7 and S288C, respectively (Supplementary Tables S7B and S8). Interestingly, among the same 198 insertion events, only one pair maintained intact Ty structures in both strains: K7_YCLWTy5-1 and YCLW Ty5-1. In addition, two pairs kept intact Ty structures in one of the strains: YARCTy1-1 in S288C and K7_YERWTy3-1 in K7. All other insertion events were observed as solo LTRs, representing trace sequences of Ty elements (Supplementary Table S8). This observation supports the idea that same insertion events may occur in the much more distant past than the unique insertion events. In our analyses, we were unable to locate K7 genes that were interrupted by a Ty insertion.4. ConclusionsWe revealed the sequence and structure of the K7 genome that represents the first such study of a sake yeast lineage within S. cerevisiae and provides the basis for future studies on the brewing characteristics, genealogy and evolution of sake yeast. The phenotypic effects of the identified structural polymorphisms between K7 and S288C genomes are largely unknown and remain to be explored. In addition, the uneven heterozygosity distribution found in the K7 genome is suggestive of the microevolution of K7 and related sake yeast strains. Future genetic studies encompassing a wide range of Saccharomyces strains are necessary to resolve the genetic basis for the characteristics and evolution of sake yeast strains in greater detail.The sequences and annotations reported in this paper have been deposited at DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank under the accession no.

The explosive growth number of available genomic sequences presents unprecedented opportunities for probing the secret of life and extract biological information on genetics, which is highly dependent on the annotation quality of each genome. In most cases, many people think that gene finding in prokaryotic genomes is relatively easy due to lack of introns, and they usually deem the genes deposited in public databases such as GenBank or EMBL are correctly annotated. However, more and more researches indicate that the issue of gene finding in microbial genomes is far from thoroughly resolved; the annotation quality of microbial genomes has been questioned continuously in the past several years.1–29 Many studies implied that some annotated protein-coding genes in most completely sequenced microbial genomes do not encode any proteins actually, but random open reading frames (ORFs) occurring by chance.1–9,11–26 In current public databases, the careful annotators have marked those questionable ORFs as hypothetical, then which of them encode protein, and which do not? As many users may take it for granted that all the annotated genes are true protein coding, this can easily lead to wrong conclusions. Then the researchers need to be aware of the existing errors in the annotation of even well-studied genomes and consider additional quality control for their results. Although many groups have performed re-annotation on different microbial genomes, some filtering strategies for the over-annotated ORFs seemed to be questionable due to the resultant increase in false negative, and then there is still much room for improvement. Moreover, it is regretful that there is no webserver or software reported for addressing the problem of over-annotated genes in public databases. Then the update speed of current databases based on the one-by-one re-annotating strategy is far from practical applications and the increasing rate of novel sequenced genomes, which will decrease greatly the value of public databases. Therefore, the problem is still open for protein-coding genes identification in microbial genomes.Recent researches show that development of techniques by combination of multiple programs may produce a higher performance in prediction problems.30–32 In this paper, we put forward a meta-approach for identifying the falsely annotated protein-coding genes in microbial genomes. The algorithm is evaluated by 61 microbial genomes and an average accuracy of 99.94% is obtained. The extremely high accuracy shows that the integrated method can grasp universal information of protein-coding genes. Subsequent analysis indicates that the predicting results are much reliable. In order to facilitate the potential users, we exploited an interface-friendly webserver aiming to NCBI's RefSeq resources. This platform only needs to input the accession number of the queried microbial genome, and then it is much convenient and easy to operate.2. Methods2.1. Numerical descriptorsThe walking model method is such a kind of graphical representation that can transform biological sequences into visual patterns based on different encoding strategies. Since the first walking model was proposed by Hamori and Ruskin,33 many graphical approaches have been reported for DNA sequences, which can provide intuitive pictures or useful insights for helping analysing complicated relations in biological systems.34 The methodology proposed in this work is based on the TN curve and Z curve, from which we derive 75 numerical parameters to exhibit the intrinsic properties of protein-coding genes.The TN curve is a recently proposed walking model by us, with which one can inspect information of trinucleotides both qualitatively and quantitatively.35 Consideration of trinucleotides instead of individual and dual nucleotides has superior advantages for protein-coding genes. In this paper, we derive 54 parameters based on the encoding strategy of the TN curve to exhibit the specific structures of protein genes numerically, which are briefly introduced below.(i) According to the encoding strategy of the TN curve, each kind of trinucleotide can be represented by a 2D Cartesian coordinates (x, y). Here, we determine the signs of x and y by the base at the first position ({+, +}<U+2192>A, {-, +}<U+2192>G, {-, -}<U+2192>C, {+, -}<U+2192>T) and decide the absolute values of x and y by the bases at the second and third positions (1<U+2192>A, 2<U+2192>G, 3<U+2192>C, 4<U+2192>T), respectively. Taking GCG as an example, the base ‘G’ at the first position denotes that the signs of x and y are negative and positive, respectively; the base ‘C’ at the second position and the base ‘G’ at the third position imply that the absolute values of x and y are 3 and 2, respectively. Therefore, GCG is represented by (-3, 2). In this way, other kinds of trinucleotides can also be denoted numerically. According to the definition, x> 0 or x< 0 mean that the base at the first position is an element of (A, T) or (G, C), which corresponds to week-H bond (A, T)/strong-H bond (G, C) groups, y> 0 or y< 0 mean that the first base is (A, G) or (C, T), which corresponds to purine (A, G)/pyrimidine (C, T) groups. Letting z= x× y, it is noted that when z> 0, x and y are positive or negative simultaneously, the second base must be A or C, which corresponds to the amino group, when z< 0, the sign of x is opposite to y, the first base must be G or T, which corresponds to the keto group. Thus, the 64 kinds of trinucleotides can be classified into two groups in three ways based on x, y and z, respectively. On the other hand, x links the first and second bases of a trinucleotide, and this can be used as an approximate descriptor of dual nucleotide. Similar results can be obtained for y which links the first and third bases of a nucleotide triplet. Then, we can obtain more information from these parameters.35To explain the implications of the derived 54 numerical descriptors, we present three short sequences that have the same trinucleotide compositions but different trinucleotide order as examples in Table 1. In our previous work, we have demonstrated that one can obtain intuitive information of trinucleotides both compositions and distributions based on xi, yi, zi and their derivants x', y', z', respectively.35 As can be seen from Table 1, u1, u2 and u3 have equal values, while the values of u4, u5 and u6 differ greatly. This indicates that u1, u2 and u3 reflect the information of trinucleotide compositions and u4, u5 and u6 are sensitive to the trinucleotides orders along the corresponding sequences. For other numerical descriptors, the same results can also be observed. Then, we can obtain sufficient information from the two groups numerical descriptors u1, u2, u3, u7, u8, u9, … and u4, u5, u6, u10, u11, u12, … . Recently, we have re-annotated the genome of Amsacta moorei entomopoxvirus using an 18D vector according to encoding strategy III.36 In the present work, the number of numerical descriptors is extended to 54. As we discussed above, based on each kind of encoding strategy, the 64 kinds of trinucleotides can be divided into two groups in three ways. That is, we can provide sufficient information with the 54D vector based on the three encoding strategies, which can reveal more universal properties for protein-coding genes than the 18D vector. Numerical descriptors for two short sequence (a) ATG CAT TTA, (b) CAT ATG TTA and (c) ATG TTA CATNumerical descriptors for two short sequence (a) ATG CAT TTA, (b) CAT ATG TTA and (c) ATG TTA CATThe Z curve is another graphical representation proposed for displaying information of individual nucleotides,37,38 which has been applied to some protein-coding genes re-annotation works.15,19,21 In this work, the 21 statistical numerical descriptors derived from the Z curve method are adopted to perfect the presented algorithm, which is introduced briefly below, for details refer to the work by Gao and Zhang.39Supposing a1, c1, g1, t1; a2, c2, g2, t2; a3, c3, g3, t3 denote the occurring frequencies of A, C, G and T at different codon positions 1, 4, 7, …; 2, 5, 8, …; 3, 6, 9, … , respectively, then, ai, ci, gi, ti (i = 1, 2, 3) can be mapped onto a point Pi in a 3D space, the coordinates of which are calculated by Z-transform2.2. The Fisher discriminant algorithmThe Fisher discriminant algorithm is a simple method that has been extensively used in gene prediction. For detail introductions, refer to the work by Zhang and Wang.13 To accomplish the presented algorithm, two sets of samples are required to train the discriminant coefficients, i.e. positive samples corresponding to true protein-coding genes and negative samples corresponding to non-coding ORFs. For each queried genome, its annotated known functional genes are used as the positive training set and the negative training set is composed of the shuffled complementary sequences of corresponding known functional genes, which has been initially introduced by Guo et al.32 It was found that the 75 parameters are sensitive to the specific gene structures. Then we shuffle the primary sequences only 50 times, hence the runtime can be shorten remarkably. The Fisher linear equation for discriminating the positive and negative samples in the 75D space V represents a super-plane, described by a vector C that has 75 components. To avoid loss of generality, the vector C was determined according to the criterion |C|2= 1. Besides, an appropriate threshold C0 is obtained by strictly letting the false-negative rate and the false-positive rate to be identical. Once the vector C and the threshold C0 are determined, each sequence is assigned a T_score= CV- C0. Then the decision of coding/non-coding for each genes in the test set is simply performed by the criterion of T_score > 0 or T_score < 0, where C= (C1, C2, … , C75) and V= (u1, u2 … , u75).2.3. Evaluation index3. Results and discussions3.1. Performance of the presented algorithmAccording to the annotation files, the protein-coding genes in public databases can be classified into two groups, i.e. the genes with known function and those marked with different prefixes, such as ‘putative’, ‘probable’, ‘possible’, ‘possibly’, ‘similar’, ‘alternate’, ‘uncharacterized’, ‘unknown’, ‘predicted’, ‘conserved hypothetical’ and ‘hypothetical’ genes. In this study, we divide all the annotated protein-coding genes into four classes. The first class includes the known functional genes, while those marked ‘conserved hypothetical’ and ‘hypothetical’ genes are assigned to the third and fourth classes, respectively, the rest marked ‘putative’, ‘probable’, ‘possible’, ‘possibly’, ‘similar’, ‘alternate’, ‘uncharacterized’, ‘unknown’, and ‘predicted’ belong to the second class. It is noted that the genes in the first class are genuine protein-coding with validated functions, while some ORFs in other classes may be random sequences that are falsely predicted as protein-coding genes. In the presented re-annotating algorithm, the known functional genes in the first class and their corresponding shuffled sequences are used to train the Fisher coefficients and evaluate the predicting performance, this can also regarded as self-test. In addition, the 10-fold cross-validation is also employed to evaluate our algorithm. In the 10-fold cross-validation, the positive and negative samples composed of the known functional genes and their shuffled sequences are randomly divided into three groups averagely, one is used as the training set and the others are used as the testing set. Here, 61 bacterial and archaeal genomes (listed in Supplementary Table S1) are taken as examples to accomplish the algorithm. For convenience, the abbreviation names are used, for example, Candidatus Phytoplasma mali is abbreviated as C. Phytoplasma. The genome size of the 61 species ranges from 412 348 to 7 036 071 bp, and the G + C content ranges from 21 to 72%. In Supplementary Table S2, we present the sensitivity (sn), specificity (sp), accuracy (Ac) and the MCC of self-test and the 10-fold cross-validation. Since the proposed algorithm is a supervised learning strategy, which may be impacted by the shuffling negative samples, then the program is performed five times over each genome, and the mean evaluating indices are calculated. Because the threshold C0 is strictly demined by the false-positive rate equal the false-negative rate, then, for self-test, sn is identical to sp, and Ac= sn = sp. In addition, some ORFs with lengths that cannot be divided by three integrally are excluded. For comparison, the results by 54- and 21-vectors are also presented in Supplementary Table S2. As can be seen, the overall average accuracies of self-test over the 61 microbial genomes are 99.62, 99.79 and 99.94% for the 54, 21 and 75D vectors, respectively. As for the 10-fold cross-validation, overall average accuracies of 99.55, 99.75 and 99.88% are obtained by 54, 21 and 75D vectors, respectively. The overall average MCCs over the 61 microbial genomes for the self-test are 0.9925, 0.9958 and 0.9989, for the 10-fold cross-validation, 0.9910, 0.9951 and 0.9977 obtained by 54, 21 and 75D vectors, respectively. Although the integrated algorithm achieves an extremely high performance, the parameters also increased. Then the main question remains open—why can this so-called combined methodology achieve such higher accuracy? Can we obtain more information about the specific protein-coding genes, in other words, can the integrated 75D vector grasp the universal features of protein-coding genes different from non-coding? To give explicit answer, we should perform sufficient analysis in the following sections.3.2. Correlation between the G + C content and the Fisher coefficientsThe ratio of G + C to the total bases appears to be constant in particular microbial genomes, but varies between species, which is found somehow related to phylogeny, as well as the genomic components, such as protein-coding genes, stable RNA genes and spacers including various signals.44 Muto and Osawa's45 researches indicated that the G + C content of each kind of genomic component positively but differentially correlate to the genomic G + C content for a given bacterium. When the genetic code was deciphered in the early 1960s, it was observed to be universal for most organisms, whereas there are no universal gene-finding parameters suitable for any organism, which can be reflected that the 61 sets of Fisher coefficients are dissimilar from each other. The 75 numerical descriptors in our algorithm are proposed to demonstrate the general features of protein-coding genes, and then it is interesting to explore the correlation between the genomic G + C content and the trained Fisher coefficients among different genomes.To accomplish the analysis, the following steps are proposed. (i) Six species with different G + C contents, Buchnera (26%), Streptococcus uberis (36%), Yersinia pestis (47%), Brucella melitensis (57%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (66%) and Clavibacter michiganensis (72%) are selected discretionarily. (ii) Based on the six genomes, six sets of the Fisher coefficients are obtained, each of which is trained by its known functional genes. (iii) Each set of the Fisher coefficients is singled out in turn to identify the known functional genes in other genomes. For convenience, we list the discriminating results in Table 2. Accuracies of mutual validations for the genomes with different G + C content based on the 75D vectorAccuracies of mutual validations for the genomes with different G + C content based on the 75D vectorAs can be seen from Table 2, 88.79% known functional genes of S. uberis genome can be correctly identified using the Fisher coefficients and threshold trained in Buchnera. With the increase in the G + C content, the discriminating accuracy obtained by the Fisher coefficients of Buchnera drops quickly. Observing the results obtained by the Fisher coefficients of C. michiganensis, it was found that 99.18% known functional genes of P. aeruginosa are correctly identified, with the decrease in the G + C content, the accuracy drops to an extremely low level (2.67% for Buchnera). As for the results obtained by S. uberis, it was found that 99.79 and 87.11% known functional genes of Buchnera and Y. pestis can be correctly identified, respectively, but the accuracy for genomes with significantly different G + C content is much lower. The similar phenomenon that high accuracies can be achieved among genomes with similar G + C contents can be observed in other species. To give an exhaustive interpretation, we also perform the similar steps based on the 54 and 21D vectors (Supplementary Tables S3 and S4), respectively. Meaningfully, the similar phenomenon to the above analysis can be found in both tables. In some sense, the genomic G + C content can reflect the phylogenetic relationship among bacteria and archaea,45,46 and it was suggested that the divergence of genomic G + C content of various bacterial species in one genus is <10%.19 Therefore, we infer that genomes with similar G + C content may share similar gene-finding parameters.Among the six researched genomes, Y. pestis has a medium G + C content. Using the Fisher coefficients and threshold of Y. pestis, over 97% known functional genes of the other five genomes can be correctly identified. The similar results can also be observed in Supplementary Tables S3 and S4, which imply that the Fisher coefficients and thresholds trained by genomes with medium G + C content (~50%) are much universal, this is consistent with previous works by Chen et al.19 In Table 2, the results obtained by P. aeruginosa are much conspicuous, for this genome has a high G + C content of 66%. As can be seen, much high accuracies over the other five tested genomes are achieved (=98%) by this genome. By contrast, the results listed in Supplementary Tables S3 and S4 for P. aeruginosa is found to be much different in some cases. In Supplementary Table S3, only 21.36% known functional genes of Buchnera are correctly predicted by the coefficients of P. aeruginosa, while in Supplementary Table S4, the accuracy is 95.69%. Similarly, the accuracy on S. uberis based on the 54D vector is also lower than that of 21D vector. Then, we divide the 75 trained Fisher coefficients into three subcomponents, i.e. W1= [C1–C3, C7–C9, C13–C15, C19–C21, C25–C27, C31–C33, C37–C39, C43–C45, C49–C51], W2= [C4–C6, C10–C12, C16–C18, C22–C24, C28–C30, C34–C36, C40–C42, C46–C48, C52–C54], W3= [C55–C75]. According to the definitions, W1 and W2 correspond to information of trinucleotides and their corresponding cumulative effects, and W3 represents the information of base compositions and dinucleotides, respectively. For comparison, the three subcomponents for P. aeruginosa and Buchnera are intuitively plotted in Fig. 1. Observing the distribution of W3, it seems that P. aeruginosa and Buchnera have similar patterns in the regions of 10–21, while in the regions of 1–9, the patterns of the two genomes seem to be much different. W3 represents the Fisher coefficients that corresponding to the 21 statistical parameters, which reflect the statistical properties of base distributions in the three codon positions and phase-specific dinucleotides. The G + C content of P. aeruginosa is much different from that of Buchnera, which can account for the differences in regions 1–9 that correspond to base distributions at the three codon positions. While in regions 10–21, the similar tendency imply that there are some universal properties on the phase-specific dinucleotides in P. aeruginosa genome that accounts for the high accuracy on other genomes as shown in Supplementary Table S4, which needs further experimental validations. W1 and W2 represent the Fisher coefficients corresponding to the 54D vector that derived from the trinucleotide-based walking model, which reflects the distribution and compositions of trinucleotides along the DNA sequences. It was found that codon usages in protein-coding genes are highly dependent on the G + C content, then the remarkable differences in the G + C content between P. aeruginosa and Buchnera cause the low accuracy in Supplementary Table S3. From the bar graphs in Fig. 1, the accordant patterns of W1 and W2 can be observed, for both exhibit much different tendency between the two species. Then, the results of Fig. 1 indicate that the 75 integrative parameters in the presented re-annotating algorithm can demonstrate more underlying information of protein-coding genes. Comparing the Fisher coefficients (C) between P. aeruginosa and Buchnera.Comparing the Fisher coefficients (C) between P. aeruginosa and Buchnera.3.3. Correlation between the genome size and the Fisher coefficientsAlthough it has been validated that the Fisher coefficients is much universal for genomes with medium G + C content, the high accuracy obtained by P. aeruginosa presented in Table 2 seems to be much unexpected, for its G + C content is up to 66%. On the other hand, the genome size of P. aeruginosa is 6 588 339 bp with 6286 annotated protein-coding genes. Then, another issue is questioned that whether the high accuracy is caused by its huge genomic contents. To explore the correlation between the genome size and the trained Fisher coefficients, four additional species with different genome size, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 851 126 bp), Burkholderia cenocepacia (875 977 bp), Deinococcus radiodurans c2 (412 348 bp) and D. radiodurans c1 (2 648 638 bp) are selected, which have similar G + C content (66%) with P. aeruginosa (Supplementary Table S1). Whereupon we use the Fisher coefficients and threshold trained by P. aeruginosa, S. maltophilia, B. cenocepacia, D. radiodurans c2 and D. radiodurans c1 to identify the protein-coding genes in the genomes with different G + C content, where the other five species listed in Table 2 are employed, respectively. The predicting results are presented in Table 3. Among the four selected species, S. maltophilia has the biggest genome size, but it seems that its Fisher coefficients are not as universal as that of P. aeruginosa. Based on the coefficients and threshold trained by S. maltophilia, 98.99% known functional genes in C. michiganensis are correctly predicted, while the accuracy drops to 0.21% with the decrease in the G + C content. Deinococcus radiodurans c2 is the smaller chromosome of D. radiodurans R1, which has only 368 protein-coding genes, while its performance is comparable with that of P. aeruginosa. As for the other two species, the average accuracy of B. cenocepacia is higher than that of D. radiodurans c1, although the latter has a much bigger genome size. Predicting results based on genomes with different sizesPredicting results based on genomes with different sizesDeinococcus radiodurans c2 and D. radiodurans c1 are the smaller and larger chromosomes of D. radiodurans R1, respectively. In previous works, some authors deemed the bases distribution patterns in different chromosomes for one bacterium to be similar, then they do not have independent origins.15 While some other works conjectured that the smaller chromosome was originally a megaplasmid captured by an ancestral species.47 Both the two chromosomes share similar G + C content. In the larger chromosome, the G + C contents of the annotated protein-coding genes range from 34.1 to 77.1%, with the average of 67.44%, the values of GC3 range from 28.2 to 96.3%, with the average of 83.54%. In the smaller chromosome, the G + C contents of the annotated protein-coding genes range from 37 to 76.1%, with the average of 67.14%, the values of GC3 range from 28.4 to 93.1%, with the average of 82.34%. Nevertheless, from Table 3, we note that there are much differences between the results obtained by D. radiodurans c2 and D. radiodurans c1, which indicates that their Fisher coefficients display discrepant properties. We speculate that the differences can be accounted by their intrinsic genes features. For protein-coding genes, the relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) is an effective index used to examine synonymous codon usage without the confounding influence of amino acid composition of different gene samples.48 Correspondence analysis (COA) can be used to investigate the major trend in codon usage variation among protein-coding genes. After performing COA on the RSCU values of the annotated protein-coding genes, it was found that axes 1 and 2 of COA account for 24.59 and 5.31% for D. radiodurans c2, and those for D. radiodurans c1 account for 15.6 and 5.69%, respectively. The prominent weight of the first principle suggests strong codon bias trend in both chromosomes. To assess the factors that affect the codon usage bias, we plotted axis 1 against their codon adaptation index (CAI) values in Fig. 2. CAI is used to measure the gene expression level,43 highly expressed genes are presumed to have high CAI values. In Fig. 2, the scatter plot for D. radiodurans c1 indicates a significant positive correlation with the position of the genes on axis 1 and their corresponding CAI values (r = 0.5275, P < 0.01). Further analysis suggests that the coordinates of axis 1 also show a significant positive correlation with the GC3 (r = 0.9090, P < 0.01). On the contrary, from the scatter plot of D. radiodurans c2, a significant negative correlation between axis 1 and their CAI values (r = -0.5712, P < 0.01) can be observed. Further analysis shows that axis 1 is also significantly negatively correlate with the GC3 (r = -0.9267, P < 0.01). Furthermore, the CAI value shows positive correlation with GC3 in both D. radiodurans c1 (r = 0.3437, P < 0.01) and D. radiodurans c2 (r = 0.4726, P < 0.01). These results show that gene expression level and base compositions play an important role to shape the codon usage patterns in both chromosomes; the highly expressed genes prefer higher GC content at their synonymous third codon position. However, the opposite trends exhibit different evolutionary pressures on them, which seem to support the speculation that the smaller chromosome was originally a megaplasmid. Therefore, our analysis shows that there is no causality between the genome size and the Fisher coefficients, but the highly universal Fisher coefficients in some species imply that there may be general properties, which is worthy of further researching in the future. On the other hand, the present analysis implies that the integrated 75D vector is sensitive to the specific gene structures, which may provide novel clues for gene-finding algorithms. Scatter plot of axis 1 against CAI.Scatter plot of axis 1 against CAI.3.4. Why the filtered ORFs do not encode proteinsUsing the presented re-annotating algorithm, we re-identified the protein-coding genes in the 61 genomes. For objectivity, the algorithm is performed five times on each genome, those ORFs with T_score <0 occurring equal or more than three times are recognized as non-coding. Consequently, an average of 99.94% over the 61 microbial genomes is achieved (Supplementary Table S2). From the predicting results listed in Supplementary Table S5, we can find that different numbers of ORFs are predicted as non-coding in most species. Taking the genomes of Pyrococcus horikoshii and Caulobacter crescentus as examples, 72 and 76 hypothetical genes are filtered as non-coding, respectively (Supplementary Table S6).Previous analysis of protein-coding genes showed that there are severe restrictions on bases distributions at different codon positions because they are associated with different biological functions. It was found that the restrictions are universal that the first codon position prefers purine bases.49 After calculating the purine–pyrimidine disparities at the first codon position, an average of -0.026 (-2.6%) is obtained for the 71 filtered hypothetical ORFs in P. horikoshii genome, while an average value of 0.3785 (37.85%) is obtained for the protein-coding genes. In C. crescentus genome, an average of 0.0425 (4.25%) for the 76 filtered hypothetical ORFs is obtained, while for those protein-coding genes, an average of 0.2131 (21.31%) is obtained. These results show that purine bases are dominant at the first codon position for the protein-coding genes, while the purine bases are equivalent to the pyrimidine bases for the recognized non-coding ORFs, which indicate that they are likely random sequences that are falsely predicted as protein-coding genes. The differences between coding and non-coding ORFs can also be displayed by the principal component analysis (PCA). PCA defines the correlation among the variables of given data. We have demonstrated that the integrative 75D vector carries sufficient information to exhibit the specific properties of protein-coding genes. After performing PCA, we project the 75 parameters of each ORF into a 2D coordinates by the first two principal components, which is shown in Fig. 3. It can be seen that the filtered non-coding ORFs are clustered far from the core of coding sequences. The different regions reflect that there are intrinsic differences between the recognized ORFs and coding sequences. Then, the results based on PCA also indicate that the filtered ORFs are unlikely to encode proteins. Projecting the annotated ORFs into 2D coordinates by PCA.Projecting the annotated ORFs into 2D coordinates by PCA.In the RefSeq database,50 clusters of orthologous groups (COG)51 are used to shape the potential functions of proteins produced by the annotated ORFs. Each COG is a group of three or more proteins that have evolved from a common ancestor. Then, these ORFs assigned with a COG are highly likely to be true protein-coding genes. According to the annotation file of P. horikoshii, 98.69% (678 out of 687) known functional genes and 94.87% (37 out of 39) putative genes are marked COG, while among the 1229 hypothetical genes, only 740 (56.97%) are marked COG. In the annotation file of C. crescentus, the percentages of the marked COG of known functional genes, putative genes and hypothetical genes are 96.25% (2107 out of 2189), 100% (15 out of 15) and 51.21% (785 out of 1533), respectively. Among the recognized 71 + 76 = 147 non-coding ORFs in genomes of P. horikoshii and C. crescentus, none has been assigned with COG tags. According to the results in Supplementary Table S5, up to 925 hypothetical ORFs are recognized as non-coding, among which only 50 (5.41%) are marked with COG. Some previous works show that a significant fraction of annotated short ORFs may be not true genes, which is one of the major causes that account for the over-annotation of microbial genomes.3,52 In P. horikoshii genome, the average length of the 71 annotated non-coding sequences is 391 bp, which is much shorter than that of these recognized protein-coding genes (858 bp). The similar result is also obtained in the genome of C. crescentus, in which the average length of the 76 annotated non-coding ORFs is 466 bp, while that of these protein-coding genes is 981 bp. In Table 4, we present the statistical results of the length distributions among all the 925 recognized non-coding ORFs. Then, from the above analysis, sufficient evidences suggest that most of these filtered ORFs are random sequences that are falsely predicted as protein-coding genes. Distribution of sequence length among the 925 recognized non-coding ORFsDistribution of sequence length among the 925 recognized non-coding ORFs3.5. Influence of horizontal gene transferHorizontal gene transfer (HGT) is one of the most important driving forces in prokaryotic evolution that can drift among bacteria not only from similar strains, but also from distantly related species.53 In the cases of P. horikoshii and C. crescentus, 9 (PH0055, PH0216.1n, PH0221, PH0428, PH1184, PH1187, PH1741, PH1861, PHs009) and 16 (CC_0370, CC_0605, CC_0853, CC_1246, CC_1274, CC_1712, CC_2413, CC_2699, CC_2731, CC_2732, CC_2737, CC_3515, CC_3516, CC_3517, CC_3520, CC_3548) of the recognized non-coding ORFs listed in Supplementary Table S6 are detected as HGTs by the HGT database,54 respectively. The predicting procedure employed in the HGT database is based on the parametric methods, which identify anomalous sequence signatures of all the genes and derived protein sequences for each organism. The parametric approaches are based on the hypothesis that sequence features are similar within a genome but differ significantly between genomes. However, just as the authors of the HGT database have pointed out, these predicting results should be used with caution, for other forces may be responsible for the codon usage or G + C content heterogeneity of a genome. A recent comparison of different HGT prediction programs showed that these sequence composition-based methods could predict very different classes of genes.55 In addition, very recently acquired prophage elements tended to have sequence compositions that are more similar to the host genome, not representing amelioration but rather specialization and adaptation to their hosts.56 A recent study of large viruses further supported that some genes with atypical sequence composition are not horizontally acquired but are likely related to certain functions and gene features.57 This means that there are a considerable number of false negatives and false positives among the detecting results. Although very strict methodology has been outlined to improve the performance, recent researches show that the mean error of these HGT predicting methods is up to 39.96%, even for the most efficient programs.58 In most cases, the false positives are attributed to pseudogenes, segments of fossilized DNA, and the compositional asymmetries between genes lying on the leading versus lagging strand, selection for translational efficiency, mutation biases and random drift.59 In Section 3.4, we have verified that the filtered ORFs by our re-annotating algorithm are highly likely non-coding sequences that are over-annotated as protein-coding genes. On the other hand, our proposed algorithm is trained by the positive samples composed of those genuine protein-coding genes and the negative samples composed of the shuffled random sequences. Thereupon we infer that the 9 + 16 = 25 ORFs in P. horikoshii and C. crescentus that have been detected as HGTs by the HGT database are not laterally transferred in fact. That is, the falsely predicted protein-coding genes should also be taken into account for the false positives in HGT predictions in future studies.3.6. Comparing the presented algorithm with other programsIn the past decade, many de novo gene-finding algorithms have been proposed for discriminating the protein-coding genes in prokaryotic genomes. Thereinto, the HMM-based methods such as Glimmer60 and GeneMark61 are two most popular gene-finding programs that have been used in some re-annotating works.17,25 Our re-annotating algorithm has been shown to enhance the predicting performance extremely. The initial annotations of the 61 genomes listed in Supplementary Table S1 did not use these HMM-based programs. Then it is interesting to compare the presented method with the two prevalent gene-finding programs. Glimmer 3.02 and GeneMark.hmm 2.4 are performed on the 61 species, and the performance is evaluated based on the known functional genes. In Supplementary Table S2, we present the predicting results. As a result, Glimmer 3.02 and GeneMark.hmm 2.4 achieve the average accuracies of 98.89 and 99.14%, respectively. It is noted that no records or appropriate reference species were found for S. maltophilia, Acidovorax citrulli and C. michiganensis genomes when performing the GeneMark.hmm program. Using the models trained by other species to annotate these genomes, the accuracies are much lower (<50% in most cases). By contrast, the presented integrative method achieves an average accuracy of 99.94%, which is ~1% higher than the two other programs. Analysing the predicting results of Glimmer 3.02 and GeneMark.hmm 2.4, we found that although similar accuracy is obtained, the results differ greatly in most cases. Taking the genome of Escherichia coli CFT073 as an example, Glimmer 3.02, GeneMark.hmm 2.4 and our algorithm miss 21, 20 and 3 items of the 2580 annotated known functional protein-coding genes, respectively. Then highly similar accuracies are obtained by Glimmer 3.02 (99.19%) and GeneMark 2.4 (99.22%). Based on the two programs, 5155 (Glimmer) and 5015 (GeneMark) ORFs are predicted as protein-coding genes in E. coli CFT073 genome, respectively. Among the 5338 potential protein-coding genes annotated in the current RefSeq database, there are 4803 common items identified by Glimmer 3.02 and 4701 common items identified by GeneMark.hmm 2.4, which mean that 535 and 637 ORFs are excluded as non-coding by the two programs, respectively. Besides, there are only 4803 common items observed by Glimmer and GeneMark. These comparisons indicate that there are significant differences among the predicting results by Glimmer and GeneMark.hmm even they share similar accuracy. Then, it is difficult to determine which one is superior to another, and additional bioinformatics analysis is necessary to avoid the increase in both false positives and false negatives when using these programs. Recently, Luo et al.25 excluded 608 annotated protein-coding genes in E. coli CFT073 genome from the RefSeq database. In their work, four gene-finding programs were adopted and the ORFs that are co-predicted less than three were deemed as non-coding. However, according to our analysis, this kind of filtering strategy is not rigorous enough, and some genuine genes can be lost, which results in the increase in false negatives. For comparison, we also re-annotated the protein-coding genes in E. coli CFT073 genome (Supplementary Table S5), and 77 hypothetical genes are recognized as non-coding. We have demonstrated that the presented integrative algorithm is reliable for the problem of over-annotation of protein-coding genes in microbial genomes, then we hope our work can provide an efficient platform for future re-annotation researches.3.7. Stability of the re-annotating algorithmIn the presented re-annotating algorithm, the negative samples used as the training set are generated by the randomly shuffled sequences. Then it is necessary to investigate the influence of the shuffled negative samples on the output of the re-annotating program. To accomplish the analysis, the known functional genes of P. horikoshii and C. crescentus genomes are employed following the subsequent steps. First, the re-annotating algorithm is performed on each genome 10 times, which correspond to 10 sets of negative samples. Then, for each genome, 10 vectors composed of the T_scores of these known functional genes are obtained. Finally, the correlations among the 10 vectors are calculated, and a 10 × 10 matrix can be obtained for each genome (Supplementary Tables S7 and S8). In the obtained 10 × 10 matrix, the elements listed in the diagonal equal to 1 (omitted in corresponding tables), which represent the self-correlation of each vector. The underlying assumption is that the more significantly correlated among the 10 vectors, the more stable the re-annnotating program is. The results can also be visualized in Fig. 4, in which we present the standard deviation and the average values of each column. The average correlation coefficients are bigger than 0.97 for both genomes. Then the correlations among the 10 vectors are overall significantly positively correlated (P < 0.01). This can be validated by normalizing the T_score vectors with the following equation, <U+2060>, where Tn is the initial T_score of corresponding ORF. For convenience, we present the normalized results in Supplementary Table S9, from which one can find the results by the 10 running times are much consistent with each other. Therefore, our re-annotating algorithm is robust. Even so, the T_score of some individual ORFs may slightly fluctuate in some cases, hence we advise the users to perform the program more than one times (five in the present paper) and determine those ORFs with T_score <0 whose occurring times equal or more than a given threshold (three in the present paper) as non-coding. Correlations among the 10 vectors composed of each genome.Correlations among the 10 vectors composed of each genome.3.8. ConclusionGenome annotation is a multi-level process and annotating errors can emerge at different stages.12 As have been reported in many works, most of the over-annotated protein-coding genes are generated by the de novo gene-finding programs. However, it is difficult to validate these predicted genes by database searches or ‘wet’ experiments one by one, because the excessive computational and expensive cost. In addition, recent re-annotation works showed that only a limited proportion of hypothetical genes can be validated through database searches method.24,25 Therefore, the deposit of experimental information cannot meet the update speed of explosively increased number of microbial genomes. In this work, we propose an integrative method for filtering the falsely predicted protein-coding genes in microbial genomes. After testing the re-annotating algorithm on 61 microbial genomes, we demonstrate that the re-annotating algorithm is efficient and robust based on sufficient bioinformatics analysis. Our study indicates that the phenomenon of over-annotated protein-coding genes exists in most microorganisms in different degree. Although many re-annotating works have been conducted on some functional microbial genomes in recent years, our research shows that precise analysis is necessary to avoid increasing the false-negative rate of protein-coding genes.4.

IntroductionDue to their ability to transpose to virtually any genomic site, transposable elements (TEs) have the ability to generate deleterious mutations in the host genome. In response, host cells have devised strategies to control TE activity. RNA interference (RNAi), which has a prominent role in this control, is triggered by small RNAs. Several families of small RNAs have now been reported, but it appears that D. melanogaster mainly has two RNA silencing mechanisms that repress transposons expression: endo-siRNAs (endogenous small interfering RNAs) and piRNAs. piRNAs (for PIWI-interacting RNAs) are mainly derived from TE antisense strands and are produced from discrete genomic loci.1 piRNAs are from 26 to 30 nucleotides (nts) in length and have been reported in the reproductive apparatus of Drosophila, mice, rats, and humans.2,3 Endo-siRNAs are ~21 nts long and associate with the argonaute protein Ago2. Like piRNAs, endo-siRNAs are mainly derived from retrotransposons and other genomic repetitive elements. However, contrasting with piRNAs, endo-siRNAs are likely to be expressed ubiquitously.4–7 It is currently proposed that piRNAs and endo-siRNAs have a germline-specific function and a soma-specific function, respectively, in the establishment of TE silencing.4Besides these post-transcriptional regulations implicating RNAi silencing pathways, TEs can also be transcriptionally silenced. A range of chromatin modifications suppress their transcription, including histone modifications and altered chromatin packing.8 Furthermore, in both plants and mammals, DNA methylation on cytosine residues is another important signal that represses TE transcription and provides a mechanism for inheritance of TE silencing.We recently reported that PIWI is necessary for silencing of ZAM and Idefix, two long terminal repeat retrotransposons from Drosophila melanogaster, in the ovarian follicle cells, but is dispensable in other somatic lineages throughout fly development.9 However, it remains unclear whether a specific chromatin structure is deposited on these elements and in which tissues. Furthermore, since DNA methylation is absent from D. melanogaster, nothing is currently known about the mechanisms involved to maintain their silencing through cell divisions. Here, we investigated further the chromatin structures necessary to silence Idefix.Like most transposable families, many copies of Idefix are detected within the Drosophila genomes. Active copies are generally dispersed on chromosomal arms but many copies corresponding to Idefix vestiges also exist and accumulate in the heterochromatic regions. It was then of prime importance to follow the silencing exerted on a copy known to a target of the RNAi pathways. To this aim, we made use of sensor transgenes carrying a GFP (green fluorescent protein) reporter gene followed by an Idefix fragment that recapitulates the control exerted on active copies of Idefix.9 Analysis of the chromatin structure deposited on the transgene could then be easily explored over the GFP sequence that is unique in the genome.We show that in somatic cells in contact with the germline, the silencing needs to constantly target the Idefix sequence to be maintained. By contrast, in the other somatic tissues referred to as the soma, the silencing is stably established even when the TE fragment is excised. Our data further indicate that a compact chromatin structure likely associated with Polycomb (PC)-dependent chromatin structures is deposited.2. Materials and methods2.1. Drosophila strains and transgenic linesThe following mutant fly stocks were used: ago2414,10 ago251B,11 dcr2[L811fsX],12 PIWI2 and PIWI3,13 r2d21,14 and loqs[f00791].15 Bl279 (+; +/+; MKRS hs-Flip/Tm6) comes from Bloomington stock. pc1 comes from Cavalli's lab.About 419 bp homologous to the Idefix gag coding region (1003–1422) were inserted either in a sense (tGgIds) or anti-sense orientation (tGgIdas) according to gfp transcription within the pUASt-gfp vector. Three and six independent transgenic lines were analyzed for tGgIds and tGgIdas, respectively (Table 1). Characteristics of tGgIds and tGgIdas lines in somatic tissues and their homologous piRNA and endo-siRNAs (esiRNAs) reported in the databases4,31Characteristics of tGgIds and tGgIdas lines in somatic tissues and their homologous piRNA and endo-siRNAs (esiRNAs) reported in the databases4,312.2. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assaysChromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed using the standard procedures, which was modified as follows: for each immunoprecipitation, three OD260 of chromatin in ChIP buffer was pre-incubated in the presence of 80 µl of Protein A-Agarose (PAA) beads (Millipore) for 30 min at 4°C. PAA were removed, antibodies were added (a control in the absence of antibody named Input was included), and samples were incubated overnight at 4°C in a rotating wheel. Then, 60 µl of PAA were added and incubation was continued for 1h at 4°C. Samples were washed in saline concentration buffer. Chromatin was eluted from PAA in 500µl of elution buffer (sodium dodecyl sulfate and NaHCO3) at room temperature for 15 min. The eluate was incubated overnight at 65°C to reverse cross-links and treated by proteinase K for 1h at 50°C. Samples were phenol–chloroform extracted and ethanol precipitated. DNA was resuspended in 40 µl of 10 mM Tris (pH 7.5).qPCR (quantitative polymerase chain reaction) (ABI 7300) from at least two biological-independent extractions and three technical replicate was performed using SYBR Green (Sigma) and Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen). Enrichment was calculated relative to RpL32 and values were normalized to input measurements; the error is indicated by the standard error of mean (SEM). Antibodies used include: H3K9-di-methylation #07-441, H3K9-tri-methylation #07-523, H3K9/K14-acetylation #06-599, H3K27-di-methylation #06-421, H3K27-tri-methylation #06-449, H4K20-mono-methylation #07-440, H2A-ubi #05-678 from Millipore, heterochromatin protein 1a (HP1a) (C1A9) from DSHB, and PC and PH antibodies were provided by G. Cavalli Lab. The following primers were used uptssF: CCAAGCTTTGCGTACTCG and uptssR: CCGTGGGGTTTGAATTAAC for the upstream gfp TSS; gfpF: ACCATTACCTGTCCACACAA and gfpR: CCAGCAGCTGTTACAAACTC for the gfp gene; and RpL32F: CCGCTTCAAGGGACAGTATC and RpL32R: GACAATCTCCTTGCGCTTCT for the control gene RpL32.2.3. Fluorescent staining and microscopyOvaries were dissected and fixed in 5% formaldehyde in phosphate buffer solution for 15 min each hour after the heat shock. GFP was viewed in whole-mount ovaries using the 488 nm filter set of the ZEISS LSM 510 confocal microscope.2.4. In situ hybridizationFISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) was performed on larval imaginal discs, as described previously.16 Detailed coordinates of the PCR fragments used to produce the probes can be provided upon request. Three-dimensional images were acquired on a Leica SP5 confocal microscope using a 63X objective. The colocalization was searched for automatically by using a script written on Imaris XT software (Supplementary Fig. S2). Three hundred and five and 179 nuclei were examined from seven tGgIdas and seven tGgDId larval discs, respectively.3. Results3.1. Idefix sequence is continuously required for its silencing in the follicle cells but not in other somatic tissuesTo characterize further the silencing targeting Idefix in the somatic tissues, we used a sensor transgene called tGgIdas. In this transgene, the gfp reporter gene driven by the UASt promoter was linked to a fragment of the gag gene of Idefix (Fig. 1A).9 When tGgIdas is driven by a ubiquitous driver, Actine-Gal4, a GFP signal is detected neither in the follicle cells nor in other somatic tissues throughout development: larvae, pupae, and adults (Fig. 1B). When Idefix is excised and a new line established with the sensor transgene lacking Idefix sequence, then GFP is fully recovered (see tGgDId line, Fig. 1B). Since tGgIdas is repressed in all the somatic tissues within and outside of the ovaries because of the Idefix sequence, we used it to test whether its silencing might switch to an active state as soon as the targeted fragment of Idefix has been excised. Structure and silencing of tGgIdas. (A) Structure of tGgIdas: the gfp reporter gene is depicted by a white rectangle and its TSS by an arrow.

Heat shocks were performed for 1 h on third instar larvae. If tGgIdas silencing is stably established in somatic tissues, GFP repression should persist through cell divisions even after the Idefix fragment has been flipped out. Alternatively, if the silencing is labile and depends on a regulatory pathway that needs to constantly target Idefix sequence to establish the repression, then the silencing should be lost and the GFP expression recovered during the life of the fly as soon as the Idefix sequence is flipped out (Fig. 2A). The silencing exerted on tGgIdas is lost in the follicle cells as soon as the targeted retrotransposon sequences are excised, but remains in the soma. (A) Tested hypothesis: (left) if tGgIdas silencing is labile and depends on a regulatory pathway that needs to constantly target Idefix sequence to establish the repression, then the silencing should be lost and the GFP expression recovered even during the life of the fly as soon as the Idefix sequences is flipped out; (right) if the silencing is stably established in tissues due to a compact heterochromatic structure able to maintain a cellular memory, GFP repression should persist through cell divisions even after the Idefix fragment has been flipped out. (B) (left column) When the CF line [HS-Flp, Actin>FRT>yellow>FRT>Gal4, UASt-gfp] is submitted to a heat shock treatment, GFP expression is detected in the follicle cells as soon as 15 h after treatment (second panel) and a full expression at 24h (third panel).

The transgenic lines tGgIdas (left panel) and the test line CF (right panel) are analyzed at time intervals presented below the figure: 0, 24, 48 and 72h. Tub is a loading control.In a first set of experiments, we determined the time necessary for the FLP recombinase to excise a DNA fragment flanked by FRT sequences after induction by heat shock. We used a triple transgenic line designated as CF (for control Flp). A first transgene is the Flp recombinase under the control of the heat shock promoter (HS-Flp). A second transgene (Actin>FRT-yellow-FRT>Gal4) carries the ubiquitous actin promoter upstream of a yellow gene flanked by FRT sequences and a Gal4 reporter gene placed downstream. When yellow is present, Gal4 is not expressed. The third transgene of the CF line carries the UASt promoter placed upstream of the gfp reporter gene. If a heat shock is performed in this triple transgenic line, the yellow gene flanked by FRT sites is excised. The Gal4 protein is then expressed, and in turn, activates the UAS-gfp transgene giving rise to fluorescence. A kinetic of GFP appearance in both the follicle and larval cells at time intervals of 1h after heat shock was performed, and the time necessary to recover GFP expression was determined in both tissues. We estimated that 15 and 24h was the beginning of expression of the UAS-gfp reporter gene in the follicle cells and the larval tissues, respectively, and a complete expression was recovered after 24h in the follicle cells and 48h in larvae (Fig. 2B and C, left columns).Then, we determined how long the silencing of the tGgIdas transgene persists after Idefix has been flipped out. A heat shock was performed on flies or larvae with the genetic backgrounds [Actin-Gal4/+; tGgIdas/HS-Flp] or [Actin-Gal4/+; tGgIdas/TM6].Ovaries were dissected every hour from the heat-shocked flies and GFP expression examined in the follicle cells. We found that fluorescence was detected in some patches 15h after the heat shock (Fig. 2B, right column, middle panel) and a strong green signal in the entire follicular epithelium was recovered after 24h (Fig. 2B, right column, lower panel). These data indicate that the repression exerted in the follicle cells is reversible as soon as the targeted retrotransposon sequence is excised.When examined in larvae, GFP expression remained undetectable 24 s after heat shock induction in flies [Actin-Gal4/+; tGgIdas/HS-Flp]. Fluorescence was hardly detected 48h after treatment and remained very faint even after 72h, indicating that a full expression was not recovered (Fig. 2C, right column).As controls, we verified first that the Idefix fragment has been indeed excised after the heat shock treatment (PCR amplifications not shown), and second, that GFP expression is not due to the heat shock treatment, but indeed to Idefix excision since no GFP was detected in cells with the [Actin-Gal4/+; tGgIdas/TM6] genetic background after heat shock.Then, proteins were extracted from the treated larvae at different time intervals from 0 to 72h and western blot experiments were performed with an antibody raised against GFP. The reference line established with the tGgDId transgene with no Idefix sequence and the w1118 line with no gfp transgene were used as positive and negative controls of GFP expression, respectively. In accordance with results described above, western blots revealed that in [Actin/+; tGgIdas/hs-flp] larval tissues (denoted tGgIdas-flp on Fig. 2D), the level of GFP was hardly detected by 48 or 72 as opposed to the level of GFP expressed from the CF line 48 or 72h after heat shock (Fig. 2D, left and right panels, respectively).Overall, experiments performed on larval tissues indicate that in these somatic tissues, the silencing persists even after the Idefix sequence has been excised what contrasts with the silencing exerted in follicle cells.3.2. Histone methylation marks cover silenced transgenes in somatic tissues outside ovariesWe asked whether specific chromatin structures could mark tGgIdas within and/or outside of the ovaries. In a first set of experiments, post-translational histone modifications including lysine acetylation and methylation were analyzed. Whereas acetylation is generally linked with gene activity, methylation of histone H3 on Lys9 (H3K9) and Lys27 (H3K27) correlates with gene silencing. We performed ChIP assays using antibodies against H3K9/K14 acetylation, H3K9me3, H3K27me2, H3K27me3, and H4K20me1, followed by a real-time PCR performed with a primer set targeting gfp from both tGgIdas and tGgDId transgenes (Fig. 1A).In the ovaries, the H3K9me3, H3K27me2, or H3K27me3 marks were found absent from tGgIdas and tGgDId transgenes (Fig. 3A–C). As expected, when the repressive marks are absent, both of these transgenes displayed an enrichment of H3K9 acetylation (Fig. 3E). Histone post-translational modifications associated with the silenced sensor transgene in ovaries and larvae: the histograms show relative amounts of H3K9me3 (A and A'), H3K27me2 (B and B'), H3K27me3 (C and C'), H4K20me1 (D and D'), and H3K9/H3K14Ac (E and E'). Each panel displays the results obtained from ovaries (left) and larvae (right) of transgenic lines tGgIdas (gray bar) and tGgDId (black bar). ChIP was performed on the gfp reporter gene (A–D) and upstream of its TTS (A'–D') (see primer sets in Materials and methods). Measurements were normalized to the RpL32 gene. Error bars, SEM.Histone post-translational modifications associated with the silenced sensor transgene in ovaries and larvae: the histograms show relative amounts of H3K9me3 (A and A'), H3K27me2 (B and B'), H3K27me3 (C and C'), H4K20me1 (D and D'), and H3K9/H3K14Ac (E and E'). Each panel displays the results obtained from ovaries (left) and larvae (right) of transgenic lines tGgIdas (gray bar) and tGgDId (black bar). ChIP was performed on the gfp reporter gene (A–D) and upstream of its TTS (A'–D') (see primer sets in Materials and methods). Measurements were normalized to the RpL32 gene. Error bars, SEM.By contrast, a very strong enrichment of the methylated marks was detected on tGgIdas in larval tissues (Fig. 3A–C). These repressive chromatin hallmarks depend on the presence of Idefix because they are enriched >3–10-fold when the Idefix sequence is present compared with tGgDId. They also depend on tGgIdas transcription since they are found absent when it is not activated by the Gal4 driver (data not shown). In contrast, histone marks such as H3K9 acetylation were found completely absent from tGgIdas compared with tGgDId (Fig. 3E).We further verified that the H4K20me1 mark, generally associated with transcriptional repression and chromosomal condensation, is also enriched on tGgIdas when compared with tGgDId in larval tissues, whereas it is absent in ovaries (Fig. 3D). Finally, we also analyzed the H3K9me2 modification and found no enrichment on tGgIdas compared with tGgDId (Supplementary Fig. S1).Given the evidence that heterochromatin structures can spread along the chromatin fiber, we wondered whether histone marks associated with the sensor transgenes in the larval tissues could be detected outside of the transcription start site (TSS). We performed ChIP experiments using primers spanning a region from -440 to -330 bp upstream of the TSS (Fig. 1A). We observed similar results as those obtained with primer targeting gfp. On one hand, there is an enrichment of H3K9me3, H3K27me2, H3K27me3, or H4K20me1 on tGgIdas in the larval tissues. On the other hand, these repressive marks were found absent from the sensor transgene in the ovaries, whereas an H3K9 acetylation similar to tGgDId was observed (Fig. 4A'–E'). PC and PH, not HP1, are required to silence the sensor transgene in larvae: the histograms show relative amounts of HP1 in A and A', the PC protein in B and B', and PH protein in C and C'. Each panel displays the results obtained from ovaries (left) and larvae (right) of transgenic lines tGgIdas (gray bar) and tGgDId (black bar).

Post-translational histone modifications generally linked to repression are only observed in non ovarian somatic tissues.3.3. PC binding, and not HP1, correlates with histone methylation at silenced transgenesHP1 has been implicated in TE silencing in ovaries.17 Thus, we were interested to test whether HP1 could be detected on the silenced transgene either in ovaries or larvae. ChIP experiments revealed that tGgIdas could not be immunoprecipitated with an anti-HP1 antibody at levels above background (Fig. 4A and A'). ChIP experiments performed on a region targeted by HP1 (the heterochromatic flam/COM locus) was used as a positive control for the ChIP experiment (Supplementary Fig. S1). These results indicate that HP1 does not cover tGgIdas in somatic cells.Evidence of H3K27 methylation in larval tissues suggested that Polycomb group (Pc-G) proteins might be implicated in the transgene silencing. Indeed, the methylation of H3K27 is a hallmark of the silencing mediated by PRC2, since it is carried out by the Histone Methyl Transferase Enhancer of Zeste, E(z), the catalytic subunit of PRC2. The chromodomain of the Drosophila PC protein from the PC repressive complex 1 (PRC1) binds to the H3 tail peptide trimethylated at K9 and more strongly at K27me2/3. This prompted us to investigate Pc-G proteins occupancy. ChIP assays were performed with antibodies against PC and Polyhomeotic (PH). Again, two distinct patterns of enrichment were observed. A very strong enrichment of both these proteins was detected on the gfp gene in larval tissues, whereas neither PC nor PH proteins could be detected on the gfp gene in the ovarian follicle cells (Fig. 4B and C).Given the evidence that heterochromatin structures can spread along the chromatin fiber, ChIP assays were performed using primers taken upstream of the TSS of tGgIdas (Fig. 1). Results indicated that an enrichment of PC and PH was also detected in larval tissues outside of the TSS (Fig. 4B' and C'). A comparably low amount of PC and PH marks was detected on tGgIdas and tGgDId in the follicle cells (Fig. 4B' and C').To further verify that the binding of Pc-G protein is indeed a hallmark of the chromatin structure associated with the repressed transgene in the somatic tissues outside of the ovaries, we performed three additional tests. First, we investigated whether a colocalization of Pc-G bodies and the targeted transgene might be visualized in larval imaginal discs. A combination of 3-D FISH and immunostaining technique (FISH-I) was used, allowing the detection of the relative localization of the transgene with Pc-G bodies visualized using an anti-PH antibody. The tGgIdas transgene used in this study is integrated on chromosome 3R at the cytological position 25591560, 937 bp upstream of the Kay gene. This site is not a Pc-G binding site reported by Negre et al.18 We found that the colocalizations of tGgDId on one side, and tGgIdas on the other, with Pc-G bodies are statistically different, 19 versus 29%, respectively (P < 0.02; Fig. 4D). Thus, insertion of tGgIdas results in a higher incidence of this locus to colocalize with Pc-G bodies than the same transgene without the Idefix sequence. Second, we performed similar ChIP assays on tissues extracted from adult carcasses and verified that indeed the same enrichment in Pc-G proteins is observed in these somatic tissues (Fig. 5A) compared with a low H3K9 acetylation (Fig. 5B). Third, we verified that H2A ubiquitination of lysine 119, which is performed by the PRC1 E3 ubiquitin ligase Sce/RING, is also a histone mark linked to PC silencing of tGgIdas19,20 (Supplementary Fig. S1).

Measurements were normalized to the RpL32 gene. Error bars, SEM.Finally, to definitively implicate Pc-G protein in the silencing, we aim at analyzing the effect of PC mutant on the silencing exerted on tGgIdas. However, described mutants of PC are recessive lethals. Moreover, a clonal analysis was not possible due to the FRT sequences present in the transgene. Nevertheless, since Pc alleles are found regularly but with low expressivity as dominant phenotypes, transgenic flies tGgIdas were crossed to pc1/TM6 mutant backgrounds. GFP expression was examined in the larval progeny [tGgIdas/+; pc1/+] and compared with [tGgDId/+; +/+] larvae as a control for GFP expression when the Idefix sequences has been flipped out and to [tGgIdas/+; +/+] as a positive control for GFP silencing. As exemplified Fig. 4E, a faint but significative expression of GFP was recovered in the Pc heterozygous mutant background (Fig. 4E, right). Finally, to verify that HP1 is not implicated in the silencing of tGgIdas, we examined GFP expression in larvae heterozygous for an HP1 mutant allele, [tGgIdas/+; Su(var)2055/+]. No GFP expression was recovered in these larvae (Fig. 4E).Overall, the data indicate that a repressive structure implicating Pc-G protein is associated with the sensor transgene tGgIdas in somatic tissues outside of the ovaries.3.4. Which signal is required in the soma to target Pc-G proteins to the sensor transgene?We wondered whether the silencing observed in the somatic cells has the capacity to discriminate one strand of the sensor transgene from the other. To this end, we established new transgenic lines carrying a transgene, tGgIds, similar to tGgIdas except that the same Idefix fragment has been inserted in a sense orientation. Three independent transgenic lines were established. When the expression of tGgIds and tGgIdas was examined in the follicle cells where the Piwi pathway has been clearly implicated, we found that both of them were repressed in this tissue (Fig. 6A). However, we found that, unlike tGgIdas, tGgIds is not targeted to silencing in the soma where a full GFP expression is observed (Fig. 6A) and it is not enriched in repressive chromatin hallmarks such as H3K27me3 as illustrated in Supplementary Fig. S1. Characteristics of the silencing targeting tGgIds (A) and tGgIdas (B) transgenes. (A) The silencing targeting the sensor transgene tGgIds is active in the ovaries and inactive in the larvae (first and third panels from the left, respectively). Expression of tGgIds is driven by the ubiquitous actin-Gal4 driver. Expression of the transgene after flp-recombinase action (tGgIds-Flip) is presented as a positive expression of the GFP reporter gene in the second and last panels. (B) Mutations of genes involved in the endo-siRNA pathway do not release the silencing exerted on the tGgIdas sensor transgene. GFP expression is never recovered in larvae from homozygous mutants for r2d2, dcr2, loq, and ago2.Characteristics of the silencing targeting tGgIds (A) and tGgIdas (B) transgenes.

GFP expression is never recovered in larvae from homozygous mutants for r2d2, dcr2, loq, and ago2.This result indicated that the silencing mechanism involved in the soma is likely to be an RNA silencing pathway able to discriminate between the two mRNA strands produced by the transgenes. Since the silencing of TEs is presumed to be directed by the endo-siRNA pathway in the soma, we investigated whether proteins involved in the endo-siRNA pathway were necessary actors for the silencing exerted on tGgIdas. Therefore, we compared GFP expression in homozygous mutant and wild-type flies for dcr2, ago2, loq, and R2D2. We found no release of GFP silencing in either of these mutant backgrounds (Fig. 6B).4. DiscussionIn this study, we tested whether the silencing targeting a TE sequence in somatic lineages constantly needs the presence of the target or alternatively, once established, the silencing is maintained even though the targeted sequence is lost. We further correlated differences observed in the ovarian follicle cells versus other somatic tissues with differences in the chromatin structures established on the target.We found that, in vivo, the Idefix sequence is continuously required for its ongoing repression in the follicle cells. Its repression is not heritably maintained through cell divisions. Accordingly, neither the hallmarks of histone post-translational modifications that generally correlate with compact chromatin structure, nor HP1 or Pc-G proteins are linked to the silenced sensor transgenes. This result argues against the current model in which piRNA–PIWI protein complexes silence transposons in ovarian tissues by directing assembly of heterochromatin-like domains.17 Interestingly, using ovarian somatic stem cells transfected with double-strand RNAs corresponding to Piwi, Haase et al.21 reported recently that the integrity of the piRNA pathway is essential for the ongoing repression of mobile elements. Consistent with our results, they further provided evidence that, once set by the action of Piwi proteins on chromatin, a transposon silencing cannot be autonomously maintained.Considered together, these studies promote a model in which, in the follicle cells, TEs are submitted to a post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) which is not coupled to an epigenetic silencing state implicating an HP1-dependent heterochromatin structure.By contrast, the assembly of a compact chromatin structure marked by the methylation of H3K9 and H3K27 targets TEs in the somatic cells outside of the ovaries. Furthermore, our study identifies Pc-G proteins as major actors. The two PRCs, PRC1 and PRC2, are involved in this structure seeing that H3K27me3 mediated by the histone methyl transferase E(z), belonging to PRC2, is detected as well as PC and PH proteins which belong to PRC1. We further demonstrate that this compact chromatin structure has two main consequences on the targeted locus. First, it can spread along the chromatin fiber and invade the genome upstream of the TSS of the sensor transgene. Second, once established, repression of the sensor transgene is then stably maintained throughout cell divisions and does not need the TE sequence to constantly direct the silencing.Exploiting the mechanism of PC-mediated silencing to repress endogenous retroelements has also been described by several studies performed on mice.22,23 Furthermore, in a recent study, the E(z) homolog, EZH, in the green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, has been implicated in the repression of both (hetero)euchromatic transgenes and dispersed retrotransposons.24 Therefore, consistent with the present study, all these data point PRC1 and PRC2 as evolutionarily conserved epigenetic factors employed to silence TE and convey the silencing from one generation of cells to the next.Interestingly, our study further points out that HP1 is not a partner of the chromatin structure associated with tGgIdas either in the ovaries or in the soma. Although HP1 has been frequently reported as associated with TE,17,25 our data are in line with recent data published by the Drosophila modENCODE project.26 This project has generated data sets that profile histone modifications, chromosomal proteins, transcription factors, and nucleosome properties across a developmental time course and in multiple cell lines. Their data show that only TE located in heterochromatin are marked by HP1. By contrast, TE inserted in euchromatic regions are not covered by HP1 as found for tGgIdas. Thus, one can assume that HP1 might be a signature of TE vestiges because of their heterochromatic localization, whereas HP1-independent silencing pathways might act within euchromatic regions to specifically silence full-length TE and prevent their mobilization.Overall, if our data implicate PRC1 and PRC2 as epigenetic factors employed to silence TE, they fail to explain how the TE sequence is recognized. In our effort to identify the effector mechanism directing Pc-G proteins on the targeted sensor transgene, we found that the silencing machinery active in the soma has the capacity to discriminate between both orientations of the Idefix sequence present within the sensor transgene. Indeed, tGgIdas is targeted to silencing, whereas tGgIds is not. This result is consistent with a recognition occurring at the RNA, and not the DNA, level.However, PRC1 and PRC2 employed in this silencing do not have specificity for only one strand and not the other. Therefore, one has to assume that their binding occurs under the presence of a primary signal which brings the sequence specificity. In our study, we were unable to identify this signal. Kanhere et al.27 reported that short RNA from 50 to 200 nts transcribed from the 5' ends of PC target genes play a role in the association of PRC2. Such short RNAs complementary to Idefix sequences could potentially explain the targeting. Another likely possibility is that the recognition might occur via homologous siRNAs produced by the cell. Epigenetic complexes made of small RNAs together with PRC1 or PRC2 might potentially explain their recruitment to homologous genomic sequences.28–30Given the evidence that TEs are mainly silenced in the soma via the endo-siRNA pathway, genetic mutants affecting these pathways should have resulted in a loss of the sensor transgene repression. However, no variation in the GFP expression could be detected in these mutant backgrounds. A plausible explanation is that, once established on the transgene, the silent epigenetic state cannot be released even though the targeted fragment is excised or the silencing pathway necessary for the target recognition mutated. Nevertheless, our study pointed out that, like in the follicle cells where piRNAs are involved (Table 1),9,31 the primary effectors acting in the soma are likely to be single-stranded molecules since only one strand of the mRNA produced by the sensor transgene is targeted. This is comforted by the list of endo-siRNAs reported in the databases (Table 1). Endo-siRNAs able to target and silence tGgIdas are reported in the databases, whereas none is complementary to the Idefix fragment inserted in tGgIds.Overall, in the soma, we propose that the silencing of TE is initiated by a PTGS mechanism which is successively coupled to transcriptional gene silencing. This latter displays all the molecular imprint underlying cell memory and epigenetic inheritance. This epigenetic state, absent in the ovarian follicle cells, accounts for the molecular mechanism controlling maintenance of TE silencing during development.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by grants from the Association pour la Recherche contre le Cancer (ARC 1139).

IntroductionGene expression studies are very important to gain insights into the function of gene(s). Two commonly used techniques for measurement of gene expression levels in complementation to each other are DNA microarray and reverse-transcription–quantitative PCR (RT–qPCR) analysis.1 The RT–qPCR has very high sensitivity and is often used to validate the results of DNA microarray studies.2–4 Normalization is considered as the key factor, which affects the reliability of RT–qPCR results.5 The normalization is done with a suitable reference gene, which is ubiquitously expressed at stable level in different biological contexts. Until recently, a variety of housekeeping genes, such as actin, tubulin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), elongation factor 1-a (EF1-a), polyubiquitin and ribosomal RNA, were being used as reference gene(s), which were supposed to express stably in different biological contexts because of their known role in basic cellular processes. However, it has been reported in many studies that the expression of these genes are also regulated and therefore, their transcript level varies in different cell types and/or experimental conditions, making them unsuitable for use as reference genes in normalization of gene expression results.6–11 The expression stability of reference genes showing highly stable expression under one set of experimental conditions may vary under other set of experimental conditions, and thus, their choice remains a drawback. Furthermore, the set of most suitable reference genes may differ in various species even under the identical experimental conditions. Therefore, for a particular study, a species-specific set of most suitable reference genes needs to be identified for accurate normalization of gene expression data.Several studies have been performed to identify the most suitable housekeeping gene(s) under specific environmental conditions in various organisms, including plants, to use them as reference genes for normalization.12–15 However, only a few studies have been performed to identify the novel reference genes.9,16–18 Using microarray data, expression of all the genes can be examined simultaneously to identify the novel genes showing uniform expression under selected experimental conditions or tissue types. A plethora of microarray data have been generated for various plant species in different biological contexts and are available in the public databases, which can be utilized for this purpose. Only a few studies have been carried out using microarray data of Arabidopsis, Glycine max (soybean) and rice to predict the most suitable reference genes under specific experimental conditions followed by their validation using RT–qPCR and/or statistical algorithms.9,16,17,19In this study, we have developed a web server, PlantRGS, which identifies the most suitable candidate reference genes for quantitative gene expression studies in plants based on the microarray data. PlantRGS provides a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) that allows automatic analysis of thousands of arrays simultaneously and generates a list of most suitable candidate reference genes with their gene description, expression statistics [mean signal value, standard deviation and coefficient of variance (CV)] and graph showing relative expression as output. The server will be very valuable for the scientific community to identify the most suitable reference gene(s) to be used for normalization in gene expression studies.2. Materials and methods2.1. Microarray data download and pre-processingMicroarray data based on Affymetrix platform for the nine different plant species, including Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis), G. max (soybean), Hordeum vulgare (barley), Oryza sativa (rice), Populus (poplar), Solanum lycopersicum (tomato), Triticum aestivum (wheat), Vitis vinifera (grape vine) and Zea mays (maize), available at the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database of NCBI comprised of 11 187 arrays, were downloaded. All the downloaded CEL files were subjected to normalization using MAS5 algorithm using Affymetrix Expression Console software (http://www.affymetrix.com) at default parameters. Signal intensities and absolute calls (present, marginal or absent) measured for each probeset in all the arrays using Expression Console were recorded. The probesets having detection P-value < 0.05 were assigned as present call, those with detection P-value =0.065 were assigned as absent call and the remaining as marginal call.2.2. Microarray data processing and outputThe microarray data processing method implemented in the PlantRGS for the identification of most suitable reference genes is based on the previous studies.9,17 User-selected microarray experiments/arrays and parameters from the server application are taken as an input in the Perl processing module. The absolute call (present/marginal/absent) information about all probesets for the selected arrays and signal intensity (linear or log transformed) values only for the probesets having present call in at least given percentage (user-defined) of the selected arrays are obtained from the MySQL database. These probesets are further filtered on the basis of signal intensity range defined by the user for selected arrays. Mean signal intensity, standard deviation and CV (mean/standard deviation) for the filtered probesets are calculated and the given number of probesets showing least CV with their statistics is displayed along with the corresponding gene locus id and description (if available). In addition, user-specified probesets (if provided) are also searched in the list of filtered probesets and their statistics is also displayed. The gene description for Arabidopsis, rice and soybean probesets was used from TAIR (http://www.arabidopsis.org/), Rice Oligonucleotide Array Database (http://www.ricearray.org/) and SoyBase (http://soybase.org/), respectively. However, for other plants, gene descriptions were derived from the significant (E-value = 1e-5) best hit of the target sequences of the probesets with Arabidopsis or Uniprot proteins in BLASTX search.2.3. Statistical assessment of gene expression stabilityTo assess the gene expression stability of the reference genes predicted by the server and traditional reference genes, we used geNorm v3.5 software.20 The signal values were converted into relative quantities for analysis using geNorm. geNorm calculates the average expression stability (M) value for each gene being analysed based on the mean pairwise variation in the expression of a gene from all other genes under investigation.202.4. Web server architecture and implementationPlantRGS adopts a four-tier architecture (Java/Java/Perl/MySQL) as depicted in Supplementary Fig. S1A. The server has been presently hosted on a Linux workstation with two quad-core 3.33 GHz Intel Xeon processors and 12 GB of RAM. The server application has been implemented in Java and the client GUI was developed using Java 2 Swing technology. The pre-processed microarray data have been stored into MySQL database on the server. Processing of the data has been employed in Perl programming language. The client-side GUI can be launched either by using web browser-dependent applet or web browser-independent Java Web Start technology (using .jnlp file available for download). The server can accept requests from multiple clients simultaneously using a specified port.3. Results3.1. Data acquisition and web serverMicroarray data from Affymetrix platform comprised of a total of 593 experiments including 11 187 arrays from nine different plant species were used in the current version of PlantRGS. Microarray data generated using Affymetrix platform show high degree of reproducibility and homogeneity across different laboratories when compared with other platforms and thus provide better opportunity to identify the genes with uniform expression across various experimental conditions. Largest data set was available for Arabidopsis (432 experiments and 5689 arrays) followed by soybean (23 experiments and 3109 arrays) and least for tomato (7 experiments and 173 arrays). The microarray data represented a wide variety of experimental conditions, including developmental stages, abiotic and biotic stress conditions, light/hormone/chemical treatments and genotypes/mutants/transgenics. The number of experiments and arrays for all the nine plant species included in the PlantRGS is given in Supplementary Table S1. A complete list of all the experiments along with their accession number and description available at GEO has been provided in the download option of the web server. Other plant species, for which very less microarray data are available at GEO, has not been included in the current version. We intend to include the microarray data for more plants in the subsequent releases of PlantRGS, when sufficient data for them become available in the public databases.All the microarray experiments were curated either manually or using curated data source PLEXdb21 to assign them to broad experimental factor ontology term(s). The microarray experiments were classified broadly into development/tissue-type, abiotic stress, biotic stress, hormone, other stimuli and genetic line/cultivar, ontology term(s). The experiments which could not be classified into these ontology terms were kept in miscellaneous category. This classification will help the users to select all the microarray experiments for a specific environmental condition under study, without putting extra effort in going through their description.PlantRGS GUI provides various tools and options to select the plant species and experiments/arrays, process the data and analyse, manage, export and load the results. The signal intensity values of each probeset for all arrays after normalization with MAS5 algorithm have been stored in MySQL database of the web server. The user-friendly GUI provides different tools and parameter options to investigate most suitable reference genes without the requirement of high computational resources and technical expertise. The user interface outputs the most suitable reference genes listed in the ascending order of CV. A lower value of CV indicates higher expression stability of that gene across the selected set of arrays or experimental conditions. The server may be accessed by multiple users simultaneously without compromising the speed and accuracy of prediction. The results were generated in couple of minutes on the server, when tested for the data set of soybean, with default parameters for simultaneous requests from three different clients.3.2. Identification of most suitable reference genes using PlantRGSThe workflow for using PlantRGS has been illustrated in Supplementary Fig. S1B. After launching the application, selection of a plant species to be studied loads all the microarray data available for it on the GUI. Microarray data representing different experimental conditions can be selected from the hierarchical tree of experiments/arrays or ontology terms. A set of parameters, including log transformation, per cent present call, signal intensity range and number of reference genes to be identified may be specified. In addition, probeset ids may be provided for comparison of their expression stability with those predicted by the server. After selecting experiments/arrays and suitable parameters, run the analysis and results will be displayed in result area of GUI. The results can be exported in tab-delimited text file (tables) and images (graph).The PlantRGS web server highlights several key parameters for identifying most suitable candidate reference genes as described below. Selection of microarray experiments. The microarray experiments for a plant species can be selected depending on the experimental conditions to be analysed. The broad ontology terms may be used to select the microarray data for desired experimental conditions. More is the number of microarray experiments selected, better will be the reliability of the reference genes identified by the server. In case of non-availability of the microarray data for the identical experimental conditions being analysed, microarray experiments representing broadly similar conditions may be used for the analysis. Although it is not recommended to use the microarray data of a closely related species to identify the reference genes, candidate reference genes may be shortlisted. It is strongly recommended that expression stability of orthologues of such candidate reference genes should be validated experimentally before their use in the gene expression studies.Log transformation and present call. Log-transformed or linear signal intensity values of the probesets can be used for the analysis. Log transformation of the microarray data has been recommended to make the distribution more symmetric and Gaussian-like. We also suggest the analysis of microarray data in the log-transformed state. In addition, the option of per cent present calls filters the probesets showing present call (detection P-value <0.05) in at least given number (%) of arrays from the total number of selected arrays. For example, the default option of 90% ensures that the expression of each probeset is detected with a present call in at least 90% of the arrays selected for the analysis.Signal intensity range. A good reference gene should have comparable expression level to that of the gene(s) of interest to be analysed under given experimental conditions. There might be cases where the expression level of gene(s) to be analysed is very low, for example, transcription factor-encoding genes.2 For such studies, the highly stable but lowly expressed reference gene(s) might be the best choice for normalization of quantitative gene expression data.9 By defining the signal intensity range in the parameters, reference genes with desired expression level suitable for the given study can be identified.User-defined probeset ids. This option helps users to compare the expression stability of the traditional reference genes or genes of their choice with that of predicted by the PlantRGS, in the selected experiments/arrays. Defining user-defined probesets lists their expression statistics along with those predicted by the server for a comparative analysis of their expression stabilities to identify the most suitable one. This option also helps to identify the most suitable reference gene showing the expression level comparable to the gene(s) of interest.After the identification of most suitable reference genes by the server, GUI displays results in the form of tables (Fig. 1A) and graph (Fig. 1B). Two tables are generated in the result area, one showing the description (probeset id, gene locus id and gene description) and statistics (mean signal intensity, standard deviation and CV) for the given number of most suitable reference gene predicted by server and user-defined probeset ids (if provided). The detailed information about these genes can be investigated on their respective genome project web sites in web browser through the links provided on the corresponding gene IDs. In the second table, the signal values of the predicted reference genes and user-defined probeset ids (if provided) in all the arrays used for the analysis are displayed, which are used to generate graph for the relative expression levels of the selected probesets. Figure 1A and B shows the screenshots of the 25 most suitable reference genes identified by the PlantRGS from the whole data set of rice along with five user-defined probesets (highlighted in grey) and graph showing their relative expression levels in all the arrays, respectively.

Validation of the PlantRGS resultsWe identified most suitable reference genes for all the nine plants using whole microarray data sets available for each species. A list of top 100 most suitable candidate reference genes identified by PlantRGS is available as Supplementary Table S2. Their gene description shows that most of these represent novel reference genes involved in various cellular processes. A few case studies were performed to validate the results obtained from PlantRGS. The results were assessed using a widely used statistical algorithm, geNorm,20 which calculates the M value for each gene being analysed. The gene with lowest M value is considered to have most stable expression and rank higher. We identified most suitable reference genes for the whole data sets of rice and Arabidopsis using PlantRGS and compared their expression statistics with that of traditional reference genes followed by validation of their expression stability using geNorm. In addition, we also compared the results obtained from PlantRGS and those reported in the previous studies using smaller data sets.Using the whole microarray data set of rice comprised of 688 arrays, we identified top 25 most suitable candidate reference genes using default parameters and specifying six user-defined probesets for traditionally used reference genes (representing ubiquitin, actin, GAPDH and tubulin) using PlantRGS. All the reference genes predicted by PlantRGS ranked higher in terms of their expression stability (lower CV) than the traditional reference genes (Fig. 2A). Further, the assessment by geNorm also showed lower M value and hence more expression stability of the reference genes identified by the PlantRGS in comparison to the traditional reference genes (Fig. 2A). Although one traditional reference gene encoding for ubiquitin (Os.5425.1.S1_at) was comparable with novel reference genes in terms of M value, it ranked lower due to marginally higher M value and CV. Mean signal intensity was higher for most of the traditional reference genes with higher standard deviation, indicating their higher and variable expression across the experimental conditions. The most suitable reference genes identified from the whole data set of rice may be used for normalization of quantitative gene expression data from a wide variety of experimental conditions. Validation of the results obtained by PlantRGS for whole data set of rice (A) and Arabidopsis (B). The expression stability (M, represented by bars) of top 25 novel reference genes predicted by PlantRGS (open bars) and five traditionally used reference genes (black bars) were calculated by geNorm in all the arrays/experiments available for rice and Arabidopsis. A lower value of M (scale on left axis) indicates higher expression stability. The line with triangles indicates CV for each gene (scale on left axis), and the line with points indicates mean signal intensity (scale on right axis) with standard deviation (error bars).Validation of the results obtained by PlantRGS for whole data set of rice (A) and Arabidopsis (B).

A lower value of M (scale on left axis) indicates higher expression stability. The line with triangles indicates CV for each gene (scale on left axis), and the line with points indicates mean signal intensity (scale on right axis) with standard deviation (error bars).A total of 5689 arrays of Arabidopsis representing wide variety of experimental conditions and tissue types were analysed for the identification of most suitable reference genes using default parameters. All the top 25 reference genes predicted by the server were superior in terms of expression stability exhibiting lower CV and M value when compared with the six traditionally used reference genes, including polyubiquitin, actin, tubulin, EF1-a and GAPDH (Fig. 2B). The M value was significantly higher for most of the traditional reference genes indicating their lower expression stability.We have also compared the results of PlantRGS with those reported in previous studies using a subset of microarray data for rice and Arabidopsis. We used the same microarray data set(s) used in previous studies and identified most suitable reference genes using our server and compared the results. The analysis revealed that among the top five reference genes identified by Narsai et al.19 using microarray data for different stress conditions in rice; four were included in the top 25 genes identified by the PlantRGS with a comparable M value and CV (Supplementary Fig. S2A). A comparison with the reference genes identified for different developmental stages in rice17 showed that the top 25 genes predicted by the server outperformed the previously identified genes (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Likewise, we also compared the results for various developmental stages and abiotic stress conditions in Arabidopsis reported by Czechowski et al.9 using the same microarray data sets. In both data sets, we found the reference genes predicted by the PlantRGS performed better or comparable to the previously identified reference genes (Supplementary Fig. S2C and D). It is noteworthy, that in all the above case studies, the reference genes predicted by the server outperformed the traditionally used reference genes in terms of expression stability.4. DiscussionRT–qPCR is a very powerful tool for the accurate and reliable quantification of gene expression, if implicated without any systematic errors. The most common source of error in the RT–qPCR results is the inappropriate choice of reference gene(s) for normalization, which may lead to erroneous results. Therefore, the identification of most suitable reference genes for a particular set of experimental conditions and their systematic validation is crucial for quantitative gene expression studies. Although efforts to identify the most suitable reference gene(s) for a particular study followed by validation before their use have been increasing, unfortunately, however, its importance is still being disregarded. This problem is mainly due to the poor availability of user-friendly tools and resources, and requirement of substantial time and efforts. The web server, PlantRGS, developed in this study, provides user-friendly, interactive and platform-independent GUI tool for the identification of most suitable candidate reference gene(s), which adopts Java 2 Swing technology for automatic and very fast processing of a large amount of microarray data with minimal technical skills.A few previous studies have suggested the use of microarray data for the identification of better candidate reference gene(s) for RT–qPCR data normalization.9,17,19 Czechowski et al.9 reported the first use of microarray data for the identification of superior reference genes. Recently, using microarray data sets encompassing organ, development, biotic and abiotic conditions, 151 genes with relatively stable expression under all conditions were identified in rice.19 The microarray data analysis-based strategy has been implemented in PlantRGS also, for the identification of most suitable candidate reference gene(s) under given experimental conditions. PlantRGS utilizes the whole microarray data set available for a plant species or for a specific biological context (e.g. developmental stage/tissue-type, abiotic stress, biotic stress and hormone treatment etc.), for the identification of best candidate reference gene(s) with minimum expression variance. The selection of signal intensity range is a very important feature of the PlantRGS, which facilitates the identification of a reference gene(s) having expression levels similar to the gene(s) of interest. The geNorm-based statistical analysis validated the better performance of the novel candidate reference genes identified by PlantRGS when compared with traditionally used housekeeping genes. However, it is recommended that the stable expression of candidate reference genes identified by PlantRGS should further be validated experimentally before using for normalization. Further, in case the orthologues of reference genes identified for one plant species are being used for normalization in other species, the validation of expression stability is must. Recently, Narsai et al.19 showed that among the 15 orthologues of novel Arabidopsis reference genes,9 only one exhibited stable expression in rice, suggesting that caution must be taken while selecting reference genes from other plant species.Recently, next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies are being increasingly used for the quantification of gene expression. Although these technologies provide high throughput and absolute abundance of the transcripts, their high cost and less data availability remain a drawback when compared with the microarray studies as of now for global gene expression profiling. In addition, the choice of statistical methods for normalization and expression analysis using NGS data is a challenge.22 A few studies have been performed using sequence-based approach for the identification of suitable reference genes.23,24 We propose that the concept/method used in PlantRGS may be used for the identification of candidate reference genes from NGS data in future with the availability of more data and better statistical methods for the analysis.5. ConclusionIn this study, we have developed a user-friendly web server tool, PlantRGS, for the identification of most suitable reference genes under selected experimental conditions using microarray data for various plant species. Various features implemented in PlantRGS allow the identification of best suitable reference gene(s) for a given study. Validation studies showed that the novel reference genes identified by PlantRGS outperform the traditionally used reference genes and are better candidates for gene expression normalization. We anticipate that the availability of this tool will facilitate immensely the reliability and accuracy of the quantitative gene expression studies in plants.6.

IntroductionHevea brasiliensis, commonly known as rubber tree, is almost the sole source of natural rubber production. Natural rubber has a wide range of industrial applications and is under increasing global demand. Hevea brasiliensis is a perennial cross-pollinating and monoecious plant that belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family. The observation of tetravalents during meiosis has lead to the conclusion that H. brasiliensis is a stabilized amphidiploid (2n = 4x = 36).1 However, the pattern of marker ratios segregating in a population of over 100 trees suggests that H. brasiliensis behaves as a diploid (2n = 36).2 Several research groups have developed molecular markers to study the genetic diversity of H. brasiliensis,3–8 including isozymes,9 restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs),10 amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs),2 microsatellites (or simple sequence repeats, SSRs)2,8,11,12 and expressed sequence tag (EST)-SSRs.3 These markers have also been used to construct the linkage maps2 and quantitative trait loci (QTL) maps.13–16 Lespinasse et al.14 produced the first rubber tree linkage map containing 301 RFLPs, 388 AFLPs, 18 SSRs and 10 isozymes, which was later used to identify the QTL variants conferring resistance to the South American leaf blight.13–15 Recently, Le Guen et al.16 constructed the linkage maps based on SSR and AFLP markers and were able to identify the QTL conferring resistance to Microcyclus ulei.In many organisms, ESTs have been useful for the annotation of genes during genome sequencing efforts,17 for comparative genome studies18 and for the production of a genetic linkage map.19 To date, there are only 12 365 ESTs from H. brasiliensis in GenBank, restricting the quality of research that can be performed on this important plant species. Previous transcriptome studies of H. brasiliensis have been limited in range, focusing mainly on latex in order to gain insight into the rubber biosynthesis pathways.20–22 Of the available H. brasiliensis ESTs, 11 256 ESTs are from latex, 1091 ESTs are from bark and 18 ESTs are from leaves. In addition to gene discovery, EST resources enable the identification of markers such as EST-SSRs and single-nucleotide polymorphism. Since these markers are directly linked to functional genes, they are useful for assessing genetic diversity and mapping phenotypic traits. Feng et al.3 identified 799 SSRs in 10 829 ESTs available in the GenBank database and carried out the genetic diversity assessment of H. brasiliensis using 87 EST-SSR markers. The result provided evidence for cross-taxa transferability and indicated moderate polymorphisms of EST-SSR markers in Hevea species.3 However, additional markers are desirable to enable quality research into the genetic basis of commercially relevant traits that can be used in marker-assisted breeding programs.Genomic and transcriptomic resources for H. brasiliensis can greatly benefit from the application of the recent high-throughput sequencing technology, such as the 454 pyrosequencer,23 which has been instrumental in the development of genetic databases for several economical crops.24–27 The purpose of the present study is therefore to sequence the transcriptome of the shoot apical tissue, which is a highly dynamic structure, to discover genes, expand the EST database and develop EST-SSR markers that can be used for assessing genetic diversity, constructing linkage maps and identifying traits of commercial interest.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materialsThe shoot apical meristem (SAM; 1-cm long from the vegetative shoot apex) of H. brasiliensis (clone RRIM600) was collected for RNA extraction from an experimental field at the Rubber Research Institute of Thailand, Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives, Thailand. The sample was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C until RNA extraction. For the analysis of SSR markers, leaf samples from 20 clones of H. brasiliensis, 2 accessions of Manihot esculenta, 3 accessions of Jatropha curcas and 1 accession of Jatropha gossypifolia (Supplementary data, File S1) were collected and DNA was extracted using a DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen). For genetic linkage map construction, 81 samples of an F1 mapping population were developed from a cross between RRIM600 as a female parent and RRII105 as a male parent. The plants were grown at Chachoengsao Rubber Research Center Office of Agriculture Research and Development, Department of Agriculture, Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives, Thailand. DNA samples were extracted using a DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen). The concentration of each sample was calculated from the OD measurement using a nanodrop ND1000 (NanoDrop Technologies).2.2. cDNA library preparation and sequencingTotal RNA was extracted using Concert™ Plant RNA Reagent (Invitrogen). Two hundred nanograms of the poly-A mRNA sample was isolated using an Absolutely mRNA Purification Kit (Stratagene) and fragmented in 10× fragmentation buffer (0.1 M ZnCl2, 0.1 M Tris–HCl, pH 7.0) at 70°C for 30 s. The reaction was stopped by adding 2 µl of 0.5 M EDTA and 28 µl of 10 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5. The mRNA sample was cleaned using Agencourt RNAClean reagent (Beckman Coulter), washed with 200 µl of 70% EtOH, air dried and eluted in 20 µl of 10 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5. Fragmented mRNA samples were converted to double-stranded cDNA with the cDNA Synthesis System Kit (Roche Applied Sciences) using random primers and AMV Reverse Transcriptase. A cDNA library for 454 pyrosequencing was prepared according to the October 2008 version of the cDNA Rapid Library Preparation protocol (Roche Applied Sciences). The cDNA library was amplified in emulsion PCR and subject to pyrosequencing on two full picotiter plates of the Genome Sequencer (GS) FLX Titanium platform using the October 2008 version of the titanium chemistry protocol (Roche Applied Sciences).2.3. Sequence analysisPoly-A/T(18) and 454-adapter sequences were trimmed off. Sequence reads with low quality (average quality scores <20), short reads (<100 bp), rRNAs and tRNAs were removed. Sequence assembly was performed using the cDNA option of Newbler 2.5, the de novo sequence assembly software. The cDNA option assembles reads into contigs much like a genomic assembly; however, this option allows/expects contigs to have multiple joining contigs representing alternately spliced genes. These contigs (which essentially represent exons) are then assembled into isotigs (representing processed mRNA) and isotigs utilizing the overlapping subsets of contigs are grouped into isogroups (representing genes, isoforms or gene families). When the maximum number of contigs in an isogroup is exceeded, the contigs are output as un-traversed contigs in the isotigs file; all further mention of isotigs will include these un-traversed contigs. Unique sequences were searched for sequence homology against the Uniprot plant protein database (www.uniprot.org); and reference protein sequences of Manihot, Ricinus, Arabidopsis and Oryza (www.phytozome.net) using the BLASTx program with a cutoff at E-6.28 The assignment of functionality via gene ontology (GO) was performed using Blast2GO.29The MISA-MIcro SAtellite identification tool (http://pgrc.ipk-gatersleben.de/misa/misa.html) was used to search for SSR from the EST data set. For the searches and comparison of microsatellites, SSRs were defined as being mononucleotide repeats (MNRs) =10 repeats and di- (DNRs), tri- (TNRs), tetra- (TTNRs), penta- and hexanucleotide repeats =6 repeats; criteria for composite SSRs was an interval of bases =100. For the purpose of marker evaluation, we increased stringency to reduce the number of candidates. We designed primer pairs overlapping DNRs and TNRs =8, TTNRs =7, pentanucleotide repeats (and more) =6 or containing complex SSRs =30 nucleotides. In some cases, candidate SSRs that passed the criteria suggested by Feng et al.3 were prioritized based on the presence of motif size polymorphisms in the sequence alignment results.2.4. SSR markers from the previous reportsPrimer pairs designed for the amplification of genomic SSR markers from the NCBI database (AY486558.1–AY486910.1) and previously described8 were used to construct a linkage map together with novel EST-SSR markers.2.5. SSR analysisDNA samples were extracted from young leaf tissue using a DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen). Primer pairs were designed to amplify SSR regions using PRIMER3.30 PCR was carried out in a total volume of 10 µl containing 2 ng of DNA template, 1× Taq buffer, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 1 U Taq-DNA polymerase (Fermentas) and 0.5 µM each of forward and reverse primers. Amplification was performed in a GeneAmp PCR 9700 thermocycler (Applied Biosystems) programmed as follows: 94°C for 2 min followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 52°C for 30 s, 72°C for 1 min and a final extension step at 72°C for 10 min. Amplified products were separated on 5% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and visualized by silver staining.2.6. Analysis of polymorphic lociTwenty accessions of H. brasiliensis, as listed in Supplementary data, File S1, were used for the polymorphism analysis of SSR markers. Details of primer pairs for amplifiable EST-SSR markers are listed in Supplementary data, File S2. Scored data from polymorphic loci were used to calculate the polymorphism information content (PIC).31 Observed heterozygosity and expected heterozygosity were calculated using the PowerMarker 3.25 software.32 The cross-taxa transferability of H. brasiliensis SSR loci were evaluated using six other taxa of Euphorbiaceae plants, including two accessions of M. esculenta, three accessions of J. curcas and one J. gossypifolia (Supplementary File S1). The percentage of transferability was calculated for each taxon by dividing the number of successfully amplified SSR loci by the total number of loci analysed. A genetic similarity matrix was prepared for the 20 H. brasiliensis genotypes at 47 EST-SSR loci (Supplementary File S3) using the NTSYSpc 2.2 software.33 UPGMA (un-weighted pair group method with arithmetic mean) cluster analysis was conducted usizSpc 2.2 software.332.7. Linkage map constructionEighty-one of H. brasiliensis progenies derived from across between RRIM600 and RRII105 were used as mapping population. Genomic DNA of individual samples was used to genotype with informative primers and genotypic data were scored as codominant markers under the cross-pollination model, e.g. <abxcd>, <efxeg>, <lmxll>, <nnxnp> and <hkxhk>) with up to four distinguishable alleles as described by Van Ooijen and Voorrips.34 The integrated parental genetic linkage map was constructed using the double pseudo-testcross strategy by JoinMap 3.0.34 The Mendelian segregation ration of all markers was evaluated using the chi-square test (<U+03C7>2) and distorted markers (P = 0.1) were excluded. The map was constructed with an LOD score threshold of 3.0 and the mapping parameters were set with a recombination threshold of 0.4, a jump threshold of 5.0 and a minimum LOD score threshold of 1.0. The map distance between two markers in centiMorgan (cM) was calculated using Kosambi's mapping function.35 The linkage map was drawn using MapChart 2.2.363. Results and discussion3.1. Transcriptome sequencing of rubber treeA total of 2 311 497 filtered sequence reads were generated from the vegetative shoot apical tissue with an average read length of 294 bases totalling 676.5 Mb. The majority of the reads were in the range 200–400 bp (Fig. 1). All reads were deposited in DDBJ Read Archive (ID = DRA000170). There were 191 369 (8.27%) reads with homology to plant tRNAs and rRNAs and 139 838 (6.04%) reads shorter than 100 bp which were removed before sequence assembly. Raw sequencing reads were assembled by Newbler 2.5, the de novo sequence assembly software,23 currently the most robust software for 454 transcriptome assembly.37 A total of 28 387 isotigs from 19 152 isogroups and 84 926 singletons were obtained from the assembly. An isogroup theoretically represents a single gene; however, genes with high sequence similarity may be grouped together and therefore isogroups may also represent gene isoforms or gene families. The isotigs had an average length of 1326 bp and the majority of isotigs were between 500 and 1000 bp (Table 1). The largest isotig (isotig08423) was 9041 bp, which showed sequence similarity to the M. esculenta chloroplast polycistronic transcript psaA-psaB (YP_001718437.1; E-value = 0). The most highly represented isotig (isotig00002) was assembled from 22 641 reads and the highest blast match was the Hevea hydroxynitrile lyase Chain A (AAC49184.1; E-value = 1E-59), reflecting the high level of cyanogenesis activity in the tissue sample. It is well recognized that all living tissues of H. brasiliensis, including seeds, are strongly cyanogenic accumulating high quantities of cyanogenic precursors such as linamarin and lotaustralin.38 The average GC content of the H. brasiliensis transcriptome generated in this study was 42.16%, which is similar to the GC content of H. brasiliensis sequences in the GenBank EST database (42.18%). The GC content of H. brasiliensis coding sequences is slightly lower than the average GC content of Arabidopsis coding sequences (44.5%) and rice coding sequences (51.5%);39 but much higher than Arabidopsis intergenic regions (32.9%; http//gi.kuicr.kyoto-u.ac.jp). All unique transcripts were annotated and characterized according to GO using BLAST2GO29 and the result is available at http://www4a.biotec.or.th/rubber. Isotig and singleton sequence length distributionIsotig and singleton sequence length distributionRead length distribution of 454 reads of the H. brasiliensis transcriptome.Read length distribution of 454 reads of the H. brasiliensis transcriptome.In total, 61 625 isotigs and singletons were assigned one or more GO terms. Under the biological process domain, 71 071 assignments were made, with a large proportion of assignments falling into the categories metabolic process (31.07%) and cellular process (29.94%). A total of 60 927 assignments were made to the molecular function domain, with the majority falling into the categories binding activity (46.52%) and catalytic activity (39.82%). This distribution of GO terms is similar to the previous study in the pea SAM transcriptome sequencing.40 The large number of annotated sequences shows that ESTs generated by high-throughput sequencing are more likely to represent mRNA than ESTs generated by lower-throughput methods, such as previous studies performed on the latex transcriptome.20–22 The reason for this is that high-throughput sequencing generates sequence data supported by multiple reads, often representing complete mRNAs. The majority of EST sequences currently in GenBank from Chow et al.20 are mostly un-annotated singletons with only 904 sequences (26%) that have GO terms assigned. Also, the diversity of the latex transcriptome is limited as Han et al.2,2 pointed out that the genes expressed in latex are mainly associated with rubber biosynthesis pathways, defence mechanisms and allergenic proteins. A larger diversity of genes was considered more likely to be found in the vegetative shoot apex tissue than in latex, and that is what has been found here.A unique characteristic of the shoot apical tissue is the maintenance of the SAM via intercellular communication involving a complex signalling network such as epigenetic control,41,42 transcriptional gene regulation43–45 and hormonal regulation.46 Key regulatory genes controlling SAM maintenance, such as WUSCHEL (WUS) and SHOOT MERISTEMLESS (STM) genes, were identified as putative full-length cDNAs in this data set. Recent studies revealed that WUS plays the key role in SAM maintenance through the regulatory loop of WUS–CLAVATA (CLV) feedback41,47,48 and interacts with STM via phytohormone signalling pathways.49 Furthermore, the regulation of WUS expression is also controlled by auxin signalling, chromatin remodelling and positive and negative transcriptional regulators.50 Transcripts for a positive transcriptional regulator of WUS, such as APETELA2,45SPLAYED and BARD1, which bind to the WUS promoter sequence43 were found in this data set. Whereas, WUS negative transcriptional regulators which are required for development of floral organs, such as ULTRAPETALA151 and HANABA TARANU52 transcripts, were not detected.Also identified were genes from the KNOX (Knotted-like homeobox) family such as STM and KNOTTED-LIKE FROM ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA (KNAT) genes which are essential in maintaining the balance between organ primordia growth and stem cell maintenance in the SAM.53 KNOX transcription factors have roles in suppressing gibberellins (GAs) in the SAM by inhibiting GA-20 oxidase, which is required for GA biosynthesis, and promoting GA-2 oxidase, which inactivates the active GA.54 Thus, KNOX proteins prevent the accumulation of GA in the central zone of the SAM, consequently preventing the differentiation of stem cells. KNOX proteins also promote cytokinin activity in the SAM central zone stimulating division and maintenance of undifferentiated stem cells.46 Flanking the SAM, high levels of auxin and GA activities have roles in development and growth of lateral organ primordia.46 The tissue sample in this study contained both undifferentiated meristem and differentiated organ primordia; therefore, it was likely to identify transcripts of genes involving in many phytohormone biosynthesis and signalling pathways.3.2. Similarity of rubber tree ESTs to other plant proteinsTo investigate the efficiency of gene discovery in the H. brasiliensis transcriptome, the isotigs and singletons were searched for homology using BLAST28 against other plant reference sequences such as M. esculenta (Euphorbiaceae, Rosids), Ricinus communis (Euphorbiaceae, Rosids), Arabidopsis thaliana (Brassicaceae, Rosids) and Oryza sativa (Poaceae, Liliopsida). The majority of H. brasiliensis unigenes matched against proteins from Manihot (102 936 or 48.1%), followed by Ricinus (97 089 or 45.4%), Arabidopsis (84 643 or 39.5%), then Oryza (77 805 or 36.3%) as shown in Fig. 2. Hevea, Manihot and Ricinus are phylogenetically related and grouped together in the Euphorbiaceae family; therefore, it was expected that a large number of H. brasiliensis isotigs and singletons would match proteins from Manihot and Ricinus. These observations agree with previous studies on cross transferability of EST markers which demonstrated a high level of genome conservation among plants in Euphorbiaceae, especially Hevea and Manihot.3,55,56 However, it should also be noted that sequence homology analysis by BLAST can be biased by the number and quality of query database and the reference databases. Homology results of H. brasiliensis isotigs and singletons that matched to proteins in the plant reference databases (Manihot esculenta, Ricinus communis, Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa) using BLASTx.Homology results of H. brasiliensis isotigs and singletons that matched to proteins in the plant reference databases (Manihot esculenta, Ricinus communis, Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa) using BLASTx.3.3. EST-SSR: distribution and frequenciesA total of 17 819 SSRs were identified in the isotigs and singletons from the H. brasiliensis transcriptome (Table 2). This represents an average frequency of one EST-SSR in every 3383 bp, which is a lower frequency than the previous report (1 SSR per 2.25 kb) by Feng et al.3 Among plant species, SSR frequencies range from 1 per 1.5 kb in coffee57 to 1 per 67 kb in mungbean.25 The distribution and frequencies of EST-SSRs significantly vary between different studies due to SSR search criteria, the size of the EST database and software tools,58 so the MISA software was used with the same criteria as the previous study on H. brasiliensis EST-SSRs3 to allow for direct comparability. From 17 819 SSRs identified, there were 12 682 MNRs, 3458 DNRs, 1593 TNRs, 51 TTNRs and 35 SSRs with pentanucleotide repeats or more. It should be noted that the number of MNRs may not be accurate due to the limitations of the 454 technology in reading long homopolymer sequences. MNRs were described here for the purpose of comparison with previous studies but they were not used for polymorphism analysis. The most common type of DNR was AG/CT which accounted for 64.43% of the repeats, followed by AT/TA (26.75%), AC/GT (8.48%) and GC/CG (0.3%). The most common type of TNR was AAG/CTT (32.53%), followed by AAT/ATT (19.17%) and ACC/GGT (18.33%). The least frequent DNR and TNR motif types were GC-rich motifs, which were found at only 33 loci. SSRs with GC-rich motif repeats are rare in many plants, such as H. brasiliensis,3 rice, corn, soybean,59 wheat,60Arabidopsis, apricot, peach61 and coffee.57Distribution of identified SSRs using the MISA software according to SSR motif types and repeat numbersMNR, mononucleotide repeat; DNR, dinucleotide repeat; TNR, trinucleotide repeat; TTNR, tetranucleotide repeat; PTNR, pentanucleotide repeat.Distribution of identified SSRs using the MISA software according to SSR motif types and repeat numbersMNR, mononucleotide repeat; DNR, dinucleotide repeat; TNR, trinucleotide repeat; TTNR, tetranucleotide repeat; PTNR, pentanucleotide repeat.3.4. Polymorphism test in EST markersFour hundred and thirty EST-SSRs were selected from EST-SSR present in the data set to give a range of repeat units and motif types, and primers were designed to amplify them. Based on the sequence homology search, 16 of 430 (3.7%) SSR primer pairs were mapped to the EST reads with GenBank accession numbers reported for the development of EST-SSR markers by Feng et al.3 The primary PCR screening in three clones of H. brasiliensis (RRIM600, RRIC110 and BPM24) showed that 323 primer pairs (75.11%) were amplifiable (primer sequences were listed in Supplementary File S2). We selected 47 primer pairs that flanked long SSR motifs (criteria mentioned above), gave clear PCR bands in the primary amplification screening and represented in all classes of nucleotide repeats for polymorphism evaluation among 20 different H. brasiliensis clones (Table 3). The number of alleles observed at each locus ranged from two to six, with an average of 3.85. Although H. brasiliensis is believed to be a stabilized amphidiploid, only five SSRs (EHB61, EHB100, EHB109, EHB115 and EHB144) gave more than two alleles supporting the report by Lespinasse et al.14 that H. brasiliensis behaves as a diploid. The value of expected heterozygosity varied from 0.1349 to 0.7494 with an average of 0.5594, while direct count heterozygosity ranged from 0.1429 to 0.8095 with an average of 0.5076. PIC values ranged from 0.13 to 0.71 with an average of 0.50, which is higher than the previous report (PIC = 0.38) by Feng et al.3 The higher PIC value in this study was probably due to a larger sample size of H. brasiliensis clones tested (n = 20) than the previous study (n = 12). The average number of alleles and PIC values of EST-SSR markers are lower than those of genomic SSR markers,8 as expected for functional sequences. Characteristics of the 47 primer pairs targeting polymorphic microsatellite loci analysed in 20 different clones of H. brasiliensis.Characteristics of the 47 primer pairs targeting polymorphic microsatellite loci analysed in 20 different clones of H. brasiliensis.The 47 polymorphic EST-SSR markers were used to evaluate the genetic relatedness among 20 different H. brasiliensis clones which were classified into two groups at the level of genetic similarity 0.44 (Fig. 3). This generally corresponded well to the clone pedigree (Supplementary File S1). The first group (Group I) contains clones: PB260, PB310, RRIM605, PB217, PB5/51 and PB235. The majority of these clones have PB5/51 or PB49 clones as one of the parental lines. Group II contains a mixture of primary clones and cultivated clones from various rubber research institutes. In one branch of Group II, RRII 203, RRIT21 and RRIC100 were clustered together and shared PB86 as one of the parents. Clone RRIT21, which is a descendant of PB86 × RRIT13, was closely grouped together with RRIT13 with a genetic similarity of 0.66. Another branch of Group II contained descendants of the Tjir 1 clone (RRIM600, RRII105 and RRIM703). Although RRIM605 has Tjir 1 as a female parent, RRIM605 was classified in Group 1 because it shares the same male parent (PB49) with PB260. Since these markers are able to reproduce the relationship that was already known from pedigree information, they can be used to provide reliable genotypic information for clonal identification and the selection of parents in breeding programs. The minimal set of five highly informative microsatellites (EHB85, EHB109, EHB169, EHB177 and EHB178) was able to distinguish each of the H. brasiliensis clones included in this study. Similarity relationships of 20 different H. brasiliensis clones based on 47 EST-SSR loci.Similarity relationships of 20 different H. brasiliensis clones based on 47 EST-SSR loci.Genotyping of the 93 EST-SSR makers that were amplifiable in H. brasiliensis was performed across genera with two accessions of M. esculenta, three accessions of J. curcas and one accession of J. gossypifolia, all belonging to the same family as H. brasiliensis, Euphorbiaceae. The results showed that 47 of 93 primer pairs (40%) gave successful amplifications in Manihot species. Fourteen primer pairs (15%) and nine primer pairs (10%) were successfully amplified in J. curcas and J. gossypifolia, respectively. The higher rate of cross-transferability in Manihot species compared with that in Jatropha species suggests a closer relationship of Hevea with Manihot than with Jatropha. Six primer pairs, EHB61, EHB63, EHB85, EHB115, EHB116 and EHB156, were able to amplify unique products from all plant taxa tested.3.5. Genetic linkage mapFrom 323 novel EST-SSR primer pairs amplifiable in H. brasiliensis, 59 primer pairs were polymorphic between RRIM600 and RRII105 parental clones. All of these polymorphic primers were used to genotype with 81 individual F1 samples together with 98 published SSR markers. Genotypic data were scored and subjected to linkage analysis. Of 157 polymorphic markers, 124 markers (78.9%) revealed the expected Mendelian segregation ratio and used to construct the genetic linkage map. The F1 map consisted of 97 loci distributed on 23 linkage groups. Of these, 37 loci were novel EST-SSRs. The total map distance covered 842.9 cM with a mean interval of 11.9 cM and the average loci per linkage group were approximately four loci (Fig. 4). The number of linkage groups exceed the expected haploid number of linkage groups (18 linkage groups), suggesting that more markers are required to fill the gap between adjacent markers. Moreover, the comparison between the F1 map in this study and the map constructed by Le Guen et al.16 using different parents revealed 25 common markers on nine homologous linkage groups between both maps (Table 4). A total of seven marker intervals of 20 markers showed co-linearity between homologous linkage groups. Some linkage groups in this study (LG7-LG8, LG11-LG15 and LG12-LG13) could be joined together based on the linked markers in Le Guen et al.16 The common and collinear markers indicated the reliability between different maps.62 Therefore, the F1 map of this study is appropriate for further studies in marker-assisted selection.

IntroductionBacterial leaf pustule (BLP) disease, caused by Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. glycines (Xag), is one of the most serious diseases in soybean. It reduces grain yield by 15–40% at high temperatures and high humidity, primarily through chlorophyll degradation and premature defoliation.1,2 Early reports3 suggested that BLP resistance in CNS (PI 548445) is controlled by a single recessive gene (rxp) surrounded by two simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers, Satt372 and Satt486, on chromosome 17 (previously linkage group D2).4–7 Based on quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping, one major and several minor QTLs for resistance to BLP have been identified in six different soybean chromosomes.6 Three loci are closely linked to homeologous rxp regions and their ancestral function was retained in the duplicated rxp loci.8 Despite extensive effort, rxp has yet to be isolated, and the soybean defence mechanisms of response to BLP have not been fully elucidated.Plants have evolved two defence mechanisms to resist pathogen invasion that involve different strategies of detecting pathogens. On the extracellular face of the host cell, pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) are recognized by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs); subsequent stimulation of PRRs leads to PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI).9,10 Although basal immune responses are activated, bacterial effector proteins delivered into host cells via a type III secretion system (TTSS) can suppress PTI.11,12 These pathogen effectors are recognized by specific resistance (R) genes, which encode nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains. These R gene products activate the second type of immune defence mechanism, effector-triggered immunity (ETI).9,10 Recognition of pathogen attack by PRRs and R genes leads to the activation of defence responses and a type of localized cell death known as the hypersensitive response.13,14Near-isogenic lines (NILs) are a useful and valuable material for mapping genes. Pairs of NILs differing by the presence or absence of a target gene have been used to isolate markers associated with the target gene and identify markers linked with pathogen resistance.15,16 NILs for BLP resistance have been reported using multiple backcrosses17 and shown to be more suitable for the identification of specific target genes rather than other populations such as recombinant inbred lines.18Comprehensive transcriptome analysis has provided new insight into developmentally and environmentally induced changes in gene expression. This information can be used to help predict the roles and interactions of individual genes, as well as to elucidate more complex signalling pathways activated in response to external stimuli and uncover potential cross-talk between these pathways. Over the past decade, microarray technology has enabled a more comprehensive understanding of the dynamic composition and regulation of transcripts in many plants, including soybean.19–21 Nonetheless, microarray-based transcript profiling has several limitations, including high background, low sensitivity, and non-specific or cross-hybridization signals, all of which hamper the accurate detection of low abundance transcripts and the discrimination of similar sequences.22,23 To overcome these sensitivity issues with microarrays, hundreds of specific primers for quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (qRT–PCR) analysis have been designed for the purpose of characterizing the expression of regulatory genes.24 However, both of these methods rely primarily on existing expressed gene sequences for the synthesis of oligonucleotides and for generating qRT–PCR primers.25,26Next-generation sequencing technologies, such as the widely used Illumina Genome Analyzer,27,28 provide powerful alternative strategies for transcriptome analysis using direct mRNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq). RNA-Seq technology involves generating whole cDNA short reads that are then mapped to genome sequences to obtain the number of ‘mapped reads’ of each gene. Using this approach, one can achieve unprecedented levels of accuracy and specificity in quantifying differentially expressed genes, identifying novel transcribed regions, and identifying alternative splice events.29,30Using a high-throughput gene expression profiling technique and available complete soybean genome sequences, genes involved in the soybean response to Xag infection were identified by differential expression profiling. The objectives of this study were to identify genes that are differentially expressed in BLP-resistant and BLP-susceptible NILs in response to Xag infection and to gain a better understanding of plant–pathogen interactions using soybean NILs for BLP resistance.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant material and Xag inoculationThe BLP-resistant NILs used in the current study were previously described.17 Briefly, NILs were generated by three cycles of repeated backcrossing of the BLP-resistant line, SS2–2, as the donor parent and the BLP-susceptible line, Taekwangkong, as the recurrent parent. SSR genotyping of the progeny of the backcrosses revealed that more than 93% of the recurrent parent genome was recovered.For inoculation with Xag, soybean plants were cultivated in growth chambers at 28°C under 12h illumination. Xag strain 8ra was cultured on peptone sucrose agar medium at 28°C for 48h31 prior to inoculation. Bacterial cultures were diluted to a concentration of 1 × 108 colony forming units/ml in 10 mM MgCl2 containing 0.1 ppm rifampicin antibiotic. This suspension was sprayed on the first fully expanded trifoliate leaves of 1-month-old soybean plants using an atomizer. As a control [0h after inoculation (hai)], plants were sprayed with 10 mM MgCl2 buffer. Inoculated plants were grown at 100% relative humidity.2.2. Sample preparation, read alignment, and sequence analysisTotal RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA purity was determined using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA), 1% formaldehyde gel electrophoresis, and a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). RNA from three biological replicates at each time point (0, 6, and 12 hai) was pooled in preparation for next-generation Illumina Genome Analyzer II (GA II) sequencing. All procedures, including mRNA purification, cDNA preparation, end repair of cDNA, adaptor ligation, and cDNA amplification, were carried out according to the manufacturer protocols accompanying the mRNA-Seq Sample Preparation Kit (Cat. RS-930-1001, Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).Purified cDNA libraries were dispensed onto an Illumina single-end flow cell composed of eight lanes using the Illumina Cluster Station (Illumina, Inc.). One lane was used per time point for the BLP-susceptible and BLP-resistant NILs; the 6 hai of BLP-resistant NIL was applied to two lanes to test for mechanical reproducibility. The remaining lane was used for an internal control. The 76 bp reads were collected using the Illumina GA II and sequencing-by-synthesis technology.Sequence reads were aligned using Bowtie (http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net), an ultrafast short-read mapping program,32 using the 8× sequence assembly of the soybean genome as a reference (Glyma1.01, http://www.phytozome.net/soybean).33 TopHat (http://tophat.cbcb.umd.edu) was used to identify splice junctions.34 Genes that were differentially expressed in BLP-susceptible and BLP-resistant NILs were identified with the statistical R package DEGseq (http://bioinfo.autsinghua.edu.cn/software/degseq) using an MA-plot-based method and a random sampling model.35 Raw digital gene expression data were normalized as reads per kilobase pair of transcript per million mapped reads (RPKM);27 genes for which the P-value was <0.001 were selected for further analysis. Expression data (reads) were log2-transformed and filtered at a level of 2-fold or greater difference in expression at each time point (0, 6, and 12 hai). Differential patterns of gene expression at the various time points are represented by Venn diagrams.2.3. Clustering and gene ontology analysesK-means clustering was performed using TM4: MeV 4.7 software (http://www.tm4.org/mev.html)36 and Pearson's correlation coefficient. Differentially expressed genes were grouped into 10 distinct clusters based on expression patterns. Annotation and assignment of functional categories for the genes in each cluster were assigned based on conserved PFAM domain predictions (http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/)37 and gene ontology (GO) analysis (http://www.geneontology.org/). Soybean genes identified by GO as containing PFAM domains were classified into three categories:38 biological process, cellular component, and molecular function. Differentially regulated genes were further classified into secondary categories within biological process, cellular component, and molecular function after comparison of BLP-susceptible and BLP-resistant NILs.2.4. Validations of RNA-Seq data by qRT–PCRqRT–PCR was performed to validate the RNA-Seq results for nine gene transcripts whose expression differed by more than 2.0-fold between the BLP-susceptible and BLP-resistant NILs after Xag inoculation. Primers for qRT–PCR were designed using Primer3 software (http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/primer3/).39 A Bio-Rad iScript™ cDNA Synthesis Kit (Cat. 170-8891, Hercules, CA, USA) was used to synthesize the cDNAs and real-time quantification was performed using a LightCycler 480 system (Roche Diagnostics, Laval, QC, Canada) and the Bio-Rad iQ™ SYBR Green Supermix Kit (Cat. 170-8882). Expression levels of the selected genes were normalized to tubulin expression. PCR mixtures (final volume, 50 µl) contained 200 ng of cDNA, 500 nM each primer, 18 µl of sterile water, and 25 µl of iQ™ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). The conditions for amplification were as follows: 5 min denaturation at 95°C followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 10 s, 60°C for 20 s, and 72°C for 10 s. Following amplification, melting curves were determined in a three-segment cycle of 95°C for 5 s, 65°C for 1 min, and 97°C for 0 s on the continuous acquisition mode. Samples were analysed in triplicate to ensure statistical significance. Data were analysed based on the stable expression level of the reference gene according to method of Livak and Schmittgen.403. Results3.1. BLP symptomsDisease severity in two NILs, one carrying the rxp-susceptible allele and the other carrying the rxp-resistant allele, was assessed 14 days after Xag inoculation (Fig. 1). Pustules surrounded by small yellow haloes were evident in the early stages after inoculation. There were more lesions in the BLP-susceptible NIL, and these lesions subsequently merged to form larger necrotic areas in the late stage of the disease. In the BLP-susceptible NIL, severe haloes and pustules were spread throughout the leaves. In contrast, in the BLP-resistant NIL, BLP disease symptoms were restricted to portions of the leaves (Fig. 1). Disease symptoms in BLP-susceptible and BLP-resistant NILs after Xag inoculation. Small yellow to brown lesions with a raised pustule typically formed in the early disease stage, with large necrotic lesions developing later.Disease symptoms in BLP-susceptible and BLP-resistant NILs after Xag inoculation.

RNA-Seq analysisChanges in transcript levels between the BLP-susceptible and BLP-resistant NILs at 0, 6, and 12 hai with Xag were analysed by RNA-Seq. A total of 125.7 million reads were generated by 76 bp single-end sequencing from the six cDNA libraries (BLP-susceptible NIL at 0, 6, and 12 hai and BLP-resistant NIL at 0, 6, and 12 hai), constituting 6.3 Gb of cDNA sequence (Table 1). Only the first 50 bp of the reads was used for mapping. Approximately 86% of the sequenced reads (108 million mapped reads) were successfully aligned to the soybean genome reference sequence (Glyma1.01, http://www.phytozome.net/soybean) using Bowtie and TopHat software.32–34 Of 65 781 predicted genes in the soybean genome, the expression levels of 46 367 mapped genes were quantified based on sequence reads. Using the random sampling model in the DEGseq program,35 mapped read counts of each gene with a P-value of < 0.001 were obtained. MA-plots revealed little variation in gene expression patterns for the different time points (Supplementary Fig. S1). A total of 15 678 genes were selected with high confidence based on RPKM values converted from mapped read counts by DEGseq (Supplementary Dataset S1). Statistics of the Illumina-GA II 76 bp reads and comparison to the G. max reference genome (Glyma 1.01)aThese samples were used as technical replicates.Statistics of the Illumina-GA II 76 bp reads and comparison to the G. max reference genome (Glyma 1.01)aThese samples were used as technical replicates.As described by Libault et al.,41 four reference genes, actin (Glyma08g19420), cons4 (Glyma12g02310), cons6 (Glyma12g05510), and tubulin (Glyma08 g01740), were used for the evaluation of gene expression. Eight additional genes containing a tubulin motif were also used as reference genes (Supplementary Table S1). The absolute value of the fold change for the reference genes ranged from 0.0040 (tubulin motif-containing Glyma20g27280 at 0 hai) to 0.7489 (tubulin motif-containing Glyma15g13970 at 0 hai), which indicated that the expression levels of the reference genes were not significantly different across treatment periods in the BLP-susceptible and BLP-resistant NILs. In addition, there was little technical variation, as shown by the similar expression profiles of two replicates of the BLP-resistant NIL at 6 hai (Table 1). These results indicated that the gene transcript data were reliable, and suitable for detection and further transcriptome analysis.3.3. Transcriptome analysis in response to Xag inoculationThe number of differentially expressed genes in the BLP-resistant NIL compared with the BLP-susceptible NIL at each sampling point was estimated [P < 0.001 and log2 (fold change) >2.0 or <-2.0]. A total of 2415 unique genes were up- or down-regulated in the resistant NIL at various times after inoculation. Of these, 1978 were up-regulated and 783 were down-regulated 0, 6, and/or 12 hai in the BLP-resistant NIL (Fig. 2). Of these, 346 genes were differentially regulated at each time point. For example, Glyma20 g15480 (a homologue of cytochrome P450) was up-regulated at 0 hai but down-regulated at 6 hai in the BLP-resistant NIL. Compared with the BLP-susceptible NIL, 1424 genes were up-regulated and 230 genes were down-regulated at 0 hai. Following Xag inoculation, 161 genes were up-regulated and 461 genes were down-regulated at 6 hai; 638 genes were up-regulated and 132 genes were down-regulated at 12 hai. A subset of genes was either up- or down-regulated at both the 6 and 12h time points (234 and 37, respectively) in the BLP-resistant NIL compared with the BLP-susceptible NIL. Of the 2415 genes that were differentially expressed, only 11 were up-regulated and 3 were down-regulated at all time points (Supplementary Datasets S2 and S3). Most of the genes that were up-regulated in the BLP-resistant NIL were expressed at 0 hai (Fig. 2, left); most of the genes that were down-regulated were expressed at 6 hai (Fig. 2, right). Number of gene transcripts in the BLP-resistant NIL that were up- and down-regulated [P < 0.001 and log2 (fold change) >2.0 or<-2.0] compared with the BLP-susceptible NIL. The number inside the parentheses indicates the number of genes expressed at the hours after Xag inoculation (hai).

Clustering and GO analysesClustering analysis was used to group the 2415 differentially expressed genes (P< 0.001 and fold change >2 or <-2) into clusters based on common expression patterns. Ten distinct clusters emerged reflecting the general trends and key transitional states in the BLP-resistant NIL following Xag inoculation (Fig. 3). The genes in each cluster are listed in Supplementary Dataset S4. Clusters A and C contained genes that were up-regulated from 0 to 6 hai, and then down-regulated from 6 to 12 hai (Fig. 3). The 147 genes in cluster B were consistently up-regulated from 0 to 12 hai, while the 106 genes in cluster D and 353 genes in cluster H were constitutively down-regulated. The genes in cluster D exhibited a more dramatic decrease after 6 hai compared with those in cluster H, which showed only a slight decrease after 6 hai. Genes grouped into the remaining five clusters E, F, G, I, and J were down-regulated from 0 to 6 hai, but up-regulated from 6 to 12 hai (Fig. 3).

Ten clusters were identified by K-means clustering. The pink lines indicate representative transcriptional regulators; x- and y-axes represent hours after Xag inoculation (hai) and log2 fold change [log2 (BLP-resistant NIL/BLP-susceptible NIL)], respectively.Cluster analysis of 2415 genes differentially expressed following Xag inoculation.

The pink lines indicate representative transcriptional regulators; x- and y-axes represent hours after Xag inoculation (hai) and log2 fold change [log2 (BLP-resistant NIL/BLP-susceptible NIL)], respectively.Annotation of the 1978 up-regulated and 783 down-regulated genes was carried out based on the identification of conserved PFAM domains (Supplementary Dataset S4). Within the group of 1978 up-regulated genes, there were 2268 PFAMs assigned; within the 783 down-regulated genes, 824 PFAMs were identified. PFAM domains were converted into GO-identities (IDs) using mapping to GO (http://www.geneontolgy.org). Since some of the genes were assigned to multiple PFAMs, the total number of GO IDs was greater than that of PFAM assignments, and these GO IDs could be assigned to multiple GO terms (Table 2). Based on GO terms,38 there were 3494 up-regulated and annotated genes in the BLP-resistant NIL following Xag inoculation. The genes were classified as follows: 1152 genes mapped to biological process terms; 311 genes mapped to cellular component terms; and 2031 genes mapped to molecular function terms (Table 2). Among the 1047 down-regulated and annotated genes, 326 mapped to biological process terms; 105 mapped to cellular component terms; and 616 mapped to molecular function terms. In addition to metabolic processes, genes related to biological regulation, establishment of localization, response to stimulus, and signalling process were highly expressed within the biological process category. Most of the genes categorized under molecular function were involved in binding and catalytic activity (Table 2). Since many of the genes that mapped to biological process terms, particularly ‘response to stimulus’, were differentially expressed, plant resistance genes involved in responses to stimuli were closely evaluated using the database.9,10 The ‘response to stimulus’ group (GO:0050896) comprised 7.90 and 3.07% of all of the up-regulated and down-regulated genes, respectively, within the biological process category (Table 2).

Expression of plant resistance genesBecause of the limited information available for mapping Glyma PFAMs to GO terms, defence response genes (GO:0006952) were further analysed by sequence comparisons with the corresponding Arabidopsis protein sequences using a threshold of <e-100. Based on BLASTP analysis of the defence response genes, 134 putative defence response genes in Glycine max exhibited significant differences in expression between the BLP-susceptible and BLP-resistant NILs following Xag inoculation (Supplementary Dataset S5). Interactions between plant and pathogen were probed by analysing the transcript levels of PRRs, ETI receptors, and jasmonic acid (JA)- and salicylic acid (SA)-related proteins that were differentially expressed in the BLP-susceptible and BLP-resistant NILs.In plants, there are two types of immunity to bacterial pathogens, PTI and ETI (Fig. 4). Stimulation of PRRs is a key step in the early stages of PTI. Based on BLASTP searches, Glyma05g25830 and Glyma08g08810, close homologues of flagellin sensing 2 (FLS2) and EF-Tu receptor (EFR) in G. max, were identified as highly expressed at 0 hai in the BLP-resistant NIL compared with the BLP-susceptible NIL (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S2A).

Darker colours indicate higher transcript levels.Respiratory burst oxidase homologue (RBOH) is an important factor in the production of reactive oxygen species during the plant response to abiotic and biotic stresses.42,43 Changes in the expression levels of G. max RBOHA-, C-, D-, and F-like genes in response to Xag inoculation were assessed (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S2B). Three soybean genes (Glyma03g39610, Glyma19g42220, and Glyma20g38000) with homology to RBOH exhibited low level expression in the BLP-susceptible NIL at 0 hai. In the BLP-resistant NIL, transcript levels were relatively higher, with a slight reduction at 6 hai; the level of these three transcripts was markedly increased at 12 hai.Calcium is an essential second messenger in the signal transduction pathways that regulate plant responses.42,43 The expression levels of G. max Ca2+-ATPase 4 (ACA4)- and ACA11-like genes were much higher than any other defence-related genes (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S2C). In particular, the expression levels of Glyma01g40130 and Glyma11g05190 in the BLP-resistant NIL were extremely high at 0 hai relative to the BLP-susceptible NIL.Genes involved in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling cascade are downstream components in PTI42,43 (Fig. 4). Interestingly, the expression of G. max MAP kinase (MPK) 4- and MPK6-like genes was higher in the BLP-resistant NIL at 0 hai (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S2D). High expression of damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP)-related plasma membrane LRR receptor kinase 1 (PEPR1) and PEPR2 homologues in G. max was observed in the BLP-resistant NIL at 0 hai (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S2E), suggesting that DAMPs for eliciting PAMP downstream may also be involved in BLP resistance.The second type of stress perception in plants involves recognition of pathogen virulence molecules called effectors by specific plant intracellular receptors, or ETI. To investigate the role of ETI in BLP resistance, R gene sequences were collected from the Plant Resistance Gene database (PRGdb, http://prgdb.cbm.fvg.it).44 Expression of several corresponding G. max genes, including RPP1-, 4- and 5-, RPM1-, beet cyst nematode Heterodera schachtii Schmidt resistance gene (HS1PRO-1)- and mildew-resistance locus O (MLO)-like genes was induced following Xag inoculation (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S3). Of the six RPP-like genes surveyed, Glyma06g40690, Glyma06g40950, and Glyma06g40980 exhibited significantly higher expression levels than three other genes regardless of time points or NILs. Furthermore, these three genes were the most highly expressed in the resistant NIL at 0 hai (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S3A). Expression of Glyma16g10340 in the susceptible NIL increased steadily after Xag inoculation, whereas in the resistant NIL, expression was reduced, with the highest level of expression observed at 0 hai.Three gene transcripts encoding RPM1-like genes, Glyma06g46810 (3e-136), Glyma06g46830 (5e-138), and Glyma09g34360 (9e-118), were identified by BLASTP searches using Arabidopsis RPM1. These genes had the lowest e-values, and the differences in expression of these three genes between the NILs was considerable (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S3B). In the susceptible NIL, there were very low levels of Glyma06g46810, Glyma06g46830, and Glyma09g34360, whereas transcript levels were quite high in the resistant NIL, particularly for Glyma06g46810 at 0 and 12 hai. The transcript levels of Glyma06g46830 and Glyma09g34360 were lower than that of Glyma06g46810, but the pattern of expression of Glyma06 g46830 was similar to Glyma06g46810. The expression of Glyma09g34360 increased hours after Xag infection in the resistant NIL (Supplementary Fig. S3B).Three G. max genes (Glyma11g35050, Glyma14g06640, and Glyma18g03310) with homology to HS1PRO-1 were identified after a BLASTP search against the Arabidopsis database (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S3C). The expression of these three genes was lower in the susceptible NIL compared with the resistant NIL. Glyma14g06640 expression was highest in the resistant NIL at 0 hai, then was decreased at 6 hai and increased again at 12 hai. The pattern of expression of Glyma18g03310 was similar to that of Glyma14g06640, but it was expressed to lower levels compared with Glyma14g06640 (Supplementary Fig. S3C).Of particular interest, Glyma03g33660, Glyma16g26100, and Glyma19g36370 were highly similar to MLO, which indicated that the functions of plant resistance genes may be conserved across species (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S3D). Glyma03g33660 was dramatically increased in the resistant NIL at 6 hai compared with 0 hai, but was subsequently decreased at 12 hai. Although the transcript levels of Glyma19g36370 were much lower than Glyma03g33660, the pattern of expression of the two genes was similar. Glyma16g26100 remained elevated by at least 3-fold from 6 to 12 hai in the resistant NIL. The levels of expression of Glyma16g26100 and Glyma19g36370 were very low in the susceptible NIL (Supplementary Fig. S3D).WRKY33, LOX1, SYP121, SYP122, MYC2, and pathogenesis-related (PR) genes have been implicated in plant immune responses to pathogen attacks. WRKY transcription factors (TFs) play important roles in plant immune systems in response to abiotic and biotic stress,45,46 and are involved at various points in the signalling pathways that regulate these responses (Fig. 4). Glycine max genes containing WRKY domains were selected in the search for conserved PFAM domain (PF03106). The expression of two WRKY33 TFs, Glyma02g39870 and Glyma14g38010, increased steadily following Xag inoculation in the BLP-susceptible NIL, and both genes were expressed at higher levels in the resistant NIL compared with the susceptible NIL at all time points. There was a large difference in expression between the NILs at 0 hai, with the highest level of Glyma14g38010 observed at 0 hai in the BLP-resistant NIL (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S4A).Three G. max homologues of lipoxygenase 1 (LOX1) were identified (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S4B). In the BLP-susceptible NIL, transcript levels of Glyma07g03920 and Glyma13g31280 were low at 0 hai, increased at 6 hai and then subsequently decreased at 12 hai. The expression of Glyma07g03920 in the BLP-resistant NIL was shown a 4-fold increase in transcript levels at 6 hai relative to 0 hai and then a subsequent decrease at 12 hai. Although the expression level of Glyma08g20230 was much lower than the other two genes (Glyma07g03920 and Glyma13g31280), transcript levels were increased 6 hai in the BLP-resistant NIL (Supplementary Fig. S4B).Two soybean genes (Glyma02g35230 and Glyma10g10200) were identified by BLASTP searches for SYP121 and SYP122 homology. Expression of Glyma02g35230 and Glyma10g10200 was elevated in the BLP-resistant NIL only at 0 hai relative to the BLP-susceptible NIL (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S4C).MYC2, a bHLH TF, plays a crucial role in the JA-signalling pathway.47 Four G. max genes retrieved using Phytozome were identified: Glyma01g12740, Glyma07g05740, Glyma08g36720, and Glyma09g33730. Three of these (Glyma01g12740, Glyma08g36720, and Glyma09g33730) were highly expressed in the BLP-resistant NIL at 0 hai compared with any other time point in either NIL (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S4D).Several soybean genes related to Arabidopsis PR genes48 were retrieved using Phytozome,33 including soybean homologues to PR-1, -3, -4, -6, -12, and -14. Glyma13g32560 and Glyma15g06770 (PR-1-like G. max genes) were highly expressed in the BLP-resistant NIL at 0 hai (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S5A). Of the basic chitinase-like genes identified in G. max (PR-3 and -4 homologues), the PR-3 homologue Glyma02g04820 was highly expressed in the BLP-resistant NIL at 12 hai (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S5B and C). Of seven PR-6 G. max genes, five homologues of the proteinase inhibitor PR-6 (Glyma10g32820, Glyma10g32830, Glyma20g34810, Glyma20g34820, and Glyma20g34830) were significantly induced in the BLP-resistant NIL at 12 hai (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S5D). Expression of Glyma13g35320, a homologue of the plant defensing PR-12, was elevated 2-fold in the BLP-resistant NIL compared with the BLP-susceptible NIL at 12 hai (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S5E). Of the 11 homologues of PR-14, a lipid transfer protein, only Glyma03g04920 and Glyma18g44300 at 0 hai, Glyma18g05890 at 6 hai, and Glyma03g04960 at 0 and 12 hai were highly expressed relative to the BLP-susceptible NIL (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S5F).The SA and JA-ethylene (ET) phytohormone pathways are important regulators of defence gene expression.49,50 These pathways function downstream in PTI and ETI, and are well characterized relative to other steps in the process51–53 (Fig. 4). We examined the expression of two non-expressor of PR gene 1 (NPR1)-like genes in G. max, Glyma09g02430 and Glyma15g13320, since NPR1 is an important regulatory component in SA signalling (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S6A). In the BLP-susceptible NIL, expression of Glyma09g02430 and Glyma15g13320 started out high at 0 hai, and then increased at 6 hai before returning to pre-inoculation levels 12 hai. There were no significant differences in the expression of Glyma09g02430 and Glyma15g13320 between the NILs.Isochorismate synthase 1 (ICS1) is a key enzyme responsible for increasing SA accumulation and pathogen resistance.53,54 Overall, the expression levels of the ICS1-like G. max genes Glyma01g25690 and Glyma03g17420 were not significantly different between the two NILs (Supplementary Fig. S6B). The expression of Glyma01g25690 was increased following inoculation in the BLP-susceptible NIL, but was decreased at 6 hai in the BLP-resistant NIL relative to 0 and 12 hai. In both NILs, the expression of Glyma03g17420 was similar at 0 and 6 hai, and then increased at 12 hai.Enhanced disease susceptibility 1 (EDS1) and EDS5 were also evaluated. The expression of EDS1-like genes (Glyma04g34800, Glyma06g19920, Glyma06g19890, and Glyma06g19900) and EDS5-like genes (Glyma11g11970 and Glyma11g11990) was similar in both NILs (Supplementary Fig. S6C and D). Thus, there were no major differences in the expression of SA signalling genes between the BLP-susceptible and BLP-resistant NILs.JA functions as an antagonist of SA in plant hormone pathways, and several Arabidopsis genes involved in JA signalling pathways have been identified.55 Soybean homologues of jasmonate resistant 1 (JAR1), an enzyme that catalyses the conjugation of JA to isoleucine,56 and coronate insensitive 1 (COI1), a jasmonate receptor,57 were not significantly expressed between the NILs (Supplementary Fig. S7A and B). Jasmonate ZIM-motif (JAZ) proteins bind to TFs such as MYC2 and control a variety of jasmonate-mediated responses, including defence gene expression and growth responses to wounding.58,59 The expression of JAZ3- and JAZ4-like genes was unchanged at both time points after inoculation (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S7D and E). Expression of four other JAZ-like proteins, JAZ1, JAZ6, JAZ8, and JAZ12, was significantly elevated at 0 hai in the BLP-resistant NIL; of these genes, JAZ1 was the most highly expressed (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S7C, F–H).3.6. Validation of RNA-Seq results by qRT–PCRqRT–PCR was used to validate several of the differentially expressed genes identified by RNA-Seq in the BLP-susceptible and BLP-resistant NILs. Nine genes involved in defence mechanisms, including PTI and ETI (Fig. 6), were evaluated: Glyma08g08810 (EFR and FLS2), Glyma01g40130 (ACA4 and 11), Glyma11g15700 (MPK4 and 6), Glyma06g09520 (PEPR1 and 2), Glyma06g40980 (RPP1, 4 and 5), Glyma14g06640 (HS1PRO-1), Glyma14g38010 (WRKY33), Glyma15g19840 (JAZ1), and Glyma09g33730 (MYC2), all of which were shown by RNA-Seq analysis to be up-regulated at 0 hai in the BLP-resistant NIL compared with the BLP-susceptible NIL. The primer sets used for qRT–PCR are listed in Supplementary Table S2. The validation results were consistent with the gene expression patterns identified by RNA-Seq. The expression levels of Glyma11g15700 and Glyma06g09520 at 12 hai in the resistant NIL were slightly higher based on qRT–PCR than RNA-Seq. These results highlighted the fidelity and reproducibility of the RNA-Seq analysis used in the present study. Validation of RNA-Seq data by qRT–PCR. Nine PTI-, ETI-, and defence-related genes were selected for validation.Validation of RNA-Seq data by qRT–PCR. Nine PTI-, ETI-, and defence-related genes were selected for validation.4. DiscussionPlants have two main defence mechanisms that can be activated in response to microbial plant pathogens, PTI and ETI9,10 (Fig. 4). PAMPs trigger an influx of calcium ions and an oxidative burst in the early stage of infection. This is followed by activation of MAPK and calcium-dependent protein kinase, and stomatal closure and transcriptional reprogramming in the intermediate stage. Finally, SA accumulation and callose deposition occur in the late stage of infection.42,43 Plant pathogenic bacteria, including Xanthomonas, deliver effector proteins into host cells via a TTSS to promote parasitism.11,12 These bacterial effectors are recognized directly or indirectly by specific R genes, leading to the gene-for-gene theory of ETI.60 Specific recognition of pathogen effectors leads to the induction of disease resistance and HR.13,14In the current study, plant immune responses triggered by the interaction of soybean with the plant pathogen Xag were investigated. The expression patterns of PTI- and ETI-related genes in response to Xag infection in BLP-susceptible and BLP-resistant NILs were compared using RNA-Seq. Most of the genes related to PTI were up-regulated at 0 hai in the BLP-resistant NIL relative to the BLP-susceptible NIL (Figs 2 and 5). EFR- and FLS2-like genes, as putative PAMP receptors, were highly expressed at 0 hai (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S2A). Of note, key PTI genes triggered by PAMPs, such as ACA4, ACA11, MPK4, MPK6, and RBOH genes, were highly expressed in the BLP-resistant NIL at 0 hai (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S2B–D). Recently, the first DAMP receptors (PEPR1 and PEPR2) were identified by virtue of their ability to recognize AtPep1,61 DAMPs are involved in the activation of plant immune responses, and include polysaccharides released from the cell wall and cuticular fragments, as well as some endogenous peptides.62,63 The expression of PEPR1 and 2 in soybean differed significantly in the BLP-resistant and BLP-susceptible NILs at 0 hai (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S2E). Based on expression patterns, the PTI-related genes (EFR-, FLS2-, RBOH-, ACA4-, ACA11-, MPK4-, and MPK6-like G. max genes) and DAMP receptors (PEPR1- and 2-like G. max genes) were grouped into clusters H and I (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Dataset 4). The up-regulation of PTI-related genes at 0 hai could potentiate the immune reaction to pathogen attack. Genes expressed in early stage responses, such as 0 hai, might be more important for BLP resistance than those expressed at later stages (i.e. 6 hai). This is supported by the observation that sufficient accumulation of R proteins in the initial stage of response influences effective resistance against biotrophic pathogens, demonstrated by the mildew-resistance locus A R gene in barley.64 Thus, the gene response at 0 hai may be involved in BLP resistance to Xag in the BLP-resistant NIL.Among the R genes obtained from the Plant Resistance Genes database (PRGdb),44 RPP1-, 4-, and 5-like; RPM1-like; HS1PRO-1-like; and MLO-like genes were significantly different in expression between the BLP-susceptible and BLP-resistant NILs (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S3). RPP genes trigger localized cell death in Arabidopsis upon recognition of downy mildew avirulence genes.65 The transcript levels of the three RPP genes (Glyma06g40690, Glyma06g40950, and Glyma40980) were much higher at 0 hai in the BLP-resistant NIL relative to the BLP-susceptible NIL. In Arabidopsis, RPM1 encodes an intracellular immune sensor that is induced in response to Pseudomonas syringae, and attack by this pathogen leads to the expression of RPM1 disease resistance proteins.66,67 In the BLP-resistant NIL, the expression of soybean RPM1 homologues was elevated. In sugar beet, the HS1PRO-1 gene reportedly confers resistance to the beet cyst nematode.68 Soybean homologues of HS1PRO-1 were also expressed at high levels at 0 hai in the BLP-resistant NIL. These patterns suggest that a strong surveillance system exists in the BLP-resistant NIL, and that these genes play important roles in the modulation of defence responses to biotic and abiotic stress stimuli. In contrast, MLO, which plays an important role in defence responses to biotic and abiotic stresses,69 exhibited a different pattern. The expression of G. max MLO increased hours after Xag infection. Thus, MLO might be involved downstream of the other R genes in defence response signalling pathways.Defence-related genes were analysed using the GO term ‘defence response’ (GO:0006952) (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S4). The expression of LOX1-, SYP121-, SYP122-, WRKY33-, and MYC2-like genes differed significantly between NILs. With the exception of LOX1, these genes were all grouped into cluster H or I, which consisted of genes that were up-regulated at 0 hai, down-regulated at 6 hai, and then up- or down-regulated slightly at 12 hai in the BLP-resistant NIL relative to the BLP-susceptible NIL (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Dataset 4). LOX1-mediated pathways are crucial for lipid peroxidation during plant defence responses to pathogen infection.70 An important gene for defence, SYP121 (closest homologue, PEN1), is required for the timely formation of cell wall appositions.71 These defence-related genes were highly expressed in the BLP-resistant NIL. WRKY33 expression levels were also much higher in the resistant NIL (Supplementary Fig. S4A). WRKY TFs have also been shown to be involved in plant immune responses to bacterial pathogens.45,46Plant resistance to biotrophic pathogens is thought to be controlled largely by SA-mediated signalling pathways. In contrast, resistance to necrotrophic pathogens is mediated by the JA and ET signalling pathways.54 Even though Xanthomonas is a known biotrophic pathogen, we did not observe any significant difference in the expression of SA-related genes in the NILs (Supplementary Fig. S6). However, the core JA-signalling components JAZ (JAZ1, JAZ6, and JAZ8) and MYC2 were highly expressed in the BLP-resistant NIL at 0 hai, and the expression patterns of all of these genes were very similar (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Figs S4D and S7). Up-regulation of JAZs and MYC2 related to JA-signalling was shown in the BLP-resistant NIL at 0 hai. One possibility for the elevated expression of JA signalling components may be that spraying by the atomizer was perceived as wounding. Alternatively, endogenous levels of JA may be elevated in the BLP-resistant NIL compared with the BLP-susceptible NIL. According to Chini et al.,58 JAZ genes are constitutively overexpressed in MYC2 transgenic plants in the absence of jasmonate treatment. Furthermore, JAZ genes were found to be transcriptional targets of MYC2 via negative regulation, leading to the self-repression of MYC2 in response to increased MYC2 expression levels.58 Binding of the active form of JA, JA-isoleucine, to COI1 and subsequent interaction of the complex with JAZ proteins is followed by ubiquitination by SCFCOI1 and proteasomal degradation, allowing the release of MYC2 and activation of JA responses.72 Our results are consistent with these previous studies of JA signalling pathways.Previously, QTL mapping was used to place rxp along with eight SSRs and two SNPs in the centre of chromosome 17.7 Three candidate genes for rxp, Glyma17g09770, Glyma17g09780, and Glyma17g09790, were also proposed as putative BLP resistance genes. The chromosomal position of rxp was confirmed using the same BLP-susceptible and BLP-resistant NILs used in the current study. Of note, no significant differences were observed in the expression levels of the three rxp candidate genes (Supplementary Table S3). These results could be explained by either a dilution effect or to differences in sampling time between the two studies. A strong dilution effect of mRNA from un-inoculated regions of the leaves could be avoided by laser capture microdissection (LCM), which allows the selective isolation of targeted cells from a tissue section, thereby avoiding contamination from adjacent non-infected tissue or cells.73,74 In both studies, the leaves were cut manually, not by LCM, introducing potential inconsistencies in the area of the excised leaf tissue, which may in turn result in small differences in expression levels of the candidate resistance genes. Compared with the previous QTL mapping study,7 the current study employed a different sampling schedule after Xag inoculation. There are a variety of reasons why there might be differences between the results of transcriptome analysis just hours after Xag inoculation and QTL mapping based on a BLP resistance phenotype a week after Xag inoculation. Since a change or alteration of causal genes for resistance does not necessarily mean changes at the transcript level, the instability of the translation product might be a factor. Thus, translational changes may be responsible for BLP resistance, although there were no significant differences in transcript accumulation of the candidate genes between the NILs.In conclusion, 2415 differentially expressed genes were identified in BLP-resistant and BLP-susceptible NILs following Xag inoculation. PTI-, ETI-, defence-, and hormone-related genes were identified and analysed for their potential role in plant immune reactions using the methods of clustering and GO analysis. The PAMP receptors EFR and FLS2 and PAMP-induced genes, including RBOH, ACA4, ACA11, MPK4, and MPK6, were all highly expressed in the BLP-resistant NIL at 0 hai. Furthermore, the DAMP receptors PEPR1 and PEPR2 were also highly expressed at 0 hai, supporting the idea that DAMP-induced genes are involved in BLP-resistance. These results indicate that the plant surveillance system for detecting pathogen invasion is well-established in the BLP-resistant NIL. PAMP and DAMP receptors share common pathways from the initial steps of the defence mechanism, and these two factors may be crucial in mediating BLP resistance. No significant differences were observed for several components of SA-signalling pathways, whereas core JA-signalling components such as JAZ proteins and MYC2 TFs exhibited significant differences in expression between the NILs. Although JA participates to a greater extent than SA in the BLP defence mechanism, both the JA and SA pathways are associated with PR genes and PR-mediated signalling mechanisms. Thus, the defence mechanisms involved in BLP resistance are likely to be quite complex. The current findings contribute a better understanding of plant pathogen defence responses, plant–pathogen interactions, and signal transduction pathways. TFs such as WRKY33 and MYC2 were highly expressed in the BLP-resistant NIL at 0 hai. These differentially expressed TF genes open up an interesting avenue of study into the cis- or trans-elements involved in BLP resistance using other advanced technologies such as Chip-Seq.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis research was supported by a grant from the Next-Generation BioGreen 21 Program (no.

Our data also provide evidence that the negative correlation between codon bias and recombination rates in G. gallus is determined mostly by recombination-dependent mutational patterns.1. IntroductionSynonymous codons are used with different frequencies both among species and among genes within the same genome. Highly expressed genes (such as those encoding translation elongation factors and ribosomal proteins) tend to use optimal (preferred) codons and exhibit very high levels of codon bias.1–5 The optimal codons also tend to correspond to highly expressed tRNAs and tRNA gene copy numbers.4–13 These patterns have been interpreted as natural selection for more efficient and accurate translation.6,14–18 In contrast, some studies have demonstrated that the first factor shaping codon usage is nucleotide composition (G + C content) of genes and intergenic regions.12,19–22 As G + C content is more likely determined by genome-wide processes rather than by selective forces acting specifically on coding sequence, these findings have been inferred to reflect the genome-wide patterns of codon usage by mutational biases. Based on the fact that both mutational pressures and selective forces are involved in the phenomenon of codon bias in a variety of organisms, an integrated model, known as the mutation–selection–drift balance model, has been proposed.15,23–25 This model proposes that selection favours optimal codons over minor codons, while mutational pressure and genetic drift allow the minor codons to persist.17 Population genetics has shown that the selection of codon bias is generally weak17,23,26 (|Nes| ˜ 1), therefore, selection coefficients are expected to be more efficient in species with large effective population sizes (Ne) such as prokaryotes and unicellular eukaryotes.6,27 In species with low Ne values, genetic drift should be the main force shaping codon usage and overpowering translational selection of codon variants.Codon bias has been determined to be positively correlated with recombination rates in Drosophila, as well as in many other species.28–35 This observation has been explained by two hypotheses. The first proposed that the reduction of codon bias in the regions with limited recombination is consistent with Hill–Robertson interference.28,30 However, another hypothesis, called the GC-biased gene conversion model, suggested that the correlation between recombination and codon usage patterns is caused by recombination-related mutational bias rather than by Hill–Robertson interference, as the heteroduplex DNA appears to be biased toward the preferential fixation of AT <U+2192> GC mutations.32,36 Except for nucleotide composition, gene expression and recombination rates, other additional parameters such as protein length, gene length and intron length also have been found to play an important role in shaping codon usage in a wide variety of organisms.2,5,37–39The chicken (Gallus gallus) is an important model organism that bridges the evolutionary gap between mammals and other vertebrates. The chicken karyotype comprises 39 pairs of chromosomes, which are divided into 8 pairs of cytologically distinct macro-chromosomes, Z and W sex chromosomes, and 30 pairs of micro-chromosomes.40 Compared to other vertebrate genomes, the chicken genome has many distinctive characteristics such as a smaller genome size (less than half of humans and mouse), higher recombination rates and higher G + C content.41,42 Base composition is found to vary greatly between different genomic regions in many eukaryotes. In vertebrates, such as mammalian and birds, one of the most striking features of their genomes is the variation of G + C content that occurs over scales of hundreds of kilobases to megabases, the so-called ‘isochore structure’.43,44 Although subsequent study indicated that the isochore model might need slight revision,45 it is clear that the genomes of vertebrates are highly heterogeneous in G + C content and have acquired GC-rich regions.42 This results in that a large proportion of variance in codon usage bias is explained by G + C content.20,21 Mank et al. investigated the chicken's properties of sex-biased genes (female biased genes 155, male biased genes 286) through a microarray data. They found that the codon usage of sex-biased genes showed some sex-biased effects, primarily for autosomal genes expressed in the gonad. Codon bias is greatest when GC3 (the G + C content at third coding positions) is skewed away from equal usage of GC or AT.46 Up to now, a systematic examination of the codon usage for the G. gallus genome has not been performed. In the present study, we carried out a whole analysis of the chicken genome and showed that codon bias is negatively correlated with G + C content and recombination rates, but positively correlated with tRNA abundance, gene expression, protein length, gene length and intron length. Our data clearly displayed that regional G + C content explains a large proportion of the variance of codon bias in G. gallus genome. This study will benefit our understanding of how natural selection and mutation impacts codon usage in the G. gallus genome.2. Materials and methods2.1. Sequence dataOnly nuclear genes with complete information on protein-coding sequences (CDSs) with no evidence of multiple-splicing forms were included in this study. CDSs corresponding to all annotated genes in the chicken genome were downloaded from http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/gquery and peptide information coded by the genes was derived from http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein. Some CDSs lengths are obviously not consistent with the total length of corresponding exons and these genes were defined as annotation errors and were not included for analysis. CDSs that did not begin with an ATG start codon, did not have a length of >300 bp, did not contain a multiple of three or that contained an internal stop codon were also ruled out. The final sequence collection contained 8631 CDSs with each corresponding to a unique gene in the G. gallus genome. For each gene, total gene length, protein length, first intron length and average intron length were determined.2.2. Expression datawhere N is the number of tissue samples examined, xi is the expression level of the gene in sample i and xmax is the highest expression level of the gene across the N samples examined.492.3. Identification of optimal codons and synonymous codon usageOptimal codons are defined as those that occur significantly more often in highly expressed genes relative to their frequency in lower expressed genes. We used 5% of the total genes with extremely high and low expression levels inferred from EST counts, as the high and low data set, respectively, and calculated the average RSCU (relative synonymous codon usage) of the two gene samples. RSCU was calculated by dividing the observed codon usage by that expected when all codons for the same amino acid are used equally. RSCU values close to 1.0 indicate a lack of bias. Putative optimal codons were inferred based on departures from equal codon usage by sets of loci with high and low gene expression.2,50 <U+0394>RSCU for a given codon is the difference between the average RSCU of genes with high and low expression [significance tested using the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) by SAS]. If <U+0394>RSCU is >0.1 at P< 0.05, this codon will be identified as an optimal codon. Then, we calculated Fop values using the codonW 1.4.2 program with customized optimal codon tables (J Peden, http://codonw.sourceforge.net). Fop is the ratio of optimal codons to synonymous codons, ranging from 0 (where no optimal codons are used) to 1 (where only optimal codons are used). The nucleotide composition indices including GC3 and G + C content of CDSs were also calculated using codonW 1.4.2.2.4. tRNA gene copy number dataThe tRNA gene copy numbers for each codon in the G. gallus genome was taken from http://gtrnadb.ucsc.edu/Ggall/. In these data, pseudogenes have already been removed. We used tRNA gene copy numbers as an assumed estimate of cellular tRNA abundance. The relative gene frequency (RGF) of tRNAs is the observed frequency of an isoacceptor tRNA gene in the genome divided by the frequency expected if all isoacceptor tRNA genes for that amino acid occurred with equal frequencies.112.5. Recombination rate estimationThe recombination rates for 1 Mbp windows were estimated. The versions of the genome assemblies (NCBI build 2.1, released November, 2006) and the latest chicken consensus linkage map (sex-averaged map) were used.51 This high-resolution consensus map included 9268 markers, consisting of 34 linkage groups. It enabled us to estimate the local recombination rates using a narrower region. Locations of individual markers were determined based on alignments of the full sequence of the markers using BLAST. The linear function was fitted to the points representing genetic and physical map positions in the 1 Mbp windows. The slope of this line was interpreted as an estimate of recombination rates.52 Windows were removed that contained >50% ‘N’ in the sequence assembly, as were windows at the beginning, end and centromere of chromosomes with no markers detected in them. Some windows with large discrepancies between the genetic map and the sequence assembly were also removed. A total of 745 windows were included, which covered ~70% of the chicken genome.2.6. Statistical analysisCorrelation analysis between variables was performed by SAS Proprietary Software Release 8.1. In order to assess the actual strength of association, correlation coefficients reported in this study were obtained using all genes independently and avoided the approach of subdividing genes into groups to later investigate relationships among them. The significance tests were corrected for multiple testing by the Bonferroni step-down correction.53 To determine the variables contributing to codon bias and how they may interact, we performed multiple linear regressions with the variables, excluding those not contributing significantly through the use of the t-statistical logarithm with backward stepwise regression.3. Results3.1. Putative optimal codons and tRNA abundanceA total of 8631genes were included in this study. As shown in Table 1, 11 codons have been identified as putatively optimal. Interestingly, all putative optimal codons in the chicken genome are ended by uracil (U). Previous studies suggested that the nucleotide composition (G + C content) plays an important role in the identities of optimal codons as selection for optimal codons for transcription and translation is not high enough to overcome compositional skews.12,20,21 Base composition is found to vary greatly between different genomic regions in many eukaryotes. In vertebrates, such as mammalian and birds, one of the most striking features of their genomes is the variation of G + C content that occurs over scales of hundreds of kilobases to megabases.43,44 In order to further test whether the G + C content had a significant effect on the identities of optimal codons in the G. gallus genome, we produced a high G + C content sample (20% of the highest G + C content of the CDSs) and a low G + C content sample (20% of the lowest G + C content of the CDSs) and inferred the optimal codons by the use of the <U+0394>RSCU method as described above. For the low G + C content sample, 11 codons were identified as optimal and 9 overlapped with the result of the whole data analysis, lacking the alanine (coded by CGU), the threonine (coded by ACU), plus the glutamine (coded by CAG) and the threonine (coded by ACA). For high G + C content sample, 13 codons were identified as optimal and among them, 10 codons overlapped with the result of the whole data analysis, lacking only the cysteine (coded by UGU), plus the phenylalanine (coded by UUU), the serine (coded by UCA) and the proline (coded by CCG, see additional files, Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). The analyses of samples of high and low G + C content revealed that G + C content of CDS has a significant effect on the identities of the optimal codons in the chicken genome. However, it should be noted that most putative optimal codons (9–10 codons) occurred coincidently in three samples. We believe that large samples can give more accurate estimates and, therefore, the codon bias (Fop, the ratio of optimal codons to synonymous codons) estimate next was based on the putatively optimal codons identified by the whole data set of 8631 genes. The putative optimal codons and tRNA abundancePutative optimal codons were inferred based on departures from equal codon usage by sets of loci with high (5% top) and low (5% down) gene expression (<U+25B5>RSCU). <U+25B5>RSCU for a given codon is the difference between the average RSCU of genes with high and low expression (significance tested using the one-way ANOVA). If <U+25B5>RSCU is >0.1 at P< 0.05, this codon will be identified as optimal codon. Total optimal codons identified in this study are 11. The transfer RNA gene (tRNA) copy numbers for each codon was taken from http://gtrnadb.ucsc.edu/Ggall/. There is a good correspondence between tRNA abundance and optimal codons within codon classes. However, the above correlation reflects only partially the real co-adaptation of tRNA abundance and codon usage, as the same tRNA can decode several codons. Since we have no experimental data on base modifications in Gallus gallus tRNAs, we predicted the codons decoded by the different anticodons according to the ‘parsimony of wobbling’ criterion. The putative optimal codons with <U+25B5>RSCU is >0.1 at P< 0.05 and <U+25B5>RSCU >0.2 at P< 0.05 are denoted by ‘*’ and ‘**’, respectively.The putative optimal codons and tRNA abundancePutative optimal codons were inferred based on departures from equal codon usage by sets of loci with high (5% top) and low (5% down) gene expression (<U+25B5>RSCU). <U+25B5>RSCU for a given codon is the difference between the average RSCU of genes with high and low expression (significance tested using the one-way ANOVA). If <U+25B5>RSCU is >0.1 at P< 0.05, this codon will be identified as optimal codon. Total optimal codons identified in this study are 11.

Previous studies suggested that the most abundant tRNA for a given amino acid is predominantly recruited by the codons of highly expressed genes.54 The optimal codons are most likely the ones corresponding to the most abundant and efficient cognate aa-tRNAs present in the cell.7,13 This trend also existed in the human genome but with lower coefficient.55–57 We conducted an analysis to test whether this trend also exists in the chicken genome. As tRNA gene copy numbers are generally correlated with cellular levels of tRNAs in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes,9,58,59 we used the abundance of tRNA genes as a substitute for the levels of tRNAs in the cell. We found that there is a good correspondence between tRNA abundance and optimal codons within codon classes (see Table 1). We also computed the RGF of each isoacceptor tRNA and made a regression analysis between the RGF and RSCU in highly expressed genes and lesser expressed genes. As shown in Fig. 1, there is a significant correlation between RGF and the RSCU of complementary codons in highly expressed genes (r = 0.4599, P= 0.0013). This positive trend also existed in lesser expressed genes, but with a lower correlation coefficient (r = 0.3548, P= 0.0121). Scatter plots of RGF versus RSCU. The RGF of tRNA genes is the observed frequency of an isoacceptor tRNA gene in Gallus gallus genome divided by the frequency expected if all isoacceptor tRNA genes for that amino acid were equally frequent in the genome. The RSCU is the observed frequency of a codon divided by the frequency expected if all synonyms for that amino acid were used equally. (a) RSCU was measured in the highly expressed genes and (b) RSCU was measured in the lowly expressed genes.Scatter plots of RGF versus RSCU.

(a) RSCU was measured in the highly expressed genes and (b) RSCU was measured in the lowly expressed genes.3.2. Relationships between codon bias and GC3, G + C content of CDSs and G + C content of intronic sequencesCodon bias, measured as Fop, averaged 0.2560 ± 0.0042 (ranging from 0.0100 to 0.6183) across the 8631 genes in the G. gallus genome. The Fop values for genes residing on the macro-chromosomes, micro-chromosomes and Z chromosome are 0.2736 ± 0.0011, 0.2236 ± 0.0015 and 0.2992 ± 0.0032, respectively. There is a significant difference among them (P< 0.0001, using the one-way ANOVA). This means that genes residing on the Z chromosome have the highest codon bias. The reasons for this significant difference is most likely owing to the different G + C content, CpG island motifs, gene density and recombination rates of the three types of chromosomes.Regression analysis demonstrated that Fop is highly correlated with GC3 and G + C content of CDSs, respectively (r = -0.8308, P< 0.0001; r = -0.8264, P< 0.0001, see Fig. 2a and b). It appears that variation in GC mutational bias explains over 60% of the variation of the codon usage bias. This negative correlation is expected, as all putative optimal codons inferred in this study ended with U. We also retrieved all intronic sequences for each gene and provided the combined length of all introns for a particular gene exceeding 200 bp and calculated the G + C content of the intronic sequences. We found that Fop values also negatively correlated with the G + C content of the intronic sequences significantly (r = -0.5399, P< 0.0001, see Fig. 2c). Scatter plots of GC3, G + C content of coding sequences, G + C content of intronic sequences versus the frequency of optimal codons (Fop). Total gene included is 8631.

Relationships between codon bias and gene expressionWe assessed the effect of expression levels and expression breadth on codon usage bias in our samples. Our data demonstrated that codon bias is positively correlated with gene expression levels (r = 0.1735, P< 0.0001). The correlation between codon bias and expression breadth was also positive and significant (r = 0.1982, P< 0.0001, see Fig. 3a and b). These results suggest that the genes with broader expression breadth and higher expression levels show a higher degree of codon usage bias. Total gene expression is known to be highly influenced by the number of different tissues where a gene is expressed (expression breadth) when expression data are calculated from pooled EST libraries.60,61 If expression breadth is the predominant force affecting codon usage, a spurious correlation between codon bias and gene expression is more likely to be generated. In order to alleviate this problem, we divided genes into ubiquitously or narrowly expressed groups, if they were expressed in =15 tissues or =3 tissues. We regressed expression levels on codon bias for each group, and found that this significant trend also existed for the ubiquitous group (r = 0.1855, P= 0.0016) and for narrowly expressed groups (r = 0.0497, P= 0.0101). When the parameters were expanded to =16 or =2, we obtained similar results. Scatter plots of Fop versus expression level, expression breadth and the tissue specificity index t. Expression data on 8631 genes for 18 tissues, blood, brain, bursa of fabricius, cecum, connective tissue, embryonic tissue, epiphyseal growth plate, gonad, head, heart, limb, liver, muscle, ovary, pancreas, spleen, testis and thymus, were taken into account. Expression level is defined as the total expression level of a gene, which is the sum of the total 18 tissues' EST (transformed to logarithm with base 10). Expression breadth defined as the numbers of tissues in which EST was found. The calculation of t can be seen from materials and methods.

(a) Fop versus expression level; (b) Fop versus expression breadth and (c) Fop versus the tissue specificity index t.The tissue specificity index t measures both qualitative and quantitative variations of expression levels amongst tissues.49 Obviously, t is more representative than the expression breadth and expression levels alone for the expression pattern of a gene. We calculated the tissue specificity index t for each gene, and made regression analyses between codon bias and the tissue specificity index t. As shown in Fig. 3c, codon bias is significantly correlated with the tissue specificity index t (r = -0.1660, P< 0.0001).3.4. Relationships between codon bias and protein, gene and intron lengthOur data demonstrated that codon bias is significantly and positively correlated with protein length (r = 0.2358, P< 0.0001) and gene length (r = 0.2256, P< 0.0001, Fig. 4a and b). Since protein length and expression levels displayed a strong correlation with codon bias,48 we tested whether the correlation between protein length and codon bias can be explained by gene expression levels. We fitted linear models of protein length and codon bias against expression levels. The results from these models correlated at the same levels as uncorrected protein lengths and codon bias. In the narrowly expressed gene samples as described above (breadth is three or less than three tissues), we conducted a regression analysis between codon bias and protein length at similar expression levels (EST counts ranging from 57 to 60) and found that the positive trend also existed (r = 0.2823, P< 0.0001). The negative correlation between codon usage and protein length and gene length has been observed in many organisms, such as yeast, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, Arabidopsis thaliana, Populus tremula and Silene latifolia.5,29,36,62–64 However, the positive correlation identified in this study has been found only in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli, and was been explained through the model of selection on translational accuracy.37,65Scatter plots of Fop versus protein length, gene length, average intron length and first intron length (logarithmically transformed).

(a) Fop versus protein length; (b) Fop versus gene length; (c) Fop versus average intron length and (d) Fop versus first intron length.As shown in Fig. 4c and d, codon bias also shows a positive correlation with average intron length and first intron length (r = 0.2337, P< 0.0001; r = 0.1806, P< 0.0001, respectively). The opposite trend has been found in D. melanogaster, C. elegans and P. tremula.5,66,67 This positive trend between codon bias and intron length has been only found in unicellular organisms;68 however, the underlying mechanism for this is not clear. Stoletzki and Eyre-Walker69 and Stoletzki70 suggested that this trend (negative/positive) is related to whose optimal codons are biased towards codons that end with GC or AU. We found that the G + C content of introns is significantly and negatively correlated with average intron length and first intron length (r = -0.4024, P< 0.0001; r = -0.2432, P< 0.0001, respectively). Obviously, the positive trend between codon bias and intron length is related to the G + C content of intronic sequences. If mutation bias is the driving force of the codon usage in the G. gallus genome, the mutation bias hypotheses seems reasonable to explain this result.3.5. Relationship between codon bias and recombination rateFig. 5 shows that there is a negative correlation between the Fop values and the local recombination rates (r = -0.4546, P< 0.0001). We also found that the relationship between codon usage bias and recombination rate is independent of the expression levels and protein length (data not shown). This significant trend seems to be expected, since the mutagenic effects of recombination result in a mutational bias toward G and C bases in regions of high recombination rates (GC-biased gene conversion). Scatter plots of Fop versus recombination rate. The recombination rates for 1 Mb windows were estimated. The versions of the genome assemblies (NCBI build 2.1, released November, 2006) and the latest chicken consensus linkage map were used.

For each window, the average Fop for all genes residing in this window was calculated.Scatter plots of Fop versus recombination rate. The recombination rates for 1 Mb windows were estimated.

The identities of optimal codons in the G. gallus genomeIn the present study, we carried out a systematic examination of the codon usage in the chicken genome. By the use of the <U+0394>RSCU method, we identified 11 codons as putatively optimal. All putative optimal codons in the chicken genome end with U. This is significantly departing from the pattern observed in other eukaryotes genomes, such as Schizosaccharomyces pombe, D. melanogaster, C. elegans and Homo sapiens. The rules governing the identities of optimal codons in different organisms remain obscure. Recently, Hershberg and Petrov21 investigated the optimal codons in 675 bacteria, 52 archea and 10 fungi. They found that across all studied organisms, the identities of optimal codons mirrors the G + C content of the genomes. GC-rich organisms tend to have GC-rich optimal codons, while AT-rich organisms tend to have AT-rich optimal codons. However, in Drosophila, C. elegance and Populus tremula, most optimal codons end with G or C (majority are C ending), while their genomes contain 35, 36 and 45% G + C-rich content, respectively.5,71,72 In humans, optimal codons seem to be driven in two opposite directions, toward AT richness and GC richness. In other words, genes in the GC-rich regions of the genome preferentially use G and C ending codons, while those in the AT-rich regions use A and T ending codons.73 The human genome comprises a mosaic of long stretches of GC-rich and AT-rich regions, the so-called isochore structure. Not only do they occur in silent sites of coding regions but also introns and flanking regions in the gene have a similar base composition.43 This isochore structure was also found in the avian genomes.41 Recently, some studies have suggested that the G + C content is becoming homogenized in humans.45,55 However, Webster et al.42 found that heterogeneity in the G + C content is being reinforced in the chicken genome. In order to test whether the G + C content influences the identities of optimal codons in G. gallus, we produced a high G + C content sample (20% of the highest G + C content of the CDSs) and a low G + C content sample (20% of the lowest G + C content of the CDSs), and inferred the optimal codons by the use of the <U+0394>RSCU method. We found that most putative optimal codons (9–10 codons) occur coincidently in three samples. Using the abundance of tRNA genes as a substitute for the levels of tRNAs in the cell, we found that there is a good correspondence between tRNA abundance and optimal codons within codon classes. This implies that the optimal codons in the chicken genome are most likely the ones corresponding to the highly expressed tRNAs or tRNA gene copy numbers in the cell.4.2. Mutation bias is the driving force of the codon usage in the G. gallus genomeCodon bias, as measured by Fop, is significantly correlated with GC3, G + C content of CDS and G + C content of the intronic sequences. Our data clearly displayed that regional G + C content explains a large proportion of the variance of codon bias in chicken. Our data also provide strong evidence for the mutational bias hypothesis. However, we found that the G + C content of the intronic sequences is significantly lower than that of CDSs, which are not fully consistent with this hypothesis, as it predicts that G + C content is determined by genome-wide processes rather than by selective forces acting specifically on coding regions. It also should be noted that although the G + C content of intronic sequences show a negative trend with codon usage, the correlation is significantly lower than that between codon usage and G + C content of CDSs. These findings indicate that, except for mutation bias, other factors (such as selection) may have contribution to the codon usage.Our data also show that codon bias is significantly and positively correlated with gene expression. The positive correlations between gene expression and codon bias have been shown in many organisms.1–2,4–5 In vertebrates such as mammals, data also support a weak relationship between gene expression and codon usage.56,61 Both the match between tRNA abundance and optimal codons, and the high codon bias of the highly expressed genes, has been interpreted as natural selection for more efficient and accurate translation.14–18 Our data provide evidence that natural selection also plays an important role in shaping the codon usage in the chicken genome.Codon bias also shows a significant trend with protein length, intron length and recombination rate. To determine what all variables (G + C content of CDS, expression level, expression breadth, protein length, intron length and recombination rate) were contributing to the differences in codon bias and how they may interact, we performed multiple linear regressions with the above variables, excluding those not contributing significantly through the use of the t-statistical analysis and with backward stepwise regression. The best combinations of variables were G + C content of CDSs and expression breadth (R2 = 0.7829, P< 0.0001). Stepwise selection model analyses indicated that the G + C content of CDSs are the most important factor responsible for codon bias (R2 = 0.6831, P< 0.0001). It appears that variation in the G + C content of CDSs explains over 60% of the variation of codon bias. Recently, a continuous-time Markov chain model to quantify the contribution of GC-biased synonymous substitution on codon usage was developed by Palidwor et al.73 Although many other important factors such as selection, GC skew, did not included in their model, it also provided an informative clue to understand the mechanism of codon usage across a broad variety of organisms. This model indicated that GC bias is the dominant factor in determining codon bias for prokaryotes, plants and human. In the present study, our data suggested that both mutation bias and selection contributed to the codon bias. This seems to be consistent with the few studies in other vertebrates such as Xenopus laevis and fishes of Cyprinidae.74–75 However, it should be noticed that mutation bias is the driving force of the codon usage in the G. gallus genome.4.3. The negative association between codon bias and recombination in G. gallus is determined by recombination-dependent mutational patternsIn contrast to D. melanogaster and C. elegans, a negative correlation between codon bias and local recombination rates was found in the chicken genome. The positive pattern in D. melanogaster and C. elegans has been interpreted by Hill–Robertson effects (hitchhiking and background selection)28,29 or by recombination-dependent mutational patterns (gene conversion).32,36 The C. elegans has 21 optimal codons, of which 16 end in G or C bases, and D. melanogaster has 22 optimal codons, of which 21 end in G or C bases. Marais et al. demonstrated that, in C. elegans, the frequency of GC-ending optimal codons (Fop-GC) increases with recombination rate, whereas the frequency of AU-ending optimal codons (Fop-AU) decreases with recombination rate. In Drosophila, the frequency of AU-ending non-optimal codons (Fnop-AU) decreases with recombination rate, whereas the frequency of GC ending non-optimal codons (Fnop-GC) increases with recombination rate.32 In yeasts, about 60% of the optimal codons end by GC, an overall positive correlation is also observed between recombination rate and Fop. However, there is a strong negative correlation between Fop-AU and recombination rate.35 Marais and Piganeau32 suggested that the positive correlation between the frequency of optimal codons and recombination rates in C. elegans and D. melanogaster is not due to improved selection but to a mutational bias toward G and C bases in regions of high recombination rates (GC-biased gene conversion). If mutation bias variation patterns do occur, they should affect all base positions within the gene, including coding and non-coding sequences. We surely found this positive trend between recombination rate and G + C content of introns in the chickens (r = 0.2467, P< 0.0001). The mutational bias explanation seems to be the case in G. gallus. As 11 putative optimal codons identified in this study all ended in U, a negative association between codon bias and recombination rate is expected.Another question that should be addressed is whether the correlation between the codon usage bias and recombination rate in G. gallus is a direct consequence of the recombination process. Based on the chicken consensus linkage map,51 we selected some chromosome centromere region (chromosome 1–13, chromosome 17, chromosome 23, chromosome 25, chromosome 28 and chromosome Z), and some non-centromere regions where the estimated recombination rate is null (chromosome 1: 96.4173–99.0780 Mbp and 102.5560–105.82 39 Mbp; chromosome 2: 24.8946–27.1233 Mbp; chromosome 3: 62.328–65.3834 and 91.8723–93.5081 Mbp; chromosome 4: 20.8076–22.4734 and 72.3143–75.3621 and, 76.1848–79.2 626 Mbp; chromosome 5: 31.8527–33.3023 Mbp; 33.3360–35.0246 Mbp; chromosome 6: 13.24 26–16.2627 Mbp; chromosome 7: 8.8062–11.1527 Mbp; chromosome 8: 11.7298–12.7 581 Mbp; chromosome 19: 7.8870–8.84 82 Mbp; chromosome 20: 7.1329–8.3848 Mbp), and compared their G + C content of CDSs, G + C content of introns with those of the top recombination regions (same number of intervals on the same chromosome were selected). Although the recombination rates are likely to vary in different populations, the above non-centromere regions have been identified in that no recombination occurred in a outbreed chicken population established from a crossbreeding between a Xinghua line and a White Recessive Rock line by a high-density SNP microarray (556 individuals, unpublished data). We found that the G + C content of CDSs at the high recombination regions (0.5164 ± 0.0056) is significantly higher than that of the regions incurring no recombination (0.4695 ± 0.0056; P < 0.0001, t-test). The G + C content of introns of genes residing in the high recombination regions (0.4489 ± 0.0061) is also significantly higher than that of regions having no recombination(0.3912 ± 0.0044; P< 0.0001, t-test). This implies that the correlation between codon usage bias and recombination rates in G. gallus is determined predominantly by recombination-dependent mutational patterns. However, this does not mean that selection did not act on the synonymous sites. It is more likely that their impact on codon usage has been masked by variations in mutation pressures associated with the high recombination rates in chickens.4. ConclusionIn this whole genome analysis of the chicken, we identified 11 putative optimal codons, which all ended with U. There is a good correspondence between tRNA abundance and optimal codons within codon classes. Codon bias is negatively correlated with G + C content and recombination rates, but positively correlated with gene expression, protein length and intron length. The G + C content of coding sequences are the most important factors responsible for codon bias. It appears that variation in the G + C content of CDSs explains over 60% of the variation of codon bias. Our study suggests that both mutation bias and selection contribute to the codon bias. However, mutation bias is the driving force of the codon usage in the G. gallus genome. Our data also provide evidence that the negative correlation between codon bias and recombination rates in G. gallus is determined predominantly by recombination-dependent mutational patterns.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by the Science and Technology Program of Jiangxi Education Department, Project No. GJJ8469, and the High Tech Program (863), China, Project No. 2006AA10A120.We thank three reviewers for their helpful comments on the manuscript.Supplementary data"

IntroductionTranscriptome reflects the subset of genes from the genome that are functionally active in a selected tissue and species of interest.1,2 Since transcriptome analysis is of growing importance, research in the field has been a key area of biological inquiry for past decades and has made great progress.2 An expressed sequence tag (EST) is a short subsequence of a transcribed cDNA sequence.3 ESTs can be used to identify gene transcripts and are instrumental in gene discovery.4 Cloning and sequencing of ESTs are also an effective approach for the recovery of full-length cDNA, discovery of novel genes and development of molecular markers.5–8 Large-scale EST data represent a snapshot of the transcriptome of an organism. Since ESTs are important genomic resources, their numbers in public databases are rapidly increasing.Fish involving >30 000 species9 offer unique systems for studies of transcriptomics, genomics and evolutionary biology. So far, some assembled genome sequences of fish species (e.g. fugu, medaka, stickleback, tetraodon, zebrafish and tilapia) are available in the public databases, and more genome sequencing projects are ongoing. Only in a few fish species (e.g. zebrafish,10 salmon,11,12 trout,13 catfish,14 gilthead seabream,15 European seabass,16 Atlantic halibut,17 cod18), transcriptomes were characterized based on large EST data. A few comparative transcriptomic studies were carried out among fish species (e.g. catfish19 and carp20). These studies have dramatically expanded the biological data available across these species and provided a starting point for detailed studies on functional genomics.The Asian seabass (Lates calcarifer Bloch, 1790), also known as Barramundi, is widely distributed in the Indo-West Pacific region.21 This fish is of large commercial importance and extensively used for aquaculture.21 Currently, a number of genomic tools have been developed in Asian seabass. These include a large number of microsatellites,21–23 a genetic linkage map,24,25 a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library,26 a physical map based on BAC fingerprinting,27 some ESTs related to immune responses,28 microRNAs29 and quantitative trait loci for growth30 and an adaptive trait.31 So far, the EST resource of the Asian seabass presented in the public NCBI dbEST database has grown to over 8000 ESTs (5637 ESTs from the brain32 and 2887 immune-related ESTs from the spleen28). However, to date, the large-scale EST data for the Asian seabass are lacking.In order to expand our knowledge of the transcriptome, facilitate future whole-genome sequence assembly and annotation in the Asian seabass and enable a comparison of transcriptomes among fish species, we sequenced ESTs from nine normalized cDNA libraries of the Asian seabass and obtained 11 431 high-quality ESTs. We analyzed 19 975 ESTs including 8524 ESTs from dbEST database using bioinformatic tools and examined the expression patterns of immune-related genes after challenge with a pathogen Vibrio harveyi.2. Materials and methods2.1. Fish and samplingTo construct full-length cDNA libraries, five individuals at the age of 90 days post-hatch (dph) with an average body weight of 48.7 ± 21.6 g were used. The fish were kept under the standard hatchery conditions.33 Tissue samples of the gill, brain, muscle, liver, heart, spleen, eye, intestine and kidney of the five individuals were collected, immersed in Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA) and stored at -80°C until use.To explore the temporal and spatial expression patterns of the immune-related genes in Asian seabass challenged with a bacterium V. harveyi which is a significant pathogen of marine vertebrates and invertebrates,34 30 individuals at the age of 90 dph with an average body weigh of 35.0 ± 2.68 g were transferred to two tanks holding 200 l of seawater at the fish facility of the Temasek Life Sciences Laboratory. For 15 fishes in the test tank, each fish was injected intraperitoneally with 0.1 ml of V. harveyi (~e10 copy/ml) in phosphate-buffered saline as described in Xia et al.29 In the control tank, each of the 15 fishes received an intraperitoneal injection of 0.1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. Three fishes from each tank were sacrificed at 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24h post-injection (hpi). The spleen and liver were taken for each fish from each tank and kept in Trizol reagent at -80°C until use.2.2. Construction of normalized cDNA libraries and EST sequencingEight normalized cDNA libraries for the gill, brain, muscle, liver, heart, spleen, kidney and the mixture of tissues (gill, brain, muscle, liver, heart, spleen, eye, intestine and kidney) were constructed as described.35 Briefly, total RNA from each tissue was isolated using the Trizol kit (Invitrogen). Purification of mRNA from total RNA was carried out using Oligotex mRNA Midi Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, USA). The mRNA from the same tissue of five fishes was pooled with equal quantity for the construction of tissue-specific cDNA libraries; and the resulting mRNA mixtures from different tissues of five fishes were also pooled with equal quantity for the construction of a full-length cDNA library of all seven tissues. cDNAs were synthesized, normalized and cloned into a Gateway™ pCMV•SPORT6 NotI/SalI Cut vector (Invitrogen) and transformed into Escherichia coli strain XL-1 (Stratagene, CA, USA) as described.35 In addition, a normalized cDNA library of all seven tissues (gill, brain, muscle, liver, heart, spleen and kidney) enriched microsatellites constructed previously35 was also used to sequence ESTs (see details about the cDNA libraries in Supplementary Table S1).For each library, 5000 randomly picked clones were stored in the LB medium with 25% glycerol in –80°C for later sequencing. Some clones from each of the nine libraries were sequenced from the 5' end by using the M13/pUCR universal primer (5'-AGC GGA TAA CAA TTT CAC ACA GG-3') and BigDye chemicals on an ABI 3730xl Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster city, CA, USA). The EST sequences were deposited in the dbEST database of GenBank: JG732280– JG743071.2.3. EST preprocessing and cluster analysisEST sequences from the nine cDNA libraries constructed by our laboratory and sequences of ESTs28,32 of Asian seabass from GenBank were included in the following analysis. Base calling from chromatogram traces and trimming of vector and adaptor sequences and low-quality regions from EST sequences were performed by using commercial software Sequencher 4.9 (Gene Codes, Ann Arbor, USA). Trimming of the sequences were first performed from two ends until the last 25 bases containing less than five ambiguities, and then that of the vectors and adaptors were performed under the parameters that minimum overlap and approximate match percentage to consider as contamination were set to 8 and 99%, respectively. Other parameters were used following the original software defaults. High-quality ESTs (= 50 bp) were clustered by using software NGen (DNASTAR, Madison, USA). The clustering parameter settings were automatically determined based on the Sanger sequencing read technology and De novo Transcriptome Assembly and used a conservative philosophy that aligned portions of ESTs must share 95% sequence identity in at most 20 bp of overhanging sequence.2.4. Functional annotation of EST sequencesA total of 21 databases were retrieved from Ensembl (http://www.ensembl.org/info/data/ftp/index.html) and NCBI databases (http://mirrors.vbi.vt.edu/mirrors/ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/db/), respectively, and were used to perform BLAST analyses for EST annotation (Supplementary Tables S2–S5). Singletons and consensus sequences of each contig referred to as unique sequences were compared against the 11 protein databases using BLASTx and the 10 cDNA databases using the BLASTn algorithm with an E-value threshold of E-5 and a minimum alignment length of 22 bp. Batch blast of the unique sequences was performed using the local BLAST tools that available in ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/blast+/LATEST/.2.5. Gene ontology analysis by Blast2GO, GO Slimmer and KAASThe Blast2GO annotation tool36 was used to assign most probable gene ontology (GO) terms to the unique sequences that annotated against the SwissProt database (Supplementary Table S5) with the E-value set to 1 × E-5 and other parameters following the defaults. The significant unigene information (E-value cutoff was =1 × E-5 and a minimum alignment length of 22 bp) of the query set of unique sequences subsequently were mapped into several subcategories of the three level 1 categories of ‘cellular component’, ‘molecular function’ and ‘biological process’, respectively, with program GO Slimmer (http://amigo.geneontology.org/cgi-bin/amigo/slimmer?) and by searching against all available species databases and evidence codes (AmiGO version: 1.8). In case the unigenes have matched in multiple databases, only one record was kept in the summary (Supplementary Table S6). The KO (KEGG orthology) assignments and the KEGG pathway reconstruction were performed in KAAS (Automatic Annotation Server Ver. 1.6a; http://www.genome.jp/tools/kaas/) with the default parameters (Supplementary Table S7).2.6. Gene expression analysis using quantitative real-time PCRExamination of gene expressions was conducted using quantitative real-time PCR as described in Xia et al.29 Briefly, 1 µg aliquot of the DNase-treated total RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA by M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, USA) with poly-dT as RT primer following the manufacturer's protocol. For analysis of gene expression patterns, 10 times dilution of the resulting single-strand cDNA were assayed as DNA template by real-time PCR using primers (Supplementary Table S8) for 26 immune-related genes and EF1A gene as control. PCRs were performed with the iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) as described by the manufacturer in an iQ™5 Real Time PCR Detection Systems (Bio-Rad). PCRs were performed in triplicates.For analysis of the changes of gene expression, the values of triplicate real-time PCRs were normalized to EF1A gene expression, calculated by the <U+0394><U+0394>Ct method. The normalized values for the test fishes challenged with the bacteria V. harveyi were compared with the control level at the respective time and tissue. The resulting expression ratio was then converted to natural logs and analyzed with Cluster 3.0 (http://bonsai.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~mdehoon/software/cluster/software.htm#ctv).2.7. Identification of repetitive elements and single-nucleotide polymorphismsIdentification and annotation of transposable elements (TEs) were carried out with the program CENSOR in Repbase37 by blasting against zebrafish conserved repeats. The microsatellite-containing ESTs (with =8 repeat number) were detected using the program Tandem Repeats Finder38 with the default parameters (Supplementary Table S9). Putative single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were screened by using the program SeqMan (DNASTAR). To minimize the potential errors in the detection of SNPs caused by sequencing errors, putative high-quality SNPs were further identified by using more stringent criteria (only clusters with at least four EST sequences and an SNP mutated within at least two ESTs were selected) and no indel data were included in the analysis (Supplementary Table S10).2.8. Verification of potential SNPs from ESTsIn order to verify the potential SNPs indentified in ESTs, six DNA samples of wild seabass from Southeast Asia were used. All unique transcripts containing putative high-quality SNPs and enough flanking regions were selected from the ESTs for primer design using the program PrimerSelect (DNASTAR, Wilmington, DE). PCR products were sequenced directly in both directions with forward or reverse primers (Supplementary Table S11). SNP genotype was analyzed by using software Sequencher 4.9 (Gene Codes).3. Results and discussions3.1. Generation and clustering of ESTsIdentification and characterization of a transcriptome for the Asian seabass can make a significant contribution to future research of gene functions in the community. At the start of the transcriptome project, the dbEST database contained 5637 Asian seabass ESTs (gi:169659332–169664968), originated from a brain cDNA library32 and two subtracted spleen cDNA libraries (2887 ESTs; gi: GT219120–GT222006).28 In order to enrich the existing transcriptome data sets and analyze genes that expressed in different organs of the Asian seabass, we sequenced ESTs from nine normalized cDNA libraries from various tissues of the Asian seabass (Supplementary Table S1). A total of 11 451 high-quality novel EST sequences were obtained from these libraries after removing vector and low-quality sequences. The detailed information of the EST resources is presented in Supplementary Table S1.To create a large global collection of the Asian seabass ESTs, the published 8524 ESTs28,32 were retrieved from the dbEST database and included in the following clustering and annotation. After combining these data, a total of 19 975 high-quality ESTs were obtained and used to identify EST clusters representing redundant transcripts under high stringency (95% similarity; Supplementary Table S10). The clusters were composed of 8837 unique sequences (putative transcripts) including 2838 contigs and 5999 singletons. The number of ESTs in a contig ranged from 2 to 289. On average, each contig contained 4.9 EST sequences. The most abundant transcript containing 289 ESTs shows high similarity to the parvalbumin beta-1 mRNA sequence. Only 58 contigs consisted of more than 20 ESTs. The length distribution of high-quality EST sequences in the clusters ranged from 50 to 2098 bp with an average size of 425 bp. A total of 4406 (50%) unique sequences were >500 bp, 2653 sequences were between 300 and 500 bp and 121 sequences were <100 bp (Fig. 1). The average contig length was 574 bp, being comparable with that of other studies, such as cod18 and halibut.39 The unique sequences are being used in the development of a cDNA microarray to examine global gene expression in Asian seabass. Length distribution of the 8837 unique transcriptome clusters of Asian seabass.Length distribution of the 8837 unique transcriptome clusters of Asian seabass.Recently, the rapid development of novel massively parallel cDNA sequencing, or RNA-Seq, has allowed many advances in the characterization and quantification of transcriptomes in fish, such as salmonids,40 whitefish,41 catfish42 and Japanese seabass.43 Compared with traditional Sanger sequencing, RNA-Seq platforms allow the entire transcriptome to be surveyed in a very high-throughput, cost-effective and quantitative manner.7,44,45 However, there are still substantial challenges in using RNA-Seq for the assembly and annotation of transcriptomes from organisms lacking a genome reference. For example, the assembly of short RNASeq reads is difficult. Without cloning, it is difficult to know a priori which reads came from which transcripts; and many less highly or less broadly expressed transcripts are only weakly or incompletely supported by current RNA-Seq.46 Since the Sanger sequencing can determine the sequence of a full-length gene from cDNA libraries, the utilization of methods that combine RNA-Seq with the Sanger sequencing-based strategies will collectively resolve several technical challenges of RNA-Seq. The combination of the two sequencing methods is expected to improve the annotation of ESTs and facilitating studies on transcriptome.3.2. Annotation of the 8837 putative transcripts of the Asian seabassTo compare our data with the other existing data, we downloaded 18 species-specific data sets from Ensembl database and three data sets (refseq_rna, refseq_protein and SwissProt) from NCBI database. Ten of the cDNA or protein data sets originated from five fish species, and eight of the data sets originated from human, chicken, lizard and frog. By local blast search of 8837 unique sequences from seabass against these data sets, 2198 (25% of the unique sequences; lizard) to 4100 (46%; Stickleback) unique sequences were annotated by BLASTn and 2929 (33%; Lizard) to 3471 (39%; Stickleback) had significant matches by BLASTx. Both results showed that the transcriptome of the Asian seabass was more similar to that of the Stickleback (Supplementary Table S2) than to other fish species. In addition, 2364 (BLASTn) to 3002 (BLASTx) of the seabass unique sequences showed high conservation in at least seven species; and 1516 (BLASTn) to 349 (BLASTx) of the unique sequences had positive hits with three or less species.Compared with these species-specific databases, the two reference sequence databases (RefSeq) and SwissProt database could provide a more comprehensive, integrated, non-redundant and well-annotated set of sequences. The annotation of the unique 8837 putative transcripts (Supplementary Tables S3–S5) was performed on the basis of the best match data that found after local blast searches against RefSeq_RNA database by BLASTn and RefSeq_Protein and SwissProt protein databases by BLASTx. Of the annotated unique sequences in the Asian seabass, ~17 (Refseq_Protein) to 24% (Refseq_RNA) had significant homology with E-values between 1 × E-5 and 1 × E-15, being weakly similar to the counterparts in the databases. A smaller sets of genes (5.5% for SwissProt to 22% for Refseq_rna) that had a very good BLAST hit (<1 × E-105) were considered as highly significant homologs. The remaining was considered moderately similar (E-values between 1 × E-15 and 1 × E-105; Fig. 2). The distribution of annotated seabass unique sequences in various E-value intervals showing conservation with the homologs in the NCBI database.The distribution of annotated seabass unique sequences in various E-value intervals showing conservation with the homologs in the NCBI database.A total of 4323 unique sequences (48.9%) had significant annotations that presented in Refseq_RNA database using BLASTn; and 3108 sequences (35.2%) to 3320 sequences (37.6%) had significant matches to the SwissProt and Refseq_Protein protein databases using BLASTx (Supplementary Tables S2, S3 and S5). The low annotation ratio (35.2–48.9%) of the unique sequences with significant BLAST hits is similar to the level that reported in the Catfish EST project (37 and sim 50%),14,19 European seabass Dicentrarchus labrax (~ 41%)16 and the salmon EST project (45%).11 The low significant annotation success ratio in fish species might reflect the poor annotation rates of the fish genes in contrast to those of mammalian species. For example, currently EST entries in NCBI database for bony fishes are 5 142 023 hits, which are only 26.8% of the mammals EST entries (19 183 053; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nucest; 27 August 2010). Alternatively, the number of unigenes (8837) that were estimated from the number of unique transcripts is probably an overestimation of isolated genes in this study. The unclustered ESTs from a single transcript might result from alternate splicing, sequence polymorphisms, sequencing errors and non-overlapping ESTs.47A substantial proportion of the seabass unique sequences lack significantly functional annotations or protein identities. These sequences might correspond to proteins that have not yet been identified in related organisms to date or they were only the 5' untranslated regions of known genes due to incomplete genomic information. In zebrafish, a total of 30 796 genes had already been discovered (http://zfin.org/zf_info/zfin_stats.html; 13 September 2010). Since the gene numbers in fish transcriptomes are usually similar, the gene number (<8837) that were found for the Asian seabass in the study is much less than expected. Future additions of ESTs to the clusters will undoubtedly improve the rate of gene discovery in the Asian seabass. The information about the significant annotation of the query set of unique sequences is presented in Supplementary Tables S3 and S5.ESTs from multiple normalized cDNA libraries will significantly increase the gene discovery,47 providing a more broadly applicable data set for functional genomic applications. In this study, 11 cDNA libraries from various tissues of the Asian seabass were analyzed. The annotated unique sequences were further subdivided according to their library of origin (Supplementary Table S3). Of the ESTs, 9780 (49%) have significant annotations by BLASTx search against Refseq_Protein database and 12 394 (62%) have significant annotation by BLASTn search against Refseq_RNA database. Further analysis revealed a few genes were more highly presented in specific tissues and thus were candidate genes for further studies (Supplementary Table S3). For example, in the brain, several abundant transcripts were involved in transport processes, such as ATP synthase F0 subunit 6 and cytochrome c oxidase subunit II; and in the kidney and liver, some genes with high abundance related to immune system processes were identified, such as cathepsin D, IgG heavy chain, thioredoxin-like 1 and NF-kappa-B-activating protein. A list of top eight most abundant unique genes in each tissue is presented in Supplementary Table S4.3.3. Functional classification of the Asian seabass genesIn order to achieve a functional annotation of unique transcripts, we took the advantage of GO database using the automated annotation tool Blast2GO48 and GO Slimmer in AmiGO database, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database. These analyses should provide the base information for further research of gene functions in the Asian seabass.SwissProt protein database can provide a high level of annotations, a minimal level of redundancy and high level of integration with other databases. Therefore, functional classification of the seabass unique sequences based on the annotation results of SwissProt databases by BLASTx program was performed. The annotation information for 3108 unique sequences (containing 2489 unigenes) was first functionally classified by using Blast2GO software. We obtained 44 338 GO terms for 3042 unique sequences (97.9%) using this method and the remaining 66 of the unique sequences (2.1%) were unmapped (Supplementary Table S5). Therefore, the majority of the seabass genes could be classified bioinformatically.By using the GO Slimmer program under the three level 1 categories (cellular components, molecular functions and biological processes), the 2489 unigenes (Supplementary Table S5) were then classified into 23 of 24 subcategories (second level GO terms) in the category of biological process, 13 of 14 subcategories in cellular component and 12 of 16 subcategories in molecular function. Functional classifications of the Asian seabass unigenes for each of the three main GO categories are given in Supplementary Table S6.Genes encoding for proteins associated with cellular process (1161; 46.6% of the 2489 unigenes), metabolic process (854; 34.3%) and biology regulation (674; 27.1%) in the category of biological processes were the three largest annotated subcategories, indicative of the high metabolic characteristics in juvenile seabass. Two following groups were found to encode products related to the regulation of biological process (636; 25.6%) and response to stimulus (518; 20.8%). We found 140 (5.6%) genes acting in immune system process, e.g. chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 13 (ccl13). Figure 3 and Supplementary Table S6 show the distributions of unigenes involved in the immune system process and response to stimulus (under the third level GO terms) according to the GO consortium. The distributions of seabass unigenes involved in the subcategories of immune system processes (A) and response to stimulus (B). The number in parenthesis shows the number of unigenes that classified into the subcategory.The distributions of seabass unigenes involved in the subcategories of immune system processes (A) and response to stimulus (B). The number in parenthesis shows the number of unigenes that classified into the subcategory.Regarding the cellular component, a large proportion of unigenes was classified into cell (1136; 45.6%), cell part (1136; 45.6%) and organelle (818; 32.9%) followed by organelle part (460; 18.5%) and macromolecular complex (377; 15.1%). Binding (956; 38.4%) and catalytic activity (517; 20.8%) were the most dominant subcategories in the molecular function category followed by transporter activity (106; 4.3%). Nineteen genes involved in antioxidant activity such as superoxide dismutase 1 (sod1) and muconate cycloisomerase (catb). The remaining genes encode products involved in many other diverse biological activities.KO of the putative transcripts (8837) were identified through BLAST searching against the KEGG database.49 KEGG categories were found for 1381 seabass unique sequences (15.6%) with 1192 KO term, and 735 unique genes (8.3%) fell into 210 pathways (Supplementary Table S7). A total of 7463 (84.5%) seabass unique sequences had no assigned function. According to the electronic annotation, 56.8% of all the pathways (210 of 370) on the molecular interaction and reaction networks in the database have been captured in this study. This result was similar to the halibut EST analysis,39 in which 7.5% sequences were found for KEGG categories and fell into 185 KEGG pathways (50%).The three largest pathway categories were Metabolic pathways (224), ribosome (77) and oxidative phosphorylation (69), suggesting that the fish was undergoing tremendous metabolic activities. Large amounts of the annotated genes were also found associated with diseases and immune processes, e.g. Huntington's disease (67), Alzheimer's disease (63) and complement and coagulation cascades (22). Alternatively, many EST clusters were presented in 25 signaling pathways, e.g. MAPK signaling pathway (32), Chemokine signaling pathway (31) and Jak-STAT signaling pathway (16). A number of important regulatory molecules were identified in these pathways, such as proto-oncogene protein (c-fos). The KEGG pathway information of the annotated genes is summarized in Supplementary Table S7.3.4. Expression patterns of immune-related genes in the Asian seabass transcriptome after challenging with a bacterium V. harveyiVibrio infection of fish can cause significant mortality in mariculture.50 Previous studies showed that the transcriptome profiles of fish challenged with V. harveyi were considerably altered in some fish species, such as Japanese seabass,43 turbot51 and rainbow trout.52 In Asian seabass, elevated antibody activities in sera were found in all treatment groups53; and the miRNAs level was highly changed in acute inflammatory immune responses with protection against Vibrio infection.29 These studies suggested that V. harveyi can cause immune responses in aquatic organisms. However, so far little is known about temporal and spatial expression patterns of immune-related genes in fishes after challenge with V. harveyi.The Toll-like receptor (TLR) family is a family of receptors involved in microbial recognition by the immune system and the activation of signaling pathways that result in immune responses against microbial infections.54,55 Of the annotated genes in this study, 14 genes (Supplementary Table S7) were classified into the TLR signaling pathway through BLAST search against the KEGG database. To study the expression changes after challenge with Vibrio, effective qRT–PCR primers for 13 of these genes were developed. Temporal expression of these genes at the spleen and liver were analyzed by qRT–PCR using RNA isolated from seabass challenged with V. harveyi at five different times of points. In addition, another 13 immune-related genes showing important roles in host inflammatory responses28,29 were also analyzed in this study (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table S8). Temporal and spatial expression patterns of 26 immune-related genes in the spleen and liver revealed by qRT–PCR, Real-time PCR was used to examine gene expressions in the liver and spleen of Asian seabass challenged with V. harveyi. Samples were collected at 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24h post-injection. Relative gene expression changes are shown on a natural logarithmic scale, and the values represent the mRNA expression changes after challenged with V. harveyi relative to a control samples at each point of sampling time and tissue. Red color represents increasing level of the gene expression and blue color indicates decreasing of the gene expression after challenging with V. harveyi at the respective time and tissue.Temporal and spatial expression patterns of 26 immune-related genes in the spleen and liver revealed by qRT–PCR, Real-time PCR was used to examine gene expressions in the liver and spleen of Asian seabass challenged with V. harveyi.

Red color represents increasing level of the gene expression and blue color indicates decreasing of the gene expression after challenging with V. harveyi at the respective time and tissue.The expression profiles in the liver at 3 and 6 hpi and at 1 and 24 hpi were clustered together, respectively. The expression profiles for the spleen at 1 hpi were clustered with 3 hpi, and the profiles at 6 hpi were more similar to 12 hpi. Clustering of the expression patterns for the 26 genes revealed the increasing expression of IL1b was ubiquitous at five sampling stages and in two organs, but GOS2 gene showed strongly decreasing expression in most of the sampling time points, especially in the spleen. The expression profiles for gene FOS, PIK3R, APOE, FGG and SAA3 were clustered together. These genes show generally increasing expression at each time point in the spleen; especially gene FOS and APOE showed highly increasing expression during experiment in the spleen, but FGG and SAA3 show highly increasing expression at 3 and 24 hpi and slightly increasing expression at 6 and 12 hpi. In addition, CD40, DBPHT, COT, LY6D and STAT1 showed similarly increasing expression in the liver at 3–24 hpi, and in the spleen at 3 hpi. Interestingly, RAC1 show increasing expression in the liver at 3–24 hpi, but highly decreasing expression in the spleen at 1, 6 and 12 hpi. Our study demonstrates that temporal dynamics of immune-related gene expression in response to Vibrio challenge in the spleen and liver and suggested that some genes may respond differentially to pathogen challenge at different times and tissues. Future works on these genes to clarify their functions during pathogen challenge will help us to understand the innate and early immune response of fish. We are currently developing an oligo-cDNA microarray using the 8837 unique EST sequences identified in this study to study global gene expressions. The application of the microarray is expected to identify more genes responding to pathogens in Asian seabass.3.5. Identification of DNA markers in ESTsMicrosatellites and SNPs in ESTs/genes are useful as DNA markers because they represent transcribed genes and can be used as anchor markers for comparative mapping, evolutionary and association studies.56 Large-scale EST sequences can provide an enormous resource for marker development.14,42 In the Asian seabass, we identified 634 microsatellite loci in all EST sequences (Supplementary Table S9). A total of 70 different repeat motifs (2–10 bases) were found. Of which, (GT/AC)n (351 loci; 55.4%) was the largest group and followed by (CT/AG)n (110 loci; 17.4%) in the di-nucleotide microsatellite group. In halibut, 46.5% of the microsatellites detected in the cDNA libraries were di-nucleotide repeats.39 In our previous studies,24,25 150 primer pairs were designed for these EST-derived loci and were tested on the three parents of the mapping panel containing two full-sib families. Finally, 55 of these loci were polymorphic and were mapped in the linkage map of Asian seabass.24,25 Therefore, we could expect that that 36% of EST microsatellites could be mapped in the linkage map of Asian seabass.25By using the program SeqMan, 6144 putative SNPs were detected in the 2838 contigs of the current EST clusters for the Asian seabass (Supplementary Table S10). To minimize the potential errors in the detection of SNPs caused by sequencing errors, 193 putative high-quality SNPs consisting of 137 transitions and 56 transversions (Supplementary Table S11) were further identified by using more stringent criteria. We further validated the potential SNPs by genotyping six wild samples captured from Southeast Asia. Fifty-one (26.4%) of these SNP candidates showed polymorphism in the samples (Supplementary Table S12). The rate of polymorphic SNPs was probably an underestimate due to the fact that only six individuals were used and primers were developed only for 90 unique sequences where enough flanking sequences were available for designing primers for the validation. Using more individuals, the polymorphic rate of potential SNPs should be higher.3.6. ESTs containing repetitive elementsTEs are usually smaller than 15 kb and can be classified into DNA transposons (type 1) and retrotransposons (LTR and non-LTR retrotransposons; type 2).57 Repbase (http://www.girinst.org/repbase/index.html), a reference database of eukaryotic repetitive DNA, is the most widely used database of TEs.58 By using the software tool Censor,37 we analyzed the repeats of the Asian seabass 8837 unique sequences in the Repbase database. Besides microsatellites (Supplementary Table S9), additional 461 repeat fragments (TEs) were found in the 8837 unique sequences (Supplementary Table S13). Of which, DNA transposons (208; 45.1% of the repeats) were the most abundant type of TEs, followed by LTR retrotransposon (127; 27.5%) and non-LTR retrotransposon (84; 18.2%). Fragments containing Gypsy (85 hits), hAT (44 hits) and CR1 (37 hits) were the three largest groups in respective categories of the most abundant TEs in the species.TEs in the Asian seabass represent around 0.5 % (0.04/8.5 Mb) of the total length of clustered sequences. These results are broadly consistent with the observed fractions of repetitive DNA in the genomes of fish species, such as 0.7% TEs found in Salmonid EST Database.11 The hierarchy of classes of repeats for the 8837 unique sequences is presented in Supplementary Table S13.3.7. ConclusionA transcriptome including 19 975 EST sequences of the Asian seabass was characterized in this study. The clustering of these EST data produced 8837 putative transcripts. The annotation and functional classification of the unigenes identified a broad range of genes involved in different functions, processes and compartments, and a comprehensive list of signaling regulatory molecules working in disease, immune, growth and developments. The EST cluster presented here provides an unprecedented look at the seabass transcriptome. This transcriptome data provide a crucial starting point for further comparison of transcriptomes with other fish species and will enhance the progress of gene discovery and characterization and facilitate future whole-genome sequence assembly and annotation of Asian seabass.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis study is funded by the Ministry of National Development and National Research Foundation of Singapore.Supplementary data"
