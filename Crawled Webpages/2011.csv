IntroductionGlutathione (GSH) is the tripeptide <U+03B3>-glutamyl-cysteinyl-glycine and plays a central role in the processes of detoxification and redox buffering.1 Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs, EC. 2.5.1.18) catalyze the conjugation of GSH to an electrophilic substrate.2 Plant GSTs have been actively investigated during last decades.2–8 Currently, large numbers of GST genes have been identified or annotated from at least 17 plant species.7–9 In Arabdopsis, the complete identification in a genome-wide level revealed at least 53 GST genes.5,10,11 In rice, 59 GST genes have been identified.12 However, their works were carried out by BLAST searches against the rice expression sequence tag (EST) database; thus, some members may escape from their collection. Recently, 81 GST genes have been genome-widely identified in Populus trichocarpa and they exhibit extensive functional diversification.13 However, no other data have been reported on the genome-wide identification of the GST family, although at least 20 plant genomes have been completely sequenced (http://www.genomesonline.org/gold.cgi).Since GST functions have been closely linked to stress responses, expression analyses were carried out under a wide variety of stress conditions. Evidence showed that the transcript of plant GST genes was regulated by various abiotic and biotic stresses as well as hormones including xenobiotic-type stresses, such as herbicide application,2 chilling,14 hypoxic stress,15 dehydration,16,17 wounding,18 pathogen attack,19 ethylene,20 auxin,21 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene,22 hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and the defence signal salicylic acid (SA).23 However, whole family-based expression analyses were carried out only in Arabidopsis,11P. trichocarpa13 and rice,24 the transcript profiling of all family members is not available for the other plants.Although many GST genes have been isolated or annotated, only a small number of them have been functionally characterized. Reports showed that plant GSTs might play important roles in herbicide resistance2 and detoxification.25 Overexpression of GSTs in plants improved herbicide and stress tolerance,26–32 and some of GST genes have been patented.8 On the other hand, efforts have been put on the understanding of the role of GSTs in endogenous plant developmental processes. For example, studies revealed the role of GSTs in the vacuolar sequestration of anthocyanins in maize, petunia and Arabidopsis.33–36 Evidence also showed that GSTs might function as binding proteins by binding to various hormones including auxin37–39 and cytokinin40 as well as porphyrin compounds41 to regulate their activities.Generally, although plant GSTs have been discovered for more than 30 years,5 limited data are available on the genome-wide identification and expression analysis as well as their functional divergence of the GST family. Thus, we do not know the family size in a genome and its member that are involved in biotic and abiotic stress-related biological processes. On the other hand, little is know about how these genes have been evolved or expanded with such functions. In this report, we first genome-widely identified and characterized all GST genes encoded by the sorghum and other nine plant genomes, especially focusing on the Tau and Phi classes, which are the top two subfamilies in the plant kingdom. We then evaluated their expansion and evolutionary mechanisms by investigating their duplication and/or transposition history. Subsequently, we examined their transcript profiling by the full-length cDNA, EST, microarray and massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS42) data sets as well as by RT–PCR and quantitative real-time RT–PCR (qRT–PCR). Finally, we investigated their expression divergence under various stresses to further annotate their biological functions and retention mechanisms. Our data show that monocot and dicot GST genes exhibit differences in their evolutionary history and they have been involved in lineage-specific expansion and species diversification. Our data further confirmed their functions in biotic and abiotic stress-related developmental processes and also demonstrated that plant GSTs may be involved in the sugar-related signalling pathway.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materials and treatmentsGrain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) L. Moench cultivar BT × 623 was used for all experiments in this study. Seeds were imbibed in water. After germination, they were planted in greenhouse and were grown under natural light and temperature conditions. The 2-week-old seedlings were used for all treatments. For the drought treatment, seedlings were treated with 30% polyethylene glycol (PEG) and whole plants were collected in various time intervals (0, 0.5 and 2 h), and then frozen in liquid nitrogen for RNA preparation. For salinity and cold treatments, seedlings were subjected to the 250 mM NaCl solution and 4°C conditions, respectively. Samples for RNA extractions were collected in 0, 2 and 8 h time intervals. For glucose and sucrose treatments, seedlings were subjected to 5% of glucose and sucrose solutions, respectively, as suggested by Kojima et al.43 Samples were then collected in 0, 2 and 6 h intervals, respectively.2.2. Expression analysis of sorghum Tau GST subfamily members by RT–PCRs and qRT–PCRsExpression of sorghum Tau GST members was evaluated using the sorghum EST collections from several databases (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbEST/index.html, http://www.phytozome.net/sorghum and http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/tgi/est_ann.pl?gudb=Sorghum). Since low percentages of Tau members have been detected with EST expression evidence, expression analysis was carried out by normal and qRT–PCR. All gene-specific primers used for both normal and qRT–PCR analyses in this study were designed by Applied Biosystems Primer Express® software. Supplementary Table S1 lists all the primer sequences used in this study.QIAGEN RNeasy Mini Kit was used for total RNA isolation. The first-strand cDNA was synthesized using Invitrogen kit. RT–PCRs were performed in 20 µl of reaction mixtures with 20 ng of first-strand cDNA, 200 µM of each dNTPs, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 µM each of primers, 1 U of Taq-DNA polymerase in 1× PCR buffer. These reactions were carried out using PTC-100 thermo-cyclers. The temperature profiling for PCR is as follows: 94°C for 2 min followed by 35 cycles at 94°C for 10 s, 59°C for 10 s and 72°C for 25 s followed by a 2-min extension step at 72°C. PCR products (10 µl) were visualized in 2% agarose gel, and all pictures were taken in BIORAD UV-Gel documentation system using Quantity one 1-D Analysis software. The qRT–PCR analyses were carried out according to our previous description.442.3. Expression divergence of rice, Arabidopsis and soybean Tau GST subfamily membersRice Tau ESTs were collected from the Michigan State University (MSU) rice genome annotation database (http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/) and the NCBI EST database. Arabidopsis and soybean Tau ESTs were obtained from The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR, http://www.arabidopsis.org/) and the Soybase (http://soybase.org/index.php), respectively. The rice MPSS database (http://mpss.udel.eud/rice/)42 was used to evaluate differentially regulated genes under abiotic (drought, high salinity and cold) and biotic (Magnaporthe grisea, Mg, and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, Xoo) stresses according to our previous description.45 For Arabidopsis, the expression data under abiotic (drought, high salinity and cold) and biotic (Erysiphe orontii and Botrytis cinerea, Bcin) stresses were downloaded, and differentially expressed Tau genes were identified according to the description.46To evaluate the expression divergence of tandemly or segmentally duplicated genes, the Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) of their expression was computed for each pair according to the method by Lin et al.47 The cut-off r-value, below which duplicated genes can be considered divergent in their expression, might be determined by calculating r between the expression profiles of 10 000 pairs of randomly selected genes.47,48 Based on the method, we have calculated the cut-off r-value for the Arabidopsis expression data set in this study as 0.53. Thus, we utilized r < 0.53 as an indicator of divergent expression in Arabidopsis. We have used r-value = 0.59 calculated by Lin et al.47 as a cut-off in rice since we employed the same data set (MPSS) for our expression analysis. For sorghum, due to the lack of enough expression data for calculating the cut-off r-value, r < 0.5 was used as an indicator since r-values from 0.5 to 0.59 have been used for criteria to determine the diverged expression.47–492.4. Genome-wide identification of plant genes encoding GST proteinsThe Pfam database (http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/)50 was used to locate the GST_N (PF02798) domains in 53 key GST proteins from a variety of organisms. Similarly, the GST_C domains (PF00043) were retrieved from 58 key GST proteins from the same database. These key domain amino acid sequences were aligned by ClustalX 2.051 and were then used to generate the hidden Markov model (HMM) profiles for HMM searches with E-value cut-off of 1.0 against annotated protein databases from 10 plant organisms. These species include four monocots (Brachypodium distachyon, Oryza sativa, S. bicolor and Zea mays) and six dicots (Arabidopsis lyrata, Arabidopsis thaliana, Carica papaya, Glycine max, Medicago trunculata and P. trichocarpa). For rice, the O. sativa spp. japonica cv. Nipponbare release 6.1 pseudomolecules in the MSU Rice Annotation was used for the search. For A. thaliana, the latest version (TAIR9) of Arabidopsis genome annotation was employed (http://www.arabidopsis.org). For the remaining eight species, the latest versions were from the phytozome database (http://www.phytozome.net/). The key domain amino acid sequences were also used as queries for BLASTP/TBLASTN searches for possible homologues encoded by the 10 plant organisms with an E-value cut-off of 0.01 to confirm the HMM searches.The presence of the domain GST_N or GST_C in the putative GST members detected by the HMM or BLAST searches was confirmed by searching the Pfam database with E-value = 0.01 as the cut-off level. The SMART database (http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/)52 was also employed to detect conserved domains with default parameters. Proteins confirmed by domain searches were regarded as putative GST_N or GST_C domain-containing proteins (referred to GST_N or GST_C domain-containing proteins for convenience); otherwise, they were excluded from our data set.2.5. Alignment and phylogenetic analysisGST_N/GST_C domain or full-length amino acid sequences were aligned using ClustalX 2.0 (http://www.clustal.org/)51 and manually edited in Jalview (version 2).53 The aligned sequences were used for phylogenetic analysis according to the description by Jiang and Ramachandran.542.6. Expansion and evolutionary analysisChromosomal distributions of GST genes were performed by searching and mapping physical positions of their corresponding locus numbers in their genomes. Tandemly duplicated GST genes in 10 plant genomes were identified by three criteria (i) =10 genes apart, (ii) belong to the same GST subfamily and (iii) within 100 kb for both A. lyrata and A. thaliana or 350 kb for the remaining species as suggested by Lehti-Shiu et al.55 Segmentally duplicated chromosome blocks have been previously identified in a genome-wide level in Arabidopsis,56 rice57,58 and soybean (http://www.phytozome.net/soybean.php). We examined the segmental duplicates by comparing the positions of GST genes with known duplicated chromosomal blocks. For the remaining genomes, we identified duplicated blocks using the flanking regions (50 kb upstream and downstream) of GST genes according to the method by Kong et al.59To determine the contribution of transposable elements to the expansion of the GST family, the flanking genomic sequences of the 50-kb upstream and downstream of GST genes in different genomes were used for the identification of major transposon family members including mutator-like transposable element (MULE), hAT, CACTA and Helitron families as well as the identification of retrogenes according to the description.45 Retrotransposon elements were identified by executing the LTR_Finder program60 or RetrOryza.61 Non-synonymous (Ka) and synonymous (Ks) values and their ratios (Ka/Ks) were estimated and were statistically tested according to Jiang et al.453. Results3.1. The sorghum and other plant genomes encode different numbers of the GST family membersTo identify and characterize the sorghum GST family members in a genome-wide level, HMM and BLAST searches were carried out against the whole sorghum genome sequences (the ‘Materials and methods’ section). Our data show that the sorghum genome encodes at least 99 GST_N or GST_C domain-containing proteins (Table 1). Supplementary Table S2 lists the details of these members including their locus names, genome positions, coding sequences and amino acid sequences. Among these two domains, GST_N contains catalytically essential residues and is thought to be a key component of catalysis in GSTs, whereas GST_C may be responsible for substrate specificity.62 Therefore, these two domains were investigated either separately or jointly to better understand their evolution or function. Based on the GST_N domain sequences, the sorghum GST family can be divided into seven different classes by phylogenetic analysis (Supplementary Fig. S1). They are Tau, Phi, Theta, Zeta, Lambda, GSH-dependent dehydroascorbate reductase and tetrachlorohydroquinone dehalogenase, as reported in other studies.5,7,11,13 Among them, both Tau and Phi are the major classes, consisting of 56 (64%) and 19 (22%) members, respectively (Table 1). Genome-wide identification of GST encoding genes in the 10 completely sequenced plant genomesaClassification was based on the GST_N domain amino acid sequences.Genome-wide identification of GST encoding genes in the 10 completely sequenced plant genomesaClassification was based on the GST_N domain amino acid sequences.In addition to the sorghum GST family, we have also genome-widely identified GST members from other nine genomes as described in the ‘Materials and methods' section. Our data show that the sorghum and other plant genomes encode different numbers of the GST family members, and both Tau and Phi classes of GST members consist of at least 73% of total GSTs as shown in Table 1. Their locus names, genome positions, coding sequences and amino acid sequences were included in Supplementary Table S2. Currently, the GST members from Arabidopsis, rice and poplar have been reported12,13,63 and members from the remaining 7 plant genomes were newly identified. Among the 53 previously identified GSTs in Arabidopsis (http://www.arabidopsis.org/browse/genefamily/gst.jsp),63 two of them, AtT3g55040 and At5g02780, were not included in this study since no GST_N or GST_C domains could be detected with E-value = 0.01 as the cut-off level. However, we have identified nine more GST_N or GST_C members (Supplementary Table S3). Soranzo et al.12 have identified 59 rice GST members. However, three members OsGSTMU357, OsGSTU37 and OsGSTT2 were not included in this study since we cannot detect any GST domains in these members and we have also identified 28 more GST members (Supplementary Table S4). On the other hand, we have identified the same numbers of the poplar GST members as reported by Lan et al. (2009)13 and we have used them for this study.Besides the full-length GST_N and/or GST_C domain-containing genes, we have also identified numbers of partial GST fragments. They encode only partial GST_N or GST_C or both of partial domains. These members contain no typical domain structure and have no expression evidence with the characters of pseudogenes. Due to the low feasibility of phylogenetic analyses by integrating these partial fragments, we removed these members from our analyses although we may underestimate the rate of gene duplication.3.2. A significantly larger Tau and Phi subfamily of most recent common ancestor in monocots than in dicotsSince both Tau and Phi classes are the largest subfamilies in all analysed 10 genomes, we evaluated the patterns of expansion of these two classes by analysing the phylogenetic relationships of these GST members from different organisms (Fig. 1A–D and Supplementary Fig. S2 and S3). Most of dicot members fell into their own subclasses, separating from monocot plants. Members from each species intended to be clustered together, exhibiting lineage-specific expansion. To determine the degrees of expansion of these two classes among monocot and dicot plant lineages, we broke down the phylogeny into ancestral units according to the method.64 Due to possible gene loss and pseudogenes, the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) members may be underestimated. Thus, at least 2 Tau or Phi members would have been present in the MRCA among these 10 organisms (red circles in Fig. 1A and B for Tau and C and D for Phi). The MRCA among the 4 monocot plants possessed 15 Tau (green stars in Fig. 1A and B) and 10 Phi (green stars in Fig. 1C and D) members; thus, 7.5-fold and 5-fold expansions have occurred for Tau and Phi, respectively, in this period. Following this era, they underwent relatively lower expansion rates except for rice, resulting in the current Tau or Phi members. These results suggested that the rapid gene expansion for the 4 monocots occurred after the divergence of monocot from dicot plants. However, the MRCA among the 6 dicot plants contained only 6 Tau (blue triangles in Fig. 1A and B) and 2 Phi (blue triangles in Fig. 1C and D) members; thus, only 3-fold or no expansion has occurred for Tau and Phi, respectively, in this period. The large-scale expansion of Tau or Phi members for dicot plants occurred during their divergence from their MRCA (Eurosid I and II) (Fig. 1). These data demonstrate that both monocot and dicot plants exhibit the differences in their Tau and Phi subfamily expansion history. Phylogenetic analysis and evolutionary dynamics of the Tau and Phi classes of the GST superfamily. (A and C) Phylogenetic analyses of the Tau and Phi subfamily members, respectively, in four monocot and six dicot plants.

Significant contributions of tandem duplications to family sizeTo explore the possible mechanisms of the Tau and Phi GST subfamily expansion, we investigated the contributions of both tandem and segmental duplications to the expansion of these subfamilies in the sorghum genome. We examined the physical positions of the Tau and Phi GST members on different sorghum chromosomes (Supplementary Fig. S4). The results showed that both Tau/Phi GSTs were located on multiple chromosomes with non-random distributions. For example, chromosome 1 contained the highest density of the Tau or Phi GSTs with 30 or 7 members, respectively. Similar results were observed in rice and Arabidopsis.5,12 However, more even distributions were observed in soybean with fewer members in most of chromosomes (data not shown). Based on the physical positions of the Tau or Phi GSTs, the tandem cluster was defined as described in the Methods. Among the 56 Tau and 19 Phi GSTs in sorghum, 44 Tau (78%) and 12 Phi (63%) GSTs are found in tandem clusters, respectively (red locus name in Supplementary Fig. S4; Fig. 2), indicating tandem duplications as the main mechanism for the Tau and Phi GST expansion. On the other hand, only two members of Tau and Phi GSTs (Sb01g005990 and Sb01g013590 for Tau and Sb01g030240 and Sb01g047980 for Phi) were involved in segmental duplications (indicated by blue lines in Supplementary Fig. S4). Besides both tandem and segmental duplications, we also investigated the contributions of other expansion mechanisms including transpositions and retrotranspositions to the expansion of these subfamilies (see Methods). However, our data showed that limited contribution by both transposons and retrotransposons to the expansion was detected. Similarly, we have investigated the contributions of tandem and segmental duplication, transpositions and retrotranspositions to the expansion of Tau and Phi subfamilies in the remaining 9 plant species (Fig. 2). The results showed that the expansion of 46–82% of Tau and 33–76% Phi GSTs were found in tandem clusters (Fig. 2), suggesting tandem duplication as the major mechanism for Tau and Phi GST expansion. In addition, 2–23% of Tau and 0–72% Phi GSTs were segmentally duplicated (Fig. 2), suggesting that segmental duplication should also be regarded as the major expansion mechanism for the Phi class in some species such as in soybean and Arabidopsis. Pie diagrams showing expansion mechanisms of the Tau and Phi classes of the GST superfamilies in 10 plants. The figure indicates the contributions of tandem (red), segmental (green) duplications and both of them (pink) as well as other mechanisms (blue) to the expansion of the Tau and Phi class members in 10 genomes. In each pie diagram, the number prior to the comma indicates the total expanded members by different expansion mechanisms and its percentage is given following the comma.Pie diagrams showing expansion mechanisms of the Tau and Phi classes of the GST superfamilies in 10 plants. The figure indicates the contributions of tandem (red), segmental (green) duplications and both of them (pink) as well as other mechanisms (blue) to the expansion of the Tau and Phi class members in 10 genomes. In each pie diagram, the number prior to the comma indicates the total expanded members by different expansion mechanisms and its percentage is given following the comma.Since tandem duplication is regarded as the major expansion mechanism, we re-constructed their expansion history using the largest tandem cluster with 23 members in the sorghum chromosome 1. The 23 tandem genes are in two clades (Supplementary Fig. S5A), suggesting that this cluster is the results of two ancestral units, which may be evolved from ancient tandem duplication events. One of them contains only 3 genes whereas the secondary clade contains 20 members. The data suggested that different ancestral genes duplicated themselves by differential expansion rates. On the basis of the phylogenetic tree, we deduced the hypothetical origins of 23 genes from two ancestral units by tandem duplication (Supplementary Fig. S5B). For the ancestral unit with 3 descendents, only two rounds of tandem duplications were required to generate these genes. However, for the secondary unit with 20 descendents, at least 9 rounds of tandem duplications were expected to produce such a population. After expansion, these genes were then not always inserted into the loci according to their physical orders. For example, the putative tandem pair of the Sb01g030810 gene is Sb01g030990 but not its physical neighbour Sb01g030820. On the other hand, we found that most of tandem duplications occurred by a one-gene mode, i.e. only one gene was duplicated in a one tandem duplication event. This case was also observed in our previous report on tandem duplication of the lectin gene superfamily.65 Taken together, our data showed that parental genes were not always physically linked to their descendant genes and different expansion rates were observed for different parental genes.3.4. Different selection forces between monocot and dicot plants and between GST_N and GST_C domains in a speciesSince both monocot and dicot plants exhibited the distinct difference in their expansion history, we investigated whether they were under different selection forces. We first identified reciprocal best matches for all Tau or Phi GST members either from 4 monocot or 6 dicot plants. These identified matches were then used to calculate Ka/Ks ratios for their GST_N domain (Fig. 3A and B). Evolutionarily, the ratio of Ka to Ks can be used as an indicator of selective pressure acting on a protein-coding gene. A Ka/Ks ratio <1 indicates functional constraint with purifying selection on a gene, and a Ka/Ks ratio >1 indicates accelerated evolution with positive selection and a Ka/Ks ratio = 1 indicates neutral selection. Although the period with large scale of expansion of Tau or Phi GSTs from 6 dicot plants was later than 4 monocot plants, the average Ka/Ks for 6 dicots (0.29) is significantly higher than that for 4 monocots (0.15). Furthermore, the frequency distribution of the Ka/Ks ratios is also significantly different between dicot and monocot plants. For 6 dicots, most of the mass were centred near Ka/Ks = 0.2 or >0.5 whereas most of the mass for 4 monocots were centred near Ka/Ks = 0.12. These data suggested that GST_N in dicot plants evolved faster than that in monocot plants. Similar results were observed when GST_C domain regions were used for such analyses (Fig. 3C and D). To further analyse the reason why both dicot and monocot plants exhibited the difference in their evolutionary rates, we compared their Ka and Ks values separately. We found that their Ka values between dicot and monocot plants were similar (Fig. 3E and F). However, both dicot and moncot plants exhibited significant differences in their Ks values (Fig. 3E and F). As a result, they showed significant differences in their Ka/Ks ratios. Ka/Ks ratio analysis. Frequency distributions of Ka/Ks ratios were analysed using the best matched pairs among six dicot plants (A and C) or four monocot plants (B and D). (A) and (B) show the data analysed from the GST_N regions. (C) and (D) show the analysis from the GST_C regions. The average Ka, Ks and their ratios in monocot and dicot pairs were indicated in (E) for GST_N and in (F) for GST_C. Asterisks indicate significant differences between monocot and dicot plants at P < 0.05 (*) and P < 0.01 (**) by t-test, respectively. The Ka/Ks plots for the GST_C versus GST_N domains of the sorghum Tau members are shown in (G).Ka/Ks ratio analysis. Frequency distributions of Ka/Ks ratios were analysed using the best matched pairs among six dicot plants (A and C) or four monocot plants (B and D). (A) and (B) show the data analysed from the GST_N regions. (C) and (D) show the analysis from the GST_C regions. The average Ka, Ks and their ratios in monocot and dicot pairs were indicated in (E) for GST_N and in (F) for GST_C. Asterisks indicate significant differences between monocot and dicot plants at P < 0.05 (*) and P < 0.01 (**) by t-test, respectively. The Ka/Ks plots for the GST_C versus GST_N domains of the sorghum Tau members are shown in (G).Since most of plant GST proteins consist of two functional domains including GST_N and GST_C, we were wondering if these two domains exhibited different evolutionary rates. We analysed the Ka/Ks ratios of these two domains of the sorghum Tau members separately. The ratios of GST_C plotted against that of GST_N of same proteins were shown in Fig. 3G. The results suggested that both domains were under differential selective pressures and the GST_C domain might have been subjected to more relaxed functional constraints. Similar results were observed in the remaining 9 organisms (data not shown). The recent analysis on the Populus GST superfamily also showed similar results.133.5. Expression abundance of the Tau subfamily members among 9 sorghum tissuesTau class is the largest GST subfamily in plants and is a good candidate for surveying the expression divergence of duplicated members. Therefore, we further investigated the expression profiling of this class. We have detected 33 out of 56 sorghum Tau members with EST expression evidence. To examine if the remaining genes are expressed in sorghum and to explore their expression divergence, we have investigated the expression of 50 annotated Tau genes in 9 different tissues including young and mature leaves, panicles, seeds and roots as well as stems by RT–PCR analysis. The results showed that not all annotated Tau genes were expressed under normal growth conditions. Among 50 tested Tau members, 37 genes (74%) were expressed in at least one of 9 tissues (Fig. 4) and the remaining 13 genes showed no expression in all tested tissues. All these results have been confirmed by qRT–PCR (Supplementary Fig. S6). Among the 37 expressed genes, nine of them were expressed in all tested tissues. These genes were listed as follows: 01g030800, 01g030810, 01g030990, 02g022210, 02g038130, 03g045780, 03g045830, 03g045860 and 05g001525. Interestingly, 10 genes showed root-specific expression including 01g027620, 01g030830, 01g030880, 01g030890, 01g030940, 01g031010, 01g031020, 01g031040, 01g031050 and 03g031780. They were mainly expressed in either young or mature roots. On the other hand, we have detected two genes with leaf-specific expression patterns including 01g030840 and 03g025210.

Regulated expression of the Tau subfamily members in sorghum under various abiotic stresses and sugar treatmentsTo investigate if some members are expressed only under stressed conditions and to explore their roles and functional divergence, RT–PCRs were carried out to detect their expression abundance under various abiotic stress conditions (cold, PEG or high salinity) and sugar (glucose and sucrose) treatments. The results indicated that 37 Tau members showed expression under one or more stressed conditions (Supplementary Fig. S7A). All of them were also expressed under normal growth conditions (Fig. 4). The results were confirmed by qRT–PCR (data not shown). Furthermore, we have detected additional 6 genes with significant expression signals under various stresses (Supplementary Fig. S7B). Most of them showed low expression level, which may explain why their signals could not be detected by normal RT–PCR. Thus, we have detected total of 43 GST Tau members with detectable expression signals under normal or stressed conditions.By comparing the RT–PCR with qRT–PCR results and by statistic analysis, 37 genes were detected with significant differences in their expression level under one or more stress conditions or treatments. These genes and their responses to stresses and treatments were shown in Fig. 5A. Total of 35 Tau genes were significantly regulated by abiotic stresses including cold, PEG and high salinity (Fig. 5B). Among them, 12 genes were regulated by only one of these stresses (8 by PEG and 2 by salinity or cold). Another set of 14 genes were regulated by two of these three stresses and the remaining 7 genes were regulated by all three stresses. Besides abiotic stresses, sugar treatment was also shown to play important roles in regulating Tau GST gene expression. Totally, 26 Tau GST members were detected with significant differences in their expression level under both glucose and sucrose treatments (Fig. 5C). Among them, 6 genes were regulated by only glucose treatment and 7 genes were by sucrose. The remaining 13 genes were regulated by both treatments.

These data suggested the possible interaction between abiotic stresses and sugar signalling.3.7. Expression divergence among tandemly and fragmentally duplicated genes in sorghum, rice and ArabidopsisTo understand the functional divergence of duplicated Tau genes, we compared the expression profiles of these genes under various stresses or different sugar treatments in sorghum. Totally, 7 tandem arrays and 1 pair of segmentally duplicated genes were submitted for such analyses. If r < 0.5, 0.59, and 0.53 (see Methods) between a tandem array or a segmental pair in sorghum, rice and Arabidopsis, respectively, the tandem array or segmental pair was regarded as a divergent array or pair in their expression. Based on the criteria, no expression divergence has been observed between segmentally duplicated gene pair 01g005990 and 01g013590. Among 7 tandem arrays, 57–71% of them exhibited significant divergence in their expression patterns in response to cold, NaCl, PEG, glucose or sucrose treatments (Fig. 6A). Statistically, 86% of arrays showed significant divergence under abiotic stresses, sugar treatments or both of them (Fig. 6A). More detail analysis by comparing the expression data with phylogenetic relationship showed that expression divergence was observed even in closely related genes.

(B and C) Gene expression divergence of tandemly/fragmentally duplicated Tau members under abiotic and biotic stresses in rice and Arabidopsis, respectively.Similarly, we have also investigated the expression divergence of duplicated Tau genes in Arabidopsis and rice, respectively (Fig. 6B and C). For Arabidopsis, we have analysed total of 3 pairs of segmentally duplicated pairs (At1g10360 and At1g59670, At1g17190 and At1g78340, At1g27130 and At1g69920), two of them (67%) showed expression divergence in response to either abiotic or biotic stresses. Among 7 tandem arrays, 43–71% of them were differentially expressed under cold, NaCl, PEG, Bcin or EQr treatments (Fig. 6B). As a result, 71% of them showed significant divergence under abiotic or biotic stresses and 86% of them exhibited expression divergence under both abiotic and biotic stresses (Fig. 6B). For rice, two pairs of segmentally duplicated Tau genes (LOC_Os03g57200 and LOC_Os07g05800, LOC_Os11g03210 and LOC_Os12g02960) have been detected. The former pair exhibited divergence in their transcript abundance among various tissues and no expression divergence has been detected in the latter pair. On the other hand, among 5 tandemly duplicated Tau gene arrays, 40–80% of them were divergent in their expression under cold, NaCl, PEG, Mg or Xoo treatments (Fig. 6C). Thus, 60–80% of them exhibited expression divergence under either abiotic/biotic or both of them (Fig. 6C).4. Discussion4.1. Evolutionary origins of GST domains and their combinationsIn this study, we have genome-widely identified more than 700 GST_N or GST_C domain-containing GSTs from 10 higher plants. Besides these, our searches and reports show that GSTs are ubiquitous not only in higher plants but also in other eukaryotes and prokaryotes.62,66 Thus, GSTs are evolutionarily ancient proteins and one may be interested in the origin of this family. Reports suggested Theta, Zeta and Omega GSTs as the most ancestral classes.66,67 Our phylogenetic analysis also supported both Theta and Zeta as the ancestral classes in plants (Supplementary Fig. S1). On the other hand, GSTs were thought to have evolved from a thioredoxin-like ancestor in response to the development of oxidative stress68,69 and glutaredoxins are the suggested ancestors of the GST_N domain.70 In this study, we indeed detected several GST_N domains, for example, in the sorghum locus Sb02g003090, with very high sequence similarity to the glutaredoxin domain, supporting the putative origin of GSTs from glutaredoxins.Among these identified hundreds of GSTs, both GST_N and GST_C domains are usually encoded in a single gene, indicating that most of GSTs are homodimers in plants. The fact also suggests the co-evolution of both GST_N and GST_C domains. However, we have also identified some GST genes encoding only GST_N or GST_C domain (Table 1). The fact may imply the loss of GST_N or GST_C domain during long evolution. One of such examples was shown in Supplementary Fig. S8A. The figure shows a tandem cluster consisting of 4 rice GSTs and their domain organizations. After duplication, only the GST_C domain was detected in one of duplicates LOC_Os10g38150 whereas both domains could be detected in the remaining tandemly duplicated genes.Besides the detection of putative domain loss events, we are also interested in the detection of domain combinations, which may generate new proteins and thereby functional divergences.71,72 Our data showed that most of GSTs contained only GST-N/GST_C or both of them, suggesting the limited domain combination in this family. However, we have detected some exceptions. For example, both members of the Theta class Sb04g007760 and Sb10g022570 contained the Elongation factor 1 gamma domain (EF1G) except for both GST_N and GST_C domains (Supplementary Fig. S8B). These cases were also detected in Arabidopsis (Supplementary Fig. S8B) and other plants (data not shown). In Arabidopsis, we have also detected the integration of other domains such as EF-1 guanine nucleotide exchange domain (EF1_GNE) and Myb transcription factor domain (Myb_DNA-binding) (Supplementary Fig. S8B). The integration of the transcription factor domain resulted in the localization of this protein to the nucleus,73 suggesting the functional divergence by domain combination.4.2. Differential evolutionary history of the Tau and Phi subfamilies in monocot and dicot plantsIn eukaryotes, most of genes with structural and regulatory functions are members of gene families. They are descendants from gene duplication, which plays a major role in plant evolution.74 These duplicates may be lost or be survival by either retaining their original functions, subfunctionalization or neofunctionalization.75 However, limited information is available on the patterns of functional diversification governing the evolution of most classes of gene families in the plant kingdom.13Sorghum has been regarded as a biofuel crop of growing importance for ethanol production. Now both methylation filtration-based genome sequencing and 8-time-assembly draft sequencing have been finished and their data have been freely released.76,77 Thus, it is now becoming more feasible and imperative to further characterize its genes and their families for better understanding their evolutionary mechanisms. However, comparing with other plants, limited data has been reported on the genome-wide analysis of a gene family in sorghum. We have constructed a hypothetical evolutionary history of the Tau and Phi classes of the GST family and found numbers of pseudogenes with partial domain structures, indicating that some duplicated genes failed to persist similar to other gene families.75 On the other hand, we found that the era for a large-scale expansion was different between dicot and monocot plants. Our data from 6 dicot and 4 monocot plant genomes showed that different dicot plants exhibited similar evolutionary patterns, so did monocot plants. The MRCA of all analysed dicot plants had a small family of the Tau and Phi GST subfamilies and the MRCA of all monocot plants had evolved into bigger sizes of these subfamilies (Fig. 1). The data suggested that the MRCA of monocot plants duplicated Tau and Phi GST members faster than the MRCA of dicot plants. However, during the period from the MRCA of monocot or dicot plants to current species, dicot plants evolved faster than monocot plants with more rapid expansion and higher Ka/Ks ratios (Figs. 1 and 3). Our data also show that sorghum plants exhibit high percentages of regulated expression patterns among different tissues and under various abiotic stresses (Figs. 4 and 5) and both monocot and dicot plants have also been detected with high expression divergence under these stresses (Fig. 6). Therefore, it is reasonable to suggest that differential evolutionary history between monocot and dicot plants may be due to the changed adaptability to various environmental conditions during the divergence of monocot plants from dicot plants.4.3. Lineage-specific expansion and species diversificationWe have detected two large-scale expansion events of the Tau or Phi subfamily by investigating the expansion history of these classes in 6 dicot and 4 monocot plants. The MRCA of monocot plants experienced the first large-scale expansion with 7.5-fold increase for Tau and 5-fold for Phi while dicot plants required only 3-fold more members for Tau or no expansion for Phi GSTs (Fig. 1). The second large-scale expansion occurred mainly in dicot plants with the maximum 8-fold expansion during the species diversification of some dicot plants from their common ancestors (Fig. 1). These results suggested that the large-scale expansions might be required for species diversification although more GST members from such expansion might be also for the environmental adaptability or biological processes. On the other hand, we have also detected some species-specific Tau or Phi members as reported by Lan et al.13 In fact, Tau or Phi classes of GSTs are plant-specific and species-specific GST members have been detected not only in plants but also in non-plant organisms.5,7,8 Thus, both evolutionary history and lineage-specific expansion suggested that GST members may have contributed to species diversification.4.4. Expansion patterns and mechanisms of duplicationsWe have demonstrated that dicot and monocot plants exhibited different expansion patterns. We have also shown that tandem duplication represented the major mechanism for the subfamily expansion. At least eight classes of the GST subfamily have been identified7 and they exhibited different rates of expansion, resulting in different sizes of classes. Further investigation showed that the sizes of subfamilies were proportional to the tandem duplication rates (data not shown). The results suggested that tandem duplication could be regarded as the major driver for the expansion of not only the Tau/Phi GST subfamily but also the other subfamilies.On the other hand, the rice genome has been reported to undergo large-scale duplication 40–50 million years ago78 and rice is likely an ancient aneuploid rather than a polyploidy57; however, we do not see evidence for the significant contribution of large-scale duplications within a relative short period to the expansion of the rice GST family. On the other hand, we also investigated the contributions of other mechanisms to the expansion of this family since different organisms have evolved into different sizes of GST families. We have identified all possible transposons (MULE, hAT, CACTA and Helitron) and retrotransposons (LTR and non-LTR) using flanking genomic sequences of the 50-kb upstream and downstream of GST members in four monocot and six dicot plants. We found very limited contribution of transposons/retrotransposons to the expansion of this family in multiple organisms. For example, only one of the rice Tau members LOC_Os10g38710 was located in a PACK-MULE member TI0007202, which was identified by Juretic et al.79 However, we cannot detect its parental gene.4.5. Expression divergence and biological functionsAt least 26 sorghum Tau members were regulated by glucose or sucrose treatments (Fig. 5C). In Arabidopsis, we have also detected five Tau genes with up-regulated expression under sucrose treatment based on the microarray analysis.80 These data suggested that the Tau subfamily members in plants might play a role in sugar signalling.The complexity of the gene family functions was mainly reflected by the very high expression divergence under various stresses.81 Our data revealed that the Tau subfamily has evolved into a highly divergent group in their expression under various abiotic stresses and sugar treatments. These phenomena have been observed in all tested organisms including sorghum, rice and Arabidopsis (Fig. 6). Furthermore, the expression divergence was also observed among different individuals within a tandem array. For example, among 23 tandem duplicates (Supplementary Fig. S5), 20 GST genes show detectable expression and none of them exhibit the same expression pattern when their expression patterns were examined among different tissues (Fig. 4) or under different stresses/treatments (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S7). In addition, expression divergence of the Tau members was observed not only under these stresses but also under various hormones. For example, in sorghum, we have detected at least 40% of tandemly duplicated Tau genes with diverse expression patterns under various hormones including SA, methyl jasmonate or the ethylene precursor aminocyclopropane based on the microarray data.82 All these data suggested that expression divergence should be regarded as one of the major drivers to facilitate the retention of the tandemly duplicated genes in this subfamily. Additionally, these data also suggested that the Tau subfamily members should play important roles in stress regulation as well as sugar and hormone signalling.On the other hand, functions of plant Tau and Phi members may be retained with a relatively low divergence as shown by Ka/Ks analysis (Fig. 3). We also showed that both GST_N and GST_C domains were under different selective pressures (Fig. 3). GSTs have been thought to function in detoxification of xenobiotics and in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. Thus, both more relaxed functional constraints in the GST_C domain and high degree of expression divergence should be regarded as the major mechanisms to facilitate the retention of duplicated genes and the adaptability to the diversity of potential xenobiotics and stressors.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by Strategic Research Program from Temasek Life Sciences Laboratory in Singapore.We thank the Joint Genome Institute, the MSU Buell Lab and the Arabidopsis Information Resource for providing annotations and sequences.

IntroductionDrought stress is one of the several adverse environmental factors that are commonly encountered by plants and can result in significant reductions in crop productivity worldwide. In response to drought stress, plants activate a number of endogenous defence mechanisms that function to increase the drought tolerance.1 Plants have evolved molecular machinery that initiates complex signal-transduction networks which minimize the impact of a suboptimal water supply on plants. The identification of signalling pathways acting in stress-affected cells and the mutual interactions between these pathways are the major research efforts. As a result of the complexities of stress-related signal transduction and its huge potential for impact on modern agriculture, this research field has garnered a substantial amount of attention. The early events of plant adaptation to environmental stresses involve the perception of stress signals and subsequent signal transduction, leading to the activation of various physiological and metabolic responses.1–4In the signal-transduction networks involved in the perception of stress signals to stress-responsive gene expression, phosphorylation, which is mediated by two-component systems (TCSs) or His-to-Asp phosphorelays, is a key mechanism for stress signal transduction in cells. TCSs, consisting of sensor hybrid histidine kinases (HKs), histidine phosphotransfers (HPts) and effector response regulators (RRs), have been systematically identified and analysed in two completely sequenced and well-annotated model plant species: Arabidopsis thaliana and rice (Oryza sativa).5–7 A number of studies in Arabidopsis have suggested that among the Arabidopsis HKs (AHKs), AHK1, AHK2, AHK3 and AHK4 function in response to drought stress. In planta studies have demonstrated that the cytokinin (CK)-independent AHK1 functions as a positive regulator, whereas the CK-responsive AHK2, AHK3 and AHK4 function as negative regulators in drought stress signalling in both ABA-dependent and ABA-independent pathways.8,9 Although the AHK2, AHK3 and AHK4 proteins all positively regulate shoot growth, they exert a negative regulation of root growth.10–13 AHK1 also positively regulates shoot growth but its function in root growth is not known at this time.8 The involvement of AHKs in drought stress response suggests that the downstream Arabidopsis HPts (AHPs) and Arabidopsis RRs (ARRs) may also function in drought stress response. However, at the present time, there is not any in planta evidence or expression data, which have characterized the regulatory roles of AHPs in drought stress signalling. As for the ARRs, which can be classified into the type-A, type-B, type-C and pseudo ARRs based on their sequence signatures,14 loss-of-function studies indicated that among the type-A ARRs, ARR3, ARR4, ARR5 and ARR6 may function as positive regulators, whereas ARR8 and ARR9 as negative regulators in osmotic stress response, suggesting that these type-A ARRs might play a role in drought stress response.9 Recently, mutations in the pseudo aprr5, aprr7 and aprr9 genes enhanced tolerance of the triple mutant to drought stress, demonstrating that these three APRRs play negative roles in drought response.15 Since the rice TCS genes have been identified,7 expression studies have indicated that transcription of several rice TCS members, including HK, HPt and RR encoding genes, is altered by salt stress treatments.16–18 However, drought-related functions and/or expression profiling of rice TCS genes under dehydration and/or drought stress remain to be determined. TCSs were also identified in the important model legume Lotus japonicus.19 None of the abiotic stress-related data are currently available for L. japonicus TCS components.Global soybean (Glycine max) production is frequently impacted by drought stress, which may reduce soybean yield by ~40%.20 Given the importance of TCS signalling pathways in the regulation of various biological processes and responses to environmental stimuli, including drought stress, we have recently compiled a list of putative TCS-associated components in soybean.21 Within the soybean genome, a total of 21 HK, 10 authentic and 3 pseudo HPt, 18 type-A RR, 15 type-B RR, 3 type-C RR and 13 pseudo RR encoding genes were identified. Comparative analysis of the Arabidopsis, rice and soybean TCS members revealed the conserved architecture of the TCSs between these plants.21 In this study, we aimed to identify tissue-related and dehydration-related soybean TCS genes by characterizing their expression profiles in both root and shoot tissues of soybean plants treated with a time-coursed dehydration stress. These findings will enable us to perform in planta functional analyses of the candidates and will allow us to identify appropriate stress-responsive TCS candidate genes and their respective promoters for the future improvement of drought resistance in soybean via genetic engineering. Therefore, the identification, characterization and molecular tailoring of novel TCS members will have the potential to overcome a number of important limitations involved in the generation of transgenic soybean plants with superior yield under drought conditions.1,2,82. Materials and methods2.1. Plant growth, dehydration treatment and collection of tissuesSoybean cv. Williams 82 seeds were germinated in 6-l pots containing vermiculite and were well-watered and grown under greenhouse conditions (continuous 30°C temperature, photoperiod of 12 h/12 h, 80 µmol m-2 s-1 photon flux density and 60% relative humidity). For tissue-specific expression profiling of TCS genes, root and shoot tissues were collected from 12-day-old soybean plants in three biological repeats. For expression profiling of TCS genes under dehydration stress, the dehydration treatment was carried out in time-course experiments to identify dynamic changes in transcripts in response to dehydration stress. Specifically, 12-day-old plants were carefully removed from soil, and roots were gently washed to remove soil. The plants were subsequently transferred onto a filter paper and allowed to dry for 2 and 10 h under the following conditions: 60% relative humidity, 25°C temperature and 10 µmol m-2 s-1 photon flux light intensity. The intensity of the dehydration stress treatments was quantified by the levels of relative water contents and standardized water contents, which were determined as described previously (n = 5; Supplementary Fig. S1).22 For mock control, seedlings were removed from soil and washed exactly as above, then grown hydroponically in water for 2 and 10 h under the same conditions. Root and shoot tissues of dehydrated and control plants were separately collected in three biological repeats for expression profiling.2.2. RNA isolation, DNase treatment and cDNA synthesisPlant tissue samples were ground into a fine powder using a mortar and pestle. Total RNA was isolated using the TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen), and RNA concentration was determined using the NanoDrop ND-1000 UV-Vis spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA). For each sample, 4 µg of total RNA was digested according to the manufacturer's instructions in a 25-µl volume with Turbo DNA-free DNaseI to remove genomic DNA contamination (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA). After DNaseI treatment, RNA concentration was determined again with the NanoDrop spectrophotometer. The A260/A280 values of all RNA samples used in this study were 2.08 or higher, and the A260/A230 ratios of all samples were higher than 2.2. First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using 1 µg of DNaseI-treated RNA with the ReverTra Ace® qPCR RT Kit (Toyobo, Japan) in a 20-µl reaction volume according to the manufacturer's supplied protocol.2.3. Quantitative real-time PCRGene-specific primers for soybean TCS genes were designed using the Primer3 software.23 Primer specificity was confirmed by blasting each primer sequence against the soybean genome (Glyma1 model),24 followed by analysing the melting curves and amplicon fragments. Primers were redesigned if the corresponding melting curve did not yield a single sharp peak and/or if they had an electrophoresis pattern that failed to produce a single amplicon of the correct predicted length. The CYP2 gene was selected as a reference gene in the expression profiling of soybean genes as recommended previously.25 Quantitative real-time PCRs (RT-qPCR) were performed in 96-well plates on a Stratagene MX3000P system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) using Thunderbird™ SYBR® qPCR Mix (Toyobo, Japan) reagents. Primer sets of 0.4 µM final concentrations for each primer were used in a final volume of 10 µl well-1. The thermal profile of the RT-qPCRs was at 95°C for 1 min, 40 cycles at 95°C for 15 s and at 60°C for 1 min. Dissociation curves were obtained using a thermal melting profile performed after the last PCR cycle: 95°C for 15 s followed by a constant increase in the temperature between 60°C and 95°C. Background-corrected raw fluorescence data were exported from the MX3000P system and analysed in LinRegPCR software with a built-in baseline correction and amplification efficiency calculation.26,27 Amplicon-based fluorescence thresholds were used to obtain the Ct values, and these values together with the amplicon-based mean efficiency were used for calculating the initial quantity of mRNA transcripts. Finally, the mRNA levels of each transcript were normalized with those of the corresponding CYP2 transcript.2.4. Statistical analysis of the dataMean values of three biological repeats were used to plot figures, and error bars on each figure represent the standard errors. When appropriate, a Student's t-test (one tail, unpaired, equal variance) was used to determine the statistical significance of the differential expression patterns between tissues and/or between treatments. Differential expression data which failed to pass the t-test with a P-value <0.05 were regarded as insignificant. These insignificant data were regarded as ‘ubiquitous’ in the case of tissue-specific comparisons and as ‘unresponsive’ in comparisons between normal and stress treatments; regardless of the fold change between the expression levels. Dehydration-responsive genes were defined as the differentially expressed genes with at least 2-fold induction or repression at 2 h and/or 10 h after dehydration treatment, whereas their expression in the mock control seedlings did not significantly change in a similar manner (Student's t-test, P < 0.05).3. Results and discussion3.1. Confirmation of primer specificitySince the specificity of primers is crucial in RT-qPCR assays,28 we carefully designed each primer pair as described in the ‘Materials and methods' section. Furthermore, we determined their specificity by analysing their respective melting curves and amplicon fragments. All primer sets used in this study produced only one peak in their respective melting curves, and corresponding amplicons detected under our RT-qPCR conditions generated a single band of expected size on 2% agarose gels (data not shown). The sequences and calculated amplification efficiencies of the specific primers used in this study can be obtained in Supplementary Table S1.3.2. Expression of the soybean TCS genes in root and shoot tissuesIncreasing evidence suggests that the mechanisms of drought resistance are either related to root and/or shoot traits.29 Root morphology and development is one of the key traits that is correlated with mechanisms of drought resistance.30 Because the distribution of water within the rhizosphere is critical to maintaining function in different environmental conditions, plasticity for root traits is a vital factor to acquire resources. For instance, plants can adapt to drought by developing a longer taproot which helps reach lower soil layers where water is more readily available. In addition, an extensive fibrous root system can be useful for foraging subsoil surface moisture and nutrients such as phosphorus.29 On the other hand, a restraint of shoot growth has been shown to be advantageous in adverse environments by minimizing the evaporative leaf surface area. The growth restraint conferred by DELLA proteins, whose functions are regulated by different hormones such as gibberellin (GA), auxin and ethylene, is beneficial and promotes survival.31 Overexpression of the GhDREB1 gene from cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) in Arabidopsis resulted in a cold, salt and osmotic stress-tolerant phenotype as a consequence of growth retardation caused by GA deficiency, decreased sensitivity to CKs and repression of CK signalling.32 Therefore, the appropriate control of shoot- and root-related morphological traits is a promising approach for developing drought resistance in a number of crops, including soybean.29,31,32In Arabidopsis, numerous reports have suggested that TCS members regulate shoot and root growth and branching.10–14 In order to identify candidate genes that could be potentially used for enhancing drought resistance by altering shoot and/or root growth when overexpressed or repressed in transgenic plant systems, we determined expression profiles for all root- and shoot-specific soybean TCS members. As shown in Fig. 1 and summarized in Table 1 (detailed in Supplementary Table S2), the majority of soybean TCS genes were preferentially or specifically expressed in roots according to the criteria defined for the analysis of tissue-specific expression (Table 1; Supplementary Table S2).33 Forty-eight of the 83 soybean TCS genes were expressed highly in roots. Among these 48 genes, 20 genes were further classified into a root-specific group, as their transcript abundance in roots was more than 10-fold higher than that of shoots. The remaining 28 genes fell into the root-preferential group as their corresponding root/shoot expression ratios were between 3 and 10 (Fig. 1, Table 1). One gene (GmRR18) was found to be ‘very specifically expressed’ in root tissues as its root/shoot transcript abundance ratio was more than 118-fold (Fig. 1C). Another gene (GmHK02) was identified as a root ‘exclusively expressed’ gene since it was only detected in root tissues (Fig. 1A). Only four genes (GmHP07, GmRR04, GmRR17 and GmPRR46) displayed higher expression in shoots and the remaining 30 genes showed ubiquitous expression patterns. All four of the shoot-related genes were grouped into the shoot-preferential group with root/shoot expression ratios ranged between -10 and -3 (Fig. 1, Table 1, Supplementary Table S2). Expression of the soybean TCS genes in root and shoot tissuesaFold difference was calculated as the ratio of mean expression levels of the same gene in roots and the shoots, when the root/shoot ratio is <1.0, the ratio was reversed and a minus sign (-) was added.bGenes whose differential expressions between root and the shoot tissues did not pass Student's t-test with P-value <0.05 are also classified as ubiquitously expressed genes.Expression of the soybean TCS genes in root and shoot tissuesaFold difference was calculated as the ratio of mean expression levels of the same gene in roots and the shoots, when the root/shoot ratio is <1.0, the ratio was reversed and a minus sign (-) was added.bGenes whose differential expressions between root and the shoot tissues did not pass Student's t-test with P-value <0.05 are also classified as ubiquitously expressed genes.Expression of soybean TCS genes in root (white bars) and shoot (black bars) tissues under normal conditions.

Data represent the means and standard errors of three independent biological samples. Asterisks on the top of bars indicate statistically significant differences between tissues with a P-value <0.05 (*) or 0.01 (**).The expression levels of the soybean TCS genes were widely divergent. For example, the GmHK genes, which express more highly in roots than in shoots, can be divided into three groups (low, medium and high) based on their transcript abundance, in which the lowest (GmHK08) and highest (GmERS2) transcript abundance in roots was more than 3200-fold different (Fig. 1A). Among the GmHK genes, the genes encoding ethylene-receptor HKs, especially the GmERS1 and GmERS2, were expressed more highly than the others in both root and shoot tissues. Three GmHK genes (GmHK07–09), encoding proteins with highest homology to the osmosensor AHK1 of Arabidopsis,21 have a similar root-enriched expression pattern to the AHK1 gene.34 Similarly, TCS genes, coding for the Arabidopsis AHK4-like HKs in soybean (GmHK14–17), are more preferentially expressed in roots than in shoots (Fig. 1A),10,21 suggesting that a correlation between sequence conservation and expression patterns may exist. The soybean HPt encoding TCS genes formed a highly divergent group based on their transcript abundance. Specifically, their highest/lowest expression ratios in root and shoot tissues were more than 16 000- and 65 000-fold, respectively (Fig. 1B). Among the GmRR genes, the type-A GmRRs possessed the most diverse expression levels in both roots and shoots (Fig. 1C). GmRR06 had the highest expression in the root tissues, which was 170 000-fold higher than that of the lowest one (GmRR16). The expression levels among type-A GmRR genes in shoots were less variable than in roots, and the difference in expression was 28 000-fold between the highest (GmRR10) and the lowest (GmRR16) expressed genes (Fig. 1C). Twelve of 15 genes encoding type-B GmRRs were expressed either preferentially (eight genes) or specifically (four genes) in root tissues (Table 1). There were no shoot-preferential expression patterns detected among the type-B GmRR genes (Fig. 1D). The greatest amount of divergence in root/shoot expression levels among GmRRs was found for GmRR27, which had a root/shoot transcript abundance ratio of 39-fold. According to a comparative sequence analysis,21 the 15 type-B GmRRs showed the highest amino acid sequence identity to five ARRs (ARR1, ARR2, ARR11, ARR12 and ARR14). With the exception of the ARR14 gene that was not expressed in roots, semi-quantitative analyses determined that the remaining four ARR genes were expressed ubiquitously in root and leaf tissues.35 All of the GmPRR genes were expressed in both root and shoot tissues, of which four, eight and one genes were expressed root preferentially, ubiquitously and shoot preferentially, respectively (Table 1, Fig. 1F). Among the soybean TCS genes, the three type-C GmRR genes (GmRR34–36) exhibited the lowest levels of expression under our experimental conditions (Fig. 1E). In an analysis of soybean short transcript sequence reads by Libault et al.,33 the transcripts of two type-C GmRR genes (GmRR34 and GmRR35) were not detected in all the tissues except from the green pods. It should also be noted that the transcripts of GmHK05, GmHK06 and GmRR36 were not found in any of the nine tissues tested in their studies, including a transcriptomic analysis of root hair cells.33,36 However, in our experimental settings, the presence of the transcripts of these genes were reliably detected, albeit at low levels (Fig. 1A and E). It is possible that this discrepancy is due to the duplicated nature of the soybean genome,37 resulting in very high homology between duplicates. As a result, the method used in the authors’ study failed to detect expression because it could not assign reads matching with two or more closely related loci.33,363.3. Expression of the soybean TCS gene during dehydrationPlant TCSs have been implicated in the regulation of environmental stress responses, including drought stress,8,16–18,38 suggesting that the TCS genes, which function in stress responses, may be used to enhance drought tolerance in plants via genetic engineering.8,38 Stress-related soybean TCS genes can be predicted based on comparative sequence analyses21; however, this approach has limitations. Although TCSs have been systematically identified and characterized in Arabidopsis, rice, L. japonicus and soybean,5–7,19 only a few members of Arabidopsis TCS genes have been identified as drought-related genes based on expression and/or functional analyses.8,38Cis-element-based targeted gene finding approach can also be used to predict stress-responsive genes, and tissue-specific genes.21,39–41 However, because of their short length (5- to 9-bp core) and flexibility, the frequency of a cis-motif sequence in the whole genome is relatively high. In addition, a number of cis-element sequences might be syntactically correct without providing practical regulatory function.42 Therefore, our major goal of this study was to characterize the expression profile of all soybean TCS members under dehydration stress in order to precisely identify dehydration-responsive TCS genes that can potentially used to engineer soybean plants with improved drought resistance. We employed RT-qPCR analyses to conduct systematic expression profiling of all 83 TCS genes in root and shoot tissues of 12-day-old soybean plants subjected to 2 and 10 h dehydration stress. The evaluation of expression patterns in individual stressed tissues, rather than whole plants, might provide information on the mode of action of stress-responsive genes in specific tissues.43 As presented in Figs 2 and 3, a large number of soybean TCS genes appeared to be dehydration responsive. To precisely determine the dehydration-responsive genes, the expression of those soybean TCS genes, whose mRNA levels were found to be changed under dehydration treatment, was also examined in the water-treated control plant samples (Supplementary Figs S2 and S3). As a result, among 83 soybean TCS genes, a total of 18 induced and 33 repressed genes were identified (Fig. 4, Table 2, Supplementary Table S3). Previously, a cis-motif-based prediction using 12 stress-responsive cis-motifs suggested that out of 83 soybean TCS genes, 30 genes might be dehydration responsive because these genes were found to contain dehydration-responsive ABRE and/or MYBR and/or MYCR motifs in their promoter regions.21 It should be noticed that the ABRE and MYBR were discovered as dehydration-inducible cis-motifs, whereas MYCR was shown to act as both dehydration-inducible and dehydration-repressible regulatory motifs.44 We found that among the 30 predicted dehydration-responsive TCS genes, 11 genes were confirmed by our RT-qPCR analysis. Eight genes (GmHK10, GmRR01, GmRR02, GmRR25, GmRR34, GmRR35, GmRR36 and GmPRR39) are induced, and three genes (GmHP01, GmRR09 and GmRR29), which contain MYCR(s) in their promoter regions, are repressed (Supplementary Table S3).21 Thus, although the cis-element-based targeted gene finding approach has demonstrated a wide application in the genome-wide prediction due to the availability of a large number of cis-elements in many plant species, expression profiles of the cis-motif-based predicted genes should be verified experimentally using an expression profiling approach, such as RT-qPCR, prior to the launching of laborious in planta functional studies.39,40,42,45Genes with altered expression under dehydration in each familyGenes with altered expression under dehydration in each familyExpression of TCS genes encoding HKs and HPts in root (white bars) and shoot (black bars) tissues of soybean plants under dehydration stress.

The reported differential expression patterns passed the Student's t-test (one tail, unpaired, assuming equal variance) with a P-value <0.05.Although the soybean TCS genes were predominantly expressed in roots than in shoots (Fig. 1), their expression patterns upon dehydration stress were opposite (Fig. 4). Specifically, there were only 8 and 17 genes whose expression was induced or repressed in the roots, respectively, upon dehydration. At the same time, there were 14 and 20 genes whose expression was either induced or repressed, respectively, in shoots (Fig. 4). Only a small number of the genes responded in a similar fashion (induced or repressed) in both tissues. Specifically, the GmHK06, GmHK08 and GmHK11 genes were down-regulated, and the GmRR16, GmRR34, GmRR35 and GmRR36 genes were up-regulated. These data support the hypothesis that the majority of soybean TCS genes respond to dehydration stress in either root- or shoot-specific manner. It is worth mentioning that the dehydration responsiveness of the GmHK10 gene were opposite in the root and the shoot tissues. The expression of GmHK10 was induced in the roots at 2 h but was repressed in the shoots at 10 h after dehydration treatment (Fig. 2A, Supplementary Fig. S2A). Not only having a larger number of dehydration-responsive genes, but the extent of the responsiveness of GmHKs, i.e. the fold change, was also higher in shoot tissues. For example, the expression levels of the GmHK01 and GmHK12 genes, which encode proteins most similar to the Arabidopsis CKI1 and AHK3, respectively,21 exhibited a 5–6-fold induction in shoots but insignificant induction in roots (Supplementary Table S3). Similarly, the extent of repression was also more severe in shoots than in roots. A maximum of 6-fold repression was found in roots, whereas a 17-fold repression was observed in shoots (Supplementary Table S3). GmHK08 was the most repressed among all soybean TCS genes during dehydration treatment and in both tissues, and its expression in shoots at 10 h after dehydration treatment was not detectable (Fig. 2A, Supplementary Fig. S2A). In Arabidopsis, the osmosensor AHK1 and the CK receptor AHK2, AHK3 and AHK4 have been shown to function in drought stress response. The expression of all four of these AHK genes is induced by dehydration.8 Among the three AHK1-like protein encoding GmHK07–09 genes,21 the expression of GmHK07 was induced by dehydration, suggesting that GmHK07 may play a positive regulatory role in drought response of soybean plants similar to that of AHK1 in Arabidopsis.8 Out of eight GmHK genes (GmHK10–17), which are predicted to encode CK-receptor HKs based on sequence similarity to their Arabidopsis counterparts,21GmHK10 and GmHK12 showed significant induction in roots and shoots, respectively (Fig. 2A, Supplementary Fig. S2A). It is possible that GmHK10 and GmHK12 may act as negative regulators in drought stress response in a similar fashion as their Arabidopsis orthologs.8 Based on our analyses, all of the GmHK07, GmHK10 and GmHK12 genes appear to be good candidates for in planta studies.Among the 13 soybean TCS genes encoding HPt proteins, two genes (GmHP03 and GmHP06) were induced and four other genes were repressed upon dehydration (Table 2). Interestingly, none of the induced genes were found in root tissues. Among the induced genes, GmHP06 exhibited the highest induction (>6-fold) in shoots, meanwhile its induction in roots was not significant. The most repressed gene was GmPHP2, whose expression was reduced by 7.5-fold in shoots upon dehydration (Fig. 2B, Supplementary Fig. S2B, Supplementary Table S3).The expression of soybean GmRR genes followed different patterns (Fig. 3A, Supplementary Fig. S3, Supplementary Table S3). Repression of the type-A GmRRs genes in roots was not statistically significant. In addition, only two genes (GmRR01 and GmRR16) were induced in the same tissues. In shoots, three and six genes of this group were induced and repressed upon dehydration, respectively. Together, 11 of the 18 type-A GmRR genes were either induced and/or repressed by dehydration in root and/or shoot tissues, suggesting their diverse functions in the regulation of dehydration stress response (Supplementary Table S3). Diverse functions were also reported for Arabidopsis type-A ARRs. Mutations in arr3, arr4, arr5 and arr6 increase sensitivity, but an additional loss of ARR8 and ARR9 decreases the sensitivity to osmotic stress. These data suggest that ARR3, ARR4, ARR5 and ARR6 may function as positive regulators, whereas ARR8 and ARR9 function as negative regulators.9 In soybean, the six dehydration-repressed type-A GmRR genes (GmRR07–09 and GmRR11–13) encode ARR8- and ARR9-like GmRRs, providing correlative evidence that these GmRRs function in stress response, and may act as negative regulators in a similar fashion as their ARR8 and ARR9 orthologues (Supplementary Table S3). Similarly, the ARR4- and ARR6-like protein encoding GmRR01 and GmRR02 genes were up-regulated in response to drought, suggesting that they may function as positive regulators in stress response in a similar fashion as their Arabidopsis counterparts. The expression of type-B GmRR genes in soybean, which encode transcription factors, was mostly repressed in both tissues. Only two genes (GmRR25 and GmRR32) were induced in response to drought, and they exhibited shoot specificity (Fig. 3B, Table 2, Supplementary Fig. S3, Supplementary Table S3). As for the type-C GmRR genes, all three genes (GmRR34–36) were found to be induced strongly in both roots and shoots by dehydration (Fig. 3C, Table 2, Supplementary Fig. S3, Supplementary Table S3).Among 13 pseudo GmPRR genes, the expression of six genes was altered by dehydration, suggesting that they may play a physiological role in response to dehydration (Fig. 3D, Table 2, Supplementary Fig. S3, Supplementary Table S3). Genes encoding GmPRR39 and GmPRR44 were significantly induced in shoots and roots, respectively, upon dehydration treatment. Four other genes encoding GmPRRs were repressed upon dehydration, of which two genes (GmPRR46 and GmPRR47) were repressed in the roots, whereas two other genes (GmPRR48 and GmPRR49) were repressed in the shoots (Supplementary Table S3). The dehydration-inducible GmPRR39 and GmPRR44 genes were shown to encode either APRR5- or APPR9-like proteins.21 In Arabidopsis, the APRR5 and APRR9 proteins were reported to negatively regulate drought response.15 Therefore, it is possible that the dehydration-responsive GmPRR39 and GmPRR44 may function as negative regulators in soybean as well. On the other hand, although the transcripts of GmPRR38, GmPRR42, GmPRR43 and GmPRR45 were accumulated under dehydration, the transcripts of these genes were also increased in a similar manner in the water-treated mock control plant tissues (Supplementary Fig. S3), suggesting that circadian clock-related regulation affected the expression of these GmPRR genes rather than dehydration stress. This is not a surprise because it has been reported previously that these four GmPRR genes encode circadian clock-associated APRR1-, APRR7- and APRR9-orthologous proteins.21,463.4. Clustering analysis of the expression data of soybean TCS genesA gene's expression is regulated through several mechanisms, of which some are still unknown.47 Nonetheless, the regulation of gene expression via the interaction of transcription factors and promoters has been well documented.1 Similarities in expression patterns and responsiveness to stresses may likely be a result of the involvement of similar cis-elements and/or transcription factors. In order to gain an overall understanding of the expression patterns of soybean TCS genes, we performed hierarchical clustering using their log-transformed expression data. Figure 5 shows the result of hierarchical analysis of soybean TCS genes performed on each of the groups (GmHKs, GmHPs and GmRRs). As shown in Fig. 5A, the expression patterns of GmHK genes clustered into two distinct nodes. Within these two distinct nodes, each group was separated into two subnodes. The high correlation coefficient (0.85–0.96) of each subnode indicates that the expression patterns of the genes in each node were highly similar to one another. The expression of several genes with high homology, which is an indication of duplicated pairs, did not cluster in the analysis. For instance, GmHK02 and GmHK05, and GmHK10 and GmHK11 did not cluster, implying that their divergence in expression was the cause. The expression patterns of GmHP genes in roots and shoots during dehydration were clustered into three nodes with high correlation coefficient values (Fig. 5B). It should be noted that GmHP07 and GmHP08 did not fall into those nodes. With the exception of GmPHP1 and GmPHP2, the expressions of other highly homologous pairs in this group clustered together. These data indicated that functional redundancy is still high among duplicated HPt proteins of soybean. Expression profiles of each of the RR types (A, B, C and pseudo) clustered into two nodes mainly based on the expression levels (Fig. 5C–E). Some of the groups were clustered into two or more subgroups based on the responsiveness to dehydration in the tested tissues (Fig. 5C–E).

The groups of genes clustered in this analysis will not take into account the gene-to-gene expression divergence. We found that several nodes were formed (Supplementary Fig. S4), implying the possibility that similar dehydration-regulated pathways exist for each node.3.5. ConclusionsThis report has provided the first insight into the previously uncharacterized TCS members of soybean and placed a special emphasis on the relation to dehydration stress responsiveness. Our results have provided useful information by identifying candidate dehydration-responsive genes. By combining these genes with their associated dehydration-responsive promoters, scientists can utilize these resources to engineer soybean plants for enhanced stress resistance. We have selected a number of dehydration-responsive genes for further analysis in Arabidopsis to corroborate their functional significance in planta. By implementing these functional studies, we aim to identify a suite of candidate genes that are best suited for the genetic engineering of soybean plants with improved drought resistance.Supplementary DataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingD.T.L. is supported by the RIKEN Foreign Postdoctoral Fellowship.

IntroductionNext-generation sequencing technology has the potential to allow sequencing of whole genomes to be carried out in standard molecular genetics laboratories. However, an important current application is the sequencing of specific genomic regions, e.g. genes with known or suspected mutations in patient samples. In order to sequence parts of the genome of interest, a number of target enrichment procedures have been developed. These include standard PCR, long-range PCR, nested patch PCR, template circularization, the use of gapped molecular inversion probes, microarray capture, in-solution capture and microdroplet-based PCR enrichment.1–9 All these methods work but each has its own advantages and disadvantages. A recent review on target enrichment strategies for next-generation sequencing, which discusses the methods listed above, concluded that the ability to combine DNA samples prior to enrichment would be an important advancement for targeted next-generation sequencing: ‘The logical extension of sample pooling is to perform multiplexed target enrichments in which many samples are barcoded before capture’.10 Here, we describe a method that delivers this advancement by combining DNA samples using indexes or barcodes prior to target enrichment.We have adapted the indexing protocol published by Craig et al.11 and combined it with the Agilent Technologies SureSelect Target Enrichment System to develop a cost-efficient method for targeting smaller regions of the genome (e.g. 100 kb–1 Mb) in multiple DNA samples. SureSelect is a capture protocol based on the in-solution method developed by Gnirke et al.12 This method allows targeting of regions of the genome in custom designed reactions by using cRNA baits. By enabling simultaneous enrichment of multiple samples with no impact on individual sample identification for downstream analysis, this method significantly reduces the cost and time required for this type of experiment. Our method is highly suited to target enrichment of smaller genomic regions. The method can accurately detect SNPs at enriched target sites. Within a single sequencing experiment, it has the capacity to analyze the exonic regions of hundreds of genes in tens of samples for sequence variation using as little as 1 µg of input DNA.2. Materials and methods2.1. Enrichment reaction eArray designWe focused on two genes on chromosome 1 (PTBP2 and CDC42). The plan was to sequence the genes in full and include upstream and downstream regions. The target region for CDC42 was 108 139 bp, and for PTBP2, it was 184 850 bp. Bait libraries were designed and assessed for coverage across the target genomic regions using the Agilent eArray website (https://earray.chem.agilent.com/earray/). The online design recommends repeat masking of the target sequence in order to minimize off-target capture. With the default repeat masking option turned on, it was only possible to design target capture baits for just under 40% of CDC42 and just under 43% for PTBP2 (see cRNA baits RM track in Supplementary Fig. SA, e.g. of coverage across PTBP2 with default options). In order to try and increase the percentage of target capture, we adopted an alternative repeat masking protocol: the repeat masking constraints were relaxed to allow relatively unique baits to remain in the pool of target capture baits. This was achieved by designing baits using the Agilent eArray website to the target region with the repeat masking option turned off. The resulting baits were searched against the human genome reference (hg18) for similarity. If a bait mapped to more than one location with greater than 90% sequence identity using BLAST (~12 mismatches across the bait), this bait was removed from the design. Using this protocol, we were able to design baits for just over 54% of CDC42 and 77% of PTBP2 (see cRNA baits SRM in Supplementary Fig. SA, e.g. of coverage across PTBP2 with our alternative relaxed repeat masking). Because the bait library was a fraction of the total possible for eArray design, we replicated it four times using 92.18% of the available space on the array.2.2. Index designThe indexing methodology was taken from the study by Craig et al.11 The specific 6 bp indexes used in this study (listed in Supplementary Table SA) were from a group of 19 indexes that performed most reliably in that study (Fig. 2 in Craig et al.11). Each index is designed such that it can tolerate at least 1 bp change as a result of a sequencing error without mutating into one of the other indexes used in the study. This helps guard against potential mix-up of individual sample data.2.3. Library preparation, target enrichment and sequencing of genomic DNA samplesDNA from each of nine CEU HapMap samples (three trios) was used in this study. A total of four enriched sequencing libraries were generated using these samples (Fig. 1). Library 1 contained one target enriched non-indexed DNA sample. Library 2 contained one target enriched indexed DNA sample. Library 3 was a multiplex sequencing library of three equimolar indexed samples, which was enriched using one target enrichment reaction. Library 4 was a multiplex sequencing library of nine equimolar indexed samples, which was enriched using one target enrichment reaction. Figure 1 identifies the HapMap samples used in each lane of sequencing. The issue of potential differences in quantity of sequence reads between indexed samples due to the efficiency of indexed adapter ligation to input DNA, as previously reported by Craig et al.,11 was addressed in this study by multiplexing the indexed in equal quantities pre-enrichment. Experimental Design. Genomic DNA from nine HapMap samples was chosen for the study (three trio families). DNA from one of the samples (NA11881) was prepared twice (with and without an indexed adapter), target enriched and sequenced separately as single samples (non-indexed sample and one indexed sample in Step 1 and enriched libraries 1 and 2 in Step 2). One trio family (NA11881, NA11882 and NA10859; all indexed) was pooled after the Illumina genomic DNA sample prep and enriched together using one SureSelect enrichment reaction to produce the enriched library 3 sample. Indexed DNA from all nine samples was also pooled after the Illumina genomic DNA sample prep and enriched together using one SureSelect enrichment reaction to produce the enriched library 4 sample. Note: enriched libraries 3 and 4 were also sequenced using 80 bp reads to generate additional data for validation of the method for SNP detection.Experimental Design.

Note: enriched libraries 3 and 4 were also sequenced using 80 bp reads to generate additional data for validation of the method for SNP detection.The preparation of each sample is a two-step process; in the first step, the DNA is prepared as an Illumina sequencing library, and in the second step, the sequencing library is enriched for the desired target using the Agilent SureSelect enrichment protocol. The library preparation and enrichment methods were followed according to the Agilent Illumina Single-End Sequencing Platform Library Prep protocol (v1.2 April 2009) with the following modifications: (1) instead of shearing the DNA with a covaris system, a biorupter (Diagenode) was used. The samples were sonicated on high for 30 s and off for 30 s for a total 30 min with addition of ice after every 10 min to keep the samples cool. (2) For the indexed samples (libraries 2–4), the Illumina adapters were replaced with custom made indexed adapters supplied by IDT DNA. During the SureSelect enrichment process, blocking oligos are used (provided by Agilent) to temporarily block the Illumina adapter sequence and prevent off-target pull-down of genomic DNA due to similarity of sequence in the cRNA baits and Illumina adapter sequence. (3) For the pre-capture enrichment PCR, 1.3 µl of DNA was used as input with 11 cycles of PCR instead of 1 µl of input DNA and 14 cycles of PCR. (4) Post-enriched library DNA from the individual samples were combined (one, three or nine samples) to a total quantity of 500 ng per pool. This solution was allowed to evaporate off overnight instead of using a vacuum concentrator and resuspended in 3.4 µl of elution buffer to give a final concentration of ~147 ng/µl. The individual sample combinations (one, three or nine-samples) were each enriched using one custom SureSelect enrichment reaction (library design ELID: 0236181). Target enriched libraries were stored at a stock concentration of 10 nM ready for sequencing. A total of 6/8 pM of target enriched libraries were sequenced on the Illumina Genome Analyzer II using 40 bp reads following the manufacturers protocol. Libraries 3 and 4 (three and nine samples) were also sequenced using 80 bp reads to generate additional data for the study.2.4. Data analysisThe base sequence data were called from the image files with the Illumina Bustard.py script and the Illumina GA pipeline version1.4. The RunInfo.xml file was edited to allow for the 6 bp index to be called as a separate index read in the analysis, with matrix and phasing estimated from the PhiX control lane. This allowed the 6 bp index to be ignored in the alignment of the sequences to the reference genome (hg18) to facilitate calculation of basic QC measures, i.e. % clusters passing filters and alignment to hg18 (Supplementary Table SB). Both indexed and non-indexed sequence reads were treated in this way so that the effective read length for samples was 34 bp (for 40 bp reads) and 74 bp (for 80 bp reads). The sequenced reads were then parsed based on the index using an in-house Perl script to allow analysis of the data on an individual per sample basis. SNP detection and generation of data used to determine coverage were performed using MAQ13 on the individual sample sequence data. The Illumina quality scores were converted to the standard Phred scores required by MAQ by using a modified version of the fq_all2std.pl script supplied with MAQ. A SNP masked reference genome was used for alignment of the reads.3. ResultsFigure 1 outlines the experimental design for this study. Four sequencing libraries were enriched for 377 kb of target sequence. Libraries 1 and 2 each contained the same HapMap DNA sample but differed because library 2 included a 6 bp index. Comparison of sequence data from these indexed and non-indexed samples determined the impact of the index on the efficiency of the enrichment reaction. The third and fourth libraries were multiplex libraries containing three- and nine-indexed HapMap samples, respectively. Sequence data from these libraries were used to assess the performance of the indexes in distributing the reads from a single sequencing reaction to multiple samples and to measure the accuracy of SNP calling in multiplex samples.3.1. Comparison of on-target versus off-target sequence coverage in indexed and non-indexed samplesSequence data from the non-indexed DNA sample show that 20% of sequence reads were on-target, i.e. they mapped back to a target region of the enrichment reaction ±50 bp (Table 1). Across the target regions, there was a 1708-fold enrichment of target DNA in this sample. Ninty-eight percent of the targeted bases were covered by at least one sequence read and on average the target regions were covered to a depth of 169x. We investigated the effect of including a 6 bp index in the adaptor sequence on the efficiency of the enrichment reaction by enriching and sequencing the same DNA sample with an index. The on-target (22%) and fold enrichment (1885) metrics are similar for both samples (Table 1) indicating that the inclusion of the index did not compromise the performance of the enrichment reaction. Figure 2A and B show that for both ‘on-target’ and ‘off-target’ locations, the pattern of sequence coverage obtained is consistent between the single indexed and single non-indexed samples. The higher sequence coverage observed for the non-indexed sample compared with the indexed sample reflects the larger number of clusters (and therefore sequence reads) that passed QC filtering for the non-indexed sample (Supplementary Table SB). The three-index sample and the nine-index sample libraries had medians of 21 and 18% on-target sequence and medians of 1689- and 1467-fold enrichment, respectively, based on combined 40 and 80 bp read data.

Comparison of read count for three-index sample versus nine-index sampleFigure 3 shows the performance of the indexing methodology in combination with target enrichment. The numbers of reads attributable to each index/sample are calculated as a percentage of the total number of sequence reads per lane of data. For both the three-index sample and nine-index sample libraries, there is a relatively even share of sequence reads for the individual samples, especially in the nine-index library. This indicates that the enrichment process has been consistent across all samples within each indexed library. The individual read counts uniquely aligning to the hg18 reference, percentage on-target and fold enrichment for each sample in the three- and nine-index sample libraries are detailed in Supplementary Table SC.

Concordance of SNP calls with known HapMap genotypesTo illustrate the capacity of this method to detect SNPs with very high accuracy, we present data from the sequenced PTBP2 and CDC42 regions. Concordance rates for SNP calls compared with known HapMap genotypes are listed in Table 2. Only SNPs that had at least one copy of the non-reference allele, a sequencing depth of =8x and MAQ base quality score >30 were considered for analysis for each test sample. For the three-index sample library at a sequencing coverage of =8x, the concordance rate across the three samples was 99.1%. For the nine-index sample library at =8x coverage, the concordance rate was 98.9%. Combined these data give an overall concordance rate of 99% for SNP calls in the three- and nine-indexed samples. If we consider the concordance of SNP calls at all sites, the false-negative rate (i.e. the proportion of HapMap SNPs not detected in the sequence data irrespective of coverage) was 1.4% for the three-index sample library and 4.9% for the nine-index sample library. This assumes that the genotypes in the HapMap database are correct. Concordance of SNPs called by MAQ in sequencing data with known HapMap genotypesaOnly 97 of the 103 SNPs had =8x coverage and a Phred-like consensus score >30 and were included in concordance analysis.Concordance of SNPs called by MAQ in sequencing data with known HapMap genotypesaOnly 97 of the 103 SNPs had =8x coverage and a Phred-like consensus score >30 and were included in concordance analysis.4. DiscussionWe present a method where multiple DNA samples are first indexed and combined into one sequencing library and then target enriched using a single reaction. By indexing prior to enrichment, this method (i) dramatically reduces the costs associated with target enrichment and (ii) introduces significant flexibility into the design of targeted next-generation sequencing studies.The efficiency of the enrichment reaction is not compromised by the inclusion of the 6 bp index in adaptor sequence as determined by enrichment and sequencing of the same DNA sample with and without an index. We were able to show that use of index-specific blocking oligos during the enrichment process is not necessary. The enrichment process is reasonably consistent across all indexed samples in both the three-index sample and nine-index sample libraries analyzed in this study. The problem of differential ligation efficiency for individual indexes11 has been resolved here by quantifying each ligated and PCR-enriched sequencing library and then combining individual indexed sample libraries in equimolar amounts prior to target enrichment. In the three-index sample library, the sample with the ACACAT index (NA10859) had approximately one-third less reads than the other two indexed samples in that library. However, in the nine-index sample library, where the read counts for all nine individual samples were within a tight range of each other, the same ACACAT index did not under perform compared with the other indexes. Differences in sample read counts are more likely due to pipetting or quantitation error when the sequencing libraries are initially combined prior to the enrichment process.We demonstrate that multiplex target enrichment using DNA indexing can detect SNPs with high accuracy. In accordance with other next-generation sequencing studies, SNP detection is highly dependent on sequence coverage and is more difficult for heterozygous sites.14 Even at a relatively low coverage of =8x, 99% of SNPs were called correctly when data from the PTBP2 and CDC42 loci from the three- and nine-index samples were compared with online HapMap data. This concordance call rate compares well with rates reported for other target enrichment studies: 99.7% for variants with a sequencing coverage >5x, MAQ quality score >3014; 99.4% for high-quality calls inferred using Bayesian model12 and 99.57% for variants with a sequencing coverage >8x, MAQ quality score >30.15Alternative methods amenable to combining multiple target enrichment and sample indexing such as high-throughput microdroplet-based PCR technology7 and on-array sequence capture8,15,16 require up to 7.5 and 20 µg of input DNA, respectively. These large requirements for input DNA put a significant strain on studies with limited amounts of source biological material. We used 3 µg of input DNA for our method but this could be lowered to 1 µg or less because the input requirement for the enrichment reaction is only 500 ng of Illumina sequencing library. Therefore, we believe our method is ideally suited to multiplex target enrichment of samples with limited DNA resources, e.g. clinical samples.The factors that affect sequence coverage, and consequently SNP detection, are the volume of aligned sequence data generated from an experiment and the efficiency of the enrichment reaction. The former can be increased by repeating the sequencing experiment and/or loading a higher quantity of library DNA onto the flowcell to generate more data, sequencing to a longer read length, performing paired-end sequencing and implementing newer calling algorithms that can identify more sequence reads on a flowcell. The efficiency of the enrichment reaction is largely dependent on its design. In this study, we used a relaxed repeat masking protocol in an effort to increase the proportion of the PTBP2 and CDC42 genes that could be sequenced. Although this did allow us to sequence more of these genes than would have been possible with the stricter Agilent default repeat masking settings, it came at a cost of generating more off-target sequence. On-target sequence using this enrichment reaction was ~21%. This is lower than achieved in other studies that used the SureSelect system (42–5012 and 40–45%14) or Agilent microarray capture (36–76,17 36–5516 and 37–54% for whole exome resequencing15). In this study, the reduction in on-target specificity is most likely due to the relaxed repeat masking used in the design of the target enrichment reaction, which resulted in a large proportion of reads mapping to repetitive regions (Supplementary Fig. SB). The advantage of implementing the default repeat masking settings during SureSelect eArray design will be greater on-target specificity. The disadvantage of these settings is that it will not be possible to target some genomic regions. How punitive this will be depends on the proportion of target regions that contains repetitive sequences. It will certainly impact on studies that plan to sequence entire genes including introns. For example, in this study, just under 40% of CDC42 could be targeted with default repeat masking settings. However, studies targeting exonic sequence at multiple sites will be less influenced by repetitive sequence.In summary, we have designed an effective strategy to allow target enrichment and sequencing of multiple samples in parallel using DNA indexing. This method is very accurate for SNP detection. By combining DNA samples prior to enrichment, this method dramatically saves on enrichment and sequencing costs, and the inclusion of the DNA index permits each sample to be analyzed individually downstream. The method is an important inclusion in the range of next-generation sequencing applications below the level of whole exome resequencing but with the capability to sequence the exonic regions of hundreds of genes in tens of samples in a single sequencing experiment.Supplementary DataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis material is based on works supported by the Science Foundation Ireland (SFI/07/RFP/GEN/F327/EC07) and the Health Research Board (Ireland) (HRB/HRA/2009/45).Supplementary data"

IntroductionCircadian rhythms are endogenous biological oscillations with a period of 1 day, and they are controlled by an autonomous oscillator, the circadian clock.1 This clock regulates the timing of metabolism, physiology and behaviour of organisms, coordinating them with environmental factors that cycle with the rotation of the earth.1,2 The mechanisms of the eukaryotic clocks are proposed to be founded on interlocked autoregulatory loops between genes that function as components of the clock machinery, whereas the identities of these genes are largely different between animals, plants and fungi.3 In the model dicot Arabidopsis thaliana, a representative set of such component genes is the pseudo-response regulator (PRR) gene family, which comprises five member genes, TOC1 (also called PRR1)/PRR3/PRR5/PRR7/PRR9, which play regulatory roles at multiple nodes in the interlocked loops of the A. thaliana circadian network.4 All the PRR genes are, largely based on phenotypic analyses of mutants, supposed to be functionally important in the A. thaliana circadian system.5 Although phenotypic changes in a single mutation of each PRR gene are not large, combinations of mutations of different PRRs often result in stronger phenotypes, e.g. essentially arrhythmic in an extreme case.4PRRs share a conserved domain, the receiver-like domain (RLD), along with another domain CONSTANS/CONSTANS-LIKE/TOC1 (CCT). The RLD is similar to the receiver domain of the RRs in the histidine to aspartic acid (His–Asp) phosphorelay, a versatile signal transduction system in organisms from bacteria to eukaryotes other than animals.5,6 In the His–Asp phosphorelay, a phosphate group is transferred from a histidine kinase (HK), via an intermediate signal transducer histidine-containing phosphotransmitter (HPt), down to a counterpart RR, thereby transducing various environmental and endogenous signals intracellularly.6 An aspartic acid residue in the receiver domain of RRs is conserved as the phosphoacceptor site,6 whereas the RLDs of all the A. thaliana PRRs lack this aspartic acid residue, and they carry a glutamic acid instead.5,6 Consistent with this, Makino et al.7 showed that the RLD of TOC1 did not undergo phosphotransfer in vitro.Here, we hypothesize that the ancestors of PRRs were authentic RRs and they have lost the phosphorelay function through the course of evolution. If so, it is of particular interest to know in what evolutionary scenario PRRs lost the phosphorelay function, in order to understand the evolution of plant clock machineries. Homologue sequences of the A. thaliana PRR genes have recently been characterized in several other angiosperms.8–15 Importantly, Corellou et al.16 recently showed that the green alga Ostreococcus tauri has a PRR homologue sequence (OtTOC1) that functions as a master clock gene. The OtTOC1 protein carries a potential phosphoacceptor aspartic acid in its RLD,16 indicating that the substitution of the aspartic acid to the glutamic acid is likely to date back to the period between the emergence of the green alga and the divergence of angiosperms. It would be informative, therefore, to characterize their homologues from non-angiosperm land plants, which cover a wide spectrum of phylogenetic groups.17,18Physcomitrella patens, a species of Bryopsida (moss), one of the basal land plants,17,18 diverged from vascular plant lineages at least 450 million years ago.18 This moss is an attractive model plant because various molecular biology techniques such as targeted gene disruption have been well established.19 In a recent study, we isolated and characterized two P. patens cDNAs PpCCA1a and PpCCA1b encoding moss homologues of A. thaliana CCA1/LHY. CCA1/LHY is a pair of paralogous single myb proteins, which function as another type of important component proteins in the A. thaliana circadian network.3,4 Disruption experiments on PpCCA1a and PpCCA1b genes indicate that these two genes are functional counterparts of CCA1/LHY.20 We also identified four candidate genes that encode PRR homologues in the P. patens genome database.20–22 We isolated the full-length cDNA for one of these four moss PRR genes and showed that this gene is expressed in a circadian manner.20 Very recently, Holm et al.23 reported a survey of clock-associated genes on the P. patens genome database, including the four moss PRRs. They constructed an unrooted tree of plant PRR homologues, in which the four moss PRRs clustered independently from angiosperm PRR subfamilies.23In this study, we isolated and characterized cDNAs for the remaining three moss PRR genes, for which gene structures were so far predicted only from the genomic sequences. Using experimentally validated sequences of the moss PRR cDNAs, we constructed a rooted phylogenetic tree, thereby clearly defining the evolution of plant PRRs. We also conducted biochemical characterization and expression analyses of the moss PRRs; the results of these experiments suggest that at least one of the moss PRRs functions as an authentic RR and that there are intraspecific divergences among the moss PRRs. Finally, we will discuss scenarios of the evolution and divergence of PRR homologue genes in land plants.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materials, growth conditions and light treatmentPhyscomitrella patens ssp. patens24 was maintained in 12-h light and 12-h dark cycles (12:12LD) under white fluorescent light (light intensity ~40 µmol m-2 s-1) at 25°C. Protonemal and gametophore tissues were grown on BCDAT/G medium and BCD medium, respectively, both supplemented with 1 mM CaCl2.25 Protonemal cells were collected every 5–7 days and were ground with a homogenizer before application to new BCDAT agar plates. For light sources of the light induction experiments, the light-emitting diodes (STICK LED, Tokyo Rikakikai) were used for blue light (<U+03BB>max = 470 nm) and the red-emitting fluorescent tubes (FL20S-Re-66, Toshiba Lighting & Technology) filtered through a red plastic sheet (Acrylite102, Mitsubishi Rayon) for red light (<U+03BB>max = 660 nm). White light was provided by fluorescence lumps (FL20SS-W/18, Toshiba Lighting & Technology).2.2. Identification and isolation of cDNAs covering the entire coding regions of PpPRRsThe 5'- and 3'-terminal portions of the PpPRR2 and PpPRR4 cDNAs were RACE-amplified using GeneRacer (Invitrogen) with primers based on the JGI database sequences. The amplified cDNA fragments were cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) and sequenced with DYEenamic ET terminator [GE Healthcare (Former Amersham Biosciences)]. The middle region of each gene was amplified by RT-PCR with primers based on the RACE-amplified sequences. The entire regions of both cDNAs were amplified with KOD plus polymerase Ver.2 (TOYOBO), subjected to A-tailing by Taq polymerase (TAKARA Bio), cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector and sequenced using a primer walking method. The PpPRR3 cDNA that spans its entire coding region was amplified with KOD plus polymerase Ver.2 using primers based on the JGI database sequences. Nucleotide sequences were assembled by DNASIS software (Hitachi software engineering). All primer sets used are described in Supplementary file 1.2.3. Phylogenetic analysesAmino acid sequences of PRR homologues were aligned using the ClustalW program26 and the numbers of amino acid substitutions between each pair of PRR proteins were estimated by the Jones–Taylor–Thornton (JTT) model27 with the complete-deletion option. From the estimated numbers of amino acid substitutions, a phylogenetic tree was reconstructed using the minimum evolution (ME) method.28 The bootstrap values were calculated with 1000 replications.29 These procedures were all performed using MEGA4.1 software (http://www.megasoftware.net/index.html30). We also reconstructed a phylogenetic tree by the maximum-likelihood method using PhyML (http://atgc.lirmm.fr/phyml/31) applying the JTT model for amino acid substitutions. We obtained a similar phylogeny pattern with both the methods.2.4. Semi-quantitative and quantitative RT-PCR analysesSemi-quantitative RT-PCR (sqRT-PCR) analysis was performed as described previously.20 We conducted preliminary experiments to improve its quantitativeness as follows. First, thermal cycle numbers were optimized so that signals from PCR products did not reach a plateau. Next, we confirmed that when various known relative amounts of cDNA for each tested gene were used as PCR templates, the amount of the PCR product of each reaction showed a linear relationship with that of the input cDNA. The primers and optimal cycle numbers for PCR are described in Supplementary file 1. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis was performed as described previously.32 The primers are same as those used in the qRT-PCR analysis (Supplementary file 1).2.5. Construction of plasmidsTo express the PpPRR1 and PpPRR2 RLD peptides in E. coli cells, a cold shock expression system (pCold-II vector; TAKARA Bio) was used as follows. The coding region for the RLD of each PpPRR protein was PCR-amplified with primers described in Supplementary file 1. The resultant fragment was cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector, digested with KpnI and XbaI and inserted into KpnI–XbaI-cleaved pCold-II vector (pCold-II-His-PRR1 and pCold-II-His-PRR2 for PpPRR1 RLD and PpPRR2 RLD, respectively). The nucleotide sequence was determined by DYEenamic ET terminator. The RLD peptides are fused with a 6×His-tag, by expression from pCold-II vector, allowing their purification with a TALON™ metal affinity resin column as described below.2.6. Expression and purification of the PpPRR1 and PpPRR2 RLD peptidesThe E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) harbouring pG-KJE8 (TAKARA Bio), which encodes chaperone proteins DnaK, DnaJ, GrpE, GroEL and GroES, was transformed with pCold-II-His-PRR1 or pCold-II-His-PRR2. To overproduce the RLD peptides of PpPRR1 and PpPRR2, each transformant was cultivated in 1 l of LB medium containing ampicillin (50 µg ml-1), Chloramphenicol (25 µg ml-1), tetracycline (20 ng ml-1) and l-arabinose (10 mg ml-1) at 37°C until the logarithmic phase of growth in a rotary shaker (at 110 r.p.m.). They were cold-shocked by standing at 15°C for 30 min after the addition of IPTG at the final concentration of 1 mM and cultured in a shaker (at 110 r.p.m.) at 15°C for 5 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation and suspended in 20 ml of a standard buffer [50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl and 10% glycerol]. The cell suspension was mixed with DNase I (25 µg ml-1), EDTA (1.25 mM) and lysozyme (250 µg ml-1) at 4°C for 15 min, and then passed through a French Press at 100 MPa. The resultant cell lysate was centrifuged and separated from cell debris and then applied onto a TALON™ metal affinity resin (Clontech Laboratories) column. After washing the TALON™ column with 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0), 10% glycerol and 100 mM NaCl, each of 6×His-tagged PpPRR1 and PpPRR2 RLD peptides was eluted with the same buffer including 250 mM imidazole and finally dialysed against 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0) and 10% glycerol. Dialysed semi-purified protein was concentrated by loading on Amicon Ultra Filter (Ultracel-10K, Millipore) and centrifuged for 15 min at 4700 r.p.m. at 4°C. The sample was quantified by the Lowry method33 and subjected to SDS–PAGE and detected with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. It was also analysed by western blotting with anti-6×His antibodies (Cat. No. A190-114A, Bethyl Laboratories).2.7. Preparation of the E. coli ArcB-enriched cytoplasmic membraneEscherichia coli DAC903/pIA001-ArcB and DAC903/pIN-III were used as an ArcB overproducer and a negative control, respectively.34 From each strain, membrane vesicles were isolated and pelleted as an insoluble fraction of the cell lysate according to the method of Azuma et al.35 They were suspended in a small volume of a buffer comprising 50 mM Tris-acetate (pH 8.0), 1 mM DTT, 2% glycerol and 250 mM sucrose in order to isolate cytoplasmic membrane as follows. The suspended membrane vesicles were layered over a 21-ml five steps gradient of sucrose dissolved in the same buffer (3 ml of 50%, 9 ml of 45%, 3 ml of 40%, 3 ml of 35% and 3 ml of 30% from bottom to top) in a bottle assembly polycarbonate tube (part no. 355618, Beckman Coulter) and centrifuged at 47 000 r.p.m. for 2 h at 4°C with the type 50.2 Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter). The cytoplasmic membrane was collected by taking the fraction between the layers of 35 and 40% sucrose and diluted with a large volume of a buffer (TAGS-buffer) comprising 50 mM Tris-acetate (pH 7.8), 1 mM DTT, 10% glycerol, 100 mM sucrose. The cytoplasmic membrane was collected by centrifugation at 127 000g for 2 h and then resuspended in a small volume of TAGS-buffer. Finally, F1-ATPase was stripped from the cytoplasmic membrane as follows. The isolated cytoplasmic membrane (2 mg of protein) was treated with 1 ml of TAGS-buffer containing 4 M urea for 30 min on ice, and then recovered by centrifugation at 50 000 r.p.m. for 30 min. Then, the pellet was washed once with 1 ml of TGS buffer and finally with 1 ml of a buffer comprising 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mM DTT and 10% glycerol. The urea-treated cytoplasmic membrane was suspended in 0.5 ml of the same buffer and stored at -80°C.2.8. In vitro autophosphorylation assayIn vitro autophosphorylation reaction of the ArcB protein was carried out according to the method of Azuma et al.,35 4.0 µg of ArcB-enriched Escherichia coli cytoplasmic membrane was incubated with 0.05 mM <U+03B3>-[32P]-ATP (37 kBq) in TEG buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0, 0.35 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol) containing 5 mM MgCl2, 200 mM KCl and 2 mM DTT at 25°C for 1, 5 and 10 min. Four micrograms of E. coli cytoplasmic membrane, which was prepared from the strain which does not overproduce ArcB, was also used as a negative control experiment. The reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS–PAGE sample buffer [finally 20 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0), 1% ß-mercaptoethanol, 1% SDS, 6% glycerol and 0.02% Bromophenol Blue]. The samples were subjected to SDS–PAGE. The gel was dried and analysed with an imaging scanner (BAS-2500; Fuji Film).2.9. In vitro His–Asp phosphotransfer assayIn vitro His–Asp phosphotransfer reaction from ArcB to the RLD peptides of PpPRR1 and PpPRR2 was examined according to the method of Azuma et al.35 Four micrograms of E. coli ArcB-enriched cytoplasmic membrane was incubated with 0.05 mM <U+03B3>-[32P]-ATP (37 kBq) and 4.5 µg of semi-purified PpPRR1 or PpPRR2 RLD peptide in TEG buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0, 0.35 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol) containing 5 mM MgCl2, 200 mM KCl and 2 mM DTT at 25°C for 1, 5 and 10 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS–PAGE sample buffer. The samples were subjected to SDS–PAGE. The gel was dried and analysed with BAS-2500.3. Results3.1. Phylogenetic analyses of the moss PpPRR genesPreviously, we identified four PRR homologue genes, PpPRR1 (protein ID in the JGI P. patens database: 154145), PpPRR2 (165025), PpPRR3 (173125) and PpPRR4 (165029) in the JGI genome database.21 We characterized the PpPRR1 gene (and its corresponding cDNA) as ‘PpPRRa' before,20 but in this paper, we use the name ‘PpPRR1', not PpPRRa, to avoid confusion. Holm et al. also followed this nomenclature (PpPRR1–PpPRR4) deposited in the JGI genome database.21 Other than these four sequences, we found no gene models that are significantly similar to the angiosperm PRR genes in the moss genome. We isolated cDNAs that cover the entire coding regions for the PpPRR2, PpPRR3 and PpPRR4 genes and confirmed that all of their predicted proteins share, as do PpPRR1,20 an N-terminal RLD and a C-terminal CCT domain (Fig. 1a and b; Supplementary file 2). The receiver domains of authentic RRs share the aspartic acid–aspartic acid–lysine (DDK) motif, essential for the phosphotransfer activity,36,37 whereas the first two residues of this motif are diverged in the angiosperm PRR proteins (Fig. 1a; for review, see Mizuno and Nakamichi4 and Mizuno6). In all the available angiosperm PRR sequences, the second aspartic acid, conserved as the phosphoacceptor residue in the His–Asp phosphotransfer, is replaced by a glutamic acid (E) (Fig. 1a). In contrast, RLDs of moss PpPRR proteins are all predicted to retain the second aspartic acid; furthermore, PpPRR2, PpPRR3 and PpPRR4 also retain the first aspartic acid, hence exhibiting the complete DDK motif (Fig. 1a). PpPRR1 replaces the first aspartic acid residue with a tyrosine (Y) (Fig. 1a). These observations suggest that at least PpPRR2, PpPRR3 and PpPRR4 are potentially phosphorylated by a HK(s) as authentic RRs. The CCT domain is well conserved in all PpPRR proteins (Fig. 1b). Alignment of conserved domains of PRR homologues from various species. RLDs (a) and CCT domains (b) of PRR homologue sequences from various plant species are aligned using ClustalW program.26 Shading was performed using BOXSHADE ver 3.21 (http://www.ch.embnet.org/software/BOX_form.html). Amino acids identical or similar in more than 70% of the sequences are shaded by black or grey background, respectively. The number at the end of each line indicates the rightmost amino acid. Arrowheads show amino acids corresponding to the DDK motif.

We used the PRR homologue of the green alga O. tauri (OtTOC1)16 as the outgroup because: (i) OtTOC1 is positioned relatively distant from any other PRR homologue sequences in an unrooted tree of PRRs23; and (ii) OtTOC1 is sister to all the other PRR homologue sequences when an authentic RR sequence is used as the outgroup (Supplementary file 3). Also included were three algal sequences: two from C. reinhardtii and one from Chlorella variabilis. In the phylogenetic tree, the angiosperm sequences are divided, as previously reported,8,12,15 into three groups: TOC1, PRR7/3 and PRR9/5 (Fig. 2). The TOC1 group is basal to all the other sequences that include both PRR7/3 and PRR9/5 groups, indicating a more ancient origin of the TOC1 group than the other two groups. The four moss PpPRR sequences are grouped with one another, further forming a cluster with two lycophyte sequences, and this cluster is sister to the PRR7/3 group (Fig. 2). This indicates that the moss PpPRR genes are more closely related to the PRR7/3 group than to the two other groups. The four moss sequences are divided into two groups PpPRR1/PpPRR3 and PpPRR2/PpPRR4 (Fig. 2). Phylogenetic tree of PRR homologues in various plants. Amino acid sequences of PRR homologues including entire RLD and CCT domain regions were aligned using ClustalW program and the phylogenetic tree was reconstructed by the ME method28 by using MEGA4.1.30 The O. tauri PRR homologue (OtTOC116) was used as the outgroup.

For other sequences, refer to the legend for Fig. 1.Next, we compared the distribution of intron insertion sites on the RLD and CCT coding regions between PRR genes (Fig. 3). In the RLD region, two insertion sites are conserved among all the PRR sequences examined (Fig. 3a; see Takata et al.15). This distribution pattern of intron insertion sites is clearly different from those seen in the receiver domain of authentic RRs,13 confirming the idea that PRR genes diverged distinctly from authentic RR genes. In the CCT domain region, the TOC1 group sequences are unique in that they show no intron, whereas all sequences in the other two groups have a conserved single insertion site in the middle of the domain (Fig. 3b; see Takata et al.15). PpPRR sequences are divided into two groups, PpPRR1/PpPRR3 with one intron (like the PRR7/3 and PRR9/5 groups) and PpPRR2/PpPRR4 with no intron (like the TOC1 group; Fig. 3). This divergence is consistent with the results of the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 2), whereas the loss of an intron in PpPRR2/PpPRR4 should have occurred in the moss lineage independently from the TOC1 group (Fig. 2). Distribution of intron insertion sites on the conserved domains of PRR sequences. From the aligned amino acid sequences of PRR proteins, only three stretches [two from RLD (a) and one from CCT (b)] are shown, each consisting of nine amino acids with the amino acid corresponding to an intron insertion site (shaded in grey) being centred. The number of the rightmost amino acid of each stretch is indicated in parentheses. For the sequences used, refer to the legend of Fig. 2.Distribution of intron insertion sites on the conserved domains of PRR sequences. From the aligned amino acid sequences of PRR proteins, only three stretches [two from RLD (a) and one from CCT (b)] are shown, each consisting of nine amino acids with the amino acid corresponding to an intron insertion site (shaded in grey) being centred. The number of the rightmost amino acid of each stretch is indicated in parentheses. For the sequences used, refer to the legend of Fig. 2.3.2. In vitro phosphotransfer from a HK to the RLD of PpPRR2We examined whether RLDs of PpPRR1 and PpPRR2, both of which retain the potential phosphoacceptor residue while showing mutually diverged features (Figs 1–3), are phosphorylated by a His–Asp phosphorelay process in an in vitro phosphotransfer assay (Fig. 4). In this assay, ArcB, an E. coli HK, added in excess and hence lacking substrate specificity, transfers its phosphate to the phosphoacceptor site in a receiver domain. We purified the RLD peptides of PpPRR1 and PpPRR2 overexpressed in E. coli cells (Fig. 4b and c) and tested each of them to assess whether or not they undergo phosphotransfer. The PpPRR2 RLD peptide was phosphorylated within 5 min in the presence of ArcB (Fig. 4g). The phosphorylation levels of ArcB decreased concomitantly (Fig. 4g), indicating that the phosphorylation of PpPRR2 RLD is due to phosphotransfer from ArcB. On the other hand, we could not detect any phosphorylation signal with PpPRR1 RLD (Fig. 4f), consistent with its relatively diverged RLD sequence (Fig. 1a). When the PpPRR2 RLD peptide was incubated with the membrane fraction with no overexpressed ArcB, we could not detect the phosphorylation signal (Fig. 4h). This supports the interpretation that the increased levels of phosphorylation seen with the PpPRR2 RLD peptide (Fig. 4g) is due to phosphotransfer from ArcB, but not due to other types of kinases. These observations indicate that PpPRR2 presumably functions as an RR in an unknown His–Asp phosphorelay signal transduction pathway in P. patens. Moreover, PpPRRs likely diverged from one another based not only on their RLD sequences but also on their phosphotransfer ability. In vitro His–Asp phosphotransfer to the PpPRR2 RLD peptide. (a) Overproduction of ArcB in E. coli cells. The cytoplasmic membrane proteins were extracted from an ArcB overproducer (right lane) and a negative control strain of E. coli (left lane), subjected to SDS–PAGE and detected with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (C.B.B.)

Circadian regulation of PpPRR expression profilesIn a previous study,20 we reported that the PpPRR1 mRNA accumulation showed circadian variation in 12-h light and 12-h dark cycles (12:12LD) and in continuous darkness (DD), but not in continuous light (LL), by conducting sqRT-PCR analysis. Here, we studied mRNA accumulation profiles for all four PpPRR genes with the same method (Fig. 5). In 12:12LD, all genes showed high-amplitude mRNA rhythms with a period of ~1 day, which peaked in the latter half of the light phase (Fig. 5a). In DD, all genes showed endogenous rhythms with damping (Fig. 5b). These rhythms in 12:12LD or DD showed phase relationships roughly similar to A. thaliana PRR3, PRR5 or PRR7 genes.4,6 In LL, in contrast, all the genes exhibited no hint of circadian regulation and were arrhythmic as demonstrated for PpPRR1 (Fig. 5c; see Okada et al.20). The arrhythmic profiles in LL are consistent with our observations that the moss genes so far tested are, if clock gene homologues or clock-controlled genes, all arrhythmic in LL,38–40 and this is in contrast to angiosperm PRR genes, all of which show robust circadian rhythms in LL.4,6Changes in mRNA abundance for the PpPRR genes under 12:12LD, DD and LL conditions examined by the sqRT-PCR analysis. Physcomitrella patens protonemal cells were maintained in 12:12LD for more than 2 weeks after which cells were harvested in 12:12LD (a), DD (b) or LL (c) conditions at indicated times. From the top, changes in mRNA abundance for PpPRR1, PpPRR2, PpPRR3 and PpPRR4 are shown. Light conditions are overlaid with each graph: regions with no shade and those shaded with dark grey represent light and dark phases, respectively; regions shaded with light grey represent subjective light phases in (b) or subjective dark phases in (c). Graphs show the results of quantification of the mRNA levels for each gene after normalization to those for actin as a control.39 The maximum levels are set to 1.0. The photo below each graph shows the hybridized bands for each test gene or the control actin gene, detected as chemiluminescence signals. We obtained similar results in two independent experiments.Changes in mRNA abundance for the PpPRR genes under 12:12LD, DD and LL conditions examined by the sqRT-PCR analysis.

The photo below each graph shows the hybridized bands for each test gene or the control actin gene, detected as chemiluminescence signals. We obtained similar results in two independent experiments.The results of the sqRT-PCR experiments suggest that phases of the four genes seem to be differentially fine-tuned into two types: in 12:12LD, troughs of PpPRR1/PpPRR3 occurred 4 h before dawn, whereas those of PpPRR2/PpPRR4 just at dawn (Fig. 5a). We also measured mRNA accumulation for PpPRRs in one cycle of 12:12LD by the qRT-PCR analysis with a shorter sampling interval (Fig. 6). At ZT01 (ZT, zeitgeber time: time in a light–dark cycle, putting the light onset as ZT0), the levels of PpPRR1/PpPRR3 showed certain increase (30–40% of the maximum levels), whereas those of PpPRR2/PpPRR4 were still very close to zero (Fig. 6), confirming the distinction of expression profiles between PpPRR1/PpPRR3 and PpPRR2/PpPRR4. This differential fine-tuning appears to be conferred by the endogenous circadian clock, because the sampling of cells at dawn (Fig. 5a, hours 0 and 24) was performed in the absence of light. This idea is also supported by the rhythms of PpPRRs in DD, where endogenous clock regulation is more clearly seen: the first peaks of PpPRR2/PpPRR4 lagged behind those of PpPRR1/PpPRR3 by around 4 h (Fig. 5b; Supplementary file 4). Changes in mRNA abundance for the PpPRR genes for one 12:12LD cycle examined by the qRT-PCR analysis. Physcomitrella patens protonemal cells were maintained in 12:12LD for more than 2 weeks after which cells were harvested in one full cycle of 12:12LD at indicated times. Shown are the changes in mRNA abundance for PpPRR1 (a), PpPRR2 (b), PpPRR3 (c) and PpPRR4 (d). Light conditions are overlaid with each graph: regions with no shade and those shaded with dark grey represent light and dark phases, respectively. The graphs show the averages and the standard deviations of four independent experiments, in which the results of quantification of mRNA levels for each gene were normalized to those of actin as a control.39Changes in mRNA abundance for the PpPRR genes for one 12:12LD cycle examined by the qRT-PCR analysis.

Induction of PpPRR by lightWe examined the effect of light on the accumulation of the PpPRR mRNAs by sqRT-PCR analyses. The mRNAs of all four PpPRRs were induced by a 2-h pulse of white, blue or red light (Fig. 7). The rates of induction by white light are 8.7 for PpPRR1, 2.6 for PpPRR2, 6.2 for PpPRR3 and 2.5 for PpPRR4. The rates of induction for PpPRR1 and PpPRR3 are the highest and second highest, respectively, for any colour of light; this observation does not contradict the idea that there is an intraspecific divergence between PpPRR1/PpPRR3 and PpPRR2/PpPRR4. The rates of induction by blue light and red light are lower than those of white light for any PpPRR gene. Light-induced expression of the PpPRR genes examined by the sqRT-PCR analysis. Physcomitrella patens protonemal cells were maintained under LL for 1 week, exposed to darkness for 24 h, and 2 h of white light, blue light, red light or dark period was administered before the cells were sampled. The fluence rate of each colour or light was 40 µmol m-2 s-1. Total RNAs were extracted, and the abundances of PpPRR mRNAs were measured and normalized to those for actin as a control. The graph shows the mRNA levels of PpPRRs induced by different colour of light (white light, open bars; blue light, bars with horizontal hatches; red light, bars with vertical hatches) relative to those from samples maintained in the prolonged darkness, the latter of which are set to 1.0. Values are the mean ± SD of three replications. The bottom photos show the hybridized bands for PpPRRs (upper four slips) or the control actin gene for each PpPRR (lower four slips), detected as chemiluminescence signals.

We obtained similar results in two independent experiments.4. DiscussionThe results of the current study help to understand the origins of the angiosperm PRR genes. In our in vitro assay, the PpPRR2 RLD peptide underwent phosphotransfer (Fig. 4), consistent with its complete DDK motif (Fig. 1a), strongly suggesting that PpPRR2 functions as an RR. Besides, according to our phylogenetic tree (Fig. 2), PpPRRs are phylogenetically closely related to angiosperm PRRs. Therefore, it is presumed that the similarity of RLDs of PRRs to the authentic receiver domain is not only superficial but that PRRs were certainly derived from an authentic RR. Most probably, angiosperm PRRs have lost their phosphorelay function through the course of evolution, largely due to the substitution of the phosphoacceptor aspartic acid to a glutamic acid in their RLDs, and other critical residues such as the first aspartic acid of the DDK motif should have concomitantly diverged. Importantly, the O. tauri OtTOC1 and the C. reinhardtii CrPRR2 also share not only the potential phosphoacceptor aspartic acid but also the entire DDK motif (Fig. 1a; see Corellou et al.16). Although there has so far been no report about whether or not these algal proteins undergo phosphotransfer, they are also assumed to function as RRs, representing prototypic proteins of the land plant PRRs.Our results also offer evolutionary explanations not only for the origin but also for the diversity of PRRs in land plants (Fig. 8). The pattern of our tree indicates that the TOC1 group first diverged, and then split the PRR9/5 group and the other branch, the latter containing the PRR7/3 group. Since PpPRRs are positioned inside the branch containing the PRR7/3 group, the origins of the TOC1 and PRR9/5 groups date back before the divergence of moss from higher plant lineages. The ancient origin of the TOC1 group is supported by the observation that C. reinhardtii and C. variabilis seem to have a TOC1 ortholog (Fig. 2). Furthermore, since the cluster of PpPRRs and lycophyte SmPRR7a/7b is sister to all the angiosperm PRR7/3 sequences (Fig. 2), the divergence between the PRR7/3 group and the ancestor of PpPRRs and SmPRR7a/7b also predate the divergence of moss from higher plants. Therefore, the common ancestor of moss and higher plants possessed TOC1, PRR7/3 and PRR9/5 orthologues in its genome, but these genes appear to have been lost later within the moss lineage (Fig. 8). In the lycophyte lineage, PRR7/3 and PRR9/5 orthologues have been lost and the unique combination of the TOC1 (SmTOC1) and PpPRR (SmPRR7a/7b) orthologues still now remain (Fig. 8). In the angiosperm lineage, only PpPRR ortholog(s) has been lost, resulting in the current three PRR groups (Fig. 8). Concerning the timings of substitution of the phosphoacceptor residue, there are two alternative explanations. In one scenario (Fig. 8a), the phosphoacceptor aspartic acid residue of the PpPRRs and SmPRR7a/7b can be traced back to that found in the algal sequences; the phosphoacceptor residue in these sequences has never been substituted. This explanation might seem simple and more likely; however, if this were the case, the aspartic acid residue must have been substituted, according to the branching patterns of our tree, independently within each lineage of the TOC1, PRR7/3 and PRR9/5 groups (Figs 2 and 8a). In another scenario (Fig. 8b), simpler at least in terms of the frequency of substitutions, the aspartic acid was substituted only once to a glutamic acid before the divergence of all the land plant PRR subfamilies. In this case, an aspartic acid was regained by a second substitution in the ancestral lineage of PpPRRs and two lycophyte genes (Fig. 8b). If this were the case, PpPRR1 might be, again, in the process of divergence from authentic RR-type sequences. In order to know which hypothesis, or yet another scenario, is more plausible, we need more sequence data; in particular, PRR sequences should be characterized from other primitive plants, i.e. liverworts, hornworts, ferns and gymnosperms. Evolutionary scenarios for divergence of PpPRR genes in land plants. Two alternative explanations are presented: (a) scenario in which the phosphoacceptor aspartic acid residue in PpPRR and SmPRR7a/7b sequences has never been substituted and (b) scenario in which the aspartic acid was substituted to glutamic acid only once and it was regained by a second substitution in the ancestral lineage of PpPRRs and two lycophyte genes. Closed circles represent amino acid substitution events at the potential phosphoacceptor residue. Grey circles represent alternative timings of amino acid substitutions indicated by the closed circles.

Grey circles represent alternative timings of amino acid substitutions indicated by the closed circles. Crosses represent gene loss events (see the main text for detailed description).Our results demonstrate intraspecific divergences among the PpPRR genes. The phylogenetic tree (Fig. 2), intron insertion sites (Fig. 3) and expression profiles (Figs 5–7 and Supplementary file 4) suggest the divergence between PpPRR1/PpPRR3 and PpPRR2/PpPRR4. The A. thaliana PRR family members show differentially regulated expression profiles, reflecting the fact that they act at different nodes in the circadian network and functionally diverged from one another.4,6 Therefore, PpPRR1/PpPRR3 and PpPRR2/PpPRR4 are also predicted to be functionally diverged. It should be noted that Holm et al.23 did not detect any differential expression among the four genes in a light–dark cycle followed by DD. This may be because their light–dark regime is different from ours: they used a long day regime, a 16-h light and 8-h dark cycle, whereas ours is a 12-h light and 12-h dark cycle(s) (12:12LD; Figs 5 and 6). All PpPRRs are induced by light (Fig. 7), and this light responsiveness may have apparently synchronized the trough phases of PpPRRs with the earlier dawn in the short night of their long day regime, whereas difference in trough phases between PpPRR1/PpPRR3 and PpPRR2/PpPRR4 are obvious in our longer nights (Fig. 5a).On the other hand, the results of the in vitro assay (Fig. 4) and detailed sequence comparison (Fig. 1a) suggest that PpPRR2/PpPRR3/PpPRR4 function as RRs, whereas PpPRR1 does not or its phosphotransfer ability is very weak. The moss PpPRRs, if not all of them, are anticipated to have some clock-associated functions as do A. thaliana PRRs, from the following facts: (i) the circadian networks of A. thaliana and P. patens are predicted to be at least partially conserved20; and (ii) O. tauri, which belongs to green algae, the closest relative of land plants, has a PRR homologue that functions as a clock gene.16 Since RRs are generally involved in signalling cascades responsive to environmental/endogenous signals, PpPRR2/PpPRR3/PpPRR4 might function, rather than in the core clock circuitry, in an input pathway(s) that must be responsive to environmental cues such as light and temperature.In a future study, in parallel with gene knock out experiments, it should also be addressed whether PpPRRs are involved in phosphotransfer functions in planta. Moreover, a HK(s) and a HPt(s) that are partners to (at least some of) PpPRR proteins should be characterized. It might not be easy to identify a partner HK(s) because the P. patens genome contains as many as ~50 HK sequences,22 unlike A. thaliana, which contains only 8 HK genes.41 However, the availability of the entire genome sequence, many full-length cDNA clones and the tractability of gene functional analysis based on gene targeting techniques will support the identification of such HK and HPt genes in P. patens, possibly as novel clock genes.4.1. ConclusionHere, we demonstrated that the moss PpPRRs have close relationships with angiosperm PRRs and at least PpPRR2 can function as an RR, indicating that the plant clock-associated PRR families are derived from an authentic RR(s). Moreover, here, we offered evolutionary explanations for divergence of PRR genes in land plants. This study should be a foundation for understanding how a particular set of genes involved in regulation of the clock evolved their functions, in coordination with changes (or maintenance) of the clock mechanisms.4.2.

IntroductionChickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) is the third most consumed legume crop, which is cultivated in arid and semi-arid areas around the world.1 Chickpea is a self-pollinated, diploid (2n = 2x = 16) and annual plant with a moderate genome size of about 740 Mb. Despite growing demand and high-yield potential, chickpea productivity is very low. Several biotic such as Ascochyta blight, dry root rot, Fusarium wilt and pod borer, and abiotic such as drought, salinity and low temperature, constraints are major factors for lower chickpea production. Modern breeding technologies with biotechnological techniques are required to increase the productivity.2 Unfortunately, very limited genomic information is available for chickpea.Various genomic tools have facilitated greatly the development of improved genotypes/varieties in several crop species.3,4 Although a few expressed sequence tags (ESTs) have been generated and gene-based markers have been developed, the functional genomics studies in chickpea is still in its infancy. Most of the ESTs have been generated with the aim to identify the candidate genes involved in various abiotic and biotic stress responses and development of molecular markers.5–9 In addition, other microarray and SAGE technologies have also been used to identify the stress-responsive transcriptome in chickpea.10,11 The efforts have been made to clone genes of interest via candidate gene approach.2 The function of a few genes in stress responses has also been demonstrated using transgenic approach.12,13The generation of large-scale ESTs is a very useful approach to accelerate the research on non-model species. Although ESTs and other cDNA sequences are among the most reliable evidences for the identification of gene-rich regions in a genome, gene identification and genome annotation, very less effort has been made for chickpea in this direction when compared with other crop plants. This is reflected by a very small number of ESTs (34 587) present in the dbEST database at NCBI (release 100110; 1 October 2010) for chickpea. The next generation sequencing technologies provide a cost-effective means of sequencing the transcriptome of an organism.14 Several studies have reported the transcriptome sequencing of various model and non-model species using these technologies. However, most of these studies are based on the long-read sequence data using 454 pyrosequencing or employing hybrid approach.15,16 Although the efforts have been made to develop tools for de novo assembly using short-read sequence data,17–19 their use in transcriptome assembly has not been well demonstrated yet. Recently, the de novo assembly of human transcriptome has been reported using ABySS program.20 Here, we present a de novo assembly approach for transcriptome of a plant species using only short-read sequence data.The present study has two major goals. First, we report a strategy for de novo assembly of transcriptome using short-read sequence data and effect of sequence quality and various parameters. Secondly, we report for the first time the complete transcriptome of chickpea, the legume crop plant. We have generated millions of sequence reads from chickpea transcriptome sequencing. A non-redundant set of transcripts have been generated and various analyses, including GC content analysis, sequence similarity/conservation with other plant species, functional categorization and identification of simple sequence repeats (SSRs) have been done. Our data provide a very useful genomic resource for future studies in chickpea.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materialChickpea (C. arietinum L. genotype ICC4958) seeds procured from ICRISAT, Hyderabad, India, were grown as described.21 Root and shoot tissue samples were collected from the 15-day-old seedlings grown in autoclaved mixture (1:1) of agropeat and vermiculite in 3in. plastic pots at 22 ± 1°C in a culture room with a photoperiod of 14 h. The mature leaves and flower buds were collected from plants grown in the field. At least three independent biological replicates of each tissue sample were harvested and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen.2.2. RNA isolation and quality controlsTotal RNA was extracted from all the tissue samples using TRI Reagent (Sigma Life Science, USA) according to manufacturer's instructions. The quality and quantity of each RNA sample was assessed as described previously.21 Only the RNA samples with 260 of 280 ratio from 1.9 to 2.1, 260 of 230 ratio from 2.0 to 2.5 and RIN (RNA integrity number) more than 8.0, were used for the analysis.2.3. Illumina sequencing and quality controlsThree cDNA libraries were generated using mRNA-Seq assay for transcriptome sequencing on Illumina Genome Analyzer II platform. One paired-end (PE) cDNA library was generated from the pooled total RNA of shoot, root, mature leaf and flower buds in equal quantity and sequencing was done in one lane to generate 72 bp PE reads. Two cDNA libraries were generated one each from total RNA of root and shoot tissues and sequencing was done in one lane each to generate 51 bp single-end (SE) reads. The library construction and sequencing was performed by commercial service providers (PE, Genotypic Technology, Bangalore, India; SE, BC Cancer Agency Genome Sciences Centre, Vancouver, Canada). The sequence data generated in this study have been deposited at NCBI in the Short Read Archive database under the accession number SRA023503 (experiment accession numbers SRX025413 and SRX025414 for PE and SE read sequencing, respectively). Various quality controls, including filtering of high-quality reads based on the score value given in fastq files, removal of reads containing primer/adaptor sequences and trimming of read length were done using in-house tool kit (Patel and Jain, unpublished). We evaluated the effect of sequence quality on the de novo assembly of sequence reads.2.4. De novo assemblyAll the assemblies were performed on a server with 48cores and 128GB random access memory. We used various programs for de novo assembly of the PE and SE sequence reads to generate a non-redundant set of transcripts. Among the various programs available, we validated publicly available program, Velvet (version 0.7.62; http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~zerbino/velvet/), which have been developed for assembly of short reads using de Bruijn graph algorithm.17 Various assembly parameters were also optimized for best results. In addition, we used other publicly available programs, including Oases (version 0.1.8; http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~zerbino/oases/), ABySS (version 1.1.2; http://www.bcgsc.ca/platform/bioinfo/software/abyss)18 and SOAPdenovo (version 1.04; http://soap.genomics.org.cn/soapdenovo.html), and commercially available CLC Genomics workbench (version 3.7.1), which have also been developed for de novo assembly of short reads, to obtain best assembly results with our data set.2.5. Similarity search and functional annotationThe proteome data sets for all the completely sequenced plant genomes so far were downloaded from their respective genome project websites. For generating non-redundant unigene data sets from various legume species, including Glycine max (soybean), Medicago truncatula, Lotus japonicus, Vigna unguiculata and Pisum sativum, all the available EST and mRNA sequences were downloaded from Genbank and assembled using TGI Clustering Tool (TGICL) after removing/trimming contaminating vector sequences and short reads (<100 bp) using SeqClean. The parameters used for assembly were more than 95% identity over a minimum of 40 bases with maximum of 20 bases of unmatched overhangs at sequence end. The chickpea transcripts were searched against proteome sequences and legume unigenes sets using BLASTX and TBLASTX searches, respectively, with an expect (E)-value cut-off of =1E-05 to reveal sequence conservation.To deduce the putative function, chickpea non-redundant transcript data set was subjected to BLASTX analysis against the non-redundant protein database of UniProt and all annotated protein sequences of Arabidopsis (available at The Arabidopsis Information Resource). The results of only the best hit were extracted and the hits with an E-value = 1E-05 were considered to be significant. The GOSlim terms for molecular function, biological process, and cellular component categories associated with the best BLASTX hit with Arabidopsis protein were assigned to the corresponding chickpea transcript. For the identification of transcription factor families represented in chickpea transcriptome, the chickpea transcripts were searched against all the transcription factor protein sequences at Plant transcription factor database (PlnTFDB; http://plntfdb.bio.uni-potsdam.de/v3.0/downloads.php) using BLASTX with an E-value cut-off of =1E-05.2.6. GC content analysis and SSRs identificationGC content analysis was done using in-house perl scripts. The perl script program MISA (MIcroSAtellite; http://pgrc.ipk-gatersleben.de/misa/) was used for identification of SSRs. The repeats of mono-nucleotide more than 10 times, di-nucleotides repeats more than 6 times, tri-, tetra-, penta- and hexa-nucleotide repeats more than 5 times were considered as search criteria in MISA script.2.7. Mapping of sequence reads onto chickpea transcriptsWe mapped all the reads from three experiments onto the non-redundant set of transcripts to quantify the abundance of transcripts assembled, using CLC Genomics Workbench and Maq (v0.7.1; http://maq.sourceforge.net/index.shtml) softwares and the number of reads and reads per million (rpm) corresponding to each transcript were determined. In addition, the coverage of each transcript was determined in terms of number of reads per kilobase per million (rpkm).3. Results3.1. Sequencing of chickpea transcriptomeWe generated a total of 134 954 354 sequence reads, including 65 900 072 PE sequence reads (32 950 036 from each end) each 72 bp in length and 69 054 282 SE sequence reads each 51 bp in length, encompassing about 21GB of sequence data in fastq format (Table 1). We filtered the sequence data for low-quality reads at high stringency (reads with more than 30% of bases with Phred quality score of =20) and reads containing primer/adaptor sequence. This resulted in a total of 106 660 317 (79%) high-quality sequence reads, including 50 523 492 (76.7%) PE sequence reads each 72 bp in length and 56 136 825 (81.3%) SE sequence reads each 51 bp in length (Table 1). After filtering, the average quality score increased significantly at each base position of the sequence reads (Supplementary Fig. S1). The average quality score was more than 30 at each base position in all the three data sets except for last seven bases at the 3' end in PE data set. The final data set comprising ~107million very high-quality reads was used for optimization of de novo assembly and analysis of chickpea transcriptome (Supplementary Fig. S2). Summary of data generated for chickpea transcriptomeSummary of data generated for chickpea transcriptome3.2. De novo assemblyThe de novo assembly of chickpea transcriptome was optimized after assessing the effect of various assembly parameters, trimming bases at sequence read ends and different assembly programs as described below.The untrimmed high-quality sequence reads were assembled using Velvet program at different k-mer length of 21, 27, 31, 37, 41, 47, 51 and 57. We analysed various output parameters like number of used reads, nodes, total number of contigs, contigs longer than 100 bp, N50 length, longest contig length and average contig length as a function of k-mer length (Supplementary Table S1A; Fig. 1). The results suggested that k-mer length affects inversely to the number of contigs. We found the best assembly to be that for k = 47, as it resulted in highest N50 length of 675 bp, largest contig length of 7827 bp and largest average contig length of 432 bp (Fig. 1A). The assembly resulted in a total of 74 651 contigs of at least 100 bp length. The total number of reads used for the assembly was also highest (73.6%) for k = 47 (Supplementary Table S1). We assessed the effect of other parameters such as insert length and expected coverage on Velvet assembly at different k-mer length and did not find any significant effect (data not shown). Comparison of de novo assembly of three data sets using Velvet program as a function of k-mer length. The three data sets include (A) untrimmed data set (72 bp PE and 51 bp SE reads), (B) trimmed data set 1 (70 bp PE and 50 bp SE reads) and (C) trimmed data set 2 (65 bp PE and 50 bp SE reads). The bars indicate number of contigs 100 bp or longer (left axis). The lines indicate N50 length (rectangles) and average contig length (triangles) in bp (right axis).Comparison of de novo assembly of three data sets using Velvet program as a function of k-mer length. The three data sets include (A) untrimmed data set (72 bp PE and 51 bp SE reads), (B) trimmed data set 1 (70 bp PE and 50 bp SE reads) and (C) trimmed data set 2 (65 bp PE and 50 bp SE reads). The bars indicate number of contigs 100 bp or longer (left axis). The lines indicate N50 length (rectangles) and average contig length (triangles) in bp (right axis).To improve the quality of assembly and observe the effect of trimming of low-quality bases at the end of reads, we generated two trimmed data sets; first data set containing 70 bp PE (2 bp trimmed from 3' end) and 50 bp SE (1 bp trimmed from 3' end) sequence reads and second data set containing 65 bp PE (7 bp trimmed from 3' end) and 50 bp SE (1 bp trimmed from 3' end) sequence reads. We then assembled both these data sets also with different k-mer length using Velvet and noted various output parameters (Supplementary Table S1B and C; Fig. 1B and C). For first trimmed data set, the best assembly was for k = 47 with improved highest N50 length of 683 bp, largest contig length of 7666 bp and average contig length of 437 bp. The total number of contigs generated with at least 100 bp in length was 71 217 using 75% of the total reads. For the second trimmed data set, although the largest contig length was highest for k = 41 (10 616 bp), N50 length of 730 bp and average contig length of 453 bp were better for k = 47. The total number of contigs generated with at least 100 bp in length was 63 365 at k = 47 using highest number of total reads (77.8%). Taken together, we considered the assembly results of second trimmed data set for k = 47 as the best. The results show that the trimming of low-quality bases at the sequence read ends improved the assembly significantly.It has been suggested that assembly of Velvet followed by Oases yields better contigs/transcripts. The Oases program has been developed specifically for the de novo assembly of transcriptomes using short reads, which takes the assembly generated by Velvet as input and exploits the read sequence and pairing information to produce transcript isoforms. We performed assembly of contigs generated by Velvet for the second trimmed data set (k = 47) into transcripts using Oases with default parameters. This resulted in a total number of 59 178 transcript isoforms (=100 bp in length). The number of reads used increased by 5% in Oases (82.8%) when compared with Velvet (77.8%). Among these, 4232 transcripts were represented by 10 001 transcript isoforms, which might represent alternative splicing events. From the 59 178 transcript isoforms obtained by Oases assembly, a set of 53 409 non-redundant transcripts (including only the largest transcript isoform) was obtained with N50 length of 900 bp, largest contig length of 8173 bp and average contig length of 523 bp (Fig. 2A). In addition, we also performed assembly of above three data sets (untrimmed data set, trimmed data set 1 and trimmed data set 2) using CLC Genomics workbench. We obtained the best assembly results with the second trimmed data set with a total number of 113 893 contigs (=100 bp in length) with N50 length of 1151 bp, largest contig length of 15 684 bp and average contig length of 428 bp (Supplementary Table S2; Fig. 2A). Although N50 length was better in CLC Genomics Workbench, the average contig length was lower than that of Oases and total number of contigs generated was also much higher than expected (Fig. 2A). Further, the assembly of second trimmed data set using ABySS (k = 47) and SOAPdenovo (k = 31) programs generated 48 185 and 124 160 contigs, respectively, of at least 100 bp length. The N50 and average lengths for contigs generated by ABySS were 1192 and 613 bp, respectively, and that of contigs generated by SOAPdenovo were 525 and 340 bp, respectively (Fig. 2A).

The bars indicate number of contigs 100 bp or longer (left axis). The lines indicate N50 length (rectangles) and average contig length (triangles) in bp (right axis). (B and C) Percentage of contigs generated using Velvet, Oases, CLC Genomics Workbench, ABySS and SOAPdenovo showing significant hits with Arabidopsis (B) and soybean (C) proteins at different E-value cut-offs.Further, the validation of assembly output was done by BLASTX search of contigs/transcripts generated by various programs against Arabidopsis and soybean annotated proteomes. The significant hits were identified at different E-value cut-offs. The largest number of transcripts generated by Oases assembly showed significant similarity with Arabidopsis and soybean proteins at all E-value cut-offs when compared with the contigs generated by Velvet, CLC Genomics Workbench, ABySS and SOAPdenovo programs (Fig. 2B and C). Although the contigs generated by ABySS showed higher N50 and average lengths, lesser number and percentage of contigs showed significant similarity with Arabidopsis and soybean proteins. Overall, taken together, the assembly of second trimmed short-read data set obtained by Oases was found better than others and this non-redundant transcript data set (53 409) was analysed further. The statistics of the final assembly obtained from Oases program are given in Table 2. The comparative analysis of all (32 747) the ESTs and ESTs reported in various individual transcriptome studies,6–8 available at NCBI [after removing/trimming contaminating vector sequences and short reads (<100 bp) using SeqClean] with the above non-redundant transcript data set of chickpea showed that most (79% of the total and 74–88% of the individual EST data set reported in previous studies) of the ESTs are represented in our data set showing =90% identity over a length of =100 bp.

GC content analysis of chickpea transcriptomeGC content (ratio of guanine and cytosine) of all the chickpea transcripts along with soybean (legume reference), Arabidopsis (dicot reference) and rice (monocot reference) was determined. The average GC content of chickpea transcripts (40.3%) and soybean unigenes (40.9%) was little lower than that of Arabidopsis (42.5%). The average GC content in rice was much higher (55%) as reported previously as well.22 Although the average GC contents of chickpea and Arabidopsis were comparable, chickpea has a higher proportion of transcripts with GC content in range of 35–40% but lower proportion of transcripts with high GC content in range of 40–45% (Fig. 3). In addition, the range of GC content was broader in chickpea and soybean when compared with Arabidopsis (Fig. 3). A similar observation was found for the unigene sets from other legume species as well (data not shown). GC content analysis of chickpea transcripts. The average GC content of each transcript for chickpea, soybean, Arabidopsis and rice was calculated and percentage of transcripts with GC content within a range are represented.GC content analysis of chickpea transcripts. The average GC content of each transcript for chickpea, soybean, Arabidopsis and rice was calculated and percentage of transcripts with GC content within a range are represented.3.4. Identification of SSRsThe transcript/EST-based markers are important resource for determining functional genetic variation.23 Among the various molecular markers, SSRs are highly polymorphic, easier to develop and serve as rich resource of diversity. For identification of SSRs, all the chickpea transcripts were searched with perl script MISA. We identified a total of 4816 SSRs in 4180 (7.8%) transcripts of chickpea with frequency of one SSR per 5.80 kb of the sequence (Table 3). The mono-nucleotide SSRs represented the largest fraction (41.9%) of SSRs identified followed by tri-nucleotide (36.1%) and di-nucleotide (19.3%) SSRs. Although only a small fraction of tetra- (50), penta- (22) and hexa-nucleotide (58) SSRs were identified in chickpea transcripts, the number is quite significant.

Sequence similarity of chickpea transcripts with other plantsThe transcript set of chickpea was analysed for similarity/sequence conservation against the unigene data sets of various legumes species namely soybean, Medicago, Lotus, Vigna and Pisum using TBLASTX search. An E-value cut-off threshold of =1E-05 was considered to define a significant hit. The largest number (72.4%) of chickpea transcripts showed significant similarity with soybean unigenes followed by Medicago (69.5%), Lotus (65.5%), Vigna (60.1%) and the least similarity with Pisum (39.3%; Fig. 4A). Overall, a total of 43 516 (81.5%) of the chickpea transcripts showed significant similarity with at least one of the other legume unigenes. Likewise, we analysed the sequence conservation of chickpea transcripts with proteomes of all sequenced plant species. A total of 42 012 (79%) transcripts exhibited significant similarity with at least one of the predicted protein from sequenced plants. The largest number (75%) of chickpea transcripts showed significant similarity with soybean followed by Medicago (69%) and least with Physcomitrella (50%; Fig. 4B). As expected, lesser number of chickpea transcripts showed significant similarity with monocots (52–61%) when compared with dicots (65–75%). Although a large number of the chickpea transcripts showed significant similarity with predicted proteins from legumes, the extent of coverage of the coding region was quite less than expected. Only 28.4 and 29.5% of the transcripts which showed significant similarity covered =50% of the coding region of the predicted proteins from soybean and Medicago, respectively. Considering a high degree of conservation among legumes, it may be assumed that the assembly of chickpea transcriptome may further be improved as more sequence data become available.

(B) Sequence conservation of chickpea transcripts with annotated proteins of completely sequenced plant species. The percentage of transcripts showing significant similarity (E-value = 1E-05) in TBLASTX (A) and BLASTX (B) searches are shown.Further, the combined analysis of BLAST results with legume unigenes and plant proteomes revealed that a total of 45 636 (85.5%) transcripts were conserved in chickpea showing significant similarity with at least one sequence. Among these, 3624 (6.8%) transcripts were conserved only in legumes representing legume-specific genes. However, 7773 (14.5%) transcripts did not show significant similarity with any of the data set analysed, and may represent chickpea-specific genes.3.6. Functional annotation and characterization of chickpea transcriptsTo identify the putative function of chickpea transcripts, they were compared against the non-redundant protein sequences available at UniProt database and Arabidopsis proteins using BLASTX search. A total of 23 864 (44.7%) and 34 993 (65.5%) chickpea transcripts showed significant hit with UniProt and Arabidopsis proteins, respectively. Together, 35 279 (66.1%) transcripts showed significant hit with at least one UniProt or Arabidopsis protein. Broadly, the putative orthologs of genes involved in various pathways and cellular processes were found to be conserved in chickpea. In addition, many chickpea transcripts showed homology to uncharacterized proteins annotated as unknown, hypothetical and expressed proteins as well. Further, GO terms were assigned to chickpea transcripts, which showed significant similarity with Arabidopsis proteins annotated with GO terms. A total of 34 676 (64.9%) transcripts were assigned at least one GO term, among which 31 250 were assigned at least one GO term in biological process category, 31 598 in molecular function category and 30 264 in cellular component category. Among the various biological processes, ignoring unknown and other biological process categories, protein metabolism (19.5%) and developmental processes (15.6%) were most highly represented (Fig. 5). The genes involved in other important biological processes such as response to abiotic and biotic stimulus/stress, transport, transcription and signal transduction, were also identified through GO annotations. Similarly, transferase activity and hydrolase activity were most represented among the various molecular functions, and chloroplast and plasma membrane were most represented among the cellular component categories (Fig. 5). Further, we identified transcription factor encoding transcripts by sequence comparison to known transcription factor gene families. In total, 6577 putative chickpea transcription factor genes, distributed in at least 57 families, were identified representing 12.3% of chickpea transcripts (Fig. 6). The overall distribution of transcription factor encoding transcripts among the various known protein families is very similar with that of soybean and other legumes as predicted earlier.24,25 However, a few families showed the events of expansion (for example, Aux/IAA-ARF, bHLH, C3H, MADS, NAC, PHD and RWP-RK etc.) and contraction (for example, C2C2 zinc finger, CCAAT, LIM and MYB etc.) indicating their evolutionary significance (Supplementary Table S3). In fact, the number of predicted transcription factor encoding genes in Medicago and Lotus are very less when compared with soybean.24,25 As the complete genome sequence is available only for soybean as of now, the complete picture about evolution of various transcription factor families will emerge once the complete genome sequences and analyses thereof will be available for other legume species too.

Quantification of chickpea transcriptsThe digital expression profiling, also called RNA-Seq, is a powerful and efficient approach for gene expression analysis.26,27 The mapping of all the reads onto the non-redundant set of chickpea transcripts revealed that the number of reads corresponding to each transcript ranged from 14 (0.16 rpm) to 270 894 (3,137.3 rpm) with an average of 1617 reads (18.7 rpm) per transcript, indicating a very wide range of expression levels of chickpea transcripts (Supplementary Table S4). It also indicates that very low expressed chickpea transcripts are also represented in our assembly. The minimum coverage (rpkm) of a chickpea transcript was 1.2 and maximum of 9015.1 with an average of 25.7 (Table 2). Further, we analysed the expression of chickpea transcripts in root, shoot and pooled (root, shoot, mature leaf and flower bud) tissue samples. The mapping of reads on the chickpea transcript data set revealed that a total of 1974 and 1174 transcripts are not represented in the root and shoot tissue sequence data sets, respectively. Among these, 420 transcripts have no read mapped from root and shoot data sets, indicating their expression in mature leaf and/or flower buds (Supplementary Table S4). Further, another 250 transcripts were found to have root-specific expression, as they have no read mapped from shoot data set and at least 3 rpm mapped from root data set (Supplementary Table S4). Likewise, another 217 transcripts were found to have shoot-specific expression, as they have no read mapped from root data set and at least 3 rpm mapped from shoot data set (Supplementary Table S4). However, their expression in other chickpea tissues not analysed in this study is not ruled out.4. DiscussionThe transcriptome sequencing enables various functional genomic studies for an organism. Although several high throughput technologies have been developed for rapid sequencing and characterization of transcriptomes, expressed sequence data are still not available for many organisms, including crop plants. The next generation sequencing technologies provide a low cost, labour saving and rapid means of transcriptome sequencing and characterization.14 Similar to sequencing technologies, many bioinformatics tools have also been developed for the short-read sequence data assembly and analysis,17,18 but the requisite knowledge is very limited. The de novo assembly of short reads without a known reference is considered difficult.28 Therefore, the use of more expensive 454 Life Sciences (Roche) technology is used for non-model organisms, which produces longer sequence reads.15 However, the de novo assembly of transcriptomes using short reads has also received attention.20,29 In this study, we demonstrate a strategy for de novo assembly of transcriptome using short reads for a non-model crop plant, chickpea, for which sequence data is very limited so far in the public databases. We showed that there is significant effect of the assembly program parameters and sequence quality on the assembly output. A larger N50 length and average length are considered indicative of better assembly. Our results show that N50 length of the contigs generated using Velvet assembly program varied greatly as a function of k-mer length and increased from 675 bp for untrimmed data set to 730 bp after trimming low-quality bases. Hence, we suggest that the optimization of program parameters and trimming of low-quality bases at the ends of sequence reads might improve the assembly output significantly. In addition, the validation of different assembly programs is also required to get the optimum results. We found the assembly of Velvet followed by Oases program better than that of Velvet alone, CLC Genomics Workbench, ABySS and SOAPdenovo programs based on various assessment parameters such as N50 length, average contig length and sequence similarity with closely related species.Chickpea is one of the most important legume crop plants rich in proteins, carbohydrates and other nutrients, which makes it very important target for genomic studies.1,2 For the model legumes such as soybean, Medicago and Lotus, genome sequencing has been nearly completed and a vast collection of ESTs are available for functional genomic studies.25,30–32 However, very few genomic resources, including genome sequence, EST sequences and molecular markers are available for chickpea so far when compared with other legumes. We have generated more than 100million sequence reads for chickpea and report a non-redundant set of 53 409 transcripts representing about 28 Mb sequence and 3.8% of the chickpea genome. The coverage of chickpea transcripts was quite high (average of 25.7 rpkm), which is very crucial for quality and length of transcripts obtained. The GC content analysis revealed that chickpea transcripts have a low GC content similar to other dicots. However, the GC content range was broader when compared with other dicots which cover a narrow GC range.33 The GC content analysis provide insights into various aspects related to genome of an organism, including evolution, gene structure (intron size and number), thermostability and gene regulation.22,34,35 We identified a large number of SSRs in the chickpea transcripts. The number of tri-nucleotide SSRs was much higher than di-nucleotide SSRs. Earlier studies have also reported the higher number of tri-nucleotide SSRs when compared with di-nucleotide SSRs in ESTs than genomic sequences.23,36 However, recently the larger number of di-nucleotide SSRs than tri-nucleotide SSRs has been reported in pigeonpea ESTs.37 The frequency and distribution of SSRs have been proposed to be dependent on various factors such as size of data set, tools and criteria used.23 The identification of SSRs provides a very cost-effective option to develop functional markers for various marker-assisted breeding purposes.The analysis of sequence conservation helps in transfer of knowledge from model plants to chickpea for functional genomic studies. A large number (60–72%) of chickpea transcripts showed significant similarity with legumes at protein level as expected except for Pisum, indicating that their function might also be conserved. The low similarity with Pisum unigenes may be due to the availability of lesser number of sequences. The low similarity of chickpea transcripts with monocot proteomes when compared with dicot proteomes is also not unexpected due to the phylogenetic divergence of monocots and dicots during evolution. A significant number of transcripts were found to be conserved only in legumes, which may perform legume-specific functions. Interestingly, about 15% of the transcripts did not show significant homology with any other sequences, which may be novel and perform species-specific functions. The lineage- and species-specific genes have been identified in other plant species, including legumes as well.38–40 The study of these genes will be very important to dissect the lineage- or species-specific cellular processes and study evolutionary processes such as speciation and adaptation. Further, the chickpea transcripts were found to belong to various functional categories conserved in other plants also. However, overrepresentation of few functional categories might provide a clue towards specific functions/pathways operative in legumes or chickpea. Likewise, the conservation of transcription factor families indicates the presence of conserved gene regulatory machinery in chickpea. However, the lineage- and/or species-specific evolutionary expansion and contraction along with unique gene expression patterns of some of transcription factors may contribute to the legume-specific traits.In conclusion, we have demonstrated the use of short-read sequence data to rapidly characterize a draft transcriptome of an organism. The strategy of de novo assembly described here can be potentially used for any species. In addition, our study contributes a significant non-redundant set of 53 409 transcripts in chickpea. The detailed analyses of the data set has provided several important features of chickpea transcriptome such as GC content, conserved genes across legumes and other plant species, assignment of functional categories and identification of SSRs. It is anticipated that this study is a significant contribution towards development of genomic resources for chickpea and will accelerate functional genomic studies and breeding programmes.Supplementary DataSupplementary Data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis study was supported financially by the Department of Biotechnology, Government of India, New Delhi, under the Next Generation Challenge Programme on Chickpea Genomics.Supplementary data"

IntroductionTo reconcile increasing energy consumption with worsening global environmental conditions is a fundamental concern of the contemporary society. Fossil fuel deposits are rapidly diminishing, and their consumption raises carbon dioxide discharge levels. Alternative fuels, such as bioethanol and biodiesel, show great promise for alleviating the problems caused by the consumption of fossil fuel.Jatropha curcas L. is a plant belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae that is endemic to tropical America. It is now grown commercially in tropical and subtropical Africa and Asia. Jatropha has considerable potential for various uses including biofuels.1 The plant can grow at rainfall levels as low as 200 mm per annum.2 Medicinal compounds are found in various parts of the plant,1 but it is the potentially high yield of oil per unit land area, which is second only to oil palm,3 that makes Jatropha an outstanding biofuel plant. Furthermore, the quality of oil in its seeds is suitable for production of biodiesel as they contain more than 75% unsaturated fatty acids.4 Despite its cultivation throughout the tropical and subtropical world, the positive attributes of this plant are not fully understood in terms of breeding and utilization.3 This can be attributed mainly to the lack of information on its genetics and genomics. The genome size (~410 Mb) and the base composition have been estimated by flow cytometry, and karyotypes have been characterized.5 Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from developing and germinating Jatropha seeds have been reported.6 However, no further information on the genomic structure of J. curcas is available.To understand the genetic system of this plant and to accelerate the process of molecular breeding, we analysed the structure of the whole genome of J. curcas. For genome sequencing, we adopted a combination of BAC end sequencing and shotgun sequencing by the conventional Sanger method and the new-generation multiplex methods, which was followed by information analyses. In addition, microsatellite markers have been developed using the sequence information, and polymorphism among various J. curcas varieties was examined. The information and material resources for the Jatropha genome generated in this study will enhance both fundamental and applied research with J. curcas and related plants.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materialsA J. curcas line originating from the Palawan Island in the Philippines was subjected to genome sequencing. The following 12 lines were used for diversity analysis: Palawan, Indonesia, Indonesia IS, Thai, Chinese, Mexico 2b, Guatemala 1, Guatemala 2, Tanzania, Madagascar, Cape Verde, and Uganda. The Indonesia IS and Thai lines were purchased from IS Co. Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan) and Nikko-Seed Co. Ltd. (Tochigi, Japan), respectively. The Uganda and the remaining nine lines were kindly provided by BBL International (Osaka, Japan) and Nippon Biodiesel Fuel Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan), respectively.2.2. Construction of BAC librariesBAC genomic libraries were constructed using the genomic DNA of J. curcas partially digested with either MboI or HindIII and Copy Control pCC1BAC as a cloning vector. The average insert size of these libraries was 80.2 kb for the MboI library and 94.9 and 63.4 kb for two independent preparations of the HindIII libraries. Both libraries covered the haploid genome 9.2 times in total.2.3. BAC sequencingTo analyse end sequences, BAC DNAs were amplified using a TempliPhi large construction kit (GE Healthcare, UK), and the end sequences were analysed according to the Sanger method using a cycle sequencing kit (Big Dye-terminator kit, Applied Biosystems, USA) with DNA sequencer type 3730xl (Applied Biosystems). High-quality BAC sequences were determined by the shotgun method using the Sanger sequencing protocol, as described previously.72.4. Shotgun genomic sequencingFor sequencing by the Sanger method, shotgun libraries with average insert sizes of 2.5 kb were generated using pBluescript SK- as a cloning vector, and these were used to transform Escherichia coli ElectroTen-Blue (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The shotgun clones were propagated in microtiter plates, and the plasmid DNA was amplified using a TempliPhi kit (GE Healthcare). Sequencing was performed using a cycle sequencing kit (Big Dye-terminator Cycle Sequencing kit, Applied Biosystems) with DNA sequencer type 3730xl (Applied Biosystems) or DeNOVA-5000HT (Shimadzu Co., Japan) according to the protocols recommended by the manufacturers.High-throughput multiplex sequencing was carried out using a Genome Sequencer (GS) FLX Instrument (Roche Diagnostics, USA) and Genome Analyzer II (Illumina Inc., USA) sequencers. A 5-µg sample of Jatropha total cellular DNA was sheared by nebulization and subjected to library preparation followed by shotgun sequencing using the GS FLX platform. For the 3-kb paired-end sequencing, the library was prepared using GS Titanium Library Paired End Adaptors according to the manufacturer's instructions. For sequencing by an Illumina-solexa GAII sequencer, the sample was prepared according to the manufacturer's manual. Briefly, 1 µg of the total cellular genomic DNA was fragmented by the Covaris S1 instrument (Covaris Inc.). The fragmented DNA was repaired, and the adapters for paired-end sequencing (36, 51, and 76 cycles) were then ligated to the repaired DNA fragment. The size-selected fragment (300–350 bp) by agarose gel electrophoresis was PCR amplified, and the PCR product was validated using a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) and a 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR system (ABI). The sample was then run on a Genome Analyzer II using the 36 cycles sequencing kits. Base-calling was performed using the Genome Analyzer Pipeline.2.5. cDNA sequencingTotal RNA was extracted from leaf and callus tissue using an RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany). mRNA was purified from the total RNA using Oligotex-dT30 (Takara Bio Inc., Japan). Sequencing was performed with a GS FLX Instrument (Roche Diagnostics) using the cDNA rapid library method according to the manufacturer's instructions.2.6. Assembly of sequence dataReconstruction of the genome sequence of J. curcas was performed in the following two steps: assembly of sequence data generated by different types of DNA sequencers, and scaffolding and base correction.The sequence data collected according to the Sanger protocol using a 3730xl capillary sequencer were subjected to trimming of sequences derived from cloning vectors with the Figaro and Lucy programs,8 followed by assembly with the PCAP.rep program.9 Base-calling of the sequence data generated by pyrosequencing using a GS FLX sequencer was performed using the Pyrobayes program.10 The sequence reads artificially replicated during an emulsion PCR were removed by a 454 replicate filter,11 and the remaining reads were assembled using MIRA version 3 rc4 software.12 Contigs and singlets generated by assembly using the Sanger protocol and pyrosequencing were separately subjected to similarity searches for sequences of the chloroplast (GenBank: FJ695500) of J. curcas and the mitochondria (GenBank: Y08501) of Arabidopsis thaliana13 using the Megablast program.14 Matching sequences were then removed. All remaining contigs and singlets were assembled using the PCAP.rep program.9 BAC end sequences in which the vector sequences were trimmed by Figaro and Lucy programs8 in advance were further integrated in the resulting sequences using PCAP.rep.9 Then, sequences 99 bp and shorter were removed.The resulting contigs and singlets were designated as follows. The contigs containing sequences from the Sanger sequencing, pyrosequencing, and BAC end sequencing were prefixed with ‘JcCA’ followed by a seven-digit number. The contigs containing sequences from both the Sanger and 454 sequencing were prefixed with ‘JcCB’ followed by a seven-digit number. The contigs containing sequences from the Sanger sequencing and the pyrosequencing were prefixed with ‘JcCC’ and ‘JcCD', respectively. The singlets from the Sanger sequencing and pyrosequencing that were not assembled into other sequences throughout the whole process were prefixed with ‘JcSR’ and ‘JcPR', respectively.For improvement of data quality, both single and mate-pair reads by an Illumina GAII sequencer were collected and assembled using the Velvet program.15 The resulting contig sequences were mapped onto the contigs generated by hybrid assembly to correct the short insertion–deletion (indels) errors.Both paired-end reads of the genomic DNA and single reads of cDNAs by the GS FLX sequencer were used for scaffolding. Paired-end reads of the genomic DNA were assembled with the MIRA program12 according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the resulting sequences were used for scaffolding of the contig sequences generated by the Sanger sequencing and pyrosequencing using the GS reference mapper ver. 2.3 program. In parallel, a mixture of cDNAs derived from leaf and callus tissue of Jatropha was subjected to sequencing by GS FLX, and the data obtained were subjected to assembly with the MIRA ver. 3.0.5 program in the EST mode.12 In addition, the resulting cDNA sequences as well as the Jatropha ESTs retrieved from public DNA databases were used for scaffolding using the Blat program.162.7. Gene assignmentGene prediction and modelling were performed by automatic gene assignment programs that employ ab initio gene finding and similarity searches. For ab initio gene finding, predictions of protein-coding regions were carried out using GeneMark.hmm17 and Genescan18 programs with the matrix trained by an A. thaliana gene set, and predictions of exon–intron structure were performed using NetGene219 and SplicePredictor20 programs. Similarity searches for potential protein-coding regions and all contigs were performed against a Uniref database (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/uniref/) using Blastp and Blastx programs21 with a cut-off (E-value = 1e-3). The exon–intron structure of potential protein-coding regions and the contigs homologous to the Uniref database (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/uniref/) were predicted using the Nap program.22 Suitable exon-intron structures were determined by considering all the information above. The predicted gene structures were further confirmed by comparison to cDNA sequences analysed in this study. The protein-coding genes assigned in this manner were denoted by IDs with the contig names followed by sequential numbers from one end to another. They were classified into four categories based on sequence similarity to registered genes: genes with complete structure, pseudogenes, genes with partial structure, and transposons/retrotranspons.2.8. Functional assignment and classification of potential protein-coding genesTo assign the gene families, functional domains, GO terms, and GO accession numbers,23 the predicted genes were searched against InterPro using InterProScan24 software. Genes with an E-value of <1.0 were taken into account. GO terms were grouped into plant GO slim categories using the map2slim program (http://www.geneontology.org/GO.slims.shtml).The predicted protein-encoding genes were mapped onto KEGG metabolic pathways25 using the Blastp program21 against the GENES database.25 Thresholds of amino acid sequence identity =25% and of length coverage of the query sequence =50% with a cut-off (E-value = 1e-10) were applied.2.9. Phylogenetic analysisEvolutionary relationships of proteins of casben synthase genes, disease resistance genes, MADS-box genes, flowering genes, and COL genes were analysed using predicted amino acid sequences from different databases aligned with the program CLUSTALW (Ver. 1.83).26 Evolutionary relationships were inferred using a neighbour-joining algorithm.27 All positions containing alignment gaps and missing data were eliminated only in pairwise sequence comparisons. Phylogenetic trees were constructed with MEGA4 software.282.10. Polymorphism analysisMicrosatellite or simple sequence repeats (SSRs) 15 nucleotides in length, containing all possible combinations of di-nucleotide (NN), tri-nucleotide (NNN) and tetra-nucleotide (NNNN) repeat, were identified from the Jatropha genome sequences using the SSRIT (SSR Identification Tool) program.29 Primer pairs for amplification of SSR-containing regions were designed based on the flanking sequences of each SSR with the Primer 3 program30 so that amplified fragment sizes were between 90 and 300 bp in length. One hundred microsatellite markers were subjected to examination of polymorphisms among 12 lines of J. curcas.3. Results and discussion3.1. Sequence analysis of the Jatropha genomeThe strategy and the status of sequencing and assembly are summarized in Fig. 1. Briefly, the 1 025 000 reads of the Sanger sequencing and the 2 312 828 reads of pyrosequencing, which were appropriately processed in advance as indicated in Fig. 1, were independently assembled using the PCAP.rep9 and MIRA programs,12 respectively. The resulting contigs and singlets were subjected to hybrid assembly by PCAP.rep,9 and the 53 000 BAC end sequences were further integrated. The strategy and status of sequencing and assembly.The strategy and status of sequencing and assembly.For improvement of data quality, 86 028 428 (36 bases long from each end for each read) and 96 580 336 short-reads (50 and 31 bases long from each end for each read) by mate-pair sequencing with the Illumina GAII sequencer were assembled into 569 576 contigs (total length: 75 539 079 bp) by the Velvet program.15 The resulting contig sequences were mapped onto those generated by hybrid assembly to correct short indels errors. These indels were probably attributed to classified insertions, deletions, and mismatches by their association with miscall from homopolymer effects. As a result of mapping, 7459 loci on the 5025 contigs were revised.A total of 695 928 3-kb paired-end reads by the GS FLX sequencer were used for scaffolding of the generated contigs and singlets using the GS reference mapper ver. 2.3 program, as described in the ‘Materials and Methods’ section. In parallel, 991 050 reads of cDNA sequences by pyrosequencing were collected; 534 137 were derived from leaf tissue and 456 913 from callus tissue. The cDNA sequences were assembled with MIRA 3.05 in the EST mode,12 and 21 225 unigene sets were generated consisting of 13 610 contigs and 7615 singlets used for scaffolding by the BLAT program.16 In addition, unigenes generated from 26 447 ESTs registered in public DNA databases (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbEST/) were also used for scaffolding. As a result of scaffolding, the 44 153 contigs and singlets constructed by hybrid assembly were integrated into 15 300 scaffolds. The total length of the scaffolds was 129 291 074 bp. The longest scaffold (JcS_100001) had 56 042 bp, and the average scaffold length was 8450 bp. The constructed scaffolds were designated as JcS followed by sequential numbers.The total length of the final genomic sequences of J. curcas obtained was 285 858 490 bp, consisting of 120 586 contigs (276 710 623 bp total) and 29 831 singlets (9 147 867 bp total), which is ~70 and 75% of the whole genome of 4105 and 380 Mb (N. Wada, unpublished result), respectively, estimated by flow cytometry. The average length of contigs and singlets was 1900 bp. Statistics of the assembly are summarized in Table 1. The longest contig was 29 744 bp, and N50 length was 3833 bp. The distribution of contig lengths is shown in the Supplementary Fig. S1. The average G + C content of the contigs was 34.3%. Assembly statisticsAssembly statisticsCoverage of gene space in the Jatropha genomic sequences was estimated roughly by surveying the matched non-redundant cDNA sequences obtained in this study. Of 21 225 non-redundant cDNA sequences and 26 447 EST sequences in the public databases, 45 029 matched Jatropha genomic sequences with an identity of 95% or more for a stretch of 50 nucleotides, suggesting that 95% of the gene space in the Jatropha genome was covered by the genomic sequences in this study.We adopted here the sequencing strategy that combines the conventional Sanger method and the new-generation multiplex sequencing methods with the aid of various computer software for assembly. This strategy is superior in that shortcomings of respective methods are compensated by each other, enabling acquisition of sequences of higher quality in lower cost within a shorter period of time, thus is becoming popular for genome sequencing in both bacteria and eukaryotes.3.2. Characteristic features of the genomeA total of 41 428 di-, tri-, and tetra-nucleotide SSRs =15 bp were identified in the Jatropha genomic sequences (Supplementary Table S1). The frequency of the occurrence of these SSRs was estimated to be one SSR in every 7.0 kb in the 289 Mb sequences of the Jatropha genome. The di-, tri-, and tetra-nucleotide SSRs accounted for 46.3, 34.3, and 19.4% of the identified SSRs, respectively (Supplementary Table S1). The SSR patterns that appeared frequently were (AT)n, (AAT)n, and (AAAT)n, each representing 71% of di-nucleotide, 60% of tri-nucleotide, and 58% of tetra-nucleotide repeat units, respectively. The tri-nucleotide SSRs, particularly (AAG)n and (AGC)n, were preferentially found in exons. (AT)n, (AG)n, and (AAT)n were enriched in 5' and 3' untranslated regions, and (AC)n frequently occurred in introns (Supplementary Table S1).A search of the Jatropha genomic sequences using the repeat sequence finding program RECON31 unravelled the occurrence of a variety of repeat elements including class I and class II transposable element (TE) subfamilies and some that were difficult to classify into known subfamilies. Composition of these repeat sequences was analysed with the RepeatMasker program (http://repeatmasker.org/); the results are summarized in Table 2. The identified repetitive sequences in total occupied 36.6% of the Jatropha genomic sequences. The most abundant repeat category was class I TE (29.9%), in which Gypsy type (19.6%) and Copia type (8.0%) LTR retroelements constituted major components. Repetitive sequences in the Jatropha genomic sequencesRepetitive sequences in the Jatropha genomic sequencesA combination of computer prediction and similarity searches of the structural RNA sequence library resulted in identification of 597 putative genes for transfer RNAs in the Jatropha genomic sequences. Although 80 of these were likely to be pseudogenes, the remaining 517 could code for intact tRNAs with 54 species of anticodons (Supplementary Table S2). This is sufficient for translation of all the amino acids based on the universal codon table.A total of 65 genes for snRNAs were assigned by referring to the list of A. thaliana snRNAs (Supplementary Table S3).32 Some of these genes were found on the same contigs and scaffolds; thus, they are likely to form clusters in the genome, as they do in A. thaliana.3.3. Characteristic features of protein-encoding genesThe Jatropha genomic sequences were subjected to an automatic assignment of protein-encoding genes, and a total of 40 929 genes, besides 16 447 transposon-related genes, were assigned. Complete structures were predicted for 9870 genes, but only partial structures were predicted for 17 863 genes. In addition, 1960 and 11 236 genes were likely to be pseudogenes with complete and truncated structures, respectively. Of the 40 929 presumptive protein-encoding genes, 15 573 (38.0%) carried ESTs with sequence identity of 95% or more for a stretch of 50 nucleotides.Structural features of the protein-encoding genes in J. curcas were investigated in detail for 146 genes predicted on the 17 BAC clones (1.36 Mb in total) for which high-quality sequences were obtained by manual finishing and annotation (Supplementary Table S4). As shown in Supplementary Table S5, the basic structures of the protein-encoding genes in J. curcas are similar to those of A. thaliana except for the average lengths of genes and introns: 3064 versus 1918 bp and 356 versus 157 bp in J. curcas and A. thaliana, respectively.A similarity search of translated amino acid sequences of the 40 929 presumptive protein-encoding genes was performed using the TrEMBL database as a protein sequence library.33 The results indicated that 31 822 (77.7%) genes had significant (E-value = 1e-20) sequence similarity to those in this database. Of these genes, 13 067 (41.0%) genes showed sequence similarities to those in a public EST database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbEST/) with a cut-off (E-value = 1e-20) using tBLASTN.The 40 929 presumptive protein-encoding genes assigned in J. curcas and those in castor bean (Ricinus communis; 31 221 genes),34 which belongs to the same family as Jatropha, and A. thaliana (32 615 genes), were classified into plant GO slim categories35 for comparison (Fig. 2). The percentage of the number of genes classified into each GO slim category (i.e. ‘biological process’, ‘cellular component', and ‘molecular function’) was calculated for J. curcas, R. communis, and A. thaliana (Fig. 2). GO category classification. The percentages of number of genes classified into each GO slim category in J. curcas, R. communis, and A. thaliana are, respectively, shown in blue, red, and yellow bars.

(A) GO terms; (B) biological process; (C) cellular component; and (D) molecular function.Of 40 929 presumptive genes in the Jatropha genomic sequences, 2213 genes could be mapped onto 134 of the 155 metabolic pathways in the KEGG database,25 whereas the 2975 and 4115 genes of R. communis and A. thaliana were mapped onto 140 and 135 pathways, respectively. Twenty-nine pathways, including ‘fatty acid metabolism’ in lipid metabolism, ‘methionine metabolism’ and ‘lysine degradation’ in amino acid metabolism, and ‘benzoate degradation via hydroxylation’ in xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism, contained enzyme(s) on which the genes in the Jatropha genome were solely mapped (Supplementary Table S6).3.4. Characteristic features of the genes in J. curcasJatropha curcas is expected to contribute to biodiesel production through its ability to biosynthesize and accumulate considerable amounts of triacylglycerols (TAGs) in seeds. For this reason, the genes involved in TAG biosynthesis are of great interest and some of those genes have already been cloned from J. curcas.36,37 Recently, the collection of ESTs from developing and germinating Jatropha seeds has been reported.6 We manually annotated and summarized the gene models for fatty acid and TAG biosynthesis that were predicted in this work, together with related data that have been deposited to GenBank (Supplementary Table S7). The Jatropha genome appears to contain basically one gene for each enzyme isoform, and no obvious gene duplication particular to this plant was identified in this category. One gene model for a recently identified soluble type of DGAT38 also existed in the Jatropha genome. To improve Jatropha oil quality for biodiesel, its fatty acid composition could be changed by altering the expression of some of the genes listed in Supplementary Table S7.Jatropha curcas is known to produce tumour-promoting phorbol esters.39 Accordingly, depression of the phorbol ester biosynthetic gene in high oil content lines would be a step towards safe utilization of this plant. To our knowledge, genes involved in biosynthesis of phorbol esters have not been reported in J. curcas, with the exception of the gene for geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (GGPPS).40 In the current study, we searched genes for GGPPS, casbene synthase (CS), terpene hydroxylase (cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenase), and acyltransferase in the Jatropha genome with the tBLASTN program21 using the corresponding amino acid sequences in diterpene-producing plants as queries (Supplementary Table S8).One (JcCS1), two (JcCS2 and JcCS3), and six (JcCS4–JcCS9) homologues of a gene for CS in R. communis were identified in the BAC clones, JHL23C09, JHL22C18, and JHL17M24, respectively. JcCS2 is a pseudogene because there are several stop codons in the putative open reading frame (ORF). Interestingly, JcCS4–JcCS9 are tandemly aligned and are likely to be active because their ORFs seem to be intact. The phylogenetic tree demonstrates that JcCS4–JcCS9 forms a cluster, suggesting that continuous duplication of the original JcCS gene occurred recently (Supplementary Fig. S2 and Supplementary Table S9). There are 40 genes for terpenoid synthase (AtTPS) in A. thaliana that are most closely related to JcCS phylogenetically.41 They form clusters consisting of two or three tandem repeats at six loci in the genome. The clustered organization of JcCS may be an implication of the evolutionary process of genes related to the synthesis of terpenoid natural products.Curcin is a Type I ribosome-inactivating protein (RIP) common among the members of the Euphobiaceae family. Curcin in J. curcas is analogous to ricin, a Type II RIP, in R. communis, although the toxicity of curcin is significantly lower than that of ricin.42 Research on curcin has been extensive,42 and it has revealed antitumour activity.43,44 The activity of a curcin protein isoform against viral and fungal diseases has been proven by heterologous expression in tobacco; the expression of this curcin gene was induced by abiotic and biotic stresses in leaves.45–47 So far, Jatropha genes encoding three isoforms of curcin have been reported and deposited in public DNA databases. In our Jatropha genome sequence, only three contigs were identified to encode amino acid sequences highly similar to those coding for curcin, confirming that the Jatropha genome contains three curcin genes. However, there are four more contigs with presumptive genes predicted to encode curcin-like proteins with E-values from 1e-117 to 1e-91, as listed in Supplementary Table S10, suggesting that at least two more curcin isoforms are encoded in the Jatropha genome because these four additional genes make two pairs with highly similar counterparts. Data from proteomic analysis of developing seeds that is briefly mentioned in Costa et al.6 appear to support this observation as they identified five isoforms of curcin.In response to pathogens, plants have evolved disease resistance (R) genes. Most of them are NBS-LRR (nucleotide-binding site and leucine-rich repeat) proteins, which are classified into two groups on the basis of the presence of Toll and human interleukin receptors (TIR) at their amino termini.48 We identified 42 TIR NBS-LRR proteins and 50 non-TIR NBS-LRR proteins. We analysed five BAC clones (JHL06P13, JHS03A10, JHL25H03, JHL25P11, and JMS10C05) including R genes to reveal their gene structure (Supplementary Table S4). Two BAC clones (JHS03A10 and JMS10C05) include singletons of JcTIR-NBS-LRR1 and JcNBS-LRR9, whereas three clones (JHL06P13, JHL25H03, and JHL25P11) contain gene clusters as tandem repeats of R genes, JcNBS-LRR1 and JcNBS-LRR2, JcNBS-LRR3–5, or JcNBS-LRR6–8. JcNBS-LRR8 is a pseudogene with a stop codon in the ORF. The phylogenetic tree of R genes including eight R genes in J. curcas demonstrated that JcNBS-LRR3–5 or JcNBS-LRR6 and JcNBS-LRR7 are closely related, suggesting that these gene clusters evolved recently by the way of gene duplication (Supplementary Fig. S3 and Supplementary Table S11). Interestingly, JcNBS-LRR1 and JcNBS-LRR2 belong to different clades. This relationship indicates that gene duplication was not recent and that these gene segments were conserved after evolutionary diversification of J. curcas.MADS-box genes, typical homeotic genes coding for transcription factors, form a family and are involved in several aspects of plant development.49 Many plant species are known to harbour multiple MADS-box genes that belong to a range of functionally divergent subfamilies.50 We searched for MIKC type II MADS-box genes in the genome of J. curcas using amino acid sequences of PI in A. thaliana as a query. A total of 28 potential MADS-box genes (JcMADS01–JcMADS28) were identified (Supplementary Table S12). The phylogenetic analysis classified these genes into several subfamilies (Supplementary Fig. S4).SVP controls flowering time by negatively regulating the expression of a floral integrator, FLOWERING LOCUS T in response to ambient temperature changes in A. thaliana.51 Interestingly, there are five paralogs of SVP in Jatropha, yet only a single copy and three copies were identified in A. thaliana and Oryza sativa, respectively.52,53 Eight paralogs of SVP copies have been found in 57 MIKC type II MADS-box genes of Populus trichocarta,54 suggesting amplification and functional diversification of the SVP gene in woody plants.Flowering in J. curcas is closely related to the production of seeds. Jatropha curcas is a monoecious species, which forms unisexual flowers, male and female flowers, separately in an individual plant. The unisexual flowers are produced on the same inflorescence, with the ratio of male flowers to female flowers ranging from 10:1 to 30:1.55 The male bias ratio within an inflorescence limits seed production because more female flowers mean more fruits. Accordingly, modification of floral identity genes involved in organ identity could change the number or size of male and female organs or flowers.In the Jatropha genomic sequences, we identified eight orthologs of flowering-related genes including five flowering regulators, CONSTANS, FLOWERING LOCUS D, FLOWERING LOCUS F, LEAFY, and SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1, designated as JcCO, JcFD, JcFT, JcLFY, and JcSOC1, respectively, and three floral identity genes, APETALA2, APETALA3, and PISTILLATA, designated as JcAP2, JcAP3-1, and JcPI, respectively (Supplementary Table S13). Phylogenetic analysis indicated that all Jatropha flowering-related genes except JcCO are closely related to those of woody plants, including Betula pendula, Hevea brasiliensis, R. communis, and Vitis vinifera (Supplementary Fig. S5 and Supplementary Table S14). JcCO belonged to evolutionary lineages that differ from its homologues in monocot and dicot species. Further phylogenetic analysis indicated that JcCO is not related to any flowering-related genes including CO paralogs, a rice CO orthologue Hd1 and light-signalling genes of AtCOLs, which are CO-like genes in A. thaliana (Supplementary Fig. S6 and Supplementary Table S15). This finding suggests that JcCO is not directly involved in flowering regulation, although JcCO has all CO-conservative domains as a transcription factor including B-box and CCT motif. There were other CO homologues in the Jatropha genome; for example, JcCOL2 in JcCB0217351.10 and JcCOL9 in JcCA0317951.10, which suggests that different components participate in the response to light in J. curcas.3.5. Comparative analysisTo identify genes conserved specifically in the family Euphorbiaceae, amino acid sequences translated from the putative Jatropha genes predicted in this study were compared with those of genes in the genomes of A. thaliana, O. sativa, P. trichocarpa, V. vinifera, L. japonicus, and Glycine max, as well as protein sequences in the TrEMBL protein database.33 Sequences from the predicted genes in the R. communis genome34 and the gene index database for cassava (Manihot esculenta) were used as references for Euphorbiaceae protein-encoding genes. BLAST searches with a cut-off (E-value = 1e-20) indicated that 1529 genes (4% of the predicted protein-encoding genes) were found only in the Euphorbiaceae. The InterPro annotations of these Euphorbiaceae-specific genes were surveyed to find conserved motifs in these genes, and consequently, 22 InterPro motifs were likely to be conserved in five or more genes (Supplementary Table S16). Of these, the C1-like motif (IPR011424), the pentatricopeptide repeat motif (IPR002885), and the cytochrome P450 motif (IPR001128) were found in 10, 10, and 9 genes, respectively.Furthermore, 1176 of the genes predicted in the Jatropha genome assembly had matching sequences only in the Jatropha cDNA database suggesting that these genes are specific to J. curcas. The most common InterPro motifs found in these genes were the protein kinase-like domain (IPR011009) detected in six genes (Supplementary Table S17). The entire list of the Euphorbiaceae- and Jatropha-specific genes is provided in Supplementary Tables S18 and S19, respectively.To investigate the syntenic relations between the Jatropha and the other plant genomes, status of conservation of relative gene positions was surveyed using the scaffolds of Jatropha genomic sequences. Among the 1556 scaffolds with five or more predicted genes, conservation of the relative positions of three or more genes was observed in 829 scaffolds (53%) against genes predicted in the R. communis genomic sequences34 (Supplementary Tables S20 and S21). It appears that a significant degree of synteny can be expected within the family Euphorbiaceae. A syntenic relationship was also detected against the genomes of G. max and A. thaliana to a lesser degree. Microsyntenic relations have been observed in 178 (11%) and 256 (16%) of the 1556 scaffolds of the Jatropha genomic sequences, respectively (Supplementary Tables S20 and S21). The microsyntenic relationships between these plant species may provide useful information for predicting gene organization in the ancestral genome of dicots.Five SSR motives were found in the 100 genome-derived microsatellite markers tested. Most of the SSRs were poly (AT)n (83 SSRs), followed by poly (AAT)n (8 SSRs), poly (AG)n (5 SSRs), poly (AAG)n (3 SSRs), and poly (AC)n (1 SSR). A total of 88 markers generated specific amplicons, whereas the other eight and four markers showed no amplification and non-specific amplification, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S7). The small number of markers detecting non-specific amplification suggested less redundancy of SSR regions in the Jatropha genome. The number of alleles per locus ranged from one to four with a mean value of 1.31. Markers showed no polymorphisms; those detecting a single allele were most frequent. PIC values ranged from 0 to 0.45 with a mean value of 0.06 (Supplementary Fig. S8). The large number of markers detecting no polymorphisms and the low mean value of the PIC indicated that genetic diversity in Jatropha lines is generally narrow. An UPGMA genetic tree of the 12 lines of J. curcas illustrated that the three lines derived from meso-America regions (Guatemala1, Guatemala2, and Mexico2b) are genetically distinct from the other lines derived from Asia and Africa, whereas no significant difference was observed between the Asian and African lines (Supplementary Fig. S9).4.
