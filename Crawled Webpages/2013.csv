IntroductionBrassica rapa (2n = 20, AA) is an important Brassica species that is grown widely to produce leafy vegetables in Korea, China, and Japan, for vegetable oil in India, China, and Canada, and as a fodder crop in Europe. Chinese cabbage, pak choi, sarson, and turnips are distinct morphotypes of B. rapa belonging to different subspecies that are adapted to different geographical regions and climatic conditions. During the last two decades, studies by different laboratories using diverse germplasm led the development of several molecular markers and genetic linkage maps1,2 besides mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) for erucic acid,3 glucosinolates,4,5 disease resistance,6,7 plant morphology, flowering time, and yield component traits.8,9 Furthermore, comparative mapping between different cultivated Brassica species revealed the structural conservation between the homoeologous chromosomes of the A, B, and C subgenomes that were originally derived from three diploid Brassica species, namely, the Brassica rapa, Brassica nigra (BB, n = 8), and Brassica oleracea (CC, n = 9) genomes, and their polyploid derivatives, i.e. the important oilseed crops Brassica juncea (AABB, n = 18) and Brassica napus (AACC, n = 19), respectively.5,10,11 Furthermore, several comparative mapping studies between Brassica and Arabidopsis thaliana revealed the triplicate nature of the Brassica genome, with an average of three copies of each chromosomal segment of A. thaliana, which resulted from the triplication of the whole Brassica genome at ~11–12 MYA,12 although segmental conservation between Brassica and A. thaliana chromosomes has been observed at the gross level.10,11,13,14Therefore, to decode the whole genome sequences of the complicated Brassica genomes to be used in breeding programmes and to study the divergence of gene function and genome evolution associated with polyploidy and extensive duplications, the ‘Multinational Brassica Genome Sequencing Project Consortium’ was initiated in 2003. The first Brassica genome to be sequenced among the six cultivated Brassica species was the A genome of the B. rapa Chinese cabbage Chiifu-401 cultivar that has a comparatively small genome (529 Mb) among the cultivated Brassica species,15 and the draft genome sequence was published in 2011.16With the availability of recently developed advanced next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology to sequence the whole genome of crop plants in a short time span, the emphasis is being shifted to genomics-assisted breeding from traditional crop breeding using conventional molecular markers. The combined use of QTL mapping, which detects functional loci for traits of interest, and whole genome sequence information to identify candidate genes and their variation between the parental lines of B. rapa will greatly supplement the development of gene-specific molecular markers for breeding this crop with desired plant architecture and quality. Many oleifera and sarson types were exploited for breeding high seed yield component traits in B. rapa, but the vegetable types were not exploited for this purpose. Although several QTL have been mapped for leaf morphology, yield components, and other quality traits, most of the genes underlying trait variation have not been identified.9,17Therefore, in the present study, we used chromosome-specific bacterial artificial chromosome-derived simple sequence repeats (BAC-SSRs) and gene specific markers, e.g. intron polymorphisms (IPs) and expressed sequenced tag-derived SSRs (EST-SSRs) to map QTL governing morphological and yield component traits. Using whole genome next-generation sequence information data of the parental lines in combination with comparative alignment with the A. thaliana genome, potential candidate genes and single nucleotide variations within some of the potential candidate genes were identified. Furthermore, the chromosomal regions of B. rapa containing clusters of QTL were aligned with the QTL regions of B. juncea and B. napus to identify structural and functional conservation between the A, B, and C subgenomes, so that the candidate gene information of B. rapa could be used for breeding these crops.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materials, growth conditions, and trait measurementThe genetic map developed earlier by us2,18 using a CRF2 mapping population that was derived by crossing the diverse parental lines ‘Chiifu 401–42,’ a vegetable-type Chinese cabbage, and ‘rapid cycling B. rapa’ (hereafter referred to as ‘RCBr’), was used for QTL mapping in this study. For phenotypic investigation, 12 F3 plants derived by selfing each of the 190 F2 plants were planted per replication in 3 replications in 2008, 2009, and 2010 from March to July. The seeds were germinated in cell trays in a greenhouse for 1 month. In 2009 and 2010, two sets were grown, one set was vernalized after 20 days of germination for 1 month and the other set was grown without vernalization. All the plants were transplanted to the open field of Chungnam National University, Daejeon, Korea. Fourteen morphological and yield component traits (Table 1) were recorded in the CRF3 mapping population and parental lines. Four plants from the middle of each row from each replication were used for phenotypic data measurement for each family, and the average value of three replications was taken as trait data. Flowering time was the only trait that was recorded in the vernalized plants.

Statistical analysis and QTL mappingThe SAS 9.0 program (SAS institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA) was used for correlation coefficient analysis. The previously described genetic map18 was used for QTL mapping. WinQTL cartographer version 2.519 was used to perform QTL analysis using the composite interval mapping function as described previously.20 Tests for the presence of QTL were performed at 2-cM intervals using a 10-cM window. Significant QTL-defining logarithm of odds (LOD) values were calculated by 1000 permutations for phenotypic traits derived from each year.2.3. Comparative map alignment between the A, B, and C subgenomesTo identify the functionally conserved loci between B. rapa with B. juncea and B. napus for morphological and yield component traits, comparative alignment of QTL maps was performed between these three species. B. juncea contains the A and B subgenomes while B. napus contains the A and C subgenomes. For comparison, the B. juncea QTL map of Ramchiary et al.20 and the B. napus QTL maps of Quijada et al.21 and Udall et al.22 were used. The marker sequences from the respective maps21,22 were downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information and aligned with the A. thaliana genome using BLAST analysis, and crucifer building blocks14 containing important trait QTL were defined. The updated map of B. juncea based on IP markers11 was used to redraw the QTL map of Ramchiary et al.20 For QTL map alignment, the homoeologous A, B, and C subgenome groups of Brassica species defined by Panjabi et al.11 were used.2.4. Whole genome resequencing, identification of SNPs in candidate genes, and semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysisWhole genome resequencing of parental line RCBr was performed using an Illumina GAII next-generation sequencer. Sequence assembly and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) identification were performed in a stepwise manner: (i) the scaffold sequences from each linkage group (LG) of the B. rapa Chiifu 401–42 cultivar genome (http://brassicadb.org/brad/) were used as reference sequence, (ii) Augustus program23 was used to predict candidate genes in QTL regions, (iii) short-read sequences generated from RCBr were aligned to the reference B. rapa genome using Bowtie (http://bowtie.cbcb.umd.edu)24 and mapped onto each reference LG, (iv) alignments from Bowtie were transformed to MAQ25 to produce consensus short-read sequences and identify SNPs.Because we previously demarcated 24 crucifer building blocks in the B. rapa genome by comparing it with A. thaliana,18 we selected already characterized candidate genes from A. thaliana and looked for orthologous genes in the B. rapa genome in those blocks harbouring important trait QTL using a homology search approach and synteny analysis. SNPs were identified between the start and stop codons through comparative alignment between the sequences of the parental lines. Gene-specific primer pairs were designed for SNP validation, with an amplicon size of not more than 300 bp. DNA extraction, PCR using 1 × LC Green Plus (Idaho Technologies), and mapping functions were performed as described previously.18 The PCR conditions were 4 min at 94°C, 45 cycles of 20 s at 94°C, 20 s at 55–60°C, and 20 s at 72°C, with a final extension step of 7 min at 72°C. For the detection of SNPs between the parental lines and the F2 mapping population, we used a Light Scanner System (Idaho Technologies), as described previously.26 RNA was extracted from 20-day-old leaf samples, and semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis was performed following Lee et al.27 using gene-specific primer pairs listed in Supplementary Table S4.3. Results3.1. Variation of phenotypic traits in the parental lines and segregating populationsThe parental line Chiifu is a heading-type Chinese cabbage, whereas RCBr is a short life cycle Brassica plant, also known as the Wisconsin fast plant. The two parental lines showed significant differences for flowering, leaf, siliqua, and seed traits (Table 2). Chiifu showed higher phenotypic values for all the traits studied. The CRF3 population showed transgressive segregation for some of the traits, e.g. plant height in 2008, midrib length and width, siliqua length and width, siliqua beak length, seeds per siliqua, and seed weight. For flowering and bolting time, the transgression phenomenon trend was towards RCBr because Chiifu did not flower until seed harvesting time. As the bolting and flowering time were influenced by temperature and photoperiod, the mean value of flowering time measured in spring (2009 and 2010) was ~30 days shorter than in winter (2008), even when they were grown in a heated greenhouse. The mean values of the F3 lines for the leaf traits and plant height evaluated in spring 2009 and 2010 were also lower than those of the F3 lines grown in 2008. Distribution analysis of the phenotypic values of 14 traits in the mapping population showed a normal distribution for all the traits, suggesting that each trait was governed by many genes. Pearson's correlation coefficient analysis showed moderate to strong positive correlation among leaf traits (LL, LW, MRL, and MRW, correlation coefficient r = 0.53–0.92). Siliqua length, width, and beak length were significantly positively correlated with each other, but seed weight was not correlated with other siliqua traits (Supplementary Table S1). In addition, we found a positive correlation between bolting time, flowering time, and four leaf traits (Supplementary Table S1).

QTL mapping and identification of crucifer building blocks in the B. rapa genomeQTL mapping identified a total of 95 QTL for 14 traits in the CRF3 mapping population. It was observed that almost all the trait-enhancing alleles, except for flowering time, were contributed by the Chiifu parental line. The number of QTL detected ranged from 4 QTL for petiole length, seed number per siliqua and seed weight to 14 QTL for flowering traits, and the confidence interval ranged from 1 to 25 cM (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table S2).

Putative candidate genes identified within the QTL blocks are shown in bold black letters on the left of each LG, and those outside QTL intervals are shown in bold grey letters.A total of seven QTL were detected for plant height, one in each LG, i.e. A2 and A3 (R block), A3 and A5 (J block), A7 (E block), A9 (H block), and A10 (A block). The QTL on A2 (qPH1) and A7 (qPH4) showed higher LOD values and phenotypic explanation and were detected both in 2009 and 2010 (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table S2). The percentage of phenotypic variation explained by individual QTL ranged from 5 to 19%.Five leaf traits, i.e. leaf length and width, midrib length and width, and petiole length, were used for QTL analysis (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table S2). A total of six QTL for leaf length were detected in four LGs. qLL1 and qLL5 in the R blocks of A3 and A10, respectively, were consistently detected in two consecutive years (2008 and 2009). The percentage of phenotypic variation explained by individual QTL ranged from 7 to 49%. For leaf width, 10 QTL were detected, of which qLW1 in the U block of A1, qLW2 in the R block of A2, and qLW3 in the J block of A3 were consistently found in 2008 and 2009 (Supplementary Table S2). A total of 10 QTL were detected for midrib length, of which QTL in the J (qMRL3) and T (qMRL4) blocks of A3 and qMRL6 in the A block of A6 showed comparatively higher LOD values, but none of them were detected consecutively in different years. For midrib width, five QTL were detected, of which QTL in A2 (qMRW2) and A10 (qMRW5) were detected in the R blocks of both LGs. qMRW3 in T/U block of A3 and qMRW4 in E block of A7 were detected both in 2008 and 2009. Four QTL, two on A2 (qPL1 in R block and qPL2 in W block) and one each on LG A6 (qPL3) and A10 (qPL4 in R block) were detected for petiole length. The QTL on qPL3 was major QTL showing the highest LOD value of 11.8. The phenotypic variation explained by individual QTL ranged from 6 to 13%.A total of 10 QTL were detected for bolting time, of which qDB2 in the R block of A2, qDB4 in the J block of A3, qDB7 in the E block of A7, qDB8 in the A block of A8, and qDB10 in the R block of A10 were detected in 2008 and 2009 (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table S2). The QTL on A2, A7, and A10 were major loci, and the percentage of phenotypic variation explained by individual QTL ranged from 4 to 29%.For flowering time in the non-vernalized plants, a total of 12 QTL were identified in 8 LGs (Supplementary Table S2 and Fig. 1). Of these, QTL mapped to the R (qFT2 and qFT3) and W (qFT4) blocks of A2, R block of A3 (qFT5), E block of A7 (qFT10), N block of A9 (qFT13), and R block of A10 (qFT15) were major loci and were detected consecutively for 3 yrs. A total of nine QTL, including two new QTL, i.e. qFT1 in the U block of A1 and qFT13 in the A block of A10, were detected in vernalized population in addition to the already detected QTL in the non-vernalized population (marked by asterisks, Supplementary Table S2 and Fig. 1). qFT2 and qFT3, both on A2, qFT10 on A7, qFT13 on A9, and qFT14 on A10, were major flowering time QTL detected in the vernalized and non-vernalized populations.A total of nine QTL were detected for siliqua length, two QTL on A2 (qSQL1 in the R/W block and qSQL2 in E block), three QTL on A3 (qSQL3 in R block, qSQL4 in J block, and qSQL5 in T/U block), and one each on A7 (qSQL6 in the E block), A8 (qSQL7 in the B block), and A9 (qSQL8 in B block), and A10 (qSQL9 in the W block) (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table S2). qSQL3, qSQL5, and qSQL9 were detected in two consecutive years while qSQL6 on A7 was detected in three consecutive years. The QTL on A3 (qSQL5), A7 (qSQL6), and A10 (qSQL9) were major loci, contributing to phenotypic variation ranging from 7 to 19% in different years.Seven QTL, one each on LGs A1 (qSQW1 in the F block), A2 (qSQW2 in the K Block), A8 (qSQW6 in the C block), and A9 (qSQW7 in the N block) and three on A3 (qSQW3 in the R, qSQW4 in the J, and qSQW5 in the T/U blocks, respectively), were detected for siliqua width. qSQW1 on A1 and qSQW3 and qSQW5 on A3 were major loci that were detected in two consecutive years and explained 3–16% of the phenotypic variation.For siliqua beak length, five QTL were detected, one each on A3 (qSBL1 in the J block), A4 (qSBL2 in the N Block), A5 (qSBL3 in the C block), A7 (qSBL4 in the E block), and A9 (qSBL5 in H block). The QTL on A3 (qSBL1) and A5 (qSBL3) were comparatively major loci with high LOD values and were detected in two different years (2009 and 2010).The seed numbers per siliqua and seed weight are important traits for increasing yield (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table S2). For the number of seeds per siliqua, one QTL each on A2 (qSSQ1 in the R/W block) and A10 (qSSQ4 in the W block) and two QTL on A3 (qSSQ2 in the J block and qSSQ3 in the T block) were detected. Only qSSQ4 on A10 was detected in two years, although the other three QTL also showed significantly high LOD values. For seed weight, one QTL each was detected on A2 (qSW1 in the R block), A3 (qSW2 in the J block), A6 (qSW3 in the X block), and A10 (qSW4 in the R block). Of these, only qSW1 and qSW4 were detected in more than 1 yr (2009 and 2010). The phenotypic variation explained by individual QTL ranged from 6 to 17%.3.3. Identification of potential candidate genes in the QTL blocksAs synteny between our B. rapa map and A. thaliana was established,21 we searched for orthologs of previously characterized A. thaliana genes in the B. rapa genome (Fig. 1 and Table 3). The most important candidate genes, identified in the R blocks of A2, A3, and A10 harbouring the major QTL clusters for flowering and bolting, leaf, and siliqua traits, were orthologous to genes in the gibberellic acid (GA) oxidase 3 (AtGA20OX3),28 cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase 5 (AtCKX5),29,30 flowering locus C (FLC),8,9 GA-stimulated Arabidopsis (GASA4),31 and constans-like (COL) gene families. The Brassica homologs BraFLC and BraGA20OX3 were identified in the R blocks of A2, A3, and A10. However, some paralogs were differentially present on Brassica genomes such as BraCKX5 on A2 and A10, but not on A3, BraGASA4 only on A2 and A3, BraCOL1 on A2 and A10, etc. (Fig. 1). These suggest the preferential retention and fractionation of paralogous genes in duplicated segments of the B. rapa genome. Putative candidate genes identified in the QTL blocks of B. rapa genome and SNPs observed between gene sequences of the parental lines, Chiifu and RCBrPutative candidate genes identified in the QTL blocks of B. rapa genome and SNPs observed between gene sequences of the parental lines, Chiifu and RCBrWe detected two W blocks, one each on A2 and A10, that harboured QTL for petiole length, seeds per siliqua, leaf traits, days to bolting and flowering, and siliqua length (Fig. 1). These two blocks harbour paralogous BraCKX3 genes (Table 3). The E block on A2 only contained QTL for siliqua traits, but the paralogous block on A7 contained major QTL clusters for leaf traits, flowering and bolting, plant height, and siliqua traits. We detected GASA1, flowering locus T (BraFT), and apetala 1 (BraAP1) on both LGs. FT and AP are components of the flowering gene network..BraCKX5 was found only on A7 (Fig. 1).The J block of A3 contained many QTL for leaf, siliqua, and seed traits, plant height, and days to bolting and flowering, whereas the same blocks in A4 harboured QTL for leaf length and midrib length, and A5 contained QTL for flowering time and plant height (Fig. 1). A. thaliana growth-regulating factor32 (BraGRF3) was found in all three LGs. However, BraCKX1 paralogs were found only on A3 and A4, whereas asymmetric leaves 133 (BraAS1) paralogs were found only on A3 and A5 (Fig. 1).The candidate gene BraGA20X434 was identified in the C block of A5, which contains QTL for siliqua beak length. The H block of A7 contained QTL for days to flowering, bolting, and leaf width, whereas the paralogous block of A9 contained QTL for siliqua beak length. BraCKX2 paralogs were found in the QTL regions of both LGs (Fig. 1). The U block of A1 contained QTL for flowering and leaf width, whereas the paralogous block on A3 (U/T block) contained QTL for leaf width, length, and seeds per siliqua. The candidate genes BraGRF2 and BraAP2 were detected in both LGs. The X block in A6 contained QTL for days to bolting and harboured candidate gene LEAFY and mads affecting flowering time 3. The Q block harboured QTL for seed weight, leaf, and flowering traits and contained the GA-insensitive 1 gene (BraGA) that interacts with GA and is involved in floral transition and GA signalling.3.4. Identification, validation, and functional significance analysis of SNPs in candidate genesTo develop gene-specific SNP markers for breeding morphological and yield-related traits, we aligned all the identified candidate gene sequences from the parental lines and identified varying number of SNPs, ranging from one to many, between them (Fig. 2 and Table 3). As expected, we found more SNPs in the intronic regions than in the exonic regions. However, we did not detect any SNPs in a few genes, e.g. BraGA20OX3 in the R blocks of A2 and A10 and BraCKX1 in the J block of A03 (Fig. 2 and Table 3). SNPs identified for different cytokinin oxidases/dehydrogenases (CKX) paralogs between Chiifu and RCBr derived from whole genome resequenced data. Exons and introns are represented by blue rectangular bars and lines, respectively. Numbers indicated by arrows show the SNP positions from the start codon for Chiifu (left nucleotide) and RCBr (right nucleotide).SNPs identified for different cytokinin oxidases/dehydrogenases (CKX) paralogs between Chiifu and RCBr derived from whole genome resequenced data. Exons and introns are represented by blue rectangular bars and lines, respectively. Numbers indicated by arrows show the SNP positions from the start codon for Chiifu (left nucleotide) and RCBr (right nucleotide).To validate these SNPs experimentally, we designed a total of 12 primer pairs, 1 each from different genes flanking the SNPs and genotyped the parental lines and mapping population. Of the 12 SNPs, 10 primer pairs revealed clear polymorphisms (Supplementary Table S3). We genotyped using these 10 primer pairs in the mapping population and mapped them precisely in the B. rapa genome, which indicated their co-localization with the QTL positions on the respective chromosomes (Figs 1 and 3). Association analysis with the different phenotypes of the F3 population showed a correlation with the phenotypes and their co-localization in the QTL regions. We sequenced some of the genes containing SNPs using the resequenced data to validate whether the NGS data of the parental lines were correct. Resequencing of 10 genes showed the exact sequences as shown by NGS. We observed that the SNPs in coding regions of some potential candidate genes affected amino acid sequence, suggesting possible functional roles in phenotypic differences (Supplementary Fig. S1). The SNP in exon 2 of BraGA20OX3b codes for isoleucine in Chiifu and leucine in RCBr, methionine/threonine in exon 2 of BraCKX1b while serine was found in Chiifu, but no counterpart amino acid was observed in RCBr in exon 5 of BraCKX3b. Two amino acid changes were observed in exon 1 of BraGA2OX4 (arginine/serine and serine/threonine), one each in exons 2 (aspartate/valine), and four (alanine/threonine) of BraCKX7a, two each in exon 1 (valine/isoleucine and glycine/serine) of BraCKX7b and exon 4 (isoleucine/serine and threonine/alanine) of BraGRF2a, one each in exon 2 (leucine/arginine) and exon 4 (glycine/serine) of BraGRF3c, and two in exon 1 (methionine /valine and threonine/serine) of BraCOL1 gene.

Plot A represents the curve-shifted plot, and B represents a difference plot showing ‘Chiifu’ type in red colour, ‘RCBr’ type in grey colour, and hetero type in green colour.Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis was used to evaluate expression differences of candidate genes between the parental lines. The gibberellin biosynthesis and oxidase, cytokinin oxidases/dehydrogenases and growth-regulating factor gene families that affect leaf, plant, and flower development, showed differential gene expression between Chiifu and RCBr lines (Fig. 4). BraCKX5, BraCKX3a, BraCKX1a, and BraCKX7a showed higher expression in Chiifu, whereas very little or no expression was seen in RCBr. Genes that are involved in flowering pathways, such as FLC, FT, COL, and GA, were also analysed for differential expression between the parental lines. Of the three BraFLC paralogs, only BraFLCa on A2 did not show any expression in RCBr while the other two BraFLCs showed no difference in expression. BraMAF3 on A6 showed higher expression level in Chiifu when compared with RCBr. BraAP2a on A1, BraCOL1a on A2, BraGA on A6 and BraFTb on A7 showed strong expression in RCBr, but very little to no expression in Chiifu. BraGRF2a, BraGRF3a, and BraGA2OX4 showed comparatively higher expression in Chiifu while BraGA20OX3c showed higher expression in RCBr. This differential gene expression and the amino acid changes suggest possible roles in phenotypic differences between the parental lines and in the segregating population.

Functional conservation of crucifer building blocks between the A, B, and C subgenomes of Brassica species as revealed by comparative QTL mappingWe aligned the QTL map of B. rapa from this study with the B. juncea map of Ramchiary et al.20 and B. napus QTL maps of Quijada et al.21 and Udall et al.22 to identify the structural and functional conservation of QTL blocks for important morphological and yield component traits. Comparative alignment of the QTL maps between these three species identified a total of four homologous/homoeologous groups (HGs) containing QTL for agronomic and yield component traits (Fig. 5). The first group was the R block of Ar2, Aj2, An2, Cn2, and Bj2 (r, j, and n stand for B. rapa, B. juncea, and B. napus, respectively). Although many major QTL for different traits were detected in the B. rapa A subgenome, in comparison with B. napus, three traits, namely, plant height, flowering time, and seed yield, were commonly detected in the A subgenome of the two species and the homoeologous region of the same block in the C subgenome of B. napus. We did not detect any QTL in the Aj2 or Bj2 subgenomes of B. juncea (Fig. 3). The second HG was the A3, B3, and C3 chromosomes of the A, B, and C subgenomes of Brassica species. Three blocks, namely, R, J, and F, harboured common QTL between the three subgenomes. The R block of this HG contained common QTL for seed weight, yield, and test weight (hereafter referred to collectively as SW) and flowering time QTL between the A and C subgenomes of B. napus and the A subgenome of B. rapa. In addition, the homoeologous region of this block contained QTL for a number of branches of the B subgenome of B. juncea. The J block of this group contained many QTL in Ar3, but few in An3, Aj3, and Bj3. The common loci were for SW and flowering time in addition to siliqua traits, e.g. siliqua length, density, and number, and plant height. The last common block, i.e. the F block of this group, harboured common trait QTL mainly for SW and plant height between An3 and Cn3. The most important common block of HG7 was the E block. This block contained common QTL for plant height, SW, flowering time, siliqua number and density, and seed number per siliqua in Ar7, Aj7, Cn7, and Bj7. In addition, some leaf traits were detected in Ar7. The last common group of the A, B, and C Brassica subgenomes was HG10 that contained the W and R blocks. The W block contained common QTL for siliqua length, seed number per siliqua, and SW between Ar10, An10, and Aj10. In addition, QTL for flowering, plant height, and leaf traits were detected in Ar10 and An10, respectively. However, in this block, no single or corresponding common QTL were detected in Bj10 and Cn10. The most important block of HG10 was the R block. This block harboured common major QTL for plant height, branch number, flowering time, siliqua traits, and SW in Ar10, Aj10, An10, Bj10, and Cn10, respectively. Similarly, the middle region of Ar6 (X and Q block) in the present study detected QTL for SW, leaf, and flowering traits while the same chromosomal region in B. juncea detected major QTL for siliqua length and density.20 We also detected common QTL for flowering and SW, both in Ar6 and Cn6 subgenomes.21Comparative QTL mapping between B. rapa, B. juncea, and B. napus revealed conservation of crucifer building blocks governing morphological and yield component traits. Superscripts ‘r’, ‘n’, and ‘j’ after each A, B, and C LGs denote chromosomes that were derived from B. rapa, B. napus, and B. juncea, respectively.

QTL mapping revealed some crucifer blocks that were functionally more active than duplicated paralogous blocks in the B. rapa genomeAlthough in many studies, immortal mapping populations such as doubled haploid and recombinant inbred lines are used, in our present study, we used F3 families for three consecutive years to detect QTL, as F3 families represent the comprehensive genetic information of heterozygous and homozygous plants and their interacting effects on phenotype. As the parental lines Chiifu and RCBr were very different with respect to all the traits under study, it was easy to detect many QTL in B. rapa using the segregating F3 population. Correlation coefficient analysis revealed significant correlations between leaf and yield-related traits that were further supported by the co-mapping of several QTL governing different traits in a few chromosomal blocks of the B. rapa genome. The co-localization of QTL governing different traits in the same genetic interval has been suggested to be due to either pleiotropy exhibited by a single gene or tight linkage of genetic loci governing different traits in the same genetic interval.8,20 The R block of A2 contained QTL for eight traits while the same paralogous blocks on A10 and A3 contained QTL for five and four traits, respectively (Fig. 1). Prominent QTL clusters were observed for seven traits related to leaf, flowering, bolting, and siliqua traits on the E block of A7 while the same block on A2 contained only one QTL for siliqua length. A similar case was observed for the J blocks, where the same block on A3 harboured QTL for 10 traits, but only harboured QTL for 2 traits on A4 and A5. These findings suggest that the R block of A2, E block of A7, and J block of A3 contain more active genes that govern leaf traits, plant morphology, and seed traits. Lou et al.8 and Li et al.9 also observed QTL clusters in these LGs for days to flowering, bolting, and leaf traits. We presumed that the chromosomal blocks of Lou et al.8 were the R block on A2 and E block on A7. The W block on A2 contained QTL clusters for days to flowering and bolting and seeds per siliqua, whereas A10 contained QTL for siliqua and leaf traits. This kind of observation suggests that only those crucifer blocks harbouring QTL might possess functionally active genes for the traits under study, as reported by Wang et al.16 and Tang et al.35 for the B. rapa genome. They reported that, of the triplicate duplicated subgenomes, fractionation and deletion of genes were more frequent in some subgenomes when compared with other paralogs. We also observed that some candidate genes were missing in major QTL blocks, such as BraGASA4 from A10 and BraCKX5 from A3, which both belong to the R block that is homologous to A. thaliana chromosome 5. Other reasons for not finding equal QTL/genes in all paralogous blocks may be that the genes are not functionally active or the absence of polymorphisms in the causal genes between the parental lines.4.2. Gene family members were detected in different QTL blocks of the B. rapa genomeMany candidate genes in QTL blocks for flowering, leaf, seed, and siliqua traits were identified through synteny analysis of the B. rapa and A. thaliana genomes. The R block, homologous to A. thaliana chromosome 5, harbours many flowering genes, including FLC and COL1. We identified BraFLC and BraCOL1 paralogs in those blocks containing QTL for flowering time, as reported by earlier studies.8,36 Recent studies have shown that members of cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenases (CKX), GA-stimulated Arabidopsis (GASA), and GA oxidase (GA2OX, GA20OXs, etc.) gene families are involved in the regulation of flower and inflorescence development, thereby increasing the seed size and yield.28–31CKX genes are important for agricultural productivity as mutations in these genes cause accumulation of high levels of cytokinin in the inflorescence meristem and increased reproductive organs and larger flowers and seeds.29,30 These genes co-localized in the QTL blocks of B. rapa LGs A2, A3, A4, A7, A9, and A10. GASA genes are active in the shoot apical meristem, developing flowers, and embryos. GASA mutants and GASA over-expressing plants demonstrated that GASA genes are involved in floral meristem identity and affect seed size and yield in A. thaliana.29 We observed two paralogs of BraGASA4, one on each R block of A2 and A3, but not on the R block of A10, suggesting that the paralogs on A10 may have been lost over time, although all blocks harboured QTL for flowering, siliqua, and seed traits. GA oxidases were observed in the QTL regions of the R, J, and other blocks containing prominent QTL for leaf and flowering traits, and a possible involvement of this gene family in leaf traits was reported by Li et al.9 The BraGRF members found on A1 and A5 are also candidates for leaf and flowering traits, as supported by their co-localization with these QTL regions. Several members of the BraCOL and BraFT families were also found in different LGs in the QTL regions, suggesting an involvement in trait variation.SNPs analysis revealed some amino acid changes between the parental lines in many genes belonging to constans like 1(COL1), cytokinin oxidases/dehydrogenases, growth-regulating factor, and GA oxidases gene families. Further expression analysis showed higher expression of genes that facilitate early flowering such as BraCOL1a, BraFT, BraAP2 in RCBr, but minimal expression in Chiifu, whereas the flowering repressor gene BraFLCa was highly expressed in Chiifu suggesting an association between flowering trait and expression of these genes. The co-mapping of these genes with flowering QTL in different LGs further supported this notion. Members of growth-regulating factor, GA oxidase, and cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenases gene families that co-localized within the QTL region showed higher expression in Chiifu, suggesting their role in better growth and development of leaf, plants, and reproductive organs when compared with RCBr. Either non-synonymous SNPs or differential genes expression or a combination of these factors may underlie phenotypic differences between the parental lines and in the segregating populations. However, this should be further assessed in different plant tissues.4.3. QTL blocks are evolutionarily conserved between the A, B, and C subgenomes of Brassica speciesOur comparative QTL map alignment between B. rapa, B. napus, and B. juncea revealed conservation of QTL blocks that contain several genetic loci influencing plant height, flowering, siliqua, and seed traits between the A, B, and C subgenomes of Brassica species (Fig. 5). Although many earlier studies reported the conservation of chromosomal blocks at the gross level,10,11,14 a comparison of QTL location has not been performed for yield component traits between different Brassica subgenomes. In our present study, we identified conserved QTL blocks in 4 of the 10 HGs of the A, B, and C subgenomes reported by Panjabi et al.11 As plant height, flowering time, siliqua, and seed traits were the only common traits studied in the three species, we could study the conservation of these traits in the four HG QTL blocks. The R blocks of HG2, HG3, and HG10, E block of HG7, W block of HG10, and J and F blocks of HG2 were major QTL blocks harbouring common QTL for SW, plant height, flowering, and siliqua traits between the A, B, and C subgenomes of these three species. This suggest that the genes governing these traits are structurally and functionally conserved not only between the A, B, and C subgenomes of Brassica species but also between A. thaliana and Brassica genomes, even though they diverged from their common ancestor a long time ago.12 We previously found the conservation of QTL for seed oil, total seed glucosinolates, and seed protein content between the A subgenomes of B. rapa and B. napus.5 Studies on B. napus21,22 and B. juncea20 detected QTL in homoeologous LGs of the A and C and A and B subgenomes, respectively, but detailed information with respect to specific crucifer blocks was not provided. We found more common QTL between the A and C subgenomes when compared with the B subgenome with either the A or C subgenomes. Although we believe that more comparisons using QTL maps from different mapping populations are needed, the present study suggests that A and C (diverged 8 MYA) are more close than the A/B and C subgenomes, as reported earlier.12 We also observed many QTL in one species that had no counterparts controlling the same traits in the corresponding locations of other species, which might have been the result of a lack of genetic polymorphisms between the parental lines or diversified molecular polymorphisms between the species due to the presence of genomic rearrangements/structural changes causing differences in functional expression between different Brassica species. We believe that adding more markers to generate a high-density map and a detailed comparison of QTL for common traits using different mapping populations of more Brassica species would give more detailed information about the conservation and diversification of genetic loci governing morphological and yield component traits.4.4. Breeding opportunities in Brassica species using candidate gene information from B. rapaThe present QTL mapping study identified some interesting findings regarding the presence of candidate genes for important traits in a few specific crucifer building blocks of the B. rapa genome (Fig. 1). Although, the crucifer blocks demonstrated the co-localization of important QTL and candidate genes, association analysis using large segregating population with different trait phenotypes and functional validation of candidate genes by transformation should be done because each QTL block contains several genes governing overlapping traits. We observed few gene paralogs within the QTL interval in one duplicated block but not in others, suggesting the need for further validation. However, we believe that some of the SNPs identified in candidate genes such as BraCKXs, BraGASA4, BraGA20OXs, BraGRFs, BraFLC, BraCOLs, BraMAF, and BraAP2 would be helpful in breeding leaf, flowering, bolting, siliqua, and seed traits of B. rapa, as their differential expressions in parental lines and previous studies suggest their role in creating phenotypic differences9. However, additional expression studies using different tissues are needed. Although genome sequencing of other cultivated Brassica species is ongoing, gene sequence information of B. rapa could be used to isolate and develop molecular markers for breeding other Brassica species, especially B. juncea and B. napus, as B. rapa is one of the progenitor species of both species and there still exists QTL block conservation for important agronomic and yield component traits between these three species.Supplementary dataSupplementary Data are available atwww.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis research was partially supported by Chinese Cabbage Molecular Marker Research Center (Grant No. 607003-05) and Agriculture Research Center (Grant No. 06362010-0010) from the Technology Development Program for Agriculture and Forestry, Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, as well as a grant from the Next-Generation BioGreen 21 Program (Plant Molecular Breeding Center No. PJ007992), Rural Development Administration, Republic of Korea.We are thankful to the Korea Brassica Genome Resource Bank for providing Chiifu and CRF3 mapping population, Prof. Deepak Pental and Prof. Akshay K.

Our linkage map and the newly developed markers used to create it constitute an essential resource and a useful framework for future genetic analyses in BPH.1. IntroductionThe brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens Stål (Homoptera: Delphacidae), is one of the most economically important insect pests of rice (Oryza sativa L.) throughout Asia. The widespread damage caused by BPH leads to substantial and unpredictable decreases in rice yield. Continuous rice cultivation, accompanied by extensive use and frequent misuse of insecticides along with a high rate of nitrogen fertilizer application, often causes BPH outbreaks in rice fields.1 More than 50 million ha of rice fields throughout Asia have been heavily affected by this insect in the past decade.2–4 In addition to directly feeding on rice plants, BPH also causes indirect damage by transmitting viruses that cause the ragged stunt and grassy stunt diseases of rice.5Host-plant resistance offers a practical approach for BPH control, and a succession of resistant rice varieties has been bred and cultivated widely in Asia. Nevertheless, the appearance of BPH with new virulence characteristics can overcome their resistance soon after the varieties have been released.4,6 The virulence, which refers to the ability to adapt to resistant rice varieties, has been reported to be under genetic control and is inherited as a quantitative trait.7 Understanding the genetic basis of the virulence against rice cultivars will provide significant information for future BPH management strategies. A genetic linkage map would provide an important framework for identifying quantitative trait loci (QTL) related to the virulence characteristics. Unfortunately, no detailed genetic linkage map based on molecular markers has yet been developed for BPH or for other closely related delphacid species.BPH has a diploid chromosome number of 30 (28 autosomes combined with the sex determination system XY and XX in males and females, respectively).8–10 The genome size of BPH is estimated to be 1.2 Gbp.11 Recently, a number of genomic resources for BPH have been made available, and they provide highly useful information to support experimental genetics studies.12–16 More than 350 expressed sequence tag (EST)-derived simple sequence repeat (e-SSR) markers for BPH have been successfully developed subsequent to the availability of large EST datasets.17–19 In addition, a total of 136 SSRs have been isolated from BPH genomic DNA.20 These newly developed e-SSRs and genomic SSR (g-SSR) markers have been used to assess the genetic diversity of BPH populations.17,20 However, the exact genomic locations of the newly developed SSR markers have not yet been determined by genetic mapping.Genetic maps are valuable genomic resources and represent a powerful research tool for identifying the genetic basis of phenotypic variation. The purpose of the present study was to construct a baseline genetic linkage map for BPH using both new and existing SSRs and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). G-SSR markers were generated from the sequence information of repeat regions derived from high-throughput microsatellite isolation procedures. We also developed SNP markers using next-generation sequencing technologies. The newly developed and public markers were successfully applied to construct a consensus linkage map. This map will provide initial information for identifying the genetic basis of BPH virulence and other important traits, including insecticide resistance, virus transmission, and wing polymorphisms. In addition, the newly developed markers will support studies of the morphology, physiology, evolution, and ecology of this significant insect pest.2. Materials and methods2.1. Insect strains and crossesFour BPH strains collected in Japan were used in this study. (i) Hadano-66 was collected in Hadano, Kanagawa Prefecture, in 1966 and was maintained in a laboratory colony for ~500 generations, (ii) Chikugo-89 was collected in Chikugo, Fukuoka Prefecture, in 1989 and was maintained in a laboratory colony for more than 250 generations, (iii) Koshi-10 was collected in Koshi, Kumamoto Prefecture, in 2010 and was maintained for ~20 generations in a laboratory colony and (iv) Izumo-87 was collected in Izumo, Shimane Prefecture, in 1987 and was maintained in a laboratory colony for ~270 generations. These BPH strains immigrated into Japan from East Asian regions.21,22 The Izumo-87 strain was used for whole-genome sequencing to generate a reference sequence12 and detect SNPs. Hadano-66, Chikugo-89, and Koshi-10 strains were used to generate the inbred BPH strains (IBSs) and the mapping populations. One pair of insects from each BPH strain was selected for crossing to generate the IBSs H66 for Hadano-66, C89 for Chikugo-89, and K10 for Koshi-10. The IBSs were prepared without outcrossing through three generations of single-pair, full-sibling mating (Fig. 1). All BPH strains were reared on seedlings of cv. ‘Reiho’, a japonica rice variety, and maintained in the laboratory at 25 ± 2°C under a 16L:8D photoperiod. To generate the mapping populations, a pair of insects from two different IBSs was selected and crossed using single-pair mating. Two backcross populations (BC1F1) were generated from crosses (<U+2640> × <U+2642>) of K10 × H66 with backcrossing with H66 (referred to as the KH population) and C89 × K10 with backcrossing with C89 (referred to as the CK population). Mating scheme of an experiment perform to obtain IBSs and mapping populations.Mating scheme of an experiment perform to obtain IBSs and mapping populations.The crosses were performed by placing a virgin female and a male from each IBS on ‘Reiho’ seedlings in a glass tube. After mating and oviposition, the parental insects were collected and stored in 95% ethanol. The F1 offspring from each cross was cultured in separate containers. Newly hatched nymphs of F1 progeny from each cross were transferred into a plastic 800-ml container (dimensions: 8.5 cm wide by 16 cm tall) containing 8–10 seedlings and reared up to the fifth-instar nymph stage. An individual fifth-instar nymph of each sex was selected and reared in a separate glass tube to obtain unmated adults. F1 females were backcrossed with their parent family to generate the BC1F1 generation (Fig. 1). BC1F1 offspring from each cross were reared up to the second- and third-instar nymph stages. Although it is not possible to sex the insects at this stage, using early instars greatly accelerates the analytical process and avoids viability problems that may occur at later stages. All offspring were then collected and stored in 95% ethanol. We randomly selected 91 KH offspring and 89 CK offspring for the linkage analysis. All crossing experiments were conducted in the insectary at the Kyushu Okinawa Agricultural Research Center, Kumamoto, Japan.2.2. Total DNA extraction and whole-genome amplificationGenomic DNA of the preserved samples (grandparents, parents, and offspring) was isolated individually using a modified version of the potassium acetate procedure of Dellaporta et al.23 For the adult insects, only the head and thorax were used for DNA extraction to reduce the possibility of contamination by fertilized eggs and bacterial symbionts.24 The whole-genome amplification technique25 was used to produce large amounts of DNA from individual insects for large-scale genotyping.2.3. Microsatellite isolation, sequencing, and primer designTwo SSR-enrichment genomic libraries were prepared from Hadano-66 genomic DNA that was extracted from ~50 insects, including nymphs, adults, males, and females. The first library (referred to as the SREL library) was produced by the Savannah River Ecology Laboratory (University of Georgia), following the method of Glenn and Schable.26 Briefly, 2 µg of BPH genomic DNA was digested with RsaI. The digested DNA was ligated with double-stranded SuperSNX linkers (5'–GTTTAAGGCCTAGCTAGCAGAATC–3'/5'–GATTCTGCTAGCTAGGC CTTAAACAAAA–3'). The linker-ligated DNA was hybridized with seven biotinylated oligo probes: (AG)12, (TG)12, (AAC)6, (AAG)8, (AAT)12, (ACT)12, and (ATC)8. The DNA fragments with a microsatellite repeat were captured using Dynabeads (Dynal, Oslo, Norway) under a magnetic field. The amount of eluted DNA was increased by using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to recover enriched DNA fragments using the SuperSNX primer pairs.The fast isolation by amplified fragment length polymorphism of sequences containing repeats (FIASCO) procedure described by Zane et al.27 was used to isolate the second library (referred to as the KU library) at the Plant Breeding Laboratory (Kyushu University). Briefly, genomic DNA was digested with MseI and ligated to MseI adaptors (5'–TACTCAGGACTCAT–3/5–GACGATGAGTCCTGAG–3'). The mixture was amplified with an MseI adaptor primer (5'–GATGAGTCCTGAGTAAN–3'). The PCR product was then hybridized with six biotinylated probes: (CT)10, (CA)10, (CAC)7, (AAG)7, (TCC)7, and (GACA)5. The DNA molecules that were hybridized to biotinylated probes were captured using streptavidin magnetic particles (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) using a magnetic field. PCR was performed to recover enriched DNA fragments using the MseI adaptor primer.The SREL and KU libraries were sequenced using the Roche 454 GS FLX Titanium system (454 Life Sciences, Branford, CT, USA). SSRs in the read data were detected using a Perl script in the Simple Sequence Repeat Identification Tool (SSRIT),28 with minimum thresholds of nine, six, five, five, five, and five repeat units for di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, hexa-, and heptanucleotide repeats, respectively. The terminal sequences derived from the ligated adapters were eliminated in both directions. SSR regions were masked by continuous N letters with the same length as the detected SSRs. The masked sequences were then de novo assembled using the Newbler software (454 Life Sciences). A flanking sequence of an appropriate length for primer design was calculated using a Perl script and Primer3.29To develop e-SSR markers, we obtained the EST sequences contributed by Noda et al.12 from the NCBI database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). The EST sequences were analysed for SSR discovery using SSRIT with minimum thresholds of six, five, five, three, and three repeat units for di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, and hexanucleotide SSRs, respectively. All EST sequences that contained SSRs were assembled using the CodonCode Aligner software (CodonCode Corporation, http://www.codoncode.com/). Primer3 was used to design the primers. We designed 341 primer pairs, but only 50 primer pairs were randomly selected and used for the polymorphism test.The newly developed g-SSR and e-SSR markers were named using the prefixes NLGS (Nilaparvata lugens g-SSR) and NLES (Nilaparvata lugens e-SSR), respectively, followed by the number of the marker. For the primers from Jing et al.,17 we retained the original published names. Primer functionality and polymorphism were tested on the parents of the backcross populations. Only clearly polymorphic markers were employed to genotype individuals from the mapping populations. The PCR products were electrophoresed on 4% agarose gels in 0.5× Tris–borate–EDTA buffer, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized under ultraviolet light. All PCR conditions are summarized in Supplementary Tables S1–S3.2.4. SNP discovery and analysisSNPs were discovered by comparing whole-genome sequence data from two BPH strains, Izumo-87 (I87)12 and IBS-C89. The reference genomic sequences of I87 were acquired using the Roche 454 GS FLX pyrosequencing platform (H. Noda, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, unpublished data). To obtain reference genomic contigs, the short-read next-generation sequencing data were subjected to de novo assembly using the Celera Assembler software (v6.1).30 The genome sequence of IBS-C89 was performed using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform, and a total of about 77.3 million reads were generated. The read data were mapped to reference genomic contigs using the BWA software (v0.6.1).31 SNPs between I87 and IBS-C89 were called using the SAMtools/BCFtools software (v0.1.12a)32 and visualized using the Tablet software (v1.12).33 We randomly selected 234 SNPs that were homogeneous within the strain. PCR primers were designed to amplify 500- to 600-bp fragments carrying each potential SNP. The fragments were sequenced using a 3730 DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) to screen for polymorphic SNPs between the reference strains (I87 and IBS-C89) and two of the parents of the KH mapping populations (K10 and H66). The selected polymorphic SNPs were used to genotype individual offspring of the KH population. The developed SNP markers were named using the prefixes NLSP (Nilaparvata lugens SNP), followed by the number of the marker. The primers and the PCR conditions are summarized in Supplementary Table S4.2.5. Genetic linkage analysis and map constructionA genetic linkage map of each mapping population was analysed using the JoinMap software (v4.1).34 All markers were tested for significant deviation from a normal Mendelian segregation ratio to assess the goodness-of-fit to the expected ratios of 1:1, 1:1:1:1, and 1:2:1 for each marker at a 5% significance level. The ‘outcross pollinated’ (CP) option was used as the population type in this analysis. Grouping of markers was performed using a minimum-independence logarithm of odds (LOD) threshold of 5.0. Groups were converted into maps using the regression algorithm provided by JoinMap with a recombination frequency smaller than 0.45 used for the linkages, and then Kosambi's mapping function35 was used to calculate map distances. Distorted markers were retained for mapping, if their presence did not alter the surrounding marker order in a given linkage group (LG).On completion of the linkage maps for KH and CK, the individual maps were integrated into a consensus map by applying the ‘combine groups for map integration’ module of JoinMap. An integrated map was created by merging bridging-SSR markers in homologous LGs into a single consensus map. Linkage maps were drawn using the MapChart software for Windows.36 The expected genome coverage was estimated according to the method of Chakravarti et al.,37 in which the length of each LG was multiplied by (m + 1)/(m - 1), where m is the marker number on each LG.3. Results3.1. SSR development and genotypingSSR development and primer design: High-throughput sequencing by the 454 GS FLX Titanium generated ~23.6 Mbp of read data with 87 068 reads from the SREL library. The sequence data were de novo assembled into 1906 contigs. After the assembly, the contigs had an average length of 303 bp. Among the 1906 unique sequences, 970 had flanking regions that were large enough for primer design. For the KU library, ~24.1 Mbp of read data were generated. From 83 630 reads, 4490 unique contigs were produced, with an average length of 314 bp after the assembly. Of the 4490 contigs, 2556 had flanking regions that were large enough for primer design. Finally, 860 and 2300 primer pairs were designed from the read data for the SREL and KU libraries, respectively.SSR polymorphism: A total of 3160 g-SSR primer pairs from the SSR enrichments, 50 newly developed e-SSRs, and 351 publicly available e-SSRs were used to screen for polymorphisms in the parents of the KH and CK populations. Of the 3160 g-SSR markers, 2048 (64.8%) were successfully amplified by PCR. Of these 2048 SSR primer pairs, 922 (45.0%) amplified fragments were polymorphic between the parents. From these polymorphic g-SSRs, only 418 (45.3%) were informative in the mapping populations. The remaining 504 (54.7%) polymorphic markers could not be scored, mostly due to banding patterns that were too difficult to interpret, including multiple-banding patterns, bands that amplified poorly in the offspring, and bands that did not show clear polymorphism on the 4% agarose gel. Of the 50 newly developed e-SSR markers, 15 (30.0%) amplified fragments were polymorphic between the parents. Of the 351 published e-SSR markers that we tested, 317 (90.3%) were successfully amplified by PCR and 100 of the 317 (31.5%) showed polymorphism. Of the total of 1037 polymorphic markers, including g-SSRs, public e-SSRs, and newly developed e-SSRs, only 408 and 213 primer pairs were selected to analyse offspring of the KH and CK populations, respectively. Details of the polymorphic SSR markers are summarized in Supplementary Tables S1–S3.3.2. SNP discovery and genotypingOf the 234 primer pairs designed to amplify SNP target sequences, 164 (70.1%) were successfully used to amplify a single amplicon of the expected size. Among them, 79 loci (48.2%) were polymorphic between the survey strains (I87 and IBS-C89), and 48 loci (29.3%) were polymorphic between the parents of the KH population. Six SNP markers that were not heterozygous in the offspring of the KH population were excluded from the analysis, leaving 42 loci. After adding 4 SNPs from a preliminary experiment, 46 SNPs were selected and used to genotype the offspring of the KH mapping population. The SNP markers and PCR conditions are summarized in Supplementary Table S4.3.3. Linkage analysis and map constructionIndividual genetic linkage maps: The polymorphic markers used for linkage map construction consisted of e-SSR, g-SSR, SNP, and sequence-tagged site (STS) markers. Based on the results of the LG analysis, we constructed individual linkage maps for the KH and CK populations. The KH linkage map was developed from g-SSR, e-SSR, and SNP markers with an LOD score of 5.0. The map consisted of 18 LGs with 357 unique positions (excluding duplicated markers), derived from 348 SSR and 44 SNP markers and covered 870.2 cM. The average distance between the markers was 2.8 cM (Supplementary Table S5, Fig. S1). The LGs ranged in length from 3.8 to 83.2 cM. Of these markers, 21 were unlinked or unsuccessfully positioned. Of the 21 unmapped markers, 13 were not linked to another marker and the remaining 8 markers were assigned to LGs, but no map positions were determined. Chi-square analysis indicated that more than 10% of the markers deviated from Mendelian segregation at P < 0.01.Only 180 g-SSR markers, 32 e-SSR markers, and 1 STS marker that showed polymorphism among the parents (for a total of 213 markers) were selected to analyse the offspring of the CK population. A linkage map was constructed with a recombination threshold of 0.45, and the minimum number of markers per group was set to two. Linkage analysis was performed at a minimum LOD of 5.0. The linkage map consisted of 207 marker loci in 16 LGs that covered 770.7 cM. (Supplementary Table S6, Fig. S1). The LGs ranged in length from 1.4 to 85.9 cM, with an average distance of 4.4 cM between markers. We positioned 43 distorted loci (20.8%) in LGs 1 to 15. The majority was clustered in LG16. We found four unlinked markers and excluded two other distorted markers from the analysis. The Y chromosomal marker PMn3 was mapped at the end of the LG arm next to NLGS201 in LG16 of the CK population.Consensus linkage map: The consensus map was constructed by integrating linkage data from the two backcross populations (KH and CK). The ‘combine groups for map integration’ module of JoinMap was used to integrate the two individual maps into a consensus map. A total of 73 common SSR markers between the homologous LGs were used as bridges to integrate the individual maps. The order of the bridged markers was consistent between the two individual maps, except for 16 marker inversions in LG2 to LG8, in LG10, and in LG12 to LG13 (Supplementary Fig. S1). The final consensus map contained 400 g-SSR, 74 e-SSR, 43 SNP, and 1 STS markers (for a total of 518), with 472 unique positions in 17 LGs. Table 1 summarizes the statistics for the consensus LGs, and Supplementary Table S7 reports the locus name and its position for all loci in the 17 LGs in the consensus map. The length of the 17 LGs ranged from 19.0 cM (LG17) to 98.1 cM (LG13). The average genetic distance between loci was 2.3 cM. Gaps larger than 20 cM were found in LG 8 to LG11 and in LG14 (Fig. 2). The largest gap in the framework map was 43.9 cM and occurred in LG8. The large gaps observed in the individual maps were reduced in the consensus map. In total, 30 markers remained unlinked. The number of integrated (consensus) LGs was close to the actual number of haploid chromosomes in BPH (n = 15). The 17 LGs contained 518 loci that encompassed 1093.9 cM of the total map distance (excluding the distance from PM3n to the distal end of LG11) and covered 92.3% of the estimated genome size. According to the estimated genome size of BPH (1200 Mbp),11 the recombination rate is ~0.91 cM/Mbp.

Identification of markers linked with the sex chromosomesWe found that most SSR and SNP markers in LG16 of the CK population deviated significantly from the expected Mendelian segregation ratio of 1:2:1 (homozygous parental: heterozygous: homozygous parental). The segregation of all marker loci in LG16 was exploited to distinguish the X chromosome from the autosomes. If the genotypes of the F1 maternal and BC1 paternal parents are designated as X1X2 and X1Y1, respectively, there would be four equal proportions of BC1F1 genotypes in the offspring in which the females are X1X1 or X1X2 and the males are X2Y1 or X1Y1. In addition, a ratio of 2:1:1 [homozygous/hemizygous paternal bands (X1X1/X1Y1): heterozygous (X1X2): homozygous maternal band (X2Y1)] would be expected from the amplified DNA bands. The Y-specific dominant marker PM3n, which was informative in the CK population segregated in a 1:1 ratio, suggested that the CK population had an equal number of males (43) and females (44) in the BC1F1 generation. The observed ratio for all SSR markers in LG16 of CK population matched the expected ratio of 2:1:1, suggesting that these markers are located on the X chromosome (Table 2).

Of the 22 markers in LG11 of the KH population, 12 loci were codominant markers. Because the PM3n marker was not informative for the KH population, the sexes of BC1F1 were not determined. If we assume that the KH population had an equal number of males and females in the BC1F1 generation, the ratio of 2:1:1 would be expected for codominant markers. The codominant markers, including seven SNPs and five SSRs, segregated in a 2:1:1 ratio of homozygous/hemizygous paternal bands: heterozygous: homozygous maternal band in the KH offspring. Using 4% agarose gel to visualize the amplified fragments, we could not distinguish between heterozygous and homozygous genotypes for the paternal genotype of the 10 SSR markers in LG11. These markers were dominant markers, and segregated in a 3:1 ratio for all paternal band types: homozygous maternal band types. These loci also segregated in the ratio expected for a sex-linked marker (Table 2).4. Discussion4.1. Development and analysis of SSR markersEarly research focused on the development of SSR markers from BPH genomic DNA.38 Because of a lack of appropriate strategies at that time, few markers were developed. Later, after an enormous number of BPH ESTs became available,12 more than 350 e-SSR markers were developed to support genetic studies.17–19 Recently, 30 new g-SSR markers were developed via the FIASCO method.20 In the present study, we combined enrichment-based SSR isolation with next-generation sequencing approaches and demonstrated that this approach was a powerful tool for developing SSR markers from genomic DNA. Through these strategies, we developed 3160 g-SSR markers, of which 922 (29.2%) were successfully amplified and showed polymorphism among the BPH strains used as parents for the mapping. As the polymorphisms were detected on a simple agarose gel, only 418 SSR markers (45.3%) were informative. The remaining 54.7% were not informative, mostly due to banding patterns that were too difficult to interpret or bands that were too close together. The number of informative markers could be increased using more powerful fragment separation systems such as fluorescently labelled-fragment capillary arrays.The newly developed e-SSR primers in this study were less polymorphic (30.0%) when compared with the g-SSRs (45.0%). Likewise, the polymorphisms of the publicly available e-SSRs also were <32%. It might be because of greater DNA sequence conservation in transcribed regions. However, e-SSR markers produced a high proportion of high-quality markers with stronger and clearer amplified bands.4.2. Development and analysis of SNP markersWe found a large number of candidate SNPs (>100 000) between the two survey strains in the next-generation sequencing data. However, the frequency of valid SNPs for linkage analysis was low because of several difficulties in developing informative markers using the strategies described in this paper. The major reason for these difficulties was the lack of a reliable reference genome sequence for BPH. The draft assembly of the BPH genome contains a considerable number of intraspecies sequence polymorphisms, leading to insufficiently precise calling of SNPs. Although generating pure IBSs is an effective strategy for reducing heterogeneity, repetitive inbreeding is not easy because it decreases the fecundity and fitness of the BPH populations (T. Kobayashi, unpublished data). Differences between the strains used for the SNP survey (I87 vs. IBS-C89) and the linkage analysis (K10 vs. H66) also reduced the number of valid SNPs. To increase SNP markers in this species, high-quality reference genome sequences and a better strategy to evaluate potential SNPs will be necessary.394.3. Genetic linkage mapBased on the results of our study, we have constructed an SSR- and SNP-based linkage map for BPH. The genetic map consists of 518 markers that cover 1093.9 cM, with an average marker spacing of 2.3 cM. The majority of the mapped e-SSR and SNP markers were widely distributed among several LGs. Disagreement in the number of LGs between the two populations (KH and CK) might have resulted from the large portion of markers in some LGs (LG8 and LG11) and the existence of one small LG (LG17), possibly due to the relatively small number of BC1F1 individuals (<100) used for mapping and the lack of informative markers among LGs belonging to the same chromosome.40,41 The quality and accuracy of marker order in such maps depend on numerous factors, including segregation distortion, the population size, and scoring errors. In some cases, the quality can be improved and the problem can be solved.42 Numerous examples of a high level of deviations from Mendelian segregation ratios have been reported in previous studies (Bombyx mori,43Chlamys farreri,44 and Crassostrea gigas45). In our study, segregation distortion (P < 0.01) was observed for 8.7% of the total marker loci that we analysed. This may have several possible explanations, including inbreeding depression,46 sex-biased ratio distortion,47 erroneous scoring, or linkage between molecular markers and distorting factors such as recessive lethal genes or incompatible alleles.48Population size is one of the factors associated with the accuracy of detecting recombination events, and it can affect the efficiency of the mapping process.49 Because we used small population sizes, inaccurate marker order may have occurred due to inversions and marker distance. However, numerous linkage maps have been successfully produced from small mapping populations (50–94 individuals) in several species.40,50–52 To obtain accurate estimates of marker positions in the map, we only selected clearly polymorphic markers and carefully scored them to reduce errors and ensure the accuracy of the linkage map. Nonetheless, inversions of some markers were observed in several LGs of the consensus map (Supplementary Fig. S1). A more accurate marker order can be acquired by means of map validation, when a draft genome sequence for BPH becomes available.Recombination frequencies in mapping populations of some vertebrate and arthropod species show distinct differences between males and females.53–57 Although the mechanism responsible for these differences in recombination rates between the sexes is not well understood, the phenomenon is common. The conventional way to construct a linkage map is usually to analyse the two sexes separately. Because we collected the offspring of the mapping populations during their early growth stages, the sex of the offspring could not be identified. In addition, the number of females and males in the populations was too small to enable mapping separately within each sex. Consequently, we included both sexes in our linkage analysis to produce a single map. Developing separate linkage maps for the two sexes in future mapping experiments will provide a better understanding of differences in the recombination rates between the sexes of BPH.Mapping with multiple populations is advantageous because a larger number of markers can be placed on a single map, thereby providing greater genomic coverage. Integrated linkage maps have been constructed in various plant and animal species, including insects.52,58–60 We combined two genetic linkage maps from different genetic backgrounds derived from three IBSs that have different virulence against rice differential varieties to BPH,61 into one integrated map. The numbers of markers and the genomic coverage were increased by this approach, and the gaps between markers were reduced in the integrated map. However, the marker density of the final linkage map was still low when compared with the denser linkage maps of other model insect species (e.g. B. mori57,62 and Apis mellifera59). The construction of a highly saturated linkage map with full genome coverage will be possible in future research with more SNP markers. Nevertheless, the new SSR markers and the consensus map developed in the present study provide useful genetic and genomic tools for molecular analysis of the BPH genome and will facilitate the construction of a higher density second-generation linkage map.4.4. Determination of the sex-LGAs we could not identify the sex of individual nymphs in our mapping populations, we used the Y-specific marker PM3n63 as a sex-determining locus (Sex). In the consensus map, the putative location of PM3n was mapped at the distal end of LG11. Additional evidence to confirm the sex-LG would require X-linked loci. Because the e-SSRs were developed from the transcribed regions of the genome, mapping e-SSR markers directly shows the location of the corresponding genes within the linkage map. Vitellogenin genes exhibit female-specific expression and are generally located on the X chromosome in various organisms, including insects.64–68 An interesting feature of the present map is that six e-SSRs derived from vitellogenin genes17 were gathered in only LG11 of the consensus map. We tested the segregation of all marker loci on LG11 and found that all the markers fitted the segregation ratio expected for genes located on the X chromosome. The results indicated that LG11 corresponds to the X-LG in BPH. The X-linked markers would be useful in future genetic analysis of the sex chromosome.4.5. Conclusions and future perspectivesIn this paper, we report the development of g-SSR, e-SSR, and SNP markers and present a preliminary genetic map for BPH based on these markers. Two individual linkage maps from the KH and CK populations were integrated into a consensus map to increase locus density and provide more dense coverage of the genome. The consensus map consisted of 518 markers that covered a total of 1093.9 cM. Denser coverage is needed to reduce the gaps and group the smallest LGs so that the consensus map matches the actual number (15) of chromosomes. Additional SNP identification and mapping should be performed in future research. It should be possible to extend the genome coverage in this manner. The mean marker distance of 2.3 cM in the consensus map may offer enough resolution for the genetic dissection of QTLs for agriculturally important traits, and particularly the virulence of BPH against the host plant. An understanding of the genetics responsible for virulence is a crucial aspect for future management of BPH. In addition, the newly developed markers can be applied in various studies of the genetics and ecology of this species at a molecular level (e.g. population genetics, migration sources, and the evolution of BPH).The primer information is available at http://sogo.dna.affrc.go.jp/cgi-bin/sogo.cgi?class=unka.

IntroductionPoplars (Populus spp.) are widely distributed all over the world and are an important commercial tree species for timber production. In addition to their important economic value, in environmental protection, poplars also play key pioneer roles in the stability and sustainability of forest ecosystems.1,2 Many members of the genus Populus have been physiologically and genetically characterized based on their desirable biological characteristics, such as rapid growth, easy transformation, modest genome size, and ability to make interspecific crosses, propagate vegetatively.1,2 Thus, poplars have become a model species for studies of angiosperm trees, particularly because the whole genome of Populus trichocarpa has been sequenced and annotated (http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Poptr1/Poptr1.home.html).1 Additional genomics resources include databases of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) (http://www.populus.db.umu.se/index.html) and simple sequence repeats (SSRs) (http://www.ornl.gov/sci/ipgc/ssr_resource.htm), and these resources not only provide data for comparison of a long-lived perennial to short-lived model plants (e.g. Arabidopsis and rice), but also offer new opportunities to explore the genetic basis of wood formation, perenniality, and dormancy.2,3The Chinese white poplar (Populus tomentosa) belongs to the section Leuce within the Populus genus and is native to northern China with a distribution zone of 1 million km2. P. tomentosa is of major commercial importance in timber and pulp production and also plays an important role in ecological and environmental protection.4 A vast amount of genetic variation has arisen during the evolution of the species, as is evident in the natural populations.5,6 This accumulated genetic variation provides an important resource for the exploration of the molecular mechanisms of wood formation and is also a source of alleles for the potential improvement of wood products. However, conventional breeding programmes may not be sufficient to improve this long-growing species.6 Modern molecular breeding tools, such as molecular marker-assisted selection (MAS) breeding, could enhance important Populus agronomic traits, including growth rate, wood quality, and disease resistance. Hence, development of suitable genetic marker resources is an important foundation for MAS breeding.Among molecular genetic markers, single nucleotide polymorphisms are often used for genetic analysis. However, DNA microsatellites, or SSR markers, are excellent genetic markers because they are hypervariable, co-dominant, and therefore highly informative.7,8 Moreover, compared with SSR markers derived from random genomic locations, SSR markers derived from genes will likely provide a much greater degree of resolution in association mapping because they occur within the gene and thus may affect gene expression or function.6,8 In addition, genic SSRs exhibit relatively high transferability to closely related species and can be used as anchor markers for comparative mapping and evolutionary studies.6–9 Gene-based microsatellites have now been developed for a limited number of Populus species based on the P. trichocarpa genome sequence.10,11 However, very limited genomic information is available for P. tomentosa,4,6,12 and as the P. tomentosa linkage map was constructed using amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs),13 functional genomics studies of this economically important species are in their infancy. Furthermore, another important approach, the use of SSRs from fully characterized genes or full-length cDNA clones has not yet been utilized in Populus.Wood quality traits are considered to be quantitative, controlled by multiple genes, with moderate-to-high heritability.14 Currently, large numbers of candidate genes involved in wood formation have been isolated from P. tomentosa using direct sequencing methods, although many have not been published.4,6,15,16 Therefore, to improve the properties of wood using a MAS approach, identification and characterization of species-specific SSR loci from wood formation-related genes is a highly promising approach. Here, we make use of the large dataset of available gene sequences to identify a large number of gene-based SSR markers for P. tomentosa. The specific aims of our study were to: (i) characterize the genic SSR loci in P. tomentosa and evaluate SSR primers and polymorphisms in different wild-type varieties, (ii) test cross-species transferability within the genus Populus and conduct in silico analysis of SSR variation between P. tomentosa and P. trichocarpa, and (iii) examine inheritance segregation in a mapping population and analyze single SSR marker–trait association in a natural population. This study provides a valuable SSR resource for comparative genomic studies of the genus Populus, and the genic microsatellites also serve as ‘framework’ markers for construction of a physical map for alignment of the ongoing sequencing of the complete P. tomentosa genome.2. Materials and methods2.1. Microsatellite identification, primer design, and SSR polymorphism screeningTotal genomic DNA was extracted from young leaves using the DNeasy Plant Mini kit (Qiagen China, Shanghai), following the manufacturer's protocol. The reference gene models of 150 candidate genes involved in wood formation were obtained by BLASTX analyses against the NCBI database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) or from the JGI database (http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Poptr1_1/Poptr1_1.home.html) (Supplementary Table S1). Subsequently, a set of specific primers was designed for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of all 150 genes, and total genomic DNA (20 ng per reaction) from the P. tomentosa LM50 clone was used for amplification. All the PCR amplification products from LM50 were sequenced (both strands) using conserved primers, the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit, version 3.1 (Applied Biosystems, Beijing, China), and a Li-Cor 4300 genetic analyzer (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, Nebraska, USA). In all, a total of 696 792 bp of genomic DNA sequences from these 150 unique candidate genes, with an average of 4645 bp per gene, were obtained by direct sequencing, and the sequence data of the 150 candidate genes generated in this study were deposited in the GenBank Data Library under the accession numbers JX986583–JX986732 (Supplementary Table S1). These sequences were mined for genic SSR markers using the SSRIT software (http://www.gramene.org/db/searches/ssrtool).17 All microsatellite loci were located exclusively in the coding and/or regulatory regions of candidate genes, i.e. exons, promoters, 5' untranslated regions (UTRs), 3' UTRs, or introns. The ideal marker contained a minimum SSR repeat of five for dinucleotide repeats, four for trinucleotide repeats, and three for tetranucleotide or longer (more than pentanucleotide) repeats. A set of compound perfect repeat units was also identified. Mononucleotide repeats and complex sequence repeats were excluded.Primer pairs specific for the SSR flanking sequences were designed using the Primer 3 program (http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/primer3/primer3.FAQ.html), according to the parameters reported by Du et al.6 All SSR primers were initially screened using genomic DNA from the P. tomentosa LM50 clone (three replications). Amplification was carried out using standard PCR conditions with annealing temperatures (Ta) set according to the primer sequences. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis in 2% agarose gels. Electrophoresis products were visualized and photographed using the Fluorchem™ 5500 (Alfa Innotech Corp., USA) gel documentation system. Finally, a subset of optimal SSR primers was identified and designated as ‘validated genic SSR markers’.All validated genic SSR markers were scored for amplicon size polymorphisms among 15 wild P. tomentosa ecotypes that represented nearly the entire P. tomentosa geographic distribution (Supplementary Table S2).4,12 Observed product sizes and numbers of alleles per locus (NA) were calculated for each marker using POPGENE, version 1.32.182.2. PCR amplification and SSR genotypingThe SSR amplification reaction system and PCR amplifications were conducted following the procedure of Du et al.6 PCR product amplification was confirmed on a 2% agarose gel, and products were then separated by capillary electrophoresis using an ABI3730xl DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). The polymorphic loci were analyzed using GeneMapper, version 4.0, with the LIZ 600 size standard (Applied Biosystems).2.3. Cross-species transferabilityTo assess cross-species transferability and allele length polymorphisms, 30 randomly selected genic SSRs were genotyped in 26 ecotypes (24 species) belonging to 5 sections of the genus Populus, using Salix matsudana as the outgroup (Supplementary Table S3).The summary statistical parameters reflected intra- and interpopulation genetic diversity levels, including the observed allele sizes, polymorphism information content (PIC), expected heterozygosity (HE), and number of alleles (NA), that were calculated for each marker using POPGENE, version 1.32. The discriminatory abilities of genic SSRs were estimated using cluster analyses to assess phylogenic relationships among related Populus species. A neighbour-joining (NJ) dendrogram was constructed using the proportion of shared alleles coefficient from PowerMarker, version 3.2519 and was drawn using TreeView version 1.66 (http://taxonomy.zoology.gla.ac.uk/rod/treeview.html).2.4. In silico analysis of SSR variationsWe used in silico identification of genic SSR variations between P. tomentosa and P. trichocarpa to validate the true SSR cross-species transferability within the genus Populus. All 220 available homologous sequences of P. trichocarpa were identified in the JGI Database, based on 220 specific amplicons with SSR markers selected from P. tomentosa candidate gene sequences. MEGA, version 5.1 (http://www.megasoftware.net/), was used to compare the amplified SSR alleles with the SSR-containing sequences between the two species (i.e. repeat length, repeat motif, and mutations in flanking sequences).2.5. Testing inheritance in a linkage-mapping populationTo test the power of these novel genic SSR markers for constructing a family-based linkage map, 30 random genic SSRs selected from the 188 polymorphic markers (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table S6) were used to examine the observed segregation of markers, using 1000 F1 progeny from a controlled hybridization between a female YX01 clone (Populus alba × Populus glandulosa) and a male LM 50 clone (P. tomentosa).12 Mendelian inheritance of microsatellite variants (alleles) was determined from the observed distribution of progeny genotypes when compared with the expected segregation ratios (1:1, 1:2:1, and 1:1:1:1), based on the hypothesized genotypes of the parents by performing a chi-squared (<U+03C7>2) test at the 0.01 probability level in SAS, version 8.2, (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).

SSR marker–trait association studies in a natural populationFor association mapping, we used 40 genic SSRs randomly selected from the set of 188 polymorphic markers (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table S6), to associate with several wood quality traits in a natural population of 460 unrelated wild-type ecotypes from the P. tomentosa clonal arboretum, established in the national nursery of Guan Xian County, Shandong Province, China (36°23''N, 115°47''E), which represent all original provenances of this species (Supplementary Table S2).4,12In the natural population, wood property traits, including microfibre angle (MFA), fibre lengths, fibre widths, and holocellulose, a-cellulose, and lignin contents were measured according to the methods described by Du et al.20 Analysis of variance of these six phenotypic traits is shown in Supplementary Table S4. These 40 random genic SSRs were applied to test the degree of resolution of genic SSRs in association with these 6 wood property traits, using the unified mixed model method (MLM) with 104 permutations in TASSEL, version 2.0.1.21,22 In this Q + K model, the relative kinship matrix (K) was obtained using TASSEL, and the population structure matrix (Q) of the covariates was identified by Du et al.12 Corrections for multiple testing were performed using the positive false discovery rate (FDR) method with 104 permutations.233. Results3.1. Frequency and distribution of genic SSR markersBy sequencing 150 candidate genes related to wood properties, we identified 544 SSR loci located in 138 (92%) unique genes from 696 792 bp total sequence, for an average of 1 SSR per 1.3 kb. The perfect SSRs were not evenly distributed, ranging from zero to seven per gene (average, 3.6), and seven loci were compound SSRs containing at least one repeat motif (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table S1).Analysis of all 544 gene-derived SSR loci revealed that dinucleotide (325, 59.7%) and trinucleotide repeat motifs (144, 26.5%) predominated, followed by tetranucleotide (33, 6.1%), hexanucleotide (13, 2.4%), and pentanucleotide (12, 2.2%) repeat motifs (Fig. 2A). Of the identified SSRs, slightly fewer than half (46.1%) were located in promoter regions, including dinucleotides (57.4%) and trinucleotides (28.7%) (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Table S5A). Conversely, in exons, 37.5% were dinucleotides and 62.5% were trinucleotides (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Table S5A). The dinucleotide repeat AT/TA was the most abundant motif detected in all genic SSRs (177, 32.6%), followed by ATT/TAA (53, 9.8%), AG/TC (49, 9.0%), CT/GA (48, 8.7%), and AAT/TTA (16, 3.0%) (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Table S5B). SSR length was most commonly 10–20 bp (70.5% of total SSRs), followed by 21–30 bp (20.9%) (Fig. 2C). The largest SSR found was a 68-bp dinucleotide repeat (AT/TA).

Bars of different colours show the number of genic SSRs from dinucleotide and trinucleotide.3.2. SSR primer design, screening, and polymorphism testingTo determine whether the SSRs varied in length, and would therefore provide a useful marker, we designed flanking primers and determined the length of each SSR by capillary electrophoresis. Primer pairs specific for flanking sequences were designed for 481 of the SSR sequences (88.5%). Using the P. tomentosa LM50 clone, 413 primer pairs (85.9%) gave successful amplification, and the remaining 68 failed to generate PCR products at any annealing temperature used (Ta), and so were excluded from further analysis (Fig. 1). Of the 413 working primer pairs, 292 (70.7%) amplified PCR products of the expected sizes; however, 65 and 20 PCR products were larger or smaller, respectively, than expected, and the remaining 36 primer pairs generated multiple PCR products (Fig. 1). Details of the 292 optimal primers, including locus names, primer sequences, SSR repeat motifs, Ta, expected sizes, SSR sources (locations in genes), and GenBank accession numbers are provided in Supplementary Table S6. Distribution summaries, frequencies, and repeat motifs of these 292 genic SSR markers are provided in Supplementary Table S7A.To identify whether the identified SSRs varied in length in P. tomentosa, these 292 primers were subjected to further screening for polymorphisms in 15 wild P. tomentosa ecotypes. Twenty four primers amplified monomorphic products (1 band), 80 markers have identical heterozygotes among all 15 individuals (2 bands), and 188 primers (64.4%) generated clean and reproducible polymorphic bands (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table S6). The observed product sizes and numbers of alleles per locus (NA) were calculated for each marker. A total of 861 unique alleles were identified (Supplementary Table S6). For the 188 polymorphic markers from 107 genes, the NA ranged from 2 to 7 with an average of 3.6 observed alleles per polymorphic locus; in other regions, the mean NA values varied between 2.4 for exons and 4.0 for promoter regions (Supplementary Tables S6 and S7B).3.3. SSR cross-species transferability within the genus PopulusTo determine the utility of this SSR marker set beyond P. tomentosa, we screened a subset of the markers to determine whether they could be amplified from other related species, including Populus and the closely related Salix species. The capacity of 30 representative P. tomentosa genic SSR primers to screen for polymorphisms was tested in 27 ecotypes of related Populus and Salix species (Supplementary Table 3). All tested SSR primer pairs displayed a high amplification frequency within and across sections at the subgenus level within Populus. Of the 30 examined SSR markers, 12 (40%) successfully amplified in all species. The transferability of the 30 primers tested in Populus sections was Leuce (100%), Tacamahaca (90%), Aigeros (83%), Leucoides (80%), and Turanga (72%) (Table 1). In S. matsudana, the frequency of amplification was lower, and only 50% yielded product (Table 1). Thus, the developed SSR markers could be applied across the genus Populus and provided data on polymorphisms among related species (Supplementary Fig. S1).

Of the 27 ecotypes, 213 alleles were detected using the 30 SSR primers, with an average of 7.0 alleles per locus, ranging from 4 at SSR62 to 11 at SSR54 (Table 1). The PIC mean polymorphism level of the loci was 0.675, and it ranged from 0.411 for SSR65 to 0.841 for SSR54 (Table 1). In the five Populus sections, the mean NA values were from 1.1 (Leucoides) to 3.7 (Leuce). The other diversity parameters (observed lengths and HE) are shown in Table 1.We also tested whether these markers were informative for genetic analysis by determining whether the marker genotypes could be used to recapitulate the known phylogenetic relationship among the tested ecotypes. The NJ tree (Fig. 3) based on the shared allele coefficients from these 30 SSRs revealed the expected genetic relationships among all 27 ecotypes and clustered them into 6 main groups, in agreement with 5 putative sections, and the outgroup was derived from the basic botanical classification of these tree species.10,24,25 The relationships among species in each section are represented by the smaller branches within groups. In addition, we constructed trees based on the other functions in PowerMarker, and these were very similar to the NJ tree (Fig. 3) in that the six distinct clusters were again present, although there were slight differences in branch lengths within clusters (data not shown).

Comparison of SSR variation between P. tomentosa and P. trichocarpaIn addition to testing a subset of markers in multiple Populus and Salix species, we also examined these markers more extensively in the sequenced genome of P. trichocarpa. For all 292 genic SSR-containing sequences, only 75% (220) of homologous P. trichocarpa sequences (length, 90–593 bp) were identified (Fig. 1). Alignment and comparison of the homologous sequences between these two species for each marker revealed 10 types of mutations and variations in SSR loci and their flanking regions (Table 2 and Fig. 4). For example, the SSR53 locus, which contains an imperfect (CT) motif, showed complex mutations characterized by variation in the repeat-motif length and point mutations in both the repeat motif and the flanking sequences (data not shown). Of all 220 genic SSRs, 39.1% (86) were present in P. trichocarpa, with 57 showing only variation in repeat number in both species (conserved flanking sequences) and 29 that were monomorphic and had conserved sequences between the 2 species (Table 2). However, 41.8% (92) had polymorphisms of the SSR flanking sequences between the two species, suggesting that these SSR markers from P. tomentosa are not directly transferable to P. trichocarpa (Table 2). A comparison of the SSR markers with mutations in flanking sequences showed the highest proportion in 3'UTRs (60.0%) and the lowest in 5'UTRs (25.8%). A total of 25 new SSR markers were identified in the corresponding sequences of P. trichocarpa, of which 17 (68%) were derived from promoter regions (Table 2). Additionally, 100% of SSR markers from exon regions could be directly employed in genetic studies of P. trichocarpa (Table 2).

Ten types of mutations and variations for genic SSR loci with their flanking regions were identified (See Table 2 for details).Alignment and comparison of variations and mutations in genic SSRs with sequences homologous between P. tomentosa (01) and P. trichocarpa (02), based on a number of genic SSRs. Ten types of mutations and variations for genic SSR loci with their flanking regions were identified (See Table 2 for details).We determined whether the mutations in SSR repeat motifs were transitions, transversions, insertions, or deletions related to the P. tomentosa–P. trichocarpa comparison. An insertion of even a single base in the repeat motif, e.g. (AT)5 T (AT)3, and a deletion within the repeat tract, e.g. (AGG)3 AG_ (AGG)2, disrupted the continuity of the perfect repeat units. Transversions (38/63) were the most abundant mutations in the sequences of these two species, whereas insertions (4/63) were the least abundant (Table 3). Transitions and/or transversions accounted for 86% of the total mutations in the perfect repeats, whereas insertions and/or deletions were found in only 14%. T/C transversions were the most common substitutions that disrupted repeat continuity (Table 3).

Inheritance test of genic SSR markersTo further validate the usefulness of these genic SSR markers in genetic studies, we genotyped a randomly selected subset of 30 of the markers in a linkage mapping population of 1000 progeny from a controlled hybridization and tested for Mendelian segregation. Of the 30 genic SSRs, 5 loci (17%) were not used for analysis due to the presence of null alleles or unexpected lengths in the female parent. The remaining 25 loci segregated in the population (Table 4). Of the segregating loci, 2 were heterozygous in the female parent only, 4 were heterozygous in the male parent only, 17 were heterozygous in both parents, and 2 (SSR211 and SSR249) were homozygous in both parents, and thus resulted in offspring identical to the parents and with the expected heterozygote genotype (Table 4).

Eighteen were in accordance with Mendelian expectations (P = 0.01), with a segregation ratio close to 1:2:1 for 3 SSR loci, 1:1 for 5 loci, and 1:1:1:1 for the remaining 10 markers (Table 4). Thus, these novel genic SSR markers may represent a useful resource for linkage mapping in P. tomentosa.3.6. Genic SSR polymorphisms associated with wood property traitsFinally, to directly show that these markers could also prove useful for association mapping, we conducted a trial association mapping study using a subset of the genic SSRs to associate with traits affecting wood properties in Populus. For a random selection of 40 genic SSRs, single-marker association tests (240; 40 SSRs × 6 traits) were conducted using MLM. Twenty associations were found to be significant at a threshold of P < 0.05 (Supplementary Table S8). Multiple test corrections using the FDR method reduced this number to 12 at a significance threshold of Q < 0.10 (Table 5). These loci accounted for the phenotypic variance, with individual effects ranging from 4.0 to 8.9% (Table 5). Of these, a-cellulose and fibre length had three significant associations each, and holocellulose, MFA, and lignin had two significant associations each. However, no association with fibre width was detected (Q < 0.10, Table 5). The 12 associations represent 9 SSR loci from different regions of 9 candidate genes (Table 5). For example, SSR205 was located in the coding region (PtoC4H1 exon 1) that was associated exclusively with lignin (R2 = 8.9%, Q = 0.0211) (Table 5). For the holocellulose trait, SSR47 and SSR163, located in the non-coding regions of two candidate genes (PtoKorB and PtoCslA4), accounted for 4.3–8.7% of the phenotypic variance, and the SSR47 marker was similarly associated with a-cellulose content (Table 5). Significant SSR marker–trait pair associations in the natural P. tomentosa population (n = 460), after correction for multiple testing [FDR (Q) = 0.10]P = the significant level for association (the significance is P = 0.05); R2 = percentage of the phenotypic variance explained; Lignin = lignin content; Holocellulose = holocellulose content; and a-cellulose = a-cellulose content.Significant SSR marker–trait pair associations in the natural P. tomentosa population (n = 460), after correction for multiple testing [FDR (Q) = 0.10]P = the significant level for association (the significance is P = 0.05); R2 = percentage of the phenotypic variance explained; Lignin = lignin content; Holocellulose = holocellulose content; and a-cellulose = a-cellulose content.4. Discussion4.1. Development and characterization of genic SSR markersHere, we used a candidate gene approach to identify a set of SSR markers in P. tomentosa genes for wood properties, showing that this approach can provide useful genomics resources for linkage or association mapping and eventually for marker-assisted breeding to improve wood quality in this important timber crop. We successfully mined for genic SSRs in the sequences of 150 candidate genes associated with wood property traits. Our analysis of these SSR markers from P. tomentosa demonstrated that this approach may be useful for characterization of other pathways in P. tomentosa and for development of molecular markers for related model species with similar genomic resources. In our study, the frequency of genic SSRs was ~1 SSR/1.3 kb. Higher or lower frequencies of genic SSRs have been reported elsewhere.11,26,27 However, these frequency variations may be the result of the application of different SSR search criteria, methods, or the abundances of the sources of DNA sequences searched.8Dinucleotide motifs were the most abundant genic SSR markers (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Table S5A). This result is in contrast to previous findings identifying trinucleotide motifs as the most frequent genic repeats in most plant species,8,28,29 which may be attributable to the sources of the DNA sequences used (i.e. EST, cDNA, or gene sequences). In general, previous genic SSR makers were located in EST databases, and information about promoters and introns was not considered. Genic microsatellites are located mainly in promoters, introns, and UTRs of sequenced genes and are found at a lower frequency in conserved exons.8 This agrees with the distribution pattern we report here (Fig. 2A), suggesting that genic microsatellites may have a role in regulation of gene expression.8,11,28–30 Furthermore, polymorphism tests of 15 wild P. tomentosa ecotypes indicated that exonic SSRs contained less allelic variability than did non-coding SSRs (Supplementary Table S7B), which reflects the higher selection pressure on the coding portion of the genome.31,32Our analysis of gene-derived SSRs found that SSRs with AT/TA motifs (32.6%) were the most frequent. This is similar to the cases of P. trichocarpa and Arachis hypogaea.25,33 Previous studies have indicated that (AT)n is the most common dinucleotide motif in plant genomes.8,33 Thus, the genic SSR pattern identified in this study is likely to be a good reflection of genome-wide SSR frequencies. In trinucleotide SSRs, the polymorphism rate of the ATT/TAA SSRs is three times higher than that of AAT/TTA SSRs. This distribution suggests that AT-rich SSR loci may have a relatively high variability in P. tomentosa and also confirms the finding that AT-rich repeats (those repeats containing two or more A and/or T nucleotides per motif) are more common in non-coding regions.9,17,25,34In this study, 91.8% of the 292 optimal genic SSR primers produced at least 2 clean amplified bands, possibly due to the naturally occurring excess of heterozygotes in the P. tomentosa genome.12 Allelic diversity estimated for these polymorphic markers was an average of 3.6 alleles per locus, (range 2–7 alleles), and the value is lower than the NA (4.3) in a population of 460 P. tomentosa and some other related species, such as Populus nigra, P. trichocarpa, Populus tremuloides, and Populus euphratica.6,35,36 The level of allelic diversity reported in this study may be due to the limited sample size and/or the relatively conserved character of genic SSR markers. For generation of genetic maps, genic SSRs can determine the relative positions of transferable markers and directly compare candidate gene-containing SSRs and quantitative trait locus (QTL) locations across a broad variety of genetic backgrounds.8,25,29,32 The result of inheritance tests for 30 genic SSR markers suggests that many genic SSRs can be used for linkage mapping in P. tomentosa, and they are also useful for QTL and marker-aided selection of important traits. In addition, segregation distortion is increasingly recognized as a potentially powerful evolutionary force that may be beneficial for QTL mapping.37,38 The actual causes of the observed segregation distortions for markers are genes subjected to gametic or zygotic selection.37 Studies have suggested that epistasis contributes to segregation distortion, and segregation distortion may also be important for the evolution of many fundamental aspects of sexual reproduction.37–39The presence of SSRs in transcribed regions can result in changes in function, transcription, or translation. For example, SSRs in coding regions that result in amino acid changes can cause either loss or gain of function, SSRs in the 5'UTR can affect gene transcription or translation, SSRs in the 3'UTR can be responsible for gene silencing or transcription slippage, and SSRs in introns might act as transcriptional enhancers of gene expression.8,32,40 Previous study that phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) transcripts have been localized to develop xylem cells in aspen (P. tremuloides) stem, was consistent with its involvement in lignin biosynthesis.41 This report supported the identification of a single-marker non-coding association in PtoPAL2 that explained 4.6% of the phenotypic variation in lignin content (Table 5). Cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H1) is proposed to be associated with G lignin deposition,42,43 and a marker with significant association was located in the coding region (PtoC4H1 exon 1) that was associated exclusively with lignin (R2 = 8.9%, Q = 0.0211) (Table 5). Physiological studies of C4H genes describe unique functions for the isoforms within the lignin biosynthetic pathway.43 Similarly, other significant associations located in different candidate genes, such as sucrose synthase (SUSY), Cellulase (KOR), and Cinnamoyl-CoA reductase (CCR) (Table 5), were also supported by studies finding that they were involved in lignocellulosic cell wall development.3,14–16,43–45 Association analysis in this study suggests that genic SSRs have considerable power in candidate gene-based association studies to identify allelic variation in genes associated with important wood quality traits,20 and these markers have the potential to be useful in genetic improvement of lignin and cellulose biosynthesis in poplar.4.2. SSR variation among related species within the genus PopulusThe genus Populus contains six subgenera: Abaso, Leuce, Leucoides, Aigeiros, Turanga, and Tacamahaca, and Turanga is the most distant from Leuce.10,24,25,46,47 We found that genic SSR markers in P. tomentosa have relatively high amplification rates among closely related taxa, including species of the Leuce, Tacamahaca, Aigeiros, and Leucoides sections, but a lower amplification rate in Turanga (Table 1). This successful amplification rate in different sections was positively correlated with mean NA and PIC values (Table 1) that are due mainly to the phylogenetic divergence from P. tomentosa and is also related to the sampling species and their genetic backgrounds in each section. Furthermore, the amplification success rates were higher for members of the other subgenera, with the exception of Turanga (Table 1), suggesting that the amplification frequency varies in tandem with evolutionary distance, and this may be because the flanking regions of the microsatellite, where the PCR primers bind to the DNA, are more similar in phylogenetically close species than phylogenetically distant species.10,17,25,32 It should, therefore, be possible to predict the utility of these primers according to the genetic distance from P. tomentosa.Six distinct groups were identified within 27 samples, based on 30 genic SSR markers (Fig. 3). The dendrogram grouping showed the expected segregation of the different sections within the genus Populus, which agreed with the subgenus botanical classification level of Salicaceae,24,25,46,47 although a few species were not identified based on their putative relationships or as reported in other diversity studies.46,47 For example, Populus bolleana is a variety of Populusalba; however, these species did not group together in the closest branches, despite their shared ancestry (Fig. 3). Overall, this analysis roughly supports the botanical classification of the germplasm surveyed and hints at the usefulness of the genic SSR markers for genetic diversity studies and other Populus genotyping applications.In a comparison of genic SSR variations using homologous P. tomentosa and P. trichocarpa sequences (Table 2), we identified both repeat motif variations and mutations in the flanking sequences in most markers, and this shows that microsatellite mutation patterns are often complex in cross-species amplification. However, our findings indicate that the effects of mutations accumulated over evolutionary time can readily be studied. Point mutations disrupted the repeat pattern, and in addition to a new class of repeat motifs, size variations at microsatellite loci caused by indels (insertions or deletions) in flanking sequences have also been reported.32,40,48,49 We found the highest proportion of SSRs with mutations in flanking sequences in the 3'UTR (60.0%) and the lowest in the 5'UTR (25.8%). This suggests that variations and mutations in microsatellites may be influenced by the nature and functional composition of the flanking sequences.48,49 Transitions and/or transversions accounted for 86% of the total mutations of perfect repeat motifs in the two species (Table 3), indicating that base substitution of microsatellites is more common than length variation of homologous loci between closely related species.49 It also suggests that base substitution data are vital because genotyping using SSR alleles among related species is often erroneous, if based only on microsatellites of identical allele lengths obtained in electrophoresis. In silico identification of genic SSR variations in Populus is particularly useful for evolutionary studies and for increasing our understanding of the origin, mutational processes, and structure of microsatellites. Further reciprocal studies of microsatellite allelic variation in different species would shed additional light on directional evolution and genetic toxicology.40,48Overall, the reliability of comparison of microsatellite variation data among related species is higher than cross-species amplification success rates or polymorphisms. Comparison of microsatellite variation in these two species suggests that use of cross-species SSR primers to investigate functionally important allelic polymorphisms related to the traits of interest may be inefficient. Therefore, the direct development of species-specific primers is necessary for association mapping, due to the variation in repeat number only at each SSR locus (conserved flanking sequences) among all individuals of the same species.Supplementary DataSupplementary Data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.This work was supported by the State Key Basic Research Program of China (No. 2012CB114506), and the Project of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31170622, 30872042).Supplementary data"

IntroductionTranscription-induced chimerism (TIC)1 gives rise to chimaeric transcripts consisting of heterogeneous sequence segments originating from distant regions on the same chromosome or from two or more distinct chromosomes. Chimaeric transcripts from large-scale transcription databases were previously considered as contaminants. However, the increasing number of chimaeric transcripts has indeed been verified in vivo.2 Thus, there is good reason to take chimaeric transcripts seriously. Trans-splicing-mediated chimaeric transcripts have been widely observed in a variety of organisms. Trans-splicing is more frequently observed in lower unicellular eukaryotes and Caenorhabditis elegans and shows physiological significances.3,4 One of the most prominent examples involves Ciona intestinalis, in which the number of non-trans-spliced and trans-spliced genes is approximately equivalent.5 In Drosophila and mammalian cells, however, trans-splicing is less common, and the functional importance of most trans-spliced products is unclear.6,7 Later, Li et al. proposed a transcriptional-slippage model in light of short homologous sequences (SHSs) at junction sites in between fusion sequences.8Although most chimaera from higher eukaryotes are non-functional, those potentially encoded fusion genes could exert negative effects by competing with their parental genes,9 or serving as an oncogenic transcription factor via mistargeting on the chromosome, and altering chromatin structure.10 It is assumed that chimaeric transcripts expressed in normal and transformed cell might be mediated by two distinct mechanisms (transcription induced or chromosomal translocation induced),11 either of which might involve physical proximity between gene loci. It is reasonable to assume that because different sequence modules of transcription-induced chimaeric transcripts need to be conjugated, their expression should be concomitant, and that distinct pre-RNA products should be confined in a specific cell subcompartment with close three-dimensional (3D) proximity. The candidate of such structure might be the transcription factory.12 The fact that fewer transcription factories exist than the number of expressed genes indicates that multiple actively expressed genes need to share the same transcriptional machinery and that genes separated by a long genomic distance can migrate to each other closely.13 Thus, spatial proximity of distinct transcripts in the transcription factories might facilitate the production of chimaeric transcripts that in turn can be used as the signal of chromosome loci contact.Various polymer models have been postulated to describe the folding of compact but flexible chromatin fibre, which is crucial to gene expression activity.14 Among these models, the fractal globule model15 proposes that chromatin is folded initially into crumples and repeatedly into crumples-of-crumples. Some experimental support for this model comes from the in vivo screening on the chromatin contact with the Hi-C method developed by Lieberman-Aiden et al.16 An alternative view comes from studies,17–19 where a chromosome is viewed as an all scales-looped polymer.From the evidence presently available, a fusion process of heterogeneous transcripts is closely related to the spatial proximity of actively transcribed genes. In 2007, Unneberg et al. published the mapping results of transcription-induced interchromosomal interactions using the chimaeric expression sequence tag (EST) as the probe.20 After that, the increased number of data deposited in the databases has made possible a comprehensive study of chimaera and its relation to the 3D organization of chromosomes. Here, with chimaeric transcripts gleaned from human and mouse EST databases, we test the idea of TIC in terms of gene pairs' co-expression pattern. Comparing with normalized Hi-C contact maps21 also confirms that these chimaeric genes are more likely to be physically proximal. Unlike the previous study result,20 we show that the arrangement of chromosomes within the cell nucleus is non-random. No evident changes, however, can be observed from the interchromosomal interaction patterns of normal and the tumour cells. Based on the gene pairs located at every single chromosome, we obtain the relationship between the genomic distance and the gene contact frequencies. A functional behaviour (<U+2060><U+2060>, where  is the probability of contact between two loci that are genomically separated by x base pairs) is observed from our data with the genomic distance ranging from 500 to 7–8 Mb and an exponent a = -1 on a double logarithmic plot that agrees with the experimental results from Hi-C screening.162. Materials and methods2.1. Chimaeric transcripts identificationmRNA data were gathered from gbEST, gbHTC, and gbPRI divisions of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Genbank database (Release 186). Genome sequences of human and mouse were downloaded from NCBI Genome database (Release 37). EST library annotation was obtained from NCBI ftp as well. Gene annotation was downloaded from Ensembl genome database (Version 64).We used BLAT22 for sequence alignment, with the minimal identity threshold of 95% and the rest of the parameters at their default values. After aligning, alignments in each query were sorted according to the score and then the identity.Similar to previous studies,8,20 we picked out the queries with top two ranked alignments having the sequences identity not <U+02C2>95% and minimal alignment length not <U+02C2>50 bp for gbEST sequences. For much longer gbHTC and gbPRI sequences, a threshold of 100 bp was used. A 10 bp overlapping at the binding site of the query was allowed because of the uncertainty in aligning. To make sure that the two best alignments in a query were unambiguously aligned, a uniqueness criterion was imposed.20 Chimaeric transcripts with their boundary sites containing recognition sequences of the restriction enzymes used for library construction were removed. Similar to a previous study,8 SHSs on the boundary sites of these retained transcripts were checked.2.2. Gene mappingWe mapped the fusion sequences onto the chromosomes according to the Ensembl Genome database and selected transcripts whose partners were both mapped onto the gene regions with the same directions as the annotation. For sequences with both partners mapped with the opposite directions of the corresponding genes, we re-evaluated their directions according to the GT/AG rule. Considering the possibility of tandem transcription or intergenic splicing, we removed the chimaeric transcripts in cis with genomic distance between gene loci smaller than 500 kb.2.3. Co-expression pattern of the chimaeric gene partnersCo-expression pattern of human and mouse genes was obtained from COXPRESdb (Version 4.1),23 in which genes were indexed by their Entrez Gene IDs, and the Mutual Rank (MR) score was used as a measure for gene co-expression correlation. R package ‘biomaRt’ (Version 2.10.0) was used to convert the Ensembl Gene IDs of those mapped genes to the Entrez Gene IDs. To check whether the co-expression correlation of gene pairs in the chimaeric transcripts is non-preferential, MR scores of all possible gene pairs were used as a background.2.4. Comparison with normalized Hi-C contact patternWe used normalized Hi-C contact pattern of human lymphoblast generated by Yaffe et al.21 The ratio of the observed to the expected contact number in each 1 Mb bin was transferred by the logarithm to base 2 as a measurement of contact enhancement. The larger the enhancement value for a bin pair is, the more the contacts between them can be observed than by chance. Consequently, an enhanced contact probability indicates a closer spatial relationship. Gene pairs of the chimaeric transcripts were mapped onto the corresponding bins of the chromosomes, and the enhancement was screened. For genes spanning over more than one bin, the contact enhancement was calculated by averaging weighted contact enhancement for each 1 Mb bin pair covered. The enhancement distributions of all possible inter- and intracontacts were used as backgrounds. The Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was applied to check the difference of the contact enhancement between chimaeric gene pairs and the background.2.5. Inter- and intrachromosomal interactions pattern analysisChimaeric transcripts extracted from the gbEST database were used for interaction pattern analysis. Chimaeras involving the same gene partners were grouped together so as to remove the overcounts. We picked out transcripts composed of two genes labelled by ‘protein coding’ biotype in the human Ensembl database, which were far more abundant than others, as the observed interchromosomal interaction pattern. We collected the frequencies of contact between two given chromosomes to obtain the interaction matrix and plotted the data as a heat map. From the human Ensembl database, we obtained the frequencies of protein coding genes on 23 chromosomes except chromosome Y. With these expected gene frequencies, we constructed a random matrix of chromosome pair-wise interaction by multiplying the gene frequencies from any two given chromosomes. For this symmetric matrix, each element in the upper half of the matrix was multiplied by a random number, and the corresponding element in the lower half was assigned the same value. This finished a shuffle step on the interaction pattern, and the eigenvalue of the matrix was calculated. Totally, 105 steps were carried out. After that, the mean eigenvalue was obtained and plotted against the eigenvalue from the observation. Furthermore, based on the cell source annotation from the human EST library report, we separated the interactions from normal cells from those from tumour cells and plotted the eigenvalue of interaction for comparison.For intrachromosomal interactions, we made statistics on the frequencies of the gene–gene interaction under given genomic distance within every chromosome and plotted the frequencies of the interactions versus the genomic distance in a double logarithmic plot. For human, the contact probabilities were divided by their corresponding genomic distance for normalization and replotted against the genomic distance.3. Results and discussion3.1. Chimaeric transcripts validation and genome mappingThe number of chimaera selected from gbEST, gbPRI, and gbHTC databases is given in Table 1. Detailed information about the validated chimaeric transcripts can be found in the Supplementary Data. We analysed the distribution of human chimaeric transcripts among the EST libraries. Of 8995 human libraries screened, 2617 (29%) were involved in the production of chimaera, and none of them overlapped with those highly contaminated libraries.24 As shown in Fig. 1A, most libraries contributed very few chimaera. One thousand one hundred and eleven and 518 libraries from a total of 2617 human libraries provided only one and two chimaera, respectively. A compatible result is found for mouse (Fig. 1B). Such a result indicates that chimaera formation is an ubiquitous event with low frequency. Summary of the chimaeric transcripts identified from different databasesThe GG column represents the number of chimaeric transcripts whose partners were both mapped onto the gene regions with the same directions as the annotation. The UG column indicates the unique gene pairs identified from chimaeric transcripts of gene–gene interaction. The genes column corresponds to the number of genes participating in the chimaera production. Under GG, UG, and genes columns, left subcolumns indicate the number for interchromosomal interaction and the right ones denote intrachromosomal interaction. The size column shows the average length (unit in base pairs) of validated inter- and intrachromosomal chimaeric transcripts. And, the overlap column indicates the number of chimaeric gene pairs identified from the gbHTC or gbPRI database, which can also be found at the gbEST database.Summary of the chimaeric transcripts identified from different databasesThe GG column represents the number of chimaeric transcripts whose partners were both mapped onto the gene regions with the same directions as the annotation.

The y-axis indicates the number of libraries producing the corresponding amount of chimaeric ESTs.From validated chimaera, most gene interactions were observed only once, whereas some gene partners associated with each other more frequently. In addition, some of these reoccurring chimaera can be identified from multiple different EST libraries, whereas other repeats originated only from a single library. Detailed mapping results are shown in Table 1. The abundance of SHSs with different size is shown in Supplementary Fig. S1.3.2. Co-expression pattern of the chimaeric gene partnersOf the total of 8934 validated human chimaeric transcripts, 7412 gene partners with both genes Entrez Gene IDs known were collected. For mouse, 2229 gene pairs were obtained from 2453 chimaeras. As shown in Fig. 2, gene pairs from the chimaeric transcripts associated more frequently with small MR score than with a large one, when compared with the co-expression pattern of all possible gene pairs. This observation revealed that gene pairs producing chimaeric transcripts showed stronger positive correlation in terms of their expression activities. This observation further supported the assumption that lots of identified chimaeric transcripts, if not all were transcription induced.2Co-expression pattern of genes from the chimaeric transcripts.

Comparison with normalized Hi-C contact patternFrom the enhancement distributions shown in Fig. 3, both for inter- and intrachromosomal chimaeric transcripts, a shift towards larger enhancement can be seen with either kind of restriction enzyme. For intrachromosomal contacts, a large enhancement can be see for the tail, i.e. for gene pairs that are several mega base far away. Although the occurrence of long-range interactions is relatively low, their contact probabilities are much higher than expectation, which suggests a closer spatial distance between genome regions involved. From the cumulative distribution function (CDF) curves shown in Supplementary Fig. S2, one can clearly see that the CDF of observation lies below that of background, which indicates that a higher contact probability between chimaeric genes is given over that of the random case.

Interchromosomal interaction patternWe picked out the unique ‘protein coding’ cases of interchromosomal gene interactions (for human, 6999 out of 8261 transcripts) and plotted these as a heat map (Fig. 4A), according to where the chromosomes' gene partner was localized. As illustrated by the ‘protein coding’ gene frequencies on human chromosomes (as shown in Fig. 4B), the interactions between chromosomes with higher gene content show a correlation as well. Because the expression data were collected from a variety of cells with different types and developmental stages, it cannot easily be determined whether or not there is a preference on the interaction of given chromosome pairs. But, what is evident is that the observed pattern is different from the pattern achieved from random interaction. This comparison can mathematically be done by comparing the eigenvalues of the heat maps viewed as matrices (Fig. 5A). Interchromosomal interaction pattern for human chromosomes. (A) Contacts as a heat map of human interchromosomal gene interactions. Protein-coding genes were used as a measure of interactions.

None of the eigenvalues from the observed pattern fell into the corresponding confidence interval. (B) Patterns from human normal cells and tumour cells (excluding the chromosome Y).Comparison of interchromosomal interaction patterns via eigenvalue.

None of the eigenvalues from the observed pattern fell into the corresponding confidence interval. (B) Patterns from human normal cells and tumour cells (excluding the chromosome Y).Furthermore, we separated the chimaera according to the cell sources from which they originate (normal or tumour cell lines). Then, we constructed the interaction matrix and tried to compare the patterns from normal and tumour cell lines. For both cases, we acquired ~3500 chimaera. A slight difference is observed for normal and tumour cells, but the correlation coefficient between the eigenvalues of two contact matrices is computed as 0.998, which indicates that two contact patterns are by and large the same (Fig. 5B). Especially to the chromosomal translocation-mediated fusion transcripts in tumour cells, the ‘contact-first’ model and the ‘breakage-first’ model have been postulated.25 Under either scenario, a spatial proximity effect is obvious.25 Consequently, both chromosomal translocation-mediated and transcription-mediated fusion transcripts can be used to indicate the physical proximities between genes. Through a literature curation, we found that two gene pairs (RGS17/TBL1XR1 and BCAS3/BCAS4) identified from the human ESTs libraries have been verified to be spatially proximate by fluorescence in situ hybridization experiments.26,27 Chimaeric transcripts involved are listed in the Supplementary Data.3.5. Intrachromosomal interaction patternFor the intrachromosomal gene loci interaction data, we calculated the frequencies of gene–gene interactions for given genomic distances. The genomic distances between gene partners ranged from 509 Kb to 244.4 Mb. We plotted the probability of contact versus the genomic distance between gene partners on a double logarithmic plot. Two different types of behaviour can be observed. Below the distance of 7–8 Mb, a functional  exists with an exponent a = -1 (see the double logarithmic plot shown in Fig. 6). Above this distance, a quite different pattern is observed. The rapid drop for large genomic distances might result from the limitation of interaction data when the genomic distance is increased. To our surprise, a comparable pattern was observed for mouse as well, even though its EST coverage is not as high as that of human. With caution, we speculate that a general strategy for chromatin compaction might be utilized in mammalian cells. On account of the difference in the contact probability of chromatin with different length, we normalized the contact frequencies by the genomic distance and replotted the pattern of human. After normalization, as shown in Supplementary Fig. S3, under relative short genomic distance, the contact probability remains stable. When the genomic distance is increased, the contact probability rises until a plateau is reached. The dropping at the end might be due to the data depletion.

Confidence intervals(95%) of the slopes are shown.3.6. DiscussionFrom the human and mouse EST databases, we identified chimaeric transcripts with verification. Based on what we currently know about TIC and transcription factories, ‘genuine’ chimaera of this kind, functional or not, might originate from product interactions while being transcribed. A further analysis on the co-expression pattern of gene pairs in the examined chimaeric products revealed a strong correlation in their expression. To make the expression of chimaeric gene partners synchronous, two gene loci might be recruited to the same transcription factory, which, in turn, would decrease their spatial distance and increase the possibility of their aberrant ligation. This observation further supports the assumption of TIC1 and the role of the transcription factories in gene transcription events,12,13 as well.Some chimaeric gene pairs in cis or in trans have been experimentally confirmed to be spatially proximate.26,27 To further validate the spatial association of these chimaeric gene pairs, we checked the contact probability of chromosomal regions, where chimaeric genes localize. Although only a normalized contact map of human lymphoblast is available so far, we still can see contact enhancement between some chimaeric genes. Considering the difference in expression profile of different cell lines, chimaeric gene pairs collected from other cell lines might not be actively expressed in the lymphoblast, which meets no requirement of the TIC. Thus, more chromosome contact maps from diverse cell lines would be helpful to confirm the spatial proximity of these chimaeric gene pairs. On the other hand, however, it is not necessary for each chimaeric gene pair to be functionally related. Considering the fact that a limited amount of the transcriptional factories exists in the cell nucleus, genes sharing the same transcriptional apparatus might just be temporal related.For the time being, it is still too early to draw definitive conclusions about interchromosomal interaction pattern, but a probabilistic non-random arrangement of chromosomes seems plausible in mammalian cell nucleus.28 From our observation, what can be confirmed at present is that the chromosomes pair-wise association pattern is not random, when compared with the pattern with chromosomes distributed arbitrarily. Some researches have shown that the relative arrangements of some chromosomes are conserved and independent of cell types, whereas others seem to be cell-type specific.29 The same is true with regard to the chromosomal rearrangement in tumour cell, a cell line in which disease-related fashion was observed.29 The observation that some chimaeric transcripts can be expressed in genetically rearranged cells and in normal cells raises the possibility that such physical proximity between gene loci might be preserved after the chromosomal translocation. This might be an explanation of the slight difference detected from the interchromosomal interaction patterns of normal and tumour cell lines.The pattern reflected by the intrachromosomal loci interaction is very informative. From 500 to 7–8 Mb, the interaction probability shows a specific mathematical form (i.e. an exponential form) that is consistent with the data from chromosome conformation capture experiments. Thus, at this scale, the architecture of chromatin folding fits well with the experimental results16 and with a model recently proposed.17,30 In mouse, although it has fewer data, a coarse pattern compatible with that from human is seen as well. For the complexity of higher eukaryotic nucleus, the genomes must be well organized, covering several different length scales to keep an ordered but flexible architecture and to exert their functions properly. The strategy used by mammals for chromosome organization might be conserved across the species. Furthermore, the pattern shown after distance normalization indicated that a basal folding schema might exist. This basal form of condensation might organize the chromatin fibre into a series of units for subsequent folding. Due to the increase in the stiffness and the bulk size of the chromatin fibre after folding, the contact probability rises along with the extended genomic distance.Supplementary dataSupplementary Data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingS.L. gratefully acknowledges funding from the Heinz-Goetze-Foundation and the Heidelberg Graduate School of Mathematical and Computational Methods for the Sciences.The authors appreciate here the assistance from M.

IntroductionEukaryotic cells possess a remarkable capacity to aggregate together and form into a clump, which is crucial for the assembly of tissues and nervous systems, embryonic development, and cellular communication. Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the single-cell eukaryote, is also able to agglomerate cells into organized structures such as flocs, biofilm, and pseudohyphae. These non-sexual clumps create protective shields for cells in inner parts to escape from abiotic/biotic attacks,1 respond to nutrient starvation,2,3 and have been widely used in industrial productions.4 Thus, understanding the underlying mechanisms of the cellular behaviour has significant medical and evolutionary implications. However, most studies in the literature have focused on flocculation, a non-sexual type of cell clumping, induced by interaction between cell wall glycoproteins encoded by highly homologous flocculation (FLO) genes (FLO1, FLO5, FLO9, and FLO10).5,6 In particular, FLO1 was reported to be a key gene whose expression led to strong flocculation1 and was transcriptionally activated by FLO8.7,8 So far, these studies followed a reverse genetic approach to screen for the flocculins that bound specific sugar residues on the surface of other cells and led to formation of cell flocs.9,10 However, the reverse approach has been debated for its requirement of prior information on the underlying pathways leading to phenotypic expression of the traits,11 ignorance of the interactions between a gene of interest and the genetic background, and its incapacity to detect crucial polygenic interactions on phenotype.12–14We present here a forward genetic approach to uncover the molecular basis of genetic variation in non-sexual cell aggregation in a natural population of budding yeast (S. cerevisiae). The approach integrates mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTL) with major effects on the cell aggregation trait, resolving the major QTL into the QTL genes, identifying causative nucleotides within the QTL genes, and characterizing molecular functions of these QTL genes and their interactive effects on the trait.2. Materials and methods2.1. Yeast strains and growth conditionsAll yeast strains used in the present study are listed in Supplementary Table S1. YH1A, an isogenic haploid strain of the standard reference strain S288C, was crossed with YL1C, also a haploid strain described elsewhere.15 F1 hybrids from crossing the parental lines were sporulated to generate 292 segregants that were equivalent to gametes, forming an F2 generation. We created two other isogenic haploid strains from the parental lines with changed mating types through modifying their HO genes. We used the standard yeast media and growth conditions in mating, sporulation, and tetrad dissection experiments in the present study.162.2. Scoring phenotype of cell aggregationThe method used to score phenotype of cell aggregation in this study was modified from that proposed by Guo et al.6 In detail, any strain preserved under –70°C was recovered by plate streaking, and three single clones for the strain were obtained. Each clone was cultured in a 5-ml YPD liquid medium at 30°C at 280 rpm for 22–24 h to make the cells enter the stationary phase of growth. The cultures were swirled briefly with a vortex shaker before a sediment test. Phenotype of the tested strain was recorded as a sedimentary time in hours (T), i.e. the time taken for the tested cells to sink completely in the culture buffer in a test tube. On the basis of the sedimentary time records, we grouped phenotype of all tested strains into four categories when contrasted with the sedimentary records of the parental strains, TYH1A and TYL1C, which are illustrated in Fig. 1a. Phenotype of a tested strain was scored as one if T = TYH1A, two if TYL1C < T < TYH1A, three if 0 < T = TYL1C, or four if T = 0. In other words, phenotype of cell aggregation was quantified as a categorical character with multiple thresholds in the present study. QTL fine mapping.

To generate these images, the tested cells were first stained with Gram's iodine and then observed and photomicrographed using a Leica fluorescence microscope. All images illustrated in this paper were printed at the same magnification.2.3. Marker development and genotypingWe first searched the genome sequence of yeast S. cerevisiae (http://www.yeastgenome.org/) for short tandem repeats (STR) within the genome by making use of the computer software Tandem Repeats Finder 3.21.17 We tested 561 evenly distributed STR sequences from the search as candidate markers and confirmed 264 STR loci that exhibited polymorphism between the two parental strains. These polymorphic markers were used as the basic marker set in the primary mapping experiment. Primer sequences for amplifying these STR markers were detailed in our previous study together with the experimental protocols for collecting and analysing STR genotype data.15 Beyond these STR markers, we developed a second set of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers to be used in the second stage of fine scale mapping of cell aggregation QTL by directly sequencing the relevant DNA regions. This added other 25 SNP markers in the QTL regions inferred from the primary QTL mapping (see marker locations and primer sequences in Supplementary Table S2).2.4. Gene knockout, gene replacement, and nucleotide-specific mutagenesisWe implemented the standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based gene disruption techniques to knock out the candidate genes.18,19 Single- and dual-knockout strains were constructed by replacing the target genes with the anti-hygromycin and anti-nourseothricin genes. The triple knockout strain was selected from offspring segregants from crossing of the dual-and single-knockout parental strains. All knockout strains obtained in the present study were confirmed by PCR experiments. The primer sequences for these PCRs are available upon request from the corresponding authors.To perform the allelic exchange experiments and nucleotide-directed mutagenesis, we replaced the allele in situ with the replacement modules comprising the counterpart alleles and the Zeocin resistance gene as a dominant marker (detailed in Supplementary Figs S7 and S8).2.5. Preparation of RNA samples and RT-qPCR analysisCells from a tested strain were cultured in 50 ml YPD liquid medium until reaching OD600 = 0.8. Total RNA was isolated using the hot phenol protocol,20 purified with RNase-free DNase (Promega), and subjected to first-strand cDNA synthesis with SuperScriptTM III Reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). One microlitre of the single-strand cDNA after 10-fold dilution was used as template for real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) with SYBR-green (Toyobo) and ACT1 as the internal control. Every tested strain was independently cultured three times to gain three independent samples, and each of the samples was assayed for three repeated times of qPCR. The oligonucleotide primers for the three genes assayed were RGA1f: 5'-CGGTACAGTCACTGGAATCGAA-3', RGA1r: 5'-ACGAATCAAACCTGGAGCAAA-3';AMN1f: 5'-AGGCAAATACACACAGGTGGAA-3', AMN1r: 5'-TTCCCAAATACCGGCATCA-3'; and ACTINf: 5'-TCGTTCCAATTTACGCTGGTT-3', ACTINr: 5'-CGGCCAAATCGATTCTCAA-3') for RGA1, AMN1, and ACT1, respectively.We first sequenced the FLO1 gene of the two parental strains, YL1C and YH1A, and found that there were only 44 bp in the FLO1 gene, which distinguish FLO1 from the paralogous genes FLO5 and FLO9 (Supplementary Fig. S6). The sense primer of qPCR was designed across the 44-bp specific region, whereas the antisense primer on a non-specific region in 87-bp downstream. The respective specific sequences were ‘GCCTCATCGCTATATGTTTTTGG’ and ‘GCTGGTAAGCACGCCTCTGT’. The PCR product was sequenced and its specificity was confirmed.2.6. Preparation of protein samples and western blotting assayWe followed the PCR-based epitope tagging method to insert 6His into the C-terminal of the target protein as an epitope.21 Proteins were extracted using the protocol described by Adams et al.16 Western blotting was performed using the standard laboratory procedures with monoclonal antibody specific for 6His (Univ. Co, China).2.7. Yeast two-hybrid analysisYeast two-hybrid assay in the present study was carried out according to the manufacturer's manual (Clontech, CA USA). Three alleles of AMN1 (i.e. AMN1YH1A, AMN1YL1C, and AMN1V368D) were cloned independently into the vector pGADT7 (GAD), whereas TEM1 was inserted into the vector pGBKT7 (GBK). These vector constructs were confirmed by sequencing before being introduced into the reporter strains AH109 and Y187. These strains were then screened for positive co-transformation of the paired plasmids through growing them on the SC-Trp-Leu plates, synthetic complete medium lacking tryptophan and leucine. Positive interactions between AMN1 and TEM1 were detected as successful growth of the co-transformed strains on high-stringency SC-Trp-Leu-His plates (synthetic complete medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine) in the AH109 system.22 The positive interaction was also confirmed independently through the quantitative ß-galactosidase assay in the Y187 system.232.8. Data analysesWe implemented a Bayesian approach based on Gibbs sampling as proposed in Sorenson et al.24 to estimate additive genetic variance component and, in turn, heritability of the multiple categorical phenotype of cell aggregation. In the statistical analysis, yi, phenotype of the ith segregant, is determined by a simple liability model <U+2060>, i.e. yi = j (1 = j = 4), if <U+2060>. In the liability model, µ is the population mean,  is a random variable of additive genetic effect of the segregant on its phenotype, and  is the residual or environmental random variable. We assumed that the random variables,  and <U+2060>, follow independently a normal distribution with mean zero and variance  and a standard normal distribution, respectively. The threshold parameters satisfy <U+2060>. We implemented the algorithm developed by Dr Zhaobang Zeng at North Carolina State University for carrying out multiple-interval mapping of QTL affecting the multiple categorical phenotype of cell aggregation.253. Results3.1. Characterizing cell aggregation of yeastWe first established a reliable and feasible method to quantify the aggregation phenotype, which was essential for a quantitative genetic analysis and further functional analysis with the cellular behaviour character. The left panel in Fig. 1a shows sediment status of cells from the clumpy and non-clumpy parental strains YL1C and YH1A and their four representative segregants at three sediment time points, 0, 1.0, and 2.5 h. Thus, cell aggregation was, here, scored as a categorical quantitative trait, with the two parental strains, YH1A and YL1C, having phenotype categories 1 and 3, respectively and their offspring being scored as one of the four possible categories. In particular, cells of the segregant four sunk immediately in the clumping buffer (0 h) and the segregant was scored as category 4, a phenotype outside of the range of its two parents, showing transgressive segregation of the complex cell behaviour character. This method of categorizing the clumping character coordinates very well with that of the microscope views of the cell flocs, indicating the feasibility and reliability of the phenotyping assay.3.2. Mapping and dissection of cell aggregation QTLFrom crossing the parental strains, YH1A and YL1C, that are highly divergent in cell aggregation phenotype, we created a full-sibling population comprising 292 segregants. We scored the segregants for their clumping phenotype and genotyped them at 264 segregating simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. Based on the phenotype and marker genotype data, we implemented the multiple-interval mapping method25 for a preliminary genome-wide scan for QTL affecting the multiple categorical phenotype of cell aggregation. The analysis detected four significant QTLs that mapped on the yeast chromosomes I, II, V, and XV, respectively. To narrow down these QTL regions, we genotyped the segregants at 1, 9, 4, and 11 further SNP markers in the 3 QTL regions, respectively and reran the multiple-interval mapping analysis. Because the chromosome I and V QTLs contain FLO1 and FLO8, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S1), two previously known genes involved in flocculation in S. cerevisiae,5,26,27 our focus here was on the other two QTLs on the yeast chromosomes II and XV. Figure 1b shows the likelihood profiles for the two major QTLs together with physical maps of candidate genes within the QTL regions. It can be seen that the fine mapping enables to resolve the chromosome II QTL into six candidate genes and the chromosome XV QTL into seven candidates.3.3. Major-effect genes for cell aggregation and causative nucleotide in chromosome II QTLAmong the six candidate genes within the chromosome II QTL (Fig. 1b), three (RIB7, RPB5, and CNS1) are essential genes. We first knocked out each of the remaining three (SLI15, ICS2, and AMN1) in both the parental strains, YH1A and YL1C, and then evaluated the knockout strains for their clumping phenotype. We found that phenotype of the clumpy parental strain, YL1C, was dramatically altered after its AMN1 gene was knocked out (Fig. 2a). To further consolidate the candidacy of AMN1 as the QTL gene, we carried out an allelic exchange experiment, in which the AMN1 allele of the YL1C strain was replaced with that of the YH1A strain and vice versa. The aggregation phenotype of YL1C was clearly reduced after its AMN1 allele was replaced by that of YH1A (Fig. 2b). Moreover, the non-clumpy strain, YH1A, showed cell aggregation when its AMN1 allele was replaced by that from YL1C (Fig. 2b). These findings provide the strong evidence supporting that AMN1 is indeed the major clumping QTL gene. It should be noted that effects of replacing AMN1 alleles are not reciprocally constant between the two parental strains. Cell aggregation phenotype of engineered parent strains across QTL genes.

Meanwhile, we assayed their expression at both transcriptional and translational levels through RT-qPCR and western blotting assays. Although the AMN1 gene is expressed significantly differentially between the two parental strains at both the mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 3c), the polymorphisms in the open reading frame (ORF) are sufficient to lead to phenotypic variation according to the results of allelic exchange (Fig. 2b).We further used site-directed mutagenesis to identify the causative quantitative trait nucleotide(s) in the QTL gene AMN1 by replacing the AMN1 gene of the YL1C strain with three different DNA segments of 2150 bp in length from the strain YH1A, accordingly. The segments covered the whole coding sequence of the AMN1 gene with the YH1A origin, but differed only at each of the three mutant nucleotides. We assayed these genetically modified strains for their clumping phenotype and found that only the strain that carried the V368D substitution in the AMN1 gene could recover the phenotype of YL1C (Supplementary Fig. S2a), strongly supporting the mutation as the causative quantitative trait nucleotide.3.4. V368D variation determined the cell aggregation phenotype through the MEN pathwayIt has been reported that AMN1 plays a key role as a daughter-specific switch that helps cells exit from the mitotic exit and reset the yeast cell cycle through binding to Tem1, a Ras-related GTPase. The TEM1 gene activates a signal transduction pathway, mitotic exit network (MEN) to allow mitotic exit.28 Based on this observation, we performed the yeast two-hybrid experiment in a standard strain AH109 and demonstrated that only Amn1YL1C and Amn1V368D can bind to Tem1 effectively (Fig. 4a). The quantitative ß-galactosidase analysis yielded the results that were highly consistent with the two-hybrid analysis (Supplementary Fig. S3). Furthermore, we compared expression of the downstream genes DSE1, DSE2, and SCW11 between YL1C and YH1A, using the Affymetrix microarray hybridization data described previously in Wang et al.29 These genes were reported to underlie the cell wall degradation and daughter cell separation,30 and the expressions could be activated by Ace2, the transcriptional factor regulated by the MEN pathway.31 Our study shows a significantly lowered level of expression of these genes in YL1C than in YH1A (Fig. 4b), suggesting that the transcription of DSE1, DSE2, and SCW11 would be inhibited in the clumpy parent strain, YL1C. Then, we constructed two strains both derived from YL1C, which differed only at the 368th amino acid residue of Amn1. The expression of these downstream genes DSE1, DSE2, and SCW11 exhibited significant difference between the strains (Fig. 4c). These observations support the hypothesis that the V368D substitution in the Amn1 of the clumpy parent YL1C enhanced its binding to Tem1 and, in turn, blocked the MEN pathway, reduced transcription of the downstream genes DSE1, DSE2, and SCW11, and finally resulted in inhibition of daughter cells' separation and formation of clumps (Fig. 4d).

RGA1 as the chromosome XV clumping QTL geneTo dissect the chromosome XV QTL, we screened for the candidate(s) that responded to knockout and gene replacement treatments. Of the seven ORFs within the QTL, only when the RGA1 gene of the clumpy strain YL1C was silenced through knockout, its clumping phenotype was visibly altered (Fig. 2a). In addition, the phenotype was also changed significantly when its RGA1 allele was replaced with that from YH1A (Fig. 2b). These observations strongly support the candidacy of RGA1 as another major QTL gene. We compared the Rga1 sequence between the two parental strains and detected four polymorphic sites (Fig. 3b). We failed to find a single nucleotide substitution that could explain the observed change in the phenotype, although we found that the third polymorphic site in the gene had a significant causative effect on invasive growth of the yeast cells (Supplementary Fig. S4). Furthermore, we compared, but did not detect any significant change in expression of the RGA1 alleles between the two parental strains at either the transcriptional or translational level (Supplementary Fig. S5).

(c) Comparison in mRNA and protein expression of AMN1 between the two parental strains, YH1A and YL1C.Rga1, a member of the Cdc42 GTPase-activating protein family, has been reported as an apical and isotropic switch in controlling the budding pattern of yeast cells by influencing hydrolytic status.32,33 In the presence of normally functional RGA1, Cdc42-GTP hydrolyzes and becomes Cdc42-GDP, leading to axial budding of cells that shows round cell morphology. The cells show bipolar budding and elongated morphology when their RGA1 is silenced. However, it should be stressed that effect of the RGA1 on cell budding and morphology would be only partial because there exist other family members such as RGA2 and BEM3. Their presence may compensate for defects of the silent RGA1.34 In light of the observation, we examined joint effects of the two verified QTL genes, RGA1 and AMN1, on cell aggregation. Figure 5 illustrates sequential influences of the two major clumping QTL genes, RGA1 and AMN1, on budding pattern, cellular morphology, and cell separation of the clumpy strain YL1C. When the AMN1 gene alone was knocked out whereas RGA1 remained normal, the strain showed cell separation and largely round shape. When only RGA1 was silenced whereas AMN1 functioned normally, daughter cells of the strain were inhibited to separate from mother cells. Some of the cells then displayed bipolar budding and apical attachment between mother–daughter cells in elongated shape, resulting in smaller clumps, and the presence of strings comprises a few apically linked cells. Whenever both the genes were knocked out in the clumpy strain, cells were promoted to bud in bipolarization, and inhibition of cell separation was released, leading to formation of bar-like cell clumps. These explain why single-knockout strain of AMN1 has a more defected phenotype than dual-knockout strain.

FLO1, FLO8, and transgressive segregationOur QTL analysis detected two significant QTL regions containing the two genes relevant to flocculation, FLO1 and FLO8. To test their candidacy as major cell aggregation genes, we first compared sequence of the two genes between the two parental strains, YH1A and YL1C, and found that the FLO1 allele in the clumpy strain YL1C had eight fewer tandem repeats of an intragenic domain than those in the non-clumpy parent YH1A. This disagrees with the previous observations that the degree of cell flocculation was found to be proportional to the number of tandem repeats of the intragenic domain structure.1,35 Comparison of genic sequence of FLO8 between the two parental strains revealed a nonsense substitution at the 425th nucleotide in YH1A, consistent with the previous study.26 The mutation creates a stop codon (TAG) and results in a truncated protein. The defective FLO8 in YH1A cannot activate expression of its FLO1, thus explaining why the FLO1 gene did not lead to stronger flocculation as previously expected, although the non-clumpy strain carried the allele enhancing flocculation phenotype.We knocked out the FLO1 and FLO8 genes individually in YH1A and YL1C and observed that the clumping phenotype of YL1C was markedly altered after either FLO1 or FLO8 gene was silenced (Supplementary Fig. S2b). Moreover, we replaced the FLO8 allele in YL1C with the YH1A-derived counterpart and observed a similar phenotype to the FLO1 or FLO8 deletion strain (Supplementary Fig. S2b). The data showed that genetic variation of both the FLO genes contributed significantly to the clumpy phenotype. We attempted but failed to replace the FLO1 gene in the same way as reported above. This can be attributed to the difficulties arising from the location of the FLO1 gene at the chromosomal end with rich heterochromatin, thus keeping the gene in a protected status from genetic modification. Secondly, the FLO1 gene has an extremely high level of homology with its family members FLO5 and FLO9, making it extremely difficult to ensure specificity in replacing the target gene.Although it was highly technically challenging to profile expression of the FLO1 gene due to its extremely high level of sequence homology with other FLO family members FLO5 and FLO9, we succeeded in assaying expression of the FLO gene in the two parental strains through an FLO1-specific RT-qPCR experiment (see Supplementary Fig. S6 for detail). We analysed the FLO1 and FLO8 expression levels of the parental strains and their eight offspring individuals with two different genotypes at the QTL genes and varying phenotypes. FLO8 expression showed no difference in the tested strains. Moreover, a highly expressed FLO1 gene was common for the strong cell clumping phenotype (the phenotype categories 3 and 4) but was certainly not an indicator of clumpiness because the gene was also observed to be highly expressed in the non-clumpy strains (those with phenotype category 1) (Fig. 6a).

Red horizontal line represents the top boundary of cell sediment.Intriguingly, 30 extremely clumpy segregants (T = 0) exhibited more strongly clumpy than parental strains, which is termed as transgressive segregation. To explore how the QTL genes affect the transgressive segregation, we first grouped the 292 segregants into 4 panels of 16 groups according to their allelic origin or joint genotype at the 4 QTL genes. Figure 6b illustrates distributions of the segregants with different phenotypes (1–4) within each of the four-gene genotypes and shows that the segregants receiving the four QTL genes from the clumpy parent, YL1C, have a much lower probability of expressing extreme clumpy phenotype (phenotypic category 4) than those with a YH1A-derived allele of FLO1, indicating a dispersion distribution of cell aggregation causing alleles at the QTL genes between the two yeast parental strains and thus explaining the transgressive segregation observed in the segregant population. Moreover, the phenotypic effect of the FLO1 allele was highly background dependent. This FLO1 allele would not cause the clumping phenotype in the absence of the other three QTL genes from the clumpy parent YL1C (group 7 vs. group 3 in Fig. 6b), but plays the role of clumping enhancer.Given the fact that the flocculins leading to cell flocculation share a common three-domain structure and require Ca2+ ions to stabilize the structure,9 we explored the effect of Ca2+ ions on clumping phenotypes of the two parental strains and their two segregants (S2 and S5) that showed the transgressive phenotype. Figure 6c shows that the cell aggregation phenotype of the strains S2 and S5 was reduced to the extent of YL1C when Ca2+ ions were chelated with the ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid treatment (panel 2), but recovered when the ions were added as CaCl2 in the clumping buffer, suggesting that the transgressive phenotype can be attributed to FLO gene family. This assumption was confirmed by the further knockout experiments in which the transgressive phenotype was disrupted when either FLO1 or FLO8 was silenced in S2 and S5 strains (Supplementary Fig. S2b). Strikingly, the treatment did not result in altered phenotype of the clumpy parental strain (YL1C). This together with the fact that this parent carried the non-clumpy FLO1 allele indicates that the phenotypic response to the Ca2+ treatment actually reflects response of the Ca2+-dependent cell aggregation induced by the cell wall protein, which differs from that mediated by AMN1.We assessed relative contribution of the QTL genes to phenotypic variation in cell aggregation and found that genetic variation in AMN1 explained 25% of the phenotypic variation, whereas the other three QTL genes FLO8, RGA1, and FLO1, respectively, explained 17, 5, and 11% of the variation. Variation between aggregative genotypes at all the four genes explained 46% of the phenotypic variation. To further explore the joint and interactive effects of the genes, we generated three dual-knockout strains (YL1C-amn1<U+0394>&flo8<U+0394>, YL1C-amn1<U+0394>&rga1<U+0394>, and YL1C-flo8<U+0394>&rga1<U+0394>) and one triple-deletion strain (YL1C-amn1<U+0394>&flo8<U+0394>&rga1<U+0394>). Phenotypes of these engineered strains are shown together with other single QTL gene knockout strains and the wild-type strain in Fig. 2. Although the degree of cell aggregation of the single-gene knockout strains was further reduced when they were knocked out for additional one or two of the QTL genes, it is clear that different configurations of the knockout QTL genes have led to different degrees of clumpiness. This, together with the observation illustrated in Fig. 6b, reveals that the QTL genes show clearly epistatic effects on cell aggregation.4. DiscussionThe genetic architecture underlying a quantitative trait is determined by the number of genes that contribute to their additive and interactive effects on variation of the trait phenotype.36 Although many genomes have been fully sequenced and the number of genes with annotated function increases rapidly in the era of functional genomics, it still remains a great challenge to reconstruct the architecture with a full insight of the genetic parameters. Budding yeast, the single-cell eukaryote, but with probably the richest structural and functional information of the genome, provides an ideal model for dissecting the molecular basis of genetic variation in typical quantitative traits such as high-temperature growth12 and sporulation efficiency37 and in genetic control of transcriptome abundance.38 The present study extends these successful examples by dissecting multiple-threshold phenotypic variation of yeast cell aggregation into a genic level.Several genes have been reported previously in the literature to control clumping phenotype variation in budding yeast. Of these, the most prominent are the FLO gene family responsible for many cellular adhesion phenotypes, including flocculation.10 In sharp contrast, the present study reveals the two novel genes, AMN1 and RGA1, in addition to previously identified two genes, FLO1 and FLO8, that are significant determinants for the phenotype. Success of the present study in resolving the mapped QTLs into the underlying QTL genes can be attributed to that the major QTLs have been mapped at the high resolution by which direct gene targeting becomes possible. We noted that the simulation study by Li et al. predicted a much larger confidence interval for mapping categorical traits from a simulated backcross population with 200 individuals genotyped at genetic markers of every 10 cM. When compared with the simulation study, the present analysis has employed a substantially larger sample size (292 segregants) and higher density of markers in the QTL regions. These together with the fact that the budding yeast has a highly recombiogenic and compact genome paved the basis for the mapping resolution we have achieved.The combined effect of these QTL genes explains 46% of the overall phenotypic variation, leaving the remaining 54% of the variation to be residual. The residual variation can be explained as two parts as well as their interaction, the genetic component whose underlying genetic effects are too small to be detected by the experiment, and the component contributed by environmental modification to the quantitative trait. In addition, we demonstrated that the QTL genes exhibited clear epistatic effects on the aggregation trait. These show that the underlying mechanism of yeast cell aggregation is more complicated than expected in the previous literature.Of these QTL genes, AMN1 plays the leading role in regulating cell aggregation. We provide strong and direct experimental evidence that supports this is through the genes modulating the mitotic exit network in S. cerevisiae.28 We have identified the AMN1 as a major QTL gene of cell aggregation through a genome-wide QTL scan in a natural population and provided here the direct experimental evidence for the V368D substitution as the causative genetic variant. Our results also strongly indicate the putative domain of AMN1, and the functional significance of V368D, which has been recently predicted as a superfamily being highly conserved (e-value of 6.38e-96) across species.39 On the other hand, the RGA1 gene, a member of the GTPase-activating family, is first identified in the present study as a major gene affecting cellular clumping in budding yeast. This gene is required for yeast cells to switch from the apical to isotropic growth phase.40 The present study creates an opportunity to explore the joint effect of this cell aggregation QTL gene, a budding pattern controller, and another QTL gene AMN1, also a mitotic exit regulator. Genetic modification to these genes through gene knockouts disperses the well-known grape-like strings of cells (Fig. 5).In addition to the above two major genetic factors, FLO1 and FLO8 were also detected as the QTL genes through the present forward genetic analysis. Highly expressed FLO1, a cell surface adhesion regulator, has been widely recognized as a biomarker for cell flocculation in many candidate-based analysis. However, we present here the role of the gene, as merely one of the building elements in the genetic architecture underlying the complex phenotype, and show that FLO1 is highly background dependent in determining the phenotype of its carrier. Unlike what has been widely accepted in the literature of yeast cell flocculation, expressed FLO1 does not necessarily confer a clumping phenotype to its carriers. We demonstrate that the FLO1 allele from a non-clumpy parental strain, in the presence of the other three QTL genes from a clumpy parental strain, creates the genotype for the clumping phenotype that substantially surpasses performance of both the parents, i.e. transgressive segregation of the QTL genes. Taking all these together, the QTL genes unveiled in the present study have been shown to be involved in multiple pathways that govern the cellular development (RGA1), the behaviour of daughter cells (AMN1), and the cell-surface adherence property (FLO1 and FLO8). In contrast to the studies in which biological functions and their phenotypic significance of these QTL genes were examined either independently or jointly, the present study unveils the QTL genes as major determinants of the clumping phenotype in a systematic way. This clearly indicates the power and appropriateness of the forward genetic approach employed in the present study in uncovering the genetic basis of an aggregate polygenic trait such as cellular clumping that involves multiple constituent components.The evolutionary significance of cellular clumping has recently been highlighted in the single-cell species because the clumping phenotype can protect inner individuals in cell clumps from biotic or/and abiotic stresses such as alcohol, anti-microbials, and physical attacks. The FLO1 gene is recognized as a ‘green beard gene’ because its induced expression in a non-flocculent laboratory strain, S288C, can restore its cells to flocculate, and the cellular flocs, thus, generated provide a cooperative shield to protect from stresses in the living environment.1 Our data demonstrate that expression of FLO1 may not be the biomarker for a clumping phenotype, although an unexpressed FLO1 allele from the non-clumpy strain, which is isogenic to S228C, may enhance clumping of its offspring strains carrying other major clumping genes. In the polygenic system uncovered here, AMN1 is found to be a more important genetic determinant than FLO1 in controlling expression of the clumping phenotype, and this endogenously expressed gene may make a more appropriate target for investigating the molecular mechanism underlying the ‘green beard’ effect.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available atwww.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by the National Basic Research Program of China (2012CB316505) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (91231114, 31271335).We thank Prof. M.J.

IntroductionProtein degradation is an important post-transcriptional regulatory process that allows cells to respond rapidly to intracellular signals and changing environmental conditions by adjusting the levels of key proteins. One major proteolytic pathway in eukaryotes involves the Ubiquitin/26S Proteasome System (UPS) that utilizes the post-translational modification of proteins by ubiquitin. The UPS involves the enzymatic activities required for the polyubiquitylation of target proteins, and then for the proteolysis of these tagged proteins by the proteasome. This polyubiquitylation is achieved by the sequential actions of three enzymes: an E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme, an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme and an E3 ubiquitin ligase. E1 activates and links free ubiquitins that will be transferred to one of the E2 enzymes, whereas E3 ligase enzymes promote ubiquitylation by mediating a specific interaction between E2 enzymes and the target protein.1–4The specificity of the ubiquitination process is ensured by the E3 ubiquitin ligases encoded by a large multigene family. A survey of sequenced plant genomes showed that they contain more than 1000 E3 ubiquitin ligases. For example, the annotated Arabidopsis thaliana, rice and soybean genomes contain 1415, 1332 and 1402 E3 ligase-encoding genes, respectively.5,6 E3s comprise a diverse family of proteins or protein complexes that can be distinguished in terms of their mechanisms of action and types of interactions. They act either as single subunits, such as homology to E6-AP C terminus, really interesting new gene and U-box or multisubunit complexes such as SkP1 S-phase Kinase-associated Protein 1–CulL1 (Cullin 1)–F-box (SCF), Cullin3-Bric a brac-Tramtrack-Broad, Cullin 4-DNA damage-binding 1 and anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome.3,5SCF complexes are a major type of E3 ubiquitin ligase consisting of two constant subunits (ROC1 or Rbx1 and Cullin-1), a moderately variable subunit (SKP1) and a highly variable substrate recognition subunit known as F-box protein.7,8 F-box proteins contain a conserved F-box domain (40–50 amino acids) at the N-terminus, which interacts with Skp1 proteins. They have highly variable protein–protein interaction domains at the C-terminus, which confer substrate specificity for ubiquitination.7,9 Beside the canonical SCF, it appears that in some cases, Skp1 and F-box proteins may function in non-SCF complexes and that some F-box proteins have functions of their own.10 F-box proteins are represented by large families in different organisms. There are 11 F-box protein-encoding genes in budding yeast, 68 in humans, 74 in Caenorhabditis elegans, 337 in poplar, 539 in medicago, 692 in Arabidopsis and 779 in rice.11,12 Different research groups have classified Arabidopsis and rice F-box proteins in several subfamilies or subgroups based on their phylogenetic relationships or unique functional domains.7,9,13 Whereas humans and yeasts have a single SKP1 gene, many animal and plant species possess multiple SKP1 homologues14, for example, 7 in Drosophila, 21 in C. elegans denoted Skr, 21 in C. elegans and 21 in Arabidopsis denoted ASK and 32 in rice denoted OSK.3,15–17 Based on the finding that the C. elegans genome contains 21 SKP1-related genes,15,16 these authors questioned whether all these genes could interact with other components in the SCF complex (i.e. Cullin1 and F-box proteins). Both studies used the Y2H system to demonstrate that Skr proteins displayed varied patterns of interaction with Cullins and F-box proteins. While Skr1 (which is thought to have a function similar to that of the human SKP1) interacted with most of the F-box tested, and the remaining Skr displayed differing interaction capabilities.16 In addition, both studies showed that the 21 C. elegans Skrs displayed various expression profiles and tissue-specific patterns and different RNAi phenotypes, indicating their involvement in a variety of pathways.15,16 Subsequently, several exhaustive yeast two-hybrid screens were used to analyse the Arabidopsis SKP1-like family (ASKs). It was demonstrated that the 21 Arabidopsis ASK proteins displayed substantial differences in their abilities to interact with different F-box proteins and that ASK1, ASK2, ASK11 and ASK12 could interact with COI1, FKF1, UFO and other F-box proteins.18 The ASK1 and ASK2 genes seem to be the most important SKP1 homologues in A. thaliana; both of them are expressed widely and at high levels.8,14,18During a phylogenetic study, Kong et al. analysed the evolution of SKP1-like genes in a wide range of plant species, but with particular emphasis on Arabidopsis and rice and suggested that all the SKP1 genes found in these species derived from a single ancestral gene represented by ASK1 in Arabidopsis and OSK1 in rice, and that these genes could have similar functions.14Despite the importance of the SCF complex, there have been few reports of systematic surveys of interactions between the dozens of SKP1-like proteins and the hundreds of F-box proteins. The objective of the present study was, therefore, to uncover the various capabilities of SKP1-like proteins to interact with F-box proteins in rice. Nine F-box proteins representative of the most frequent domains containing F-box proteins, and the whole set of SKP1-like proteins (OSK), were studied. In total, 540 binary interactions were tested using the yeast two-hybrid approach. We showed that the 30 rice SKP1-like proteins displayed various interaction patterns with the tested F-box proteins and that OSK1 and OSK20 exhibited the most frequent interaction capabilities. Our results also suggest that rice OSK1 and OSK20 might be functionally equivalent to ASK1 and ASK2 in Arabidopsis.2. Methods2.1. Data retrievalKong et al.17 evoked the presence of 32 SKP1-like genes in the rice genome, but described only 28 genes in their phylogenetic study. We followed the same nomenclature during our study, although we added three OSK genes (OSK8, OSK24 and OSK31) and replaced Kong's OSK14 with a more accurate accession. For details, see Supplementary Table S1. In addition, OSK18, which contains an internal retrotransposon, was excluded from subsequent studies. Thus, a total of 30 OSK genes were retained for further analyses. Nine F-box proteins belonging to F-box families in the rice genome were selected from the inventory compiled by Jain et al.7 The Rice Genome Annotation Project [RICECHIP.ORG: Support for Annotation & Functional Analysis of the Oryza sativa (Rice) Genome (http://www.ricechip.org/)] was used to identify the number of Expressed Sequence Tags (EST) for OSK and F-box genes in various rice tissues (July 2011).The PLAZA platform (http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/plaza/, version 2.5) was queried to retrieve SKP1-like genes from the sequenced genomes of 11 eudicot, 5monocot and 1 moss species. All retrieved sequences were checked manually for consistency and for the presence of SKP1 signatures, using the InterProScan program.192.2. Structural analysis of the SKP1 familyMultiple protein sequence alignments were generated using the Muscle software20 implemented under MEGA5.21 The maximum likelihood method was used, and phylogeny was tested with a bootstrap of 500 (Poisson's correction model) to construct a phylogenetic tree with MEGA5.21 The entire set of 288 SKP1-like proteins from the moss, monocot and eudicot species retrieved from Plaza (http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/plaza/) were checked for the presence and positions of introns within the gene. The conservation of intron position was used as a criterion to identify putative ancestral SKP1-like genes, as suggested by Kong et al.17 In this study, an intron was considered to be conserved, if it occurred between two aligning bases in the alignment of the coding sequences.222.3. Meta-analysis of the expression of rice SKP1-like genesThe Affymetrix probe sets corresponding to rice SKP1-like genes were retrieved from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com). Probe sets that recognized multiple genes were excluded from the analysis. Organ distribution (anatomy analysis) of the expression of rice SKP1 genes was determined using Genevistegator (https://www.genevestigator.com/gv/).23 Hierarchical clustering analyses were performed using Robust Multi-array Average (RMA)-normalized data corresponding to 871 publicly available experiments (http://bioinf.mind.meiji.ac.jp/Rice_network_public).24 The data corresponding to SKP1 genes were extracted (Supplementary Table S2) and analysed using the MeV 4_5_1 software (http://www.tm4.org/mev/). The SKP1 genes were then clustered according to their expression profile using the Euclidean distance and complete linkage methods.2.4. Total RNA extraction and isolation of OSKs and F-box cDNAsTotal RNA was isolated from 3-week-old leaf rice (O. sativa L. var. Nipponbare) following the method described by Bogorad et al.,25 with slight adjustments for small samples(0.5 g). The RNA was then treated with DNaseI (Invitrogen). The SuperScript II reverse transcriptase and oligo-dT primer (Invitrogen) were used to synthesize the first strand cDNA. The forward and reverse primer pairs used to amplify the 13 OSK cDNAs are shown in Supplementary Table S3, as are the primer pairs used to amplify the 5 F-box cDNAs. Then, 1% agarose gel and the GFX Purification Kit (Amersham) were used to separate and purify the PCR products. Because we failed to amplify and then clone all the SKP1 and F-box coding sequences from the tissues available, 17 OSK and 4 F-box cDNA were chemically synthesized by Proteogenix (France). Both the synthesized and amplified cDNAs were then cloned and treated alike.2.5. cDNA cloningpENTR™/D-TOPO® cloning kits (Invitrogen) were used to clone the inserts. Under this system, PCR products are cloned directionally by adding four bases to the forward primer (CACC). Entry clones flanked with attL1 and attL2 sites necessary for recombination into the destination vectors are then obtained. All constructs were checked by sequencing, and a total of 30 OSK genes and 9 F-box genes were cloned and sequenced.2.6. Binary yeast two-hybrid analysisGateway Cloning Technology (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used to produce hybrid proteins. The yeast expression vectors pDEST™32 and pDEST™22 were used to generate GAL 4 DNA-binding domain and GAL4 DNA activation domain fusion proteins. The LR reaction (Gateway Technology, Invitrogen) was performed to clone 30 OSK and 9 F-box in both directions into the destination vectors.The MaV203 Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain (ProQuest™ Two-hybrid System, Invitrogen) contains deletions in its endogenous GAL4 and GAL80 genes for use with GAL4-based two-hybrid systems. This strain also has leu2 and trp1 mutations for the selection of ProQuest™ bait and prey vectors. MaV203 contains three GAL4 inducible reporter genes, providing four phenotypes, to enable the easier identification of true interactors.Bait and prey vectors were transformed together in the MaV203 yeast strain using the ProQuest™ Two-hybrid System (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's manual. Each co-transformation was plated onto a nutritionally selective plate that was deficient in tryptophan and leucine (Sc-Leu-Trp), to test for positive transformation. X-gal assays based on induction of the lacZ reporter gene were used to verify the interactions between fusion proteins. Constructs that gave a positive interaction were checked for self-activation according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The yeast cells were co-transformed with a bait or prey plasmid and an empty plasmid. Self-activation tests were performed using the HIS3 reporter gene encoding an enzyme involved in histidine biosynthesis. This enzyme can be inhibited by a competitive inhibitor, 3-aminotriazole (3AT). The addition of 3AT at concentrations of 10, 25, 50 or 100 mM in a histidine-free culture medium increases the stringency of this test. The empty vectors and pEXP32/Krev1 and pEXP22/RalGDS-m2 vectors were used as negative controls, whereas yeast strains which were co-transformed with the pEXP32/krev1 and pEXP22/RalGDS-wt vectors were used as positive controls (Invitrogen).2.7. Protein extraction and immunoblottingTo check for the actual production of fusion proteins, total yeast proteins were extracted according to the method described by Printen and Sprague26 and separated by electrophoresis with the Mini-PROTEAN TGX (Tris-Glycine eXtended, BIO-RAD) on either precast 10% gels or 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Protein samples were blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Hybond™ ECL™, GE Healthcare Life Sciences) using a liquid transfer system (Criterion™ Blotter, BIO-RAD) in a transfer buffer (25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, 20% v/v methanol, pH 8.3). The fusion protein blots were probed with primary anti-GAL4-BD mouse monoclonal antibody (sc-510, Santa Cruz Biotech, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) and secondary goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP antibody (sc-2005, Santa Cruz Biotech, CA, USA) at dilutions of 1/500 and 1/10 000, respectively and visualized using chemiluminescence as instructed by the manufacturer (ECL, Amersham, Pharmacia). Each immunoblot assay was repeated at least twice.3. Results3.1. Structural analysis of rice OSK genes and other plant SKP1-like genes: SKP1-like gene intron identificationPLAZA (http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/plaza/) was used to help in identifying the presence and position of introns within each OSK gene. In a first step, the rice OSK genes were placed in three different classes according to Kong et al.17: type Ia corresponding to OSK genes containing one intron, type Ib corresponding to intronless OSK genes and type II corresponding to OSK genes containing more than one intron. Details of the structure and a description of the rice OSK genes are given in Supplementary Table S1. In a second step, we retrieved and analysed 288 SKP1-like genes belonging to 17 species including the moss Physcomitrella patens, 5 monocots (Brachypodium distachyon, O. sativa ssp. Japonica, O. sativa ssp. Indica, Sorghum bicolor and Zea mays) and 11 eudicots (Arabidopsis lyrata, A. thaliana, Carica papaya, Fragaria vesca, Glycine max, Lotus japonicus, Manihot esculenta, Medicago truncatula, Populus trichocarpa, Ricinus communis and Vitis vinifera) (Supplementary Table S4). Genes belonging to the three classes (type Ia, type Ib and type II according to Kong et al.17) were found in each species. However, careful examination of nucleotide and protein alignments revealed that SKP1-like genes containing a single intron could be split into two subclasses. In the first subclass, the intron was in a conserved position, i.e. occurring between two aligning bases in the alignment of the coding sequences (Fig. 1).22 In addition, whereas the first exon and the single intron were variable in length, the second exon was constant and was 174 bp (or 58 amino acid) long (Fig. 1). The second subclass of plant SKP1-like genes with a single intron contained SKP1 genes, where both the intron and the two exons were of variable length. A survey of the whole set of plant and moss SKP1-like genes indicated that each species contained at least one gene with a conserved single intron (A. lyrata, F. vesca and L. japonicus). However, the majority of plant species contained two or three genes with a single conserved intron. When the different classes of SKP1-like genes were considered, it was clear that the majority of plant SKP1-like genes were intronless and represented 50% of the entire set (144 out of 288). The results of this survey are summarized in Supplementary Table S5. Phylogenetical analysis of the 40 plant SKP1-like genes with a conserved single intron indicated that these genes formed 3 main clusters corresponding to the moss, monocot and eudicot groups (Fig. 2). The grouping, thus, observed was mainly determined by the first exon, which was more variable between species than the second exon (Fig. 1). Interestingly, SKP1-like genes originating from the same species generally clustered. However, some genes originating from different species also clustered together, indicating possible orthology relationships. For example, in the monocots, SB05G012740 and SB02G031280 from sorghum clustered, respectively, with ZM04G05180 and ZM07G31190 from maize while RC28962G00160 and RC30170G05850 from Ricinus clustered, respectively, with ME07520G02920 and ME02943G00470 in M. esculenta. Multiple alignment of exons in plant SKP1-like genes generated with weblogo 3.2 (http://weblogo.threeplusone.com/manual.html). The sequence logo was derived from the alignment of 40 exons in plant SKP1-like gene with a conserved single intron, showing the high conservation of exons 2. The vertical axis shows the data content in bits. The overall height of the stack indicates sequence conservation at that position, whereas the height of the nucleotide within a stack indicates its relative frequency at that position.

A phylogenetic analysis of 40 plant SKP1-like genes with a conserved single intron indicated that these genes form 3 main clusters corresponding to moss, monocot and eudicot groups. Their evolutionary history was inferred using the maximum likelihood method based on the Poisson correction model. The tree with the highest log likelihood (-3400.1299) is shown. This tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths measured in the number of substitutions per site. This analysis involved 32 amino acid sequences.

Expression profiles of the rice Skp1-like genesGene expression profiles can provide indications concerning gene functions. We looked for evidence of the expression of all OSK genes in the EST databases and found that EST sequences were available for 12 out of the 31 OSK genes. The number of EST also varied significantly in various tissues/organs, indicating the differential expression of OSK genes (Supplementary Table S6). Within the set of expressed OSK genes, OSK1 was the most strongly expressed and was represented by 43.6% of ESTs, whereas OSK20, OSK8, OSK22 and OSK28 were represented by 16, 12.7, 9 and 7% of ESTs, respectively. The cumulative percentage of these genes accounted for about 88.3% of all the ESTs detected (Supplementary Table S6).In addition to this EST-based analysis of expression, we surveyed the expression profiles of OSK genes during various developmental stages using the Genevestigator platform (https://www.genevestigator.com/gv/).24 The microarray data from 1475 arrays reflecting different developmental stages throughout the life cycle of rice were analysed. OSK genes displayed varied expression patterns with some OSK genes being strongly and widely expressed such as OSK1, OSK8, OSK11, OSK20 and OSK23. However, the majority of OSK genes are expressed in inflorescence parts of the plants (Fig. 3). Meta-analysis of the expression of rice SKP1-like genes. (A) Anatomical analysis of OSK gene expression using the Genevistegator platform (https://www.genevestigator.com/gv/). For a given gene and developmental stage, the level of expression is shown as a percentage of the maximum among all the microarray results found for this gene. The OSK genes display various patterns of expression. Most OSK genes are expressed in the inflorescence parts. (B) Expression profile of OSK genes. The colour scale (representing log signal values) is shown on the y-axis and the cluster tree at the top of the x-axis.

The hierarchical clustering of 20 OSK genes based on their average log2 signal values in the 871 experiments revealed 3 different clusters. One cluster contained widely and strongly expressed genes including OSK1, OSK8, OSK20 and OSK24, a second cluster contained moderately expressed genes and the third cluster contained weakly expressed genes (Fig. 3; Supplementary Table S2). Overall, the expression data indicated that OSK1 is the most widely and strongly expressed rice SKP1 gene.3.3. Yeast two-hybrid interaction between OSKs, F-box proteins and western blotsAn experiment was designed to test interactions between 30 rice OSK and 9 F-box proteins. For each OSK-F-box pair, the interaction was tested in both directions, resulting in a total of 540 binary interactions.Prior to the actual interaction tests, each protein was examined individually for transactivation (activation of reporter gene transcription), and we observed transactivation for OSK4, OSK7, OSK12, OSK15 and OSK31 in yeast when fused to the Gal4 BD domain (i.e. the pDEST™32 expression vector). No transactivation was seen with these proteins when they were fused to the AD domain (i.e. the pDEST™22 expression vector).Of the 30 OSK proteins examined, 8 were shown to interact with at least 1 F-box protein in yeast (Table 1). Some OSK proteins interacted preferentially with certain subfamilies of F-box proteins. For example, OSK4, OSK12 and OSK16 interacted with an F-box protein (02g0260200) belonging to the FBX subfamily, but did not interact with members of the other groups (Fig. 4). In the case of OSK5, OSK6, OSK9 and OSK30, the expression was very low and below the detectable level by protein blotting and hence it was indicated as ‘not determined’ for combinations involving these proteins (Table 1). On the other hand, the same F-box protein (02g0260200) interacted with other members of the OSK family such as OSK1, OSK15 and OSK20. It appears, therefore, that the majority of interactions were observed with the FBX group (Fig. 4). In contrast, the FBL2 (Os05g0425700) F-box member interacted with only two OSK proteins: OSK1 and OSK20. On the other hand, OSK1 and OSK20 were found to interact with all the F-box proteins tested and belonging to three different subfamilies: FBX, FBL and FBK (Fig. 4). In addition, the F-box protein Gibberellin-insensitive dwarf2 (GID2) , which is essential for GA-mediated DELLA protein degradation, interacted with OSK1, OSK13, OSK20 and OSK25 (Table 1; Fig. 4).

Bold (+) indicates that interaction was detected in only one combination. ND, not determined.Interactions of eight rice OSK proteins with representative F-box proteins were determined using yeast two-hybrid analysis. To generate prey (AD-fusion) and bait (BD-fusion) constructs, we fused full-length OSK and F-box proteins with the GAL4 activation domain and GAL4 DNA binding-domain, respectively. The constructs were tested with both combinations. Positive AD-X and DB-X interacting clones were examined for self-activation. Each co-transformation was plated onto a nutritionally selective plate. X-gal assays was used. Strong interacting clones and weak interacting clones produced a dark blue and a light blue colour, respectively, whereas non-interacting clones remained white. We observed self-activation for OSK4, OSK12 and OSK15 in bait (BD-fusion) constructs. Most interactions were observed with the FBX (02g0260200) F-box protein with both combinations.Interactions of eight rice OSK proteins with representative F-box proteins were determined using yeast two-hybrid analysis.

To verify that the negative interactions were not merely due to a lack of protein production by the yeast, we examined the expression of OSK and F-box proteins fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain in yeast by western blotting with the Gal4 monoclonal antibody. We observed the expression of fusion proteins in 26 OSK (Fig. 5). However, no fusion proteins for OSK5, OSK6, OSK9 or OSK30 were detected. For all F-box fusion proteins, the presence of a fusion protein in yeast cells was confirmed by western blotting (Fig. 5). Therefore, we considered that the negative interactions observed with some of the OSK and F-box proteins reflected the genuine behaviour of these proteins in Y2H, rather than a technical artefact due to the absence of interactors.

Immunoblot analysis of OSK and F-box proteins fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain. We observed the expression of fusion proteins for 26 OSK and all the F-box proteins tested.4. DiscussionComprehensive analyses of the SKP1 protein family in C. elegans demonstrated that the 21 SKP1-related genes displayed various interaction capabilities with different F-box proteins, with SKR1 being the most prone to interact in vitro.16 In plants, similar comprehensive analyses performed to date have only concerned the model plant A. thaliana.8,13,18 In contrast, although it is clear that all sequenced plant genomes contain several SKP1-like genes, no systematic analysis of their binding capabilities has been performed so far. We, therefore, decided to carry out a comprehensive study in rice, a monocot model.4.1. OSK1 and OSK20 belong to a class of SKP1 genes that contain one intron in a conserved positionPhylogenetic studies have suggested that all Arabidopsis and rice SKP1 genes derived from a single ancestral gene.14 This hypothesis was supported by the findings of Kong et al.17 who further suggested that SKP1 genes could be classified as either type Ia, with one intron and two exons, type Ib that are intronless and type II that contain several introns. They suggested that type Ib could have derived from type Ia by retroposition. Their study also stated that the position of the single intron could vary between SKP1 genes, but some of them have a conserved position. Interestingly, Kong et al.17 showed that ASK and OSK genes with a conserved intron occupy basal positions in phylogenetic trees, whereas intronless genes often form terminal clades. To extend their study, we examined the genomic organization of SKP1 genes in the moss P. patens and in 16 monocot and eudicot genomes and defined 4 subclasses of SKP1 genes, among which 1 subclass corresponds to SKP1 genes with 1 intron at a conserved position and contains the rice OSK1 and OSK20, suggesting orthology relationships between these genes. By means of a detailed analysis of certain animal, insect and plant genomes, Henricson et al. suggested that genuine orthologous genes tend to have more conserved intron positions than non-orthologous genes.29 In contrast, the majority (140/288) of the plant SKP1 genes were intronless, suggesting an active retroposition phenomenon.4.2. OSK1 and OSK20 belong to a subclass of highly expressed SKP1 genesOur EST survey indicated that OSK1 and OSK20 are the most widely represented genes in public EST databases, (Supplementary Table S6). These results agreed with Kong et al.'s general finding that animal and plant members of this gene family are not uniformly represented by ESTs in the databases, indicating varied degrees of expression.14 In particular, they showed that 63 (96.9%) of the 65 significantly slowly evolving members have ESTs, whereas 89 (93.7%) of the 95 moderately and rapidly evolving members of animals and plant species did not have ESTs.14 During the present study, our comprehensive comparison of the large collection of microarray data in rice (i.e. Genevestigator platform23) clearly indicated that rice SKP1 genes exhibited an expression profile that was heterogeneous in terms of tissues, conditions and overall intensity. This was in complete agreement with the reports by Takahashi et al. and Kong et al. in Arabidopsis.14,18 Moreover, in all species, where sufficiently large and accessible data were available (A. thaliana, rice and P.patens), SKP1-like genes containing single conserved intron (ASK1 and ASK2 in A. thaliana, OSK1 and OSK20 in rice; PP00028G00760, PP00007G01690 and PP00009G01570 in P. patens) exhibited broad and strong levels of expression when compared with the other SKP1-like genes, suggesting their involvement in various physiological processes, even though other members of the SKP1 gene family (intronless or containing non-conserved introns) could also be strongly expressed under some conditions.4.3. Yeast two-hybrid analysis: OSK proteins interact specifically with F-box proteinsThe yeast two-hybrid matrix method involved a subset of 9 F-box and 30 OSK proteins and uncovered selective and distinctive interactions between the OSK proteins. This result strongly suggests that a combination of OSK proteins with F-box proteins produces diverse substrate selectivity. This has already been shown in many studies.8,16,18 It was pointed out that in C.s elegans, SKP1 proteins (SKR) displayed diverse patterns of interaction with F-box proteins.16 In A. thaliana, some ASK proteins (e.g. ASK1, ASK2, ASK11 and ASK12) were able to interact with a broad spectrum of F-box proteins, whereas others only interacted with a few types of proteins.8,13,18 However, some ASK proteins cannot interact with any F-box proteins.18 Likewise, here, we detected no interaction between 22 of the OSK proteins and F-box proteins tested, which could indicate that these interactions may require additional partners and/or the Y2H technique is not appropriate for the detection of interactions between these proteins. Alternatively, these F-box proteins could be involved in protein complexes other than the SCF, as suggested by Hermand.10 The presence of a large number of F-box proteins in O. sativa implies that a plethora of SCF complexes (which recognize a broad array of substrates) are possible. Yeast two-hybrid analysis showed that several putative F-box proteins interacted with one or more members of the A. thaliana SKP1-like (ASK) family.9 In fact, our study revealed that OSK1 is not the only one partner of GID2. The Gomi studies reported that GID2 preferentially interacted with OsSKP15 (OSK1).30 Our results may, therefore, indicate that GID2 is a component of the SCF complex, not only through its interaction with OSK1 but also through its interaction with other OSK members (OSK13, OSK20 and OSK25). Interestingly, we observed that the majority of interactions were observed with the (Os02g0260200 = LOC_Os02g15950) F-box protein that belongs to the FBX subgroup. This gene is homologous to—and belongs to—the same orthology group as Arabidopsis gene At3g61590 that has been shown to interact with all, but two of the ASK tested.18 This result may suggest conservation in these genes between rice and Arabidopsis at the level of interaction capabilities.4.4. Comparison of key amino acid sequences between Oryza OSK proteins and the human Skp1 proteinApart from some specific interactions, we noted that the majority of the positive interactions observed involved OSK1 or OSK20. In this respect, they resembled Skr1 and Skr2 in C. elegans,16 ASK1 and ASK2 and possibly ASK11 that have been found to be implicated in most positive interactions with F-box proteins in A. thaliana.8,18 It has been suggested that these non-specific interacting SKP1 proteins should be named the ‘master components’ of SCF complexes.8 Kong et al.14 and Risseeuw et al.8 also noted that these proteins shared the majority of the 26 amino acids that have been shown to contact the human SKP2 F-box protein.31,32 In this study, we found that OSK1 and OSK20 shared, respectively, 23 and 24 of the 26 key amino acids with Hs-SKP1 (Supplementary Fig. S1).4.5. ConclusionThe plant SKP1 genes could be split into different subfamilies, among which one contains presumably ancestral members from which the other SKP1-like genes have evolved within each species.17 From a compilation of publicly available data, results from previous studies and the Y2H results described in this study, we can suggest that: (i) typical members of this subclass contain two exons, the first exon being of variable length and the second exon being 174 bp (58 amino acids) long, with one intron in a conserved position, (ii) members of this subclass are widely and strongly expressed throughout the whole plant and (iii) they are able to interact with the majority of F-box proteins and may, therefore, participate in the formation of most of the SCF complexes found in plant cells. Based on these criteria, we suggest that rice OSK1 and OSK20 are likely to be functionally equivalent to Arabidopsis ASK1 and ASK2 genes, and we propose functional orthologues for 15 other plants (Supplementary Table S4).Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by a grant from the Tunisian Ministry of Higher Education and Research for a Doctoral Scholarship concerning the first author.The authors would like to thank Monique Sibaud for her technical assistance, Dominique Marcon for images of the Y2H interactions and Nelly Lajoinie for growing the plants.

IntroductionThe cultivated strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa) is one of the most popular and globally consumed fruit crops. It is cultivated in various regions throughout the world; in 2010, 39% of the cultivated strawberry crop was produced in North and South America, followed by Europe (33%), Asia (18%), and Africa (9%).1 Because of the economic importance of this species, breeding programmes of cultivated strawberry are underway in many countries. To date, more than 3000 varieties bred in 41 countries have been registered in the International Union for the Protection and New Varieties of Plants variety database.2 However, despite intensive use of F. × ananassa in the industry, the progress of genetic and genomic research of this crop has lagged behind that of many other economically important plant species, because of its complex genome structure.Fragaria × ananassa is an octoploid (2n = 8x = 56) species that originated from a natural hybridization between Fragaria virginiana and Fragaria chiloensis.3 The genome composition of F. × ananassa was initially proposed as AABBBBCC4 or AAA'A'BBBB,5 based on results of cytological studies. Later, Bringhurst6 proposed the AAA'A'BBB'B' model in light of cytological and genetic evidence. Unlike the first two models, the last model suggests disomic inheritance in entire chromosomes. Although the genome composition of F. × ananassa has not yet been confirmed, the AAA'A'BBB'B' model has been supported by recent molecular genetic studies.7–11 The genus Fragaria belongs to the Rosaceae family. Unlike other genera in the Rosaceae family, Fragaria comprises a limited number of species (approximately 22).12 Several species have been nominated as candidate diploid ancestors such as Fragaria vesca, Fragaria iinumae, and Fragaria daltoniana.13,14 Of these candidates, F. vesca is considered to be the most likely diploid ancestor, and it serves as a model species of F. × ananassa.14 Therefore, genomic and genetic studies in F. vesca have been performed prior to those of F. × ananassa.In molecular genetics studies, several types of F. vesca sequence-derived DNA markers, such as simple sequence repeat (SSR) and sequence-characterized amplified region (SCAR) markers, have been developed since 200315–19 (in this article, ‘DNA marker’ is defined as ‘unique DNA sequence(s) identified by specific primers’). Linkage maps were then constructed with a population derived from an interspecific cross between F. vesca and Fragaria nubicola.20–23 In genomic studies, bacterial artificial chromosome and fosmid libraries were constructed to investigate features of genome sequences of F. vesca.24,25 Subsequently, a whole genome sequence for F. vesca was published in 2011, and the results have greatly contributed to advances in genomic and genetic analysis of the genus Fragaria.26 In parallel, comparative genomics studies within the Rosaceae family have also been performed. Cabrera et al.27 developed a total of 1039 Rosaceae-conserved orthologous set (RosCOS) markers. Primer pairs of the RosCOS markers were designed on intron-flanking regions of orthologous genes commonly conserved among the genera Malus, Fragaria, and Prunus and mapped onto a Prunus reference linkage map. After the genome sequence in F. vesca was published,26 whole genome comparisons between Fragaria, Prunus, and Malus were performed, and major orthologous regions were identified across the genus.28In F. × ananassa, the first linkage map was constructed with 235 or 285 amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers on 28 or 30 linkage groups (LGs) based on a 2-way pseudo-testcross strategy.29 Several linkage maps were subsequently constructed with AFLP, SCAR, sequence-tagged site, random amplified polymorphic DNA, and SSR markers.8–11,30 All the previously published linkage maps were generated based on single F1 mapping populations, and integrated linkage maps were developed in each mapping population in all four studies.8,10,11,30 Of the previously developed linkage maps, the densest map was constructed by Sargent et al.10; a total of 549 loci were mapped onto 28 LGs, with a total length of 2140.3 cM. The density of the map was greatly enhanced over previous maps, but several unsaturated LGs were still observed such as the unintegrated LG pair of FG2DA and FG2DB and LG6B that contained large gaps (36.7 cM). These results suggest the need to develop a denser linkage map in F. × ananassa to reveal the complex genome structure of this species.In this study, we performed SSR marker development and constructed an integrated high density linkage map to accelerate the advancement of genomic and genetic studies in F. × ananassa. Three types of SSR markers were developed, namely F. vesca expressed sequence tag (EST)-derived SSR markers (FVES markers), F. × ananassa EST-derived SSR markers (FAES markers), and F. × ananassa transcriptome-derived SSR markers (FATS markers), using public genome sequence data. The markers were mapped onto five parent-specific linkage maps, along with previously published DNA markers, and the five parent-specific maps were then integrated into one map. The applicability of the integrated map and the markers developed in this study were also demonstrated by comparative analysis of F. × ananassa and F. vesca and by variety distinction on 129 F. × ananassa lines with selected markers. The markers and integrated linkage map described in this study are valuable resources for future studies that will help to elucidate the genome structure and evolutionary process in F. × ananassa and whole genome sequencing, genetic mapping, and molecular breeding of this species.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materialAn integrated linkage map was constructed using three mapping populations originating from a total of five parental lines. ‘02–19’ × ‘Sachinoka’ is an F1 mapping population of 188 individuals derived from a one-way pseudo-testcross. The female parent ‘02–19’ is a breeding line developed in Chiba Prefectural Agriculture and Forestry Research Center, which is resistant to powdery mildew and Fusarium wilt. The male parent ‘Sachinoka’ is a Japanese variety bred in the National Agricultural Research Center for Kyusyu and Okinawa Region, which was derived from a cross between ‘Toyonoka’ and ‘Aiberry’. ‘Kaorino’ × ‘Akihime’ consisted of 140 F1 individuals derived from a one-way pseudo-testcross between the parental lines. ‘Kaorino’ and ‘Akihime’ were bred in Mie Prefecture Agricultural Research Institute and by Mr Kazuhiro Ogiwara in Japan, respectively. One of the ancestor lines of ‘Kaorino’ is ‘Akihime’. ‘Kaorino’ exhibits crown rot resistance, whereas ‘Akihime’ is susceptible to the disease. The ‘0212921’ mapping population consisted of 169 S1 individuals of ‘0212921’. ‘0212921’ was generated from a cross between two breeding lines developed in Mie Prefecture Agricultural Research Institute, and the male parent of ‘0212921’ was identical to the female parent of ‘Kaorino’.2.2. Development of EST-derived SSR markersSSR regions were identified from the F. vesca and F. × ananassa ESTs registered in public databases, namely NCBI's nucleotide database (http://www.ncbi.nih.gov). The numbers of ESTs that were investigated include 45 739 and 6117 in F. vesca and F. × ananassa, respectively. SSRs longer than 14 bases, which contained all possible combinations of dinucleotide (NN), trinucleotide (NNN) and tetranucleotide (NNNN) repeats, were identified using the FINDPATTERNS module in the GCG software package (Accelrys Inc., USA). Oligonucleotides for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers were designed based on the flanking regions of the identified SSRs using the Primer3 program31 in such a way that the amplified products ranged from 90 to 300 bp in length. Markers corresponding to previously published SSR markers in the Fragaria spp and RosCOS of markers8,10,15,17–23,27,32–39 were identified based on primer sequences and were excluded from the collection of FVES and FAES markers.2.3. Development of transcriptome-derived SSR markersA total of 1 188 226 F. × ananassa transcript sequence reads registered in NCBI's Sequence Read Achive (SRA, Accession number: SRX16008) were used for identification of the SSR regions. All reads were generated using the Roche 454 sequencing system (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). The MIRA 3.2.0 program was used for assembling non-redundant contigs.40 Methods for identification of SSR regions and primer design were the same as those used for FVES and FAES marker development, except that penta- and hexanucleotide repeats were also identified and used for primer design. After designing the primer sequences, the redundancy between the FVES, FAES, and published markers described in the above section was confirmed. The newly developed markers were designated FATS markers.2.4. Polymorphic analysis of the DNA markersDNA was extracted from the young leaves of plants using a DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen Inc., Germany). DNA quantification and quality checks were performed using an ND1000 NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technologies, DE, USA) and 0.8% agarose gels. In addition to the FVES, FAES, and FATS markers, a total of 1114 primer pairs of previously published SSR markers developed from Fragaria sequences and RosCOS markers were used for polymorphic analysis of the ‘02–19’ × ‘Sachinoka’ mapping population (Supplementary Table S1).8,15,17–21,23,27,32–38 Polymorphic analysis of the other two populations was performed without using published markers. PCR was performed in a 5-µl reaction volume using 0.6 ng of genomic DNA in 1X PCR buffer (Bioline, UK), 3 mM MgCl2, 0.08 U of BIOTAQ DNA polymerase (Bioline, UK), 0.8 mM dNTPs, and 0.4 µM of each primer. A modified touchdown PCR protocol was followed as described by Sato et al.41 The PCR products were separated by 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in tris-borate-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (TBE) buffer according to the standard protocol or with an ABI 3730xl fluorescent fragment analyzer (Applied Biosystems, USA), according to the polymorphic fragment sizes of the PCR amplicons. In the former case, the data were analysed using the Polyans software (http://www.polyans.kazusa.or.jp), whereas in the latter case, polymorphisms were investigated using the GeneMapper software (Applied Biosystems, USA).2.5. Linkage analysisIn this study, it was assumed that F. × ananassa is an allo-octoploid species and that polymorphic loci in entire chromosomes showed disomic inheritance. Therefore, linkage analysis was performed using the methodology employed with diploid and outcrossing species. The segregated data of the two pseudo-testcross mapping populations were categorized into two parent-specific data sets by comparing the sizes of polymorphic bands of the parents and progeny. The segregation data were rescored using the ‘HAP1’ or ‘F2’ population type codes employed in JoinMap analysis.42 ‘HAP1’ codes were used for the four parental lines of the ‘02–19’ × ‘Sachinoka’ and ‘Kaorino’ × ‘Akihime’, whereas ‘F2’ codes were employed for the parents of the S1 population ‘0212921’. As a result, a total of five parent-specific data sets were generated. The segregation data from each parent-specific data set were then classified into multiple LGs using the colour map method43 that employed a comparison of graphical genotypes of the segregation data. During the process of colour mapping, reciprocal genotypes were converted to coupling genotypes. The robustness of the data sets for each LG was then confirmed using the Grouping Module of the JoinMap program, version 4, with a logarithm of odds (LOD) threshold of 10. The homeologous LGs within each parent-specific map were assumed based on corresponding positions on the F. vesca genome, which were predicted by comparative analysis (described below).The locus orders in each parent-specific map were calculated using the Regression Mapping Module of JoinMap. ‘0212921’-specific data were handled as an ‘F2’ population type, whereas other parent-specific data sets were calculated as ‘HAP1’ population types. The following parameters were used for the calculation: Kosambi's mapping function, LOD = 1.0, REC frequency =0.4, goodness of fit jump threshold for removal of loci = 5.0, number of added loci after which a ripple is performed = 1, and third round = yes. Each LG in parent-specific maps was named according to the following rule: numbers after LG (1–7) showed corresponding chromosome numbers of F. vesca predicted by comparative analysis (described below). The capital letters A–D distinguished four LGs in each homeologous group (HG), which corresponded to LGs in an integrated map. The A–D suffixes corresponded to the lengths of the LGs on the integrated map. When multiple LGs were integrated into a single LG of the integrated map, they were numbered using capital letters with underbars (e.g. LG1B_1 and LG1B_2). For unintegrated LGs, X or Y was used as a suffix.For construction of an integrated linkage map, corresponding LGs between the parent-specific maps were assumed by identification of commonly mapped markers on each LG. Prior to integration, genotypes of dominant loci in each parent-specific map were imputed to co-dominant genotypes, according to the flanking genotypes of co-dominant loci. That is, alleles of dominant loci were converted to co-dominant alleles, according to the flanking genotypes of co-dominant loci. Parent-specific locus genotype data sets were then integrated into one dataset in each LG using the Combine Groups for Mapping Integration Module, followed by locus ordering by the Regression Mapping Module of JoinMap. The parameters used for the mapping module of an integrated map were the same as those used for parent-specific mapping. After construction of an integrated map, the mapped loci were classified into two groups, i.e. loci generated from single-locus diagnostic (SLD) and multi-loci diagnostic (MLD) markers. SLD markers were defined as markers that detected single segregation bands mapped onto single positions on an integrated map, and not amplified other loci, such as monomorphic loci, whereas MLD markers were defined as markers that amplified more than one locus, including monomorphic loci.2.6. Comparative mappingSyntenic regions between the genomes of F. × ananassa and F. vesca were detected by identifying the conservation of the relative locations of genes and genomic regions. The source of the genome sequences of F. vesca was obtained from NCBI [Accession numbers: CM001053.1-CM001059.1 (LG1-7), GG775183.1- GG775301.1 (unplaced)]. The EST sequences adjacent to the mapped markers on the integrated F. × ananassa map were compared with the gene sequences in the reference genomes using the BLASTX program with a cutoff E-value = 1e-10. The syntenic regions defined by the top hits of the homology search were plotted using the Cicros program (http://circos.ca).2.7. Distinguishing the varieties of 129 F. × ananassa lines using selected EST-SSR markerswhere Pip and Pia are the frequency of presence and absence of the ith peak. In F. × ananassa, SSR markers often identify multi loci due to polyploidy, and it is often difficult to investigate the exact number of loci identified in each marker in an unrelated population. Therefore, the mean HZ value of identified peaks generated by a marker was substituted for the HZ of each marker. The allelic binary data were also analysed using GGT 2.045 for the investigation of genetic similarity between the varieties using a Jaccard similarity coefficient. A unweighted pair group method (UPGMA) with arithmetic average dendrogram was constructed using MEGA version 5.05.463. Results3.1. Development of EST-SSR markersA total of 2748 and 324 SSRs were identified in non-redundant 15 203 F. vesca and 1029 F. × ananassa ESTs, respectively. Of the identified SSRs, 562 primers were designed based on the flanking regions of 453 F. vesca- and 109 F. × ananassa-derived EST-SSRs and designated FVES and FAES markers. To increase the number of EST-SSR markers, additional primer pairs were designed that allowed either single-base mismatches (779 and 107 primer pairs for FVES and FAES markers, respectively) or two-base mismatches (2514 and 387 primer pairs for FVES and FAES markers, respectively) in the SSR regions. Of the markers that were generated, those corresponding to previously published markers were excluded.8,10,15,17–23,27,32–39 As a result, a total of 3746 FVES and 603 FAES markers were developed. Design details of the FVES and FAES markers, including primer sequences, corresponding SSR motifs, expected product sizes, and GenBank IDs of the template EST sequences, are listed in Supplementary Tables S3 and S4 and on the web at http://marker.kazusa.or.jp/strawberry/.Of the FVES and FAES markers that were developed, 2975 (79.4%) and 431 (71.5%) were trinucleotide repeats while 456 (12.2%) and 117 (19.4%) were dinucleotide repeats, and 315 (8.4%) and 55 (9.1%) were tetranucleotide repeats, respectively (Table 1). In the FVES markers, the poly (AAG)n motif was most abundant in the trinucleotide repeats (755 SSRs, 20.1%), followed by poly (GGA)n (492 SSRs, 13.1%), poly (ATC)n (352 SSRs, 9.4%), poly (AG)n (347 SSRs, 9.3%), and poly (AGC)n (321 SSRs, 8.6%). Like the FVES markers, the poly (AAG)n motif was the most frequently observed motif in the FAES markers (132 SSRs, 21.9%). This was followed by poly (AG)n (81 SSRs, 13.4%), poly (ATC)n (68 SSRs, 11.3%), and poly (AGC)n (48 SSRs, 8.0%). Among the tetranucleotide repeats, AT-rich motifs, namely poly (AAAG)n, and poly (AAAC)n, were more frequently observed than other motifs in both the FVES and FAES markers. Numbers of SSR motifs in the FVES, FAES, and FATS markersaThe numbers of types of observed ‘other’ SSR motifs in di- and trinucleotide repeats and all penta- and hexa- nucleotide repeats were 4, 24, 6, and 37, respectively.Numbers of SSR motifs in the FVES, FAES, and FATS markersaThe numbers of types of observed ‘other’ SSR motifs in di- and trinucleotide repeats and all penta- and hexa- nucleotide repeats were 4, 24, 6, and 37, respectively.3.2. Development of transcriptome-SSR markersA total of 1 188 226 SRA sequences were assembled into 80 430 contigs by the MIRA 3.2.0 program.38 On these contigs, 34 993 SSRs were identified. Primers that targeted the flanking regions of 129 of the 34 993 SSRs were designed and synthesized. All the 129 SSRs were located on non-redundant contigs, and a total of 125 primers, which did not overlap with the FVES, FAES, and previously published markers,,8,10,15,17–23,27,32–39 were designed as FATS markers. The primer sequences of the FATS markers, along with the corresponding SSR motifs, product sizes, primer sequences, and template contigs, are provided on the web at http://marker.kazusa.or.jp/strawberry/ and in Supplementary Table S5. Of the 125 FATS markers, trinucleotide repeats were the most frequently observed (56 SSRs, 44.8%), followed by hexanucleotide repeats (37 SSRs, 29.6%), and dinucleotide repeats (25 SSRs, 20.0%, Table 1). No tetranucleotide repeats were observed, whereas seven pentanucleotide repeats were identified. Of the SSR motifs, the poly (AG)n motif was the most abundant (10 SSRs, 8.0%), followed by poly (TC)n (7 SSRs, 5.6%), and poly (AAG)n (5 SSRs, 4.0%). In the penta- and hexanucleotide repeats, each single SSR was identified for all the observed motifs except poly (GCTGT)n (two SSRs, data not shown).3.3. Construction of parent-specific linkage mapsA total of 4474 primer pairs of SSR markers, including 3746 FVES, 603 FAES, and 125 FATS, were investigated with 8 randomly chosen S1 individuals of the ‘0212921’ mapping population. Polymorphisms were observed on 605 FVES, 135 FAES, and 29 FATS markers, and segregation analysis was performed for 169 S1 individuals with 769 primer pairs. A total of 881 segregation locus genotypes were generated from the 769 primer pairs, and 822 of the 881 loci were mapped onto 34 LGs (Supplementary Tables S6 and S7). The length of each LG ranged from 1.5 cM (LG4B) to 94.5 cM (LG1A), representing a total length of 1508.3 cM. The mean locus density and segregation distortion (P < 0.05) were 1.83 cM locus-1 and 22.4%, respectively, ranging from 0.22 cM locus-1 (LG6D) to 4.26 cM locus-1 (LG2A_2) and from 0.0% (LG4B) to 85.7% (LG5A_1), respectively.Polymorphic analysis was performed with a total of 5588 primer pairs of SSR markers, including 4474 SSR markers developed in this study and 1114 previously published markers (Supplementary Table S1). A total of 1299 markers, i.e. 853 FVES, 131 FAES, 37 FATS, and 278 published markers, showed polymorphisms between the parental lines. By performing segregation analysis of the 188 individuals of the mapping population, 1078 polymorphic loci were generated from 881 of the 1299 primer pairs that were tested. Of the 1078 segregation loci, 260 showed biparental polymorphisms while the other 818 were parent specific. A total of 575 and 556 loci were mapped onto ‘02–19’ and ‘Sachinoka’ specific maps, respectively (Supplementary Tables S6 and S7). In the ‘02–19’ specific map, 32 LGs were constructed on 1668.9 cM, with lengths ranging from 2.0 cM (LG2X) to 129.2 cM (LG1A). The mean locus density and segregation distortion (P < 0.05) were 2.90 cM locus-1 and 30.2%, respectively, ranging from 0.34 cM locus-1 (LG5A_2) to 11.63 cM locus-1 (LG6C) and from 0.0% (LG3B_2, 5A_2 and 7D_2) to 100% (LG2X and 4B), respectively. In the ‘Sachinoka’ map, 34 LGs were developed, totalling 2166.6 cM in length, with a mean locus density of 3.90 cM locus-1. The length and locus density of each LG ranged from 1.6 cM (LG7C_2) to 120.0 cM (LG7A) and from 0.80 cM locus-1 (LG7C_2) to 16.08 cM locus-1 (LG3X), respectively. Segregation distortion (P < 0.05) of each LG ranged from 0.0% (LG7C_2, 7D_1 and 7X) to 85.7% (LG2X), with a mean value of 25.4%.A total of 4474 primer pairs of SSR markers developed in this study were used for polymorphic analysis with the parental lines. Polymorphisms were observed in 438 FVES, 95 FAES, and 33 FATS markers, and segregation analysis was performed with the 140 mapping plants, for a total of 566 primer pairs. A total of 612 segregation locus genotypes were generated from 537 of the 566 primer pairs that were tested. Of the 612 segregation loci, 140 showed biparental polymorphisms while the other 472 were parent specific. A total of 294 and 318 loci were mapped onto ‘Kaorino’ and ‘Akihime’ specific maps, respectively (Supplementary Tables S6 and S7). The ‘Kaorino’ map consisted of 32 LGs, representing a total length of 1103.4 cM. The mean locus density and segregation distortion (P < 0.05) were 3.75 cM locus-1 and 24.8%, respectively, ranging from 0.45 cM locus-1 (LG1B_2) to 7.61 cM locus-1 (LG1A) and from 0.0% (LG1B_2, 1X, 2A, 2D, 4X, 5A_1, 5X, 6A_2, 6A_3 and 7D) to 100% (LG4D_2), respectively. In the ‘Akihime’ map, 33 LGs were developed, with a total length of 951.4 cM and a mean locus density of 2.99 cM locus-1. The length and locus density of each LG ranged from 2.2 cM (LG5X) to 77.7 cM (LG7A) and from 0.55 cM locus-1 (LG5X) to 12.72 cM locus-1 (LG6A_4), respectively. Segregation distortion (P < 0.05) of each LG ranged from 0.0% (LG3X, 4A_2, 4C, 5A, 5C, 5X, 6A_1, 6B_1, 6B_2, and 7D_2) to 100% (LG1A_1), with a 14.8% mean value.3.4. Construction of an integrated linkage mapPrior to integration, the subsets of parent-specific LGs to be integrated were determined by the numbers of commonly mapped markers across parent-specific maps, that is, pairs of LGs showing the largest number of commonly mapped markers were assembled into the same subset. When one LG showed the same numbers of commonly mapped markers in different pairs, the LG was excluded from the integration. Locus genotype data of each subset of LG were integrated using the Combine Groups for Mapping Integration Module in JoinMap, and the locus orders of an integrated map were then calculated. When grouped LG subsets were inadequate, the segregation loci of incorrect LGs were excluded during the process of locus ordering. When a LG subset was misassembled with incorrect pairs of parent-specific LGs, the loci of the mis-integrated LG overlapped with loci onto other integrated LGs which correctly paired LGs were integrated. Therefore, the correct assembly of a LG subset was determined by confirming the number of overlapping loci on each integrated LG using the Mapping module in JoinMap.The integrated linkage map consisted of 1856 loci on 28 LGs, totalling 2364.1 cM in length (Table 2, Supplementary Table S7 and Fig. S1). The length of each LG varied from 34.2 (LG1D) to 123.7 cM (LG1A). The mean locus density was 1.27 cM locus-1, ranging from 0.68 cM locus-1 (LG6B) to 5.08 cM locus-1 (LG4B). The largest gap was 27.3 cM, between FVES1598_7a and FVES1351_7a on LG7A, followed by a 23.4 cM gap between FAES0326_4b and FAES3462_4b on LG4B, and a 21.6 cM gap between FVES0576_4c and FAES0045 on LG4C. The number of integrated LGs ranged from 1 (LG1D) to 16 (LG6A) parent-specific LGs (Table 2). The number of unintegrated parent-specific LGs, which totalled 17, ranged from 1 (‘0212921’) to 5 (‘Akihime’) in each parental map. The ratios of mapped FVES, FAES, and FATS loci were 77.5, 15, and 3.4%, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S2). The ratio of mapped FVES markers in each LG ranged from 62.5 to 93.3%.

Numbers in parentheses show percentage of all the mapped loci.bNumber of integrated LGs.cNumber of integrated loci.Of the mapped loci, 481 (25.9%) were generated from SLD markers, whereas the other 1375 were from MLD markers. The ratio of mapped loci generated from SLD markers in each LG varied from 9.4% (LG4C) to 41.2% (LG3A). These loci were mapped randomly onto many of the LGs while several clusters were observed on parts of LGs (LG1A, 1C, 2C, 4C, 4D, 6C, 6D, 7B, and 7C, Supplementary Fig. S1). Loci generated from MLD markers were classified into four types; multi loci mapped onto homoeologous LGs (Multi_H in Supplementary Table S7), non-homeologous LGs (Multi_NH), the same LGs (Multi_S), and single position (Multi_NM). For the Multi_NM loci, all the observed multiple bands were monomorphic except for mapped ones. Of the four types of multi loci, Multi_H was most frequently observed (684 loci), followed by Multi_NM (523), Multi_S (206), and Multi_NH (77). Of the 684 Multi_H loci, 16 and 99 were observed, corresponding to loci on non-homeologous LGs (Multi_H&NH) and the same LGs (Multi_H&S), respectively. The Multi_H loci were randomly distributed along the entire integrated linkage map, whereas Multi_S loci were not observed on several LGs, i.e. LG2B, 2D, 3C, 4D, 5A, 5B, 7B, and 7C (Supplementary Fig. S1). In each HG, the homeologous regions differed depending on the paired LGs (Supplementary Fig. S3). For example, most homeologous regions of LG2A and LG2C were observed on 20–40 cM while those of LG2B and LG2D were identified on 60–80 cM. In the case of HG1, homeologous regions were not observed between LG1C and LG1D. Such biases of homeologous pairs were identified across the genome.3.5. Comparison with the genomes of a wild relative, F. vescaOf the 3746 ESTs that corresponded to the designed FVES markers, 3743 showed significant similarities to the genome sequences of F. vesca, while 3 ESTs, corresponding to FVES1248, FVES2637, and FVES2807, did not (Supplementary Table S3). Of the 3743 ESTs, 3608 showed similarities to genome sequences placed on 7 chromosomes of F. vesca, and the other 135 were mapped onto unplaced genomic scaffolds. In F. × ananassa sequence-derived markers, significant similarities to the F. vesca genome sequences were observed in all 603 ESTs and 124 of the 125 transcript contigs from which FAES and FATS markers were designed, respectively (Supplementary Table S4 and S5). Of these, 593 and 120 sequences corresponding to FAES and FATS markers, respectively, were mapped onto F. vesca genome sequences placed on the 7 chromosomes, whereas the other 14 ESTs or transcript contigs were mapped onto unplaced scaffolds. Similarity searches were also performed for the previously published markers that were located on the integrated map. Of the 91 mapped previously published markers, 68 ESTs or genome sequence are available on the NCBI dbGSS database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/dbGSS, Supplementary Table S1) from which the markers were designed. Of the 68 sequences, 62 showed significant similarities to the F. vesca genome sequences placed onto the 7 chromosomes.A total of 1354 markers that generated 1783 mapped loci onto the integrated linkage map showed significant similarity with F. vesca genome sequences placed onto the 7 chromosomes. By considering the sequences with highest similarity scores to be putative orthologs, the map locations of the SSR markers and the corresponding F. vesca genome sequences were compared. As shown in Fig. 1, the alignment of homologous sequence pairs along each LG revealed an obvious syntenic relationship between corresponding HGs in F. × ananassa (Fa-HG) and chromosomes (Chr) in F. vesca (Fv-Chr). Most of the regions did not show synteny between non-corresponding Fa-HGs and Fv-Chr, except between Fa-HG3 and 25–30 Mb on Fv-Chr2. In some LGs in F. × ananassa, syntenic regions were observed on whole corresponding chromosomes in F. vesca, whereas segmental syntenic blocks were identified between pairs of the other Fa-LGs and Fv-Chr (Supplementary Fig. S3-1). For example, Fa-LG1A displayed syntenies against entire regions of Fv-Chr1, whereas segmental syntenic blocks were observed between 0 and 11 Mb in Fv-Chr1 and Fa-LG1B or Fa-LG1D, as well as between 8 and 23 Mb in Fv-Chr1 and Fa-LG1C.

Distinguishing the varieties of 129 F. × ananassa lines using selected EST-SSR markersTo select the best marker set to determine the varieties of the F. × ananassa lines, polymorphic analysis of the 22 cultivated strawberry lines was performed using primer pairs targeting 3746 FVES and 603 FAES markers. In the primer pairs of FVES markers, 2949 resulted in solid amplification, whereas of the remaining primer pairs, 431, 263, and 103 resulted in no amplification, multiple bands, and rare bands, respectively (Supplementary Table S3). In the FAES markers, solid amplification was observed for 460 primer pairs, whereas of the remaining primer pairs, 88, 52, and 3 resulted in no amplification, multiple, and rare bands, respectively (Supplementary Table S4). A total of 751 primer pairs, including 650 FVES and 101 FAES, showed solid and polymorphic amplification and were used for the subsequent investigation of PCR, i.e. the stability of PCR and detection of noise peaks, using a fragment analyzer for all 22 lines. A total of 100 of the 751 primer pairs showing high stability and few noise peaks were selected and used for polymorphic analysis with 129 strawberry lines to reconfirm the robustness of PCR in a more diversified collection. From this experiment, the 45 best markers, which showed high stability in PCR and few noise peaks, were selected. PCR was then performed twice more with the 129 strawberry lines to exclude genotyping errors (Supplementary Table S3).The primer pairs of 45 selected SSR markers, including 4 FAES and 41 FVES markers, generated a total of 158 peaks in the 129 strawberry lines that were tested (http://vim.kazusa.or.jp/Strawberry/). The number of identified peaks per a primer pair ranged from two to seven, with a mean value of 3.51 (Supplementary Fig. S4). The HZ value of each identified peak was calculated based on a score of 1 or 0 for the presence and absence of the peak and ranged from 0 to 0.5. The mean HZ value of each marker ranged from 0.11 to 0.43, with an average value of 0.25. Similarity coefficients were used to examine the genetic relationships between the 129 strawberry lines. All possible genotypes showed similarity coefficients ranging from 0.00 to 0.41 (Supplementary Table S2). No genetic differences were identified with the 45 markers between ‘Nyoho’ and ‘Shinnyoho’ or between ‘Himatsuri’ and ‘Toyonoka’. The highest similarity coefficient, 0.41, was found between the UK variety ‘Serenata’ and the Japanese variety ‘Summer berry’.4. DiscussionIn this study, a total of 4474 SSR markers, including 3746 FVES, 603 FAES, and 125 FATS, were designed from public EST and transcript sequences of F. vesca and F. × ananassa. Of the 4474 SSR markers, 672 resulted in rare or no amplification, and the remaining 3802 SSR markers resulted in amplification. To our knowledge, 441 SSR markers have previously been published for the genus Fragaria.8,10,15,17–23,27,32–39 The number of SSR markers that were developed in this study is approximately 8.6 times that of previously published markers. Recent advances in genome sequencing technology have enabled the large-scale development of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in many of plant species. However, SNP discovery and genotyping are still difficult for polyploidy species because of the difficulty in distinguishing between homeologous allelic SNPs. Therefore, SSR markers are currently the most rapid and conclusive marker system for most polyploid species, including F. × ananassa. The numerous SSR markers developed in this study are an important resource for genetic and genomic studies of this species.In this study, linkage analysis was performed using a methodology previously employed in diploid and outcrossing species with the assumption that F. × ananassa is an allo-octoploid species with an AAA'A'BBB'B' genome structure. The large number of mapped loci that showed disomic inheritance supported this assumption.In the ‘02–19’ × ‘Sachinoka’ and ‘Kaorino’ × ‘Akihime’ populations, polymorphic marker screening was only performed with parental lines that caused failure of screening polymorphic markers showing a <ab × ab> segregation pattern. Meanwhile, eight randomly selected S1 individuals were used in polymorphic marker screening of the ‘0212921’ population, and all possible polymorphic markers were selected. Therefore, we considered that the large differences of the number of mapped loci in the parent-specific maps were due to the steps in polymorphic marker screening and the genetic distances of haplotypes within parents. All the previously published maps in F. × ananassa were derived from F1 mapping populations, and the ‘0212921’ specific map is the first parent-specific map derived from an S1 population. The density of the parent-specific map ‘0212921’ suggests that an S1 population is available for linkage map construction in F. × ananassa.According to a previous study10 and the integrated map developed in this study, the length of a saturated linkage map in F. × ananassa would exceed 2000 cM. The lengths of all the parent-specific maps were shorter than 2000 cM, except the ‘Sachinoka’ map that was 2166.6 cM. In addition, no parent-specific map had 28 LGs, i.e. the number of chromosomes in the haploid genome of F. × ananassa. Therefore, it was concluded that all parental specific maps were unsaturated.The integrated linkage map comprises 1856 loci on 28 LGs. The total length of the map, 2364 cM, is slightly longer than the previously reported densest map, 2140 cM, by Sargent et al.10 The mean locus density of our integrated map was 1.27 cM locus-1, which was three times denser than that of the map of Sargent et al. Moreover, the integrated map presented in this study is the first linkage map derived from multiple mapping populations of F. × ananassa, suggesting that the map reflects wider genetic diversity in the species. Several LGs of the integrated map seemed to be saturated, whereas some of others were not, such as LG1D, LG4B, LG5C, LG5D, LG7B, and LG7C. In addition, the parent-specific LGs were not evenly merged into the LGs in the integrated map. For example, LG6A in the integrated map consists of 16 parent-specific LGs, whereas LG1D was derived from a single parent-specific LG of the ‘0212921’-specific map. One of the causes for the uneven positions of the mapped loci and the number of merged parent-specific LGs may be the bias of heterozygous (polymorphic) genomic regions within each parental line. Moreover, the source of EST-SSR markers might affect the evenness of the mapping. Of the mapped loci on the integrated map, 82% were derived from F. vesca sequences, whereas 14 and 4% markers were generated from F. × ananassa and other species, respectively. Previous molecular and cytogenetic studies suggested that F. vesca and F. iinumae or F. daltoniana were candidate ancestral species of F. × ananassa.13,14 This theory suggests that partial genome regions in F. × ananassa were derived from F. iinumae or F. daltoniana and may show non-homology with the genomes of F. vesca. In addition, the ratio of mapped FVES loci ranged from 62.5 to 93.3% (Supplementary Fig. S2). The large contribution of F. vesca sequence-derived SSR markers on the integrated map may affect the biased position of the mapped loci.Although a total of 107 loci derived from previously published markers were mapped onto the integrated linkage map, we did not employ the corresponding names used in previously published maps. This was due to the insufficient number of commonly mapped markers across linkage maps, along with the large number of mapped multi loci. In this study, ‘A’ to ‘D’ suffixes were added to the LG names, which corresponded to the lengths of the LGs; A was used for the longest LG, whereas D was added to the shortest. Therefore, there are no biological relationships among the LGs designated with the same capital letter suffix. We request the replacing of the capital letters as to represent the genome structure in F. × ananassa, for example AAA'A'BBB'B', after corresponding LGs to each genome, will be identified in future.Loci generated from SLD markers should play an important role in the identification of specific LGs and chromosomes in F. × ananassa. In this study, we mapped both SLD and MLD markers, and 25.9% (481) of the mapped loci were derived from SLD markers. Indeed, the karyotypes of octoploid Fragaria species were already reported in F. chiloensis and F. virginiana,47 as well as in F. × ananassa.48 Using genomic region mapped single loci as probes for cytological analysis such as fluorescence in situ hybridization, corresponding karyotypes of F. × ananassa could be identified on each LG in the integrated map. In addition, the genome structure of F. × ananassa could be resolved by comparative mapping with candidate ancestral Fragaria species using markers detecting single loci.While 25.9% of the mapped loci were generated from SLD markers, the remaining 74.1% (1375) were derived from MLD markers, comprising 569 Multi_H, 16 Multi_H&NH, 99 Multi H&S, 61 Multi_NH, 107 Multi_S, and 523 Multi_NM. The ratio of all Multi_H (including Multi_H&NS and H&S) to the sum of mapped loci (except Multi_NM) was 0.51 [(569 + 16 + 99)/(1856–523)]; that is approximately half of the mapped loci on the integrated map were Multi_H. The Multi_H loci were mapped along the entire genomes. However, corresponding homeologous positions differed depending on the paired LGs. The uneven homeologous regions between each pair of LGs might represent a feature of the genome composition of F. × ananassa.Comparative mapping studies between F. × ananassa and F. vesca have been reported.8–11 According to previous results, most of the genomic regions are conserved between the two species, with the rare exception of chromosome rearrangement on HG1, HG3, and HG6. Results from our comparative mapping study generally agreed with those of previous studies, i.e. the identification of clear macrosynteny over both entire genomes. However, our results suggest that partial rearrangement occurred more frequently between homeologous genomes in F. × ananassa and F. vesca than previously reported. In addition, genomic rearrangement across HGs was first observed in this study, i.e. between Fv-Chr2 and Fa-HG3 (Fig. 1). Of the LGs belonging to HG3, LG3A, 3B and 3C showed the genomic rearrangement, whereas it was not observed on LG3D.The varieties of 129 F. × ananassa lines were distinguished to demonstrate the practicable utility of the markers developed in this study. Ninety-one percent (118 of 129) of the tested lines were developed in Japan. Because most Japanese lines were developed from a limited number of ancestral lines, such as ‘Haward17’ and ‘General Chanzy’, genetic diversity is considered to be generally narrow in Japanese germplasm.49 Despite the expected narrow genetic diversity, the 45 SSR markers employed in this study identified most of the tested lines except for 2 pairs, ‘Nyoho’ and ‘Shin-Nyoho’ and ‘Toyonoka’ and ‘Himatsuri’. ‘Shin-Nyoho’ and ‘Himatsuri’ were developed from mutation lines of ‘Toyonika’ and ‘Nyoho’, respectively. Therefore, it was assumed that the genetic diversities were quite narrow in each pair of undistinguished varieties. Meanwhile, it is notable that the ‘Anter’, ‘Pihyaradondon’, and ‘Nyoho’ lines and the ‘Akita Berry’ and ‘Morioka 16’ lines could be distinguished from each other, although the former two and one of the varieties are mutant lines of ‘Nyoho’ and ‘Morioka 16’, respectively.Variety identification is one of the major practical uses of DNA markers. Such identification should protect breeders' rights and inhibit the contamination of clonal seedlings during propagation. Because unknown samples are often used in variety identification, the accurate detection of targeted peaks is essential. In addition, it is well known that PCR results can vary depending on experimental conditions such as the type of thermal cycler and Taq polymerase employed during PCR analysis. In a previous study, Kunihisa44 investigated the stability of polymorphic analysis of CAPS markers by comparing the results obtained in 14 laboratories to verify the adequacy of the makers used for variety identification tests in F. × ananassa. Govan et al.50 also screened 32 SSRs that produced reliable PCR results for the identification of 60 varieties. In the present study, the 45 SSR markers were carefully screened by confirming the results of 3 independent PCRs. The 36 out of the 45 markers were mapped onto a total of 20 LGs of the integrated map. It suggested that the polymorphisms of selected markers roughly reflect genetic diversity in entire genome. Therefore, the markers were found to be reliable for variety identification.In this study, we developed large numbers of SSR markers and constructed the densest linkage map for F. × ananassa. By performing comparative mapping and variety distinction, the resources that we developed were shown to be useful for genetic and genomic analysis as well as practical applications. Our results should contribute to the acceleration of advances in the study of F. × ananassa, along with the genus Fragaria.Supplementary DataSupplementary Data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by the Kazusa DNA Research Institute Foundation, research and development projects for application in promoting new policies of agriculture, forestry and fisheries (21010) funded by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries.We thank Dr Satoru Matsumoto at the National Agriculture and Food Research Organization, Institute of Fruit Tree Science, Dr Toshi Nishimoto at Nara Prefectural Agriculture Research Center, and Toshihiro Tanaka at Wakayama Research Center of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, for providing F. × ananassa DNA or plant material.Supplementary data"

IntroductionOlea europaea L. is one of the most important and widespread fruit trees in the Mediterranean basin, with 95% of the 750 million olive trees cultivated worldwide, being Spain and Italy the main growers.1,2 Olive, one of the first plants to be cultivated for oil production, is the second most important oil fruit crop cultivated worldwide, with over 8 million hectares of land devoted to its cultivation.3 Most olive production is destined for olive oil, ranking sixth of all vegetable oils produced worldwide.4 Virgin olive oil is a natural fruit juice with no additives or preservatives and a unique flavour, increasingly demanded for its potential health benefits, exceptional nutritional properties, and exceptional organoleptic properties. These characteristics, and a high oxidative stability, are all due to a well-balanced fatty acid composition and the presence of minor components such as natural antioxidants and vitamins.Olive is a diploid (2n = 46), predominantly allogamous, vegetatively propagated species, with an estimated genome size of 2200 Mb5–7 and a higher tolerance to drought and salt stresses than other fruit trees.8 As many woody plants, olive requires several growth seasons from seed germination to first flowering (juvenile phase). This long juvenile phase had severely hampered the generation of new breeding cultivars that could replace ancient ones still under cultivation.9 Therefore, new cultivars adapted to the new trends in olive growing, i.e. shorter juvenile periods,10 tree architecture suitable for hedgerow orchards and mechanical harvesting,11 or increased oil content and organoleptic profiles tailored to different markets,12 are needed.11Understanding the complex molecular basis of fruit and oil quality and that of traits of agronomical importance can be greatly helped by the application of genomic tools. Furthermore, development of new molecular markers to assist selection in breeding programmes looking for cultivars with more desirable phenotypes for any of these traits can be greatly helped through the generation and application of genomic tools. However, despite its economical relevance, the generation of sequence information and genomic tools for either olive or any closely related species has only just started.13–16 Genomic information in olive is well behind other species of woody plants, such as Vitis vinifera17,18 and Populus trichocarpa,19 whose complete genome sequences are already available, although the first sequences for these species became available around the same time, or even later, than those from olive.20 Without a genome sequence, transcriptome sequencing is an effective approach for gene discovery and identification of transcripts involved in specific biological processes (BP).In this study, we report the largest contribution to date to sequence information in this important crop species, with close to 2 M reads generated through the combined use of Sanger sequencing and 454 pyrosequencing technologies, for the identification of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from different plant tissues and developmental stages. The assembly of the 2 M reads has rendered over 81 020 unigenes, and we present here the result of this assembly and its functional annotation.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant material for the generation of cDNA libraries and collectionsFour cDNA libraries were generated for Sanger sequencing (Table 1). To generate a mesocarp cDNA library (OLmeso), fruit mesocarp was collected from fruits of Lechin de Sevilla, harvested at three relevant stages of maturation: green with lignified endocarp (18 WAF), turning (27 WAF), and purple (34 WAF). For the bud cDNA library (OLmer), buds containing actively growing meristems harvested from juvenile low branches and adult high branches of 10 segregating seedlings from a Picual × Arbequina cross of the UCO-IFAPA Olive Breeding Program of Córdoba, Spain, were taken by mid April 2008. Roots from a single adult tree of Lechin de Sevilla and 10 different 2-month-old trees from the segregating progeny of the Picual × Arbequina cross were also harvested to generate a root cDNA library (OLroot). Young leaves and stems of Lechin de Sevilla were collected and used together with seeds from olive fruits of the Picual × Arbequina progeny at two different maturation stages: green with lignified endocarp (18 WAF) and turning (27 WAF) to generate OLrest. The tissues used to generate the eight cDNA collections used for pyrosequencing are detailed in Table 1. Description of the olive cDNA libraries and collections generated in this workDescription of the olive cDNA libraries and collections generated in this work2.2. RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, and generation of cDNA librariesTotal RNA was purified from mesocarp samples following previously described methods21,22 that allow elimination of phenolic compounds and using the TURBO DNA-free kit (Ambion, USA) to remove genomic DNA. Oligotex (Qiagen) was used to obtain mRNA from total RNA to guarantee RNA integrity when mesocarp samples were to be used to generate cDNA libraries. Total RNA extraction from juvenile and adult roots, young leaves and stems, and from seeds of green and turning fruits were carried out using Spectrum Total RNA Kit (Sigma-Aldrich, Spain) after tissue processing with an electric homogenizer. Total RNA from buds was purified using a Trizol-based method (Life Technologies)23 and treated twice with DNase.24 In all cases, RNA concentration was quantified using a spectrophotometer at OD 260 nm, and integrity checked by electrophoresis in agarose gels.For the generation of the four cDNA libraries for Sanger sequencing, and prior to cDNA synthesis, equal amounts of RNA from mesocarp from the different stages of maturation (OLmeso), equal amounts of RNA from juvenile and adult roots (OLroot), or buds (OLmer), and equal amounts of young leaves and stems, seeds from green and turning fruits (OLrest) were pooled together. Synthesis of cDNA was carried out using the SMART kit (DB Clontech, USA),25 and normalized using the DSN nuclease (TRIMMER-Direct cDNA Normalization Kit from Evrogen, JSC, Russia).26,27 To confirm that the normalization process was correct, an aliquot was visualized by gel electrophoresis, and the presence of olive genes of known expression was confirmed for some of the tissues by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). cDNA insert preparation was treated with Proteinase K, cleaned, and digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes. cDNA was size fractionated by ChromaSpin-400 columns, ligated into the pDNR-LIB,28 (OLroot and OLrest libraries), pAL17.129 (OLmeso library), or pSTBlue-1 (Novagen, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) (OLmer library) vectors, previously dephosphorylated, and transformed into Escherichia coli. Libraries were titred and tested by randomly picking and amplifying a small number of clones using universal primers. The sizes of the PCR products ranged between 0.5 and 2 Kb.When generating cDNA collections for pyrosequencing, the first strand cDNA synthesis was performed using the ‘RevertAid H Minus First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit’ (Fermentas), and, the second strand cDNA was synthesized using E. coli DNA polymerase I and RNase H (Fermentas).2.3. Sanger and 454 sequencingcDNA libraries were automatically sequenced from the 5' end using either the T7 primer (OLmeso and OLmer) or the pDNRlib30-50 primer (OLroot and OLrest), and FASTA files were generated for bioinformatic processing. cDNA collections for pyrosequencing were sheared via nebulization into small fragments and sequenced using GS-FLX (MAP, MIP, MIA, and MAA) or GS-FLX Titanium (SGAP, MGP, MTA, and MTP) (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Half of a picotiter plate was used for cDNA collections: MAP, MIP, MIA, and MAA, with single libraries being sequenced in separated areas of the plate, whereas a full plate was used for SGAP, MGP, MTA, and MTP. An initial quality filtering was carried out before the actual base calling, where 454 adapter sequences were removed. Transmission, storage, and handling of sequencing data were subsequently done using the standard flowgram format (SFF) files for compactness and easiness of usage. SFF files were created after image analysis using the GSRunProcessor Version 2.3 provided by 454 Roche through Lifesequencing S.L., Spain. Calling qualities and sequence extraction from SFF files were carried out using sfftools Version 2.3 also provided by 454 Roche through Lifesequencing.2.4. EST processing protocolsMost of the EST processing protocols were adapted from those described by Vera and collaborators.30 Based on preliminary data using different computational assembly pipelines, including the 454 GS Assembler software, we chose to assemble the 454 sequence data using SeqMan Pro 8.1.1 (DNASTAR Lasergene v8.0 Suite, DNASTAR, USA). During pre-assembly, sequencing ends were trimmed using a medium-stringency criteria, with the following SeqMan parameters: average quality score Q/n threshold of 12, a non-trace window size of 50, and a maximum of 2 Ns. As part of the preprocessing step, an exhaustive comparison against a prokaryotic database (Uniprot database: taxonomic divisions Bacteria and Archaea) was performed to remove all those sequences that potentially originated from external contamination. For sequences obtained using 454 technology, no scanning for vector sequences was carried out. In the actual assembly step, the assembler used a strategy combining quality weighting (when there was not enough coverage depth) and simple majority (when deeper coverage was present) for contig consensus determination. For large 454 sequencing projects, the software provider recommended a set of pre-assembly and assembly parameters; however, because they were optimized for shorter reads than those obtained in our study, we performed several benchmark assemblies under different sets of parameters (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). When final length and coverage of the contigs were considered adequate, the parameters identified as optimal, which were different from those that were vendor recommended, were used to assemble the data obtained from 454 sequencing. We used a minimum consecutive match size of 25 bases, a minimum match percentage of 70%, and a match spacing of 15-mer tags. We established a minimum length of 70 bases for a sequence to be considered for assembly, no gap penalty and a 0.70 gap length penalty, and a maximum mismatch in end bases of 0. No repeat handling was used. Sanger sequencing data was also assembled using SeqMan Pro 8.1.1, using the default parameters recommended, that thus allowed us to perform joint 454-Sanger assemblies. High stringency quality trimming was used to remove low-quality bases at the ends of the sequences. The parameters for pre-assembly and assembly were similar to those used for 454 cDNA collections, but the match percentage was set to 80%, and a match spacing of 150 was required. A minimum of 100 bases was required for a sequence to be assembled (because of Sanger sequencing technology obtaining longer reads). The maximum mismatch in the end bases was also set to 15 to help mitigate assembly problems, if untrimmed vectors or bad base calls are present at the end of the reads. ESTs screening for vector sequences was carried out as follows in Sanger libraries: OLmeso was screened for pAL17.1, OLmer for pSTBlue-1, and OLrest and OLroot for pDNR-LIB. After the pre-assembly (cleaning and trimming) step, most of the raw reads were considerably reduced in size because of the tendency of the Sanger sequencing technology to incorporate traces of vector sequence and lower quality calls at 3' and 5' ends. The complete assembly of all sequences was carried out using a sequential combination of two different assemblers. Briefly, the initial sequencing dataset was assembled using Newbler 2.6 (Roche Ltd)31 and default parameters for cDNA data (seed step = 12; seed length = 16, seed count = 1, minimum overlap length = 40, and minimum overlap identity = 90%). The resulting dataset of contigs and singletons was used as input for the second assembler, CAP3,32 to collapse all related sequences that could not have done so during the first assembly step. The parameters used to perform the CAP3 assembly were a minimum overlap length of 60 bases and a minimum overlap identity of 90%. Unigenes generated from the assembly were further filtered for a minimum size of 200 nt. Unigenes generated were classified according to the tissues from which they included sequencing reads. The lists of unigenes detected in each of the tissues were compared using the software VENNY, to identify those unigenes expressed in a single or two or more tissues. This software displays the results of these comparisons as Venn diagrams (http://bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/).332.5. Analysis of transcript and transcriptome coverageA mathematical analysis similar to rarefaction analysis and previously applied for similar purposes in pea (Pisum sativum) was used to estimate both transcript and transcriptome coverage.34 A read pool was defined using all reads obtained after the cleaning and trimming process from which reads were randomly drawn to generate sets of reads (datasets) of increasing sizes. The number of tomato genes identified using BLASTX (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool 2.2.18)35 to compare these different datasets against the tomato ‘ITAG2 protein database (http://solgenomics.net)’ (e-value = 10-4) was recorded for each dataset and plotted against the corresponding sample sizes. Data points, thus, obtained were fitted to a non-linear regression with the model y = ax/(b + x) (SigmaPlot Software, Systat Software Inc., Scientific Software Products). Curves are expected to converge against a fixed value parameter ‘a’ in the model function indicating an upper limit for gene detection, which correlated with a decreasing slope at higher sample sizes indicative of a decreasing potential to detect additional tomato genes with further sampling. This approach was also used to record tomato genes with more than 5, 10, and 100 hits to estimate transcript coverage.2.6. Data availabilityThe 454 sequenced read data reported in this manuscript have been deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Sequence Read Archive and are available under the Accession Number (NCBI: SRA059461). The results from the assembly reported in this manuscript have been deposited in the NCBI Transcriptome Shotgun Assembly Archive and are available under the Accession Number (GABQ00000000).2.7. Functional annotationUnigenes generated were functionally annotated based on the similarity with UniProt-annotated sequences, in particular using plants taxonomy. The annotation algorithm used, Sma3s (Pérez-Pulido A.J., Muñoz-Mérida A., Viguera E., Claros M.G., Trelles O., Sma3s: a three-step modular sequence annotator. In preparation), was developed at the University of Malaga and briefly consists on a restrictive BLAST35 search with three steps of significance that sequentially retrieve annotations from: (i) already existing annotated sequences, (ii) orthologous sequences, and (iii) groups of sequences sharing a statistically significant pattern. Sma3s provides the following biological descriptors associated with each sequence: Gene ontology (GO) terms, Swiss-Prot keywords and pathways, InterPro domains, and IntAct interactions (Uniprot, UniProt Knowledgebase Release 2012_04). In the first step, minimal correspondence was established at a 90% of sequence identity with a sequence overlap of at least 90% of the query sequence length. In the second step, the threshold was established at 75% of per-residue identity and length overlapping of more than 75% of their length. Lastly, the third step uses all BLAST alignments related to each query sequence, which are classified as statistically significant by the Sander's formulae.36,37 The curve determined by the formulae binds the relationship between sequence similarity and alignment length observed, in sequences sharing structural similarity. Thus, those entries displaying identity length coordinates over the curve correspond to statistically significant hits. This analysis is necessary to distinguish true from false positives, when the level of sequence identity is not sufficiently high to unambiguously distinguish between protein pairs of similar and non-similar structures. The annotations resulting from these hits were reported by the algorithm.The annotation generated by sma3s was loaded as a tab-separated file in the Blast2GO suite,38 to retrieve the GO structure of our data. A directed acyclic graph (DAG)38 was made with a >2 unigenes per GO term as a cutoff to overcome the computing limitations encountered as a result of the large size of our dataset. Statistics of our annotation dataset were saved into a Microsoft Excel datasheet, and charts were generated. Statistical analysis of GO terms enrichment was carried out using the Blast2GO suite38 to perform a two-tailed Fisher's exact test,39 a non-parametric test for independence that calculates the false discovery rate (FDR) following the method described by Benjamini and Hochberg.40 The test was carried out using a term filter value of 0.05.3. Results and discussion3.1. Experimental designOur primary interest focuses in three major traits: (i) fruit and oil quality, (ii) juvenility, and (iii) plant architecture. Selection of the adequate tissues, developmental stages, and varieties, from which ESTs would be obtained, is therefore paramount. Thus, cultivars Picual and Arbequina were selected for having very different characteristics regarding fruit and oil organoleptic properties, as well as tree architecture, whereas cultivar Lechin de Sevilla was included in the study for showing intermediate phenotypes for all these traits41 (Table 1). In addition, they are among the varieties most widely cultivated worldwide.To get information about genes involved in determining oil content and composition, we selected mesocarp and seed tissues from fruits of different varieties at stages of maturation that correspond to the relevant phases of fruit development and ripening with respect to oil accumulation (Table 1). In particular, we selected mesocarp and seed tissues from green fruits with lignified endocarp as the earliest developmental stage because the lignification of the endocarp marks the start of the triacylglycerol synthesis and oil accumulation in both, the mesocarp, with a major contribution to the final composition of the olive oil and the seed. Unlike the seed, in the mesocarp, the increase in oil content continues during the ripening process that is characterized by a change in colour of the fruit, turning from green to purple and then black. Therefore, we also selected turning and purple mesocarp. In this way, we have generated five cDNA library/ collections for Sanger sequencing or pyrosequencing to obtain ESTs related to oil quality.Determining the length of the juvenile period and the plant architecture are processes strongly associated with meristematic activity. During the transition from juvenile to adult, a maturation gradient is developed in plants from the basal parts formed by juvenile apical meristems, to the upper parts formed by adult meristems.10,42–44 Thus, we generated a cDNA library using RNA extracted from actively growing buds and four cDNA collections using RNA extracted from buds containing active or inactive (dormant) buds (Table 1). In addition, in woody plants, a minimum distance from the roots to the apical meristems, measured as number of nodes rather than length, is required to get the juvenile-to-adult phase transition, suggesting that juvenility signals coming from the roots are involved in the process. Therefore, we also included in our study a cDNA library using RNA extracted from roots (Table 1).Finally, a fourth cDNA library was generated from a mix of other tissues, to extend the number of representative ESTs from olive and used for Sanger sequencing (Table 1). It is noteworthy that whereas the four cDNA libraries generated for Sanger sequencing were normalized to maximize transcriptome coverage, the cDNA collections for 454 pyrosequencing were non-normalized to gain information on gene expression levels.3.2. Sequencing resultsIn total, we obtained 1 932 337 reads (1 781 033 after trimming and cleaning), 47 518 (38 183 after trimming and cleaning) of which were generated through Sanger sequencing, with an average length of 847 bp, and 1 884 819 (1 742 850 after trimming and cleaning) generated through 454 pyrosequencing, with an average length of 269 bp (Supplementary Table S3). It is noteworthy that during the execution of the pyrosequencing project, the GS-FLX Titanium platform became available, which considerably improved the quality of the results. From an average length of 225 bp for the first 660 715 reads corresponding to the four cDNA collections generated from buds, we moved to an average length of 314 bp for the remaining 1 224 102 reads corresponding to the four cDNA collections generated from fruits. The average number of sequences left after the process, as well as their average length for each library and collection, is displayed in Supplementary Table S3. After the cleaning and trimming processes, the remaining 1 781 033 reads (92.1% of the total number of reads) were used for assembly.3.3. Sequencing data assemblyFigure 1 shows the workflow of the process used to generate ESTs from the assembly of individual libraries (OLroot, OLmer, OLrest, and OLmeso) (panel A) and collections (MIP, MIA, MAP, MAA, SGAP, MGP, MTA, and MTP) (panel B). The number of unigenes, defined as the number of contigs (consensus sequence obtained from assembled reads), and the number of singletons (unassembled reads), generated from the assembly process of the cleaned reads obtained for each library and collection, are detailed in Supplementary Table S3. Workflow followed for the individual assembly of different library/collections and for the assembly of different combinations of library/collections (e.g. assembly of libraries generated from the same tissue). Sections A and B show separate processes for both Sanger and 454 reads assembly. Different assemblies were performed using SeqMan Pro 8.1.1 except when assembling together all the reads generated, which was performed using a two-step assembly process (Newbler 2.6 followed by CAP3) to overcome problems when handling such large amount of data. QC Assembly stands for a quality control step carried out before the actual assembly, where all the reads matching any prokaryotic sequence were removed. QC Blast stands for a quality control step carried out for each assembly consisting of comparing the unigenes generated with themselves using BLAST to guarantee optimal assembly results.Workflow followed for the individual assembly of different library/collections and for the assembly of different combinations of library/collections (e.g. assembly of libraries generated from the same tissue).

QC Blast stands for a quality control step carried out for each assembly consisting of comparing the unigenes generated with themselves using BLAST to guarantee optimal assembly results.To assess the performance of the 454 assembly, a BLASTN search was carried out using as query the contigs resulting from assembling together the reads generated from the 4 collections sequenced by 454 prior to the GS-FLX Titanium upgrade (MIP, MIA, MAP, and MAA), selected for being those with the shortest average length versus a database with all the unigenes (contigs plus singletons) obtained from the assembly. If the assembly process was optimal, a singleton should not match with any of the contigs, nor a contig must match any other contig. Thus, the matches obtained between the query sequences (contigs) and the total unigenes (contigs + singletons), apart from the hit of each contig with itself, should be as few and as short as possible, demonstrating the uniqueness of each of the contigs and singletons generated through the assembly. Our analysis revealed that only 9% of the contigs (n = 4272) had BLAST hits with 100% identity with other contigs (n = 47.5) or singletons (n = 63.7), but in no case these alignments extended over the entire length of either the BLAST subject or the query, suggesting that they originate from partial similarities, rather than from ineffective assembly. Regions that obtained a perfect match against a different contig or a singleton had an average length of 125 and 114 nt, respectively, that represent 24.3% of the length of the query sequence, in average for matches to contig and 19.7% for matches to singletons. The simplest explanation for these results is that these small matching regions, with 100% identity alignments, are either small sequence motifs highly conserved in different genes or the result of alternative splicing. In either case, the results of our test indicate that the assembly pipeline was capable of distinguishing these short matches from proper matches, assigning the sequences to separate contigs.Assembling together the data generated from all the libraries and collections required the use of a more complex strategy, to overcome the limitations in the computer's memory, when handling such a large amount of sequencing data and the potential difficulties associated with sequence variability when assembling different plant varieties in a highly heterozygous species. With the clear aim of reducing the number of sequencing reads from the same gene assembled into different contigs, our chosen strategy was the sequential use of two different assemblers. The assemblers selected are based on two different mathematical models for assembly: ‘Greedy’ and ‘Overlap-Layout-Consensus’ (OLC). The Greedy assembler chosen was Newbler as it is the software provided by the company that performed the 454 sequencing (LifeScience/Roche). The OLC method of our choice was CAP3 that was carried out after the first assembly step, taking as input the output of the Newbler assembly. Thus, we obtained 162 118 unigenes from which 52 781 were contigs and 109 337 singletons. A subsequent filter was performed setting a minimal length of 200 nt. The resulting dataset was, thus, composed of 81 020 unigenes from which 47 520 were contigs (Supplementary Table S3).3.4. Analysis of the assembled datasetThe distribution by length of the unigenes generated in the assembly is shown in Fig. 2. Interestingly, only a single peak could be observed for either contigs, or unigenes, indicating that the sequences generated from the two types of technologies have been integrated during the assembly process. The GC content of the olive transcriptome assembled in this study ranged from 15.4 to 76.2% in the different unigenes, with an average of 40.4%, very similar to that of 42.5% reported previously.13Distribution of lengths of contigs and unigenes from the fully assembled dataset. Unigenes are represented in green and contigs in red.Distribution of lengths of contigs and unigenes from the fully assembled dataset. Unigenes are represented in green and contigs in red.Analysis of EST abundance in a contig can provide insight into the gene expression levels, although in our case, this information must be taken with caution because the Sanger-sequenced libraries were normalized. Figure 3 shows the distribution of contigs coverage for those originated from the assembly of all the sequences obtained. A wide distribution of coverage among the contigs can be observed in the figure, with the number of ESTs assembled into a given contig ranging between 2 and more than 1000. The largest group was that of the contigs formed by 2–4 reads (47.6% of all contigs) dropping to 19.1% of those containing 5–10 reads, probably owing to the limitations of the assembly process and length of the 454 reads, as well as the presence of normalized libraries among those generated. However, 33.2% of the total contigs were formed by 10–10 000 reads. For these contigs, the number of reads is likely to be a good indication of their level of expression, and this correlation is expected to be stronger as the number of reads forming the contigs increases. Distribution of the number of reads per contig for the contigs from the assembled dataset.Distribution of the number of reads per contig for the contigs from the assembled dataset.Probably, one of the best assessments of the quality of the assembled database is provided by the number of different transcripts of the transcriptome being tagged by at least one read; in other words, the transcriptome coverage. To estimate the transcriptome coverage, the number of olive transcripts likely to be included in our assembled dataset, we used as a reference the tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) ITAG2 protein database (http://solgenomics.net), a sequenced45 and relatively closely related species (Supplementary Fig. S1).46,47 We found that 81.2% of the tomato genes were hit by at least one read from our olive dataset. We mathematically estimated transcriptome coverage, following a strategy similar to rarefaction analysis previously used for the same purpose in pea (P. sativum).34 Random groups of reads of increasing sizes were tested for identification of tomato genes and fitted to a hyperbolic curve (Fig. 4). Because the slope at the final three points of the curve, corresponding to 60, 80, and 100% of the total reads, was very low (5 × 10-4, 3 × 10-4, and 2 × 10-4, respectively), a further increase in the size of the sample (number of reads obtained) would not result in a significant increase in gene identification. Taking into account the taxonomical distance between the two species, the different representation of tissues in our dataset, and the absence of flowers in this analysis, we are likely close in saturate the olive transcriptomes for mesocarp, meristem, and seed tissues. Thus, even though the final assembly did not collapse and we still have a number of unigenes larger than expected, we are likely to have at least one read from the majority of the transcripts generated in these tissues. Rarefaction analysis of gene representation in the assembled dataset. Different numbers of randomly sampled reads were blasted against the SOLLC protein database, and the number of proteins identified at least 1time, 5, 10 and a 100 times was recorded. The resulting data were modelled with non-linear regression y = (ax)/(b–x).Rarefaction analysis of gene representation in the assembled dataset. Different numbers of randomly sampled reads were blasted against the SOLLC protein database, and the number of proteins identified at least 1time, 5, 10 and a 100 times was recorded. The resulting data were modelled with non-linear regression y = (ax)/(b–x).An additional parameter frequently used to assess the goodness of an assembly is the transcript coverage or percentage of the total number of bases of the transcriptome that has been covered. To estimate transcript coverage, we also followed the same strategy previously applied to pea,34 which based on the notion of most transcripts requiring more than one read to cover its full length, analysed the number of genes tagged by multiple reads. Reads were again tested in random groups of increasing size, and the number of genes tagged by at least 5, 10, or 100 reads was established (Fig. 4). The lowering slopes of the curves obtained for all three cases (e.g. 6 × 10-3, 4 × 10-3, and 3 × 10-3 for genes tagged by more than 100 hits) suggest that although transcript coverage is not complete, it may also be close to saturation.We also evaluated the level of redundancy between libraries by analysing the distribution of reads in contigs across the libraries (Fig. 5). We found that 23.1% of the contigs contained reads generated from a single library, 26.9% contained contigs generated from 2, 49.0% of them contained reads that originated from 3 to 9 libraries, whereas only 0.9% contained reads originated from more than 9 to 12 libraries. As expected, even though a large percentage of contigs is formed by a reduced number of reads (Fig. 2), a large percentage of contigs contain reads from many libraries. The drop in the percentage of contigs containing reads originated from 9 to 12 libraries is likely to reflect the difference in size among some of the libraries. We further characterized the contribution of the different libraries to the final assembly by comparing the number of reads from each library that corresponds to singletons, or either belongs to contigs formed by reads shared by different libraries, or to contigs formed by reads from a single library (Fig. 6A). Two libraries, MAP and SGAP, stand out for their seemingly larger specific composition because reads classified into singletons or assembled into library-specific contigs appear overrepresented when compared with other libraries. However, these results could potentially be biased by the differences in the total number of reads existing between libraries. Thus, we also represented the data normalized against the number of reads per library (Fig. 6B). After normalization, the library generated from inactive buds from Arbequina, MIA, displayed an abnormally high level of specificity with the majority of its reads belonging to library-specific contigs. A more detailed look at the composition of this library revealed an overrepresentation of a few contigs (14) formed by an unusually high number of reads per contig (over 1000 to more than 12 000). We believe this to be a technical issue associated with the generation or sequencing of this particular library and, thus, without biological relevance. Therefore, the potential library specificity of MIA contigs should not be considered without additional evaluation. Distribution of number of libraries providing reads per contig.

The number (A), or percentage (B), of contigs shared by more than one library is represented in green, contigs formed by reads from a single library are shown in blue, and singletons in red.Because a large percentage of the contigs are formed by a reduced number of reads, potentially library-specific genes have to be considered with caution. However, when the number of reads per contig is considered in relation to the tissue specificity of each library, many of the contigs obtained show potential specificity. In regards to this, because some of the libraries were constructed using the same type of tissue, we also evaluated the level of redundancy between tissues. The assembled dataset was examined to identify unigenes formed by reads obtained from sequencing libraries generated from the same tissue. We identified a total of 26 430 unigenes that contained reads only sequenced in libraries generated from meristems, 11 352 unigenes formed by reads obtained from fruit mesocarp, 11 182 unigenes containing reads obtained from seeds, and 757 unigenes containing reads obtained from roots (Fig. 7). The reduced number of reads generated from roots, as compared to the other tissues, is likely to limit the identification of potentially specific ESTs. Because OLrest contains reads from seeds, and from stems and leaves, the results obtained from this library were not considered when establishing potential tissue specificity. Potentially tissue-specific ESTs could be of great interest, particularly considering the large number of reads generated from some of the tissues and the results from the rarefaction analysis indicating that we are close in saturating the corresponding transcriptomes (Supplementary Table S3 and Fig. 4).

Functional annotationThe assembled dataset still includes a considerable number of unassembled reads, a problem common to 454 pyrosequencing projects that may be aggravated by a relative abundance of short repeats within the species,13 the occurrence of alternative splicing, or heterozygosity.48 Theoretically, sequencing a single cultivar could reduce the limitations that heterozygosity may determine in the efficiency of the assembly. Nonetheless, we obtained similar efficiencies, when using our assembly pipeline in libraries generated from a single versus a mix of varieties (Supplementary Table S3 and data not shown). Despite these potential limitations, the functional annotation of our assembled dataset retrieved annotations from various databases for over 61.4% of the contigs (29 194 out of the total 47 520) and 27.8% of the singletons (9311 out of the total 33 500). Similar or much lower percentages of gene annotation have been reporte previously for olive ESTs sequencing projects.13,15 In addition, when we used BLAST to further evaluate the full set of unigenes against the plant sequences deposited in Uniprot, we found that 68.6% of the contigs (32 592 out of the total 47 520) and 35.4% of the singletons (11 863 out of the total 33 500) had a hit with a P-value greater than 10-6. Although the algorithm used in BLAST comparisons is based on local alignment, the relevance of this results is supported by the fact that more than 50% of the hits obtained for the contigs (16 489 of the 32 592) and over 83% of the hits obtained for the singletons (7770 out of the total 9311) extended over more than 75% of their lengths. In total, 47.5% of the unigenes have a significant hit with plant databases, having found for 63% (27 879) of these, a potential homologue. These results further support the notion of our assembly dataset being a fair representation of the olive transcriptome.The distribution of hits obtained against entries for other plants within the NCBI database was used to get a descriptive view of the newly generated dataset. The highest number of hits was obtained against V. vinifera (VITVI), Ricinus communis (RICCO), and P. tricocharpa (POPTR) (Fig. 8A). However, O. europaea (OLEEU) is only the ninth species displaying the highest numbers of hits, just two positions ahead of Arabidopsis thaliana (ARATH), probably owing to the smaller number of olive sequences present in the NCBI database when compared with the other three species. In keeping with this, species phylogenetically closer to olive such as tomato (S. lycopersicum SOLLC) or potato (Solanum tuberosum SOLTU) did display lower number of hits. We include a phylogenetic tree enclosing the species relevant for our study as supplementary material (Supplementary Fig. S1).

We established 500 Uniprot entries per species to eliminate distortions frequently observed with very underrepresented species (data not shown). After this process, although many of the species present in the untreated graph (Fig. 8A) were still present, the relative order in which they appeared was considerably altered, with the highest number of hits being obtained against olive (OLEEU) (Fig. 8B). In the normalized graph, the six closest species to our dataset, including olive (OLEEU), correspond to members of the asterids clade (Fig. 8B and Supplementary Fig. S1). In addition, VITVI (V. vinifera) dropped from the first position in the non-normalized graph to eighth and Arabidopsis (ARATH) dropped from 11th to position 23rd, being these new positions more in agreement with the taxonomic relationships between the species (Fig. 8B; Supplementary Fig. S1).The distribution of hits against different plant species is frequently used without taking into account the large differences between the total numbers of entries for each species included in the NCBI database. We show here that the results obtained without normalization are clearly influenced by the number of entries and far away from the results expected according to the taxonomical relationships between the species.Because one of our main aims was to generate ESTs with information about the metabolism involved in oil production, we also retrieved enzyme IDs from the functional annotation obtained for our dataset. We found the following distribution into each of the six major enzyme classes (http://enzyme.expasy.org/cgi-bin/enzyme/): transferases 27% (in 87 unigenes), hydrolases 24% (in 76 unigenes), oxidoreductases 30% (in 95 unigenes), ligases 5% (in 15 unigenes), lyases 7% (in 23 unigenes), and isomerases 7% (in 24 unigenes) (Supplementary Fig. S2).3.6. GO annotationBlast2GO suite38 is often used for analysing functional annotation for purposes of biologically profiling a newly generated sequence dataset beyond the single-gene level. However, because the suite has limitations when handling large datasets, we could only use Blast2GO to retrieve the GO terms previously assigned to our unigene dataset by Sma3s. To facilitate data processing, we established a cutoff for GO terms that were present in only one sequence within the DAG38 generated (data not shown). A total of 87 309 GO terms were obtained from a total of 27 494 unigenes for which at least 3 GO were obtained. The distribution of assignments into the GO categories was 14 930 unigenes with at least 3 GO terms from BP, 24 568 unigenes with at least 3 GO terms from molecular function (MF), and 11 481 unigenes with at least 3 GO terms from cellular components (CC). The most abundant high-level GO counts within these categories were BP, the very general categories of metabolic processes associated with 10 471 unigenes, and cellular processes, associated with 11 872 unigenes, and more specific, biological regulation, localization, and response to stimulus with 2832, 2168, and 2246 unigenes, respectively; MF, binding, associated with 16 902 unigenes, and catalytic activity associated with 14 657 unigenes; and CC, the very general cell, associated with 11 182 and more specific organelle, with 5220, membrane with 4789, and macromolecular complex with 2557 (Fig. 9). Level 2 GO term assignment to the olive fully assembled dataset and distribution in categories of BP, MF, and CC.Level 2 GO term assignment to the olive fully assembled dataset and distribution in categories of BP, MF, and CC.Comparisons between the functional annotations associated with tissue-specific genes can provide insights into the expression profile in relation to the nature and biological function of a given tissue. We analysed the functional enrichment of GO terms in meristem-specific genes using Fisher's exact test.39 GO terms associated with cellular division and DNA replication, as well as response to stimuli and hormones, were remarkable overrepresented among meristem-specific genes in comparison with the rest of the transcriptome (Table 2). Because meristems are actively growing sites, key for plant development and shoot branching, both processes strongly influenced by environmental and endogenous signals, such as hormones, the overrepresented GO terms in this tissue are full in keeping with these activities. Interestingly, a clear underrepresentation of terms associated with ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation and regulation could also be seen at several GO levels (Table 2), suggesting that such regulatory mechanism does not have a major role in the regulation of meristem-specific processes. Significantly enriched terms (FDR < 0.05) for potentially meristem-specific unigenesSignificantly enriched terms (FDR < 0.05) for potentially meristem-specific unigenesUnfortunately, no such a clear specific profile could be identified for the other tissues. Few relevant differences could be established with confidence in unigenes potentially specific for roots, probably owing to their significantly smaller number, likely determined by the considerably smaller number of reads obtained from this tissue. However, this underrepresentation of root genes probably allowed us to obtain the clear functional enrichment found in meristems because the likely overlap expected between the functional annotation of both tissues (e.g. abundance of GO terms associated with cell division and DNA replication) could have potentially hindered the statistical validation of such specific enrichment in meristem-specific genes. Interestingly, among the very few overrepresented GO terms associated with root-specific genes were acropetal auxin transport (GO:0010541; FDR 3 × 10-2) and basipetal auxin transport (GO:0010540; FDR 3 × 10-2).A functional overlap can also be expected between mesocarp and seeds regarding GO terms (i.e. abundance of GO terms associated with oil production), and it is probably the reason why our comparative analysis has not rendered clearer functional profiles for these two tissues. However, a number of unigenes from our assembled dataset have the annotation of GO terms associated with oil production. Quantitative analysis on the relative level of expression of unigenes associated with oil production-related GO terms would probably give insight into the gene expression profile in relation to the biological activities within these tissues.The functional profiles obtained through GO annotation from the unigenes expressed in meristems are in good agreement with the biological characteristics and activities expected for this tissue, indicating that the transcriptome hereby assembled is a valuable representation of the full transcriptome for this tissue. Thus, the dataset can be highly useful for the identification of interesting candidate genes in traits associated with meristematic activity such as regulation of the juvenility period or tree architecture. Additional work will be necessary to test the potential for the identification of candidate genes involved in oil composition and quality. However, the presence of almost 300 unigenes annotated with the GO level 4 term lipid metabolic process, or lipid biosynthesis (Table 3), does support such potential. This report represents a major contribution to the molecular knowledge of the species, opening the possibility of developing molecular tools to the level currently available for other model plant species, such as Populus or apple tree.

IntroductionMicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a novel class of single-stranded, non-coding (nc) small RNAs (sRNAs). They are about 21–22 nucleotides (nt) in length, derived from hairpin precursors (pre-miRNAs) that in turn are formed from miRNA primary transcripts. MiRNAs play critical roles in the regulation of genes responsible for cell division, differentiation, development and signalling.1 So far, 4053 miRNAs have been identified in plants, including 22 in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) (miRBase version 18, November 2011).Another important class of sRNAs is small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that also regulate gene expression. Although siRNAs are similar in size and function to miRNAs, they are double-stranded (ds) and processed from perfectly long dsRNAs derived from viruses, transgenes or endogenous transcripts such as transposons. Based on the genomic origin and the interaction of distinct components, endogenous siRNAs can be further classified into trans-acting siRNAs, natural antisense transcript-derived siRNAs (natsiRNAs), repeat-associated siRNAs (rasiRNAs), long siRNAs2 and heterochromatin siRNAs.3 All these subclasses of siRNAs are involved in biological processes.Recently, several other classes of sRNAs were defined. They are tiny ncRNAs, 21U-RNAs, scan RNAs, promoter/termini-associated sRNAs, transcription initiation RNAs, transcription start site-associated RNAs, splice site RNAs and sRNAs derived from ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) and transfer RNAs (tRNAs).4,5 Most of these sRNAs are generated through the miRNA/siRNA pathway.5 Distinctively, tRNA-derived sRNAs (tsRNAs) are essentially restricted to the cytoplasm and associated with argonaute proteins.Barley is one of the most important cereal crops worldwide, ranking fourth in terms of production and is widely used for brewing and animal feed. Phosphorus (P) is an essential nutrient for plant growth and development. In cereal crops such as barley and wheat (Triticum aestivum), sufficient P in plants increases while deficient P in plants decreases the plant growth and grain yields.6–8 Unfortunately, P availability in soil is low because soil P is often present in the precipitated or organic form that cannot be taken up by plants. On the other hand, plant requirements are high, especially for wheat and barley, whose production uses approximately 46% of the P fertilizers applied to cereals according to Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations (FAO Fertilizer and Plant Nutrition Bulletin 17; http://www.fao.org). Thus, the improvement of P uptake from low concentrations of P in soil by cereal crops is crucial for sustainable agriculture and food security. Recently, miRNAs were found to participate in P uptake into plants.9 While miRNAs regulate P starvation-responsive genes at the post-transcriptional level, they are regulated by different P concentrations per se. In lupin and soybean, 167 out of 771 and 57 out of 853 miRNAs examined, respectively, are induced by P limitation.10,11 In Arabidopsis, miR399, miR778, miR2111 and miR827 are specifically induced by deficient P.12 miR399 has been demonstrated to be a component of the shoot-to-root P deficiency signalling pathway.13,14 In contrast to miR399, the roles of miR778, miR2111 or miR827 in the regulation of phosphate (Pi) homeostasis are not clear. In this study, we used Illumina's next-generation sequencing technology to sequence sRNAs in the shoots of barley grown under P deficient and P sufficient conditions. Our data reveal a comprehensive profile of miRNAs and other classes of sRNAs under different P conditions and provide a valuable resource for identifying miRNAs and/or sRNAs important for the control of Pi homeostasis.2. Materials and methods2.1. Barley cultivarPallas barley (H. vulgare L., cv Pallas) is an X-ray mutant widely used for plant breeding and evolution.15 Pallas barley was grown in soil supplied with either 22.5 mg (deficient P) or 75 mg (sufficient P) Pi (KH2PO4) kg-1 dry soil. Basal nutrients and calcium carbonate were added into the soil, and growth conditions were the same as those described.16 The plants were harvested 16 days after seed imbibition. It is to note that the P supply of 22.5 mg Pi in the soil only results in moderate P deficiency in barley plants. The reason we adopted such Pi concentration is based on realistic soil P-deficient condition and previous studies8,17,18 showing that the supply of 22.5 mg Pi in the soil leads to 30% reduction in P concentration in barley shoots when compared with the critical P concentration required by barley plants.2.2. sRNA isolation and sequencingTotal RNA was extracted from shoot material using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). sRNAs were isolated from total RNA using the Purelink miRNA Isolation Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and then electrophoresed on a 15% polyacrylamide (30:0.8) gel containing 7 molar (M) urea in 1× Tris-borate-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) buffer (TBE: 0.04 M Tris base, 0.04 M acetate, 0.001 M EDTA, pH 8.0). Eighteen- to 30-nt sRNAs excised and eluted from the gel were ligated with both 5' (5'-GUUCAGAGUUCUACAGUCCGACGAUC-3') and 3' (5'-pUCGUAUGCCGUCUUCUGCUUGUidT-3', p-Pi, idT-inverted deoxythymidine) adaptors using T4 RNA ligase. Sequencing was performed using the 36-base Illumina platform.2.3. Trimming of sRNA sequences and bioinformatics analysisThe sequence reads obtained from the 36-base Illumina platform were filtered and trimmed as follows: after removing poly A, T, C, G and/or N-containing reads, all reads with the same read sequences were grouped and termed ‘unique reads’. Next, the 3' adapter sequence was removed as described.19 After adapter detection, the reads were re-grouped to calculate the read count of unique read sequences. All trimmed reads were compared with the complete barley chloroplast genome sequence without mismatches and then separated into non-chloroplast reads (nuclear-derived reads) and chloroplast reads. The expression of known miRNAs and other transcribed sequences was analysed using the miRanalyzer standalone version.19 Zero mismatch was set for all libraries except for Rfam that allows two mismatches. For all other parameters, the default values were used. After the reads were mapped to a given library, the mapped reads were removed and the remaining reads were used to map to another library and so on. To identify sRNAs derived from repeats such as (retro)transposons, the reads with a minimum length of 20 bp were aligned to the following libraries: (i) barley and rice libraries from the TIGR repeat database,20 (ii) the Triticeae repeat sequence database (TREP)21 and (iii) all RepBase repeats.22 To identify sRNAs corresponding to rRNAs, tRNAs, small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), snoRNAs, spliceosome RNAs (U1–U6) and other annotated ncRNAs, we compared the reads with sequences extracted from the Rfam database containing various ncRNA families and other structured RNA elements. To analyse antisense sRNAs (also called siRNAs), we first removed the reads mapped to known miRNAs and then aligned the remaining reads to the reverse strand of all barley genes available in the databases. Reads hitting the same genes were grouped into ‘read clusters’ based on their sequence similarity. The ‘anti-sense’ reads were then mapped to the forward strand of all other libraries (tRNA, genes, repeats, etc.). Because a gene could be hit by different reads (different length variants or from different genome elements), we clustered similar reads together (reads that are perfect inclusions of each other).2.4. Prediction of novel miRNAs and their targetsPrediction of novel miRNAs was performed with miRDeep23 that uses a probabilistic model of miRNA biogenesis to score compatibility of the position and frequency of the deep-sequencing reads with the hairpin structure of the miRNA precursor. All the trimmed reads were mapped (without mismatch) to barley expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences retrieved from the HarvEST:Barley (version 1.83) database (http://harvest.ucr.edu). The predicted precursor sequences were examined for their stem-loop structures with MFOLD.24 Only putative miRNA precursors meeting a minimum free energy lower than –16 kcal/mol were retained for next analysis. Target genes of the putative novel miRNAs were predicted using psRNATarget,25 a plant sRNA target analysis server (http://plantgrn.noble.org/psRNATarget).2.5. Degradome library constructionA degradome library was constructed as described.26 Briefly, poly(A) RNA, extracted from total RNA of Pallas shoots and roots using the Oligotex Kit (Qiagen), was ligated with a 5' RNA adaptor containing a MmeI restriction site using T4 RNA ligase (Invitrogen), followed by reverse transcription, second-strand synthesis, MmeI digestion, ligation of a 3' dsDNA adaptor, gel purification, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. Amplified PCR products were sequenced with the Illumina HiSeq platform.2.6. Northern blot hybridizationFifty micrograms of total RNA extracted from barley were separated on a 15% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 M urea and transferred to Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Bioscience) using 20× saline-sodium citrate buffer (SSC: 3 M NaCl and 0.3 M sodium citrate, pH 7.0). The membrane was hybridized with 32P-labelled DNA oligonucleotide probe reverse complementary to predicted miRNA sequence and made with <U+03B3>-32P -adenosine triphosphate (ATP) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA, USA). A U6 snRNA-specific probe served as a loading control. Prehybridization and hybridization were both performed at 37°C in 125 mM Na2HPO4 (pH 7.2), 250 mM NaCl, 7% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) and 50% formamide. Washing was also performed at 37°C using 2x SSC (0.3 M NaCl and 0.03 M sodium citrate), 0.2% SDS, twice followed by 1x SSC, 0.1% SDS once. The membrane was subjected to autoradiography at –80°C for 7 days.2.7. Southern blot hybridizationSouthern blot hybridization was carried out as described.27 Briefly, barley genomic DNA was digested with appropriate restriction enzymes and separated via an electrophoresis gel. The DNA was then transferred to a membrane and hybridized with radiolabelled probes. After hybridization, the membrane was washed once at 65°C for 30–45 minutes (min) in 2x SSC containing 0.1% SDS and twice at 65°C for 30–45 min in 1x SSC containing 0.1% SDS. The membrane was subjected to autoradiography at -80°C as required until some background signal became visible.2.8. Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR)Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was performed as described.28 First-strand cDNA was synthesized using total RNA as template with a primer reverse complementary to a miRNA precursor sequence. The synthesized cDNAs of pre-miRNAs were amplified using specific primer pairs with the conditions: 7 min at 95°C, followed by 45 cycles of 10 seconds (s) at 95°C, 10 s at 55°C and 30 s at 72°C and final extension step at 72°C for 10 min. The amplified products were electrophoresed in a 2% agarose gel in 1× Tris-acetate-EDTA buffer (TAE: 40 mM Tris base, 40 mM acetate and 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.3).3. Results3.1. Phenotype of Pallas barley under P-deficient conditionPallas barley was grown in the soil supplied with 22.5 mg Pi kg-1 soil (moderately deficient P, hereafter designated deficient P) and 75 mg Pi kg-1 soil (sufficient P). Under deficient P, Pallas grew slowly when compared with plants grown with sufficient P, but showed no other symptoms of P deficiency (Fig. 1). Phenotypes of barley (H. vulgare L. cv Pallas) grown for 16 days in soil amended with either 22.5 mg (deficient P) or 75 mg (sufficient P) KH2PO4 kg-1 dry soil.Phenotypes of barley (H. vulgare L. cv Pallas) grown for 16 days in soil amended with either 22.5 mg (deficient P) or 75 mg (sufficient P) KH2PO4 kg-1 dry soil.3.2. Size distribution of sRNAs from P-deficient and P-sufficient barley shootsTotals of 7 006 282 sRNA sequencing reads of 36 bases from P-deficient barley shoots and 6 184 850 sRNA sequencing reads of 36 bases from P-sufficient barley shoots were obtained [the sequences have been deposited in the publicly accessible database, National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) with accession number SRA025074.1]. Figure 2A shows the size distribution of sRNAs in P-deficient and P-sufficient shoots after the removal of poly A, T, C, G, N and adaptor sequences. Twenty and 21 nt were the two major size classes in each P treatment. Twenty four-nt sRNAs were abundant in P-deficient shoots, but not in P-sufficient shoots. Nineteen- and 22-nt sRNAs were slightly less abundant than the 20-, 21- and 24-nt sRNAs for both P treatments. Other sizes of sRNAs were found in low abundance in both P treatments. Overall, 19-, 20-, 21- and 24-nt sRNAs were more abundant in P-deficient shoots than in P-sufficient shoots (Fig. 2A). These data are not very consistent with the size distribution of sRNAs from another barley cultivar Clipper (H. vulgare L. cv Clipper), where 24 nt was the only major size class.29 Clipper and Pallas are two distinct barley genotypes. Taken together, these suggest that the expression of 24-nt sRNAs is subject to conditions. Size distribution of sRNA sequencing reads from P-deficient and P-sufficient barley shoots.

(B) Size distribution of unique reads. This figure appears in colour in the online version of DNA Research.After the removal of duplicated reads, 24-nt sRNAs were the most dominant size class, followed by the 23-nt sRNAs for both P treatments (Fig. 2B). This indicates that 20- and 21-nt sRNAs largely consisted of redundant sRNAs, whereas 24-nt sRNAs primarily comprised unique or low abundant sRNAs. Twenty four-nt sRNAs, which are implicated to derive from intergenic and repetitive genomic regions and mainly guide transcriptional gene silencing,30,31 accounted for 48.5% of the total unique sRNAs in P-deficient shoots and 29.4% in P-sufficient shoots. The number of 24-nt sRNAs in P-deficient shoots was over twice that in P-sufficient shoots. In contrast, the numbers of other sizes of sRNAs were similar for each P treatment (Fig. 2B). When a read count threshold =4 or 10 was applied, all sRNA sizes were significantly decreased in number in both P-deficient and P-sufficient shoots, except for 24-nt sRNAs in P-deficient shoots, indicating that most sRNAs are low copy.3.3. sRNAs are generated from both the nuclear and chloroplast genomesChloroplasts have their own genome, transcriptional and translational machineries. Many chloroplast-derived sRNAs (csRNAs) have recently been identified.32–34 We took advantage of the available barley chloroplast genome sequence to distinguish between sRNAs derived from the chloroplast and nuclear genomes in barley and found that about one-fourth of sRNAs were derived from the chloroplast genome in both P-deficient and P-sufficient shoots (Table 1). In contrast to sRNAs derived from the nuclear genome, csRNAs were highly redundant in both P treatments. Further analysis showed that there were fewer differentially expressed sRNAs derived from the chloroplast genome in P-deficient shoots than in P-sufficient shoots, whereas the trend was reversed for differentially expressed sRNAs derived from the nuclear genome (Table 1). Statistics of the sequencing reads in P-deficient and P-sufficient shoots of Pallas barley=1, =4 or =10 is the read count threshold. For the detection of down-regulated [log2(-P/+P) =-1] and up-regulated reads [log2(-P/+P) =1], only common reads (present in both P conditions) are used.Statistics of the sequencing reads in P-deficient and P-sufficient shoots of Pallas barley=1, =4 or =10 is the read count threshold. For the detection of down-regulated [log2(-P/+P) =-1] and up-regulated reads [log2(-P/+P) =1], only common reads (present in both P conditions) are used.When a read count threshold =4 or 10 was applied, the numbers of P treatment-specific sRNAs derived from the nuclear or chloroplast genome were greatly reduced (Table 1), indicating that many of the treatment-specific sRNAs are low in abundance. The abundance of sRNAs derived from the nuclear or chloroplast genome, or common to both P treatments, is also reduced, but not significantly. In contrast, the abundance of sRNAs derived from the nuclear or chloroplast genome, or differentially expressed under P deficiency and sufficiency, is less changed, indicating that most of these sRNAs are relatively abundant.3.4. Expression profile of miRNAs in P-deficient and P-sufficient shootsTo identify barley miRNAs, all non-chloroplast reads from P-deficient and P-sufficient shoots were aligned to known barley miRNAs from miRBase. Nineteen barley miRNAs were mapped in P-sufficient shoots and 18 in P-deficient shoots (Table 2, Supplementary Table S1). The extra miRNA in P-sufficient shoots is miR444a that is a low-copy miRNA. It is unclear if this miRNA is a bona fide miRNA or resulted from a sequencing error. Three barley miRNAs, hvu-miR399, hvu-miR1126 and hvu-miR5051, were significantly up-regulated in P-deficient shoots (log2 > 1) (Table 2, Supplementary Table S1). The expression pattern of miR399 is consistent with previous reports,13 suggesting that these miRNAs may indeed be up-regulated by deficient P. Hvu-miR168 was the most abundant barley miRNA, followed by hvu-miR156 in both P treatments (Table 2, Supplementary Table S1). The two miRNAs together accounted for 95.3% of the annotated barley miRNAs in P-sufficient shoots and 95.1% in P-deficient shoots. Such highly expressed miRNAs are likely to have important roles in barley. In Arabidopsis, miR168 has been shown to regulate argonaute-1 (AGO1) that is involved in both miRNA biogenesis and mRNA degradation,3 whereas miR156 regulates squamosa promoter binding protein-like (SPL) transcription factors that define an endogenous flowering pathway.35 However, neither of these two miRNAs was significantly differentially expressed between P-deficient and P-sufficient shoots, suggesting that the expression of these two miRNAs may be independent of P nutritional status. To identify conserved miRNAs, the remaining unmapped reads were aligned to miRNAs from other species in miRBase. One hundred and forty seven miRNAs in P-sufficient shoots and 171 in P-deficient shoots were mapped (Supplementary Table S2). Of these conserved miRNAs, 55 were only present in P-deficient shoots while 32 only existed in P-sufficient shoots. MiR156 was the most abundant among all the conserved miRNAs identified in both P treatments. Barley miRNAs identified in P-deficient and P-sufficient shoots of Pallas barley‘#NUM’ means that the log2 cannot be calculated with a read count of 0 in either sample. ‘-P norm’ is a linear normalization to get the total read counts equal in both samples. The same meaning below.Barley miRNAs identified in P-deficient and P-sufficient shoots of Pallas barley‘#NUM’ means that the log2 cannot be calculated with a read count of 0 in either sample. ‘-P norm’ is a linear normalization to get the total read counts equal in both samples. The same meaning below.Seven conserved miRNAs were up-regulated, while 19 were down-regulated (|log2| > 1) in P-deficient shoots when a threshold was =10 (Table 3). MiR399 was only detected in P-deficient shoots, but not in P-sufficient shoots (Table 3). MiR827 was also significantly up-regulated, being 8 times more abundant in P-deficient shoots than in P-sufficient shoots, which is consistent with previous studies.12,36 In contrast to miR399, miR827 was much more abundant in both P treatments (Table 3). In addition, miR827 has an additional role in drought tolerance (M. Aukerman and W. Park, unpublished data). These suggest that the two P-responsive miRNAs might be regulated by different mechanisms. Surprisingly, one miRNA, dme-miR-1–3p, from Drosophila was detected and significantly up-regulated in P-deficient shoots (Table 3). MiRNAs conserved between plants and animals have been reported previously.37 If this result is true, then dme-miR-1–3p could be used as a phylogenetic marker to help unravel the evolutionary history and relationships between plants and insects. Differentially expressed miRNAs between P-deficient and P-sufficient shoots of Pallas barleyThreshold =10 is applied. ‘-’ indicates that miRNAs are down-regulated, whereas the others are up-regulated.Differentially expressed miRNAs between P-deficient and P-sufficient shoots of Pallas barleyThreshold =10 is applied. ‘-’ indicates that miRNAs are down-regulated, whereas the others are up-regulated.Previous studies showed that miR778 and miR2111 are up-regulated under P limitation in Arabidopsis.12 However, these two miRNAs were not present in barley shoots, or in rice,12 suggesting that they may be dicot specific. MiR398 was not present in barley shoots either, but it is present and down-regulated under P limitation in Arabidopsis.12 In addition, unlike in Arabidopsis,12 miR169 and miR395 were not down-regulated under P limitation in barley shoots (Table 3). These data indicate that miRNAs have different responses to P in different species.To confirm the expression of conserved miRNAs, Northern hybridization was performed using probes reversely complementary to hvu-miR156, hvu-miR399, osa-miR528, bdi-miR827 and bdi-miR408. These miRNAs were selected because they were relatively abundant. Hvu-miR399 and bdi-miR408 were hardly detectable, but the three other miRNAs were detected in both P-deficient and P-sufficient shoots (Fig. 3). Bdi-miR827 was expressed at a higher level in P-deficient shoots than in P-sufficient shoots, whereas osa-miR528 expression was slightly reduced under P deficiency (Fig. 3). Both miRNAs were expressed at higher levels in leaves than in roots (Fig. 3). The expression level of hvu-miR156 did not differ between P-deficient and P-sufficient leaves, but was higher in P-deficient roots than in P-sufficient roots (Fig. 3).The expression levels of these miRNAs detected by the Northern hybridization were in agreement with the read abundances of the same miRNAs identified from the deep sequencing.

Predicted novel miRNAs in P-deficient and P-sufficient shootsTo identify novel miRNAs, we only selected miRNA precursor sequences with secondary structures having higher negative minimal free energies and minimal free energy index (MFEI) than other different type of RNAs and MFEI of greater than 0.85.38 Then, we aligned all reads to these selected miRNA precursor sequences. If the reads displayed one or two peaks without appearance in the intervening region, these reads would be taken on board as novel miRNA candidates for further analyses. This is based on the alignment patterns of known miRNAs from miRBase (data not shown). These two typical patterns can be explained by the stability of duplexes or the stability of miRNAs that are incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). Accordingly, we identified 12 novel miRNA candidates present in both P-deficient and P-sufficient shoots (Table 4). One miRNA (hvu-miRX27) was found to exist in two mature sequences, but differing only by 1 nt extension at the ends (Table 4). It is unclear which mature sequence is a true miRNA sequence.

Targets were predicted using psRNAtarget (http://plantgrn.noble.org/psRNATarget/). Cleavage sites were determined using degradome library.Most of the predicted novel miRNAs were 20–21 nt in length and had a preference for A at the 5' end (Table 4), which is different from conserved miRNAs that have a preference for U at the 5' end.28,39,40 Most of the predicted novel miRNAs were expressed at higher levels in P-deficient shoots than in P-sufficient shoots (Table 4). Three miRNAs (hvu-miRX25, hvu-miRX29 and hvu-miRX32) were significantly up-regulated in P-deficient shoots (Table 4).3.6. Validation of predicted novel miRNAsNorthern blot hybridization was used to validate the predicted novel miRNAs. Two (hvu-miRX21 and hvu-miRX22) out of 3 selected novel miRNA candidates (hvu-miRX21, hvu-miRX22 and hvu-miRX27) generated a clear hybridization signal of expected size in leaves, but not in roots, for both P treatments (Fig. 3). RT-PCR was used to further confirm the miRNA candidates. All the candidates generated specific products of expected size in shoot tissue (Fig. 4). Hvu-miRX27 appeared to be more highly expressed in P-sufficient shoots than in P-deficient shoots, whereas hvu-miRX21 showed similar yields between P-deficient and P–sufficient shoots.

Predicted miRNA targets and validationMiRNA targets were predicted using psRNAtarget. All the novel miRNA candidates had their targets found in the HVGI database (Release 11). Some targets had known function, whereas others were not annotated (Table 4). In addition, some targets were targeted by abundant miRNAs, whereas others were targeted only by scarce miRNAs (Table 4). To validate the predicted targets, which could in turn confirm the predicted novel miRNAs, we constructed a degradome library based on the miRNA-guided cleavage of the target between the 10th and 11th nt of complementarity relative to the guiding miRNA. This library has advantages over the 5'-RACE approach that requires a priori miRNA target prediction and only tests one target at a time. This library has been deposited in NCBI with accession number SRS376178. Three predicted novel miRNAs, hvu-miR23, hvu-miR27 and hvu-miR31, out of 12 from P-deficient and P-sufficient shoots were perfectly reverse complementary to the first 10 nt of 3 sequence fragments in the library (Table 4), providing potential evidence of miRNA-mediated cleavage. Intriguingly, all these three target genes were cleaved more than twice at different positions (Table 4). This suggests that these miRNAs may have diverted cleavage sites. It is of notice that one target (DN159928) is regulated by the miRNA at both translational and transcriptional levels (Table 4).3.8. Profiles of other classes of nuclear-derived ncRNAs in P-deficient and P-sufficient shootsTo explore the profiles of other classes of nuclear-derived ncRNAs in Pallas P-deficient and P-sufficient shoots, all the non-miRNA reads were aligned to the Rfam database. Seven hundred and ninety six and 715 ncRNAs were mapped in P-deficient and P-sufficient shoots, respectively, of which 114 ncRNAs were specific to P-deficient shoots, whereas 32 ncRNAs were specific to P-sufficient shoots (Supplementary Table S3). Of 683 shared ncRNAs, 176 were up-regulated whereas 51 were down-regulated in P-deficient shoots (Supplementary Table S3). The most abundant ncRNAs were small subunit rRNA 5-derived sRNAs, followed by tsRNAs in both P treatments. The two classes of sRNAs accounted for 80% of the mapped ncRNAs in P-deficient shoots and 76.3% in P-sufficient shoots (Supplementary Table S3).tsRNAs were further dissected by aligning all the non-miRNA reads to tRNA databases. Fifty-six out of the total 61 tRNAs were found to generate tsRNAs in both P-deficient and P-sufficient shoots. These 56 tRNAs specify all essential 20 amino acids encoded by the standard genetic code (Supplementary Table S4). Six tsRNAs were significantly up-regulated (log2 > 1), whereas 4 were significantly down-regulated (log2 <–1), in P-deficient shoots (Supplementary Table S4). Notably, the read count of tsRNAs was 2-fold greater in P-deficient shoots than in P-sufficient shoots (Supplementary Table S4).tsRNAs derived from tRNA-Gly(TCC) were the most abundant tsRNA species in both P treatments, accounting for 58.6% of the total tsRNAs in P-deficient shoots and 58.2% in P-sufficient shoots (Supplementary Table S4). tRNA-Ala(AGC)-derived sRNAs were the second most abundant species in P-sufficient shoots, but the third in P-deficient shoots. The second most abundant tsRNA in P-deficient shoots was tRNA-Arg(CCT)-derived sRNAs (Supplementary Table S4). The relative proportions of the other tsRNAs did not appear to be consistent between the two P treatments (Supplementary Table S4).Next, we analysed rasiRNAs by aligning all the non-miRNA reads to the TREP database that contains 1716 transposable elements (TEs). TEs are a major source of siRNAs41,42 that in turn suppress the mutagenic activity of TEs.43 The sRNAs derived from 685 TEs in P-deficient shoots and the sRNAs derived from 582 TEs in P-sufficient shoots were identified (Supplementary Table S5). Of them, 581 TE-derived sRNAs were common between the two P treatments. Almost every TE-derived sRNA was less abundant in P-sufficient shoots than in P-deficient shoots, with half of these significantly down-regulated (log2 >–1) (Supplementary Table S5). There are 59.8% of the TE-derived sRNAs being mapped to retrotransposons (Class I TEs), 32.6% to DNA transposons (Class II TEs) and 7.6% to unclassified TEs in P-sufficient shoots (Table 5). Coincidentally, 53% of the TE-derived sRNAs were mapped to retrotransposons, 39.6% to DNA transposons and 7.3% to unclassified TEs in P-deficient shoots (Supplementary Table S5). The percentage of each class of TE-derived sRNAs was similar between the two P treatments. Similar results were also obtained when the reads were aligned to other repetitive databases such as Repbase, the TIGR rice repeat database and the TIGR barley repeat database (Supplementary Table S5). Summary of mapped TE-derived sRNAs in P-deficient and P-sufficient shoots of Pallas barleySummary of mapped TE-derived sRNAs in P-deficient and P-sufficient shoots of Pallas barleyTo analyse natsiRNAs, another source of siRNAs that are capable of blocking the translation of mRNAs or degrading mRNAs through the siRNA pathway,44 all non-miRNA reads were firstly aligned to the reverse strand of barley genes available in the databases, and the mapped reads were then aligned to the forward strand of all other libraries, including tRNA, genes, repeats and so on. In total, 290 234 and 303 953 natsiRNAs were identified in P-deficient and P-sufficient shoots, respectively, of which many were treatment specific (Supplementary Table S6).Some natsiRNAs were found to target multiple genes, whereas others target only a single gene (Supplementary Table S6). The latter accounted for 80.6% of the total mapped genes in P-deficient shoots and 78.2% in P-sufficient shoots. A great number of natsiRNAs were derived from TEs (Supplementary Table S6), which is consistent with previous studies.45 Many natsiRNAs formed duplexes (Supplementary Table S6).The discovery of siRNA duplexes prompted us to investigate sense siRNAs. Alignment of all the nuclear-derived reads to barley genes in the HVGI database identified 128 corresponding barley genes in P-sufficient shoots and 137 in P-deficient shoots (Supplementary Tables S5 under non-chloroplast sense sRNAs). Some genes had more associated reads than other genes. In addition, more sense siRNAs were present in P-deficient shoots than in P-sufficient shoots. The expression levels of sense siRNAs were also higher in P-deficient shoots than in P-sufficient shoots.3.9. Profile of csRNAs in P-deficient and P-sufficient shootsCsRNAs in the two P treatments were further analysed in detail. The result showed that the csRNAs were derived from all regions of the chloroplast genome, including CDS (Supplementary Table S7 under chloroplast sRNAs_CDS), tRNA genes (Supplementary Table S7 under chloroplast sRNAs_tRNA) and repetitive sequences (Supplementary Table S7 under chloroplast sRNAs_rep). The chloroplast-derived tsRNAs were the most abundant sRNA class, accounting for 22.7% of the total sRNAs in P-deficient shoots and 19% in P-sufficient shoots (Supplementary Table S7 under chloroplast sRNAs_tRNA). One tsRNA derived from the tRNA-His(GUG) gene was the most abundant of all the sRNAs (including miRNAs) sequenced. This tsRNA accounted for 84.5% of the total tsRNAs identified and 51.2% of the total csRNAs. This result explains why csRNAs are highly redundant when compared with sRNAs derived from the nuclear genome. Curiously, this most abundant tsRNA was only present in barley leaves and not in roots (Fig. 5A) and is perfectly reversely complementary to a gene involved in biological processes. The absence or low expression of this tsRNA in the roots may be due to reduced plastid copy numbers in roots compared to those in leaves.46Northern blot hybridization of tsRNAs derived from tRNA-His(GTG) and read distribution on four tRNA genes in P-deficient (-P) and P-sufficient (+P) shoots of barley. (A) Total RNA extracted from leaf and root tissues from P-deficient and P-sufficient barley was hybridized with probes reversely complementary to the most abundant tsRNA derived from tRNA-His(GTG).

This figure appears in colour in the online version of DNA Research.Alignment of all the csRNAs to the tRNA-HIS(GUG) gene revealed that the distribution of csRNAs over the gene was uneven. A peak was located at the 5' end, where the sequence corresponded to that of the most abundant tsRNA (Fig. 5B), suggesting that the most abundant tsRNA is not randomly generated. Other tsRNAs gave a similar distribution pattern as the tRNA-HIS(GUG)-derived sRNAs (Fig. 5B).tsRNAs derived from four tRNA genes, trnR-ACG, trnE-UUC, trnL-CAA and trnL-UAA, were significantly up-regulated (log2 > 1), whereas tsRNAs derived from the trnS-GCU gene were significantly down-regulated (log2 < -1), in P-deficient shoots (Supplementary Table S7 under chloroplast sRNAs_tRNA). A few other csRNAs derived from the other regions were also found to be significantly differentially expressed (|log2| = 1) between the two P treatments (Supplementary Table S7). These results imply that P nutrition is associated with the expression of some csRNAs.Unexpectedly, 95 barley genes were mapped by csRNAs in each of the P-deficient and P-sufficient shoots (Supplementary Table S7 under chloroplast sRNAs_HVGI), although this number is lower than that mapped by the nuclear sRNAs (128 in P-sufficient shoots and 137 in P-deficient shoots). One barley gene (TC277237), encoding photosystem II reaction centre protein H, was mapped the most by csRNAs in both P treatments. sRNAs derived from seven barley genes were present in both the chloroplast genome and the nuclear genome but were differentially expressed between the two genomes (Table 6). For example, sRNAs derived from the gene TC250483 were more abundant in the nuclear genome than in the chloroplast genome, whereas sRNAs derived from the gene BY843503 were more abundant in the chloroplast genome than in the nuclear genome (Table 6). These data suggest that a genome or organelle-specific factor may be involved in the expression of each class of sRNAs. Shared gene-derived sRNAs between chloroplast and nucleusShared gene-derived sRNAs between chloroplast and nucleus4. DiscussionP is a key determinant of plant growth and development, but its availability is low in the soil. Therefore, finding an effective way to enable cereal crops to take up Pi from low P soils efficiently is desirable. MiRNAs have been shown to be important gene regulators in plant Pi homeostasis. In Arabidopsis, a few of miRNAs have been identified to be regulated by P,47 suggesting a close relationship between miRNA and P. To investigate this relationship in barley, we comprehensively analysed sRNA sequence datasets generated by deep sequencing from Pallas barley grown under P-deficient and P-sufficient conditions. Our result showed that about 1 million sRNA sequences out of the total 7 million sequences were specific to either P-deficient or P-sufficient treatment. In addition, over 30% of common sequences were significantly differentially expressed between the two P treatments. These indicate that P has a great impact on the expression of sRNAs. How P affects the expression of sRNAs is unclear, but it likely involves its signalling pathway that results in some genes being activated, whereas others being degraded, under different P conditions, thus leading to different sRNA populations. We observed that more sRNAs were generated under P-deficient condition than under P-sufficient condition. A similar situation has been described previously.48 In addition, we observed that the number of individual siRNAs or miRNAs is also more in P-deficient treatment than in P-sufficient treatment. Coincidentally, more mRNA-derived individual sRNAs were found in P-deficient treatment when compared with those in P-sufficient treatment. One model could be used to explain these phenomena: P deficiency causes the instability or degradation of RNA molecules firstly because P is a part of an RNA molecule, and the lack of P reduces its incorporation into the RNA molecules, and then the generated sRNAs are used as siRNAs to guide the cellular RNA degradation machinery.49 This has been the case in Drosophila50 and Arabidopsis.51 However, it must be pointed out that such degradation mode is only for sRNAs derived from the 3', but not 5', terminal regions.45 The 5' terminal degradation mode from the miRNA/siRNA-induced cleavage has not yet been elucidated so far.We have identified a total of 233 miRNAs in Pallas barley, of which some were significantly differentially expressed between the two P treatments (|log2| = 1), whereas others were P treatment specific. A total of 214 miRNAs have been detected using cross-species comparison or prediction. In a recent study, 126 conserved miRNAs and 148 barley-specific miRNAs were identified in barley cultivar Clipper.29 To add evidence to the identified miRNAs, we compared our set of miRNAs with the ones detected in Clipper. We found that of the total 233 miRNAs identified in Pallas, 94 (40.3%) have also been detected in Clipper (allowing at most 1 mismatch). There is a clear tendency between coexistence (expressed in both Pallas and Clipper) and expression level. The most expressed miRNAs in Pallas are also highly expressed in Clipper, whereas lower expressed miRNAs have a lower probability to co-exist.Many miRNAs are known to show a strongly tissue-dependent expression profile. Because the Pallas and Clipper data were generated from different tissues (shoots only in Pallas and a mixed tissues of leaves, stems, roots and spikes in Clipper), the absence of coexistence does not necessarily imply a false positive miRNA detection/prediction. It might be due to the tissue-specific expression profile of many miRNAs. For example, hvu-miR156 is the second highest expressed miRNA in Pallas, whereas the same miRNA in Clipper is only ranked 14. In addition, in Pallas, hvu-miR156 is 0 order of magnitude from the highest expressed hvu-miR168, whereas in Clipper, this miRNA is over two orders of magnitude from the highest expressed hvu-miR167d (Supplementary Table S8). Both the highest expressed hvu-miR168 in Pallas and the highest expressed hvu-miR167d in Clipper have roughly the same scale in expression level (Supplementary Table S8). This suggests that miR156 might be highly shoot specific. Interestingly, the two highly expressed novel miRNAs (hvu-miRX21 and hvu-miRX22) in Pallas, which have not been detected in any other species so far, are not detected in Clipper either. Another highly expressed miRNA that is absent in Clipper is miR827, which is strongly up-regulated under deficient P (Supplementary Table S8) and might, therefore, not be in Clipper barley that grew under a normal (P) nutrition condition.tsRNAs were the second most abundant sRNA class in both P treatments, accounting for 22.7% of the total sRNAs in P-deficient treatment and 19% in P-sufficient treatment. The high abundance of tsRNAs has been the case in epimastigotes and trypomastigotes, which accounts for 30 and 40% of the total sRNAs, respectively.50 To our surprise, one tsRNA derived from the chloroplast-encoded tRNA-His(GTG) gene is the most abundant sRNA of all the sRNAs sequenced in both P treatments. Recent studies have shown that tsRNAs are Dicer dependent, can be incorporated into the RISC and direct Ago-mediated cleavage.4,50,52,53 These suggest that tsRNAs can function in an miRNA-like pathway.5,54 This would then imply that tsRNAs could play a certain role in the cells. Indeed, a tsRNA (tRF-1001) from human prostate cancer cells was recently demonstrated to be required for cell viability through the siRNA/miRNA pathway.4Although tsRNAs are processed by Dicer-like endonucleases and associated with argonautes as miRNAs, they are derived from RNA polymerase III-catalyzed transcripts. In contrast, miRNAs are derived from RNA polymerase II transcripts. In addition, the sizes of tsRNAs are generally larger than those of miRNAs. In bacteria, fungi, plants and animals, the size of tsRNAs ranges from 30 to 35 nt.4 Furthermore, tRNA genes are mostly cleaved at or around the anti-codon loop in both yeast and humans.55,56 However, in barley, we found that the predominant size of tsRNAs was 20 nt, with the cleavage sites mainly occurring at the very 5' ends of tRNA transcripts. This observation indicates that the biogenesis of tsRNAs in barley may adopt a mechanism different from tsRNAs in other organisms.Chloroplast-derived sRNAs are a novel class of sRNAs. A large number of csRNAs have been identified in various species.32,57–60 CsRNAs have been proposed to protect RNA from degradation.61 However, the biogenesis mechanism of these csRNAs is unclear. It is believed that normal RNA degradation processes and the miRNA/siRNA pathway may both be involved. RNA degradation uses ribonucleases to cleave RNA at exposed sites. However, the main enzyme responsible for initial cleavage in the course of RNA degradation has not been identified in plant chloroplasts.62 The miRNA/siRNA pathway adopts a specific Dicer ribonuclease to initially generate hairpin precursors, resulting in 20–24 nt short duplexes. However, this process may not be accomplished in the chloroplast per se, but in the nucleus, because the Dicer ribonuclease is not present in the chloroplast.62 This could explain why so far no miRNAs have been identified in the chloroplast. In the case of the chloroplast-derived tsRNAs, which are the most abundant csRNAs in barley, their generation may involve RNase P, an endoribonuclease essential for processing polycistronic precursor tRNAs into mature tRNA 5' ends.63 In addition, other tRNA-specific nucleases, such as colicin E5, colicin D, prrC, ranpirnase or onconase and angiogenin, could be involved.4 However, the involvement of such enzymes cannot explain the preferential cleavage sites found in the tsRNAs.P affects the expression of csRNAs (Table 1). This suggests that P may be involved in degradative changes in the chloroplasts. Previous studies have shown that P deficiency decreases the chlorophyll content to levels below what is required for chloroplast stability and the ability of the chloroplast to synthesize ATP.64 This implies that csRNAs may result from a lack of energy available for photosynthesis and cellular respiration. However, we must point out that it cannot be determined, if csRNAs are derived from the chloroplast genome or derived from chloroplast-derived sequences inserted in the nuclear genome. Therefore, the data for csRNAs identified in this study may not truly reflect the real situation in the plants.Supplementary dataSupplementary Data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.The authors wish to thank Ursula Langridge, Hui Zhou, Bryce Shi and Petrus Tang for providing assistance.

IntroductionMicrosatellites, or simple sequence repeats (SSRs), are repetitive stretches of a tandemly repeated motif of one to six base pairs, which has evolved and expanded owing to the replication slippage mechanism that is supposed to be the cause of their high polymorphic rates.1 Recently, using a genome-wide alignment of two Orzya species var. indica and japonica, it has been demonstrated that the distribution of microsatellites is also influenced by the motif sequence and the sequence characteristics of the adjoining regions possessing the microsatellites, in addition to the replication slippage and point mutation model.2 These repetitive stretches may occur in coding and in non-coding regions of the genome. SSRs have been potentially designated as a class of co-dominant markers for evaluating germplasm, establishing phylogenetic and evolutionary relationships. It has been observed that clusters of microsatellite motifs with moderate GC are abundant on chromosome number 2 in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, which suggests that repetitive stretches may be biased towards the accumulation in a certain regions.3 Microsatellites have been associated with various functional roles such as their possible role in the regulation of promoters, transcription and translation, and these sequence repeats have been credited with evolutionary importance.4–6 The positioning of microsatellites in the genome seems to play an important role in their regulatory activity; hence, studying the distribution and understanding the possible reasons of microsatellites expansions across genomes have currently been the focus of current intense research.Organelle genomes, plant chloroplast and animal mitochondrial genomes have been referred to as natural counterparts.7,8 Features such as conserved gene order, lack of heteroplasmy (occurrence of more than one type of organelle genome), low recombination rates and their relative small size are making these organelle genomes the widely used tools for phylogenetic studies. However, lack of heteroplasmy has not been universally observed in all the mitochondrial genomes and has been earlier potentially reviewed with the occurrence and factors affecting the stoichiometry of heteroplasmy in mitochondrial genomes of plants and animals.9 The uniparental inheritance of the organelle markers provides a means to elucidate the genetic flow and genetic structure of the population and the organelle markers have been widely used in population studies (for a review see Provan et al.).8In silico development of SSRs of organelle genomes has brought them up as potential markers for transferability among the species, ease of development and as key players in genome length variation. They have been widely demonstrated as potential markers for establishing molecular evolutionary histories, demographic diversity and resolving phylogeny in a wide variety of species from Pinus (forest species) to Oryza sativa (Monocots).10–12 There have been recent reports on the identification of perfect repeats in organelle genomes of various organisms.11–16 However, previous studies have only been focused on a relatively small number of genomes and only perfect repeats have been identified. A proper characterization system that would allow researchers to search for the association of these repeats with the coding or non-coding regions has been lacking in these reports.In the past few years, systematic curated web repositories have been developed for the organelle genomes, which includes FUGOID that displays the curated distribution of introns in organelle genomes with functional and structural data.17 A database of universally published primer sequences of chloroplast genomes has been developed, providing a platform for studying molecular variations and evolution in chloroplasts.18 These organelle genomes have been exploited further for the mining of genes, exons, introns, gene products, taxonomy, RNA editing sites, SNPs and haplotype information, all of which are displayed as curated information in GOBASE.19 A comprehensive repository of unique proteins expressed in chloroplast proteome using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry has been developed (AT_CHLORO), serving as a knowledge base to explore the envelope proteins.20 However, a complete curated web-oriented integrated repository of repeat pattern is still lacking. This has motivated us to undertake a genome-wide study and to develop a web-enabled interface to analyse the perfect and the imperfect repeats in organelle genomes.We propose ChloroMitoSSRDB that offers a wide visualization of perfect and imperfect repeats across the chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes with corresponding genomic coordinates. The aim of ChloroMitoSSRDB is to constitute a platform to access the utility of SSRs as markers for phylogenetic classification across species. To our knowledge, this is the first updated integrated repository of the genomic repeats in chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes accessible via web interface.2. Material and methods2.1. Genome data retrieval and pattern searchAll the studied chloroplast (179) and mitochondrial (1982) genomes were retrieved from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) RefSeq database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). The required files such as gbk, fna, faa, gff and ptt were downloaded for the studied chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes and were stored as flat files sorted for each genome. For the identification of the perfect and imperfect repeats, the software tool Imperfect Microsatellite Extractor (IMEx)21 has been used, which uses a sliding window algorithm to identify the regions with a repetitive stretch of a particular nucleotide motif either stretched perfectly or with levels of imperfection.The algorithm allows the user to specify the minimal length of the consecutive nucleotide stretch and reports the SSR motif, motif repeat counts, coordinates of the SSRs tract in the genome and its location relative to coding and non-coding regions. The association of the repeats in coding and intercoding regions was determined based on the sequence annotation information available in GenBank database (NCBI, www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). We applied the following length criteria (Mono-, 12; Di-, 6; Tri-, 4; and for Tetra- to Hexa repeats, a minimum stretch of three minimum repetitions) to define each SSRs as a true repeat. In case of imperfect repeats, the parameter for imperfection percentage (p%) is set to 10% indicating the level of imperfection allowed in each repeat tract.3. Results and discussions3.1. Structure of ChloroMitoSSRDB databaseChloroMitoSSRDB is hosted on a 32-bit Linux server pre-installed with MySQL (http://www.mysql.com/), Apache (http://www.apache.org/) and PHP (http://www.php.net/) commonly called as LAMP. A flow chart explaining the organization and the work flow of the ChloroMitoSSRDB has been presented (Fig. 1). ChloroMitoSSRDB is based on a simple comprehensive relational database management system, MySQL, that is sufficient for organizing, storing and retrieving the data with a single query. The details of the relational MySQL tables used in the construction of the ChloroMitoSSRDB database are explained in Tables 1 and 2. Table 1 shows the metadata for each genome, whereas the structure of the MySQL relational tables depicting the repeat information stored for the coding and the non-coding regions is given in Table 2. Each query has been split into hierarchical levels of information that displays information on each Genome (e.g. accession, sequence length and nucleotide composition) (Table 1).

The complete repeat information of the database is stored in two different tables (refer Table 2), storing the perfect and imperfect repeats of all chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes. The repeat information includes the details of individual repeats such as the sequence ID, start and end coordinates of the repeat, the repeating motif, number of iterations, total tract length, nucleotide composition of the repeat, protein information of coding repeats. In addition, the table displaying the imperfect repeats also stores the imperfection percentage and alignment information that can be used to study the evolution of these repeats.3.2. Web visualization of ChloroMitoSSRDBThe front end of the database is integrated via web accessible PHP scripts. The web interface allows various patterns of search for the repeats in organelle genomes. The complete browsing outlay of the ChloroMitoSSRDB is displayed (Fig. 2). The curated information is organized into several search patterns, and proper navigation pages have been provided. The curated information from the IMEx has been processed further according to gene IDs, organism name, and the SSRs were sorted according to the coding or non-coding regions. The position of the coding regions has been determined using the annotated ptt files of each chloroplast and mitochondrial genome as downloaded from the NCBI Refseq database. How to browse: schematic browsing of ChloroMitoSSRDB. This figure appears in colour in the online version of DNA Research.How to browse: schematic browsing of ChloroMitoSSRDB. This figure appears in colour in the online version of DNA Research.ChloroMitoSSRDB interface provides information on several repeat statistics, including the distribution of the repeat types, length of the motifs and their positions (coding or non-coding repeats). The querying of ChloroMitoSSRDB through the web interface is organized into three search patterns that accomplish all interface functionalities: query page, result page and report page: (i) the first search pattern is according to the organelle classification and it has been classified into chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes, (ii) the second search pattern has been classified according to the type of repeat pattern (perfect or imperfect) and (iii). the last search pattern allows the user to select the repeat size. With the appropriate selection pattern, the user will be directed to the organelle-specific page (chloroplast and mitochondrial) containing the list of the organism for which the SSRs have been identified, which are further linked to the organism-specific repeat pages for further information on the distribution of the repetitive tracts.To ease the access of the database and to enhance the user functionality, we also provide chloroplast and mitochondrial repeat-specific pages alphabetically ordered according to the organism name. An advanced search option has been provided to filter the repeats based on the user-specific criteria allowing the user to search for a repeat region of a specific length. An option to export the search results and the repeat information in excel format has been provided, so that the user can save and analyse the repeats, design primers and can utilize the information for further downstream processing of the observed repeats.A query page for every organism is directed to a ChloroMitoSSRDB repeat summary page for organism-specific summary page that gives a detailed illustration of the distribution of the perfect and the imperfect repeats distribution and the genome composition using bar and pie charts. The genome composition and the repeat occurrence graphs were generated dynamically based on the repeat information using Libchart, a PHP chart drawing library (http://naku.dohcrew.com/libchart/). The repeat pattern summary displayed on the organism specific page are clickable links, which redirects and give further information on the start and end of the SSR repeat containing tract, Motif and the occurrence of the respective repeat pattern across the genomes.Mutations in the SSR stretches prevailing in the coding region may affect the subsequent transcription and translation of the gene harbouring the repetitive stretches of SSRs.22 Mutations in chloroplast SSRs (mutation rates at cpSSR loci as between 3.2 × 10-5 and 7.9 × 10-5) have been described as low when compared with substitution rates.23 Recently, it was observed that the plant mitochondrial substitution rates are relatively lower when compared with the invertebrates and mammalian mitochondrial genomes.24,25 To evaluate the distribution of the SSRs in the coding regions, the repeat-rich regions on the organism page have been linked to the corresponding protein IDs (NCBI, www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), in case of coding repeats, which can shed light on the evolution of these repeated regions either through mutational bias or through selective forces in further ongoing work.4. ConclusionWe have consecutively constructed a database ChloroMitoSSRDB that displays curated information of wide spread occurrences of genomic repeats in chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes available so far, and we will be constantly updating ChloroMitoSSRDB with the new chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes as and when they are released. The repeats in the coding regions of the genes may prove to be candidate markers to study the functional role of repeats associated with the genes, as possible markers for species delimitation, evolutionary analyses and also for evaluating the germplasm and to hypothesize conservation strategies for endangered species. In future release, we will make efforts to upgrade the primer pair information for the repeat-rich regions and will also upgrade the database with the systematic visualization of imperfect alignments through the availability of hyperlinked pages in case of imperfect repeats. We believe that ChloroMitoSSRDB will serve as a standard database for exploring and understanding genomic repeats in organelle genomes, and the data represented in ChloroMitoSSRDB make a good starting point for further exploratory investigations on SSR polymorphism, large comparative genome comparison and provide a platform to understand the repetitive nature of organelle genomes.FundingThis work was supported by BIOMASFOR (Z0912003I, Italy) and EC FP7 (BIOSUPPORT, Bulgaria).

IntroductionGenome composition (such as GC- and AT-content) and subsequent balance of codon usage and eukaryotic translation machinery play an important role in the evolution of the nucleotides at the wobble position.1 Degeneracy in biased codon usage explains the concept behind the usage of same amino acids with multiple synonymous codons except methionine (Met) and tryptophan (Trp).2 This genome composition bias leads to the usage of some codons at a higher frequency as compared to the synonymous codons for encoding the particular amino acid. These differences in the usage of the synonymous codons have also been one of the factors for the evolution of proteome diversity and can help us to understand the evolution of those proteins that have structural differences in spite of being conserved at the sequence level.3–7Two major paradigms of codon usage were proposed as plausible answers to clarify the non-randomness of codon usage at intra- and inter-species levels: (i) natural selection that is expected to yield a correlation with codon bias in highly expressed genes,8 rapidly regulated and variably expressed genes, and (ii) neutral processes, such as mutational biases (MBs), where some mutations occur more often than others across the genome of an organism because of local variations in the base composition. Several lines of evidence support the argument that the usage of synonymous codons with unequal frequencies in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic genes is the result of a complex balance between MB and/or natural selection and genetic drift.9–12 It has been suggested that the codon bias could be positively selected because of a more efficient and accurate translation, and favoured codons may correspond to the most highly expressed genes.2,13 In addition to neutral and selection processes, GC-biased gene conversion, which depends on the local recombination rate, is an important factor in shaping codon and amino acid usage.14To date, wide variations have been observed in codon usage patterns in many organisms and have provided clues to understand the evolution of genes and gene families. The factors that potentially affect biased usage of codons are MB that correlates the codon usage bias (CUB) with the genomic GC content, Hill-Robertson effect explaining the interference of selection of one locus with another locus, translational selection, and a cumulative effect of replication and translational selection in shaping the codon usage across the genes of several bacterial species.15–19 It has been shown that CUB and protein functional conservation play a major role for the decelerated evolution of whole genome duplication in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.20 Several other factors that might affect the codon usage are amino acid conservation and hydrophobicity,21 gene expression,22 mRNA folding stability, codon-anticodon interaction, and gene length.22Citrus is a diploid genus of the Rutaceae family, whose cultivated forms are important for human diet with more than 122 MT of annual world fruit production. We have systematically analysed codon usage patterns and genomic heterogeneity using a meta-analyses approach that involves multivariate tools and codon usage indices such as relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) and effective number of codons (Nc) in the studied gene sets.23,24 In present study, we inferred global pattern of CUB, mutational pressures, and association of GC3 with potential stress events. We have collectively analysed horticulturally important Citrus species that includes recently sequenced double haploid Citrus sinensis genome25 and 18 additional Citrus species with expressed sequence tags (ESTs) counts of more than 1000 per species. To make this analysis comparative, we have also included Poncirus trifoliata that is considered to be a distant relative of Citrus genus. These species show wide variation in traits such as cold and drought tolerance and are of commercial importance. We have restricted our analyses to Citrus genera to develop resource information for Citrus species.Our study demonstrated that CUB in Citrus species and P. trifoliata is biased towards AT richness, and a relatively higher occurrence of A- and T-ending codons was observed. We found several interesting and diverse patterns of optimal codons, and it was observed that two optimal codons coding for Alanine and Glycine were evolutionary conserved between the Citrus species and P. trifoliata. To the best of our knowledge, our analysis presents the first complete report on the identification of optimal codons across the entire Citrus genus and P. trifoliata, which could serve as the potential source for developing transgenic Citrus cultivars using codon optimization. GC3 and evolution were correlated using Hamming distance parameter to identify suggestive evolutionary pairs of genes. Co-orthologous genes matrix identified using the alignment ratio suggested close association of Citrus clementina, Citrus sinensis, and Citrus reticulata, as they belong to the same phylogenetic clade. We further demonstrated that nucleotide bias has a genome-wide influence on amino acid composition of Citrus species and P. trifoliata.2. Materials and methodology2.1. Sequence information and processingOur dataset consists of genome-predicted coding regions and ESTs. All the genome-predicted coding sequences of C. sinensis were retrieved from recently sequenced Citrus genome.25 In case of other Citrus species, ESTs were downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) EST repository (NCBI; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). In addition, we downloaded putative unique transcripts for all studied species from the PlantGDB database (http://www.plantgdb.org). A detailed description of the data used is shown in Table 1. In case of ESTs, the ESTs were first clustered into contigs and singletons using CAP3 with default parameters.26 A minimum match percentage cutoff of 95% for 40 overlapping bases was used to assign 2 sequences to a cluster. Genomic composition of coding region of Citrus species and P. trifoliata at GC, GC1, GC2, GC3, and GC3sMeans of GC% were calculated at the first, second, and third positions. GC3s represents the GC at the third synonymous position.aIn C. sinensis, genome-predicted coding regions are used, whereas for the rest of the species, the number represents the EST count in the column (genes/EST).bSelected genes above 300 bp threshold.Genomic composition of coding region of Citrus species and P. trifoliata at GC, GC1, GC2, GC3, and GC3sMeans of GC% were calculated at the first, second, and third positions. GC3s represents the GC at the third synonymous position.aIn C. sinensis, genome-predicted coding regions are used, whereas for the rest of the species, the number represents the EST count in the column (genes/EST).bSelected genes above 300 bp threshold.2.2. Frame correction of ESTsAll the UniGenes (contigs + singletons) were analysed for frame correction and prediction of protein-coding region using FrameDP.27,28 Briefly, the following pipeline was implemented using FrameDP to identify open reading frames (ORFs): firstly, each EST was compared against the TAIR database (Arabidopsis Information Resource; http://www.arabidopsis.org/) using BLASTX29 with E-value = 10-4, identity percent (%) = 40% over 100 amino acids.27 Secondly, the training dataset was generated from the BLASTX results, and, subsequently, the training matrix was calculated, which represents the coding style of the species. Thirdly, a collection of putative protein-coding sequences (CDSs) was generated for each Citrus species and P. trifoliata based on its homology with known protein dataset and on coding style recognition matrix.2.3. Sequence filtering and GC variationFrom the set of corrected sequences, we discarded proteins shorter than 100 amino acids to create a reliable dataset for all the studied Citrus species and P. trifoliata for further analysis.23 The final sequence dataset was subsequently analysed by tabulating the frequency of GC at the first, second, and third codon positions (GC1, GC2, GC3, and GC3s, respectively) using in-house written Perl and C++ scripts. GC3 is defined as the fraction of cytosines (C) and guanines (G) in the third position of the codon: GC3 = 3(C3 + G3)/L for the ORF of length L, whereas GC3S is defined as G + C base composition at the third synonymously degenerate position of codons. To define GC3-rich and GC3-poor groups, we have selected 5% of the genes with the highest and the lowest GC3 values. For the genes in the GC3-rich and-poor groups, we have computed two measures: (i) positional gradients of GC3 and (ii) CG3 skew that are defined as: CG3 skew is the difference in fraction of cytosines (C) and guanines (G) in the third position of the codon divided by the sum of C and G in the third position: CG3-skew = (C3-G3)/(C3 + G3) and positional gradient GC3 as a [G3 (x) + C3 (x)]/Nseq, where x is the distance measured as number of codons from the first ATG, and Nseq is the number of sequences.2.4. Indices of codon usage and correspondence analysisWe have further analysed RSCU using multivariate analysis for all the 59 informative codons (excluding Met, Trp, and the three stop codons).30,31 As proposed earlier, if RSCU values are close to 1.0, it indicates that all the synonymous codons are used equally without any bias towards the usage of a particular codon in a gene of length L. In our study, axis 1 (COA/RSCU) and axis 2 (COA/RSCU) represent the first and second major axes of correspondence analysis. The Kyte–Doolittle scale was used to calculate the hydropathy score that is the arithmetic mean of the sum of hydropathic indices of each amino acid. This scale also provides information on transmembrane or surface regions.322.5. Identification of optimal codonsOptimal codons are believed to achieve faster translation rates and high accuracy, therefore the effect is more pronounced in highly expressed genes.33 For the identification of optimal codons, we used 10% of total genes from extreme ends of the principal axis of correspondence analysis (axis 1; COA/RSCU). Codon usage was then compared using <U+03C7>2 contingency (<U+03C7>2) of the two groups, and codons whose frequency of usage was significantly higher at three different levels of statistical precision (P-value < 0.5; P-value < 0.01; P-value < 0.001) in highly expressed genes when compared with lowly expressed genes were defined as the optimal codons. We also identified the genes related to the ribosomal proteins and observed the association of the ribosomal proteins with axis 1 (COA/RSCU) and axis 2 (COA/RSCU) of the correspondence analysis to optimize the identification of the optimal codons.2.6. GO and stress-associated annotation, Hamming parameter, and coevolution of amino acid compositionStress-related genes were identified using reciprocal best bidirectional hits (RBH) using NCBI BLASTP program with E-value 10-30, and gene ontology (GO) annotation of the model dicot plant Arabidopsis thaliana was then used by ‘guilt-by-association’ approach. To optimize our annotation pipeline, we selected GO annotations ‘involved in’ the category containing word ‘stress’ and/or ‘response’ and grouped together as ‘stress related’. The normalized Hamming distance was then evaluated according to the method described in Sablok et al.34 All the frame-corrected coding regions and the genome-predicted coding regions were parsed. Subsequent proteins were used to identify co-orthologous genes, and a suggestive phylogeny was drawn using the co-orthologous matrix as described in Lechner et al.35 To identify the effect of nucleotide bias on amino acid composition, we partitioned the codons according to GC-rich (the so-called GARP amino acids: Glycine, Alanine, Arginine, and Proline) and AT-rich, FYMINK amino acids (Phenylalanine, Tyrosine, Methionine, Isoleucine, Asparagine, and Lysine) amino acids.36,37 We have maintained the exclusion of Leucine and Arginine from the dataset as per Singer and Hickey.372.7. Statistical analysisAll the indices of codon usage were calculated using CodonW (http://codonw.sourceforge.net), and several in-house developed Perl, R, and C++ scripts were written to streamline the downstream analyses. Statistical analyses were performed using R in R studio (http://rstudio.org/). All the results were interpreted based on the non-parametric Spearman's rank correlation (<U+03C1>).3. Results and discussion3.1. Patterns of genomic content and codon usage variation across Citrus species and P. trifoliataThe recently sequenced nuclear genome of C. sinensis25 presents an opportunity to analyse the nucleotide compositional pressure and heterogenetic variation, which could possibly help us to understand the molecular adaptation of these horticulturally important fruit species. We have used meta-analyses approach using the predicted genomic coding regions of recently sequenced C. sinensis and frame-corrected ESTs of related species and P. trifoliata. Nucleotide composition analysis indicated that Citrus species are AT rich (~46% GC, typical for many sequenced genomes of dicot species), and this bias towards the AT richness is dominant and is observed across all the studied species (Table 1).Based on the above observation, we could hypothesize that these species are biased towards the A- and/or T-ending codons in the coding region across these two genera. Generally, most of the analysed dicot species prefer to use A- or T-ending codons at the third position; this observation is in accordance with a previous study in Citrus using a small dataset of 177 CDS regions.38 We found that average GC3 is significantly lower than GC1 and the observed GC (P-value < 0.05) which potentially explains that the genome composition is biased towards the dominating AT usage encoding genes at the third, ‘wobble’ position.In eukaryotes, the intra-genomic heterogeneity is high, and interspecific variation of the average GC content is low.39,40 In Citrus species, GC usage varies by position, but with much greater variance, with higher usage in position 1 (~51.8% GC) and lower GC usage in positions 2 and 3 (~41.6 versus ~44.7% and also at the third synonymous positions GC3s ~ 42.8%). The observed results are consistent with the previous reports demonstrating preference for G is in position 1 and T/A in positions 2 and 341 and demonstrate the role of mutational pressure in the evolution of CUB across Citrus species and P. trifoliata. Furthermore, there is a significant wide variation in GC usage at the third synonymous position (GC3s ~42.8%) (Table 1; Fig. 1). In our analysis, we estimated codon usage patterns of frame-corrected coding regions obtained from ESTs versus gene predictions derived from a fully assembled and annotated genome. The distribution of GC3 content in Citrus species, P. trifoliata and A. thaliana genes. The GC3 content showed unimodal distribution.The distribution of GC3 content in Citrus species, P. trifoliata and A. thaliana genes. The GC3 content showed unimodal distribution.To look for biased association between the nucleotide content and codon usage, we plotted Nc against GC3s, also described as the Nc plot (Fig. 2) that has been widely demonstrated as an important parameter to evaluate codon usage variation among genes, as this codon usage index has a definite relationship with the GC3 (more compositionally biased DNA is expected to encode a smaller subset of codons).23,42 Wright23 argued that the comparison of actual distribution of genes, with expected distribution under no selection could be indicative, if CUB of genes has some other influences other than compositional constraints. A significant correlation was found between Nc and GC3s (0.466** C. sinensis; -0.025** Citrus aurantifolia; 0.070** Citrus aurantium; 0.125** C. clementina; 0.183** C. clementina × Citrus tangerina; 0.184** Citrus jambhiri; 0.179** Citrus japonica var. margarita; -0.048** Citrus limettioides; -0.031** Citrus limonia; 0.093** Citrus medica; 0.216** Citrus reshni; 0.061** C. reticulata; 0.101** C. reticulata × Citrus temple; 0.119** C. sinensis × P. trifoliata; -0.213** Citrus sunki; 0.061** P. trifoliata; 0.139** Citrus unshiu; 0.160** Citrus paradisi; 0.212** C. paradisi × P. trifoliata; **P-value < 0.01).

However, there might be additional factors that might influence codon usage across these species. This dependence of codon usage on genome base composition (AT- or GC-richness) has been previously reported in several unicellular genomes.43,44 In a genome-wide analysis of eubacterial and archeal genomes, it has been suggested that genome-wide variance in codon usage is primarily due to MB as the GC content shows wide variation along the isochors.17 Simultaneously, alternative views associate GC variability with various factors such as transcriptional optimization, methylation, recombination, and horizontal gene transfer.45 It can be inferred that the cloning of orthologs and homologues conserved across the Citrus species and P. trifoliata that are AT rich and have low Nc values will require few degenerate primers. On the contrary, genes that are GC rich and having high GC values will require more degenerate primers for enhancement of cloning efficiency.3.2. Correspondence analysisIt has been reported that there is a significant heterogeneity within the genes and genomes.33,46 A heat map was constructed using the observed RSCU values for all the 59 informative codons (excluding the Met, Trp, and the stop codons) using the average linkage clustering method (Fig. 3). Heat map and the supporting values (Supplementary Table 1) clearly define that the global codon usage is biased towards AT richness. We have partitioned the genes based on the high and low GC3s content to see the global pattern of deviation across the two principal axes displaying the major variation in accordance with the synonymous GC3s (Supplementary Fig. 1).

High significant correlation (+/-) was also observed between axis 1 and GC3s (0.860**, C. sinensis; 0.888**, C. aurantifolia; 0.887**, C. aurantium; 0.903**, -0.708** C. clementina; -0.836**, C. clementina × C. tangrina; -0.772**, C. jambhiri; -0.831**, C. japonica var. margarita; -0.803**, C. limettioides; 0.849**, C. limonia; 0.894**, C. medica; -0.855**, C. reshni; 0.894**, C. reticulata; 0.846**, C. reticulata × C. temple; -0.884**, C. sinensis × P. trifoliata; 0.806**, C. sunki; 0.879**, P. trifoliata; 0.834**, C. unshiu; -0.848**, C. paradisi; -0.879**, C. paradisi × P. trifoliata; **P-value < 0.01). The observed results indicate dominance of MB in the Citrus species and P. trifoliata and suggest that the variation in the usage of synonymous codons among the genes in Citrus species and P. trifoliata is largely a biased representation of nucleotide content of the genes.3.3. Identification of optimal codons in Citrus species and P. trifoliataEarlier and recent reports suggest that the usage of optimal codons and balanced codon usage enhances the efficiency of translation by increasing the translation rate of the preferred codons over the other synonymous codon choices.47,48 Genes using optimal codons have higher translation rate as compared to genes using non-optimal codons, which in turn increases the ribosome usage efficiency and potentially reduces the ribosome drop off.22,49,50 ESTs constitute partial transcriptome representation correlated with gene abundance and expression.51,52 In 14 Citrus species (C. aurantifolia; C. aurantium; C. clementina; C. jambhiri; C. limettioides; C. limonia; C. medica; C. reshni; C. reticulata; C. reticulata × C. temple; C. sinensis × P. trifoliata; C. unshiu; C. paradisi; C. paradisi × P. trifoliata) and P. trifoliata, we extracted the expression of ESTs count using the CAP3 assembly (.ace files) and compared the usage of codons in accordance with earlier reports.53–55 We also selected the ribosomal protein-encoding genes and quantified the association of the ribosomal encoding genes with axis 1 (COA/RSCU) and axis 2 (COA/RSCU) of correspondence analysis.A star map showing optimal codons was constructed taking 10% of the genes from the extreme tails of multivariate analysis (Table 2), and several distinct trends of optimal codons were detected. In an earlier study,38 optimal codons in Citrus were estimated based on the correspondence analysis of codon usage, and the relative frequency of synonymous codon using 177 CDS and A- or T-ending optimal codons (TAA, GCT, GAT, CTT, AGG, AGA, and GTT) was observed. Overall, we observed that the trend of optimal codons usage was not conserved across all analysed species. However, in our analyses, we have observed that GCT (~1.57; RSCU) and GGT (~1.09; RSCU) representing Alanine and Glycine were found to be evolutionary conserved across all the species. Because both these optimal codons are T-ending codons, which is an indication of the dominant role of the MB in the conservation of the A- or T-ending codons, it potentially represents the biased genome composition. However, for the other observed optimal codons, pattern genomic composition was not able to explain the deviation. We further observed that for most amino acids with 2- to 6-fold degeneracy level, there has been a general preference for the usage of two or more codons as optimal codons. For example, in Glycine, two highly distributed optimal codons GGA and GGT were identified and they could be classified as the primary and secondary optimal codons preferentially based on the RSCU (GGA, ~1.16 and GGT, ~1.09). A curious trend observed among the Citrus species and P. trifoliata is that Leucine is frequently encoded optimally by a G-ending codon (TTG; ~RSCU: 1.49) in four species (C. sinensis, C. clementina, C. reticulata, and P. trifoliata) rather than synonymous A- or T-ending codon. However, in other species, CTT (~RSCU: 1.49) and CTC (~RSCU: 0.89) (TTA, RSCU: 1.16; CTT RSCU: 1.51) were the optimal codons.

AA represents amino acid.We found deviations in the usage of optimal codons encoding Lysine. For example, Lysine is frequently encoded by AAA (~RSCU: 0.98) as optimal codon in three species (C. sinensis, C. reticulata, and P. trifoliata), whereas AAG (~RSCU: 1.01) was found to be the optimal codon for Lysine in rest of the Citrus species. In Arginine, we observed that in two species (C. aurantifolia and C. paradisi × P. trifoliata), AGG represents the potential optimal codon instead of the synonymous AGA. But based on the RSCU values, AGA (~RSCU: 1.66) was assumed to be more dominant over the AGG codon (~RSCU: 1.52) at the respective levels of significance P-value < 0.01 and P-value < 0.05. Using a mutation and selection model, Knight et al.56 demonstrated that ‘pairs of species with convergent GC content might also evolve convergent protein sequences, especially at functionally unconstrained positions’. For instance, the frequencies of both Lysine and Arginine are highly anti-correlated with GC content, and Lysine and Arginine can easily be substituted for one another in proteins. This observation explains the inclusion of Lysine and Arginine in our study and is well supported by an earlier study in nematodes.57 It has been proposed that Arginine and Leucine have a tendency to show different codon usage patterns because of the prevalence of the synonymous GC substitutions in the first and the third codon position.58 Recently, it has been postulated that codon optimization significantly enhanced MIR gene expression in Solanum lycopersicum cv. Microtom,59 which potentially depicts the importance and the usage of the optimal codons in gene expression and transgenics. To our knowledge, this is the first time large-scale identification of optimal codons in Citrus species and P. trifoliata, which could serve as a model repertoire to enhance the transformation efficiency.3.4. Role of other selective constraints on codon bias in Citrus species and P. trifoliataA recent study has revealed that MB deeply influences the folding stability of proteins, making proteins on the average less hydrophobic and, therefore, less stable with respect to unfolding and also less susceptible to misfolding and aggregation.60 To identify the potential effects of Gravy and aromaticity, we computed non-parametric correlation coefficients between axis 1 (COA/RSCU) and Gravy or aromaticity scores for all studied species. We observed that Gravy and aromaticity played a minor role in shaping the variation of codon usage across Citrus species and P. trifoliata. In the case of P. trifoliata, no significant correlation was observed for aromaticity, suggesting that aromaticity has no significant role in shaping the codon usage variation in this genus.3.5. Variations in GC3 across Citrus species and P. trifoliataRecent reports suggest that GC3 composition and GC gradient are acting as major factors along the orientation of transcription in monocots. It has been also suggested that GC composition is vital for understanding chromatin remodelling, gene expression, and recombination.45,61 Some studies failed to depict GC gradient along the genes of dicot plants using A. thaliana as a model.61 The reason for this failure is that high and low GC3 genes have opposite gradients along the genes, and when high and low GC3 genes are clumped together, the effect disappears. In Citrus species and P. trifoliata, unimodal bell-shaped distribution of GC3, centred at 0.39, is considered to be a typical mode of GC3 distribution for dicot species. We selected the top and bottom 5% of genes across each studied Citrus species and P. trifoliata, and strikingly distinct gradients of GC3 and CG3 skew for high and low GC3 genes were revealed. Genes with high GC3 showed higher level of GC3 codons in their middle coding regions than in terminal coding regions. In addition, high GC3 genes have a preference for C over G in the middle coding regions, and this preference was not found in the 3'-coding end ~100 bp in size (Fig. 4; Supplementary Fig. 2).

For all genomes, GC3-rich genes become more GC3 rich towards the middle of the CDS.GC3 gradient across Citrus species and P. trifoliata.

These plots show gradients of GC3 for 5% of GC3-rich and GC3-poor genes for all analysed genomes. Gradients from 5' and 3' ends of the CDS are shown in the same plot, separated by a vertical line. For all genomes, GC3-rich genes become more GC3 rich towards the middle of the CDS.It was previously reported that stress-related genes in grasses are GC3-rich.45 We stratified all Citrus species and P. trifoliata genes into three groups by GC3: rich (top 5%), poor (bottom 5%), and medium (middle 90%). We observed that among the four major economically important Citrus species, in C. reticulata (1718), C. clementina (1522), and P. trifoliata (951), most of the GC3-rich genes were related to stress in comparison to the total number of observed stress-related genes, but in the case of C. sinensis, it was observed that a high number of medium GC3 genes (1857) were also abundant in stress-related genes. The relative abundance of the medium GC3 genes in C. sinensis may be due to the time-course adaptability of this species during the period of evolution, suggesting an adaptive evolution towards the stress.A high abundance of stress-related genes in C. reticulata and P. trifoliata may be closely related to their high stress-tolerance trait and especially to P. trifoliata that has the highest cold-resistant character among Citrus species and its wild relatives. The occurrence of the high GC3 genes in all these species suggests an association between DNA methylation and GC3 as it has been previously suggested that high GC3 composition has been influenced by the GC mismatch-repair mechanism that is dominant in stress-associated genes as the absence of this positive bias may lead to the loss of the recombination repair mechanism and could be detrimental to the plant adaptation in the evolving stress conditions. Genomic regions under higher selective pressure are more frequently recombining, and as a result relative increase in GC3 content can be observed.45 As shown in Supplementary Table 2 and Fig. 5, in all Citrus species and P. trifoliata, the ratio of stress to non-stress-related genes in GC3-rich group was elevated in comparison to the GC3-medium group and depleted in the GC3-poor group. It is worth noting that GC3-poor group has fewer genes functionally described as stress-related when compared with the GC3-rich group. Distribution of stress-related genes in Citrus species and P. trifoliata according to the GO of Arabidopsis.Distribution of stress-related genes in Citrus species and P. trifoliata according to the GO of Arabidopsis.In all the studied species, GC3-rich and -poor genes have different trends from 5' to 3' end of the genes. GC3-rich genes become even more GC3 rich, and GC3-poor genes become more GC3 poor. Firstly, the GC3-rich group has more stress related genes than the GC3-poor group. Secondly, the GC3-rich group has a positive gradient of GC3 from 5' and 3' flanks to the middle portion of the CDS. The low-GC3 group has a negative gradient of GC3 from 5' and 3' flanks to the middle portion of the CDS. Thirdly, rich- and poor-GC3 groups showed different CG3 skew trends along the CDS: GC3-rich genes favour C3 over G3, and this preference is most pronounced in first 150 codons, whereas GC3-poor genes favour G3 over C3 (Supplementary Fig. 2). It was suggested that transcriptional and translational optimization of stress-related and tissue-specific genes is the major force responsible for maintaining high GC3 content.46 The replacement of the AT pair with the GC pair at the third codon position enhances the transcriptional activity that in turn enhances the array of ribosomal-binding proteins. Stayssman et al.62 provide a strong positive correlation between the methylation of internal unmethylated regions and expression of the host gene and postulated that the genes with high GC3 provide more targets for methylation. Genes involved in response to various stresses need to produce a protein with a faster rate as a response to external stimulus. This results in shortened length of transcript and preference for G and C (and especially, C) in the third position of the codon (to avoid abortive transcription and ribosome congestion). In addition, high GC3 genes have more methylation targets that allow for fine-tuning of transcriptional regulation.583.6. Evolution and coevolution of nucleotide and amino acid compositionWe analysed the relationship between amino acid sequence divergence and variation in GC3, to test the effect of evolutionary divergence on codon usage. We observed that there is an overall positive correlation (0.43) between relative change in GC3 and normalized Hamming distance (Fig. 6). This was expected because more diverse amino acid sequences are likely to have more diverse nucleotide sequences. The trend is not uniform: for the genes with GC3 in the range between 0.5 and 0.6, the correlation is 0.596 and it drops to 0.32 for GC3 above 0.8 or below 0.4. There are some pairs of organisms that have negative correlation between GC3 and Hamming distance (C. jambhiri: C. limettioides, C. limonia: C. sinensis × P. trifoliata, C. aurantiifolia: C. jambhiri, C. jambhiri: C. paradisi, C. aurantiifolia: C. paradisi, C. jambhiri: P. trifoliata, C. medica:C. sinensis × P. trifoliata, C. jambhiri: C. unshiu, C. jambhiri: C. reshni, C. japonica var. margarita: C. paradisi, C. aurantiifolia: C. clementina × C. tangerina, C. aurantium: C. jambhiri, C. clementina × C. tangerina: C. jambhiri). Note that in the list of negative correlations, C. jambhiri occurs eight times. Hamming distance versus change in GC3 visualization across Citrus species and P. trifoliata. Relative difference GC3 composition between genes A and B, defined as GC3 (A)-GC3 (B)/[GC3 (A) + GC3 (B)] is positively correlated with the Hamming distance between corresponding protein sequences, calculated as 1–[I (AB) + I (BA)]/[I (AA) + I (BB)], where I (AB) is the number of identities in alignment of protein A to protein B. The resulting Hamming distance was rounded to 1 DP, and an average difference in GC3 was computed for each category.Hamming distance versus change in GC3 visualization across Citrus species and P. trifoliata. Relative difference GC3 composition between genes A and B, defined as GC3 (A)-GC3 (B)/[GC3 (A) + GC3 (B)] is positively correlated with the Hamming distance between corresponding protein sequences, calculated as 1–[I (AB) + I (BA)]/[I (AA) + I (BB)], where I (AB) is the number of identities in alignment of protein A to protein B. The resulting Hamming distance was rounded to 1 DP, and an average difference in GC3 was computed for each category.Genes that have low GC3 content in C. jambhiri (<0.4) tend to have negative correlation between difference in GC3 and Hamming distance, and genes with high GC3 content (>0.6) are slightly positively correlated. This atypical behaviour can be explained by larger evolutionary distance between C. jambhiri and other species analysed in the present investigation. The highest correlation was observed between C. japonica var. margarita and C. limonia (<U+03C1> = 0.86, number of orthologous pairs N = 12, t-statistics t = 5.22, P-value = 0.0002). C. japonica var. margarita and C. limonia are evolutionary distant, and the number of orthologous pairs is only N = 12. Hence, a high value of correlation coefficient may be a result of an evolutionary pressure to conserve codon usage for a selected subset of conserved proteins. We observed that pairs of species having positive correlation between GC3 and Hamming distance are enriched in translation, transport, proteolysis, photorespiration, and genes involved in photosynthesis; pairs of species with negative correlation are enriched in stress-response genes.Similar patterns of hierarchal clustering were depicted; when we clustered the species based on co-orthologous genes using genome-predicted and frame-corrected reconstructed proteins of the Citrus species and P. trifoliata. The phylogenetic clades were rerooted using P. trifoliata as an outgroup, and it was observed that C. sinensis, C. clementina, and C. reticulata all belong to the same clade, which are in accordance with the previous reports using major intrinsic proteins (XIP subfamily of aquaporins) and further support the conserved homology between these two species.63 These supportive views suggest that the identified frame-corrected coding regions are trustworthy and accurate to be used for the predictions in the species, with no genome information available till now (Supplementary Fig. 3A and B).Because a nucleotide bias can lead to an overall bias in amino acid composition of proteins, it is possible that a genome with nucleotide bias may have introduced atypical amino acid substitutions in its proteome. Hence, AT-rich coding sequences would encode proteins rich in FYMINK amino acids (Phenylalanine, Tyrosine, Methionine, Isoleucine, Asparagine, and Lysine), whereas GC-rich coding sequences would produce proteins containing high levels of GARP amino acids (Glycine, Alanine, Arginine, and Proline). Because Citrus species and P. trifoliata are AT-rich, we found higher proportion of FYMINK [(FYMINK and CDSGC (y = 4.1431x + 22.341, R2 = 0.9099); GARP and CDSGC (y = 3.0687x + 45.414, R2 = 0.7803); P-value < 10-9)].Because the third synonymous position does not influence the protein sequence, we computed the correlation coefficient between the FYMINK and GARP parameters and the GC3. This correlation is an important factor in describing nucleotide bias at synonymous and non-synonymous sites. We observed a high significant correlation between nucleotide composition and amino acid composition at the third synonymous position [(FYMINK and CDSGC3 (y = 10.862x + 142.4, R2 = 0.9296); GARP and CDSGC3 (y = 9.842x + 212.15, R2 = 0.7495)], suggesting that nucleotide bias has an influence on amino acid composition in Citrus species and P. trifoliata.In summary, we found prevalence of A- or T-ending codons with an exception for Lysine and Arginine in P. trifoliata. We suggest that although the patterns of optimal codons were not conserved, two codons (GCT and GGT) were found to be conserved across all the Citrus species and P. trifoliata. We analysed GC3-rich and -poor genes and their association with stress, and our results provided novel insights into stress evolution of stress adaptation in Citrus species and P. trifoliata in accordance with the GC3 biology. This research is critical for all Citrus species, as it might facilitate understanding of genome dynamics and evolution in Citrus and P. trifoliata, transformation of interested target genes, designing multitargeting gene systems, and ultimately genetically improving these important fruit crops.Supplementary dataSupplementary Data are available atwww.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis research was financially supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (nos. 2011AA100205, 2011CB100606), the National NSF of China, and the Ministry of Agriculture of China (no. 200903044).The authors thank Dr Kenta Nakai (the handling editor) and the two anonymous reviewers for helpful and constructive comments and Dr Yuepeng Han, Wuhan Botanic Garden (CAS) for critical reading of the manuscript.

IntroductionTranscription factors (TFs), which bind to cis-regulatory sequences and either activate or repress gene expression, control many biological processes, such as development, growth, cell division and responses to environmental stimuli.1–6 The TFs form complex regulatory networks at the transcriptional level and through protein–protein interactions among themselves or with proteins of other classes such as RING E3 ligases for degradation or chromatin modifying proteins to recruit or block access of RNA polymerases to the DNA template.7–9 The specific interactions between TFs and consensus cis-motifs play a key role in the regulation of proteins to affect spatial and temporal gene expression.10 Proper characterization of particular TFs often requires study in the biological context of a whole family because functional redundancy is common within the families. Identification, characterization and annotation of TF repertoires from different plant species will provide an insight into TF organization and evolution as well as a basic foundation for comparative and functional genomics of the TFs.11,12 Additionally, from a biotechnology perspective, identification and functional analyses of TFs are especially important for improvement of plant performance and seed quality under adverse conditions.3,13Given the importance of TFs, in the last decade, the availability of complete plant genome sequences and the development of various software tools have enabled scientists to identify TF sets from various plant species and compile their basic information in a number of species-specific TF databases14 such as RARTF,15 DRTF,16 SoybeanTFDB,17 SoyDB18 and TOBFAC19 or integrative databases such as DATFAP,20 Grassius,21 PlnTFDB,22 LegumeTFDB,23 GramineaeTFDB24 and PlantTFDB.25 Among these databases, the SoybeanTFDB (http://soybeantfdb.psc.riken.jp/), LegumeTFDB (http://legumetfdb.psc.riken.jp/) and GramineaeTFDB (http://gramineaetfdb.psc.riken.jp) have been constructed by our group during the last three years with the focus on economically important legume and grass crops.26 The recent completion of the genome sequences of several important tree crops has enabled us to develop the TreeTFDB (http://treetfdb.bmep.riken.jp/index.pl) to accelerate biomass engineering researches for development of bioenergy resources through genetic engineering of TFs. TreeTFDB comprises the TF sets from six important tree crops, namely the jatropha (Jatropha curcas), papaya (Carica papaya), cassava (Manihot esculenta), poplar (Populus trichocarpa), castor bean (Ricinus communis) and grapevine (Vitis vinifera). Among these, the TF set of jatropha has not been reported by any other public databases because the genome sequence of jatropha has just been made available to public very recently.27 In addition to the basic information, such as sequence features, domain alignments and gene ontology (GO) assignment, TreeTFDB also provides information on available full-length cDNA (FL-cDNA), genomic distribution, multiple sequence alignment, gene expression data and the sequences and positions of all types of known cis-motifs found in the promoter regions.2. Materials and methods2.1. Identification of TF repertoires in six tree cropsThe bioinformatics approach established previously was used to identify the complete sets of TFs from the annotated proteomes of jatropha, papaya, cassava, poplar, castor bean and grapevine.17,28 A pre-defined threshold of E < 1e-5 was used as the common value cutoff for HMMER search using 61 built HMM profiles.17,29 The criteria described previously for the classification of each TF family were applied.30 The TFs identified by initial HMMER search were subsequently subjected to homology search (blastp E-value =1e-30) with known TFs of Arabidopsis and rice to confirm the HMMER search results based on the results of homology search as described previously.24 TFs for which the homology search yielded results of blastp E-value between 1e-30 and 1e-5 were inspected manually to exclude false-positive hits and determine the true E-value for each family (TreeTFDB Help page, Statistics).2.2. Structural and functional annotations of putative TFsStructural and functional annotations of putative TFs were done as described previously.17 All the similarity searches using blastn were performed with a threshold E-value < 1e-100 against available nucleotide sequence resources, such as clustered expressed sequence tags and target sequences of microarrays, and the top scoring hit for each query was applied and displayed in ‘Corresponding to other identifiers’. All similarity searches with blastp against protein datasets [National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) nr, Arabidopsis annotated proteins from TAIR10, UniProt, rice annotated proteins from Michigan State University rice genome annotation project] were performed with a threshold E-value < 1e-5 to find possible functional descriptions for TF-encoding genes and putative homologs among tree TFs in TreeTFDB. The top scoring hit for each query was applied. The TFs were assigned to possible GO terms based on a blastp similarity search (E-value < 1e-10) using the dataset of Arabidopsis of TAIR10 as previously described.24,312.3. FL-cDNA resources for TF-encoding genesHyperlinks linking putative TF-encoding genes of poplar and cassava to their respective FL-cDNA resources publicly available at http://rpop.psc.riken.jp/index.pl (RPOPDB: RIKEN Populus Database) and http://cassava.psc.riken.jp/ver.1/ (Cassava Online Archive) databases were built and supplied on TreeTFDB. FL-cDNA information was also used to verify the annotation of the poplar and cassava TF-encoding genes during the manual inspection.2.4. Promoter regions and discovery of cis-regulatory motifs in promoter regions of TF genesThe -500, -1000 and -3000 bp upstream sequences from the putative transcription start site (TSS) for each TF-encoding gene were extracted from the respective genomic sequence dataset of each tree crop. TSSs were defined as start site of ‘mRNA’ recorded in General Feature Format files that are provided on the Phytozome (http://www.phytozome.net/) and Kazusa (http://www.kazusa.or.jp/) databases. Discovery of cis-regulatory motifs located in these promoter regions using all the cis-motif sequences collected from the PLACE database (http://www.dna.affrc.go.jp/PLACE/)32 and 12 major stress- and/or hormone-responsive cis-motifs reported previously10,33 was done as described previously.17 The cis-element search results were implemented into the TreeTFDB as a searchable property. In addition, these search results were also incorporated as an annotation track of Generic Genome Browser (Gbrowse).342.5. Expression data for TF-encoding genesGene expression data of putative TF-encoding genes in poplar and grape were obtained based on correspondences between putative TF-encoding genes and GeneChip target sequences. Subsequently, the hyperlinks to PlexDB (http://www.plexdb.org/) and eFP browser (http://bar.utoronto.ca/efp_poplar/cgi-bin/efpWeb.cgi) for poplar TF-encoding genes and those to PlexDB for grapevine TF-encoding genes were built and supplied on TreeTFDB. In addition, gene expression patterns in castor bean obtained through analysis of RNA-sequencing transcriptomes35 were also compiled, and expression data available for corresponding TFs were extracted and supplied on TreeTFDB.2.6. Construction of a web-accessible databaseThe database is implemented in MySQL and the web interface of Perl CGI and Java script run on the Apache Web server. The definition strings used for sequence similarity searches for each database, the domain searches by InterProScan, cis-motif names from the PLACE database and the assigned GO terms were assembled as a keyword database, enabling users to specify queries on any keyword and to retrieve relevant information for genes from the TreeTFDB. A BLAST server was implemented to provide a similarity search interface for queried sequences using NCBI BLAST together with sequences of the six tree crops, as well as those from Arabidopsis. Gbrowse was also implemented in TreeTFDB to visualize the gene annotations of the putative TF-encoding genes together with cis-motifs found on the upstream sequence of the TF genes. The cross-references of corresponding data for each of the entries were also implemented into the TreeTFDB together with the URLs for each of the original referenced data to provide hyperlinks on the web interface with seamless navigations.3. Results and discussion3.1. Identification of putative TFs in jatropha, papaya, cassava, poplar, castor bean and grapevineThe strategy and bioinformatics pipeline established previously for identification of the TF repertoire of soya bean were used to identify the complete sets of TFs from the annotated proteome of jatropha.17 To our knowledge, the TF set of jatropha has not been reported by any other databases. Although the TF repertoires of papaya, cassava, poplar, castor bean and grapevine are available in PlantTFDB,25 with the aim to make the comparative and functional genomics of the tree crop TFs convenient, we also used the same bioinformatics approach to identify the TF repertoires of these five tree crops. The sequence data of jatropha (JAT_r3.0) were downloaded from Kazusa DNA Research Institute (http://www.kazusa.or.jp/jatropha/), whereas for the papaya (Cpapaya_113), cassava (Cassava4.1 gene set, Mesculenta_147), poplar (JGI v2.2 gene annotation, Ptrichocarpa_156), castor bean (TIGR/JCVI release v0.1, Rcommunis_119) and grapevine (Genoscope 12X March 2010 release, Vvinifera_145), the release version of annotated proteome datasets was downloaded from Phytozome (v.7.0) (http://www.phytozome.net/). The results gained from the bioinformatics pipeline using a predefined threshold of E < 1e-5 were subsequently refined by combined automatic and manual inspections of the raw alignments to exclude false-positive hits and determine the true E-value for each TF family. A total of 1548, 1481, 2636, 3106, 1510 and 1492 TF models were identified in papaya, jatropha, cassava, poplar, castor bean and grapevine, respectively. As our pipeline is similar to the method used by PlnTFDB,36 among the TF repertoires of three tree species reported by both PlnTFDB and TreeTFDB, two species have difference in TF numbers with less than 5% (1483 and 2930 in PlnTFDB versus 1548 and 3106 in TreeTFDB for C. papaya and P. trichocarpa, respectively). As for the third tree species, V. vinifera, the difference is approximately 14% (1728 in PlnTFDB versus 1492 in TreeTFDB), which may be due to the use of different sequence versions for TF identification. PlnTFDB used Genoscope, release version 1.0, whereas we used the newest version from Phytozome.All the 6 TF sets were classified into 61 TF families based on the presence of their specific signature domains (Table 1). The number of predicted TFs in each family may be changed by future updating of sequence versions and/or fine-tuning of gene annotations. The identified TF sets of the six tree crops together with their basic features, such as Gbrowse to provide the genomic structure and position of each TF entry, gene and protein sequence information and domain alignments, were integrated into a database named TreeTFDB (http://treetfdb.bmep.riken.jp/index.pl) (Fig. 1). We will continue to update our database with new information, when it becomes available, to enhance the accuracy of TF prediction and annotation. Predicted TF models in six tree crop speciesPredicted TF models in six tree crop species(A) The top page of TreeTFDB displays TF families and number of TFs of each TF family identified in six tree crops: J. curcas, C. papaya, M. esculenta, P. trichocarpa, R. communis and V. vinifera.

Annotations of the tree crop TFsIn the next line of the study, extensive annotations at both gene and family levels were carried out to provide comprehensive information on the identified TFs of the six tree crops (for details, see the TreeTFDB Help page). A search for potential functions of the identified TFs of these tree crops by analysis of published papers on PubMed database has revealed that the majority of their TFs are functionally unknown. Thus, as a means to provide a knowledge base regarding their biological function, especially in stress responses and plant development, the putative functions of the identified TFs of the tree crops were assessed via comparative analyses with relevant GO annotations of Arabidopsis. All the assigned terms at the biological process level obtained from sequence similarity searches against Arabidopsis counterparts that have GO terms in TAIR10 were counted to grasp the overall representation of 11 broad categories (GO slim) in applied entries of crop TFs (Fig. 2). A substantial proportion of the analysed TFs were shown to be related to stresses and/or their stimuli as well as plant development (Fig. 2). These data indicate that regulation of stress-related biological processes can also be considered one of important events as for the functionality of the plant TFs. This GO-based functional annotation overall provides an insight into potential functions of identified TFs of these tree crops, supporting researchers in selection of TFs of interest for further studies.

This figure appears in colour in the online version of DNA Research.3.3. Promoter regions of the identified TFs and discovery of known cis-element(s) in these TF promoter regionsThe specific interactions between cis-regulatory sequences and a family of TFs play a central part in how genetic regulatory proteins affect spatial and temporal gene expression.4 Increasing evidence has suggested that the cis-motifs are highly conserved among plant species, and defined cis-elements can effectively aid in functional prediction of genes37–40 such as stress-responsive or hormone-responsive genes based on combinatory relationships of cis-motifs.38,41 In plants, extensive promoter analyses have identified a large number of cis-motifs that are known to be essential for transcriptional regulation of gene activities controlling various biological processes, including plant development, stress responses and hormone responses.10,32,33,41 To make the promoter analyses convenient for the geneticists and to facilitate the functional characterization and prediction of the TFs, especially the stress-related TFs, first we retrieved the -500, -1000 and -3000 promoter regions of all the TF genes (upstream from the TSSs) from the genomic sequences of the tree crops and provided these promoter sequences together with the TF gene and protein sequences on TreeTFDB for convenient downloading. Subsequently, these promoter regions were subjected to an extensive computational analysis to search for the existence of a total of 481 putative known cis-regulatory motifs, including 12 major abiotic stress- and/or hormone-responsive cis-motifs (Supplementary Table S1).10,32,33 Type, position and sequence of the cis-element(s) identified in each promoter region of each TF are provided on the detailed page of each TF gene under ‘cis-motif prediction’ keyword. Our database also provides the ‘cis-motif (stress responsive)’, ‘cis-motif (hormone responsive)’ and ‘cis-motif (PLACE)’ search functions that enable the users to search conveniently for all types of analysed cis-motifs in promoter region of any TF and/or search for those TFs that contain the cis-motif(s) of interest. In combination with GO annotations, these data remarkably facilitate the systematic functional predictions of the tree TFs. For instance, with the help of the TreeTFDB, users can use the ‘cis-motif (stress responsive)’ search function to identify TF genes harbouring known stress-responsive cis-motif(s) in their promoter regions. Next, they can screen the identified TFs using GO annotation provided for each TF on detailed annotation page (Fig. 3). Thus, we will be able to predict the putative stress-responsive TFs based on combinatory analyses of stress-responsive cis-motif(s) and the associated stress-responsive GO terms. Finally, expression profiling approach should be used to verify the predicted stress-responsive function prior to the launching of laborious in planta functional studies.

Expression patterns of TF-encoding genes from poplar, grapevine and castor beanGene expression data generated by high-throughput expression profiling experiments, such as microarray analysis, RNA-sequencing, are known to comprise one of the effective genomic resources for functional prediction. A combined analysis of gene expression, GO, cis-regulatory elements and coexpression neighbourhood will perfectly enable us to predict gene functions for unknown genes.42,43 For instance, positive correlation has been found between the existence of cis-regulatory motifs and tissue-specific and/or stress-responsive expression patterns by either in silico or genetic inspection.42 To make our database a comprehensive integrated database for functional characterization and selection of stress-responsive TFs, we have searched public resources for available expression datasets of the six tree crops with the aim to link the TF-encoding genes to their respective expression. Among the six tree crops, three species, namely poplar, grapevine and castor bean, were found to have large-scale expression datasets for further analyses. The datasets for poplar could be obtained from PlexDB and eFP browser websites while that for grapevine and castor bean from PlexDB and a RNA-sequencing project,35 respectively. Hyperlinks linking to PlexDB and eFP browser were then built and supplied on TreeTFDB to provide access to the expression profiles of those poplar and grapevine TF-encoding genes for which data are available. The available expression datasets available at PlexDB, which were obtained through microarray analyses, have enabled us to examine the expression patterns of a significant number of polar and grape TF-encoding genes in response to their pathogens and symbionts as well as abiotic stressors, such as drought, high salinity and high temperature. On the other hand, hyperlinks linking to eFP browser will allow the users to access expression profiles of many poplar TF-encoding genes in several organs, such as roots, leaves and catkins and light-grown or dark-grown seedlings. As for the TF-encoding genes in castor bean, their expression data obtained from analysis of RNA-seq transcriptomes of five tissues, namely endosperm at stages II/III (endosperm free-nuclear stage) and stages V/VI (onset of cellular endosperm development), expanding true leaves, germinating seeds (cotyledon) and developing male flowers are provided in the detailed page of TreeTFDB. Those TF-encoding genes of poplar, grapevine and castor bean, for which expression data are available, are indicated by [Expression] string below the gene ID (Fig. 1B).3.5. Web interface of TreeTFDBAll the data obtained through this study were integrated to create TreeTFDB (http://treetfdb.bmep.riken.jp/index.pl) with the aim to provide a convenient environment for comparative and functional genomics of the tree crop TFs at both individual and family levels. The web-based user interface of TreeTFDB is illustrated in Fig. 1. The first page of TreeTFDB provides general information about TreeTFDB along with ‘TF search’, ‘Similarity search’, ‘Genome browser’, ‘Download’, ‘Help’ and ‘Quick search’ functions (Fig. 1A). The TF search interface for each species provides 7 types of search queries for names of TF families, keywords, gene identifiers, identifiers of domains supported by InterProScan, GO terms and all available cis-motifs documented in the PLACE database (http://www.dna.affrc.go.jp/PLACE/) as well as 12 known abiotic stress- and/or hormone-responsive cis-motifs published previously10,33 (for details, see the TreeTFDB Help page). By clicking on a species and then a TF family of interest, such as poplar and NAM-no apical meristem, ATAF-Arabidopsis transcription activation factor and CUC-cup-shaped cotyledon TF family, users will be navigated to the page listing all the identified members of the TF family (Fig. 1B). Users can then click on a gene ID and conveniently access the detailed information on gene annotations, including gene structure, cDNA and protein sequences, domain structure predicted by InterProScan, domain alignments, promoter regions, predicted cis-regulatory motifs in -500, -1000 and -3000 bp promoter regions of the TF gene as well as clusters of homologous proteins within families and GO terms derived from GO annotation using comparative analysis with their Arabidopsis counterparts (Fig. 3). Additionally, the data supplied are available not only for viewing through the web interface but also for immediate downloading via the ‘Download’ search key (Fig. 1A). In terms of similarity (blastp) with TFs from trees or non-tree plants, such as Arabidopsis, maize and rice, TreeTFDB supplies not only the results of blastp and clustered protein families but also links to either species-specific TF databases, such as DATF, RARTF, AtTFDB, DRTF or integrative TF database such as PlnTFDB, Grassius and GramineaeTFDB (Fig. 3D and E). This feature provides a unique option for comparative studies of TF repertoires not only among tree species but also between tree and non-tree plants (Fig. 3D and E). For poplar and cassava, hyperlinks linking their TF-encoding genes to available FL-cDNA clones reported in public repositories are also provided in detailed pages under ‘Corresponding to other identifiers’ (Fig. 3F). Furthermore, we supplied on TreeTFDB hyperlinks linking directly the TFs of poplar and grapevine to their expression patterns documented in public and freely available resources (Fig. 3J). The expression profiles of the castor bean TF-encoding genes, for which data are available, in five different tissues are also provided on the detailed page of the TreeTFDB for immediate viewing. These expression data together with information of cis-motif analyses, GO annotations and sequence similarities inferred from comparative analyses of the tree crops can facilitate the systematic functional predictions of identified TFs. Finally, in comparison with PlnTFDB and PlantTFDB, which provide three and five TF repertoires out of six species analysed by TreeTFDB, the TreeTFDB has several major updates, allowing the users to access a number of new information and features that are not available on PlnTFDB and PlantTFDB even for the TF repertoires provided on these databases. Table 2 summarized the major differences among these three databases.

ConclusionsThe interactions between TFs and cis-regulatory DNA sequences control gene expression, constituting the essential functional linkages of gene regulatory networks. Knowledge gained from cis-elements, GO annotation and expression data will enable effective functional prediction of the identified TFs. With its friendly user interface, TreeTFDB will, therefore, meet the broad demands of researchers who strive to perform research on tree TFs with the goal of gaining greater understanding of their regulatory roles in different signalling pathways, underlying plant development, differentiation and environmental responses, ultimately leading to development of varieties with improved performance.Supplementary dataSupplementary Data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was partially supported by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan [Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Areas (23119524) to K.M.].

IntroductionRecent advances in the next generation sequencing technologies presented us with a wider computational challenge to analyze and correlate the abundance of the protein diversity with the gene content. In eukaryotes particularly, the presence of introns within the protein-coding genes can generate more than one functional mRNA isoforms from one pre-mRNA transcript, through a post-transcriptional event called as alternative splicing (AS), which in turn increases the protein complexity and mRNA abundance without increasing the gene content. It has been proposed that the glycine-rich RNA binding protein AtGRP7 has been suggested as a potential factor to regulate AS in Arabidopsis thaliana.1 In principle, four basic and major type AS types have been reported, including exon skipping (ExonS), alternative donor (AltD) or alternative acceptor (AltA) site, and intron retention (IntronR).2 However, other types such as alternate terminal exon, retained exon (RE) and skipped exon (SE), initiation within an intron, termination within an intron, and spliced intron have also been reported in Oryza sativa.3 Some other basic types also have been classified as AS events such as alternative transcription initiation, alternative transcription termination, and mutually exclusive exons.4 However, complex events can be formed by combinations of the basic AS types. AS may generate a functional transcript that encodes distinct functional proteins, or a nonfunctional transcript that harbors a premature termination codon (PTC). These nonfunctional isoforms are degraded through a process called ‘regulated unproductive splicing and translation.’5 AS transcripts also play an important role in protein–protein interactions (PPIs) networks in addition to the differential gene expression in describing the tissue-specific cellular functions.6 Conditional splicing using ExonS of a suicide exon has been shown to regulate transgene and gene activation in Nicotiana benthamiana.7AS transcripts are generally generated through three pathways: (i) IntronR in the mature mRNA, accounting for 30–50% of AS in A. thaliana and O. sativa, (ii) alternative exon usage, resulting in ExonS, and (iii) the use of cryptic splice sites that may elongate or shorten an exon.2 Approximately 60–75% of AS events occur within the protein-coding regions of mRNAs, resulting in changes in binding properties, intracellular localization, protein stability, enzymatic, and signaling activities.8 Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) have been used to discover and delineate these alternative-splicing variants through homology mapping-based approach.2,3,9 In plants, the functional relevance of certain AS-derived isoforms in responses to biotic and abiotic stresses has been reviewed.10,11 RNA-seq has played an important role in revealing the transcript diversity through AS events and revealed the abundance of the alternative isoforms with PTC.12 Recently, using RNA-seq AS events have also been revealed in plant circadian clock-associated genes in A. thaliana.13 The roles of these genes involved in the processes of photosynthesis, plant disease resistance, flowering, and grain quality in O. sativa have been well illustrated (see Reddy for review).10 Complex networks of regulation of gene expression and variation in AS have played a major role in the adaptation of plants to their corresponding habitat and environment.14 A recent review describes the role of the splicing regulatory elements and emerging experimental and computational approaches to identify cis-elements involved in regulating of AS in plants.15Brachypodium distachyon is considered to be the model temperate grass for studying the evolutionary genomics and for the elucidation of the biologic pathways in grass genomics.16–18 It has also been suggested to be a model species for studying the evolutionary insights into biofuel crops such as genus Miscanthus and Panicum virgatum.19 The genome of B. distachyon was recently sequenced, and a total of 25 532 protein-coding genes were predicted as a part of genome analysis pipeline.20B. distachyon genome exhibits a much higher level of co-linearity and synteny to the genomes of temperate cereal crops and also forage grasses such as Lolium and Festuca,17,20,21 and, thus, it can serve as a model genome to understand the functional protein diversity generated through alternative splice events in cereal crops. ESTs generated from B. distachyon were used for gene finding and phylogenetic analysis.22 In an earlier study, through mapping of 3818 tentative consensus sequences on the assembled genome scaffolds, we have demonstrated the presence of 128 AS events involving 120 genes in B. distachyon.9 In recent years, transcript abundance has been observed in the identification of the ESTs from this model organism, which presents an opportunity to study the AS at a wider level because of the availability of the larger number of transcripts with a higher genomic coverage. RIKEN has recently established a full-length cDNA (FLcDNA) project of B. distachyon consisting of the 79 872 ESTs generated using the biotinylated CAP trapper methodology. BrachyFLcDNA DB has been integrated with other available resources to make it is an integrated repository. The availability of the FLcDNA in B. distachyon will also aid in redefining the earlier gene models and will also aid in the functional analysis of the gene patterns.23 In the present study, we have reinvestigated the landscape of the AS events and demonstrated the presence of 1219 AS events involving 2204 putatively assembled transcripts generated from 941 genes. We have also classified the AS events according to functional ontology. In addition, we have created an online portal (http://proteomics.ysu.edu/altsplice/plant/) to access the annotation of all ESTs and AS events identified in this study.2. Materials and methods2.1. Sequence datasetsA total of 30 991 assembled transcript sequences also known as PlantGDB-assembled unique transcripts (PUTs) for B. distachyon were downloaded from PlantGDB (http://www.plantgdb.org/).24 The PUTs sets were generated by assembling 128 098 ESTs and mRNA sequences (version 175a) using the methods described at the site (http://www.plantgdb.org/prj/ESTCluster/PUT_procedure.php). Our previous evaluation confirmed that assemblies generated by CAP3 (parameters –p 95, –o 49, and –t 10 000), which was used by PlantGDB, were suitable for identification of AS isoforms.25,26 The option t with value 10 000 improves the quality of the assembly using the maximum available memory, and, thus, it avoids the misassembling of the ESTs and formation of counterfeit longer assemblies. The genome sequence of B. distachyon (diploid inbred line Bd21) was downloaded from Phytozome (v7.0).20,27 The assembled genome of B. distachyon measures approximately 272 Mb and spans across 5 chromosomes and 78 unmapped scaffolds.2.2. Homology mapping, identification, and functional ontology of AS isoformsHomology mapping was achieved by mapping the PUTs (hereafter referred as ESTs) of B. distachyon to the corresponding genome sequence, and identification of AS isoforms was done using ASFinder (http://proteomics.ysu.edu/tools/ASFinder.html/).28 ASFinder uses SIM4 program to map ESTs to the corresponding genome.29 It subsequently identifies those ESTs that are mapped to the same genomic location, but have variable exon–intron boundaries as AS isoforms. For our mapping, we used the following thresholds: a minimum of 97% identity of aligned ESTs with genomic sequences, a minimum of 80 bp of aligned length, and >85% of EST sequence aligned to the genome. The output of ASFinder was subsequently analyzed, and AS events were identified using AStalavista server (http://genome.crg.es/astalavista/).30 Additional AS isoforms from ESTs that were not mapped to the genome were identified using ASFinder BLASTN method to detect those EST pairs that have two or more segmented alignments. This similar method of using BLAT tool, rather than BLAST, has been previously used to identify AS from ESTs in plants.31 The functionalities of genes having AS events were identified using rpsBLAST against Pfam and the Conserved Domain Database.32 Gene ontology (GO) information was retrieved by mapping Pfam to GO (http://www.geneontology.org/external2go/pfam2go) and analyzed using GO SlimViewer with plant-specific GO terms.33 ESTs were also compared with predicted protein-coding DNA sequences (CDS) in Phytozome using BLASTN, with a cutoff E-value of 1e-10, and a total of 22 591 ESTs had one or more CDS match with =97% identity. The information was available in the database for comparison.2.3. Conserved alternatively spliced genes in B. distachyon, O. sativa, and ArabidopsisTo identify potentially conserved alternatively spliced genes between B. distachyon, O. sativa, and A. thaliana, we downloaded previously detected mRNA sequences of AS genes in O. sativa and A. thaliana from Plant GDB ASIP portal (http://www.plantgdb.org/ASIP/Download/).2 Conserved AS genes were identified using O. sativa and A. thaliana AS mRNAs to search against B. distachyon AS ESTs using BLASTN with E-value of 1e-5. The best BLASTN hit with an identity of >70% and a minimum aligned length of >100 bp were identified as conserved AS pairs.2.4. Data access and visualization of ASWe annotated all ESTs according to function and structure, which involves the prediction of the protein-coding regions in the ESTs using OrfPredictor (http://proteomics.ysu.edu/tools/OrfPredictor.html),34 mapping to genomic sequences, BLASTN matching ESTs to predicted protein CDS (=97% identity used) of this species downloaded from Phytozome, and Pfam and conserved domain search. We further developed an online web portal for the systematic display of the mapped ESTs and associated AS events (http://proteomics.ysu.edu/altsplice/plant/). The database can be queried using EST ID, keywords, or AS event types. The AS events can be systematically browsed using GBrowse, and the CDS annotations were added using the GFF file of the annotated genome downloaded from Phytozome. We provide a functionality to query for all ESTs and AS events using BLASTN.3. Results and discussion3.1. Detection and classification of AS eventsIn our study, a total of 23 693 ESTs were successively mapped to 14 841 genomic loci of B. distachyon genome sequence. We identified a total of 1219 pairs of ESTs (2021 unique ESTs), which were mapped to 941 genomic loci having AS, suggesting that ~6.3% of expressed genes in B. distachyon are under the potential influence of AS (Supplementary Table S1). The observed AS percentage is relatively low in comparison to the percentage of the genes observed in A. thaliana (21.8%) and O. sativa (21.2%).2 This potential difference in the distribution of the AS genes versus non-AS genes may be due to the fact that relatively more transcript resources are available for A. thaliana and O. sativa in comparison to B. distachyon. Classification of the AS events showed that the majority of the observed events (676) corresponded to IntronR (55.5%), followed by AltA (204, 16.7%), AltD (107, 8.8%), and ExonS (61, 5.0%). We observed 171 ‘complex events’ that correspond to AS events having more than 1 basic event (14.0%) (Fig. 1). Inspite of the difference in the transcript abundance, the observed AS events, particularly IntronR, showed conservation across the plant lineage, which may be an indication of dominance of the splice site recognition by intron definition as previously suggested in A. thaliana and O. sativa.2Landscape of AS events in B. distachyon.Landscape of AS events in B. distachyon.The abundance of IntronR is consistent with previous several reports in organism such as Medicago truncatula (39%), Populus trichocarpa (34%), A. thaliana (56%), O. sativa (54%), and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (50%).2,35,36 Recently, using a RNA-seq study, IntronR was also observed as a major event in mRNAs of the CCA1/LHY-like subfamily of MYB transcription factors in A. thaliana.13 The prevalence of IntronR type in B. distachyon and in other plants supports the intron definition model, i.e. introns are identified by the splicing machinery splicesomes, for pre-mRNA splicing in plants, that was in contrast to the exon definition model in animals. Supportive views for the plant introns retention suggest that they are not derived just as a cause of incomplete splicing, but they are maintained as potential cytoplasmic translatable transcripts.31 The results observed in the present study expanded the landscape of the AS events in B. distachyon by incorporating a higher number of ESTs when compared with the previous published reports of AS events in B. distachyon.9 The events of AltA were approximately twice frequent as the events of AltD, which are also consistent with previous observations in other plants.2,3,36Recently, it has been observed that alternative 3' splice site has been observed as the most dominant AS event in contrast to IntronR in A. thaliana using annotated genomic data.37 Such a discrepancy might be caused by insufficient coverage of AS types in the study of Koralewski and Krutovsky as EST data were not used and only about one-quarter of AS events were identified when compared with the previous study.2,37 Recently, using the data generated from ultrahigh-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in A. thaliana revealed that at least 42% of intron-containing genes were alternatively spliced.12 However, despite the difference in the percentage of AS genes using EST mapping and deep transcriptome sequencing, these results were consistent in identifying that IntronR was the most prevalent form of AS in plants.2,12There was a whole genome duplication event that occurred before the diversification of the grasses, and also grass-specific tandem gene expansion in B. distachyon was observed.20 In an earlier study, the relation between gene family size and AS was studied by comparing the distribution of AS frequency in single-copy genes versus gene families, and, interestingly, a higher percentage of AS was found in gene families than in single-copy genes in A. thaliana and O. sativa.38 In our analysis, we clustered paralogs using the blastclust tool (–S 50 and –L 0.7) in BLAST package and identified 3407 gene families and 15 169 single genes. Then, mapping AS transcripts to them revealed 7.7 and 5.9% of AS in gene families and in single-copy genes, respectively. Recent analysis showed that gene duplication and AS evolved independently, which is further exemplified with the confirmation of the independent evolution of these two processes using isochorismate synthase in Arabidopsis and Populus.39 AS divergence between duplicated genes may have contributed to gene functional evolution and led to preservation of some duplicated genes.40 Our results are in accordance with the recent finding which suggests that the moderately duplicated gene families have potentially higher AS isoforms when compared with the singleton genes. AS, along with gene duplication, represents an evolutional strategy that rapidly increases genome plasticity to deal with various plant stresses.11In addition to the AS genes and events identified by mapping ESTs to the genome, using the BLASTN method implemented in ASFinder, we also identified 56 genes (involving 129 ESTs) from 7298 ESTs, which were not mapped to the genome. However, specific category of AS events in this subset of genes cannot be identified because of the lack of the genomic information. All ESTs and spliced variants can be queried, visualized, explored, and browsed at the Plant Alternative Splicing Database (http://proteomics.ysu.edu/altsplice/plant/) using several query patterns such as EST IDs, gene, and AS event type. One similar resource for the visualization of AS events, which has been developed for A. thaliana, is available at ArabiTag; http://transvar.org/arabitag/.413.2. Features of exons and introns in protein-coding genesFollowing the mapping of the ESTs to the corresponding genomic sequence, we extracted the lengths of 34 087 internal exons and 48 000 introns. We observed size variation with internal exons that had a size ranging from 15 to 1461 bp with an average size of 130 ± 87 bp. We further observed that approximately 96% of exons had a size below 300 bp and 58% lied between 60 and 140 bp (Fig. 2). The observed exon length is in line with the earlier observed mean internal exon length in A. thaliana (172 bp) and O. sativa (193 bp).2 It has been previously shown that the shorter exons have high potential for AS events by exon shuffling events coupled with exon duplication and may promote the genome and transcriptomic complexity.37 It has been demonstrated previously that organisms having the shorter exons have higher gene content ratio.37 However, when compared with exon size, the distributions of intron size were more variable, ranging from 10 bp to >10 kb. There were 32 introns (0.07%) having a size >10 kb. However, in considering possible errors in EST assembly and genome assembly, these long introns identified in this study need to be further examined experimentally. Excluding those long introns with >10 kb in size, the remaining introns had an average size of 420 bp with a standard deviation of 622 bp, ~63% had a size below 300 bp, and ~47% of introns lied in 60–140 bp (Fig. 3). The average intron size in B. distachyon was very close to rice intron size (433 bp), and both of them were much longer than the average intron size (173 bp) in Arabidopsis, calculated using a similar method.2Distribution of internal exon size: The x-axis indicates the size of internal exons.

Features of retained introns, SEs, and other DNA fragments involved in AS eventsWe examined the size distribution of DNA fragments involved in AS events, including retained introns, SEs, and fragments in AltD or AltA sites (Table 1). The retained introns had a range from 8 to 1142 bp with an average size of 184 bp, which is quite small in comparison to the average size of the introns in the species. Although the overall frequency distribution of retained intron size was similar to the distribution of all introns, there were no introns longer than 1150 bp in the retained intron set (Fig. 4). The SEs (ExonS) had a range of 23–376 bp with an average size of 111 bp. The fragments involved in AltD or AltA sites ranged from 3 to 468 bp (average size 49 bp) in AltA and from 3 to 553 bp (average size 67 bp) in AltD. Overall, the average size of the fragments involved in AS was relatively short. It has been previously suggested that the presence of the retained intron within the coding sequence may give rise to the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD).42 However, recently it has been proposed in Arabidospis that splice isoform with the retained introns is not sensitive to NMD.43 Although the high proportion of retained introns in AS events in plants supports the intron definition model in splicing, the evidence that the size of the retained introns was more similar to typical exons, lack of long introns, makes the exon definition model an alternative reasonable explanation.

Functional ontology of AS genesFunctional annotation of the alternative spliced transcripts and their association with certain domains can give the mechanistic overview of the functional impact of the AS on the domain and also on domain-mediated regulation of AS. Recently, it has been predicted that AS events have potential effects on the protein domain function. In a recent study, it was demonstrated that MIKC MADS-box genes are under the strong influence of the AS events, and conserved AS events were observed across the borders or with in the K-box domain.44 In a recent study, it has been demonstrated that two spliceosomal proteins, U1-70K and U2AFb35 are known to function in 5' and 3' splice site selection and regulate the AS in SR45 that is a serine/arginine-rich (SR)-like protein with two arginine/serine-rich (RS) domains.45To annotate the AS transcripts and to identify their possible association with functional domains, we performed a BLASTX search of all ESTs of B. distachyon against UniProt database. The protein-coding sequences [open reading frames (ORFs)] of ESTs were identified using OrfPredictor webserver.34 The functional domains of the AS genes, using the longest ORF of each AS gene, were predicted using rpsBLAST searching Pfam and CDD database. Among a total of 941 proteins encoded by AS genes, 651 were predicted having functional domains (Supplementary Table S1). We have further classified the genes according to the gene functional ontology (GO) categories, i.e. cellular component, molecular functions, and biological processes (Table 2, Supplementary Table S2). It was observed that the overall distribution of molecular functions in genes having AS and non-AS genes was similar (Table 2). Most of the functionally annotated transcripts were found to be associated with binding activity or catalytic activity, and some of which were found to be associated with DNA and RNA binding, respectively (Table 2). These transcripts with functional annotation may be of functional importance in revealing the genes in various biological pathways. It has been suggested that the binding of the proteins to cis-regulatory sequences in exons and introns and associated splicing regulators may regulate the loading of the splicing machinery to splice site.10GO and classification of associated molecular functions of AS genes and non-AS genesGO and classification of associated molecular functions of AS genes and non-AS genesEarlier, it has been shown that the AS also plays an important role in promotion of the floral transitions, which gives a layout of the involvement of the AS events in the biological pathways. In a study, it has been shown that the AS of the FCA transcript, which encodes a RNA-binding domain and a putative PPI domain, promotes floral transition in A. thaliana fca mutants.46 Recently, it has been demonstrated that a splice variant (IDD14ß) of Arabidopsis INDETERMINATE DOMAIN14 (IDD14) transcription factor regulates the function of the IDD14a in starch metabolism by acting as an inhibitor forming heterodimers, which potentially explains the role of the AS in regulation of the transcription factor activity.47 Recent reports suggest that AS also plays a potential role in the regulation of the freezing tolerance through the splicing of the clock compounds (CIRCADIAN CLOCK-ASSOCIATED1; CCA1).48 We observed GO categories enriched in carbohydrate metabolic process (GO:0005975) and in response to stress (GO:0006950) in the AS transcripts (Supplementary Table S2), which gives a strong indication of the modulation of the biosynthetic pathway and increases the protein diversity for a subset of genes using AS events. Recently, using a systematic investigation of an intronic miR400 under heat stress in A. thaliana, it has been shown that the AS acts as a regulatory link and possibly regulates the interactions of miRNAs and environmental stress.49 Several recent reports postulate the association of the AS events with biosynthesis in a couple of genes involved in auxin biosynthesis shows the patterns of tissue-specific splicing.50,51 However, all these functions still remain uncovered in B. distachyon that is a model organism for grass monocot lineage. Further experimental verification of the AS events with functional annotation, identified in the present study, may highlight some important biological phenomenon in detail, which are specific to grass lineage.3.5. Conserved alternatively spliced genesIdentification of the conserved AS events can also assist us in understanding the evolution of the functional genes and their regulation at the transcriptional and at the translational level, which may shed light on the understanding of the trade-off going on between the plant machinery and the environmental adaptation. The identification of the AS isoforms in plants may explain and postulate plausible answers to adaptation to environmental stress, domestication, and also may likely explain the trait selection.51 It has been stressed that the detection of the conserved AS events may potentially help in the identification of the AS isoforms containing PTC.52 Recent analysis further revealed that AS underlies the exonization of the 5S rRNA, which regulates the TFIIA.53 The serine/arginine-rich (SR) protein family plays an important role in constitutive AS and regulates AS in a tissue-specific and stress-responsive manner.54 Three sets of AS events were conserved between A. thaliana and rice in the plant-novel-SR protein, SC35-like and two Zn-knuckles-type 9G8 subfamilies.54 It was reported that 41.7% of AS genes in A. thaliana were found to have close homologs in O. sativa that were also identified to be alternatively spliced, and 30% of the intron-retained transcripts also showed conservation between A. thaliana and O. sativa.2In our study, we identified 163 homologous pairs of AS genes between B. distachyon and O. sativa, ~17.3% of all AS genes identified in B. distachyon and 39 homologous pairs of AS genes between B. distachyon and A. thaliana (Supplementary Table S3). Among the functionally annotated AS events, 16 AS genes were found be conserved among all the species (Table 3). Our study postulates the potential list of 16 conserved genes that may act as potential marker genes/transcripts for further, detailed experimental examination of their biological significance of AS in plant growth, development, and tracing the evolution of certain biological pathways. Conserved alternatively spliced genes in B. distachyon, O. sativa, and A. thalianaConserved alternatively spliced genes in B. distachyon, O. sativa, and A. thalianaIn summary, B. distachyon is currently a model plant for studying grass system and evolutionary biology. Identification of alternatively spliced genes and AS events is the first step for understanding which categories of genes are regulated post-transcriptionally and to identify the potential mechanisms for transcriptomic complexity. Our systematically analyzed data provide a visualization portal to B. distachyon community researchers who aim to identify potential mechanisms of transcriptomic diversity and adaption to stress and to expand the functional relevance of the identified AS events through experimental approaches.Supplementary dataSupplementary Data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.Authors' contributionB.W. and G.L. contributed to the database construction, G.S. and X.J.M. contributed to the experiment design, data analysis, and preparation of the manuscript.

IntroductionFabaceae, or Leguminosae, is composed of ~700 genera and 20 000 species.1 The family is classified into three major subfamilies Mimosoideae, Caesalpinioideae, and Papilionoideae.2 Papilionoideae is divided into four clades Genistoids, Dalbergioids, Phaseoloids, and Galegoids. Most tropical and cool season legumes used as crops and studied as model plants for symbiosis of rhizobium are members of the Phaseoloids, e.g. genera Cajanus, Glycine, Phaseolus, and Vigna, or the Galegoids, e.g. genera Lotus, Medicago, Pisum, Trifolium, and Vicia.2 Therefore, legume genetics and genomics, including genome sequencing and comparative genomics, have greatly advanced in the Phaseoloids and Galegoids.3–9The Dalbergioids, which include the genus, Arachis, are more basal in their divergence within the Papilionoideae than the Phaseoloids and Galegoids. The genus Arachis comprises 80 species (2n = 2x = 18, 2n = 2x = 20, and 2n = 4x = 40) possessing A, B, C, D, E, F, K, R, and T genomes.10–12 As regarding the A genome diploids consisting of 15 wild species, they are morphologically similar, cross compatible, produce fertile hybrids with near normal chromosome pairing, and have a common karyotype structure.13 The B-genome diploids also have similar morphological and chromosome feature, cross-compatibility, bivalent formation at meiosis in interspecific hybrids, and the same karyotype structure.12 Peanut (Arachis hypogaea), or groundnut, is an autogamous allotetraploid legume (2n = 4x = 40) harbouring homoeologous A and B genomes that are derived from two diploids, most likely Arachis duranensis (A genome) and Arachis ipaënsis (B genome).14,15 While peanut is an important source of food and oil, the genetics and genomics of this legume lag far behind those of the Phaseoloids and Galegoids due to a complex genome structure with challenging features, such as tetraploidy, low genetic diversity, and a relatively large genome size of 2.8 Gb.16Molecular genetic studies of Arachis initially progressed by using diploid rather than tetraploid peanut due to the greater simplicity of diploids as genetic models.17 The first genetic linkage map in genus Arachis was developed based on an interspecific crossing between diploids Arachis stenosperma (A genome) and Arachis cardenasii (also A genome),17 followed by a cross between A. duranensis and A. stenosperma (both A genomes)18,19 and between A. ipaënsis and Arachis magna (both B genomes).20 However, because of the small number of available DNA markers at the time, the number of mapped marker loci was limited to between 117 and 369. Recently, intraspecific maps for A-genome diploid (A. duranensis) and B-genome diploid (Arachi batizocoi) have been developed with 1724 and 449 marker loci, respectively, including single nucleotide polymorphisms and expressed sequence tag-simple sequence repeats (EST-SSRs) markers.21,22Meanwhile, an artificial amphidiploid derived from a three-way cross between A. batizocoi (B genome) and a hybrid between A. cardenasii (A genome) and A. diogoi (A genome) has been crossed with A. hypogaea to introduce genetic diversity from wild diploid species into the tetraploid-cultivated peanut. The BC1 progenies of the cross have contributed to the generation of a tetraploid genetic linkage map with 370 restriction-fragment length polymorphisms.23 In addition, another artificial amphidiploid line, derived from a hybrid between A. duranensis and A. ipaënsis, was used to establish a genetic linkage map made up of 298 SSR marker loci.24 In the latter map, the linkage groups (LGs) were firstly anchored to the A and B genomes by identifying the genome origins of the mapped loci in the LGs based on the corresponding sizes of the DNA amplified from the original diploids. In the tetraploid-cultivated peanut (A. hypogaea), the population-specific linkage maps comprise 318 marker loci. Due to low genetic diversity,25–33 this is the maximum number of marker loci for population-specific linkage maps, although >6000 SSR markers have been developed for mapping.34 By integrating the 11 linkage maps of the artificial amphidiploids and cultivated tetraploid peanuts, a reference consensus map consisting of 897 marker loci was constructed and annotated with consensus nomenclature for the LGs (a01–a10 and b01–b10).35Concurrent with the progress of the above genetic studies in Arachis spp., a high-density linkage map of cultivated peanut covering 2166 cM with 1114 marker loci has also been reported.36 Because most of the markers on this map were published after the development of the other Arachis maps,36–38 the markers do not appear on them.17–20,23–32 In addition, due to an insufficient number of commonly mapped loci in the published diploid maps, the LGs have not been assigned to either A or B genome types, even though homoeologous LGs have been identified.36 Anchoring the genetic LGs to the A and B genomes will enable enrichment of marker density on the consensus and diploid maps.19,20,35 This would contribute to a better understanding of genome evolution within Arachis and among the Fabaceae. In addition, it would serve to increase the efficiency of introgression of desirable alleles from diploid wild species into the tetraploid-cultivated peanut through marker-assisted selection.Comparative analysis of the A genome diploid Arachis species, e.g. A. duranensis and A. stenosperma, and model legumes has previously been performed. This comparative analysis revealed candidate synteny blocks between the genomes of Lotus japonicus, Medicago truncatula, and Glycine max.21,39 To date, no comparative analysis of cultivated peanut and other legume species has been reported. Comparison of the tetraploid Arachis genome, represented by the high-density consensus map of the genomes of legumes Cajanus cajan, G. max, L. japonicus, and M. truncatula, would provide further insights into the legume genomes.To address the above issues, it was considered that high-density linkage maps of the tetraploid and diploid species, on which common makers were mapped, would be required. Therefore, we tried to map the large number of DNA markers reported for the two cultivated peanut maps published by Shirasawa et al.36 onto the previously reported linkage maps of the A and B genomes,19,20 along with that of an artificial amphidiploid derived from a hybrid of diploid species. The established linkage maps were integrated with 13 reported tetraploid Arachis maps to increase the number of mapped loci on the previously published consensus map.35 Subsequently, the maps were subjected to comparative analysis with four legume genomes, C. cajan, G. max, L. japonicus, and M. truncatula, to clarify features of the genome structure of the genus Arachis.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materialsIn previous studies, two F2 mapping populations, derived from interspecific crosses between the two A genome diploid species, A. duranensis ‘K7988’ and A. stenosperma ‘V10309’, and between the two B genome diploid species, A. ipaënsis ‘K30076’ and A. magna ‘K30097’, were used to construct genetic linkage maps.19,20 In the present study, the F5 and F6 progenies of the diploid A and B genome mapping populations, respectively, were generated by single seed descent, and used as recombinant inbred mapping populations. The A and B genome mapping populations were named as AF5 (n = 89) and BF6 (n = 94), respectively. In addition, other recombinant inbred lines were used to construct AB genome tetraploid (n = 91: population TF6) maps. This population consisted of F6 lines derived from a cross between A. hypogaea ‘Runner IAC 886’ and an artificial amphidiploid (A. ipaënsis × A. duranensis)4×, which was developed by hybridizing A. ipaënsis ‘K30076’ and A. duranensis ‘V14167’. Genomic DNA from each line was extracted from young leaflets essentially as described by Grattapaglia and Sederoff.402.2. Polymorphism analysis with DNA markersA total of 3902 DNA markers comprising 1894 genomic SSRs A. hypogaea genomic SSR (AHGS),36 1571 EST-SSRs A. hypogaea EST-SSR (AHS),37 and 437 transposon-based markers A. hypogaea transposable element (AhTE)36,38 were screened against the parental lines of the populations AF5, BF6, and TF6 using an ABI-3730xl fluorescent fragment analyser (Applied Biosystems). Polymorphic markers were analysed on the three mapping populations using 10% polyacrylamide gels for markers exhibiting =10-bp allele size differences, or the fluorescent fragment analyser for markers exhibiting <10-bp allele size differences between the parental lines. PCR, electrophoresis, and data scoring were performed as described previously.36–382.3. Construction of linkage maps and the integrated mapLinkage analysis of segregated genotypic data obtained in this study was performed together with linkage analysis of the previously investigated genotypes with mapped markers on the diploid maps19,20 using JoinMap® version 4.41 The marker loci were roughly classified using the JoinMap® Grouping Module with logarithm of odds (LOD) scores of 4.0–10.0. The JoinMap® Combine Groups for Map Integration Module was used to integrate the linkage maps developed in this study and the 13 previously published maps into a tetraploid map, i.e. the cultivated peanut map25–32,36 and an artificial amphidiploid map.24 Marker order and genetic distance were calculated using a regression mapping algorithm with the following parameters: Haldane's mapping function, recombination frequency =0.30, and LOD score =2.0. The graphical linkage maps were drawn using the MapChart program.422.4. Comparative analysis of the Arachis maps with other legume genomesBLASTN43 was used to conduct similarity searches (using the nucleotide sequences from which the mapped DNA markers were designed) against each pseudomolecule of the genome sequences of C. cajan,8G. max (Glyma1),6L. japonicus (build 2.5),5 and M. truncatula (Mt3.5v4),7 with a threshold E-value of 1e-20. The graphical comparative maps were drawn using the Circos program.443. Results3.1. Polymorphism screening of the parental lines of the mapping populations and construction of the linkage mapsPrior to polymorphism analysis between the parental lines, a total of 3902 markers, i.e. 1894 AHGS, 1571 AHS, and 437 AhTE markers, were pre-selected from the 6680 AHGS, 3187 AHS, and 1039 AhTE markers that have been published.36–38 The markers were pre-selected according to the following criteria: (i) AHGS markers were selected if they were expected to detect polymorphism among the cultivated peanut lines according to the results of in silico polymorphism analysis;36 (ii) AHS markers were selected if they showed polymorphisms between cultivated lines and wild species;37 (iii) AhTE markers were selected if they amplified single or double bands.36,38A total of 582 markers (14.9% = 582/3902), including 450 AHGS (23.8% = 450/1894), 109 AHS (6.9% = 109/1571), and 23 AhTE (5.3% = 23/437) markers, were selected as polymorphism candidates between the parental lines of the AF5 population, A. duranensis ‘K7988’ and A. stenosperma ‘V10309’. Out of the 582 polymorphic markers, 395 generated a total of 437 segregation loci, since several markers detected more than one locus. Specifically, 359, 31, 4, and 1 marker(s) detected 1, 2, 3, and 4 polymorphic loci, respectively, which were suffixed with ‘_a1’ and ‘_a2’, e.g. AHGS1647_a1 and AHGS1647_a2, to distinguish the loci each other. The 437 polymorphic loci, 284 codominant, and 153 dominant loci, were successfully mapped onto 10 LGs covering 544 cM, together with 160 previously mapped polymorphic loci from 158 markers (Fig. 1, Table 1, and Supplementary Table S1).19 The average marker density of the map was 0.9 cM, and segregation distortions were observed in 65% (390 loci) of the mapped loci (Table 1).

Homologous or homoeologous marker loci are connected by lines.A total of 862 markers (22.1% = 862/3902), including 513 AHGS (27.1% = 513/1894), 279 AHS (17.8% = 279/1571), and 70 AhTE (16.0% = 70/437) markers, were selected as polymorphism candidates between the parental lines of the BF6 population, A. ipaënsis ‘K30076’ and A. magna ‘K30097’. Out of the 862 polymorphic markers, 624 generated a total of 680 segregation loci, since, as with the AF5 population, several of these markers detected more than one locus. Specifically, 579, 35, 9, and 1 marker(s) detected 1, 2, 3, and 4 polymorphic loci, respectively, which were suffixed with ‘_b1’ and ‘_b2’, e.g. AHGS1478_b1 and AHGS1478_b2, to distinguish the loci each other. The 680 polymorphic loci, 549 codominant, and 131 dominant, were successfully mapped onto 10 LGs covering 461 cM together with 118 previously mapped loci from 116 markers (Fig. 1, Table 1, and Supplementary Table S1).20 The average marker density of the map was 0.6 cM, and segregation distortions were observed in 31% (250 loci) of the mapped loci (Table 1).Together with the parental lines of TF6, the two original diploids of the artificial amphidiploid, A. ipaënsis ‘K30076’ and A. duranensis ‘V14167’, were also genotyped to identify the genome origin (A or B genome) of the polymorphic DNA fragments. A total of 1144 markers (29.3% = 1144/3902), including 664 AHGS (35.1% = 664/1894), 257 AHS (16.4% = 257/1571), and 223 AhTE (51.0% = 223/437) were selected as polymorphism candidates between the parental lines of the TF6 population, A. hypogaea ‘Runner IAC 886’ and an artificial amphidiploid (A. ipaënsis ‘K30076’ × A. duranensis ‘V14167’)4×. Out of the 1144 polymorphic markers, 1055 generated a total of 1261 segregation loci, since, as with the AF5 and BF6 populations, several of these markers detected more than one locus. Specifically, 879, 150, 22, and 4 markers detected 1, 2, 3, and 4 polymorphic loci, respectively, which were suffixed with ‘_t1’ and ‘_t2’, e.g. AHGS1991_t1 and AHGS1991_t2, to distinguish the loci each other. The 1261 polymorphic loci, 970 codominant, and 291 dominant, were successfully mapped onto 20 LGs covering 1442 cM together with 208 loci from 180 markers (Moretzsohn et al. unpublished data). The 20 LGs were classified into 10 pairs of A and B genomes, according to the DNA fragment size of mapped loci corresponding to ‘K30076’ or ‘V14167’ (Fig. 1, Table 1, and Supplementary Table S1). The average marker density of the map was 1.0 cM, and segregation distortions were observed in 19% (285 loci) of the mapped loci (Table 1).In total, the number of non-redundant AHGS, AHS, and AhTE markers mapped on the three maps were 890, 446, and 211, respectively. Out of the total 1547 markers, 73 (67 AHGSs and six AHSs) and 381 (298 AHGSs, 59 AHSs, and 24 AhTEs) were mapped on three and two maps, respectively, while 1093 (525 AHGSs, 381 AHSs, and 187 AhTEs) were mapped on just one map; the AF5, BF6, or TF6 map (Supplementary Table S1). Comparing the three maps, 203 of the 597 mapped loci on the AF5 map, and 157 out of 798 loci on the BF6 map, were also located on the TF6 map (Supplementary Table S1).The LGs were designated AA, BB, and TA or TB in the AF5, BF6 and TF6 maps, respectively. The nomenclature of the LGs of the diploid maps was tentatively determined according to the commonly mapped marker loci between the present and the previously constructed maps.19,20 Eight LGs of the AF5 map (AA01 and AA03–AA09) and all 10 of the LGs of the BF6 map (BB01–BB10) were assigned to the corresponding LGs on the previous maps (Supplementary Table S2). The two LGs of the AF5 map were assigned to ‘Group 02’ in the previous map,19 and they were tentatively named AA02 and AA10 (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S2). ‘Group 10’ in the previous map19 was disassembled on the AF5 map. On the other hand, in the TF6 map, TA01, TA03–TA09, and TB01–TB10 were assigned to the corresponding LGs of the AF5 and BF6 maps, and TA02 and TA10 were assigned to the AA02 and AA10 LGs, respectively (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S2). After integrating all of these data, 10 homoeologous groups (HGs) were identified on the TF6 map.The marker order was almost completely conserved between the HGs except for HG04, HG07, and HG08 (Fig. 1). In HG04, the lower part of TA04 corresponded to the upper part of TB04 (Fig. 1). In HG07, the loci mapped onto TB07 corresponded to those of TA07 and the upper part of TA08. Moreover, corresponding loci on TB08 were observed on the lower parts of TA08 and TA07 (Fig. 1), indicating a translocation between the A and B genomes as previously suggested.20,22,243.2. Integration of the genetic linkage maps into a consensus mapAn integrated consensus map was constructed based on the segregation genotypes of 16 populations: three from this study and 13 from previous studies (Supplementary Table S2).19,20,24–32,36 The integrated consensus map was 2651 cM in total length and comprised 20 LGs, on which 3693 loci, including 1564 AHGS, 569 AHS, 450 AhTE, and 1110 other loci, were mapped (Table 2, Fig. 2, and Supplementary Table S3), out of which markers mapped on mote than two loci were suffixed with ‘_c1’ and ‘_c2’, e.g. AHGS1403_c1 and AHGS1403_c2, to distinguish each other. The average marker density of this map was 0.7 cM (Table 2). On the consensus map, 391 marker loci were commonly mapped onto pairs of LGs in each HG, and the order of the markers was roughly conserved (Fig. 2).

They were observed in all of the LGs (Fig. 2, Table 2, and Supplementary Table S3). The total length of the locus clusters was 505 cM (101 clusters), varying from 15 cM (three clusters) in A06 and B05 to 40 cM (eight clusters) in A03 and B03. A total of 2319 loci, representing 62.8% of the mapped loci, were located in 101 clusters, which varied in loci content from 53 (A08) to 175 (A03) loci.3.3. Comparative mapping between the Arachis spp. and the four comparison legumes, C. cajan, G. max, L. japonicus, and M. truncatulaCorresponding sequences were available for 3473 of the 3693 mapped loci (Supplementary Table S3). Of these 3473 sequences, 869 showed significant similarity to one of the four legume genome sequences (C. cajan, G. max, L. japonicus, and M. truncatula). For each legume species, 515, 781, 436, and 419 sequences showed similarities to sequences in the C. cajan, G. max, L. japonicus, and M. truncatula genomes, respectively, and 170 sequences showed similarity to sequences in all four legume genomes.Segmental syntenic regions were observed between the Arachis HGs and the genomes of the four comparison legumes (Fig. 3, Table 3, and Supplementary Table S3). Most of the LG pairs in each HG showed similar synteny relationships to those in the four comparison legumes. Between the four comparison legume species, the genome of G. max showed the densest synteny of LGs, corresponding to those of Arachis. In addition, most of the LGs in Arachis were identified as shared syntenies with LGs on each of two chromosomes of G. max. This might reflect the palaeopolyploid nature of the genomes of these species. Comparing Arachis with the other three legume genomes, clearly syntenic segments were observed as follows: Arachis HG01 shared synteny with C. cajan chromosome 11 (Cc11) and M. truncatula chromosome 4 (Mt04); Arachis HG04 shared synteny with L. japonicus chromosome 4 (Lj04); Arachis HG05 shared synteny with Cc06, Lj02, and Mt05; Arachis HG06 shared synteny with Lj01 and Mt07; Arachis HG07 shared synteny with Cc02, Lj02, and Mt05; Arachis HG08 shared synteny with Cc03; Arachis HG09 shared synteny with Cc02, Lj05, and Mt01; and Arachis HG10 shared synteny with Lj01. On Arachis HG03, segmental blocks were identified that showed shared synteny between the comparison legume genomes, while no obvious synteny was observed between Arachis HG02 and the genomes of C. cajan, L. japonicus, and M. truncatula.

Polymorphism potential of the DNA markers mapped on the genetic linkage mapThe polymorphism potential of DNA markers in Arachis is usually evaluated on the basis of the polymorphism information content (PIC) value.34 While the PIC values of the AHS were estimated from genotyping data from 16 Arachis lines,37 those of the AHGS and AhTE have not been investigated thoroughly.36,38 In the present study and in previous studies,36 968 (416 AHGS, 395 AHS, and 157 AhTE), 666 (392 AHGS, 65 AHS, and 209 AhTE), 245 (197 AHGS, 10 AHS, and 38 AhTE), 73 (72 AHGS and 1 AhTE), and 3 (AHGS only) markers were mapped on single, double, triple, quadruple, and quintuple maps, respectively. Of these, the PIC values of the 395, 65, and 10 AHS markers were estimated to be, on average, 0.23, 0.28, and 0.36, respectively, from the results of Koilkonda et al.37 A positive correlation was observed between the PIC values and the number of maps on which the AHS was mapped. Therefore, if this estimation can be generalized, the AHGS and AhTE markers mapped on multiple maps can be considered as potential sources for obtaining polymorphic markers in other mapping populations.In the screening of polymorphic markers between the parental lines of the mapping populations, 582, 862, and 1144 markers were selected as polymorphism candidates, but 187, 238, and 89 were excluded from the mapping analysis. The excluded markers might amplify DNAs from not the target locus but non-allelic repetitive and putative paralogous sequences in the Arachis genome,38,45,46 which are not suitable for segregation and linkage analysis.4.2. Genetic linkage maps for three mapping populationsComparison of the AF5, BF6, and TF6 maps revealed that the marker order was almost perfectly conserved between the HGs, with the exception of HG04, HG07, and HG08 (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. S1). This result indicated that the A and B genomes of Arachis evolved from a common ancestor species. Exceptions to this shared marker order were found within HG04, and between HG07 and HG08. The former was observed for the first time in this study, while the latter confirms previous observations.20,24 These findings suggest that the chromosome translocations might have occurred at, or after, the divergence of the A and B genomes in Arachis.The AF5 and BF6 linkage maps have been improved by subsequent mapping of the newly developed markers after they were originally published.19,20 However, despite the increase in the number of mapped loci from 170 to 597 in the AF5 map and from 149 to 798 in the BF6 map, the total map length decreased from 1231 to 544 cM in the AF5 map and from 1294 to 461 cM in the BF6 map. In the maps generated in the present study, the marker loci that mapped to the ends of LGs in previous studies19,20 were excluded, and the intervals between the markers were shorter than those in previous maps. Mapping telomere-based makers will clarify whether the maps from this study have been saturated or not.In the linkage map for the TF6 population, the total length of the map was 1442 cM, which was shorter than that of the maps reported for Arachis tetraploids (2210 cM with 370 loci;23 2166 cM with 1114 loci;36 1844 cM with 298 loci;24 1785 cM with 191 loci29). Nagy et al.21 reported that the length of the genetic linkage map in A. duranensis ranged from 1081.1 to 2056.5 cM (depending on the mapping program used) when 1054 segregation loci were used for the linkage analysis. Therefore, the different programs, algorithms, and functions used for mapping may explain the differences in map length reported by the present and previous studies. Our preliminary analysis, in which MapMaker program47 gave longer map lengths than the JoinMap, also supported these explanations. Alternatively, as Sim et al.48 suggested (based on linkage analysis in tomato), different ratios between the number of markers and population size in each population might have resulted in the length differences.Segregation distortions were observed in the three maps, the AF5, BF6, and TF6, and the ratios were different among the populations and LGs (Table 1). Similar observations were found in our previous studies on tomato on which high and low ratios of segregation distortion were observed in inter- and intraspecific maps, respectively.49,50 Segregation distortion is generally caused by the chromosomal structural differences or the presence of transmission ration distorter factors on some chromosome.51 Our findings will contribute to identify factors for the segregation distortion.4.3. Characterization of the cultivated peanut genome using the Arachis consensus mapThe consensus map was constructed using segregation data from 16 populations, in which five species, A. duranensis (A), A. stenosperma (A), A. ipaënsis (B), A. magna (B), and A. hypogaea (AB), were involved (Supplementary Table S2). A total of 889 loci derived from 421 markers were commonly mapped onto all of the paired LGs as HGs; however, the locus orders were not always conserved. The regions in which mapped loci showed non-corresponding orders between the paired LGs in each HG were considered as candidate regions having A or B genome-specific structures. Most of the locus orders were conserved between AA (diploid) and A (tetraploid) LGs, or between BB (diploid) and B (tetraploid) LGs (Fig. 2). However, several regions showed evidence of rearrangement, such as between BB03 and B03, BB09 and B09, and AA10 and A10. Arachis duranensis and A. ipaënsis are considered to be the most probable ancestors of A. hypogaea, because of similar karyotypes of A. duranensis and A. ipaënsis to that of A. hypogaea.12–15 By contrast, even though the structures of A genome of different species are well conserved, the A. stenosperma genome is distinguishable from that of A. duranensis on the basis of the variability observed in the heterochromatin and 18S–26S rRNA loci.13 It is considered the possibility that such differences in the genome structure of the parental lines of the mapping populations might disrupt the marker order between diploid and tetraploid consensus maps.The average marker density of the consensus map was 0.7 cM/locus (Table 2). Because the genome size of A. hypogaea is estimated to be ~2.8 Gb,16 the DNA markers were located at <760 kb intervals on average. In other words, a map-based cloning strategy has become a realistic approach for molecular genetics in Arachis spp., because a candidate region for the location of a target gene can, on average, be identified to within 760 kb. Furthermore, this high-density map should aid in genome sequencing analysis in Arachis spp., because the locus order can work as a reference for the orientation of sequence contigs and scaffolds. Moreover, the marker clusters were observed in all of the LGs (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table S3). Because chromosomal crossover, and the resulting genetic recombination, are severely suppressed in heterochromatin,6,49 the clustered regions were speculated to be located in heterochromatin, which makes up 10–20% of the Arachis chromosomes in somatic metaphase.13,15 In the case of soybean, broad pericentromeric regions show markedly diminished recombination (4.2 Mb/cM), while the euchromatic regions at the chromosome ends maintain consistent levels of recombination (193 kb/cM).6 This pattern is also observed in tomato, with 6042 and 172 kb/cM in heterochromatic and euchromatic regions, respectively.49 As with soybean and tomato, it was predicted that the physical marker-to-marker distance intervals in the peanut genome were different between heterochromatic and euchromatic regions.4.4. Comparative genomics of Arachis spp. with C. cajan, G. max, L. japonicus, and M. truncatulaAll of the Arachis HGs showed similarities to the genomes of the four legumes (Fig. 3, Table 3, and Supplementary Table S2). The genetic composition of Arachis corresponded to that of the C. cajan, L. japonicus, and M. truncatula genomes on a one-on-one basis, but was doubled when compared with the G. max genome. These observations support the estimation that a whole-genome duplication occurred in legumes ~58 million years ago (mya), at the time of the Papilionoid origin,52 whereas the soybean-specific duplication is estimated to have occurred <13 mya.6 These insights are based on a comparison of the A genome species between Arachis and L. japonicus and M. truncatula.39At the chromosome level, each chromosome of Arachis, which belongs to the Dalbergioids, might have evolved differently and show different rearrangements from those in the ancestral chromosomes of the legumes after isolation from the other subfamilies, the Phaseoloids and Galegoids, ~55 mya.52 Of the 10 Arachis HGs, HG01, 05, 07 and 09 showed microsyntenies with the chromosomes of C. cajan, L. japonicus, and M. truncatula. This suggested the possibility that the major chromosome rearrangements did not occur after the time of divergence of subfamilies in the Papilionoideae. By contrast, HG02 showed the most disparate syntenies with the genomes of C. cajan, G. max, L. japonicus, and M. truncatula (Table 3), which suggested frequent chromosome rearrangement.5. ConclusionIn this study, we developed three linkage maps for Arachis spp., and anchored the LGs to the A and B genomes. Integration of the tetraploid maps developed in this study with the 13 previously published studies generated a high-density consensus map of tetraploid Arachis. The developed maps identified structural features within the Arachis genome using comparative genomic analysis, and also identified differences between the Arachis genome and that of other legumes, C. cajan, G. max, L. japonicus, and M. truncatula. The results obtained in this study will bridge the gaps in our knowledge regarding the genomes of Arachis and other legumes, and will further the genetic/genomic study and molecular breeding of Arachis.5.1.

IntroductionMicroorganisms are extremely diverse and crucial for healthy, functioning biospheres.1,2 Although studies of isolated species have produced a great deal of information about microbial genetics, physiology, biotechnology and molecular biology, the diversity and structure of complex microbial communities are still poorly understood. This deficiency results from the inability to culture most microorganisms using standard microbiological techniques.1,3 Consequently, although there are most likely millions of bacterial species on the planet, only a few thousand have been formally described.4Culture-independent techniques, such as metagenomics,5 circumvent the problem of unculturability and transcend previous studies on individual organisms to focus on microbial communities present in an environment. Metagenomics has enriched our knowledge of environmental microbiology through the structural (gene/species richness and distribution)6 and functional (metabolic)7 profiling of complex environmental microbial communities. Based on unselective (shotgun) or targeted (activity driven and sequence driven) methods, metagenomics links genome information with structure and function relationships within microbial populations.8,9Recently developed next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies recover genetic materials from environmental samples without the preparation of metagenomic clone libraries.10 Furthermore, they explore a greater amount of sequence information because they have higher throughput and lower costs than other methods.11 Nevertheless, Quince et al.12 showed that covering 90% of the species richness in some hyper-diverse environments could require 10—1000-fold increases in the current NGS sequencing efforts. In addition, the massive amount of short metagenomic sequence reads (between 20 and 700 bases depending on the platform) can be problematic for assembling and identifying complete coding DNA sequence and/or operon structure.13 One promising alternative is to reduce the environmental sample complexity by enriching the desired genomic target before sequencing.Currently, several strategies of genomic-scale sequence enrichment have been reported.14 The more efficient methods rely on complementary nucleic acid capture probes that hybridize to the targeted DNA sequences. Two hybridization methods—solid phase15–17 and solution phase, also known as solution hybrid selection (SHS)18,19—can be used to ascertain genetic variation by specifically enriching and resequencing regions from complex eukaryotic genomes.To the best of our knowledge, only high-throughput enrichment methods based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have been applied to target functional genes in complex environments.20 Because no current methods use oligonucleotide capture probes to specifically enrich targeted genes from a complex environmental genomic DNA (gDNA), we applied this methodology in the context of microbial ecology (Fig. 1A) to specifically capture DNA fragments harbouring known or unknown genetic biomarkers of interest (Fig. 1B). We hypothesized that the use of variant specific and explorative probes21,22 would more accurately define the overall biomarker diversity (including the rare biosphere and unknown sequences) and would facilitate the discovery of genes linked to the target sequences via the reconstruction of adjacent DNA regions. This method should lead to better diversity coverage that is not influenced by PCR biases, as generally occurs in amplicon sequencing.23,24 Because it is not limited to a specific DNA region (as in PCR enrichment), this strategy will increase the sequence coverage over target regions and lower the cost per target when compared with shotgun sequencing. Schematic comparison of targeted capture methods applied to classical direct selection method of individual genomic loci (human for instance) (A) and our new approach for metagenomics targeting (B). The enrichment through microarray and the SHS of large genomic regions within complex eukaryotic genomes, as described in A, uses specific tiling probes to target resequencing genomic loci for copy number variation (CNV) and single nucleotide polymorphism detection. Our SHS method (B) uses the design of specific variants and explorative probes across a targeted biomarker to specifically enrich large DNA fragments from complex metagenomic DNA. Captured DNA fragments are sequenced to explore biomarker diversity and adjacent flanking regions. The red rectangles indicate the targeted regions.Schematic comparison of targeted capture methods applied to classical direct selection method of individual genomic loci (human for instance) (A) and our new approach for metagenomics targeting (B).

The red rectangles indicate the targeted regions.In the present study, we describe the first adaptation of the SHS capture method for the selective enrichment of a target-specific biomarker from a complex environmental metagenome. Methane (CH4) is an important radiative trace gas responsible for the greenhouse effect, and a significant proportion (6–16%) of the global natural methane emissions are released from freshwater lakes.25 We surveyed the methanogen diversity in a permanently stratified crater lake located in the French Massif Central (Lake Pavin). This original freshwater ecosystem is composed of an anoxic deep water layer (monimolimnion, ~60–90 m depth) separated from the oxygenated upper layer (mixolimnion) by an intermediate layer (mesolimnion),26 where both the sediments and the anoxic water column contribute to methane production.27 We targeted the gene coding for the a-subunit of the methyl coenzyme M reductase (mcrA) that is involved in the final step of methanogenesis. This gene is arranged in a single transcriptional unit—the mcr operon—that is highly conserved among all methanogens.28,29 To highlight the broad benefits of the gene capture approach when compared with the more classical sequencing methods, three methods were used for pyrosequencing of an environmental sample: the SHS method, a classical random-shotgun metagenomic approach and an mcrA-targeted amplicon sequencing survey.2. Materials and methods2.1. Capture probe design and synthesisTwo sets of capture probes were designed. The first set targeted the mcrA gene from the Methanosarcina acetivorans C2A genome (GenBank accession no. AE010299), and the second set targeted the mcrA sequences pooled from environmental samples. The first set of capture probes consisted of six high specific 50-mer probes (P1–P6) targeting six distinct regions of the M. acetivorans C2A mcrA gene (Fig. 2, Supplementary Table S1). These probes were designed with HiSpOD software.30 Adaptor sequences were added at each end, resulting in 80-mer hybrid probes consisting of 5'-ATCGCACCAGCGTGT(X)50CACTGCGGCTCCTCA-3', with X50 indicating the specific capture probe.

(Belgium). The RNA probe was prepared as described by Gnirke et al.192.2. Preparation of biological samples and librariesThe two biological models used in this study were the M. acetivorans C2A strain (DSM 2834) and Lake Pavin, located in the French Massif Central (45°29'74""N, 2°53'28""E). The M. acetivorans C2A strain was cultivated using the medium 304 (http://www.dsmz.de/microorganisms/medium/pdf/DSMZ_Medium304.pdf) according to the manufacturer's instructions. gDNA from the strain was extracted using the Easy DNA kit (Invitrogen), whereas environmental DNA was extracted from 350 ml of freshwater collected from Lake Pavin at a 90-m depth, as described by Dugat-Bony et al.30Libraries were prepared using Roche's GS FLX Titanium General Library Preparation Kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. First, 5 µg of DNA was sheared by nebulization. DNA fragments were size selected with AMPure beads (Beckman Coulter Genomics). After purification, fragment end polishing, adaptor ligation (A and B adapter keys; Supplementary Table S1) and fill-in reactions, the libraries were PCR amplified with the 454 Ti-A and 454 Ti-B primers (Supplementary Table S1). The cycle conditions were 3 min at 93°C followed by 20 cycles of 15 s at 93°C, 1 min at 58°C and 8 min at 68°C and a final elongation step at 68°C for 6 min. The amplified libraries were purified with AMPure beads and stored at -20°C until use.For the amplicon library, mcrA fragments were PCR amplified from total community DNA with the mcrA-specific primer pair MM_01/MM_0231 (Supplementary Table S1). The amplicon was run on a 2% (wt/vol) agarose gel, and the ~500 bp product was purified with a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen) and AMPure beads. Each DNA library was quantified by fluorometry with a Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA assay kit (Invitrogen). The DNA quality and size distribution were assessed on an Agilent Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA chip (Agilent Technologies).2.3. Hybridization capture and elutionFor each SHS-capture method library, 2.5 µg of salmon sperm DNA (Ambion) and 500 ng of DNA library were mixed (7 µl final volume), denatured for 5 min at 95°C, incubated for 5 min at 65°C before adding 13 µl of prewarmed (65°C) hybridization buffer (10X SSPE, 10X Denhardt's Solution, 10 mM EDTA and 0.2% SDS) and 6 µl freshly prepared, prewarmed (2 min at 65°C) biotinylated RNA probes (500 ng). After 24 h at 65°C, 500 ng of washed M-280 Dynabeads coated with streptavidin (Invitrogen) were added to the hybridization mix that was incubated for 30 min at room temperature (RT). The beads were precipitated with a magnetic stand (Ambion) and washed once for 15 min at RT with 500 µl 1X SSC/0.1% SDS and three times for 10 min at 65°C with 500 µl prewarmed 0.1X SSC/0.1% SDS. The captured DNA was eluted with 50 µl 0.1 M NaOH for 10 min at RT. After magnetic bead precipitation, the DNA supernatant was transferred to a sterile tube containing 70 µl of 1 M Tris–HCl pH 7.5, purified on a QIAquick column (Qiagen) and eluted in a final volume of 20 µl. A 2.5 µl aliquot was subjected to 15 cycles of PCR amplification using the 454 Ti-A and Ti-B primers as described above. After purification, a second round of capture was performed from each first-round PCR product. To increase the DNA yield, a final PCR amplification consisting of 20 cycles was performed. The final product was purified on a QIAquick column (Qiagen) and quantified with a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies).2.4. Sanger sequencing and data analysisPCR products were cloned using the TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). Plasmids were screened for high-size inserts by digestion with EcoRI, and positive clones were Sanger sequenced at MWG DNA sequencing services (Ebersberg, Germany). Sequences were processed and joined using the Staden package program,32 and primer sequences were removed from paired-end consensus sequences. The mcr sequence data retrieved from Lake Pavin by the SHS method were deposited in the GenBank database under accession numbers JQ404494, JQ404495, JQ404496, JQ404497 and JQ404498, and the sequence of the mcrA-fmd region-spanning fragment was deposited under accession number JQ425691.2.5. 454 GS FLX Titanium sequencing and data analysisDNA samples were sequenced using the GS FLX Titanium system on the ‘GINA’ platform (part of the GENTYANE platform, labelled IBISA since 2009; BP 392, 63 011 Clermont-Ferrand, France) at the Centre Jean Perrin, according to the manufacturer's specifications. For quality filtering and de-replication of reads, sequences were trimmed with the PRINSEQ-lite PERL script33 using the parameters described in the preprocessing chart (http://prinseq.sourceforge.net/Preprocessing_454_SFF_chart.pdf).Functional assignment and enrichment were assessed with a BLASTX query34 against a database containing 12 603 McrA protein sequences downloaded from the Genbank database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), using WWW-Query (http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/search/query_fam.php) to perform an advanced keyword search. Reads showing >40% identity over 100 or more amino acids were classified as McrA sequences. Chimaera detection was performed with the UCHIME program35 with a stringent threshold score of five. Sequences containing possible frameshifts were identified with the ‘–w 20’ BLAST option and disabled low complexity filters. Amino acid sequences without frameshifts were extracted from the BLAST results, and only the sequences that passed this filter were chosen for further phylogenetic analysis.The sequence data were deposited in the NCBI as a Short Read Archive (SRA) project under accession no. SRA049219.2.6. Phylogenetic analysis and tree constructionAll McrA sequences derived from the SHS method and metagenomic libraries were aligned to a sequence obtained from the amplicon library. The amino acid alignment used the ClustalW2 alignment method36 driven by the Seaview version 4 program37 to select the reads having at least 100 amino acids in common with this reference sequence. The overlapping regions of the remaining amino acid sequences, all amplicon pyrosequences and 29 McrA sequences previously identified from the same sampling depth and downloaded from GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) were fed to CD-HIT38 that assigned them to operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using a complete linkage clustering method at a 91% cut-off value.27,39One representative sequence of each OTU was chosen to build a phylogenetic tree (Seaview 4)37 using the neighbour-joining method40,41 and 1000 bootstrapped trials. Closely related sequences available from GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) were included in the phylogenetic trees to decipher the microbial community diversity. A final tree was drawn in MEGA version 5.422.7. qPCR assays for enrichment and methanogen abundanceThe assays were conducted in 20 µl with 5 µl of DNA sample or mcrA PCR product standards (covering a dynamic range of 5 × 107 to 50 copies), 10 µl of 2X MESA Green quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) for SYBR assay mixture (Eurogentec S.A) and 0.2 µM forward and reverse primers. The thermo cycling protocol included an initial step of 95°C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 15 s, annealing at the melting temperature of each primer set for 15 s and elongation at 68°C for 30 s. The samples and each point of the standard curve were quantified in triplicate. The primer sets are described in Supplementary Table S3. The data were analysed with Realplex software version 1.5 (Eppendorf Inc.) and MxPro qPCR software 4.10d (Agilent technologies). Based on the <U+0394><U+0394>Ct method,43 relative enrichments (R) were calculated according to R = 2-<U+0394><U+0394>Ct. The relative quantification method established a mean Ct value comparison (<U+0394>Ct) between mcrA (target gene) and fmdA (non-target gene 500 kb upstream from mcrA). The relative capture enrichment was determined by the comparison of <U+0394>Ct before and after capture, and this result described the fold change or <U+0394><U+0394>Ct.2.8. SHS de novo read assemblyThe filtered SHS reads were assembled with Newbler version 2.6 (Roche Applied Science) using stringent assembly parameters (60 bases overlap and 95% overlap identity) and the ‘- rip’ option that forces Newbler to place each read into one unique contig. The functional assignment of contigs and singletons was performed by a BLASTX query34 against our database containing 12 603 McrA protein sequences. Chimaeras were detected in the mcrA contigs and singletons with the UCHIME program35 and a stringent threshold score of five. Prediction of the mcrA gene location within contigs and singletons was performed by BLASTN44 against the reference genomes of Candidatus Methanoregula boonei 6A8 (Methanomicrobiales order, accession no. NC_009712), Methanosaeta concilii GP-6 (Methanosarcinales order, accession no. CP002565) and Methanosphaera stadtmanae DSM 3091 (Methanobacteriales order, accession no. CP000102). Contigs extending at least 100 nucleotides beyond mcrA were segregated for BLASTX34 analysis against the non-redundant (nr) protein sequences database to identify putative open-reading frames within the flanking regions.The sequence data from homologous mcrA contigs (without chimaeras or frameshifts) were deposited in the GenBank database under accession no. KC184908 to KC185399.3. Results3.1. Development of an SHS method for genomic-scale sequence enrichmentWe performed the initial validation of our enrichment strategy by capturing the mcrA gene from a 1 to 3 kb fragment library of the completely sequenced methanogenic M. acetivorans C2A strain. The minimal probe set spanned different non-overlapping regions of the gene (Fig. 2A). The qPCR reactions revealed a 461-fold relative enrichment of mcrA sequences after the first cycle of capture and at least 175 365-fold enrichment after the second cycle. Furthermore, as the M. acetivorans C2A genome consists of 5751 kb with a single mcrA gene copy, the probability of randomly sequencing this gene from a 1 to 3 kb fragment size clone library is 0.02–0.05%. Using our solution-based DNA capture-enrichment method and working on an isolated species, the likelihood increased from 7.8 to 23% after the first cycle and could reach 100% after the second.The DNA sequence of fragments retrieved after the second cycle of capture was controlled by the cloning-sequencing method. Six clones were sequenced, and all had a perfect correspondence to the mcrA gene from M. acetivorans C2A, reinforcing the efficiency of the two iterative cycles of capture. The captured fragments were assembled into a 1834-bp contig containing the nearly complete mcrA gene (1645 bp) and its 3' non-coding region (189 bp). After validating this approach, we further tested the performance of the method by enriching mcrA sequences from a complex methanogenic freshwater environment.The freshwater sample was collected in the anoxic zone at 90 m depth, where the highest methanogen diversity was available in the lacustrine environment.27 An improved mcrA probe set included all known mcrA sequences and targeted new variants with explorative probes (Supplementary Table S2). The efficiency of the mcrA enrichment was determined by cloning and sequencing the second capture product. Five out of the ten clones with large inserts (2041–2493 bp) included mcrA sequences. All positive clones had a ~1500 bp common zone corresponding to the mcrA gene, but they also harboured upstream or downstream regions containing other genes (Fig. 2B). BLAST analysis of the cloned sequences revealed that they are very similar (99% similarity) to mcrA sequences previously retrieved from this ecosystem (accession nos. GQ389949, GQ389912 and GQ389806).27 The closest relative to the mcrA, mcrG and partial mcrC sequences were from a cultured methanogen, Candidatus Methanoregula boonei 6A8 (>85, 84 and 81% similarity, respectively). This hydrogenotrophic species belongs to the Methanomicrobiales order, and it was isolated from an acidic peat bog.45 Furthermore, the fmdC gene fragment identified 821 bp downstream the target gene (Fig. 2B) that shared 77% identity with subunit C of the formyl methanofuran dehydrogenase gene of this species. This gene has been located in the reference genome (GenBank: CP000780.1) at almost 300 kb from the mcr operon. It should be noted that this genome organization—with the fmd operon located just downstream from the mcr operon—has not been described previously in methanogens. To exclude the possibility of chimaera formation during metagenomic library amplification, a PCR fragment spanning the mcrA–fmdC region was obtained directly from the initial metagenomic DNA sample, using two specific primers (Fig. 2B, Supplementary Table S1). The sequenced 821 bp PCR product (JQ425691) confirmed the organization revealed by the SHS method (100% identity with the captured DNA fragment).Our results showed that the capture method not only efficiently enriched targets out of a complex environmental genomic mixture, but also recovered sequences adjacent to the targeted biomarker gene. Additionally, the SHS method was coupled with NGS technologies to assess the coverage of archaeal mcrA diversity in a complex ecosystem.3.2. Metagenome exploration with genome-scale sequence enrichment and NGSThe benefit of the SHS method in terms of diversity coverage, when compared with more classical approaches, was further examined by sequencing the SHS capture products. A new random-shotgun DNA metagenomic library adapted for pyrosequencing (fragment sizes ~500 bp) was prepared for the SHS products and for direct sequencing (shotgun metagenomics approach). From the same metagenomic DNA sample, mcrA PCR products were also amplified with the primer set MM_01-MM_02,31 generating amplicons of ~500 bp. Sequencing (captured DNA fragments, metagenome and amplicons) was performed with the 454 GS FLX Titanium technology, generating a slightly different amount of raw data with an average read length of 414–471 bases. After pre-processing, sequencing datasets from all three approaches had nearly equivalent numbers of reads (Table 1). Summary statistics from 454 pyrosequencingaBLASTX parameters: percentage of identity: 40%; E-value cut-off: 10.bMcrA sequences related to OTUs containing more than one sequence.Summary statistics from 454 pyrosequencingaBLASTX parameters: percentage of identity: 40%; E-value cut-off: 10.bMcrA sequences related to OTUs containing more than one sequence.Only three reads (0.003% of total reads) from the random-shotgun sequencing approach corresponded to the mcrA gene. For the SHS method, 50 727 reads were identified as mcrA sequences (41.32%), and almost all the amplicon approach sequences were from mcrA (119 409 reads, 99.98%).For mcrA diversity evaluation, however, we only analysed high-quality sequences (no chimaeras or frameshifts), and all the problematic reads were subsequently excluded.The phylogeny of the methanogenic McrA protein sequences was investigated and compared for each of the three approaches. We used ClustalW236 to determine a common reference region of 143 amino acids shared by the largest number of McrA sequences retrieved from the 3 approaches. All McrA sequences that included this region were truncated so that at least 100 amino acids aligned with this reference. The resulting sequences, which included 1 read from the shotgun library, 11 442 reads from the SHS method library and 38 807 reads from the amplicon library, were used for further analysis. Furthermore, 29 additional sequences (referred to as Pavin90m) from a previous study27 were included in the analysis.Following the clustering method, 127 distinct OTUs (longer than 300 bp) were observed, and the 58 OTUs that contained more than 1 sequence were included in a more detailed phylogenetic analysis. The shotgun library sequence, which contained a single final read, was also included. Among these 58 OTUs, 44 were detected from the SHS method, 40 from the amplicon approach, 1 from the metagenomic shotgun library and 3 from Pavin90m sequences. The SHS method and amplicons shared 27 OTUs, including 3 from the Pavin90m sequences (Fig. 3). The remaining 31 OTUs were specific to a single method, with 1 for the metagenome, 17 for the SHS and 13 for the amplicons (Fig. 3).

Most OTUs were closely related to the Methanomicrobiales order (48 OTUs, 98.6% of the total input sequences). OTU3, OTU10 and OTU17 formed a distinct branch within this cluster (Fig. 4A), and they were closely related to cultured methanogenic species that also have an insertion in their McrA protein sequence (Supplementary Fig. S2). Both the SHS and amplicon strategies clustered sequences in the most abundant OTUs (Fig. 5). These abundant OTUs represented 94 and 98%, respectively, of the total sequences for each approach. The Methanosarcinales (two OTUs; Fig. 4B) grouped into two distinct branches were related to the reference acetoclastic species M. concilii GP6 (85 and 87% similarity with OTU9 and OTU18, respectively). The most abundant cluster was OTU9 that represented 0.83% of the total SHS reads and 0.005% for the total amplicon reads (Fig. 5). In contrast, the putative Novel Order (five OTUs; Fig. 4C) was dominated by OTU13 clustering with 1.39% of the total amplicons sequences, but only 0.13% of the total SHS reads (Fig. 5). Even if we did not include the more recently described sequences of Methanomassiliicoccus luminyensis46 and Candidatus Methanomethylophilus alvus47 belonging to the novel order for the probe design, distant sequences could be captured with probes by a mismatched nucleotide pairing. We cannot exclude that the sequences captured by specific probes allow indirect hybridization of other mcrA sequences as described for DNA microarrays experiments and referred to as ‘hitchhiking’.48 Despite the substantial sequencing effort for amplicons, no sequences belonging to the Methanobacteriales order were recovered from this approach. These sequences were obtained only from the SHS sample (Fig. 4D), and they were clustered in three OTUs such that one was 90% similar to MrtA (MCR isoenzyme encoded by the mrt operon) from M. stadtmanae DSM 309149 and the remaining two were 77 and 79% identical to MrtA sequences from Methanobacterium lacus that is in the Methanobacteriales order and has been isolated from Lake Pavin sediments.50 These sequences represented 0.19% of total SHS mcrA-related sequences, with the most abundant OTU78 clustering 0.11% of the total SHS reads (Fig. 5).

Bold arrows indicate dominant OTUs.The relative abundances of dominant OTUs from four methanogenic bacterial orders identified by the targeted capture method (SHS), PCR-based strategy (amplicons) and qPCR experiments (qPCR). The relative abundances calculated by qPCR were computed using mcrA copy number as reference obtained using a primers pair targeting all OTUs (Supplementary Table S3).The relative abundances of dominant OTUs from four methanogenic bacterial orders identified by the targeted capture method (SHS), PCR-based strategy (amplicons) and qPCR experiments (qPCR). The relative abundances calculated by qPCR were computed using mcrA copy number as reference obtained using a primers pair targeting all OTUs (Supplementary Table S3).The GC content of the mcrA genes ranged from 50.4 to 61.1% for amplicons and from 37 to 63.2% for SHS. In the mcrA database, the GC content ranges from 36.2 to 67.2%, indicating that the SHS method is most likely less affected by GC composition than PCR approaches. Furthermore, we evaluated the presence of mismatch residues between PCR primers and probes on mcrA genes in both SHS and amplicon approaches. We identified 99.10, 0.77 and 0.13% of mcrA sequences for amplicons versus 37.68, 50.22 and 12.10% for SHS with 0, 1 and 2 mismatch residues, respectively, between probes (or primers) and sequences. This trend highlights the potential advantage of the SHS approach with long capture probes that tolerate more mismatches, allowing access to new mcrA gene variants.In parallel, qPCR was used to precisely describe the methanogen abundance in Lake Pavin with regard to the most abundant OTUs and bacterial orders (primers are listed in Supplementary Table S3). The results were compared with the relative sequence abundance calculated previously for the selected OTUs with amplicons and SHS (Fig. 5). The abundance of OTU2, which included the Methanomicrobiales order, was similar in qPCR and amplicons (33.5 and 28.62%), but not SHS (11.87%). In contrast, the second Methanomicrobiales OTU (OTU7) was more abundant in SHS (8.02%) and qPCR (3.6%), but not amplicons (0.05%). The same trend was observed for OTU9 (Methanosarcinales). No significant difference was observed for OTU13 (Novel Order). Finally, no qPCR amplification of OTU78 (Methanobacteriales) occurred. However, we validated the presence of this OTU in Lake Pavin by successive PCR cycles, cloning and sequencing (100% identity). This result indicates that Methanobacteriales are rare in this ecosystem.To reconstruct contigs with sequences flanking the targeted mcrA gene, de novo assembly was performed using the pyrosequencing reads obtained by the SHS method (Table 2). We identified 691 contigs (301–1639 bases) with mcrA sequences. By mapping these sequences to complete reference genomes for the Methanomicrobiales, Methanosarcinales and Methanobacteriales orders (no genome was available for the Novel Order), we identified contigs extending into the mcrA flanking regions. The upstream sequences were all part of the mcrG gene. We also characterized two adjacent ORFs located at 200 bases downstream from the mcrA gene and in the same orientation; these ORFs encoded a DtxR family iron (metal)-dependent repressor and a DOMON domain-containing protein. The DtxR sequences were closely related (76–83% identity) to Methanosphaerula palustris E1-9C (accession no. ACL16981) of the Methanomicrobiales order. In the reference genome of this species, the gene is located ~700 kb downstream of the mcr operon. The sequences of DOMON domain-containing protein are closely related (74–80% identity) to M. concilii GP-6 (accession no. AEB67518) that belongs to the Methanosarcinales order. In the reference genome of this species, the gene is located ~50 kb downstream of the mcr operon.

DiscussionWe captured specific target DNA from a complex environmental metagenome using a novel SHS capture method and NGS. We showed that the relative enrichment of the target sequence was increased to 175 365-fold with 2 cycles of capture, and this result was superior to previous studies using a single cycle18,19 and microarray-based capture.51 We applied this strategy to the anoxic layer of Lake Pavin, where Archaea account for 17% of 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-stained cells52 and only a fraction of these microbes are methanogens. Our SHS strategy specifically enriched mcrA sequences from the environmental sample. In comparison with the random-shotgun metagenomic approach (0.003% recovery of mcrA sequences), the SHS method was superior (41.32% mcrA sequence enrichment). However, the capture efficiency is also likely influenced by the number of probes used per region and the mismatched residues between the probes and their targets. Consequently, two rounds of capture and multiple long RNA probes are advantageous for efficient enrichment.With a random-shotgun metagenomics approach, many hundreds of thousands of additional single reads would have been necessary to estimate the biodiversity of the methanogen community in this environment. The SHS experiment contained much more mcrA data and provided a solid taxonomic basis for studying methanogens diversity. Finally, PCR was the most effective enrichment approach; with ~100% of the amplicons corresponding to the biomarker, the primers used were very specific and efficient.31The SHS and amplicon strategies both revealed similar patterns in methanogen communities such as the high abundance and diversity of Methanomicrobiales sequences (more than 98% of the total sequences representing 48 OTUs). These data confirm a previous study by Biderre-Petit et al.27 High-throughput sequencing, however, reveals that methanogen diversity is much higher than previously estimated by amplicon libraries and Sanger sequencing.27 Importantly, the amplicon sequencing approach missed all the Methanobacteriales taxonomic groups and some Methanosarcinales, possibly due to mcrA primer bias. PCR undersampling often leads to significant underestimation of true community diversity.24,53 SHS efficiently targets rare sequences, as demonstrated for Methanobacteriales, and does not appear to be influenced by GC content. As previously demonstrated for microarray approaches,21,22,54 more extensive explorative capture probe sets could recover rare sequences, leading to the detection of many uncharacterized microbial populations. Moreover, the SHS and amplicon library results were correlated by qPCR.We also used de novo assembly of SHS sequence reads to explore the regions flanking the target gene, and we identified two ORFs (dtxR and DOMON domain) at previously unknown positions downstream of mcrA. Because this genomic organization may link methanogenesis to electron transfer and Fe homeostasis in organisms living in the anoxic layer of the Lake Pavin, it could reflect adaptation to this particular environment. More experiments are needed, however, to validate this hypothesis.In this study, we present a novel enrichment method that, when coupled to NGS, expands our knowledge of the diversity of a target gene within a complex microbial community. The method was successfully applied to a lacustrine environment using the mcrA gene, and it revealed higher methanogen community diversity than observed with other methods. To some extent, this method could be applied to phylogenetic studies to explore the diversity of commonly conserved genes such as the 16S rRNA biomarker. The main limitation is the design of high quality probes sets to expect a full coverage of 16S rDNA sequences as complete as possible. New algorithms, such as KASpOD,55 can be used to design highly specific and explorative probes (i.e. targeting sequences not already included in databases) based on oligonucleotide k-mer signatures. These probe designs would be extremely suitable and beneficial to the SHS approach.With the emergence of third generation sequencing platforms and the capability to sequence longer DNA sequences without library construction,56,57 the SHS strategy could link genomic structure and function in microbial communities.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available atwww.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by the ANR-09-EBIO-009 project (Agence Nationale de la Recherche).

IntroductionFoxtail millet [(Setaria italica (L.) P. Beauv.; 2n = 18)], a member of the Poaceae family, is the second most-widely planted species of millets, next to pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) (FAOSTAT 2005; http://faostat.fao/org/). It is mainly cultivated in semi-arid regions of India, China and other parts of Asia, North Africa and America. It is a potential model system for biofuel crops due to its small genome size (~515 Mb), less repetitive DNA and self-pollinated nature1–3 and the most important are its close phylogenetic relationships with several biofuel crops such as switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum) and pearl millet (P. glaucum). Furthermore, foxtail millet is an excellent genetic system to study evolution and physiology of C4 photosynthesis and abiotic stress tolerance mechanism particularly for salinity and dehydration stresses.2–4 Recently, the Joint Genome Institute of the Department of Energy, USA and Beijing Genomics Institute, China have sequenced the genome of two foxtail millet accessions.5,6 The sequence-based comparative genome mapping has revealed a high degree of syntenic relationship of foxtail millet with rice and sorghum, in spite of their divergence more than 50 million years ago.7 With the availability of genome-wide sequence resources in foxtail millet, it is now required to develop and validate useful sequence-based genetic markers and genes in a larger genotype sets and utilize them in genetic improvement of target millet and its related crop species.Among the available different genetic marker system, the microsatellite markers are considered important in various genetic studies because of their high reproducibility, co-dominant inheritance, multi-allelic variation and abundance in the genome.8,9 These desirable characteristics of microsatellite markers had made them advantageous in various applications of structural, functional and comparative genomics, including variety identification, studying genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationships, construction of high-density genome maps, mapping of useful genes, comparative genome mapping and marker-assisted selection.10–15 Till now, a total of 218 genic and genomic microsatellite markers have been developed from Expressed Sequence Tag sequences (26)16, random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-enriched genomic sequences from GenBank (45)14 and microsatellite-enriched genomic libraries (147)15 in foxtail millet. The availability of limited EST sequence resources and involvement of huge cost, time and labor in mining microsatellite markers from enriched genomic libraries have impeded the development of large-scale microsatellite markers in foxtail millet. However, foxtail millet with large genome size would require a large number of microsatellite markers for construction of high-density genetic linkage map and identification and mapping of genes/quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for useful agronomic traits.A large number of microsatellite markers have been developed by utilizing the pseudomolecule genomic sequences from the completely sequenced plant genomes, including rice (IRGSP 2005, http://rgp.dna.affrc.go.jp/IRGSP/), Populus (genome.jgi.doe.gov/poplar/), sorghum (genome.jgi-psf.org/Sorbi1/Sorbi1.home.htm), maize (mips.helmholtz-muenchen.de/plant/maize/) and Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis Genome Initiative 2001, http://www.arabidopsis.org/), and these markers were further utilized in genome mapping and genotyping applications in target crop species. A similar approach has been implemented in rice, sorghum, Brachypodium, Brassica and Arabidopsis for the development of thousands of microsatellite markers from whole genome sequences.12,13,17–19 Unfortunately, no such marker resource is currently available for recently sequenced foxtail millet genome. With the availability of foxtail millet whole genome sequence in public domain, it is now possible to mine and develop large-scale in silico microsatellite markers that could be utilized for various applications of structural and comparative genomics in foxtail millet. The development and large-scale validation of such genomic microsatellite markers in a genome-wide scale could be useful for not only genetic improvement of foxtail millet, but also for other under-utilized/orphan crop species for which very little or no genomic information is available.Considering the utility of whole genome sequence-based microsatellite markers, we made an attempt to develop and validate microsatellite markers from foxtail millet genome sequences and determine their genomic distribution on foxtail millet genome. Furthermore, a selected set of validated and physically mapped markers were utilized in evaluating polymorphic and diversity potential in foxtail millet accessions, studying cross-transferability across millet and non-millet species and in silico comparative genome mapping among foxtail millet and three members of grass family.2. Materials and methods2.1. Identification of microsatellites and primer designThe whole genome sequences of S. italica were retrieved from Phytozome (http://www.phytozome.net) and searched for microsatellites using the default parameter of MIcroSAtellite (MISA) identification tool (http://pgrc.ipk-gatersleben.de/misa). The search criteria were: six repeat units for dinucleotide repeats (DNRs), five repeat units for trinucleotide repeats (TNRs), tetranucleotide repeats (TeNRs), pentanucleotide repeats (PNRs) and hexanucleotide repeats (HNRs). The forward and reverse primers flanking the identified microsatellite repeat motifs were designed in batches using the default parameters of integrated Perl 5 interface module of MISA-Primer3 software (http://pgrc.ipk-gatersleben.de/misa/primer3.html).2.2. Physical mapping of foxtail millet genomic microsatellite markersFor determining the specific physical location (bp) of designed microsatellite markers on the nine foxtail millet chromosomes, the flanking genomic sequences of identified microsatellite repeat motifs were BLAST searched against the whole genome sequence of foxtail millet at Phytozome (http://www.phytozome.net). Optimized BLASTN search parameters with E-value = 0 and low-complexity filter options were used for this analysis. The microsatellite markers were plotted separately for each of the nine foxtail millet chromosomes according to their ascending order of physical position (bp), from the short arm telomere to the long arm telomere and finally visualized in MapChart software.202.3. Validation of genomic microsatellite markersFor validation of selected set of physically mapped microsatellite markers distributed over nine chromosomes of foxtail millet, the genomic DNA was isolated from the leaves of eight foxtail millet accessions (Table 1) using CTAB method. The isolated genomic DNA was resolved on 0.8% agarose gel (Cambrex, USA) in Tris-borate EDTA (TBE) buffer (pH 8.0), quantified using different concentration of <U+03BB> DNA standard and analysed in the GelDoc-It imaging system (UVP, Cambridge, UK). The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out in MyCycler thermal controller (Bio-Rad) in a 25-µl total volume containing one unit of Taq DNA polymerase (Bangalore Genei), 50 ng of genomic DNA, 10 µmol/l of each primer, 0.5 mmol/l of each dNTPs and 2.5 µl of 10× PCR buffer (Bangalore Genei). DNA amplification was done following the PCR program; a preliminary denaturation of 3 min at 94°C, followed by 40 cycles of 1 min at 94°C, 1.5 min at 48–55°C and 2 min at 72°C and a final extension for 10 min at 72°C. The amplicons were resolved on 2% agarose gel (Cambrex, USA) in TBE buffer (pH 8.0), and analysed in the GelDoc-It imaging system. Standard size marker of 100 bp (NEB) was used to determine the fragment sizes for each markers. One of the markers showing amplification in all the accessions used in the study was cloned and sequenced. For cloning, the amplicons amplified by microsatellite marker were eluted using AccuPrep DNA Gel Purification Kit (Bioneer, Korea) and cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, USA) following the manufacturer's instructions. The plasmids were transformed into competent cells of Escherichia coli DH5a and grown on LB media supplemented with ampicillin (100 µg/ml), X-Gal (20 µg/ml) and IPTG (0.1 M). The transformants were selected based on blue–white screening, and recombinant plasmids were isolated using AccuPrep Plasmid MiniPrep DNA Extraction Kit following the manufacturer's protocol. The plasmids were sequenced in automated sequencer (3730xI DNA Analyzer, Applied Biosystem) using M13 forward and reverse primers. Multiple sequence alignment was performed with the obtained sequences along with reference S. italica sequence using ClustalW2 program (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/clustalw2/index.html). Details of plant materials used in the present studyDetails of plant materials used in the present study2.4. Assessment of genetic diversity pattern and phylogenetic relationshipsThe microsatellite alleles amplified in millets and non-millets were scored in a binary format to infer the molecular diversity and genetic relationship among them. The genetic similarity coefficient was calculated according to Jaccard's coefficient21 using the NTSYS-pc software package (version 2.02e, Exeter Software, Setauket, NY, USA).22 The pairwise similarity matrix of the Jaccard coefficient was used to construct a phylogenetic tree using the neighbor-joining module of NTSYS-pc software.2.5. Comparative genome mapping between foxtail and other grass speciesThe flanking sequences of microsatellite marker loci that were physically mapped on the nine chromosomes of foxtail millet were BLAST searched against genome sequences of sorghum, maize and rice (http://gramene.org/; www.phytozome.net) to derive marker-based syntenic relationships among the chromosomes of foxtail millet and three other grass species. A cutoff bit score of 54.7 and E-value of <1e-05 were considered significant for BLAST analysis. The marker-based syntenic relationships among foxtail millet, rice, sorghum and maize were finally visualized with visualization blocks using Circos 0.55 (http://circos.ca).3. Results and discussion3.1. Frequency, distribution and characterization of microsatellites in foxtail millet genomeThe 405.73 Mb available genome sequences of foxtail millet were searched for microsatellites, and a total of 28 342 microsatellites comprising different kinds of desirable repeat-motifs (from DNRs to HNRs) were identified with average frequency of about 69 microsatellites per megabase of genomic sequences. The frequency and distribution of different microsatellite repeat-motif types in the genomic sequences of foxtail millet are shown in Fig. 1A and Supplementary Table S1. The frequency of microsatellites (69/Mb) estimated in the foxtail millet genomic sequences at genome-wide level is comparable to that documented in Brachypodium (78.5/Mb) genome, but lower than that reported earlier in other related monocot plant genomes such as rice (189.4/Mb) and sorghum (99.8/Mb) and dicot Arabidopsis (127.5/Mb).19 These differences could be due to the variation in search criteria, size of the database and bioinformatics software tools used in different studies for identification of microsatellites.10,11,15,23Analysis of simple sequence repeats from foxtail millet genome. (A) Relative frequency, proportion (%) and number of selected microsatellite repeat-motif types. (B) Different classes of selected microsatellite repeats.Analysis of simple sequence repeats from foxtail millet genome. (A) Relative frequency, proportion (%) and number of selected microsatellite repeat-motif types. (B) Different classes of selected microsatellite repeats.Among the 28 342 microsatellites obtained, the TNRs were the most abundant (13 521) with a proportion of 47.7%, followed by DNRs (13072, 46.1%), TeNRs (1354, 4.8%), PNRs (236, 0.8%) and HNRs (159, 0.56%) (Fig. 1A). The distribution of different microsatellite motifs is not uniform, particularly as in case of TNRs and DNRs. Among DNRs, AG/CT motifs (21.4%) were more frequent, followed by AT/AT (11.9%), AC/GT (9.8%) and GC/CG (2.9%) motifs. Among the TNRs, CCG/CGG (18.3%) motifs were most abundant followed by AGG/CCT (8.1%) and AGC/GCT (5.1%), whereas ACT/AGT (0.7%) motifs were less abundant (Fig. 1B). Based on length of the repeat motifs, a total of 7387 (26%) microsatellites were classified as long and hypervariable class I (=20 bp) types and remaining 20 995 (74%) microsatellites as variable class II (12–19 bp) types. Interestingly, as in case of class I microsatellites, the proportion of DNRs (47%) was higher when compared with TNRs (30%) (Fig. 2). In contrast, in the class II microsatellite types, the proportion of TNRs (54%) was more than that of DNRs (46%). This converse distribution pattern of microsatellite repeat motifs in the foxtail millet genome overall resulted in slightly higher frequency of TNRs when compared with DNRs in this study. Generally, DNRs are reported to be abundant in sequenced plant genomes such as rice, sorghum and Arabidopsis.19,24,25 Conversely, in our study, we observed an abundance of TNRs (47.7%) in foxtail millet genome that agreed well with the earlier reports in Brachypodium,19 bamboo26 and switchgrass.27 The earlier reports of higher frequency of TNRs in the transcribed genic sequence components of the plant genomes suggested that the genomic sequences used in this study for mining microsatellites possibly representing more of expressed sequence components of the foxtail millet genome.10–13 Furthermore, the prevalence of AG/CT (21.4%) dinucleotide and CCG/CGG (18.3%), AGG/CCT (8.1%) and AGC/GCT (5.1%) trinucleotide repeat motifs in the foxtail millet genome is comparable to earlier similar genome-wide microsatellite identification studies in monocot and dicot plant species such as Brachypodium, rice, sorghum and bamboo.19,26Frequency and relative distribution of long and hypervariable class I and variable class II microsatellite repeats in the foxtail millet genome.Frequency and relative distribution of long and hypervariable class I and variable class II microsatellite repeats in the foxtail millet genome.3.2. Development of microsatellite markers and their physical mapping in foxtail millet genomeFrom 28 342 identified microsatellites, forward and reverse primer pairs could be designed from either side of the flanking genomic sequences of 21 294 microsatellites with successful primer designing potential of 75.1%. The primers could not be designed for remaining 7048 (24.9%) microsatellites due to constraint of obtaining enough flanking sequences from either side of identified microsatellites. Similar observations have also been observed in other genome-wide microsatellite mining studies in monocot and dicot crop plants.12,13,19The determination of genomic distribution of 21 294 microsatellite markers on the foxtail millet genome revealed physical localization of 15 573 markers on the 9 chromosomes of foxtail millet with average marker density of 42 markers/Mb (Supplementary Table S2, Supplementary Fig. S1). All the physically mapped 15 573 genomic microsatellite markers were reported in publicly available NCBI Probe Database with Accession numbers from PUID16589829 to PUID 16605401. The average marker density was maximum 46.2/Mb in chromosome 9, followed by 42.8/Mb in chromosome 5 and 41.6/Mb in chromosome 1 and minimum 30/Mb in chromosome 8. The comprehensive analysis of chromosome-wise distribution and frequency of these physically mapped microsatellite markers showed higher frequency of physically mapped markers on chromosome 9 (2719 markers, 17.5%) and minimum in chromosome 8 (1222, 7.8%) with average physical gap size of ~24 kb between corresponding mapped markers (Table 2). These observations suggested that the high-density microsatellite marker-based physical map constructed in this study for foxtail millet genome could be useful for rapid selection of genome-wide microsatellite markers well distributed over nine chromosomes for various large-scale genotyping applications, including mapping of genes and genomes and comparative genome mapping involving foxtail millet and other related crop plants. Summary of chromosomal distribution and average density of microsatellite markers mapped on the nine chromosomes of foxtail milletSummary of chromosomal distribution and average density of microsatellite markers mapped on the nine chromosomes of foxtail millet3.3. Amplification and polymorphic potential of microsatellite markersA selected set of 159 genomic microsatellite markers (148 from class I and 11 from class II), distributed over 9 chromosomes of foxtail millet, gave clear, successful and reproducible amplification with expected product size (bp) in S. italica cv. Prasad. It indicated about 100% amplification potential of designed genomic microsatellite markers, and, thus, the developed 15 573 microsatellite markers for foxtail millet genome are a useful resource for foxtail millet genomics and molecular breeding. One hundred fifty-two (95.6%) of the 159 microsatellite markers amplified unique single allele, whereas 7 markers amplified more than 1 allele/multiple alleles. Thus, a total of 167 alleles were amplified by 159 genomic microsatellite markers in S. italica cv. Prasad (Supplementary Table S3). Furthermore, 132 out of 159 microsatellite markers produced fragments of desired sizes, whereas the amplification products for 27 markers differed from the expected sizes. This inconsistency may be either due to the use of different accessions of foxtail millet in this study and sequenced genome or due to sequencing error.To evaluate polymorphism and molecular diversity potential of developed microsatellite markers, the validated and physically mapped 159 microsatellite markers were amplified in a set of 7 accessions of Setaria, including 4 cultivated and 3 wild species. One hundred seven (67.2%) of the 159 genomic microsatellite markers showed polymorphism in 8 cultivated and wild accessions of foxtail millet. A total of 342 alleles ranging from 1 to 6 alleles were amplified by 159 microsatellite markers in 8 foxtail accessions with an average 2.15 alleles per marker locus (Supplementary Table S3; Fig. 3). The polymorphic potentials of these 159 microsatellite markers were further evaluated in the genomic DNA of 2 parental foxtail millet accessions, Prasad and Lepakshi of an F2 mapping population (cv. Prasad x cv. Lepakshi). Thirty (~19%) of the 159 markers showed polymorphism between parental accessions of F2 mapping population. It includes 20 (21.5%), 8 (14.8%) and 2 (16.6%) DNR, TNR and TeNR motifs containing markers, respectively (Supplementary Table S3). Remarkably, all the 30 markers that showed parental polymorphism belonged to class I microsatellite types. This clearly suggests the added advantage of long hypervariable class I microsatellites over variable class II microsatellites for revealing higher degree of polymorphism in the foxtail millet accessions and, thus, could be utilized for large-scale genotyping applications. Such observations have also been reported in other genome-wide studies in plant species using a larger set of class I and class II microsatellite markers.13,15,28 The polymorphic potential (67.2%) of genomic microsatellite markers estimated among foxtail millet cultivated and wild accessions was higher than that reported using the microsatellite markers derived from foxtail millet genomic sequences.14,15 The higher polymorphic potential of genomic microsatellite markers is expected because of their derivation from non-coding sequence components of the foxtail genome.10,12,15 Besides, the validated physically mapped markers could enable to discriminate all the eight cultivated and wild foxtail millet accessions from each other with a level diversity from 32 to 59% (Supplementary Fig. S2). The distant clustering patterns of S. italica subsp. viridis and other related Setaria wild species such as Setaria sphacelata and Setaria verticillata from the cultivated Setaria species were expected. The clustering patterns derived among cultivated and wild Setaria species corresponded well with their phylogenetic relationships and taxonomic classifications. Moreover, this accords well with the earlier studies conducted using ISSR and transposon-based markers.29,30 The microsatellite markers, thus, showed differentiation between cultivated and wild Setaria species that could be useful for introgression breeding for transferring genes/alleles of agronomic importance like stress tolerance from the wild species to the cultivated genetic backgrounds of foxtail millet. Therefore, the genomic microsatellite markers with high amplification and polymorphic potential distributed over nine chromosomes of foxtail millet genome designed in the study could be useful for many large-scale genotyping applications in foxtail millet.

Cross-genera transferability of microsatellite markersOf the 159 genomic microsatellite markers validated, 58 markers were randomly selected to assess their utility for cross-genera transferability among millet and non-millet species. Of the 58 microsatellite markers assayed, 53 (91.3%) gave consistent amplification in Barnyard millet, 55 (94.8%) in finger millet, 51 (87.9%) in kodo millet, 55 (94.9%) in little millet, 54 (93.1%) in pearl millet, 51 (87.9%) in proso millet, 46 (79.3%) in switchgrass, 57 (98.2%) in guinea grass, 52 (89.6%) in sorghum, 42 (71.2%) in wheat, 51 (87.9%) in rice and 53 (91.4%) in maize with an average cross-genera transferability potential of ~89% (Fig. 3). All the 58 microsatellite markers have ability to distinguish the investigated 13 millet and non-millet species into 2 distinct groups (Fig. 4). The obtained high average cross-genera transferability potential (~89%) of genomic microsatellite markers is consistent with our previous study, where also a higher level of transferability (73%) of foxtail millet genomic microsatellite markers across various millet and non-millet species was observed.15 Apart from this, our results are in close agreement to several previous studies reporting high cross-species transferability of genomic microsatellite markers from Lolium to Festuca complex (~71%),31 rice to bamboo (~68.3%)32 and groundnut to other legumes (~71%).33 The high degree of cross-transferability of genomic microsatellite markers across related foxtail millet species could be due to more representation of microsatellite markers that were derived from the conserved expressed component of the foxtail millet genome sequences and, thus, resulting in higher transferability of microsatellite markers like genic microsatellite markers across closely related and even distantly related genera.10–12 The sequencing of PCR products of microsatellite markers amplifying multiple alleles in millet and non-millet species revealed the presence of expected microsatellite repeat motifs in foxtail millet as predicted in silico (Supplementary Fig. S3). The fragment length polymorphism among the accessions explained the variation in the length of the microsatellite repeats and the presence of point mutations, including insertion/deletions (Supplementary Fig. S3). Therefore, based on amplicon sequencing, the microsatellite markers showing cross-transferability across millet and non-millet species were valid and, thus, have utility in comparative genome mapping studies in both millets and non-millets. Besides, the markers showing high-cross transferability across millet and non-millet species can be utilized for genetic enhancement of orphan crops using the marker-related genetic information of foxtail millet genome. Genetic relationships among 9 millet and 4 non-millet grass species based on 58 foxtail millet microsatellite markers using neighbor-joining clustering. Nine millet species, including foxtail millet, were clearly differentiated from the four non-millet grass species, and expected genetic relationships among species under study were also evident.Genetic relationships among 9 millet and 4 non-millet grass species based on 58 foxtail millet microsatellite markers using neighbor-joining clustering. Nine millet species, including foxtail millet, were clearly differentiated from the four non-millet grass species, and expected genetic relationships among species under study were also evident.3.5. In silico comparative genome mapping between foxtail millet and other grass speciesFor comparative mapping, the physically mapped 15 573 microsatellite markers on the 9 chromosomes of foxtail millet were compared with their physical location on the chromosomes of other related grass genomes namely sorghum, maize and rice (Table 3; Fig. 5A–C; Supplementary Tables S4–S6). In silico comparative genome mapping revealed maximum proportion of sequence-based orthology and, thus, syntenic relationship of microsatellite markers distributed over 9 foxtail millet chromosomes with 10 chromosomes of sorghum (16.9%, 2631) and maize (14.5%, 2252) and 12 rice (6.4%, 1005) chromosomes. Many of the physically mapped microsatellite markers of foxtail millet also showed syntenic relationships with more than one chromosome of sorghum, maize and rice, reflecting the occurrence of segmental duplication events between the chromosomal stretches of respective genomes. This is expected considering the presence of higher number (10–12) of chromosomes in rice, maize and sorghum when compared with 9 chromosomes of foxtail millet. A number of foxtail millet microsatellite markers showed significant matches with different chromosomes of sorghum, maize and rice.

Syntenic relationship of foxtail millet genome with (A) sorghum, (B) maize and (C) rice chromosomes using 15 573 physically mapped foxtail millet microsatellite markers. Maximum syntenic relationships of foxtail millet chromosomes with sorghum chromosomes based on microsatellite markers were apparent.Foxtail millet–sorghum synteny: between foxtail millet and sorghum genomes, 2631 microsatellite marker loci distributed over 9 chromosomes of foxtail millet showed significant matches with 2635 genomic regions of 10 sorghum chromosomes (Table 3; Fig. 5A). All the nine foxtail millet chromosomes showed considerable and higher average frequency (16.9%) of microsatellite marker-based syntenic relationship with specific sorghum chromosomes. The physically mapped microsatellite markers on the foxtail millet chromosome 1 (309) showed maximum synteny (92.5%) with sorghum chromosome 4, followed between foxtail millet chromosome 5 and sorghum chromosome 3 (88.1%), between foxtail millet chromosome 2 and sorghum chromosome 2 (86.9%), between foxtail millet chromosome 9 and sorghum chromosome 1 (86.9%) and minimum between foxtail millet chromosome 8 and sorghum chromosome 5 (48.6%) (Supplementary Table S4).Foxtail millet–maize synteny: the comparative mapping between foxtail millet and maize genomes revealed syntenic relationship of 2252 microsatellite marker loci distributed over 9 chromosomes of foxtail millet with 2337 genomic regions on 10 chromosomes of maize (Table 3; Fig. 5B). On an average, 14.5% syntenic relationship of microsatellite marker loci between foxtail millet and maize chromosomes was observed. The syntenic relationships of microsatellite marker loci were maximum between foxtail millet chromosome 9 with maize chromosome 1 (64.2%), followed between foxtail millet chromosome 1 and maize chromosome 5 (62.5%), between foxtail millet chromosome 5 and maize chromosome 3 (60.2%) and minimum between foxtail millet chromosome 3 and maize chromosome 6 (33.1%) (Supplementary Table S5).Foxtail millet–rice synteny: the microsatellite markers physically mapped on the foxtail millet chromosomes showed least synteny with 12 rice chromosomes with average frequency of 6.4% that is much lower than that with the sorghum and maize chromosomes (Table 3; Fig. 5C). Only 1005 foxtail microsatellite marker loci showed significant matches with 1130 genomic regions spanning over 12 chromosomes of rice genome (Supplementary Table S6). Maximum synteny of microsatellite marker loci be-tween foxtail millet chromosome 5 and rice chromosome 1 (89.5%) and minimum between foxtail millet chromosome 2 and rice chromosome 9 (46.8%) was observed.Previous reports showed the mapping of similar microsatellite markers either genetically or physically on orthologous or syntenic chromosomes of different related plant genomes.1,6,34–36 Comparative microsatellite marker-based genome mapping revealed higher degree of synteny between foxtail and sorghum genome, followed by maize and rice that is expected due to their taxonomic relationship in which foxtail millet, sorghum and maize belong to the same subfamily Panicoideae, whereas rice belongs to Ehrhartoideae. This result also indicates declination of synteny with increasing phylogenetic distance among plant species. The syntenic relationships inferred among the chromosomes of foxtail millet and three cereal species (sorghum, maize and rice) in the present study agreed well with the earlier study of Devos.35 However, using the genome-wide microsatellite markers, the present study generated few previously unobserved interesting information like syntenic relationships between foxtail chromosome 9 and rice chromosome 3 (73.7%) and foxtail millet chromosome 8 with rice chromosome 1 (79.5%) that was not reported earlier.35Our results are in accordance with our earlier study, where we reported ~18% sequence homology of microsatellite markers in the foxtail millet with sorghum, ~16% with maize and ~5% with rice.15 In the synteny analysis, the observed high level of similarity provides an idea on genome conservation among grasses. Chromosomal rearrangements such as duplication, inversion and translocation were also evidenced as many of foxtail millet marker loci that were mapped to more than one chromosome of analysed species. Although our results do not provide a whole genome view due to the limitations of regions studied and biasness of markers used, our comparative studies have been insightful in understanding the evolutionary process among grasses involving the foxtail millet genome. Therefore, further investigation is required to evaluate the detailed level of collinearity between sorghum, maize and rice with foxtail millet genomes. The microsatellite marker-based comparative genome mapping between foxtail millet and other diploid grass species such as sorghum, maize and rice would be useful in map-based isolation of genes of agronomic importance from foxtail millet using the marker-based genotyping information of other related small and diploid grass members.4. ConclusionsIn the present study, we conducted a genome-wide analysis and identified 28 342 microsatellite motifs in the foxtail millet. A total of 21 294 primer pairs were designed, of which 15 573 microsatellites were physically mapped on 9 chromosomes of foxtail millet genome, and 159 markers were validated successfully in foxtail millet accessions. The microsatellite markers developed here showed their utility in high amplification and polymorphic potential, cross-genera transferability and in silico comparative physical mapping. These genomic microsatellite markers reported here would be of enormous and immense use for various large-scale genotyping applications, including germplasm characterization, cultivar identification, construction of high-density microsatellite marker-based physical linkage map for gene/QTL discovery and comparative genome mapping involving foxtail millet and other millets, cereals and bioenergy grass species. More importantly, the constructed high-density physical map in this study could act as reference for future studies of researchers for rapid selection of microsatellite markers either across genome-wide/chromosomal level or at targeted chromosomal location. Thus, it would expedite the construction of high-density genetic linkage map and fine mapping of genes/QTLs for important agronomic traits in foxtail millet.Conflict of Interest statementNone declared.Supplementary DataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was financially supported by the core grant of National Institute of Plant Genome Research (NIPGR), New Delhi, India.Grateful thanks are due to the Director, National Institute of Plant Genome Research (NIPGR), New Delhi, India for providing facilities.

This study elucidated the phylogeny of T. parva strains based on genome-wide SNPs analysis with prediction of possible past recombination events, providing insight into the migration, diversification, and evolution of this parasite species in the African continent.1. IntroductionTheileria parva is a tick-borne protozoan parasite belonging to the phylum Apicomplexa. Infection of T. parva in cattle causes a severe disease known as East Coast fever (ECF) or Corridor disease.1–3 The disease is endemic in East African countries, where it has caused a serious economical problem to the livestock industry. Although the mortality in cattle may reach 100%, especially in exotic breeds, the Cape buffalo (Syncerus caffer) shows no clinical signs and is considered to be the main natural host. Although clinical differences have been documented,4 ECF and Corridor disease have similar presentations. However, a major epidemiological difference is that, whereas ECF spreads from cattle to cattle, Corridor disease is believed to be transmitted solely from buffalo to cattle. The parasites causing ECF and Corridor disease were designated as T. p. parva and T. p. lawrencei, respectively.3Vaccination against ECF is based on an infection and treatment method that involves inoculation of live sporozoite-stage parasites and simultaneous treatment with long-acting tetracycline.5 The Muguga cocktail, consisting of the three strains of Muguga, Serengeti-transformed, and Kiambu 5, is the most widely used vaccine in East Africa. Importantly, there is an extensive debate concerning the risk of vaccination with live non-attenuated sporozoites such as the Muguga cocktail vaccine, as the vaccination may introduce parasites with an exotic genetic background into the local parasite population.6–9 This was proven to be a real risk when Oura et al.7 demonstrated the transmission of a strain of vaccine constituent to unvaccinated cattle under field conditions in Uganda. In addition, the presence of the vaccine component strain (Muguga or Serengeti-transformed) was confirmed in clinical cases of ECF in the Southern Province of Zambia,6 following deployment of the Muguga Cocktail over a 7-year period, ranging from 1986 to 1992. Therefore, two indigenous Zambian strains (Katete and Chitongo) have been used as a vaccine in the Eastern and Southern Provinces of Zambia,10 although the consequences of this vaccination have not been analysed.Given that Theileria parasites could recombine between divergent strains during the sexual stage in ticks, vaccine-derived ‘exotic’ and ‘local’ strains could exchange genetic information, resulting in parasites with genetic mosaics and diversity. In addition to the problems with the current vaccine, quality control of the cocktail vaccine in terms of the composition of each component is difficult. This may be related to recombination and selection during the maintenance and passage of the stabilates through ticks.11 Thus, precise and reliable methods for parasite genotyping or phenotyping during vaccine production and its field application are required.Genetic diversity between different T. parva strains has been assessed using various approaches, including polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of polymorphic antigen-encoding genes,6,12 or the indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) using monoclonal antibodies against the surface protein, the polymorphic immunodominant molecule (PIM).13 A panel of micro- and mini-satellite markers has also been developed14,15 that is widely used in the genetic analysis of field populations7,8 and has also been used to characterize vaccine stabilates11 and genetic recombination analysis.16–18 However, the resolution of genetic differentiation in these studies is limited because of the relatively low marker density.In this study, we carried out the whole-genome sequencing of nine T. parva strains, comprising seven cattle-derived and two buffalo-derived strains, using next-generation sequencing technology. Genome-wide comparison of strains revealed genetic polymorphisms on a fine scale and was used to infer phylogenetic relationships among the parasites. The analysis enabled us to determine potential immune selective pressures against parasite genes, which may prove useful in identifying potential antigens. Moreover, the allelic diversity pattern among strains gave us insight into the evolution, diversification, and migration of this parasite in the African continent.2. Materials and methods2.1. Parasite strainsIn total, nine strains of T. parva, mainly isolated in the 1980s, were used in this study. The place and the year isolated are shown in Table 1. These strains were originally isolated in ticks from infected cows and cultured as schizont-infected bovine lymphocyte cell lines. ChitongoZ2and KateteB2 have been used as sporozoite stabilate vaccines in the Eastern and Southern Provinces of Zambia.10 Kiambu 519 is one of the Muguga cocktail vaccine components, and KiambuZ464/C12 is a strain that has been cloned out from Kiambu 5 (Kenya, stabilate 68). Zambian strains KateteB2, ChitongoZ2, and MandaliZ22H10 were isolated before the introduction of the Muguga cocktail into Zambia, thus representing ECF epidemiology in Zambia, excluding human-induced genetic contamination. In addition, the analysis included two buffalo-derived isolates, LAWR and Z5E5. Z5E5 is a buffalo-type isolate obtained from a bovine, whereas LAWR is a buffalo-type isolate obtained from a buffalo. KiambuZ464/C12, MandaliZ22H10, and Z5E5 were cloned by limiting dilution. These Theileria-infected cell lines did not undergo extensive passages (<30 passage) and were stored in liquid nitrogen until use. Cultures were maintained in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) -1640 culture medium containing 10 or 20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 50 µM 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 mg/ml streptomycin. T. parva strains sequenced in this study with the summary of Solexa sequence resultsT. parva strains sequenced in this study with the summary of Solexa sequence results2.2. Parasite purification and genomic DNA preparationSchizont-enriched material was prepared from the infected lymphocytes by a density-gradient separation method as previously described,20–22 with some modifications. The cells were treated with 3 µM nocodazole for 18 h, and then harvested cells were lyzed for 30–60 min at room temperature with a Gram-negative bacterium, Aeromonas hydrophila (AH-1)-derived haemolysin, in a suspension of HEPES-CaCl2 (10 mM-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM KCl, and 1 mM CaCl2, pH 7.4) to obtain a cell concentration of 4 × 107 cells/ml (0.5–2 × 108 cells in total). Crude AH-1 haemolysin was prepared by bacterial culture supernatant according to a previously described method23 and was added to the cell suspension at a final concentration of 100 U/ml. Lysis of infected lymphocytes was observed under a microscope. If complete cell lysis was not observed after 15 min, then the incubation period was prolonged until almost 100% of cells were lyzed, whereas schizonts remained intact. Because the sensitivity of schizont-infected cells varied significantly between cell lines, the maximum incubation time was 120 min. After lysis, the suspension was washed with HEPES-CaCl2 and re-suspended in 3 ml of HEPES-ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) (10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM KCl, and 5 mM CaCl2, pH 7.4). Four layers of Percoll solution comprising 10, 10, 5, and 5 ml of 65, 40, 30, and 20% Percoll in HEPES-EDTA, respectively, were prepared in an ultracentrifuge tube. The cell lysate was overlaid on top of the Percoll solution and ultracentrifuged at 87 000 g for 30 min at 4°C, using a SW41 rotor (Beckman, USA). The schizont layer that formed at the interface between 40 and 65% Percoll solutions was carefully collected with a Pasteur pipette and then washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove the Percoll. A sample of each schizont preparation was stained with Giemsa, and preparations with negligible amounts of contamination with host-cell components were subjected to DNA isolation.2.3. DNA preparation, whole-genome amplification, and Illumina genome analyzer II (GAII) sequencingGenomic DNA was prepared from the purified schizonts using the NucleoSpin Tissue XS protocol (Machery-Nagel, Duren, Germany). Whole-genome amplification was performed on 10 ng of the total template DNA using an Illustra GenomiPhi V2 DNA Amplification Kit (GE Healthcare) following the manufacturer's instructions.24,25 The obtained DNA was purified by ethanol precipitation and subjected to sequence analysis. A 36 nucleotide, single-end sequence run was performed on the Illumina GAII Analyzer following the manufacturer's protocols (Illumina, San Diego, GA, USA).The obtained reads, as listed in Table 1, were mapped on the 8 235 476 bp sequence of the T. parva Muguga strain (AAGK01000001, AAGK01000002, AAGK01000005, AAGK01000006, and AAGK01000004) using the CLC Genomics Workbench (CLC bio, Aarhus, Denmark, Version 4.0.2). The ungapped alignment algorithm was used for all alignments, keeping the default parameters for mismatch and deletion costs (mismatch cost = 2, deletion cost = 1). Files containing these short sequence reads were submitted to the DDBJ Sequence Read Archive (accession number DRA000613).2.4. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) analysisThree sets of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were defined (Supplementary Fig. S1). SNPs were identified by comparing each re-sequenced genome with the reference Muguga strain.26 SNP detection was performed using the SNP detection tool in the CLC Genomic Workbench with the default parameters (window length = 11, maximum number of gaps and mismatch = 2, minimum average quality surrounding bases = 15, and minimum quality of central base = 20),27 except for the minimum coverage that was set at five reads, and the list was manually curated to include only SNPs, where all reads within a single sample agreed (SNP dataset I). The extracted SNPs data were exported and analysed by Microsoft Office Excel 2010. SNP dataset I was used for creating a SNPs density map and for dN/dS analysis. From SNP dataset I, SNPs identified among the eight bovine T. parva strains were extracted. To avoid calling block substitutions as SNPs, SNPs were only selected, if they did not exist within 100 bp of another SNP, and this provided SNP dataset II. Allelic data from each strain were extracted, and this information was used for the allelic combination and recombination analysis. SNP dataset III was created using the eight cattle-derived and two buffalo-derived strains, and again SNP positions were required to have at least 100 bp intervals. Thus, the high stringency dataset encompassing all 10 Theileria strains (including the reference strain), SNP dataset III, was used for phylogenetic analysis. Plots of the allele combination pattern for each chromosome were generated using freeware and open-source R software version 2.11.1 (R Development Core Team, 2010; http://www.R-project.org). Genes under selection pressure were estimated by calculating the dN/dS between strains with the SNP dataset I by the method of Yang et al.,28 implemented in the PAML package.29 Signal sequences for all the annotated genes of the Muguga strain were predicted using SignalP v4.0.302.5. Phylogenetic tree and recombination detectionTo identify the relationship between the sequences of the nine strains and the Muguga reference strain, an unrooted neighbour-net tree31 was constructed based on the concatenated SNP dataset III using Split tree version 4.11.3.32 The Recombination Detection Program version 3.44 (RDP3) was used to detect possible recombination regions.33 This software incorporates several recombination prediction methods. As the reliability of each method has not been fully evaluated, it is anticipated that some of the recombination events predicted may be artifactual. We manually curated the results choosing Geneconv34 and maximum Chi-square35 as the selection priority, as the accuracy of these tests is relatively well defined.36 Predicted recombination events were considered valid, if at least one additional program supported the findings, i.e. (P = 0.001) for that event from RDP,37 Boot scanning,38 3 Seq method,39 or the sister-scanning method.40 Predictions that did not meet these criteria were removed. For phylogenetic analysis of p150 and p104, we used mapping sequence information for each strain, and unmapped or unreliable regions were filled by manual Sanger sequencing. The sequences obtained in this study were submitted to GenBank under accession no. AB739676–AB739693.3. Results3.1. Genome sequencing of nine T. parva strains using Illumina technologySingle runs of Illumina produced over 10 million reads for each sample, and this provided coverage of 94.7–97.5% for genomes of individual strains against 8.3 M of the reference Muguga genome, with an average coverage between ×17 and ×49 (Table 1). Depending on the purity of the preparations, 11.6–77.9% of the total reads for any one strain were successfully mapped, whereas unmapped reads were considered to be derived from host genomic DNA. All four chromosomes of each stock were evenly covered in general, except for ChitongoZ2 (Fig. 1). As the concentration of extracted DNA from purified schizonts in ChitongoZ2 strain was lowest, we suspect that the whole-genome amplification procedure for this strain caused biased amplification, resulting in an uneven distribution of the coverage; however, this did not affect SNPs detection.

The entire datasets of 34 814–121 545 SNPs (SNP dataset I) were plotted as SNP densities (per 10 kb intervals) alongside chromosome 1–4. The x-axis shows the chromosomal position, and the left y-axis shows the number of SNPs (black bars) per 10 kb interval. Average short read coverage is also shown on the right y-axis (above line). Arrowheads indicate the possible location of the centromere.3.2. SNPs detectionStringent conditions for SNPs detection were used, i.e. more than five high-quality reads covering the SNPs and 100% concordance in position. If multiple allele variants calling was allowed, 5216 loci had complex SNPs in at least one strain (0.0633% of the reference Muguga genome). As the genome of Theileria at the schizont stage is haploid, only a single allele is expected at each locus, and complex SNPs are unexpected, if the sample contains a clonal population. The appearance of these multi-allelic SNPs could represent base-calling or mapping errors (due to repetitive sequence or paralogous genes). Because other possibilities that these SNPs were generated during in vitro passages after cloning by the limited dilution and that minor populations in the original materials obtained from host animals remained in the analysed samples cannot be excluded, such questionable SNPs were excluded in further analysis. Although it is likely that some genuine SNPs may be overlooked, a high stringency SNPs calling protocol was utilized to avoid false SNPs calls.The number of SNPs identified in bovine-derived strains when compared with the Muguga strain ranged from 34 814 in the Entebbe strain to 51 790 in the Nyakizu strain. Additionally, 121 545 and 103 880 SNPs were identified in buffalo-derived LAWR and Z5E5 strains, respectively (Table 1). The densities of the SNPs in each chromosome tended to be higher in chromosomes 1 and 3 than in chromosomes 2 and 4 in most of the strains (Fig. 2). Out of a total of 533 642 SNPs identified in 9 strains (Table 1), 364 719 were present in coding regions (cSNP) and 168 923 were present in non-coding regions (ncSNP), although the SNP density (calculated per 1 kp) of cSNPs and ncSNPs were similar (Table 1). The numbers of SNPs ranged from 34 814 (Entebbe) to 121 545 for the buffalo-derived LAWR strain, and more than 2-fold SNPs were identified in 2 of the buffalo-derived strains when compared with the cattle-derived strains (Table 1), suggesting a degree of genetic differentiation between these types of Theileria. As shown in Fig. 1, clustered distribution of SNPs was observed (black bars in each panel). The uneven distribution of SNPs was not found to correlate with the sequence coverage distribution (line); thus, the effect of low SNPs calling efficiency in particular regions can be excluded. In addition, lower SNPs densities were observed within defined regions on chromosomes 1, 3, and 4, which was most evident in buffalo-derived Theileria strains (Fig. 1, arrowhead). These regions correspond to the putative centromeres with an extremely AT-rich composition. SNP density in each chromosome (SNP dataset I). Average SNP densities per 1 kb interval were calculated for each chromosome in nine T. parva strains with reference to the Muguga genome strain. In the published full genome sequence of T. parva, there is a large gap in the assembly of chromosome 3, due to the repetitive Tpr locus. The large contig AAGK01000005 and smaller contig AAGK 01000006 are shown as Chr3_530 and Chr3_531, respectively.SNP density in each chromosome (SNP dataset I).

Estimation of dN/dS ratios can potentially identify genes encoding immunogenic proteins and, thus, putative vaccine candidates.42 Therefore, we calculated dN/dS ratios for individual genes using SNP dataset I for seven bovine Theileria strains with the yn00 program of the PAML package.29 Overall, the dN/dS ratios calculated between cattle T. parva strains were average values of 0.0894–0.0993 when pair-wise comparisons were performed against the Muguga strain, with similar values to those observed in the comparison between T. parva versus Theileria annulata (average dN/dS = 0.097).43 Among a total of 4011 genes annotated on the Muguga genome, 263 genes showed elevated levels of dN/dS values (average + 3SD) in at least 1 strain (Supplementary Table S1). We further narrowed the list down to 71 genes by selecting only those genes that have a signal sequence for targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum. Those selected genes may be potential targets of the host's immune system. The final list of these possible antigenic, and therefore vaccine target, genes is shown in Table 2, and the orthologous groups were also assigned according to our previous study.44 Most of the other genes listed here are currently annotated as hypothetical proteins without any predicted functional domain. However, some of them are known to be recognized by host humoral immunity. For example, p32 (TP01_1056)45 and 23 kDa piroplasm surface protein (TP02_0551)46 are erythrocytic piroplasm stage antigens, and strong antibody response in infected cattle has been reported. List of genes with high dN/dS ratios and a secretion signal peptide 71 genes were listed from 263 genes (higher dN/dS ratios), by selecting secretion signal peptide-predicted genesList of genes with high dN/dS ratios and a secretion signal peptide 71 genes were listed from 263 genes (higher dN/dS ratios), by selecting secretion signal peptide-predicted genes3.4. Phylogenetic relationship among 10 T. parva strains and evidence of recombinationThe allele frequency or combination of the bovine Theileria strain alleles collected in SNP dataset II was determined. By scoring biallelic positions only, 127 allelic combinations were identified among 8 bovine Theileria. Each of the 15 901 SNPs was assigned 1 of the 127 combinations. When the rank order of these combinations was calculated, the allele pattern unique to the Muguga strain came first, followed by Nyakizu-, KiambuZ464/C12-, and Katumba-unique allele combinations (Fig. 3). Because Muguga strains were used as the reference sequence, ranking ‘Muguga strain-unique allele pattern’ as the first event seems reasonable, as it incorporates a minor allele that is present in the Muguga strain. The distribution of frequencies among the 127 events was uneven because 54% of all SNPs were assigned to these top 10 allelic combinations. When the list was extended to cover the top 20 or 25 combinations, this ratio increased to 73 and 80%, respectively, indicating that most of the SNPs alleles were represented by a limited number of combinations. The distribution of these different SNPs patterns is represented on a schematic diagram of the chromosomes, and different combination events are colour coded (Fig. 3). As shown in Fig. 3, allelic combinations among the strains are distributed throughout every chromosome. A major observation was that SNPs with particular allelic combinations tend to cluster into defined loci, giving rise to a rough, large-scale mosaic pattern of allelic combinations. If the evolution of these strains had taken place completely independently, i.e. without interaction between strains, this clustering of allelic combinations would not be expected. Mosaic pattern of SNPs in T. parva strains. The frequency of each of the 127 possible allelic combinations for the 8 cattle-derived T. parva strains was calculated using the SNP dataset II. The 10 top-ranking combinations were plotted onto schematic chromosomes in the assigned colours. Each line within a chromosome represents a single SNP marker position.Mosaic pattern of SNPs in T. parva strains. The frequency of each of the 127 possible allelic combinations for the 8 cattle-derived T. parva strains was calculated using the SNP dataset II. The 10 top-ranking combinations were plotted onto schematic chromosomes in the assigned colours. Each line within a chromosome represents a single SNP marker position.The relationships among the 10 T. parva strains were analysed by creating a phylogenetic tree (Fig. 4). The allelic combinations are well correlated with the phylogenetic relationship among these strains, and the top 10 allelic combination events represented major nodes in the tree. Neighbour net is a phylogenetic network construction method that combines aspects of the neighbour joining and Split tree. In this neighbour-net analysis, the appearance of the reticulated branches indicates the recombination events. Considered together with the mosaic allelic combination patterns as described above (Fig. 3), we speculate that recombination events are responsible for the interrelationships between strains. To verify this hypothesis, we carried out further recombination event estimations with the RDP programs. The concatenated SNP dataset II was subjected to six recombination detection tests, namely Geneconv, maximum Chi-square, RDP, Boot scanning, 3 Seq., and sister-scanning methods. This resulted in a minimum of 133 recombination events being predicted as shown in Supplementary Fig. S2. A snapshot of the alignment of a concatenated version of the SNP dataset II is also shown in Supplementary Fig. S3. An RDP analysis was also carried out using the SNP dataset III, but no significant evidence for recombination was detected between cattle- and buffalo-derived strains (Z5E5 and LAWR, data not shown). Neighbour-net network analysis of 10 T. parva strains. Neighbour-net network analysis was performed with the concatenated SNP allele sequence data from SNP dataset III. Bootstrap values are based on 100 replicates and were near 100 at most of the nodes.Neighbour-net network analysis of 10 T. parva strains. Neighbour-net network analysis was performed with the concatenated SNP allele sequence data from SNP dataset III. Bootstrap values are based on 100 replicates and were near 100 at most of the nodes.As polymorphic antigens such as p104 or p150 have been used for the genotyping of T. parva,6 we compared results of genotyping based on p104 or p150 with those obtained by SNPs analysis. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S4, there was no congruency in tree shapes. The most likely explanation for this inconsistency is that the recombination event between the ancestral strains involved these loci, as is evident in Supplementary Fig. S2. RDP3 program predicts recombination events within those two loci. In p104 loci, KateteB2 and Katumba are predicted to be recombinant from unknown parent or Entebbe strains. And this is true for Muguga, KiambuZ464/C12, and the possible donor, Nyakizu, at the p150 locus as marked in Supplementary Fig. S2.4. DiscussionComparison of whole-genome sequencing data of several Theileria strains, using short reads sequencing and mapping on the reference genome sequence, revealed genome-wide nucleotide-based polymorphisms in this species. SNPs density plots evaluate clustered SNPs distribution across the genome and identify SNP-poor and SNP-rich regions. Such a clustering of SNPs has been also reported in mammalian genome, although the forces responsible (e.g. mutation hot spot, recombination, or balancing selection) remain poorly understood.47,48 For apicomplexan parasite, reports for the genome-wide SNPs analysis are limited, but similar SNPs distribution pattern was observed in Plasmodium49 suggesting existence of the same underlying mechanisms between parasite and mammalian genomes for these SNPs clustering.Our SNPs analysis clarified the phylogenetic relationships among 10 Theileria strains on a genome-wide scale. When these Theileria strains were further analysed using neighbour-net analysis, clusters were formed in accordance with both host species and geographical origin. For example, three Zambian strains (ChitongoZ2, MandaliZ22H10, and KateteB2) were clustered together in the same node, inferring that they are closely related genotypes, but distant from strains isolated in Eastern Africa. In addition, there is a clear demarcation between the bovine- and buffalo-derived strains (Z5E5 and LAWR). Genetic difference between Z5E5 and LAWR was also confirmed as high numbers of SNPs were not shared between Z5E5 and LAWR, as is shown in Supplementary Fig. S5. However, reticulated patterns between strains belonging to different clusters are evident, as shown in Fig. 4, which suggests genetic recombination between ancestors of the strains that are currently geographically separated. The evidence for recombination among the analysed strains was further supported by the presence of a mosaic pattern of allelic combinations, together with the statistical analysis of recombination. This result is intuitive when one considers the fact that the parasite has an obligate sexual cycle and that analysis of field populations suggests that recombination in the tick vector is commonplace.14 There are two possibilities of ticks being infected with parasites with different genotypes: infestation on a single bovine host infected with genotypically mixed parasite populations or multiple infestations on different animals infected with different parasite genotypes that are possible for two or three host tick species. However, the latter is less likely, as synchronization of the sexual stages (micro- and macro gamete) between two parasites is difficult, if they are picked up by ticks at different feeding times.We hypothesize that genetic recombination occurred in the ancestral bovine Theileria populations in the distant past, and parasites had evolved independently after geographical isolation. The origin of T. p. parva in cattle is unknown, but it is considered likely to have originated in the African buffalo.50 Evidently, T. parva populations in buffalo are considered to be more diverse than in cattle6,13,51 and cause severe disease in cattle. Historically, domestic cattle were believed to have been introduced to the African continent thousands of years ago, possibly into Sub-Saharan Africa from the Mideast.52–54 After the introduction of cattle, a subset of the buffalo Theileria population may have been transmitted (at that stage, it would be called T. p. lawrencei, as it could not infect other cattle), adapted, and co-evolved within cattle, resulting in the emergence of T. p. parva that can spread within cattle.It should be emphasized that the phylogenetic tree obtained from two polymorphic antigens (p104 and p150) showed a different topology from that based on genome-wide SNPs. Thus, the interpretation of the phylogenetic relationship, analysed by a limited number of loci, must be made carefully in the case of pathogens that acquire genetic diversity by recombination, rather than by accumulation of mutations. This is due to the fact that each locus can become chimaeric by crossing over between genotypes that have different evolutional histories. Therefore, a number of independent loci should be included to estimate the real relationship between isolates such as multi-locus sequencing typing, but genome-wide SNPs analysis is the ultimate solution in this context.Two buffalo-derived strains (Z5E5 and LAWR) were genetically distant from cattle-derived Theileria strains and between the two strains, as expected from earlier studies.6,13,51 It has been proposed that genetic exchange between buffalo-derived Theileria and cattle-derived Theileria still occurs through sexual recombination, based on evidence that T. p. lawrencei and T. p. parva showed a mosaic sequence pattern in the ITS region.55 However, in our recombination analysis using the RDP program, no recombination events were detected between bovine and buffalo Theileria strains. It might be hypothesized that cattle-infecting strains were originated from a subset of buffalo-infecting T. parva population that has been circulating in Africa for a long time and now have evolved a genetic barrier to recombination. Further analysis with a greater number of buffalo-derived samples and denser SNPs coverage would be needed to clarify the genetic relationship between buffalo and cattle Theileria more precisely.Estimation of dN/dS values can potentially identify immunogenic genes under possible selective pressure and, thus, possible vaccine candidate molecules. The selected candidate 71 antigen list (Table 2) covers most of the known genes for antigenic or host-interacting proteins, which confirms the effectiveness of this genome-wide approach. p2346 and p3245 are surface or secreted antigens recognized by humoral immunity in infected animals. The diversification of these genes may be related to immune evasion of the Theileria parasite.On the other hand, although several genes with CTL targets have been identified as being under possible immune pressure,56 only Tp1 (TP03_0849) showed a higher dN/dS value in this study, whereas other genes for CTL targets (Tp2-9) showed relatively low dN/dS values (Supplementary Table S2). Relative conservation of the sequences of these CTL antigen genes among the different parasite strains has already been reported.56,57 Considering that the CTL response is a function of the host MHC type/TCR repertoire and antigenic types of parasites, the positive selective pressure acting on a particular gene may be too weak to be detected. In addition, CTL recognizes short peptides presented by MHC class I molecules, and, therefore, immune-based selective pressure is likely to be focused on a limited region of the targeted genes that dN/dS analysis is not sensitive enough to detect.The selected 71 antigen list also contained several genes from 3 large gene families, namely the Tash gene family (Ortholog group number: PiroF0100038), the SVSP gene family (PiroF0100037), and FAINT super family (PiroF0100056, also called as SfiI-subtelomeric fragment related protein family member). The Tash gene family has been characterized extensively in T. annulata.58 Some of the Tash and SVSP gene products have been predicted or demonstrated to be translocated in the host nucleus, and most of the Tash and SVSP genes are expressed predominantly in the schizont stage.58,59 This entails that the potential selective pressure will not be humoral, although the possibility that these proteins are exposed to the humoral immune response when infected cells are lysed cannot be excluded. A previous comparison between T. annulata and T. parva genomes also revealed high inter-species dN/dS ratios for the Tash and the SVSP family,60 consistent with our analysis. It was argued that gene expansion and divergence of Tash and SVSP family genes were associated with different functionality in each species.In conclusion, this study highlighted the phylogenetic relationship of 10 T. parva strains based on full genome sequences with prediction of possible past recombination events. The high-density SNPs map developed in this study is now applicable for genotyping or linkage analysis of the parasite. Practically, SNPs-based genotyping can discriminate vaccine and field strains of T. parva. Recent methodological advances in high-throughput technologies such as Taq man-real-time PCR and Golden gate technologies61 for SNPs genotyping will likely facilitate future genotyping studies. Further phylogenetic analysis in combination with phenotypic data will assist in the investigation of the virulence and evolution of bovine theilerias after their diversification from buffalo. Importantly, the putative antigen-encoding genes listed in this study should be further investigated to assess their candidacy as Theileria subunit vaccine components.Supplementary dataSupplementary Data are available atwww.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported in part by the Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research and Asia-Africa S & T Strategic Cooperation Promotion Program by the Special Coordination Funds for Promoting Science & Technology, from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan (MEXT) to C.S.

IntroductionThe emergence of massive parallel sequencers known as next generation sequencers (NGSs) has drastically changed DNA sequencing strategy and has accelerated the collection of genome sequences not only of unicellular and model plants, but also of plants that have large and complicated genomes. Moreover, NGSs can be used to detect huge numbers of sequence variations or polymorphisms, e.g. single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions and deletions (indels), and copy-number variations (CNV), among different species, germplasms and varieties.1 The usual strategy for detecting such variations using NGSs is to re-sequence portions of the genome by mapping the sequence reads from the NGSs onto the accurate reference genome sequences.2 Along with the advances associated with NGSs, high-throughput SNP genotyping methods based on microbeads or microarrays have also been developed, e.g. GoldenGate and Infinium assays (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) and GeneChip Mapping/SNP arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Using various combinations of these technologies for large-scale DNA sequencing and genotyping, genome-wide genetic studies have been extended from models to various plant species.3SNPs are the most abundant DNA polymorphisms in genome sequences and are thought to play major roles in the induction of phenotypic variations. In addition, the positions of SNPs on genome sequences affect gene expression and functions. In particular, nonsense mutations in exon regions are considered to be the most critical to phenotypic variations, and missense mutations accompanied by non-synonymous amino acid substitutions might influence protein functions. Moreover, the substitutions at splice junction sites produce truncated proteins. SNPs in upstream and downstream regions might cause phenotypic variations because they often activate or suppress gene expression by causing substitutions in regulatory sequences, e.g. promoters and terminators. Therefore, investigations of the SNPs related to functional changes of genes are considered essential for clarifying the functional genomics of organisms, including plants. In human genetics, the categorized SNPs associated with human diseases have been released from the F-SNP database (http://compbio.cs.queensu.ca/F-SNP/).4 Based on the support vector machine models, the sequence profiles and the structural stability of proteins whose functions are changed by non-synonymous substitutions have also been determined and are reported on the SNP3D website (http://www.snps3d.org).5 In plants, the functional SNPs on ‘granule bound starch synthase I’ (GBSSI) have been screened by computational analyses including sequence alignments and the modelling of three-dimensional structures.6Cultivated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) is one of the world's most important vegetable crops. It is characterized by a self-crossing reproduction system and a diploid genome (2n = 2X = 24) consisting of approximately 950 Mb. The whole-genome sequence of tomato was published recently by the International Tomato Genome Consortium,7 and a total of 34 727 protein-coding genes were predicted by the International Tomato Annotation Group (ITAG) (http://www.uk-sol.org). Using the whole-genome sequence as a reference, a large number of SNPs in tomato have been identified by the re-sequencing strategy.8 In a subsequent study, 7720 genome-wide SNPs were genotyped for 426 tomato lines, consisting of 410 inbred and 16 hybrid lines, using a high-throughput genotyping system, Illumina's Infinium assay. The SNPs on the assay were called ‘scorable SNPs’ because they could be used to score the tomato germplasm in genotyping.9 In our previous study, we discovered 1337 SNPs by a comparative analysis of transcriptome sequences derived from Micro-Tom and 19 tomato lines [SOL Genomics Network (SGN),10http://solgenomics.net; MiBASE,11http://www.pgb.kazusa.or.jp/mibase/] and used them for polymorphism analysis of 27 tomato lines by the GoldenGate assay.12 Although a large number of SNPs in tomato have been discovered in previous studies, their functions have not been surveyed.In this study, we used the Infinium assay developed by Sim et al.9 to perform SNP genotyping for 40 tomato lines, including the 27 lines used in our previous study.12 The SNP genotype data obtained in the present and previous studies12 were merged. To infer their effects on gene functions, SNPs can be classified into six categories: cSNPs (SNPs in a coding region that cause amino acid substitution), sSNPs (SNPs in a coding region that do not cause amino acid substitution), iSNPs (SNPs in an intron region), uSNPs (SNPs within the 1 Kb region upstream from the start codon), dSNPs (SNPs within the 1 Kb region downstream from the stop codon), and gSNPs (SNPs in intergenic regions). Furthermore, the three-dimensional structures of proteins encoded by genes having cSNPs were constructed by homology modelling. Based on the constructed protein structures, candidates for the functional sites were predicted to identify the SNPs that directly affect protein functions. We expected that the SNPs located on the candidate functional sites of proteins would be applicable to gene functional analysis and molecular marker-assisted selection as functional markers.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materialsForty tomato lines, consisting of 30 lines of cultivated tomato (S. lycopersicum), 2 lines of S. lycopersicum var. cerasiforme, and 8 lines of wild relatives (2 each of Solanum pimpinellifolium, Solanum pennellii, Solanum peruvianum, and Solanum chilense), were used for the genotyping assays. The 30 S. lycopersicum lines included 5 ‘Micro-Tom’ lines that were obtained from different resource centres. Micro-Tom is the experimental line most frequently used in the study of cultivated tomato. Natural variations were found in our previous study within two lines, one derived from NIVTS, Japan and the other from INRA, France.12 Two lines of ‘M82’ derived from different sources (NIVTS and INRA) were also included in the 30 S. lycopersicum lines to investigate the existence of SNPs within M82 because M82 has been widely used in tomato genetics. The names of the lines, accession numbers, sources, and breeding types are listed in Table 1. All lines were grown in a greenhouse, and the DNA of each line was isolated from leaves using a DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).

SNP genotypingGenome-wide SNP genotyping was performed using the Infinium assay (Illumina Inc.) that was developed by the Solanaceae Coordinated Agricultural Project (SolCAP),8 according to the manufacturer's standard protocol. The probe sequences and SNP information are available from SolCAP (http://solcap.msu.edu) and in Supplementary Table S1. The data obtained from the assays were analysed using the Genotyping Module of the GenomeStudio software (Illumina Inc.).2.3. Genetic diversity analysis and detection of linkage disequilibrium (LD)Linkage disequilibrium (LD) in the tomato lines was detected by the r2 and D' values calculated using the Tassel program.152.4. Classification of SNPs according to their locations on the genome sequenceThe locations of SNPs on the tomato genome genotyped using the two assay platforms, Infinium and GoldenGate, were identified by the following method. The probe sequences in both assays were searched against the tomato genome sequence SL2.40 using Blastn16 with an E-value cutoff of 1E-20. According to the relative positions between the SNPs and the genes predicted on the tomato genome sequence, the SNPs were classified into six groups, as described above: cSNPs, sSNPs, iSNPs, uSNPs, dSNPs, and gSNPs.2.5. Inference of SNP effects on protein and gene functionsThe amino acid sequences of the genes were searched against the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do) by Blastp16 with an E-value cutoff of 1E-10. The amino acid sequences were further aligned on those of the homologous proteins by Fasta36 program,17 and homology modelling was performed by Modeller 9.10 software18 based on the alignment with default parameters. The functional sites on the constructed protein structures were predicted using FPocket software19 with default parameters. The functions of proteins were predicted by combining the results obtained by the Blastp searches with an E-value cutoff of 1E-10 against the databases NR (non-redundant amino acid sequence database released by NCBI) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), TAIR10,20 KOG,21 and KEGG.22 The functional domains of proteins were searched against Pfam database release 26.023 using HMMscan program.243. Results and discussion3.1. SNP genotyping by high-throughput assay technologiesOf the 7720 scorable SNPs defined by the Infinium assay, 7617 (98.7%) were successfully genotyped, and 6374 (82.6%) showed polymorphism among the 40 tested lines. In our previous study using the GoldenGate assay, 916 of 1338 SNP loci (68.5%) showed polymorphism among the 27 tomato lines.12 Among the 916 SNP loci on the GoldenGate assay, 236 were duplicated on the Infinium assay; therefore, the genotype data of the specific 680 SNP loci on the GoldenGate assay were analysed with the 6374 SNPs of the Infinium assay. In total, polymorphic data were successfully obtained at 7054 SNP loci. The numbers of SNPs identified between each pair of the 40 lines are shown in Supplementary Table S2. The average number of polymorphic loci between each pair of the 40 lines was 4270, whereas that between each pair of the 30 cultivated tomatoes, the 2 lines of S. lycopersicum var. cerasiforme, and the 5 lines of Micro-Tom, was 930.The heterozygous alleles were found at 2292, 967, 921, 901, 772, and 1200 SNP loci within the F1 hybrid varieties of ‘Sweet 100’, ‘Geronimo’, ‘Matrix’, ‘Labell’, ‘Momotaro 8’, and ‘Reika’, respectively. In two of the five lines of Micro-Tom, i.e. ‘Micro-Tom NBRP’ and ‘Micro-Tom KDRI,’ all genotypes were completely identical. In the other pairs of Micro-Tom, the numbers of identified SNPs ranged from 275 (between ‘Micro-Tom TGRC’ and Micro-Tom KDRI/Micro-Tom NBRP) to 1008 (between ‘Micro-Tom MM’ and Micro-Tom KDRI/Micro-Tom NBRP).3.2. Classification of tomato lines based on genotyping dataThe genetic distances between all the combinations of any two lines were calculated based on the genotyping data of the 7054 SNP loci, and a dendrogram was then constructed (Fig. 1). Of the 40 lines examined, 36 were classified into 4 large clusters, which consisted of 8 wild relatives (Cluster 1), 5 lines of Micro-Tom (Cluster 2), 5 F1 hybrid cultivars, and an inbred line, ‘Tomato Chuukanbohon Nou 11' (Cluster 3), and the 15 inbred lines and 2 lines of S. lycopersicum var. cerasiforme (Cluster 4). Because Momotaro 8 was used as a backcross parent in the breeding program of Tomato Chuukannbohon Nou 11,25 75% of the genome of the Tomato Chuukanbohon Nou 11 might be identical to that of Momotaro 8, one of the tested F1 cultivars. Two cherry types, ‘Sweet 100’ and ‘Regina,’ and the two lines of M82 were separated from the four clusters. Sweet 100 showed the largest genetic distances in comparison with the other cultivated tomato lines. The graphical genotypes of the 40 tomato lines with the 7054 SNPs are shown in Supplementary Fig. S1. Most of the SNP loci were located on the ends of chromosomes corresponding to the euchromatic regions, where the gene density is higher than that on the heterochromatic regions, except for the three regions of the heterochromatins of chromosomes 3, 11, and 12. The biased locations of the SNPs on the genome have been found. These results are valid because most of the SNPs on the Infinium and GoldenGate assays were selected from the transcriptome sequences.9,12A dendrogram for the 40 lines of tomatoes based on the 7054 SNP genotypes.A dendrogram for the 40 lines of tomatoes based on the 7054 SNP genotypes.The HZ value of the 7054 SNP loci was 0.30 on average, ranging from 0.25 for chromosome 10 to 0.37 for chromosome 11 (Table 2). The average HZ value of Cluster 1, which consisted of the eight wild species, was the highest among the four clusters. In Cluster 2, which included the five lines of Micro-Tom, the HZ values were greater than zero, except for chromosome 11. In other words, SNPs were observed on 11 of 12 chromosomes within the Micro-Tom lines. Micro-Tom was developed by Scott and Harbaugh in 198926 and has been used as a model line in tomato genetics since 1997.27 The heterozygous regions in the five Micro-Tom lines might be caused by the existence of heterozygous regions in the first generation of Micro-Tom or mutations that arose during generation changes. In Cluster 3, which included the F1 hybrid cultivars, high HZ values were found in the large regions of chromosomes 6 (8.7–30.0 Mb), 9 (4.8–58.9 Mb), and 11 (7.7–49.3 Mb) and in small segmental regions on all chromosomes. On the other hand, in Cluster 4, which included the 16 inbred lines, high HZ values were found in chromosomes 3 (60.8–61.3 Mb), 7 (60.6–61.0 Mb), and 11 (3.5–4.6 Mb). The high HZ regions in chromosomes 3 (60.8–61.3 Mb) and 7 (60.6–61.0 Mb) overlapped between Clusters 3 and 4, whereas those in chromosome 11 were specific to Cluster 4. The tested F1 hybrids might be an introgressed disease-resistance gene, I-2,28 from wild relatives in the process of breeding. The gene is located on the specific high-HZ regions of Cluster 3 on chromosome 11. Therefore, we inferred that the genomic regions derived from wild relatives remained in the genomes of F1 hybrids and caused high heterozygosity in the regions (Supplementary Fig. S1). Average HZ values in each chromosome investigated on the 40 tomato lines and the 4 clustersAverage HZ values in each chromosome investigated on the 40 tomato lines and the 4 clustersThe LD on the 40 lines and on each cluster across the chromosomes is shown in Supplementary Fig. S2. Although significant LD was not clearly observed along with the diagonal lines on any of the LD maps of the 40 tomato lines, high LD values between adjacent SNPs were segmentally observed across the genomes. In Cluster 1, high LD values were observed on all of the chromosomes, suggesting that the wild relatives were independently evolved with few inter-crossings. In Cluster 2, small LD blocks were found on chromosomes 3, 4, 6, 7, and 12 that were caused by heterozygous regions within the five Micro-Tom lines. In Clusters 3 and 4, no significant LD was observed between adjacent SNPs in most of the genomic regions. This suggested that the genomes of cultivated tomato have been well admixed in germplasm collections. Large LD blocks were found on chromosomes 4, 6, 9, and 11 of Cluster 3, whereas a clear large LD block was observed on chromosome 11 in Cluster 4. Within each block, higher LD values were observed along with the oblong bars, and not diagonally. This implied that selection biases had occurred in partial regions of the genomes during the breeding processes. For example, the genes controlling disease resistance are located on chromosomes 6 (Cf-2 and Mi), 9 (Tm22), and 11 (I-2), where LD blocks were observed (Supplementary Fig. S2). The selection of specific alleles of these genes might induce the LD blocks.3.3. Classification of SNPs based on the positions on the tomato genomeThe SNPs were classified into six categories according to their positions on the tomato genome sequence (Fig. 2). The numbers of cSNPs and sSNPs located within the coding regions were 2212 (31.4%) and 2296 (32.5%), respectively. The numbers of uSNPs and dSNPs were 516 (7.3%) and 1311 (18.6%), respectively. There were fewer iSNPs and gSNPs than the other types of SNPs, i.e. 485 (6.9%) and 234 (3.3%), respectively, because the SNPs on the probes of the assays were selected from the transcriptome sequences.9,12 The total percentage of cSNPs, uSNPs, and dSNPs having the capacity to alter gene functions was 57.3%. Most of these SNPs were located on the gene-rich euchromatic regions in each chromosome (Fig. 3). There were no significant differences in the distribution on the genome among the six SNP categories. Numbers and percentages of the SNPs classified into six categories.Numbers and percentages of the SNPs classified into six categories.Locations of the 7054 SNPs on the tomato genome sequence (SL2.40).

The bars below the boxes indicate the regions of the euchromatins (magenta) and heterochromatins (grey).Among the 2212 cSNP loci, nonsense mutations were found in 15 genes (Table 3 and Supplementary Table S1). Of the 15 nonsense mutations, 3 were found in the alleles of the wild relatives, i.e. Solyc01g106570.2.1 [cystathionine beta-synthase (IPR000644)], Solyc03g083470.2.1 [protein kinase core (IPR000719)], and Solyc01g080340.2.1 [BSD (IPR005607)], and 2 mutations were found on the alleles of the Micro-Tom lines, i.e. Solyc05g025810.2.1 [six-bladed beta-propeller TolB-like (IPR011042)] and Solyc08g076000.2.1 [epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like region conserved site (IPR013032)]. Three mutations on the alleles of Solyc04g014400.2.1 [leucine-rich repeat (IPR001611)], Solyc04g064900.1.1 [glycoside hydrolase family 9 (IPR001701)], and Solyc09g090350.2.1 [long-chain fatty alcohol dehydrogenase (IPR012400)] were distributed in the inbred lines. The other 7 mutations were found across the 40 tomato lines. In ‘Heinz 1706-BG,’ whose genomic sequence has been determined,7 the five nonsense mutations were found on Solyc01g080340.2.1 [BSD (IPR005607)], Solyc01g091770.2.1 [zinc finger RING/FYVE/PHD-type (IPR013083)], Solyc02g050330.1.1 (hypothetical protein), Solyc04g056630.2.1 [cystathionine beta-synthase core (IPR000644)], and Solyc11g071510.1.1 (unnamed protein product). The 15 genes that contained cSNP-caused nonsense mutations are expected to help reveal the divergence and evolution between wild and cultivated tomato lines as well as within cultivated tomato lines. Annotations of the genes in which nonsense mutations caused by cSNPs were identifiedThe ‘Annotation (KDRI)’ indicates the deduced product name based on homology searches against the following databases: NCBI's NR, TAIR10, KOG, and KEGG.Annotations of the genes in which nonsense mutations caused by cSNPs were identifiedThe ‘Annotation (KDRI)’ indicates the deduced product name based on homology searches against the following databases: NCBI's NR, TAIR10, KOG, and KEGG.3.4. Substitution effects on the genes induced by cSNP, uSNP, and dSNPTo estimate the substitution effects on protein and gene functions, the KOG functional categories21 were assigned to the corresponding genes classified into the categories cSNP, sSNP, iSNP, uSNP, and dSNP. Fig. 4 shows the percentage of each of these types of SNPs on the 25 KOG categories. In addition, the standard deviations (s) of the percentages of the 25 KOG categories were calculated in each SNP type (data not shown). Hereafter, KOG categories that showed more or <1.5 s (s: sigma distribution) in the percentages were considered as significantly different KOGs in the distribution of each type of SNP. In the case of cSNPs, large ratios were observed for KOG L (replication, recombination, and repair, 41.0%) and KOG Q (secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport, and catabolism, 40.7%), whereas a smaller ratio was identified for KOG F (nucleotide transport and metabolism, 18.8%). In the case of uSNP, significantly higher distributions were observed for KOG W (extracellular structures, 12.0%) and KOG H (coenzyme transport and metabolism, 12.5%), whereas lower distributions were identified for KOG J (translation, ribosomal structure, and biogenesis, 3.4%), KOG L (replication, recombination, and repair, 3.6%) and KOG Q (secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport, and catabolism, 2.5%). In the case of dSNP, high and low ratios were observed for KOG Z (cytoskeleton, 35.7%), and KOG Y (nuclear structure, 11.1%), respectively. If promoters or terminators were located in the 1 Kb regions upstream or downstream from the start or stop codons of the genes, uSNP and dSNP might affect their gene expressions. For a more substantial estimation of the substitution effects on uSNP and dSNP, it is necessary to detect the promoter and terminator regions on each corresponding gene. Percentages of the 5 types of SNPs on each of the 25 KOG categories. The percentages of the observed cSNPs, sSNPs, uSNPs, dSNPs, and iSNPs are indicated by white, grey, dots, thick dots, and slated bars, respectively.Percentages of the 5 types of SNPs on each of the 25 KOG categories. The percentages of the observed cSNPs, sSNPs, uSNPs, dSNPs, and iSNPs are indicated by white, grey, dots, thick dots, and slated bars, respectively.Most of the substitutions involving changes in the charges or polarity of the amino acid residues were related to alterations in the physicochemical properties of proteins. Therefore, these alterations in the physicochemical properties of the amino acid residues by substitutions were investigated for 2212 cSNP loci. The amino acid properties were not altered by the substitutions at 926 (41.9%) of the 2212 cSNP loci (grey bars in Fig. 5), whereas they were altered to non-polar (slanted bars) or polar (dotted bars) in 861 (38.9%) and 346 (15.6%) of the 2212 SNP loci, respectively. Amino acid residues whose properties were altered on a change in polarity were found in 64 (2.9%) SNP loci (white bars).

Inference of direct substitution effects on protein functionsThe amino acid residues directly altering protein functions were inferred according to the locations of substitutions on the functional sites of protein structures. A total of 1271 cSNP loci that altered the charges or polarities on amino acid residues were identified in 1108 genes. Of these 1108 genes, the three-dimensional structures of 843 corresponding proteins were constructed by homology modelling using Modeller v9.10 software.18 Furthermore, the candidate functional sites were predicted by FPocket software.19These analyses together revealed 215 cSNP loci that were candidate functional sites on 200 proteins (Supplementary Table S1). The genes whose cSNPs were located on candidate functional sites have the potential to be applied as functional markers because they could directly affect the protein functions. Therefore, differences in the cSNP distribution on the 25 KOG categories were investigated according to the cSNP positions on functional or other sites (Fig. 6). Significantly different distributions were observed on KOG O (posttranslational modification, protein turnover, and chaperones), KOG C (energy production and conversion), KOG G (carbohydrate transport and metabolism), KOG E (amino acid transport and metabolism), and KOG Q (secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport, and catabolism).

The numbers of annotated genes with cSNP located inside or outside of the functional sites are shown by white and grey bars, respectively.Distribution of the annotated KOGs in the genes with identified cSNPs inside or outside of functional sites. The numbers of annotated genes with cSNP located inside or outside of the functional sites are shown by white and grey bars, respectively.Solyc09g010080.2.1, also known as brix9-2-5,29,30 controls fruit sugar content and is involved in KOG G (carbohydrate transport and metabolism). It is also annotated as beta-fructofuranosidase. The three-dimensional structure of Solyc09g010080 was built by homology modelling based on the crystal structure of a cell-wall invertase from Arabidopsis thaliana (PDB id: 2ac1) (Fig. 7). The identity of the amino acid sequences between Solyc09g010080 and 2ac1 was 51.0% in 92.6% length coverage. In the constructed structure, 28 pockets were found as candidate functional sites by the FPocket program.19 This program usually detects several candidates for functional sites, which are called pockets, in a protein structure because there are many small or large clefts on the surface of proteins. In a previous study,29,30 three amino acid substitutions (Gln297, Asn315, and Leu322) caused by cSNPs were found in brix9-2-5 between S. lycopersicum and S. pennellii. Asn315, which is one of the three amino acid residues, was identified on pocket 8 that was a relatively larger pocket that included 15 amino acid residues (Asn315, Leu316, Ser317, Lys319, Ser430, Tyr431, Lys432, Ile433, Val459, Asp460, Val461, Asp462, Leu463, Asp465, and Lys488). The amino acid residue at the 315th position was altered from Asn to Asp, and the amino acid property was changed from ‘polar’ to ‘negatively charged (acidic).’ The amino acid residue at the 315th position was Asp in the wild tomatoes and S. lycopersicum var cerasiforme (WIR25/30 and TOMJPF00009), whereas it was Asn in the other tomatoes. Aspartic acid residues play important roles in the catalytic sites of proteins, and, therefore, the activities of Solyc09g010080 might differ between the wild and cultivated tomatoes. Locations of the amino acid residues substituted by a cSNP on Solyc09g010080. The amino acid residue (number 315) substituted by a cSNP was located on pocket 8. The a-helices, ß-sheets, and turns are shown in orange, blue, and yellow, respectively. Pocket 8 is displayed with a mesh model. In the mesh model, the carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen atoms are coloured grey, red, and blue, respectively.Locations of the amino acid residues substituted by a cSNP on Solyc09g010080.

Although this was the total number of SNPs we investigated, we expect that greater numbers of SNPs exist on the tomato genome. The advance of NGS technologies has enabled the discovery of genome-wide SNPs by the re-sequencing of multiple tomato lines. The approach demonstrated in this study is expected to be applied to larger-scale functional analysis of SNPs identified by re-sequencing.4. ConclusionA total of 7054 SNP loci were genotyped in 40 tomato lines, including S. lycopersicum, S. lycopersicum var. cerasiforme, S. pimpinellifolium, S. pennellii, S. peruvianum, and S. chilense. Based on the SNP genotypes, these 40 lines were classified into 4 clusters, and the LDs were detected on the 40 lines and each cluster. The SNP effects on gene expression were inferred by the sequences within 1 Kb upstream and downstream from the start codons because there was no information about the promoter and terminator regions in the annotations on ITAG. To investigate the effects of SNP more precisely, promoter and terminator regions should be identified by computational and experimental procedures. On the other hand, the SNP effects on protein functions were inferred by modelled structures because the molecular modelling method has been found useful for estimating the effects of the substitution of amino acid residues on protein function.6,31 Therefore, homology modelling was applied to the tomato genes with cSNPs. As a result, it was predicted that the protein functions (or catalytic activities) of the 200 genes might be altered by the substitutions because the SNPs were located on the candidate functional sites. The uSNPs, dSNPs, and cSNPs have the capacity to affect gene expressions and protein functions, so they might be related to the differences in phenotypes among tomato lines. These SNPs are expected to be applied to marker-assisted selection because they could be considered functional markers. Recently, the large-scale genotyping of SNPs has been achieved using the NGS or array platform. The identification of the SNPs that directly affect protein and gene functions is quite important for molecular breeding and enzymology.4.1.

IntroductionCentromeres of higher eukaryotes generally contain large arrays of repetitive DNA in which the nucleotide sequences often exhibit high divergence rates between species, and even between chromosomes within species.1–3 Such high divergence rates are considered to be caused by recurrent, rapid sequence turnover in which repeat units are replaced by newly occurring sequences. If a new sequence replaces part or the entire centromere region of one chromosome, this sequence will become a chromosome-specific centromeric satellite DNA. If the sequence is transmitted to the centromere regions of other chromosomes by crossing over or other mechanisms and then maintained or amplified there, it will form a suprachromosomal family of centromeric satellite DNA. In humans, more than five suprachromosomal families of alpha satellite DNA are present in the genome,4 where alpha satellite DNA is a repetitive sequence known to be a major DNA component of centromeres of primates (order Primates). Sequences belonging to a suprachromosomal family may further expand to all chromosomes of the host organism, and the time scale on which such turnover events occur can be considered to depend on many factors, including the mutation rate of the satellite DNA, natural selection for or against new sequences, mechanisms of transmission to other chromosomes, and the population size of the host organism. Replacement by a new sequence may occur not as a satellite sequence covering the entire centromere region, but as a sequence occupying a specific region of the centromere. Examples of such sequences that are specific to centromeric constriction regions are expected to be of greater importance to centromere function because the centromeric constriction region is thought to play a central role in kinetochore formation and subsequent chromosome migration to the poles.5,6 There are examples of satellite DNA that are specific to the centromeric constriction region and that are contained in all chromosomes of the host organisms.7,8 To our knowledge, however, there is no example of such a sequence that is specific to the centromeric constriction region and that has undergone a rapid expansion to all chromosomes at the speciation level. In the present study, we identified a sequence of alpha satellite DNA for which there is evidence for such a rapid expansion.The host species in which we identified the novel sequence of alpha satellite DNA was Azara's owl monkey (Aotus azarae). This species is a member of the New World monkey taxon (parvorder Platyrrhini). Alpha satellite DNA is known to be present in the centromere regions of all primate species so far examined, and its most basic structure consists of repeats of fundamental units of around 170 bp in length in a head-to-tail fashion.9–11 Detailed sequence comparisons of alpha satellite DNA between species have revealed that major primate taxons often have taxon-specific sequences or forms of repeat units. In New World monkeys, it is known that the repeat units are around 340 bp in length, and this is thought to be due to an event that occurred in their common ancestor: a set of two fundamental repeat units, with a sequence difference between the units, took the role of the basic repeat unit.12–15 In the present study, we found that Azara's owl monkey carries, in addition to the ‘standard’ alpha satellite DNA, another type of alpha satellite DNA. Results of chromosomal hybridization experiments were surprising in that the additional type of alpha satellite DNA resides in centromeric constrictions, whereas the ‘standard’ type was found to be located in the pericentric regions. We propose, as a plausible explanation of these puzzling results, that the ‘non-standard’ alpha satellite DNA replaced the ‘standard’ alpha satellite DNA in the centromeric constriction regions of all chromosomes after this species diverged from other extant species. Such a rapid replacement of the centromeric constriction regions by a newly occurring sequence has not, to our knowledge, been reported for alpha satellite DNA or other centromeric satellite DNAs of eukaryote species.2. Materials and methods2.1. Animal for collection of cells and DNAWe used a specimen of Azara's owl monkey bred at the authors' institution (Primate Research Institute of Kyoto University; KUPRI). The following is a description of this animal: individual identification number, A34; sex, female; date of birth, 8 July 1987; place of birth, KUPRI; confirmation of species, determination of the karyotype; parents, adults collected in Bolivia and legally imported to Japan in 1977. We took a tiny piece of epithelial tissue from the outer ear when the animal was 17 years and 8 months old and amplified cells on culture dishes for 7 days. The cell culture medium was AmnioMAX-II Complete Medium (Life Technologies Corp.). We collected the cultured cells and used them for extraction of genomic DNA and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. All experiments were conducted according to the Guidelines for Care and Use of Nonhuman Primates (Version 3; June 2010) of KUPRI.2.2. Experiments involving DNA manipulationsThe cloning method we employed was the genomic hybridization technique that has been described in detail in our previous work.16–18 Briefly, a genomic library was prepared, individual clones were amplified in 96-well plates, transferred to membranes, hybridized with labelled genomic DNA, and clones responsible for strong signals were selected. The vector for the library was the fosmid pCC1FOS, and insert DNAs were 40- to 44-kb genomic DNA fragments produced by mechanical shearing and subsequent recovery from an electrophoresis gel. Other experiments, including subcloning, Southern hybridization analysis of genomic DNA, preparation of chromosome spreads, and FISH analysis of chromosomes, were conducted as described previously.16–18 The methods of analyses of nucleotide sequence data are explained in each case.3. Results and discussion3.1. Structure of owl monkey alpha satellite DNAOwl monkeys (species of genus Aotus) are known among primates to exhibit relatively high frequencies of chromosomal fissions and fusions.19–21 The initial purpose of this study was to explore the possibility that repetitive sequences, such as transposons and satellite DNA, are causes of frequent chromosomal rearrangements. For this purpose, we collected clones of repetitive sequences present in the genome of Azara's owl monkey by the genomic hybridization method that is capable of collecting repetitive sequences irrespective of their nucleotide sequence. Among several different repetitive sequences identified, two were found to exhibit similarities to alpha satellite DNAs. The two repetitive sequences were first found by sequencing the terminal regions of fosmid clones 14 and 22. The two sequences were tandem repeats comprising 185- and 344-bp repeat units with occasional length variation. They were designated as OwlAlp1 and OwlAlp2, respectively. Figure 1 shows results of dot blot comparisons between these sequences and with the common marmoset alpha satellite DNA. Dot blot comparison of sequences. The criterion for matching was a 70% match over a window of 10 nucleotides. OwlAlp1 and OwlAlp2 indicate here sequence reads of one terminal region of clones 14 and 22, respectively, that were the first fosmid clones found to carry the respective sequences. MarAlp is the 342-bp consensus sequence of the common marmoset alpha satellite DNA (shown in Supplementary Fig. S1). This consensus sequence was drawn by the authors from sequence data of DDBJ files FJ867326 to FJ867339 (BAC end sequences), by the same method as that for the consensus sequences of the owl monkey alpha satellite DNA (explained in the legend to Supplementary Fig. S1).Dot blot comparison of sequences. The criterion for matching was a 70% match over a window of 10 nucleotides. OwlAlp1 and OwlAlp2 indicate here sequence reads of one terminal region of clones 14 and 22, respectively, that were the first fosmid clones found to carry the respective sequences. MarAlp is the 342-bp consensus sequence of the common marmoset alpha satellite DNA (shown in Supplementary Fig. S1). This consensus sequence was drawn by the authors from sequence data of DDBJ files FJ867326 to FJ867339 (BAC end sequences), by the same method as that for the consensus sequences of the owl monkey alpha satellite DNA (explained in the legend to Supplementary Fig. S1).We collected additional OwlAlp1- and OwlAlp2-carrying fosmid clones by screening the owl monkey genomic library, using the insert portions of clones 14 and 22, respectively, as probes. We then sequenced the terminal regions of the clones obtained (the sequence data were deposited in DDBJ; accession numbers AB761986-AB761996 and AB761997-AB762011 for the OwlAlp1- and OwlAlp2-carrying clones, respectively) and generated consensus sequences of the repeat units identified in these sequence data. The consensus sequences are shown in Supplementary Fig. S1 together with alignments of the respective repeat units.The length of the consensus sequence of OwlAlp2 (344 bp) is close to the length of the consensus sequence of alpha satellite DNA of the common marmoset (342 bp) and that of the other New World monkeys so far examined.7–9 In addition, as shown in Fig. 1, OwlAlp2 shows similarity along its entire sequence to the common marmoset alpha satellite DNA. The sequence similarity (gaps were counted as mismatching nucleotides) was 79, 72, 78 and 78% against the consensus sequence for the common marmoset (the MarAlp sequence described in the legend to Fig. 1), the tufted capuchin (DDBJ L07926), the pygmy marmoset (L07928), and the red-bellied titi (L07930), respectively. OwlAlp2 can, therefore, be regarded as representative of the ‘standard’ type of New World monkey alpha satellite DNA.The entire region of the consensus sequence of OwlAlp1 was included in that of OwlAlp2 (see Fig. 1 for dot blot comparison, and Supplementary Fig. S2 for sequence alignment), with a nucleotide identity of up to 86% and with few gaps. In addition, as explained below, OwlAlp1 was found to be located in the centromeres. Based on these results, we also regard OwlAlp1 as an alpha satellite DNA.3.2. Repeat structure revealed by genomic Southern hybridizationThe consensus sequence of OwlAlp1 carried a recognition site for restriction enzyme NdeI (CATATG), whereas that of OwlAlp2 did not. A site for AvaI (C(T/C)CG(A/G)G) was present in the consensus sequence of OwlAlp2, but not in that of OwlAlp1. Using these enzymes, we obtained further evidence for the presence of the two repetitive sequences in the owl monkey genome (Fig. 2). Genomic DNA was digested either completely or incompletely using these enzymes, electrophoresed on an agarose gel, and then hybridized separately with OwlAlp1 and OwlAlp2. For the incomplete digests, clear ladder patterns of the expected lengths were observed, namely, multiples of 185 and 344 bp for the OwlAlp1 and OwlAlp2 probes, respectively. Both probes gave intense signals under conditions, where detection of a single-copy sequence could not be expected (amount of genomic DNA ~100 ng, time of exposure to X-ray film ~30 s), suggesting that both OwlAlp1 and OwlAlp2 are present in large numbers in the owl monkey genome. Another point to be noted is that strong signals were observed, in addition to the ladder patterns, in the regions in excess of 20 kb. A plausible explanation for this result is that OwlAlp2 is the source of the upper-region signals in the lane for the NdeI digestion and OwlAlp1 is the source in the lane for the AvaI digestion. Genomic Southern blot experiments to confirm the tandem repeat structures. Genomic DNA of the owl monkey (100 ng per lane) was digested with the restriction enzymes indicated above the lanes. For complete and incomplete digestion, an excess amount (10 units) and a smaller amount (0.4 units) were used, respectively. The DNAs were electrophoresed on a 1.0% agarose gel and transferred to a nylon membrane. The membrane was then cut, and the left and right halves were hybridized with the probes for OwlAlp1 and OwlAlp2, respectively. The probes were the insert portions of fosmid clones 14 and 22, respectively. The hybridization conditions were the same as those in our previous work18 and considered to be of a medium stringency. The sizes of the marker DNA fragments are indicated along the left margin.Genomic Southern blot experiments to confirm the tandem repeat structures.

Chromosomal locations revealed by FISH analysisWe next examined the chromosomal locations of OwlAlp1 and OwlAlp2 by FISH analysis of metaphase chromosome spreads (Fig. 3). OwlAlp1 (green signals) was found at the centromeric constrictions of all 50 chromosomes. OwlAlp2 (red signals) was found in 46 chromosomes. The OwlAlp2 signals were located in pericentric regions. No overlap (denoted by a yellow signal) of OwlAlp1 and OwlAlp2 was observed in any of the 46 chromosomes, where both sequences occurred. Of the 46 chromosomes, 2 displayed red signals on both sides of the green signal and 40 exhibited red signals on one side only. The other four chromosomes showed a clear red signal on one side and faint, signal-like colouring on the other side that could be a noise. The merged photograph in Fig. 3 is shown with magnification in Supplementary Fig. S3, with arrowheads indicating the categories of the chromosomes. We examined the hybridization patterns of more than 10 complete metaphase spreads and confirmed identical patterns in all these spreads. FISH analysis of OwlAlp1 and OwlAlp2 for chromosomal locations. The whole fosmid DNAs of clones 14 and 22 were labelled and hybridized with the owl monkey chromosomes. The methods and conditions were the same as those in our previous work,16 including the labelling reagents for the green (OwlAlp1) and red (OwlAlp2) colours.

Confirmation of resultsTo exclude the possibility of an accidental mix-up of the two probes, we repeated the process consisting of the fosmid DNA preparation, sequencing of these DNAs, and FISH analysis using these newly prepared probes. We obtained the same results as those described above (data not shown).3.5. Significance for evolution of centromeric satellite DNAWe summarize our findings as follows: (i) the owl monkey carried two types of alpha satellite DNA: OwlAlp1, consisting of 185-bp repeat units and OwlAlp2 of 344-bp repeat units, (ii) both sequences were present in large numbers in the owl monkey genome, (iii) OwlAlp2 exhibited 70–80% similarity throughout its entire sequence with alpha satellite DNA of other New World monkeys, (iv) OwlAlp1 corresponded to one partial block of OwlAlp2, with 86% sequence similarity, (v) OwlAlp1 was located at the centromeric constrictions of all chromosomes, and (vi) OwlAlp2 was found in most, but not all chromosomes and was located in the pericentric regions.Based on Southern blot analyses and sequencing of alpha satellite DNA of numerous New World monkey species, it has been suggested that their repeat units are around 340 bp.14,15 The New World monkey species examined in these surveys included marmosets (Callimico goeldii and Cebuella pygmaea), tamarins (Leontopithecus rosalia and Saguinus labiatus), squirrel monkeys (Saimiri boliviensis), spider monkeys (Ateles fuscieps), owl monkeys (Aotus trivirgatus), titis (Callicebus moloch), woolly monkeys (Lagothrix lagotricha), capuchins (Cebus apella), and howler monkeys (Alouatta caraya). To our knowledge, there is no report of a New World monkey having two or more major types of alpha satellite DNA. Recently, an extensive analysis of trace archive sequence data of the common marmoset has reinforced the view that alpha satellite DNA of New World monkeys consists of repeat units of around 340 bp.13 The only exception to this known to date is the alpha satellite DNA of the black bearded saki (Chiropotes satanas) that comprises repeat units of about 540 bp. This can, however, be explained as a derivative of the ‘standard’ repeat units due to partial duplication.15 The alpha satellite DNA of the owl monkey is exceptional in a different sense, in that two types of alpha satellite DNA co-exist in the genome in large amounts. The two types are OwlAlp1 and OwlAlp2, and comparison of their consensus sequences with each other and with those of alpha satellite DNAs of other New World monkeys appears to support the hypothesis that OwlAlp2 is the ‘standard’ alpha satellite DNA. We discuss below a possible scenario leading to the current situation of the owl monkey alpha satellite DNA.The most likely explanation for the generation mechanism of OwlAlp1 would be deletion of part of the OwlAlp2 sequence. Since its appearance, OwlAlp1 has undergone large-scale amplification, expansion to all chromosomes, and has replaced OwlAlp2 as the primary alpha satellite DNA. A possibility not to be disregarded is that this replacement may have taken place after Azara's owl monkey (A. azarae) diverged from another species within the genus Aotus. The species designated as A. trivirgatus was included in the genomic Southern blot analysis carried out by other authors,15 in lane 13 of their Fig. 1. A ladder pattern of multiples of ~340 bp is seen in all of the four blots, but that of another unit size, such as 185 bp, is not observed. In addition, strong signals in the upper regions, as observed in our Fig. 2, are not seen in their blots. Accordingly, the animal sample used in their analysis15 would be considered to have carried only one type of alpha satellite DNA that corresponded to OwlAlp2. The species A. trivirgatus was divided into more than eight species, one of which is A. azarae (As we described in the Results and discussion section, species of genus Aotus exhibit high frequencies of chromosomal fissions and fusions. The species redefinition of A. trivirgatus reflected discovery of several new karyotypes.)22,23 Considering the difference in the results of Southern blotting between the two studies, it is likely that the previous study15 used an animal now designated as a species other than A. azarae. Only A. azarae was available for us to examine at the time of our study, and we intend to analyse other species when materials become available.The hypothesis we propose here is that OwlAlp1 was derived from OwlAlp2 and that OwlAlp2 was replaced by OwlAlp1 as the principal alpha satellite DNA after the host species (Azara's owl monkey) diverged from other species. If this hypothesis is true, the results of the present study are the first example of rapid replacement of the centromeric constriction regions by a newly occurring sequence at the speciation level. To our knowledge, there are no similar reports for alpha satellite DNA or other centromeric satellite DNAs of eukaryote species.3.6. An alternative scenarioThe results of sequence comparisons support the hypothesis that OwlAlp1 was derived from OwlAlp2. Currently, we do not have sufficient information to exclude the logical possibility that OwlAlp2 was derived from OwlAlp1. If this assumption were true, the most likely situation would be that OwlAlp1 is a direct descendant of the monomeric sequence from which the ‘standard’ alpha satellite DNA of New World monkeys originates. It is implied in this assumption that the monomer sequence survived in the lineage leading to the Azara's owl monkey but was lost in other New World monkeys, including the owl monkey species designated as A. trivirgatus in the previous study.15 This leads to the conclusion that the most recent common ancestor of New World monkeys carried both monomer and dimer sequences. If this assumption is true, sequences similar in size to OwlAlp1 might be found in other New World monkeys, if a greater number of species are surveyed. The hypothesis on which this scenario stands is less likely but, even if true, the results of the present study suggest an unknown past event that may be key to the evolution of alpha satellite DNA in New World monkeys.Supplementary dataSupplementary Data are available atwww.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by Grants-in-Aid (23657165 to AK, 23470098 to AK, and 22247037 to HH) from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS).

IntroductionProbiotics are defined as live bacterial strains conferring various benefits to the consumer by modulating the intestinal ecosystem, thereby potentially promoting host health and improving host disease risk.1–11 Various probiotic strains have been industrially developed and marketed as a variety of products and applications such as fermented foods and supplements, including yogurt12–15 Most probiotics taxonomically belong to two genera, Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus, that originate from various environments, including the human intestine, and both species are generally regarded as safe.16–18The interaction between administrated probiotics and indigenous microbiota is one of the most attractive and important research areas, particularly because gut microbiota have been shown to be profoundly associated with various host physiology states, including disease, diet, and age through the shift of bacterial composition, as well as metabolic and nutritional processes.19–23 The ability of probiotics to survive through the intestine and to modulate gut microbiota is a critical factor in determining their potential for health-related outcomes.There have been a large number of probiotic intervention studies to assess the impact of probiotics on gut microbiota in healthy adults,24–34 infants, and children,35,36 and in clinical trials on patients with a variety of diseases.37,38 Most probiotic intervention studies were carried out by comparison between probiotic-treated groups and placebo controls and examined only one or two samples from periods before and during intervention or post-intervention for each subject. These experimental designs make evaluation of results obscure from a statistical viewpoint due to the high inter-individual variability of gut microbiota.4 In addition, most of the analyses focussed on the composition of specific bacterial species or groups by conventional methods such as culturing, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), fluorescence in situ hybridization, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, or terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism based on the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene (16S). These conventional methodologies may also overlook subtle changes in bacterial community structure and change of species other than targeted species. Thus, the effect of probiotic administration on the overall structure of gut microbiota is largely unknown.Recently, a high-throughput sequencing-based analysis has been conducted for gut microbiota fed with a probiotic yogurt that provided new insights into probiotics research by utilizing a large-scale dataset.39 However, much more data are required to understand the impact of probiotics on gut microbiota. Recent advances in sequencing technology have enabled us to elucidate complex bacterial communities, including human gut microbiota.40,41 Particularly, 454 pyrosequencing of bacterial 16S gene tags coupled with bioinformatics provides a high-throughput and cost-effective approach for the comprehensive analysis of bacterial communities at the species level.42–48In this study, we developed an analysis pipeline for bacterial communities based on barcoded 454 pyrosequencing of 16S gene tags using modified PCR primers that improved the quantitative accuracy of inferred species composition in human gut microbiota. Using this pipeline, we analysed faecal samples longitudinally collected from individuals with and without probiotic administration to evaluate the effect of probiotics on gut microbiota with respect to species richness and diversity. The results revealed the robustness and stability of gut microbiota of healthy adults in response to probiotic administration.2. Materials and methods2.1. Subjects, faecal sample collection, and probiotic interventionEighteen healthy volunteers (age: 22 ± 3.16 yrs, 6 male, 12 female) were recruited through Azabu University, Kanagawa, Japan (Supplementary Table S1). All subjects were informed of the purpose of this study. This study was approved by the ethical committee of Azabu University, and written consent was obtained from all subjects. No subjects were treated with antibiotics during faecal sample collection. The subjects were divided into six groups (three subjects per group), and each group consumed six different commercially available probiotics supplied from Yakult Honsha Co., Ltd, Kagome Co., Ltd, Morinaga Milk Industry Co., Ltd, Takanashi Milk Products Co., Ltd, Meiji Co., Ltd, and Danone Japan Co., Ltd, respectively (Supplementary Table S1). The number of each bacterial strain contained in the probiotic products was estimated as the genome equivalent by qPCR of 16S ribosomal RNA genes using 27Fmod-338R, followed by pyrosequencing of the 16S amplicons (see below). The genome equivalent per gram or millilitre and the total genome equivalent of each bacterial strain in one probiotic product are summarized in Supplementary Table S1. Three subjects in each group consumed the same probiotics daily for 8 weeks according to the schedule of sampling and probiotic intervention (Supplementary Fig. S1). Faecal samples from 4 weeks before (S00) and 8 weeks during probiotic intervention (S01–S04), and 8 weeks after cessation of probiotic intervention (S05–S08), were collected every 2 weeks from each subject. In total, we collected 158 faecal samples from the 18 subjects because we could not collect 1 sample each from 4 of the subjects.2.2. Recovery of bacteria from faecal samplesFreshly collected faeces (1.0 g) were suspended in 20% glycerol (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd) and phosphate buffered saline solution (Life Technologies Japan, Ltd, Tokyo, Japan), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80°C until ready for use. Bacterial pellets were prepared from frozen faecal samples as described previously.492.3. DNA isolation from bacteriaFaecal DNA was isolated and purified according to the literature, with minor modifications.49 The bacterial pellet was suspended and incubated with 15 mg/ml lysozyme (Sigma-Aldrich Co., LCC) at 37°C for 1 h in TE10. Purified achromopeptidase (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd) was added at a final concentration of 2000 units/ml and then incubated at 37°C for 30 min. The suspension was treated with 1% (wt/vol) sodium dodecyl sulphate and 1 mg/ml proteinase K (Merck Japan) and incubated at 55°C for 1 h. The lysate was treated with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (Life Technologies Japan, Ltd). DNA was precipitated by adding ethanol and pelleted by centrifugation at 3,300 g at 4°C for 15 min. The DNA pellet was rinsed with 75% ethanol, dried, and dissolved in 10 mM Tris-HCl/1 mM EDTA (TE). DNA samples were purified by treating with 1 mg/ml RNase A (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd) at 37°C for 30 min and precipitated by adding equal volumes of 20% polyethylene glycol solution (PEG6000-2.5M NaCl). DNA was pelleted by centrifugation at 8,060 g at 4°C, rinsed with 75% ethanol, and dissolved in TE.2.4. 454 barcoded pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA geneThe V1–V2 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified using forward primer (5'-CCATCTCATCCCTGCGTGTCTCCGACTCAGNNNNNNNNNNagrgtttgatymtggctcag-3') containing the 454 primer A, a unique 10-bp barcode sequence for each sample (indicated in N), and 27Fmod (5'-agrgtttgatymtggctcag) in which the third base A in the original primer 27F was changed to R, and reverse primer (5'-CCTATCCCCTGTGTGCCTTGGCAGTCTCAGtgctgcctcccgtaggagt-3') containing the 454 primer B and reverse primer 338R (5'-tgctgcctcccgtaggagt). PCR was performed in 1 × Ex Taq PCR buffer (50 µl), deoxynucleoside triphosphate (2.5 mM), Ex Taq polymerase (Takara Bio, Inc., Shiga), each primer (10 µM), and 40 ng of extracted DNA under conditions of 2 min at 96°C, 20 cycles of 96°C for 30 s, 55°C for 45 s, and 72°C for 1 min, and a final extension of 72°C for 10 min on a 9700 PCR system (Life Technologies Japan, Ltd, Tokyo, Japan). PCR products of approximately 370 bp were confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis, purified by AMPure XP magnetic purification beads (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Brea, CA, USA), and quantified using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Assay Kit (Life Technologies Japan, Ltd, Tokyo, Japan). Mixed samples were prepared by pooling approximately equal amounts of PCR amplicons from each sample and subjected to 454 GS FLX Titanium or 454 GS JUNIOR (Roche Applied Science) sequencing according to the manufacturer's instructions.2.5. Analysis pipeline for 454 barcoded pyrosequencing of 16S PCR ampliconsWe developed an analysis pipeline for 454 barcoded pyrosequencing of PCR amplicons of the V1-2 region amplified by 27Fmod-338R primers. First, 16S reads were assigned to each sample based on the barcode sequence information. Second, 16S reads that did not have PCR primer sequences at both sequence termini and those with an average quality value < 25 were filtered out. Third, 16S reads containing possible chimaeric sequences that had BLAST match lengths of < 90% with reference sequences in the database were removed. Reads removed in these processes accounted for about 35% of all reads, most of which represented reads lacking PCR primer sequences (Supplementary Table S2). Finally, filter-passed reads were obtained for further analysis by trimming off both primer sequences.All 3000 filter-passed reads of the 16S V1-2 sequences obtained from each subject were deposited in DDBJ/GenBank/EMBL with accession numbers DRA000869–DRA000886.2.6. Assessment of the quantitative accuracy of 16S data using artificial bacterial communitiesTwo artificial bacterial communities (designated ‘mock01’ and ‘mock02’) were constructed by mixing genomic DNA from 10 and 11 different human gut-associated bacterial strains with an appropriate ratio, respectively (Supplementary Table S3). Genome sequences of these microbes were completely sequenced and are publicly available. From these communities, we amplified the V1-2 region by PCR using 27F-338R and 27Fmod-338R primers, the V5-6 region by 787F-1061R primers, and the V1-9 region by 27F-1492R primers. V1-2 and V5-6 amplicons were subjected to 454 pyrosequencing, and V1-9 amplicons were cloned in Escherichia coli, and 3000 clones were sequenced by the Sanger method, and the products were analysed with the ABI3730xl (Life Technologies Japan, Ltd, Tokyo). We also performed duplicate qPCR experiments targeting a specific genomic region of the bacterial strains in the two mock communities. All filter-passed 16S de novo sequences and qPCR data were then analysed by principal component analysis (PCA) to compare and assess the quantitative accuracy (Fig. 1).

PCA analysis of the data was obtained from various methods using mock01 (a) and mock02 (b).

Data analysisTwo databases were constructed for the analysis of 16S sequences. One is the 16S rRNA gene sequence database constructed by collecting 16S sequences of =1200 bp of bacterial isolates from the Ribosomal Database Project v. 10.27. Another database is the reference genome database constructed by collecting genome sequences from the NCBI FTP site (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genbank/, Dec 2011) that includes 1482 complete and 605 draft bacterial genomes.We used 3000 filter-passed reads of 16S sequences for operational taxonomic unit (OTU) and UniFrac distance analysis for each sample. For OTU analysis, clustering of 16S reads was done using a 96% pairwise-identity cutoff with the UCLUST program (www.drive5.com). Representative sequences for each OTU were assigned to bacterial species by BLAST search with a 96% pairwise-identity cutoff against the two databases mentioned above. UniFrac distance analysis was used to determine the dissimilarity (distance) between two communities based on the fraction of branch length shared between two communities within a phylogenetic tree constructed from 16S sequence datasets.44Estimation of OTU numbers by extrapolation (Chao1 and ACE) was calculated with the vegan package (v2.0-5) for R (v2.15.2).3. Results and discussion3.1. Quantitative accuracy of 16S data produced by 454 pyrosequencingPyrosequencing of PCR amplicons of bacterial 16S short variable regions is the most popular and a high-throughput approach to infer and characterize the species composition in bacterial communities.42,45,46,48 The 454 pyrosequencing platform, which can produce over 400 bases per read, is also superior to shorter read-length sequencers with respect to sequence accuracy for single-end sequencing.50,51 However, this PCR-based method has a problem particularly in quantification of the composition of the genus Bifidobacterium, a dominant species in human gut microbiota because the 16S sequence of Bifidobacterium has a few base mismatches with the commonly used PCR primer 27F (or 8F), underestimating this genus in the community.52–55 To improve this, we modified primer 27F to 27Fmod by changing the third base G to R (G or A) in 27F-YM53 that perfectly matched with the annealing site of the Bifidobacterium 16S gene (see Materials and methods).To assess the 16S data using 27Fmod, we compared various 16S sequence and qPCR data obtained from two mock communities (Supplementary Table S3) that are useful to evaluate the quantitative accuracy of 16S-based data and the sequencing error rate.56,57 Quantitative accuracy of the overall bacterial composition was evaluated by comparing the similarity of each data to the expected (‘Expected’) using PCA (Fig. 1). From the PCA data, Euclidean distance was calculated for evaluation of the similarity of each data with the ‘Expected’. The results revealed that the order of their similarities with the ‘Expected’ was the qPCR data = the V1-2 data using 27Fmod > the V5-6 data > the V1-2 data using 27F >> the data of Sanger sequencing-based full-length V1-9, indicating that the use of 27Fmod greatly improved the quantitative accuracy for evaluation of the overall bacterial composition (Supplementary Table S5). This improvement was largely dependent on the improved estimation of the Bifidobacterium content by the use of 27Fmod. The average relative Bifidobacterium content in the two mock communities estimated from the data of V1-2 using 27F was only 1.5% of the ‘Expected’ (100%), whereas the use of 27Fmod increased the relative content to 61% that was also better than that estimated from the data of V5-6 and Sanger full-length analyses (Supplementary Fig. S2). Because qPCR can be used only when genomes of all bacteria in a given community are known, or only for a limited number of specific known species, we concluded that 454 pyrosequencing of the V1-2 region using 27Fmod-338R provided more quantitatively accurate data for bacterial composition in human gut microbiota than that using the conventional 27F primer.We estimated the average error rate of filter-passed V1-2 data using 27Fmod-338R by aligning the V1-2 and reference 16S sequences of bacterial strains used in the two mock communities. The error rate was estimated to be 0.58 and 0.66% for mock01 and mock02 by local alignment, respectively (Supplementary Table S4). These error rates are similar to the previously published data,43,45,50 but lower than in another study.58 The latter may be due to differences in the examined alignment length and between local and global alignments. Errors in 454 pyrosequencing data can be the primary cause for overestimation of the OTU number that is an issue which needs to be improved for accurate estimation of species richness in bacterial communities.59,60 We compared OTU numbers generated from clustering of various qualities of 16S reads with a 96% and a 97% pair-wise identity cutoff. For this comparison, we made and used three datasets: only primer check-passed reads having the highest error rates, filter-passed reads, and selected filter-passed reads having the lowest error rates. The results indicated that a 96% cutoff clustering of error-rich reads and a 97% cutoff clustering of filter-passed reads gave the worse results than a 96% cutoff clustering of filter-passed and selected filter-passed reads (Supplementary Fig. S3). A 97% cutoff was defined for clustering of highly accurate Sanger full-length 16S sequences.61 Therefore, in clustering of pyrosequencing data having higher error rate than Sanger data, the use of a cutoff identity lower than 97% and a lower number of reads are reasonable to reduce overestimation of the OTU number. A 96% cutoff clustering of filter-passed reads gave similar OTU numbers up to 30–50 reads to those of filter-passed reads having the lowest error rates. These read numbers are approximately three to five times the number of input strains. After several trials testing the mock communities, we decided to use 3000–5000 reads per sample for clustering with a 96% cutoff for the analysis of human gut microbiota. Indeed, OTU numbers using a 96% cutoff clustering of 3000 reads decreased about 15% when compared with those using a 97% cutoff clustering.3.2. Species richness and diversity in human faecal microbiota with probiotic interventionWe randomly selected 3000 reads of 16S V1-2 sequences from all filter-passed reads for each sample (Supplementary Table S2) and used 474 000 reads in total from 158 faecal DNA samples of 18 subjects for the analysis of species richness and composition in human gut microbiota. Clustering of all reads with a 96% pairwise-identity cutoff gave a total of 2758 OTUs. After removing the minority OTUs having <0.1% abundance in any samples, 1175 OTUs having =0.1% abundance in at least 1 sample, accounting for 99.1% of all 16S reads, were used for further analysis.We investigated whether administrated strains contained in the probiotic products can be detected in faecal DNA. We sequenced the 16S V1-2 region of all bacterial strains contained in probiotic products used in this study. The BLAST search to the databases indicated that except for the Bifidobacterium longum strain used in Group III, the 16S sequences of all strains in the probiotic products significantly differed from those of the indigenous species phylogenetically closest to the probiotic strains. The 16S sequence of the B. longum strain used in Group III was almost identical to that of an indigenous Bifidobacterium species, so that we used a distinguishable additive Lactococcus lactis strain in this product for the detection of administrated bacteria in Group III samples. The 16S sequences of these probiotic strains were included in the databases constructed in this study, and the 16S reads assigned to administrated strains had the average similarity between 99.4 and 99.9% identities with the reference sequences (data not shown). The 16S reads assigned to probiotic or additive strains were detected in samples (S01–S04) during probiotic intervention [designated ‘Pro(+)’] at various frequencies, but almost none were detected in samples (S00 and S05–S08) without probiotic administration [designated ‘Pro(-)’] (Supplementary Table S6). The administrated probiotic strains were shown to be more frequently detected in samples during the intervention than in the pre- and post-intervention periods using different detection methods such as culturing, targeted PCR, and hybridization.24,26–28,30,32,33,62 In the present study, two probiotic Lactobacillus and one additive Lactococcus strains were detected in post-intervention samples in three subjects with a minimum count, respectively. The similarity of three 16S sequences was 99.4, 99.7, and 100% identity with those of administrated Lactobacillus and Lactococcus strains, indicating that these are administrated strains. The survival of some probiotic strains in the post-intervention period was also reported previously.28,30 Our data suggested that some probiotic strains seem to be able to persistently colonize the intestine and their survivability may be related to metabolic activity in the intestine.63,64 Probiotic Bifidobacterium strains were not detected in any Pro(-) samples. However, we found two distinct 16S sequences both assigned to Bifidobacterium animalis in two subjects APr37 and APr39. One showed a high similarity of >98% identity with the 16S sequence of the administrated B. animalis and was detected with high frequency only in the Pro(+) samples, whereas another showed a low similarity of 96.5–97.4% identity (a mean of 97.2%) with low frequency in both the Pro(-) and Pro(+) samples. These data suggest the presence of unknown indigenous species phylogenetically close to, but distinct from, probiotic B. animalis in human gut microbiota. The total number of bacteria contained in each probiotic product was varied between 109 and 1010, showing no large difference in quantity among them (Supplementary Table S1). No clear correlation was also observed between the number of bacteria in the products and the frequency in detection of the administrated strains in the Pro(+) samples. From these observations, the frequency of administrated bacteria detected in faeces may not be largely affected by their amounts in the products. Therefore, detection of Lactobacillus brevis and Lactobacillus delbrueck at relatively low level in faeces cannot be simply explained by the difference in a dose, but could be considered the association with several factors such as their survivability in the intestine, diet, or physiological conditions of subjects.We analysed species richness (OTU number) in the Pro(+) and Pro(-) samples. Supplementary Figure S4 shows the change in OTU numbers for every sample in each subject, indicating that OTU numbers vary dramatically for every sample. Most of the variation can be attributed to single OTUs representing the minority species. We averaged the OTU numbers of the Pro(-) and Pro(+) samples and compared them for subject, group, type of probotics (Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium), and all combined samples, respectively (Fig. 2). The average OTU numbers in 6 out of 18 subjects were decreased in the range of the ratio of 0.83–0.95 in the Pro(+) samples when compared with the Pro(-) samples, whereas those in other 12 subjects were increased in the range of the ratio of 1.01–1.43. For group, only Group IV showed a decrease in the average OTU number in the Pro(+) samples with the ratio of 0.94. For type of probiotics and all samples, the average OTU numbers in the Pro(+) samples were slightly more abundant (approximately 1.07-fold) than those in the Pro(-) samples, but no statistical significance was observed in any dataset. The increase in OTU number in the Pro(+) samples was largely due to the minority species (Supplementary Fig. S4), whereas the abundance of the majority species (OTUs containing =10 reads) was almost constant over time. We performed the same analysis using different sets of 3000 reads for each subject. The analysis reproducibly showed the similar pattern and the degree of the change in OTU numbers to which the minority species is largely attributed (data not shown). These data indicate that administration of probiotics tends to increase species richness in faecal microbiota that may be beneficial for the consumer because the species richness in faecal microbiota of subjects afflicted with disease such as inflammatory bowel disease is significantly reduced when compared with that of healthy subjects.65Change in OTU number in faecal microbiota with and without probiotic administration.

The error bars represent standard deviation.We obtained the average weighted and unweighted UniFrac distances within Pro(-), within Pro(+), and between Pro(-) and Pro(+) samples for every group, probiotic types, and all subjects, respectively (Fig. 3). High UniFrac distance implies high variability of microbiota structure within and between samples. If the difference between any pair of the three distances is statistically significant, it can be considered that probiotic administration significantly affected the overall microbiota composition. We found the largest difference between weighted UniFac distances of the Pro(+) and Pro(-) samples in Group VI. However, statistical evaluation of this difference by the Student's t-test showed no significance (P-value > 0.05) for 781 out of 1000 times (Supplementary Table S7). These data imply high stability of gut microbiota to probiotic administration for all subjects examined. We also analysed UniFrac distances of intra-subject gut microbiota (Fig. 4). Although 5 subjects (APr02, 12, 16, 37, and 39) showed a significant difference in the UniFrac distances between Pro(-) and Pro(+) samples, the results showed that both weighted and unweighted distances between Pro(-) and Pro(+) of all intra-subjects were significantly lower than the average distance of the 18 unrelated subjects. The Welch's t-test for these differences showed statistical significance (Supplementary Table S8). We also performed the UniFrac distance analysis using different 16S datasets of 5000 reads for group, type of probiotics, all subjects, and intra-subject. The results similarly showed no statistical significance in differences between any pair of the 3 UniFrac distances and the significantly lower UniFrac distance of each intra-subject than that of the 18 unrelated subjects (data not shown). Thus, these data suggested that the perturbation of microbiota elicited by probiotics in an intra-subject did not overcome the inter-subject variations of gut microbiota, supporting high intra-specificity and stability of gut microbiota.66,67 This robustness of gut microbiota of adults is in contrast with the profound effect of antibiotic administration on adult gut microbiota68 and the observed response of gut microbiota of infants fed with probiotics, in which the infant gut microbiota composition was considerably affected by probiotics.36 A short-term dietary intervention study showed that in controlled feeding of the same diet to subjects over 10 days, a marked change was observed within 1 day after the intervention initiation.69 In the present study, no significant difference was observed between samples before (S00) and first samples (S01) after the intervention initiation (data not shown). It would be valuable to analyse faecal samples collected within a few days after administration of probiotics for evaluation of the short-term effect of probiotics.

Identification of bacterial species showing significant increase or decrease by probiotic administrationAlthough our results suggested that administration of probiotics had almost no effect on the overall structure of gut microbiota, it is possible to identify bacterial species largely responding to the administrated probiotics at the OTU/species level. We surveyed OTUs showing an increase or a decrease between the Pro(+) and Pro(-) samples by comparing the number of 16S reads for each OTU. We first enumerated the OTUs showing =2-fold change between the Pro(-) and Pro(+) samples for each subject, and the quantity difference was also obtained by subtracting the 16S read number of the Pro(+) samples from that of the Pro(-) samples. This is because OTUs showing a high quantity difference, but less fold change may also have substantial influence on gut microbiota composition. We found several OTUs significantly changed by probiotic administration, including OTUs assigned to both the indigenous and administrated strains (Fig. 5). We listed 88 OTUs (7.5% of all analysed 1175 OTUs) showing significant change of =3-fold, among which 30 OTUs changed by =10-fold (Supplementary Fig. S5). We excluded 6 OTUs assigned to the administrated strains from the 30 OTUs and obtained 24 OTUs assigned to the indigenous species, including OTU00072 assigned to Streptococcus salivarius that showed significant change in 2 subjects (Supplementary Table S9). We also found seven OTUs showing significant difference in quantity between both samples (Supplementary Table S10). Of the combined 32 OTUs (2.7%), 18 were increased and 14 were decreased by probiotic administration. Many of the OTUs showing a significant increase were assigned to minority species in the Pro(-) samples, but some increased up to nearly 7% in abundance (e.g. OTU00372 assigned to Eubacterium rectale). On the other hand, the OTUs showing a significant decrease were almost undetected in the Pro(+) samples. Phylum-level species assignment showed that species belonging to the phylum Firmicutes were most largely affected by both probiotics, and all species belonging to the phylum Bacteroidetes were affected only by Lactobacillus probiotics (Table 1). The 32 OTUs were assigned to 27 indigenous species, among which 4 species (Clostridium clostridioforme, Eubacterium eligens, E. rectale, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii) were assigned by 8 different OTUs and 1 species (S. salivarius) was assigned by the 2 same OTUs as described above. All these species except for S. salivarius were found to show significant change only in one subject, indicating that response of the indigenous species to probiotics is highly individual specific (Supplementary Fig. S6). Two different OTUs (OTU02677 and OTU02748) assigned to F. prausnitzii, of which the reduction is known to be correlated with inflammatory bowel disease,70 were found to both decrease and increase in the same subject (APr40) by probiotic administration, suggesting that these two phylogenetically close species may have the diversity of response to probiotic action. We also examined distribution of the 32 OTUs in the subjects. The results revealed that 4 subjects (APr11, 20, 22, and 37) did not have such OTUs and 8 subjects had only 1 OTU, whereas 4 subjects (APr01, 02, 31, and 39) had more than 4 OTUs showing significant change (Fig. 6), suggesting their uneven distribution in the 18 subjects. These data imply existence of the sensitive and less sensitive responders to probiotic action and if so, it would be interesting to investigate the relation between gut microbiota type and its response to probiotics.

The present study using large datasets enabled us to more comprehensively and precisely evaluate the effect of probiotics on gut microbiota than the previous probiotic intervention researches in which the analysis exclusively focussed on only several limited bacterial species using conventional methods. Our data further support the high inter-subject variability and the high intra-subject stability that is the current common view for the feature of adult gut microbiota. A recent study of gut microbiota in twins demonstrated that probiotics had almost no effect on the community structure, but affected the gene expression of microbiota.39 To more deeply understand the potential function of probiotics, the analysis of bacterial and host cell's transcriptome and intestinal metabolome is required.Supplementary dataSupplementary Data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported in part by the global COE project of ‘Genome Information Big Bang’ from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT) of Japan (to M.H. and K.O.), a research project grant from Azabu University to H.M. and by a grant from the Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST) program of the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) to K.O.We thank Dr Todd D.

Many techniques for sophisticated genetic manipulations to model diseases have been established and researchers hope that the results obtained can be extrapolated to humans. Although this assumption is true in some cases, there are several areas of biomedical research where this proves to be more difficult. These areas include neuroscience, behavioural research, toxicology, drug development, and infectious diseases.1 To overcome these limitations, efforts have been made to carry out biomedical studies in non-human primate model organisms, as the latter are more closely related to humans.One of these established non-human primate model organisms is Callithrix jacchus (common marmoset). The marmoset is a small new world monkey and offers many advantages as an experimental animal over other non-human primates. It is small in size, which makes it comparatively easy to handle. Furthermore, it has been bred in captivity and its progeny have been maintained for >30 years in laboratory environments. Also, it does not harbour or transmit hazardous infectious agents. Therefore, the common marmoset is increasingly used in biomedical research worldwide. For example, models of autoimmune diseases involving the central nervous system have been developed in the common marmoset and it has been used extensively as a primate model.2–4 More recently, genetically modified common marmosets have been produced successfully and their transgenes have been transmitted through the germ line.5 In the future, it would be very useful to develop transgenic marmosets as models of human diseases.Intensive efforts have been made to develop research tools for using the common marmoset as an experimental animal. For instance, several lines of monoclonal antibodies have been prepared, which are directed against immunity-related antigens of the marmoset.6–8 Many, but not all anti-human antigen antibodies cross-reacted with the corresponding marmoset antigens, so it was necessary to establish marmoset-specific antibodies.9 A pilot gene analysis study reported cDNA sequencing of immunity-related genes.10 Based on genome-wide analyses, a draft sequence of the common marmoset, known as caljac3, was produced and made available to the public via the genome browser of the University of California Santa Cruz (http://genome.ucsc.edu/).The current study describes the preparation of cDNA libraries for the common marmoset using five different cell types/tissues, which resulted in the identification of 290 426 high-quality EST sequences. These sequences were characterized by comparison with the sequences of six primate species, including humans. Overall, the EST sequences transcribed in the marmoset shared many common features with those from humans, whereas a small fraction was found to be unique to the marmoset.2. Materials and methods2.1. RNA extraction and library constructionCytoplasmic RNA was extracted from the liver (MLI), brain and spinal cord (MSC), spleen (MSP), testis (MTE), and embryonic stem (ES) cells (MES) of the common marmoset using Trizol reagent. Marmoset ES cells were cultured as described previously.11 Full-length cDNA libraries were constructed from the total RNAs of the aforementioned tissues/cells using a vector-capping method.12 cDNAs generated from MLI, MSC, MSP, MTE, and MES were ligated into pGCAP1, pGCAPzf3, pGCAPzf3, pGCAP10, and pGCAP10 vectors, respectively. Colonies of Escherichia coli transformants were picked randomly, inoculated into 384-well plates using a Flexys colony picker (Genomic Solutions Ltd., Cambridgeshire, UK), and stored at -80°C.2.2. EST sequencingColonies were picked from 99 plates for MSC; 200 plates each for MES, MSP, and MTE; and 201 plates for MLI (Supplementary Table S1). Sequencing templates were prepared using a TempliPhi DNA Amplification Kit (GE Healthcare UK Ltd., Buckinghamshire, UK). The sequencing reactions for the 5'-end directional ESTs were conducted using a BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Inc., CA, USA). The sequence primers used for pGCAP1, pGCAP10, and pGCAPzf3 were 5'-AGGCCTGTACGGAAGTGT-3', 5'-AGGCCTGTACGGAAGTGT-3', and 5'-CAAGGCGATTAAGTTGGGT-3', respectively. The sequencing reaction products were purified by ethanol precipitation and loaded onto 3730 DNA Analyzers (Applied Biosystems Inc.).2.3. Selection of high-quality EST dataThe raw sequence data were basecalled using the KB basecaller program, which identified 345 600 sequences. A cross-match program was applied to the raw data to remove sequences derived from vectors and those added as caps during plasmid construction (-minimach 10, -minscore 20). Low-quality sequences [quality value (QV) = one for each nucleotide ± 3 neighbouring nucleotides measuring <105 in length] were masked by N (average QV > 15). If N was longer than 10 nucleotides, sequences located 3' of these N were removed. Finally, only high-quality sequences longer than 100 nucleotides were selected and used in further analyses (see the high quality column, Supplementary Table S1). There were 290 426 high-quality ESTs, which represented 84% of the raw sequence data. High-quality EST sequences were obtained frequently and were relatively abundant (93%) in MES and MTE, whereas their frequencies were comparatively low (72–80%) in MLI, MSC, and MSP.The sequence length was higher in MES and MTE (702–706 nucleotides), than in MLI, MSC, and MSP (514–551 nucleotides; see the length column in Supplementary Table S1). The differences in the average length of readable sequences and the differences in the frequency of high-quality ESTs probably reflected the quality of each cDNA library. The cDNA libraries were also evaluated for transcription initiation sites by searching for the presence or absence of cap structure-derived guanine nucleotides at the extreme 5' end of each EST (see the G-cap column, Supplementary Table S1). The frequency of G-cap-positive sequences was >80% in all five cDNA libraries, indicating that the synthesis of most cDNAs was initiated at the 5' end.2.4. Registration of the sequencesAll of the EST sequences were deposited in the DNA Databank of Japan. Their accession numbers are as follows; HX373156 to HX444163 for MES cDNAs, HX444164 to HX500395 for MLI cDNAs, HX500396 to HX529651 for MSC cDNAs, HX529652 to HX591448 for MSP cDNAs, and HX591449 to HX663542 for MTE cDNAs.2.5. Tools used for sequence analysesThe following tools were used for sequence analysis: BLAST (The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) finds regions of local similarity between sequences. The program compares nucleotide or protein sequences to sequence databases and calculates the statistical significance of matches),13 BLAT (The BLAST-Like Alignment Tool uses the index to find regions in the genome likely to be homologous to the query sequence),14 CD-HIT (a widely used program for clustering and comparing protein or nucleotide sequences. CD-HIT helps to significantly reduce the computational and manual efforts in many sequence analysis tasks and aids in understanding the data structure and correct the bias within a dataset),15 CAP3 (a DNA sequence assembly program),16 cross_match (this tool uses cross_match to mask vector/adapter sequences and optimally trim vector sequence and/or polyA/T trail. It takes a set of sequences to be masked, and a set of vectors/adapters used to perform masking),17 EMBOSS (getorf finds and extracts open reading frames),18 and InterProScan (a protein domains identifier).193. Results and discussion3.1. EST clustering and assemblyThe 290 426 sequences obtained by normalization of ESTs as in Section 2.3 were clustered and/or assembled to estimate how many genes/transcriptional units were read as ESTs (Table 1). Overlapping sequences were clustered within the longest sequence using the CD-HIT program, whereas overlapping sequences were assembled and extended into a contig using the CAP3 program. According to the CD-HIT program, the number of clusters varied from 10 010 in MLI to 29 028 in MTE. The summed number of contigs and singletons ranged from 8831 in MLI to 25 909 in MTE. According to both programs, MTE had the highest number of clusters/assemblies, suggesting that the testis had the greatest number of expressed transcriptional units. Notably, there were some more clusters than assemblies in each cDNA library. In fact, the total and non-redundant numbers in the five different libraries were 62 210 clusters and 60 568 assemblies (Table 1). This small difference (62 210 versus 60 568) suggests that most of the EST sequences obtained correspond to the mRNA 5' end (as for another indication of similar performance of CD-HIT and CAP3, see Supplementary Fig. S1). Clustering of ESTs by CD-HIT and assembly of ESTs by CAP3Parameters used in CD-HIT and CAP3 programs were default.Clustering of ESTs by CD-HIT and assembly of ESTs by CAP3Parameters used in CD-HIT and CAP3 programs were default.3.2. Assignment of marmoset ESTs to the Refseq mRNAs of primatesAll 290 426 sequences were examined by comparing them with the known sequences registered at the NCBI as Refseq mRNAs (http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/RefSeq/). Refseqs from six different primates were used in the reference dataset, including Homo sapiens, Pan troglodytes, Pongo abelii, Macaca mulatta, Nomascus leucogenys, and C. jacchus. It should be noted that the human Refseqs were based on cDNA sequences, whereas the Refseqs from other primate species were based mainly on the predictions of genomic sequences. The search program used was BLASTn and the threshold of significant homology was set to 1E-100, which was a very strict criterion.A total of 239 920 and 231 084 sequences shared homology with human and marmoset Refseqs, respectively (Table 2). Homology with the combined Refseqs from the six primates was found for 251 587 sequences (85.6% of 290 426). Therefore, these 251 587 sequences were designated as primate homologues. The average length of the homologous sequences was 528 nucleotides. Of these 251 587 sequences, 4974 sequences were identical to their corresponding Refseq sequences, whereas 94 102 sequences shared 100% nucleotide sequence identity only with the aligned homologous regions. Additionally, 931 sequences shared homology with the Refseqs of non-primates. Most of these sequences were homologous to mouse Refseqs, suggesting that they were probably derived from mouse cells that were used as a feeder layer to culture ES cells. Assignment of common marmoset ESTs to primates’ RefseqEST sequences of common marmoset (total 290 426) were referred to primates’ Refseq mRNA that are registered at NCBI. Homology was searched using BLASTn and judged significant at <1E-100.Assignment of common marmoset ESTs to primates’ RefseqEST sequences of common marmoset (total 290 426) were referred to primates’ Refseq mRNA that are registered at NCBI. Homology was searched using BLASTn and judged significant at <1E-100.Out of the above described 251 587 primate homologues, only sequences that shared homology with the Refseqs of all six primates were extracted, and that yielded 199 511 sequences. Then, for each of 199 511 sequences, the alignments between the EST and Refseq with the highest score among the six primates were selected, and 199 511 sequences were grouped into six for each primate species. Finally, the average identities and coverage were calculated using the alignments for each primate species (Table 3). As expected, the highest sequence identity (99%) was between the marmoset EST and marmoset Refseq. The average sequence identities between the marmoset EST and the Refseqs of the other five primate species were in a similar range (94–95%). Thus, the sequences differed by ~5% between the marmoset and the other five primates. The coverage was highest between the marmoset EST and human Refseq (91%), whereas it was lowest between the marmoset EST and marmoset Refseq (84%). This difference of 6% corresponded to 25 nucleotides, so it is likely that the alignment of the EST and marmoset Refseqs started 25 nucleotides downstream from the 5' end of the marmoset Refseq. This might suggest that the 5'UTR of the marmoset Refseq was not predicted precisely from its genomic sequence. Identity and coverage between homologous marmoset ESTs and primates’ RefseqIdentity (%) represents a degree of identity between the aligned two sequences of high-scoring segment pairs, whereas coverage (%) represents a ratio of aligned sequence length over an entire length of EST. See the text as for the details how identity and coverage were calculated.Identity and coverage between homologous marmoset ESTs and primates’ RefseqIdentity (%) represents a degree of identity between the aligned two sequences of high-scoring segment pairs, whereas coverage (%) represents a ratio of aligned sequence length over an entire length of EST. See the text as for the details how identity and coverage were calculated.In the above assignment of marmoset ESTs to primates’ Refseqs in Table 2, the Refseqs used as references can be re-classified into non-overlapping, distinct gene entities. Homologous sequences of 239 920 and 231 084 corresponded to 13 825 human and 13 499 marmoset genes, respectively (see the numbers in parenthesis in Table 2). In addition, we searched for HomoloGenes (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/homologene) that are found in common among Homo sapiens, Pan troglodytes, and Macaca mulatta, and detected 9879 Homologenes. When identities and coverage between marmoset ESTs and primates’ Refseq were recalculated for these 9879 Homologenes (see the numbers in parenthesis in Table 3), coverage increased by 2–3%, whereas identity between marmoset and human remained the same (94–95%). Thus, it appears again plausible that the sequences diverge by 5% between marmoset and other primates including human.3.3. Mapping marmoset ESTs to the human genomeEach marmoset EST sequence (total 290 426 reads) was mapped to the human genome (hg19) using the BLAT search program. This showed that 99.1% of the ESTs (287 849 reads) mapped to the human genome (Table 4). This mapping result was filtered further using the UCSC Genome Browser and a pslCDnaFilter. Finally, 93.2% (270 673 reads) of the marmoset ESTs were assigned specifically and exactly to the human genome. Mapping of ESTs on the human genomeMarmoset ESTs (290 426) were mapped on the human genome (hg19) by using a BLAT search program (-stepSize = 5, -minScore = 50, -minIdentity = 80, -repMatch = 2253). This initial mapping gave a number of 287 849 (99.1%) ESTs. These ESTs were then filtered, following a UCSC Genome Browser and using a pslCDnaFilter (-minId = 0.85, -minCover = 0.75, -globalNearBest = 0.0025, -minQSize = 20, -minNonRepSize = 16, -ignoreNs, -bestOveralp). Basis for adopting this filtering condition was as follows. A use of the condition such as (-minId = 0.95, -minCover = 0.25) selected only 159 309 ESTs (54.9%), indicating -minId = 0.95 to be extremely strict in the exactness. Therefore, we lowered the -minId to 0.85 (and -minCover = 0.25) and found the reasonably selected numbers of exact ESTs. Thus, under this -minId of 0.85, we then tried to improve the specificity by increasing -minCover to 0.75 (since 0.90 appeared too strict, 0.90 was not used). This -minCover number of 0.75 is roughly equal to the expected coverage of coding sequence [the average length of EST was 619 nt, and the average length of 5'UTR of human transcripts is 170 nt, therefore, an expected coverage between coding sequences and ESTs would be (619–170)/619 = 0.73]. Eventually, a condition of -minId = 0.85, -minCover = 0.75 filtered 270 673 ESTs (93.2%) as exact and specific.Mapping of ESTs on the human genomeMarmoset ESTs (290 426) were mapped on the human genome (hg19) by using a BLAT search program (-stepSize = 5, -minScore = 50, -minIdentity = 80, -repMatch = 2253).

Eventually, a condition of -minId = 0.85, -minCover = 0.75 filtered 270 673 ESTs (93.2%) as exact and specific.The nucleotide sequence identity between aligned sequences was calculated after each EST had been mapped to the genome (Supplementary Fig. S2). The majority of ESTs shared 90–96% identity with the human genome. The relatively low identity between the ESTs and human sequences was analogous to the identity between the EST and Refseq shown in Table 3. It should be noted that the degree of mapping to the human genome did not differ significantly among the five cDNA libraries (data not shown).The CAP3 method identified 17 232 contigs (Table 1). The contig sequences represented those that were read multiple times in the overlapping regions and they were considered more reliable than single-read singletons. These 17 232 contigs were mapped onto the human genome according to the filtering method shown in Table 4. Furthermore, information from human Refseqs was used to determine whether the mapped contigs corresponded to exonic sequences of the human gene. This approach identified 15 089 contigs (88% of 17 232) that mapped onto the human genome and that corresponded to human Refseqs. These 15 089 contigs, which consisted of 218 857 ESTs, were considered to be representative of the genes that are commonly transcribed in marmosets and humans.Of these 15 089 contigs, ESTs that were present in only one type of cDNA library were identified. Of these tissue-specific contigs, those with the highest numbers of constitutive ESTs are shown in Table 5. The contigs with >1000 ESTs were ALB, HPR, ORM2, and ORM1 from MLI, and PRM1 from MTE. Most of the genes listed in Table 5 are known to be characteristic of each specific cell type/tissue. Top five genes expressed abundantly in each cDNA libraryShown are the contigs that were detected only in one out of five cDNA libraries and possessed larger numbers of constituting ESTs.Top five genes expressed abundantly in each cDNA libraryShown are the contigs that were detected only in one out of five cDNA libraries and possessed larger numbers of constituting ESTs.Supplementary Table S2 shows previously reported cDNA/EST studies of primates other than the marmoset.20–24 These species include Pan troglodytes, Macaca fascicularis, and Chlorocebus sabaeus, while the tissues included the brain, skin, liver, B lymphocytes, bone marrow, pancreas, spleen, thymus, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. As the current study is the first example of the use of monkey-derived ES cells in EST studies, the ES-specific transcripts are mentioned briefly (see Supplementary Table S3 where the contigs containing >5 ESTs are listed).The most notable were LIN28A, NANOG, and SOX2 because, together with OCT4, they are known to reprogram human somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells.25LIN28A and NANOG contribute to the maintenance of pluripotency in stem cells.26–28C6orf221 (also known as ECAT1, ES cell-associated transcript 1) and DPPA5 belong to the same gene family, and they are expressed specifically in human ES cells.29,30 The frequent appearance of the claudin family (see CLDN6, CLDN9, CLDN7, and CLDN4) was also noted, although its biological significance is not known.We noted that there was another category of contigs that was mapped onto the human genome, but not located in exonic regions (i.e. contigs that shared no homology with human Refseqs). These comprised 808 contigs (4.7% of 17 232) with 5578 ESTs. These 808 contigs represented transcribed genes in the marmoset. Although they were conserved in the human genome, they did not appear to be transcribed as genes; hence, they were not characterized as human genes.Next, the number of marmoset cDNA libraries, in which each contig was expressed, was determined. The number of contigs with ESTs detected in libraries 1 (i.e. only MES), 2 (i.e. MES and MTE), 3, 4, and 5 (all of MES, MLI, MSC, MSP, and MTE) were 562, 195, 28, 7, and 6, respectively (808 in total). Of the 562 contigs, 29 were found in MES, 31 in MLI, 28 in MSC, 87 in MSP, and 387 in MTE (562 in total). It appeared that the genes expressed in the marmoset testes (387/562 = 69%) had an increased likelihood of not being expressed in humans compared with the genes expressed in other tissues (31%/4 = 7.8%).Supplementary Table S4 shows the 20 contigs whose constituting ESTs’ numbers were the largest among the 808 contigs. Interestingly, the five contigs that had the highest numbers of ESTs (ID: 198, 15591, 1258, 1567, and 3721) also had ESTs in all five libraries. In the previous paragraph, it was noted that six contigs were expressed in all five libraries. It was found that five out of these six contigs were widely expressed at a high level in the marmoset. This suggests that actively expressed genes in the marmoset may even be non-transcribed as genes in humans. Many of the remaining genes in Supplementary Table S4 were expressed in a combination of tissues e.g. MLI and MSP, or MLI and MSC, or only in MTE.The 808 contigs described above were mapped onto the human genome, but did not have any corresponding human Refseqs. The human genome browser at UCSC also supports mapping of RNA-seq and large intergenic non-coding RNAs (linc RNA).31,32 The locations of these RNA-seq/linc RNAs were checked in relation to the marmoset ESTs mapped onto the human genome. The tissues that are used in common in RNA-seq/linc RNA studies31,32 and the current study are the liver, brain, and testis; hence, 138 contigs expressed in MLI, 125 in MSC, and 516 in MTE (total 779) were used for the analyses (Supplementary Table S5). This showed that 500 contigs (64% of 779) matched RNA-seqs, while 98 contigs had corresponding sequences in RNA-seq and linc RNA. However, 259 contigs (33% of 779) did not have any counterparts in RNA-seq or linc RNA, suggesting that they were not expressed as RNA.In summary, of the 808 contigs that did not have a corresponding human Refseq, two-thirds were probably expressed as non-coding RNA, whereas the other third appeared to be silent. This potentially suggests that these 808 may have lost their characteristics as genes during human evolution.The degree of conservation and/or divergence in marmoset and human genes was analysed using the following approach as well. Supplementary Fig. S3A shows a flow chart of the method used for selecting ‘unknown genes.’ First, getorf in EMBOSS was applied to extract 60 568 unigenes (see Table 1 where 60 568 represents the sum of contigs and singlets). Thus, sequences were selected that contain an open-reading frame spanning an initiating methionine through to a stop codon, with a poly(A) tail at the 3' end. The G-cap was preserved in most ESTs, so the selected sequences probably represented ‘full-length’ cDNAs. This approach selected 3151 unigenes.Each unigene was mapped onto the human genome. In total, 2595 sequences were mapped onto the human genome. Of the 556 marmoset sequences that could not be mapped onto the human genome, 127 were annotated and identified using the Refseq information of all living species, while 311 (306 + 5) shared homology with sequences registered in EST/nr sequence databases. The remaining 118 unigenes could not be annotated, suggesting that they represent potentially unknown genes.Notably, only 1 sequence was derived from MLI and MSC, 3 from MSP, 14 from MES, while 104 from MTE. This might indicate comparatively abundant expression of unknown genes in the marmoset testis. The length of the polypeptides encoded by the ‘unknown genes’ ranged from 11 to 131 amino acids, with an average of 47 (Supplementary Fig. S4). It should be noted that no known domains/motifs were detected in these ‘unknown’ amino acid sequences using the INTERPRO program.It is possible that the 118 genes with ORFs might not encode polypeptides but may represent non-coding RNAs. In fact, five shared homology (1e-5) with non-coding RNAs in a comprehensive database (http://www.ncrna.org/frnadb/) and a marmoset-derived non-coding RNA database (ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release70/fasta/callithrix_jacchus/ncrna/). Furthermore, 66 out of 118 genes could be aligned with the human genome if a 75% sequence similarity was employed, and each of these alignments covered more than half of each sequence. Therefore, a significant portion of the 118 genes had features of both polypeptide-coding genes and non-coding RNAs. Supplementary Fig. S3B and its legend provide further details on the unbiased approach used to identify unknown genes.3.4. Availability of the resourcesA Web server of marmoset cDNAs has been constructed (http://marmoset.nig.ac.jp/index.html), in which each marmoset EST sequence is mapped onto the human genome. Information accessible via the human genome browser can be obtained on this server, including the Ensembl gene annotation, Refseqs, and RNA-seq/linc RNA. This Web server can be used as a search engine, so the marmoset EST sequences can be BLASTed and the results displayed. The cDNAs libraries and/or the clones are available upon request from the DNA Bank, RIKEN BioResource Center (RDB no. 6388–6392). These deposited resources are expected to be valuable for future studies that use the common marmoset as an experimental animal model.Supplementary dataSupplementary Data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingSequencing work was supported by a Special Fund for RIKEN Genomic Sciences Center.S.T. and M.S. are very grateful to Atsushi Toyoda (National Institute of Genetics, Mishima, Japan) for his continuous encouragement, which helped us to accomplish this work.

IntroductionThe H-NS protein is a major nucleoid component and is conserved amongst <U+03B3>-proteobacteria. Recent studies have revealed that H-NS plays a central role in transcriptional silencing of horizontally acquired genes1–5 by binding to the nucleation sites in AT-rich sequences and forming higher-order nucleo-protein complexes.6–9Escherichia coli and related enteric bacteria possess four H-NS homologues, such as H-NS, StpA, Hha and YdgT,10 and their mutual interactions have been demonstrated.11–13Both H-NS and StpA comprise two domains, with the N-terminal domain involved in dimerization and oligomerization and the C-terminal domain involved in DNA binding.14 Inactivation of hns was found to result in de-repression of hundreds of genes in E. coli and Salmonella.2,4,14,15 In contrast, stpA inactivation is not associated with any notable phenotype under standard growth conditions in E. coli, probably because its function is compensated by H-NS. Conversely, it has been suggested that StpA partially compensates hns inactivation.16–18 Also, stpA transcription is induced in an hns mutant, and growth impairment of the hns/stpA double mutant is severer than that of the hns single mutant.19,20 Recently, we reported that the StpA-binding regions on the E. coli K-12 chromosome essentially overlap with those of H-NS, and that StpA binding was reduced to one-third in the hns mutant, but H-NS binding was unaffected by stpA inactivation.21 Thus, StpA is considered to be a molecular back-up of H-NS in E. coli.13,19–21Hha structurally resembles the N-terminal domain of H-NS,10 and its expression is sensitive to osmolality.22 Hha was first identified as a repressor of the haemolysin operon (hlyCABD) in E. coli 5K.23–25 In Salmonella enterica, Hha negatively regulates hilA and rtsA, each encoding activator of virulence genes.26–29 Furthermore, the Ler regulator of the esc operon in E. coli O157:H7 is negatively regulated by Hha.30 These virulence genes are under the control of H-NS, and Hha is generally believed to modulate the DNA-binding and nucleoid-organizing properties of H-NS.10,24,25 Gel retardation analysis has shown that Hha binds to the regulatory regions of the rtsA and the hilA gene.26,29 Till now, functional studies of Hha have been hampered by the presence of its paralog, YdgT.10 Transcription of ydgT is induced by hha inactivation, while its overexpression was shown to repress the hly operon in the hha mutant,11 suggesting that the functions of Hha and YdgT may overlap. Furthermore, simultaneous inactivation of hha and ydgT in S. enterica induced numerous genes located in AT-rich, horizontally acquired DNA sequences, many of which are reported to be targets of H-NS.31,32Taken together, these data indicate that Hha/YdgT function with H-NS/StpA to regulate the expression of horizontally acquired genes. The lack of clear DNA-binding domains in Hha and YdgT strongly suggests that they interact with H-NS/StpA to confer their regulatory activity. However, it remains possible that Hha/YdgT may repress gene expression independently of H-NS/StpA. In addition, the molecular mechanism through which Hha/YdgT modulate the activity of H-NS/StpA in a subset of genes in the H-NS/StpA regulon remains to be clarified. Hha/YdgT are conserved in non-pathogenic E. coli, and Hha is reportedly involved in regulating htrA expression to promote survival at high temperatures,33 and in regulating biofilm formation in E. coli K-12.34To gain further insight into the basic function of Hha/YdgT, we compared the transcriptome profiles of hha/ydgT double-inactivation mutants with those of hns/stpA double-inactivation mutants in E. coli K-12. In addition, we examined the effects of hha/ydgT inactivation on the chromosomal binding of H-NS, and the effects of hns/stpA inactivation on the chromosomal binding of Hha as shown below.2. Materials and methods2.1. Bacterial strains, plasmids and mediaThe E. coli K-12 strains (strain W3110 and its derivatives) and plasmids used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table S1. The construction of mutant strains and the media used in this study are detailed in Supplementary Methods.2.2. Transcriptome analysisThe detailed procedures for RNA purification, probe preparation and data acquisition using the Affymetrix E. coli genome 2.0 array are described in Supplementary Methods. The raw data (CEL format) from transcriptome experiments have been deposited in ArrayExpress under accession number E-MEXP-3811.2.3. Profiling chromosome binding of H-NS and HhaH-NS and Hha binding profiles were determined using a slight modification of the previously described ChIP-chip21 and ChAP-chip methods.35,36 The detailed procedures for these analysis were described in Supplementary Methods. The raw data (CEL format) from the ChIP-chip and the ChAP-chip experiments have been deposited in ArrayExpress under accession numbers E-MEXP-3812, E-MEXP-3813, respectively.3. Results and discussion3.1. Transcriptome analysis of hha/ydgT and hns/stpA double mutants of E. coli K-12To avoid compensatory effects of the paralogous proteins, we created hha/ydgT and hns/stpA double mutants of E. coli K-12, and compared their transcriptome profiles with that of wild-type. Also, we used cells cultivated under high osmolality condition (LB medium containing 0.3 M NaCl) in which Hha regulated the expression of proteins in E. coli.37Escherichia coli cells were grown aerobically and the expression level of each gene was assessed using an Affymetrix E. coli genome 2.0 array. Up- or down-regulation in the mutant was judged by the difference in the expression level of >4- or <0.25-fold (>2- or <-2-fold in log2 scale) compared with that of wild-type, with a false discovery rate (FDR) of <0.1.The single inactivation of hns had a significant impact on the transcriptome, resulting in up-regulation of 172 genes and down-regulation of one gene (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Table S2). Up-regulation of gene expression in the hns mutant could reflect indirect effects of down-regulation of the hns homologues. However, we believe that this is unlikely, since hns inactivation up-regulated the expression level of stpA, hha and ydgT by 1.98-, 1.41- and 2.03- (log2) fold, respectively, compared with that in wild-type (Supplementary Table S3). In contrast, the single inactivation of stpA had a far less significant effect (Fig. 1B). Transcriptome analysis of mutant cells. (A–F) Log-scale scatter plots (log2) of the transcriptional intensities of each gene in hns (A), stpA (B), hns/stpA (C), ydgT (D), hha (E) and hha/ydgT (F) mutant cells (vertical axis) compared with those in wild-type cells (horizontal axis).

The average signal intensities from two independent experiments using each strain are plotted. Genes up-regulated in hha/ydgT mutant cells are shown as grey dots. (G) Venn diagram indicates the number of shared and unique genes up-regulated in hha/ydgT and hns/stpA mutant cells.The hns/stpA double mutant showed further alterations in the transcriptome profile, with up-regulation of 583 genes, 167 of which were included in the 172 genes up-regulated in the hns single mutant, and down-regulation of 86 genes compared with wild-type (Fig. 1C and Supplementary Table S4). Notably, the up-regulation of hha and ydgT seen in the hns mutant also occurred in the hns/stpA double mutant (Supplementary Table S3), indicating that the up-regulation observed in the hns/stpA mutant was not caused by the down-regulation of hha and/or ydgT. Of the genes up-regulated by hns inactivation, 69% (119 of 172) have been proposed to be horizontally acquired.38,39 Similarly, 62% (363 of 583) of the genes up-regulated in the double mutant were horizontally acquired.The single inactivation of ydgT had a much less effect, up-regulating only one gene (yhjX) and down-regulating six genes (yfiD, sraA, pdhR, tke1, yifE and yejG; Fig. 1D). In contrast, single hha inactivation up-regulated 113 genes and down-regulated 8 genes (Fig. 1E and Supplementary Table S5). In addition, it moderately up-regulated ydgT [1.48- (log2) fold], but did not cause significant changes in hns and stpA (FDR > 0.1; Supplementary Table S3), indicating that the observed up-regulation was a direct consequence of the hha inactivation. The genes up-regulated in the hha mutant included those related to osmotic (e.g. osmY, kdpA and kdpC) and carbon-starvation (e.g. csiD and rmf) stresses, which is consistent with the previous finding that genes related to these stresses were induced in hha mutant cells.34 The hha/ydgT double inactivation showed transcriptional alterations in a similar number of genes, with 134 genes up-regulated and 5 genes down-regulated (Fig. 1F and Supplementary Table S6). Consistent with the previous observation in S. enterica,32 most of the genes that were up-regulated in hha/ydgT-inactivated cells (108 of 134) are believed to be horizontally acquired (Supplementary Table S6). No statistically significant change was detected in the expression of hns or stpA in the hha/ydgT mutant (Supplementary Table S3).Only 12 genes were commonly up-regulated in the hha and hha/ydgT mutants (Fig. 1E, grey dots; Supplementary Tables S5 and S6). Furthermore, although most of the genes that were up-regulated in the hha/ydgT mutant were also up-regulated in the hns/stpA mutant (see below), only 47 of the 113 genes that were up-regulated in the hha single mutant were up-regulated in the hns/stpA mutant (Supplementary Tables S4 and S5). These results suggest that the mechanism responsible for the up-regulation of genes in the single hha mutant differs from that in the hha/ydgT double mutant, although we did not further explore the molecular mechanism causing this phenotype in the hha mutant.In contrast to the altered transcriptome profile in the hha mutant, 131 of the 134 genes that were up-regulated in the hha/ydgT double mutant were also up-regulated in the hns/stpA double mutant (Fig. 1G, Venn diagram; Fig. 1C, grey dots; Supplementary Tables S4 and S6). Of the three genes that were significantly up-regulated only in the hha/ydgT mutant, two were probably also up-regulated in the hns/stpA mutant, though at a low signal intensity (fimZ) or low induction level (yhjA). Thus, only ycgX appears to be regulated by Hha/YdgT and not by H-NS/StpA. Taken together, these results indicate that Hha and YdgT are additionally required for the repression of a subset of genes that are repressed by H-NS and StpA in E. coli K-12.3.2. H-NS binding profiles are not altered by hha/ydgT inactivationTo investigate whether Hha/YdgT modulate the DNA-binding activity of H-NS/StpA, we examined effects of hha/ydgT inactivation on the chromosomal binding of H-NS. To this end, we introduced the hha/ydgT mutation into a strain in which H-NS was tagged with 3× Flag and placed under the control of the native promoter.5,21 Wild-type and hha/ydgT mutant cells expressing H-NS-3× Flag were cultivated in LB (+0.3 M NaCl) medium, formaldehyde treated to crosslink H-NS-Flag with the chromosomal DNA, and then harvested and subjected to immunoprecipitation of H-NS–DNA complexes. The DNA fragments co-purified with H-NS were mapped onto the chromosome by using a custom Affymetrix tiling array. As shown in Figure 2A, scatter plots of the H-NS binding signals in both strains showed a genome-wide positive correlation (correlation coefficient = 0.91). H-NS-binding regions, 417 regions in wild-type and 530 in the hha/ydgT mutant, were reproducibly observed in duplicate ChIP-chip analyses (Supplementary Fig. S1 and Table S7). Moreover, 96% (400 of 417) of the binding regions in wild-type overlapped with those in the hha/ydgT mutant (Supplementary Table S7).

In addition, there was no significant difference between the effect of Hha/YdgT inactivation on H-NS binding in the vicinity of genes up-regulated only in hns/stpA mutant (Fig. 2C) and of those up-regulated in both hha/ydgT and hns/stpA mutants (Fig. 2D). Thus, we concluded that the hha/ydgT mutation had little effect on the DNA-binding property of H-NS.3.3. Hha associates with the chromosome in an H-NS/StpA-dependent mannerTo examine whether Hha/YdgT interact with target genes independently of H-NS/StpA, we analysed Hha binding on the chromosome in wild-type and the hns/stpA mutant. As the expression level of Hha from the native promoter was expected to be low, to obtain clear chromosomal binding profile by the ChIP-chip analysis,12 cells of wild-type and the hns/stpA mutant expressing 6× histidine-tagged Hha (6 × His-Hha) from a multi-copy plasmid were cultivated in LB (+0.3 M NaCl) medium and subjected to a modified ChIP-chip analysis (ChAP-chip analysis) in which His-tagged Hha–DNA complexes were affinity purified using nickel affinity resin. Western blot analysis of cell extracts with an anti-His antibody indicated that the expression level of 6 × His-Hha in wild-type and hns/stpA mutant cells was similar (data not shown). Therefore, the binding signals of Hha consistently overlapped with those of H-NS in wild-type (Fig. 2C and D lane 3; Supplementary Fig. S1), while the Hha-binding signals seen in wild-type disappeared in the hns/stpA mutant (Fig. 2C and D lane 4; Supplementary Fig. S1). Scatter plots of Hha- and H-NS-binding signals (Fig. 2B) support the genome-wide positive correlation of H-NS- and Hha-binding signals (correlation coefficient = 0.77). Seventy-two per cent (302 of 417) of the H-NS-binding regions were found to overlap with the Hha-binding regions, and conversely 74% (352 of 476) of the Hha-binding regions overlapped with the H-NS-binding regions (Supplementary Table S8). This lesser level of overlap between the Hha- and H-NS-binding regions may be due to the low binding signals against the high background seen in the ChAP-chip analysis of Hha binding, which may reflect its indirect interaction with the chromosomal DNA. It should also be noted that Hha binding exhibited no preference towards the genes up-regulated in hns/stpA and those up-regulated in both hha/ydgT and hns/stpA under the experimental conditions (compare lane 3 in panels Fig. 2C and D). However, it is possible that the reduced amount of Hha/YdgT expressed from the native promoter form a limited amount of H-NS/StpA-Hha/YdgT complexes that recognize the specific regions. Further analysis is needed to clarify the possibility.Only five regions were found to be possible Hha-binding regions in the hns/stpA mutant (Supplementary Table S9), although the signals observed in the lacI and hha genes may probably be due to contamination from the multi-copy plasmid harbouring lacI and hha. Therefore, H-NS/StpA-independent chromosomal binding of Hha appear to be possible only in the intergenic region of ygjI–ygjH and the coding region of fecA. We concluded that the binding of Hha to the chromosome essentially depends on H-NS/StpA.3.4. Hha/YdgT support transcriptional repression by H-NS/StpA bound to the coding sequencesIt has been suggested that the binding of H-NS is biased to intergenic regions, where H-NS plays a regulatory role, while its binding to coding regions may be linked to chromosome organization in E. coli.40 Our inspection of H-NS-binding signals in and around the genes that are co-repressed by Hha/YdgT and H-NS/StpA suggest that the coding sequences of Hha/YdgT-dependent genes tend to be bound by H-NS (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, such H-NS binding often extended into multiple coding sequences (Fig. 3B). In contrast, the H-NS binding seemed to be localized in the intergenic regions of the genes exhibiting Hha/YdgT-independent up-regulation (Fig. 3C). H-NS binding signals for genes up-regulated in the hns/stpA mutant alone or in both hns/stpA and hha/ydgT mutants. Figures represent the typical H-NS binding signals classified as ‘coding (single)’ [in the vicinity of gene (yfdF; the thick black arrow) that were up-regulated in both hns/stpA and hha/ydgT mutants] (A), ‘coding (multiple)’ [in the vicinity of genes (yhiD, hdeB, hdeA, hdeD, slp, gadE, gadW and gadX) that were up-regulated in both hns/stpA and hha/ydgT mutants] (B), and ‘intergenic’ [in the vicinity of genes (yehL and yehM) that were up-regulated only in hns/stpA mutants] (C). The H-NS-binding regions (concatenated) are shown by black lines at the bottom of the figures.H-NS binding signals for genes up-regulated in the hns/stpA mutant alone or in both hns/stpA and hha/ydgT mutants. Figures represent the typical H-NS binding signals classified as ‘coding (single)’ [in the vicinity of gene (yfdF; the thick black arrow) that were up-regulated in both hns/stpA and hha/ydgT mutants] (A), ‘coding (multiple)’ [in the vicinity of genes (yhiD, hdeB, hdeA, hdeD, slp, gadE, gadW and gadX) that were up-regulated in both hns/stpA and hha/ydgT mutants] (B), and ‘intergenic’ [in the vicinity of genes (yehL and yehM) that were up-regulated only in hns/stpA mutants] (C). The H-NS-binding regions (concatenated) are shown by black lines at the bottom of the figures.To perform genome-wide evaluation of these phenomena, we visually inspected the H-NS-binding regions in wild-type into two classes: those localized to intergenic regions (‘intergenic’) and those extending to coding sequences (‘coding’) by concatenating the H-NS-binding regions with the corresponding intergenic regions or the (successive) coding sequences. A half of the concatenated H-NS-binding regions was classified as ‘intergenic’, as their peaks were located at intergenic sequences (Supplementary Fig. S2A and B), while the remaining half was classified as ‘coding’ (106 regions; Table 1), as their peaks were located at coding sequences or their H-NS-binding signals evenly covered coding sequences (Supplementary Fig. S2C and D). About a half of the ‘coding’ extended into multiple coding sequences (Supplementary Fig. S2E and F; Table 1). Ten regions were classified as both ‘coding’ and ‘intergenic’, as they included the intergenic sequences of one gene and the coding sequences of another gene(s) (for example, see Supplementary Fig. S3D). Number of H-NS-binding regions in ‘intergenic’ and ‘coding’ sequencesaH-NS-binding regions covering the coding sequence(s) of single and multiple gene(s) are indicated as ‘Single’ and ‘Multiple’, respectively.Number of H-NS-binding regions in ‘intergenic’ and ‘coding’ sequencesaH-NS-binding regions covering the coding sequence(s) of single and multiple gene(s) are indicated as ‘Single’ and ‘Multiple’, respectively.We then examined the H-NS-binding regions in and around the genes that were up-regulated in the hns/stpA mutant, and found that those regions were classified as 73 ‘intergenic’ and 89 ‘coding’ (Table 1). Subsequently, we evaluated the relationship between the localization of H-NS-binding signals and the ability of the genes to undergo Hha/YdgT-dependent or -independent repression by H-NS/StpA (Table 2). A majority of the genes up-regulated in both hha/ydgT and hns/stpA mutants was localized in and around H-NS-binding regions classified as ‘coding’ (108 genes; 88%; Supplementary Fig. S3), including those covering multiple coding sequences. Hha/YdgT-independent genes were more enriched (136 genes; 31%) in the genes that were regulated by binding of H-NS/StpA to their intergenic regions than Hha/YdgT-dependent genes (11 genes; 9%), although many Hha/YdgT-independent genes were also found in ‘coding’ H-NS-binding regions (243 genes; 55%). These results suggest that Hha/YdgT are required for efficient transcriptional repression by H-NS/StpA bound to coding sequences.

We evaluated the correlation of transcriptome alteration and H-NS binding profiles according to the W3110 annotation, and analysed the locations of the 436 genes up-regulated only in the hns/stpA mutant and the 122 genes up-regulated in both the hns/stpA and hha/ydgT mutants.

Possible mechanism of transcriptional repression by H-NS and HhaA number of mechanisms have been proposed to explain the inhibition of transcriptional initiation or elongation by H-NS.10,14,41,42 H-NS binds to two distinct sites and forms a bridge structure to block the binding of RNA polymerase (RNAP) to a promoter43 or trap RNAP in an open complex at a promoter, thereby inhibiting transcriptional elongation.44,45 Others have shown that the binding of H-NS upstream of a regulatory region interferes with either promoter clearance or progression of RNAP,46 and H-NS has been shown to constrain local DNA topology to regulate the promoter activity of supercoiling-sensitive genes.47–49 Mutations impairing the ability of H-NS and its homologue of Pseudomonas aeruginosa termed MvaT to form higher-order oligomers have been shown to reduce their abilities to repress transcription of the E. coli proU and P. aeruginosa cupA fimbria genes.18,50,51 The formation of a DNA–protein filament through cooperative polymerization of MvaT or H-NS along DNA and of protein bridges to constrain DNA loops through the interaction of the DNA–protein filaments were suggested to be important for transcriptional repression.7,52 The direct interaction of Hha and C-terminally truncated H-NS (H-NS64) was previously demonstrated by NMR and fluorescence anisotropy.53,54 In the absence of Hha, H-NS64 formed only dimers even at a high concentration; in the presence of Hha, however, H-NS64 formed high-molecular-mass Hha-(H-NS64) hetero-oligomers.53 We speculate that Hha enhances the higher-order oligomerization of H-NS/StpA and contributes to the formation of DNA–protein filaments and DNA loops, which often include the coding sequences of target genes. The 5.5 protein of phage T7 binds to the oligomerization domain of H-NS to inhibit the oligomerization of H-NS and the repression of more than 200 genes, although the DNA binding of H-NS is not abolished.55 Up-regulation of genes observed in the hha/ydgT mutant might be similar to that caused by the T7 5.5 protein. Even though H-NS binding is not greatly affected in hha/ydgT mutant cells, the oligomerization of H-NS/StpA might be reduced, resulting in the up-regulation of the genes that are normally repressed by oligomerized H-NS/StpA. However, we do not yet fully understand the mechanism underlying the enhancement of H-NS/StpA oligomerization by Hha/YdgT and the repression of transcription by oligomerized H-NS/StpA. Future work is needed to elucidate the co-repression activity of Hha/YdgT and H-NS/StpA.Supplementary dataSupplementary Data are available atwww.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI [grant numbers 23241062 (to N.O.) and 23580114 (to T.O.)].We thank the editor and reviewers for valuable comments to revise the manuscript.Supplementary data"

IntroductionThe emergence of next-generation DNA sequencing techniques accelerate tremendously the increment of sequences deposited in public nucleotide databases. The wealth of sequence data stimulates wonderful opportunity to understand the biological process of various living species. To achieve this aim, two of the essential steps are identifying all protein-coding genes and trying to assign their functions. They are jointly named as genome annotation. The quality of the genome annotation is very vital. If one genome could not be annotated accurately but still submitted to the public database, not only subsequent researches based on it may encounter problems but also annotations of after sequenced closely related genomes would be influenced. The annotation errors may propagate and finally affect more and more genomes. Recognizing this serious problem, Ouzounis and Kap1 appealed to update regularly the genome annotation by latest database and methods.As for prokaryotes, dozens of genomes have been re-annotated.2 Three kinds of re-annotations are often performed in sequenced prokaryotic genomes. First, and rather early, falsely predicted protein-coding genes are eliminated from the original annotation using composition-based methods. For example, Wang and Zhang3 suggested that 172 annotated genes were very unlikely to encode proteins in the genome of Vibrio cholerae based on single-nucleotide frequencies. One of the typical re-annotation cases of archaea was associated with Aeropyrum pernix K1, in which protein-coding genes were over-annotated up to 60% by the original sequencing institute.4–6 It is lucky that this major error has been corrected by using proteome approaches and bioinformatics methods.7–10Amsacta moorei entomopoxvirus may have the most over-annotated protein-coding genes among sequenced viruses.11 Guo and Yu12 suggested that ~38 of 294 originally annotated genes did not encode proteins based on the Z-curve method. By using another graphical method, Yu and Sun13 confirmed this speculation.Second, some genes may be missed by the original annotation and could be picked up by the ab initio gene finding method and further confirmed by the similarity alignment or transcription and/or protein expression proofs. For example, Zhou et al.14 newly added 278 potential genes by the similarity alignment and another 147 by detectable mRNA transcriptions in the genome of Xanthomonas campestris. Very recently, Du et al.15 newly added eight potential genes by the similarity-based method in the archaeon Pyrobaculum aerophilum.Assigning functions to hypothetical proteins constitutes the last kind of re-annotation. This type of re-annotation may be performed by using the homology alignment or by functional genomic experiments. For example, 149 hypothetical proteins were assigned detailed functions according to the strict homology information in the genome of Erwinia carotovora.16 A similar method was employed to the genome of P. aerophilum and 80 hypothetical proteins were assigned with functional information.15 Based on cellular fractions and expression profiles under different culture conditions, Okamoto and Yamada17 provided general functional information for 126 hypothetical proteins in the genome of Streptococcus pyogenes.In this study, we performed all three types of re-annotation in 10 complete genomes of the Neisseriaceae family. As far as our knowledge goes, the only example involved with all three types of re-annotation is the updated annotation in the genome of P. aerophilum.15 Through them, the outdated annotation may be corrected as far as possible. However, alternative approaches may be utilized to obtain similar results with the systematic method used here. Compared with our previous work,15 here, we used transcriptional analyses to validate the effectiveness of our method to pick up new genes. The Neisseriaceae family belongs to ß-proteobacteria. Among the 10 Neisseriaceae strains analyzed in this work, seven belong to the genus Neisseria and all can colonize the mucosal surfaces of many animals. Neiserria meningitidis, as one of the most common causes of bacterial meningitis, are most virulent in human.18Laribacter hongkongensis is a recently sequenced bacterium associated with invasive blood stream infections in patients with liver cirrhosis as well as gastroenteritis and traveler's diarrhea.19–22 Updated annotations of these bacterial strains would help to understand their pathogenicities and environment adaptation capacities.2. Material and methods2.1 Data sourceTen complete genomes of the family Neisseriaceae were included in this work. They were Chromobacterium violaceum ATCC 12472 (RefSeq accession number: NC_005085), L. hongkongensis HLHK9 (NC_012559), N. gonorrhoeae FA 1090 (NC_002946), N. gonorrhoeae NCCP11945 (NC_011035), N. lactamica 020-06 (NC_014752), N. meningitidis 053442 (NC_010120), N. meningitidis alpha14 (NC_013016), N. meningitidis MC58 (NC_0031112), N. meningitidis Z2491 (NC_003116) and Pseudogulbenkiania sp. NH8B (NC_016002). Among them, two strains of N. gonorrhoeae and four strains of N. meningitidis and L. hongkongensis are pathogens. In fact, dozens of strains in the family Neisseriaceae have been sequenced.23 However, the NCBI RefSeq project provides curated annotations only for these strains.24 In this work, we chose the 10 complete genomes to perform re-annotation.2.2 Method to pick up missed genesIn each sequenced genome, there are always some bona fide genes that have been missed by the original annotation. For example, Warren et al.25 uncovered 38 895 intergenic open reading frames (ORFs), readily identified as putative genes by similarity to currently annotated genes, from 1297 prokaryotic replicons based on across-genome alignment. New genes could be confirmed by the similarity alignment or by transcription or proteome analyses. In this work, we first used the ZCURVE26 program, which is freely available at http://tubic.tju.edu.cn/Zcurve_B/, to pick out all candidate genes that did not have same 5' terminals with all genes in the original annotation. The candidate may overlap one annotated gene with their sequences but they did not correspond to the same reading frame. Then those candidate new genes would be filtered by blast27 against the NCBI nr database. If one candidate met the following three conditions, it would be regarded as genuine genes: (i) it had the significant similarity (E-value < 10-20, Coverage > 60% and Identity > 50%) with annotated genes in bacteria beyond the same genus in the database, and it had the similar length with the counterpart (difference < 20%); (ii) it had counterpart in the cluster of orthologous groups (COG) database, i.e. it could be assigned within an existed COG cluster; (iii) it did not overlap annotated genes with any bases or it had a smaller E-value and a higher identity score against functional genes in the other genomes in the case of overlapping. This process has been standardized in this work. For each of the 10 strains, all parameters in the whole process were fixed.2.3 Method to eliminate over-annotated genesA composition-based method was used to eliminate over-annotated genes. The method is based on the Z-curve representation of the DNA sequences, which has been successfully used to find genes in various microbes.3,7,9,12,15,16,28,29 In this analysis, 33 Z-curve variables were adopted,26 including nine variables of phase-dependent single-nucleotide frequencies28 and 24 of phase-dependent dinucleotide frequencies.26 In fact, there are 36 variables denoting phase-dependent dinucleotides.30 However, long-range correlations between the first and third codon positions tend to be weaker and so 12 variables associated with them were discarded. For details about these variables, refer to Guo et al.26 Besides 33 classifying features, the Fisher linear discrimination algorithm was used to optimally differentiate protein-coding and non-coding sequences, the procedure was as detailed previously.28 The training set of the classifying model comprised a positive sample set and a negative sample set. The positive sample set was those function-known genes with definite names, e.g. gyrB as the name of gene encoding protein of DNA gyrase subunit B. The negative sample was generated by a randomly shuffling sequence of the positive sample and thus destroying its natural structure. After parameters have been trained based on positive and negative samples, all hypothetical proteins would be decided to be genuine genes or falsely annotated non-coding sequences. The latter would be eliminated in the updated annotation. The scatter plot in Figure 1 illustrates the effectiveness of the method to eliminate non-coding ORFs from the collection of hypothetical proteins. A web server has been constructed to check hypothetical genes and eliminate non-coding ORFs in any sequenced bacterial or archaeal genomes, which is freely available at http://147.8.74.24/Zfisher/. Distribution of GC2 versus GC3 for four types of sequences. The x-axis indicates the value of GC2 and the y-axis denotes the value of GC3. (A) For 969 function-known genes in L. hongkongensis; (B) for 86 predicted non-coding genes in L. hongkongensis; (C) for 915 retained hypothetical genes in L. hongkongensis and (D) for 20 horizontally transferred genes in P. aeruginosa.Distribution of GC2 versus GC3 for four types of sequences.

Those with highly significant similarities with function-known genes in the database would be assigned the same functions. To achieve more sensitive results, amino acid (aa) sequences of hypothetical genes were actually aligned against protein sequences translated from the nr nucleotide database.27 To ensure strict homology, the aligned length covered at least 80% of each gene with the identity of >70% and the E-value of <1e-20. According to the above thresholds, if one hypothetical gene with a translated aa sequence matched two or more proteins with the same functions, then the function information would be transferred to the hypothetical protein.182.5 Bacterial strains and growth conditionsLaribacter hongkongensis HLHK9 is a clinical isolate in Hong Kong and its complete genome sequence was available recently.21 It was grown at 37°C, in brain heart infusion (BHI) broth or on BHI agar plates (BD, USA). Chromobacteriumviolaceum ATCC 12472 is a type strain and its complete genome sequence is also available in Genbank.31Chromobacteriumviolaceum was cultured in nutrient broth or nutrient agar (Oxoid, England) at 26°C. Unless indicated otherwise, bacteria were cultured to the log-phase for experiment (~0.6 at OD600).2.6 Reverse transcription–polymerase chain reactionThe total bacterial RNA was extracted by using the RNeasy mini kit following the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, Germany). Genomic DNA was removed by DNase digestion using RNase-free DNase I (Roche Diagnostic, Switzerland) as described by the manufacturer. Reverse transcription (RT) was performed using Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. One microlitre of cDNA was used as a template for RT–polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with each specific primer pair. Mock RT–PCR without reverse transcriptase was also conducted as control. Triplicate assays using RNAs extracted in three independent experiments were performed for each target gene.3. Results3.1. Eliminated non-coding ORFs and the graphic proofAll ab initio gene finders would predict a certain number of non-coding ORFs as potential genes and these predictions constitute false positives of gene annotation.32 To ensure less species-specific genes be missed from the annotation result, one or more ab initio gene finders are necessary in the process of annotating prokaryotic genomes.33 Often, similarity alignment methods are combined with ab initio methods to achieve better results. Because of the intervention of the latter, it is not inevitable that some non-coding ORFs will appear in the final list of potential genes in every sequenced genome.34 They may constitute source of annotation errors of closely related genomes and thus should be eliminated from the current annotations. According to the RefSeq24 annotation for each Neisseriaceae strain, all annotated genes could be classified into three groups. The first group contains only function-known genes with definite names. The last group includes those genes encoding hypothetical proteins. The remaining genes constitute the second group. Obviously, the first group encodes proteins without any uncertainty. Coding potentials of the third group would be doubted to some extent. Therefore, we focus on the third group, hypothetical genes, in this work.Numbers of genes belong to the first and third groups and genomic characteristics of each strain are listed in Table 1. As can been seen, ratios of the numbers of the first and third class genes to the total gene number vary significantly. For example, N. gonorrhoeae FA 1090 has the highest ratio of hypothetical genes, whereas almost the least ratio of function-known genes with definite names. This illustrates that the function annotation in this strain is much poorer compared with the other strains. The variation of the gene ratio is associated with many factors, such as annotation methods, genomic G + C contents and the number of closely related genomes that have been sequenced when annotating the strain. Statistical information in genomes of the 10 Neisseriaceae strainsaInformation of published date were extracted from http://www.genomesonline.org/.Statistical information in genomes of the 10 Neisseriaceae strainsaInformation of published date were extracted from http://www.genomesonline.org/.The training set needed the Z-curve method with 33 variables was used to filter over-annotated genes from the RefSeq annotations of 10 Neisseriaceae strains. For each of them, function-known genes with definite names were chosen and shuffled sequences were correspondingly generated. Thus, the training set was obtained. For example, in L. hongkongensis, the training set was comprised of 969 function-known genes that correspond to positive samples, and 969 shuffled sequences corresponding to negative samples. Based on the training set, the discriminant model was built. The accuracy of the model based on 5-fold cross-validation is listed in Table 2 for each of the 10 strains. With the model, each hypothetical protein was decided to be a genuine gene or a falsely predicted ORF. Consequently, 86 hypothetical genes were predicted as a non-coding ORF by the Z-curve method in the genome of L. hongkongensis. Accuracy based on 5-fold cross-validation and the COG ratio in each strainAccuracy based on 5-fold cross-validation and the COG ratio in each strainPrediction of 86 hypothetical genes as non-coding is based on the assumption that all protein-coding genes should have similar nucleotide composition in one specific bacterial genome.28 That is to say, hypothetical genes should have similar composition features with function-known genes in L. hongkongensis. If not, they should have been over-annotated as genes. The scatter plot of the nucleotide distribution of 969 function-known genes and 86 predicted non-coding ORFs is shown in Figure 1A and B. As can be seen, non-coding ORFs are distributed far away from function-known genes. In detail, almost all function-known genes lie far above the diagonal and G + C contents of them at the second codon positions are much lower than that at the third codon positions, whereas almost all 86 non-coding ORFs locate around the diagonal, indicating that their G + C contents at the second positions are approximate to that at the third codon positions. The need to encode functional proteins exerts severe constrain on the nucleotide composition of genes.35 Previous work showed a similar nucleotide distribution of functional genes in seven high G + C prokaryotic genomes.36,37 Therefore, the distinct nucleotide composition between 86 hypothetical genes and the function-known genes draw them away from being genuine genes. Nucleotide compositions for the 915 retained hypothetical genes are shown in Figure 1C. Different from 86 predicted non-coding ORFs, most of the retained hypothetical genes have a similar distribution of GC2 versus GC3 with function-known genes.The COG database has been widely used during the annotation process of sequenced bacterial genomes.5,38 Belonging to a COG is believed to be a very reliable evidence of protein-coding genes.38,39 In L. hongkongensis, 954 among 967 function-known genes have been assigned a COG code. However, only 1 of 86 predicted non-coding ORFs has the COG code. Based on the above analyses, these 86 ORFs are very unlikely to encode proteins. COG statistics information for the other nine strains is shown in Table 2. As can been seen, the COG ratio of predicted non-coding ORFs is extremely lower than that of genes with known functions and definite names. Summarily, 7260 among 7426 (97.8%) genes belonging to the first class are assigned with COG codes in the 10 Neisseriaceae genomes. In comparison, only 5 of 418 (1.2%) predicted non-coding ORFs could be assigned to the COG database, indicating that our prediction is much accurate in another sense. These five ORFs with COG codes are likely to constitute falsely predictions of our method because having COG counterparts has been believed to be one of the reliable evidences of encoding proteins. Finally, we only eliminated the remaining 413 hypothetical proteins from the RefSeq annotations in the 10 complete genomes. Details of them are listed in Supplementary Table S1.As is well known, horizontally transferred genes may also have a different nucleotide composition with core genes to some extent. The DarkHorse database stores horizontally transferred genes in sequenced bacterial genomes. Entries in it are all those predicted by comparative genomes methods and hence are very reliable. However, the information of HGT is not available for L. hongkongensis in the DarkHorse. To circumvent this problem, we fall back on the bacterial strain Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA01, which also has a high G + C content, and the distribution of GC2 versus GC3 for function-known genes has shown to be similar to that of L. hongkongensis.36 Furthermore, as an early sequenced genome, the gene annotation of it is very reliable and so could be used a good reference. For the genome, 22 horizontally transferred genes were extracted from the DarkHorse. As can be seen from Figure 1D, the nucleotide distribution of horizontally transferred genes tends to be similar to that in Figure 1A. Although the DarkHorse genes have basically similar nucleotide compositions with function-known genes, it does not mean the 86 ORFs in Figure 1B are all definitely non-coding. In fact, there may still be the possibility that some of the genes, particularly those with GC2 between 0.3 and 0.6, are falsely predicted as non-coding because of their very recent transfers. To investigate the possibility of clusters of horizontally transferred genes, we checked the chromosomal locations of these 86 ORFs and found that they not have any cluster pattern. Therefore, it is sure that, at least, most of the 85 eliminated ORFs do not belong to horizontally transferred genes and are indeed non-coding. Also note that 11 of the 20 horizontally transferred genes have been assigned the COG code and this ratio is much higher than that of the collective of the 85 eliminated ORFs.3.2. Missed genes found by joint methods and their functionsDuring the process of annotating sequenced genomes, some genuine genes may be missed because the annotators pursue a balance between the number of all annotated genes and that of finding genuine genes and ensure not too high falsely positive predictions.14,25,40 The method for picking up missed genes was a two-step process by combining the ab initio gene finding and the blast search. With this method, we found a varying number of missed genes with potential functions (Table 3). For example, eight new genes were added in L. hongkongensis, and details for them are listed in Table 4. RT–PCR analyses validated the transcriptions of all eight sequences (Fig. 2). Out of the 10 newly found genes in the genome of C. violaceum, transcriptions of eight ones are validated with RT–PCR and the exceptions are (Table 6) CV_A0007 and CV_A0010 (Fig. 3). All the amplification with genome DNA was positive (data not shown). Therefore, transcriptional analyses illustrated that the method was effective for picking up new genes and had very high accuracy. However, this method is only applicable to picking up genes having homologues in other genomes but not to strain-specific genes. In the other genomes, the method was directly used and without experimental validation. Numbers of revised genes, which contains newly found genes, hypothetical genes with newly assigned functions, eliminated ORFs and disrupted ORFsNumbers of revised genes, which contains newly found genes, hypothetical genes with newly assigned functions, eliminated ORFs and disrupted ORFsDetails of the eight newly found genes in the genome of L. hongkongensisDetails of the eight newly found genes in the genome of L. hongkongensisRT–PCR confirmations of eight newly found genes in L. hongkongensis. mRNAs corresponding to candidate genes were evaluated by RT–PCR (RT).

The details of the eight genes and their corresponding functions and the details of PCR primers and conditions used in the validation experiments are listed in Tables 4 and 5, respectively. For each of the remaining six overlapping genes, the region spanned by the two PCR primers does not overlap with the annotated genes and thus could reduce false-positive errors for the transcription trace. The six genes are analyzed as follows. LHK_A0001 overlaps the annotated gene LHK_00511. According to the annotation, the two sequences have the same potential function of encoding the phosphoserine phosphatase. LHK_A0001 has the similarity score of the E-value of 10-49 and Identity of 55% and the similarity score of LHK_00511 is the E-value of 10-39 and Identity of 65%. We could not decide which of them is the genuine gene based on the scores. LHK_00511 has the length of only 211 bp, which is much shorter than the length (~669 bp) of known genes with the same function in other genomes. LHK_A0001 has the length of 471 bp. Based on the length information, LHK_A0001 is more likely to encode the phosphoserine phosphatase than LHK_00511. LHK_A0002 overlaps the annotated gene LHK_00916 with only 29 bp. LHK_A0002 is predicted to code for site-specific recombinase and LHK_00916 encodes replicase. Because they have so little overlap and have different functions, it is very likely that they are both genuine genes. LHK_A0005 has the potential function of encoding the Na+-dependent transporter. LHK_A0006 overlaps 61 bp with one functional gene but they locate on two different DNA strands. LHK_A0007 and the annotated rpsI gene (LHK_02777) constitute an interesting overlap. After the blast alignment, both of them are found to be significantly similar to the rpsI gene in the other genomes. As shown in Figure 4, LHK_A0007 matches the last 141 bp (57 aa) of the other rpsI genes and LHK_02777 matches the first 219 bp (73 aa). LHK_A0007 and LHK_02777 as a whole just constitute a complete rpsI gene (130 aa). In fact, LHK_A0007 and LHK_02777 are adjacent and overlapping. For the overlapping part, LHK_A0007 has the correct reading frame but the LHK_02777 does not have the correct frame, according to the other rpsI genes. Therefore, it is suggested that there has appeared an event of nucleotide insertion/deletion for the rpsI gene in L. hongkongensis. After point mutation, the single reading frame changed to two different ORFs. In this work, the two generated segments could be transcribed and should have functions. But we do not know whether they have the same function of encoding ribosomal protein S9. Finally, LHK_A0008 has possible function of coding for thioesterase.

Either the overlapping part is shorter than 15 bp or the overlapping gene is annotated as hypothetical protein that has not significant similarity with known genes in the public database. Details of the 10 genes and their corresponding functions and the details of PCR primers and conditions used in the validation experiments are listed in Tables 6 and 7, respectively. The two negative samples with RT–PCR analysis may constitute falsely positive predictions of our method, or alternatively, they are expressed only in special conditions.

In N. gonorrhoeae FA 1090, only 1 of 18 newly added genes overlaps the annotated genes and the overlapping part is 20 bp. Among the 18 genes, the function information of four are so detailed to have definite gene names and they encode thiol:disulfide interchange protein DsbD, sulphate ABC transporter permease protein CysU, 23S rRNA (guanosine-2'-O-)-methyltransferase RlmB and septum site-determining protein MinD, respectively. In N. gonorrhoeae NCCP11945, nine new genes are found. Among them, five do not overlap annotated genes. Four of the five genes have putative important function based on very high similarity and they encode transcription antiterminator (Nusg), 30S ribosomal protein S14 (RpsN), 30S ribosomal protein L30 (RpmD) and translation initiation factor IF-1 (InfA). In N. lactamica, none of the five newly added genes overlap annotated genes. Among them, three encode DNA transport competence protein (ComeA), one encodes transposases and one encodes the TonB-dependent receptor. In Pseudogulbenkiania, only one gene is added. Interestingly, this gene has the same 5' terminal with the annotated gene (NH8B_2210) but they do not have the same stop codon. The NH8B_2210 is much longer than the newly added one and they have the same reading frame. According to the RefSeq annotation for NH8B_2210, the original authors seemed to have predicted that there is a stop codon treated as the selenocystein codon. By blast against the public database, the newly added gene is shown to be a more reliable prediction because it has the same length with counterparts in distantly related species where as the annotated does not.In the four strains of N. meningitidis, from 6 to 30 new genes were added and very few of them overlap the annotated genes. The strain alpha14 N. meningitidis has the most found new genes and interestingly 27 among the 30 new genes encode transposases. Although their aa identities with known transposases in genomes beyond the Neisseria genus tend to be just slightly higher than 50%, the identity is higher than 80% for each of them with counterparts in the same genus. Furthermore, the coverage at each case is greater than 90%. Therefore, predicted functions of encoding transposases for the 27 new genes are reliable. According to the RefSeq annotation, none of the genes code for transposases in this strain. However, 55, 29 and 33 transposases have been annotated in the other three strains of N. meningitidis. The lower sensitivity of the ab initio gene finder used in the annotation of N. meningitidis alpha14 is suggested to be responsible for the missing of transposases. In fact, some of transposases, which aid the integration insertion of genomic islands or single horizontally transferred gene, tend to own abnormal nucleotide composition and are easily missed by composition-based programmes.41 In addition, some genes with important functions have been added in the N. meningitidis genomes, such as the haemoglobin receptor in 053442, transcription elongation factor (greA) in alpha14, protein methyltransferase (hemK) in Z2491, leucyl aminopeptidase (pepA) and allophanate hydrolase subunit 2 in MC58. Details of the 106 newly found genes in the 10 Neisseriaceae strains are listed in Supplementary Table S2.3.3. Hypothetical proteins with newly assigned functionsFor the genomes sequenced several years ago, functional information may be outdated.16,29 Especially, some hypothetical genes may have functional counterparts in current databases,16 whereas they are still annotated as hypothetical. This section is aiming to provide functional information for hypothetical genes in the 10 Neisseriaceae strains by using the similarity search method. To ensure reliable function transfer, severe homologous conditions were adopted. After the blast search, varying numbers of hypothetical proteins were assigned functions in the 10 Neisseriaceae genomes (Table 3). Among them, L. hongkongensis and Pseudogulbenkiania have the least numbers perhaps because their genomes were most recently sequenced. In the two strains of the N. gonorrhoeae, the strain FA 1090 has the larger number of assigned functions and it just was sequenced earlier than NCCP11945.23,42 Among the four strains of the species, N. meningitidis MC58 has the largest number and it just was sequenced earliest among them.23 Therefore, the number of hypothetical proteins with newly assigned functions may be tightly associated with sequenced time of the genome. In fact, if one genome has been sequenced at earlier year, it should have more functional counterparts in the current public database but not existed at that time.29 The original annotation would be more outdated for earlier sequenced genome in the sense of function information.Among newly assigned functions, some have been provided definite names (Table 8) and this transferred annotation information should be unquestionable. For example, the hypothetical gene LHK_02863 in L. hongkongensis has been assigned not only the function encoding iron-sulphur cluster assembly protein but also the definite name ‘IscA’. Some other genes were assigned with detailed functions and would be reliable with this function because stringent homologous criteria were adopted. However, there are still some hypothetical proteins with only general functions, such as membrane proteins, lipoproteins and periplasmic proteins (Table 8). This type of rough function information would give help for the determination of more detailed functions. Interestingly, the number of assigned membrane proteins tends to be larger than periplasmic proteins and much larger than lipoproteins in most cases (Table 8). It is suggested that this information corresponds to their natural ranks existing in the genome. Details of assigned functions for each of the 10 Neisseriaceae strains are listed in Supplementary Table S3. Among hypothetical gene with assigned functions, the numbers of genes with definite names, those encoding membrane proteins, lipoproteins and periplasmic proteinsAmong hypothetical gene with assigned functions, the numbers of genes with definite names, those encoding membrane proteins, lipoproteins and periplasmic proteins3.4. Disrupted ORFsDuring the process of genome re-annotation for the 10 Neisseriaceae strains, we found an interesting phenomenon. In a specific genome, two adjacent ORFs, which are predicted as genes by the ZCURVE program, have the same function with known genes in the other species. The total length of the two ORFs just corresponds to that of the known counterparts or just a little different from them. Based on similarity scores, both of the two ORFs should be predicted as genes with the corresponding function. However, either of them is much shorter than the functional counterpart and could not constitute a homologue in the sense of length information. Perrodou et al.43 stated that unrecognized frameshifts, in-frame stop codons and sequencing errors often led to interrupted coding sequences. Very recently, Sharma et al.44 performed a pilot study on bacterial genes with disrupted ORFs. Their results indicated that many disrupted genes likely utilized the non-standard decoding mechanisms: programmed ribosomal frameshifting and programmed transcriptional realignment. Given that our recognized adjacent ORFs have identical functions, they should originate from the disruption of a longer gene by a frameshift or an in-frame stop codon and rarely by the sequencing error. Numbers of disrupted ORFs are listed in Table 3 and details of them are illustrated in Supplementary Table S4. Totally, 111 disrupted ORFs (or partial genes) were identified in six strains of the genus Neisseria and two in L. hongkongensis. According to Sharma et al.,44 some of the disrupted ORFs still encode proteins. Consistent with this, both of the disrupted ORFs LHK_A0007 (newly predicted) and LHK_02777 (originally annotated) are found to be transcribed in L. hongkongensis cells by the PCR experiment. Further wet experiment on functions of the other disrupted ORFs would be interesting.4. DiscussionsThe genome annotation would be outdated with the functional information when several years passed since the sequencing. Latest database may contain new functional genes which were not yet assigned functional information when the analyzed genome was sequenced.29 Those newly added functional information would provide the source of function transfer for some hypothetical genes in the analyzed genome. Sometimes, a few genes missed by the original annotation may be found with the similarity alignment.25 In this work, a total of 2069 hypothetical genes were assigned with general or detailed functions based on homology search against latest database. Among the 10 Neisseriaceae strains, N. gonorrhoeae FA 1090 and N. meningitidis MC58 and Z2491 were sequenced and annotated earlier.23 Correspondingly, the numbers of newly assigned functions in them are the largest. Therefore, the time from the sequencing is longer and the function annotation is more likely to be outdated. As for newly found genes, all 10 strains except N. meningitidis alpha14 contain a small number. In fact, it is rather difficult to find genes missed by the original annotation using the similarity-based method. When annotating the genome originally, predicted genes, particularly those having similar counterparts, would be retained as far as possible. Therefore, newly identified genes usually are only those having counterparts newly added in the database. As an exception, as many as 30 genes were newly found in the strain of N. meningitidis alpha14 and 27 of them correspond to transposases. We speculate that the less sensitivity of the ab initio programme, which has been used in the original annotation, for the external genes leads to the missing of the 27 genes associated with insertion function.Besides the published date, the quality of the original annotation is another determining factor of the extent of errors.33 As an example, N. gonorrhoeae NCCP11945 has the highest gene density according to the RefSeq annotations among the seven Neisseria strains. Correspondingly, the largest number of hypothetical genes has been excluded from this strain. When annotating this genome, only one ab initio gene finder was used.42 Usually, two or more ab initio programmes are used in annotating the other bacterial genomes. Based on the very abnormal gene density of the strain, we suppose that there may still be non-coding ORFs, besides the 56 ones excluded by us. Besides the annotation method and sequencing time, some other factors also cause the different extent of errors. For example, genes in high G + C bacterial genomes are shown to be difficultly predicted with high accuracy and this is caused by the fact that many long ORFs appear in this type of genomes.32 In addition, the genome could be difficultly predicted accurately if there are only distantly related species in the public databases.33We should note that there still probably are non-coding ORFs and missed genes after the present updated annotation in the 10 Neisseriaceae strains. To assure reliable results, we picked up only those sequences with very higher similarities when identifying missed genes and we used the method with lower specificity when excluding non-coding ORFs. In addition, some thoroughly new genes, which have not significant similarities with any known genes, may be found by combing ab initio programme and wet experimental validation. However, the 106 newly found genes are those having similar counterparts based on latest databases. Also note that different detailed methods may be used to check the annotations of the other bacterial genomes, although the present systematic method has shown to be effective and reliable. For example, the recently developed ab initio gene finder Prodigal,32 which has lower false positives could replace or jointly used with ZCURVE 1.0. Here, we used only the latter because the use of both of them generates basically consistent results (data not shown). The RPGM program,39 which is also based on the graphical representation of the DNA sequence, could be chosen as an alternative to eliminate non-coding ORFs.Supplementary dataSupplementary Data are available atwww.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by the Hong Kong Scholars Program (XJ2011005), National Natural Science Foundation of China (31071109) and the programme for New Century Excellent Talents in University (NCET-11-0059).The authors are grateful to the editor and the anonymous reviewers for their valuable suggestions and comments, which has led to the improvement of this article.

IntroductionThe horse (Equus caballus) is a subspecies of the family Equidae and has evolved over the last 45–55 million yrs, from a small multi-toed mammal into the large single-toed animal it is today.1 Wild horses were domesticated in Central Eurasia ~5500–6000 yrs ago2 and were primarily bred for their endurance, strength, and speed. This makes the horse not only a useful biological model to study the physiology of exercise, but also to identify the molecular mechanisms of adaptive responses to exercises. The horse is also used as a model for some human disorders, such as infertility, inflammatory disease, and various muscular disorders.3 There are currently >300 breeds of horse, and humans use them in a wide range of activities.4 Among these, the Thoroughbred is a well-known breed of the racing horse. The structure of their skeletal muscle possesses remarkable plasticity, which is able to respond to environmental changes as well as to the physical and metabolic challenges following training and exercise.5 To date, the genetic components of any evolutionary adaptations in skeletal muscle have not yet been identified. Recently, transcriptome analyses of skeletal muscle and blood have been carried out to identify the genes expressed during exercise in horses.6–8 In our study, we show the evolutionary process underlying the response to exercise-induced stress in the skeletal muscle of racehorses by means of gene expression network analysis performed after exercise (AE), and by integrating the genome-wide signatures of selection of three different evolutionary phases.2. Materials and methods2.1. RNA-seq data between before and after exercisesWe generated RNA-sequence (RNA-seq) data in six horses before exercise (BE) and AE and described elsewhere.9 Briefly, samples of skeletal muscle and blood were taken from six Thoroughbred horses BE and AE. ‘BE’ samples were collected from the triceps brachii of the right leg and from the jugular vein and carotid artery of each horse. After a resting period of several hours, ‘AE’ samples were collected immediately after a 30-min trot from the same tissues of each individual. Thoroughbred horses usually canter for 17–18 min per day. For the purposes of this study, a 30-min trot was taken to be the equivalent to 17–18 min of cantering. Total RNAs from skeletal muscle and blood samples were isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and the RNeasy RNA purification kit with DNase treatment (Qiagen). mRNA was isolated from the total RNA using oligo-dT beads and reverse transcribed into double-stranded cDNA fragments. Construction and sequencing of an RNA-seq library for each sample was carried out based on Illumina HiSeq2000 protocols in order to generate 90 pair-end reads. Twenty-four sets of transcriptome data were generated for muscle and blood from six horses both BE and AE. TopHat (version 1.4.1) was used to map the sequences to a horse reference genome and annotated using the EquCab2 database (http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/downloads.html#horse).2.2. Identification of differentially expressed genesWe used the R package edgeR,10 which is based on a negative binomial model, to examine differential expression of replicated count data. This is because RNA-seq data may exhibit more variability than expected in a Poisson distribution, because it is more widely dispersed in the genome. When a negative binomial model is used, the dispersion has to be estimated before a differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis is carried out. EdgeR provides an estimation of this dispersion using a Cox-Reid profile-adjusted likelihood method. After negative binomial models are fitted and dispersion estimates are obtained, it is possible to proceed with the tests for determining differential expression using a generalized linear model (GLM) likelihood ratio test. GLMs specify probability distributions according to the mean–variance relationship; for example, the quadratic mean–variance relationship for a read count. The GLM likelihood ratio test is based on the idea of fitting negative binomial GLMs with Cox-Reid dispersion estimates. This automatically takes all known sources of variation into account. Significant DEGs were detected with a cut-off value of false discovery rate (FDR) <0.01, based on a paired design between ‘BE’ and ‘AE’. The equine Ensembl gene IDs were converted to official gene symbols by cross-matching with human Ensembl gene IDs and the official gene symbols. The official gene symbols of human homologues of equine genes were used for functional clustering and enrichment analyses using the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID).11 The representation of functional groups in blood and skeletal muscle relative to the whole genome was investigated using the Expression Analysis Systematic Explorer (EASE) tool12 within the DAVID, of which the EASE is a modified Fisher's exact test used to measure enrichment of gene ontology (GO) terms.132.3. Analysis of co-expression gene networkMapped reads were assembled using Cufflinks (version 1.3.0)14 to estimate the abundance of genes. Fragments per kilobase of exon per million fragments (FPKM) of each sample were calculated to estimate the expression levels of the genes. The FPKM value set for all genes in the muscle and blood tissue samples was normalized using Quantile normalization.15 Connectivity was calculated using the Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) R-package16 for both up-regulated and down-regulated genes (DRGs) having six points of FPKM for both ‘BE’ and ‘AE’. This connectivity, referred to as the degree of connectivity, is the sum of the connection strengths with other genes or networks. Following calculation of the degree of connectivity, a gene co-expression network was generated and the genes clustered onto a topological overlap matrix (TOM), based on their dissimilarity. Genes with a high connectivity to each other clustered at the same module. Modules were formed based on one of the exercise conditions, and the extent to which the module was preserved was calculated for a different condition in order to identify any reciprocal disruption of gene expression. An Eigengene-based connectivity was calculated for up-regulated genes (URGs) of the modules, AE, in both muscle and blood. The cut-off value, module membership values >0.95, and gene significance (GS) values >20 were applied to identify the genes with a high GS and high intra-modular connectivity in each module.2.4. Analysis of horse DNA re-sequencing dataWhole-blood samples were collected from 14 Thoroughbred racing stallions from the Korean Racing Authority and from four male and two female Jeju domestic ponies (Equus caballus) from the Jeju Provincial Livestock Institute, Korea. Blood (10 ml) was drawn from the carotid artery and was treated with heparin to prevent clotting. A genomic DNA quality check was carried out using fluorescence-based quantification on an agarose gel, a standard electrophoresis on a 0.6% agarose gel, and via a pulsed-field gel, using 200 ng of DNA. Manufacturers' instructions were followed to create a paired library of 500-bp fragments. This consisted of the following: purified genomic DNA fragments of <800 bp, fragments with blunt ends, fragments with 5' phosphorylated ends, fragments with a 3'-dA overhang, some with adaptor-modified ends, purified ligation product, and a genomic DNA library. Following this, we generated a sequence data using HiSeq 2000 (Illumina, Inc.). Using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner17 with the default setting, pair-end sequence reads were mapped to the reference horse genome (equCab2). We used the following open-source software packages; Picard Tools, SAMtools,18 and the Genome analysis toolkit,19 for downstream processing and variant calling. Substitution calls were made with GATK UnifiedGenotyper.20 All calls with a Phred-scaled quality of <20 were filtered out. For each chromosome, we inferred the phased haplotype and imputed the missing alleles for the entire set of Thoroughbred populations simultaneously using BEAGLE.21 After phasing, observed heterozygosity and minor allele frequency (MAF) were calculated from autosome set using PLINK (version 1.07).22 Average observed heterozygosities were 0.285 in Thoroughbred horses and 0.345 in Jeju ponies. Average MAFs were 0.207 in Thoroughbred horses and 0.220 in Jeju ponies.We additionally genotyped 11 Thoroughbred horses using EquineSNP50 Genotyping BeadChip (Illumina, Inc.). Common loci in both SNP chip and DNA re-sequencing data were extracted and compared using VCFtools.20 We identified 98.278–99.572% of genotype concordance (Supplementary Table S2).2.5. Estimation of iHS and FST valueThe iHS23 was calculated using the rehh R package24 and all SNPs from the horse genomes with the same ancestral state as that from the Jeju domestic ponies. Values were accepted when core SNPs were located in genes. We selected a significant iHS at P-value  where F(x) represents the Gaussian cumulative distribution function of iHS, which is >2,25 and iHS <0. Conventional FST26 values were calculated for genes using Arlequin 3.527 based on pairwise differences between the haplotypes of Thoroughbred racing horses and those of Jeju domestic ponies. The gene region was derived from the phased haplotype of the horse genomes, using genomic information (Ensembl Genes67 and equCab2). The cut-off point for FST is 95% quantile of the empirical distribution of FST.2.6. Estimation of the dN/dS valueWe downloaded the protein and reference mRNA sequences for humans, mouse, dog, pig, cow, and horse from ENSEMBL.28 The 1 : 1 orthologs of all six species were made using Mestortho.29 Following this, 9000 1 : 1 orthologs were found and used to estimate the synonymous and non-synonymous substitution rates in mammals. Phylogenetic trees were obtained using Timetree.30 Orthologous gene sets were aligned using PRANK31 with the default settings, and poorly aligned sites were eliminated using Gblocks.32 The maximum likelihood method (codeml of PAML 4)33 was used to estimate the dN (the rate of non-synonymous substitutions), dS (the rate of synonymous substitutions), and <U+03C9> (the ratio of non-synonymous substitutions to the rate of synonymous substitutions), with F3 × 4 codon frequencies under the branch model (model = 2, NSsites = 0) and the basic mode l (model = 0, NSsites = 0). Orthologs with dS > 3 or <U+03C9> > 5 were filtered.34 After this process, 8417 orthologs remained. A log-likelihood ratio test was performed to compare these models, and we applied an FDR correction.352.7. Gene network analysis of positively selected genes of the three evolutionary layersTo ascertain the FPKM values of the URGs in skeletal muscle tissue, signed correlation values [adjacency values: (0.5 × (1 + correlation))soft-thresholding power] were calculated using WGCNA, and a weighted network adjacency matrix was drawn up. We applied a cut-off value of >0.6 to the adjacency, which signifies 0.86 of R2 and 0.92 of the correlation to a linear line fitting with in a power-law distribution. This resulted in a scale free topology of the network. Those genes directly connected to the module core genes and that were associated with the dN/dS, FST, and iHS statistics, which were selected to form the single-depth connection network for the core genes. The correlation network plot was generated using the network visualization tool, Cytoscape (version 2.83).36 A KEGG pathway enrichment test was performed using EASE, with a cut-off value of <0.1 for the selected and core genes associated with dN/dS, FST, and iHS.3. Results3.1. DEGs between BE and AEWe generated 24 RNA-seq datasets from muscle and blood tissue from six horses BE and AE. We identified 1822 URGs in muscle tissue, 222 URGs in blood tissue, 930 DRGs in muscle tissue, and 200 DRGs in blood tissue AE (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. S1). Muscle tissue contains a higher proportion of DEGs than blood (10.2 compared with 1.6%). Since the DEGs in the muscle are considerably biased towards URGs, we performed further analysis of the URGs and used an arbitrary cut-off of a >64-fold, which is log2(FC)>6. Enriched pathways of the genes showed a nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor (NLR) signalling pathway, a JAK-STAT signalling pathway, a MAPK signalling pathway, and a Toll-like receptor (TLR) signalling pathway (Fig. 1). Notably, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 were the top URGs and were widely involved in the pathways. Skeletal muscle produces and releases cytokines called myokines37 as part of the extracellular signalling pathway in response to factors, such as exercise. The exercise-induced myokines include IL-6 and IL-8,38 and many studies have demonstrated that IL-6 production is associated with muscle contraction.39 Many of the URGs and DRGs in each tissue are covered by the enriched terms present in the Gene Ontology, Biological Processes (GO-BP; Supplementary Figs S2–S6). Representative terms include an intracellular signalling cascade, the response to organic substances, the immune response, regulation of cell proliferation, and apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S2). Exercise-induced muscle damage is a well-known phenomenon40,41 that elicits an inflammatory response.42 We found that many of the enriched GO-BP terms in URGs are related to the inflammatory response. A further analysis of enriched KEGG pathways (Fig. 2) revealed that many are activated in muscle and blood tissues as a result of exercise-induced stress. Among them, TLR and NLR signalling pathways are commonly found in the URGs of both of these tissues. TLRs and NLRs are two major types of innate immune sensors that provide an immediate response to pathogens or tissue damage.43 The JAK-STAT signalling pathway is also up-regulated in URGs in muscle tissue. The JAK-STAT signalling cascade is a crucial factor in myogenesis17,44,45 and has a role in the inflammatory response.46 We also found a significant up-regulation of focal adhesion, apoptosis, the p53 signalling pathway, and an increased regulation of the actin cytoskeleton (Fig. 2). The p53 protein has a known role in apoptosis of skeletal muscle,47 and the actin cytoskeleton is also involved in the regulation of apoptotic signalling.48Plot of the log value for fold change against the log value of the abundance of each gene, using Cox-Reid common dispersion, in skeletal muscle.

The number of genes associated with the KEGG pathway is given in brackets on the right.3.2. Co-expression network analysis of the DEGsWe conducted a co-expression network analysis using the WGCNA R software package.16 We found a higher number of modules in muscle tissue ‘AE’ compared with ‘BE’, indicating that the exercise-induced stress has a dramatic effect on gene expression in muscle (Fig. 3). We identified 321 core genes AE in muscle tissues (Fig. 3b), but only one in the blood (Supplementary Fig. S7). Pathways that are significantly enriched in these 321 genes include: the MAPK signalling pathway, the NLR signalling pathway, the TLR signalling pathway, the JAK-STAT signalling pathway, the p53 signalling pathway, cell adhesion molecules, and apoptosis (Fig. 3c). Thorough analysis of the DEGs and core genes of the co-expression network analysis consistently indicate the following: (i) after a single bout of exercise, gene expression in muscle tissue is more disrupted than in blood, and (ii) pathways involved in exercise-induced stress are related to those involved in inflammation and apoptosis in skeletal muscle.

Positive selection in horse lineage: dN/dS analysisIn this study, we aimed to detect the selection signatures of the three evolutionary phases of E. caballus, using dN/dS, FST, and iHS (Fig. 4). The first phase, calculated by dN/dS, shows the positive selection that occurred during ~82.5 million yrs of evolution of the horse species. The second phase, calculated by FST, indicates the relatively later selection events that occurred during the domestication of the horse, ~6000 yrs ago. The final phase, calculated by means of iHS, shows the most recent selective sweep. To analyse the dN/dS phase, we identified 9000 genes from six mammals (human, mouse, dog, horse, cow, and pig), which were orthologous with a 1 : 1 ratio. Using a maximum likelihood method (PAML 4),33 the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions (dN/dS) was estimated using a branch model. Of the orthologous genes, 495 were significantly enhanced in the horse lineage (Supplementary Fig. S8). This gene enhancement indicates that the horse lineage is well adapted for basic functions relating to their athletic performance, such as ion transport, cell motility, and cellular response to stress (Fig. 4). Muscle structure and respiratory systems have also evolved in horses over time (Fig. 4). We also found a very strong correlation between dN/dS and expression levels, both in blood and in muscle tissues (Fig. 5). It is known that highly expressed genes evolve more slowly.49 Since expression levels from BE and AE are more disrupted in skeletal muscle, a consistently stronger correlation in muscle tissue indicates that it may be more sensitive to the deleterious side effects caused by highly expressed genes.

Positive selection during the domestication period: FST and iHS analysesTo detect a selection signal during the domestication of the horse, we performed a comparative genome-wide FST26 and iHS50 statistical analysis based on the protein-coding genes of 14 Thoroughbreds and 6 Jeju ponies using 10-fold re-sequencing data. The Jeju pony was used as a comparative group because this breed displays pronounced phenotypic differences with the Thoroughbreds, especially with regard to body shape and racing performance (Supplementary Table S1). FST statistics are generally more sensitive to older selection events of an intermediate to high frequency, while the iHS test is used to detect evidence of a recent, stronger, positive selection.50 Using an empirical p–value of <0.05 of FST, we identified 1199 significantly differentiated protein-coding genes (Supplementary Fig. S9). Using p-values of iHS <0.01, and iHS <0, we identified 2182 SNPs and 756 genes, which have undergone recent selective sweep events (Supplementary Fig. S10). The FST phase shows enhanced gene differentiation mainly in the inflammatory response, while the most recent selection events indicated by the iHS value involve the genes of the neurological system process, cell adhesion, and proteolysis. Although dN/dS values strongly correlate with expression values in both types of tissue, we found no correlation between expression levels and FST or iHS values (Supplementary Fig. S11). This indicates that gene expression levels of this biological system have been modulated by long-term evolutionary forces. We also found no correlation between any pairs of dN/dS, FST, and iHS (Supplementary Fig. S12). These results are as expected, because the three statistical methods indicate different phases of evolution separated by time.3.5. Integration of gene expression network and selection signature in the three layersWe integrated both the gene expression and the evolutionary phases. We describe a positively selected core gene (PSCG) as a gene identified in gene expression networks and which has a signature indicative of positive selection. Among the 321 core genes of the URGs in skeletal muscle tissue, we found 10 expressed in the dN/dS phase, 14 in the FST phase, and 8 PSCGs in the iHS phase (Fig. 4). We suggest that these genes are the major components of the evolutionary adaptation found in the skeletal muscle of the racing horse to exercise-induced stress. Furthermore, using a cut-off value of >0.6 to a weighted network adjacency, we identified genes directly connected by the PSCGs (Fig. 6). All except for two PSCGs connected into a large single network consisting of 626 genes. Genes involved in the inflammatory and apoptosis-related pathways are over-represented in the network (Fig. 6). Gene networks for each evolutionary phase (Supplementary Figs S13–S15) also show significant over-representations of the inflammatory and apoptosis-related pathways. To conclude, we suggest that the skeletal muscle of the racing horse has evolved not only for muscle strength, but also more importantly for the production of an efficient exercise-induced stress response. We believe that our integrative analysis can be used to reveal multiple evolutionary phases in response to certain biological conditions. This approach enables us to study the molecular adaptive evolution of many unique biological populations. Single-depth correlation network of the core genes associated with dN/dS, FST, and iHS.

DiscussionSkeletal muscle produces and releases cytokines called myokines,37 and the tissue cell secretes myokines as part of the extracellular signalling pathway in response to factors such as exercise, and the secreted factors can participate in nutrient generation, mediating angiogenesis, and regulating myogenesis37,51 in which exercise-induced myokines include IL-6, IL-8, IL-15, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 21, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).38 Concordantly, we found many up-regulated myokines and their receptors AE in the muscle, including IL-6, IL-8, IL-15 receptor, FGF7, FGF receptor 1, FGF receptor 3, and BDNF. Numerous studies have demonstrated that IL-6 production is associated with muscle contraction.39 Concordantly, IL-6 is the most extremely up-regulated in muscle tissue, but it is not significantly up-regulated in the blood. IL-6 is inactive in resting muscles, but is rapidly activated by muscle contraction, and its release from muscle during exercise may be related to free radical metabolism, especially with reactive oxygen species generation.52 IL-8 is a paracrine mediator secreted from contracting skeletal muscle. IL-8 is a chemokine that acts as an attractor for neutrophils and as an angiogenic factor.38Since physical exercise provides a challenge to homeostasis throughout the body, the immune system displays substantial perturbations in response to a single bout of exercise. Inflammation represents a series of events, which is usually initiated by tissue trauma and is terminated with tissue repair. Exercise-induced muscle damage is a well-known phenomenon40,41 that elicits an inflammatory response.42 Exercise-induced muscle trauma induces an acute inflammatory response characterized by an initial removal of necrotic tissue or cellular debris and a subsequent repair of injured muscle, nerve fibres, blood vessels, as well as extracellular matrix. We found that the enriched GO terms in URGs in both the tissues are directly related to such system-wide response to exercise (Fig. 2), especially one related to inflammatory response.We found that there are a wide scope of pathways that are elicited by exercise-stress in muscle and blood tissues, which includes pathways belong to cellular processes, environmental information processing, and organismal systems. Among the pathways associated with immune system, TLR, and NLR signalling pathways are commonly found in the URGs of each tissue. TLRs and NLRs are two major forms of innate immune sensors, which provide immediate responses against pathogenic invasion or tissue injury. Activation of these sensors induces the recruitment of innate immune cells, such as macrophages and neutrophils, initiates tissue repair processes, and results in adaptive immune activation.43 The JAK-STAT signalling pathway is enriched in up-regulated in muscle. The JAK/STAT signalling cascade has been identified as a crucial factor for myogenesis17,44,45 and could also have a role in inflammation.46 Efficient utilization of myogenesis allows for the formation of mature muscle fibres for muscle repair/regeneration.53 Additional inflammatory related pathways are also enriched in muscle URGs: haematopoietic cell lineage, phagocytosis, B-cell receptor signalling pathway, and chemokine receptor signalling pathway. We also found a significant enrichment for genes in cellular processes: focal adhesion, apoptosis, p53 signalling pathway, and regulation of actin cytoskeleton. Genes in the focal adhesion are important for muscle integrity because of its role in the protection against mechanically induced damage.54 Concordantly, a genome scan for positive selection in Thoroughbred horses revealed that positively selected genomic regions contain significant over-representation of focal adhesion pathway.55 The p53 protein is known for its role in apoptosis in skeletal muscle,47 and actin cytoskeleton are also involved in the regulation of apoptotic signalling.48 Furthermore, using mice experiment, it was recently shown that exercise-conditioned serum is capable of inducing apoptosis.56 Although we did not find apoptosis-related KEGG pathway enrichment of the URGs in blood, apoptosis-related genes seem to be highly enriched in those of blood tissues on the basis of the GO enrichment analysis result.We conducted gene co-expression network analysis using WGCNA R package.16 The network analysis package has been extensively used for microarray expression data and recently evaluated for RNA-seq data network inference showing greater sensitivity and dynamic range than that of microarray data.57 For URGs AE for each of the tissue, gene co-expression network was constructed and clustered as modules. The modules are based on one condition BE or AE and their module preservation scores in another condition are calculated. We found higher number of modules in AE (18 modules) compared with BE (9 modules) in muscle tissue. It indicates that the exercise-stress cause dramatic perturbation of gene expression in muscle in response to the stress in the tissue. We found only one gene was identified as a core gene in AE condition of blood samples (Supplementary Fig. S7), whereas 321 genes in that of muscle samples (Fig. 3b).On the basis of evolutionary tree of the six species, the accelerated genes have been evolved during 82.5 million yrs, therefore, representing the most ancient time of gene evolution among our evolutionary statistics. We found a very strong correlation between dN/dS and expression level in both the blood and muscle samples (Fig. 5). Interestingly, muscle samples contain stronger correlations between them than those of blood samples. It has been known that highly expressed genes evolve slowly.49 Therefore, the best predictor of a protein's evolutionary rate is its expression level from bacteria to mammals.58–61 Interestingly, muscle samples also contain stronger correlations between dN/dS and expression level compared with those of blood samples. It was suggested that selection against the toxicity of misfolded proteins generated by ribosome errors suffices to create a negative correlation between the evolution rate and expression level.61 Thus, highly expressed genes tend to be under purifying selection. Our results indicate that muscle tissue might be more susceptible to the toxicity of misfolded proteins than blood tissue. Considering that the expression levels of BE and AE are more perturbed in the skeletal muscle (Fig. 3a and b; Supplementary Fig. S7), consistently stronger correlation in the muscle tissue indicate that the skeletal muscles have been evolved to adapt the evolutionary susceptibility. Previously tissues composed of neurones were shown to have strongest trends in fly, mouse, and human.61 However, to our limited knowledge, there has been no report of strong correlation in a skeletal muscle tissue.Our limited sample size may have resulted in a minor fraction of false positive error and, thus, a very large sample size is required, which is unable to be delivered in this study. However, we believe that our analyses, not confounded by tenuous population demographic history, may be considered as preliminary foundation for further replication studies in harbouring genes that underlie phenotypic variation in the racing horse.Generally, dN/dS ratio detects, at least, more than a million years of evolutionary time62 and, therefore, tends to fail to detect recent or within-species evolutionary process. In order to detect recent and within-species evolutionary forces related to exercise responsive genes in the horse, we further analysed FST and iHS statistics of genome-wide protein-coding genes. The FST statistics are generally more sensitive to older selection events that have reached a intermediate to high frequency, while the iHS test is most powerful for detecting evidence of a recent, strong, positive selection.50 However, there is no clear cut between the FST and iHS evolutionary layers. Therefore, it was our intention to demonstrate older domestication process using FST and relatively recent process using iHS, there must be a significantly overlapping period between the two layers.Supplementary dataSupplementary Data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by a grant from the Next-Generation BioGreen 21 Program (PJ008106 and PJ008191), Rural Development Administration, Republic of Korea, and this work was also supported by Korea Racing Authority (KRA) for the project of thoroughbred horse (No. 0569-20110008).The RNA-sequencing data from this study have been submitted to the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) under accession number GSE37870.

Subsequently, molecular dissection of nine OsRFPs was performed by the examination of their E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, subcellular localization, and physical interaction with target proteins. Most of the OsRFPs examined possessed E3 ligase activity and showed diverse subcellular localization. Yeast two-hybrid analysis was then employed to construct a physical interaction map of seven OsRFPs with their 120 interacting proteins. The results indicated that these OsRFPs required dynamic translocation and partitioning for their cellular activation. Heterogeneous overexpression of each of the OsRFP genes in Arabidopsis suggested that they have functionally diverse responses to abiotic stresses, which may have been acquired during evolution. This comprehensive study provides insights into the biological functions of OsRFPs, which may be useful in understanding how rice plants adapt to unfavourable environmental conditions.1. IntroductionUnfavourable environmental conditions, such as salinity, drought, cold, heat, and nutrient limitation, cause extensive losses to agricultural productivity worldwide. In fact, environmental conditions are responsible for reducing average yields for most major crop plants by >50%.1 Drought and soil salinity, which are caused by osmotic stresses, are two of the major stresses that adversely affect plant growth and productivity. Both of these stresses lead to cellular dehydration and reactive oxygen species production, causing a reduction in cytosolic and vacuolar volumes, which then negatively affects cellular structures and metabolism. Therefore, molecular dissection of the complex plant response to abiotic stresses, such as drought and salinity, has attracted much interest since understanding these responses may enable researchers to develop transgenic plants that have improved survival rates following exposure to stressful environmental conditions.The covalent attachment of ubiquitin(s) to target proteins is a central mechanism in the regulation of protein degradation via the Ub-26S proteasome pathway in eukaryotes. In particular, accumulating genetic analyses support the notion that the Ub-26S proteasome pathway regulates various key aspects of growth, development, and defence mechanisms in plants.2–4 In this pathway, Ub, a highly evolutionary conserved 76-residue polypeptide, is attached to protein substrates in a multi-step reaction involving three enzymes, such as Ub-activating enzyme (E1), Ub-conjugating enzyme (E2), and Ub ligase enzyme (E3).5 In an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent process, E1 activates the Ub molecule by forming a thioester bond between the carboxy-terminal end of the Ub molecule and the catalytic cysteine (Cys) of E1. Thioester-linked Ub is then transferred to a Cys residue of an E2 enzyme. The enzyme transfers the activated Ub from an E2-Ub thioester intermediate to a lysine residue of the substrate protein, either directly or in cooperation with a specific E3 enzyme. Most eukaryotes, including plants, have only a small number of E1 enzymes and multiple E2 and E3 enzymes. It is believed that the Arabidopsis genome encodes only two E1s, 45 E2s and E2-like proteins, and more than 1200 E3 ligases.4 E3 ligases are the most numerous because they confer specificity to ubiquitination by recognizing substrate proteins and by mediating the transfer of Ub from an E2 protein to a substrate.6 Therefore, the E3 ligase is considered the major component that recognizes target substrates in the pathway. E3 ligases can be grouped into two main classes based on the presence of their functional domains; one class has a single subunit and includes ligases, such as the homologous to E6-AP C-terminus (HECT), and a RING/U-box domain. The other class forms a multi-subunit complex and includes the S-phase kinase-associated protein 1 (SKP1)-cullin1 (CUL1)-F-box (SCF) complex and the anaphase-promoting complex (APC).7,8Cys-rich really interesting new gene (RING) proteins are characterized either by the presence of a zinc-binding motif, or by the RING finger domain. The RING domain (Cys-X2-Cys-X9-39-Cys-X3-His-X2-3-Cys/His-X2-Cys-X4-48-Cys-X2-Cys, where X can be any amino acid) is similar to the DNA-binding zinc finger domain in that Cys or His residues coordinate two zinc ions. The RING domain is believed to play a role in protein–protein interactions (PPIs).9 The well-characterized plant genomes of Arabidopsis and rice are known to harbour 426 and 425 predicted RING-type E3 ligases in high proportions, respectively.10,11 The canonical RING domains can be sub-categorized into RING-H2 and RING-HC subtypes based on the fifth coordination Cys or His residues, respectively. A number of RING E3 ligases have been reported to play important roles in response to environmental stresses, such as drought and salt conditions. For example, salt- and drought-induced ring finger 1 (SDIR1) and small RING-H2 protein RHA2a E3 ligases have been reported to enhance salt and drought stress-responsive abscisic acid (ABA) signalling.12,13 The dehydration-responsive element-binding protein 2A (DREB2A)-interacting protein 1 and 2 (DRIP1 and DRIP2) E3 ligases negatively regulate the DREB2A transcription factor, leading to the down-regulation of drought–stress response genes.14 Hot pepper RING membrane-anchor 1 homologue 1 (Rma1H1) E3 ligase positively regulates the plasma membrane aquaporin PIP2;1 under water-deficient conditions.15 In addition, AtAIRP2 (RING-HC type) has been well characterized as a positive regulator ABA-dependent drought responses.16 In contrast, Oryza sativa drought-induced seven in absentia (SINA) protein 1 (OsDIS1) E3 ligase plays a negative role in drought–stress tolerance through transcriptional regulation of stress-related genes by post-translational regulation of OsNek6 in rice.17 However, the functional relationship between rice RING E3 ligases and abiotic stresses is largely unknown.Previously, we identified 425 genes harbouring RING domains and classified them into four groups: RING-H2, RING-HC, RING-v, and RING-C2. We then evaluated the expressional diversity and evolutionary dynamics of 369 RING finger protein (RFP) genes by using a rice public genome array dataset.11 In this study, the expression patterns of 47 O. sativa RFP (OsRFP) genes in response to abiotic stresses were analysed via semi-quantitative RT-PCR and in silico analysis. Subsequently, molecular dissection of nine OsRFPs was performed by examining their E3 Ub ligase activity, subcellular localization, and physical interaction with other proteins (interactors). We further constructed a physical interaction network with 120 interactors. In addition, heterogeneous overexpression of OsRFPs in Arabidopsis was performed in order to reveal their molecular function in response to drought and salinity stresses.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materials for RT-PCRRice seedlings (O. sativa L. cv. Donganbyeo) were grown on mesh supported in plastic containers with Murashige and Skoog (MS) solution in a growth chamber (16/8-h light/dark photoperiod at 25°C with 70% relative humidity) for 14 days. For abiotic stress treatments, seedlings were treated with salinity (200 mM NaCl), dehydration, cold (4°C), and heat (45°C). Leaf tissues were harvested 0, 1, 6, 12, and 24 h after stress treatment, and control leaf tissues were also sampled at the same time. The samples were frozen using liquid nitrogen and immediately stored at -80°C. Total RNAs were extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed as described previously.11 First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using 1 µg total RNA and a cDNA synthesis kit (Takara-Bio, Shiga, Japan). A total of 47 gene-specific primer pairs for OsRFPs were designed using Primer-BLAST (NCBI, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/). Os18S-rRNA18 was used as an internal control. A list of all primer pairs are provided in Supplementary Table S1.2.2. Subcellular localizationFor subcellular localization, the coding sequence of the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and multiple cloning sites were PCR-amplified using primers 5'-GAGATCTAGAGGATCCCCCGGGATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAG-3' (forward) and 5'-GAGAGAGCTCTTACTTGTACAGCTCGTC-3' (reverse) from the pEGFP-C1 vector as a template (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA, USA). Both the PCR product and the pBIN35S vector were digested with XbaI and SacI and were ligated together. The coding regions of the full-length cDNAs of OsRFPH2-3, OsRFPH2-14, OsRFPH2-16, OsRFPH2-23, OsRFPHC-2, OsRFPHC-3, OsRFPHC-4, OsRFPHC-13, and OsRFPV-6 were amplified with the appropriate primer pairs and were then cloned into a 35S:EGFP vector (Supplementary Table S1). The recombinant vectors were verified by sequencing. The resulting plasmids were transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 and used for agro-infiltration. For transient expression of OsRFPs in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves, the Agrobacterium strains harbouring each construct were grown in liquid yeast extract peptone (YEP) medium and resuspended in infiltration medium [10 mM 4-Morpholineethanesulfonic acid hydrate (MES), pH 5.6, 10 mM MgCl2, and 200 mM acetosyringone]. The cell cultures were injected into 4-week-old N. benthamiana leaves (final optical density at 600 nm = 0.5). Several leaves were cut and then observed under confocal microscopy at the Korea Basic Science Institute, Chuncheon Center.2.3. In vitro ubiquitination assayFull-length OsRFP coding sequences (OsRFPH2-3, OsRFPH2-7, OsRFPH2-14, OsRFPH2-16, OsRFPH2-23, OsRFPHC-2, OsRFPHC-3, OsRFPHC-13, and OsRFPV-6) were amplified by RT-PCR with the appropriate primer pairs (Supplementary Table S1). The PCR products were digested and cloned into a pMAL-c5X vector (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). Nine recombinant maltose-binding protein (MBP)-OsRFP plasmids and the MBP-empty plasmid (as a negative control) were expressed in E. coli strain BL21 (DES) pLysS (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and purified by affinity chromatography using amylose resin (New England BioLabs). The full-length coding sequences of AtUBC10 and AtUBC11 were cloned into the pET-28a (+) vector (Novagen, Gibbstown, NJ, USA). 6X His-AtUBC10 and 6X His-AtUBC11 were expressed in E. coli strain BL21 and purified using a Ni-NTA Purification System (Invitrogen).In vitro self-ubiquitination assays were conducted according to the methods of Hardtke et al.19 with some modifications. Briefly, each MBP-OsRFP (250 ng) was purified and mixed with 50 ng yeast E1 (Boston Biochemicals, Cambridge, MA, USA), 250 ng Arabidopsis E2s, and 10 µg bovine Ub (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) before incubation in ubiquitination reaction buffer [50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.05 mM ZnCl2, 1 mM ATP, 0.2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 10 mM phosphocreatine, and 0.1 U creatine kinase (Sigma-Aldrich)]. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 6× SDS sample buffer followed by a 3-h incubation at 30°C. Twenty microliters of each reaction mixture was analysed via 10–14% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) depending on the molecular weight of different fusion proteins and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Immunoblot analyses were conducted using anti-Ub antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich) with secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich). Detection was carried out using the chemiluminescent substrate SuperSignal West Pico (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) for horse-radish peroxidase and imaged on an X-ray film (Kodak).2.4. Yeast two-hybrid screeningA rice cDNA library in the pGADT7-AD (GAL4 activation domain) was generated from salt-treated 14-day-old seedlings. Full-length coding sequences of OsRFPH2-3, OsRFPH2-14, OsRFPH2-16, OsRFPH2-23, OsRFPHC-2, OsRFPHC-13, and OsRFPv-6 were amplified and cloned into pGBKT7-BD (GAL4 DNA-binding domain) vector as bait. A library screening for proteins that interact with OsRFPs was conducted in accordance with the recommended commercial procedures (Make Your Own ‘Mate & Plate TM’ Library System; Matchmaker Gold Yeast Two-Hybrid System; Yeastmaker Yeast Transformation System 2, Clontech). A total of 1540 yeast transformants were selected on a synthetic defined (SD) medium lacking Leu and Trp with 40 µg/ml X-a-Gal and 70 ng/ml aureobasidin A (DDO/X/A). The selected transformants were repatched or dotted on SD medium lacking His, Leu, and Trp with 40 µg/ml X-a-Gal and 70 ng/ml AbA (QDO/X/A). A total of 154 clones were identified as positive interactors with the OsRFPs and were sequenced and verified by BLASTp searches in the GenBank database (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).2.5. Arabidopsis transformationAgrobacterium strains GV3101 containing 35S:OsRFP-EGFPs or 35S:EGFP (control) were used to transform Arabidopsis plants according to the floral-dip method.20 For selection of transgenic lines, seeds harvested from T3 transformants were placed on MS agar plates containing 50 µg/ml kanamycin.2.6. Plant growth and treatmentsThree-independent 35S:OsRFP-EGFP- and 35S:EGFP-overexpressing Arabidopsis lines were tested to observe the effects of salt and drought stresses. For seed germination assays, seeds of OsRFPH2-3-EGFP, OsRFPH2-14-EGFP, OsRFPH2-16-EGFP, OsRFPH2-23-EGFP, OsRFPHC-2-EGFP, OsRFPHC-3-EGFP, OsRFPHC-4-EGFP, OsRFPHC-13-EGFP, OsRFPV-6-EGFP, and 35S:EGFP (control) were sterilized in 70% ethanol for 5 min followed by 20% bleach for 3 min and were then rinsed three times with double-distilled water. Sterilized seeds were sown and monitored on 1/2 MS medium containing different concentrations (0, 100, or 150 mM) of NaCl and (-0.25, -0.5, or -0.7 MPa) of PEG 8000 (Sigma-Aldrich). Germination percentages were scored and calculated at 1-day interval for 7 days. PEG plates were prepared as described by Verslues et al.21 Briefly, 40 ml of 1.5% agar containing 1/2 MS medium was solidified for 16 h and then overlaid with 60 ml of a solution containing 0, 250, or 400 g/l PEG 8000, yielding final MPas of -0.25, -0.5, or -0.7, respectively. The PEG solution was allowed to stand for 24 h and was then removed from the plates. For root elongation assays, transgenic seeds were germinated on 1/2 MS medium for 2 days and transferred into medium containing 100 mM NaCl and -0.5 MPa PEG. Plant growth was then monitored and photographed after 7 days, at which point root length was analysed using Image J software.2.7. Transcriptome analysis and in silico subcellular localization predictionThe cell intensity file (CEL) files of Affymetrix GeneChip genome arrays for four abiotic stresses [drought, salt, cold (GSE6901), and heat stress (GSE14245)] of O. sativa were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets of the NCBI database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) and were then normalized by the robust multi-array average (RMA) method with R statistical software (http://www.r-project.org/). The similarities of expression patterns between genes under the different stresses were evaluated via Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC). The regulatory pathways of genes were predicted by using MapMan software.22 Heat maps of the genes were visualized by the MEV v4.6 program (http://www.tm4.org/) using hierarchical clustering with default parameters. In silico subcellular localization was predicted by WoLF PSORT tools23 with default parameters, and the predicted localizations with the highest PSORT feature values were then chosen. An interaction map consisting of OsRFPs and interactors was visualized using Cytoscape software.243. Results3.1. Expression patterns of 47 OsRFP genes in response to abiotic stressesA total of 47 OsRFP genes, including 24 RING-H2, 16 RING-HC, and 7 RING-v subtypes, were randomly selected from targets with high levels of expression in specific tissues and/or stress treatments.11 In an effort to evaluate the expression patterns of 47 OsRFP genes in response to abiotic stresses, we retrieved microarray datasets for different stressors, including drought (GSE6901), salt (GSE6901), heat (GSE6901), and cold (GSE14245) in rice deposited to the GEO database (Fig. 1).25Expression patterns, general information, and gene structures of 47 RFPs in rice.

The colours of boxes represent different protein domains.We next conducted semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis with leaf tissues of rice seedlings (O. sativa) subjected to dehydration, high salinity (200 mM NaCl), cold (4°C), and basal heat (45°C) stress conditions for 2 days and then evaluated the transcript levels of 47 OsRFP genes (Fig. 2). At least 60% (8 of 12) of the seedlings up-regulated OsRFP genes as a result of dehydration stress. The seedlings also showed a tendency to increase OsRFP transcript levels in response to salinity. For example, eight genes, i.e. OsRFPH2-3, OsRFPH2-11, OsRFPH2-14, OsRFPH2-16, OsRFPH2-23, OsRFPHC-03, OsRFPHC-13, and OsRFPv-6, were up-regulated under drought and salinity conditions. In addition, OsRFPH2-2, OsRFPH2-7, OsRFPH2-12, and OsRFPH2-22 were up-regulated under drought, whereas OsRFPHC-2, OsRFPHC-4, OsRFPHC-10, and OsRFPv-6 were down-regulated under salt stress. One gene (OsRFPHC-12) and five genes (OsRFPH2-6, OsRFPH2-8, OsRFPH2-24, OsRFPHC-5, and OsRFPHC-12) were down-regulated under drought and salt, respectively. Under cold stress conditions, transcripts levels of four OsRFP genes increased, whereas 23 OsRFP genes were down-regulated. For heat stress conditions, six genes were up-regulated, whereas nine genes were down-regulated. These findings support the hypothesis regarding evolutional fate of duplicate genes, i.e. there is functional diversity and redundancy in OsRFP genes. Expression analysis of 47 OsRFP genes in rice plants. Expression patterns of OsRFP genes subjected to plant abiotic stresses. Fourteen-day-old rice seedlings were treated with dehydration (dehydration on two pieces of tissue papers), cold (4°C), or heat (45°C). Leaf tissues were sampled at 0, 1, 6, 12, and 24 h. Os18S-rRNA was used as an internal control. C and T indicate control and stress-treated samples, respectively. Red and blue arrows indicate up-regulation or down-regulation of indicated genes, respectively.Expression analysis of 47 OsRFP genes in rice plants.

Red and blue arrows indicate up-regulation or down-regulation of indicated genes, respectively.To better understand the subcellular distribution of OsRFPs, we performed in silico prediction using WolF PSORT.23 At least 66.0% (31 of 47) of OsRFPs were associated with the nucleus (19 OsRFPs) and the cytosol (12 OsRFPs). The other OsRFPs were predicted to localize to the chloroplast (seven OsRFPs), plasma membrane (seven OsRFPs), mitochondria (one OsRFP), and extracellular matrix (one OsRFP), as shown in Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. S1. To further define the structures of the 47 OsRFPs, we examined whether these OsRFPs harboured any other functional domains using the InterPro search program. A total of 32 OsRFPs did not harbour any other detectable domains, whereas 15 proteins had one or more functional domains (Fig. 1). Three of these domains harboured zinc finger domains, such ZF-C3H1, ZF-SIAH, and ZF-CHY, which have been characterized as nucleic acid-binding zinc fingers, while one was the zinc finger domain, ZF-ZZ, which is believed to mediate PPIs. Furthermore, other PPI domains were found, including ankyrin repeats, after the C_terminal domain of a breast cancer susceptibility protein (BRCT), and kinesin motor domains, which may function as the substrate-binding domains of E3 ligases.103.2. Subcellular localization of OsRFP–EGFP fusion proteinsIt is generally believed that the subcellular localization of a gene is important in understanding its cellular function. Therefore, we decided to further examine the subcellular localization of 10 OsRFP genes (OsRFPH2-2, OsRFPH2-3, OsRFPH2-14, OsRFPH2-16, OsRFPH2-23, OsRFPHC-2, OsRFPHC-3, OsRFPHC-4, OsRFPHC-13, and OsRFPv-6), chosen depending on their expression patterns under salt and dehydration conditions. To do this, full-length OsRFP cDNAs were cloned into 35S:EGFP and transformed into Agrobacterium strain GV3101. Each of the 10 OsRFP-EGFPs and the control (35S:EGFP) were transiently expressed in N. benthamiana leaves. As shown in Fig. 3J, transient expression of 35S:EGFP was found in both the cytosol and nucleus. Fluorescent signals of each of the fusion proteins (OsRFPH2-14-EGFP, OsRFPHC-2-EGFP, and OsRFPHC-13-EGFP) were localized to the cytoplasm. Three proteins, OsRFPH2-16-EGFP, OsRFPHC-4-EGFP, and OsRFPv-6-EGFP, appeared as small, punctuate spots with their aggregates in the cytoplasm. Interestingly, subcellular localization of OsRFPHC-4-EGFP was observed as punctate spots not only in the cytoplasm, but also in the plasma membrane. In addition, OsRFPH2-3-EGFP and OsRFPHC-3-EGFP were localized to both the plasma membrane and nucleus, respectively. OsRFPH2-23-EGFP was localized to both the plasma membrane and nucleus, respectively. However, OsRFPH2-2-EGFP did not show any fluorescence in cells (data not shown).

Images were captured and merged by z-series optical sections after 3 days of agro-infiltration. A 35S:EGFP construct was used as a control.Subcellular localization of the OsRFP–EGFP fusion proteins in tobacco leaves.

Images were captured and merged by z-series optical sections after 3 days of agro-infiltration. A 35S:EGFP construct was used as a control.3.3. Rice RING domain possess E3 Ub ligase activityProteins harbouring RING domains are involved in numerous cellular processes. Functions attributed to the RING domain itself include PPIs and degradation via Ub-26S proteasome. RFPs can be classified based on the presence of either a Cys or His residue in their RING domains. However, it is still an open question as to whether the modified RING domains function as E3 ligases. We therefore used in vitro ubiquitination assays to examine a total of 10 OsRFPs (OsRFPH2-2, OsRFPH2-3, OsRFPH2-14, OsRFPH2-16, OsRFPH2-23, OsRFPHC-2, OsRFPHC-3, OsRFPHC-4, OsRFPHC-13, and OsRFPv-6), chosen on the basis of their expression patterns under salt and dehydration conditions. Each of the 10 OsRFPs was fused with MBP and expressed in E. coli. However, MBP-OsRFPHC-4 was never expressed in this E. coli system, even under several modified conditions. A total of nine MBP-OsRFPs, with the exception of OsRFPHC-4, were purified by affinity chromatography using amylose resin. The purified MBP-OsRFP fusion proteins were mixed with Ub, ATP, E1 (yeast), and E2s (AtUBC10 or AtUBC11) and then incubated for 3 h. Immunoblot analysis with anti-Ub antibodies showed that a high-molecular mass poly-Ub chain was present in eight OsRFP samples (Fig. 4). However, no poly-Ub chain was observed when MBP-OsRFPH2-3 was incubated with AtUBC11 (Fig. 4B, lane 7). In addition, omission of E2s, E1, or MBP-OsRFPs from the activity assay resulted in a loss of protein ubiquitination. Thus, most of the selected OsRFPs were capable of mediating E2-dependent protein ubiquitination in vitro. In vitro E3 ligase ubiquitin ligase activity of MBP-OsRPFs. The ubiquitination reaction contained E1, atE2s (Arabidopsis UBC10 and UBC11), maltose-binding protein-tagged OsRFPH2-2 (A), OsRFPH2-3 (B), OsRFPH2-14 (C), OsRFPH2-16 (D), OsRFPH2-23 (E), OsRFPHC-2 (F), OsRFPHC-3 (G), OsRFPHC-13 (H), or OsRFPv-6 (I), Ub, and ATP.

Poly-Ub chains were detected by immunoblotting with a Ub-specific antibody.3.4. Physical interaction map of OsRFPsA yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screen was conducted in order to retrieve proteins that interacted with each of the 10 OsRFPs Ub E3 ligases. Of these, seven OsRFP genes (OsRFPH2-3, OsRFPH2-14, OsRFPH2-16, OsRFPH2-23, OsRFPHC-2, OsRFPHC-13, and OsRFPv-6) were screened, and their interactors were identified via sequencing analysis. Unfortunately, the transformed yeast cells expressing OsRFPHC-3 did not survive on the selection medium for more than three replications and, thus, the gene was excluded from further experiments. Positive interactors were not found for two genes, such as OsRFPH2-2 and OsRFPHC-4. A total of 229 positive clones were screened and selected depending on their a-galactosidase activity, resulting in 147 positive interactors (Supplementary Fig. S2). To understand their cellular distribution, we performed in silico prediction analysis by examining their subcellular localization (Fig. 5A and Supplementary Fig. S2). The interaction network of rice OsRFPs. (A) A total of 147 interactors with drought- and/or salt-induced OsRFPH2-3, OsRFPH2-14, OsRFPH2-16, OsRFPH2-23, OsRFPHC-2, OsRFPHC-13, and OsRFPv-6 proteins detected by yeast two-hybrid screens are shown as a physical interaction network.

Numbers in parentheses indicate the number of interaction with OsRFPs.The Y2H screenings also showed that the seven OsRFPs interacted with various environmental stress-related proteins (Supplementary Fig. S2). For example, membrane-localized OsRFPH2-3 interacted with peptidyl-proly cis-trans isomerase, Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, FKBP-type (Os02g52290), aquaporin protein (Os02g44630), wound-induced protein (Os11g37970), Cys-rich repeat secretory protein 55 (Os03g16950), coiled-coil domain-containing protein (Os08g39090), and DUF581 domain-containing protein (Os04g49670). OsRFPH2-14 interacted with copper methylamine oxidase (Os04g40040), jacalin-like lectin domain-containing protein (Os01g24710), profilin domain-containing protein (Os06g05880), and universal stress protein (Os05g28740). The OsRFPH2-16 protein interacted with glycosylhydrolase and OsFBT7-F box and tubby domain-containing protein (Os05g36190). OsRFPH2-23 interacted with RNA recognition motif-containing protein (Os11g40510), Cys-rich repeat secretory protein 55 precursor (Os03g16950), glycosyltransferase (Os02g32750), and jaclin-like lectin domain-containing protein (Os01g24710). OsRFPHC-2 and OsRFPHC-13 interacted with myeloid differentiation protein (MD)-2-related lipid-recognition domain protein (Os07g06590) and peroxidase precursor (Os04g51300), respectively. OsRFPv-6 interacted with early flowering 3 (ELF3) protein (Os01g38530), indole-3-glycerol phosphate synthase (Os08g23150), ABC transporter (Os03g08380), Myb-like DNA-binding domain-containing protein (Os02g04640), S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase (Os03g36910), and aquaporin protein (Os07g26690). Furthermore, we found multiple proteins that interacted with more than two OsRFPs, including Ub family protein (Os02g06640) and jacalin-like lectin domain-containing protein (Os01g24710), six expressed proteins (Os09g00999, Os02g22130, Os10g21190, Os09g01000, Os05g02070, and Os01g15270), universal stress protein (Os05g28740), and serine/arginine repetitive matrix protein 1 (Os05g01540; Fig. 5B).An obvious difference was observed in the frequencies of subcellular localizations of these interactors. As shown in Fig. 5A and Supplementary Table S2, about 36.7% (44 of 120) of interactors of the seven OsRFPs were predicted to localize to chloroplasts. In contrast, 19.2% (23 of 120) and 20.8% (25 of 120) of the interactors were predicted to localize to both the cytosol and nucleus, respectively.An in silico analysis of the subcellular localizations of the interactors and in vivo subcellular localizations of OsRFPs demonstrated the dynamic interactions of OsRFPs with other subcellularly localized protein partners (Fig. 5A and Supplementary Table S2). For example, even though OsRFPH2-23-EGFP was targeted to the nucleus in vivo, it showed physical interactions with chloroplast-localized proteins (i.e. Os03g16950, Os02g32750, Os02g49720, Os07g36600, and Os07g29290) as well as nuclear-targeted proteins (Os11g40510 and Os08g31980). In addition, the plasma membrane-associated protein, OsRFPH2-3, exhibited interactions with eight chloroplast-targeting proteins (i.e. Os02g52290, Os07g37240, Os03g19380, Os03g16950, Os06g38210, Os05g28740, Os05g39960, and Os02g05830) and two nuclear-targeted proteins (Os05g02070 and Os08g39090).3.5. Comparative transcriptome analysis of OsRFPs with interactorsTo further investigate the functional relationships of seven OsRFP genes and their interactors against four abiotic stresses (drought, salt, heat, and cold), their expression patterns in response to these stresses were evaluated using a public microarray dataset (Supplementary Table S3). A total of 7 OsRFP genes and 112 interactor genes were found to correspond to one or more probes, respectively, whereas no probes were found for eight interactors. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were classified as either up-regulated (log2-fold change >1) or down-regulated (log2-fold change <-1) via a comparison of probe signal intensities with treated plants and untreated plants. Of the 119 genes, 52 and 25 genes were either up-regulated or down-regulated under one or more stress treatments, respectively, and were considered as DEGs (Fig. 6A). A total of 25 (48%) up-regulated and 2 (8.0%) down-regulated genes commonly responded to both drought and salt, supporting the hypothesis that the genes may exhibit similar molecular functions in both stresses. In contrast, heat stress resulted in the up-regulation of 13 genes and the down-regulation 12 genes. These genes were not modulated in response to any other stresses.

(B) Expression patterns of OsRFPs and their interactors in different functions detected by MapMan (http://mapman.gabipd.org). Green circles in protein degradation indicate the seven OsRFPs.We then grouped the DEGs depending on their activities in different regulatory pathways by using the MapMan program. A total of eight pathways, i.e. protein degradation, transcription factor, thioredoxin, ascorb/gluath, receptor kinases, ethylene, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), and light, were mapped (Fig. 6B). As expected, the genes with the highest frequency were those involved in protein degradation (18 genes). The genes involved in transcription factors had the second highest frequency (10 genes). Similarly, genes included in both pathways exhibited closer relationships in expression patterns between drought and salt stresses.3.6. Tolerance evaluation by overexpression of each OsRFP gene in Arabidopsis grown under salt and drought conditionsThe finding that the selected OsRFP genes were up-regulated in response to salt and/or dehydration treatment may provide some clues regarding the molecular functions of these genes against stresses. Therefore, to further examine their functions, we generated eight transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing each gene (35S:RFPH2-3-EGFP, 35S:RFPH2-14-EGFP, 35S:RFPH2-16-EGFP, 35S:RFPH2-23-EGFP, 35S:RFPHC-2-EGFP, 35S:RFPHC-3-EGFP, 35S:RFPHC-13-EGFP, and 35S:RFPv-6-EGFP) and examined their tolerances against both stresses. The Agrobacterium strains GV3101 containing 35S:OsRFP-EGFPs and 35S:EGFP (control) were used to transform Arabidopsis plants. Three-independent transgenic lines (T3) were selected depending on the expression levels of the OsRFP genes by RT-PCR under normal conditions (Supplementary Fig. S3).For germination rate analysis, sterilized seeds of three-independent lines of eight transgenic plants as well as 35S:EGFP were placed on 1/2 MS medium containing different concentrations of NaCl (0, 100, or 150 mM) and PEG (0 or -0.7 MPa). Germination rates of transgenic lines and control seeds were not significantly different on 1/2 MS medium without treatment (Supplementary Fig. S4). In contrast, parts of the transgenic seeds of OsRFP-EGFPs germinated faster than control seeds when seeds were plated on 1/2 MS medium supplemented with NaCl (150 mM) and PEG (-0.7 MPa; Figs 7 and 8). For example, even though about 46.6% of control seeds germinated 7 days after plating with 150 mM NaCl treatment, four transgenic lines exhibited >70% germination rations, including OsRFPH2-23 (74.4%), OsRFPHC-3 (92.2%), OsRFPHC-13 (87.7%), and OsRFPv-6 (78.8%; Fig. 7). In dehydration stress, control seeds were not germinated on PEG (-0.7 MPa) plates until 7 days after plating, but transgenic seeds of OsRFPH2-14, OsRFPH2-23, OsRFPHC-3, and OsRFPv-6 showed high germination rates with a range of 31–79% (Fig. 8). Increased germination rates of seven overexpressed OsRFP genes in Arabidopsis under salt stress conditions. Three-independent seeds from 35S:OsRFPH2-3-EGFP (A), 35S:OsRFPH2-14-EGFP (B), 35S:OsRFPH2-16-EGFP (C), 35S:OsRFPH2-23-EGFP (D), 35S:OsRFPHC-2-EGFP (E), 35S:OsRFPHC-3-EGFP (F), 35S:OsRFPHC-13-EGFP (G), and 35S:OsRFPv-6-EGFP (H) with control plants (35S:EGFP) were plated on 1/2 MS containing 150 mM NaCl. Germination percentages for each experiment were scored and calculated at 1-day interval for 7 days. Data represent means ± SDs of three-independent experiments (n = 30).Increased germination rates of seven overexpressed OsRFP genes in Arabidopsis under salt stress conditions.

Germination percentages for each experiment were scored and calculated at 1-day intervals for 7 days. Data represent means ± SDs of three-independent experiments (n = 30).For root growth assays, sterilized seeds of three-independent lines of eight OsRFP-EGFPs and 35S:EGFP were plated on 1/2 MS medium. Germinated seeds were then transferred onto 1/2 MS medium containing 100 mM NaCl and -0.5 MPa PEG. The root lengths of OsRFPH2-3, OsRFPH2-14, OsRFPH2-16, OsRFPH2-23, OsRFPHC-2, and OsRFPHC-13 were not significantly different from those of control plants; however, the root lengths of two transgenic lines (OsRFPHC-3 and OsRFPv-6) were significantly longer than those of control plants (Supplementary Fig. S5A). Overexpression of OsRFPHC-3 and OsRFPv-6 genes therefore improved seedling growth and root length under normal conditions. We further assessed the effects of salt (100 mM NaCl) and PEG (-0.5 MPa) treatments on the roots of transgenic seedlings. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S5B and C, most of the root lengths of transgenic lines were significantly longer than those of control plants.Since parts of the transgenic plants exhibited tolerance to PEG treatment, we compared accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in transgenic and control plant leaves after dehydration treatment. To do this, each leaf was dehydrated for 90 min and then incubated with 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining solution. The analysis of DAB staining indicated that H2O2 accumulation was greater in all transgenic leaves than in control plants (Supplementary Fig. S6), suggesting that overexpression of OsRFPs in Arabidopsis caused dehydration-induced H2O2 accumulation. Finally, 2-week-old control and transgenic plants were exposed to drought stress for 10 days by being deprived of water. After the drought treatment, control and transgenic plants were irrigated for 5 days, and their survival rates were determined (Supplementary Fig. S7). When grown under normal conditions in soil, no significant difference in phenotypes was observed between control and transgenic plants. However, after exposure to drought stress (i.e. no irrigation for 10 days), the transgenic plants exhibited more tolerance than control plants. After watering again, the survival rates of the transgenic plants were significantly higher than those of the control plants (Supplementary Fig. S7). For example, the survival rates of OsRFPH2-3 and OsRFPHC-13 transgenic plants reached 67.6% (48 of 71 for #2) and 58.9% (43 of 73 for #1), while those in control plants only reached 4% (50 of 275) and 7.5% (6 of 79), respectively. These results implied that heterogeneous overexpression of the selected OsRFP genes in Arabidopsis can promote the germination rate, seedling growth, and survival rate under salt and drought stress conditions.4. DiscussionPreviously, we identified a gene family encoding rice RFPs and divided their members on the basis of the presence of a zinc-coordinating Cys or His residue in their RING domain.11 In addition, their expression patterns across a wide variety of tissues and environments were evaluated via in silico analysis, with a dataset of 155 GEO samples on a rice genome microarray. By using these methods, we were able to divide the 369 OsRFP genes into five groups. Interestingly, members in three of the groups showed distinct expression patterns in specific tissues and/or environments, leading us to further investigate their molecular functions. We randomly selected about half of the proteins in the three groups (47 of 102) and analysed their molecular functions to elucidate their evolutionary dynamics and fate.The analysis of PPIs is critical to understanding the biological functions of different proteins during cellular processes. The interactions of RING E3 ligases are generally localized to the same organelles or an interactable subcellular compartment in the cell. For example, the Arabidopsis RING E3 ligase, DRIP1, which can interact with the transcription factor, DREB2A, and regulates DRIP1 protein levels via the 26S proteasome system, is localized to the nucleus.14 In addition, the endoplasmic reticulum membrane-localized Rma1H1 inhibits subcellular trafficking of ER-localized PIP2;1 to the plasma membrane.15 In this study, we demonstrated the subcellular localization of nine OsRFP-EGFPs via transient expression in tobacco cells and predicted that they had 120 interactors via in silico analysis (Figs 1–3). However, we observed inconsistencies in the subcellular colocalization of OsRFPs and their interactors. For example, OsRFPH2-14 was localized to the cytoplasm, and only 7 of its 22 interactors were associated with the same location. The plasma membrane-localized OsRFPH2-3 had only one interactor, aquaporin protein, which was also targeted to the plasma membrane. Interestingly, 44 of the 120 interactors of seven OsRFPs were localized to chloroplasts, even though there were no chloroplast-localized OsRFPs (Fig. 5A and Supplementary Table S2). Our findings therefore raise questions regarding the physical interactions of OsRFPs and their interactors in cases in which each OsRFP/interactor is localized to different compartments. An increasing body of evidence suggests that proteins can be translocated to other cellular organelles during certain physiological and environmental conditions.26,27 Additionally, a variety of studies have indicated that plant RING E3 ligases show dynamic translocation and partitioning for the activation of cellular process during specific conditions. For example, cytoplasm-localized Arabidopsis HOS1 RING E3 ligase accumulates in the nucleus in response to low temperature treatments and localizes to the cytoplasm without cold treatment.28 In addition, nuclear-localized COP1 RING E3 ligase is translocated to the cytoplasm under light signals for the activation of photomorphogenic development.29,30 Therefore, the translocation (or partitioning) of RING E3 ligases may be a general cellular mechanism through which plants adapt to the environment via post-translational modifications. Interestingly, one of the genes we studied, OsRFPHC-10, harbours a kinesin motor domain. The presence of this domain might be a reflection of the functional evolution of the members of the E3 ligase family to acquire their own mobility. Further analysis of OsRFPHC-10 is required to conclusively determine whether this is the case.Our finding that some interactors exhibit multiple PPIs with one or more OsRFPs may support the hypothesis that there is complexity and redundancy in the post-translational regulation of substrate proteins via the 26S proteasome pathway. For example, the OsSalT (Os01g24710, jacalin-like lectin domain protein) protein appeared to interact physically with four OsRFPs (OsRFPH2-3, OsRFPH2-14, OsRFPH2-16, and OsRFPH2-23). Transcript levels and protein accumulation of OsSalT were reported to have increased significantly in response to salt and drought stresses.31–33 A possible hypothesis is that the stress-inducible protein, which is induced under a variety of environments, participates in multiple stress regulation pathways and is regulated by unique OsRFPs.In the ubiquitination pathway, RING E3 ligases are generally known to recognize specific target proteins as substrates and directly transfer Ub from an E2 ligase to the substrate without an E3-Ub intermediate.6 The finding that five OsRFPs may exhibit physical interactions with the Ub protein is somewhat inconsistent with this notion. In contrast, a large number of Ub E3 ligases have been reported to have the ability to catalyse their own ubiquitination.34 Self-ubiquitination, which can occur in substrate-independent and substrate-dependent modes, supports the notion that RING E3 ligases can protect the substrate proteins or their own proteins from self-destruction.35,36 Thus, our results support the hypothesis that a large number of OsRFPs may have the ability for self-ubiquitination under specific conditions.Increasing numbers of plant RING E3 ligases have been reported to regulate molecular responses to abiotic stresses, supporting the hypothesis that they play an important role in the regulation of stress-induced cellular processes. RING E3 ligases are known to positively and negatively regulate target proteins via the 26S proteasomal degradation pathway. For example, salt- and drought-induced SDIR1 are believed to be a positive regulator of ABA signalling.12 Drought-induced Rma1H1 also plays a role in responses to dehydration via inhibition of aquaporin trafficking between compartments, which lead to subsequent aquaporin degradation.15 In addition, OsDIS1 and DRIP1 E3 ligases play negative roles in drought–stress tolerance through post-translational modification of their transcription factors.14,17 The finding that overexpressing E3 ligases in most plants confer protection against salt and/or dehydration stress may be explained by their ability to regulate proteins via the 26S proteasomal degradation pathway. However, further research is required to confirm these results. The OsRFPH2-3 protein, whose overexpression in plants conferred protection against dehydration, may interact with an aquaporin protein and, thus, the inhibition of the aquaporin protein through OsRFPH2-3 E3 ligase could improve drought tolerance in transgenic plants. Similarly, the finding that OsRFPv-6 clearly confers salt and dehydration stress tolerance and interacts with aquaporin as well as ABC transporters37 may also support this hypothesis. Furthermore, Aharon et al.38 reported that overexpression of the plasma membrane aquaporin, PIP1b, in tobacco caused a hypersensitive phenotype to drought stress. The study suggested that enhanced water transport activity via plasma membrane aquaporins and ABC transporters may negatively affect plants during drought stress. Therefore, our findings regarding the dynamic responses of OsRFPs to abiotic stresses, the tolerance of their overexpression in plants, and their interactors' profiles may provide some clues regarding their molecular regulation of abiotic stress responses. Furthermore, the fact that heterogeneous overexpression of OsRFPs enhances drought and/or salt tolerance warrants further investigation, since it is a mechanism through which we can enhance monocot plants (including rice) using genetic approaches.The finding that there was high accumulation of H2O2 during drought stress in all tested plants overexpressing E3 ligases compared with control plants may provide strong evidence regarding the relationship between H2O2 and stress tolerance in plants. H2O2 production may involve ABA-induced stomatal closure and act as an intermediate in ABA signalling.39 A host of studies have demonstrated the positive relationship between H2O2 accumulation and ABA-mediated drought–stress tolerance in overexpressing plants. For example, plants overexpressing AtAIRP2 (a cytosolic RING-HC type Arabidopsis E3 ligase) exhibited strong tolerance to drought stress, producing higher levels of H2O2 than knockout plants and wild-type plants.16 Therefore, our findings may be a good example of the positive relationship between H2O2 accumulation and stress tolerance in plants overexpressing the RING E3 ligase gene. In conclusion, the findings obtained in our comprehensive study may provide some insights into the biological functions of RING E3 ligases and may provide genetic strategies that promote plant adaptation to unfavourable environmental conditions.Supplementary DataSupplementary Data are available atwww.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by grants from the BioGreen21 Program (no.

IntroductionAs crop plants are sessile organisms, environmental stresses such as drought and high salinity can compromise economic output and the overall human food supply.1 Drought stress gives rise to biochemical, physiological, and morphological changes that adversely affect the growth, development, and productivity of plants.2–5 The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) mediates a variety of physiological and cellular processes, including the response to drought and salt stresses. ABA is synthesized de novo under water-deficit conditions, activates stress-related signal transduction pathways, and modulates the expression of stress-related genes that lead to a variety of physiological and cellular responses, including the accumulation of osmolytes, stomata closure, and tolerance to drought and salt stresses.6–12ABA is synthesized during dehydration and degraded during rehydration. Key genes involved in ABA biosynthesis during dehydration have recently been identified based on genetic and molecular approaches, particularly in Arabidopsis.13 Many of these are induced by dehydration stress, including the AtNCED3 gene for 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED),14 the AAO3 gene for abscisic aldehyde oxidase,15 the AtABA3 gene for molybdenum cofactor sulphurase,16 and the AtZEP gene for zeaxanthin epoxidase.17 The carotenoid cleavage reaction is a key irreversible step in the ABA biosynthesis pathway.18 This supports the key role of NCED in ABA biosynthesis. In the Arabidopsis genome, there are five NCED genes (AtNCEDs). Among them, AtNCED3 is most strongly induced by dehydration and high salinity. Iuchi et al.14 demonstrated that the expression of AtNCED3 is induced by dehydration stress and increases the level of endogenous ABA under dehydration conditions. Overexpression of AtNCED3 improves tolerance to dehydration stress in transgenic plants, whereas its knockout mutant has a dehydration-sensitive phenotype.14 This indicates that the induction of AtNCED3 regulates the accumulation of ABA during dehydration.14The induction of AtNCED3 occurs in the early stages of the response to dehydration stress.19 Hence, we believe that it is important to understand the regulation of AtNCED3 transcription to understand the molecular processes involved in early dehydration responses before the production of ABA. Therefore, it is essential to identify and understand the cis-acting elements in the AtNCED3 promoter involved in the responses to dehydration stress. A previous study analysed the effects of a 1.5-kb AtNCED3 promoter on tissue-specific expression in transgenic Arabidopsis; however, the GUS reporter gene was not induced in response to water deficit.20 There has been no comprehensive analysis of the AtNCED3 promoter under dehydration stress.In the present study, we analysed the longer promoter region of the AtNCED3 promoter to identify cis-acting elements involved in the induction of the gene in response to dehydration. We found that a 3.0-kb region functions in the induced response to dehydration stress and contains cis-acting elements involved in dehydration-induced gene expression. Then, we narrowed down the promoter region to a 200 bp region at -2.2-kb and identified cis-acting elements involved in the response of AtNCED3 to dehydration. We found that a G-box-like cis-regulatory element is essential for the dehydration-responsive induction of AtNCED3. We discuss the transcriptional regulation of AtNCED3 in the early dehydration response.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materials and stress treatmentTransgenic plants of Arabidopsis thaliana (Columbia ecotype) were grown on germination medium (GM) agar plates with appropriate antibiotics at 22°C.21 Plants (transgenic lines or Col ecotype) were grown under continuous light at 22°C for 2 weeks. Plants were exposed to dehydration as described previously.22,232.2. Plasmid constructs and transgenic Arabidopsis plantsLinker and primer sequences are described in Supplementary Table S1. To construct the pBE-CD vector, two types of linker were annealed and ligated into the EcoRI and HindIII sites of the pBE2113 vector.24 The resulting vector was designated the pBE-CD vector.To make a construct including the 3.0-kb region of the AtNCED3 promoter fused with the GUS gene, the promoter region of Arabidopsis genomic DNA and the GUS-NOS terminator region of the pBI101 vector were amplified by PCR. The amplified fragments were digested using the NotI restriction enzyme and then ligated. The ligated fragment and pBE-CD vector were digested using the SfiI restriction enzyme; these were again ligated (Fig. 1A).

These promoter regions were amplified by PCR from Arabidopsis genomic DNA, and the amplified fragments were digested using the SalI restriction enzyme and ligated into the SalI site of the pBI101GFP vector (Fig. 2, constructs A and B).

The score index to the right indicates the mean and related standard error value (n = 3) for each construct (C–F) among related transgenic lines.To analyse the -3.0- to -1.8-kb promoter region, three constructs were designed (Fig. 3, constructs D–F). The amplified promoter fragments of the -3.0- to -2.5-kb region, -2.6- to -2.1-kb region, and -2.2- to -1.8-kb region were digested separately using the SfiI restriction enzyme. In addition, each promoter fragment was ligated into the SfiI-digested 0.1-kb promoter region fused with GFP fragments and then inserted into the SfiI-digested pBE-CD vector.To analyse the -2.6- to -2.1-kb promoter region, two constructs were designed (Fig. 4, constructs G and H). The amplified promoter fragments of the -2.6- to -2.2-kb region and the -2.3- to -2.1-kb region were digested using the BamHI restriction enzyme. Each promoter fragment was inserted into the BamHI site of the pBluescript SK+ vector, amplified by PCR, ligated into the SfiI-digested 0.1-kb promoter region fused with GFP fragments, and then inserted into the SfiI-digested pBE-CD vector.

The base substitutions were introduced via overlap extension PCR (OE-PCR), using two primer sets (Supplementary Table S1).25,26 The sequence of primer 2 of set 1 was a complementary sequence of primer 1 of set 2. Two types of promoter fragments were amplified using each primer set. The amplified fragments were mixed and then a second PCR was conducted using primer 1 of set 1 and primer 2 of set 2. The resultant fragments were digested using the BamHI restriction enzyme. The rest of the process for introducing these final fragments into the pBE-CD vector was the same as that described above for the –2.6- to –2.1-kb promoter region.

The score index to the right indicates the mean and related standard error value (n = 3) for each construct (M1, M2, and M3) among related transgenic lines.To investigate the effect of mutations in the 3.0-kb AtNCED3 pro::GFP, constructs with no mutations (NMT) and construct M4 with the Box I base substitution (Fig. 6A) were designed. To make the NMT construct, the 3.0-kb promoter region was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA as a template. The total sequence promoter area is shown in Fig. 7B. The promoter fragments were mixed with GFP::NOS terminator fragments, and re-amplified by PCR using the 5' primer of the promoter and the 3' primer of the NOS terminator. The amplified fragments were digested using the SfiI restriction enzyme and inserted into the SfiI site of the pBE-CD vector. The method for introducing the mutation was basically the same as that previously described. Two types of promoter fragments were amplified by PCR using primer set 1 or set 2 from the NMT construct as a template. The amplified fragments were mixed and then a second PCR was conducted using primer 1 of set 1 and primer 2 of set 2. The resultant PCR products were inserted into the SfiI site of the pBE-CD vector.

Arabidopsis plants (Col ecotype) were transformed by these constructs using Agrobacterium infiltration methods. Generated T2 plants were used.2.3 GUS staining assayThe T2 transgenic plants of AtNCED3 pro::GUS lines were grown on Murashige and Skoog medium containing kanamycin. Transgenic plants at different growth stages (5 and 10 days, and 2 weeks old) were used for GUS staining. Histochemical assays of GUS activity were conducted as described previously.272.4 Expression analysis of the GFP reporter gene and AtNCED33. Results3.1. The 3.0-kb region of the AtNCED3 promoter contains cis-acting regulatory elements involved in dehydration-induced transcriptionPrevious reports have indicated that the 1.5-kb AtNCED3 promoter region does not contain the cis-acting elements involved in the dehydration-responsive expression of the gene. We also confirmed this in transgenic Arabidopsis. To analyse the AtNCED3 promoter in transgenic Arabidopsis plants, we used the 3.0-kb upstream region from the transcriptional initiation site of AtNCED3. We defined the AtNCED3 upstream region as the promoter. The transcriptional initiation site of AtNCED3 was deduced to be located 122 bp upstream of the initiation codon of AtNCED3. Using the TAIR database, annotation results showed that there were no neighbouring genes in the 3.0-kb upstream region of AtNCED3. Arabidopsis transgenic plants were generated by constructing an AtNCED3 promoter::ß-glucuronidase (AtNCED3 pro::GUS) fusion gene (Fig. 1A). Forty-five independent Arabidopsis transgenic lines were generated for the AtNCED3 promoter::GUS construct, and more than 20 lines were analysed by histochemical GUS staining. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants grown 15 or 16 days after germination were used for the dehydration treatment. GUS staining was observed in roots, leaf veins, and vascular tissues when the transgenic plants were subjected to dehydration (Fig. 1B), whereas no or weak GUS staining was observed in non-stressed plants. This indicates that the 3.0-kb AtNCED3 promoter region contains cis-regulatory elements that induce the GUS reporter gene in response to dehydration.3.2. The AtNCED3 promoter region between 3.0 and 2.0-kb is necessary for the induction of AtNCED3 by dehydrationTo determine the regulatory region of AtNCED3 more precisely, transgenic Arabidopsis plants transformed with AtNCED3 pro::GFP fusion genes were analysed. We generated two constructs (A and B) that contained the GFP reporter gene fused with the AtNCED3 promoter region between -3.0 or -2.0-kb and +4 bp from the transcriptional start site of AtNCED3. We used the GFP reporter gene for further analysis of the AtNCED3 promoter, because GFP is sensitive for the detection of promoter induction. The induction score index was highest in the Arabidopsis transgenic plants with construct A (191 ± 43 versus 14 ± 3 for construct B; Fig. 2). This shows that the 1.0-kb AtNCED3 promoter region between -3.0- and -2.0-kb contains the dehydration-responsive cis-acting element(s) (Fig. 2).3.3. A 200 bp region at the 2.13-kb AtNCED3 promoter contains cis-acting elements for dehydration-responsive inductionTo narrow down the location of the 1.0-kb AtNCED3 promoter region, we used shorter promoter fragments for further analysis. Four promoter constructs fused to the GFP reporter gene were designed, named constructs C–F. We defined the region between -97 and +4 bp of the AtNCED3 promoter containing the TATA box as the minimum promoter of AtNCED3. Construct C contained the minimum promoter fused to GFP. In constructs D–F, a 0.5-kb region between the -3.0- and -2.5-kb promoter region, a 0.5-kb region between the -2.6- and -2.1-kb promoter region, and a 0.6-kb region between the -2.2- and -1.8-kb promoter region were fused to the minimum promoter and the GFP reporter, respectively (Fig. 3). These constructs were used to generate transgenic Arabidopsis plants, and T2 plants were used for further analysis. After subjecting plants to dehydration stress, the score index of induction of each plant was quantified. Among the four types of transgenic plant, the score index of construct E was significantly higher than that of the other constructs (Fig. 3). We also analysed the dehydration-responsive expression of endogenous AtNCED3, which revealed no significant change in any of the transgenic Arabidopsis plants. This indicates that the 0.5-kb region between the -2.6- and -2.1-kb promoter region contains important cis-acting elements involved in dehydration-responsive transcription.In the next step, the 0.5-kb region between the -2.6-and -2.1-kb regions of the AtNCED3 promoter was further analysed. We analysed the overlapping 340 bp region between the -2.6- and -2.26-kb promoter region (construct G, Fig. 4) and the 200 bp region between the -2.33- and -2.13-kb promoter region (construct H, Fig. 4), respectively. These promoter fragments were fused to the minimum promoter and GFP for the transgenic Arabidopsis plants. After subjecting the plants to dehydration stress (5 h), the score index was quantified for each transgenic line. The score was higher for construct H (150 ± 19) than for construct G (5 ± 2, Fig. 4). The promoter region between -2.33- and -2.13-kb was analysed using plant cis-acting regulatory DNA elements (PLACE).31 In the 0.2-kb promoter region, we found one sequence (CACGTG at -2248 bp) for the G-box-like motif, one Myb recognition motif (CTGTTA at -2227 bp), and one ABA-responsive element (ABRE)-like sequence (ACGTGTC at -2193 bp); these were named Box I, Box II, and Box III, respectively. In Fig. 4, these Box sequences are denoted by closed black circles, triangles, and squares, respectively. These Box sequences may be important for dehydration-induced AtNCED3 expression.3.4. Box I is important in the dehydration-responsive induction of AtNCED3To identify the important cis-acting elements in the 200 bp region between -2.33- and -2.13-kb of the AtNCED3 promoter, we introduced base substitutions into this region. The target regions were the Box I, Box II, and Box III sequences (Fig. 5A). When base substitutions were introduced into Box I (construct M1), the score index of induction was significantly reduced (35 ± 2) under dehydration conditions, whereas the score indices of base substitutions into Box II and Box III were not (constructs M2 and M3, Fig. 5B).In the next step, to analyse the importance of Box I in the dehydration-responsive induction of AtNCED3, we used the 3.0-kb promoter of AtNCED3 including the 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) as the transcription initiation site (Fig. 7). Mutated M4 and non-mutated NMT, constructed as described in the Materials and methods section, are denoted by closed white and black circles, respectively, in Fig. 6A. As described above, RNA gel blot analyses were conducted, and the expression patterns of GFP and AtNCED3 under non-stress and dehydration stress conditions were analysed by hybridization with 32P-labelled cDNA probes. As shown in Fig. 6B, the expression levels of endogenous AtNCED3 were increased by dehydration in all plants (lower blot membrane). GFP expression was not detected in non-transgenic plants or in vector controls (upper blot membrane). GFP in transgenic plants with the 3.0-kb native AtNCED3 pro::GFP construct was highly induced by dehydration (lanes 1–3, upper blot membrane, Fig. 6B), whereas the induction of GFP in transgenic plants with base-substituted (M4) Box I AtNCED3 pro::GFP was significantly reduced (lanes 4–6, upper blot membrane, Fig. 6B).Finally, the expression levels of GFP and AtNCED3 were analysed in transgenic Arabidopsis after 5-h dehydration treatment. The score index for the base substitution in Box I was significantly lower (7.6 ± 2; Supplementary Fig. S1) than that for the 3.0-kb non-mutated AtNCED3 promoter::GFP transgenic plants (191 ± 43, Fig. 2). These results reveal that the Box I element at the -2248 bp position in the 3.0-kb AtNCED3 promoter is important in the dehydration-responsive expression of AtNCED3.4. Discussion4.1. The promoter region of AtNCED3 is involved in dehydration-responsive transcriptionWe found that the 3.0-kb promoter region of AtNCED3 is induced by dehydration stress (Fig. 1), and that the expression is observed mainly in rosette leaf veins and vascular tissues and roots (Fig. 1B). Previous studies have shown that leaves are the main organ in which ABA is produced in response to dehydration or osmotic stress.32,33 Furthermore, Endo et al.34 examined the localization of AtNCED3, AtABA2, and AAO3 proteins in rosette leaves by immunohistochemical analysis and found that, after dehydration stress, these three enzymes were localized mainly in vascular parenchyma cells adjacent to xylem and phloem vessels. The expression profiles of the 3.0-kb AtNCED3 pro::GUS were similar to those of the AtNCED3 protein under water-deficit conditions (Fig. 1), which suggests that the 3.0-kb promoter region contains cis-regulatory elements that are involved in dehydration-responsive expression mainly in vascular tissues of leaves. As detailed above, a series of analyses revealed that a 200 bp region between -2.33- and -2.13-kb of the promoter seems to contain cis-acting elements involved in the dehydration-responsive induction of AtNCED3 (Fig. 5).In rice, a 2.0-kb OsNCECD3 promoter::GFP was induced in response to dehydration and salinity treatments,35 suggesting that the long 2.0-kb OsNCED3 promoter is also necessary for the dehydration-inducible expression in rice. However, the cis-acting element of the OsNCED3 promoter has not yet been identified. We analysed the 2.0-kb region of the OsNCED3 promoter sequence and found a distal G-box (CACGTG) between -1781 and -1776 bp region. However, there is no evidence whether this distal G-box is involved in dehydration-responsive transcription.Regulatory cis-acting elements localize within 1.0-kb regions of many stress-inducible promoters. However, the important regulatory region of the AtNCED3 promoter is located in a 200 bp region from -2.33- to -2.13-kb. Another example of far-upstream localization of regulatory cis-acting elements was reported by Maruyama-Nakashita et al.36, who found that the 16 bp sulphur-responsive element (SURE) is located within the -2777 and -2762 bp promoter region of the SULTR1;1 gene, encoding a high-affinity sulphate transporter. The SURE sequence contains an auxin response factor (ARF)-binding sequence (GAGACA or TGTCTC). Additionally, the presence of the SURE core sequence in S-minus-inducible genes was surveyed using in silico promoter analysis with GeneChip microarrays in Arabidopsis. Of 15 genes, 13 contained ARF-binding sequences in their 3.0-kb regions.Additionally, genomic alignment analysis of the 3.0-kb NCED promoter area (upstream of the start codon) in various species including: Arabiopsis lyrata, Poplus trichocarpa, Vitis Vinifera, Zea mays, Oryza sativa, Brachypodium disyachyon, Sorgum bicolor, and Volvox carteri, resulted in the identification of a G-Box-like cis-acting element at -2.0-kb from the transcription initiation site of NCED3 (http://www.phytozome.net). We found a conserved region around the Box I-like sequence in the AtNCED3 promoter of A. lyrata. This observation also supports the importance of the G-Box in the Box I region (data not shown).4.2. Cis-acting elements that function in the dehydration-responsive induction of the AtNCED3 promoterThe 200 bp region between -2.33- and -2.13-kb of the AtNCED3 promoter contains the G-Box (Box I: CACGTG at -2248 bp), an Myb recognition site (Box II: CTGTTA at -2227 bp), and one ABRE motif (Box III: ACGTGTC at -2193 bp; Fig. 5). A series of analyses, as detailed above, indicated the importance of the G-Box-like element in the Box I region in the dehydration-responsive induction of AtNCED3. More specifically, we found that the G-box at -2248 bp from the initiation codon is an important cis-acting element for induction. This motif may activate the AtNCED3 promoter in response to water-deficit stimuli, because base substitutions of this element had negative effects on dehydration-responsive expression (Figs 6 and 7). We think that the tissue-specific expression in leaf vascular tissues and roots of the 3.0-kb AtNCED3 pro::GUS is mainly regulated by the G-box element (Fig. 1). In Fig. 5, the base substitution in the G-box (M1) in the 3.0-kb promoter caused a significant reduction in the expression of the GFP reporter gene under dehydration conditions, which suggests the important role of the G-box in tissue-specific expression under dehydration conditions, too.Recently, an E2F-like element (TTTGCCCC) was reported to function in the differential expression of the LfNCED3 gene in ABA-mediated heterophylly induction in Lilium formosanum, but not in the LoNCED3 promoter of Lilium oriental.37 The Arabidopsis AtNCED3 gene does not contain the E2F-like element in its promoter. Moreover, heterophylly is not induced by ABA in Arabidopsis. Therefore, the E2F-like element seems not to be involved in the ABA-induced expression of AtNCED3.We found that the observed G-box-like motifs are slightly different from those in the Box I region (Fig. 7). However, they do not seem to be important based on deletion analyses (Figs 2–5). A similar observation was reported in the SULTR1;1 promoter, in which ARF cis-acting elements located at -2777 and -2762 bp were important for the induction of SULTR1;1 by sulphur deficiency.31,36 There are ARF or ARF-like cis-acting elements in promoter regions other than the -2777- and -2762 bp regions that are not important for the induction due to sulphur deficiency.4.3. Possible transcription factors involved in the dehydration-induced expression of the AtNCED3 promoterIt is important to determine the transcription factors involved in the transactivation of the AtNCED3 promoter. The Box I contains a typical G-box (CACGTG) and its overlapping CANNTG, a typical basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) recognition sequence. The G-box is recognized and regulated by well-characterized bZIP proteins such as G-binding factors (GBFs) which regulate various cellular processes and environmental responses both positively and negatively.38 GBF and its family proteins are good candidates of the transcription factor that controls the dehydration-responsive induction of AtNCED3. The bHLH family proteins also function in abiotic stress responses. There is another possibility of the candidate transcription factor as bHLH family protein(s).We are currently attempting to isolate DNA-binding proteins that specifically interact with the G-box recognition sequence in the Box I, using the yeast one-hybrid screening method. Additionally, we are screening Arabidopsis mutant lines and cDNA overexpressing lines of transcription factor genes for the regulation of ABA levels under dehydration stress conditions to find candidate genes involved in the upstream process of ABA synthesis.5. ConclusionWe identified a G-box element involved in the induction of AtNCED3 in response to dehydration stress. This cis-acting element is located -2248 bp from the AtNCED3 transcriptional initiation site. There is a high probability that G-box binding factors may recognize cis-elements and induce AtNCED3 gene expression during dehydration stress. Further analysis of these transcription factors will extend our knowledge of the molecular processes involved in plant responses to water deficit.Supplementary dataSupplementary Data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported in part by the Program for Promotion of Basic and Applied Researches for Innovations in Bio-oriented Industry of Japan and in part by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Priority Areas from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology of Japan and RIKEN.We thank Ms Fumie Mori, Ms Setsuko Kawamura, Ms Hiroko Kobayashi, and Ms Saho Mizukado for their excellent technical assistance.Supplementary data"

IntroductionGenome-wide mapping of the in vivo DNA-binding sites of transcription factors or other DNA-binding proteins either by Chromatin Immunoprecipitation coupled with microarray (ChIP-chip)1 or by the recently developed ChIP coupled with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) method have become widely used techniques in protein–DNA interaction research.2–5 The resolution of the DNA-binding sites determined by ChIP-seq was a dramatic improvement on the resolution that was possible using ChIP-chip, because of the higher resolution of high-throughput sequencing compared with oligonucleotide arrays. However, for both techniques, the DNA fragments, co-purified with the target protein (ChIP-DNA), are generated by sonication and generally fall within the size range of 100–500 bp. These sonicated fragments are often much longer than the actual protein-binding site and, thus, the sequence tags of the ChIP-DNA distribute in broad regions around the actual binding sites. In addition, as only the terminal sequences of ChIP-DNA fragments can be obtained by high-throughput sequencing, piled ChIP-seq tags on the forward (+) and reverse (-) strands usually show bimodal peaks.6,7 To overcome these problems and determine the actual protein-binding sites to within a few 10 bp, algorithms for the processing of ChIP-seq data have been proposed, although the results obtained by them are still predictive.6–9 Thus, more precise experimental mapping methods are required to determine the exact binding sites of DNA-binding proteins using ChIP-seq technology.Recently, the ChIP-exo method, which trims the 5'-region of the protein-unbound region of ChIP-DNA by the use of 5'–3' lambda (<U+03BB>) exonuclease, has been developed, and this method demonstrated an improvement in resolution in determining the DNA-binding sites of target eukaryotic proteins through the determination of the edge positions of protein-bound genomic sequences.10 In contrast to DNA exonucleases, DNase I preferentially cleaves endogenous DNA regions that are not protected by bound proteins and, thus, has been employed for in vitro footprinting to precisely determine the DNA-binding sites of DNA-binding proteins.11 Using DNase I digestion, Vora et al.12 proposed a method, designated in vivo protein occupancy display (IPOD), which visualizes the in vivo binding profile of total DNA-binding proteins on genomic DNA.12 In this method, genomic DNA cross-linked with total proteins and extracted from formaldehyde-treated cells was digested with DNase I, and the DNase I-resistant DNA fragments were purified by phenol extraction and mapped using a tiling array.We report here a novel method designated as Genome Footprinting by high-throughput sequencing (GeF-seq; in vivo GeF-seq). This method combines in situ DNase I digestion of bacterial genomic DNA with a modified ChIP-chip method (ChAP-chip, Chromatin Affinity Precipitation-chip) we previously developed.13 Unlike IPOD, GeF-seq can visualize the binding profile of a specific target protein at a resolution seen at the in vitro footprinting level. We evaluated the resolution achieved using the GeF-seq method by examining the binding profile of the Bacillus subtilis transition state regulator, AbrB, in comparison with results obtained by ChAP-chip and a modified ChIP-seq method (ChAP coupled with high-throughput sequencing) utilizing sonication to fragment the genomic DNA. AbrB represses the expression of many genes during exponential growth, and we have demonstrated using ChAP-chip that AbrB binds to hundreds of sites throughout the entire B. subtilis genome during exponential growth.14 AbrB is a small protein (10.4 kDa), having a unique structure. The N-terminal domains of two AbrB molecules form a single DNA-binding domain, and AbrB forms a tetramer having a stable DNA-binding ability, via both N-terminal and C-terminal interactions. Structural modelling of AbrB bound to the target sequence indicated that the AbrB tetramer would interact with ~20 bp sequences,15 whereas in vitro footprinting studies detected a wider range of binding regions from 25 to 80 bp, suggesting that a higher order structure of the AbrB tetramer may be involved in DNA binding at some sites on the chromosome.16–18 We previously proposed that AbrB binds to bipartite TGGNA motifs based on the in vivo AbrB-binding regions determined by ChAP-chip analysis,14 which is in accordance with a motif identified by the in vitro SELEX method.17 However, the consensus sequence was detected in a small number of AbrB-binding regions, and the consensus DNA-binding sequence for AbrB is not completely understood at present.We demonstrate here that, by mapping the sequences of short DNA fragments co-purified with AbrB after in situ DNase I digestion of the genomic DNA, the AbrB-binding profile could be visualized with a resolution comparable with that of in vitro footprinting. Importantly, the BiPad web server for modelling bipartite sequence elements19 automatically detected consensus sequences for AbrB binding in >95% of the experimentally determined binding sites. Moreover, highly accurate DNA-binding site information obtained by GeF-seq enabled us to obtain a comprehensive view of the correlation between AbrB-binding signals and cognate recognition sequences; AbrB not only binds to bipartite motifs in sequences with high binding signals, but also to single-sequence motifs in sequences with low signals. These results demonstrate the usefulness of the GeF-seq method.2. Materials and methods2.1. Bacterial strainBacillus subtilis strain OC001 expressing C-terminal 2HC (12 histidines plus a chitin-binding domain)-tagged AbrB (AbrB-2HC) was used throughout.142.2. ChAP-chip and ChAP-seqChAP-chip data for AbrB binding on the B. subtilis genome were taken from our previous report.14 DNA fragments for ChAP-seq analysis were prepared, as previously described.13,14 Construction of the DNA library for Illumina sequencing was as described below except for the size of the DNA fragments used: ~250 bp fragments, corresponding to ~150 bp DNA fragments isolated by ChAP without adapter sequences, were selected for PCR enrichment.2.3. In situ DNase I digestion of genomic DNAThe GeF-seq method is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1A. To cross-link protein–DNA complexes, 400 ml of OC001 (abrB-2HC) cells grown to the exponential phase in Luria-Bertani medium at 37°C were treated with formaldehyde as previously described.14 To hydrolyze the cell wall without osmotic burst, cells were treated with 5 mg/ml lysozyme in 3 ml of isotonic sucrose-malate-magnesium buffer (0.02 M maleic acid, 0.5 M sucrose, and 0.02 M MgCl2, pH 6.5 adjusted with NaOH)20 in the presence of 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). After 20-min incubation at 37°C with mixing, cells were collected by centrifugation at 6000 g for 5 min at 4°C. Cells were resuspended in 0.5 ml of a buffer containing 0.1 M Tris–HCl (pH 7.5), 0.2 M NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.1% (w/v) Na-deoxycholate, 0.2% (w/v) Brij 58, and 20% (v/v) glycerol.

The size of DNA fragments digested by various concentrations of DNase I (1, 0.6, 0.4, and 0.2 U/ml, Lanes 3–6, respectively) and analysed by gel electrophoresis. DNA fragments generated by sonication are run alongside the DNase I digested DNA for comparison purposes (Lane 2).(A) Schematic workflow for GeF-seq (see Materials and methods for detail). For comparison purposes, the ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq methods are also illustrated. (B) In situ DNase I digestion. The size of DNA fragments digested by various concentrations of DNase I (1, 0.6, 0.4, and 0.2 U/ml, Lanes 3–6, respectively) and analysed by gel electrophoresis. DNA fragments generated by sonication are run alongside the DNase I digested DNA for comparison purposes (Lane 2).To determine suitable conditions for in situ DNase I digestion of genomic DNA, four samples of OC001 cells were prepared as described above and mixed with 10 µl of RNase A (10 mg/ml) and 50 µl of a solution containing 100 mM MgCl2 and 50 mM CaCl2. DNase I digestion was started with the addition of 0.5, 0.3, 0.2, and 0.1 units (U) of DNase I (corresponding to a final concentration of 1, 0.6, 0.4, and 0.2 U/ml) (Takara) and incubated at 37°C with shaking (230 rpm) for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by urea denaturation upon the addition of 3 ml of urea-Triton buffer [0.1 M 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (pH 7.5), 0.01 M imidazole, 8 M urea, 0.5 M NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mM ß-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mM PMSF] instead of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, which severely inhibits protein purification by Dynabeads TALON (invitrogen). The samples were then sonicated on ice using an Astrason Ultrasonic Processor XL (Misonix) for 10 min (4 s ‘on’ and 10 s ‘off’, at output level 5). After centrifugation to remove cell debris, 30 µl of the supernatant was mixed with 70 µl of M-wash buffer (0.1 M Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.01 M dithiothreitol) and incubated at 65°C overnight to reverse the cross-linking. After the removal of proteins by phenol–chloroform–isoamyl alcohol treatment, DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation in the presence of glycogen, resuspended in 50 µl of nuclease-free water and run on a 2% agarose gel (Fig. 1B). Treatment with 0.5 units of DNase I (1 U/ml) generated DNA fragments <100 bp in size, and incubation with higher amounts of DNase I resulted in a decrease in the amount of DNA detected by agarose gel electrophoresis (data not shown). Thus, we selected 0.5 units (1 U/ml) of DNase I for further analysis.2.4. Affinity purification of DNA fragments bound to AbrBAbrB–DNA complexes were affinity-purified from the clarified DNase I-treated cell lysate, using Dynabeads TALON as described previously,13,14 but with the following modification: after protein–DNA complexes were purified and reverse cross-linked by heat treatment at 65°C overnight, proteins were removed using two phenol–chloroform–isoamyl alcohol extractions, and DNA fragments were recovered by ethanol precipitation in the presence of glycogen.2.5. Sequencing of DNA fragments co-purified with AbrBThe DNA library for sequencing by the Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (GAIIx) was generated using the NEB Next DNA Sample Prep Reagent kit (New England BioLabs) according to manufacturer's instructions for ‘Preparing Samples for Sequencing Genomic DNA’ (Illumina) with the following modification; after ligation of the adapters to the DNA fragments, the ligated product was run on a 2% [Tris-acetate-EDTA (TAE)] low-range agarose gel (Biorad) at 50 V for 2.5 h in TAE buffer and the region of the gel ~150 bp (although the DNA was not visible on the gel), corresponding to ~50 bp fragments without adapter sequences, was excised. The DNA fragments were then purified using a QIAquick Gel Extraction kit (Qaigen) and amplified using 14 cycles of PCR, to obtain at least 1 fmol of DNA library. The amount of DNA was determined by an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer using the High-Sensitivity DNA Kit (Agilent). The sequence of the library was then determined by 75-bp single-ended sequencing using the Illumina GAIIx sequencer according to the manufacturer's instructions.2.6. Mapping of read sequences and normalization of tag countsA total of 10 369 855 read sequences obtained from the Illumina GAIIx were mapped on the reference genome (B. subtilis str. 168, NC_000964.3), and the mapping results were visualized using the mpsmap and psmap softwares (http://metalmine.naist.jp/maps/gefseq), respectively.21 Because DNA fragments of ~50 bp (without adapter sequences for PCR amplification) were selected in the sample preparation process to obtain complete sequences of the ChAP-DNA fragments, most of the reads reached into the adapter sequence attached to the 3'-end of ChAP-DNA. Thus, unlike general Illumina™ sequencing results obtained by following the instruction manual, most of the read sequences consisted of ~50 bp of ChAP-DNA sequence followed by the adapter sequence, and both of these sequences varied in length. Since mapping of such different lengths of sequence containing the unmappable adapter sequence was not possible using a standard sequence mapping/assembly program, we utilized the property of mpsmap that maps different length sequences to the best chromosomal location, while allowing up to a specified number of mismatches without a gap. In this study, the read sequences were initially mapped allowing a maximum of 35 mismatches, and the adapter sequences were finally removed. As a result of the first mapping, 9 685 519 (93%) of the read sequences were uniquely mapped to the reference genome. (Thus, the genomic regions encoding the 10 rRNA operons were not included in the present analysis.) Then, to remove the adapter sequences, the starting positions were assigned to seven or more bases allowing a two-base mismatch matched with 5'-end of the primer sequence (AGATCGGAAGAGCTCGTATGCCGTCTTCTGCTTGA) in the 3'-region of the read sequences. In addition, mapped sequences (without adapter sequences) with >2 bp mismatches against the reference sequence were removed, and 8 571 055 (83%) of the read sequences remained for further analysis. Finally, in order to normalize the difference in the local copy number of genomic DNA, counts of mapped reads at each nucleotide position along the genome sequence were linearly scaled by using the oriC/terC ratio (5.15), estimated by sequencing and mapping of whole genomic DNA fragments digested by DNase I, to define the AbrB-binding signals (Supplementary Fig. S1).Results shown in Supplementary Fig. S1 suggested that there was preferential digestion of AT-rich genomic sequences by DNase I. However, mapping results of the distribution of ChAP-DNA sequences suggested that the preferentiality apparently did not affect the quantitative estimation of the AbrB-binding profile (Supplementary Fig. S2).2.7. Detection of protein-binding regionsMost of the read sequences were mapped on distinct regions along the genome surrounded by regions where ends of the read sequences accumulated (Fig. 3C). We used this feature to define the AbrB-binding sites. To estimate the end points of the genomic sequences in the read sequences more precisely, we reanalysed them so that adapter sequences at the 3'-ends of the sequences could be subtracted from the genomic DNA they had been attached to during generation of the library for sequencing. We assigned sequences as ‘adapter sequences’ when five bases at the 3'-end of the read sequence were identical to the adapter primer sequence and the following sequences matched to the primer sequence with no more than two bases mismatched. The accumulation profile of the 3'-ends thus determined across the genome sequence was similar to that of 5'-ends, which was defined as the first base of the read sequences (Supplementary Fig. S3), strongly suggesting that the procedure to estimate the 3'-ends of read sequences was reliable.Then, the left ends of the read sequences relative to the reference genome sequence were defined as a sum of the 5'-ends of read sequences mapped on the plus strand and the 3'-ends of read sequences mapped on the minus strand, whereas the right ends were defined as a sum of the 3'-ends of read sequences mapped on the plus strand and the 5'-ends of read sequences mapped on the minus strand (Supplementary Fig. S3). We counted the numbers of left and right ends mapped to each nucleotide, and positions with =10 ends of read sequences and with the highest number of ends within ±30 bp windows were determined in 1 bp steps, as candidates for the left and the right boundaries of the DNA-binding sequences. Then, we extracted regions surrounded by a pair of possible left and right boundaries positioned within a range from 25 to 80 bp (considering the in vitro AbrB footprinting results), and regions, where AbrB-binding signal intensities exceeded a threshold value at more than half of the nucleotides between them, were extracted as AbrB-binding sites. In this study, we first extracted AbrB-binding sequences using the signal intensity corresponding to the top 10th percentile of all nucleotides across the genome as the threshold (Supplementary Fig. S4). At some regions, different combinations of boundaries surrounding the overlapping sequences satisfied the criteria. In such cases, the innermost sequences were selected as AbrB-binding sequences for further analysis. Finally, the average of the AbrB-binding signals within the individual binding sequence was calculated, as the AbrB-binding signal intensities of each binding site.2.8. Motif analysisAbrB-binding DNA motifs were analysed by the BiPad web server (http://bipad.cmh.edu) for modelling bipartite sequence elements.19 The BiPad program performs multiple local alignment by entropy minimization and cyclic refinement using a stochastic greedy search strategy, and we used the following settings: left half-site, gap range lengths, right half-site, and the iteration cycles were set to 9, 0 or 1, 9, and 500, respectively. To examine the possibility of whether the AbrB-binding motif was discovered by chance, we selected three sets of data, each of which consists of 300 50 bp sequences randomly selected from the B. subtilis 168 genome sequence by the RSA tool,22 and analysed by Bipad.2.9. Sequencing dataSequencing data in this study have been submitted to the DDBJ Sequence Read Archive (DRA) and the BioProject database under accession code DRA000758 and PRJDB675, respectively.3. Results3.1. In vivo GeF-seqTo improve the resolution of protein-binding site determination by ChIP-seq or ChAP-seq methodologies, we attempted in situ DNase I digestion of the cross-linked bacterial nucleoid to restrict the size of DNA fragments co-purified with the target protein to directly interacting sequences (Fig. 1A). We employed B. subtilis AbrB as a model protein, whose binding sites were recently determined by use of the ChAP-chip method to be >600 sites scattered across the genome.14 Exponentially growing B. subtilis OC001 cells expressing C-terminal 2HC (12 histidines plus a chitin-binding domain)-tagged AbrB (AbrB-2HC) were treated with formaldehyde to stabilize the protein–DNA interactions by cross-linking, and the collected cells were treated with lysozyme in isotonic buffer to facilitate an efficient penetration of DNase I into cells. Then, the genomic DNA was fragmented to <100 bp by the DNase I treatment, followed by the affinity purification of the cross-linked AbrB–DNA complexes using cobalt-coated magnetic beads. DNA fragments co-purified with AbrB (ChAP-DNA) were isolated after reversing the cross-linking between proteins and DNA. As we intended to obtain whole sequences of ChAP-DNA to avoid the bimodal distribution of sequence tags, DNA fragments containing ~50 bp of inserted DNA, after ligation of adapter sequences, were selected to prepare the library for high-throughput sequencing by Illumina GAIIx. It has been demonstrated that AbrB interacts with ~20 bp sequences15 and, thus, we also expected that 50 bp fragments would be enough to cover single AbrB-binding sites. Single-ended 75-bp sequencing by the Illumina GAIIx generated 9 685 519 (uniquely mapped) sequence reads. As expected, most of the read sequences (88.5%) contained the adapter sequences for PCR amplification at the 3'-end portion, with an average insert size of 50 bp after removal of them (Supplementary Fig. S5), and insert sequences were mapped on distinct sites on the B. subtilis genome. Then, counts of the mapped reads at each nucleotide position along the genome were normalized for differences in the local copy number of genomic DNA, to define the AbrB-binding signals.3.2. Comparison of the distribution of AbrB-binding signals determined by GeF-seq, ChAP-seq, and ChAP-chipTo evaluate the resolution of the GeF-seq method in identifying genomic protein-binding sites, we initially compared the distributions of AbrB-binding signals along the genome as determined by three methods: GeF-seq, ChAP-seq, and ChAP-chip. The distributions of the AbrB-binding signals on the genome determined by GeF-seq and ChAP-seq in the present study were highly consistent with that of ChAP-chip we reported previously.14 Typical examples of the comparison are presented in Fig. 2, and the complete profiles of the binding signals across the genome obtained by the three methods are available in Supplementary Fig. S2. Close-up views of profiles of AbrB-binding signals (Fig. 3A and B) indicated that, although the ChAP-seq method improved the resolution of detection of the binding regions compared with ChAP-chip, the GeF-seq method dramatically improved the resolution even when compared with ChAP-seq. Importantly, GeF-seq could resolve the closely positioned binding sites that appear as one peak in the ChAP-seq method, as shown in Fig. 3A.

The top, middle, and bottom lines indicate binding intensities of 7, 0.4, and 0, respectively, as defined by the previous report.14 For ChAP-seq and GeF-seq, protein-binding intensities (number of reads after normalization of the local copy number of the genomic DNA) are presented as a sum of binding intensities on the plus and - strands. The top lines in both the ChAP-seq and GeF-seq columns indicate binding intensities of 15 000 and 25 000, respectively, and the bottom lines indicate binding intensities of 0.

The AbrB-binding region, which was previously determined by in vitro footprinting,18 is also shown by green boxes in (A) and (B) and red letters in the DNA sequence on the top in (C).Using ChAP-seq, binding sites were often detected as two broad peaks on the forward (+) and reverse (-) strands, as previously reported.6 In contrast, using GeF-seq, the distributions of sequence tags on the plus and - strands overlapped in the middle of the two ChAP-seq peaks (Fig. 3B). Thus, the use of short DNA fragments enabled the conclusive determination of protein-bound regions of DNA without the necessity for the bioinformatic prediction of the binding sites. In addition, AbrB-binding signals at each binding site generally distributed in a trapezoid form, and the ends of the read sequences accumulated at the left and right edges (Fig. 3C). These observations strongly suggested that in situ DNase I digestion occurred at the boundaries of protein-binding sites, as observed in in vitro DNase I footprinting. Furthermore, the lengths of sequences protected from DNase I digestion (27–80 bp) suggested that these sequences would be interacting with one to three AbrB tetramer(s). We used this feature to define AbrB-binding sequences, as described below.3.3. Determination of AbrB-binding sequencesTo automatically extract DNA sequences bound by AbrB from the GeF-seq results, we developed an analytical pipeline as described in Materials and methods. Briefly, we first surveyed pairs of nucleotide positions showing the highest accumulation of ends of read sequences, as candidates for the borders of the protein-binding regions. Then, AbrB-binding signals between them were evaluated using a relaxed threshold value, corresponding to the signal intensity at the top 10th percentile of all nucleotide positions across the genome (Supplementary Fig. S4). This resulted in 5897 possible AbrB-binding sites being detected (Supplementary Table S2), which included not only specific, but also non-specific AbrB-binding, sites. These were extracted and ranked by their average binding signal intensities of nucleotides included in each site. The peak ID was given from 1 to 5897 by their intensity ranked from high to low, respectively.The top 700 binding sites accompanied by high-binding signal intensities were first examined, because this number was approximately similar to that obtained by previous ChAP-chip analysis (694 binding sites).14 The length of the AbrB-binding regions determined by the GeF-seq ranged from 27 to 79 bp (Supplementary Fig. S6), which was consistent with the results of in vitro footprinting experiments listed in a database of transcriptional regulation in B. subtilis23 and in recent reports.17,18,24 Among 32 AbrB-binding sites previously determined by in vitro DNase I footprinting, our GeF-seq experiment detected 11 AbrB-binding sequences (Fig. 3C and Supplementary Table S1). GeF-seq also detected 10 AbrB-binding sequences within the 5897 possible AbrB-binding sites, although binding intensities were lower than those of the top 700 binding sites (Supplementary Table S1). Thus, we found that these 21 binding sites matched those obtained by in vitro DNase I footprinting. These results indicate that our GeF-seq method has the ability to detect protein-bound DNA sequences with a resolution comparable with that of the in vitro footprinting method, although differences in boundaries are observed between our GeF-seq result and the in vitro footprinting result, which may result from differences in conditions between in vivo and in vitro experiments.3.4. Identification of consensus sequences for the AbrB bindingIn previous ChAP-chip analysis,14 we found a possible consensus sequence for AbrB binding to be TNCCA–4 bp–TGGNA, which is composed of a pair of two AbrB-binding motifs previously identified by the in vitro SELEX method.17 However, those motifs were detected in a limited number of AbrB-bound sequences. In addition, we found that not only TNCCA–4 bp–TGGNA, but also other bipartite TGGNA motifs, in palindromic or tandem orientation, separated by 4–5 bp were enriched in AbrB-bound DNA sequences on the B. subtilis genome.In the present GeF-seq analysis, the lengths of automatically extracted AbrB-binding sequences were restricted to an in vitro DNase I footprinting level. Thus, we expected that the large amount of precise information on AbrB-binding sequences might give us a clear view on the consensus AbrB-binding sequence. We then utilized the BiPad web server, a web interface to predict sequence elements embedded within unaligned sequences, to analyse the experimentally derived AbrB-binding sequences. BiPad predicts various pairs of bipartite motifs with different gaps in different orientations as one consensus sequence.19 BiPad successfully identified a mixture of bipartite TGGNA motifs in 96% (678) of the 700 experimentally identified sequences (Fig. 4A), and we found that we could classify them into six patterns by manually sorting the predicted consensus in each AbrB-binding sequence (Fig. 4B and Supplementary Table S3). As a result, consensus sequences were found to be composed of bipartite TGGNA motifs separated by 4 or 5 bp AT-rich sequences arranged in direct, reverse direct, inverted, and everted repeat orientations (Fig. 4B). Importantly, the location of the consensus sequence was usually close to the middle of the experimentally identified binding sequences (Fig. 4C). Thus, we not only confirmed that the AbrB-binding consensus sequence we proposed previously was indeed detectable in almost all of the AbrB-binding sequences with high binding signals, but we also demonstrated that the information on the protein-binding sequences automatically extracted by the GeF-seq analysis enabled us to clearly identify a consensus sequence for protein binding, at least in the case of AbrB.

The binding sequences were sorted by length, and the motifs identified by Bipad were marked red.It should be also noted that any clear consensus sequence was not detected in the remaining 22 sequences, although a degenerate single TGGNA motif was detected (data not shown). Since AbrB binding to these sequences was clearly detected with high signal intensity (Supplementary Fig. S2 and Supplementary Table S2), this result indicates that AbrB also binds to sequences without bipartite motifs by some mechanism, for example, when the DNA sequence forms structure(s) to fit the AbrB-binding surface.3.5. Correlation between AbrB-binding signals and motif discoveryHere, using 700 AbrB-binding DNA sequences with high GeF-seq AbrB-binding signals, we identified bipartite AbrB-binding motifs across the Bacillus genome arranged in any orientation with a 4- or 5-bp spacing, which is consistent with our previous ChAP-chip analysis14 and the in vitro SELEX results reported by Xu and Strauch.17 These results strongly suggested that, when binding signal intensities are high, the sequences are those specifically recognized by AbrB. We usually use a threshold value to discriminate ‘real’ protein-binding peaks and possible ‘artificial’ binding peaks in ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq experiments. However, actually, these threshold values have been operationally defined by researchers; for example, aiming to remove false positives or to remove false negatives, and examination of actual protein binding to extract possible binding sequences has rarely been examined thoroughly. The finding that we could identify AbrB-binding consensus sequences in almost all of the binding sequences accompanied with high binding signals in GeF-seq prompted us to comprehensively examine whether there was conservation of the binding motifs in sequences with lower binding signals.To this end, we divided the 5897 possible AbrB-binding sequences into 20 sets each containing 300 sequences, according to average AbrB-binding signal intensities (Supplementary Table S2 and Supplementary Fig. S4C), and the consensus sequence for each set was extracted by the Bipad program (Fig. 5). In the three datasets with the top AbrB-binding signal intensities (1–300, 301–600, and 601–900), the bipartite TGGNA motifs with a 4- or 5-bp spacer sequence were detected in almost all sequences (98, 96, and 96% respectively, Fig. 5). In the next group of datasets with lower binding signal intensities (901–1200, 1201–1500, and 1501–1800), although the consensus sequences containing bipartite TGGNA motifs with a 4- or 5-bp spacer sequence could be detected, one half-site became degenerate. Interestingly, in the following 10 sets (from 1801 to 4800), only a single TGGNA motif was detected, whereas, in the remaining four sets with the lowest binding signal intensities (from 4801 to 5897, Fig. 5), the single motif becomes very degenerate. We confirmed that the TGGNA motif was not detected by chance because no motif was detected in similar sets of DNA sequences (300 50-bp sequences) that were randomly extracted from the genome sequence of B. subtilis 168 (data not shown). These results strongly suggested that AbrB not only binds stably, with high experimentally derived binding signals, to bipartite TGGNA motifs, but also interacts with single TGGNA motifs in sequences with lower but significant experimentally derived signal intensities (Supplementary Fig. S4). Consensus sequences of the AbrB-binding sequences detected in the top 10th percentile threshold. Each group of 300 signals in the 20 sets of AbrB-binding sequences were ranked from high to low by binding intensities and were analysed by Bipad to detect respective consensus sequences. The number of sequences containing the motif is shown in parallel.Consensus sequences of the AbrB-binding sequences detected in the top 10th percentile threshold.

The number of sequences containing the motif is shown in parallel.4. DiscussionWe demonstrate here that, by mapping the sequences of ~50 bp fragments co-purified with AbrB after in situ DNase I digestion of genomic DNA, in vivo AbrB-binding sites could be determined with a resolution comparable with that of in vitro footprinting. Furthermore, comprehensive and precise information on the DNA sequences that AbrB binds gave us a clear view of AbrB binding on the B. subtilis genome—it would stably bind to bipartite TGGNA motifs, but it also interacted with many single TGGNA motifs on the genome.In vitro DNase I footprinting has currently been one of the most widely used methods to determine at high resolution the precise DNA sequences bound by transcription factors and other DNA-binding proteins. However, this method is laborious and can be performed against only a few DNA sequence targets in one experiment. In addition, the synthetic conditions under which DNase I foorprinting assays have been conducted risks leading to artifactual results for several reasons, e.g. the use of purified proteins that are not modified as would occur in vivo and may not work in the same way, the low-ionic strength of solutions used in in vitro footprinting experiments that may allow non-specific DNA–protein interactions, the use of short DNA sequences that may lack the secondary structure of DNA found in vivo, experiments conducted at non-physiological temperatures, and the absence of essential effectors, which may impair the specific binding of the protein to the corresponding DNA sequence. In contrast, in the GeF-seq method, DNA–protein interactions in the nucleoid are stabilized in the living cells by formaldehyde treatment, and then DNA digestion is carried out in situ to retain the native DNA-binding state of the target protein. Thus, the GeF-seq method identifies the actual DNA-binding sequences of target proteins across the whole genome simultaneously, with minimal risk of artefacts, and at high resolution, which is comparable with that of in vitro footprinting. In analysing the resolution of the method, we confirmed that 21 AbrB-binding regions we found using GeF-seq were consistent with in vitro footprinting results that have been reported previously (Supplementary Table S1). It should also be noted that some AbrB-binding sites previously detected by in vitro footprinting (Supplementary Table S1) were not detected using GeF-seq. Although it is possible that such regions might be occupied by AbrB under some specific conditions, AbrB binding to these DNA sequences may occur only in in vitro experimental conditions.Here, we detected not only bipartite TGGNA motifs in probable high-affinity AbrB-binding sites, but also single TGGNA motifs in possible low-affinity AbrB-binding sites, that would be generally ignored as non-specific, using the binding-site prediction software. Such low-affinity AbrB binding may not be biologically important, but it is possible that those binding sites may have a role to concentrate AbrB molecules on the nucleoid to increase the chance of finding high-affinity binding sites, which are directly involved in gene regulation.25 We usually use a threshold value to discriminate ‘real’ protein-binding peaks on the genome and possible ‘artificial’ binding peaks in ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq experiments. However, our results clearly demonstrated that the use of threshold values could discard important information. Our results suggest that comprehensive and precise information on protein-binding sequences obtained by GeF-seq analysis, in combination with the identification of consensus sequences in them, would give us a clear and comprehensive view of protein binding on the genome.Specifically, we clearly demonstrate here that the consensus sequence for the high-affinity AbrB binding is comprised of bipartite TGGNA motifs gapped by a 4- or 5-bp AT-rich sequence arranged in direct, reverse direct, inverted, and everted repeat orientations. This result is consistent with a previous in vitro SELEX study,17 and our informatics analysis showing that various bipartite motifs are enriched in AbrB-binding regions determined by ChIP-chip.14 Thus, the GeF-seq results reported here show, for the first time, the highly flexible proposed consensus sequences, which are actually recognized by AbrB molecules in in vivo. Previous structural modelling of AbrB bound to the target DNA sequence indicated that the AbrB tetramer would interact with ~20 bp sequences,15 whereas in vitro footprinting studies detected a wider range of binding regions from 25 to 80 bp. In this study, GeF-seq also detected a similar range of AbrB-binding regions from 27 to 80 bp in size. When the positions of the bipartite motifs within the binding sequences are depicted, the motifs are usually located in the middle of the binding sequences, but some are not centrally located in the long binding sequences (Fig. 4C, Supplementary Table S3). Interestingly, we observed that the binding region is generally composed of multiple TGGNA motifs almost covering the full length of the sequenced region (data not shown), suggesting that higher oligomers of AbrB may interact with multiple TGGNA motifs.Here, we have demonstrated that GeF-seq is a powerful tool for helping to understand the in vivo distribution of DNA-binding proteins on the genome. However, several issues remain to be explored, in order to fully establish the GeF-seq method. (i) We have not yet examined how DNase I digestion conditions would affect the results, although the results shown in Supplementary Figs S1 and S2 suggest that the GeF-seq results would be robust against changes in DNase I digestion conditions. (ii) We empirically selected criteria to map read sequences and to define protein-binding sites on the genome. Further improvements in the sequence data processing algorithms are desirable to automate this process. (iii) The Bipad program outputs one consensus sequence for each input sequence, and a method to identify multiple motifs in each sequence is desirable. (iv) GeF-seq data suggest that protein-binding signal intensities to the genome should correlate with protein-binding affinities to the cognate target sequences, but this needs to be shown experimentally. (v) GeF-seq has successfully determined protein-binding sites across a bacterial genome, but examination of whether this method is applicable for much larger genomes of higher organisms is necessary.Supplementary dataSupplementary Data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work has been supported by the Advanced Low Carbon Technology Research and Development Program (ALCA) of the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) and a UK Royal Society International Joint Project to T.O. and J.L.H.

IntroductionWith the new generation of sequencing (NGS) technologies, bacterial and archeal genome projects now combine deep genomic sequencing with a variety of transcriptome libraries.1–4 If the main motivation for transcriptome sequencing is usually the quantification of gene expression, the transcribed sequences generated by deep sequencing can also contribute to prokaryotic genome annotation by the elucidation of gene structural features, including transcription start sites (TSSs), 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) and the identification of non-coding RNA (ncRNA) genes. The quantification of gene expression following deep cDNA sequencing is based on the number of reads that map to a given gene. Therefore, the development of genome annotation tools that enable a better delineation of transcripts should lead to a more reliable expression measurement. In the recent sequencing of bacterial and archeal genomes, the annotation has still been done manually owing to the lack of appropriate tools to integrate RNA-Seq data.5 Indeed, most existing prokaryotic gene finders6–9 or high-level bacterial annotation systems10,11 are based on genomic sequence analysis and cannot take into account available expression data in the structural prediction. Expert annotation using RNA-Seq data has been recently facilitated by the use of integrated tools, such as VESPA12 or MicroScope,13 which allow to simultaneously visualize genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic or syntenic data, but the ultimate curation process still remains laborious.With the tremendously increasing number of prokaryotic genomes that is being sequenced, there is a clear need for automated prokaryotic genome annotation tools able to integrate the variety of informative data that can be produced either by second-generation sequencing or by other high-throughput analyses, such as tiling arrays and proteomics. The development of such prokaryotic gene finders allowing not only the prediction of coding sequences (CDSs), but also TSSs and non-coding (nc) transcribed genes, should provide improved transcript quantification, facilitated identification of regulatory sequences upstream of mapped TSSs and thus, easier analysis of gene regulation. Because of the higher complexity of eukaryotic gene structures and the usual availability of transcribed sequences (such as expressed sequence tags or ESTs), many eukaryotic gene finders already have the ability to integrate experimental evidence in their gene prediction process. For example, ESTs are exploited in EuGene14 and Augustus,15 GenomScan16 uses similarities with known proteins, whereas SGP/SGP217,18 and EuGene'Hom19 integrates sequence conservation with related organisms.In this work, we adapted the eukaryotic gene finder, EuGene14,20, to the specific requirements of gene identification in prokaryotes, where in particular overlapping CDSs are relatively frequent. EuGene has already been used successfully to annotate a variety of eukaryotic genomes21–27 and has shown its ability to quickly incorporate new types of information for enhancing its predictive power. The generic tool developed here, called EuGene-P, exploits high-throughput data, such as strand-specific RNA-Seq data, to qualitatively improve the prediction contents and to minimize manual expert annotation. The produced annotation contains previously unpredicted important gene structure features such as 5' and 3' UTRs, as well as ncRNA genes (including antisense RNAs). The mathematical model behind EuGene-P and its modular software architecture based on plug-ins facilitate the integration of a variety of other high-throughput data, such as PET-Seq, mass spectrometry data, protein similarities, DNA homologies, predicted transcription terminators and others. The source codes of EuGene-P are available under the open-source Artistic licence at https://mulcyber.toulouse.inra.fr/projects/eugene. A fully automated generic prokaryotic pipeline annotation relying on EuGene-P is under preparation and will be made available.We trained and used EuGene-P for the annotation of the nitrogen-fixing symbiont Sinorhizobium meliloti bacterial strain 2011 (Sm2011). Sinorhizobium meliloti is a Gram-negative bacterium belonging to the alpha subclass of Proteobacteria, which can live either free in the soil, or in symbiotic association with roots of legume plants such as the model legume Medicago truncatula.26 The Sinorhizobium–Medicago symbiotic interaction leads to the formation of new root organs called nodules, within which bacteria differentiate into bacteroids that fix nitrogen to the benefit of the host plant. Both nodule organogenesis and bacteroid differentiation are complex developmental processes that involve deep reprogramming of gene expression in both organisms.28–30 The 6.7-Mb genome of Sm2011 is composed of three replicons, one main chromosome and two megaplasmids called pSymA and pSymB. The Sm2011 strain used in this study is closely related to the Sm1021 reference strain that was previously sequenced.31 Both strains are independent spontaneous streptomycin-resistant derivatives of the parental SU47 strain.32 Despite being originated from the same parental strain, a number of phenotypic differences were reported,33–38 which may be related to specific genetic differences. In this work, we determined both the genome sequence and the transcriptome of the Sm2011 strain under in planta and different growth conditions. These data were integrated into EuGene-P to refine and enrich the annotation of the S. meliloti genome sequence, notably to predict TSSs and ncRNA genes.2. Materials and methods2.1. Bacterial strains and growth conditionsThe bacterial strain used in this study was the streptomycin-resistant derivative of Sm2011 (GMI11495). A rpoE2 mutant derivative of this strain was generated as previously described.39 Strains were grown under aerobic conditions at 28°C in Vincent minimal medium supplemented with disodium succinate and ammonium chloride as carbon and nitrogen sources as previously described.40 Bacteria were collected either in a mid-exponential phase (OD600 = 0.6) or in an early stationary phase (~1 h 30 min after entry in a stationary phase, OD600 = 1.2). Bacteria were harvested by filtration on 0.2 µm membranes, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C until RNA extraction. Bacterial cultures were collected from three independent biological experiments.2.2. Plant material and growth conditionsMedicago truncatula cv Jemalong A17 seeds were germinated and transferred to aeroponic caissons as described,41 under the following chamber conditions: temperature: 22°C; 75% hygrometry; light intensity: 200 µE m-2 s-1; light–dark photoperiod: 16–8 h. Plants were grown for 18 days in caisson growth medium42 supplemented with 10 mM NH4NO3, before growth in nitrogen-free medium for 4 days prior to inoculation with S. meliloti. At 10 days post-inoculation, nodules were harvested on ice from at least 20 plants, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C. Each biological repetition corresponded to an independent caisson, with ~40 plants per caisson.2.3. Sinorhizobium meliloti genome sequencingThe genome of Sm2011 was sequenced at the Genoscope (CNS, Evry, France) using fractions of 454 Titanium (46 Mb), 454 paired ends (18 Mb, insert size: 8 kb) and Illumina single end reads (1.2 Gb, read length: 76 nt), providing a 190-fold theoretical coverage of the genome. The genome sequence was assembled as described in Supplementary Materials and Methods. The nucleotide sequences of Sm2011 and Sm1021 strains were compared using the glint software (Faraut T. and Courcelle E.; http://lipm-bioinfo.toulouse.inra.fr/download/glint/, unpublished) to identify polymorphic regions. A set of 71 mutations including 64 putative frameshifts were verified by Sanger sequencing of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products surrounding these regions generated using either Sm2011 or Sm102132 DNA as a template. The genome sequence of Sm2011 was submitted to Genbank under accession numbers CP004138, CP004139 and CP004140, and a browser was set up at https://iant.toulouse.inra.fr/S.meliloti2011.2.4. RNA preparationsRNAs were prepared as described in Supplementary Materials and Methods. Briefly, total RNAs extracted from cultured bacteria and root nodules were depleted of ribosomal RNAs by an oligocapture strategy derived from the Plant Ribominus kit (Invitrogen), in which the oligonucleotide sets were specifically designed to target M. truncatula and S. meliloti rRNAs, as well as the highly abundant S. meliloti tRNA-Ala (see Supplementary Table S1 for oligonucleotide sequences). RNAs were then separated in two fractions, short (<200 nt) and long (>200 nt), using Zymo Research RNA Clean & Concentrator™-5 columns (Proteigene).2.5. cDNA library preparation and Illumina sequencingOriented sequencing with a RNA ligation procedure was carried out by Fasteris SA (Geneva, Switzerland) using procedures recommended by Illumina, with adaptors and amplification primers designed by Fasteris, unless specified. For small RNAs, the Small RNA Sequencing Alternative v1.5 Protocol (Illumina) was used, starting with ~500 ng RNAs that were treated with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase to remove triphosphate at 5' transcript ends and purified on acrylamide gel before and after the adaptor ligation step. The 3' adaptor was the Universal miRNA cloning linker (NEB). For large RNAs, the amount of starting RNAs was ~200 ng, and a fragmentation step by zinc during 8 min was included, after the Illumina procedure. The size of selected inserts was 20–120 nt for short RNA libraries and 50–120 nt for long RNA libraries from cultured bacteria and 150–250 nt for long RNA libraries from nodules. Libraries were sequenced either in paired end or in single end (Table 1). Raw sequence data were submitted to the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (Accession GSE44083). RNA-Seq libraries used for annotationAll RNA samples were depleted in ribosomal RNA using the RiboMinus™ protocol and separated in short (<200 nt) and long (>200 nt) fractions. Note that nodule libraries contain a mixture of S. meliloti and M. truncatula transcriptomes.

Read mappingReads were mapped to the genome using the procedure as described in Supplementary Materials and Methods. For paired-end reads, all positions between the two reads were considered as transcribed. All transcription data can be visualized in the genome browser (https://lipm-browsers.toulouse.inra.fr/gb2/gbrowse/GMI11495-Rm2011G).2.7. Semi-conditional random field and 
associated featuresThe mathematical model of semi-conditional random field (CRF)43 has been used for gene finding in the eukaryotic gene finders, such as CRAIG44 and CONRAD,45 and implicitly used in EuGene from its creation. The semi-CRF model in EuGene-P is used to define an optimal segmentation of each strand of the genomic sequence into a succession of biologically meaningful regions. For one strand, the segmentation is defined by a succession of regions s= (s1 … sq). Each region si = (bi, li, ti) starts at position bi, has length li and labels ti. A label can be any of {IG, UTR5', UIR, UTR3', ncRNA, CDS1, CDS2, CDS3, CDS1:2, CDS2:3, CDS1:3}, where IG stands for intergenic, UTR5', UIR and UTR3' for untranslated regions of coding genes, ncRNA for non-coding RNA genes, CDSi for coding regions in frame i and CDSi:j for overlapping coding regions in frame i and j. See Fig. 1 for an example. A prokaryotic genomic sequence and the corresponding annotation defined as a sequence of typed regions. Each region has a specific label (or state) that defines its type. Beyond coding regions (e.g. CDS1) and intergenic regions (IG), an annotation may identify untranslated transcribed regions at the extremities of coding transcripts (5' and 3' UTRs), untranslated internal regions (or UIR, between two CDSs in a transcript) and ncRNA genes. Specific region types are also used to label overlapping CDSs. In this figure, the region labelled CDS1:3 corresponds to the overlap of a CDS in frame 1 with another CDS in frame 3.A prokaryotic genomic sequence and the corresponding annotation defined as a sequence of typed regions. Each region has a specific label (or state) that defines its type. Beyond coding regions (e.g. CDS1) and intergenic regions (IG), an annotation may identify untranslated transcribed regions at the extremities of coding transcripts (5' and 3' UTRs), untranslated internal regions (or UIR, between two CDSs in a transcript) and ncRNA genes. Specific region types are also used to label overlapping CDSs. In this figure, the region labelled CDS1:3 corresponds to the overlap of a CDS in frame 1 with another CDS in frame 3.The linear semi-CRF model computes the score of a segmentation (s1, …, sq) of a given input sequence as a linear combination of functions representing individual features of the segmentation. Each feature scores a region si based on its length li, its label ti, the label of the previous segment ti-1 and some evidence x (including the DNA sequence). EuGene-P relies more specifically on three types of features:
Each feature can be understood as generating votes in favour of some annotations. After a learning phase, each feature receives a weight representing a ‘confidence’. The annotation that collects the maximum weighted sum of votes is considered as the optimal prediction. The usual probabilistic interpretation of CRFs, the formal definition of all features used inside EuGene-P and associated training and prediction algorithms are described in Supplementary Materials and Methods.Contents features, <U+2060>, score the fact that a region si has received label ti. For example, if the nucleotides in the region si appear in an alignment with a known protein, a ‘protein alignment’ feature will score positively if the associated label ti represents a coding region in the frame/strand indicated by the alignment.Signal features, <U+2060>, score the fact that a region si with label ti starts at position bi after a region with label ti-1. For example, a ‘RNA-Seq sharp depth upshift’ feature will score positively if si-1, labelled as an intergenic region, is followed by si defining a transcribed region, and a sharp upshift in the transcription level is observed on mapped RNA-Seq around position bi.Length features, <U+2060>, score the fact that a segment si has a given length. A typical example would be a feature scoring against extremely short CDSs.2.8. Transcriptome analysisDifferential expression of identified genes was calculated with R v2.13.0 using DESeq v1.4.146 available in Bioconductor v2.8. DESeq utilizes a negative binomial distribution for modelling read counts per transcript and implements a method for normalizing the counts. Variance was estimated using the per-condition argument. P-values are adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini and Hochberg method.472.9. Quantitative RT-PCR analysesReverse transcription was performed using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) with random hexamers as primers. RNA samples isolated from at least three independent experiments were tested for each condition. Real-time PCRs were run on a LightCycler system (Roche) using the FastStart DNA MasterPLUS SYBRGreen I kit (Roche) according to the manufacturer's instructions.For gene expression normalization, six reference genes were selected from the RNA-Seq data of the current study, on the basis of their similar levels of expression in both culture conditions (exponential and stationary growth phases) and M. truncatula nodules. The expression level of these genes was then examined by qRT-PCR in wild-type and rpoE2 mutant strains grown at 28 and 40°C, and expression data were computed using the NormFinder application.48 SMc00519 and SMb21134 were found as the more stably expressed genes by NormFinder and were therefore used as references for qRT-PCR normalization in our conditions. Oligonucleotides sequences used for PCR are listed in Supplementary Table S2.3. Results3.1. A new integrative annotation tool for prokaryotic genomesOne of the main results of this work is the definition of an integrative gene finder for prokaryotic gene prediction, allowing automatic incorporation of various sources of evidence in the prediction process, including oriented RNA-Seq data. The produced annotation not only accounts for statistical properties of observed open reading frames, but also for consistency with a variety of experimental data, thus minimizing subsequent manual expert annotation work.We designed EuGene-P on the basis of the eukaryotic gene finder, EuGene.14,20 EuGene is able to incorporate the various types of information for enhancing its predictive power and has been used for the annotation of several genomes.21–27 As all recent integrative gene finders, EuGene does not rely on a full generative probabilistic model, such as Hidden Markov Models,49 that would require the expensive and unrealistic probabilistic modelling of all dependencies between the available information, but on a dedicated discriminative model. Formally, EuGene-P as EuGene can be described as semi-linear CRF-, or SL-CRF-,43 based predictor. A CRF is a variant of Markov random fields, aimed at capturing the conditional probability of a succession of unknown discrete random variables y=(y1 … yn) given observed variables x (the available evidence). From such a model, the values of the unknown variables y can be reconstructed as the most probable ones given the available evidence x. In gene finding, the genomic sequence and the available information (mapped reads, other similarities …) will be represented as the evidence x. The unknown (or hidden) variables y are used to represent structural annotations. We therefore associate one variable yi with every base in the sequence. The variable yi specifies the annotation label (or state) of the base at position i (inside a CDS, an intergenic region …). In eukaryotic genomes, despite the accumulating evidence of overlapping functional regions, existing gene finders usually assume that each base belongs to just one type of region. The above model, with one variable yi per base, is perfectly suitable to perform the gene prediction on both strands simultaneously. In gene-dense prokaryotic genomes, overlapping functional regions is a rather frequent event. Genes can overlap with neighbouring genes on either strand. The genomic model we chose is therefore an unusual stranded model. This model describes how genes appear on one strand, independently of the other.Formally, we have to enumerate the list of possible states for a nucleotide in an annotation. As shown in Fig. 1, since we restrict ourselves to a single strand, a typical prokaryotic sequence will contain bases belonging to either an intergenic region (denoted as IG), a transcribed non-translated region of a coding gene (denoted as UTR5', UIR or UTR3' depending on its location in the gene), a ncRNA gene (denoted as ncRNA), a non-overlapping CDS region in a given coding frame i (denoted as CDSi) or a region where two CDS in different coding frames i and j overlap (denoted as CDSi:j).Overall, each variable yi, representing possible annotations for nucleotide i, may take 11 different states. Such states cannot appear arbitrarily in the genome sequence. For example, a CDS must start and end at specific codons. The CRF model can capture gene structures described as simple automaton. The automaton used in EuGene-P is described in Fig. 2. Transitions between possible states in the automaton correspond to the occurrence of specific biological signals in the sequence. Transcription Starts and Transcription Ends denote the start and end of transcripts (containing coding genes or ncRNA genes), whereas Translation Starts and Translation Ends (denoted as TSi and TEi, respectively, where i is the frame of the corresponding codon in the sequence) enable to, respectively, start or end a CDS inside a transcript and possibly inside another CDS in a different frame. Finally, the conditional probability distribution that relates the evidence in x and possible annotations in y must be described. In CRF, this is done through a set of features. Every type of experimental or statistical evidence is represented by one (or more) feature. A feature is a small mathematical function that uses some available evidence to vote in favour of (or against) the prediction of specific elements. For example, a ‘protein similarities’ feature would vote in favour of CDS prediction in the regions that have similarities with known proteins. A precise definition of the different features available in EuGene-P is given in Materials and Methods. Once the set of features used for gene finding is fixed, the CRF model can be trained. This training process computes a multiplicative factor for each feature that determines a feature-specific confidence. The prediction is then in charge of finding the annotation that has maximum conditional probability. This is the prediction that accumulates most support from all features. Overall, the mathematical model and associated software provide a qualitative improvement in terms of its abilities in predicting TSSs, untranslated transcribed regions, overlapping CDSs, ncRNA genes and antisense genes. The different states and possible transitions between these states used inside EuGene-P.The different states and possible transitions between these states used inside EuGene-P.3.2. Generation of high-quality Sinorhizobium meliloti 2011 genome and transcriptome sequencing dataThe genome sequence of the streptomycin-resistant derivative of S. meliloti strain 2011 was generated using a combination of 454 (Roche) and Solexa (Illumina) technologies that provided a total coverage of ~190 genome equivalents. The assembly of the complete genome sequence was guided by the S. meliloti 1021 sequence that was determined previously.31 The comparison of these two DNA sequences revealed 463 polymorphisms, including 332 SNPs, 119 Indels and 12 large deletions or insertions (>10 bp; Supplementary Table S3). In addition to these differences, a 3564-nt region was specifically present in the chromosome of Sm2011 but not in Sm1021. This insertion, located between SMc03253 and SMc03254, was checked and confirmed by PCR amplification. This region contains a new gene, referred to as SMc06990, encoding a glutamine synthetase domain fused to a putative carbamoyl-phosphate synthase large chain ATP-binding protein, an enzyme that catalyzes the production of carbamoyl phosphate, which can be subsequently employed in both pyrimidine and arginine biosyntheses,50 as well as the SMc06992 gene which is a duplication (100% identical) of the SMc03253 gene preceded by two copies of its promoter region. The promoter region of SMc03253 was previously shown to be a duplication of the whole promoter region of fixK, a gene whose expression is controlled by the key symbiotic transcription regulator FixJ.51 Sanger DNA sequencing of 71 polymorphic regions including 64 putative frameshifts showed that 55 of them were actually errors on the reference sequence Sm1021, whereas eight were errors on the Sm2011 sequence and only eight were real polymorphisms (Supplementary Table S4). These results suggest that presumably only ~10% of the 463 polymorphisms are real (most being errors in the Sm1021 sequence).To obtain a global view of the transcriptome of Sm2011, RNAs were prepared from bacteria grown in three very different physiological conditions to cover a large number of expressed genes. These include RNAs extracted from bacteria grown in liquid cultures (in both exponential and stationary growth phases) and from 10-day-old nodules in which bacteria were differentiated in nitrogen-fixing bacteroids.52 For each condition, three biological replicates were performed to assess data reproducibility and reliability, and short (<200 nt) and long (>200 nt) RNA fractions were separately analysed. RNA samples were depleted in both ribosomal RNAs and the highly abundant tRNA-Ala using a S. meliloti-specific capture set of oligonucleotides and were sequenced using the stranded Illumina protocol.53,54 This protocol, based on ligation of adapters directly to the 3' and 5' ends of the RNA molecules, has the advantage of preserving the information about the transcript orientation. The RNA-Seq libraries generated in this study are listed in Table 1. The resulting sequences were mapped onto the S. meliloti genome sequence. RNA-Seq data appeared to be highly reproducible as shown in Supplementary Fig. S1 (Pearson correlation values varied from 0.899 to 0.998 between biological replicates). Of the 6308 S. meliloti annotated CDSs (see below), the expression of 5717 (90%) was detected in at least one experimental condition [raw expression level summed in the six libraries (short and long) of one condition was above 50 reads]. The number of mapped reads per nucleotide (summed values from triplicates) was visualized using the Apollo interface.55 Figure 3 illustrates a 3-kb region of the genome showing short and long RNAs in two conditions. The expression profiles of bacteria grown in exponential and stationary phases were compared with two previous studies performed in similar conditions, but based on oligonucleotide microarrays.30,39 Among the 804 genes found to be up-regulated in stationary phase in any of these studies, 631 genes (78%) were consistently found in our study to be up-regulated in the stationary phase (>2-fold, P < 0.05) either in the short or long RNA libraries. This percentage is similar to the percentage of common up-regulated genes found in the two microarray studies (80%), which attest to the good quality of our RNA-Seq data.

Annotation of the Sinorhizobium meliloti 2011 genome using EuGene-PEuGene-P inherits from EuGene its ability to integrate a variety of data. Selecting the most significant or informative sources of evidence is highly beneficial for the quality of the final annotation. We decided to use:
The translation Start and Stop features are generic (see Materials and Methods). EuGene-P allows the user to parameterize the definition of Stop and Start codons to deal with unusual codon tables.Similarities with known protein sequences modelled as a dedicated feature that votes for the prediction of coding regions in the corresponding coding frame (see Supplementary Materials and Methods). To identify similarities, we used the SwissProt database as a reliable general source of information for protein similarities. In addition, we used the proteome of the Sm1021 (set of all the protein sequences obtained by translating all CDS of the Sm1021 annotation) as a more specific source of information.Mapped RNA-Seq data that indicate transcription activity. For transcribed sequences, we used RNA libraries of Sm2011 in exponential or stationary growth conditions and libraries of S. meliloti-colonized M. truncatula nodule tissues. All reads were mapped to the S. meliloti genome (Table 1). The absolute expression level and the changes in relative expression levels were each exploited in a specific feature. The absolute expression level was used as an evidence of transcribed regions, while abrupt changes in expression, captured by the derivative of the log-level of the expression, indicate a possible TSS.Interpolated Markov models derived from coding potential to help identifying coding genes. The 3-periodic Markov models were estimated on CDSs from a subset of the genes in the Sm1021 annotation. Those genes have a specific (non-automatic) gene name, indicating that they have gone through expert annotation. Because they are known to have different statistical compositions, one coding model was estimated on pSymA genes and another coding model estimated on genes from pSymB together with the chromosome.Output of ncRNA prediction programs to help identifying RNA genes from known families. The genomic sequence of S. meliloti was analysed using tRNAscan-SE v1.23 (April 2002) for transfer RNA detection, RNAmmer (February 2006) for ribosomal RNAs and rfam_scan v1.0.2 with Rfam v10.0 (1446 families, April 2010) for other known ncRNA gene families. This produced a set of genomic regions predicted as ncRNA genes. Each of these intervals was used in a feature favouring ncRNA prediction in the region that contains them.Overall, the purely automated annotation of Sm2011 produced a total of 6483 coding genes and 2040 ncRNA (including tRNAs and rRNAs) genes. This raw annotation was then submitted to manual checking, leading to possible curation of predicted CDSs, UTRs and ncRNAs. Manual modifications were done using Apollo55 to simultaneously visualize predicted elements and RNA-Seq expression levels in each condition (Fig. 3). Each elementary modification typically impacts several levels. For instance, corrections of 5'/3' ends of UTRs often corresponded to the removal or creation of a new ncRNA. Typically, a predicted ncRNA that appeared close to 5' was removed, and the UTR enlarged to include the corresponding region. Overall, 100 ncRNAs were removed in this way and the corresponding region included in a UTR (47 5' UTRs and 53 3' UTRs), while 87 UTRs (35 5' UTRs and 52 3' UTRs) were modified and new ncRNAs annotated. Around 13% of protein-coding genes and 29% of nc genes were modified as described in Table 2. However, it is important to note that nc genes and UTRs are difficult to discriminate even by expert analyses of RNA-Seq data. The manual curation led to the final annotation described in Table 3 and is available on the browser https://iant.toulouse.inra.fr/S.meliloti2011. In total 6308 protein-coding genes, 9 rRNAs, 55 tRNAs, 28 tRNAs precursors and 1876 ncRNAs were annotated.

Identification of a high number of putative 
non-coding RNAs in Sinorhizobium melilotiThe number of predicted ncRNAs was remarkable (Table 3). All of them, but five that were only detected by Rfam_scan, were supported by RNA-Seq expression data. Because the number of predicted ncRNAs was surprisingly high, we compared the automated raw predictions (before manual curation) with the set of 1102 small RNA candidates proposed in the previous RNA-Seq study of Schlüter et al.56 In that study, sRNAs candidates were arbitrarily classified as trans-encoded, cis-encoded sense, cis-encoded antisense and mRNA leaders. Cis-encoded sense regions have been reported as probable mRNA degradation products in Schlüter et al.56 We therefore excluded cis-encoded sense candidates from the comparison. We found that 77% of cis-encoded antisense candidates, 76% of trans-encoded candidates and 53% of mRNA-leader candidates were covered on >50% of their length by regions that were predicted as non-translated transcribed regions (UTRs or ncRNA regions together covering 503 kb or 3.8% of all chromosomal and plasmid strands).Regarding the 1876 ncRNAs that were predicted after the manual curation, a large part (68%) was found located antisense to a protein-coding gene. Antisense RNAs overlap either with the 5'end (10%), the 3'end (19%) or the central part (71%) of the gene found on the opposite strand. These results strongly support the current findings that antisense transcription activity is more widespread in bacteria than initially thought.57,58Our predicted ncRNAs displayed an average size of 107 nt, 94% ranging between 20 and 250 nt (Supplementary Fig. S2). This length distribution is consistent with the sizes of 50–348 nt observed by Schlüter et al.56 Besides the 55 tRNAs, the nine rRNAs and the five well-characterized ncRNAs (ffs, ssrS, ssrA, rnpB and incA), only 36 additional ncRNA were classified by Rfam_scan in 18 known ncRNA families (Supplementary Table S5). A majority of them has thus a completely unknown function. Interestingly, analysis of expression patterns indicated that a large part of predicted ncRNAs were differentially expressed (> or <2-fold, P < 0.01) between at least two of the three conditions studied: 152 were induced in symbiosis compared with free-living conditions while 1116 were induced, and 317 were repressed in stationary phase when compared with exponential growth phase (Supplementary Tables S6 and S7). These expression patterns support the idea that ncRNAs potentially play important regulatory functions in S. meliloti under these conditions.Consistently with the study of Schlüter et al.56 intergenic repeated elements previously identified in the genome of S. meliloti, like the RIME, MOTIF or Sm-1 to Sm-5 repeats,59–61 were also transcribed and, thus, further increase the number of non-translated transcribed elements. Since reads corresponding to such repeated sequences could not be unambiguously mapped, it was difficult to estimate their relative expression levels and to determine whether they were all transcribed at a similar level.3.5. EuGene-P identifies TSSs and efficiently delineates 5' UTRs of mRNAsThe RNA-Seq protocol used here allowed us to precisely predict the 5' ends of RNAs. This is related to the fact that, prior to library constructions, RNA molecules were treated with the tobacco acid pyrophosphatase that converts the 5' triphosphate group of native transcripts into a 5' monophosphate capable of ligation with oligonucleotide adaptors (see Materials and methods). This procedure enabled the sequencing of 5' RNA ends with a very high precision and thereby the identification of probable TSSs. TSS prediction was based on the identification of abrupt changes in expression level as assessed by the approximation of the derivative of the expression level logarithm. In total, 4077 TSSs of protein-coding genes or nc genes were predicted with good confidence (clear changes in expression), whereas 763 were predicted with a lower confidence. Compared with the existing Sm1021 annotation,31 505 conserved CDSs had a modified start codon. This was a direct consequence of RNA-Seq data integration since the previously predicted start codon was usually located before the TSS predicted from RNA-Seq data, showing the interest of integrating RNA-Seq data for gene annotation.To further evaluate EuGene-P predictions, we compared our data with TSSs experimentally mapped in previous studies. Prokaryotic transcription initiates in promoter DNA regions, defined by the presence of binding sites for a dissociable RNA polymerase subunit called sigma factor.62 To date, seven S. meliloti sigma factors (among 15) are known to be active in at least one of the experimental conditions tested here: the vegetative sigma factor (RpoD, or sigma 70) and the alternative sigma factors RpoN, RpoH1, RpoH2, RpoE2, RpoE1 and RpoE4.39,63–66 The TSSs of >100 promoters known or supposed to be controlled by either one of these sigma factors were experimentally mapped in various studies (Table 4). The TSSs annotated from the transcript 5' ends mapped in the present study are in good agreement with these data, as 72% of the experimentally mapped TSSs match (±5 nt) our annotated TSSs (Table 4 and Supplementary Table S8). Several authors used the consensus promoter sequences deduced from these experimentally determined TSSs, combined or not with microarray or Affimetrix data, to predict >200 additional putative targets of these sigma factors (Table 4). The good congruence of these predictions with our data (74%) further strengthens our annotation (Table 4 and Supplementary Table S8). Note, however, that the number of correctly annotated TSSs was found to be positively correlated with the number of reads. Indeed, TSS annotations based on small numbers of reads appeared unreliable (24% of congruence), whereas TSSs covered by >50 sequencing reads were found to match more frequently the experimentally determined or in silico predicted TSSs (82 and 77%, respectively). Caution should therefore be taken with weakly expressed genes. Among other mis-annotated TSSs are those corresponding to processed transcripts, such as tRNA and rRNA, for which only 4 of 14 annotated TSSs match the predicted or experimentally determined TSSs (Supplementary Table S8). Finally, to evaluate the proportion of annotated 5'ends corresponding to actual TSSs, we reasoned that most of the promoters not analysed above should be recognized by the vegetative sigma factor RpoD. An in silico search revealed that >1/3 of them contain putative RpoD-binding sequences (Supplementary Table S9), as defined by MacLellan et al.67 Altogether, these observations therefore suggest that a large number of the annotated 5'ends indeed correspond to actual TSSs. Congruence between TSS annotation and the published literatureAll mapped or predicted promoter sequences are available in Supplementary Table S8.aGenes for which no TSS was annotated in the current study were not retained for this table.bData extracted from67,85,86 (RpoD)65 (RpoH1/H2),39,40,70 (RpoE2),66 (RpoE1/E4)87–94 (RpoN).cAs the coordinates of RpoN TSS predicted by Dombrecht et al.94 were not described in their paper, we kept the promoters carrying the most obvious -24/-12 RpoN-binding sequences.Congruence between TSS annotation and the published literatureAll mapped or predicted promoter sequences are available in Supplementary Table S8.aGenes for which no TSS was annotated in the current study were not retained for this table.bData extracted from67,85,86 (RpoD)65 (RpoH1/H2),39,40,70 (RpoE2),66 (RpoE1/E4)87–94 (RpoN).cAs the coordinates of RpoN TSS predicted by Dombrecht et al.94 were not described in their paper, we kept the promoters carrying the most obvious -24/-12 RpoN-binding sequences.Interestingly, manual inspection of transcription data allowed the identification of 33 CDSs having different TSSs depending on experimental conditions (Supplementary Tables S6 and S7).The length of annotated 5' UTRs ranges between 1 and 839 nt and displays a median size of 45 nt, which is similar to the median length of 5' UTRs observed in Escherichia coli (37 nt),68Synechococcus elongatus (33 nt)2, Geobacter sulfurreducens (37 nt)1 or Agrobacterium tumefaciens (61 nt).693.6. Reappraisal of the Sinorhizobium meliloti RpoE2 regulonThe genome-wide determination of TSSs should make it possible to extend our knowledge of regulons by looking for the conserved binding sites of regulators in promoter regions. We tested this idea on the RpoE2 regulon. RpoE2 is an extracytoplasmic function sigma factor involved in the general stress response of S. meliloti and is activated under various conditions, including heat shock, salt stress or entry into stationary phase following nitrogen or carbon starvation.39 This sigma factor was found in previous studies to target <40 S. meliloti promoters.39,40,70,71 To re-evaluate the extent of the RpoE2 regulon, we screened all DNA regions located 5–11 nt upstream of 5' transcript ends for the presence of the strictly conserved RpoE2-binding sequence (GGAAC N18–19 TT).39 We identified 108 transcription units that meet this criterion, including 26 putative ncRNAs (Supplementary Table S10). That most of these sequences correspond to genuine RpoE2-controlled promoters was validated by the following observations : (i) 30 of them were previously reported as RpoE2 targets,39,70,71 (ii) transcription from 86% of the newly identified promoters (67 of 78) was found in the current study as being up-regulated (>2-fold, P < 0.001) in stationary phase (a known RpoE2-activating condition; Supplementary Table S10) and finally (iii) using qRT-PCR, we confirmed that transcription from 6 of 6 randomly chosen promoters (four mRNAs and two ncRNAs) is up-regulated, either following a heat shock or entry in stationary phase (two RpoE2-activating conditions), in the wild type but not in a rpoE2 mutant strain (Supplementary Fig. S3). Altogether, these observations further validate TSS annotations predicted by EuGene-P and give a demonstration of its power to extend the knowledge of a given regulon.4. DiscussionThrough RNA sequencing, NGS technologies give access to prokaryotic transcriptomes with an unprecedented resolution and provide a massive amount of novel information on genome organization. In this work, we took advantage of data produced from the legume bacterial symbiont S. meliloti to develop a new bioinformatic tool that exploits transcription data for exhaustive annotation of prokaryotic genomes. The oriented RNA-Seq data that were produced from Sm2011 in stationary and exponential phases as well as in symbiotic condition have excellent reproducibility, with highly consistent triplicates and a good congruence when compared with previously published data. The analysis of both short and long fractions of RNAs enabled the identification of transcribed biological objects of small length, like ncRNAs and short CDSs, which could have been lost with usual RNA preparation protocols. The Sm2011 oriented RNA sequencing also showed a complex landscape of expression on both strands. Such complexity would have been completely hidden by non-oriented sequencing, possibly leading to biased expression level measurements as well as a poorer genome annotation.Oriented RNA-Seq data give an opportunity to define a new generation of integrative prokaryotic genome annotation tools. In the area of prokaryotic genome annotation, existing NGS-related studies11 have focussed on the possibly increased level of sequencing errors associated with such technologies. Here, we showed that the quality of the Sm2011 genomic sequence obtained by NGS is comparable with, if not better than, the Sm1021 genomic sequence previously generated by Sanger sequencing.31 Using oriented RNA-Seq data, the EuGene-P proved to be able to automatically produce a complex annotation with novel coding and nc genes, including many antisense genes, untranslated 5' and 3' regions and precise mapping of 5' TSSs. To the best of our knowledge, EuGene-P is the first prokaryotic gene finder that is able to predict a comprehensive genome annotation. The ability to predict highly overlapping functional regions is directly inherited from the strand-specific prediction process, which is itself consistent with oriented RNA-Seq data. Predicting genes on each strand independently has historically been considered as a bad idea given that the gene contents of the two DNA strands are highly correlated. However, ncRNA genes and specifically antisense genes blur this idea, which is already shaken by overlapping CDSs and transcripts. Strand-specific prediction and oriented RNA-Seq allow dealing with this complex situation directly.The quality of the Sm2011 automatic annotation was validated by in-depth manual curation. A relatively limited number of manual modifications were made using Apollo for the simultaneous visualization of per-triplicated bank expression levels and annotation on both strands. The distinction between 3' and 5' UTRs and nearby ncRNA genes remains difficult and is still questionable even in the expert annotation. Beyond this, the resulting final annotation led to the definition of accurate gene structures, which is very useful for biologists to better understand the organization of genes and to characterize their function and regulation.The number of predicted ncRNA genes is particularly high in S. meliloti, even though we cannot rule out that some of them encode peptides or small proteins. Most predicted ncRNA regions are consistently supported by RNA-Seq data. The fact that a large proportion of predicted ncRNAs are differentially expressed between the three physiological conditions analysed suggests that they are probably not artefacts introduced either by cDNA library preparation or by sequencing protocols. Moreover, the list of ncRNA genes predicted in a previous RNA-Seq study56 is also largely covered by our predicted nc transcripts, despite the fact that it represents only a small fraction of the genome. Among the 1876 predicted ncRNAs, 29 have been experimentally validated by northern blot or 5'-RACE analyses in previous studies.56,72–74 Beside tRNAs, rRNAs and the five well-conserved and well-characterized ncRNAs, 4.5S RNA (SRP, ffs), 6S RNA (ssrS), tmRNA (ssrA), the ribozyme RNase P (rnpB) and incA that mediates plasmid incompatibility phenotypes,75 36 ncRNAs belong to known families described in the Rfam database, whereas the remaining predicted ncRNAs could not be assigned to a given class. A lot of work thus remains to be done to validate the existence of predicted ncRNAs and to elucidate their function in S. meliloti. Interestingly, 454-sequencing of small ncRNAs of A. tumefaciens, a bacterium phylogenetically close to S. meliloti, recently revealed the presence of numerous small RNAs on all four replicons.69 The number of ncRNAs in S. meliloti would be even higher if widespread repeated elements like the RIME, MOTIF and Sm-1 to Sm-5 repeats59–61, that appeared to be highly transcribed elements, were taken into account. Similar repeated regions, like bacterial interspersed mosaic element and boxC DNA repeat elements, have also been shown to be transcribed in E. coli and to play key roles in transcription attenuation76 or mRNA stabilization.77,78 More recently, they have also been demonstrated to be involved in nucleoid morphology and chromosome formation and maintenance.79A large proportion of S. meliloti ncRNAs were found to map antisense to annotated protein-coding genes. With oriented RNA-Seq data, antisense transcription now appears to be a common and widespread phenomenon in bacteria as recently reported for E. coli, in which 1005 antisense RNAs were identified,80,81 and Helicobacter pylori, in which 46% of CDSs are overlapping with at least one antisense RNA.82,83 Several mechanisms of the action of antisense RNAs in bacteria have been recently reviewed.84 They include the alteration of target RNA stability, the modulation (inhibition or activation) of translation, transcriptional interference and attenuation. Antisense RNA-mediated regulation thus likely appears as an important component of complex regulatory pathways controlling gene expression in bacteria. However, it was recently suggested by Nicolas et al.83 that some antisense RNAs can potentially arise from spurious transcription initiation or from imperfect control of transcription termination.In this study, we also provided a detailed map of S. meliloti TSSs. This high-resolution TSS map is in agreement with previous in silico predicted or experimentally determined TSSs, in which 72% of validated TSSs matched our annotated TSSs by ±5 nt. These data will greatly facilitate the study of promoter regions, the identification of protein-binding motifs and the determination of regulons in S. meliloti. This was done here for the RpoE2 regulon that appears to be almost three times larger than previously determined using classical approaches.39Oriented bacterial RNA-Seq data also unveil more complex mechanisms, such as alternative transcription starts, depending on the experimental condition (exponential or stationary phase). In our expression data, we identified 33 genes that displayed multiple TSSs. The frequency of multiple TSSs would have probably been higher if more physiological conditions had been analysed. Indeed, it was shown in E. coli and Bacillus subtilis that 35 and 46% of genes, respectively, have multiple TSSs.68,83 This type of adaptive behaviour is currently difficult to represent and raises new problems for automatic genome annotation and visualization.In conclusion, we developed a new generic tool, EuGene-P, to automatically and accurately annotate prokaryotic genomes by integrating genome-wide experimental data, such as RNA-Seq data. This tool was used to re-visit the structural annotation of S. meliloti, providing a much more complete and comprehensive view of its genome architecture. The ability of EuGene-P to identify nc transcribed elements as well as to precisely map TSSs offers a new view of prokaryotic genomes and should greatly contribute to our understanding of gene regulation and function in bacteria.Supplementary dataSupplementary Data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by the Agence Nationale de la Recherche under grant ANR-08-GENO-106 ""SYMbiMICS"".

The determination of gene-specific linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns in desi and kabuli based on single nucleotide polymorphism-microsatellite marker haplotypes revealed extended LD decay, enhanced LD resolution and trait association potential of genes. The evolutionary history of a strong seed-size/weight-associated TF based on natural variation and haplotype sharing among desi, kabuli and wild unravelled useful information having implication for seed-size trait evolution during chickpea domestication.1. IntroductionMicrosatellite markers are preferred in plant genetic and genome analyses owing to their desirable genetic attributes, including hypervariability, multi-allelic nature, reproducibility, co-dominant inheritance, chromosome-specific location and wide genomic distribution. The significance of such markers particularly those derived from the protein-coding sequences and non-coding untranslated regions (UTRs) of genes has reportedly been attributed to their inherent affinity to act as ‘functional genetic markers’ for rapidly establishing marker–trait linkages and to identify genes/quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for traits of agricultural importance in crop plants.1–3 Moreover, these genic markers have proven to be advantageous over anonymous markers for functional genetic diversity estimation, construction of transcript map, marker-assisted selection, trait association analysis and comparative mapping as well as in evolutionary studies as anchor markers in plant species, including chickpea.2–8 In chickpea, a total of ~11 000 genic microsatellite markers have been developed so far in silico from the expressed sequence tags (ESTs)7–10 and next-generation de novo transcript sequences of diverse contrasting genotypes.11–14 However, only a smaller proportion (~5–10%) of these markers have been validated experimentally and used for various genotyping applications in chickpea. The remaining (~90–95%) larger sets of in silico designed genic markers have not even been verified for their amplification of target microsatellite sequence in chickpea genotypes from which the markers were designed. Nevertheless, the lack of requisite intra- and inter-specific genetic polymorphisms detected by such genic microsatellite markers,6,7,9,10 which are derived from the conserved expressed component of the genome, has limited their use in identification and fine mapping of genes/QTLs for important agronomic traits in chickpea. Additionally, it is also difficult to select useful and informative genic markers from such largely available in silico marker datasets (~11 000 markers) for validation and efficient genotyping applications in chickpea. Therefore, the construction of a smaller database comprising of experimentally validated and functionally relevant genic microsatellite markers with relatively high polymorphic potential is essential for various applications of genetics, genomics and breeding in chickpea.The recent advancement of novel array-based sequencing technologies, high-throughput genotyping and modern genomic tools have accelerated the generation of transcript sequences encoding the known/candidate genes globally and their corresponding protein-coding and UTR sequences in diverse contrasting chickpea genotypes at a genome-wide scale.8,11–14 It includes identification of 1773 transcription factor (TF)-encoding genes from very high-depth next-generation de novo transcript sequences of chickpea desi genotype ICC 4958 (Chickpea Transcriptome Database, CTDB release 1.0, http://www.nipgr.res.in/ctdb.html).12 There have been substantial evidences on the role of functional domains in the TF gene-encoding proteins as master regulators for controlling diverse and complex cellular processes,15,16 such as development and stress responses and domestication in monocot and dicot species including legumes.16–18 The use of functional domains of TF genes for developing informative genic microsatellite markers in the case of two Solanaceous plant species, such as tomato and pepper, has been well documented.19 Hence, the TFs with well-characterized functional domains will serve as excellent candidates and valuable transcriptomic resource for novel sequence-based genic functional microsatellite marker development in chickpea. Besides, the large-scale validation and high-throughput genotyping of such designed TF gene-derived microsatellite (TFGMS) and TF functional domain-associated microsatellite (TFFDMS) markers in a diverse set of desi, kabuli and wild genotypes would have profound utility in various applications of structural, functional and comparative genomics, including marker-assisted genetic improvement in chickpea.In view of the above, the present study was undertaken to develop informative TFGMS and TFFDMS markers from the TF genes and to evaluate their potential for large-scale genotyping applications in chickpea. The functional significance of such TF gene-based microsatellite markers was assessed by integrating trait association analysis with genetic mapping, differential expression profiling, protein modelling and linkage disequilibrium (LD)-based haplotype gene evolution in chickpea.2. Materials and methods2.1. Development and physical mapping of genic TFGMS and TFFDMS markersThe FASTA sequences of 1773 unique TF encoding transcripts of chickpea genotype ICC495811,12 were batch acquired from Chickpea Transcriptome Database (CTDB version 1.0, http://www.nipgr.res.in/ctdb.html). These transcript sequences were searched individually for microsatellites using MISA (Microsatellite, http://pgrc.ipk-gatersleben.de/misa). The identified microsatellites were characterized as perfect (mononucleotides to hexanucleotides) and hypervariable Class I (=20 nucleotides) and Class II (12–20 nucleotides) based on the length of the repeat motifs.4,20 The microsatellite containing TF-encoding transcripts were analysed in the NCBI open reading frame (ORF) Finder (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gorf) to predict the longest ORF within the transcripts. The amino acid sequences encoded by the predicted ORF of microsatellite containing transcripts were analysed using Pfam and further BLAST searched against the NCBI conserved domain and the nr protein database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/wrpsb.cgi) to determine the presence of functional domains within the ORF. Further, these amino acid sequences were sequence homology (BLAST) searched against 1770 AGRIS TF genes21 of Arabidopsis thaliana (TAIR 10 release, www.arabidopsis.org), TF database22 of legumes (1467 TFs of Medicago truncatula, 5035 of Glycine max and 1626 of Lotus japonicas) and 1470 TFs of Cajanus cajan.23 Based on above analyses, a set of microsatellite containing TF gene orthologues of chickpea with conserved functional domains were screened at a high bit score of =500 and E-value of =1e-41. Finally, the localization of functional domains in the ORF encoding amino acid sequences was correlated with the positions of microsatellite repeat motifs in their corresponding transcripts. The unique forward and reverse primers with the amplification product size of 200–400 bp targeting both functional domain and microsatellite repeat-motif regions were designed (BatchPrimer3, http://probes.pw.usda.gov/batchprimer3) based on two criteria (Fig. 1), and two distinct groups of Type I and Type II TFFDMS markers in chickpea were developed. The unique primer pairs designed exclusively from the ORF and 5' and 3' UTRs of TF gene/transcript sequences flanking the microsatellite repeat motifs (without inclusion of the functional domain regions) were developed as TFGMS markers (Fig. 1) in chickpea. Development of TFGMS and TFFDMS markers from different UTR and ORF sequence components of TF genes in chickpea. The forward and reverse primers designed from the transcript sequences flanking the microsatellite repeat motifs that are present within and/or adjacent to the functional domain regions of TF genes were used to develop Type I (A) and Type II (B) TFFDMS markers, respectively. Primers designed from the flanking sequences of the microsatellite repeat motifs that are present either in the ORF (A) (other than Type I and Type II TFFDMS) or 5' and 3' UTRs (B) of TF genes were used to develop TFGMS markers.Development of TFGMS and TFFDMS markers from different UTR and ORF sequence components of TF genes in chickpea.

Primers designed from the flanking sequences of the microsatellite repeat motifs that are present either in the ORF (A) (other than Type I and Type II TFFDMS) or 5' and 3' UTRs (B) of TF genes were used to develop TFGMS markers.The transcript sequences flanking the TFGMS and TFFDMS repeat motifs were BLAST searched (E-value = 0) against recently released draft genome pseudomolecules (version 1.1)24 of chickpea to determine the physical positions (bp) of the designed genic markers on the eight chromosomes. The microsatellite markers with unique BLAST hits on the pseudomolecules were allocated individually across the chickpea chromosomes based on their ascending order of physical position (bp) and visualized using the MapChart software (version 2.2).252.2. Evaluation of amplification efficiency and polymorphic potentialTo evaluate the amplification efficiency of in silico designed genic microsatellite markers, primers for a total of 1000 perfect microsatellite markers, including 148 Class I and 691 Class II TFGMS and 161 TFFDMS markers, were synthesized and amplification carried out from genomic DNA of chickpea genotype ICC4958, the source of sequence for designing primers. The TFGMS and TFFDMS markers exhibiting clear and reproducible amplicons in the gel-based assay were further amplified using the genomic DNA isolated from 92 desi and kabuli chickpea genotypes and 4 accession of wild species (Cicer reticulatum; Supplementary Table S1) for accessing their polymorphic potential. The standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) constituents and optimum cyclic conditions except for annealing temperature (55–60°C, depending on the primers used) were used for PCR amplification. The amplified PCR products were resolved in 3.5% metaphor agarose gel and their band-size was determined against a 50-bp DNA ladder. A selected set of TFGMS and TFFDMS markers showing monomorphic as well as polymorphic amplification in metaphor agarose gel among 96 genotypes were further resolved using the automated fragment analyzer. For automated fragment analysis, the PCR products amplified from fluorescent dye-labelled primers were mixed with Hi-Di™ formamide loading buffer and GeneScan-600LIZ size standard (Applied Biosystems, IL, USA), denatured, cooled and resolved in automated 96 capillary ABI 3730xl DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). The electrophoregram containing trace files were analysed, and automated allele calling was carried out using the GeneMapper version 4.0 (Applied Biosystems). Based on these analyses, the actual allele size (bp) and fragment length polymorphism (bp) detected by TFGMS and TFFDMS markers in 96 genotypes were determined. The genotyping data of all TFGMS and TFFDMS markers validated both in gel-based assay and automated fragment analysis were used to estimate the frequency and distribution of amplified alleles, average polymorphic alleles per marker, per cent polymorphism and polymorphism information content (PIC) employing the PowerMarker version 3.51.26 To confirm that the TFGMS and TFFDMS markers did amplify the expected microsatellite repeat motifs in different genotypes, the amplified PCR products of size variant amplicons generated from different polymorphic TFGMS and TFFDMS markers were purified, cloned in pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega, USA) and sequenced in both forward and reverse directions twice on a capillary-based Automated DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems, ABI 3730xl DNA Analyzer) using the BigDye Terminator v3.1 sequencing kit and M13 forward and reverse primers. The trace files were base called, checked for quality and then assembled into contigs. The high-quality consensus sequences thus obtained for each markers were aligned and compared among genotypes. The presence of predicted microsatellite repeat motifs and correspondence of fragment length polymorphism with repeat length expansion/contraction for each polymorphic markers were inferred among chickpea genotypes.2.3. Assessment of population genetic structure and functional molecular diversityThe validated polymorphic TFGMS and TFFDMS markers and 96 previously reported27 genomic microsatellite markers distributed over eight chromosomes/linkage groups (LGs) of chickpea were used to determine population structure and functional molecular diversity and to establish genetic relationships among 96 genotypes (Supplementary Table S1). The marker genotyping data were used in a model-based programme, STRUCTURE,28 for the determination of population structure using the admixture and correlated allele frequency with a burn-in of 50 000 iterations and run length of 100 000. Analysis of population genetic structure among genotypes was carried out using the Bayesian clustering algorithm of STRUCTURE with varying levels of K (number of population) = 2–10. The average of Ln P(D) against each K across 20 independent replications was estimated and plotted. The K at which Ln P(D) plateaus with a-value of <0.2 was considered as optimum K. Using this optimum K, the population structure model representing better relationships among 96 genotypes was constructed. Various population genetic parameters, including the efficiency of TFGMS and TFFDMS marker loci, for detecting genetic variability (FST) and the degree of admixture within and between population groups were estimated.2.4. Trait association analysisTo evaluate the efficiency of TFGMS and TFFDMS markers for seed and pod trait-specific association in chickpea, the candidate gene-based association analysis was performed in 96 genotypes (representing >85% diversity of total core germplasm lines), which were selected from 417 global core germplasm collections of chickpea based on their phenotypic and genotypic diversity estimate measures. The constituted association panel (representing 16 countries of the world) included 92 diverse small and large seed-size desi and kabuli germplasm lines, released varieties and breeding lines and four wild accessions of C. reticulatum (Supplementary Table S1). The genotyping data of validated polymorphic TFGMS and TFFDMS markers and 96 genomic microsatellite markers27 distributed over eight chromosomes/LGs of chickpea and phenotypic data of three major seed and pod traits (100-seed weight, number of pods per plant and number of seeds per plant) on 96 association mapping panel were analysed in the TASSEL (http://www.maizegenetics.net29). A general linear model (GLM) and mixed linear model (MLM) considering the multiple levels of ancestry coefficient data (Q matrix) as obtained in the population genetic structure at an optimal population number and relative kinship (K) matrix estimated from SPAGeDi 1.230 were used to measure the two important parameters of trait association namely, P_adj_marker (significant association of TFGMS and TFFDMS markers with traits) and marker R_square (magnitude of association/correlation, i.e. proportion of phenotypic variance explained by the markers with traits). The GLM trait association model was permuted 1000 times to optimize the threshold significance level for association analysis. Finally, based on the combined results of GLM and MLM analyses, the TFGMS and TFFDMS markers showing association with three major seed and pod traits in chickpea genotypes at significant cut-off P_adj value of =0.05 (with 95% confidence) and R2-value of =0.10 were selected for further analyses.2.5. Transcript map construction and genetic mappingThe genotyping data of TFGMS and TFFDMS markers and genomic microsatellite markers showing polymorphism between two parental small desi (ICCX-810800 with 100-seed weight 11 g) and large kabuli (ICC20268 with 100-seed weight 47 g) genotypes and 94 individuals of F3 mapping population derived from intra-specific crosses between above desi × kabuli genotypes were analysed using JoinMap 4.1 (http://www.kyazma.nl/index.php/mc.JoinMap) at higher logarithm of odds (LOD) threshold with Kosambi function. Finally, the genic microsatellite markers one in each TFs and genomic microsatellite markers were allocated into defined LGs, and the genetic map was constructed using the MapChart version 2.2.25Genetic/QTL mapping was performed using the genotyping data of 96 parental polymorphic TFGMS and TFFDMS markers and 32 genomic microsatellite markers, 100-seed weight/size trait-specific precise phenotyping data of 94 F3 segregating individuals and 2 parental genotypes and genetic linkage map information of markers mapped on the eight LGs of chickpea. The segregating individuals along with parental genotypes were phenotyped in the field in randomized block design with at least two replications for two consecutive years, and 100-seed weight (g) was measured by taking the average weight of 100 seeds in each mapping individuals. The frequency distribution and analysis of variance (ANOVA) of 100-seed weight trait-specific phenotypic data in the 96 segregating mapping population were analysed using SPSS 17.0 (http://www.spss.com/statistics, IBM SPSS Inc. for window, Chicago, USA). The single marker analysis, interval mapping and composite interval mapping function of MapQTL 631 with an LOD threshold score of >3.0 at 1000 permutations were significantly considered (5% level of significance) to identify and to map the major TF genes/QTLs for 100-seed weight/size on the chickpea LGs.2.6. Differential expression profilingTo access the utility of genic markers for regulatory gene functions, the differential expression analyses of seed and pod trait-specific TFGMS and TFFDMS-associated TF genes were performed in two chickpea genotypes. The total RNA was isolated (Trizol, Invitrogen, USA) from two different seed developmental stages (early cell division phase during 10–20 days after podding (DAP) and late maturation phase during 21–30 DAP) of small (desi ICCX-810800) and large (kabuli ICC20268) seed-size genotypes considering leaf at vegetative stage as control. The isolated total RNA was quantified and diluted to equal concentration and used for first-strand cDNA synthesis by the ImProm-II™ Reverese Transcription system (Promega). The synthesized cDNA was further amplified with above-said TF gene-based markers using the semi-quantitative and SYBR green chemistry-based real-time quantitative RT-PCR. The house-keeping gene elongation factor 1-alpha (EF1a) suitable for consistent expression across various organs and developmental stages of chickpea32 was used as internal control in RT-PCR assays. Three biological replicates of each sample and three technical replicates of each biological replicate, with no template and primer as control, were analysed for individual marker in quantitative RT-PCR. The expression level of trait-associated genic markers obtained in diverse seed developmental stages of two contrasting genotypes was compared with each other and with control. Based on this, a set of trait-associated TF genes showing differential expression during seed development in chickpea genotypes was identified. To confirm the presence of TFGMS and TFFDMS repeat motifs in the transcripts and further to derive the correspondence of differential expression profiling with fragment length polymorphism based on variable microsatellite repeat units, the cDNA and genomic DNA fragments amplified from seed and pod trait-associated TF gene-based markers in two contrasting chickpea genotypes were cloned and sequenced as mentioned above.2.7. Functional relevance of TFFDMS markers in silicoTo infer in silico, the functional significance of seed and pod trait-associated TFFDMS markers showing fragment length polymorphism in both small and large seed-size chickpea genotypes, the amino acid sequences of the functional domains carrying microsatellites in five TF genes was analysed using Modeller 9v8 (http://salilab.org/modeller). Three-dimensional homology modelling of these TFFDMS containing TF gene-encoding proteins were performed by selecting a suitable template in each case where 10 models of the target proteins were generated. These predicted models were energy minimized (1000 steps) and their overall stereochemical quality and accuracy were evaluated employing Ramchandran plot analysis.33 The best model was selected having >90% of its residues lying in the most favoured region of Ramchandran plot. Finally, the best models of each TFFDMS carrying TF gene-encoding proteins were visualized and analysed using a highly interactive and extensive molecular graphic programme of CHIMERA (www.cgl.ucsj.edu/chimera).2.8. Estimation of gene-specific LD patternsTo determine the pattern of LD within the genes, the seed and pod trait-specific TFGMS and TFFDMS markers-associated TF genes were cloned and sequenced. The high-quality sequences generated for each gene were aligned among 96 chickpea genotypes (Supplementary Table S1) using the CLUSTALW multiple sequence alignment tool in MEGA 4.034 and mined the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci. The results were exported in meg format, and the meg files were analysed further using DNaSp version 5.035 to estimate the level of nucleotide diversity (p),36 Watterson's <U+03B8> level of SNPs for the population mutation rate37 and Tajima's D statistic38 across the genotypes. Finally, the SNP (minor allele frequency =0.05), TFGMS and TFFDMS marker genotyping information generated in the TF genes were used for the constitution of haplotypes and the determination of haplotype diversity and LD patterns within these genes among desi and kabuli. The genic SNP and microsatellite marker-based haplotype genotyping information were further correlated with three major seed and pod trait-specific phenotypic information of 96 association mapping panel for trait association analysis using the TASSEL as mentioned earlier. In the TF genes, the LD decay was estimated by combining the r2-values of marker pairs present in each 100 bp equal interval sequenced regions between 0 and 1 kb. The graph was plotted between pooled r2 and physical distance based on the non-linear regression model;39,40 and ultimately, the trend of LD decay was estimated in desi and kabuli.3. Results and discussion3.1. Development of genic TFGMS and TFFDMS markers and their PCR amplification efficiencyA total of 1773 TF gene-encoding transcript sequences of chickpea ICC4958 were mined for microsatellite repeat motifs and used to design both the genic TFGMS and TFFDMS markers for large-scale genotyping applications. Forward and reverse primer pairs could be designed from the transcript sequences flanking 1269 perfect microsatellite repeat motifs present in 707 TF genes (Supplementary Table S2). The analysis led to the development of 1108, including 148 (13.4%) Class I and 960 (86.6%) Class II TFGMS markers in 564 TF genes of chickpea. A set of 567 (51.2%) and 541 (48.8%) TFGMS markers were designed from the ORF and 5' and 3' UTRs of the TF genes, respectively. The density of TFGMS markers in the ORF of TF genes was higher (1 per 1.1 kb) than that estimated in the UTRs (1 per 1.4 kb). The CAA-rich trinucleotide (82.2%) and non-triplet repeat motifs (57.7%) carrying TFGMS markers were predominant in the ORF and UTRs of TF genes, respectively. It could be due to more selection against the frameshift mutations in the ORF than the UTRs, resulting in limited expansion of non-triplet microsatellite motifs in the ORF of TF genes in chickpea.2–4,11,12 According to localization of the microsatellite repeat motifs adjacent/within the functional domains of TF genes (Fig. 1), a set of 161 including 20 (12.4%) Class I TFFDMS markers in the 143 TF genes was designed (Supplementary Table S2). It comprises 74 Type I and 87 Type II TFFDMS markers. The trinucleotide repeat motifs (87.7%) carrying TFFDMS markers were abundant in the TF genes. Remarkably, we identified 27 such genes in which multiple TFGMS and TFFDMS markers could be designed from individual genes. It thus resulted in the development of 64 markers, including 37 TFGMS and 27 TFFDMS, from 27 TF genes. All the designed 1108 TFGMS and 161 TFFDMS markers in the 707 TF genes were submitted to publicly available NCBI Probe database (Accession numbers PUID16584974 to PUID16586242) for unrestricted use (Supplementary Table S2). Our marker dataset was compared between earlier reported 657 TF gene-derived and 279 EST-based microsatellite markers in chickpea,6,7 where notably two genic microsatellite markers were found to be common in both. This confirms TF gene-based microsatellite markers developed in our study for chickpea genome to be novel and not reported earlier.To evaluate the amplification efficiency of designed genic microsatellite markers, a selected set of 1000 including 148 Class I and 691 Class II perfect TFGMS markers and 161 TFFDMS markers were PCR amplified (Supplementary Table S2). A total of 801 (95.5%) TFGMS and 157 (97.5%) TFFDMS markers of these produced clear and reproducible amplicons with fragments of expected product size in metaphor agarose gel. The remaining (3–5%) did not give amplification in any of the 96 chickpea genotypes including the ICC4958 from which the primers were designed. To verify the amplicon for expected microsatellite repeat motifs and also to exclude the possibility of cross-amplification particularly for the TFFDMS markers, the amplified PCR products obtained from each of 24 TFGMS and TFFDMS markers in selected genotypes were cloned and sequenced. In about 97% of markers, the existence of target TFGMS and TFFDMS repeat motifs as well as their corresponding flanking transcript sequences were observed (Fig. 2A). A high (average 96.5%) amplification success rate of TFGMS and TFFDMS markers and their subsequent validation through large-scale cloned amplicon sequencing suggested the utility of TF gene-encoding transcript sequences in designing the informative sequence-based robust genic markers for their immense use in various large-scale genotyping applications in chickpea. Allelic variation detected among a representative set of desi and kabuli genotypes using normal unlabelled and fluorescent dye-labelled TFGMS and TFFDMS markers in gel-based assay (A) and automated fragment analyzer (B), respectively. A maximum of 8 and 10 polymorphic alleles were amplified by markers among 96 chickpea genotypes using the gel-based assay (A) and automated fragment analyzer (B), respectively. The fragment sizes (bp) for all the amplified polymorphic alleles are indicated. The sequencing of cloned amplicons from different TFGMS and TFFDMS markers showing fragment length polymorphism validated the presence of expected microsatellite repeat motifs and further corresponded with their variations and step-wise multiples of the number of repeat units.Allelic variation detected among a representative set of desi and kabuli genotypes using normal unlabelled and fluorescent dye-labelled TFGMS and TFFDMS markers in gel-based assay (A) and automated fragment analyzer (B), respectively.

Polymorphic potential of genic TFGMS and TFFDMS markers and molecular basis of their fragment length polymorphismThe 801 TFGMS (137 Class I and 664 Class II) and 157 TFFDMS markers showing successful amplification were used to study polymorphic potential among a set of 92 desi and kabuli genotypes and 4 accessions of a wild species (Supplementary Table S1). Two hundred and fifty-eight (32.2%) of the 801 TFGMS markers in the 203 TF genes were polymorphic (with average PIC of 0.44) among 96 genotypes in 3.5% metaphor agarose gel (Supplementary Table S2). It included 54 of the 137 (39.4%, with an average PIC of 0.51) Class I and 204 of the 664 (30.7%, 0.40) Class II TFGMS markers. The TFGMS markers designed specifically from the 5' UTR (36.2%) of TF genes revealed more polymorphism than that from the conserved ORF sequences (30.7%). Two hundred and thirty-one (28.8%) of the 801 TFGMS markers in the 193 TF genes showed polymorphism (1–5 alleles and mean PIC of 0.41) among the 52 desi genotypes, whereas 192 (24%) markers in the 147 genes detected polymorphism (1–4 alleles and mean PIC of 0.36) in the 40 kabuli genotypes. The extent of polymorphism detected by the genic markers between desi and kabuli genotypes (31%) was higher than within the desi and kabuli genotypes (26%). The inter-specific polymorphism between cultivated and wild species (33.4%) was higher in contrast to that of intra-specific polymorphism in the desi and kabuli genotypes (28%). A total of 897 alleles were amplified by 258 polymorphic TFGMS markers in 96 genotypes. The number of alleles amplified by the polymorphic TFGMS markers in these genotypes varied from 1 to 8 with an average of 3.5 alleles per marker (Fig. 2A).The efficiency of 157 TFFDMS markers in the 141 TF genes was compared with that of 801 TFGMS markers to detect polymorphism in the same set of 96 genotypes (Supplementary Table S1). The TFFDMS markers in contrast to TFGMS markers detected the low level of polymorphism (29.3%, 46 markers) with 1–4 alleles per locus giving an average PIC of 0.39 (Supplementary Table S2). The intra- (26%) and inter- (31%) specific polymorphism detected by TFGMS and TFFDMS markers among the 96 genotypes gel-based assay are comparable with that estimated earlier using the normal unlabelled EST-derived genic microsatellite markers (25–30%),8,10 but lower than for unlabelled genomic (40–65%)41–43 microsatellite markers. The higher polymorphic potential of Class I TFGMS and TFFDMS markers (39.4%) when compared with the Class II markers (29.4%) reflected the correspondence between the length of microsatellite repeats and level of polymorphism as observed earlier in many plant species.2,5,44 The microsatellites with longer repeat motifs have a tendency to be more polymorphic due to their high length-dependent replication slippage.20 Besides, high polymorphic potential of TFGMS markers derived from the UTRs than that from the conserved ORF, which are constrained by more purifying selection,3,5,44 suggested the utility of TF genes having such repeat motifs as a source of polymorphic microsatellite markers in chickpea. Higher polymorphic potential of UTR-derived TFGMS markers is expected due to an abundance of non-triplet microsatellite repeat motifs (57.7%), i.e. polymorphic class of di- and tetra-nucleotide motifs in the UTRs that are more prone to replication slippage. Overall, the hypervariable Class I and UTR-derived microsatellite markers designed in this study from the TF genes provided a strategy for the rapid selection of more polymorphic markers from the huge marker database and thus would have greater utility for large-scale validation and efficient genotyping applications in chickpea.The level of polymorphism detected by automated fragment analysis using 50 of each fluorescent dye-labelled TFGMS (39.7% polymorphism, PIC 0.53 and 1–8 alleles) and TFFDMS markers (34.3%, 0.43 and 1–6) was much higher than based on metaphor agarose gel with the normal unlabelled markers. However, the trend of polymorphism observed in Classes I and II fluorescent dye-labelled TFGMS and TFFDMS markers and desi and kabuli genotypes using the automated fragment analysis remained intact as obtained with the gel electrophoresis. The fluorescent dye-labelled TFGMS and TFFDMS markers overall detected 1–10 alleles (average 5 alleles) per marker locus (37.8% polymorphic, PIC 0.47), with a total of 196 alleles in 96 genotypes (Fig. 2B). The level of intra-specific polymorphism estimated above in desi and kabuli is comparable with the level reported previously with labelled EST-derived microsatellite markers (37%).7 With the use of automated fragment analyzer, all the allelic variants of TFGMS and TFFDMS markers could be captured efficiently that enabled to generate precise allele size-based genotyping information for 96 genotypes. The acquired genotypic information thus would enable multiplexing of genic TFGMS and TFFDMS markers and their utility in many large-scale and high-throughput genotyping applications in chickpea. Genetic analysis has been hindered in chickpea due to the lack of sufficient usable and robust sequence-based informative molecular markers and low intra-specific polymorphism specifically among desi and kabuli genotypes. Therefore, a large number of experimentally validated informative genic microsatellite markers with relatively high intra-specific polymorphic potential developed in our study would be useful in chickpea genetics, genomics and breeding. Moreover, the TF genes have utility in controlling diverse cellular processes, including plant growth, differentiation and developmental life cycles and environmental abiotic and biotic stress responses as well as domestication in plant species and legumes.16–18 These designed microsatellite markers, particularly being derived from the different functionally relevant sequence components of TF genes, thus could be useful as functional markers for rapidly establishing marker–trait linkages and identifying genes for many qualitative and quantitative traits of agricultural importance in chickpea.For determining the molecular basis of TFGMS and TFFDMS fragment length polymorphism, the size variant amplicons of 24 each TFGMS and TFFDMS markers from the selected genotypes were cloned and sequenced. The high-quality sequence analysis revealed the presence of expected microsatellite repeat-motif sequences with conserved primer binding sites, but variable numbers of repeat units in the size variant amplicons. However, the fragment size variation of sequenced alleles corresponded exactly to the differences in the number of repeat units and the step-wise multiples of the number of repeat units as well (Fig. 2A). Such fragment length polymorphism due to expansion/contraction of microsatellite repeat units have been observed previously in rice,3,45 maize,46 chickpea,41,47 sugarcane3,5 and Brassica.44 Specifically, in a selected set of 12 Type I TFFDMS markers, the fragment length polymorphism among the genotypes was explained by variation in the number of microsatellite repeat units and corresponded exactly to the expansion/contraction and step-wise multiples of the number of microsatellite repeats within the functional domains of TF genes (Fig. 2A). The association of genic microsatellite markers with many traits, including diseases like neuronal disorders and cancers in humans, based on the expansion/contraction of the repeated tracts of microsatellite encoding amino acid residues in the functional domain of proteins, has been well demonstrated.1 It would be thus interesting to understand the functional relevance of such designed TFFDMS markers based on their repeat expansion/contraction in the functional domain regions of TF genes for trait association analysis in chickpea.3.3. Physical mapping and genome coverage of TFGMS and TFFDMS markers in chickpeaOne thousand one hundred and forty-three (90.1%) of the 1243 TFGMS and TFFDMS markers developed from the TF genes showing an unique significant hit were physically mapped on the eight chickpea chromosomes (Supplementary Fig. S1 and Supplementary Table S3), with average map density of 303.8 kb. Maximum markers were physically mapped on the chromosome 4 (174 markers, 15.2%), followed by the chromosomes 1 (165, 14.4%), 5 (164, 14.3%) and 7 (163, 14.2%) and least on the chromosome 8 (84, 7.3%). The average marker density was maximum in the chromosome 8 (84 markers, 196.2 kb), followed by the chromosomes 3 (148 markers, 270.2 kb) and 4 (174 markers, 282.7 kb) and minimum in the chromosome 2 (91 markers, 402.5 kb). A high-density 1143 TFGMS and TFFDMS marker-based physical map constructed in our study could be used as a reference for the rapid selection of genic microsatellite markers at genome-wide scale/chromosomal level. It would be thus useful for rapid targeted mapping of genes/QTLs for useful traits, mapping the whole genome and sequencing of gene rich regions of the genome and eventually for comparative genome mapping across legumes.3.4. Understanding the population genetic structure and functional molecular diversity in chickpeaThe population genetic structure among the 96 genotypes based on 310 TFGMS and TFFDMS markers and 96 genomic microsatellite markers27 distributed over eight chickpea chromosomes/LGs using STRUCTURE with varying levels of K (K = 2–10) with 20 replications was determined (Supplementary Fig. S2). It revealed that, at K = 5, all the genotypes were classified into five distinct sub-populations grouped under three major model-based genetically distinct wild (I), desi (II) and kabuli (III) population (Supplementary Fig. S2B). At this K-value (K = 5), the best replicate gave maximum log-likelihood values with a sharp peak. The genotypes were grouped into five sub-populations at K = 5 with a high-resolution population structure that corresponded well with their expected pedigree relationships and parentage. Based on the population genetic structure analysis, 96 genotypes used in the study were classified into five distinct sub-populations (Supplementary Fig. S2B and Supplementary Table S1): Groups I (four wild genotypes and two kabuli landraces), IIa (23 desi varieties/genetic stocks/breeding lines and five desi landraces), IIb (18 desi landraces and six desi varieties/genetic stocks/breeding lines), IIIa (15 kabuli varieties/genetic stocks/breeding lines) and IIIb (15 kabuli landraces, three kabuli varieties/genetic stocks/breeding lines and five desi landraces). The genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationships established by the genic markers in most of the selected desi, kabuli and wild genotypes were in accordance with the expectation based on pedigree relationships. This is also comparable with earlier documentation using the random48 and microsatellite43,49 markers and more recently employing a larger set of genome-wide SNP and InDel markers.24 The close evolutionary relationships of domesticated desi and kabuli with its wild progenitor C. reticulatum have already been reported by different morphological,50 cytological,51 biochemical52 and molecular studies.41,43,49–56 Therefore, the microsatellite markers developed from the TF genes might assay more relevant transcribed sequence components of the chickpea genome for establishing distinctness and assaying functional diversity among the genotypes and thus, would be useful in chickpea breeding, including variety identification and understanding the diversity pattern.Population structure is also an indicator of genetic differentiation among population groups comprising of many genotypes. The molecular genetic variation among and within the five sub-populations (three desi, kabuli and wild populations) based on 310 polymorphic TFGMS and TFFDMS markers and 96 genomic microsatellite markers revealed a wider level of quantitative genetic differentiation (FST varied from 0.03 to 0.82 with an average of 0.53) among these population groups. This is higher than the previously detected level with the EST-derived (0.03–0.4910) and genomic (0.37–0.8041 and 0.32–0.8042) microsatellite markers. Among three population groups, the divergence was maximum between kabuli and wild (FST = 0.61) and minimum between desi and kabuli (0.29). The proportion of FST and thus diversity between population groups (53%) were higher when compared with that estimated within the population (36%), which is expected in a self-pollinated crop species like chickpea. Higher population genetic differentiation within desi (FST 0.39), in contrast to kabuli, (FST 0.30) agrees well with the earlier observations.43,49 The TFGMS and TFFDMS markers developed from the TF genes assaying variation largely in the expressed component of the genome might be directly correlated with phenotypic variation and thus would be of much relevance in the selection of desirable plant types in breeding programme. Henceforth, a wider genetic base and functional molecular diversity detected by the genic markers among desi and kabuli genotypes would be of significance in the perspective of varietal improvement in chickpea.All the 96 genotypes clearly belonged to a single population in which ~91.7% of their inferred ancestry was derived from one of the model-based population and remaining ~8.3% contained admixed ancestry (Supplementary Fig. S2B). The existence of admix ancestry among five sub-populations (three population groups) reflected their complex breeding history involving inter-crossing and introgression among genotypes coupled with different strong adaptive selection pressure during domestication. This is expected because most of the desi and kabuli genotypes analysed in this study were developed through multiple-crosses, mostly three-way crosses among diverse selected germplasm accessions by the joint effort of International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) and National Agricultural Research systems (NARS) for widening the genetic base and improving the stress tolerance. For instance, ICC12968/ICCV2, a short-duration kabuli chickpea variety showing an admixture of desi population groups has been developed from a multiple inter-cross involving five parental desi and kabuli genotypes [(K850 × GW-5/7) × P458] × (L550 × Guamuchil) for Fusarium wilt resistance and adaptation to short-duration environment of Southern and Central India.Maximum admixtures obtained between desi and kabuli population groups (5%) supported well with the commonly accepted presumption that the large seed-size domesticated kabuli types originated from the small seed-size domesticated desi chickpea.53 About 3% admixed ancestry between wild C. reticulatum and desi population groups and their evolutionary closeness is thus expected due to the resemblance of seed morphology between desi and wild progenitor (C. reticulatum) of domesticated chickpea at the archaeological sites of South Eastern Turkey nearly ~10 000 years ago.54–56 An admixed ancestry of ~0.3% between kabuli and wild population groups indicated that domesticated kabuli possibly originated directly from the spontaneous mutants of wild C. reticulatum in ancient South Eastern Turkey with a separate independent evolutionary pathway as suggested by the earlier archeobotanical,57 mutant53 and microsatellite marker-based58 evolutionary studies involving wild and kabuli genotypes. A higher admixture between the desi and wild population when compared with that between the desi and kabuli population groups might be attributed to maximum adaptation-based selection pressure during the multiple domestication of pre-adapted desi and wild C. reticulatum followed by the punctuation of a series of four sequential evolutionary bottlenecks that have narrowed down the genetic base in cultivated chickpea.53,54,59,60 However, complete understanding about the genetic structure, domestication and evolutionary history of desi, kabuli and wild chickpea populations would require analysis of a greater number of contrasting genotypes belonging to each of these three population groups using high-throughput marker genotyping information.3.5. Genetic association potential of TFGMS and TFFDMS markersThe microsatellite marker-based trait association mapping has proven to be an effective approach for dissecting the complex quantitative traits in many plant species, including legumes.61–64 Genetic association analysis was performed by correlating the genotyping data of 310 informative TFGMS and TFFDMS markers and 96 genomic microsatellite markers with the phenotypic information of three major seed and pod traits on the 96 association mapping panel. Higher phenotypic variation was observed in the case of 100-seed weight (5–70 g), pod number per plant (20–130) and seed number per plant (32–198) based on the multi-location replicated field data. The phenotypically and genotypically (based on population structure) diverse association mapping panels selected in our study is a structured population, thus having significance for seed and pod trait-specific association analysis in chickpea. The combined results of GLM and MLM in TASSEL identified 23 TFFDMS and 21 TFGMS markers in the 34 TF genes, showing a significant association with 100-seed weight, pod number per plant and seed number per plant at P-value of =0.05 and R2 from 0.18 to 0.37 (Supplementary Table S2). However, none of the 96 genomic microsatellite markers distributed over eight chickpea LGs/chromosomes (used as controls) exhibited any significant seed and pod trait-specific association. It reflects the robustness, including reliability and utility of genic microsatellite markers, identified in the TF genes for trait association analysis in chickpea. Ten TFFDMS and nine TFGMS markers in the 12 TF genes revealed association with all the three seed and pod traits, whereas 13 TFFDMS and 12 TFGMS markers in the 22 genes had association with a single trait only. The significant association of multiple microsatellite markers in more than one TF genes distributed over eight chickpea chromosomes with multiple seed and pod traits provides clues for the complex quantitative genetic inheritance pattern of traits65 under study. In spite of low polymorphic potential, particularly 23 TFFDMS markers in the 22 TF genes showed higher seed and pod trait-specific association potential (significant P = 0.001 and R2 0.23–0.38) in chickpea genotypes when compared with that obtained using the 21 TFGMS markers (P 0.01–0.05 and R2 0.18–0.31) in the 12 genes. Based on these observations, it is possible that the varied trait association potential estimated for TFGMS and TFFDMS markers are due to their presence in different TF genes. Henceforth, for better understanding and comparing the potential of these two genic marker types in trait association analysis in chickpea, the five seed and pod trait-associated TF genes carrying both polymorphic nine TFGMS and five TFFDMS markers were analysed in detail (Table 1). The above similar trend depicting the higher efficiency of four TFFDMS markers in contrast to eight TFGMS markers in four TF genes for the seed and pod trait association in chickpea genotypes was observed (Table 1). Interestingly, the remaining one TFGMS marker (P < 0.0024 and R2 0.31) in domain of unknown function (DUF)1635 TF gene showed higher seed and pod trait association potential in contrast to one TFFDMS marker (P < 0.047 and R2 0.23) in the functional domain of similar gene (Table 1). This ascertains a strategy to select the target sequence components of genes that are functionally more relevant for developing genic microsatellite markers for rapid trait association analysis in chickpea. Several recent reports have documented the diverse trait association potential of functional marker loci developed from different coding and UTR sequence components of a gene like starch biosynthesis66 and grain size (GS367 and GS561) genes in rice. Therefore, the selections of suitable marker loci from the different sequence components of target genes are always crucial for evaluating the definite potential of genes for trait association mapping. Functional significance of TFGMS and TFFDMS markers designed from the five TF genes showed association with seed and pod traits in chickpeaaValidated through traditional bi-parental genetic mapping.Functional significance of TFGMS and TFFDMS markers designed from the five TF genes showed association with seed and pod traits in chickpeaaValidated through traditional bi-parental genetic mapping.The detail structural and functional annotation of five seed and pod trait-associated TFs were performed to identify their downstream structural gene targets in chickpea. Using the AGRIS regulatory network database (AtRegNet, http://arabidopsis.med.ohio-state.edu), the direct interactions of three seed and pod trait-associated chickpea TF genes [Teosinte branched 1/cycloidea/proliferating cell factors (TCP) squamosa-promoter-binding protein (SBP) and DUF702] with MCM1-agamous-deficiens-serum response factor (MADS) TFs, including SEPALLATA3 and AGL15, that are conserved in Arabidopsis were clearly evident. Among all MADS TF genes, the role of AGL15 has already been experimentally validated in controlling the downstream targets (LEAFY COTYLEDON2, FUSCA3 and ABA INSENSITIVE3) encoding B3 domain TFs, which are the key regulators of embryogenesis during seed development in Arabidopsis.18,68,693.6. Intra-specific functional transcript map of chickpeaFor the construction of intra-specific genetic linkage map (transcript map), 74 TFMS and 22 FDMS markers one in each 96 TF genes and 32 previously reported genomic microsatellite markers27 showing parental polymorphism between desi (ICCX-810800) and kabuli (ICC20268) were genotyped among 94 individuals of a F3 mapping population. The linkage analysis of marker genotyping data mapped a total of 96 TFMS and FDMS marker loci carrying TF genes and 32 genomic microsatellite markers onto the eight LGs (CaLG1 to CaLG8, haploid chromosome numbers) of chickpea (Supplementary Fig. S3). The LGs were designated and numbered accordingly with Arabic numerals (LG1 to LG8) based on the common parental polymorphic 32 genomic microsatellite marker positions and groupings that shared between corresponding eight LGs as reported by previous studies.6–8,27,42,70 The transcript map constructed for eight LGs spanned a total map length of 782.8 cM with an average inter-marker distance of 6.12 cM (Supplementary Table S4). Based on genetic distance, the chromosome 8 showed shortest LG spanning of 78.7 cM, while the chromosome 1 had the longest LG with map length of 121.7 cM. The average inter-marker distance was maximum for chromosome 7 (6.75 cM), followed by chromosome 3 (6.67 cM), and minimum for chromosome 1 (5.07 cM). The average inter-marker distance estimated for the transcript map was comparable with that reported for previously constructed (1.77–8.01 cM) intra- and inter-specific genetic linkage maps of chickpea using a large number of genic and genomic microsatellite markers and a smaller set of SNP markers.6–8,42,70 The TFMS and FDMS markers carrying TF genes mapped genetically on the intra-specific transcript map would expedite large-scale genotyping applications, including the construction of high-density comparative genetic linkage (transcript) map and identification/mapping of genes/QTLs for important agronomic traits in chickpea.3.7. Validation of trait-associated TF genes through genetic mappingThe traditional bi-parental genetic mapping in a 96 F3 mapping population (ICCX-810800 × ICC20268) contrasting for seed weight (100-seed weight varied from 5.4 to 49.6 g) using the 96 informative TFGMS and TFFDMS markers and 32 genomic microsatellite markers was performed. An ANOVA revealed a significant difference of 100-seed weight (5.4–49.6 g) between the parental desi and kabuli genotypes and among segregating individuals. The frequency distribution of 100-seed weight (g) among 96 segregating individuals of a F3 mapping population depicted a goodness of fit to the normal distribution (Supplementary Fig. S4), and the phenotypic trait values of two parental genotypes also lied within the range that estimated for the entire mapping population. It thus indicated the quantitative inheritance pattern of seed traits under study in the developed mapping population and its utility in seed weight trait-specific bi-parental linkage mapping. The genetic mapping identified and mapped one major and significant (LOD threshold score >3.7) QTL region (phenotypic effect variance/R2 = 30.7%) on the chickpea LG1 governing the 100-seed weight/size (Supplementary Fig. S5). The target 1.7-cM QTL region (73.5–75.2 cM) identified for seed weight based on both interval mapping and composite interval mapping spanned with three TFFDMS and one TFGMS markers, thus having high seed weight trait-specific association potential in desi and kabuli based on genetic association mapping. Therefore, the four seed weight trait-specific TFFDMS and TFGMS markers in the ORF and 5' UTRs of TF genes validated both by traditional bi-parental linkage mapping and association mapping were selected further as the target candidate genes for controlling seed weight/size in desi and kabuli.3.8. Differential expression profiling and functional significance of TFGMS and TFFDMS markersTo derive correlation between association analysis and differential expression profiling, the seed and pod trait-specific 23 TFFDMS and 21 TFGMS markers associated 34 TF genes were validated in two different seed developmental stages of two contrasting small and large seed-size chickpea genotypes namely, ICCX-810800 and ICC20268 through semi-quantitative and quantitative RT-PCR. None of the TFFDMS and seven (33.3%) of the 21 TFGMS markers associated seven TF genes revealed differential expression during seed development in two contrasting chickpea genotypes by both semi-quantitative and quantitative RT-PCR. When we compared the differential expression pattern of both seed and pod trait-specific five TFFDMS and nine TFGMS markers associated five TF genes, none of the TFFDMS markers in these genes showed differential expression in seed developmental stages of two contrasting genotypes (Table 1). In contrast, differential expression for one of the TFGMS marker associated TF gene during seed development in two contrasting small and large seed-size genotypes was observed (Table 1). For instance, the TFFDMS marker containing (CAC)8 repeat motif in the SBP functional domain of a high 100-seed weight-associated (R2 0.38 and P < 0.0019) TF gene namely, SBP, did not show differential regulation in seed developmental stages of ICCX-810800 and ICC20268 (Supplementary Fig. S6A). In contrast, the TFGMS marker containing (CTA)6 repeat motif in the 5' UTR of seed weight/size-associated (R2 0.31 and P < 0.0024) DUF1635 TF gene revealed down-regulated expression (at least 3.5 times) specifically in seed developmental stages of a large seed-size kabuli genotype ICC20268 (Supplementary Fig. S6B and D). While in two seed developmental stages of a small seed-size desi genotype ICCX-810800, such TFGMS marker associated TF gene showed almost an equal level of expression. The higher association potential of TFGMS marker in the 5' UTR of the TF gene and their further correlation with differential down-regulated pattern of gene expression during seed development in two contrasting small and large seed-size genotypes suggested the functional relevance of such identified microsatellite markers in the TF genes for trait association in chickpea.The sequencing of cloned cDNA and genomic DNA amplicons from the seed and pod trait-associated five TF genes in ICCX-810800 and ICC20268 revealed the presence of expected microsatellite repeat-motif sequences. Interestingly, the amplicon sequences from the five TFFDMS markers associated five TF genes that did not show differential expression during seed development contained the variable number of microsatellite repeat units in the functional domains of these genes between ICCX-810800 and ICC20268. The amplicon sequences from the TFGMS markers of TF genes that did not show differential expression during seed development, including the one which revealed differential expression, contained varied microsatellite repeats between ICCX-810800 and ICC20268. The sequencing of amplicons from the TFFDMS marker of 100-seed weight-associated SBP TF gene contained the desired (CAC)8 repeat motif in the transcripts of ICCX-810800 as in ICC4958 from which the primers were designed (Supplementary Fig. S7A). Interestingly, the cDNA sequence alignment of such TFFDMS marker associated SBP TF gene between ICCX-810800 and ICC20268 showed the presence of variable number of repeat units like (CAC)8 and (CAC)10 in the SBP functional domain, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S7A). The comparison between cDNA and genomic DNA sequences from the 100-seed weight associated and differentially expressed TFGMS marker associated DUF1635 TF gene revealed the variable number of microsatellite repeats (CTA)6 and (CTA)8 between ICCX-810800 and ICC20268, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S8). The expansion and contraction of microsatellite repeats in the 5' UTRs of genes have significance in regulating gene expression for many traits including amylose content in rice,71 quality protein in maize72 and light and salicylic responses in Brassica.73 These findings thus inferred the significant correlation between the number of microsatellite repeat units in the different sequence components (functional domain and 5' UTR) of seed weight/size trait-specific TFFDMS and TFGMS associated TF genes and their differential expression in the genes preferentially with regard to seed development in contrasting chickpea genotypes. Understanding the adaptive and evolutionary significance of such TFFDMS and TFGMS repeat expansion/contraction in the functional domain and 5' UTRs of TF genes, respectively, is of relevance that needs further systematic experimentation by assaying a large number of contrasting chickpea genotypes of different tissues and/or stages (embryogenesis to maturation) of seed development.To further understand the functional significance of TFFDMS markers associated TF genes that are not showing differential expression during seed development, the high seed and pod trait-associated four TFFDMS markers showing fragment length polymorphism in the functional domains of four TF genes were selected (Table 1). The alteration of secondary protein structure and functional domain sites between the variant and native forms due to the presence of variable number of TFFDMS repeat units encoding the amino acid residues in the functional domains of four seed and pod trait-associated TF genes was observed (Supplementary Fig. S6B). For instance, the expansion of TFFDMS repeat motif from (CAC)8 in desi variety ICCX-810800 to (CAC)10 in kabuli variety ICC20268 encoding histidine amino acid residues in the DNA-binding functional domain of SBP TF gene created an altered secondary structure of protein (Supplementary Fig. S7B) and functional domain region that possibly affects the DNA binding and transcriptional activity of the target gene during developmental stages in chickpea. The altered transcriptional activity of SBP TF gene could be due to its differential sequence-specific DNA binding of all eight conserved cysteine/histidine amino acid residues (formed two separate novel zinc-binding sites) present in the DNA-binding domain with the recognition domains of promoter(s) of target gene(s).74 Differential DNA-binding selectivity of SBP TF towards consensus box in the target gene promoter due to alteration of conserved cysteine/histidine amino acid residues within the DNA-binding functional domain and their correlation with transcriptional activity during developmental process have been previously reported in many plant species, including Antirrhinum,75,76Arabidopsis,77 rice78,79 and tomato.80 Overall, the correspondence of higher trait association potential of TFFDMS markers with fragment length polymorphism due to the presence of variable number of TFFDMS repeat units encoding amino acid residues in the functional domain of TF genes and alteration of secondary structure of proteins and functional domain sites suggested the utility of these functional genetic markers for rapidly establishing marker–trait linkages and identifying genes/QTLs for many useful agronomic traits in chickpea.3.9. Gene-specific LD patterns in chickpeaUnderstanding the gene-specific LD pattern is of significance to determine the marker density required for association mapping of complex traits in a target plant population under study.81,82 For determining gene-specific LD estimates and extent of LD decay, the 32 SNP loci were identified in five seed and pod trait-associated TF genes among 96 chickpea genotypes based on cloned amplicon sequencing with an average SNP frequency of 1/297 bp. The nucleotide diversity (mean p = 4.7 × 10-3 bp) and frequency of Watterson's <U+03B8> level (mean <U+03B8> = 2.3 × 10-3) estimated for 32 SNP loci in the TF genes varied widely across the genotypes. Higher nucleotide diversity of the SNP loci within desi (-0.44) when compared with that of kabuli (-0.39) was evident from the test of Tajima's D neutrality pattern of nucleotide polymorphism. The haplotype analysis using the SNPs, TFGMS and TFFDMS marker genotyping data identified 10–21 haplotypes per gene amplicon resulting in higher haplotype-based PIC values among the genotypes that varied from 0.53 to 0.97 with an average of 0.74. The candidate gene-based association analysis by the inclusion of SNP and microsatellite marker-based haplotypes identified in the five TF genes revealed a strong association of these genes with the seed and pod traits studied at significant P = 0.001 and R2 from 0.38 to 0.45 (Table 1). The genetic association potential of TF genes estimated combining the SNP, TFGMS and TFFDMS marker-based haplotypes was much higher than that obtained using the individual TFGMS, TFFDMS and SNP markers (Table 1). The LD estimates (r2) and extent of LD decay using the all possible pair-combinations of marker haplotypes were determined within the seed and pod trait-associated five TF genes. In desi and kabuli population groups, an LD did not decay below r2 = 0.1 within the 700-bp sequenced region of all the five TF genes (Supplementary Fig. S9). However, an overall decreasing trend of LD decay in the genes with an increase in the sequenced region (bp) was observed. It indicated the direct correlation of LD patterning with physical linkage of markers on chromosomes and marker density required in these genes. The diverse desi population groups showed faster LD decay than that of kabuli in all the seed and pod trait-associated five TF genes. In spite of inclusion of higher number of combined SNP and microsatellite haplotypes, the varied LD decay observed in other four TF genes (TCP, NAC, DUF1635 and DUF702) indicates the effect of factors other than marker density like genetic diversity, population genetic structure, population admixture and adaptive selection on shaping the LD patterns in these genes. Remarkably, the overall trend of LD decay was directly correlated with association potential of five TF genes for seed and pod traits in chickpea. The genes showing a low degree of association potential decayed LD much faster/earlier with an increase in the sequenced region (bp) when compared with the genes having higher association potential (Supplementary Fig. S9). These observations broadly suggested that, with the inclusion of additional SNP loci identified in the TF genes and their corresponding two TFGMS and three TFFDMS marker alleles, a higher number of haplotype pairs could be produced which in turn enhanced the LD resolution and trait association potential of the genes.The SBP TF gene showing a strong genetic association with 100-seed weight/size did not decay its LD even across the 1000-bp sequenced region of desi and kabuli population. In 3000-bp sequenced amplicon of this TF gene (covering the ORF region), we identified the combinations of 11 synonymous SNP loci, 2 different alleles of TFGMS and 3 different alleles of TFFDMS polymorphic marker loci (Fig. 3A) across 96 chickpea genotypes that enabled to constitute a maximum of 21 haplotypes in this gene (Fig. 3B). The haplotype pair-based LD estimation displayed a significant LD, which persists at a high level (r2 > 0.15 and P < 0.0001) across the entire 3000-bp sequenced region of this gene (Fig. 3C). The feature of high LD estimates covering the complete ORF of such TF gene thus increased its overall potential for seed trait (100-seed weight/size) association (R2 0.45 and P < 0.0012) in chickpea (Table 1). Such microsatellite–SNP marker haplotype-based trait association analysis has already been implemented successfully for identification of genes/QTLs associated with infectious diseases in humans83 and seed shattering during rice domestication.84 Overall, these results suggested that the population genetic structure and marker density in the genes play a crucial role in LD patterning of TFs at the gene level in domesticated desi and kabuli. The genotyping of 13 polymorphic marker loci [11 and 1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of each TFFDMS and TFGMS markers] identified in different ORF and UTR sequence components of a high seed-size/weight-associated SBP TF gene (A) among 96 association mapping panel constituted 2 haplotypes in wild, 13 haplotypes in desi and 6 haplotypes in kabuli (B). The 21 haplotype marker-based genotyping information produced high LD estimates (r2 > 0.15 and P < 0.0001) covering the complete 3000-bp sequenced region of SBP TF gene (C) and thus enhanced its overall LD resolution. The specific haplotypes showing differentiation between small (ICCX-810800) and large (ICC20268) seed-size contrasting chickpea genotypes (B) were represented more in the 96 association mapping panel, which reemphasizes the strong potential of SBP TF for seed-size/weight-specific trait association.The genotyping of 13 polymorphic marker loci [11 and 1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of each TFFDMS and TFGMS markers] identified in different ORF and UTR sequence components of a high seed-size/weight-associated SBP TF gene (A) among 96 association mapping panel constituted 2 haplotypes in wild, 13 haplotypes in desi and 6 haplotypes in kabuli (B). The 21 haplotype marker-based genotyping information produced high LD estimates (r2 > 0.15 and P < 0.0001) covering the complete 3000-bp sequenced region of SBP TF gene (C) and thus enhanced its overall LD resolution. The specific haplotypes showing differentiation between small (ICCX-810800) and large (ICC20268) seed-size contrasting chickpea genotypes (B) were represented more in the 96 association mapping panel, which reemphasizes the strong potential of SBP TF for seed-size/weight-specific trait association.3.10. Possible haplotype-based evolutionary history of SBP TF genes during chickpea domesticationThe determination of step-wise haplotype sharing/changes in the genes among cultivated and wild species will have significance in understanding the evolutionary process of domestication of those target genes from ancestors to cultivated species. A set of 21 TFGMS–TFFDMS–SNP marker haplotypes identified in a high seed weight-associated SBP TF gene among desi, kabuli and wild population groups gave clues to study the hypothetical evolutionary history of SBP gene during chickpea domestication. It implied that three SNPs (mutations) and two microsatellite repeat expansion (constituting two haplotypes) in wild, two SNPs, three microsatellite repeat expansion/contraction and three recombination events among nine SNPs (13 haplotypes) in desi, and four SNPs and two microsatellite repeat expansion (six haplotypes) in kabuli, were adequate to explain the natural variation of SBP TF gene in chickpea (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S10). It also implied that the seed weight/size-associated TFFDMS alleles might be fixed in the SBP gene haplotypes of domesticated desi and kabuli chickpea as pre-existing natural variation from wild C. reticulatum. The seed weight/size-associated haplotypes, including the TFFDMS alleles, that differentiated the contrasting small seed-size desi from large seed-size kabuli based on the variation of TFFDMS repeats in the functional domain of SBP gene was represented mostly (89) among 96 genotypes under study. This ascertained the higher association potential of SBP TF gene for seed weight/size in chickpea. Maximum sharing of desi particularly the seed weight-associated contrasting small seed-size ICCX-810800-specific haplotypes (21) and TFFDMS alleles (16) with wild C. reticulatum was evident (Supplementary Fig. S10). It is supported well with the earlier reports on the resemblance and evolutionary closeness of small seed-size morphology between desi and wild C. reticulatum. In contrast, the sharing of kabuli particularly the seed weight/size-associated contrasting large seed-size ICC20268-specific haplotypes (16) and TFFDMS alleles (14) was more with desi when compared to that with wild. It gave clues that the divergence between kabuli and desi is much recent when compared with that between desi and wild progenitor C. reticulatum.The occurrence of nucleotide polymorphisms, seed weight/size-associated TFFDMS repeat expansion/contraction and recombination events in the haplotypes of SBP gene among desi, kabuli and wild reflected that the strong artificial selection has played a major role during domestication of this gene towards assortment of more preferential seed weight/size traits in chickpea. This is in agreement with earlier archeological, phenotypic and molecular phylogeny studies53,54,59,60 that describe that the chickpea domestication (~10 000 years) might have led through population bottlenecks during their evolutionary transition from wild C. reticulatum by the occurrence of spontaneous mutation, recombination and fixation. Such newly occurring changes would have become fixed through propagation in cultivated chickpea, which is self-pollinated in nature. The higher microsatellite expansion/contraction of seed weight/size-associated TFFDMS alleles and recombination among SNPs within the haplotypes of SBP TF gene attributed to more seed weight/size-specific haplotype diversity in desi in contrast to kabuli. It could have resulted from artificial selection and modern breeding efforts (inter-specific hybridization/introgression of small seed-size desi with large seed-size kabuli) continuously practiced during the genetic improvement of desi for different seed-size characteristics particularly for a large seed-size trait, which is of a high consumer preference and trade value. The molecular marker-based haplotyping in the SBP TF gene overall gave clues to understand the possible evolutionary pathway of the target gene in domesticated desi, kabuli and wild chickpea and the consequence of their natural variations on seed-size/weight-specific trait evolution during chickpea domestication. Therefore, the seed-size/weight supposed to represent an important component of domestication trait in chickpea. However, the complete understanding of evolutionary history of such seed-size/weight-associated SBP TF gene during chickpea domestication needs further systematic experimentation by assaying high-throughput marker genotyping information in a larger set of contrasting genotypes at the genome and gene level.4. ConclusionsA larger set of experimentally validated TFGMS and TFFDMS markers with relatively high intra-specific polymorphic potential developed from the TF genes will have immense use in large-scale genotyping applications, including construction of high-density physical and functional transcript map as well as understanding the population genetic structure and functional molecular diversity in chickpea. The functional relevance of these informative genic markers was demonstrated by integrating seed and pod trait association analysis with genetic mapping, differential expression profiling, protein modelling and haplotype gene evolution study in relation to selected five TF genes, thereby suggesting the utility of markers in many aspects of chickpea breeding and genetic analysis.Supplementary dataSupplementary Data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support by the Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Government of India.

IntroductionDirected evolution methods are increasingly employed to improve properties of an enzyme, including substrate specificity, activity, thermostability, high-temperature activity.1–4 Success of directed protein evolution hinges on the efficiency in creating mutagenesis libraries and screening the libraries for the desired protein properties.5 The library diversity is a key parameter and various protocols have been developed to achieve the goal of making high-quality mutagenesis libraries.5 Random mutagenesis coupled to high-throughput screening6 has become a powerful tool for both basic study on the structure–function relationship of proteins and development of novel proteins with desired properties.Many methods used for directed evolution of enzymes were reviewed by Lutz and Patrick.7In vitro mutagenesis approaches have been described in both polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based and non-PCR-based categories.8 One of the most commonly used methods is error-prone mutagenic PCR,9 which introduces random mutations by reducing the fidelity of the DNA polymerase. Early techniques of error-prone PCR generally involved the following steps: (i) amplifying the target gene under error-prone conditions to generate randomly mutated sequences; (ii) digesting the ends of the amplified DNA fragment with restriction endonucleases; (iii) ligating the digested DNA fragment into a suitable expression vector with DNA ligase and (iv) transforming the ligated vector into a suitable host cell to obtain a mutant library. This process is similar to standard PCR cloning of a target sequence except that, for constructing a diverse mutagenesis library, a much larger pool of transformants are needed to increase the diversity of the library, making the process tedious and inefficient. As a result, various methods have been developed to streamline the process.Previously reported procedures for whole-plasmid, mutagenic PCR using the entire plasmid as template and back-to-back primer set resulted in linear DNA products, necessitating a separate ligation step to generate circular plasmids before transforming the host cell.10,11 MegaWHOP uses mutated target sequence as the PCR primer (Megaprimers), expression vector harbouring the wild-type gene as the template, and a high-fidelity DNA polymerase to produce whole length of plasmid.12,13 However, the process mainly yields linear single-strand DNA (ssDNA), which is released from its circular template at the denaturation step during PCR. Only some of the ssDNA strands can anneal to form nicked circular double-strand DNA (dsDNA) to be directly transformed without subsequent ligation step (Step iii mentioned above). In addition, the newly extended, linear ssDNA cannot serve as a template to achieve exponential amplification. Finally, the procedure depends on methylation of template DNA and later on digestion of methylated DNA by DpnI, which degrades the methylated plasmid template, before the mutated plasmid products are transformed.To obtain nick-free, circular plasmid production by PCR and improve the efficiency of random mutagenesis or directed evolution, we report a novel method designated as ‘thermostable DNA ligase-mediated PCR production of circular plasmid’ (PPCP) for applications in directed evolution via in situ error-prone PCR. The PPCP method employs a long dsDNA primer pair to amplify the entire template plasmid. The dsDNA primer pair is designed to carry a selection marker different from the original selection marker of the template plasmid. Transformants are plated under the pressure of the new selection marker, resulting in the elimination of the original template plasmid without the need to pretreat the DNA with DpnI. Furthermore, thermostable DNA ligase from Thermotoga maritima (Tma DNA ligase), which we previously reported,14 is employed to ligate the nick of the newly extended DNA strand, resulting in the formation of circular plasmid DNA as the amplification product that could directly be transformed. When Taq DNA polymerase is used under error-prone conditions, the method generates random mutagenesis libraries in a fast and efficient manner. By using this method, we performed directed evolution on XynA (xylanase A) from Thermomyces lanuginosus and CelA (cellulase A), CelB (cellulase B) from T. maritima. The results demonstrated that in situ error-prone PPCP is an efficient random mutagenesis method for directed evolution of genes and proteins.2. Materials and methods2.1. Bacterial strains, plasmids and growth mediaThermotoga maritima (ATCC43589) was grown anaerobically at 80°C in a medium described previously.15Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) was used as the host for gene cloning. Escherichia coli was cultured in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium which contained (per litre): 10 g Tryptone, 5 g yeast extract, 5 g NaCl, pH 7, and supplemented with 100 µg/ml ampicillin or 50 µg/ml kanamycin for selection. The Hsh (heat shock) system of expression vectors was employed for PPCP tests, which contains an Hsh promoter recognizable by an alternative sigma factor (s32) of E. coli, and the expression of foreign genes was induced by a temperature up-shift.162.2. Generating long complementary primer pair for swapping plasmid selection maker by PPCPThe complementary PPCP primer pair containing the kanamycin resistance gene (884 bp) used in the experiment shown in Fig. 2 was generated by regular PCR using the plasmid pET-28a(+) as template. The regular PCR primers were KanFwd, 5'-CCCTGATAAATGCTTCAATAATATTGAAAAAGGAAGAGTATGAGCCATATTCAACGGG-3', and KanRev, 5'-ATCAATCTAAAGTATATATGAGTAAACTTGGTCTGAC AGTTAGAAAAACTCATCGAGC-3' (italicized DNA sequences complementary to the flanking sequences of the ampicillin gene (863 bp) in the PPCP template pHsh described below; underlined DNA sequences complementary to the kanamycin resistance gene from pET-28a(+)). PCR was performed in 50 µl reaction solution containing 1.25 U Pyrobest DNA polymerase (TaKaRa) for 30 cycles, each cycle consisting of incubation at 94°C for 40 s, 52°C for 40 s and 72°C for 1 min 10 s. The 894 bp dsDNA fragment generated was subsequently used as PPCP primer pair for amplifying whole pHsh plasmid DNA as described below.2.3. Amplification of whole pHsh plasmid DNA by PPCP with simultaneous selection maker swappingThe PPCP experiment shown in Fig. 2 was performed in 20 µl reaction solution containing 50 ng pHsh-Amp (2.44 kb) as template, 0.5 U Taq DNA polymerase (TaKaRa), 0.1 µg/µl Tma DNA ligase,14 80 ng PPCP primer pair prepared by PCR as described above, 0.2 mM each deoxynucleotide triphosphate, 2.0 mM MgCl2 and 0.5 mM NAD+. PCR was performed for 25 cycles with each cycle consisting of incubation at 94°C for 30 s (denaturation), 62°C for 30 s (annealing), 72°C for 1.5 min (extension) and 60°C for 2 min (ligation).2.4. Preparation of long primer pair from pHsh for in situ error-prone PPCP mutagenesisTo amplify the entire pHsh expression vector by regular PCR for preparing the long primer pair used for the PPCP experiment shown in Fig. 4, the following regular PCR primers were used: pHshRev 5'- pCCTCCATGGGTATATCTCCTT-3' and pHshFwd 5'-pAAGCTTGAAGGCCGCTTCCGA-3'. The plasmid pHsh-kan (GenBank accession no. FJ571621) or pHsh-amp (GenBank accession no. FJ571619) was used as template. PCR of 30 cycles was performed in 50 µl of reaction solution containing 1.25 U Pyrobest DNA polymerase (TaKaRa), each cycle consisting of incubation at 94°C for 30 s, 54°C for 30 s and 72°C for 2 min.2.5. In situ error-prone PPCP mutagenesisError-prone PPCP was performed in 20 µl reaction solution containing 30 ng plasmid pHsh-xynA1, pHsh-celA or pHsh-celB (see below for their preparations) as template as described in the above, 0.5 U Taq DNA polymerase (TaKaRa), 0.1 µg/µl Tma DNA ligase,14 200 ng PPCP primer pair from pHsh described above, 0.2 mM each deoxynucleotide triphosphate, 2.0 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM MnCl2 and 0.5 mM NAD+. Each cycle consisted of heating at 94°C for 1 min, annealing and extension at 72°C for 1.5 min and ligation at 60°C for 2 min.2.6. Construction of plasmids pHsh-celA, pHsh-celB and pHsh-xynA1Endoglucanase gene celA was amplified by PCR using the genomic DNA of T. maritima as template and the following primers: 5'-CTGTGGTACTGATGACAAAACCGGGAACATC-3' and 5'-GGGAAGCTTTCATTCTCTCACCTCCAGATC-3'. The amplicon was inserted into expression vector pHsh-amp at Stu<U+0406>/Hind<U+0428> sites to generate plasmid pHsh-celA. Endoglucanase gene celB of T. maritima was similarly amplified using primers 5'-CTAGCGTTGGTGCAACGGAC-3' and 5'-GGGCTCGAGTTATTTTACAACTTCGACAG-3', and cloned into pHsh-amp at Stu<U+0406>/Xho<U+0406> sites, resulting in pHsh-celB. pHsh-xynA1 was generated by cloning the xynA1 from Thermomyces lanuginosus as previously described.172.7. Screening xylanase and cellulase random mutant librariesMutant libraries of celA, celB and xynA1, respectively, were constructed by in situ error-prone mutagenic PPCP as described above. The resulting mutant libraries were transformed into E. coli by electroporation and screened for xylanase or cellulase activity by overlay assays. For detecting xylanase activity, E. coli colonies were overlaid with LB top agar containing 2% xylan and kanamycin (50 µg/ml), incubated at 30°C overnight and then the temperature shifted to 42°C for 5–6 h to induce gene expression. Positive clones were identified by a clear zone surrounding xylanase-expressing colonies. Cellulase activity was similarly detected as follows. Escherichia coli colonies were overlaid with LB top agar containing 2% carboxymethylcellulose (CMC, Sigma) and kanamycin (50 µg/ml). After incubation at 30°C overnight, the temperature was shifted to 42°C for 5–6 h to induce gene expression. Positive clones were identified by a depressed zone surrounding cellulase-expressing colonies.2.8. Cellulase activity assayCell lysates from cells harbouring a cellulase gene were prepared by sonication and used as the source of cellulase. The mutant and wild-type enzyme preparations were prepared from the same amount of cells. For cellulase assay, reducing sugars released from CMC by the cellulase activity in the cell lysate were quantified by using the 4-hydroxybenzoic acid hydrazide method.18 The reaction mixture comprises 100 µl of 0.5% (w/v) CMC in water, 90 µl of phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 6.0) and 10 µl of properly diluted enzyme. After incubation at 90°C for 10 min, the reaction was stopped by adding 600 µl of 4-hydroxybenzoic acid hydrazide solution to the reaction mixture. The test tubes were incubated for 10 min in boiling water and chilled on ice. Reducing sugars were determined by measuring optical density at 410 nm using a spectrophotometer. One unit of cellulase activity is defined as the amount of enzyme releasing 1 µmol/ml reducing sugars using glucose as the standard.3. Results3.1. Swapping plasmid selection marker by thermostable DNA ligase-mediated PPCPPCR is a powerful method to amplify linear DNA fragments, which consists of repeated cycles of denaturation–annealing–elongation. Recently, we reported that adding a ligation step mediated by thermostable Thermotoga maritima (Tma) DNA ligase to form the repeated cycles of ‘denaturation–annealing–elongation–ligation’ enhances the amplification of long DNA fragment.14 In both cases, the resulting PCR products are linear DNA. Here we describe that Tma thermostable DNA ligase can be employed in a new design for PCR amplification of circular plasmids. The procedure for thermostable DNA ligase-mediated PPCP is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1. In this method, circular PCR products are generated by using a long complementary primer pair, which can be generated by regular PCR or synthesized, to extend over a circular template, followed by DNA ligation of the resultant nick between the 3' end of the newly extended strand and the 5' end of the primer. Furthermore, if the complementary primer set is designed to contain a second selection marker, the resulting plasmid product will harbour this new marker (Fig. 1). The template plasmid carrying the original marker is eliminated when transformed host cells are cultured under the second selection pressure, eliminating the need of digesting PCR products with a methylated DNA-specific restriction enzyme mentioned above. The ability to swap the selection marker facilitates multiple rounds of mutagenesis and selection as will be discussed below. Schematic of swapping selection marker of a plasmid by thermostable DNA ligase-mediated PPCP. The white boxed-region of the template plasmid (Vector 1) represents the original selection marker, which after the whole-plasmid PCR is replaced by a second selection marker built in the double-stranded PPCP primers (the black boxed-region in the primers and Vector 2). The procedure features the incorporation of a thermostable ligation step into the standard PCR procedure to ligate the nick remaining in the extended DNA strand, resulting in nick-free, circular plasmid DNA products. At the end of the PCR cycles, the template plasmid is eliminated by plating the plasmid-transformed host cells under the second selection pressure.Schematic of swapping selection marker of a plasmid by thermostable DNA ligase-mediated PPCP.

At the end of the PCR cycles, the template plasmid is eliminated by plating the plasmid-transformed host cells under the second selection pressure.To demonstrate the PPCP and marker swapping concepts, we used a 2.44 kb plasmid, pHsh-amp, harbouring the ampicillin-resistant gene (ampr) as the PPCP template. The PPCP primer pair was a linear 894 bp dsDNA fragment generated by standard PCR using pET-28a(+) as template as described in Materials and methods. The PPCP primer pair thus prepared harboured the kanamycin-resistant gene (kanr) flanked by regions (39 bp each) complementary to the flanking sequences of ampr in pHsh-amp. The PPCP primer pair was thus able to amplify the entire pHsh while simultaneously swapping the selection marker from Ampr to Kanr as illustrated in Fig. 1.PPCP was carried out with 25 cycles each consisting of denaturation of double-stranded template and DNA primer pair, annealing of primers to the respective complementary regions of the template extension of each primer over the template sequence, and ligation of the nick between the 3' end of the newly extended strand to the 5' end of the primer. The ligation step took advantage of the thermostable nature of Tma DNA ligase,14 allowing the enzyme to maintain its activity during multiple heating steps of PCR at 94°C and resulting in a nick-free, circular plasmid product ready to serve as a template in the subsequent PPCP cycles.To verify that nick-free, circular DNA plasmids were obtained, the PPCP products were analysed by electrophoresis on 1.0% agarose gel. As shown in Fig. 2, the double-stranded PPCP primer pair ran faster than the circular template pHsh DNA (lane 1). When Tma DNA ligase was not included in the amplification reaction, PCR DNA product ran slower than the circular plasmid DNA, which is presumed to be linear DNA product (lane 2). In contrast, with the inclusion of Tma DNA ligase in the amplification mixture (PPCP), the DNA product appears to be circular as it migrated to the same position as the circular template pHsh-amp DNA (lane 3), demonstrating that PPCP is capable of producing nick-free, circular DNA products. Furthermore, E. coli cells transformed by the PPCP amplification product were able to grow on LB plates containing kanamycin (data not shown), demonstrating successful swapping of the antibiotic selection marker.

The size of the PPCP primer pair was 962 bp.To demonstrate the important role of Tma DNA ligase in PPCP, we studied the effect of varying the amount of Tma DNA ligase on generating circular amplification product. We again observed that, without Tma DNA ligase, no circular DNA product was obtained (lane 1, Fig. 3). In contrast, an increasing amount of circular DNA product was obtained with increasing amount of Tma DNA ligase added to the reaction mixture (lanes 2–5, Fig. 3), indicating the need to determine the sufficient amount of DNA ligase required for optimal ligation to compensate for enzyme inactivation at high temperature during the denaturation step of the cycle.

Since mutagenesis occurs in situ during the PCR reaction, eliminating the need of a separate process for generating or sub-cloning mutant DNA, we designated the procedure as in situ error-prone PPCP. In addition, since the extended DNA strand is ligated and serves as the template for the next round of amplification, mutations can accumulate over the subsequent PCR cycles. Furthermore, the target gene or gene segment can precisely be chosen by proper design of the long PPCP primer pair. Finally, the ability to swap a selection marker in PPCP facilitates the removal of the template plasmid during multiple rounds of mutagenesis. The in situ error-prone mutagenic PPCP can be coupled to a screening or selection procedure, facilitating directed evolution of the target gene or protein.Figure 4 depicts the procedure of in situ error-prone PPCP. The target gene is cloned into the first vector carrying a selection marker, which serves as template. A second vector, which is the same as the first vector except for the selection marker and missing the DNA segment to be mutagenized, is linearized by regular PCR and serves as PPCP primer pair.

(c and d) The process of (a) and (b) can be repeated for multiple rounds of PPCP mutagenesis, marker selection and functional screening.To experimentally demonstrate the in situ error-prone PPCP concept, we chose a pair of identical expression vectors comprising different selection markers. Expression plasmid pHsh-xynA1 was constructed by cloning the xylanase gene (xynA1) from T. lanuginosus into vector pHsh-amp and used as the PPCP template. To generate the PPCP primer pair, a linear segment of pHsh-kan was amplified by regular PCR using pHshFwd and pHshRev PCR primers designed to amplify the entire pHsh-kan except for the multiple cloning sites. Error-prone PPCP using Taq DNA polymerase in the presence of Mn2+, Tma DNA ligase and the PPCP primer pair from pHsh-kan was performed over the xynA1 region of pHsh-xynA1 template (Fig. 4).The resulting PPCP products were analysed by agarose gel electrophoresis on 1.0% agarose gel (Fig. 5A). Again, circular DNA molecules were observed only when Tma DNA ligase was added (lane 3). Transformants of circular PPCP products were obtained by selection on LB plates containing kanamycin. The xylanase activity of the transformants was determined by the xylan-overlay assay. The clear zones around colonies indicate active clones (Fig. 5B). The size of the clear zone reflects the relative activity of the mutant while the lack of it indicates null mutation.

Directed evolution of cellulase genes by in situ error-prone PPCP mutagenesisWe used in situ error-prone PPCP to improve the activities of two cellulases from T. maritima. The T. maritima celA and celB genes were individually cloned into expression vector pHsh-amp to generate pHsh-celA and pHsh-celB as described in Materials and methods. With each of these two plasmids serving as template, the same primer pair from pHsh-kan described above was used to construct random mutagenesis libraries by in situ error-prone PPCP. The amplification was performed over celA and celB using Taq DNA polymerase in the presence of 0.1 mM Mn2+ and Tma DNA ligase. The amplification products were transformed into competent E. coli cells, and the mutant libraries screened on the LB plates containing kanamycin and CMC. Colonies producing larger depressed zones than wild-type transformants were identified as positive mutant clones displaying higher cellulase activities (see Fig. 5C showing plate of celB mutants).Approximately 2000 celA and celB clones were screened. The positive mutants were further cultured at 30°C and then 42°C. A positive mutant of celA, designated as celA-m1, exhibited 4.4 U/ml cellulase activity while the wild-type strain exhibited 2.9 U/ml activity when cells were grown under the same culture condition to the same cell density (OD600 = 3.2). DNA sequence analysis revealed that celA-m1 contained five-point mutations, but only one non-synonymous codon change that resulted in the substitution of serine (TCC) for phenylalanine (TTC) at residue 102 (F102S). On the other hand, the synonymous (silent) mutations occurred at amino acid positions L203 (CTT <U+2192> CTA), L222 (CTT <U+2192> CTC), G234 (GGA <U+2192> GGT) and A241 (GCA <U+2192> GCT). A positive mutant of celB, designated as celB-m1, produced cellulase activity of 3.88 U/ml while the wild-type strain produced 0.89 U/ml under the same culture conditions. DNA sequence analysis revealed a single-point alteration at codon 61, H61L (CAT <U+2192> CTT). These results confirm the in situ error-prone PPCP procedure in being able to rapidly mutate a target gene.4. DiscussionTma DNA ligase from the hyperthermophilic bacterium T. maritima has a half-life of over 30 min at 95°C and thus is an ideal DNA ligase for PCRs.14Tma DNA ligase requires NAD+, and a divalent cation such as Mg2+, Mn2+ or Ca2+. Therefore, the ligase activity is enhanced when Mn2+ is added to the reaction mixture, which has an added benefit of increasing the mutation rate of error-prone PCR. Our finding that Mn2+ increased the rate of null mutation (Table 1) is consistent with the error rate of Taq polymerase being dependent on the concentration of the cation. It is of note that Tma DNA ligase exhibits activity on DNA fragments with cohesive termini, but not on blunt-ended DNA molecules. Thus the ligase is unable to ligate the double-stranded PPCP primer pairs used in the reaction.In conventional mutagenic PCR employing Taq DNA polymerase under error-prone conditions, the PCR products have single-base overhangs at the 3' end of each strand,19 which often needs to be removed or filled-in before cloning. In addition, mutant DNA fragments must be digested and ligated to a vector to obtain a mutant library.13,20–22 Low efficiency of the digestion and ligation steps is a common challenge, and the library is often plagued with plasmids with no or multiple inserts.23 In the in situ error-prone PPCP method described here, thermostable DNA ligase repairs the nick, forming a nick-free, circular plasmid and circumventing many of the issues associated with conventional mutagenic PCR.The double-stranded PPCP primer pair can be synthesized by conventional PCR. Specifically, a pair of conventional PCR primers can be designed to amply the corresponding region of an expression vector, which comprises the central region harbouring the selection marker, and the flanking regions of the cloning site. This dsDNA PCR product can be used as the primer pair in subsequent in situ error-prone mutagenic PPCP. For the experiments reported in this work, the primer pairs were amplified by a high-fidelity polymerase such as Pyrobest or Pfu DNA. The primer pair should be phosphorylated at 5' ends for the ligase reaction.PPCP primer strands are complementary to each other, thus self-annealing of the primer strands may compete with the annealing between the primer strands and the DNA template, decreasing the efficiency of the process. This problem can be alleviated by optimizing the ratio of primer pair to template DNA. Another important parameter is the temperature setting for the ligation step. Although DNA polymerase and DNA ligase have the maximal activities at 72 and 60°C, respectively, both enzymes exhibit sufficient activity within the range of 60–72°C. Even though we found that setting ligation temperature at 60°C works well for the purpose, it is likely that annealing, elongation and ligation all occur at all of the three temperature settings albeit to a different degree of activity.In contrast to the conventional mutagenic PCR protocols, the PPCP method eliminates background transformants including those without the insert or target sequence that reduce the efficiency in library screening.24 Thus the need to run vector-only control to gauge the level of background resulting from vector self-ligation is eliminated.In contrast to the whole-plasmid PCR of the MegaWHOP procedure, the PPCP method reported in this work facilitates exponential amplification. In the PPCP procedure, a newly extended DNA strand is ligated to form a circular DNA, which serves as a new template in the next PCR cycle. Furthermore, the product mixture of MegaWHOP must be digested by a dam-methylated DNA-specific restriction enzyme, such as DpnI, to reduce the template plasmid.13,25 In the in situ error-prone mutagenic PPCP method reported in this work, the use of the primer pair harbouring a selection marker, e.g. a drug resistance gene that is different from that of the template plasmid, allows marker swapping that completely eliminates the growth of the transformants of template plasmids without the need of DpnI digestion. Thus no further treatment is needed for the PPCP products, which can be directly transformed into host cells. The differences between MegaWHOP and PPCP are summarized in Table 2. Comparison of thermostable DNA ligase-mediated PPCP with MegaWHOPComparison of thermostable DNA ligase-mediated PPCP with MegaWHOPIn PPCP, a generic primer pair can be employed for different target genes cloned into the multi-cloning sites of an expression plasmid vector. Such generic primer pair contains the entire vector sequence but missing the target gene in the cloning site (Fig. 4). A second pair of primers containing a different selection marker can be similarly prepared so that multiple rounds of ‘error-prone PPCP – transformation – selection’ process can be conveniently performed over a target gene for directed evolution (Fig. 4).In conclusion, we demonstrated that a thermostable DNA ligase can be employed to mediate the amplification of circular DNA by adding a ligation step to conventional PCR cycles resulting in nick-free, circular plasmid DNA PCR products. We further showed that PPCP can be used to swap the selection marker of the template plasmid negating the need to pretreat the PCR DNA with DpnI. Finally, when an error-prone DNA polymerase is used, PPCP can be used for in situ mutagenesis to create random mutagenesis libraries (in situ error-prone mutagenic PPCP). The method offers the following advantages: (i) nick-free, circular PCR products can be directly transformed into competent E. coli cells and easily selected by using an alternative antibiotic; (ii) a mutant library can be created by one-step error-prone amplification of variable DNA region in a plasmid and (iii) accumulation of positive mutations in one sequence can be obtained by multiple rounds of in situ error-prone mutagenic PPCP. This method offers a novel, convenient and efficient approach for improving genes and proteins through directed evolution. In this work, we showed how biomass-degrading enzymes can be improved by mutagenic PPCP for the development of green industries.FundingThis work was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31170027), PAPD of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions, Nanjing Program of Science and Technology (201101094), the Natural Science Foundation of the Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China (12KJB180002) and Zhenjiang Agricultural Science and Technology support program (NY2012032).

IntroductionNext-generation sequencing (NGS) is an increasingly important technology in genome and molecular biology research, partly because of its rapidity, precision, and cost effectiveness.1–4 NGS technology allows several analyses such as resequencing, de novo assembly of genomes, transcriptome analysis, Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing, and exome analysis.5 With ever-decreasing sequencing costs, NGS read datasets can now reach terabase sizes. These massive sequencing datasets demand high-performance computational resources, rapid data transfer, large-scale data storage, and competent data analysts. This increase in scale appears to impede data mining and analysis by researchers.The DDBJ Sequence Read Archive (DRA), released in 2009, is a data archive for NGS raw reads that has been maintained at the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) of the National Institute of Genetics (NIG).6,7 The DRA is a global provider of public nucleotide sequences in partnership with the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC)8 consisting of the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) in the USA9 and the European Read Archive (ERA) of the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) in Europe.10 Researchers may wish to reuse massive read datasets in DRA; however, their DRA file size tends to be too large to be downloaded to a local computer.A computational system known as the ‘cloud’, consisting of data service provided via the Internet, was recently developed. Cloud computing allows users to avail services provided by data centres without building their own infrastructure. The infrastructure of the data centre is shared by a large number of users, reducing the cost to each user. To manage the flood of NGS data, several large-scale computing platforms have been recommended.11–13 Cluster computing is performed by multiple computers typically linked through a fast local area network and functioning effectively as a single computer. Grid computing is performed by loosely coupled networked computers from different administrative centres that work together on common computing tasks. Cloud computing is the computing ability that abstracts away the underlying hardware architecture and enables convenient on-demand network access to a shared pool of computing resources that can be readily provisioned and released. In particular, a model of cloud computing, Software as a service (SaaS), is referred to as ‘on-demand software’ and is available via a web browser. Cloud computing is a system uniting clusters of personal computers linked together similar to grid computing. The hallmark of cloud computing is that the users can perform computation across the Internet, without the necessity of understanding the underlying architecture.The DDBJ Read Annotation Pipeline (DDBJ Pipeline) was released in 2009 with the aim of supporting users wishing to submit NGS data analysis results to the DDBJ database, a cloud computing-based analysis pipeline for DRA NGS data. This pipeline comprises two analytical components: a basic analytical process of reference mapping and de novo assembly and a process of multiple high-level analytical workflows. The main workflows of the high-level analysis offer structural and functional annotations. The DDBJ Pipeline, which is a web application based on the SaaS model of cloud computing, assists in the submission of analysed results to DDBJ databases by automatically formatting data files and facilitates the web-based operation of NIG supercomputers for high-throughput data analysis. Although conventional web-based genome-analysis pipelines, such as NCBI Prokaryotic Genomes Automatic Annotation Pipeline (PGAAP)14 and Rice Genome Automated Annotation System (RiceGAAS),15 perform genomic annotation of a draft sequence, their main target is Sanger-based sequence reads in small datasets. In contrast, the DDBJ Pipeline processes multiple datasets of terabase size using the computational resources of NIG supercomputers (the system is introduced in http://sc.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/index.php/en/).In this report, we introduce the DDBJ Pipeline system with respect to its hardware and software configuration and outline its usage statistics since 2009. At present, the NIG supercomputer time is provided free of charge. We believe that provision of computational services for NGS data analysis without cost to users will increase the use of public data and accelerate data submission to public databases.2. Materials and methods2.1. Basic analysisThe pipeline accepts single- or paired-end reads in FASTQ16 format and simple metadata describing the organism and experimental conditions associated with the reads. The type of sequencer is immaterial, providing that the data format of the reads is followed. Users submit their NGS data and XML-formatted metadata to the DRA. They may also submit the NGS data to a DDBJ Pipeline directory. Users subsequently analyse the NGS data in the pipeline using the accession numbers. The FASTQ-formatted sequences and metadata are loaded from the DRA databases. The DDBJ Pipeline allows pre-processing by trimming low-quality bases from both ends of the reads. The pre-processing function returns statistics and figures describing read qualities by read position, and these outputs enable users to set trimming parameters. The FASTQ files are used either for genome mapping or for de novo assembly. The basic analysis supports various mapping and de novo assembly tools for the NGS data according to the user's preference. (Analytical programme tools hosted in the DDBJ Pipeline17–36 are listed in Table 1). Optional analytical parameters can be selected. Sequential commands from pre-processing to outputting analytical results are preset for easy operation. Reference data, such as the relevant genome sequence, can be retrieved from DDBJ databases by the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP).37 Users can confirm the error rate by read position and can trim low-quality bases from the reads. The numbers of mapped reads, genome coverage, depth, and maximum contig length are reported. Output files from all processing stages including SAM-formatted files,24 if supported by the tool, can be downloaded from an FTP server. A multiple FASTA file, which is convenient for subsequent submissions to the whole-genome shotgun (WGS) section of DDBJ, is built on the basis of consensus sequences from mapping or contig files from de novo assembly. The basic analysis system is built mainly using Perl 5.8, Java 6, PostgreSQL 8.3, and gnuplot (http://www.gnuplot.info/). Mapping and de novo assembly are performed on NIG supercomputers using 704 8-core 2.60-GHz Intel Sandy Bridge CPUs with 64 GB RAM and 1.6 TB storage, and 96 8-core 2.66-GHz Intel Xenon CPUs with 10 TB RAM, respectively. Analysis programmes hosted in the DDBJ PipelineNumbers in brackets following analysis tools are citations.Analysis programmes hosted in the DDBJ PipelineNumbers in brackets following analysis tools are citations.Mapping benchmarks in the basic analysis were calculated using the whole-genome NGS data from the Japanese rice cultivar ‘Omachi’ (paired-end reads of accession number DRR000719) and using the complete genome sequences of the Japanese rice cultivar ‘Nipponbare’ as reference (accession numbers NC_008394–NC_008405). De novo assembly was performed using whole-genome NGS reads of Escherichia coli NDM1Dok01 (paired-end reads of accession number DRR001003).2.2. High-level analysisBecause advanced analysis after mapping and de novo assembly requires several workflows with variable functions, the high-level analysis system was mainly designed to use the Galaxy interface,30 a genomic workbench with a graphical user interface. To date, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis, transcriptome analysis (RNA-seq), and ChIP-sequencing have been implemented using SAMtools,24 Cufflinks,32 and MACS,33 respectively (Table 1). These analyses are performed using mapped results in the SAM format generated by the basic analysis. Users can modify parameter settings through the graphical user interface and execute the analysis flows repeatedly using Galaxy's Workflow and History methods. For SNP analysis, a figure showing the frequency distribution of SNPs over the entire genome can be produced. For transcriptome analysis, mapped results are sent to Cufflinks to quantify gene structures and expression values. In addition, these results can be visualized by genomic regions linked to the UCSC genome browser site (http://genome.ucsc.edu/).The high-level analysis system requires the Galaxy environment, Cairo (http://www.cairographics.org/), and Perl modules from CPAN (http://www.cpan.org/) for graphical output. The analysis is performed on the same nodes as the mapping, using the 704 8-core 2.60-GHz Intel SandyBridge CPUs with 64 GB RAM and 1.6 TB storage.3. Results and discussion3.1. System configuration of the proposed pipelineThe system outline of the DDBJ Pipeline is summarized in Supplementary Fig. S1. Apache Tomcat and DB servers for the DDBJ Pipeline run on an NIG supercomputer, and an FTP server that handles data import and export and resides outside the supercomputer. Reads imported from the DRA are sent via its built-in FTP server.The pipeline is built as a cloud computing-based web application, and its flow follows two steps. The basic analysis receives transferred reads and maps them to reference genomes or assembles them. The high-level analysis generates results closer to the research goals, such as genome contig construction, SNP detection, or expression analysis.NGS data are transferred either to an analysis server for basic analysis or to Galaxy interface servers for high-level analysis, both residing within an NIG supercomputer. Classified on the basis of purpose, the data are analysed by the supercomputer nodes using the qsub command of the UNIVA grid engine.3.2. A pipeline for high-throughput analysis of NGS dataIn the basic analysis, the DDBJ Pipeline provides the following useful functions: (i) data transfer: at the start of analysis, users can specify three methods for query data: FTP uploading, secure copy from DRA if the data have been pre-registered to DRA, or HTTP uploading. If users wish to use public data as query data, they may choose directory upload from the DRA, whose data are shared with SRA and ERA. Public data may be used not only as query data, but also as reference sequences for mapping. (ii) Pre-processing in the form of trimming off low-quality parts of sequence reads: basecalling quality is not uniform and may influence mapping or assembly quality. Although trimming off less accurately identified bases is effective to maintain the quality, several analysis tools can be used as optional functions.38–41 The DDBJ Pipeline outputs trimmed reads and figures showing the distributions of read quality scores. (iii) Parameter changes to software components: the DDBJ Pipeline allows modification of some options and parameters of the software and allows users to limit reads to uniquely mapped reads in the SAM file by removing multiread sets (Fig. 1). (iv) Confirming job status and ensuring confidentiality: the DDBJ Pipeline communicates with web applications to analyses the NGS data using DDBJ supercomputers and currently supports 11 mapping or de novo assembly software packages (Table 1). During pre-processing, mapping, or de novo assembly on the supercomputer, users can confirm the status of their operation through a web browser (Fig. 2). The user's jobs are listed along with their status (‘running’, ‘complete’, ‘error’, etc.) and elapsed times. When the jobs are completed, the DDBJ Pipeline notifies users by e-mail. Output is not limited to SAM-formatted files as mapping results or FASTA files as assembly results, but includes intermediate files, work logs, and statistical data, including mapping coverage and depth or N50 contig size of assemblies. The DDBJ Pipeline and the NIG supercomputer system, which execute the pipeline jobs, may be accessed by an unspecified number of users. To protect user confidentiality, the DDBJ Pipeline does not allow users to identify any other user except for the demo user, and users may never access each other's queries except for public data and results.

Jobs executed in the DDBJ Pipeline are shown in lists, and users may manage the jobs, for example, by downloading results or by halting the jobs. The bars at the right end of the list indicate elapsed times.As an example of a benchmark of the system, the DDBJ Pipeline enables the mapping of 34.7 million 75-base NGS reads to a 383-Mb reference genome using BWA program18,19 in 6.5 h and can assemble 24.4 million 80-base paired-end WGS reads in 10.5 min with SOAPdenovo,27 using the cloud computing system. NGS technologies reduce the cost and time required for sequencing, and the resulting data increase the submissions to public archives.8 Current developments in NGS technologies are leading to increases in both read length and the number of reads, and novel biological strategies are being developed to utilize the sequencing systems. The expansion of read numbers requires expanded computational resources, particularly for de novo assembly.42 The use of a computational cluster system allows decentralized processing, resulting in scalability for efficient analysis of NGS data. The DDBJ Pipeline supports not only the use of public domain data, but also the submission of mapping and assembly results to the WGS division of DDBJ in FASTA format. Basic analysis of the DDBJ Pipeline is accessible at http://p.ddbj.nig.ac.jp.3.3. Genome-wide annotation by the high-level analysis of NGS dataThe DDBJ Pipeline supports not only basic analyses, such as mapping, but also high-level analyses via the Galaxy interface, which has the advantage of modifiability and easy maintenance.30 User data such as login accounts, e-mail addresses, and passwords for access to Galaxy are shared with those of basic analysis. Therefore, basic analysis results, which are mapping or assembly jobs identified by job IDs, can be imported into Galaxy.The high-level analysis has recently been augmented with the following four analysis methods:
The high-level analysis of the DDBJ Pipeline can be accessed at http://p-galaxy.ddbj.nig.ac.jp.SNP detection: Users may view the pileup data produced by the basic analysis and identify SNPs using ANNOVAR.31 They may also view figures showing SNP distribution on the genome (Supplementary Fig. S2A and 2B).RNA-Seq analysis: Expression analysis using TopHat23 produces a SAM file that is subsequently processed using Cufflinks.32 Downloaded Cufflinks results are sent to the UCSC genome browser site (http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway),43 allowing the user to identify read expression patterns within genome-wide images. Cuffcompare, an analysis function of Cufflinks, is also available.ChIP-Seq analysis: The DDBJ Pipeline supports MACS33 for ChIP-Seq analysis.Annotation of contigs by de novo assembly: A length filter is applied to remove short fragments. For gene finding in contigs, gene prediction tools, such as GENSCAN for eukaryote and GeneMark.hmm for prokaryote data,34,35 are applied. BLASTX is used for similarity searching against known proteins36 (Supplementary Fig. S2C). Supplementary Figs S2A, S2B, and S2C showing the whole-genome distribution of SNPs or the functional annotation of assembled contigs provide researchers with inspiration for new discoveries. In addition, new strategies for applying NGS technologies to novel biological analyses will be developed in the future. Therefore, the high-level analysis has the flexibility to be modified.3.4. Usage statistics of the DDBJ PipelineAs a beta version offering only the basic analysis component, the DDBJ Pipeline has been open to the public via the Internet with updates since August 2009. Some analytical tools have been replaced according to the frequency of their use since then. From the start of recording in June 2010, the number of jobs submitted was around 1800 (Table 2), not considering those used for development and demonstration. The number of mapping jobs (1428) was nearly quadruple that of de novo assembly jobs (326). Job numbers for the basic analysis of the DDBJ Pipeline (since June 2010)aPre-processing was still under construction.Job numbers for the basic analysis of the DDBJ Pipeline (since June 2010)aPre-processing was still under construction.3.5. Building an environment supporting the use of NGS data by biologistsDeposits of NGS data in public databases (DRA, ERA, and SRA) are rapidly increasing each year.6 However, the NGS database has been used only as a data repository. Bioinformaticians use the data to test their own computer analysis programmes, whereas general biologists lacking computational skills rarely use the huge and unwieldy datasets. In this report, we present an example of how biologists may use public NGS data to their advantage. Genome sequences used as references for re-sequencing are often updated, resulting in the shifting of mapped positions of reads. Researchers may wish to compare SNPs that have been newly mapped and detected by them to previously detected SNPs in the public database. SNP positions in databases, such as dbSNP,44 based on older reference genomes will lead to confusion. The DDBJ Pipeline not only provides a computational environment for analysing NGS data, but also permits seamless access to the public domain data, including NGS short reads and complete genomes. Researchers familiar with the DDBJ Pipeline will be able to re-perform reference mapping quickly using public NGS reads with current genome sequences. It may occur that comparing or merging SNP data from their own dataset with the public data using the DDBJ Pipeline allows re-analysis with preferred parameters. We expect the DDBJ Pipeline to analyse users' NGS data, thereby accelerating the submission of NGS data to public databases such as DDBJ.3.6. The cloud computational system for NGS data analysisA recent cloud computing innovation is virtual machines (VMs), which are programmes that perform parallel processing to overcome differences between server platforms. VM technology has been used in bioinformatics.11–13 CloVR45 has been developed for analysing bacterial NGS data, and the RseqFlow workflow46 processes, RNA-Seq data. Cloud computing with VM expands genome informatics, and more tools will appear in future. Although the DDBJ Pipeline accommodates individual users' data, some biologists wish to host NGS analysis packages on their local servers to keep their data private. Therefore, we are studying the future incorporation of a VM package into the DDBJ Pipeline.Supplementary dataSupplementary Data are available atwww.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was partially supported by a grant-in-aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Areas ‘Genome Science’ and Scientific Research (C) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan.

The two-cell stage is critical for mouse development, as this is the time when the dramatic epigenetic changes occur1 concomitantly with the transcriptional activation of the maternally derived genome and paternally derived genome for the first time (called zygotic genome activation, ZGA).2,3 Although human genome contains only one copy of ZSCAN4, mouse genome contains nine copies of genes (Zscan4a, Zscan4b, Zscan4c, Zscan4d, Zscan4e, Zscan4f, and three pseudogenes).4 Zscan4d is expressed predominantly in the two-cell stage mouse embryos, whereas Zscan4c is expressed predominantly in the mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells.4 We here collectively call them Zscan4.The expression of Zscan4 in mouse ES cells is transient and reversible, resulting in the unique expression pattern with expression in only 1–5% of ES cells at one time in culture.4–6 Further analysis reveals that ES cells oscillate between the Zsca4-negative (Zscan4-) state and Zscan4-positive (Zscan4+) state, in which Zscan4 functions to extend telomeres and to enhance genomic stability.6 A recent study shows that this transient state is also marked with the expression of endogenous retroviruses, such as MuERV-L, which are also highly expressed in the two-cell stage mouse embryos.7 Additionally, Zscan4 has also been shown to further enhance the efficiency of generating mouse induced pluripotent stem cells and to increase their quality.8,9Through the global expression analysis, we have noticed that a eukaryotic translation initiation factor 1A (Eif1a) is highly up-regulated in the Zscan4+ state of ES cells compared with the Zscan4- state.10 Studies using a yeast model have shown that, together with Eif1, Eif1a plays an important role in the identification of translation initiation codon in eukaryotes.11,12 According to the Mouse Genome Informatics database13 at The Jackson Laboratory, Eif1a was originally identified as a mouse eukaryotic elongation factor Tu in erythroleukemic cells.14 It was also identified as a translation initiation factor eIF-4C, a gene expressed transiently in the two-cell stage of the pre-implantation mouse embryos.15 Although Eif1a has been used as a specific marker for ZGA in the two-cell stage embryos,16 its function in either ZGA or two-cell embryos is not clear.In this study, we have identified a cluster of Eif1a-like genes on mouse Chromosome 12 and revealed that, not Eif1a on Chromosome 18, but Eif1a-like genes are expressed specifically in the two-cell stage mouse embryos and in the Zscan4+ state of mouse ES cells. We also found that the nascent protein synthesis is globally repressed in the Zscan4+ state of ES cells, which can be explained by the specific expression of Eif1a-like genes in these cells, as we have also shown that the over-expression of Eif1a-like genes can indeed repress the global protein synthesis. Together, the findings from this study demonstrate a new mechanism by which global protein translation can be regulated in the ES cells.2. Materials and methods2.1. Mouse embryonic stem cell culture and transfectionMouse ES cell lines, V6.5, derived from F1 hybrid mouse strain C57BL/6 × 129/Sv (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA), and MC1, derived from 129S6/SvEvTac mouse strain (Transgenic Core Laboratory, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA), were used in this study. ES cells were maintained on 0.1% gelatin-coated culture plates in complete ES cell media consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Gibco Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Atlanta Biologicals, Lawrenceville, GA, USA), 1000 U/ml leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF; ESGRO, Chemicon Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids, 2 mM GlutaMAX, 0.1 mM ß-mercaptoethanol, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin (all media supplements were from Gibco Invitrogen unless otherwise stated). ES cell culture medium was changed daily, and cells were passaged every 3 days. ES cells were transfected using Effectene (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) following the manufacturer's protocol.2.2. Vectors and DNA Constructs3×FLAG tag were added to the 5-prime end of mouse Eif1a (NM_010120.5), Eif1al6 (U106343), and Eif1al9 (U285359) and cloned into the pPyCAG-BstXI-IP vector (a generous gift from Dr Hitoshi Niwa, RIKEN Center for Developmental Biology, Japan, http://www.cdb.riken.jp/pcs/protocol/vector/vector_top.html) at XhoI and NotI sites.2.3. Nascent protein synthesis labellingClick-iT l-azidohomoalanine (AHA) Alexa Fluor 488 Protein Synthesis Assay Kit (Invitrogen Life Sciences) was used to label newly synthesized protein following the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were plated on 12-well plates and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were cultured in methionine-free complete ES cell media for 30 min, labelled in AHA-containing methionine-free complete ES cell media for 1 h, and subsequently fixed for immunofluorescence studies or protein extracted using RIPA lysis buffer (Thermo Scientific). Tetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA) detection of AHA-labelled protein samples were performed using the Click-IT TAMRA Protein Analysis Detection Kit (Invitrogen Life Sciences) following the manufacturer's protocol.2.4. ImmunofluorescenceCells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA, USA) for 20 min and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were blocked for 30 min at room temperature in PBS containing 10% FBS, 10% goat serum (Gibco Invitrogen), and 10% donkey serum (Sigma-Aldrich). The cells were incubated in primary antibodies overnight at 4°C followed by secondary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature and lastly stained with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, dihydrochloride (DAPI) (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Custom-made polyclonal rabbit anti-Zscan4 antibodies (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ, USA) were generated against the C-terminal epitope Zscan4 as described previously.6 Anti-FLAG M2 (F1804; Sigma), mouse anti-Zscan4 (Abnova, Taipei, Taiwan), anti-Eif1a (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), anti-eIF2a phosphoserine 51 (Abcam), anti-histone H3 phosphoserine 10 (Abcam), anti-actin (Sigma), and fluorescent Alexa Fluor secondary (Invitrogen) antibodies were purchased. Fluorescence was visualized and captured using a Nikon Eclipse TE300 inverted microscope (Nikon, Melville, NY, USA).2.5. Sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blot analysisProtein samples were prepared by lyzing mouse ES cells in RIPA buffer (Thermo Scientific) following manufacturer's protocol. Protein concentration was determined using the Micro BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific). 20 µg of protein samples were loaded onto NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris gel (Novex Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and ran in MOPS sodium dodecyl sulphate running buffer (Invitrogen) at 200 V for 50 min. Protein transfer was performed using the Bio-Rad transfer system at 80 V for 3 h at 4°C onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK). Membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline (BioSource, Chevy Chase, MD, USA) containing 0.05% Tween 20 (Bio-Rad) and 5% milk. Primary antibodies were incubated at 4°C overnight. Enhanced chemi-luminescence solutions (Pierce Thermo Scientific) were applied to the membranes and were exposed against Kodak X-Omat AR2 film (Perkin Elmer).2.6. Quantitative real-time PCRRNA samples were isolated from cells using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). One microgram of total RNA was used for cDNA synthesis using the high capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Invitrogen). Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis was performed in triplicates with the SYBR green mater mix and run on 7900HT system (Applied Biosystems). All procedures above were performed following the respective manufacturer's protocols. Primers used for PCR reactions were: wild type Eif1a forward, 5'-GGCCATCGTGAGCTGAAGTA-3'; reverse, 5'-AAGTGCAGCCGTACACATCT-3'; Eif1al6 forward, 5'-CAACACAATTGGCATCTTGACG-3'; reverse, 5'-GCATTGACAAAACACACTCATGC-3'; Eif1al9 forward, 5'-CAATGCAGGTAGTTGTTAAGAGCA-3'; reverse, 5'-GAAAATGGCTTAACACAAAGGACA-3'; Gapdh forward, 5'-CCCCAATGTGTCCGTCGTG-3'; reverse, 5'-GCCTGCTTCACCACCTTCT-3'. All measurements were normalized to Gapdh loading control and relative expression of Eif1a, and variant expression were compared with untreated control samples using the <U+0394><U+0394>Ct method.173. Results3.1. Nascent protein synthesis is globally repressed
in the Zscan4+ state of mouse ES cellsZscan4, a specific marker for two-cell embryo, has been shown in previous studies to be transiently expressed in mouse ES cells.4,6 Mouse ES cells oscillate between Zscan4+ and Zscan4- states. Eif1a, a translation initiation factor, is found to be co-upregulated with Zscan4 in two-cell embryo18–20 and was also found to be one of the top up-regulated genes in cell enriched for Zscan4 (pZscan4-Emerald).10 In earlier studies, we have also noticed that, at the RNA levels, the expression of Zscan4 is often accompanied with the expression of Eif1a.21 Because Eif1a is a known translation initiation factor, we hypothesized that the high expression of Eif1a in the Zscan4+ state may play a role in the protein synthesis in these cells.To test this notion, we first examined the nascent protein synthesis in mouse ES cells using the AHA assay. To our surprise, the dramatic repression of global protein synthesis was observed in ~95% of Zscan4-positive cells when compared with surrounding Zscan4-negative ES cells (Fig. 1Ai–iii). To further validate this result, we established a stable mouse ES cell line in which the puromycin-resistant gene is driven by the Zscan4c promoter, thus allowing the enrichment of cells in the Zscan4+ state by adding puromycin (Fig. 1B). The AHA assay on these cells confirmed the global repression of protein synthesis in the cells enriched by the Zscan4+ state (Fig. 1C). As expected, levels of proteins detected by antibodies against Eif1a increased in ~85% of the Zscan4-enriched ES cells, despite the repression of global protein synthesis (Fig. 1Aiv–vi). The immunohistochemistry result was further supported by the western blot analysis of ES cells enriched with the Zscan4+ state (Fig. 1C). Global nascent protein synthesis is repressed in Zscan4+ state cells and has elevated levels of Eif1a. (A) To determine global protein synthesis, mouse ES cells were cultured in methionine-free ES cell media for 30 min, labelled with AHA, a methionine analogue, for 1 h and visualized with Alexa Fluor 488 alkyne through Click-iT reaction and co-stained with Zscan4 antibody. Zscan+ ES cells (i, arrowhead) showed dramatic repression in AHA staining (ii and iii). Eif1a levels were determined in Zscan4+ cells by co-staining with the respective antibodies. Zscan4+ cells (iv) showed enhanced Eif1a expression (v and vi). Pictures were taken at ×40 magnification using a Nikon Eclipse TE300 microscope (scale bar indicates 50 mm). (B) pZscan4-puro mouse ES cells were treated with (+) or without (-) 1.5 mg/ml puromycin for 1 or 2 days. Cells were labelled with AHA as described above and protein harvested using RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitors. AHA-labelled samples were then detected using TAMRA alkyne via Click-iT reaction. Samples were run on a 4–12% Bis-Tris SDS–PAGE acrylamide gel, and TAMRA was visualized under UV illuminescence. (C) Western blot analysis was performed on the same gel (C) to determine the levels of Zscan4 and Eif1a. Protein from the acrylamide gel was transferred onto the polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane and blotted with antibodies against Zscan4, Eif1a, and beta-actin.Global nascent protein synthesis is repressed in Zscan4+ state cells and has elevated levels of Eif1a.

Zscan+ ES cells (i, arrowhead) showed dramatic repression in AHA staining (ii and iii). Eif1a levels were determined in Zscan4+ cells by co-staining with the respective antibodies.

Protein from the acrylamide gel was transferred onto the polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane and blotted with antibodies against Zscan4, Eif1a, and beta-actin.It is known that the high expression of proteins could cause the repression of global protein synthesis by the stress-induced response in cells.22 To test this possibility, we carried out immunostaining of ES cells with antibodies against Zscan4 and phosphorylated Eif2a at serine 51 (a marker for stress-induced global protein synthesis repression).23,24 Co-expression of Zscan4 and phospho-Eif2a (Ser51) was not observed, indicating that the global protein repression observed in endogenously Zscan4-enriched ES cells was not due to stress-induced response (Fig. 2A). Another condition in which cells are known to undergo global protein synthesis repression is during mitosis (M phase) of the cell cycle.25,26 To check whether the Zscan4+ cells are in the G2/M phase, ES cells were fixed and immunostained with antibodies against Zscan4 and histone H3 phosphoserine 10 (H3S10ph; a marker of the late G2 and M phase).27–29 Cells in late G2 and prophase cells showed more speckled staining of H3S10ph, whereas cells undergoing metaphase had more intense and compacted staining H3S10ph. Consistent with previous studies cells in the metaphase showed a decrease in protein synthesis as measured by AHA labelling (Fig. 2Bi–iv). However, co-staining of H3S10ph and Zscan4 antibodies was not observed, indicating that Zscan4+ state cells repressed protein synthesis through a different mechanism. Together, these data demonstrate that the protein synthesis repression observed in Zscan4+ state cells does not occur through stress-induced or mitosis-induced mechanisms and suggests an alternative mechanism that is responsible for global protein synthesis repression observed in these cells. Global nascent protein synthesis observed in Zscan4+ state cells not due to stress-induced response or cells being blocked in the mitosis stage of cell cycle. (A) Mouse ES cells were co-immunostained with antibodies against Zscan4 (i) and Eif2a phosphoserine 51 antibodies (ii) and visualized using Alexa Fluor 568 and 488, respectively.

DNA was visualized by DAPI staining (iv and viii). White arrows indicate the position of H3S10ph stained cells in i–iv.

Identification of Eif1a-like genes that are predominantly expressed in two-cell embryos
and the Zscan4+ state of ES cellsResults thus far suggest that Eif1a plays a role in repressing global protein synthesis, which would be a novel and unexpected function of Eif1a, if confirmed. To gain more insights into the Eif1a gene, we looked into all oligonucleotide probes used to target different regions of the Eif1a gene in the DNA microarray.30 Interestingly, we found that not all probes against Eif1a showed an increase in expression in Zscan4+ state ES cells compared with the Zscan4- state. Probes that targeted a part of the protein-coding region showed a 10.5-fold increase in the Zscan4+ state of ES cells compared with the Zscan4- state, whereas probes that targeted the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) or 5'-UTR of Eif1a did not show a change in expression (see more detailed analysis below). This suggested the presence of more than one Eif1a genes.Thorough analysis of NIA Mouse Gene Index31 and Mouse Genome Sequence (9 and 10 mm)32 identified Eif1a (Chromosome 18), Eif1ax (Chromosome X), and a cluster of 19 Eif1a-like genes on mouse Chromosome 12. Based on their protein-coding capacity, we noted 10 Eif1a-like genes (named here Eif1al1–Eif1al10) and nine pseudogenes (named here Eif1al-ps1–Eif1al-ps9; Fig. 3A). The Eif1a-like genes could be distinguished from each other by their mRNA sequences (Fig. 3B) and protein sequences (Fig. 4A) when the sequences were aligned using the Clustal OMEGA program.33,34 However, the protein sequences between the coding region of Eif1a35 (Chromosome 18) and the Eif1a-like genes were highly conserved, especially in the N-terminal half of the protein sequences (Supplementary Fig. S1), which is the region to which the Eif1a antibody (ab38976, Abcam) we used was raised against. Considering the predominant expression of Eif1a-like genes in the Zscan4+ state of ES cells, the results shown in Fig. 1Aiv–vi and C required re-interpretation, as the enhanced immunofluorescence signal detected by the Eif1a antibody in cells enriched with the Zscan4+ state was of Eif1a-like genes and not Eif1a. A cluster of Eif1a-like genes is newly identified. (A) Schematic diagram of Chromosome 12 Eif1a-like genes. Eif1a-like genes were initially found by transcript assembly from the EST database (NIA Mouse Gene Index, http://lgsun.grc.nia.nih.gov/geneindex/).31 Subsequently, the full set of these genes was discovered by aligning known sequences (Eif1a, Eif1ax, and Eif1a like) to the genome (10 mm) using the BLAT software (http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgBlat), and then displayed within the UCSC Genome Browser. Genome targets were extracted and repeatedly aligned until no new alignment was found.

Results were normalized to Gapdh and made relative to the non-enriched sample for each primer set (mean ± SEM; non-enriched n = 4, Zscan4+ state enriched n = 2).The analysis of expressed sequence tag (EST) frequency in the NIA Mouse Gene Index31 showed that Eif1a-like genes were expressed mostly in two-cell embryos and to some extent in leukaemia erythroblasts (Fig. 3A; Supplementary Table S1). With the current genomic information available, Eif1a-like genes clusters were not identified in human or rat genomes. However, due to the highly repetitive nature of this region, there is potential for identification of this cluster in future genome assemblies. Currently, this Eif1a-like gene cluster can only be confirmed in the mouse. Interestingly, 5 of 19 genes and pseudogenes from this mouse Chromosome 12 cluster (Eif1a-ps3, Eif1al9, Eif1al2, Eif1al-ps6, and Eif1al-ps7) were found to have synteny to human Chromosome 1 pseudogene EIF1AXP1 (ENSG00000236698) using the Multi-VISTA browser.36Next, we looked at the microarray data with the new annotations of the 60-mer probes for Eif1a and Eif1a-like genes. Thus, the probe that targeted a protein-coding region can detect both Eif1a and Eif1a-like genes, showing that a 10.5-fold increase in the Zscan4+ state of ES cells compared with the Zscan4- state, whereas probes that targeted the 3'-UTR of Eif1a, detecting only Eif1a, did not show a change in expression (Fig. 4B). More specifically for Eif1a-like genes, microarray probes against a conserved region on 3'-UTR (16.1-fold increase, P-value <0.0001), coding region (25.4-fold increase, P-value <0.0001), and 5'-UTR of Eif1al6 (23.8-fold increase, P-value <0.0001) all showed an increase in the Zscan4+ state of ES cells compared with the Zscan4- state (Fig. 4B).To further validate the microarray results, we carried out that quantitative real-time PCR on RNA samples extracted from cells enriches with the Zscan4+ state by puromycin selection of the pZscan4-puromycin cells using PCR primers designed specifically against a non-conserved region of the 3'-UTR of Eif1a versus Eif1al6 (U106343) and Eif1al9 (U285359). Primers against the specific Eif1a-like genes may also detect other Eif1a-like genes, because this region in the 3'-UTR among the Eif1a-like genes are highly similar to, but are different from the Eif1a sequence. The results showed that the two Eif1a-like genes tested (Eif1al6 and Eif1al9) had nearly a 100-fold increase in RNA levels in cells enriched with the Zscan4+ state compared with non-puromycin-selected cells (Fig. 4C). The expression of Eif1a was only slightly enhanced in cells enriched with the Zscan4+ state (~1.5-fold increase).Together, these results demonstrated that Eif1a-like genes, not Eif1a, were highly expressed in two-cell stage pre-implantation embryos and in the Zscan4+ state of ES cells.3.3. Over-expression of Eif1a-like genes can repress global protein synthesisTo further determine the mechanism for global protein synthesis repression in the Zscan4+ state of ES cells, we investigated whether over-expression of Eif1a-like genes can repress global protein synthesis. We generated FLAG-tagged constructs of Eif1al6 (FLAG-Eif1al6) and Eif1al9 (FLAG-Eif1al9) and transfected them into ES cells, followed by the analysis of the nascent protein synthesis determined via AHA labelling and immunofluorescence. Both cells transfected with either FLAG-Eif1al6 or FLAG-Eif1al9 showed reduction in AHA labelling, whereas cells transfected with the FLAG-Eif1a did not always show a consistent reduction in AHA labelling (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, using the TAMRA secondary antibody to detect the AHA-labelled proteins on sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) gel of samples extracted from cells transfected with Eif1a-like genes, FLAG-Eif1a-like cells showed a clear reduction in AHA labelling, when compared with cells transfected with either vector alone or FLAG-Eif1a (Fig. 5Bi). Over-expression of Eif1a-like genes represses global nascent protein translation. (A) mESC were transiently transfected with FLAG-tagged Eif1a (i–iv) or FLAG-Eif1a-like genes, Eif1al6 (v–viii) or Eif1al9 (ix–xii), constructs for 18 h before selection with puromycin for 24 h. Cells were then cultured in methionine-free ES cell media for 30 min and labelled with AHA for 1 h. AHA-labelled cells were visualized with Alexa Fluor 488 alkyne through Click-iT reaction (ii, vi, and x) and co-stained with FLAG antibody (i, v, and ix). DNA was visualized by DAPI staining (iv, viii, and xii). Pictures were taken at ×40 magnification using a Nikon Eclipse TE300 microscope (scale bar indicates 50 mm). White arrows indicated cells with high levels of FLAG-Eif1a or FLAG-Eif1a-like genes over-expression. (B) Cells were labelled with AHA as described above and protein harvested using RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitors. AHA-labelled samples were then detected using TAMRA alkyne via Click-iT reaction (i). Samples were run on a 4–12% Bis-Tris SDS–PAGE acrylamide gel, transferred on the PVDF membrane, and blotted with antibodies against Zscan4, Eif1a and beta-actin (ii).

AHA-labelled samples were then detected using TAMRA alkyne via Click-iT reaction (i). Samples were run on a 4–12% Bis-Tris SDS–PAGE acrylamide gel, transferred on the PVDF membrane, and blotted with antibodies against Zscan4, Eif1a and beta-actin (ii). (C) The model of global protein synthesis repression in Zscan4+ and Zscan4- states in mouse ES cells. Diagram modified from Zalzman et al.6The western blot analysis of the SDS–PAGE gel used for the TAMRA antibody detection above showed that the levels of FLAG-Eif1a-like proteins and FLAG-Eif1a proteins were similar to detected by Eif1a and FLAG antibodies (Fig. 5Bii). This indicates that the protein synthesis repression observed was not due to differences in expression levels of the various constructs. Taken together, these results showed that over-expression of Eif1a-like genes were able to repress protein synthesis globally and demonstrated a mechanism by which global protein synthesis was repressed in the Zscan4+ state of ES cells.4. DiscussionWe report here a novel mechanism to repress global protein synthesis in mouse ES cells. As shown previously, mouse ES cells oscillate between the Zscan4- and Zscan4+ states: the Zscan4- state turns into the Zscan4+ state at a rate of ~3% per day, whereas the Zscan4+ state turns into the Zscan4- state at a rate of ~47% per day (Fig. 5C).6 The Zscan4+ state is transient and relatively short; however, while ES cells are in the Zscan4+ state, several dramatic changes occur, including the up-regulation of meiosis-specific genes, a rapid extension of telomeres by a telomerase-independent recombination-based mechanism.6 The current work now adds the global repression of nascent protein synthesis as one of the unique feature of the transient Zscan4+ state. These results indicate that ES cells undergo the short period of the repressed protein synthesis in the standard cell culture condition.The current study also provides further evidence for the commonality between the Zscan4+ state of mouse ES cells and the two-cell stage mouse embryos. The expression of Zscan4, which is originally identified as genes expressed specifically in two-cell embryos,4 has indicated such commonality.6 Further evidence for such commonality has been provided recently: this transient state is also marked with the expression of endogenous retroviruses, such as MuERV-L, which are also expressed specifically in mouse two-cell stage embryos.7 Finding the unique expression of Eif1a-like genes both in the two-cell mouse embryos and in the Zscan4+ state of ES cells provides further connection between them. Considering the global repression of protein synthesis in the Zscan4+ state of ES cells, it would be interesting to know whether there is a novel mechanism for protein synthesis, or protein synthesis repression, during the ZGA in the development of pre-implantation embryo.High sequence homology of Eif1a-like genes to Eif1a suggests that only the few amino acid differences to the Eif1a-like genes are responsible for global protein repression. Thus, it is highly likely that Eif1a-like genes function as a naturally occurring dominant-negative factor, which interferes with the function of Eif1a as the ubiquitous factor important for the translation machinery in eukaryotes. This may indicate the possible use of Eif1a-like genes as potent repressors of the global protein synthesis in basic and clinical applications.We thank Yong Qian for assistance with the analysis of DNA microarray data, and Christopher Coletta, Nikita Orlov, and Ilya Goldberg for their discussions in analysis of microscopic images.Supplementary Data are available atwww.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.This work was in part supported by the Intramural Research Program of the NIH, National Institute on Aging.Supplementary data"

IntroductionPotato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is the most important non-grain food crop and is central to global food security. Considering its importance, much research on potato has been carried out during last decades. However, the fact remains that the global average yield of potato (15 tons/ha) is far below its yield potential (120 tons/ha), primarily due to various biotic and abiotic stresses.1 High and low temperatures, salinity and drought are the major abiotic stress factors limiting growth and productivity of the potato crop.2,3 Among biotic stresses, oomycete Phytophthora infestans that cause late blight is the most devastating disease of the potato with potential of causing 40–50% yield loss.4 Thus, improved tolerance of potato to these stresses may significantly increase the potato production. Tolerance or susceptibility against these stresses is governed by plant's ability to express a set of genes whose expression is often regulated by specific transcription factors (TFs).The NAC [no apical meristem (NAM), Arabidopsis thaliana transcription activation factor [ATAF1/2] and cup shaped cotyledon (CUC2)] TFs were originally identified from consensus sequences from petunia NAM, Arabidopsis thaliana ATAF1 and 2 and CUC2.5 The NAC family is one of the largest plant-specific TF families, represented by 117 genes in Arabidopsis and 151 in rice,6 163 in poplar,7 152 each in soybean8 and tobacco9 and 74 in grape.10 NAC proteins regulate a variety of plant developmental processes, such as the development of shoot apical meristem,11,12 lateral root development,13 embryonic and floral development,12,14 stress-induced flowering,15,16 leaf senescence,17 regulation of cell cycle,18,19 hormone signalling13,18,20,21 and grain nutrient remobilization.22Some NAC proteins also regulate plant stress responses, including both biotic and abiotic.23,24 The Arabidopsis RESPONSIVE TO DEHYDRATION 26 (RD26) cDNA was first identified as dehydration responsive gene25 that was later shown to encode a NAC TF and functions in a novel abscisic acid (ABA)-dependent stress-signalling pathway.20 Using yeast one hybrid, three Arabidopsis NAC proteins (ANAC019, ANAC055 and ANAC072/RD26) were identified, and overexpression of either of these genes significantly improved drought tolerance of transgenic plants.26 Similarly, overexpression of various NAC genes in transgenic rice conferred improved tolerance against abiotic stresses.27–32 As far as crops are concerned, most of the studies reporting the overexpression of NAC genes are limited to rice except, by Xue et al.33 who have overexpressed a wheat NAC gene, TaNAC69 in transgenic wheat that resulted in improved dehydration tolerance. Thus, it is important to identify and functionally characterize NAC TF families from economically important crop plants and to use functional NAC genes for generating these crops with improved stress tolerance. The NAC proteins also regulate plant response against various biotic cues, including viral,34 bacterial and fungal pathogens.35Typically, NAC proteins posses a conserved N-terminal DNA-binding NAC domain, which is divided into five subdomains (A–E), while C-terminal region is highly diversified and contains a transcriptional regulatory domain (TRD).36 Some NAC proteins, referred as NTL (NAC with Transmembrane Motif 1-like), also contain transmembrane motifs (TMs) at their C-terminal end.37,38 Crystal structure of the NAC domain of Arabidopsis ANAC01939 and rice SNAC140 revealed the presence of a novel TF fold consisting of a twisted anti-parallel ß-sheet. Recently, a new subfamily of NAC family, called TNAC, was identified in tobacco, which seemed to be restricted to Solanaceae family.9 The NAC domain of TNACs lacks the LPPG and YPNG motifs that are conserved in NAC family members, whereas the conserved D/EEE motif found in other NACs is replaced by D/ExE in TNACs.9The recent completion of genome sequencing of the potato by the potato genome sequencing consortium (PGSC)41 provides opportunities to identify protein families at genome-wide level, to analyse them and to utilize the potential genes for potato improvement. Recently, Jupe et al.42 have identified 438 NB-LRR genes containing nucleotide-binding (NB) and leucine rich repeat (LRR) domain in the potato genome. Similarly in a separate report, 435 NBS-encoding R genes were identified in the potato genome.43 NAC TFs have not been studied in the potato, except by Collinge and Boller,44 who found that a potato NAC gene, StNAC, was rapidly and strongly induced after wounding, while under P. infestans infection its transcript was detected only at 48 h. However, precise function of this StNAC remains to be elucidated.Given the critical roles played by NAC TFs in plants, we have identified a NAC TF family in the potato genome, provided nomenclature, performed phylogenetic analysis, mapped genes onto the 12 potato chromosomes, identified membrane-bound proteins and carried out expression analysis under various developmental stages, biotic and abiotic stresses and hormone treatments. In future, this study will provide leads to functionally characterize potato NAC TFs, to utilize them for potato improvement and also to identify and characterize NAC TFs in other Solanum species.2. Materials and methods2.1. Identification of NAC gene family in potatoAll the files related to potato genome sequence data used for the identification and annotation of NAC proteins were downloaded from the PGSC data sharing site (http://www.potatogenome.net/index.php/Main_Page). The Hidden Markov Model (HMM) profile of the NAM domain (PF02365) retrieved from Pfam 26.0 (http://Pfam.sanger.ac.uk/) was exploited to identify the putative NAC proteins in S. tuberosum group Phureja DM 1-3 516 R44 (DM) protein (v3.4) database using HMM search, with an expected value (e-value) cut-off of 1.0. The sequences of all identified DM protein (DMP) models were subjected to Pfam analysis to confirm the presence of NAM domain, with an e-value cut-off of 1e-3. Keyword searches in NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), UniProt (www.uniprot.org) and PlantTFDB v2.0 (http://planttfdb.cbi.edu.cn/) databases were also performed to identify potato NAC proteins. Arabidopsis thaliana orthologs for potato NAC proteins were identified using BLASTp search against Arabidopsis proteins TAIR10 release (http://www.arabidopsis.org). Prediction of membrane-bound StNAC proteins was performed using the TMHMM server v. 2.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/).2.2. Mapping NAC genes on chromosomes, their nomenclature and gene duplicationThe position of each potato NAC gene on potato chromosomes was identified using the potato genome browser at the PGSC site. For nomenclature, prefix ‘St’ for S. tuberosum was added followed by NAC and numbered according to its position from top to bottom on the potato chromosome 1–12. Alternatively, spliced forms were represented by Arabic numbers after ‘.’ sign. To search for potential duplicated potato NAC genes, MCScanX software was used.45 All 56 218 potato genes were compared against themselves using BLASTp, with criterion of tabular format (-m 8) and e-value of <1e-5. The resulting blast hits were incorporated along with chromosome coordinates of all protein-coding genes as an input for MCScanX and classified into segmental, tandem, proximal and dispersed duplications under default criterion.2.3. Phylogenetic analysis and identification of conserved motifsMultiple sequence alignment of the full-length protein sequences along with three representative Arabidopsis NAC proteins, ANAC019 (AT1G52890), ANAC055 (AT3G15500) and ANAC072/RD26 (AT4G27410),26 was performed using CluatalW2 program with default parameters. Phylogenetic tree was plotted using MEGA5.05 software by the Neighbor-joining method with 1000 bootstrap replicates.46 To study the phylogenetic relationship of potato NAC proteins along with their counterparts in Arabidopsis and rice, full-length NAC protein sequences were retrieved from TAIR10 (http://www.arabidopsis.org) and RGAP7 (http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/), respectively, as described.6 Multiple sequence alignment was performed, and unrooted tree was plotted as described above. The conserved motifs in full-length NAC proteins were identified using Multiple Expectation Maximization for Motif Elicitation (MEME) program version 4.9.0, with default parameters except the maximum number of motifs to find was set to 10.47 To predict the secondary structure of potato NAC domain, full-length NAC sequences were aligned along with the known NAC domain structures using Promals3D web program.48 We considered three known structures of NAC domains obtained from PDB accession number, 1UT4 (A. thaliana), 3SWM (A. thaliana) and 3ULX (Oryza sativa), which have most of the hits of StNAC proteins by BLAST PDB (e-value of <1e-04 and maximum identity of >40%).2.4. Potato RNA-seq data analysisFor expression profiling of potato NAC genes, we utilized the Illumina RNA-seq data that were previously generated by the PGSC41 and analysed by Massa et al.49 The RNA-seq data of 40 libraries representing a wide range of developmental stages, abiotic and biotic stress treatments and hormone treatments were generated using Illumina Genome Analyser II platform (Supplementary Table S1).49 Transcript abundance is expressed as fragments per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads (FPKM) values (Supplementary Table S2). Heat maps for only those genes were generated, which have positive FPKM values in at least one or more of the samples. For the developmental stage dataset, FPKM values were log2 transformed, before generating heat maps. For abiotic, biotic stress and hormone treatments, relative expression ratios were calculated relative to their respective controls. Heat maps were generated and hierarchical clustering done using the Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) MeV v4.4.1 software package.502.5. Plant material, in vitro culture and stress treatmentsThe shoot cultures of potato cv Kufri Sutlej, procured from Central Potato Research Institute, Shimla (India), were maintained under in vitro conditions. Potato shoots were inoculated into the Murashige and Skoog51 (MS) medium through nodal cuttings and incubated under a 16-h photoperiod (70 ± 5 µmol m-2 s-1 photosynthetic photon flux density) at 25 ± 2°C and 50–60% relative humidity. After three weeks, shoots were subjected to NaCl (100 mM), polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG, 10%), cold (4°C), heat (42°C), ABA (100 µM) and salicylic acid (SA, 300 µM) treatments for 4 and 24 h. After stipulated time, the plantlets were harvested, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C until used. Shoots grown on MS basal medium at 25°C served as control. For the collection of root, stem, old leaf and young leaf samples, in vitro raised plantlets of potato cv. Kufri Sutlej were hardened and grown under contained conditions. Two-month-old plants were uprooted, and samples were harvested and frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C until used.2.6. RNA isolation and quantitative real-time PCRTotal RNA was isolated from 100 mg of frozen tissue using iRIS solution following the method as described.52 First-strand cDNA synthesis was done using RevertAid™ RNAse H minus cDNA synthesis kit as per manufacturer's instructions (Fermentas Life Sciences, USA). The primers for quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis were designed using the Primer3 v.0.4.0 software (http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/; Supplementary Table S3). Reverse primers were designed preferentially from 3'-untranslated region wherever possible, because it is generally more unique than coding sequence and closer to the reverse transcriptase (RT) start site. To check the primer specificity, amplicons obtained after PCR were sequenced using the BigDye terminator sequencing kit on an automated DNA sequencer (3730 ×l DNA Analyser, Applied Biosystems, USA). The amplicon sequences are presented in Supplementary Table S3. The qRT-PCR assays were performed with three biological and three technical replicates. Each reaction was performed in 20 µl reaction mixture containing diluted cDNA sample as template and 2× Power SYBR Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems), and 200 nM each of forward and reverse gene specific primers. The reactions were performed using the MX 3000P Real-Time PCR system (Stratagene) with the following programme: 95°C (90 s) [94°C (30 s), corresponding annealing temperature (30 s), 72°C (30 s)] × 40 cycles. The specificity of the amplification was also determined by dissociation curve analysis in each case. To normalize the variance in cDNA input, elongation factor 1-a (ef1a) gene was used as the internal control as suggested earlier.53 The relative expression ratio of each gene was calculated using the comparative Ct value method.543. Results and discussion3.1. Identification and nomenclature of the NAC family members in potatoTo identify the putative NAC proteins in potato genome, HMM search was performed using the HMM profile of the NAM domain. This HMM search resulted in identification of 145 protein models (DMPs), which were encoded by 118 gene models (DMGs; Supplementary Table S4). Subsequently, all 145 protein sequences were subjected to Pfam analysis, with e-value cut-off of 1e-3, which resulted in identification of 136 NAC proteins encoded by 110 genes, because nine DMPs, either with no N-terminal NAM domain or with its e-value of >1e-3 were excluded. A keyword search against the NCBI, UniProt and PlantTFDB databases resulted in identification of 12, 7 and 40 previously annotated potato NAC proteins sequences, respectively (Supplementary Table S5). A careful analysis confirmed the presence of these proteins in the list of 136 NAC proteins identified through HMM search in potato genome. Hence, we show that potato NAC family is comprised of 136 NAC proteins, which are encoded by 110 genes (Table 1). Thus, NAC family in the potato is also comprised of >100 genes as reported for Arabidopsis, rice, poplar, soybean, tobacco, maize and grape.6–10 The annotations for potato NAC proteins reported in the NCBI and UniProt databases were highly disordered and uninformative (Supplementary Table S5). Thus, a uniform nomenclature has been assigned to 136 potato NAC proteins. Potato NAC proteins are designated as StNAC followed by Arabic number 1–110 based on the position of their corresponding genes on chromosomes 1–12 and from top to bottom (Table 1). Alternatively, spliced proteins are designated by same name by adding Arabic number 1, 2 and so on after ‘.’ sign. Similar criteria have also been adapted for the nomenclature of NAC proteins in soybean8 and WRKY proteins in maize.55 Of 110 StNAC genes, 19 (~17%) undergo alternative splicing (Table 1). However, in rice, of 151 NAC genes, 15 (~10%) were reported to produce alternative spliced transcripts.56 The higher frequency of splicing events in potato NAC family than that of rice is in agreement with the previous reports, where in potato genome 9875 genes (25.3%) have been shown to undergo alternative splicing,41 whereas in rice genome, 8772 (15.7%) genes undergo alternative splicing.57 The higher frequency of alternative splicing events in potato NAC family indicates more functional divergence of StNACs than that of rice. The length of StNAC proteins identified in this study ranges from 56 to 901 amino acids (aa) with an average of ~312 aa. Whereas, in Populus, the size of NAC proteins ranges from 117 to 718 aa with an average of 342 aa.7 In potato, the StNAC054 (56 aa) is the smallest StNAC protein, wherein NAM domain appears to be truncated at C-terminal end (Supplementary Fig. S1). Whereas, StNAC036.1 is the largest StNAC protein (901 aa) and contains two NAM domains. However, the NAM domain at its C-terminal end (StNAC036.1C) appears to be truncated lacking subdomain A and B (Supplementary Fig. S2). List of NAC transcription factor genes in potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) along with their corresponding proteins, CDS and protein length, duplications and Arabidopsis thaliana orthologsList of NAC transcription factor genes in potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) along with their corresponding proteins, CDS and protein length, duplications and Arabidopsis thaliana orthologsIn all StNAC proteins, only NAM domain is present, except in StNAC034, where an additional tyrosine kinase domain (PF07714) is also found. To check whether any NAC protein along with kinase domain is reported from any other organism, extensive BLAST searches of the NCBI database (All GenBank, EMBL, DDBJ and PDB) were performed. Interestingly, no protein was found to have NAM and protein kinase domains together, indicating that potato StNAC034 uniquely possess an additional tyrosine kinase domain. Tyrosine protein kinase catalyses ATP-dependent phosphorylation of the tyrosine residue on target proteins and plays a central role in many signalling pathways in plants.58 The NAC proteins have been shown to physically interact with protein kinase SnRK1 a-subunits AKIN10 and AKIN11.59 Thus, tyrosine protein kinase domain in StNAC034 may be responsible for regulating its activity by autophosphorylation. However, experimental evidences are required to establish the precise role of tyrosine kinase domain in the regulation of StNAC034 activity.Since, Arabidopsis is considered a model plant system for plant biology research, and many of its NAC genes have been functionally characterized, its orthologous NAC proteins to StNACs have been assigned in this study (Table 1). Interestingly, this analysis has identified StNAC072 and StNAC101 as orthologs of Arabidopsis RD26 with strong e-value support. Previously, RD26 has been shown to be involved in the ABA-dependent stress-signalling pathway.20 Overexpression of rice OsNAC6, ortholog of Arabidopsis RD26, conferred dehydration and salinity stress tolerance in rice.28,29 Thus, functional characterization of these RD26 orthologs will be of immense interest.3.2. Chromosomal distribution and duplication events among StNAC genesThe physical map position of 105 StNAC genes on 12 potato chromosomes was identified. However, five StNAC genes could not be anchored on any of the potato chromosomes. Similarly, out of 438 NB-LRR genes, physical map position for 370 (84%) genes was predicted on potato chromosomes.42 The 105 members of the StNAC gene family are distributed non-randomly on 12 potato chromosomes (Fig. 1). Chromosomes 2 and 4 each contains the largest number of StNAC genes comprising 14 members (~13%), whereas chromosome 9 contains only three members (~3%; Supplementary Fig. S3). Based on the previously defined criteria,42 16 clusters comprising of 40 StNAC genes distributed on nine potato chromosomes were identified (Fig. 1). Chromosome 2 contains the maximum number of clusters (3) comprising of nine StNAC genes, whereas chromosomes 1, 5, 8 and 10 each contain single cluster. Genes belonging to a family are often distributed in clusters at certain chromosomal regions. NAC family genes in rice, poplar and soybean were also found to be distributed in clusters.6–8Chromosomal distribution of 105 potato NAC genes identified in this study. The chromosome number is indicated on the top of each chromosome. Values in parenthesis following each gene represent its position on the chromosome. Arrows pointing downward and upward represents forward and reverse orientation of the respective gene, respectively, on the chromosome. Sixteen clusters of StNAC genes are indicated in boxes. Grey bars on chromosome 1, 2, 5 and 12 represent known gaps in the chromosome assembly.Chromosomal distribution of 105 potato NAC genes identified in this study.

Grey bars on chromosome 1, 2, 5 and 12 represent known gaps in the chromosome assembly.Sequencing and analysis of the potato genome revealed that it has undergone two rounds of whole-genome duplication.41 Moreover, the large size of StNAC gene family suggests that it has evolved through a large number of duplication events in potato. In whole potato genome, we have identified 12083 (23.47%) genes as tandem and 4253 (8.26%) genes as segmental duplicated (Supplementary Tables S6 and S7). Among StNAC genes, 20 were found to be segmentally duplicated, which are located on duplicated segments on chromosomes 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11 and 12 (Table 1 and Fig. 2). Maximum five StNACs are located in duplicated segments on each chromosomes 6 and 8, followed by three StNACs on chromosome 3, and two StNACs on chromosome 2. Duplicated segments on chromosome 4, 7, 10, 11 and 12 each contains one StNAC. Interestingly, all the StNAC gene containing chromosomal segments have a StNAC gene in its duplicated segment, suggesting that all the StNAC genes have been retained in potato after segmental duplications. Similarly, 9 NAC genes in rice6 and 21 NAC genes in grape10 were found to be segmentally duplicated. In addition, 27, 10 and 46 StNACs were also found to be tandem, proximal and dispersed duplicated, respectively (Table 1), which might have also contributed to the expansion of the StNAC family.

Structural and phylogenetic analysis of StNAC proteinsMultiple sequence alignment of full-length StNAC proteins along with three representative Arabidopsis NAC proteins,26 such as ANAC019, ANAC055 and ANAC072/RD26, revealed that most of the StNAC proteins contain highly conserved N-terminal NAC domain, divided into five subdomains (A– E) and a highly variable C-terminal transcriptional regulation domain as described previously (Supplementary Fig. S1).36 However, of 136, 13 StNACs lack conserve A and/or B subdomains, and four StNACs do not contain conserve C and/or D subdomains. Such NAC proteins may be described as NAC-like proteins similar to the description of these proteins in soybean and rice.8,60 All the StNAC proteins, except StNAC054 and StNAC075, contain a conserved nuclear localization signal sequence (NLS) lying within the D subdomain. Phylogenetic tree made from multiple sequence alignment of all 136 StNAC proteins divided them into 12 distinct subgroups (Fig. 3A). Subgroup V consists of the maximum (25) number of StNAC proteins, while subgroup II, III and IV each contain minimum four StNAC proteins. In similar studies, phylogenetic analysis divided poplar and soybean NACs into 10 and 6 subgroups, respectively.7,8 These observations indicate that NAC proteins in potato posses more diversity than poplar and soybean. To further examine the diversity in potato NAC genes, conserved motifs were predicted by using MEME program (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Fig. S4). In general, NAC proteins clustered in same subgroups, share similar motif composition, indicating functional similarities among members of the same subgroup (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, most of the conserved motifs were found lying within the N-terminal NAC domain, indicating that these motifs may be essential for the function of NAC proteins. While, none of the conserved motifs were found at the diversified C-terminal ends of the NAC proteins. Motifs 2, 5, 1, 3 and 6 representing the subdomains A, B, C, D and E, respectively, were present in most of the StNAC proteins. We have also predicted the secondary structure of conserved motifs corresponding to subdomains A–E covering the whole NAC domain (Supplementary Fig. S5). Previously, it was shown that NAC domain monomer consists of a twisted anti-parallel ß-sheet, which packs against an N-terminal a-helix on one side and a short helix on the other side.39 Similarly in our analysis, a ß-sheet in subdomain B was found to be flanked with a a-helix in subdomain A and another a-helix in subdomain B. In total, six ß-sheets and two a-helices were predicted, which is in agreement with the previous report.39 However, in order to gain further insights into the structural features of StNAC domains, three-dimensional structure determination by X-ray crystallography would be required in future. Phylogenetic relationship and conserved motif compositions of StNAC proteins. (A) Multiple sequence alignment of 136 full-length StNAC proteins was done using ClustalW2, and the phylogenetic tree was constructed using MEGA5.05 by the Neighbor-joining method with 1000 bootstrap replicates. The tree was divided into 12 phylogenetic subgroups designated as I to XII marked with different colour backgrounds. (B) Schematic representation of the conserved motifs in the StNAC proteins as revealed by MEME analysis. Grey lines represent the non-conserved sequences, and each motif is represented by a box numbered at the bottom. The length of protein can be estimated using the scale at the bottom.Phylogenetic relationship and conserved motif compositions of StNAC proteins.

The phylogenetic tree divided StNACs into 18 distinct subgroups (NAC-a to NAC-r) along with their Arabidopsis and rice orthologs (Fig. 4). In general, the Arabidopsis, rice and potato NAC proteins were distributed uniformly in all the subgroups. Exceptionally, NAC-d subgroup contains only Arabidopsis and rice NACs, but no potato NAC. Remarkably, NAC-q subgroup contains 36 potato NACs, but no Arabidopsis and rice NAC. This observation suggests that diversification and expansion of StNACs present in the NAC-q subgroup took place after the divergence of potato, Arabidopsis and rice. Previously, tobacco NAC family was shown to contain a Solanaceae-specific novel subfamily, TNAC, that contains approximately 50 TNAC genes.9 We sought to determine whether these 36 StNACs clustered in the NAC-q subgroup belong to the TNAC subfamily. Multiple sequence alignment of NAC domain sequences of all 136 StNACs along with three representative Arabidopsis NACs (ANAC019, ANAC055 and ANAC072), two tobacco NACs (NCBI accession numbers BAA78417and ADQ08688) and seven tobacco TNACS (NCBI accession numbers ACF19785, ACF19786, ACF19787, ACF19788, ACF19789, ACF19790 and ACF19791) was carried out, and an unrooted tree was made. Interestingly, StNACs classified in the NAC-q subgroup, clustered together with tobacco TNACS (Supplementary Fig. S6), while rest of the StNACs was clustered separately along with ANACs and tobacco NACs. Thus, we suggest that these 36 StNACs may be designated as TNACs, which were also subdivided into three clades represented by A, B and C as proposed earlier.9 Our analysis provides further evidence that TNAC subfamily is exclusive to Solanaceae family. However, their functional characterization would be required to ascertain if they play some unique role(s) in plant processes, in which NAC proteins have not been implicated, so far. Phylogenetic tree of NAC proteins of potato, Arabidopsis and rice. Multiple sequence alignment of full-length NAC proteins was done using ClustalW2, and the phylogenetic tree was constructed using MEGA5.05 by the Neighbor-joining method with 1000 bootstrap replicates. The tree was divided into 18 phylogenetic subgroups, designated as NAC-a to NAC-r. Members of potato, Arabidopsis and rice were denoted by triangle, circle and diamond respectively. Subgroup NAC-q represents the TNAC subgroup, which seems restricted to Solanaceae.Phylogenetic tree of NAC proteins of potato, Arabidopsis and rice.

Membrane-bound StNAC subfamilyNAC membrane-bound TFs (MTFs) have been implicated in plant response to abiotic stress.15,17,37 Using TMHMM server v. 2.0, we identified 14 (~10%) StNAC proteins containing a-helical TMs (Fig. 5A and Supplementary Table S8). Notably, primary transcripts of a large number of StNAC MTF genes (7 of 10) are alternatively spliced, which also code for proteins lacking the TM (Table 1 and Fig. 5A), suggesting that their activity may also be regulated at protein level through interaction between full-length and the alternatively spliced forms. Similar to Arabidopsis and rice NAC MTFs,38 all the identified StNAC MTFs also contain single TM at their C-terminal (Fig. 5A). Recently in soybean, of 152 GmNACs, 11 have been predicted to contain TMs. However, GmNAC013 and GmNAC136 were found to contain two TMs.8 Previously, 13 members of the Arabidopsis NAC family were predicted to be membrane-associated and named as NTL 1–13 (for NTM1 like).61 Later, a genome-wide analysis predicted 18 NTLs in Arabidopsis and 5 NTLs (OsNTLs) in rice.38 However, they have not assigned nomenclature for additional five Arabidopsis NTLs. Thus, to maintain uniformity, numbers from 14 to 18 are assigned to additional NTLs in this study. Phylogenetic analysis of the potato, Arabidopsis and rice NAC MTFs divided them into five clades (Fig. 5B). Maximum (14) NTLs were clustered together in Clade IV, followed by 7 each in Clades I and II, and 3 each in Clades III and V. In future, functional characterization of StNAC MTFs may identify candidate genes to engineering abiotic stress tolerance in potato and other Solanaceae plants, as well.

Differential expression of StNAC genes in various tissues/developmental stagesTo identify overlapping and tissue-specific expression profile of StNAC genes, we utilized transcriptome data derived from Illumina RNA-Seq reads generated by PGSC41 and analysed by Massa et al.49 The potato RNA-seq data provide the expression of over 22 000 potato genes in 16 tissues representing major organs and developmental stages, grouped into five major classes; floral (carpels, petals, sepals, stamens and whole mature flower), fruit (immature, mature and inside of fruit), stolon/tubers (stolons, tuber1 and tuber2), leaf (leaves, petioles) and other tissues (shoots, roots and callus).Transcript abundance of 69 StNACs in 16 different developmental stages and organs was obtained, while rest of the 41 StNACs either transcribe at too low level to be detected or have spatial and temporal expression pattern not covered in the RNA-seq libraries. Of these 69 StNACs, 20 (~29%) are ubiquitously expressed in all 16 tissues, while 21 (~30%) express in 1–5, 11 (10%) in 6–10 and 17 (~15%) in 11–15 number of tissues (Fig. 6). Some of the StNACs also exhibit tissue-specific expression, for example, StNAC034 and StNAC075 express only in floral tissues, StNAC002, StNAC025, StNAC087 and StNAC091 in fruit tissues, StNAC073 in stolon/tuber tissues and StNAC082 specifically in root tissue (Fig. 6). These observations indicate that various StNACs may be associated with diversified functions similar to their Arabidopsis orthologs, for example, ANAC098 (CUC2; ortholog of StNAC034) regulates gynoecium development62 and Arabidopsis, vascular-related NAC domain 5 (VND5; ortholog of StNAC082), regulates the differentiation of root protoxylem vessels in co-operation with other VND proteins.63 The tissue-specific expression profiling of StNACs might enable the combinatorial usage of StNACs in transcriptional regulation of different tissues, whereas ubiquitously expressed StNACs might regulate the transcription of a broad set of genes. For example, a rice NAC gene, OsNAC10 predominantly expressed in roots and panicles and induced by drought, salinity and ABA, when overexpressed with root-specific promoter RCc3, improved root growth, enhanced drought tolerance and increased grain yield significantly under field drought conditions.31Heat map representation and hierarchical clustering of StNAC genes across different tissues and developmental stages.

Differential expression of StNAC genes during abiotic and biotic stressesSeveral NAC proteins have been shown to play important roles in biotic and abiotic stress responses in plants.23,24 A microarray analysis in rice revealed induction of 46 NAC genes under abiotic and 26 by biotic stress.6 Thus, to identify the stress-responsive StNAC genes, we performed comprehensive expression profiling of StNAC genes using the Illumina RNA-Seq data. Abiotic stress treatments (24 h treatment of in vitro grown whole plants) include salt (150 mM NaCl), mannitol (260 µM) and heat (35°C). Relative transcript abundance for each treatment was calculated with respect to their respective controls.Under abiotic stress treatments, 48 StNAC genes express in one or more of the conditions. Of these 48 StNACs, StNAC017, StNAC030, StNAC086 and StNAC097 were found to be induced under all the three stresses, namely salt, mannitol and heat treatments (Fig. 7A). Previously, overexpression of multiple stress-responsive NAC genes, such as OsNAC6, ONAC063, ONAC045 and SNAC2, conferred multiple abiotic stresses in transgenic plants.28–30 Some of the StNACs also exhibit induction under specific stress conditions, for example, StNAC024, StNAC067 and StNAC108 were induced specifically under salt stress, while StNAC053 and StNAC080 induced only under mannitol treatment and StNAC071 and StNAC085 induced under heat stress only (Fig. 7A). Interestingly, expression of Arabidopsis RD26 orthologs, StNAC072 and StNAC101, was highly induced by salt, mannitol and ABA treatments (Fig. 7A and C). Previously, expression of RD26 was found to be induced by dehydration and ABA and its overexpression conferred hypersensitivity to ABA in transgenic Arabidopsis, while RD26 repressed plants were insensitive.20 Overexpression of multiple stress-responsive rice NAC gene, OsNAC6 having high sequence similarity with Arabidopsis RD26, conferred dehydration and salinity stress tolerance in rice.28,29 Functional characterization of RD26 orthologs identified in this study may provide opportunities to develop abiotic stress tolerant transgenic potato and other Solanaceae crops.

Heat maps were generated using the TIGR MeV v4.1.1 software. Bar at the bottom of each heat map represents relative expression values, thereby values 0, 1.0 and 2.0 represent downregulated, unaltered and upregulated expression, respectively.Heat map representation and hierarchical clustering of StNAC genes during (A) abiotic stress, (B) biotic stress and (C) hormone treatments.

A total of 44 StNACs were found to be expressed in one or more of the biotic stress conditions (Fig. 7B). Interestingly, StNAC005 was found to be induced under all the biotic stress conditions, except BABA treatment. Previously, its Arabidopsis ortholog, ANAC104 (AT5G64530.1; Table 1) was shown to be highly induced in Arabidopsis, challenged with plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 and human pathogen Escherichia coli O157:H7.64StNAC004 was also induced under P. infestans infection and wounding, but downregulated under BABA treatment. Expression of StNAC018, StNAC048 and StNAC081 was induced only under P. infestans infection (Fig. 7B). Expression of StNAC097 and StNAC110 was induced only under BABA treatment, whereas expression of StNAC007, StNAC090 and StNAC094 was induced only under BTH treatment. StNAC051 was induced only under wounding stress. Previously, NAC proteins were shown to positively regulate defence response by activating pathogenesis-related genes, which in turn induce hypersensitive response and cell death at the site of infection.21 In contrast, NAC proteins have also been shown to negatively regulate defence response by suppressing defence-related gene expression.35 In future, it would be interesting to functionally characterize these biotic stress-responsive StNAC genes and to classify them as positive and negative regulators of pathogen defence response, especially against P. infestans infection.3.7. Differential expression of StNAC genes during hormone treatmentsNAC proteins have been shown to regulate a variety of plant processes by mediating hormone signalling. Thus, to identify hormone-responsive StNAC genes, we analysed the Illumina RNA-seq data, which include indole-3-acetic acid (IAA, 10 µM), 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP, 10 µM), gibberellic acid (GA3, 50 µM) and ABA (50 µM) treatment to in vitro grown whole plants for 24 h.49 Of 110 StNAC genes, 45 express under one or more of the hormone treatments (Fig. 7C). Interestingly, expression of StNAC090 was induced under all the phytohormone treatments that were analysed in this study. Expression of StNAC016 and StNAC059 was induced under both, BAP and GA3 treatments. In Fig. 5, we showed that StNAC059 is a membrane-bound NAC TF. A membrane-bound, cytokinin-inducible Arabidopsis NAC TF, NTM1 regulates cytokinin signalling during cell division.18 Similarly, Arabidopsis NTL8 regulates salt-responsive flowering via FLOWERING LOCUS T15 and mediates salt regulation of seed germination via the GA pathway.37NTL8 expression was found to be induced by high salinity, but was unaffected by ABA. Similarly, StNAC059 expression was induced by salt stress (Fig. 7A), but remained unaffected by ABA treatment (Fig. 7C). Interestingly, StNAC059 and Arabidopsis NTL8 clustered together in Clade IV (Fig. 5B), indicating that they also share sequence similarity with each other. StNAC005 was induced only under IAA treatment. Overexpression of its Arabidopsis ortholog, ANAC104/XND1 (AT5G64530), resulted in extreme dwarfism associated with the absence of xylem vessels and little or no expression of tracheary element marker genes. Previously, differentiation of tracheary elements was shown to be enhanced by auxin.65 In addition, StNAC017, StNAC072, StNAC090 and StNAC101 were found to be highly responsive to ABA. These observations indicate that function of some of the NAC proteins might be conserved among species.3.8. Validation of expression pattern of StNAC genes using qRT-PCRExpression profiling of members of large gene families using publicly available data (for, e.g. EST, microarray, MPSS and RNA-seq data), followed by validation of the expression pattern of selected genes using qRT-PCR, is a valuable approach, which provides preliminary indications about the function of newly identified genes and often been recently exploited.7,8 However, in some instances, data obtained from different methods may differ. Thus, in order to validate the expression pattern of StNAC genes, we have carefully selected few representative StNAC genes with diverse expression patterns and performed qRT-PCR analysis. As shown in Fig. 8, the qRT-PCR results of (22 of 24) representative StNAC genes in young leaf (YL), old leaf (OL), stem and root tissues of potato were found to be largely in good agreement with the RNA-seq data (Fig. 6). However, only in case of two genes (StNAC074 and StNAC034), qRT-PCR data differed from the RNA-seq data. These minor differences could be either due to difference in the stage of the plant at which the samples were collected or could be genotype dependent. For example, all the samples for RNA-seq analysis were collected from greenhouse grown plants, except root and shoot tissues, which were collected from in vitro grown plants,49 whereas, in the present study, all the samples were collected from in vitro raised hardened plantlets grown for 2 months in greenhouse. The relative expression ratio of 24 representative StNAC genes in young leaf (YL), old leaf (OL), stem and root tissues of potato determined using qRT-PCR. Relative expression ratios in different tissue samples have been calculated with reference to tissue sample in which the respective transcript exhibited the lowest expression. The relative expression values were log10 transformed. qRT-PCR data were normalized using potato elongation factor 1-a gene. The name of the gene is written on the top of each bar diagram.

(Error bars indicate standard deviation.)In another experiment, we have carried out qRT-PCR analysis of 16 representative StNAC genes under salt (100 mM NaCl), PEG 6000 (10%), heat (42°C) and ABA (100 µM) treatments to validate the expression pattern as revealed by RNA-Seq analysis. In addition, cold (4°C) and SA (300 µM) treatments were also included as one of the most prominent abiotic stresses and elicitor of the biotic stress response, respectively. The qRT-PCR results under these treatments also corroborate the expression profile as revealed by RNA-seq analysis. For example, expression of StNAC030 was induced after 4 h of salt stress imposition and maintained upto 24 h, whereas its expression was induced after 24 h of heat and ABA treatment (Fig. 9), corroborating the RNA-seq data (Fig. 7). Expression of Arabidopsis RD26 orthologs, StNAC072 and StNAC101, was also found to be highly induced by stress and ABA treatments, which is in agreement with the RNA-seq data (Fig. 7A and C) and previous reports.20 These results strongly suggest that preliminary expression profiling using publicly available expression data followed by its validation using qRT-PCR provide more reliable expression profile of members of large gene families in less time with reduced expenditure.

ConclusionsThe present effort to identify and describe key attributes of uncharacterized NAC TFs in potato genome using high-throughput genome-wide survey, and utilization of available expression data coupled with molecular tools provides foundation of our understanding of their regulatory roles. Our comprehensive genome-wide analysis led to identification of 136 NAC TF proteins encoded by 110 genes in potato. A uniform nomenclature and annotation was provided to the identified genes and proteins, followed by their comparative phylogenetic analysis with Arabidopsis and rice NAC TFs. Phylogenetic analysis led to identification of TNAC subfamily comprising of 36 StNACs. Similar to tobacco, the presence of TNAC subfamily in potato provides further evidence of its existence in Solanaceae plants only. Considering the fact that most of the biological functions played by NAC TFs have been revealed using Arabidopsis NAC genes, we assigned Arabidopsis orthologs to each StNAC protein. The comparative analysis of StNACs with their respective Arabidopsis ortholog helped us to predict the potential functions of several StNAC proteins. The availability of potato transcriptome data generated by the Illumina RNA-seq approach has been exploited as a useful tool for preliminary analysis of gene expression and identified tissue-specific, stress- and hormone-responsive StNAC genes. Additional experiments through their over- and/or under-expression will help in determining the precise function of these genes. It will also be intriguing to identify and functionally to characterize their promoters, which may be utilized to engineer potato plants with improved performance under stressful conditions, in future. Thus, this analysis provides preliminary indications of putative function of several StNAC genes, which will help in channelizing directional efforts for their functional characterization.Supplementary dataSupplementary Data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.We sincerely acknowledge the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, New Delhi, for financial support in the form of projects MLP0001 and BSC0107.

IntroductionApproximately 40–50% of the mammalian genome is derived from transposable elements, such as retrotransposons and DNA transposons.1–5 The Ty3/Gypsy long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons have been detected in various eukaryotic organisms including fungi, plants, insects, tunicates and echinoderms as well as in several vertebrates, such as fish, amphibians and reptiles, but not in mammals and birds.6 However, discrete regions within these elements have acquired new functions as novel endogenous genes and are highly conserved in marsupials and eutherians.7–12 Two major gene families derived from the Ty3/Gypsy LTR retrotransposons are the sushi-ichi retrotransposon homologue (SIRH) family (also called the MART or SUSHI family) comprising 12 genes encoding a Gag-like protein, each of which has 20–30% similarity to the sushi-ichi retrotransposon Gag in pufferfish (Takifugu rubripes),9–11 and the para-neoplastic antigen MA (PNMA) family also encoding the Gag-like protein homologous to the Gypsy12_DR retrotransposon Gag in zebrafish (DR, Danio rerio)13 comprising 15 and 11 genes in humans and mice, respectively. It should be noted that the homology between these two LTR retrotransposons is only 6.5% and 13.6% along with the entire Gag and Pol regions, respectively. PEG10/SIRH1 is a therian-specific gene, and PEG11/SIHR2 and the remaining SIRH3–11 seem eutherian specific, while SIRH12 was derived from a marsupial-specific retrotransposition event. We previously demonstrated that Peg10/Sirh1 and Peg11/Sirh2 are essential for placental formation and function in mice.7,8 Most PNMA genes are expressed in the brains of macaques and mice and their functions remain unknown.14PNMA1–3 were first identified as genes encoding neuronal auto-antigens using sera from patients with para-neoplastic neurological syndromes.15 Schüller et al.16 and Campillos et al.13 performed genome-wide analyses and identified additional 12 family genes in humans among which PNMA6 has no mouse orthologue. No Gypsy12_DR Gag-derived sequences were reported in birds,13 and thus, it is probable that the PNMA genes are also mammal specific. However, the search has been limited in several eutherian species and the existence of marsupial orthologues and/or marsupial-specific PNMA genes remained unknown.Here, we conducted comprehensive in silico screening for the PNMA genes using the whole-genome shotgun (WGS) sequences of the grey short-tailed opossum4 and the tammar wallaby5 and identified a novel PNMA-MS1 gene as the first marsupial-specific PNMA gene.2. Materials and methods2.1. Animals and tissue collectionTammar wallabies (Macropus eugenii) of Kangaroo Island, South Australia origin, were maintained in The University of Melbourne marsupial breeding colony in grassy outdoor enclosures. Lucerne cubes, grass and water were provided ad libitum and supplemented with fresh vegetables. The day of birth of pouch young was designated as d0. When the day of birth was unknown, their age was estimated using the head length.17 Foetal tissues including the head and body were collected from two foetuses at Day 23 and 26 of gestation, and the yolk sac placenta (YSP) from four foetuses sampled between Day 23 and 26 of gestation. Tissues including the brain, liver, lung, kidney, ovary and testis were collected from two pouch young aged Day 60–70 after birth. The liver, lung, pancreas, stomach, bladder, heart, kidney, adrenal, spleen and brain (cerebrum and cerebellum) were collected from Day 152 and 162 pouch young. Adult female tissues, including the brain (thalamus, hypothalamus and pituitary), ovary (ovary with active corpus luteum, corpus luteum, ovary with developing follicle and ovary with primary or secondary follicle), endometrium (gravid endometrium and non-gravid endometrium) and mammary gland (sucked gland and non-sucked gland) were also collected from two adults. Grey short-tailed opossums (Monodelphis domestica) were purchased from a breeding colony in the Department of Physiology at the University of Melbourne. The brain, liver, spleen, pituitary and ovary were collected from five adult opossums. Experimental procedures conformed to the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council guidelines18 and were approved by the Animal Experimentation Ethics Committees of the University of Melbourne.2.2. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reactionGenomic DNA and total RNA from tissues were prepared by using TRIZOL (Invitrogen), as described in the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA was synthesized from 1 µg of total RNA using Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) with an oligo dT primer. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification for gene expression profiles were carried out using 10–100 ng of cDNA in a 25-µl reaction mixture containing 1 × ExTaq buffer, 2.5 mM deoxynucleotide triphosphasteses, 10 pmol primers and 1.25 U ExTaq HS (TaKaRa) and were subjected to 30–35 PCR cycles; 96°C for 15 s, 60–65°C for 30 s and 72°C for 15–120 s depending on the length of PCR products at the ratio of 1 min/kb. PCR products were visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis with ethidium bromide staining. The primers used for the expression profiles were as follows: PNMAMS1-F1 (5'-AAC ATG GTG GAG GAG TCT GGA T-3'), PNMAMS1-R1 (5'-CAA CGG TAA GGT GAC CTC TTG G-3'), wGAPDH-F1 (5'-AGA AAG TGG TGA AGC AGG CAT-3'), wGAPDH-R1 (5'-TGG AGG ACA TGT AGA CCA TGA G-3'), wGAPDH-F2 (5'-CCT ACT CCA ATG TAT CTG TGT-3'), wGAPDH-R2 (5'-GGT GGA ACT CCT TTT TTG ACT G-3'), LAMA3-F1 (5'-ACT CTG CAA AGA TCA GCA CAC C-3'), LAMA3-R1 (5'-CTC CTG CCT TCA GCA AGA AGA T-3'); PNMAMS2-F1 (5'-GGC TAA TGG AAA GTC ATA AGA AAG C-3'), PNMAMS2-R1 (5'-GAT TCC TTG ATA CAA ATG GTT GTC C-3'), PNMAMS2-F2 (5'-TTG ATG CAT TGT CTG AAA CCA G-3'), PNMAMS2-R2 (5'-ATC TAT CAA CCA AGC GCC AAC T-3'); oOAZ1-F1 (5'-ATA AAC CCA GCA CCA CCG TCC ACG-3'), oOAZ1-R1 (5'-GGT CTC ACA ATC TCA AAG CCC AAA AAG-3').2.3. 5'- and 3'-RACERapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) reactions were performed with the tammar liver using the RNA SMARTER RACE cDNA Amplification kit (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The 5'- and 3'-RACE fragments were generated with the following gene-specific primers: PNMAMS1-5'RACE-GSP1 (5'-TGC GTA TGG AGG GGA GAG TGA GCA AG-3') and PNMAMS1-3'RACE-GSP1 (5'-GAC TGT GCC ATC GGG AGA AGG TGA AC-3'), and nested PCR was performed with following primers: PNMAMS1-5'RACE-GSP2 (5'-CAG ACA AGG TGG GGT CTG TCT CTT C-3') and PNMAMS1-3'-RACE-GSP2 (5'-TTC CTG TGA AGG TCT CCC TCT C-3'), respectively.2.4. Detection and prediction of the Gypsy12_DR Gag-derived genesFor the detection of PNMA family genes, we performed TBLASTN searches (e-value <1.0E-9) using the NCBI server (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) against eutherian reference genomic sequences and marsupial WGS sequences using the Gypsy12-I_DR Gag protein sequence from Repbase (http://www.girinst.org/) as a query . After TBLASTN searches, sequences that encoded open reading frames (ORFs) with >100 aa (amino acids) were selected for the next analysis. Secondary screening was performed with all the sequences that were selected by first screening as a query. In addition, only sequences encoding proteins with >100 aa were considered to be candidate PNMA family genes and those with <100 aa were considered as PNMA pseudogenes. Genome resources used were: Homo sapiens (GRCh37.p5), Mus musculus (MGSCv37), M. eugenii (Meug_1.1) and M. domestica (MonDom5). ORF prediction was performed using an ORF finder (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gorf/gorf.html).2.5. Multiple alignment and phylogenetic treePNMA family genes and retrotransposons from Repbase were aligned using the MEGA 5.0 (Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis). Phylogenetic tree analysis was also performed using the MEGA 5.0. The tree was inferred using the neighbour-joining method with the bootstrap test (1000 replicates). The evolutionary distances were computed using the p-distance method and are in the units of the number of amino acid differences per site. All ambiguous positions were removed for each sequence pair.2.6. Comparative genomic analysisFor comparison of the marsupial PNMA-MS1 and -MS2 genomic regions with the corresponding regions in eutherian species, we extracted the following sequences from Ensembl (http://www.ensembl.org); PNMA-MS1; M. eugenii (GeneScaffold: Meug_1.0: 503: 24 720–39 177), M. domestica (Chromosome: MonDom5: 3: 260 858 116–260 881 268), H. sapiens (Chromosome: GRCh37: 18: 21 343 369–21 355 887), M. musculus (Chromosome: GRCm37: 18: 12 572 248–12 578 437), Ornithorhynchus anatinus (Chromosome: OANA5: 7: 17 676 195–17 684 806), Gallus gallus (Chromosome: WASHUC2: 2: 106 303 674–106 308 473), Xenopus tropicalis (Scaffold: JGI4.1: 84: 2 861 161–2 864 246), T. rubripes (Scaffold: FUGU4: 285: 98 142–99 106) and for PNMA-MS2; M. domestica (Chromosome: MonDom5: 1: 416 106 001–416 736 671), Tasmanian devil Sarcophilus harrisii (Scaffold: DEVIL_7.0: GL834637.1: 1–311 016), H. sapiens (Chromosome: GRCh37: 9: 125 122 856–125 594 315), M. musculus (Chromosome: GRCm37: 2: 36 078 175–37 218 455), O. anatinus (Chromosome: OANA5 : Ultra70 : 222 463–282 938), G. gallus (Chromosome: WASHUC2: 17: 9 467 383–9 508 331), X. tropicalis (Scaffold: JGI_4.2: GL173356.1: 228 227–292 347) and T. rubripes (Scaffold: FUGU4: scaffold_49: 144 872–154 417).Alignments were obtained using the VISTA Web server (http://genome.lbl.gov/vista/). PNMA-MS1 syntenic regions of several species identified above were aligned using the default setting (>70% identity and >100 bp in length) of mVISTA using the LAGAN global multiple alignment option.3. Results3.1. Novel candidate PNMA genes in humans and miceWe validated our approach to search for candidate PNMA genes in marsupials by performing TBLASTN analysis against human and mouse reference genomic sequences using the Gypsy12_DR Gag protein as a query. With a cut-off e-value of <1.0E-9, this screening resulted in 19 and 15 candidates in the human and mouse genomes, respectively. In humans, 15 of the 19 were known PNMA genes and the remaining 4 were novel putative PNMA genes, PNMA7/LOC649201, PNMA8/LOC649238, PNMA9/LOC100128960 and PNMA16 (Table 1, Humans). In mice, 12 of the 15 were known, with two novel putative PNMA genes, Pnma7/Gm7028 and Pnma9/Gm6858, and one pseudogene, Gm 1832215 identified (Table 1, Mouse).

Newly identified PNMA family genes in this study are coloured in grey. ‘Pseudo’ denotes putative ORFs from sequences detected by TBLASTN, which encode <100 aa.The putative human PNMA7–9 genes were located near PNMA6A–D cluster on Chromosome Xq28. There is a sequence gap between PNMA6A–B and 6C–D, so additional PNMA genes may exist in this region (Supplementary Fig. S1). The high homology (47–57%) between the putative amino acid sequences of the PNMA7–9 and PNMA6A–D genes suggested that they share a common ancestor and evolved by gene duplication (see Fig. 3). The putative murine Pnma7, 8 and 9 are all located in the orthologous region on the X chromosome. However, the PNMA6 cluster is absent from the mouse genome (Supplementary Fig. S1). This region is occupied by the X-linked leucocyte-regulated complex (Xlr) gene cluster.3.2. Identification of novel PNMA genes in marsupialsA comprehensive search of the tammar wallaby (Meug_1.1) and opossum WGS (MonDom5) for PNMA genes was then undertaken using the same method as the human and mouse above. Twenty and 14 hits were returned for TBLASTN searches of the tammar and opossum genomes, respectively (Table 1, Tammar wallaby and Opossum). However, most of the sequences were predicted to be pseudogenes or remnants of the original retrotransposons (<100 aa). Only ORFs predicted to encode >100 aa were considered to be marsupial PNMA candidate genes. One candidate exhibited the highest homology to the Gypsy12_DR Gag protein along with matrix (MA), N- and C-terminal parts of capsid like (N- and C-CA) and cys-cys-his-cys (CCHC) zinc finger domains and had a putative ORF consisting of 456 and 458 aa in the tammar and opossum, respectively (Fig. 1). Therefore, we named it PNMA-MS1 as a novel marsupial-specific PNMA gene. The marsupial PNMA-MS1 gene was located on a syntenic segment in the tammar (Gene scaffold_503:27168-31803) and the opossum (Chr.3: 260 874 625–260 879 998). A second PNMA candidate was identified in the opossum, PNMA-MS2, that had a putative ORF encoding 112 aa with high homology only to a central part of the capsid-like domain of the Gypsy12_DR Gag. It was located on Chromosome 1: 416 409 687–416 414 127, where an olfactory receptor (OR) gene cluster exists (see below). The presence of PNMA-MS2 in the tammar was inconclusive due to the incomplete assembly of the corresponding region of the genome. PNMA-MS1 and -MS2 have high homology to the Gypsy12_DR retrotransposon Gag protein. Boxes represent ORFs. Regions with significant similarity to a Gag protein of a Gypsy12_DR retrotransposon are shown in colours. PNMA-MS1 encodes a Gag-like protein including several typical domains and motifs, but lacks a Pol-like protein and LTR sequences attached to either end of the retrotransposons. Although PNMA-MS2 has a possible protein-coding frame corresponding to a central part of the capsid-like domain of the Gypsy12_DR Gag, it seems to be a pseudogene because no expression was confirmed.

Genomic structure of PNMA-MS1 in the tammar wallabyThe full-length sequence of tammar PNMA-MS1 consisting of 4290 bp was determined by 5'- and 3'-RACE. It has two exons and encodes a putative ORF encoding a 456 aa sequence (Fig. 2). The PNMA-MS1 putative ORF shared 28% similarity at the amino acid level with the Gag protein of Gypsy12_DR retrotransposon (Fig. 3A). Multiple alignment and phylogenetic tree analyses of the putative PNMA-MS1 and -MS2 amino acid sequences are shown in Fig. 3A and B. The Pol protein and LTR regions are absent from PNMA-MS1 and -MS2, suggesting that they no longer have retrotranspositional activity (Fig. 3A). The marsupial PNMA-MS1 and -MS2 protein sequences were grouped together and more closely related to the zebrafish Gypsy12_DR Gag than to the mouse and human proteins (Fig. 3B).

Comparative genomic analysis of PNMA-MS1 and -MS2To elucidate whether PNMA-MS1 is a marsupial-specific PNMA gene, comparative genomic analysis was performed using the VISTA tool with several vertebrate genomic sequences. PNMA-MS1 was located in the intron 8 of the laminin alpha 3 (LAMA3) gene that is highly conserved in vertebrates. No PNMA-MS1 orthologue was found in the syntenic region of any eutherian species, platypus (monotreme mammals), chicken (birds), frog (amphibian) and fugu (fish), demonstrating that PNMA-MS1 is marsupial specific (Fig. 4A). It indicates that PNMA-MS1 retrotransposition occurred only in the marsupial lineage after their divergence from eutherians (Fig. 5).

Where these regions coincide with ORF sequences of PNMA-MS1 or LAMA3, the peaks are shaded in purple. Where these regions coincide with the UTR region of PNMA-MS1, the peaks are shaded in light blue.

PNMA-MS1 insertion occurred in a marsupial ancestor prior to the radiation of marsupial species. PNMA-MS2 was only found in the opossum and not in the Tasmanian devil, human and mouse, which suggests that PNMA-MS2 was acquired only in the opossum lineage after the divergence of the Australian and South American marsupials, but it does not show active transcription. The insertion of eutherian PNMA family genes occurred in a eutherian ancestor prior to the radiation of eutherian species. There are no PNMA family genes (or pseudogenes) in the platypus (monotremes) and chicken (birds).Evolutionary pathway of the PNMA family in mammals.

At present, we cannot confirm the presence or absence of PNMA-MS2 in the tammar because the corresponding regions encompassing the PTGS1 and PDCL genes are yet to be completely assembled. Recently, another Australian marsupial genome of the Tasmanian devil has been sequenced, and the region syntenic to that between opossum OR1N2 and PDCL became available. It contains some gaps but none between opossum OR1Q1 and ENSMODG00000019710 (OR1J2-like pseudogene). A search of this region clearly demonstrated that the PNMA-MS2 orthologue is absent from the Tasmanian devil genome.The syntenic OR cluster lies between PTGS1 and PDCL in the human Chromosome 9 and mouse Chromosome 2, respectively, but neither the number nor the order of OR genes and pseudogenes are conserved. As the human and mouse genome sequences in this region are complete and contain no gaps, the absence of the PNMA-MS2 orthologue was confirmed (Fig. 4B). For the platypus, the PTGS1 and PDCL genes are located next to each other, with no OR gene cluster and no PNMA-MS2 orthologue, like in the chicken and fugu (Fig. 4B).These results suggest that the integration of selected OR genes occurred between the PTGS1 and PDCL genes in a common therian ancestor, and that the opossum-specific insertion of PNMA-MS2 occurred after the divergence of eutherians and marsupials and the geographic separation of Australian and South American marsupials (Fig. 5). However, the possibility that the PNMA-MS2 orthologue exists in some of Australian marsupial species cannot be excluded. It is possible that PNMA-MS2 was deleted from Australian marsupial species after integration in a common marsupial ancestor (Fig. 5).3.5. Expressions of PNMA-MS1 in the tammar wallaby and PNMA-MS2 in the opossumPNMA-MS1 expression was investigated in several tissues in four different stages of the tammar wallaby, including foetal and pouch young stages. Human LAMA3 is expressed ubiquitously (EST profile Hs.436367). To exclude the possibility that heterogenous nuclear RNA (hnRNA) was detected between exons 8 and 9 of the LAMA3 gene rather than PNMA-MS1, we amplified PNMA-MS1 using PCR primers designed within exons 1 and 2, respectively. Thus, the PCR product was shorter than its genomic sequence corresponding to hnRNAs of LAMA3 and PNMA-MS1. LAMA3 expression was analysed using primers designed to exons 79 and 81, near the 3'-UTR, due to the poor genome sequence quality in introns 84–90 of tammar LAMA3. Tammar LAMA3 expression was almost ubiquitous, with the exception of several pouch young tissues.From Day 23 to 26 pregnancy, PNMA-MS1 expression was detected in the foetal head and body, but there was no expression in the YSP (Fig. 6A). In pouch young aged Day 60–70, PNMA-MS1 was detected only in the brain, kidney and ovary, but not in the liver, lung or testis (Fig. 6B). In Day 152 and 162 pouch young, changes in PNMA-MS1 expression were minimal, with expression detected in the kidney, liver, pancreas, heart, spleen and stomach, but not in the lung, bladder, adrenal, cerebrum or cerebellum (Fig. 6C). In the adult female, the brain (thalamus, hypothalamus and pituitary), ovary (ovary with active corpus luteum, corpus luteum alone, ovary with enlarged developing follicle and ovary with primary or secondary follicles), endometrium (gravid endometrium and non-gravid endometrium) and mammary gland (sucked gland and non-sucked gland) were examined. PNMA-MS1 expression was detected in the ovary (all four stages), mammary gland (sucked and non-sucked) and thalamus, but not in the hypothalamus or pituitary (Fig. 6D). There was no expression in either the gravid, or non-gravid, endometrium. Expression profiles of PNMA-MS1 in the tammar wallaby.

However, there was no expression in these tissues, suggesting that PNMA-MS2 is not active in the opossum (data not shown). Although we cannot exclude the possibility that it may be expressed in a stage or tissue-specific manner, we conclude that PNMA-MS2 is a pseudogene.4. Discussion4.1. PNMA-MS1 is a marsupial-specific PNMA geneIn this study, we have identified PNMA-MS1 as a novel Ty3/Gypsy LTR retrotransposon-derived gene. Comparative genomic analysis showed that PNMA-MS1 was present only in the marsupial lineage and was absent in the eutherian and monotreme mammals and in the non-mammalian vertebrates. PEG10/SIRH1 and SIRH12 are the only Ty3/Gypsy LTR retrotransposon-derived genes (derived from sushi-ichi-related retrotranposons) reported in marsupials so far.11,21 Therefore, the PNMA-MS1, which is also a Ty3/gypsy LTR retrotransposon-derived gene, is the first and only member of the PNMA gene family in the marsupials.The sushi-ichi-related retrotranposon that gave rise to the SIRH family was probably active around the time of the divergence between marsupials and eutherians, because PEG10/SIRH1 is conserved between the eutherians and marsupials,21 while SIRH3–11 seems to be eutherian-specific and SIRH12 evolved from a marsupial-specific retrotransposition event.11 We did not detect any orthologues of PNMA-MS1 or -MS2 in the eutherian genome, nor any orthologues of eutherian PNMA1–16 genes in the marsupial genomes (data not shown). Due to many sequence gaps in the tammar wallaby, Tasmanian devil and opossum genomes, we cannot exclude the possibility that some marsupial orthologues of eutherian PNMA genes exist in such gap regions. Thus, it is possible that some retrotransposition events of Gypsy12_DR-related retrotranposon occurred in the common ancestor of the marsupials and eutherians. However, the higher similarity of PNMA-MS1 and -MS2 to Gypsy12_DR Gag than any other eutherian PNMAs suggests that their insertions in the marsupial genome were recent events. Taken together, these results suggest that the retrotransposition of Gypsy12_DR-related retrotransposon occurred after the divergence of the marsupials and eutherians. The PNMA genes then evolved independently in these two lineages (Fig. 5).In our analysis, only PNMA-MS1 was detected in the tammar and opossum in contrast to 19 and 14 PNMA genes in humans and mice, respectively. We also observed the same trend in the SIRH genes: 11 genes in both humans and mice, while there are only 2 genes (PEG10 and SIRH12) in the tammar genome.11 This implies that the eutherian genome has a greater ability of exaptation as more Ty3/Gypsy types of LTR retrotransposons were incorporated into the genomes as endogenous genes than in the marsupial genomes.4.2. The possible role of PNMA-MS1 genes in marsupial developmentIn rare cases, some retrotransposons have been incorporated as novel acquired genes into the host genomes and have contributed to the innovation of some eutherian-specific characteristics. Two such advantageous genes, PEG10/SIRH1 and PEG11/SIRH2, play essential roles in the placental development in mice.7,8The role of PNMA-MS1 in marsupial development and growth is less clear. PNMA-MS1 expression was detected in the tammar brain, consistent with the expression of eutherian PNMA genes in brain. Interestingly, PNMA-MS1 expression was confirmed only in the thalamus, but not in the hypothalamus, and pituitary in the adult brain. The thalamus has multiple functions including relaying sensation, spatial sense and motor signals to the cerebral cortex,22 so it is possible that PNMA-MS1 is involved in the transmission of marsupial-specific sensations and signals. PNMA-MS1 expression in the Day 60–70 pouch young ovary and adult female ovary suggests the gene may have a role in ovarian function. These issues will be addressed in a future study.PNMA-MS1 protein has a conserved CCHC zinc finger domain. In retroviruses, this domain forms a part of the nucleocapsid protein that functions in virus genome packaging and the early infection process.23 Proteins containing the CCHC zinc finger domain are commonly known to interact with single-stranded DNAs (ssDNAs) and RNAs.24 The Drosophila Nanos protein is required for hunchback mRNA translational regulation in the early embryo to the establishment of the anterior–posterior body axis.25 The mammalian cellular nucleic acid-binding protein (CNBP) containing seven CCHC domains is involved in neural crest development, affecting forebrain and craniofacial development.26 CNBP has a single-stranded nucleic acid-binding ability and is also implicated in both transcriptional and translational regulations.27,28 Therefore, PNMA-MS1 may also be involved in a specific-transcriptional or translational regulation by binding ssDNAs or RNAs.5. ConclusionsWe have identified one novel Ty3/Gypsy LTR retrotransposon-derived gene, PNMA-MS1 in marsupials as the first marsupial-specific PNMA gene reported. The high PNMA-MS1 expression levels in the thalamus, ovary and mammary gland provide intriguing questions as to its functions in marsupial development and growth as well as its role in marsupial evolution. Our data suggest that, in most of the cases, Ty3/Gypsy LTR retrotransposons have been independently incorporated into the marsupial and eutherian lineages. Consequently, the marsupials and eutherians have completely different sets of PNMA and SIRH genes, with the exception of PEG10. Thus, it is highly likely that these genes have evolved lineage-specific functions in the reproduction and development and contributed in establishing marsupial- or eutherian-specific traits, leading to the diversification of these two viviparous mammalian groups.Supplementary DataSupplementary Data are available atwww.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.Accession NumbersThe National Center for Biotechnology Information GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank) sequence accession number for tammar PNMA-MS1 is AB646689.FundingThis work was supported by grants from the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence in Kangaroo Genomics to M.B.R., Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS), Bilateral Program on Joint Research Project to F.I. and T.K-I. and Funding Program for Next Generation World-Leading Researchers (NEXT Program) to T.K-I., the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT) of Japan, Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (S) and the Global Center for Excellence (GCOE) Program for International Research Center for Molecular Science in Tooth and Bone Diseases and Medical Research Institute, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Joint Usage/Research Program to F.I.We thank Scott Brownlees, Bonnie Dopheide, Hongshi Yu, Jessica Stringer, Stephen Frankenberg and the Wallaby research group for the assistance with the animals and tissue collections, and Soichi Ogishima for his advice on phylogenetic analysis.Supplementary data"

IntroductionMYB proteins are characterized by a conserved DNA-binding domain and constitute one of the largest families of transcription factors (TFs) in plants, which are classified into four major groups according to the number of adjacent repeats in the DNA-binding domain.1 All four groups are found in plants. The most common is the 2R-MYB group. The second group comprises a heterogeneous collection of R3- or 1R-MYB type proteins, hereafter referred to as MYB-related proteins, which usually contain a single MYB repeat. The third and fourth groups are composed of 3R-MYB and 4R-MYB type proteins, respectively. These latter groups consist of only 1–5 members.The first plant MYB-encoding gene, C1 (2R-MYB), was isolated from maize (Zea mays).2 Accordingly, research on MYB genes has mainly focused on the 2R-MYB gene family because of its large size.1 In the last two decades, a vast number of plant 2R-MYB genes have been shown to play important roles in many plant-specific processes. The first plant MYB-related gene (MybSt1) was isolated from potato.3 The numerous MYB-related genes subsequently identified play key roles as transcriptional regulators,3,4 circadian clock-associated repressors,5,6 and telomeric repeat-binding proteins7,8 in diverse biological processes. To date, genome-wide analyses of 2R-MYB proteins have been conducted in numerous plant species based on sequenced genomes1,9–11 However, comprehensive analyses of MYB-related proteins in major land plants are still lacking. Accordingly, the evolutionary relationships between plant MYB-related proteins remain unknown, necessitating a detailed survey and classification of disparate evolutionary groups.To understand the evolutionary history of plant MYB-related genes, we identified MYB-related proteins at the genome-wide level and performed structural and evolutionary analyses across distantly related plant evolutionary lineages, including eudicots, monocots, a gymnosperm, a bryophyte, five chlorophyte species, and a rhodophyte. Subsequently, we assessed the origins, patterns of differentiation, and expansion of different phylogenetic subgroups of this gene family. In addition, we analysed the expressions of MYB-related genes in different tissues and developmental stages and under stress treatments.2. Materials and methods2.1. Sequence retrievalWe performed a BLASTP search among sequenced genomes of land plants in Phytozome (http://www.Phytozome.net) using well-known plant MYB-related proteins as queries. The species represented a broad range of the plant lineages from unicellular green algae to multicellular plants (http://www.jgi.doe.gov/). To verify the reliability of our results, all putative non-redundant sequences were assessed with PROSITE profiling12 and SMART analysis,13 respectively.2.2. Multiple sequence alignmentsMultiple alignments of MYB domains in candidate genes were performed using the MAFFT version 7 software under default parameters.14 Nucleotide substitution levels were calculated using the HyPhy version 2.0.15 The HyPhy batch Quick Selection Detion.bf was used to estimate site-by-site variation in rates.2.3. Phylogenetic analysisA neighbour-joining (NJ) tree was constructed using the MEGA version 5 software,16 based on the alignment of MYB domains. To determine the statistical reliability, we conducted bootstrap analysis with the following parameters: p-distance and pairwise deletion. Bootstrap analysis was performed with 1000 replicates.2.4. Detection of conserved motifsConserved motifs of MYB-related proteins were identified statistically with the MEME program.17 The following parameter settings were used: maximum number of motifs, 100; minimum width of motif, 6; and maximum width of motif, 300. All putative motifs with expected values of <1E-30 were discarded. In addition, we used the PFAM tool to identify whether any remaining motifs matched well-known motifs.182.5. Gene expression analysisMaize and soybean public expression datasets were obtained from the Plant Expression Database (PLEXdb).19 Additionally, maize and soybean microarray-based datasets, with accession numbers GSE16567, GSE40052, GSE19501, GSE10023, GSE31188, GSE31763, GSE15100, GSE35427, and GSE18827, were downloaded from the PLEXdb. A hierarchical cluster was created using the Cluster 3.0.203. Results and discussion3.1. Identification of MYB-related proteins in plantsTo identify MYB-related proteins in land plants, we implemented BLASTP searches of the complete genomes of the red alga (Cyanidioschyzon merolae); the chlorophytes (Volvox carteri, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Ostreococcus tauri, Ostreococcus lucimarinus, and Chlorella vulgaris); the moss (Physcomitrella patens); the lycophyte (Selaginella moellendorffii); the eudicots (Arabidopsis thaliana, Citrus sinensis, Populus trichocarpa, Glycine max, Vitis vinifera L., and Solanum lycopersicum), and the monocots (maize and Brachypodium distachyon). Each matching sequence was then used to search the respective genome databases until no new sequences were found.Further analyses focused only on proteins with full-open reading frames. We referred to the sequences of MYB-related proteins in the Plant Transcription Factor Database (PlantTFDB)21 and PlnTFDB,22 and recon<U+FB01>rmed the sequences by comparative analysis. Given the substantial sequence divergence of MYB-related genes, their identification should be careful manual checking. GARP-like TFs are often confused with MYB-related TFs,23 because they contain a consensus sequence (SHLQKY) very similar to that of CCA1-like proteins (SHAQK(Y/F)F).4 However, they contain only 1 of the 3 regularly spaced Trp (W) residues found in the MYB domain.23,24 Thus, we excluded GARP-like TFs in this study.After removing incomplete or redundant sequences, and predicted alternative splice variants, we identified 623 MYB-related genes (Supplementary Table S1). We also identified a large number of putative MYB-related proteins in angiosperms, but only a small number in land plants that diverged earlier (Fig. 1). This suggests that a huge expansion occurred after the evolution of angiosperm plants. In this study, we excluded false positives of MYB-related proteins according to the Yanhui's criterion.25 Interestingly, we retrieved four genes not previously annotated as MYB-related genes in Arabidopsis. In addition, we retrieved a small number of genes in unicellular green algae and red alga (Fig. 1), which suggests that MYB-related proteins arose before plants transitioned from water to land.

Phylogenetic analysis of MYB-related proteinsTo investigate the evolution of plant MYB-related proteins, we constructed an NJ tree (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. S1) based on the alignment of the MYB domains. Based on the topology and clade support values, the 623 MYB-related proteins were classified into five major subgroups with robust bootstrap support (generally =60%), CCA1-like/R-R, I-box-like, CPC-like, TRF-like, and TBP-like (Fig. 2).

The numbers beside the branches represent bootstrap support values from 1000 replications. The coloured lines indicate the intron pattern as shown in Fig. 3. The coloured dots symbolize the species to which the proteins in each clade belong. The major clades of each subgroup are numbered consecutively.The CCA1-like/R-R and TBP-like subgroups were the largest of the five subgroups. All subgroups were present in monocots and eudicots (Fig. 2), indicating that the appearance of most MYB-related genes in plants predates the divergence of monocot/eudicots. Meanwhile, in contrast to 2R-MYB genes,10,11 no species-specific subgroups and/or clades were observed, implying that MYB-related genes were more conserved during evolution. In addition, MYB-related genes from the same lineage tended to cluster together in the phylogenetic tree and were not equally represented within a given clade, suggesting that they experienced duplications after the lineages diverged. Additional features used for validation, discussed below, strongly supported the reliability of the clustering results.The CCA1-like/R-R subgroup comprised of four major clades (Clades I–IV) with different intron patterns (a–d; Figs 2 and 3). The common characteristic of this subgroup is a highly conserved motif, SHAQK(Y/F)F,4 in the third helix of the MYB domain. Whereas most of the plant MYB-related proteins contain a single MYB domain, R-R proteins, similar to 2R-MYB proteins, have two MYB domains. However, unlike in 2R-MYB proteins, the two MYB repeats in R-R proteins are separated, in the N-terminal and middle regions, respectively. The second repeats are more closely related to the MYB domains of CCA1-like proteins, and they clustered as the second clade of the CCA1-like/R-R subgroup. The TBP-like subgroup contained five distinct clades (Fig. 2, Clades I–V) with conserved characteristics. Although the bootstrap value of the TBP-like subgroup node was low, the reliability of the clustering was supported by the presence of the consensus motif LKDKW(R/K)(N/T),26 the intron patterns, and the architectures of the non-MYB motifs (Fig. 2). The TRF-like subgroup comprised of a limited genes from all land plants investigated, except for Selaginella. This suggests that the TRF-like subgroup was also conserved during evolution. The CPC-like subgroup consisted of two distinct clades (Fig. 2, I and II); one contained angiosperm genes, and the other contained algae genes. Interestingly, members of the plant-only clade were characterized by very short sequences without transcription–activation domains. The lack of moss and lycophyte proteins in this clade suggests that either these genes were lost in early diverged land plants during expansion or were evolved after gymnosperms diverged. The high bootstrap values for the node supported that the two clades likely clustered in a subgroup. Sequence logos of the MYB domains of plant MYB-related proteins.

Conserved characteristics in the MYB domainAlignment analysis revealed the MYB domains of the five subgroups are remarkable divergence, but are highly similar within each subgroup or clade (Fig. 3). Similar to 2R-, 3R-, and 4R-MYB proteins,10 MYB-related proteins also contained the three evenly distributed Trp (W) residues characteristic of MYB repeats. However, 13% and 65% of the plant MYB-related genes had a substitution at either the first or the third Trp (W) residue in the MYB domain, respectively. Most members of the TRF-like and TBP-like subgroups contained the three W residues. In contrast, the third W residue was often substituted by Ala (A) and Tyr (Y) in CCA1-like/R-R and I-box-like subgroups, respectively (Fig. 3). While the first W residue was substituted by Phe (F) in all members of the fourth clade of the TBP-like subgroup and in most members of the CPC-like subgroup.Interestingly, despite the divergence of the individual MYB domains, the consensus sequences SHAQK(Y/F)F and LKDKW(R/K)(N/T) were highly conserved in the MYB domains of the CCA1-like/R-R and TBP-like subgroups, respectively (Figs 2 and 3), thus providing unique criteria for identifying these types of MYB proteins. The existence of highly conserved, subgroup-specific sites in the MYB domains also indicates a common origin, despite variability among the different subgroups.The third helix in the MYB domain plays a major role in recognizing cis-elements in target genes, whereas the conserved W residues are important for forming the hydrophobic core and maintaining the three-dimensional structure of the MYB repeat. This suggests that the molecular structures and biological functions of each subgroup and/or clade were highly conserved during evolution.3.4. Conservation of intron/exon structure within MYB domainsTo determine the intron patterns of MYB-related genes, we analysed the intron distribution in regions encoding MYB domains. Most of the plant MYB-related genes (~87%) were disrupted by intron(s), with up to two introns. In contrast, ~13% of MYB-related genes did not contain introns (Fig. 3, I-box-like subgroup).Our results revealed that the intron patterns (Fig. 3a–k), formed by relative position and phase, were highly conserved in all subgroups and/or clades of plant MYB-related genes. The highly conserved intron patterns within subgroups or clades provided an independent criterion for testing the reliability of our phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 2). The intron patterns in algae were not conserved and generally quite different from those in land plants. However, an algae CCA1-like gene, VcMYBR05, showed the same intron pattern (Fig. 3c) as that in the third clade of the CCA1-like/R-R subgroup, strongly supporting their common origin.In addition, the intron phases were highly conserved in plant MYB-related genes within each subgroup. For instance, pattern (a) always was in Phase 1, while pattern (d) was consistently in Phases 2 and 0 (Fig. 3), resulting in a significant excess of non-symmetrical exons. This suggests that splicing phases were also highly conserved during the evolution. Overall, our results indicate a strong correlation between the phylogeny and exon/intron structure of the MYB-related gene family.3.5. Molecular evolution of plant MYB-related genesTo analyse the selective pressures acting during the expansion of plant MYB-related genes, we investigated the influences of selective constraints on the MYB domains. By globally fitting an evolutionary model, we first calculated the dN/dS ratios for each subgroup. The dN/dS values were substantially <1 in all subgroups, providing a crude indication that the strong purifying selection has been maintained across land plants (Supplementary Table S2). At the individual codon level, most of the residues were under significant negative selection (P < 0.05).Because the CCA1-like/R-R and TBP-like subgroups subdivided into several clades (Fig. 2), the preceding method merely estimated the dN/dS ratio across each subgroup, without considering variations among clades in the large subgroups. Therefore, we estimated the dN/dS ratios for the clades of the CCA1-like/R-R and TBP-like subgroups (Supplementary Table S2).In general, the dN/dS values of individual clades were lower than that of the subgroups. However, the dN/dS values of some individual clades were higher than that of the subgroups, and the number of residues under significant negative selection was reduced (P < 0.05). However, no clades showed dN/dS values >1, suggesting that different clades were subjected to different strengths of purifying selection. For example, in TBP-like subgroup clades, the dN/dS values ranged from 0.06 to 0.32, while in CCA1-like/R-R subgroup clades, the dN/dS values were <0.11. Thus, our dN/dS analysis suggests that selective constraints have remained stable throughout the evolution of MYB-related genes in land plants.3.6. Distribution of MYB domains and non-MYB motifs in plantsThe MYB domains were found throughout the entire coding region of MYB-related proteins, even within different clades of a subgroup (Fig. 4). For example, within the TBP-like subgroup, the MYB domain is at the N-terminal region in the second clade and at the C-terminal region in the third clade. Similarly, the MYB domains of the CCA1-like/R-R subgroup are located either at the N-terminal or at the middle region. Thus, the location of MYB domains is less conserved in MYB-related proteins than in 2R-MYB proteins.11 These results illustrate the variability in the relative locations of the MYB domain and the high divergence of MYB-related proteins.

An idealized representation of a typical member of each clade is shown, with the MYB domain and conserved motifs drawn as numbered boxes. The diagrams are not drawn to scale.Because sequences outside of the MYB domains are quite divergent, non-conserved subgroup-speci<U+FB01>c motifs were detected. However, we identified 34 clade-specific motifs in the CCA1-like/R-R, TRF-like, and TBP-like subgroups (Supplementary Table S3). No motifs were detected in the CPC-like or I-box-like subgroup, because they lack the C-terminal (Fig. 4). Motifs 10, 11, 13, 14, and 16 in the CCA1-like/R-R subgroup and motifs 19, 21, 29, 30, 31, and 33 in the TBP-like subgroup were found only in angiosperms, suggesting that they are angiosperm-specific motifs that originated after the evolution of angiosperms. Motifs 1, 9, and 34 were adjacent to MYB domains, indicating that they co-evolved with the corresponding MYB domain (Fig. 4). In addition, motifs 1, 9, and 23 were present in most of the chlorophyta and/or red algae MYB-related proteins, suggesting that they are ancient. Overall, the protein architectures of closely related members in a specific clade were remarkably conserved, indicating a common origin and/or close relationship.We also queried the PFAM database of protein domains using the candidate non-MYB motifs. With the exception of motif 22, none of the 34 conserved motifs corresponded to known domains. Motif 22, shared by members of the second clade of the TBP-like subgroup, showed significant homology with linker histones H1 and H5, which bind the nucleosome as a major component of chromatin and play a role in chromatin dynamics.27 In addition, in the same clade, we identified a region near the C-terminus that may form a coiled-coil domain (motif 23). Such domains, found in many TFs, are predicted to stabilize protein dimer formation.28 The presence of motifs 22 and 23 verified our phylogenetic classification and suggested a specific role for this type of MYB-related protein. Motifs 5–7 formed the first MYB repeat of R-R proteins, demonstrating that the first repeat is less homologous to the typical MYB domain than the second repeat.The conservation of these additional motifs demonstrates that the diversity of domain architecture has been maintained beyond the core components of the MYB domain, while the presence of clade-speci<U+FB01>c motifs indicates their recent common origin. Therefore, they may be essential for the function of MYB-related proteins.3.7. Expression analysis of MYB-related genes at different developmental stagesTo understand the temporal and spatial expression patterns of MYB-related genes, we compared their expression patterns during maize and soybean development.Microarray data of 60 different tissues/developmental conditions of maize29 were used (Fig. 5). Few genes were constitutively expressed in all organs and developmental stages. CCA-like/R-R genes were expressed in most organs examined, with the exception of seeds. However, six genes in a CCA1-like/R-R subgroup clade (ZmMYBR02, ZmMYBR11, ZmMYBR34, ZmMYBR42, ZmMYBR65, and ZmMYBR67) showed higher expression in seeds than in other organs, which indicated that they may play important roles in seed development (Fig. 5). Similar to CCA1-like/R-R proteins, the I-box-like genes were also expressed abundantly in many maize organs. This may indicate that these two subgroups predominantly contribute to maize development. The expression of I-box-like genes and most of the CCA1-like/R-R genes significantly decreased during seed development, further implying roles as negative regulators in seed development. A CPC-like gene, ZmMYBR20, was highly expressed in leaf tissues, which suggested that it may function in leaf development, or it may be restricted by 2R-MYB genes in other developmental stages (see below).

The genes and their corresponding intron patterns are on the right. The tissues used for expression analysis are indicated at the top of each column. The colour bar represents log2 expression values.The TRF-like subgroup included only two maize genes, which showed relatively high expression in seeds. Although no TRF-like genes have yet been functionally characterized in plants, their preferential expression in maize seed tissues implies their possible roles in seed development. The TBP-like subgroup, consisting of five clades, contained 14 maize genes. Although members of this subgroup displayed relatively low expression in all examined organs, TBP-like genes have wider expression in maize (Fig. 5). Furthermore, closely related genes generally showed highly similar expression patterns, indicating that they may share similar or overlapping functions.We next analysed the expression profiles of soybean MYB-related genes.30 The majority of the 127 soybean MYB-related genes showed wide expressions in the examined tissues. However, 22 soybean genes were not expressed in this dataset, suggesting that they might be pseudogenes. In most of the cases, the expression patterns of MYB-related genes in maize and soybean were very similar (Supplementary Fig. S2). The expression patterns of soybean genes divided into two main groups. Most of the CCA1-like/R-R genes showed prominent responses in the early stage of soybean development, while some TBP-like genes were expressed at higher levels in leaves and seeds. There were also minor differences in the expression patterns of I-box-like and CPC-like genes between maize and soybean. Some soybean I-box-like and CPC-like genes showed higher expression in more tissues, suggesting that these genes may play wider roles in soybean. The high similarity of MYB-related gene expression in maize and soybean indicates functional conservation of this gene family in plants.3.8. Expression analysis of MYB-related genes under biotic and abiotic stressesWe further examined the roles of maize MYB-related genes in drought stress, based on the microarray data19 (Fig. 6A). Twenty-six probe sets on the maize 18k GeneChip corresponded to 32 MYB-related genes (five probes represented more than one gene). The high sequence similarity necessitated further experimental confirmation. Most of the maize MYB-related genes were expressed at low levels, but were preferentially expressed under specific stress conditions. The expressions were very similar in tolerant (Han21) and sensitive (Ye478) lines. Among the genes, four CCA1-like/R-R genes (ZmMYBR19, ZmMYBR28, ZmMYBR49, and ZmMYBR56), one TRF-like gene (ZmMYBR41), and six TBP-like genes (ZmMYBR07, ZmMYBR26, ZmMYBR31, ZmMYBR45, ZmMYBR47, and ZmMYBR55) increased in response to drought stress. In contrast, the expression of five CCA1-like/R-R genes (ZmMYBR03, ZmMYBR18, ZmMYBR27, ZmMYBR44, and ZmMYBR63) and one I-box-like gene (ZmMYBR37) was significantly down-regulated by drought stress and recovered after re-watering. Thus, MYB-related genes likely contribute to the drought response. Expression profiles of maize MYB-related genes in response to drought stress or fungal infection.

(A) The expression profiles of maize MYB-related genes under drought stress. (B) The expression of maize MYB-related genes after fungal infection.To explore the roles of maize MYB-related genes in the response to pathogens, we investigated their expressions after the treatment with Sphacelotheca reiliana, Fusarium moniliforme, Ustilago maydis, or Colletotrichum graminicola.19 As shown in Fig. 6B, the majority of maize genes analysed were differentially expressed over time after inoculation with these four pathogens. In general, the genes showed similar expression patterns in response to each of the pathogens. For example, ZmMYBR05, ZmMYBR45, and ZmMYBR56 were up-regulated after infection with the four pathogens. However, some MYB-related genes also showed different expression patterns in different lines in response to the same pathogen. Furthermore, the expression of maize MYB-related genes varied more with time after U. maydis infection. Taken together, our results showed that MYB-related genes might participate in the maize pathogen response.We used the Illumina transcriptome sequencing data31 to assess the expressions of soybean MYB-related genes under pathogen stress (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Most of the soybean MYB-related genes were induced after infection with Bradyrhizobium japonicum. Moreover, the expression patterns differed significantly between root hair and stripped root samples: many genes exhibited much higher expression in root hairs than in stripped roots. In most of the cases, the soybean genes were differentially up-regulated upon B. japonicum infection. However, some genes were reduced. To extend the expression analysis of soybean MYB-related gene, we used the Affymetrix array data housed within the PLEXdb.20 Thirty-two probes corresponded to individual soybean genes, of which 22 matched 2 genes and 1 matched 3 genes. Most of the soybean genes were strongly induced in hypocotyls infected with Phytophthora sojae (Supplementary Fig. S3B), which suggests these genes also contribute to the pathogen response. In addition, a few soybean genes, such as GmMYBR028 and GmMYBR126, were up-regulated after infection with aphids, indicating a possible function.3.9. Evolution and divergence of MYB-related proteinsOur phylogenetic analysis allowed us to assess the origin and evolutionary relationships among different subgroups. In the CCA1-like/R-R subgroup, the inclusion of all five chlorophyte algae and the red alga implies that this subgroup predates the divergence of red algae from the ancestor of land plants 1.5 billion yrs ago.32 This subgroup contained four major clades (Fig. 2). The first two clades were characterized by the location of the MYB domain and the presence of motif 1 adjacent to the C-terminus of the MYB domain; these two clades were further distinguishable by a number of clade-specific motifs (Fig. 4). Similar results were also observed for the other two clades. Interestingly, all four clades included chlorophyte algae proteins, suggesting that they differentiated from a common ancestor before the origin of land plants. Clades III and IV appeared to be relatively older since they clustered with several red algae proteins (Fig. 2).In contrast, the I-box-like subgroup seems to have evolved recently in angiosperms. No obvious orthologues were detected in algae, moss, or Selaginella. Although the MYB domains of different subgroups were generally quite divergent, those of I-box-like proteins were highly homologous (~40% identity) to the first MYB repeats of R-R proteins. One significant difference was an amino acid deletion in I-box-like proteins (Supplementary Fig. S4). Consistent with a previous study,25 when both MYB repeats of R-R proteins were used in the phylogenetic analysis, the second repeats clustered within the CCA1-like/R-R subgroup, while the first repeats clustered within the I-box-like subgroup with high bootstrap values (Supplementary Fig. S5). These results imply that I-box-like proteins evolved from R-R proteins through the gene disruption among the angiosperms ~415 million yrs ago.33 During this process, I-box-like proteins likely evolved from the first repeats in R-R proteins, while the second repeats formed the first clade of the CCA1-like/R-R subgroup. This view is supported by the conserved intron patterns of I-box-like genes and the first MYB repeats of R-R genes (both of which are intronless).The TBP-like subgroup is composed of MYB-related proteins from chlorophyte algae and land plants, suggesting that it is >1 billion yrs old.34 Among its five major clades, the second, third, and fourth clades are likely the oldest, because they contain algae proteins. While the second and fourth clades of this subgroup share the same intron pattern (i), the positions of their MYB domains differ (Fig. 4). Since both of these clades include algae proteins, domain shifting could have occurred earlier in plants. Similar results were also found in the CCA1-like/R-R subgroup (Fig. 4).The CPC-like subgroup includes two major clades. Clade II composed of V. carteri and C. reinhardtii proteins and is sister to Clade I of angiosperm proteins (Fig. 2). Recently, we found that some soybean 2R-MYB genes are alternatively spliced, resulting in a change from 2R-MYB to R3-MYB.11 Alignment analysis showed that the MYB domains of angiosperm CPC-like proteins had significant homology to the R3 repeats of 2R-MYB proteins. Both sequences contain a conserved motif, [DE]Lx2[RK]x3Lx6Lx3R (Fig. 3), which specifies the interaction with bHLH proteins.35,36 Phylogenetic tree analysis showed that such R3-MYB proteins clustered within the CPC-like subgroup (data not shown). However, we did not find this motif in algae CPC-like proteins or 2R-MYB proteins. Further phylogenetic analysis revealed that the algae CPC-like proteins and R3 repeats of 2R-MYB proteins also clustered within a clade (data not shown). This result suggests that the algae CPC-like proteins originated from 2R-MYB proteins after the divergence from a common ancestor of land plants. The absence of the [DE]Lx2[RK]x3Lx6Lx3R motif in algae CPC-like and 2R-MYB proteins, as well as in lower land plants, implies that the interaction between MYB and bHLH proteins may be angiosperm specific. The TRF-like subgroup included proteins from angiosperms and moss, but not from lycophytes, suggesting a loss of these genes from lycophytes. Though the subgroup is very small, it is >443 million yrs old.37Our results also showed a gradual increase in the number of MYB-related genes from moss to flowering plants (Fig. 1). This finding suggests the evolutionary diversification of MYB-related proteins through extensive expansion during plant evolution. This expansion appears to have occurred in three important stages. The first stage likely predated the origin of red algae and led to the establishment of CCA1-like/R-R and TBP-like proteins, containing the motifs (SHAQK(Y/F) F and LKDKW(R/K)(N/T), respectively. The second stage may have occurred at the early origin of land plants to establish the diversity of MYB domains, intron patterns, and non-MYB motifs. The third stage may have occurred after the split between gymnosperms and angiosperms, as reflected in the greater size in angiosperms within each subgroup (Fig. 2). Despite several rounds of gene duplications and loss in different plant lineages, these subgroups have remained highly conserved throughout the plant evolution. Chromosomal distribution analysis revealed that MYB-related genes were distributed throughout all corresponding chromosomes in each species (data not shown). Compared with 2R-MYB proteins,10,11 we detected fewer tandem duplication events in the MYB-related gene family, which suggests that its major expansion is genome-wide duplication.Furthermore, CCA1-like and TBP-like genes are also present in other eukaryotes, including fungi and metazoans (data not shown). Taken together, our results indicate that CCA1-like and TBP-like genes are much older than previously thought.3.10. Functional diversity of MYB-related genesPutative orthologues in each subgroup and/or clade indicate conserved physiological functions. Therefore, we performed a comparative phylogenetic analysis of Arabidopsis and other well-known plant MYB-related proteins (Supplementary Fig. S6). Supplementary Table S4 summarizes the functions of plant MYB-related genes.CCA-1like/R-R genes are best known for their involvement in circadian rhythm regulation, and are highly conserved in plants (Supplementary Table S4), which implies that the functional divergence of clock machinery occurred before the divergence of land plants. Consistently, in the analysis of PLEXdb microarray data,19 we identified AtCCA1 gene homologues in maize and soybean that are involved in circadian rhythmicity (Supplementary Fig. S7A). In our study, CCA1-like genes involved in circadian rhythmicity divided into two clades with different intron patterns (c and d). This may explain why they have similar functions but through different mechanisms. Moreover, we observed relatively high expression of MYB-related genes in the flower tissues of maize and soybean, consistent with a role in regulating floral development.38 Taken together, these results indicate the functional diversity and conservation of CCA1-like/R-R proteins and their crucial roles in plant development.The cooperative interaction between MYB and bHLH TFs is a classical example of combinatorial regulation. Two types of MYB TFs, 2R-MYB (WER) and CPC-like (or R3-MYB), have similar functions in cell-fate determination.39,40 Both of which contain the conserved motif DLx2Rx3Lx6Lx3R in their MYB domains, which is involved in MYB–bHLH interactions35 (Fig. 3). CPC-like proteins can interact with bHLH proteins, thereby competing with the 2R-MYB protein in the regulation of plant development.41 In the present study, one soybean CPC-like gene, GmMYBR79, was expressed in the soybean root hair (Supplementary Fig. S3A), implying a similar role in soybean hair development. Recently, CPC-like genes were shown to down-regulate anthocyanin synthesis by a similar mechanism.42 In our expression analysis, one maize (ZmMYBR20) and two soybean (GmMYBR78 and GmMYBR80) CPC-like genes showed high expression in flower tissues (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S2), suggesting that they may regulate anthocyanin synthesis via similar mechanisms. These results demonstrate the close relationship between CPC-like proteins and 2R-MYB proteins and the functional conservation of this motif during the evolution.Members of the I-box-like subgroup are also key developmental regulators in various plant tissues (Supplementary Table S4). Consistently, our results showed that I-box-like genes have broad expression profiles in maize and soybean (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S2). To date, the most well-known role of I-box-like genes is the regulation of floral asymmetry.43,44 Interestingly, the I-box-like genes not only showed high homology and similar expression patterns with R-R-like genes, but also appeared to have similar functions in flower development. This further demonstrates that I-box-like genes evolved from R-R-like genes and maintained functions similar to those of R-R-like proteins. A relatively small number of TBP-like genes have been functionally characterized (Supplementary Table S4). Most of the known TBP-like genes encode telomere-binding proteins.8 The strong divergence of this subgroup implies that its members might have additional diverse functions.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis project was supported by the State Key Basic Research and Development Plan of China (2011Cb100106), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31071354), and the National Transgenic Program (2011ZX08003001).Supplementary data"

IntroductionStress response is important to living organisms and a major aspect of natural selection in the wild.1 Fishes are exposed to a variety of stressors because their homeostatic mechanisms are highly dependent on prevailing conditions primarily related to the aquatic environment.2 Previous studies showed that the interactions between stressors and stress responses are complex.2 Genetic, developmental and environmental factors, and early experiences have influences on the stress responses of fish.3,4 Identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and pathways under stress conditions is important for the understanding of fish stress response. A lot of platforms to reveal DEGs are available, such as real-time (RT)-PCR and microarray. Recently, RNA-Seq5 is considered to be a revolutionary tool for transcriptomics, as it can absolutely quantify over millions of unknown transcripts. It has also shown a great analytical power in the identification of differentially expressed transcripts in response to different conditions.6–9 For species with poor genome annotation, the Roche/454-based RNA-seq technique with much longer read lengths provides an excellent tool for expression profiling studies.10,11The intestine is one of the major organs in fish that interact with the environment and is involved in many biological processes. A few studies on the responses of the intestine to various stressors have been performed in fishes, such as medaka12 and channel catfish.13 However, data on responses of the fish intestine to different stresses are still limited. Studies of the genome-wide transcriptome after challenging with different stressors in fish will enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying stresses.The Asian seabass (Lates calcarifer) is an important food fish species in Southeast Asia and Australia.14 Although some expressed sequence tags (ESTs) of the Asian seabass are available in public domains,15–17 the transcriptome for the Asian seabass is still poorly characterized. To date, an intestine transcriptome data set for the Asian seabass and most food fish species is lacking. To gain more understanding of the mechanisms underlying stress responses and to supply significant transcriptome resources for studying biological questions in non-model fish species, we conducted RNA-seq of intestine samples from fishes challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), Vibrio harveyi infection, fasting and high salinity. We also carried out bioinformatic analyses of the transcriptome to identify DEGs and pathways in response to these different stressors.2. Materials and methods2.1. Fish management, challenges and sampling for RNA-seq analysisThirty-six Asian seabass at the age of 11 months (body weight ~330 g) were originally maintained in a large tank containing 2000 l of freshwater in the animal outhouse of our institute. For challenge experiments, 12 fishes were transferred to a 1000-l tank, and the salinity concentration was gradually increased to full-seawater (33 PPT salinity) within 3 days. Fishes were fed twice daily with pelleted feed (Biomar, Nersac, France). One day prior to challenges, nine seabass from the seawater tank, after acclimatization for 2 weeks, were evenly divided into three tanks containing 300 l of seawater (i.e. 3 fishes per tank). For the three fishes in tank 1, named as Int1 (LPS), each fish was injected intra-peritoneally with 0.3 ml of 5 mg/ml of Escherichia coli LPS (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, USA) by dilution with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at room temperature. In tank 2, Int2 (Vibrio), a total of three fishes were injected intra-peritoneally with 0.3 ml of PBS dissolved culture pellet of Vibrio harveyi (~e8 cell/ml) at room temperature. In tank 3, Int3 (PBS), used as control 1, three fishes received an intra-peritoneal injection of 0.3 ml of PBS for each fish. These fishes were not given access to feeds before sampling. Three fishes taken from the original freshwater tank were moved to tank 4, Int4 (FW;Feed), as control 2, containing 1000 l of freshwater. These fishes were fed twice daily with pelleted feed (Biomar, Nersac, France). Another three fishes from the original freshwater tank were moved to the freshwater tank 5, Int5 (FW;Fasting), and were not given access to feed before sampling. Three fishes in the seawater tank 6, Int6 (SW;Feed), were fed twice daily with pelleted feed before sampling. Three fishes from each of the tanks 1, 2 and 3 were sacrificed at ~40 h post-challenges. Three fishes from each of the tanks 4, 5 and 6 were sacrificed at 8 days post-treatments. Intestine samples were taken from each fish of each tank and kept in Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA) for RNA isolation.2.2. Challenges and sampling for quantitative RT-PCR analysisEighteen seabass at the age of 11 months (body weight ~330 g) originally maintained in a large tank containing 2000 l of freshwater were evenly divided into two tanks containing 1000 l of freshwater (Groups 1 and 2). Nine of the fishes in Group 1 were not given access to feed before sampling, and nine of the remaining fishes in Group 2 were fed twice daily with pelleted feed (Biomar, Nersac, France). Three fishes from each group were sacrificed at 8 days post-fasting. Intestine samples were taken for each fish and kept in Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA) for RNA isolation.For analysis of the functions of the splice variants of IFABP-a and -b genes, two extreme groups (i.e. smallest and biggest; n = 6/group) for body weight were selected from a population of ~300 seabass at the age of 2 months. These fishes were originally maintained in a tank containing 2000 l of freshwater and were fed twice daily with pelleted feed (Biomar, Nersac, France). Intestine samples were taken for each fish and kept in Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA) for RNA isolation.2.3. RNA-seq sequencingTotal RNA from the intestine was isolated using the Trizol kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA). Total RNA from three fishes at each time point was equally mixed and submitted to Macrogen (Seoul, Korea) for RNA sequencing by using Roche/454 GS FLX Titanium platform. The total RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Ribosomal RNA was then removed prior to proceeding. cDNA rapid libraries were prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol (Roche, Central plaza, Singapore).2.4. De novo assembly of the intestine transcriptome for the Asian seabassGS FLX data were processed using the Roche GS FLX software (v 2.6). De novo assembly of transcriptome was carried out using the GS De Novo Assembler (v 2.6) with default assembly parameters. Singleton cleaning was performed with software SeqClean (http://sourceforge.net/projects/seqclean/) and Lucy (http://lucy.sourceforge.net/) with a minimum length of 100 bp.2.5. Bioinformatics analysisTo assess the quality of the transcriptome assembly, 20 EST data sets were downloaded from NCBI databases and reciprocally compared with intestine transcriptome of Asian seabass using Blastn algorithm with an E-value threshold of E-5. These data sets included the EST data set (22 335 ESTs) of Asian seabass from NCBI, 15 intestine EST data (62 848 ESTs) and 4 unigene databases for the model fishes, Gasterosteus aculeatus, Takifugu rubripes, Danio rerio and Oryzias latipes (95 846 ESTs) (Supplementary Table S1). Batch blast of the unique sequences was carried out by using local Blast software (ver.2.2.25+) available from ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/blast+/LATEST/.Singletons and isotigs from the de novo assembly were referred to as unique sequences to annotate them. They were blasted against GO database (http://www.geneontology.org/), Swissprot, Ref_protein and Refseq_RNA databases that retrieved from NCBI database using Blastn or Blastx algorithm with an E-value threshold of E-5.Ortholog assignment and mapping of the unisequences to biological pathways were performed using the KEGG automatic annotation server (KAAS; http://www.genome.jp/tools/kaas/)18 with a threshold bit-score value of 40.OrfPredictor19 was used to predict protein-coding regions in EST-derived unisequences. The predicted protein sequences were then input into SignalP 4.0 server20 to predict potential signal peptide cleavage sites. Alignment of the predicted protein sequence for each splice variant was conducted using the online tool ClustalW2 (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalw2/).Identification of DEGs from the count data was performed using the NOISeq-sim program21 with parameters setting as v = 0.1, k = 1.5, and other as defaults. Normalization was conducted using the RPKM method.22 The identified DEGs were then blasted against the KAAS database to identify the regulated pathways involved. Comparison of the DEGs and pathways among the four challenges was carried out with Venn diagrams.23 The RPKM-normalized transcript counts for the top 60 most DEGs in each pairwise comparison were then converted to natural logs and analysed by Cluster 3.0 with parameters as hierarchical clustering, uncentered correlation, and complete linkage (http://bonsai.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~mdehoon/software/cluster/software.htm#ctv) to construct a heat map. Scatter plots between pairwise data sets were drawn with geWorkbench platform (https://cabig.nci.nih.gov/community/tools/geWorkbench).For quantitative RT-PCR (q-PCR) analysis to confirm gene expression revealed by RNA-seq, total RNA from the same group (experimental group: three fishes sampled at 8 days post-fasting challenge and the control group) were equally mixed. Around 1 µg of DNase I-treated total RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA by M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, USA) with random hexamer primer as RT primer following the manufacturer's protocol. The resulting single-strand cDNA was assayed as DNA template by qPCR using primers for 56 genes from the RNA-seq data and the EF1A gene as the control (Supplementary Table S2). PCR in triplicates was performed with the KAPA™ SYBR® FAST qPCR Kits (Kapa Biosystems, Boston, USA) as described by the manufacturer, and an iQ5 PCR-machine (Bio-Rad, CA, USA). The <U+0394><U+0394>CT method was used for the analysis of the gene expression, and the values of triplicate RT-PCR reactions were normalized to EF1A gene expression.The qRT-PCR analysis of expressions of the splice variants of two IFABP genes in the intestines of the Asian seabass were performed as described above with slight modifications. Briefly, to design primers for PCR, the exon/intron boundaries and divergence regions from the splice variants of IFABP genes were identified by using Sequencher 4.9 (GeneCodes, CA, USA). One primer pair that spans exon/intron boundary on the mRNA for each splice variant was designed using PrimerSelect (DNASTAR, DE, USA). This primer design allows differentiating the splice variants and does not amplify their genomic DNA. In addition, around 1 µg of DNase I-treated total RNA from each fish was reverse transcribed to cDNA. The resulting single-strand cDNA was assayed as DNA template by qPCR using primers for the six splice variants. The EF1A gene was used as a control (Supplementary Table S2).2.6. Statistical analysisThe correlation coefficients between pairwise data sets were calculated by using the SAS (SAS Institute, Cary, USA). A P-value for significant difference was calculated using the t-test module installed in the Microsoft Office Excel 2008 program with parameters setting as two-tailed distribution and two-sample equal variance.3. Results and discussion3.1. De novo assembly and annotation of an intestine transcriptome for the Asian seabassA total of 1 004 081 raw sequencing reads with an average length of 516 bp were generated by sequencing 6 cDNA libraries. The high-quality reads generated are available at the NCBI SRA browser (Run accession number: DRR002185-DRR002190). The de novo assembly produced a total of 83 911 unique sequences (referred to as unisequences) including 33 191 isotigs and 50 720 singletons (Table 1). The average size of isotigs was 992 bp and the N50 isotig size was 1191 bp, while the average length of the unisequences was 747 bp (Supplementary Fig. S1a and b). Compared with other de novo transcriptomes in fish, such as spleen transcriptome of the orange-spotted grouper with an average length of 504–547 bp,24 our study produced a much better transcriptome assembly. Contigs and singletons are also available upon request. Summary of de novo assembly of the intestine transcriptome of Asian seabass based on RNA-seq dataLPS, lipopolysaccharide; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SW, seawater; FW, freshwater.Summary of de novo assembly of the intestine transcriptome of Asian seabass based on RNA-seq dataLPS, lipopolysaccharide; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SW, seawater; FW, freshwater.By using Blastn search reciprocally, only 46.46% (38 992) of the unisequences in the new built had significant matches to the Asian seabass NCBI EST data set. The remaining 44 919 (53.54%) unisequences without significant similarity to the previous EST data set were considered to represent new sequences in Asian seabass. We also compared the new assembly with the unigene sequences of the model fish species to evaluate the depth and breadth of our unisequence data set. 40.82 and 67.41% of transcriptome data sets of Danio rerio and Gasterosteus aculeatus had significant hits in the seabass intestine transcriptome, respectively. However, only 6.63–17.00% unisequences of the intestine transcriptome could be mapped onto the unigenes sequences of Takifugu rubripes and Gasterosteus aculeatus, respectively. These data suggest that a large number of new gene sequences are discovered in the Asian seabass intestine transcriptome. This intestine transcriptome can serve as a reference sequence database for intestine comparative transcriptome analysis in fish. The summary of reciprocal comparison between public EST data sets and the intestine transcriptome data set of the Asian seabass by Blastn program is presented in Supplementary Table S1.We found that 16 512 (49.75%; Refseq_RNA) to 18 036 (54.34%; Refseq_protein) isotig-originated unisequences, and 9915 (19.55%; Swissprot) to 28 861 (56.90%; refseq_RNA) singletons had significant matches to the different databases (Supplementary Table S3). A total number of 10 790 isotigs and 5501 singletons showed significant matches in 303 pathways. Metabolic pathways (735 unigenes), pathways in cancer (186 unigenes) and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites (155 unigenes) were the three pathways containing most unigenes. Supplementary Table S4 presents the KEGG automatic annotation of the Asian seabass intestine transcriptome. Combining of all these Blast results revealed that 20 318 isotigs (61.22%) and 32 037 singletons (63.16%) were annotated. The new intestine transcriptome supplies substantial new gene resources for studying interesting biological questions besides stress responses in fish.ORFs for 32 920 isotigs (99.18%) and 50 336 singletons (99.24%) were successfully predicted, suggesting that most unisequences without Blastx hits are derived from protein-coding genes. Based on the predicted protein sequences, 2140 signal peptides for isotigs and 1622 signal peptides for singletons were predicted using the SignalP 4.0 server (Supplementary Table S5). Because a signal peptide directs the transport of a protein, therefore, ~4.48% of the transcriptome proteins were likely destined to the secretory pathway in the fish intestine. Our predictions are similar to the published data of other species, such as parasites (3305–4246 sequences; 6.5–6.9%)25 and trematode (1534 sequences; 5.03%).26To validate the digital gene expression analysis from the intestine RNA-seq data, 56 genes were randomly selected for qPCR analysis of samples at 8 days post-fasting challenge and the control. In the two data sets, most genes showed similar responses to the fasting challenge. The RNA-seq data had a positive linear relationship with qPCR data (Pearson correlation coefficients (r) = 0.58; Supplementary Fig. S2). There was no statistically significant difference (t-test: P = 0.21) between two data sets, which was in concordance with the report in channel catfish RNA-seq study.13 These results indicate that the RNA-seq technique could provide an excellent tool for expression profiling studies. For non-model organisms without reference genome and transcriptome sequences, although RNA-seq with the Illumina sequencing platform could generate a large number of short sequence reads, it is very difficult to assemble and analyse the reads. Therefore, 454 sequencing generating much longer reads is the suitable choice in Asian seabass. It is to note that due to a lower number of reads in 454 sequencing in comparison with the Illumina sequencing, some extremely low expression genes might not have been detected in this study. In the future, RNA-seq with the Illumina sequencing technology could be used for more detailed analysis of profiles of gene expression.3.2. Stress responses in the Asian seabass intestineThe interactions between stressors and stress responses are highly complex, and some stress responses may themselves act as stressors and vice versa.2 To obtain a general view of DEG expression patterns, pairwise comparison of expression abundance in the RNA-seq data sets was first conducted. The scatter plots showed a linear relationship between pairwise data sets with positive Pearson correlation coefficients (r = 0.82 to 0.99, P < 0.01) (Supplementary Fig. S3), suggesting that expression patterns of most genes are similar, and only a small portion of genes were expressed differentially among different stresses.To explore DEGs in response to different challenges, we performed statistical analysis of gene expression between pairwise samples using the NOISeq procedure. Because the fishes used in this analysis are heterogeneous populations, more restrictive parameters than the defaults in the software were applied during data analysis. Volcano plots in Fig. 1 show gene expression differences between challenges and controls. The numbers of DEGs in response to LPS and Vibrio infection were higher than those induced by fasting and high-salinity stressors. These results suggest that some molecular response mechanisms are dependent on the nature of the stress signals, and LPS and Vibrio harveyi infection are the stronger stressors among the four different challenges (i.e. LPS, Vibrio harveyi, high salinity and fasting). Volcano plots showing the gene expression differences among challenges and controls. The RPKM-normalized transcript count data sets were analysed by using the NOIseq program: the x-axis shows the probability for each gene of being differentially expressed and the y-axis shows the log-ratio (gene expression fold change after challenge). For each treatment, the total DEG number that identified by the program (probability 0.8 as a threshold) was shown.Volcano plots showing the gene expression differences among challenges and controls. The RPKM-normalized transcript count data sets were analysed by using the NOIseq program: the x-axis shows the probability for each gene of being differentially expressed and the y-axis shows the log-ratio (gene expression fold change after challenge). For each treatment, the total DEG number that identified by the program (probability 0.8 as a threshold) was shown.When using probability 0.8 (means that the feature is four times more likely to be differentially expressed than non-differentially expressed) as the threshold for each gene of being differentially expressed, we found 1080 (Fasting) to 1739 (LPS) genes were differentially expressed between treatments and the respective controls (Table 2). Of which, 601 (high salinity) to 1139 (LPS) DEGs were down-regulated, and 410 (Fasting) to 627 (high salinity) DEGs were up-regulated. The observed values for DEGs are similar to those in the previous study based on RNA-seq in channel catfish, in which, 1633 DEGs at 3, 24 h, and 3 days between challenged and control intestine samples were revealed following Edwardsiella ictaluri infection.13 The DEGs in this study are similar to those in catfish.13 For example, around half of the DEGs in the category Cytoskeletal/Muscle Fiber Dynamics that were detected in channel catfish can be found in our DEG category following Vibrio infection, such as Actin (cytoplasmic 1), AHNAK nucleoprotein and Annexin A2. These observations suggest that some physiological responses to stressors in fish are well conserved evolutionarily. Around 31% (Vibrio infection) to 50% (LPS injection) of the DEG sequences in this study had no hit in the current protein or RNA databases, suggesting that these genes are novel. These newly identified DEGs are of interest for further study. The list of DEGs that were identified using NOISeq (probability 0.8 as a threshold) is presented in Supplementary Table S6. Summary of the DEGs and regulated pathways that identified in response to four treatments in Asian seabassSummary of the DEGs and regulated pathways that identified in response to four treatments in Asian seabassTo illustrate the differential expression of genes detected in the intestine among different challenges, a heat map of RPKM-normalized transcript counts for the top 60 DEGs in each pairwise comparison was generated through hierarchical clustering analysis (Supplementary Fig. S4). Interestingly, these genes were generally down-regulated after challenges. For example, after LPS injection, we found that 57 of 60 genes were down-regulated. The down-regulated DEG category includes some important elements in immunity and defence response, such as, Complement C1q-like (=4-fold), Cathepsin L (-32.7-fold), and Heat shock 70 kDa protein 12A (-12-fold). Similar results were also observed for Vibrio infection and during fasting (see details in Supplementary Fig. S4). The down-regulation of genes related to immunity and defence response may suggest that stressors depress the functions of some immune-related genes in the intestine. The significantly down-regulated genes after all four challenges may be used as biomarkers for detecting stresses in fish.The DEGs were mapped to different KEGG pathways. The results of mapping to the DEGs are presented in Supplementary Fig. S5 and Supplementary Table S7a. Ortholog assignment and mapping of the DEGs to the biological pathways revealed that 216 (high salinity) to 238 (LPS) pathways were in response to the 4 treatments, respectively (Table 2 and Supplementary Table S7a). Many pathways previously found acting in neurodegenerative disorder (e.g. Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease), regulation of cellular energy metabolism and biosynthesis (e.g. oxidative phosphorylation, cardiac muscle contraction, protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, fatty acid metabolism), and signal transduction (Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor [PPAR] signalling pathway, chemokine signalling pathway, MAPK signalling pathway) responded to the four stressors, suggesting their important functions in stress response. Interestingly, metabolic pathways contain the most abundant DEGs whereby most of the genes were down-regulated after the four challenges. For instance, glyoxylate/hydroxypyruvate reductase and arylamine N-acetyltransferase were down-regulated under LPS and Vibrio injection; 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase and ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase cytochrome b subunit were down-regulated after fasting and high-salinity treatments, respectively. The down-regulation of genes in metabolic pathways suggests that the four stressors inhibit metabolic functions of fishes. Ribosome biogenesis is among the most energy-consuming cellular processes,27 and it is therefore not surprising that the ribosome pathway is tightly controlled upon salinity change (significantly down-regulated by 7-fold), due to the disrupted homeostasis. Mature ribosomes are rapidly degraded by autophagy upon nutrient starvation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.27 To our surprise, the number of up-regulated DEGs in the ribosome pathway, e.g. large subunit ribosomal proteins L14e, L18Ae, L19e and L22e, significantly increased by 23-fold, when compared with the number of down-regulated DEGs after fasting, implying that selective biosynthesis of ribosomes is functionally important in response to fasting in fish.Crosstalks between biotic and abiotic stress signalling have been extensively reported in plants,28,29 yeast and animals.30 We observed that a lot of DEGs responded to two or more treatments, which may indicate that gene interactions or shared pathways are involved in these stress responses. A Venn diagram in Fig. 2 describes the overlap among genes differentially expressed after different stress challenges. One hundred and twenty-one genes reacted to both Vibrio infection and fasting, and 37 genes were found differentially expressed in all 4 treatments. For example, aquaporins that was involved in osmoregulation31 and pathogen infection32 showed responses to all four challenges. The overlapping of a set of DEGs in response to all the four different stressors suggests that there is a global coordination for stress responses in the fish intestine.

All the DEGs (probability 0.8 as a threshold) under four treatments were compared with each other. The unique genes in each library and crosstalk genes among different libraries were illustrated.To analyse the overlaps among differentially regulated pathways involved in the responses, we further compared the differences of regulated DEGs in each pathway under different conditions (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table S7b). We found that the DEGs in 75 pathways showed significant up-regulation, and the DEGs in 125 pathways displayed significant down-regulation in response to all challenges. Sixty-two pathways were classified into the down-regulated pathway category after all treatments. These pathways were mainly involved in metabolism, digestion and absorption processes, e.g. vitamin digestion and absorption, mineral, fatty acid metabolism, nitrogen, beta-alanine, propanoate, pyruvate, fat, glycerolipid, and signalling pathways, e.g. GnRH, neurotrophin, Fc epsilon RI, TGF-beta, phosphatidylinositol and PPAR. Our data suggest that stresses not only inhibit the functions of metabolic pathways, but also repress signalling pathways responsible for reproductive hormone production and growth. Twelve unique pathways were specifically enriched in the up-regulated category after all treatments. These pathways are mainly associated with disorders, signalling transduction involved in innate defences and related processes encoding antimicrobial peptides and proteins, e.g. measles, pertussis, hepatitis C, lysosome, Toll-like receptor (TLR) signalling pathway, notch signalling pathway, NOD-like receptor signalling pathway and cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction. These results suggest that the four stressors induced the expression of genes that related to innate immune defences. Recent studies on mouse revealed that acute and short-term hormonal stress induced an early increase of immune cells in rats33 and other stresses significantly enhanced the fish immune response.34 These results supply evidence supporting that stresses enhanced some immune functions for a short time.35 However, it is not known why the functions of some immune-related genes were enhanced, while other immune-related genes were repressed, which is worthy to further study. PPAR signalling is known to increase in the liver after fasting36 and is down-regulated in the rat gastrocnemius muscle37 and in the human skeletal muscle38 after a 48-h fasting. In our study, down-regulation of gene expression in the PPAR signalling pathway upon LPS, Vibrio infection, conditions of fasting and high-salinity treatments suggests crosstalks for the PPAR signalling pathway among different conditions.

The overlapping pathway numbers among different libraries are illustrated.Challenges of fish with stressors can cause specific changes in gene regulation. About 43.67% (645 of 1477; Vibrio infection) to 58.47% (718 of 1228; high salinity) of the DEGs were differentially expressed in a treatment-specific manner, respectively (Fig. 2). These data imply the importance of their roles in response to specific stressors. For example, we observed Annexin A2 (isotig00837), Monoamine oxidase gene (contig00009), Butyrophilin subfamily 1 member A1 (isotig00448) and Alkaline phosphatase (isotig00361) are unique in response to LPS, infection, fasting and high salinity, respectively. Similar functions have been shown for these genes in previous studies. Annexin participates in the establishment of inflammation and the immune response.13,39Monoamine oxidase expression in rats reduced after infection with Pneumococcus.40Butyrophilin subfamily 1 member A1 is assumed to contribute to milk secretion and lipid droplets,41 and Alkaline phosphatase is involved in osmotic stress.42 In addition, 9 (fasting) to 15 (high salinity) regulated pathways were treatment-specifically up-regulated, and 2 (Fasting) to 9 (Vibrio) regulated pathways were treatment-specifically down-regulated (Fig. 3). These unique pathways in response to different stressors generally contained few DEGs (less than four) (Supplementary Table S7b). Little is known about the expression response for most of these DEGs and pathways in fish during stress. The unique kinetic expression of specific genes and unique pathways implies their importance in host stress responses to specific stressors. It would be interesting to characterize their functions in future, such as how stressors are discriminated by host and the mechanisms involved in the stress response.Although the intestine is not a major immune organ of teleost fish, it plays an importance role in defence against pathogen invasion.43 It is generally believed that stresses depress the functions of the immune system.35 Different stresses may have different impacts on immunity.44 Our intestine transcriptome data set allowed exploring effects of stress on the immune system of the intestines in fish. We found that many DEGs (i.e. 177, 244, 108, and 123 DEGs in response to LPS, Vibrio infection, fasting, and high-salinity challenges, respectively) were classified into the immune system process. These DEGs including interleukin-1, interleukin-8, transforming growth factor, antimicrobial enzymes (e.g. lysozyme, lectin), MHC-related proteins, immunoglobulin superfamily members and pathways such as lysosome and the TLR signalling pathway responding to infection have been discovered (Supplementary Tables S6 and S7a). These data suggest a dramatic stress-related immune response to stressors in fish intestines. Interestingly, most immune-related DEGs were down-regulated after challenges (see Supplementary Table S6), suggesting that these stresses partially repress the immune function of the intestine.Fine-tuning of many immune-related DEGs were observed in response to different stressors. Stress induces an increase of a few inflammatory cytokines, such as C–C motif chemokine 25-like significantly increased after Vibrio infection, fasting, and salinity challenges. However, some other cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 10-like, granulins-like, tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 14-like were significantly down-regulated after the Vibrio infection. The members in the complement system, helping destroy the pathogens and eliminate the infection, also showed differential regulations. For example, complement C3-like is significantly increased after LPS challenge, which is an expected response to acute bacterial infection. However, complement C1q-like protein 2-like showed significant down-regulation after LPS and Vibrio challenges, but substantial up-regulation after fasting and salinity challenges. Our data suggest complicated regulation of cytokines and complement factors in the fish intestines during different stresses. Meprins generate biologically active IL-1ß from its precursor pro-IL-1ß and play a critical role in the inflammatory response.45 We found that meprin A subunit beta-like was significantly down-regulated (~ 6–9-fold) after the Vibrio infection, but increased by 2–3-fold after fasting and salinity challenges, suggesting its important role in different stress responses. Immunoglobulins play critical role in mucosal immunity, acting as the first line of adaptive humoral immune defence at mucosal surfaces in mammals. We found that immunoglobulin lambda-like polypeptide 1-like was down-regulated (2–3-fold) after LPS injection and Vibrio infection, but significantly increased by 2-fold after fasting, suggesting differential expression level of the adaptive immune system in fish in response to different stressors. Serum amyloid helps the immune system to recognize invasion by bacteria.46 In the liver of Atlantic salmon, serum amyloid A, complement factor B, and serotransferrin were decreased in expression following starvation, but serum amyloid A and complement factor increased after infection.47 In our study, serum amyloid P-component-like was highly induced after LPS injection (~2.6-fold), fasting (~23-fold), and salinity (~156-fold) challenges, but down-regulated after Vibrio infection (>100-fold). These results suggest that although there is a global coordination of gene expressions under different stresses, there is a fine-tuning of many immune-related DEGs in response to different stressors. Future studies on DEGs related to immune-responses would help to elucidate the complex alterations of the immunological network under stress.3.3. Structure and functional implication of splice variants of IFABP genesSplice variants can increase the proteome diversity and cellular function.48 In the RNA-seq data, ~7% genes contain splice variants (data not presented). Of which, IFABP (fatty acid-binding protein, intestinal) genes showed significant responses to different challenges. Since these challenges, such as fasting, seriously affect the nutritional and health status of fish, we speculated that IFABP genes are important to the growth and development of fish. To explore the functions of the IFABP genes, we cloned the genomic DNA regions of the IFABP genes. In comparison of the genomic DNA regions with the transcript sequences and the prediction of ORF for these genes, we identified four splice variants (a1-a4) for IFABP-a and two splice variants (b1-b2) for the IFABP-b gene (Fig. 4A and Supplementary Fig. S6). The length for the possible ORF for each variant ranged from 43 amino acids (a4) to 177 amino acids (a2). All of the predicted protein sequences showed sequence conservation with the reported IFABP genes. To find the association of the genes to growth traits, we developed SNP markers from their genomic sequences and conducted QTL mapping by using an Asian seabass F2 family with 359 individuals and their growth trait data.49 IFABP-a and IFABP-b were mapped onto the linkage group LG5 and LG14 of the Asian seabass genetic map, respectively. Interestingly, we found that an IFABP-a-SNP1245 marker was located near or on a QTL with a proportion of explained phenotypic variance of 10.2% for body weight that were measured at the age of 9 months.49 IFABP-a-SNP1245 showed high heterozygosity (CG genotype; 77–90%) in the large body weight group (n = 30) and showed low heterozygosity (20–30%) in the small body weight group (n = 30) (Fisher's exact test: P < 0.001).49 Both analyses suggested that the SNP mutation IFABP-a-SNP1245 was significantly associated with growth. To further characterize the expression pattern of IFABP splice variants, we performed the qPCR gene expression of the splice variants in the intestines of the Asian seabass samples with extreme growth traits (Fig. 4B). We found that all of the four splice variants of the IFABP-a gene and the two splice variants of the IFABP-b gene were significantly highly expressed in the big size group of fishes (P < 0.01), although there were small expression differences among individuals within same groups. The IFABP genes were abundantly expressed in the fish intestines50,51 and involved in the uptake of dietary fatty acids and their intracellular transport.50 In mammals, significant associations were found among fatness, the abundance of IFABP and growth.52,53 The present findings that growth was related to the IFABP expression in fish were consistent with previous researches.52,53 The higher ability to harvest dietary fatty acids from food as reflected by higher expression of IFABP genes in the intestines of big size fishes may partially explain their fast growth. Our study underlines the importance of splicing variants of IFABP genes in the growth and stress response of the Asian seabass.

ConclusionsThis study represents the first RNA-seq-based gene expression analysis in response to several stressors in cultured food fish species, and supplies large transcriptome data for the addressing of biological questions in fish. We detected a broad representation of stress-related genes in many pathways in response to different challenges. The overlap among DEGs and regulated pathways after different challenges suggest a global coordination in response to different stressors. The differences in DEGs and regulated pathways in the response to distinct types of stress suggest the fine-tuning of gene regulation during different stresses. In addition, we detected dramatic immune responses of the intestine under different challenges. This study is the first step towards achieving a comprehensive view of the molecular mechanisms underlying stress responses. Further detailed analysis of the functions of DEGs and pathways, as well as their interactions will enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the response of fish to stressors.Supplementary dataSupplementary Data are available atwww.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis research is supported by the National Research Foundation Singapore under its Competitive Research Program (CRP Award No. NRF-CRP002-001).We thank MAC, AVA for long-time co-operation on Asian seabass breeding, our lab members for assisting in tissue sample collection and Ms Natascha May Thevasagayam for helping in data analysis.

IntroductionIn higher eukaryotes, centromeres and telomeres generally contain heterochromatin, the DNA component of which is usually repetitive sequences. The heterochromatin is often amplified so extensively as to form pericentric or subtelomeric heterochromatin blocks. In primates (order Primates), most of the species, including humans, carry pericentric heterochromatin blocks large enough to be visible on microscopy of metaphase chromosomes.1,2 Alpha satellite DNA is a major DNA component of these heterochromatin blocks,3–6 and other repetitive sequences are also known to be present there, such as satellite 1,6 satellite 2,7 and beta satellite.8 A well-known example of large-scale subtelomeric heterochromatin blocks in primates is that of chimpanzees and bonobos.9–12 These species, together with humans, belong to family Hominidae (hominids) and are phylogenetically closest to humans among extant species. Interestingly, humans do not have visible subtelomeric heterochromatin blocks. Another clear example of large subtelomeric heterochromatin blocks is that of siamang, a species of family Hylobatidae (gibbons; also called small apes).2,13 Similar to Hominidae, this family includes species such as white-handed and hoolock gibbons that do not have large subtelomeric heterochromatin blocks.14  This sporadic distribution of heterochromatin blocks among species suggests that such blocks undergo rapid increase and decrease in size and even new birth and extinction. This view is supported by the fact that the nucleotide sequences of constituent repetitive DNAs differ between the subtelomeric heterochromatin blocks of chimpanzee/bonobo and those of siamang.13 In our previous study, we examined the nucleotide sequence variation of the chimpanzee/bonobo heterochromatin, and statistical analysis revealed that it was lost in the human lineage after the divergence of these species and humans.15Owl monkeys (genus Aotus; also called night monkeys) are members of parvorder Platyrrhini (New World monkeys), whereas hominids and gibbons as well as Old World monkeys (family Cercopithecidae) belong to parvorder Catarrhini. It has long been known that owl monkeys contain large-scale constitutive heterochromatin blocks at chromosome ends.16–18 We confirmed the presence of heterochromatin blocks through C-banding of chromosomes (shown below), using Azara's owl monkey (Aotus azarae) as a specimen. The heterochromatin blocks of this species are as large as those of chimpanzee, bonobo, and siamang, but exhibit a small but significant difference in chromosomal location; they constitute the entire short arms of acrocentric chromosomes. Because one end of this heterochromatin block is centromere and the other end is telomere, the heterochromatin block can be regarded as both pericentric and subtelomeric heterochromatin blocks. The purpose of the present study was to determine which category is most appropriate for the heterochromatin blocks of the owl monkey, and to infer its formation processes. For this purpose, we cloned the DNA component of this heterochromatin by using a modified genomic hybridization method, analysed its structure through DNA sequencing, and examined its distribution on chromosomes using a fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) technique.One significant finding of the study was that the pericentric region of some metacentric chromosomes also contained the heterochromatin. On the basis of our results, we propose that the heterochromatin was transferred from chromosome to chromosome as pericentric heterochromatin and amplified there as subtelomeric heterochromatin, forming the short arms of acrocentric chromosomes. Heterochromatin blocks at chromosomal locations similar to those of the owl monkey may be found in many other organisms. To our knowledge, the present study is the first to examine the formation processes of such heterochromatin blocks using sequence analysis of constituent repetitive DNA.2. Materials and methods2.1. AnimalsAdult primate species bred at the authors' institution (Primate Research Institute of Kyoto University; KUPRI) were used for this study. The main specimen, A. azarae (Azara's owl monkey; female; simply called owl monkey hereafter), was the same one used in our previous study and is described therein in detail.19Saguinus oedipus (cotton-top tamarin; male), Saimiri sciureus (squirrel monkey; male), Cebus apella (brown capuchin; male), Callithrix jacchus (common marmoset; male), Macaca mulatta (rhesus macaque; male), and Hylobates lar (white-handed gibbon; female) were used for comparison. A male adult human (Homo sapiens) was also a donor in the study. All experiments were conducted according to the Guidelines for Care and Use of Nonhuman Primates (version 3; June 2010) of KUPRI.2.2. Chromosome analysesWe prepared chromosome spreads using white blood cells and subsequently performed C-band staining, 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining, and FISH analysis, as described previously.11,132.3. Genomic DNA extractionGenomic DNA was extracted from white blood cells, or cultured cells originating from epithelial tissue, using a standard method that included cell lysis with sodium dodecyl sulphate, protein digestion with proteinase K, salt sedimentation, and DNA precipitation with isopropanol. The DNA precipitate was reconstituted in 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0).2.4. Genomic library and screeningWe used the genomic library of the owl monkey specimen that we constructed for our previous study.19  The vector was the 8.1-kb fosmid pCC1FOS, which is maintained as a single copy in bacterial cells with a negligible frequency of recombination. The insert DNA consisted of 40- to 44-kb genomic DNA fragments that had been mechanically sheared using a syringe needle and recovered from agarose gel after electrophoresis.To screen the genomic library for repetitive sequences, we used a modified genomic hybridization method as described in our previous studies.13,20,21 Briefly, bacterial cells containing recombinant DNA were plated on agar media, individual colonies were transferred to 96-well plates containing liquid media, bacterial cell culture was blotted onto nylon membranes, and DNA was denatured using an alkali solution and then hybridized with alkaline phosphatase-labelled genomic DNA as a probe. Subsequently, we obtained candidates containing repetitive DNA by selecting clones displaying relatively strong signals. An advantage of this method is that repetitive DNA is detected irrespective of its nucleotide sequence. Another advantage is that the detection efficiency is positively correlated with the repetition scale; namely, the higher the copy number of a repetitive sequence, the easier it is to detect owing to stronger hybridization signals and a larger number of signal-producing colonies.2.5. Other DNA manipulationWe performed subcloning, DNA sequencing, polymerase chain reaction, colony hybridization, and Southern hybridization by using methods described previously.13 Specific experimental conditions are described in each case.3. Results3.1. Chromosome composition and cytological location of heterochromatinHeterochromatin appears as darkly stained portions on C-band staining of chromosomes. Figure 1 shows the C-band staining of a metaphase spread of the female owl monkey specimen. This spread contained 20 metacentric and 30 acrocentric chromosomes. The centromere regions of all chromosomes and the short arms of all acrocentric chromosomes were heavily stained. We examined more than 20 metaphase spreads, all of which exhibited these features. In addition to these heavily stained portions, lightly or faintly stained interstitial regions were observed. We did not examine the locations of these regions, however, because accurate comparison of their locations among spreads could not be expected.

Cloning of highly repetitive sequencesThe results of C-band staining showed the presence of large amounts of heterochromatin in the short arms of acrocentric chromosomes. Assuming that the heterochromatin blocks comprised similar sequences that occupied a large fraction of the genome, we screened the owl monkey genomic library for repetitive sequences. A total of 576 clones (6 plates × 96 wells) were hybridized with owl monkey genomic DNA labelled with alkaline phosphatase. The colonies displayed signals of various intensities on autoradiograms. A representative autoradiogram is shown in Fig. 2. The signal intensity reflects the repetitiveness of the respective clones in the genome. We chose the eight clones with the highest intensity signals for further study. Detection of clones containing repetitive sequences. Bacterial cells isolated from the owl monkey genomic library were spread onto agar plates containing Luria Bertani (LB) broth and chloramphenicol, so that they would form colonies at a low density. Single colonies were then inoculated into liquid LB/chloramphenicol medium placed in the wells of six 96-well plates and cultured to the late log growth phase. Six nylon membranes were each blotted with 1.5 µl upper-layer bacterial culture, in the same arrangement as that of the 96-well plates. The membranes were then hybridized with owl monkey genomic DNA labelled with alkaline phosphatase as the probe. The clones exhibited various signal intensity levels, and the first membrane is shown. The clone at position E8 contained the OwlRep sequence.Detection of clones containing repetitive sequences.

The clone at position E8 contained the OwlRep sequence.3.3. Identification of novel tandem repeat sequencesWe sequenced the terminal regions (600–800 nucleotides from both ends) of the eight selected clones using universal sequencing primers (M13 and reverse primers). All sequence reads were found to contain tandem repeats. Our previous study19 identified two types of alpha satellite DNA as large-scale repetitive sequences, using the method described herein. These sequences had been named OwlAlp1 and OwlAlp2, and their repeat units were 185 and 344 bp in length, respectively. Of the eight clones we selected via the library screening, two contained OwlAlp1 and four had OwlAlp2. The remaining two clones were previously unknown repeat DNA sequences comprising 187-bp repeat units. We designated the newly identified tandem repeat sequence, OwlRep.3.4. Cloning and sequencing of an OwlRep fragmentWe determined the nucleotide sequence of an OwlRep clone. Primer walking and shotgun sequencing are the principal strategies for obtaining the sequence of long DNA fragments. These methods were, however, inapplicable to OwlRep because of its repetitive complexity. We therefore implemented an alternative strategy to prepare nested deletion clones of different lengths. This process involved the use of recognition sites of the restriction endonuclease AatII (GACGTC), which were present in most of the repeat units of the sequences in the terminal regions.We first subcloned an 8.5-kb fragment of the fosmid clone, obtained through digestion with EcoRV, into the plasmid pBluescript II SK+. We digested this subclone completely with BamHI (one site in the vector, but no site in the insert DNA) and then incompletely with AatII. After blunting the DNA ends with T4 DNA polymerase and ligation to form circular DNA molecules with T4 DNA ligase, we introduced the treated DNA into competent bacterial cells, spread the culture on agar plates, and subsequently picked up several colonies. We selected plasmid clones with insert sizes that differed by multiples of ~300 bp and sequenced them using the M13 universal primer. The sequence reads obtained were edited into a single stretch. We devised a criterion with which to exclude sequencing errors, to ensure that every nucleotide site contained a nucleotide that was (i) identical in two different clones or (ii) present in the majority of more than three different clones. A 5.1-kb region within the 8.5-kb clone fulfilled this criterion. We deposited the 5.1-kb sequence in DDBJ (accession number: AB746944) and used it for our subsequent analyses.3.5. Overall structure of OwlRepWe compared the 5.1-kb sequence with itself through dot matrix analysis to identify regions that share significant similarities (Fig. 3A and B). Long diagonal lines repeated at regular intervals were observed, indicating tandem repeat structures in OwlRep. In addition, several short lines were observed within each repeat unit, suggesting that the repeat units contained short tandem repeat sequences. Another dot matrix analysis that compared OwlRep and its complementary sequence (Fig. 3C and D) suggested that the repeat units also contained inverted-repeat sequences represented by several short lines. Tandem repeat structure revealed through dot matrix analysis. Sequences were compared with dot matrices using the criterion that a 70% match should exist over a window of 10 nucleotides. The scales are shown in units of nucleotides. (A) Entire region of the 5.1-kb OwlRep sequence compared with itself. (B) Magnification of the region in the internal box in (A).

Consensus sequenceWe cut the 5.1-kb OwlRep sequence into repeat units via visual examination and finally obtained 26 consecutive repeat units. These units were aligned using the ClustalW2 program (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalw2/), and a consensus sequence based on this alignment was drawn using the Advanced Consensus Maker program (http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/CONSENSUS/AdvCon.html). The alignments of the nucleotide sequences of the repeat units and the consensus sequence are shown in Fig. 4. The length of the consensus sequence was 187 bp. The distribution of the unit lengths was 187 bp (21 of 26; 81%), 182 bp (4 of 26; 15%), and 181 bp (1 of 26; 4%).

Sequence features of repeat unitsThe dot matrix analysis of the OwlRep sequence (Fig. 3) revealed that both tandem and inverted repeat structures were present within the repeat units. Notably, we identified sequence blocks exhibiting these features by manually analysing the consensus sequence.We found several direct repeats. Among them, the repeats of the largest scale were four 17-bp blocks containing up to two mismatched nucleotides (Fig. 5A). These repeats spanned about half of the consensus sequence. With respect to inverted repeats, several pairs of blocks were found scattered throughout the consensus sequence (Fig. 5B). Of the 14 pairs identified, six were palindrome pairs (inverted repeats with no intervening nucleotides). The other eight pairs contained one nucleotide between the components, which could be regarded as hairpin structures. The largest inverted-repeat pair consisted of 8-bp units.

Mapping of OwlRep on chromosomesWe conducted FISH analysis of mitotic metaphase chromosomes to determine the chromosomal locations of the OwlRep sequence (Fig. 6). It was dual-color FISH assays using OwlAlp1 or OwlAlp2 as an additional probe. In each assay, we examined the hybridization patterns of more than 20 complete metaphase spreads and confirmed that they displayed identical patterns. In accordance with our previous study,19 the OwlAlp1 probe showed signals on the centromeres of all chromosomes (panel A, green), and OwlAlp2 showed signals in the pericentric regions of most chromosomes (panel C, green). Of 30 acrocentric chromosomes, 28 exhibited signals for OwlRep in their short arms. The other 20 chromosomes were metacentric, and 4 exhibited signals for OwlRep in the pericentric region on only one side of the centromere (panels A and C, red).

Distribution of OwlRep sequences among speciesWe performed a genomic Southern blot analysis to analyse the distribution of OwlRep or similar sequences among various species of the Platyrrhini clade. Analysis of the agarose gel after electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining (Fig. 7A) revealed that both the distribution patterns and the staining intensities were similar in all lanes, indicating that the lanes contained approximately the same amount of genomic DNA, which had been completely digested with the restriction enzyme. However, the autoradiogram obtained after hybridization revealed that the signal was present only in the case of the owl monkey (Fig. 7B).

(B) Autoradiogram of the membrane hybridized with the OwlRep probe.4. Discussion4.1. Composition of short arms of acrocentric chromosomesBy applying the modified genomic hybridization method to the owl monkey genomic library, we cloned a highly repetitive sequence (OwlRep), in addition to the two types of alpha satellite DNA (OwlAlp1 and OwlAlp2) discovered in our previous study.19 FISH analysis revealed that OwlRep is a component of the heterochromatin that constituted the short arms of 28 of the 30 acrocentric chromosomes. The short arms of two acrocentric chromosomes did not exhibit a detectable signal in the FISH analysis. The short arms of these two acrocentric chromosomes are much shorter than those of the other 28 acrocentric chromosomes. Thus, it is likely that OwlRep was removed from these two chromosomes or has not been introduced into them.With respect to the 28 acrocentric chromosomes, the possibility that the short arms contained heterochromatin other than OwlRep cannot be excluded; however, OwlRep is likely the most abundant component. This likelihood can be attributed to our modified genomic hybridization method in which the cloning efficiency is expected to be positively correlated with the abundance of repeat sequences in the genome. In our initial screening, we selected eight clones exhibiting the highest signal intensity after hybridization, and these were found to be two OwlAlp1, four OwlAlp2, and two OwlRep sequences. Further, analysis of the other 32 highly positive clones via sequencing of only 1 end (both ends were not sequenced because the purpose was strictly confirmation) revealed that there were 6 OwlAlp1, 19 OwlAlp2, and 7 OwlRep sequences, confirming that no other repetitive sequences were present in a total of 40 genomic clones. These observations support the view that these three sequences comprise the great majority of the repetitive sequences in the owl monkey genome.4.2. Duality of OwlRep blocksHeterochromatin containing OwlRep as its main, or possibly only, DNA component constitutes the short arms of nearly all acrocentric chromosomes. These chromosomes have been categorized by cytogeneticists not as telocentric, but as acrocentric, chromosomes, because the heterochromatin blocks are large enough to be called arms.16–18 These arms are, however, unlikely to contain euchromatin regions (Fig. 1). Thus, these chromosomes are more appropriately considered derivatives of telocentric chromosomes in which a satellite DNA region was elongated. Alpha satellite DNA is a major DNA component of centromeres in primates, and OwlAlp2 is the ‘standard’ type of alpha satellite DNA of New World monkeys.19 Because the OwlRep region resides on the acrocentric chromosomes adjacent to the OwlAlp2 region (Fig. 6), it can be regarded as a pericentric heterochromatin block. At the same time, it can be considered a subtelomeric heterochromatin block, because the proximal end of the OwlRep region of the acrocentric chromosomes corresponds to the chromosome end on the photographs of the metaphase chromosome spreads (Fig. 6).4.3. Possible processes leading to the current OwlRep distribution on chromosomesThe transfer or exchange of sequence information most certainly occurs among the centromere regions of non-homologous chromosomes. Direct evidence in the case of the owl monkey is that OwlAlp1 is present in the centromeric constrictions of all chromosomes, as is OwlAlp2 in the pericentric regions of most chromosomes.19 Retrotransposons have recently been proposed to play at least a partial role in the mechanism for centromere homogenization among non-homologous chromosomes.22 In addition to being present in the short arms of acrocentric chromosomes, OwlRep was observed in the pericentric regions of 4 of 20 metacentric chromosomes (Fig. 6), implying that, regardless of where OwlRep was first generated, at least one transfer event of its sequence information occurred between a metacentric chromosome and an acrocentric chromosome. Thus, this distribution implicates a transfer of OwlRep to many chromosomes through the mechanism for the transfer of sequence information among centromeres. In other words, OwlRep was introduced into new chromosomes as pericentric heterochromatin blocks.An alternative explanation for the distribution of OwlRep is that it was transferred as subtelomeric heterochromatin blocks. The large-scale subtelomeric heterochromatin blocks of the chimpanzee, bonobo, and siamang are considered to have resulted from such sequence exchanges among non-homologous chromosomes. Nevertheless, this explanation is difficult to support for OwlRep because none of the arms of the metacentric chromosomes (40 arms) or long arms of the acrocentric chromosomes (30 arms) carries OwlRep in the subtelomeric region. For the same reason, the frequent transfer of OwlRep between the pericentric and subtelomeric regions is unlikely.The FISH results (Fig. 6) showed that most signals for OwlRep on the acrocentric chromosomes were more intense than those on the four metacentric chromosomes. This observation suggests that an OwlRep block introduced into a telocentric chromosome tends to be amplified more vigorously than that introduced into a metacentric chromosome. This difference can be explained by the hypothesis that OwlRep was amplified by a mechanism specific to subtelomeric heterochromatin. Strong support for this hypothesis is given by the observation that the OwlRep signals on the 28 acrocentric chromosomes appeared only on the short arm side of the centromere. Amplification on the other side would also be expected if OwlRep had been amplified as pericentric heterochromatin blocks as OwlAlp2 is (see Fig. S3 of Prakhongcheep et al.19). Signals on the metacentric chromosomes were also observed on only one side of the centromere. This observation, however, neither supports nor denies the hypothesis because the number of OwlRep-carrying metacentric chromosomes is as small as 4.If our above hypothesis (that amplification in subtelomeric regions is more vigorous than that in pericentric regions) is true, this result may simply reflect variation in amplification efficiency owing to differences in the amplification mechanisms between the two regions. Another possible factor is the complex structures of the OwlRep sequence. The repeat units of OwlRep contain several tandem repeat and inverted repeat structures (Figs 3 and 5). These complex structures, especially inverted repeats, might be blocks for strand synthesis during DNA replication, interfering with the activity of DNA polymerase. If such interference occurs, the host cell may rely on a DNA repair system that includes the removal of nucleotide blocks. If this repair is incomplete, the DNA may contain unsealed nicks, which may lead to scission of the chromosome. In fact, one often encounters a situation that extension of complementary strands by DNA polymerase is halted in an inverted repeat region in reactions for DNA sequencing. It is also known that plasmid clones carrying inverted repeats are frequently rearranged unless one uses host bacterial strains that carry the uvrC and umuC mutations. These are cases observed in bacteria, but inverted repeats may have similar effects on DNA replication in eukaryotes. The harmful effect of chromosomal scission on the survival of a host cell would be more serious in the centromere region than it is in the subtelomeric region. This difference may lead to greater tolerance for vigorous amplification of OwlRep in the subtelomeric region.Heterochromatin blocks on the short arms of acrocentric chromosomes have been observed to some degree in other New World monkeys, whereas in owl monkeys, they are present on a much larger scale in all or most acrocentric chromosomes.1,23 Our Southern blot analysis provided evidence against the presence of OwlRep or similar sequences in the genomes of the other New World monkeys we examined (Fig. 7). Thus, the OwlRep sequence was likely generated, or amplified to its currently large scale, after the owl monkey diverged from the other New World monkeys. Coupled with the rapid amplification of the new type of alpha satellite DNA we reported previously,19 the owl monkey genome might have some factors leading to relatively frequent generation or amplification of tandem repeat sequences or, conversely, lack some factors to control the amount of repetitive sequences. In this regard, owl monkey is expected to help to clarify the general mechanisms of the formation and maintenance of constitutive heterochromatin blocks, of which currently little is known.FundingThis study was supported by Grants-in-Aid (23657165 to A.K., 23470098 to A.K., and 22247037 to H.H.) from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.

Overall, the results presented in this study provided insights into the generation and evolution of Helitron transposons and their contribution to transcripts.1. IntroductionHelitrons, originally discovered in the genomes of the model organisms Arabidopsis, rice, and Caenorhabditis elegans, are classified as DNA transposable elements (TEs).1 However, their sequence structures and mechanisms of transposition are completely different from those of other DNA transposons. They are thought to transpose via a rolling circle mechanism, because some intact Helitrons encode proteins that include the replication initiator (Rep) motif and helicase domain. These two genetic elements are necessary for bacterial IS91 (insertion sequence 91) transposition through a rolling circle mechanism.2 Although Helitrons do not have terminal inverted repeats or target site duplications, they preferentially insert into the dinucleotide AT and are characterized by a TC dinucleotide at the 5'-end, a CTRR motif at the 3'-end, and often a palindromic sequence near the 3'-terminus.In recent years, Helitrons have been identified in almost all eukaryotic genomes. They constitute 0–5% of total genomic DNA in some model organisms. For example, they comprise >2% of the genome in C. elegans,1 >0.5% in frog,3 ~3% in Nematostella vectensis,4 <0.1% in Aspergillus nidulans,5 ~3% in bat,6 ~2% in maize,7,8 and 1–5% in fruit flies.9 Furthermore, Helitron content is often highly variable among closely related species. For instance, they occupy 1–5% of genomic DNA in different fruit flies and 0.03–2.09% in different rice species.9–11Helitrons vary greatly in sequence length, even within the same Helitron family, in part because different gene fragments are captured by these elements. More than half of the Helitrons in the maize B73 genome contained gene fragments whose lengths ranged from tens of base pairs (bp) to ten or more kilobase pairs (kbp).7,8 Furthermore, genes captured by Helitrons reshuffled the transcriptome of maize.12 Hence, Helitrons, creating the diversity of coding regions, can lead to the evolution of new functional genes.12,13Although an increasing number of Helitrons are being identified in eukaryotic genomes, little is known about Helitrons in Lepidoptera. Recently, the genome sequences of three lepidopterans, Heliconius melpomene, Danaus plexippus (both Nymphalidae), and Manduca sexta (Sphingidae) were released, in addition to the previously available silkworm (Bombyx mori; Bombycidae) genome.14–16 Taken together, they provide an excellent resource for investigating Helitrons in Lepidoptera. The silkworm and M. sexta are moths, while H. melpomene and D. plexippus belong to butterfly. They diverged ~100 million years ago (mya).15–17The silkworm is a model insect for Lepidoptera and has important economic value for its silk and as a bioreactor. Approximately 40% of its genome consists of known TEs, with Helitrons comprising only 0.1%.18 In this study, we developed a structure-based approach to rescan the new silkworm genome assembly to identify Helitrons. We found that the silkworm genome harbours 21 Helitron families that occupy ~4.23% of the genomic DNA. Thirteen of these families are new and three are putative autonomous elements. Estimates of insertion date and diversity for each Helitron family suggested that most Helitron families experienced a single rapid expansion within the past 2 million years (my). Strikingly, these Helitron families captured 3724 fragments from 268 genes and contributed to at least 1.4% of silkworm full-length cDNAs. A comparative analysis of Helitrons within Lepidoptera was also performed.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Identification and characterization of HelitronsGenome sequences were downloaded for the following Lepidopterans as indicated: silkworm new assembly from SilkDB (http://silkworm.swu.edu.cn/silkdb); H. melpomene from the Heliconius genome project (http://butterflygenome.org/); D. plexippus V3 from MonarchBase (http://monarchbase.umassmed.edu/home.html), and M. sexta from NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AIXA00000000).To identify Helitrons, a series of Perl scripts were written to search for Helitron sequence characteristics, similar to ‘HelSearch’.11 Briefly, the method included four steps (Fig. 1): (I) a Perl script found Helitron end structures, includes hairpins, loops, and CTRRT motifs; (II) another Perl script scanned upstream from Helitron end structure; (III) all sequences were clustered using Usearch;19 (IV) the Helitron boundaries were sought. In the step IV, we extended the sequences of each cluster in both directions using a Perl script and aligned them using MUSCLE,20 then the Helitron boundaries were manually defined. Finally, we modified Yang and Bennetzen's method of classification.8 Sequences with identities >80% in the 30 bp of both their 5'- and 3'-ends were classified as members of the same family. Full-length sequences with identity >80% were classified in the same subfamily. Our programme and readme file are available upon request. Helitrons in the silkworm. (A) Helitron structure. (B) Pipeline for Helitron identification.Helitrons in the silkworm. (A) Helitron structure. (B) Pipeline for Helitron identification.To estimate copy numbers, we generated a consensus sequence for each Helitron family using DAMBE.21 We used these consensus sequences as queries for BLASTN searches of the corresponding genome database. In this step, a Helitron family was defined by E < e–6, pair-wise length >80 bp, and a minimum nucleotide identity rate of >80%. Sequences with a TC dinucleotide at the 5'-end and a CTRR motif at the 3'-end were defined as intact Helitrons.Copy numbers of relatively long Helitron sequences (<15 kb) were estimated as follows: (i) when each end almost perfectly matched the ends of a Helitron family's consensus sequence (identity >80%, pair-wise length >80 bp for each end), and when the sequence had a TC dinucleotide and a CTRR motif at the 5'- and 3'-ends, respectively, it was defined as a Helitron copy (Supplementary Fig. S1A–C). (ii) When each end almost perfectly matched (identity >80%, pair-wise length >80 bp) non-terminal regions of a Helitron family's consensus sequence and the sequence had no or one Helitron terminal sequence (either a 5' TC or a 3' CTRR), it was treated as two or more Helitron fragments (Supplementary Fig. S1D–F).To better understand the composition and structure of Helitron sequences, the AT content of each Helitron family consensus sequence was estimated using BioEdit (http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/bioedit/bioedit.html). UNAFOLD (http://mfold.rna.albany.edu/) was used to predict the Gibbs free energy (–dG) of each Helitron.22 Finally, all Helitron families were screened against the ISfinder (http://www-is.biotoul.fr/),23 RepBase (v. 17.08),24 and NCBI non-redundant (nr) databases to identify known families. Putative autonomous Helitrons were identified by using known autonomous Helitrons downloaded from RepBase as queries and performing TBLASTN searches against all the silkworm Helitron databases.2.2. PCR validation of predicted HelitronsFifteen accessions (02–320, DaZao, Ri9, 872, Ou18, Yi16, YinDuSanMian, WuLin1Hao, BH863, YingWenXing, LuoSa, RiXian2Hao, ALiKeSi, SanMianBai, and Zhong4010) representing the four main geographic strains of silkworm (Chinese, Japanese, European, and tropical) were used for insertion validation. DNA was extracted from individual pupae and moths using a standard phenol–chloroform protocol.25 A Helitron (BmHel-8) was randomly selected for insertion validation, and primers (BmHel-8-S: 5'-ATTGTCAGTGGTATCGTTGCTCC-3', BmHel-8-A: 5'-TAAGGGAATACAATAGAGCCGTG-3') were designed based on the flanking insertion sites.2.3. Estimates of insertion time and expansion eventsTo estimate Helitron age, all full-length sequences of each Helitron family were aligned using MUSCLE,20 and the amount of nucleotide substitution (k) between each Helitron and the family consensus sequence was calculated using Kimura 2-parameter (K2P) distance.26 The age of each Helitron was estimated using the formula T = k/2r, where r = 1.56 × 10-8, the neutral rate of substitutions per year in fruit fly, which has previously been used in silkworms.27,28 Neighbor-joining trees (pair-wise deletion of gaps and K2P substitution model) for Helitron families were reconstructed using MEGA4.29 Within each Helitron family, the frequency distribution of the number of pair-wise differences between sequences was calculated with Arlequin v. 3.11.302.4. Distribution of Helitrons on chromosomesAll identified members of each Helitron family were mapped onto chromosomes using SilkMap (http://silkworm.swu.edu.cn/silksoft/silkmap.html), and the copy number of each family on each chromosome was counted. We divided each chromosome into 100 uniformly-sized segments and estimated each Helitron family's distribution in these fragments using a Perl script. The positions of predicted genes in scaffolds and the lengths of scaffolds were downloaded from SilkDB (http://silkworm.swu.edu.cn/silkdb);31 a Perl script was used to identify the genes near to or containing Helitrons. To determine whether Helitron insertions into genes were due to chance, a computer simulation was performed.322.5. Gene fragment acquisition and contribution to transcriptsGene fragments captured by Helitrons were identified by using all identified Helitrons in a BLASTX search against the NCBI nr protein database (as of 22 January 2013). Captured gene fragments were identified if a homologue had a maximum expected value of e–10 in the silkworm, or of e–5 in a species other than silkworm. TE-related proteins were discarded.To evaluate the contributions of silkworm Helitrons to transcripts, we used all intact Helitron sequences as queries in BLASTN analyses against the expressed sequence tag (EST) database of the silkworm (http://silkworm.swu.edu.cn/silkdb). A match was defined when the fragments had at least 99% identity and E < e-10. All matching ESTs were classified as either parental transcripts (with a similarity between the EST and the parental genes of the captured fragment greater than that between the EST and the corresponding Helitron) or Helitron transcripts.To estimate whether the silkworm Helitrons contributed to 5' untranslated regions (UTRs), coding regions, or 3'-UTRs of the silkworm full-length cDNAs, we downloaded the silkworm full-length cDNA database from SilkBase (http://silkbase.ab.a.u-tokyo.ac.jp/cgi-bin/index.cgi). A Perl script was written to split each full-length cDNA into 5'-UTR, coding region, and 3'-UTR. Then, we performed BLASTN analyses against these three datasets with cut-off values of at least 99% identity and E < e-10. All matching transcripts were classified as either (i) parental transcripts (with the similarity between the transcript and parental gene greater than that between the transcript and corresponding Helitron); (ii) transcripts of Helitron transposase; or (iii) chimerical transcripts composed of other genes and Helitron fragments if a full-length Helitron copy matches a cDNA sequence and there is an overlapping region (matched region) between the position of the full-length cDNA sequence and the corresponding full-length Helitron copy in the silkworm genome.3. Results3.1. Identification, classification, and characterization of HelitronsWe used a structure-based approach to search for Helitrons in the silkworm genome (Fig. 1). First, we searched the silkworm genome for sequences with a characteristic Helitron end structure (Fig. 1A) and found 106 766 candidate sequences. We extended the sequence of each candidate upstream, clustered all candidates, and generated a consensus sequence for each cluster. In total, we obtained 1805 consensus sequences. Each consensus sequence was used as a query in BLASTN search against BmTEdb (http://202.202.1.217/BmTEdb/), and sequences that hit to other known non-Helitron TEs were discarded. The remaining 854 consensus sequences were used in a BLASTN search against the silkworm genome. We extracted no more than 20 most-similar sequences for each consensus sequence, aligned them, and manually defined the Helitron element boundaries (Supplementary Fig. S2). Finally, sequences were classified by similarity into families and subfamilies. This pipeline (Fig. 1B) identified 21 Helitron families (Table 1) that were designated BmHel-1 through BmHel-21.

Using a consensus sequence for each Helitron family as queries, we searched the BmTEdb, ISfinder, RepBase, and NCBI nr databases and found that eight families (BmHel-1, 2, 3 4, 5, 15, 20, and 21) had been previously identified. The other 13 families had no matches to any known Helitron (Table 1).To estimate the abundance of these 21 families, we searched the silkworm genome. We identified 67 555 Helitrons in total, which constitute about 19.7 Mb (~4.23%) of the silkworm genome. The insertion sites of these Helitrons into accession numbers (NCBI) are shown in Supplementary Table S1. Similar to previous reports on Helitrons,7,8 the silkworm Helitron size varied greatly both among and within a family; sizes ranged from 96 to 10 644 bp (Table 1). There were 202 very long (from 6000–10 644 bp) Helitron copies. The internal sequences of these Helitrons had at most 50% identity, but their ends (100 bp) had at least 80% identity. This pattern could be caused by different DNA sequences being captured either by the Helitrons or by the insertion of other TEs into the Helitrons. We identified 19 580 intact Helitrons, with a TC dinucleotide at the 5'-end and a CTRR motif at the 3'-end; they made up 10.7 Mb (~2.30%) of the silkworm genome. Of these, 15 272 (~78%) had at least 80% identity and 8615 (~44%) had at least 90% identity.The Helitron families were AT rich, with AT contents ranging from 56.61% to 71.9%. The average AT content of the silkworm genome is ~62%. Four Helitron families (BmHel-1, 7, 12, and 19) had AT contents that did not exceed the genome average (Table 1). Almost all of the silkworm Helitron families had high predicted –dG values, indicating that most silkworm Helitrons can form stable secondary structures.Putative autonomous silkworm Helitrons were founded based on homology. An autonomous Helitron should encode a Rep/helicase protein, because both the Rep motif and DNA helicase domain are necessary for transposition. All 141 known autonomous Helitrons were downloaded from RepBase and screened against all intact silkworm Helitrons. Three silkworm Helitron families (BmHel-2, 3, and 5) were putatively autonomous (Fig. 2). These candidate autonomous elements encoded complete open reading frames (ORFs), in addition to a Rep motif and helicase domain. For example, the SilkDB accession numbers of transposase for BmHel-2, BmHel-3, and BmHel-5 were BGIBMGA003354-TA, BGIBMGA012372-TA, and BGIBMGA008616-TA, respectively. Furthermore, two of the three putative autonomous families had EST evidence; BGIBMGA003354-TA matched the EST BY927485 (identity, 0.98; length, 760 bp) and BGIBMGA012372-TA matched ESTs BB983132 (identity, 0.94; length, 681 bp), BY932007 (identity, 0.99; length, 702 bp), CK528421 (identity, 0.95; length, 632 bp), and BY916909 (identity, 0.96; length, 657 bp). Thus, we concluded that these elements could be active in the silkworm genome. Three predicted putative autonomous elements in the silkworm based on protein domain.

Validation of predicted HelitronsA BmHel-8 insert site was selected for PCR verification in 15 silkworm accessions representing four main geographic strains. The results indicated that BmHel-8 was present in most of the strains, but absent in YinDuSanMian, YingWenXing, LuoSa, and RiXian2Hao (Supplementary Fig. S3). This polymorphism indicated that the Helitron was not fixed in the silkworm genome and verified the efficacy of our approach.3.3. Helitron abundance in other lepidopteran genomesTo investigate whether Helitrons were pervasive in lepidopteran, three other recently released lepidopteran genomes were searched for Helitrons. Helitron abundance varied greatly among these genomes (Table 1 and Fig. 3). For instance, H. melpomene had 10 Helitron families that comprised ~6.62% (17.1/260 Mb) of the genome. Manduca sexta harboured seven Helitron families that made up ~1.86% (7.23/388 Mb) of the genome. However, D. plexippus had only one Helitron family that represented only ~0.20% (0.48/237 Mb) of the genome. The locations of each Helitron in these three genomes are listed in Supplementary Table S2 (H. melpomene), Supplementary Table S3 (D. plexippus), and Supplementary Table S4 (M. sexta).

Underlined Helitron contents were identified in this study, while others came from previous studies.1,3–113.4. Distributions of Helitrons on chromosomesThe silkworm Helitrons were distributed on all 28 silkworm chromosomes and were uniformly distributed among chromosomes (P> 0.05; Supplementary Fig. S4). We also found that most silkworm Helitrons had no distinct insertion bias within chromosomes (Supplementary Fig. S5). When we examined whether the Helitrons preferentially inserted into or near genes, we discovered that their frequencies within introns and >1 kb from genes were significantly higher than expected (Supplementary Fig. S6), suggesting the silkworm Helitrons preferential insertion into these regions.3.5. Insertion times and expansion patternsWe estimated the age of each intact Helitron by first estimating k between each intact Helitron and its family consensus sequence based on K2P distances.28 The range was 0–0.69, but 15 443 copies (~79% of the 19 580 copies) had k= 0.06. Insertion dates based on these k-values ranged from 0 to >10 mya (Fig. 4A), but most expansion events appeared to have happened within the most recent 2 my (corresponding to k = ~0.06).

(C) Phylogenetic trees of BmHel-3a (bimodal pair-wise nucleotide diversity and more than one clade) and BmHel-18 (unimodal pair-wise nucleotide diversity and a single clade).To investigate the history of Helitron expansion in silkworms, pair-wise nucleotide diversities of intact Helitrons were calculated and histograms were drawn for each Helitron family. Most histograms were wave-like (Fig. 4B and Supplementary Fig. S7). These histograms indicated that each family may have experienced a rapid population expansion (burst) during its evolutionary history.35,36 Thirteen families (BmHel-4, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 20, and 21) of silkworm Helitrons had unimodal distributions, two (BmHel-2 and 3) had bimodal distributions, and the other six families displayed multimodal distributions (Supplementary Fig. S7), indicating that these Helitron families had experienced one, two, or multiple expansions, respectively.To further investigate the histories of these Helitron families, phylogenetic trees were reconstructed (Fig. 4C and Supplementary Fig. S8). Families with unimodal histograms formed star-shaped clades, indicating a rapid amplification from a single master element. Those with bi- or multimodal distributions had more than one clade, providing evidence for amplification bursts at different times. Most silkworm Helitron families experienced a single evolutionary radiation.3.6. Gene fragment acquisition and contribution to transcriptsTo estimate the numbers of gene fragments captured by silkworm Helitrons, we performed a BLASTX search against the NCBI nr protein database. More than 18% (3546/19 580) of the intact elements captured one or more gene fragments (Fig. 5A). The number of captured gene fragments ranged from one to six. Most intact Helitrons (~96%) captured no more than one gene fragment. A total of 3724 gene fragments from 268 genes were captured (Supplementary Table S5). Examples of genes captured by Helitrons are shown in Supplementary Fig. S9. Silkworm Helitrons within genes. (A) Distribution of the number of gene fragments captured by silkworm Helitrons.

(A) Distribution of the number of gene fragments captured by silkworm Helitrons. (B) Silkworm Helitrons contributed to coding regions and to 5'- and 3'-UTRs of full-length cDNA.To investigate whether these Helitrons had transcriptional activity, we performed a BLASTN search against the silkworm EST database and discarded parental transcripts. We found that 1317 (~6.7%) intact Helitrons had transcriptional activity, contributing to 1210 ESTs (Supplementary Table S6). Among these ESTs, five matched the transposases of BmHel-2 (BY927485) and BmHel-3a (BB983132, BY932007, CK528421, and BY916909), while 1205 matched 1317 intact Helitrons (Supplementary Table S6). We could not distinguish between Helitron transcripts and transcripts composed of Helitron fragments plus other genes (the 1205 ESTs), because most ESTs were too short.To estimate whether the Helitrons contributed to 5'-UTRs, ORFs, and 3'-UTRs of full-length silkworm cDNAs, we performed BLASTN searches and discarded parental and Helitron transposase transcripts. The intact Helitrons contributed to the 5'­-UTRs of 35 full-length cDNAs, to the ORFs of 44, and to the 3'-UTRs of 44 (Fig. 5B; Supplementary Table S7–9). These donated fragments contributed to 123 full-length cDNAs, which represented ~1.4% (123 of 8,654) of the silkworm full-length cDNAs. Examples are shown in Supplementary Fig. S10.3.7. New Helitron creation through combinations of different HelitronsBy clustering of all silkworm Helitron family consensus sequences with an all-versus-all BLAST search, we found that some distinct Helitrons had merged to form new Helitrons. Three examples are shown in Fig. 6: BmHel-6 was formed from forward-oriented segments of BmHel-7 and BmHel-8; BmHel-9 comprised forward BmHel-7 and reverse BmHel-8 segments; and BmHel-10 united forward segments of BmHel-7 and dBmHel-11.

Discussion4.1. Identification and characterization of silkworm HelitronsTEs in higher eukaryotic genomes are identified in two main ways: homology-based and structure-based methods. Homology-based methods are biased toward detecting previously identified families; its major limitation is that it cannot detect TEs that are very distinct in sequence from known TEs. In contrast, structure-based method use prior knowledge about the common structural features and can effectively identify unique TEs. However, a precondition for this method is that TEs have conserved sequence structures. Homology- and structure-based methods have been developed to identify Helitrons. The homology-based HelitronFinder has been used to identify Helitrons in the maize genome,7 but its applicability to other organisms is limited by the fact that Helitrons vary greatly among organisms. HelSearch is a structure-based programme.11We developed a new structure-based pipeline to identify Helitrons in the silkworm genome. This method was fast and effective. We used Usearch to cluster sequences with Helitron end structures rather than BLASTALL, which greatly sped the clustering but also generated a consensus sequence for each cluster. In addition, we discarded false-positive matches to non-Helitron TEs when all candidate Helitron sequences were used to BLAST against the known silkworm TEs. A total of 951 such consensus sequences were discarded. Finally, the computational requirements of this method were very low; an ordinary PC machine could complete all of the work. Our pipeline was structure-based like HelSearch, so both methods should have similar efficacy.Although the silkworm genome is rich in various types of TEs,18 few Helitrons have been identified. We performed a genome-wide structure-based scan for Helitrons and identified 21 Helitron families with a total of 67 555 copies. These Helitron families comprised ~4.23% of the silkworm genome, a proportion higher than in other organisms. For instance, Helitrons occupied >2% of the genome sequence in C. elegans, >0.5% in frog, ~3% in the N. vectensis, <0.1% in A. nidulans, ~1.3% in Arabidopsis thaliana, ~1.29% in Medicago truncatula, ~3% in bat, and ~2% in maize.1,3–8,11 Furthermore, our estimated proportion was much higher than the value of ~0.1% previously reported for silkworm.18 This discrepancy may be because the previous study used an homology-based search. Helitrons vary greatly among organisms,9,37 so an homology-based search could greatly underestimate Helitron content.We found that 13 of 21 Helitron families were new, while eight had been previously published in the BmTEdb or RepBase database or in papers.33,34 One silkworm Helitron-like family (Bm_1607) published in the BmTEdb was not identified in this study, because it does not have typical Helitron characteristics, such the 5'-TC dinucleotide and 3'-CTRR motif. These results, together with PCR verification, indicated that our approach was reliable and efficient at identifying Helitrons, but it could not identify structurally atypical Helitron families.We found that the silkworm genome had 19 580 intact Helitrons, many more than the 1930 intact Helitrons in maize, the 281 in Arabidopsis and C. elegans, the 230 in Medicago, the 651 in rice, and the 608 in sorghum.11 Their abundance and high sequence identities (>90% in 8615 of 19 580 sequences, or ~44%) in the silkworm genome implied a recent amplification history. Two Helitron families (BmHel-2 and -3) exhibited features of putative autonomous families. BmHel-5 (BmHel1p) was previously identified as putatively autonomous,38 suggesting that autonomous Helitrons may exist in the silkworm. However, BmHel-2 and -5 had very small copy numbers, just 79 and 80 copies, respectively. In contrast, some silkworm Helitron families with many copies did not have features of putative autonomous elements. A possible reason will be discussed below.4.2. Helitron abundances in other lepidopteransWe analysed Helitron abundances in three recently released lepidopteran genomes using our approach. Helitron abundance varied strikingly among lepidopterans. For instance, there were 10 Helitron families that constituted ~6.62% of the genome in H. melpomene. This proportion was much larger than the previously reported 5.37%,16 because we identified an additional big Helitron family (HmHel-6) that comprised ~1.17% of the genome. However, we did not find the low-copy-number families of Helitron-like-2, 8, and 10, because they lacked the 5'-TC dinucleotide and 3'-CTRR motif. Unexpectedly, only one family, representing ~0.20% of the D. plexippus genome, was identified. Thus, different lepidopteran genomes contained very different numbers of Helitrons, consistent with previous reports that Helitron content was highly variable even among closely-related species. For instance, Helitrons make up 1–5% of genomic DNA in different fruit fly species,9 0–3% in mammals.6,39Different Helitron abundances could be caused by three factors: (i) different rates of Helitron expansion or deletion in different lineages; (ii) vertical transfer with frequent diversification and extinction; and (iii) horizontal acquisition of Helitrons. For example, there were 21 Helitron families in the silkworm genome, but only one in the D. plexippus genome. These results could be caused by horizontal transfer. A previous study reported that five Helitron families (BmHel-3a, 4, 5, 20, and 21) experienced horizontal transfer in the silkworm.33 Furthermore, we found that an intact homologue of BmHel-16 was also present in the Cotesia sesamiae Kitale bracovirus genome. A phylogenetic analysis indicated that the silkworm BmHel-16 was more closely related to the C. sesamiae bracovirus copy than that to sequences from other Lepidoptera (Supplementary Fig. S8), suggesting horizontal transfer. However, BmHel-16 and the C. sesamiae bracovirus sequence had only 79% identity, implying that the horizontal transfer happened long ago.4.3. Distribution of Helitrons on chromosomesPrevious studies indicated that Helitrons preferentially insert into gene-poor regions.11 For instance, Helitrons in Arabidopsis were rich in pericentromeric regions. Similarly, Helitrons in the C. elegans genome were most abundant in the terminal regions of each chromosome, which are often in the heterochromatin state. However, the silkworm Helitrons were randomly distributed on chromosomes. If Helitrons generally insert into heterochromatin regions, their random distribution in the silkworm genome is expected, because silkworm chromosomes are holocentromeres.We also found that the numbers of Helitrons that inserted into introns and >1 kb away from genes were higher than expected. The reasons for this observation are not clear. A previous study proved that genes captured by Helitrons reshuffled the transcriptome of maize.12 Thus, preferential accumulation in intron regions could drive gene evolution through gene capture and exonization of Helitrons.4.4 Massive expansions and diversity patternsOur results indicated that major expansion events of silkworm Helitrons occurred in the past 2 my (Fig. 4A). Similarly, about 87% of BaShos insertions occurred within the most recent 5 my in A. thaliana and ~71% of Hel1-105 elements and 69% of Hel-106 elements inserted within the past 1 my in maize.7,40To investigate history of the silkworm Helitron amplifications, we estimated pair-wise nucleotide diversity and phylogenetic trees of the full-length Helitrons (Fig. 4B and C). Most Helitron families experienced single expansions. However, the mechanism was not clear. As discussed above, we did not find putative autonomous Helitron copies in some high-copy-number families (e.g. BmHel-8, 11, and 15). In contrast, some low-copy-number families (BmHel-2 and 5) appeared to be putative autonomous elements. These results were reminiscent of miniature inverted-repeat TEs (MITEs) that were highly transposable because of transposases encoded by distantly related and self-restrained autonomous elements in rice,41 a mechanism known as cross-mobilization. Thus, some non-autonomous Helitrons might move using transposases encoded by autonomous Helitrons. Whether this is true in silkworm Helitrons remains to be investigated.Why some silkworm Helitrons experienced bursts of expansion is not clear. Most Helitrons probably remain inactive for most of their evolutionary histories, and they may be suddenly activated by ‘genome shock’, as observed in rice MITEs. For instance, mPing is known to be activated by irradiation, cell culture, and recent domestication.42–44 The silkworm was domesticated from wild Chinese silkworms about 5000 years ago.45,46 Whether some silkworm Helitrons were activated by domestication is an interesting question.4.5. Gene fragments acquisition and contribution to transcriptsHelitrons vary greatly in sequence length, even within a family. One explanation is that these elements capture different gene fragments.7,8,12,47 Although some molecular mechanisms for gene capture have been proposed,48–51 clear experimental evidence for a particular mechanism is lacking. In this study, we found that 3546 intact Helitrons (>18% of all intact Helitrons) had captured one or more gene fragments, for a total of 3724 captured fragments. The average number of captured gene fragments per intact Helitron was 1.08, similar to the value (1.81) for maize Helitrons.8Furthermore, we found that ~6.7% of intact silkworm Helitrons (1317 of 19 580) had EST evidence. Based on a homology search against silkworm full-length cDNAs, we found that these intact Helitrons contributed to about 123 full-length cDNAs (~1.4% of the published total) by donating one or more exons. A recent study suggested that ~9% of maize Helitrons had EST evidence and could generate abundant transcripts through alternative splicing.12 Thus, Helitrons may play important roles in the evolution of silkworm transcripts.4.6. Generation of new HelitronsPrevious studies indicated that Helitrons could acquire new sequences by recognizing either a new 3' termination site or a new 5' start site.11,52 A hairpin was proposed to serve as a stop signal during Helitron transposition. When this hairpin is destroyed by unknown mechanism, a new hairpin-like sequence could be acquired, perhaps from nearby Helitrons, to generate chimeric elements.11 Interestingly, we found that two Helitrons could combine to produce a new Helitron (Fig. 6). Similarly, in maize, Helitron_mc2 was composed of ZmHelA5 and Helitron_mc.52 Thus, new Helitrons can be generated in different ways, making them the most diverse class of transposons.5. ConclusionsIn present study, we developed a structure-based approach to identify Helitrons in a genome and analysed their presence in four Lepidoptera species. Helitron abundance and the number of families varied greatly among these insect genomes. One plausible explanation is that horizontal transfer caused these differences. A systematic analysis of silkworm Helitrons revealed that they accounted for ~4.23% of the genome, much more than the previously reported ~0.1%.18 A total of 21 Helitron families were identified in the silkworm, and 13 were new families. Most Helitron families expanded within the past 2 my in a single radiation. Furthermore, we found that Helitrons contributed to at least 1.4% of silkworm full-length cDNAs, indicating their important roles in the evolution of the silkworm genes. In addition, existent Helitrons could generate new families by combining. Our results provided insights into the generation and evolution of Helitron transposons as well as their contribution to transcripts.Authors' contributionZ.Z. and M.J.H. designed the study.

IntroductionAngiosperm mitochondrial genomes are unique in eukaryotes because of their high rates of rearrangement, sequence duplication, ongoing gene loss, and frequent incorporation of foreign DNA.1–3 Land plant mitochondrial genomes vary in size from 1054 to >11 000 kb.5 Hence, the smallest land plant mitochondrial genome (Physcomitrella patens, 105 kb) is still ~11 times larger than the human mitochondrial genome6 (~16 kb). Several studies have reported the presence of subgenomic circles in mitochondrial genomes that have arisen from recombination events.7,8 While such recombination events in plant mitochondria increase the complexity of their genome structures, recombination has also been proposed to maintain genomic stability and may also provide a mechanism to increase genetic variation in the absence of sexual reproduction.9,10Rearrangements in mitochondrial genomes are of considerable biotechnological interest as they can cause cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS), which is a valuable tool for plant breeding programmes. Male sterility is caused by the failure of a plant to produce functional pollen grains.11 CMS is a maternally inherited trait and is mainly controlled by the mitochondrial genome. CMS is often found to be caused by chimeric mitochondrial open reading frames (ORFs) that are produced as a result of mitochondrial genome rearrangements.11–14 In many cases of CMS, male fertility can be restored by the introduction of nuclear genes known as restorer-of fertility (Rf) genes.Although plant breeders have used CMS technology for producing F1 hybrids for enhancing crop productivity in numerous cereal and vegetable crops, the development of F1 hybrids has not been possible in legumes because of their high levels of self-pollination. In pigeonpea, however, a moderate level of insect-mediated out-crossing exists that could be used to develop a stable CMS system.15 In 2005, Saxena et al.15 derived a stable CMS system, ICPA 2039, from an interspecific hybrid of cultivated pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan) and a wild relative (Cajanus cajanifolius) (Supplementary Fig. S1). Previous CMS systems have been attempted in pigeonpea,16,17 but have been unsuccessful, mostly as a result of instability in the expression of male-sterility and -fertility restoration.15 The development and utilization of stable male-sterile lines from different cytoplasmic backgrounds are a key factor to the diversification of pigeonpea hybrid parental lines. Indeed, male-sterility systems in many crops do not allow the generation of completely male-sterile progenies, drastically limiting the use of male-sterile lines in F1 hybrid seed production.18 To accelerate hybrid pigeonpea breeding for yield and quality, understanding the molecular basis of male sterility is critically important. Specifically, the identification of CMS-associated genetic polymorphisms is a key pre-requisite for rational development of new and improved CMS systems for the production of superior F1 hybrids. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has provided oppurtinities to gain the genetic information in a much faster and cost effective manner. NGS of mitochondrial genomes and analysis of genetic variations across the genomes of male-sterile, maintainer, and wild relative species will facilitate the identification of genetic features related to male sterility.This study reports the generation and analysis of mitochondrial genome sequences of four Cajanus genotypes: the male-sterile line ICPA 2039, the maintainer line ICPB 2039, the hybrid line ICPH 2433, and the wild relative ICPW 29 (C. cajanifolius). A high-quality pigeonpea mitochondrial genome assembly has been developed for ICPA 2039. This study provides the first comparative study of legume mitochondrial genome sequences and identifies several re-arrangements and no-coverage regions (large regions >1000 bp; with zero coverage), as well as chimeric ORFs associated with CMS in pigeonpea.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant material and mitochondrial DNA isolationCajanus lines ICPA 2039, ICPB 2039, ICPH 2433, and ICPW 29 were used as the source of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). mtDNA was isolated from 2-week-old etiolated seedlings and was purified before sequencing.192.2. Sequencing and assemblyMitochondrial genomes of four pigeonpea lines were pyrosequenced with the Roche/454 FLX sequencing platform following whole-genome amplification (WGA). WGA kit GenomePlex from Sigma (Sigma-aldrich, St. Louis, USA) was used in this study. Twenty nanograms of DNA template were used for WGA according to the protocol from manufactures. In summary, the WGA process was divided into fragmentation, library generation, and PCR amplification. The first two steps, fragmentation and library generation (3 kb of insert size), were carried out without interruption, to avoid the DNA degradation. Further to amplify higher amount of DNA, the GenomePlex reaction was allowed to proceed for 4 h. De novo genome assembly of the reference genome (ICPA 2039) was performed using Newbler, Celera, and CLC bio software programs. All the usable reads were aligned onto the contig sequences, and aligned paired-end sequences (PEs) were obtained. We then calculated the amount of shared PE relationships between each pair of contigs, weighted the rates of consistent and conflicting PEs, and then constructed the scaffolds step-by-step, beginning with the shortest insert-sized PEs, to long insert-sized PEs. Assemblies generated by the Newbler assembler were considered most robust in terms of length of the scaffolds and genome coverage and were used for further analysis. Gaps within the assembly were identified using contig-graph information. The Perl script, parse_link.pl, was used to identify and close the gaps in silico20 (http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/finishing/finishing-v1.tar.gz). Remaining gaps were filled by Sanger sequencing. Graphs were generated for a preliminary view of the assembly (Fig. 1) in an effort to check the order and orientation of mitochondrial scaffolds in the genome. Scaffolds that were not connected to other scaffolds in graph and showed low coverage were suspected to be part of the choloroplast genome. BLASTN searches were performed for these scaffolds against the NCBI database to validate these scaffolds are contamination from the chloroplast genome. Assembly graphs were used as a guide to connect the scaffolds. Primers were designed from the ends of the scaffolds that showed connections with other scaffolds in assembly graphs. The orientation of each scaffold within the assembly was confirmed by Sanger sequencing. A scheme showing linking scaffold with the help of graph in a preliminary view of the assembly. Assembly graphs were used as a guide to connect the scaffolds. Each box represent a scaffold, ‘||’ represent the 3' end, and ‘|>’ represent the 5' end of each scaffold.

The thick black lines indicate that the scaffolds are attached in correct orientation and spotted line indicate that the scaffolds are attached in reverse orientation in the assembly.

Gene prediction and annotationProtein-coding and RNA genes were predicted by performing BLASTX and BLASTN searches, respectively, against a database of protein-coding, tRNA, and rRNA genes complied from all previously sequenced seed plant mitochondrial genomes.21 tRNAscan-SE22 was used to corroborate the tRNA boundaries identified by BLASTN. A BLAST score of e-value <1e-3 and percent identity threshold of >70% were initially used for filtering BLAST outputs. Gene boundaries were extended or trimmed to the positions of the start and stop codons manually using Artemis 12.0.23 Annotation data were written to a Sequin-formatted table file with a set of Perl and CGI scripts.2.4. Gene-order comparisonTo identify colinearity between the pigeonpea mitochondrial genome and other angiosperms, we used BLAT (Standalone BLAT v. 34) with an identity cut-off of =0.9 and coverage of =0.5 to compare the gene order of our Cajanus genomes in a pairwise fashion with that of the following 11 angiosperms: Vigna radiata,24Triticum aestivum,25Oryza sativa,26Zea mays,27Arabidopsis thaliana,28Beta vulgaris,29Citrullus lanatus,21Cucurbita pepo,21Nicotina tabacum,30Vitis vinifera,31 and Cucumis sativus.322.5. Genome alignment and representationThe scaffolds of the three other mitochondrial genomes (ICPB 2039, ICPH 2433, and ICPW 29) were aligned with the finished assembly of ICPA 2039 genome using BLASTN. Circular genome representations of ICPA 2039 genome were generated using OGDRAW.33 Three different maps were generated to represent the alignment of ICPA 2039 genome with the three other genomes. Figures were scaled down to integrate all the four maps in a single map.2.6. Identification of rearrangements and no-coverage regionsComparative assemblies of all three genomes were generated using GS Reference Mapper 2.5. Raw reads of each mt genome were aligned to that of ICPA 2039 genome assembly in order to detect any sequence-level differences between them. Rearrangements with >60% frequency were considered for further analysis. No-coverage regions were extracted using a custom Perl script, which checks the coverage of every base in the assembly and groups the consecutive positions where coverage is very low. Regions >1 kb and with approximately zero coverage were considered as no-coverage regions.2.7. Chimeric ORFsSequences for ORFs >100 codons in the vicinity of rearrangements or within no-coverage regions were collected using Artemis 12.0.23 ORFs coding for known mitochondrial genes were excluded from the analysis. Further, these ORFs were blasted against the ICPA 2039 genome itself in order to check whether these ORFs carry part of other genes or ORFs. First hit of the blast match were left as that will be the original location of these ORFs. All the other hits showing identity =95% and sequence coverage of =16 bp were considered. Further, these ORFs were checked in terms of their closeness to any predicted gene. Potential transmembrane helices were predicted with TMHMM 2.0.34 A scoring crietria from 0 to 4 was assigned to each ORF, one for the presence of parts of other genes, one for the proximity of any predicted genes, one for the presence of hydrophobic domains, and one additional score for carrying parts of atp genes. ORFs showing score of =3 were considered as the potential chimeric ORFs.3. Results and discussionPigeonpea is an important legume crop for resource-poor smallholder farmers in marginal environments. Unfortunately, the productivity of this legume staple crop has stagnated at ca. 750 kg/ha due to its exposure to biotic and abiotic stresses. Pigeonpea recently became the first legume to have F1 hybrids released based on a CMS system.35 The initial pigeonpea F1 hybrids (e.g. ICPH 2671) showed >30% yield advantages over the best pure line varieties in the same geographic regions. Such advances clearly indicate that pigeonpea F1 hybrid technology has the potential to break the current yield plateau. For successful and sustainable pigeonpea hybrid production and extension, the following are critical factors: (i) diversification of parental lines and CMS sources, (ii) improvement of parental lines for tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses, and (iii) maintaining the purity of hybrid seeds. In this context, improvement of parental lines is underway through conventional and molecular breeding approaches that are being accelerated by the availability of a sequenced pigeonpea genome.36 Simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers-based F1 hybrid purity testing has also been initiated for ensuring the purity of hybrid seeds.37,38 However, major challenges remain in relation to the need for diversification of CMS sources in the pigeonpea genepool. Although seven cytoplasmic sources are available (Cajanus sericeus, C. scarabaeoides, C. volubilis, C. cajanifolius, C. cajan, C. lineatus, and C. platycarpus), only C. cajanifoius has currently been commercially exploited. The other six sources have not been able to be used commercially, because they express the CMS trait at an adequate level. To understand the factors conditioning the efficiency differences between sources of CMS, it will first be necessary to understand the molecular basis of CMS in pigeonpea.3.1. Sequencing and assembly of four mitochondrial genomes of pigeonpeaWe used Roche/454 FLX technology, targeted Sanger sequencing, and computational approaches to produce one complete and three draft assemblies for the mitochondrial genomes of four Cajanus lines. Northern blot-based screening and shotgun sequencing have been the conventional approaches used to identify CMS-associated chimeric ORFs in different plant species, including maize,39 sugar beet,40 rice,41,42 wheat,25 and brassica.43 Recently, Bentolila and Stefanov44 successfully identified a candidate for the wild abortive CMS-encoding gene by pyrosequencing of two rice mitochondrial genomes using Roche/454 sequencing technology. However, Northern screening approaches used for the same rice genomes failed to identify any potential CMS candidates in wild abortive rice CMS lines.44 Therefore, we used Roche/454 sequencing technology and a de novo assembly approach to sequence the mitochondrial genome of Cajanus species. Due to the unknown genome architecture of the pigeonpea mitochondrial genome, we did not rely entirely on in silico approaches, but also validated proposed interscaffold connections by Sanger sequencing. To identify regions which varied in a manner correlated with CMS, the four mitochondrial genomes were then compared using the ICPA 2039 assembly as a reference.Roche/454 sequencing of four genomes from purified mtDNA generated totals of 38.8, 15.6, 37.1, and 23.8 Mb of paired-end data for ICPA 2039, ICPB 2039, ICPH 2433, and ICPW 29, respectively. The sequencing reads were assembled into scaffolds using three different de novo assembly programs—Newbler, CLCBio, and Celera. Assemblies generated by the Newbler assembler were considered as the best assemblies (Table 1), with scaffold N50 values of 169.6, 1.2, 169.9, and 108.1 kb for ICPA 2039, ICPB 2039, ICPH 2433, and ICPW 29, respectively. Additional sequence data were generated for the comparatively under-sequenced genotypes of ICPB 2039 (15.1 Mb) and ICPW 29 (23.2 Mb). The sequencing data for these were reassembled and N50 of two assemblies thus improved from 1.2 to 12.8 kb for ICPB 2039 and from 108.2 to 159.2 kb for ICPW 29. In summary, mean scaffold lengths of 22.4, 8.8, 6.3 and 37.3 kb were achieved for the pigeonpea mitochondrial genomes of lines ICPA 2039, ICPB 2039, ICPH 2433, and ICPW 29, respectively. Analysis of sequence data for GC content indicated similar GC content distribution in all of the four genomes (Supplementary Fig. S2).

Finishing of reference mitochondrial genome ICPA 2039The scaffolds of ICPA 2039 were further refined by removing contamination from nuclear or chloroplast genomes, and by closing gap regions within these scaffolds using Sanger sequencing. A preliminary view of the ICPA 2039 assembly was generated to check the connections between the scaffolds and for the removal of contaminants (Fig. 1). Scaffolds from the mitochondrial genome assembly were selected based on their coverage and links with the other scaffolds as shown in Fig. 1. Selected scaffolds were subjected to BLASTN analysis against the NCBI database. Of 30 selected scaffolds of ICPA 2039, with a total length of 672 918 bp, seven were confirmed to be mitochondrial in origin, representing 532 372 bp or 79% of the total sequence data (Table 1). Seven scaffolds were homologous to cpDNA, representing 78 461 bp (11.6% of the total sequence). Eleven further scaffolds matched nuclear DNA representing 46 228 bp (6.9% of the sequence). Two scaffolds representing 8268 bp (1.2% of the sequence data) matched the sequence of the plasmid DNA. The remaining three scaffolds representing 8309 bp (1.2%) of sequence data did not show any match in the NCBI database and may represent sequences unique to pigeonpea. The seven scaffolds that matched other plant mtDNA were targeted for further analysis. A total of 38 gaps (26 830 bp) were observed in the seven mitochondrial scaffolds, represented by Ns in the assemblies. Using the parse_link.pl script (http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/finishing/finishing-v1.tar.gz) from the finishing toolbox (see Materials and Methods), 47 contigs from contigs that had not previously been assembled into scaffolds were introduced to fill 38 gaps inside the seven scaffolds. Two gaps (of 65 bp each), which the script was unable to fill in silico, were closed using Sanger sequencing technology. Subsequently, assembly graphs were used as a guide to connect the scaffolds. To confirm the order and orientation of each scaffold within the assembly, primer pairs were designed from the ends of each scaffold based on their connections with other scaffolds in assembly graphs. A set of 24 primer pairs (Supplementary Table S1) were used to generate amplicons and sequence data were generated for these using Sanger sequencing technology. In this way, a high-quality, circular-mapping mitochondrial genome of 545 742 bp in total length, with ~23-fold coverage, was assembled for ICPA 2039. This master circular molecule contains a large recombinationally active repeat of size 4951 bp, which is extending from positions 531 745 to 536 696 bp. Recombinationally active large repeats are a very common feature of plant mitochondrial genomes.45,463.3. Gene contentWithin the mitochondrial genome of ICPA 2039, we identified 34 protein-coding, 14 tRNA, and 3 rRNA genes (Supplementary Table S2), for a total of 29 346 bp of protein exons; 31 018 bp of intronic sequence; 5255 bp of rRNA genes; and 1477 bp of tRNA genes (Table 2). We did not find a copy of, cox2, confirmed proposals that this gene has lost in the legume lineages.24,47 In contrast, we found ICPA 2039 to contain two identical copies of the cox3 gene. Multiple copies of tRNAs for cysteine, lysine, and methionine were observed to be present in the mitochondrial genome of ICPA 2039. The tRNA genes, carrying methionine, are also highly similar to those of the plastid as is likely derived from the cpDNA, as is that of tryptophan (Supplementary Table S2). Genome coverage by coding features in ICPA 2039 mitochondrial genome assemblyaFigure in parentheses represents the percentage of total size.Genome coverage by coding features in ICPA 2039 mitochondrial genome assemblyaFigure in parentheses represents the percentage of total size.To annotate mtDNA-encoded genes in the other sequenced lines, their scaffolds were compared with ICPA 2039. Six scaffolds derived from the ICPH 2433 hybrid contained 32 protein-coding genes and 12 tRNA genes between them (Supplementary Table S3). Four mitochondrial scaffolds of ICPW 29 covered 33 protein-coding and 14 tRNA genes (Supplementary Table S4). As in ICPA 2039, multiple copies of cysteine, lysine, and methionine-tRNA genes were present in the scaffolds of ICPH 2433 and ICPW 29. Due to low sequence coverage and small scaffold size, the 17 mitochondrial scaffolds of ICPB 2039 line only covered 15 protein and 11 tRNA genes between them (Supplementary Table S5).3.4. Structural features of the pigeonpea mitochondrial genome compared with other plant speciesThe assembled Cajanus mitochondrial genome was compared with the mitochondrial genomes of 11 other land plant species. The species for comparison include one legume—V. radiata,24 three cereals—T. aestivum,25O. sativa,26Z. mays,27 and seven other eudicots, including A. thaliana,28B. vulgaris,29Citrullus lanatus,21Cucurbita pepo,21N. tabacum,30Vitis vinifera,31 and Cucumis sativus.32 In terms of mitochondrial genome size, the pigeonpea mitochondrial genome (545 742 bp) is substantially larger than the mitochondrial genome of closest sequenced legume species V. radiata24 (401 262 bp). The size of pigeonpea mitochondrial genome was found to be comparable in size with the mitochondrial genomes of cereal species, e.g. O. sativa (490 kb), Z. mays (569 kb), and greater than the median angiosperm mitochondrial genome size (473 kb). Mitochondrial genome size can not only vary between different species, but can also show variations between different lines of the same species. For instance, the genome size of five sequenced maize mitochondrial genomes is known to vary from 535 825 to 739 719 bp.39 The plant mitochondrial genomes are rich in non-coding regions and are highly variable in their non-coding regions. In our analysis, 12.29% of the pigeonpea mitochondrial genome was covered by the coding regions, which is lower than but comparable to V. radiata24 (16.88%), Brassica napus43 (17.34%), and Citrullus lanatus21 (18.8%). However, the coding regions of the pigeonpea mitochondrial genome were found to be greater than the Cucurbita pepo in which only 6.9%21 of the mitochondrial genome is covered by coding regions. Cucurbita pepo has a particularly large mitochondrial genome (982 833 bp), due to the insertions of chloroplast (>113 kb) and short repeated sequences (>370 kb) in the mitochondrial sequences.21 The available plant mitochondrial genome sequences therefore suggest that gene composition does not depend on total genome size. Gene number can be conserved despite changes in size derived from the insertion of repetitive sequences, or of sequences transferred from the chloroplast and nucleus into intergenic regions. In addition, a large number of rearrangements of genes and ORFs are common features in plant mitochondrial genomes.3.5. Comparison of gene order with other plant speciesWe also compared gene maps of protein-coding and rRNA genes encoded by the pigeonpea mitochondrial genome (ICPA 2039) with those of the other 11 sequenced plant species. Unsurprisingly, the highest level of synteny for the mitochondrial genomes was observed between C. cajan and the related legume V. radiata. For instance, one four-gene cluster (cox3-nad4L-atp4-rps10ab), two three-gene clusters (nad6-nad1-ccmB and rpl5-rps14-cob), and three two-gene clusters (rps3ab-rpl16, rps12-nad3, and ccmC-ccmFn) were syntenic between these two species (Fig. 2). On the other hand, only two two-gene clusters (nad3-rps12 and ccmC-ccmFn) showed synteny in mitochondrial genomes of C. cajan with three cereals species analysed (Supplementary Figs S3–S5). Two two-gene clusters (nad2ab-atp1 and rps3ab-rpl16) of the C. cajan mitochondrial genome showed synteny when compared with wheat and maize (Supplementary Figs S3 and S4). The most highly conserved gene cluster was the two-gene cluster of rps3ab-rpl16, which was syntenic across 7 of the 11 species (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Figs S3–S12).

Comparison of mitochondrial genome sequences among Cajanus linesComparisons of gene order typically highlight the high rate of mitochondrial genome rearrangements between different plant species. Our analysis indicates that the mitochondrial genome of pigeonpea shares only six gene clusters with the closely related sequenced species V. radiata,24 which between them cover only 16 genes. Fewer gene clusters was observed to be conserved in comparison with more distantly related species. Due to the dynamic nature of the plant mitochondrial genomes, extensive structural variations can also be expected to occur in different lines of a given species.46 Comparison of mitochondrial genomes from five different lines of maize revealed 16 rearrangements, even between two fertile cytotypes.39 To understand the patterns of genetic variation associated with CMS in pigeonpea, and its effects on maternal inheritance, we first aligned the scaffolds of the mitochondrial genomes of the three Cajanus lines (i.e. ICPB 2039, ICPH 2433, and ICPW 29) using BLASTN, together, with that of the male-sterile line ICPA 2039. This demonstrated that the genomes of ICPA 2039 and ICPB 2039 are highly diverged from each other. Conversely, the mitochondrial genome of the hybrid ICPH 2433 (produced from the ICPA 2039 × ICPR 2433 cross) showed the highest level of synteny with the ICPA 2039 line, followed by ICPW 29 (Fig. 3), supporting the model that the CMS trait is maternally inherited in pigeonpea hybrids.

Mapping raw reads of ICPB 2039, ICPH 2433, and ICPW 29 on to the assembly of ICPA 2039, a maximum number of rearrangements were observed in the fertile and sterile lines of ICPA 2039 system (Supplementary Fig. S1). While building the comparative assemblies, we identified the no-coverage regions along with the rearrangements in order to reduce the effects of sequencing artifacts in further comparison. Twenty-two rearrangements and 17 no-coverage regions were observed in ICPB 2039 compared with ICPA 2039. Using the same criteria, 9 rearrangements and 12 no-coverage regions were observed in the mitochondrial genome of ICPW 29 when compared with that of ICPA 2039. These nine rearrangements could be the result of differences occurred during the maintenance of the CMS cytoplasm. We do not expect these differences to be associated with the CMS trait as the wild relative line is the maternal parent of the sterile line. The mitochondrial genome of ICPH 2433 was found to be closest in sequence to that of ICPA 2039, with no differences observed between these lines (Supplementary Fig. S13 and Supplementary Tables S6 and S7).3.7. Candidate CMS-associated chimeric ORFsThe CMS trait is often associated with chimeric ORFs that are the products of mitochondrial genome rearrangement,48 which can cause pollen abortion. In some crops, chimeric ORFs are found in sterile lines (e.g. A-line), but absent in fertile lines (e.g. B- and R-lines).13,14,39 A number of studies have confirmed the role of chimeric ORFs in male sterility by disrupting the function of ORFs by inserting or deleting a few base pairs (reviewed by Hanson and Bentolila).48 Many of the chimeric genes associated with CMS in other crops are found in the proximity of protein-coding genes and include regions encoding transmembrane domains and other parts of known mitochondrial genes.48–52 Hence, we set out to identify those chimeric ORFs, which most closely resemble these criteria by scanning around positions that have undergone rearrangements or which are absent from particular pigeonpea lines. Only ORFs >300 bp were considered, and were ranked as chimeric based on the presence of parts of other genes, proximity to known mitochondrial genes, and the presence of hydrophobic domains. A scoring systems ranging from 0 to 4 was assigned to each ORF (see Chimeric ORFs section of Materials and methods). As abnormal atp synthase genes are sometimes associated with CMS,49–52 ORFs containing parts of atp genes were more heavily weighted.Our study identifies 13 such potential CMS candidates in the pigeonpea male-sterile line ICPA 2039 (Table 3). Of these 13 potential candidates, five carry parts of other mitochondrial genes and eight were observed to be in the proximity of other mitochondrial genes. Liu et al.25 have hypothesized that a wheat K-type CMS line, Ks3, contains a chimeric ORF encoding partial subunits of several components of the respiratory chain complex, including, atp4, atp6, nad3, nad6, nad9, cox1, and cox3. These altered proteins may interfere with the normal function of respiratory chain reactions and cause pollen development to abort. Intriguingly, five of the candidates identified in our study incorporate parts of some of these genes including, atp1, nad4, rps4, nad5, and atp9. This presents the possibility of a similar mechanism in pigeonpea CMS as found in rice. Transmembrane domains are another prominent feature associated with CMS ORFs.53 Many of our candidate ORFs carry regions predicted to encode transmembrane domains, and a number of the encoded proteins have been shown to be associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane.48 Recently, Bentolila and Stefanov44 have identified a candidate for the wild abortive CMS in rice that has arisen via rearrangement, is chimeric in structure, possesses predicted transmembrane domains, as well as possess the promoter of a mitochondrial gene. Of our 13 candidates, 11 are predicted to carry such transmembrane domains. These novel ORFs may trigger CMS by damaging mitochondrial membrane structure such that the resulting permeability change affects mitochondrial function.48,54 Previous histological studies of CMS in pigeonpea have revealed that meiosis in both male-fertile and male-sterile plants proceeds normally up to the tetrad stage, and that during this period, the tapetum remains intact. Male sterility becomes manifest after this, with tetrads in male-sterile plants remaining enclosed within a persistent tetrad wall and subsequently undergoing vacuolation and abortion of pollen grains.55 Therefore, identifying the ORFs that are causative for CMS in pigeonpea will require the transcription and translation patterns of our unique ORF candidates to be determined, including in young to mature buds, floral parts including the pollen mother cell, tetrad, and pollen grains. The roles of transmembrane domains and respiration in the mitochondrial genome of ICPA 2039 will also need to be assessed. Future, structural and functional studies will allow the exact mitochondrial genomic segments responsible for male sterility in pigeonpea to be defined.

IntroductionMaize (Zea mays L.) is one of the most important food, feed, and industrial crops globally and a model system for the study of genetics, evolution, and domestication. The maize genome is large and complex. The estimated total size of genome draft is 2.3 Gb, with over 80% of repeated sequences of various types.1 The genetic variability in the maize genome can be utilized to enhance biotic and abiotic stress tolerance and to improve agronomic traits such as quality, maturity, and yield potential. Types of variation at the whole-genomic level include microsatellites or simple sequence repeats (SSRs), single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions and deletions (indels), and various types of structure variation.SSRs are tandemly repeated mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, and hexa-nucleotide sequence motifs flanked by unique sequences.2,3 The unique sequences bordering the SSR motifs provide templates for specific primers to amplify SSR alleles via polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and allelic differences are usually the result of variable numbers of repeat units within a microsatellite structure.4 A larger number of repeated units is generally related to greater genotypic variation, and the shorter motifs such as those with mono-, and di-nucleotides usually possess more repeats than longer motifs such as those with tetra-, penta-, and hexa-nucleotides. However, shorter motifs can produce more slipped-strand mispairing (stuttering) during PCR, which usually lead to genotyping errors.5,6 Based on the repetitive architecture, purity, and complexity of their motifs, SSRs can be classified as perfect (single motif in an uninterrupted array), imperfect, or compound (two or more motifs in interrupted or uninterrupted arrays). As we known, SSR loci with longer or perfect motifs can exhibit a higher level of allelic variability.5SSRs have been the genetic markers of choice, because they are easy to score, and have multiallelic nature, co-dominant inheritance, and clear advantages over restriction fragment length polymorphism and amplified fragment length polymorphism markers in terms of technical simplicity, throughput level and automation.7 Compared with SNP markers that are generally biallelic,8 SSR markers are more informative because it can detect multiple alleles per locus, so they are still commonly used nowadays.Thanks to the availability of whole-genome or transcriptome sequences in public databases and in the recent advent of bioinformatics tools, development of genetic markers including SSRs has become much easier and more cost-effective. Genetic markers can be obtained by screening genomic, cDNA sequences, or libraries of clones. To facilitate access to and utilization of SSR markers in Brachypodium, 27 329 SSR markers were successfully designed through genome-wide analysis, but only 398 SSR markers have been developed from its bacterial artificial chromosomes end and expressed sequence tag databases.9 The availability of the completed soybean whole-genome sequence also provided an ideal resource for the genome-wide development of locus-specific SSR markers, and 33 065 high-polymorphic SSRs were developed with the availability of their genome positions and primer sequences.10 Barchi et al.11 combined the recently developed a restriction site-associated DNA approach with Illumina DNA sequencing to rapidly discover a large number of SNP and SSR markers for eggplant. Huang et al.12 identified over 3.6 million SNPs by sequencing 517 rice landraces, which were used in genome-wide association studies for 14 agronomic traits. These results show that genetic markers such as SSRs and SNPs are abundant in different crop genomes and can be easily scored, making it more accessible to the breeders and geneticists.SSRs are abundant and well distributed throughout the maize genome, which can be employed as a preferred marker system. SSR markers have been utilized extensively in maize to characterize the genetic structure and diversity, to construct phylogenetic trees and to define potential heterotic groups, and to identify unique sources of allelic diversity.13–15 Furthermore, SSR markers have been widely used for genetic map construction, quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping, map-based cloning, and marker-assisted selection (MAS) because of their ubiquity and high level of polymorphism. Hence, enriching the current maize linkage maps with more SSR markers is of great value for the global maize molecular breeding.In recent years, many SSR markers have been developed and are publicly available (http://www.maizegdb.org/ssr.php) based on their target sequences among different maize germplasm accessions. However, a relatively low level of polymorphism was observed between cultivated maize and their relatives, and within populations derived from cultivated × teosinte and temperate × tropical maize crosses. The availability of the reference genome sequence and increasingly cost-effective sequencing facilities makes it possible to do whole-genome sequencing for more maize germplasm accessions. We used whole-genome sequence information from 3 typical tropical maize inbreds, 13 typical temperate maize inbreds from different heterotic groups, and 1 teosinte line, to analyse their genetic variation and to develop polymorphic molecular markers that can be used for high-resolution MAS, genomic selection, and QTL mapping. Using germplasm of diverse resources including teosinte and different types of maize lines, we can reveal and utilize unique alleles and loci better. Thus, the objectives of this study were to determine the abundance and characterization of SSRs in the maize genome and to use stringent screening to develop highly polymorphic SSR markers.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materialsSequence data were generated for 17 genotypes including 16 improved maize inbred lines and 1 wild relative, Z. mays ssp. mexicana (hereafter Z. mexicana), which were listed in Table 1. Among the 16 improved maize inbreds, CML411 and P1 from International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) and 81565 from China were chosen to represent tropical/subtropical germplasm, ES40 was derived from traditional Chinese landrace, and the remaining 12 temperate maize inbreds were chosen to represent different heterotic groups in Chinese temperate maize. Temperate maize lines 178, Huangzao4, Ye478, Zheng22, and B73 representing PB, SPT, PA, LRC, and BSSS heterotic groups, respectively, were widely used for commercial hybrid production. For marker validation, additional six teosinte species obtained from United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and four maize inbreds were also included (Table 1).

The chromosome number is 2n = 40 for Z. perennis and 2n = 20 for other species.2.2. Maize genome sequencesFor maize lines 81565, 18Red, 18White, 48-2, Dan598, ES40, RP125, and Z. mexicana, sequences were generated, and paired-end libraries were constructed according to the Illumina manufacturer's instructions. An average resequencing depth was 13× and genome coverage was 85% for maize inbreds. One teosinte species Mexican was sequenced with an average of resequencing depth of 9× and genome coverage of 74%. The genome sequences for the remaining maize lines were downloaded from the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database (SRA049859 and SRA051245) and NCBI GenBank (JQ886798–JQ887980). All sequence reads were aligned against the maize B73 reference genome (www.maizesequence.org Release 4a.53) using Short Oligonucleotide Alignment Program 2 (http://soap.genomics.org.cn/). Sequencing and reads mapping were carried out at Beijing Genomics Institute (Shenzhen, China).16–182.3. SSR identification and primer designSSR motifs were identified in 17 genomes using MISA (MIcroSAtellite identification tool) program downloaded from the Leibniz Institute of Plant Genetics and Crop Plant Research website (http://pgrc.ipk-gatersleben.de/misa/). Only perfect SSRs including mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, and hexa-nucleotide motifs with numbers of uninterrupted repeat units more than 10, 7, 6, 5, 4, and 4, respectively, were targeted. The 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions (UTR), protein coding sequence (CDS), intron, and intergenic regions were determined based on their original annotations of the maize B73 reference genome (www.maizesequence.org Release 4a.53). Promoter sequences were determined at 2 kb upstream of the transcription initiation site.Any SSR locus to be used to develop genetic markers should include a perfect repeat motif and two unique flanking sequences with 300 bp on each sides of the repeat. In our study, SSR candidate sequences were used for BLASTN search against the genome sequences (e-value cut-off of 1e-10), and filtered with >90% of identity and minimum alignment length with >85% of the flanking sequences. Those with unique hit, together with their specific flanking sequences, were identified as candidate SSR loci. Then, we wrote a Perl script to combine SSRs within 5 kb of different genomes with the same motif and to identify polymorphic SSR loci among 17 genotypes depending on the presence of motifs.The forward and reverse primers were designed based on unique flanking sequences using Primer 3 (http://primer3.sourceforge.net/). Input parameters for the primer design were as follows: minimum, maximum, and optimal sizes were 18, 27, and 20 nt; minimum and maximum GC were 20 and 80%; and minimum, maximum, and optimal Tm were 57, 63, and 60°C, respectively. The deviation of amplicon size of each SSR primer ranged from 30 to 500 bp based on the expected SSR sequence length.In addition, electronic polymerase chain reaction (e-PCR) programme (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/e-pcr/) was applied to check the uniqueness and specificity of designed primers in the genomes. The parameters were set as following: the word size was 9, the discontiguous word was 1, the maximal allowed deviation of hit product size was 100, the maximum mismatches allowed, and the maximum indels allowed were 1, respectively. On the other hand, the published SSR markers reposited in MaizeGDB (http://www.maizegdb.org/) were downloaded and amplified in silicon through e-PCR programme for further comparison.2.4. Experimental validation of polymorphic SSR markersTo assess the value of identified SSR markers, 151 primer pairs from 10 chromosomes including all types of SSR were chosen for experimental validation. The samples used in this experiment included 20 improved maize lines and 7 teosinte lines (Table 1). Genomic DNA was extracted from seedlings using the CTAB method. Primers were made by Shanghai DNA Biotechnologies Co., Ltd. PCR was performed in 25 µl reactions containing 2.5 µl buffer, 2.5 µl MgCl2 (25 mM), 4.0 µl dNTP (2.5 mM), 0.2 µl Taq polymerase (5 U/µl), 1 µl template DNA (100 ng/µl),13.8 µl ddH2O, and 0.1 µg primers. The PCR conditions were as follows: 1 cycle at 94°C for 5 min; 35 cycles at 94°C for 30 s, 60°C for 30 s, 72°C for 1 min, and 1 cycle at 72°C for 10 min. PCR products mixed with loading buffer were heated at 95°C for 5 min and quickly chilled on ice. The entire mixture was electrophoresed on 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel, and the genotype was scored after silver staining. The number of alleles was recorded and the polymorphism information content (PIC) was calculated as described by Smith et al.193. Results3.1. The abundance of SSRs in the maize genomeA large number of perfect SSRs with mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, and hexa-nucleotide motifs were identified, but the numbers varied among different genomes (Table 2). The average number of SSRs was 135 693 in 17 genotypes, ranging from 133 346 loci observed in mexicana to 136 723 loci in tropical/subtropical maize inbred 81565. Some reads from Z. mexicana could not be mapped onto the reference genome, which resulted in relatively lower genome coverage and thus, less SSRs identified compared with other maize inbreds. A total of 264 658 unique SSR loci were detected in 17 genomes, of which mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, and hexa-nucleotide SSRs were 153 231, 65 236, 25 910, 6572, 8839, and 4870, respectively. The mono-nucleotide motif is the most abundant, accounted for 57.90%. There were 38 971 common SSRs (15% of the total) observed to be the same across 17 genotypes. The SSR density was calculated based on the maize reference genome size of 2.1 Gb, and there was a little difference among 17 genotypes for each nucleotide motif, with an average interval of 15.48 kb between SSR loci for every genome. However, the average intervals for mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, and hexa-nucleotide SSRs were remarkably different, which were 26.93, 60.88, 150.95, 717.70, 505.05, and 942.55 kb, respectively (Table 2). SSRs were considerably abundant and distributed throughout the maize genome, with a small average marker interval (7.93 kb) for all detected loci. Numbers and density of SSR loci identified in 17 maize genomesMNR, DNR, TNR, TTR, PNR, and HNR indicate mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, and hexa-nucleotide SSRs.Numbers and density of SSR loci identified in 17 maize genomesMNR, DNR, TNR, TTR, PNR, and HNR indicate mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, and hexa-nucleotide SSRs.We also examined different SSR repeat types in the genome for all tested genotypes. The frequencies of different nucleotide repeat types in each motif were different, but they showed similar frequency patterns in different genomes. Here, we compared the frequencies of different SSR repeat types by taking the reference line B73 as an example (Table 3). Of mononucleotide motifs, C/G repeats accounted for ~54.4%, which was slightly higher than A/T repeats. Of the di-nucleotide motifs, (AT)n were most frequent (24.93%), followed by (AG/CT)n (24.36%), (TA)n (21.03%), and (GA/TC) (20.64%), while the (CG)n motif was least frequent (0.80%). Of the tri-nucleotide motifs, (CAG/CTG)n was the most abundant (15.86%), while other nucleotide repeat types had lower frequencies (0.4–6%). Of the tetra-nucleotide SSRs, (AAAT/ATTT)n, was most frequent (10.35%), and the frequencies for the rest nucleotide repeat types were all lower than 7%. There were many types of penta- and hexa-nucleotide SSRs, each with low frequencies, ranging from 0.04 to 4%. The numbers of mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, and hexa-nucleotide motifs in different repeat unit classes are also listed in Table 3. The average repeat lengths were different among various motifs ranging from 11.02 for (A/T)n to 58.84 for (AGT/ACT)n. Number of SSRs in different repeat classes in the maize genome B73SSR motifs with repeats number >100 in total were listed here.Number of SSRs in different repeat classes in the maize genome B73SSR motifs with repeats number >100 in total were listed here.3.2. Screening of SSR loci and development of maize SSR markersA total of 2034 SSR markers have been recently developed and reported on MaizeGDB website (www.maizegdb.org). Among the public markers, 1556 SSRs have genomic positions. Through e-PCR programme conducted in B73 genome, 827 SSR markers have specific amplicon, 60 SSR markers have more than one binding sites, and the remaining markers have no proper binding sites on the 10 chromosomes. Here, we developed a new database containing more SSR markers with unique flanking sequences. From the SSRs that could be detected (264 658) across 17 maize genomes, 189 087 (71.45%) of them were identified with unique flanking sequences with an average of 82 741.9 SSR loci for each genome (Table 4). The average numbers of SSR loci with different motifs for each genome were notably different, accounting for 55.19, 74.60, 48.09, 81.94, 80.69, and 68.94% of the total SSRs for mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, and hexa-nucleotide motifs, respectively (Table 4). It implies that over 80% of tetra- and penta- nucleotide motifs in the maize genome can be used to design SSR markers. A total of 25 437 SSRs with unique flanking sequences were found to be shared across 17 tested genomes, of which 9240 (36.33%) were polymorphic.

Primer pairs were then designed for the 188 571 SSR loci, with 13 344 (chromosome 10) to 29 779 (chromosome 1) SSRs on each chromosome, and 173 587 of them were polymorphic with length differences and present-absent variation in 17 genomes. E-PCR programme was further conducted to validate and refine the specificity of new designed SSR markers, and 111 887 primer pairs of them could bind as expected and the others were amplified with multiple binding sites or false match. Through comparing SSR sequences among 17 tested genomes, a new database was developed to include 111 887 SSR markers with specific physical positions, with proportion of 59% of the candidate SSR loci with specific flanking sequences (Table 5 and Supplementary Table S1). Among these markers, SSRs with mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, and hexa- nucleotide motifs accounted for 58.00, 26.09, 7.20, 3.00, 3.93, and 1.78%, respectively. A total of 35 573 SSR loci, accounting for 31.8% of the refined SSR markers, showed length polymorphism in the 17 tested genotypes. The PIC for these polymorphic SSRs varied from 0.05 to 0.83, with an average of 0.31 (Supplementary Table S1). SSR markers with mono- and di-nucleotide motifs showed higher levels of polymorphism (33.87 and 37.31%, respectively) than other SSR markers with tetra-, penta-, and hexa-nucleotide motifs (7.44–17.19%). Comparing with the SSR markers in MaizeGDB database, there were 18 606 SSR markers, accounting for 16.6% of the newly developed SSR markers, shared the same loci with the public SSR markers with various motifs. However, only 527 (0.47%) newly developed SSR markers had completely compatible position with public SSR primers. Additionally, the average SSR lengths and number of loci across 10 chromosomes were calculated for three SSR datasets, all SSRs, SSRs with unique flanking sequences, and polymorphic SSRs (Fig. 1). In each of the three SSR datasets, the numbers of loci gradually declined with the increase of SSR lengths, the same as shown in previous studies.20Numbers of candidate SSR markers, and polymorphic SSR markers detected in 17 maize lines and previously developed SSR in MaizeGDB databaseMNR, DNR, TNR, TTR, PNR, and HNR indicate mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, and hexa-nucleotide SSRs.Mono: monomorphism; poly: polymorphism; Chr: chromosome.aPercent of polymorphic SSR markers over all of candidate SSR markers in silicon analysis.Numbers of candidate SSR markers, and polymorphic SSR markers detected in 17 maize lines and previously developed SSR in MaizeGDB databaseMNR, DNR, TNR, TTR, PNR, and HNR indicate mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, and hexa-nucleotide SSRs.Mono: monomorphism; poly: polymorphism; Chr: chromosome.aPercent of polymorphic SSR markers over all of candidate SSR markers in silicon analysis.Distributions of 263,423 SSR loci (a) and 111,887 new developed SSR markers (b) with unique physical positions across 10 chromosomes in the B73 reference genome (www.maizesequence.org Release 4a.53).

Different colors represent levels of density of SSRs.3.3. Distribution of SSRs in different genomic regionsA total of 264 658 SSRs were detected in 17 genomes, and 263 423 loci of them have specific physical position. The distributions of 263 423 SSR loci and 111 887 newly developed SSR markers refined by e-PCR programme across 17 tested genomes were shown in Fig. 2 a and b , respectively. SSRs were unevenly distributed on chromosome regions, and there were much more loci located in near telomeric regions than near centromeres, which was accordance with the distribution patterns of genes in maize.21 Moreover, we compared SSR distributions across five genomic regions using tested genomes of P1, B73, and Z. mexicana to represent tropical, temperate, and wild maize germplasm, respectively (Table 6). SSR loci were most abundant in intergenic region and least frequent in UTR region. Polymorphism rate and GC content of SSRs in coding regions were higher than other genic regions. The distribution of SSRs in different genomic regionsThe distribution of SSRs in different genomic regionsCorrelation between SSR numbers and SSR lengths.Correlation between SSR numbers and SSR lengths.The average intervals between SSRs were the longest in intergenic regions, second in CDS regions, and smallest in promotors (Table 6). Distributions for the SSRs with unique flanking sequences and for the polymorphic SSRs across tested genomes also varied among the six genomic regions, but the trend was consistent with that for all the candidate SSR loci. This result is also in full agreement with a previous report in rice.22 In addition, SSR distribution was rather similar among the three representative genotypes.Furthermore, the repeat types of SSRs in CDS region of B73 were investigated. SSRs with tri-nucleotide repeats were the most (1832) among the six repeat types, with proportion of 71.8% in CDS region. The tri- and hexa-nucleotide SSRs that would not bring the frame shift accounted for 84.1% (2148) of the SSRs in CDS region. Therefore, only 15.9% of the SSRs in CDS region have potential threats to the gene structure.3.4. SSR markers validated for quality and polymorphismA total of 151 SSR markers were randomly chosen for experimental validation using 20 maize inbreds and 7 teosinte lines (Fig. 3 and Table 1). Of them, 121 primer pairs (80.1%) generated specific products and distinct bands, while 30 primer pairs failed to produce stable or clear bands due to the lack of sequence specificity in the genomic DNA samples. The majority of the 121 primer pairs (112 primer pairs) revealed high levels of allelic diversity in tested 27 lines, with PIC values of 0.074–0.796 (an average of 0.478). The 112 polymorphic SSR loci contained 329 alleles in total and an average of 2.94 alleles with a range of 2–5 (Supplementary Table S2). Experimental validation of six randomly selected SSR markers in 27 genotypes. Lanes 1–27 were PCR products of Zea perennis, Z. diploperennis, Z. mays ssp. parviglumis, Z. mays ssp. huehuetenangensis, Z. nicaraguensis, Z. luxurians, Z. mays ssp. mexicana, RP125, 18Red, 18White, CML206, 81565, A318, P1, Han21, CML85, CML411, Ye478, Mo17, Zheng22, 178, 48-2, B73, Lu9801, ES40, Huangzao4, and Dan598, respectively.Experimental validation of six randomly selected SSR markers in 27 genotypes. Lanes 1–27 were PCR products of Zea perennis, Z. diploperennis, Z. mays ssp. parviglumis, Z. mays ssp. huehuetenangensis, Z. nicaraguensis, Z. luxurians, Z. mays ssp. mexicana, RP125, 18Red, 18White, CML206, 81565, A318, P1, Han21, CML85, CML411, Ye478, Mo17, Zheng22, 178, 48-2, B73, Lu9801, ES40, Huangzao4, and Dan598, respectively.In addition, we made a detailed comparison of the allele number and PIC value in silicon analysis and in maker validation in 17 tested genotypes. Forty-one of the 121 primers possessed the practical alleles in accordance with the expected alleles, 38 primer pairs had more allele number, and 42 primer pairs had less allele number in silicon analysis than in maker validation (Supplementary Table S2). Additionally, comparing polymorphism in silicon analysis using 17 tested genomes and in maker validation using 27 genotypes, we found that 51 primer pairs showed more alleles and higher PIC values in validation experiment (Supplementary Table S2). Interestingly, 26 of 151 SSR markers with no polymorphism in silicon analysis showed more than one alleles in validation experiment. We also found that the length of PCR products in silicon analysis almost consist with those in marker validation (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). The results indicate that newly developed SSR markers are informative and useful, and 70% of the SSR markers in our database are valid and polymorphic.4. DiscussionSSRs are co-dominant, abundant, high polymorphic, and dispersed throughout plant genomes. Based on the survey across genomes, on average one SSR was found every 1.14 kb in Arabidopsis,23 3.6 kb in rice,22 4 kb in Brassica oleracea,24 4.5 kb in soybean,10 220 kb in sorghum,25 and 578 kb in wheat.26 In this study, average SSR density was one SSR every 15.48 kb. These may reflect real genetic differences existing among plant genomes at DNA level, and also the differences involved in sequencing methods and procedures. We used maize inbred B73 as the reference genome, some reads from maize wild relative, Z. mexicana, could not be mapped onto the reference, resulting in a relatively lower genome coverage and thus, less SSRs identified compared with other maize inbreds. Therefore, the number of SSR loci identified from Z. Mexicana may be underestimated.In general, a small difference in SSR distribution was found for different populations or ecotypes in the same species. For instance, a very similar SSR distribution was found between indica and japonica rice, and the SSR density (interval between two SSRs) varied from one SSR every 2.0–8.1 kb, which was higher in 5'-UTR (one SSR every 2.1 and 2.0 kb, respectively) but low in CDS regions (one SSR every 8.1 and 7.7 kb, respectively).22 Our study revealed a similar SSR distribution pattern across the tested temperate, tropical, and wild maize lines. However, SSRs are not evenly distributed in different genomic regions with much lower SSR density in CDS region than in UTR and intronic regions. Intriguingly, we found that majority of SSRs resided in CDS region were tri-nucleotide repeats, which was consistent with other report and implied the specific selection against frame shift mutations in coding regions.27 Comparing with rice genome, the average SSR length was approximately identical (16–17 bp), but the average GC content in maize SSR sequences was much higher (47%) than rice (27%). In the maize genome, the proportions of mono-, di-, and tri-nucleotide SSR motifs were ~60, 20, and 10%, respectively. Tetra-, penta-, and hexa-nucleotide SSR motifs were less abundant, together accounting for 10%, which was accordance with the report in rice.22 SSR densities for different motifs were also unbalanced and the average interval varied from 26 to 950 kb. Moreover, we found that C/G, AT, and CAG/CTG repeats were the most common for mono-, di-, and tri-nucleotide SSRs, respectively, in maize, while A/T, AG, and AGG/CCT repeats are the most common in rice.22 Meanwhile, AT repeats were also the most common dinucleotide motifs in sorghum.25Short-read data from next-generation sequencing technologies are now being generated across a range of research projects. The fidelity of this data can be affected by several factors, and mapping errors and gaps still exist to a certain extent.28 However, the availability of the maize genome sequence still affords us a simple and economical way to survey and identify markers, thus enabling us to develop more convenient molecular markers for breeding applications. Several sets of maize germplasm including temperate, tropical, and their wild relatives were resequenced using next-generation sequencing technology.18,29–31 There are two major advantages in using currently available data for the analysis of SSR distribution and marker development. The maize germplasms from different ecological regions and heterotic groups (PB, SPT, PA, LRC, and BSSS) are highly diverse and host rare and unique alleles, providing an opportunity of using these types of genetic variation in hybrid maize breeding. On the other hand, whole-genome sequence data provide an ideal resource and the most complete picture of genetic variation for developing high-density genetic markers.SSR markers of highly polymorphic among diverse germplasms provide some advantages in genetics and breeding applications. In spite of considerable efforts in developing molecular markers in maize, the number of SSRs publicly available is still limited. From >260 000 SSRs identified from 17 tested genomes, we detected 111 887 SSR loci with unique flanking sequence and single binding site through genome sequence blast and e-PCR analysis. These SSR loci can be developed as polymorphic markers in silico and public on the MaizeGDB database, which are ~60 times more than those deposited in the MaizeGDB database so far. A total of 1556 SSR markers from the MaizeGDB database have specific location, and 16.6% of the newly developed SSR markers shared the same loci with public SSR markers. For some of the public SSR markers, the amplicon size was too large and it contained several newly developed SSR primers with different motifs. Therefore, only 0.47% (527) of newly developed SSR markers had completely compatible position with public SSR markers. Another reason for a few common SSRs shared with the two datasets maybe the traditional method for SSR marker development was based on screening of small-insert or microsatellite-enriched genomic libraries by hybridization in different materials,32 which was different from our analyses based on B73 reference genome and other resequenced genomes. Furthermore, the second-generation sequencing was different from the Sanger sequencing, which also lead to the differences. The experimental validation also proved to detect more alleles than the expected in silicon analysis due to diverse materials used in the study, but some SSR loci with little length differences were also hard to distinguish. The average marker density for the newly developed dataset reached one SSR per 14.7 kb in the B73 reference genome, indicating that maize is a highly polymorphic species.33 The availability of abundant SSR markers allows dramatic improvement in the efficiency of marker-assisted selection and fine mapping of QTL regions.Previous studies have mainly focused on di-, tri-, and tetra-nucleotide SSRs, whereas mono-, penta-, and hexa-nucleotide SSRs have not drawn enough attention for marker development. We found that mono-nucleotide SSRs had much higher polymorphism rates than others, and penta- and hexa-nucleotide SSRs had relatively longer repeat units. Intron and UTR SSRs were more polymorphic than CDS SSRs due to low selective pressure in non-coding regions, which were consistent with previous reports.22,34–36 Experimental validation using 20 maize inbreds and 7 teosinte species showed that over 70% of the primer pairs could generate the target bands with length polymorphism, promising a great potential for the application of these SSR markers. In practice, it would be very powerful when they are used for genetic populations derived from various types of maize germplasm that were sampled for this study.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by the National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (2012AA101104) to Y.L. and Y.X., Sichuan Youth Science and Technology Foundation of China (2012JQ0003), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31101162) to Y.L.Supplementary data"

IntroductionSoybean [Glycine max (L.) Merrill] provides a major source of food and oil for human consumption, animal feed and bioenergy, and has capacity to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiosis.1–4 Soybean growth, productivity and seed quality are adversely affected by a wide range of environmental stresses, particularly drought which may reduce soybean yield by >40%.5,6 To cope with drought stress, plants activate a number of defence mechanisms, including the perception of stress signals and subsequent signal transduction, leading to the activation of various physiological and metabolic responses.7–10 Within the regulatory networks, various transcription factors (TFs) and cis-acting elements contained in stress-responsive promoters function as molecular switches for gene expression and terminal points of signal transduction in the regulatory processes. Increasing evidence suggests that TF-encoding genes have a great potential in genetic engineering of transgenic crops with stable yield under stress conditions.11–15The phytohormone auxin has been known to regulate various aspects of plant growth and development.16–21 Increasing evidence also suggests that auxin, either alone or together with other hormones, plays important roles in regulation of plant responses to environmental stimuli.22–27 Expression profilings have revealed that many auxin-responsive genes are responsive to various abiotic stressors.28–30 Later root development, which is one of the important drought-stress-related trait, was shown to be coordinately regulated by auxin, abscisic acid (ABA) and cytokinin through ABI4 (ABA INSENSITIVE 4) TF.31 Numerous genetic and biochemical studies in Arabidopsis have provided evidence that transcriptional regulation of auxin response genes are regulated by two large TF families, the auxin response factor (ARF) and the Aux/IAA families.32 In Arabidopsis, there are 23 ARFs most of which contain a conserved N-terminal DNA-binding domain (DBD), a variable middle transcriptional regulatory region (MR) and a carboxy-terminal dimerization domain (CTD).33,34 The DBD of ARFs specifically binds to the conserved auxin response element (AuxRE, TGTCTC) in promoter regions of primary or early auxin-responsive genes. The structure of the transcriptional regulatory region (TRR) of each ARF determines whether the ARF acts as an activator or repressor. Activation domain (AD) of ARFs is usually enriched in glutamine (Q), serine (S) and leucine (L), while repression domain (RD) is enriched in either S, L and proline (P); S, L and/or glycine (G) or S. The ARF CTD is modular with amino acid sequence related to domains III and IV in Aux/IAA proteins, making it function as a dimerization domain among the ARF CTDs or with several Aux/IAA proteins.32,35–37Given the importance of ARF TFs in diverse biological and physiological processes, and their potential applications for the development of improved stress-tolerant transgenic crop plants, the ARF TF families have been identified and characterized in a number of crop species, such as maize (Zea mays),38,39 rice (Oryza sativa),28,29,40 sorghum (Sorghum bicolor),30 tomato (Solanum lycopersicum)41 and Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa).42 The recent completion of genomic sequence of the model soybean cultivar Williams 82 (W82)43 has enabled the soybean community to perform gene discovery in soybean with the aim to identify potential candidate genes for the improvement of yield under adverse environmental stress via genetic engineering.44–49 In the present study, we carried out a genome-wide analysis of the soybean ARF family to identify all the putative GmARF TFs that were subsequently subjected to a phylogenetic analysis with their Arabidopsis counterparts to identify gene orthologs and clusters of orthologous groups, enabling functional prediction. We also performed a comprehensive expression analysis of all GmARF genes in various tissues using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) or the wealth of available expression data, which were generated either by high-throughput microarray analyses or by Illumina transcriptome sequencing. These data, in turn, provided important complementary information to assist in the elucidation of the functions of the GmARFs. Since we have strong interest in research on mechanisms of water stress responses in soybean, we used a time-course dehydration stress treatment and subsequent qRT-PCR analysis as a precise mechanism to analyse the root- and shoot-related expression of all identified GmARF genes under normal and dehydration stress conditions. The results of this systematic qRT-PCR analysis have ultimately enabled us to identify appropriate root- or shoot-related and/or dehydration-responsive GmARF candidate genes for further in planta functional analyses towards biotechnological applications for the improvement of drought tolerance in soybean.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant growth, treatments and collection of tissuesW82 seeds were germinated in 6-l pots containing vermiculite and were well watered and grown under greenhouse conditions (continuous 30°C temperature, photoperiod of 12 h/12 h, 80 µmol m–2 s–1 photon flux density and 60% relative humidity), as previously described.15,50 Subsequently, root and shoot tissues were separately collected from 12-day-old soybean plants [vegetative cotyledon (VC) stage with unrolled unifoliolate leaves] in three biological replicates for tissue-specific expression profiling of GmARF genes. For expression profiling of GmARF genes under dehydration stress, the dehydration treatment was carried out in a time-course experiment as essentially described by Le et al.48 Briefly, 12-day-old plants grown under well-watered conditions were carefully removed from pots and roots were gently washed to remove the soil. Subsequently, the plants were transferred onto a filter paper and allowed to dry for 0, 2 and 10 h. Root and shoot tissues were collected separately in three biological replicates and were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen until use.2.2. Identification of the GmARF members in soybeanAll GmARF TFs predicted in soybean were collected for manual analysis from various plant TF databases,34,51–53 and only those GmARFs containing full open reading frames (ORFs), as predicted by Glyma v1.1 (http://www.phytozome.net/soybean), were used for further analyses. Genes with threshold of =90% nucleotide sequence identity were considered as duplicated genes.54 Tandem duplicates were defined as duplicated genes located within 20 loci from each other.552.3. Phylogenetic analysisSequence alignments of all identified ARFs from Arabidopsis and soybean were performed with a gap open penalty of 10 and a gap extension penalty of 0.2 using ClustalW implemented on the MEGA 5 software.56,57 The alignments were subsequently visualized using GeneDoc (http://www.nrbsc.org/gfx/genedoc/) as presented in Supplementary Fig. S1. The sequence alignments were also used to construct the unrooted phylogenetic tree by the neighbor-joining method using MEGA 5. The confidence level of monophyletic groups was estimated using a bootstrap analysis of 10 000 replicates. Only bootstrap values >50% are displayed next to the branch nodes.2.4. Expression analyses of GmARF genes using microarray data and soybean Illumina expression dataFor tissue-specific expression analysis of GmARF genes, microarray-based expression data for 68 types of tissues and organs housed in Genevestigator (https://www.genevestigator.com/) were used.58 Illumina transcriptome sequencing data provided by Libault et al.59,60 were also used to evaluate the expression of GmARF genes in eight tissues: nodules of 35-day-old soybean plants (harvested after 32 days of inoculation of the 3-day-old plants), 14-day-old shoot apical meristem (SAM), flowers (reproductive R2 stage), green pods (R6 stage), 18-day-old trifoliate leaves, roots (V2 stage), root tips and root hairs of 3-day-old seedlings.For expression analysis of GmARF genes in soybean leaves at V6 and R2 stages under drought stress, which was imposed on the plants by withholding water from the pots until the volumetric soil moisture content reduced to <5%, microarray data recently published by Le et al.61 were used. At the V6 stage, soybean plants had six unrolled trifoliate leaves and seven nodes, while at R2 full bloom stage, open flowers were found on any of the top two nodes on the main stem.2.5. RNA isolation, DNaseI treatment and cDNA synthesisPlant tissue samples were ground in liquid nitrogen using a mortar and pestle. Total RNA was isolated using the TRIZOL reagent according to the manufacturer's supplied protocol (Invitrogen). RNA concentration and integrity were measured prior to DNase I digestion with the NanoDrop UV-Vis spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies). DNase I treatment and cDNA synthesis using Turbo DNA-free DNase I (Ambion) and the ReverTra Ace® qPCR RT Kit (Toyobo, Japan), respectively, were performed as previously described.622.6. qRT-PCR and statistical analysis of the dataPrimers for qRT-PCR were designed as previously described (Supplementary Table S1).49 Primer specificity was first confirmed by blasting each primer sequence against the soybean genome (Glyma v1.1).43 qRT-PCR reactions and data analyses were performed according to previously published methods.49 The 60s gene was used as a reference gene as recommended by Le et al.,62 and the delta-CT method was used to calculate the initial amount of target genes. When appropriate, Student's t-test (one-tail, unpaired, equal variance) was used to determine the statistical significance of the differential expression patterns between tissues and/or between treatments. Considering the biological significance of the differential expression in this study, we adopted a cut-off value of 3-fold for tissue-specific expression, and 2-fold (at least at one time point) when analysing stress induction or repression. The expression levels were designated as ‘tissue-specific,’ ‘induced’ or ‘repressed’ only if such differences met the above criteria and passed the Student's t-test.3. Results and discussion3.1. Identification of the GmARF members in soybeanCurrently, three databases, namely SoybeanTFDB,51 SoyDB53 and PlantTFDB,34 provide access to the TF repertoire of soybean, which was obtained by genome-wide analysis of the Glyma v1.0 model. Interestingly, each group provided different numbers of the putative GmARF TFs in their databases. SoyDB reported the highest number of putative GmARFs (101), while SoybeanTFDB and PlantTFDB predicted only 75 and 55 GmARFs, respectively. As an initial step, we collected the sequences for all of the putative GmARFs from the three databases for sequence comparison to make a list of all the GmARF proteins. Because the Glyma v.1.1 has been available to public since July 2012 and no update has been reported yet by any of the above-mentioned databases, we blasted each GmARF protein sequence against the Glyma v.1.1 proteome using blastp to identify putative all GmARF TFs that contain full ORFs by the Glyma1 v1.1 annotation. Thus, we were able to identify 51 GmARFs with annotated full ORF, and only these full-length (FL) GmARF TFs were used for further analyses. If Glyma v1.1 annotation predicted several splice variants for a given GmARF gene, all the alternative splice variants were carefully checked using soybean FL-cDNA information publicly available at http://rsoy.psc.riken.jp/. When FL-cDNA information is not available, splice variants that encode the longest ORFs were selected as representatives for subsequent sequence alignments. Supplementary Table S2 provided relevant information, including gene IDs as defined by the Glyma v1.1 model for each identified GmARF protein, lengths of amino acid sequences and corresponding available FL-cDNA accession numbers for all 51 GmARFs. A uniform nomenclature for all the GmARF genes identified in this work was adopted to facilitate scientific communication, taking into account the order of the chromosomes (Supplementary Table S2). Additionally, the cDNAs and protein sequences of all 51 GmARFs were also supplied in Supplementary Dataset 1 for convenient downloading and use.3.2. Chromosomal distribution, structural and phylogenetic analyses of the GmARFsTo gain an insight into the genome organization of the GmARF genes, the position of each GmARF gene was obtained from Gbrowse (http://www.phytozome.net/cgi-bin/gbrowse/soybean/). The GmARF genes were found to be distributed on every chromosome in soybean (Fig. 1A), and the relative location of each of the GmARFs was illustrated on their respective chromosome (Fig. 1B). Chromosomes VI, IX, X, XIX and XX contain the lowest number of the GmARFs with only one member on each chromosome (~ 2%), while chromosome XIII possesses the highest number of GmARFs with 7 of the 51 members (~13%) (Fig. 1A and B).

A typical ARF contains a DBD, which consists of a B3 subdomain and an auxin response (ARF) subdomain, a MR and a CTD.Next, we were interested in identifying duplicated genes, because they represent the source of genetic materials for studying evolution and diversification.63 Among 51 GmARF genes, we found 17 duplicates; each pair shares a =90% nucleotide sequence identity. On the basis of their physical localization, none of these duplicated pairs were found to be tandem duplicates as all pairs of the duplicated genes are located on different chromosomes (Fig. 1B). Evolutionary studies have suggested that the soybean genome experienced a tetraploidization event ~10–15 million years ago and subsequently went through extensive gene rearrangements and deletions to become diploidized.64,65 Since duplications resulting from whole-genome duplication events are largely retained,43 we can observe in soybean that multigene families, such as TF-encoding and hormone biosynthesis-related families,50,65,66 contain highly related genes, making functional redundancy; a phenomenon that is common in plants.The features and number of domains and subdomains present in the GmARF sequences provide useful information for the prediction of their functions.32 Protein sequence alignment of the GmARFs with their Arabidopsis counterparts confirmed that all the GmARFs have a typical ARF-type structure with a conserved DBD that consists of a plant-specific B3-type subdomain and an ARF subdomain required for efficient in vitro binding to the AuxRE (Fig. 1C; Supplementary Fig. S1). Among the 51 GmARFs, which could be classified into six groups (Groups a–f) based on their structure, nine GmARFs (08, 21, 23, 26, 29, 30, 35, 38 and 51; Groups d, e and f) contain an additional short segment of 12–44 residues within their DBD. As for the CTD, eight members (GmARF08, 16, 30, 32, 34, 38, 41 and 51; Groups c, e and f) lack the CTD and the remainings have the typical CTD with both III and IV subdomains. Comparing with the ARF members identified in other dicot plants, soybean (15.68%) and Arabidopsis (17.39%) have similar percentage of CTD-truncated ARFs, while B. rapa and tomato have a higher rate of CTD-truncated ARFs with 22.58 and 28.57%, respectively.32,41,42 With regard to the middle region (MR), of 51 GmARFs, 19 members contain the QSL-rich region (Group a), whereas the remaining GmARFs, except the GmARF51 (Group f), possess a TRR enriched in either SPL (Groups b and d), SLG (Group c) or S (Group e) (Fig. 1C; Supplementary Fig. S1). This difference in TRR signatures suggests that the GmARFs of the former group might act as an activator and those of the latter as repressors, respectively, based on the evidence accumulated from functional analyses of Arabidopsis ARFs.32 In addition, similar to the typical AtARFs, all the GmARFs contain a conserved putative monopartite nuclear localization signals (NLS) at the end of the DBD (Supplementary Fig. S1).66 This consensus monopartite NLS was also predicted in OsARFs of rice, which was recently shown to be able to direct the gene product into the nucleus by a synthetic green fluorescent protein fusion assay.40As a means to classify subgroups and to identify the evolutionary relationships between GmARFs and their Arabidopsis ARF counterparts (AtARFs), a phylogenetic analysis of GmARFs and AtARFs was performed. The unrooted phylogenetic tree was built from the alignment of the FL-amino acid sequences of 51 GmARFs and 23 AtARFs. As shown in Fig. 2, all GmARFs and AtARFs were classified into four major groups based on their phylogenetic relationship. Group I could be further divided into two subgroups: Ia and Ib. Groups Ia, II and III contained GmARFs and AtARFs with relatively high sequence similarity, suggesting that the members of these subgroups derived from common ancestors. In addition, Group II was consisted of the GmARFs that possess QSL-rich region, thereby they might act as activators. On the other hand, Groups Ia and III contained GmARFs with SPL- or SLG-rich region, suggesting that these GmARFs might have repression activity (Fig. 1C and 2).32 Interestingly, we found that Ib is a special subgroup containing only AtARFs, implying that these AtARFs were derived through a long-term evolution of Arabidopsis for Arabidopsis-specific functions (Fig. 2). It is worthy to notice that all the AtARFs of Group Ib are localized on only one chromosome (chromosome I). Group IV is a diverse group comprising GmARFs and AtARFs with variable MRs and CTDs. However, the GmARFs and AtARFs of Group IV have one common feature; they all contain the additional short segment of 12–44 residues within their DBD (Fig. 1C and 2).

The unrooted phylogenetic tree was constructed using the full ORFs of ARF proteins. The bar indicates the relative divergence of the sequences examined. Bootstrap values >50% are displayed next to the branch.Strong lines of evidence suggest that phylogenetic analysis enables functional prediction of various genes, including TF-encoding genes. For instance, phylogenetic analyses of the GmAP2_EREBP and GmNAC families of soybean and ONAC family of rice with their orthologs from other plant species, whose functions or stress-responsive expression patterns are known, resulted in a nearly perfect match between sequence conservation and functions or expression patterns.67,68,49 Thus, phylogenetic-based functional prediction might quickly allow us to select candidate genes with positive functions in drought-stress responses from large gene families, which could be subsequently prioritized for further in planta functional studies. In Arabidopsis, mutations in the paralogous AtARF01 and AtARF02 resulted in delayed leaf senescence and floral organ abscission.69,70 On the basis of our phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 2), the GmARF17, 27 and 44 and GmARF07, 12, 11 and 18, which are clustered with AtARF01 and AtARF02, respectively, might have similar functions to those of AtARF01 and AtARF02. These GmARFs might be selected as potential candidates for in-depth functional characterization with the aim to delay leaf senescence by genetic engineering, which in turn could enhance stress tolerance. Similarly, AtARF07 and AtARF19 were shown to play a positive role in regulation of lateral root development,71 which is an important stress-related root trait for plant biotechnology.5 Therefore, their closely homologous GmARF20, 31, 43 and 46 would gain a great attention of researchers who work to enhance this trait (Fig. 2).3.3. Analysis of expression patterns of GmARF genes in different tissues and organs under well-watered conditionsIn the next line of our study, we have interest in gaining knowledge about tissue-specific expression of the GmARFs, because it enables us to identify the genes that are involved in defining the precise nature of individual tissues. Plants with an extensive fibrous root system and/or longer taproot can adapt better to drought stress, as they can forage subsoil surface moisture and/or reach lower soil layers where water is more readily available. On the other hand, plants with moderate shoot growth can survive longer water deficit conditions by minimizing evaporative leaf surface area and consuming less water. An appropriate control of plant architecture by genetic engineering is a promising approach for the development of crop varieties with enhanced drought tolerance and productivity.5,23,72,73 Moreover, identification of tissue-specific genes, for instance root-specific genes, provides a resource of root-specific promoters for the improvement of drought tolerance by the enhancement of root growth.20,74Thus, as a means to identify GmARF candidate genes that could be potentially used for enhancing drought tolerance by altering plant architecture, specifically shoot and/or root growth, when overexpressed or repressed in transgenic plant systems, we determined expression profiles for all 51 GmARF genes in the roots and shoots of 12-day-old soybean seedlings using qRT-PCR. We could detect the transcript of all GmARF genes, whose expression levels were widely divergent. Based on their transcript abundance, 51 GmARF genes were classified into six groups (Fig. 3A–F), in which the highest/lowest expression ratios in roots (GmARF05 versus GmARF19) and shoots (GmARF12 versus GmARF19) were astonishingly huge with more than 490 309-fold and 165 905-fold, respectively. Using the criterion of 3-fold cut-off value, we found that, of 51 GmARFs, 11 genes were specifically expressed in roots, namely GmARF05 (Fig. 3A), GmARF09 (Fig. 3B), GmARF02, 18, 22, 27 and 49 (Fig. 3C), GmARF15, 28 and 33 (Fig. 3D) and GmARF32 (Fig. 3E). Seven of the 51 GmARF genes displayed 3-fold higher expression in shoots and the remaining 33 genes showed ubiquitous expression patterns in both root and shoot tissues of young soybean seedlings. Specifically, the shoot-specific genes were grouped in Groups C (GmARF35), D (GmARF25, 29, 34, 36 and 48) and E (GmARF 50) (Fig. 3). Additionally, GmARF33 and GmARF50 were found to be the most root- and shoot-specific genes. GmARF33 more preferably expressed in roots than in shoots of 12-day-old soybean seedlings with the root/shoot ratio of ~436-fold, whereas GmARF50 in shoots than in roots with the shoot/root ratio of about 100-fold.

Relative expression was calculated based on the expression level of the target gene versus the level of the 60s reference gene.Recently, Libault et al.59,60 reported a transcriptome atlas of soybean genes in eight tissues (nodules, roots, root hairs, root tips, leaves, flowers, green pods and SAM) using Illumina sequencing of soybean short transcripts. Thus, we also utilized these data to provide an overview about their expression patterns in these eight tissues. As shown in the heat map representation (Fig. 4), most of the GmARFs exhibited divergent expression profiles in the eight tissues examined. Based on their transcript abundance, the GmARFs could be classified into three major groups. Several genes displayed tissue-specific expression patterns; for instance, GmARF02 and 05 that exhibited root organ-specific expression patterns (Fig. 4), which is consistent with our qRT-PCR analysis (Fig. 3A and C). A number of GmARFs showed their highest transcript abundance in SAM and/or green pods, such as GmARF24, 34, 42, 19, 33 and 45. Collectively, these observations demonstrate that the GmARFs have diverse expression patterns as their Arabidopsis counterparts,32 suggesting that the functions of the GmARFs may be diversified in a similar manner as that of the AtARFs. It is worthy to mention that the duplicated gene pairs displayed similar expression profiles in the eight tissues examined although with different expression levels (Fig. 4). For instance, GmARF45 has very high transcript abundance in SAM, but its expression is almost negligible in other seven tissues examined (Fig. 4). Similarly, GmARF13—the most closely homologue of GmARF45 (Fig. 1B)—also specifically expressed in SAM. Other duplicated pairs, such as GmARF02 and 05 and GmARF11 and 18, also displayed very similar expression profiles in the eight examined tissues, suggesting that these duplications were very likely resulted from the whole-genome duplication events.

Elevated expression levels are indicated by increasing intensities of blue colour (saturated at 420) expressed in the normalized Illumina-Solexa read number.With the progress in microarray analyses of soybean at the whole-genome-wide level using Affymetrix Genechips, a huge amount of data are also available for the evaluation of expression of soybean genes in various tissues. These data were collected by Genevestigator’ developers, then analysed and housed on their database (https://www.genevestigator.com/).58 Taking the advantage of the availability of these data, we expanded our expression study to examine the specific expression of GmARF genes in all 68 tissues and organs of soybean. This data set allowed us to analyse the expression of 42 of 51 GmARFs in total. The heat map shown in (Supplementary Fig. S2) displays the expression patterns of these GmARF genes, which may provide the temporal and spatial evidence linking them to their in planta functions. The expression data showed a high variability in transcript abundance of the GmARF genes in various tissues and organs, strongly indicating the diversified functions of the GmARF TFs in plant growth and developments. Expression of all 42 GmARF genes was very low or not observed at all in flower organs examined, such as pollen and stamen. Additionally, the transcripts of a few genes, such as GmARF01, 06, 17, 46 and 49, could be detected only in several organs among the 68 organs analysed.The information obtained on tissue-specific expression of the GmARF genes can be used to address the combinatorial usage of GmARF TFs, allowing us to gain an insight into the transcriptional programme of different tissues which is under the control of the GmARFs. Combinations of specific GmARFs with other type(s) of TFs might also regulate tissue-specific downstream genes. Protein–protein interactions, such as specific homodimerizations and heterodimerizations, modular flexibility and post-transcriptional and post-translational modifications, which are known to play important roles in determination of the functions of the TFs,7,15,75–77 may also influence the functional specificity of the GmARFs. Analyses of these regulatory processes will enable us to elucidate the regulatory functions of the GmARF TFs in a comprehensive manner.3.4. Analysis of expression patterns of the GmARF genes in roots and shoots during dehydration stress using qRT-PCRWith ~4–7% of the genes encoding TFs in plant genome,33,34,51,52,78 the TFs have been shown to play important roles in the regulation of environmental stress responses, including drought stress.8,11,14,79 A growing body of evidence has demonstrated that auxin and the ARFs are implicated in drought-stress response,25–30 suggesting that the stress-responsive ARF genes may be used to enhance drought tolerance in plants via genetic engineering. As a means to identify dehydration-responsive GmARF genes that are potentially used for in-depth characterization and engineering of soybean cultivars with improved drought tolerance, we performed a systematic expression profiling of the GmARF genes prior to launching laborious in planta functional studies. All 51 identified GmARFs were subjected to a comprehensive qRT-PCR analysis to assess their dehydration-responsive expression in root and shoot tissues of 12-day-old soybean plants that had been dehydrated for 2 and 10 h. The evaluations of expression patterns in roots and shoots separately, rather than in whole plants, might provide helpful information on the mode of action of stress-responsive GmARF genes in these individual tissues.As shown in Figs 5 and 6, among 51 GmARFs 33 and 33 genes were found to be dehydration-responsive in shoots and/or roots of 12-day-old soybean seedlings. Specifically, with the criterion of 2-fold, a total of 25 and 8 GmARF genes were identified as up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively, in the shoots by dehydration (Fig. 5), whereas 5 and 28 genes as induced and repressed, respectively, in the roots by the same treatment (Fig. 6A and B). Additionally, GmARF33 and GmARF50 were the most induced genes by dehydration in shoots and roots, respectively, with >585- and 1320-fold inductions detected for GmARF33 and >15- and 30-fold increases in transcript levels observed for GmARF50, after 2 and 10 h of dehydration. Therefore, these two genes would be excellent candidates for further in planta studies in soybean. A Venn diagram analysis indicated that two (GmARF12 and 50) of the up-regulated and seven (GmARF20, 26, 34, 35, 41, 43 and 51) of the down-regulated genes identified in roots and shoots were overlapped (Fig. 6C). On the other hand, of 30 GmARF genes that were down-regulated in roots, 12 genes (GmARF09, 10, 15, 18, 21, 27, 28, 33, 37, 38, 44 and 49) were found to be up-regulated in shoots (Fig. 6C). Expression levels of the GmARF genes that did not respond to dehydration were not shown.

Differential expression analysis of the GmARF genes in drought-stressed V6 and R2 soybean leaves and dehydrated shoots and roots of young soybean seedlingsAs previously shown, dehydration stress altered the expression of many GmARF genes in roots and shoots of 12-day-old soybean seedlings. Recently, using the 66 K Affymetrix Soybean Array GeneChip, we have carried out genome-wide expression profiling of soybean leaves at V6 and R2 stages under drought stress.61 This microarray data set allowed us to assess the drought-responsive expression patterns of the GmARF genes in the leaves of mature soybean plants. Among 51 GmARFs, three (GmARF12, 29 and 51) genes were found to be up-regulated and nine (GmARF03, 20, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 36 and 41) genes down-regulated by >2-fold (q-value <0.05) in drought-stressed V6 and/or R2 leaves (Supplementary Table S3).Expression analysis of all 51GmARFs in dehydrated shoots and roots of 12-day-old soybean seedlings using qRT-PCR has found 33 and 33 GmARF genes up-regulated or down-regulated in dehydrated shoot and/or root tissues (Figs 5 and 6). Comparative expression analysis of the GmARF genes in drought-stressed V6 and R2 leaves and dehydrated shoot and root tissues of 12-day-old soybean seedlings revealed that the majority of the GmARF genes exhibited highly variable responsiveness to water stress in the tissues examined (Supplementary Fig. S3 and Supplementary Table S3), indicating that the GmARF TFs may have specific functions in different tissues at different developmental stages under stress conditions. For instance, expression of GmARF51 was induced in drought-stressed V6 leaves but strongly repressed in dehydrated roots and shoots of young soybean seedlings, whereas that of GmARF18 was repressed in roots but induced in shoots of soybean seedlings by dehydration treatment and relatively unchanged in V6 and R2 leaves under drought stress (Supplementary Fig. S3). We also observed that, even in the same leaf tissue, the responsiveness of several GmARF genes, such as that of GmARF03, 20 and 51, to drought treatment was different at V6 and R2 stages. Collectively, this comparative analysis suggests that the dynamics of water stress-responsive expression of the GmARF genes in soybean is complex. Water stress may trigger different stress-responsive gene expression in different tissues at the same developmental stage or in the same tissue at different developmental stages.3.6. ConclusionThe designed systematic characterization of the GmARF family in soybean has revealed key features in the structures of the GmARFs and in the relevant functions of this TF family in plant growth and development and drought-stress responses. The determination of expression patterns of the GmARFs genes in various tissues and organs will enable us to identify those ARF genes that are expressed in limited specific region or in temporally regulated fashion. Studies of chromosomal distribution and duplications of the GmARF genes have provided valuable insights on the evolutionary aspects of soybean genome. Given that auxin is critical for organogenesis and embryo development, there is no doubt that the GmARF genes have immense and diverse roles in the life of soybean plants. The results of a comprehensive expression analysis of all the identified GmARF genes under normal and water stress conditions in different tissues and organs of soybean plants will help orient directions of molecular genetic studies, leading to better understanding of the functions of the GmARF TFs in soybean and their future applications. Overall, this study has enabled us to select water stress-responsive GmARF genes with more confidence for further in planta studies with the ultimate goal of development of improved drought-tolerant soybean cultivars by genetic engineering.Supplementary DataSupplementary data are available atwww.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by a grant (no.

Although gene expression induced by nitrogen starvation is changed and other metabolites (such as GDP-mannose and citrate) accumulate under sigE overexpression, genetic engineering of this sigma factor altered the metabolic pathway from glycogen to PHB during nitrogen starvation.1. IntroductionCyanobacteria can utilize light energy via two photosystems. Carbon dioxide is fixed via the Calvin-Benson cycle, producing sugar phosphate, followed by production of metabolites including glycogen as a carbon and energy sources.1,2 Stored glycogen is oxidized by glycogen catabolic enzymes such as glycogen phosphorylases (encoded by glgP) or isoamylases (encoded by glgX) (Supplementary Fig. S1).3 Under heterotrophic conditions, the glucose (or glucose-phosphate) are degraded mainly through the oxidative pentose phosphate (OPP) pathway.4 Under mixotrophic conditions, glucose is degraded via glycolysis and CO2 is concomitantly fixed via the Calvin cycle, providing organic acids such as pyruvate.4 The pyruvate is used to biosynthesize organic acids (including amino acids), to generate reducing power, or to assist nitrogen assimilation through the tricarboxylic acid cycle. From previous studies, it is known that many sugar catabolic genes are activated by the sigma factor SigE in Synechocystis 6803.5Synechocystis genome contains nine sigma factors (SigA–I), and SigE belongs to Group 2 sigma factor that consists of four sigma factors (SigB–E).5 Overexpression of sigE enhances metabolite levels of acetyl-CoA and organic acids such as citrate,6 implying utilization of this sigma factor for metabolic engineering. The expression of sigE is increased by nitrogen depletion;7,8 however, the implication of SigE into metabolite profiling during nitrogen starvation have not been described.Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are a class of polyesters, stored by many bacteria as carbon and energy sources. PHAs have attracted industrial interest, because they are naturally biodegradable.9 PHAs, consisting of short-chain-length or medium-chain-length monomers, are the constituents of >150 identified hydroxyalkanoates.10,11 Several PHAs, such as poly[(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate] (PHB, a homopolymer of 3-hydroxybutyrate) and poly[(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate-co-(R)-3-hydroxyhexanoate] (a co-polymer of 3-hydroxybutyrate and 3-hydroxyhexanoate), are industrially produced today (for example, KANEKA Biopolymer AONILEX). PHA granules are subcellular complex, consisting of a polyester core, associated proteins such as PHA synthases, phasins, PHA depolymerases, and regulatory proteins.11–14 Life cycle assessment studies have suggested that using PHB in place of conventional petrochemical polymers (such as film products and disposable items) lowers environmental impacts.15 PHAs are potentially applicable to medical research such as surgical sutures, vein valves, and targeted drug delivery,12 though their expensive production remains a major obstacle to their universal development.PHAs, particularly PHB, accumulate in several cyanobacterial strains including Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (we herein designate this strain Synechocystis 6803).16 Levels of PHB in cyanobacteria increase under nitrogen or phosphorus starvation.17 Addition of external carbon sources such as acetate enhances PHB accumulation in Synechocystis 6803 and other cyanobacteria.18–20 The biosynthetic pathway of PHB in Synechocystis 6803 is currently well understood. Acetoacetyl-CoA is formed from two molecules of acetyl-CoA by the enzyme ß-ketothiolase (encoded by phaA). Then, d-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA is synthesized, catalysed by acetoacetyl-CoA reductase (encoded by phaB).20d-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA is also polymerized to PHB by a PHA synthase, comprising PhaC and PhaE.16 PHA synthase activity in cyanobacteria is up-regulated in the presence of acetyl phosphate.18 Reverse genetic analysis has revealed that a protein designated Sll0783, which is conserved among PHB-producing bacteria and which is expressed under nitrogen depletion stress, is essential for retaining PHA synthase activity during prolonged nitrogen starvation.21 Disruption of sll0461, encoding gamma-glutamyl phosphate reductase, or sll0565, encoding a hypothetical protein, increases PHB accumulation in standard growth media.22 Transcription levels of phaA, B, C, and E have been shown to increase following nitrogen depletion.8 Expression of all four genes peaks 6 h after nitrogen depletion, then gradually decreases, but remains above the nitrogen-replete levels for a minimum of 120 h.21 To date, transcriptional regulator(s) for controlling PHA biosynthetic gene expression have not been found in cyanobacteria. It is noteworthy that introducing external pha regulons into Synechocystis 6803 increases enzymatic activities of PHA synthases, but does not enhance PHB accumulation.19Here, we show that genetic engineering of sigE resulted in large change of sugar metabolism and increased PHB accumulation during nitrogen starvation, indicating that sigma factor is useful for metabolic engineering of cyanobacteria.2. Materials and methods2.1. Bacterial strains and culture conditionsThe glucose-tolerant (GT) strain of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (isolated by Williams)23 and the sigE-overexpressing strain GOX50 were grown in modified BG-11 medium; that is, BG-110 liquid medium containing 5 mM NH4Cl (buffered with 20 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid - potassium hydroxide-KOH, pH 7.8). Liquid cultures were bubbled with 1% (v/v) CO2 in air, at 30°C under continuous white light (around 50–70µmol photons m–2 s–1).24 The sigE-overexpressing strain was generated in a GT background, as described previously.6 Growth and cell densities were measured at A730 with a Hitachi U-3310 spectrophotometer. In our experimental condition, A730 = 1.0 corresponds to 6.9 µg/ml chlorophyll a.2.2. RNA isolation and quantitative real-time PCRPre-cultured cells were diluted to A730 = 0.2 in 70 ml BG-110 medium supplemented with 5 mM NH4Cl. Cells were collected by filtration after 1 day of cultivation and re-suspended in BG-110 medium, followed by cultivation for 2 or 4 h. RNA isolation and quantitative real-time PCR were performed, as previously described25 using primers listed in Supplementary Table S1. The expression level of rnpB (encoding RNaseP subunit B) was used as an internal standard as previously described.212.3. Purification of GST-tagged PhaA, B, C, and EThe regions of the Synechocystis 6803 genome encoding phaA, B, C, and E were amplified by PCR using relevant primers (Supplementary Table S1). The amplified DNA fragments were digested with EcoRI and SalI, and inserted into the EcoRI–XhoI sites of pGEX5X-1 (GE Healthcare Japan, Tokyo, Japan) using the Mighty Mix ligation reagent kit (Takara Bio., Shiga, Japan). Purification was performed as described previously (Supplementary Fig. S2).262.4. Glycogen measurementPre-cultured cells were diluted to A730 = 0.2 in 70 ml BG-110 medium supplemented with 5 mM NH4Cl. Cells were collected by filtration after 1 day of cultivation and re-suspended in BG-110 medium, followed by cultivation for 1 or 3 days. Glycogen levels were quantified as described previously.252.5. Production of antisera and immunoblottingWe have previously produced antisera against glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD), GlgX(slr0237), GlgX(slr1857), and GlgP(sll1356).6 To make antisera against PHA biosynthetic enzymes, glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-PhaB and GST-PhaE were injected into rabbits, whereas GST-PhaC was injected into a rat [procedures were performed by Tampaku Seisei Kogyo Co. Ltd, (Gunma, Japan)]. Antisera against GlgP(slr1367) and PhaA were produced by injecting peptides NH2-EIIHNEKNQPK-COOH or NH2-CDGLTDSTNGEGMGEQ-COOH, respectively, into rabbits. Pre-cultured cells were diluted to A730 = 0.2 in 70 ml BG-110 medium supplemented with 5 mM NH4Cl. Cells were collected by filtration after 1 day of cultivation and re-suspended in BG-110 medium, followed by cultivation for 1 or 3 days. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously.252.6. Analysis of G6PD and 6PGD activitiesCells were similarly cultivated with immunoblotting. G6PD and 6PGD activities were measured as described previously.6 One unit of G6PD or 6PGD activity was defined as the formation of 1µmol NADPH per minute under the specified experimental conditions.2.7. Extraction and purification of PHAsPre-cultured cells were diluted to A730 = 0.2 in 70 ml BG-110 medium supplemented with 3 or 5 mM NH4Cl. For first experiment, cells grown with 3 mM NH4Cl were cultured for 9 days (nitrogen sources were naturally exhausted). For second experiment, cells grown with 5 mM NH4Cl were collected by filtration after 1 day of cultivation and re-suspended in BG-110 medium, followed by cultivation for 3 days. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 18 000 × g for 2 min. Cells were freeze-dried with FDU-2200 (EYELA, Tokyo, Japan) at -80°C for 3 days. Freeze-dried cell weights were determined by weighing on an electronic balance. Cells from a single sample from each of the 140 or 280 ml cultures were used for PHA extraction for the first or second experiment, respectively. Each 100–150 mg freeze-dried cells were suspended in 7 ml chloroform in a 12-ml glass tube and disrupted by sonication for 80 s (VC-750 sonicator, EYELA). The suspension was incubated at 70°C for 4 days with additional sonication (four times during 4 days). The suspension was cooled to room temperature and filtrated with a mixed cellulose ester filter paper (Advantec, Tokyo, Japan). The filtrates were heated to 70°C and concentrated to 1 ml, followed by cooling to room temperature. Ten millilitres of hexane was added to the filtrates; the mixtures were then incubated overnight at room temperature. After centrifugation at 1000 × g for 30min, supernatants were discarded and the residual pellets were re-suspended in hexane, followed by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 30 min. Pellets were completely dried at 50°C and re-dissolved in 1 ml of chloroform at 70°C. Then, 10 ml of methanol was added and the suspensions were mixed by shaking and incubated overnight at room temperature. The PHA precipitates were collected in a 1.5-ml tube by centrifugation at 20 500 × g for 5 min, followed by drying in a vacuum evaporator at 65°C. The residual PHAs were weighed on an electronic balance as PHA amounts and preserved for gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis.2.8. Analysis of purified PHAs with GPC and NMRGPC and NMR analyses were performed as described previously.27 The purified PHAs were subjected to GPC using the Shimadzu LC-10A GPC system (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) with a Shodex K-806 column (Showa Denko, Tokyo, Japan) at 40°C. Chloroform was used as mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. Polystyrene was used as the standard in molecular weight determination. Co-polymer compositions of purified PHAs were detected by NMR spectroscopy (JNM-Excalibur270; JEOL, Ltd, Tokyo, Japan). Each polymer was dissolved in 0.75 ml of CDCl3 and subjected to 1H NMR analysis. NMR spectra were recorded using an Excalibur270 spectrometer. Spectral inputs were 4.8-µs pulse width, 3.9-s pulse repetition, 5400-Hz spectra width, 16-K data points at 23°C, and 128 accumulations. Tetramethylsilane was used as an internal chemical shift standard.2.9. Capillary electrophoresis–mass spectrometry analysisCapillary electrophoresis–mass spectrometry analysis (CE–MS) was performed as previously described.6 The CE–MS system and conditions were as previously described.282.10. Statistical analysisAll statistical analyses were performed using the StatPlus:macLE software for MacOSX (Analyst Soft, Alexandria, VA, USA). P-values were determined using paired two-tailed t-tests. A 95% confidence interval was used to determine significance. The P-values are listed in Supplementary Table S2.3. Results3.1. Changes in levels of sugar catabolic enzymes during nitrogen starvationGlycogen is degraded by isoamylase (glgX) and glycogen phosphorylase (glgP). Synechocystis genome contains two glgX genes (slr0237 and slr1857) and two glgP genes (sll1356 and slr1367).6 Previous transcriptome analysis revealed that the mRNA levels of genes for glycogen catabolism, the OPP pathway, and PHA biosynthesis increased during nitrogen starvation.8 The mRNA levels of two PHA biosynthetic genes (phaC and phaE), two glycogen catabolic genes (glgX(slr0237) and glgP(sll1356)), and four OPP pathway genes (zwf, opcA, gnd, and tal) in the sigE overexpression strain (designated GOX50) exceeded those of the parental wild type (GT) under nitrogen-replete conditions (Fig. 1). In the GT strain, the expression of all 12 genes increased under nitrogen depletion within 4 h (Fig. 1). In the sigE overexpression strain, most of these genes were less increased by nitrogen depletion, compared with the GT strain (Fig. 1). The mRNA levels of phaA, phaB, and glgP(slr1367) alone were elevated (relative to nitrogen-replete conditions) after 4 h of nitrogen depletion (Fig. 1). The induction of nitrogen-related genes such as glnB (encoding a nitrogen sensor PII protein) and amt1 (encoding an ammonium transporter) were also less induced by sigE overexpression (Supplementary Fig. S3).

Consistent with the previous study,6 glycogen amount was reduced by sigE overexpression under nitrogen-replete conditions (Fig. 2A). During nitrogen starvation, however, glycogen similarly increased in the two strains (Fig. 2A). Levels of three glycogen catabolic enzymes, such as GlgX(slr0237), GlgX(slr1857), and GlgP(sll1356), increased under nitrogen depletion in the GT strain (Fig. 2B). Overexpression of sigE enhanced the levels of GlgX(slr0237), GlgP(sll1356), and GlgP(slr1367) under nitrogen-replete conditions (Fig. 2B). During prolonged nitrogen starvation, levels of GlgX(slr0237), GlgP(sll1356), and GlgP(slr1367) in the sigE overexpression strain remained higher than in the GT strain, although levels of GlgX(slr1857) were diminished (Fig. 2B).

The enzymatic activities of both G6PD and 6PGD also increased under sigE overexpression in nitrogen-replete conditions (Fig. 3B). The enzymatic activities of 6PGD in the sigE overexpression strain remained higher for at least 3 days of nitrogen depletion, although the G6PD activities were similar between the two strains under these conditions (Fig. 3B).

PhaA levels in the sigE overexpression strain remained higher than those in the GT after 3 days of nitrogen depletion, although PhaB levels were similar between the two strains (Fig. 4A).

Since PHA synthase (comprising subunits PhaC and PhaE) is integrated into the PHB granule in other bacteria, we also measured the proteins levels of PhaC and PhaE within the insoluble factions of the cell. Under nitrogen-replete conditions, PhaC and PhaE proteins were not detected for both GT and sigE overexpression strains within insoluble fractions (Fig. 4B). During prolonged nitrogen starvation, however, PhaC and PhaE were detected in the insoluble factions at elevated levels in both strains (Fig. 4B).3.3. sigE overexpression during nitrogen starvation enhances PHB levels (revealed by PHA analysis)Cells were cultured for 9 days in liquid medium supplemented with 3 mM NH4Cl. The colour of cell cultures turned from green to yellow during cultivation, indicating nitrogen sources were naturally exhausted (data not shown). The dried cell weight of the sigE overexpression strain exceeded that of the GT strain (data not shown). Within the same culture volume, PHA levels increased more in the sigE overexpression strain than in the GT strain (Fig. 5A). PHA contents per dried cell weight also increased by 2.3 times by sigE overexpression (Fig. 5A). PHAs were also extracted from the cells transferred into BG-110 medium by filtration and cultivated for 3 days, whose condition is same as immunoblotting. PHA contents elevated by 2–3 times by sigE overexpression (Fig. 5B).

PHA weight per 100 ml culture (left) and per 100 mg dried cell weight (right).The purified PHAs (cultured in BG-110 supplemented with 3 mM NH4Cl) were analysed by GPC and NMR. The number-average molecular weights and weight-average molecular weights (designated as Mn and Mw, respectively) of the PHAs were similar in the GT and sigE overexpression strains (Mn was ~135 kDa and Mw was ~190 kDa). The polydispersity indices of the purified PHAs from GT and the sigE overexpression strain were 1.4 ± 0.03 and 1.4 ± 0.08, respectively. Structures of the extracted PHAs were subsequently revealed by NMR as described previously.29 The NMR spectra of both strains were similar, demonstrating that, among the range of existing PHAs, both strains only produce PHB (Supplementary Fig. S4).3.4. The metabolite levels related to sugar catabolismCE–MS analysis was performed on cells grown in nitrogen-replete or -depleted conditions. Eighty-four peaks in the spectrum were attributable to known metabolites (Supplementary Table S3). Levels of sugar-phosphate metabolites, such as gluconate, glucose-1-phosphate/galactose-1-phosphate, and glucose-6-phosphate/fructose-6-phosphate/mannose-6-phosphate, in the sigE overexpression strain were higher than those in the GT strain after 1 day of nitrogen depletion (Fig. 6). Citrate levels increased in the sigE overexpression strain under both conditions (Fig. 6). sigE overexpression in nitrogen-replete media enhanced the production of nucleotide sugars, such as UDP-galactose and GDP-mannose (Fig. 6).

DiscussionIn this study, metabolome analysis revealed that sigE overexpression modified the metabolism from glycogen to PHB during nitrogen starvation in Synechocystis 6803 (Supplementary Fig. S5). Genetically engineered Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 containing PHB biosynthetic enzymes of Alcaligenes eutrophus accumulates 25% PHB of cellular dry weight under 2-week cultivation in nitrogen-limited conditions with 10 mM acetate.30 However, direct use of CO2 is desirable from an environmental point of view. In the conditions of our experiments, cells grown photoautotrophically and supplied with 1% (v/v) CO2 accumulate up to 1.4% PHB per cellular dry weight (Fig. 5). In a recent study, genetically engineered microalgae Phaeodactylum tricomutum, in which the bacterial PHB pathway of Cupriavidus necator had been incorporated, accumulated up to 10.6% PHB per algal dry weight after 7 days of nitrogen depletion.31 These results, supplementary to ours, suggest that genetically engineered microalga and cyanobacteria are useful for PHB production. The molecular weight and monomer units of PHB are unaltered by sigE overexpression (Supplementary Fig. S4). In general, increased PHA synthase activity decreases the molecular weight of PHA.32 However, the molecular weight of PHB in sigE-overexpressing strain kept similar with that of GT strain, indicating that carbon supply for PHB biosynthesis is enough due to activation of the sugar catabolism by sigE overexpression. Type-III PHA synthase, which produces short-chain-length PHAs (including PHB), is present in most of the cyanobacteria,33 rendering our NMR results consistent with those of previous studies. Obtaining a range of polyesters, such as other PHAs or polythioesters, is the next goal in cyanobacterial PHA production.In Synechocystis 6803, PHA biosynthetic genes and sugar catabolic genes are co-regulated by SigE, showing that the pathway from glycogen to PHB is regulated at the transcription level (Supplementary Fig. S5). The transcripts of PHA biosynthetic genes peak 6 h after nitrogen starvation, while PHB synthase activity peaks at 48 h after nitrogen depletion.21 PHB continuously increases at least 120 h,21 indicating translational and post-translational regulation of PHA biosynthetic enzymes. In this way, elucidation of the regulatory mechanism of enzymes in PHA biosynthesis and sugar catabolism is important for PHB production in cyanobacteria. The glycogen levels were similar between the GT and sigE overexpression strains after nitrogen starvation (Fig. 2A), indicating that the increase in PHB and the decrease in glycogen are not correlated. We also found that the mRNA of phaABCE were less induced by sigE overexpression (Fig. 1), however, the proteins of PhaABCE were similarly increased in the sigE overexpression strain after nitrogen depletion (Fig. 4). These results suggested that PhaABCE proteins are post-transcriptionally regulated in Synechocystis 6803. In terms of four glycogen catabolic genes (glgX(slr0237), glgX (slr1857), glgP(sll1356), and glgP(slr1367)), the mRNA and protein levels are also not correlated (Fig. 1 and 2), indicating post-transcriptional regulation of these glycogen catabolic enzymes.Metabolome analysis suggests that amounts of GDP-mannose and citrate also increased by sigE overexpression; thus, reducing the metabolic fluxes of these compounds by genetic modification may further enhance PHB production (Supplementary Fig. S5). In other bacteria, repression of lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis leads to elevated PHB synthesis in C. necator.34 In addition, multiple regulators are involved in transcriptional control under nitrogen-limited conditions.35In vitro studies have shown that Group 1 sigma factor (SigA in Synechocystis 6803) possesses stronger transcriptional activity than the Group 2 sigma factors, irrespective of promoter sequences.36 Overexpression of sigE regulates not only sugar catabolic and PHA biosynthetic genes, but also nitrogen-related genes (Supplementary Fig. S3), suggesting that nitrogen-starvation-induced transcriptional activation depends on the correct balance of transcriptional regulators. Our results also suggest that manipulating multiple transcriptional regulators is important for optimizing PHB production in cyanobacteria.Supplementary DataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.This work was supported by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology, Japan, a Grant-in-Aid for T.O. of PRESTO (Project name ‘Production of cyanobacterial bioplastics by the metabolic engineering with modified carbon dynamics’) from the Japan Science and Technology Agency, and by a Grant-in-Aid for M.H. of CREST (Project name ‘Elucidation of Amino Acid Metabolism in Plants based on Integrated Omics Analyses’).Supplementary data"

The molecular mechanisms responsible for this pattern remain an open question.1. IntroductionDNA methylation is the most studied epigenetic modification that occurs in all prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, with rare exception for yeast, roundworm, and fruit fly.1 In mammals, it is a post-replication modification in which a methyl group is covalently added to the 5-position of cytosines [5-methylcytosine (5mC)] that are part of symmetrical C-phosphate-G (CpG) dinucleotides. In plant genomes, DNA methylation can occur either symmetrically at cytosines in both CG and CHG (H = A, T, or C) contexts, or asymmetrically in a CHH context.2 On the contrary, non-CpG methylation in mammals is quite a rare event, although it has been recently described in embryonic stem cells,3,4 adult mouse brain,5 mouse germ cells,6,7 and in promoter regions of different genes.8–10 Both CpG and non-CpG methylation are determined and maintained by a family of conserved DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs).11–14 It has been widely demonstrated that CpG methylation status influences chromatin structure, thus regulating the accessibility of transcription factors to their DNA target sequences.15–17 Conversely, the biological significance of non-CpG methylation is currently unknown.The detection of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) residues in different tissues18,19 and cells20 (mainly neurons, brain and embryonic stem cells) has recently been reported. 5hmC is generated through oxidation of 5mC by the TET family of methylcytosine dioxygenases.21–23 However, a role in 5hmC production was recently also ascribed to DNMT enzymes,24 suggesting that this species may not be exclusively considered an intermediate of the 5mC demethylation process, but also an important epigenetic marker regulating the pluripotency of stem cells, cellular development, aging, and carcinogenesis.25Previous studies have reported the complete absence of 5mC in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from Paramecium aurelia,26Xenopus leavis,27Neurospora crassa, and other species,28 mainly based on the identical restriction patterns obtained with the methyl-sensitive isoschizomers, HpaII and MspI. More recently, the lack of 5mC residues was confirmed by Maekawa et al. 29 by analysing cancer cell lines and tissues from patients with gastric and colorectal cancer. Conversely, different amounts of 5mC were observed in mtDNA of many other organisms, such as humans,30 mice,31 hamsters,32 and plants,33 although the distribution of the methylated cytosines has not been determined in any of these species. More recently, a mtDNA–protein interaction study suggested that this genome may be methylated and DNMTs artificially targeting the mitochondria have access to different sites on the mtDNA depending on the levels of protein occupancy.34 Finally, Shock et al.35 demonstrated an enrichment of mtDNA sequences by immunoprecipitation against 5mC and 5hmC and the translocation of DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) into the mitochondria.The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of methylated residues of cytosines within mtDNA. In particular, the methylation status of the mtDNA control region (D-loop) was analysed both in blood DNA collected from human subjects and in DNA from cultured cells by bisulphite sequencing and, consecutively, by methylated/hydroxymethylated DNA immunoprecipitation assays. We focused on the above region because it is the control region of the mtDNA, it contains the main regulatory elements for its replication and expression and it is the most rapidly evolving region of this genome.36 The same analysis was also applied to DNA samples extracted from mouse blood and fibroblast cells. In addition, immunoblotting analyses were carried out to identify which of the three DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferases (DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B) and tet methylcytosine dioxygenases (TET1, TET2, and TET3) were located within the mitochondria. Finally, the potential role of the DNMTs in determining D-loop methylation status was investigated by applying the bisulphite sequencing procedure to DNA samples from wild-type (wt) and Dnmt1-/-, Dnmt3a-/-, and Dnmt3b-/- mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Population sampleA total of 30 unrelated adult subjects (14 men and 16 women), 41–102 years old, participated to the present study. The Ethics committee of the University of Calabria approved the recruitment and the use of the information gathered, as well as the use of the biological specimens collected on 9th September 2004. All subjects lived in Calabria (South of Italy) and their origin in the area was ascertained up to the grandparents' generation. Health status was ascertained by medical visit and at that time peripheral blood samples were also obtained. Before the interview, each subject provided informed consent to permit her/his phenotypic and genetic data to be used anonymously for genetic studies.2.2. Cell culturesHuman skin fibroblasts, HeLa, osteosarcoma 143B.TK-, and murine 3T3-L1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) containing 4.5 g/l glucose and 110 µg/ml pyruvate, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen) and 50 µg/ml gentamycin (Invitrogen). The Rho0 cell line, obtained by culturing 143B.TK- in routine growth medium containing 50 ng/ml ethidium bromide with regular replenishment of medium for about 2 months, was maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 0.2 mM uridine (Sigma).Wt and Dnmt1-/-, Dnmt3a-/-, and Dnmt3b-/- triple knock-out (TKO) mouse ES cells were grown in gelatinized culture dishes without feeder cells as reported by Tsumura et al.37Cells were cultured in a water-humidified incubator at 37°C in 5% CO2/95% air.2.3. DNA samplesSix millilitres of venous blood were drawn from each subject. Plasma/sera were used for routine laboratory analyses, while DNA was extracted from blood buffy coats following standard procedures.DNA samples from human skin fibroblasts, HeLa, osteosarcoma 143B.TK-, Rho0, and murine 3T3-L1 cells were obtained by phenol/chloroform purification, while DNA samples from wt and Dnmt1-/-, Dnmt3a-/-, and Dnmt3b-/- (TKO) mouse ES cells37 were extracted by the Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega).Mouse genomic DNA, isolated from whole blood of disease-free mice, was purchased from Promega Corporation.2.4. Bisulphite treatmentBisulphite conversion of each DNA sample was performed by using the EZ DNA Methylation-Direct Kit (Zymo Research), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 1 µg of genomic DNA, previously incubated for 20 min at 50°C in proteinase K and purified by centrifugation, was added to 130 µl of CT Conversion Reagent in a final volume of 150 µl. The mix was incubated at 98°C for 10 min and, successively, at 64°C for 3.5 h. After adding 600 µl of M-Binding Buffer into a Zymo-Spin IC Column, each sample was loaded into the column and centrifuged at 16 000 g for 30 s. After adding 100 µl of M-Wash Buffer to the columns and a centrifugation at 16 000 g for 30 s, 200 µl of M-Desulphonation Buffer were added to the columns and incubated at room temperature (RT) for 20 min. Then, the solution was removed by centrifugation at 16 000 g for 30 s and the columns were washed twice with 200 µl of M-Wash Buffer. Deaminated DNA was eluted in 10 µl of M-Elution Buffer.To ensure that cytosine conversion was complete, alternative bisulphite modifications were performed by using the EZ DNA Methylation-Gold Kit (Zymo Research), and the Qiagen's EpiTect Bisulfite Kit according to the manufacturer's protocol.For each procedure of bisulphite treatment, unconverted primers randomly covering the entire mtDNA molecule, including those used for the D-loop analysis, were used in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reactions, as negative controls.2.5. Primer design for PCR reactionsSix and four sub-regions, covering the entire D-loop of humans (nt 16 024-576) and mice (nt 15 423–16 299), respectively, were isolated by PCR carried out on each bisulphite-converted DNA sample. In particular, as DNA strands are no longer complementary after sodium bisulphite treatment, we designed primers specifically amplifying the top (Light) and bottom (Heavy) strands of the bisulphite-converted DNA (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). Moreover, some precautions were taken for primer design: (i) cytosines in forward primers and guanines in the reverse primers were replaced with thymines and adenines, respectively; (ii) cytosines within CpG sites were avoided; (iii) when possible, DNA regions characterized by low polymorphism content were preferred; (iv) short size of the amplicons was defined (range: 150–350 bp); (v) a 10-bp tag was added to the 5'- ends of some primers in order to increase the annealing temperature of the A–T enriched primer sequences. In addition, specificity for mtDNA target sequences of designed primers was tested on DNA extracted from osteosarcoma 143B.TK- Rho0 cells, completely lacking of mtDNA.2.6. Bisulphite sequencingThe PCR mixture (20 µl) contained 2 µl of bisulphite-treated DNA, Reaction Buffer 1×, TaqMaster PC Enhancer 1×, 0.5 µM of each primer, 0.2 mM dNTP mix (Promega), and 0.05 U of PCR enzyme (5'). The thermal profile used for the reaction included a 4-min heat activation of the enzyme at 95°C, followed by 45 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 20 s, different annealing temperature (Supplementary Table S1) for 30 s, extension at 72°C for 1 min, then one cycle at 72°C for 3 min.The obtained PCR products, previously purified by DNA Clean & Concentrator-5 Kit (Zymo Research), were cloned into pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. In the set-up and validation of this procedure, 30 positive clones from five representative human DNA samples were analysed. Once determined the efficacy of the entire protocol, five clones for sample were analysed.Therefore, plasmids were purified using ZR Plasmid Miniprep Classic (Zymo Research) and analysed by automated sequencing in a ABI PRISM 310 with the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit (Applied Biosystems).The effectiveness of the entire experimental procedure was also assayed by analysing: (i) CpGenome™ Universal Unmethylated DNA (Chemicon); (ii) unmethylated purified PCR products of each sub-region; and (iii) independent DNA preparations also starting from different tissues.2.7. 5-methylcytosine immunoprecipitationFour µg of DNA extracted from both blood and cell lines were incubated with 40 U of AluI restriction endonuclease in a total volume of 20 µl overnight at 37°C and subsequently at 65°C for 20 min to inactivate the endonuclease. The enzymatic DNA digestion allowed us to obtain fragments of appreciable size compared with the random DNA fragmenting by sonication.5mC immunoprecipitation was carried out using the EpiQuik Methylated DNA Immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) Kit (Epigentek, NY, USA) according to the manufacturer's specifications. First, wells were washed once with Wash Buffer (WB; CP1) and then incubated at RT for 60 min in the presence of 100 µl of Antibody Buffer (AB; CP2) supplemented with 1 µl of 5mC antibody (or 1 µl of Normal Mouse IgG, as a negative control).After three consecutive washes of the wells with 150 µl CP2, AluI-digested DNA samples, diluted with ChIP Dilution Buffer (CP4), were added into the assay wells. The solution was incubated at RT for 90 min on an orbital shaker to allow DNA binding onto the assay wells. Therefore, the wells were first washed six times with 150 µl of the 1× WB, allowing 2 min on a rocking platform for each wash, followed by the addition of 150 µl 1× tris-EDTA (TE) Buffer. Afterwards, 40 µl of the DNA Release Buffer (DRB) containing proteinase K were added to each well and samples were incubated at 65°C for 15 min. Then, samples were incubated in 40 µl of Reverse Buffer (CP6) at 65°C for 30 min, 150 µl of Binding Buffer (CP7) were subsequently added to the wells, and the released samples, transferred to the F-Spin column, were centrifuged at 14 000 g for 20 s. After a centrifugation in the presence of 200 µl of 70% ethanol and two consecutive centrifugations in 90% ethanol, at 14 000 g for 30 s, purified DNA was eluted in 15 µl of Elution Buffer (CP8).CpGenome Universal Unmethylated DNA (Chemicon) and CpGenome Universal Methylated DNA (Chemicon) were used as negative and positive controls, respectively, in order to test the effectiveness of the kit.2.8. 5-hydroxymethylcytosine immunoprecipitation5hmC immunoprecipitation was carried out using the EpiQuik Hydroxymethylated DNA Immunoprecipitation (hMeDIP) Kit (Epigentek), according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Briefly, 100 µl of antibody buffer (AB) were added to each well of the microplates, followed by adding 1 µl of 5hmC antibody (or 1 µl of Non-Immune IgG, as a negative control) and incubation at RT for 60 min. After removing AB and washing of the wells with 200 µl 1× WB, 1 µg of AluI-digested DNA samples was diluted to 10 ng/µl with hMeDIP Solution (HS) and added into the assay wells to be incubated at RT for 90 min on an orbital shaker. Therefore, the wells were first washed five times with 200 µl of 1× WB, and then, with 200 µl of DNA release buffer (DRB). Afterwards, 40 µl of the DRB containing proteinase K were added to each well and samples were incubated at 60°C for 15 min, followed by an incubation at 95°C for 3 min.The sensitivity of the methods was estimated by analysing the reference DNA fragment containing 5hmC provided by the kit.2.9. MeDIP/hMeDIP-PCRImmunoprecipitated methylated and hydroxymethylated DNAs were then used as a template for real-time PCRs carried out using the SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix (Promega) in a StepOne Plus machine (Applied Biosystems). In these reactions, PCR primers specifically amplifying D-loop fragments previously detected by bisulphite sequencing as unmethylated and methylated were used (Supplementary Table S3).The final PCR mixture (20 µl) contained 1 µl of immunoprecipitated DNA, 1× GoTaq® qPCR Master Mix, 0.2 µM of each primer, and 1× CXR Reference Dye. The thermal profile used for the reaction included a 2-min heat activation of the enzyme at 95°C, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 15 s and annealing/extension at 58°C for 60 s, followed by melt analysis ramping at 58–95°C. All measurements were taken in the log phase of amplification.Specific PCR primers were used for verifying the enrichment efficiency of methylated and hydroxymethylated positive control DNAs. Fold enrichment was calculated as the ratio of amplification efficiency of the MeDIP/hMeDIP sample over that of non-immune IgG and then, normalizing the data to the nanograms of immunoprecipitated DNA used in PCR. Six independent triplicate experiments were carried out.2.10. Dot-blot hybridization of MeDIP and hMeDIP samplesDot-blot hybridization was carried out using the forward and reverse primers reported in Supplementary Table S3 as single-strand oligo probes specifically recognizing the H- and L-strands, respectively.The probes were labelled to the 3'-OH ends using Terminal Transferase (Roche) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Aliquots of four representative human and mouse MeDIP and hMeDIP samples were immobilized on six different N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences) strips and fixed with ultraviolet light for 5 min. Then, they were blocked in Detector Block Solution (KPL, Inc.) and incubated at RT for 30 min. After the removal of the solution, each membrane strip was incubated with the mix containing the relevant probe at RT for 30 min in the presence of the Detector Block Solution containing 0.5 µg/ml of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) Streptavidin (KPL, Inc.). After the incubation, the Detector Block Solution was removed and the membrane strips were washed four times with Biotin Wash Solution 1× (KPL, Inc.). Immunoreactivity was determined by means of the ECL chemiluminescence reaction (KPL, Inc.).2.11. Isolation of mitochondrial protein fractionsMitochondrial extracts were prepared using the Mitochondrial Fractionation Kit (Active Motif). 1.5 × 107 HeLa and 3T3-L1 cells were scraped on ice after the addition of 10 ml of ice-cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then centrifuged at 600 g for 5 min at 4°C. Cell pellets were re-suspended in 5 ml of ice-cold PBS and centrifuged at 600 g for 5 min at 4°C. Then, cell pellets were re-suspended in 250 µl of 1× cytosolic buffer included in the kit and incubated on ice for 15 min. Successively, cell pellets were homogenized and the resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 850 g for 20 min at 4°C. After centrifugation, the supernatant, containing the cytosol and the mitochondria, was removed and centrifuged second time at 800 g for 10 min at 4°C. Then, the supernatant was again removed and centrifuged at 11 000 g for 20 min at 4°C to pellet the mitochondria. Mitochondrial pellets were washed with 100 µl of 1× cytosolic buffer and then centrifuged at 11 000 g for 10 min at 4°C. Finally, mitochondrial pellets were lysed by adding 35 µl of complete mitochondria buffer, prepared by adding mitochondria buffer, protease inhibitor cocktail, and dithiothreitol, and by incubating on ice for 15 min.As a control, whole-protein extracts were obtained according to the standard procedure.2.12. Western blotting of DNMT methyltransferases and TET methylcytosine dioxygenasesEighty micrograms of whole-protein extracts and 30 µg of cytosolic and mitochondrial protein fractions were resolved on a 7% sodium dodecyl sulphate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred into Hibond-P membranes at 30 V for 2 h at 4°C. Membranes were washed with tris-buffered saline-Tween 20 (TBST) buffer 1× (0.3 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 2.5 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) for 10 min and then incubated at RT for 1 h with 5% non-fat dried milk in TBST 1×. Blots were also washed three times with TBST 1× for 10 min and incubated overnight, in TBST containing 1% milk, with anti-DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B monoclonal mouse antibodies (1:200), anti-TET1 polyclonal goat antibody (1:200), and anti-TET2 and anti-TET3 polyclonal rabbit antibodies (1:200). Then, anti-mouse, anti-goat, and anti-rabbit (1:5000) antibodies conjugated with HRP (GE Healthcare) were used as secondary antibodies. Immunoreactivity was determined by means of the ECL chemiluminescence reaction (GE Healthcare). Tubulin antibody (1:500) was used as internal control to exclude putative contamination of mitochondrial fraction by cytosolic proteins. Cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV isoform 1 (CoxIV) antibody (1:200) was used as a mitochondrial loading control. All primary antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, except for DNMT3A and CoxIV which were from Abcam.2.13. Statistical analysisStatistical analyses were performed using the SPSS 15.0 statistical software (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Student's t-test were adopted, with a significance level defined as a = 0.05.3. Results and Discussion3.1. CpG and non-CpG methylation patterns in human mitochondrial D-loopBisulphite sequencing was used to investigate the presence of methylated cytosine residues in the Heavy-(H) and Light (L)-strands of the human mitochondrial control region DNA (D-loop).Results revealed the presence in the sole L-strand of unconverted cytosines, thus indicating the existence of methylation in the D-loop (Fig. 1A and B and Supplementary File S1). In particular, all analysed clones showed identical methylation patterns, with the majority of the methylated cytosines located outside of CpG nucleotides. The global percentage of methylation (the percentage of methylated cytosines with respect to overall cytosine content of the analysed sequence) was around 35% (values ranging from 32 to 37%, standard deviations of 5%) compared with that at CpG sites equal to 17% (values ranging from 16 to 20%, standard deviations of 2.1%) in DNA samples extracted from human bloods (ANOVA test, P < 0.001). Similar patterns were also observed in tumour (HeLa and osteosarcoma 143B.TK-) and primary (skin fibroblasts) cell cultures, although they exhibit significant differences in methylation levels at CpG (ANOVA test, P = 0.002) and non-CpG sites (ANOVA test, P = 0.013). In fact, HeLa cells showed higher overall percentage of methylated cytosines (23 and 27%) compared with fibroblasts (10 and 21%) and osteosarcoma 143B.TK- (10 and 17%) cells, thus suggesting that the observed methylation pattern might be cell-type specific.

The graphical representation of bisulphite sequencing results was generated by the MethTools software (version 1.2) (http://genome.imb-jena.de/methtools).

In (A), methylation of cytosine residues located within CpG nucleotides (CpG methylation) is shown. The variability among samples is due to reported polymorphisms (http://www.mitomap.org), which insert or delete cytosines or guanines based on the revised Cambridge reference sequence (rCRS), thus creating/suppressing CpGs.

As expected, the analysis of both unmethylated control DNA and of the unmethylated purified PCR products of each sub-region revealed the complete absence of unconverted cytosines, confirming that the bisulphite conversion was efficient.3.2. CpG and non-CpG methylation patterns in the mitochondrial D-loop of mouseTo outline a broader framework of the mitochondrial D-loop methylation pattern, we extended the analysis to the mouse homologous region. Then, we applied bisulphite sequencing to two DNA genomic samples: the first isolated from whole blood, and the second extracted from 3T3-L1 fibroblast cell cultures. As for humans, the analysis demonstrated not only the presence of methylated residues within the L-strand of the murine mitochondrial D-loop, but also that these residues are preferentially located in non-CpG nucleotides (Fig. 2A and B and Supplementary File S2). However, for both the CpG (ANOVA test, P = 0.029) and the non-CpG (ANOVA test, P = 0.005) sites, the overall percentage of methylated cytosines appeared to be higher in the blood DNA samples (70.6 and 58.8%, respectively) than in the fibroblasts (12.5 and 17.7%, respectively).

In (A), methylation of cytosine residues located within CpG nucleotides (CpG methylation) is shown. In (B), methylation of cytosine residues located outside of CpG nucleotides (non-CpG methylation) is shown.Overall, the overlapping data obtained in both humans and mice seem to indicate that the methylation of the mitochondrial control region could be a general phenomenon and is established across species, at least in the higher eukaryotes, according to similar patterns.3.3. 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydromethylcytosine presence in mtDNATo confirm the methylation status of the mitochondrial D-loop, we determined the presence of 5mC and 5hmC within mtDNA-specific fragments by immunoprecipitation assays, because sodium bisulphite treatment does not distinguish between these two modified bases. In both humans and mice, a significant enrichment for the two bases was observed in those fragments detected by bisulphite sequencing as methylated. In particular, immunoprecipitated DNA fragments were enriched ~3.5- to 5-folds in humans and 3- to 4-folds in mice for 5mC, relative to the non-immune IgG control and to the immunoprecipitated DNA amount (Fig. 3A). MtDNA immunoprecipitated using anti-5hmC was enriched ~4- to 6-folds in humans and 3- to 8- folds in mice (Fig. 3B). Noteworthy, the human mtDNA fragment 16 037–16 477 was found to be composed primarily of 5hmC residues. Consistently, with both antibodies, no enrichment was observed for those fragments detected as unmethylated by bisulphite sequencing. Methylated and hydroxymethylated mtDNA immunoprecipitation. AluI-digested DNA extracted from blood and cultured cells of human and mouse were immunoprecipitated with anti-5mC (A) and anti-5hmC (B). Samples were amplified with primers specific for DNA fragments detected as unmethylated and methylated by bisulphite sequencing. The nucleotide position of these fragments is indicated. Fold enrichment was calculated as the ratio of amplification efficiency of the immunoprecipitated sample over that of non-immune IgG and normalized to the nanograms of immunoprecipitated DNA amount. Data represent the means of six triplicate experiments with standard errors of the mean.Methylated and hydroxymethylated mtDNA immunoprecipitation.

Data represent the means of six triplicate experiments with standard errors of the mean.Taken as a whole, the results we obtained demonstrated the presence of both 5mC and 5hmC modifications within the D-loop region with a prevalence of 5hmC.Finally, DNA probes annealing specifically the H- and L-strands were used in dot-blot hybridization experiments on MeDIP and hMeDIP samples in order to validate the presence of asymmetric methylation. We found positivity for those probes specifically recognizing L-strand, thus demonstrating that this strand is enriched, while H strand did not (Supplementary Fig. S4).3.4. DNA methyltransferases and tet methylcytosine dioxygenases presence within mitochondrial protein fractionsWe then questioned whether the enzymes involved in the maintenance and de novo methylation of the nuclear DNA could localize within the mitochondria. In addition, we investigated the mitochondrial localization of methylcytosine dioxygenases, reported to be involved in the conversion of 5mC to 5hmC. For this purpose, using human HeLa and murine 3T3-L1 cultured cells as model, we performed immunoblotting assays on mitochondrial protein sub-fractions to detect the presence of DNMT1, DNMT3A, DNMT3B as well as of TET1, TET2, and TET3.As shown in Fig. 4, DNMT1 and very low levels of DNMT3B were observed in the mitochondrial fraction in both humans and mice. As for TET proteins, we found TET1 and TET2 in the mitochondrial fraction of HeLa cells, meanwhile in 3T3-L1 cells only TET1 was detected in the same fraction. On the contrary, we did not find DNMT3A and TET3 in the mitochondrial fraction of the analysed samples (data not shown). Representative western blot electrophoresis patterns of DNMTs and TETs. Whole cell lysate (W), cytosolic (C), and mitochondrial (M) protein fractions of human HeLa and murine 3T3-L1 cells.

Whole cell lysate (W), cytosolic (C), and mitochondrial (M) protein fractions of human HeLa and murine 3T3-L1 cells. CoxIV and tubulin were analysed as mitochondrial- and cytosolic-specific markers, respectively.These findings suggest that enzymes involved in nuclear DNA methylation processes can cross the mitochondrial membrane to their final destination inside the mitochondria and, therefore, they might have a potential role in determining the methylation pattern observed in the D-loop.3.5. CpG and non-CpG methylation patterns in the mitochondrial D-loop of Dnmt1-/-, Dnmt3a-/-, and Dnmt3b-/- (TKO) mouse ES cellsTo demonstrate whether the methyltransferases located within the mitochondria have a role in determining the methylation patterns observed in the D-loop, we examined the methylation status of the L-strand of this region in mouse ES cells de<U+FB01>cient for Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, and Dnmt3b. In these cells, the complete lacking of DNA methylation was checked as reported by Tsumura et al.37 (Supplementary Fig. S5).Bisulphite sequencing analysis revealed the presence of methylated cytosines within the D-loop region in ~50% of methylated clones in both the wt and TKO ES DNA samples (Fig. 5A and B and Supplementary File S3). In these clones, the wt DNA sample shows global methylation percentage both at CpG (50%) and non-CpG (28%) sites higher than TKO one (31 and 23%, respectively; ANOVA test, P < 0.001). The persistence of methylated cytosines in the D-Loop region of the TKO DNA is consistent with the idea that DNMTs are not the only enzymes involved in the establishment of the reported methylation pattern. What is more, in both samples, the methylation percentage at CpG and non-CpG sites is significantly lower than that of other murine samples previously analysed (ANOVA test, P < 0.001). This result, together with the co-presence of both unmethylated and methylated clones, likely indicates that mitochondrial D-loop methylation depends on the differentiation state of cells.

DiscussionThe presence of methylated cytosines within the nuclear genome of mammals has been extensively investigated and validated in the last 20 years by several lines of evidences, particularly in relation to their role in the gene expression silencing that explains the inverse correlation between density of methylation within the regulatory sequences of a gene and its transcriptional levels.16,38–40On the contrary, methylation of the mitochondrial genome is largely debated and is far from being elucidated. Indeed, conflicting reports are currently in disagreement over the possible presence of methylated cytosines within mtDNA.26–35 Nevertheless, a CpG under-representation in mtDNA, first observed by Pollack et al. in mouse and successively by Cardon and McClelland in humans, has always suggested a susceptibility to mutation of this dinucleotide also in the mitochondrial genome and, consequently, to methylation.31,41,42Here, we provide evidence for epigenetic modifications in mtDNA as methylated cytosines were detected within the mitochondrial D-loop in DNA samples extracted from blood and cultured cells of both humans and mice. A peculiar aspect of our data is that the majority of the methylated cytosines were located outside of CpG nucleotides. The presence of non-CpG methylated cytosines might suggest that the limited available data about mtDNA methylation can be attributable to the techniques that have been used to date aimed prevalently at identifying methylated CpG dinucleotides located within recognized sequences of methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes.27,28Of note is also the existence of intercellular variability for both CpG and non-CpG methylation, with higher methylation levels in human blood and HeLa cells with respect to fibroblasts and osteosarcoma cells. The same pattern was observed in mouse, supporting the notion of tissue specificity of DNA methylation. On the other hand, no clear age-related differences were observed.Although recent findings35 have shown the presence of methylation and hydroxymethylation marks (5mC and 5hmC) in mtDNA by immunological and alternative methods, no data have been documented so far about this presence in DNA samples extracted from blood and cultured cells of humans and mice. The results of our study represent the first evidence of the exact localization and the relative abundance of 5hmC, relative to 5mC in the mtDNA from these tissues and cells. Our findings provide also further support to what has already been reported by Shock et al., specifically, that epigenetic modifications of cytosines in the mtDNA are likely much more frequent than previously believed.35,43,44It is important to underline the many control experiments we carried out in order to accurately confirm results we obtained. First, we performed different bisulphite treatments, also repeated many months later, to ensure that cytosine conversion was complete. Secondly, we adopted alternative DNA extraction procedures and extended proteinase K treatment for removing any residual protein detrimental to the above conversion. Using both strategies, the observed methylation patterns were similar. Thirdly, we conducted the bisulphite sequencing procedure by using fully unmethylated DNA samples to exclude potential effects on complete bisulphite conversion by specific structural features of the analysed region. On the other hand, we retain that the presence within the analysed region of unconverted cytosines directly adjacent to other converted cytosines represents a good marker of a successful conversion. Finally, both bisulphite sequencing and MeDIP/hMeDIP-PCR assays were carried out also on DNA extracted from osteosarcoma 143B.TK- Rho0 cells, completely lacking of mtDNA, in order to exclude spurious amplification of nuclear mitochondrial pseudogenes (NUMTs), with consistent results.45The presence of DNMT1 and much lower levels of DNMT3B enzymes within the mitochondria of the HeLa and 3T3-L1 cells, used as cellular model systems in this study, would suggest that the methylation patterns we observed in the regulatory D-loop are established by these enzymes. In fact, previous studies have demonstrated the involvement of DNMT methyltransferases in the establishment of methylation in both canonical and non-canonical sites.12,13 However, the translocation of the DNMTs within the mitochondria is emerging to be tissue-specific, thus we cannot assume that the results observed in HeLa and 3T3-L1 cells are a general phenomenon. However, in spite of these assumptions, Dnmt1-/-, Dnmt3a-/-, and Dnmt3b-/- mouse ES DNA exhibit an analogous methylation pattern, although less marked than that of the wt sample. This finding brought us to believe a non-exclusive involvement of DNMTs in the establishment and maintenance of the methylation patterns we observed within the mitochondrial D-loop. However, more interestingly, the differences in D-loop methylation among the two ES cells with respect to that of other murine cells (blood and fibroblast cells) we analysed as well as the co-presence in ES cells of methylated and unmethylated mtDNA molecules seem to suggest that DNA methylation patterns of adult cells are established at early stage of cell development and can change according to cell and tissue differentiation.The intra-mitochondrial presence of TET1 and TET2 might imply that the presence of 5hmC within the D-loop could represent an intermediate step in the 5mC demethylation mediated by the above enzymes, thus indirectly regulating the replication or transcription machinery of mtDNA. Therefore, the molecular mechanisms responsible for this methylation, as well as the functional properties of mitochondrial DNMT and TET enzymes within the mitochondria, represent interesting points that deserve further investigation.Our findings lead us to question on the biological significance of the D-loop methylation. In both human and mouse samples, we identified methylated cytosines in the promoter region of the heavy strand (PH) and within conserved sequence blocks (CSBI-III), which are highly conserved sequences located at the 5'-end of the D-loop and considered to be implicated in the processing of the RNA primer during the replication of the H-strand.46 Therefore, it is possible to hypothesize that D-loop methylation might play an important role in modulating either replication or transcription of mtDNA, two processes widely described as physically and functionally correlated. Indeed, the regions we found to be methylated are involved in forming the DNA–RNA hybrid due to the transcription of the leading (H)-strand origin. It is of note that the formation of this hybrid occurs to initiate the H-strand replication. Likely, the methylation of L-strand, displaying complementary sequence to RNA primer, may be involved in regulating the formation of the hybrid or stabilizing its persistence. We are currently carrying out experiments that could clarify the functional relevance of epigenetic modifications on the above processes, and the mechanisms which make them possible.Finally, it is might to speculate that a dense methylation of symmetrical (CpG methylation) and non-symmetrical (non-CpG methylation) sites we observed within the mitochondrial D-loop may resemble typical features RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM), so far described only in plants and in fungi.39,47 In fact, RdDM occurs specifically along DNA regions that are complementary to RNA, which directs the formation of a putative RNA–DNA duplex. It does not seem a coincidence to have detected the methylation patterns described above within the D-loop, which is a stable triple-helical structure where a RNA sequence forms a hybrid structure with the L-strand.Taken together, our data provide unequivocal evidence supporting the presence of both methylated and hydroxymethylated cytosines within the human mtDNA control region (D-loop), with an unexpected prevalence in non-CpG moieties. Since both CpG and non-CpG methylated sites were located within the promoter region of the PH and in CSBI-III, it is plausible that epigenetic modifications can regulate replication and/or transcription of the mtDNA. From our data, it also emerges that the peculiar methylation patterns we observed were strictly cell-type dependent, and that the methylation of mitochondrial genome seems to be much more similar to the epigenetic patterns taking place in plants and fungi than those characterizing eukaryotic organisms.Supplementary DataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007–2011, grant number 259679).Supplementary data"

IntroductionAmong the many cells that constitute an organism, only the germ cell can transmit its genetic information to the next generation. To achieve this vital function, germ cells must possess a distinctive gene transcription programme and epigenomic features unique to this cell lineage. It is accepted that, during development, germ cells undergo marked changes in their global epigenetic status, termed ‘epigenetic reprogramming’.1,2 However, details of the epigenetic changes and their relationship to the establishment of germ cell-specific gene expression have been poorly characterized, possibly for technical reasons. The number of developing primordial germ cells (PGCs) in embryos is limited,3 restricting the conventional analysis of epigenetic status. Most of the genome-scale studies on DNA methylation have focused on CpG islands (CGIs) or gene promoters (e.g. Borgel et al.4). Currently, the importance of DNA methylation of other parts of genes, non-genic or intergenic regions for establishing gene expression and the nuclear organization of chromatin is increasingly recognized.5–7 Although recent research has advanced our understanding of the PGC epigenome,8–11 further studies are still required to gain more detailed information on epigenomic features of germline cells and their involvement in defining germ cell-specific gene expression.In this study, we used a proven method of DNA methylation analysis called the HELP assay (HpaII tiny fragment enrichment by ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction (PCR)).12–14 Because this method uses linker-mediated PCR, it can be adapted for the small-scale analysis of developing germ cells. Oda et al.14 developed an improved version of the method, nanoHELP. Here, we have fine-tuned the protocol further. This modified nanoHELP method provides a global analysis of the DNA methylation status of CCGG sites using only a subnanogram (=0.5 ng) quantity of genomic DNA. The custom-made genomic microarray used in this study is unusual in that the CCGG sites of the intergenic regions as well as the promoters and gene bodies of the RefSeq genes could be tested. This HELP microarray may provide new information about previously unexplored parts of the germ cell epigenome. We applied this method to analyse DNA methylation in the mouse X chromosome. We reasoned that epigenomic features specific to germ cells can be found by focusing on the X chromosome, because the X chromosome carries many germ cell-expressed genes15,16 and undergoes major epigenetic changes (e.g. X chromosome reactivation) during germ cell development.17 In this analysis, we found for the first time a group of sequences that are specifically hypomethylated on the X chromosome of male germline cells. These sequences form relatively large genomic domains that harbour gene families displaying specific expression in germ cells. We term these regions as large hypomethylated domains (LoDs). LoDs have not been detected in previous studies, including recent whole-genome bisulphite sequence analyses,10 probably because mapping of bisulphite-converted short sequence reads onto locally duplicated regions such as LoDs is technically challenging. In contrast, the experimental design of the HELP assay, which involved removal of the potentially confounding effect of copy number difference12 and inclusion of a probe design that selects unique sequences for hybridization, was effective in finding LoDs. Interestingly, many genes with homology to human cancer testis antigen (CTA) genes are contained within the LoDs. CTA genes are normally expressed only in the germline, and are also expressed in some tumour cell types.18 The results presented in this study may shed light on the epigenetic basis for the germline gene expression programme and its relationship with oncogenesis.2. Materials and methods2.1. Sample preparation and purification of DNA and RNATMA5 cells are male embryonic stem (ES) cells derived from the 129/Sv mouse.19 The female ES#5 line was from F1 hybrid mice between TgN(deGFP)20Imeg (RBRC No. 00822) and MSM/Ms (RBRC No. 00209). The embryonic germ (EG) cell lines used in this study were TMA55G (male) and TMA58G (female).19 These ES and EG cell lines were cultured, as described previously.20 The Oct3/4–GFP transgenic mouse line TgN(deGFP)18Imeg (RBRC No. 00821)21 was used to collect PGCs from developing mouse embryos, as described previously.20 Germline stem (GS) cells were obtained from the RIKEN Cell Bank (RCB1968) and were cultured on a feeder layer as described.22 Germ cells expressing the Venus reporter were purified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) from adult testis cells of the Mvh-Venus bacterial artificial chromosome transgenic mouse line, Tg(Mvh-Venus)1Rbrc (Mise and Abe, unpublished results).23 All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Experiment Committee of the RIKEN BioResource Center. DNA and RNA were extracted simultaneously from the same samples using an AllPrep DNA/RNA Micro Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The quality of RNA samples was checked using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA).2.2. Gene expression profilingA 44K custom microarray24 was used for gene expression profiling throughout this study. This custom array covers all the known protein-coding genes as well as expression sequence tags derived from PGC cDNA libraries (Abe, unpublished) and was manufactured by Agilent Technologies. Total RNA was labelled with Cy3-CTP with a Quick Amp Labeling Kit (Agilent Technologies). Hybridization was performed according to the protocol suggested by the supplier. Hybridized slides were scanned using a microarray scanner (Agilent Technologies), and the signals were processed with the Feature Extraction software ver. 10.5.1.1 (Agilent Technologies). The processed signal data were normalized and analysed by the Gene Spring GX11.5 software (Agilent Technologies). The microarray experiments were conducted using biologically duplicated samples.2.3. Modified nanoHELP: linker-mediated amplification and hybridizationThe nanoHELP assay, a microarray-based DNA methylation analysis, was performed according to our previous reports12,14 with modifications. Briefly, genomic DNA (0.5–2 ng) was digested by HpaII or MspI in 100 µl of reaction mixture at 37°C overnight. This was followed by DNA purification with the MinElute Reaction Cleanup Kit (Qiagen), and the digested DNA was ligated to linker adapters, NHpaII12/NhpaII24 and JHpaII12/JhpaII2414 overnight at 16°C. After removing the linker adapters, the ligated DNA was added to a total of 50-µl PCR reaction mixture containing 1.5 µl each of 20 µM primer (NHpaII24, 5'-GCAACTGTGCTATCCGAGGGAAGC-3'; JHpaII24, 5'-CGACGTCGACTATCCATGAACAGC-3'), 10 µl of 5 M betaine (Sigma-Aldrich), 200 µM of dNTPs and 2.5 units of ExTaq DNA polymerase (TaKaRa Bio, Inc., Otsu, Japan) in a buffer supplied by the manufacturer. The mixture was heated at 72°C for 10 min and subjected to PCR amplification with the following parameters: 15 cycles at 95°C for 30 s and 72°C for 3 min, with a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. After the first round of amplification, one-tenth of the volume of the reaction was added to a fresh PCR reaction mix containing the same primers, and amplified for an additional 10–15 cycles14,25 with the same PCR parameters as described above. The PCR products were purified using the MinElute Kit (Qiagen). An additional column washing step with 750 µl of 35% guanidine hydrochloride (Nacalai Tesque, Inc., Kyoto, Japan) solution was performed to remove the residual primer–adapters. The amplified DNA originally digested with HpaII was labelled with Cy5-labelled Random 9-mers (TriLink Biotechnologies, San Diego, CA, USA), and the MspI-digested DNA was labelled with Cy3-Random 9-mers (TriLink Biotechnologies). The labelled DNAs were mixed and hybridized with a custom microarray (Roche NimbleGen, Madison, WI, USA) using a NimbleGen Array Hybridization Kit (http://www.nimblegen.com/products/lit/lit.html). After washing with the NimbleGen Array wash kit, the microarrays were scanned on an Agilent Technologies Scanner G2505C with a setting of 5-µm resolution. The HELP array experiments were performed using biological replicates. The raw data were processed using the NimbleScan 2.4 data extraction software (NimbleGen) to obtain the processed log2 (Cy5/Cy3) ratio data.Our previously published ChIP-on-chip data for cumulus cells26 were reanalysed and used. The ChIP-on-chip experiment using GS cells was performed as described in the same paper.2.4. Microarray designThe microarrays were designed to represent restriction fragments with 5'-CCGG restriction sites in a size range of 200–2000 bp (=CCGG segments) on mouse Chromosome 7 and the X chromosome. Ten 50-mer oligonucleotide probes were designed from unique sequences in each CCGG segment, avoiding repeat-masked regions and sequence ambiguities. Probe sequences were selected using a score-based selection algorithm, as described.12 Detailed information for the coverage of genomic regions on each chromosome and annotations of the CCGG segments are described in Supplementary Table S1. Information about the positions of probes, M-values obtained from different samples and k-means cluster number are described in Supplementary Table S2, and gff files of the HELP array data are available at our web site (http://www.brc.riken.go.jp/lab/mcd/mcd2/protocol/nanoHELP.html).2.5. Data analysisThe steps in the HELP data analysis are shown schematically in Supplementary Fig. S1. Briefly, hybridization signal noise is first removed from the processed data by cutting off the values in the range of random sequence probes. In our microarray, 10 oligonucleotide probes are normally assigned to each CCGG segment. The median signal intensity of the 10 probes is calculated and used to define the segment's signal intensity. Using the median signal values, the HpaII/MspI ratio is then calculated for each CCGG segment and converted to a log2 value to obtain the M-value. After normalization of the microarray ratio data, hypomethylated and hypermethylated segments are distinguished using an R script (http://www.r-project.org/) that determines the threshold values based on a binarization method.27 The marginal width of the threshold is calculated using the Mahalanobis distance.28 The log2 value at the threshold is set as 0, so that unmethylated segments have a value of =0 and methylated segments have a negative value (<0). For interarray normalization of the HpaII/MspI ratio, the threshold value of each array data set is scaled to 0. All the bioinformatic analysis described here is based on the UCSC mm8 genome assembly (http://genome.ucsc.edu/).2.6. Accession numberGene expression microarray data and the HELP array data are available at the Gene Expression Omnibus database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) (Accession number GSE39895).3. Results3.1. DNA methylation analysis with subnanogram amounts of genomic DNAFor epigenomic analyses of developing cells, materials can be very limited in quantity, precluding conventional analytical techniques. One of our goals was to describe comprehensively the epigenomic changes during the development of early embryos and germ cells in the mouse. Towards this goal, we use the HELP assay,12 a proven, microarray-based method, for the analysis of DNA methylation.13 The original HELP protocol requires 10 µg of genomic DNA as the starting material,12 but Oda et al.14 established an improved version of the method, nanoHELP, for the analysis of a limited amount of starting DNA. Here, we have fine-tuned the protocol further for the analysis of 0.5–2 ng of starting material. The details of this method are described in Section 2, and the flow of the data analysis is presented in Supplementary Fig. S1.The HELP assay is a microarray-based method that detects the subset of unmethylated HpaII fragments in the genome and uses the corresponding, methylation-insensitive MspI representations as a control. The M-value, an index of the methylation level, is calculated as log2(HpaII signal/MspI signal) as described in Section 2: unmethylated segment has a value of =0 and methylated segment has a negative value of <0. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S2A–D, the modified nanoHELP assay generated data having good correlations with the data obtained by the original protocol. To validate these results, bisulphite pyrosequencing analysis of six CpG sites was performed as described.12 The results showed that the modified nanoHELP assay could generate reliable data (Supplementary Fig. S2E).3.2. Custom HELP microarray used in this studyThe number of restriction sites for HpaII, 5'-CCGG, in the mouse genome (UCSC mm8) is 1 588 546, covering ~7.5% of the total CpG dinucleotides in the genome (Supplementary Table S1A). The CCGG sites are distributed almost evenly over the mouse genome and do not show an apparent bias to a particular genomic context. Thus, the use of CCGG sites is suitable for obtaining a chromosome-wide view of CpG methylation profiles.In this experiment, we designed a custom microarray harbouring 382 018 oligoprobes. We first selected HpaII or MspI fragments (designated here as CCGG segments) with a size range of 200–2000 bp, mostly from mouse Chromosomes 7 and X, and designed 10 unique sequence probes of 50 nucleotides per CCGG segment. The custom microarray can detect 22 128 CCGG segments on Chromosome 7 and 14 472 on the X chromosome, which correspond to 46 and 39% of the total segments on each chromosome, respectively. The CCGG segments were selected in an unbiased fashion except for a part of the Chromosome 7 and a small number of segments associated with some germ cell-related genes on Chromosomes 6, 11 and 12 (Supplementary Table S1B). Supplementary Table S1C and D describes the categorization of the CCGG segments based on the genome annotations. About 47% of the segments map to intergenic regions, 5% to promoter regions and 46% to bodies of RefSeq genes (Supplementary Table S1C). About 75% of the X-linked RefSeq genes are covered by this HELP microarray (Supplementary Table S1D). Because most of the CCGG segments in CGIs are <200 bp, ~1% of CGIs annotated in the UCSC mm8 genome assembly can be assayed by this array (Supplementary Table S1E).CGIs and gene promoter regions have been the main targets in most DNA methylation studies. However, the importance of DNA methylation in genomic regions outside the promoters is becoming increasingly apparent.5,6 It is expected that this microarray method should be appropriate for the analysis of previously unexplored and potentially informative parts of the genome.3.3. Analysis of DNA methylation profiles of stem cells and germline cellsWe performed DNA methylation profiling of the following samples: ES cells from male and female blastocysts, male and female EG cells established from PGCs at embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5), GS cells derived from spermatogonia22 and male and female PGCs purified from Oct3/4–GFP transgenic embryos20,21 in various stages by FACS. PGCs were isolated from male and female E10.5, E13.5 and E17.5 embryos. PGCs have not entered the gonads at E10.5, and that are colonized within the gonads in E13.5 embryos. At E17.5, PGCs are subjected to mitotic arrest in male gonads, and female PGCs are arrested in the early phase of meiosis.3 We isolated germ cells from newborn ovary and testis. Whole adult testis, thymus and brain were isolated from male mice and used for the analysis. Germ cells in the adult testis were purified by FACS from Mvh (mouse Vasa homolog)-Venus transgenic mouse (Mise and Abe, unpublished results).23 Gene expression profiling of all samples was conducted using our custom 44K microarray.Figure 1 shows the results of principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis of the DNA methylation profiles and the gene expression profiles. In this comparison, pluripotent stem cells (i.e. ES and EG cells) and PGCs from various stages show similar but distinct expression profiles; ES and EG cells are positioned more closely (blue circle) relative to PGCs (red circle) (Fig. 1A and C). This result confirms our previous findings that PGCs possess a distinct transcription programme from ES cells, although both share the expression of common ‘signature genes’.20 In contrast, analysis of the DNA methylation profiles showed the differences between samples more clearly. PGC samples could be classified into two groups: one comprising female PGCs and early male PGCs (i.e. E10.5 and E13.5 in the red circle) and E17.5 and P0.5 male germ cells that formed a cluster together with GS cells and testis (green circle) (Fig. 1B and D). Male PGCs in different stages appeared to be more distantly related to each other than to female PGCs, suggesting that the DNA methylation profiles change more drastically during male PGC development. These results suggest that cell types can be classified by their DNA methylation profiles and that, in some cases, DNA methylation profiling can display differences in the cellular state more effectively.

One of the most conspicuous trends was that the genomes of the PGCs examined are mostly hypomethylated except for male E17.5 PGCs. A box plot of the M-value for each sample is shown in Fig. 2B. Global levels of DNA methylation are lower in the E10.5 PGC genome than in ES and EG cells, and the levels are even lower at E13.5. At E17.5, the methylation level of male PGCs is increased, whereas female PGCs maintain a hypomethylated status similar to that at E10.5 or E13.5. The difference in the methylation level between male and female germ cells is most prominent in neonates: male spermatogonia have a highly methylated genome. GS cells possess a similar DNA methylation profile to that of P0.5 spermatogonia (R = 0.80). Epigenetic features of GS cells have not been reported to date, and this result suggests that GS cells should provide a valuable in vitro model for epigenetic studies of spermatogonial cells. Adult testis, which comprises both germ and somatic cells, has a slightly lower DNA methylation level relative to spermatogonia (P0.5 male) and GS cells (Fig. 2B).

The rest of the clusters showed some cell or tissue specificities in DNA methylation.3.5. Characterization of germline-specific hypomethylated CCGG segments on the X chromosomeThe clusters were then characterized by examining their tissue specificities in DNA methylation patterns. We noticed that Cluster 4 comprises the segments hypomethylated only in PGCs, GS cells and the testis, whereas these segments are hypermethylated in ES and EG cells, and somatic organs. These putative germline-specific hypomethylated segments were characterized further. Although no particular GO terms are enriched, Cluster 4 contains genes expressed in the germ cells of testis such as Xmr (Xlr-related, meiosis regulated)29,30 or CTA genes; e.g. the Mage (melanoma antigen) gene family.31 The number of Cluster 4 CCGG segments mapped onto the X chromosome is disproportionately high. There are 1004 segments in Cluster 4, and 715 (71.2%) are on the X chromosome, which has 14 472 CCGG segments in total. In contrast, 219 of Cluster 4 segments (21.8%) are on Chromosome 7, which carries 22 128 segments. Because genes expressed in germ cells or testis are known to be enriched on the X chromosome,15,16 we focused on the Cluster 4 segments of the X chromosome as candidates involved in the epigenetic regulation of germ cell-specific gene expression.As shown in Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S3A–C, we plotted the M-values of all the CCGG segments along the X chromosome using the data obtained from each sample (grey dots). To translate the M-value measurements into regions of equal M-value, we used a circular binary segmentation programme, which is used normally for comparative genomic hybridization analysis.32 Using this programme, we drew lines (black horizontal lines) to show regions of equal M-value. By tracing the line, we could identify the genomic regions in which the M-value changes significantly from the flanking regions. The M-values of the segments belonging to Cluster 4 are overlaid as red dots. The distributions of the M-values in the DNA of somatic cells (i.e. brain and thymus) along the entire X chromosome are similar to each other: the average M-value is less than –1, with some local exceptions. The Cluster 4 dots are mapped even below the average line, indicating that, as expected, Cluster 4 segments are hypermethylated in both brain and thymus (Fig. 3). In ES and EG cells (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S3A), the average M-values of the Cluster 4 segments do not change significantly along the X chromosome and are positioned below –1, suggesting that Cluster 4 segments are largely hypermethylated in the genomes of ES or EG cells. In sharp contrast, in E17.5 male PGC DNA, it appears that the average M-value line is often discontinuous, and that hypomethylated CCGG segments exist over relatively large, contiguous genomic regions (Fig. 3). For example, the average M-value of the segments within the ~9 Mb genomic region harbouring the Xmr gene cluster (double-headed arrows) is close to 0, and Cluster 4 segments are enriched in this region.

Double-headed arrows indicate the position of the Xmr gene cluster.It is obvious that the distribution of the Cluster 4 segments is not uniform, and that these Cluster 4 segments form ‘hypomethylated domains’ compared with their flanking regions. These trends persist in P0.5 spermatogonia and GS cells derived from spermatogonia (Fig. 3), with a few cell type-specific differences. In testis DNA, the overall methylation pattern of the Cluster 4 segments is essentially similar to that found in the male germline cells, described above (Fig. 3). We also examined earlier stages of male PGCs (Supplementary Fig. S3B). In E10.5 male PGCs, formation of hypomethylated domains, e.g. Xmr region, is not as obvious as seen in E17.5 male PGCs. In E13.5 male PGC DNA, the distribution of the Cluster 4 segments is similar to that found in E17.5 male PGCs. It thus appears that clustering of hypomethylated DNA segments become increasingly evident on the X chromosome during the development of male germ cells.3.6. Discovery of large genomic regions hypomethylated specifically in male germline cellsAlthough it is clear that segment DNAs possess generally lower methylation levels in female PGCs than in cells of somatic organs, the formation of hypomethylated DNA regions as seen in male PGCs is not evident in female PGCs (Supplementary Fig. S3B and C). We therefore decided to focus on the male germline-specific hypomethylated DNA regions comprised of Cluster 4 segments. To visualize the hypomethylated DNA regions in the male germline from a different viewpoint, we plotted fold differences in the methylation level between somatic and male germ cell DNA along the X chromosome (Fig. 4A). Because methylation patterns of Cluster 4 segments are essentially similar in testis, E17.5 and P0.5 male PGCs, the testis was chosen for this analysis. Brain was also used as somatic tissue for this analysis. As the data were plotted with a log2 scale, a negative value indicates the lower level of DNA methylation in the testis than in the brain. The plot revealed broad domains with lower methylation levels in the testis and therefore, in male germ cells of late stages (coloured light blue in Fig. 4A). These broad domains of hypomethylated DNA described above are distinct from CGIs, which are generally located within or near a promoter and have a typical length of 300–3000 bp.33 The broad and hypomethylated domains identified here are often much larger than CGIs and do not show preferential localization at promoter regions. Thus, these broad domains do not correspond to the known hypomethylated regions and may represent a hitherto unknown epigenomic entity. For convenience of discussion, we here designate such a broad and hypomethylated domain as an LoD. By definition, a LoD has a size of >10 kb and shows more than a 2-fold difference in M-value between germline and somatic cells (testis and brain in this case). Each LoD should also have at least one Cluster 4 segment. Demonstration of LoDs on the mouse X chromosome. (A) Differences in methylation levels between brain and testis genomic DNA along the mouse X chromosome. Fold changes in the methylation level, i.e. brain M-value versus testis M-value, were calculated for each CCGG segment, and plotted using the log2 scale along the X chromosome. The blue lines indicate genomic regions showing more than a 2-fold difference between the brain M-value and testis M-value. Light blue represents hypomethylated regions in the testis relative to the brain. Green dots at the bottom represent the positions of CGIs. (B) The positions of segmentally duplicated regions along the mouse X chromosome. Segmentally duplicated regions >1000 bases with >98% similarity are counted, and the frequencies of duplications (y-axis) are shown. (The data were from UCSC Genome Browser.) Grey bars represent duplications occurring on the X and other chromosomes, and yellow bars represent the frequencies of duplications mapped only on the X chromosome. (C) Methylation analysis of LoDs 10 and 12 by Southern blot hybridization. Genomic DNAs of the male thymus, male brain and testis were digested by either methylation-sensitive HpaII (H) or methylation-insensitive isoschizomer, MspI (M). The Southern blot was hybridized with a probe targeted to LoDs 10 and 12. A primer pair (FW: 5'-GCTGGGTCCAGCTTCCCTGG-3', RV: 5'-TGGCACCCCTCCTGCCTGAT-3') was used to amplify a 807-bp sequence using testis cDNA for generation of the probe. The 807-bp probe contains locally repeated sequences and corresponds to both LoDs 10 and 12 located upstream of Mageb1/b2 genes. (D) Methylation analysis of LoDs 10 and 12 in purified germ cells. Germ cells expressing the Mvh-Venus reporter were purified from adult testis by FACS. DNAs from purified germ cells and whole testis were digested with MspI plus BamHI (M + B), HpaII plus BamHI (H + B) or BamHI only (B). A Southern blot was made using these DNAs and hybridized with the same probe as used in Fig. 4C.Demonstration of LoDs on the mouse X chromosome. (A) Differences in methylation levels between brain and testis genomic DNA along the mouse X chromosome.

A primer pair (FW: 5'-GCTGGGTCCAGCTTCCCTGG-3', RV: 5'-TGGCACCCCTCCTGCCTGAT-3') was used to amplify a 807-bp sequence using testis cDNA for generation of the probe. The 807-bp probe contains locally repeated sequences and corresponds to both LoDs 10 and 12 located upstream of Mageb1/b2 genes. (D) Methylation analysis of LoDs 10 and 12 in purified germ cells. Germ cells expressing the Mvh-Venus reporter were purified from adult testis by FACS. DNAs from purified germ cells and whole testis were digested with MspI plus BamHI (M + B), HpaII plus BamHI (H + B) or BamHI only (B). A Southern blot was made using these DNAs and hybridized with the same probe as used in Fig. 4C.3.7. Overlap of LoDs with segmentally duplicated regionsUsing the definition described above, we list the LoDs of the X chromosome in Table 1. There are 16 LoDs on the X chromosome (Table 1), and their sizes are generally large: 11 of the 16 LoDs are >100 kb (mean: 1 219 252 bp), and six of the large LoDs are >1 Mb. The mammalian genome is replete with segmentally duplicated regions.34 Although segmental duplications can be found on every chromosome, they are particularly abundant on the sex chromosomes. Because LoDs are generally large and contain gene families such as Xmr, we asked whether LoDs overlap with segmentally duplicated regions. As shown in Fig. 4A and B and Table 1, all LoDs on the X chromosome are found to contain segmentally duplicated regions. The use of the MspI control represents an unusual strength of the HELP assay to remove the potentially confounding effect of copy number variation.12 Combined with a probe design that selects only unique sequences for hybridization, these aspects ensure that the DNA methylation readout from regions of constitutive segmental duplication accurately reflects the underlying DNA methylation and is not influenced by DNA copy number. List of LoDs on the mouse X chromosomeaNon-coding RNA.List of LoDs on the mouse X chromosomeaNon-coding RNA.Hypomethylation of two such domains, LoD 10 and 12, was confirmed by Southern blot analysis (Fig. 4C and D). Since LoD 10 and 12 contain homologous, locally repeated sequences, a hybridization probe can be used to assess the methylation status of both regions. The genomic DNAs of the thymus, brain and testis were digested by either methylation-sensitive HpaII or the methylation-insensitive MspI. In the HpaII digests of thymus and brain DNA, no bands were detected except for a hybridization signal in the unresolved part of the lanes, indicating that the genomic region is hypermethylated in somatic organs. In the HpaII digest of testis DNA, many bands were detected, and the band pattern was essentially the same as that found in the MspI digest, clearly indicating that this region is largely unmethylated in the testis. Given that the testis comprises both germ and somatic cells, we asked whether LoDs are hypomethylated in germ cells. We used an Mvh35-Venus reporter transgenic mouse line, in which germ cells are marked by Venus fluorescence protein (Mise and Abe, unpublished results). We also used FACS to purify the Venus-positive germ cells from the adult testis and performed Southern analysis. The results indicated that the genomic regions in the purified germ cells are indeed hypomethylated (Fig. 4C and D).3.8. Predominance of genes expressed in male germ cells or in the testis in LoDsWe noticed that most LoDs contain genes that are expressed in the testis. For example, Gmcl1l (germ cell-less protein-like 1-like), Ssx9, Fthl17, Xmr, Mageb, Ott, Samt4 and Magea are expressed in the testis and are included in LoDs 1, 2, 3, 4, 11, 14 and 15, respectively (Table 1). Expression of these genes are also detected in germ cells purified from adult testes (data not shown). If we omit LoDs 10, 12 and 16, which do not carry known genes, only LoDs 6 and 13 do not contain genes predominantly expressed in germ cells (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S3). The mean expression levels of genes contained in LoDs are shown in Fig. 5A. Genes within LoDs show significantly higher expression in the testis than in the brain. Figure 5B shows the mean levels of DNA methylation within and outside LoDs on the mouse X chromosome. Figure 5 indicates that there is an inverse correlation between the level of DNA methylation and the expression of genes in LoDs. Inverse relationship between DNA methylation and expression of genes within the LoDs. (A) A plot of the expression levels of genes contained in LoDs, and regions outside LoDs on the mouse X chromosome. Gene expression data were obtained from the Affymetrix Exon array data set.43 The expression values of exons contained in LoDs were averaged and plotted, and the data points from regions outside LoDs were similarly averaged. For statistical analysis of the data from regions outside LoDs, the same number of data points as those used to analyse within LoDs were randomly selected and used. (B) Mean methylation levels of genomic DNA within LoDs. The mean M-values from the CCGG segments contained in LoDs or in regions outside LoDs are shown.

Genomic structures of LoDs: Xmr/Slx and Mageb regionsIn addition, we demonstrate the detailed structures of two LoD regions (Fig. 6). LoD 4 is ~9.1 Mb in size (chrX: 22 991 291–32 117 922) and contains three distinct genes/gene families, all of which are expressed specifically in the testis. Because Xmr is a synonymous gene with Slx,29,30 we call this gene/gene family either Xmr or Xmr/Slx in this study. Xmr/Slx is known to be expressed in spermatids, where it encodes a protein, SLX/XMR, normally localized in cytoplasm.29,30Xmr/Slx represents a locally duplicated multigene family, whose copy number is at least 28 in LoD 4. Gmcl1l and LOC236749 are included in the same LoD, and both are expressed in the testis and in purified male germ cells (Fig. 6A; data not shown). Genomic structures of LoDs: Xmr and Mageb.

Similarities of the sequences are colour-coded as shown by the colour bar on the right (high similarity in dark red, 100% similarity; low similarity in blue, 70% similarity). The horizontal lines represent direct repeats, and the vertical lines indicate IRs. The middle section depicts the locations of genes contained in LoD 4 (coloured rectangle). Exon array expression data for the brain and testis43 are shown at the bottom (high gene expression in red and low expression in green). The positions of sequences with homology to the Xmr cDNA probe are also shown by grey vertical bars (Southern probe). (B) Southern blot probed with the Xmr cDNA. Genomic DNAs from three organs were digested with either MspI or HpaII. Xmr cDNA probe (708 bp) was amplified from testis cDNA using primers, Xmr FW: 5'-AAGGGTGCAGTTGTGAAGGT-3', Xmr Rv: 5'-TGTTGGTCTCCATGTTCATCA-3'. The hybridization signals in the unresolved part of the testis DNA blot are likely to reflect non-specific cross-hybridization. Southern blot analysis data using DNA doubly digested by BamHI plus either HpaII or MspI confirmed this notion (data not shown). (C) Genomic structure of LoDs 10, 11 and 12 (Mageb1/b2). Top: similarity dot plot. The vertical lines and coloured arrows indicate positions of IRs. The colouring of the similarities is the same as found in Fig. 6A. Homologous repeats are represented by the same colour. A magnified view of the IRs contained in LoDs 10 and 12 is presented on the left. Gene expression data for the brain and testis are shown at the bottom. The positions of sequences with homology to a probe used for Southern blot analysis (Fig. 4C and 4D) are shown by grey bars (Southern probe). (D) A DNA methylation heat map of LoDs 10 and 12.

Genomic DNAs from three organs were digested with either MspI or HpaII. Xmr cDNA probe (708 bp) was amplified from testis cDNA using primers, Xmr FW: 5'-AAGGGTGCAGTTGTGAAGGT-3', Xmr Rv: 5'-TGTTGGTCTCCATGTTCATCA-3'. The hybridization signals in the unresolved part of the testis DNA blot are likely to reflect non-specific cross-hybridization. Southern blot analysis data using DNA doubly digested by BamHI plus either HpaII or MspI confirmed this notion (data not shown). (C) Genomic structure of LoDs 10, 11 and 12 (Mageb1/b2). Top: similarity dot plot. The vertical lines and coloured arrows indicate positions of IRs. The colouring of the similarities is the same as found in Fig. 6A. Homologous repeats are represented by the same colour. A magnified view of the IRs contained in LoDs 10 and 12 is presented on the left. Gene expression data for the brain and testis are shown at the bottom. The positions of sequences with homology to a probe used for Southern blot analysis (Fig. 4C and 4D) are shown by grey bars (Southern probe). (D) A DNA methylation heat map of LoDs 10 and 12. DNA methylation levels of the CCGG segments are represented as a heat map (unmethylated segments in dark blue, M-value = 6.00; highly methylated segments in dark red, M-value = –6.00).The LoD 4 region represents one of the largest segmentally duplicated regions on the mouse X chromosome (Katsura and Satta, personal communication) and can be divided into four subregions (Supple-mentary Fig. S4). Subregion I spans ~3 Mb and harbours tandemly repeated Xmr genes. Subregion II spans ~3.8 Mb and comprises both tandem and inverted repeats (IRs) of Xmr genes. Subregion III contains tandem and IRs of Gmcl1l genes, which are duplicated on two distant sites on the X chromosome; the other site is also classified as LoD 1 (Table 1). Subregion IV is <1 Mb and contains tandem repeats of Xmr genes. One hundred and forty-one CCGG segments are mapped within LoD 4, and the fold difference in methylation level (brain versus testis) of these segments were calculated as described in Fig. 4A. The mean value is –1.4745, suggesting that the CCGG segments in this region are generally hypomethylated in the testis genome (Table 1 and Figs 3 and 4).Because of the repetitive nature of the LoD region, HELP probes cannot be assigned for most of the subregions II and IV. To examine DNA methylation in these regions, we performed Southern analysis of the testis and brain DNA digested with either HpaII or MspI, and hybridized with an Xmr cDNA probe. As shown in Fig. 6A and Supplementary Fig. S4, the Xmr cDNA probe should be able to assess the methylation status of 161 restriction fragments. These fragments are distributed evenly within subregions I, II and IV, and fill the gaps of information provided by the nanoHELP assay, which tests only unique sequences. The results of the Southern blot analysis shown in Fig. 6B demonstrate that the Xmr region is highly methylated in the brain and liver, whereas a considerable proportion of the restriction fragments appear unmethylated in the testis.It has been suggested that transcriptionally active genes are hypomethylated in their promoter region, while their gene bodies tend to be hypermethylated.6 However, a magnified view of the LoD 4 region (Supplementary Fig. S5) indicates that all CCGG segments in this region are hypomethylated in the testis and male PGCs regardless of their positions with respect to the Xmr genes. Both the probes positioned near the transcription start sites and the probes positioned at introns or even at intergenic regions are unmethylated in the testis, GS and male PGCs. The Southern blot analysis data suggest that the CCGG segments containing exons of the Xmr genes appear to be relatively hypomethylated in the testis (Fig. 6B). These results imply that methylation of the whole LoD 4 is subjected to a region-wide regulation. This feature is shared by other LoDs not described here.Mageb belongs to the Mage (melanoma antigen) gene family, which is expressed in spermatogenic cells and in some cancer cells.31 Figure 6C shows a genomic region spanning ~1 Mb that contains Mageb1 and Mageb2 genes. This region represents a large IR with arms of ~400 kb in length. At the ends of both arms, LoDs 10 and 12 are located 4–2 kb upstream of the transcription start sites of Mageb1 and Mageb2, respectively. These two LoDs do not contain the Mageb locus itself (Supplementary Fig. S6). Both LoDs are highly homologous and ~14 kb long, and comprise repeat sequences with a unit size of ~3 kb. These sequences are both tandem and IRs (Fig. 6C; magnified part), are found only in these LoD regions and are clearly hypomethylated only in germ cells (Supplementary Fig. S6). Hypomethylation of LoDs 10 and 12 was confirmed by Southern blot analysis as described (Fig. 4C and D).3.10. Developmental changes in the methylation levels of LoDsLoDs are hypomethylated in the testis, GS cells and male PGCs. The methylation heat maps of LoDs 10 and 12 shown in Fig. 6D illustrate how the DNA methylation of LoDs changes during germ cell development. During development, the PGC genome undergoes global DNA demethylation, which is known to be completed between E11.5 and E13.5.2 In E10.5 PGCs, the LoDs tested here are not unmethylated completely, whereas demethylation of LoD DNA progresses in PGCs by E13.5. At E17.5, the LoD regions are largely unmethylated in both male and female PGCs. This trend persists in later stages of male germ cells, whereas the methylation levels of the LoDs appear to increase in newborn oocytes. The results together with the results shown in Supplementary Fig. S3 suggest that, in general, LoDs begin to form between E10.5 and E13.5, and distinct hypomethylated domains are established around E13.5 in the male germline. Despite the global increase in DNA methylation at later stages of male germline development (Fig. 2B), hypomethylation of LoD DNAs is maintained in male germ cells. Although LoDs 10 and 12 are shared by male and female PGCs, the overall DNA methylation patterns are not identical, suggesting that a distinct epigenomic status is generated in male and female germlines (Supplementary Fig. S3).3.11. Coincidence of most LoDs with broad domains of the repressive histone mark, H3K9 dimethylationWe have shown that most LoDs are broad genomic domains with low DNA methylation levels that form boundaries between the LoDs and other methylated parts of the genome. The mammalian genome can be divided into broad domains of distinct histone modifications.36,37 For example, LOCKs (large organized chromatin K9 modifications) are genomic domains with histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation (H3K9me2) modification thought to be involved in region-wide gene repression.37 To investigate the relationship between LoDs and the repressive histone mark, we performed ChIP-on-chip analysis to detect H3K9me2 enrichment in GS cells as a representative of germ cells in this test and in cumulus (somatic cells in the ovary) cells as a somatic cell control.26 Figure 7 shows the H3K9me2 modification patterns on the X chromosome in both GS and cumulus cells. The overall pattern of H3K9me2 modifications along the X chromosome in GS cells is essentially similar to that in cumulus cells (Fig. 7A and C). Enrichment of the modifications along the LoD regions (coloured light blue) is seen in both GS and cumulus cells (Fig. 7A and C). In contrast, as expected, DNA methylation levels in the LoD regions are high in cumulus cells and low in GS cells (Fig. 7B and D). Figure 7E shows a magnified view of LoD 12, indicating that the hypomethylated region has the H3K9me2 mark. A significant enrichment of H3K9me2 is found in most (11 of 16) LoDs in GS cells (Supplementary Fig. S7). Large stretches of H3K9 dimethyl modifications overlapping LoDs.

Primers used for this RT-PCR analysis are listed in Supplementary Table S4A.Expression of six genes contained in the LoDs was examined in cumulus, GS, testis and two other somatic cell types by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis (Fig. 7F). Fthl17, Ott, Mageb and Magea are included in the LoDs and are expressed in the testis; the expression level of these genes is much higher in GS cells, but only negligible expression is detected in somatic cells. This result indicates that genes in hypomethylated LoDs can be expressed even though the same region has continuous H3K9me2 modifications (Fig. 7A and C and Supplementary Fig. S7), demonstrating peculiar epigenomic features of LoD regions. It is reasonable to expect that Ssx and Xmr are barely detectable in GS cells, because these genes become active in post-meiotic stages,16 whereas GS cells are derived from pre-meiotic spermatogonia. It is probable that, in GS cells, other factors required for the expression of post-meiotic genes (e.g. transcription factors) are lacking. These results suggest that DNA hypomethylation in LoDs may not be sufficient by itself, but is a prerequisite for the expression of LoD genes.4. DiscussionIn the present study, we have analysed the DNA methylation profiles of developing germ cells using the modified nanoHELP method, which requires only a limited amount of DNA. Recent studies by Guibert et al.9 using the methylated DNA immunoprecipitation analysis of a promoter array and Seisenberger et al.10 using a whole-genome bisulphite sequencing suggest that DNA demethylation of the PGC genome is initiated earlier than previously thought.1,2 Our finding that the PGC genome is substantially hypomethylated already at E10.5 is consistent with the result of Seisenberger et al.,10 confirming the technical reliability of our method. Our data from developing germ cells revealed for the first time the presence of large, hypomethylated DNA domains on the X chromosome of male germline cells in mice.4.1. Discovery of large hypomethylated domains of epigenomic organizationTraditionally, epigenetic studies have focused on modifications of genes or elements adjacent to genes. However, with the development of genome-wide assays, recent studies have revealed marked clustering of particular histone modifications over relatively large genomic regions; e.g. LOCKs and BLOCs (broad local enrichments) enriched with the histone marks H3K9me2 and H3K27me3, respectively.36,37 These large epigenetic marks, LOCKs in particular, are thought to be involved in gene silencing. DNA methylation is found throughout the mammalian genome except for short unmethylated regions, CGIs, which typically occur around the transcription start sites of genes.6 The LoDs described in this work are also hypomethylated genomic regions, but are distinct from CGIs in terms of their size, tissue specificity and genomic structure. To our knowledge, large differentially methylated DNA regions showing germ cell specificities, such as LoDs, have not been previously reported. This may be because previous studies have focused only on methylation of gene promoters and not broader genomic contexts in germ cell samples. In contrast, our custom HELP chip method could assess the DNA methylation status of both genic and intergenic regions using the meager amounts of DNA that could be sampled from germ cell genomes in this study.Seisenberger et al.10 recently reported the results of whole-genome bisulphite sequencing analysis of the mouse PGC genome. We analysed their data on E16.5 male PGCs to determine whether LoDs could be found at the single-nucleotide level and found that the number of sequence reads mapped to LoDs were significantly lower than that mapped to the flanking regions (data not shown). Given that mapping of bisulphite-converted short sequence reads onto locally duplicated regions is technically challenging, the probability of finding LoDs using the bisulphite sequencing data currently available seems low. In contrast, the HELP assay uses an MspI control to remove the potentially confounding effect of copy number variation12 along with a probe design that selects unique sequences for hybridization. These ensure that the DNA methylation readout from regions of segmental duplication is genuinely reflective of the underlying DNA methylation. Oda et al.38 reported that CGI methylation of an X-linked homeobox gene cluster spanning ~1 Mb is under long-range regulation in a tissue-specific manner. Therefore, widespread changes in DNA methylation could occur depending on the cellular phenotype or differentiation status.4.2. Peculiar epigenomic features of LoDsLoDs have been detected based on arbitrary criteria, but most share common features. Most LoDs represent segmental duplications that harbour germline-expressed genes and overlap with large H3K9me2-enriched domains. Wen et al.37 described large H3K9me2-enriched chromatin blocks, LOCKs, in the human and mouse. The occurrence of LOCKs is differentiation specific: there are more LOCKs in differentiated cells, and genes contained in the LOCKs tend to be repressed during differentiation. Because LOCKs substantially overlap with lamin B-associated domains, a gene-silencing mechanism based on three-dimensional subnuclear organization has been proposed.37 We found that most LoDs are enriched with H3K9me2 modifications, and that at least four LoDs—1, 2, 3 and 4—correspond to the LOCKs described by Wen et al.37 (data not shown). Overlaps of other LoDs with LOCKs cannot be checked because LOCKs data are not available for the rest of the mouse X chromosome. Overlap of LoDs with LOCKs is counterintuitive because LOCKs are supposed to repress gene expression, whereas genes can be highly expressed within LoDs. This may be reconciled if we assume that gene silencing in LoDs is complete when both DNA methylation and H3K9me2 marks are established, but is derepressed in the absence of DNA methylation. Consistent with this idea, somatic cells such as cumulus cells, which have both marks, do not express the LoD genes, although germ cell genes can be active in DNA-hypomethylated but H3K9-dimethylated LoDs. The H3K9me2 histone methyltransferases, G9a and GLP, are required for DNA methylation in ES cells, but not in cancer cells.39 It is thus likely that DNA methylation and the H3K9me2 modification are not always interdependent, and that they can be regulated independently in the LoD regions of male germ cells and cancer cells.4.3. Segmental duplication, hypomethylation and gene expression in germ cells and cancer cellsThrough the analysis of germ cell-specific hypomethylated regions, we found that LoDs overlap with large segmentally duplicated regions, within which germ cell-expressed genes are commonly found. Some of these genes, such as Xmr, are found only in rodents. In contrast, the Mage gene family genes, Ssx and Fthl17, are conserved in the human genome and are known as CTA genes, which are expressed specifically in germ cells and in some tumour cell types. More than 260 CTA genes have been detected in the human (http://www.cta.lncc.br/), and half of them are on the X chromosome. Most of the X-linked CTA genes are organized as multicopy gene families.18 Warburton et al.40 searched the IR structures in the human genome and found that the X chromosome is replete with large IRs harbouring testis genes, most of which encode CTA genes. More than 40% of large IRs found in the mouse genome are on the X chromosome, and Ssx, Fthl17 and the Xmr loci are contained in such regions. Thus, three kinds of studies with different starting points reached the same conclusion: the X chromosome is abundant with duplicated regions containing germ cell-expressed genes, including CTA genes. To this, we add the new observation that these regions also have unique epigenomic features, i.e. widespread DNA hypomethylation and H3K9me2 enrichment. The epigenomic features of the LoDs could account for the finding that CTA genes can be activated by inhibition of DNA methylation but not by a reduction in H3K9 dimethylation,39,41 and suggest that DNA methylation is the key epigenetic mechanism involved with the regulation of LoD–CTA genes. It is not fully understood how DNA methylation regulates the coordinated expression of CTA genes in a cell type-specific manner. It is also necessary to clarify whether CTA gene expression contributes directly to oncogenesis or whether it simply reflects global chromatin changes that occur during tumour formation. Simpson et al.42 postulated an intriguing hypothesis that the aberrant expression of germline genes in cancer reflects the activation of the gametogenic programme, which is normally silenced in somatic cells. The gametogenic programme is normally repressed because germline-specific products would be harmful for normal somatic cells, whereas they would be advantageous for cancer cells. To test this hypothesis, it will be essential to elucidate the activation mechanism for the germline gene expression programme, as well as the epigenetic and chromatin status required for the operation of this programme. As shown in this study, widespread DNA hypomethylation may be a prerequisite for the activation of LoD genes, including CTA genes. In addition to DNA methylation, the nuclear chromatin environments within germ cells and/or tumour cells may also be important for long-range transcriptional control over large genomic regions, because LOCKs,37 LoDs and the partially methylated domains found in colorectal cancer7 are correlated with nuclear lamina-associated domains. Therefore, further studies of epigenomic features and the nuclear architecture of LoDs may shed light on the germline gene expression programme and its relationship to oncogenesis.42Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported, in part, by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan to K.A.We wish to thank Drs T.

IntroductionLeishmaniases are neglected infectious diseases caused by parasites belonging to the Trypanosomatidae family and the Leishmania genus. Leishmaniases are prevalent in tropical countries; ~12 million people are affected by these diseases worldwide with 350 million people at risk of infection and an estimated yearly incidence of 2 million cases.1Leishmania spp. are digenetic parasites that develop as promastigotes in the gut of phlebotominae sandflies and as intracellular amastigotes in the macrophages of vertebrate hosts. The Lainson and Shaw classification2 subdivides the Leishmania genus into two subgenera based on the localization of promastigotes in the insect alimentary tract. The subgenus Leishmania comprises species limited to the midgut and foregut of the sand fly, whereas the subgenus Viannia includes species that develop a prolonged phase in the hindgut with later migration of flagellates to the midgut and foregut of the vector's alimentary tract. More recently, a third subgenus has been included in Leishmania classification, the subgenus Sauroleishmania, which comprises species that exclusively parasitize lizards.3 A brief classification of Leishmania subgenera and species associated with the diverse array of leishmaniasis clinical manifestations (cutaneous, mucocutaneous, and visceral forms) is provided in Fig. 1A. Overview of the L. (L.) mexicana complex. (A) Classification of the Leishmania genus, subgenus and species complex (adapted from the WHO reports and Bates, 2007). Leishmania (L.) amazonensis and L.

Bar = 5 µm.Leishmaniases are primarily zoonotic diseases, and a variety of mammals acts as reservoirs of Leishmania species. Specifically, rodents, edentates, and marsupials typically harbor cutaneous leishmaniasis, whereas wild canines and domestic dogs are the main reservoirs of zoonotic visceral leishmaniases. In human hosts, disease outcomes are determined by a combination of parasitic properties (dermotropic versus viscerotropic species) and host factors, such as genetic variability and immune responses to infection.4,5 Among the causative species of cutaneous leishmaniases in Brazil, recent data indicate that 8% are attributed to Leishmania (L.) amazonensis.6 This species can cause simple and diffuse forms of cutaneous leishmaniasis (DCL) and was implicated recently in borderline disseminated cutaneous leishmaniasis, an intermediate form of disease.7Infections with Leishmania species belonging to the Leishmania (L.) mexicana complex involve the dermal infiltration of macrophages that harbor parasites in large parasitophorous vacuoles (PVs). Most Leishmania species including Leishmania (L.) major, Leishmania (L.) donovani, and Leishmania (V.) braziliensis lodge intracellularly within small membrane-bound PVs that typically contain a single parasite and undergo fission as the amastigotes divide.8 In contrast, amastigotes of L. (L.) amazonensis and L. (L.) mexicana are housed in large numbers within spacious PVs (Fig. 1B) that fuse together.9 These enlarged PVs may subvert host cell defenses by facilitating conditions of relatively diluted hydrolytic enzymes.10,11 The mechanistic basis of spacious PV development remains unknown and likely is triggered by unidentified parasitic factors produced by L. (L.) amazonensis and other species from the L. (L.) mexicana complex, such as L. (L.) mexicana and Leishmania (L.) pifanoi.12During the past decade, several reports have attempted to elucidate the factors used by Leishmania to interact with its vertebrate host and establish an infection. Like other kinetoplastids, gene expression in Leishmania is regulated mainly at the post-transcriptional level by RNA stability, rather than by promoters.13 Genes are organized into polycistronic transcriptional units, and protein-encoding genes are co-transcribed by RNA polymerase II. Precursor mRNAs subsequently are trans-spliced and polyadenylated.14–16The number of chromosomes has been established for several Leishmania species.17–21 The molecular karyotypes of Old World Leishmania species [L. (L.) infantum, L. (L.) donovani, L. (L.)major, and L. (S.) tarentolae] each comprise 36 chromosomes,17 whereas the New World species, L. (V.) braziliensis, and L. (L.) mexicana have 35 and 34 chromosomes, respectively, due to fusion events involving 2–4 chromosomes.18,19The genomes of two Old World Leishmania species, L. (L.) major Friedlin, and L. (L.) infantum JPCM5, and one New World species, L. (V.) braziliensis M2904, have been sequenced and annotated.19,22 Recently, the genomes of L. (L.) mexicana, 16 clinical isolates of L. (L.) donovani, and the lizard parasite, L. (S.) tarentolae, were sequenced and assembled using high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies.20,23,24 Despite evolutionary divergence within the Leishmania genus, Leishmania comparative genomics suggests a high degree of synteny.19,20,23,24Leishmania spp. from the Leishmania and Viannia subgenera exhibit highly conserved gene sequences with remarkably few genes or paralog groups that are unique to any given species. However, L. (S.) tarentolae lacks genes associated with the intracellular life stages of human pathogenic Leishmania spp.20 On the other hand, the L. (V.) braziliensis genome includes features that are lacking in the genomes of Old World Leishmania spp., such as transposable elements and RNA interference (RNAi) machinery.19,25,26To obtain a broader understanding of the pathogenesis of leishmaniasis, we sequenced the genome of the New World species, L. (L.) amazonensis. Using a comparative bioinformatics approach with other available Leishmania genomes, we searched for conserved domains and orthologous gene families among predicted proteins of L. (L.) amazonensis. In addition, we inferred the phylogeny of the surface glycoprotein, amastin, and generated a hybrid protein interactome to identify potential interactions between L. (L.) amazonensis secreted proteins and mammalian host factors.2. Materials and methodsAll the procedures employed in this study, except for phylogenetic analyses, are summarized in the workflow presented in Fig. 2. The workflow was divided into genome assembly and annotation steps, and functional and extended analyses of gene models. Bioinformatics analysis workflow used in the present study. Sequenced reads from the L. (L.) amazonensis genome were assembled into 2627 scaffolds and 8100 genes were predicted using comparative and ab initio prediction tools. The functional analysis of these predicted genes included: (i) AutoFACT functional annotation, which revealed that 45% of the predicted genes were unclassified or with unassigned function; (ii) screening for orthologous families of genes among Leishmania spp. (OrthoMCL); and (iii) screening for information about conserved protein domains deposited in CDD and PFAM databases. Expanded or exclusive orthologous proteins, or those conserved domains detected in the L. (L.) amazonensis genome were selected for interactome analysis with mammalian host proteins. This selection involved screening for possibly secreted proteins (using SecretomeP and TargetP) that also were orthologous to immune function-related proteins in humans and mice.Bioinformatics analysis workflow used in the present study.

This selection involved screening for possibly secreted proteins (using SecretomeP and TargetP) that also were orthologous to immune function-related proteins in humans and mice.2.1. Genomic DNA extractionLeishmania (L.) amazonensis (MHOM/BR/71973/M2269 strain) was extracted from the cutaneous lesions of a patient from Cafezal city, in the state of Pará, Brazil, in 1973. Since then, this strain has been maintained in the laboratory by inoculating hamsters and mice and by axenic culture. Parasites were cultivated in M199 culture medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Genomic DNA was extracted from 109 promastigotes after the parasites were incubated in lysis buffer [50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0), 62.5 mM EDTA (pH 9.0), 2.5 M LiCl, 4% Triton X-100] at 37°C for 5 min. DNA was purified using phenol–chloroform extraction (1:1 v/v) and ethanol precipitation. The resulting pellets were resuspended in 50 µl of 10 mM TE [Tris–HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA] containing 0.6 µg/µl of RNase A (Life Technologies Corporation, USA), and were incubated at 37°C for 30 min. Genomic DNA was precipitated with 2.5 v of 100% ethanol and 0.3M sodium acetate, centrifuged at 15 700g at 4°C for 15 min, and resuspended in DNase-free water.2.2. Genome sequencing and assemblyLeishmania (L.) amazonensis DNA sequences were obtained using the whole-genome shotgun strategy27 on a combination of 454 GS-FLX Titanium (Roche) and Solexa (Illumina, Inc.) instruments from the University of North Carolina (UNC, USA) sequencing facility. The GS-FLX sequencer generated single-end fragment reads (454 reads) with a mean length of 315 bp. The Illumina Genome Analyzer generated 76-bp paired-end fragment reads (Solexa reads) with an average insert size of 400 bp. Using an Perl script developed in-house, Illumina reads were filtered out if the average Phred quality score was lower than 20. For 454 sequences, reads comprising fewer than 100 bp or more than 500 bp (5% of each side of the normal distribution of read sizes) and reads with more than 1 unknown nucleotide (N) also were filtered out. The Solexa reads were assembled into longer scaffolds using the Velvet 0.7.56 de novo assembler28 with a k-mer parameter of 43. This value was calculated using the Velvet Optimizer script (Victorian Bioinformatics Consortium, Monash University, Australia), which tested a range of k-mers from 31 to 69. Newbler software29 was then used to assemble the 454 reads. The N50 scaffold and contig lengths of the L. (L.) amazonensis assembly were 22 275 and 17 272 bp, respectively. Solexa scaffolds and 454 contigs were combined by the Zorro assembler (Laboratório de Genômica e Expressão, UNICAMP, Brasil, http://lge.ibi.unicamp.br/zorro/downloads/Zorro2.2/DOC) to create the final hybrid genome assembly. The hybrid assembly was performed by combining the 4441 Illumina scaffolds and the 27 856 contigs from the 454 reads. Briefly, the Zorro pipeline consisted of (i) masking repeat regions in the contigs, (ii) detecting overlaps, (iii) unmasking repeat regions, and (iv) assembling hybrid contigs. In Phase 1, the repeat regions were determined by counting the occurrences of k-mers in the 454 reads. The assembler then masked k-mers in the contigs that occurred at high frequency. The absence of repeats enabled accurate overlap detection in Phase 2. The contigs were then unmasked in Phase 3, and the correct hybrid assembly was obtained in Phase 4 by merging all overlapping contigs into hybrid contigs. Overlap detection and consensus generation were performed using the Minimus package.30 The hybrid contigs were ordered and oriented with the Bambus program31 using paired-end information and manual verification, which yielded 2627 scaffolds.2.3. Gene identification and annotationPredicted proteins for L. (V.) braziliensis (8153 proteins), L. (L.) infantum (8154 proteins), L. (L.) major (8298 proteins), and L. (L.) mexicana (8007 proteins) were mapped onto the L. (L.) amazonensis genome sequence using the Exonerate program (v. 2.2.0),32 which performs genomic searches and spliced alignments in a single run.Glimmer, v. 3.02 33 and Genemark.hmm, v. 3.3 34 programs were used to perform ab initio gene predictions. The Glimmer long-orfs program was trained on non-overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) exceeding 200 bp in length. Genemark.hmm was executed in self-training mode by considering ORFs of at least 200 bp in length.The above resources were used to automatically create L. (L.) amazonensis gene models using EVidenceModeler (EVM, v. r03062010) software.35 For individual outputs generated by Exonerate, Glimmer and Genemark.hmm were given values reflecting our data confidence to define gene structure. We considered the following confidence values: Glimmer = 3, Genemark = 3, nucleotide-to-protein match = 6. The gene model was considered reliable only if it was predicted by all ab initio software or if it had similarity with one of the compared species. A final set of predicted gene models was then selected and manually inspected. Incomplete genes or genes overlapping gap regions were inspected with input from blastx alignments against protein databases and scaffold edges.The automatic annotation software, AutoFACT (v. 3.4),36 was used for functional annotation of gene models. AutoFACT enables transitive annotation based on sequence similarity searches in several databases. We used the blastp algorithm (e-value 1 × 10–5) to model gene alignments against the following protein databases: non-redundant proteins (NCBI RefSeq database, downloaded 8/6/2010), Swiss-Prot (only manually curated proteins, downloaded 4/15/2010),37 UniRef90, and UniRef100 (UniProt databases of clustered protein families, downloaded 4/15/2010), CDD (conserved protein domains, downloaded 4/15/2010),38 PFAM (protein domains, downloaded 4/15/2010),39 and KEGG (metabolic pathways, downloaded 4/15/2010).40 We set AutoFACT to consider the following order of importance for annotation: UniRef100, UniRef90, KEGG, non-redundant proteins, and CDD. Data from CDD–PFAM analyses were extracted from AutoFACT and were used for comparative analyses of CDD–PFAM protein domains among L. (L.) amazonensis, L. (V.) braziliensis, L. (L.) infantum, L. (L.) major, and L. (L.) mexicana. These data also were evaluated using reverse PSI-BLAST (RPS-BLAST, e-value cutoff of 1 × 10-5).A data set composed of all the Leishmania spp. gene models was created and compared all-against-all using blastp (e-value cutoff of 1 × 10-5). The results were submitted to OrthoMCL (v. 1.4) software,41 which clustered the proteins into orthologous and paralogous families. We applied the default software parameters, including an inflation index of 1.5. The inflation index regulates the cluster tightness (granularity) associated with sensitivity and selectivity.42 Clusters of proteins that presented bidirectional similarities between at least two Leishmania species were considered orthologs.Leishmania and Trypanosoma spp. proteins were aligned against the L. (L.) amazonensis genome using blastx with an e-value threshold of 1 × 10-5. The coordinates of the first hit alignment for all proteins were converted to GFF file format using an in-house Perl script. The BEDTools package43 was used to identify L. (L.) amazonensis regions exceeding 200 bp that showed similarity with Leishmania or Trypanosoma spp. proteins without overlapping with the gene model predictions. These regions were compared against the NCBI non-redundant database using the blastx program and manual annotation.The CodonW v. 1.4.4 software (http://bioweb.pasteur.fr/seqanal/interfaces/codonw.html) was employed to calculate the codon usage indices of each L. (L.) amazonensis predicted gene. The codon adaptation index (CAI) estimates the extent of bias toward codons known to be preferred in highly expressed genes.44 This index ranges from 0 to 1.0 with higher values indicating stronger codon usage bias and a higher expression level. The frequency of codon usage in highly expressed genes defines the relative fitness values for each synonymous codon. These values were calculated from the relative synonymous codon usage rather than from the raw codon usage and therefore were essentially independent of amino acid composition. Because fitness values are highly species specific, we first identified a set of highly expressed genes in L. (L.) amazonensis. This set was input into the calculation of the CAI. The effective number of codons (Nc) also was used to quantify the codon usage bias of each gene. The Nc ranges from 20 for a gene with extreme bias (using only 1 codon per amino acid) to 61 for a gene with no bias (using synonymous codons equally).45,46 Sequences for which Nc values are less than 30 were considered highly expressed, whereas sequences with Nc values exceeding 55 were considered poorly expressed genes.2.4. Phylogeny of amastin surface proteinsA phylogeny of Leishmania amastin proteins was built from a set of L. (L.) amazonensis amastins predicted by our assembled genome and from all predicted amastin proteins in the T. cruzi, T. brucei, L. (L.) major, L. (L.) infantum, L. (V.) braziliensis, L. (L.) mexicana, and L. (S.) tarentolae genomes. These amastin sequences [except L. (L.) amazonensis amastins] were extracted from TriTrypDB47 (accessed 6/28/2012) by searching for ‘amastin’ or ‘amastin-like’ entries.The 181 amastin/amastin-like protein sequences encoded by L. (L.) braziliensis, L. (L.) infantum, L. (L.) major, L. (L.) mexicana, and L. (S.) tarentolae and 24 amastin/amastin-like protein sequences from L. (L.) amazonensis were aligned using Geneious software (v. 5.6.3),48 in which an embedded MUSCLE software was applied.49 The alignment was performed using default parameters. The phylogenetic tree was inferred by Bayesian methods using MrBayes v. 3.1.250 with tree parameter optimization during the generations. A Bayesian tree was inferred based on 1 × 107 generations with a burn-in value of 75 000. Data were saved every 100 generations and were run in 4 chains during 2 runs. The Whelan and Goldman (WAG) substitution matrix was used for the protein alignment.512.5. Interactome of mammalian proteins and Leishmania secreted proteinsFrom the CDD and OrthoMCL analyses, protein families that were found to be expanded in L. (L.) amazonensis [i.e. more gene/domain copies when compared with L. (V.)braziliensis, L. (L.)infantum, and L. (L.)major] were also screened for orthologous in human protein databases. To identify human proteins that are orthologous to L. (L.) amazonensis proteins, we performed a blastp search (e-value cutoff of 1 × 10-10) against the human protein databases using the parasite's expanded proteins as query. These selected gene models were then analyzed using TargetP 1.1 and SecretomeP 2.0 prediction tools.52,53 Our objective was to identify proteins that could be secreted to the extracellular compartment or exposed for interaction with host cell components. We considered as putative secreted proteins those gene products for which TargetP returned a signal peptide value exceeding 0.8 and for which other values, such as the mitochondrial targeting peptide and the chloroplast transit peptide, were below 0.2. L. (L.) amazonensis proteins implicated in non-classical secretion or ectodomain shedding were predicted using SecretomeP v. 2.0 with the recommended threshold of 0.5.Considering that amastigote is the developmental form which maintains a durable relationship with the mammalian host cell, an additional step was included in the screening. Using the screened gene models above mentioned, we performed a blastp analysis (e-value cutoff of 1 × 10-5) against L. (L.) mexicana proteins expressed by amastigotes and identified in proteomic databases.54L. (L.) amazonensis gene models that attend to these four criteria were considered for hybrid interactomes: (i) expanded or exclusive in L. (L.) amazonensis; (ii) orthologous to human proteins; (iii) possibly secreted (start codon was manually verified); and (iv) possibly expressed by amastigotes.Some of the screened gene products could allow for interactions and interferences with native mammalian interactomes. Interactome networks for parasite-secreted proteins and for human and mouse proteins were created using IPA software (Ingenuity Systems, Redwood City, CA, USA) which was configured to build interactomes considering only those proteins expressed by cells of the immune system.3. Results and discussion3.1. Annotation of Leishmania (L.) amazonensis gene modelsApproximately 37 million 76-bp paired-end reads (average insert size, 400 bp) were assembled into 4411 scaffolds (coverage, ~94×) using Velvet de novo assembler software. The 454 reads (179 112 reads; average read length, 312 bp) were assembled using Newbler software into 27 856 contigs (coverage, ~2×. The final assembly was performed using Zorro, which combined scaffolds from Solexa and contigs from 454 sequencing to generate 2627 scaffolds (=1000 bp in length) that specified an (L.) amazonensis genome size of 29.6 Mb.Ab initio gene prediction was conducted using Glimmer and Genemark.hmm programs, which gave 8032 and 11 641 gene models (gene lengths =150 nt), respectively. Comparative gene predictions consisted of proteins from L. (V.) braziliensis, L. (L.) infantum, L. (L.) mexicana, and L. (L.) major aligned against the final L. (L.) amazonensis genome assembly. The final set of 8168 gene models was created using a combination of ab initio and comparative gene model analyses, EVM software to identify consensus gene structures supported by these two approaches, and manual annotation. Incomplete genes and genes overlapping gap regions were discarded from further analyses. Following manual annotation, 8100 gene models remained with an average length of 1793 bp; this is consistent with other sequenced Leishmania species. These data are summarized and compared with other Leishmania genomes in Table 1. Summary of the information obtained from the genome sequences of Leishmania spp.The number of L. (L.) amazonensis chromosomes (*) was inferred by mapping against L. (L.) mexicana chromosomes using the software SSAHA2 with all the L. (L.) amazonensis reads generated by Illumina.N/A, not available.Summary of the information obtained from the genome sequences of Leishmania spp.The number of L. (L.) amazonensis chromosomes (*) was inferred by mapping against L. (L.) mexicana chromosomes using the software SSAHA2 with all the L. (L.) amazonensis reads generated by Illumina.N/A, not available.The final set of gene models were annotated automatically by comparing them against protein databases (blastp) and summarizing with AutoFACT software. The results indicated that 55% of the gene models showed high sequence similarity (e-value 1 × 10-10) to functionally annotated proteins, whereas 42% of the models were similar to unassigned proteins (i.e. proteins with no functional annotation). The remaining 3% yielded no hits with any databases and were considered unclassified (Fig. 2).In agreement with previous reports,19,20,22–24 our genome sequence analysis indicated that more than 90% of the 8100 L. (L.) amazonensis genes are shared with other human pathogenic Leishmania spp. with little variation in orthologous gene content. Despite varying clinical manifestations and features of lesions, Leishmania spp. harbor a conserved genomic core encoding functions ranging from fundamental biological processes to complex host–parasite interaction networks.We performed a comparative annotation of tRNAs from the L. (L.) amazonensis, L. (L.) infantum, L. (V.) braziliensis, and L. (L.) major genomes. Using tRNAscan-SE software,55 the annotation yielded very similar numbers among the studied Leishmania species (Supplementary data, Table S1). Given the number of tRNAs for each codon in L. (L.) amazonensis, we calculated the CAI for all annotated gene models (Supplementary data, Table S2). The index measures the codon usage bias presented by highly expressed genes and can be comparatively employed to score native genes (higher CAI, more adapted to the pattern of codon usage) and possibly foreign or transferred genes (lower CAI, less adapted to the pattern of codon usage).56 Ranging from 0 (non-expressing gene, likely pseudogene) to 1 (highly expressed gene), we found that L. (L.) amazonensis predicted genes have a mean CAI value of 0.49 and median of 0.48 (Supplementary data, Fig. S1A). These data will be useful for future analyses of recent events of horizontal gene transfer in Leishmania.Additionally, we scored regions in the L. (L.) amazonensis genome that showed similarities with predicted genes in other Leishmania and trypanosomatid species but were not identified as ORFs due to premature stop codons or frame shifts. This approach yielded 36 genomic regions corresponding to potential pseudogenes (Supplementary data, Table S3). One L. (L.) amazonensis pseudogene identified in our analysis was a fragment of argonaute 1 (AGO1), which is involved in the RNAi machinery. In the genome of L. (L.) amazonensis, we did not detect the known trypanosomatid argonaute and dicer variants, AGO1, DCL1 or DCL2. In addition, proteins containing two RNAse III domains (characteristic of dicer) or PAZ and Piwi domains (characteristic of argonaute) were not detected in this analysis. Our results suggest that RNAi pathways are absent in L. (L.) amazonensis, corroborating the hypothesis that RNAi via dicer and argonaute has been lost from the Leishmania subgenus following its divergence from the Viannia subgenus.26Leishmania generally is considered to be a diploid organism because it carries two copies of most of its homologous chromosomes.19,22,24,57,58 However, there is increasing evidence suggesting that aneuploidy can occur in Leishmania species.23,24,58,59 Chromosome copy numbers can vary considerably among strains and species from different geographic regions, even among recent isolates.23,24 We mapped the L. (L.) amazonensis reads generated by Illumina against the L. (L.) mexicana chromosomes using the software SSAHA2.60 The median of coverage along each chromosome indicated a probable extra copy of chromosomes 7 and 26 and 3 extra copies of chromosome 30 in L. (L.) amazonensis (Supplementary data, Fig. S1B). In L. (L.) amazonensis, the exact number of chromosomes has not been defined. Preliminary studies using pulsed field gel electrophoresis have reported that the L. (L.) amazonensis karyotype consists of 25 chromosomal bands ranging in size from 0.2 to 2.2 Mb.61 Some bands exhibited variable ethidium bromide staining intensities possibly due to co-migration of chromosomes of similar sizes. Further studies will be needed to define the number of chromosomes and ploidy in L. (L.) amazonensis.3.2. Functional analysis of gene modelsIn our functional analysis of gene models, we focused on the common factors, rather than the species-specific factors, predicted in L. (L.) amazonensis and L. (L.) mexicana genomes and not predicted in the genomes of the other species. We chose one genome data set for each disease outcome to compare with L. (L.) amazonensis and L. (L.) mexicana. Specifically, we chose leishmaniasis causative agents representative of cutaneous [L. (L.)major], mucocutaneous [L. (V.) braziliensis], and visceral [L. (L.)infantum] infections.We searched for L. (L.) amazonensis genes that could be expanded or contracted in terms of gene or domain copies compared with the other species, particularly L. (L.) mexicana. We present a discussion of some of these expanded genes/domains that could participate in: (i) parasite tropism in host organisms via adhesion molecules or amastin surface proteins; (ii) the development of large PVs by lipid synthesis; and (iii) intracellular establishment by enzymes related to nutritional acquisition and resistance to host intracellular defenses, such as oxidative burst.The OrthoMCL software was applied to genome data sets from L. (L.) amazonensis, L. (L.) mexicana, L. (L.) infantum, L. (V.) braziliensis, and L. (L.) major to identify Leishmania orthologous gene families. We identified 7826 orthologous gene families [7488 orthologous gene families containing =1 L. (L.) amazonensis protein] with 468 families comprising at least 7 members. Most (6784) of the orthologous gene families were shared by other Leishmania spp. Eight families were found only in L. (L.) amazonensis and L. (L.) mexicana and 23 families were unique to L. (L.) amazonensis (Fig. 3A, Supplementary data, Table S4). The five largest families identified across human pathogenic Leishmania spp. using OrthoMCL also were identified in L. (L.) amazonensis: dyneins (Family 1), glycoprotein GP63 (Family 3, leishmanolysins), histone H4 (Family 4), ABC transporters (Family 8), and amastin proteins (Family 14; Supplementary data, Table S4). We identified several families associated with 2-fold or more gene copies in L. (L.) amazonensis than in any of the other human pathogenic species. These families include aminotransferases (family 256), 60S ribosomal protein L37 (family 216), and hypothetical proteins (families 323, 5508, and 7732). Among the families with at least 2-fold fewer gene copies in L. (L.) amazonensis we highlighted the GP63 gene family. The list of contracted gene families requires further investigation because some of them could be present in unassembled regions. Diagrammatic representation of (A) species-specific orthologous gene families (OrthoMCL analysis) and (B) conserved domains (CDD–PFAM analysis). A core of 6784 orthologous families and 1881 domains was conserved in all studied Leishmania species [L. (L.) amazonensis, L. (L.) mexicana, L. (L.) major, L. (L.) infantum, and L. (V.) braziliensis]. We detected 8 orthologous families and 20 conserved domains that were exclusive to L. (L.) mexicana complex. A complete list of orthologous families and conserved domains is presented in Supplementary data, Table S4 and S5, respectively.Diagrammatic representation of (A) species-specific orthologous gene families (OrthoMCL analysis) and (B) conserved domains (CDD–PFAM analysis). A core of 6784 orthologous families and 1881 domains was conserved in all studied Leishmania species [L. (L.) amazonensis, L. (L.) mexicana, L. (L.) major, L. (L.) infantum, and L. (V.) braziliensis]. We detected 8 orthologous families and 20 conserved domains that were exclusive to L. (L.) mexicana complex. A complete list of orthologous families and conserved domains is presented in Supplementary data, Table S4 and S5, respectively.Comparative genome analyses of L. (L.) amazonensis and L. (L.) mexicana indicated an expansion in the gene family encoding a class-IV branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase (OrthoMCL family 256) that consisted of 270–415 amino acid residues and shared few regions of sequence similarity.62 Branched-chain aminotransferases catalyze the synthesis of leucine, isoleucine, and valine, and may be used to fulfill the parasite's nutritional requirements. They also may be involved in parasite sterol and prenol lipid synthesis because leucine is the main isoprenoid precursor for L. (L.) mexicana promastigotes and amastigotes.63,64A 3'-nucleotidase/nuclease (OrthoMCL family 7761) gene was predicted as being exclusive to the L. (L.) amazonensis and L. (L.) mexicana genomes. This gene encodes an enzyme responsible for nucleic acid hydrolysis that was found to be dramatically up-regulated on the cell surface of the trypanosomatid, Chritidia luciliae, under purine starvation conditions.65 An ecto-3'-nucleotidase/nuclease was detected experimentally in L. (L.) amazonensis; this component has important implications for parasite nutrition, adhesion to host cells, and infectivity.66Substantial differences in the gene copy numbers between certain Leishmania spp. may account for the observed phenotypic variability in terms of pathogenesis and virulence. Several genome features could contribute to quantitative variation in gene copies among Leishmania spp. The expansion and contraction of genes in tandem arrays could result in up- or down-regulation of gene expression associated with copy-number variation. In addition, extensive variation in aneuploidy frequencies within parasite populations has been reported for several Leishmania spp. and for different Leishmania isolates within the same species.23,24,59Another comparison between Leishmania genomes was based on the identification of predicted protein domains in CDD–PFAM databanks. The result of CDD–PFAM analysis, included in the AutoFACT annotation, was retrieved and manually evaluated. In total, 2509 protein domains were identified; 2186 of these domains were detected in at least one L. (L.) amazonensis protein (Supplementary data, Table S5). Most (1881) of the identified domains were shared by other Leishmania spp.; 20 domains were found exclusive to L. (L.) mexicana complex [L. (L.) amazonensis, and L. (L.) mexicana], and 26 domains were unique to L. (L.) amazonensis (Fig. 3B, Supplementary data, Table S5). The expanded and contracted protein domains in L. (L.) amazonensis were evaluated by the same criteria applied in OrthoMCL (i.e. variations in gene copies when compared with other Leishmania genomes). Among the most prevalent domains were the heat-shock protein (HSP)70 chaperone (CDD: 143803) and the vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein MRS6 (CDD: 34648). The following protein domains were detected only in L. (L.) amazonensis and L. (L.) mexicana: thioredoxin domain (CDD: 32932), tat-binding protein 1 (CDD: 148614), sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain of bicaudal C homolog protein 1 (BCC1, CDD: 188919), hydrolase (CDD: 188206), and ATPase (CDD: 190944).As examples of contracted protein domains identified in L. (L.) amazonensis, we highlight: amastins (CDD: 140228), UDP-GlcNAc-dependent glycosyltransferase (CDD: 140237), leishmanolysin peptidase M8 (CDD: 189994), cathepsin (CDD: 185513), tryparedoxin peroxidase (CDD: 140280), non-long terminal repeat reverse transcriptases (RTs-nLTR, CDD: 73156), rim ABC transporters (CDD: 185513), adenylyl/guanylyl cyclase (CDD: 128359), and paraflagellar rod protein (CDD: 140353).The present study detected a thioredoxin domain unique to L. (L.) amazonensis and L. (L.) mexicana (NCBI accession COG3118). Thioredoxin functions as a hydrogen donor or disulfide reductase and is involved in the response to oxidative stress and in protein folding.67 Reactive oxygen species can be scavenged directly by thioredoxin or by thioredoxin-related dehydrogenases. Parasitic thiol and dithiol proteins may buffer the redox environment of PVs; this could account for the resistance of L. (L.) amazonensis to nitric oxide (NO) production in interferon (IFN)-<U+03B3>-activated macrophages.68–703.3. Extended gene model analysisPrevious Leishmania phylogenetic analyses, based on comparisons of isoenzymes, DNA sequences, and HSP profiles among species agreed with the adopted Linnean classification and with complexes proposed by Lainson and Shaw in 1987.4,71,72 The phylogenies from these studies indicated that L. (L.) amazonensis has an evolutionary proximity to L. (L.) mexicana, a finding that was interpreted as these species comprising a monophyletic clade. These studies also indicate that parasites responsible for cutaneous/mucocutaneous lesions could be as different and divergent from one another as they are from the parasites that cause visceral leishmaniasis. For instance, the phylogenetic distance between the cutaneous-associated species, L. (L.) amazonensis and L. (L.) major, is similar to the distance between L. (L.) amazonensis/L. (L.) major and L. (L.) donovani, which causes visceral leishmaniasis. Therefore, the same disease outcomes in Leishmania mammalian hosts can result from a variety of evasive strategies and factors distinctively featured by Leishmania spp.Amastin belongs to a multi-gene family in Leishmania that encodes small surface proteins of ~200 amino acids. Several members of the amastin gene family are dispersed throughout the genomes of all Leishmania species and exhibit various expression patterns.73 Phylogenetic analysis of trypanosomatid amastins defined four subfamilies of amastin (a, ß, <U+03B3>, and d) with distinct genomic organizations and expression patterns during the cell cycles of T. cruzi and Leishmania spp.74 d-amastins comprise the largest and most diverse amastin subfamily. In T. cruzi, d-amastin expression was associated with parasite infectivity to host cells.75 In Leishmania, the amastin N-terminal signature peptides are among the most immunogenic of all leishmanial surface antigens in mice76 and generate strong immune responses in humans with visceral leishmaniasis.77 DNA microarray analyses have implicated amastin in the intracellular survival of the parasite.78 Amastin gene expression was detected predominantly in amastigotes of several L. (L.) donovani strains isolated from patients with visceral and post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis.79 The roles of amastin genes in parasite homeostasis and growth inside acidic PVs also have been addressed.73,80 As transmembrane proteins, amastins could contribute to proton or ion trafficking across the membrane to adjust cytoplasmic pH under the harsh conditions of the phagolysosome. As a surface epitope, amastin may be recognized by opsonizing host IgG antibodies and could promote parasite uptake by host macrophages (via Fc receptors) and subsequent release of interleukin (IL)-10.81 We speculate that amastins could be involved in certain peculiar characteristics of L. (L.) amazonensis, such as its propensity to induce DCL, its development inside spacious PVs, and its resistance to the highly oxidative phagolysosomal environment in host cells.The TriTrypDB provides a set of annotated amastin and amastin-like surface proteins in the Leishmania and Trypanosoma genomes. Our search of the TriTrypDB yielded 181 annotated genes encoding amastin or amastin-like proteins in L. (L.) braziliensis, L. (L.) infantum, L. (L.) major, L. (L.) mexicana, and L. (S.) tarentolae. The L. (L.) amazonensis genome presented in this study identified 12 orthologous groups annotated as amastin or amastin-like proteins (families 14, 19, 20, 3539, 3935, 5852, 6119, 6120, 6543, 7556, 7771, and 7778). All families corresponded to 1 representative gene model, except family 19 (3 gene models were associated with this orthologous group). Thus, our OrthoMCL analysis predicted 14 amastin/amastin-like proteins in the L. (L.) amazonensis genome. All of these proteins also were identified in the CDD–PFAM analysis. The CDD–PFAM list also identified gene models containing amastin domains that were not identified in the OrthoMCL analysis. We gathered all gene models identified as amastin/amastin-like proteins (OrthoMCL) or containing amastin domains (CDD–PFAM) and built a list of 24 L. (L.) amazonensis predicted amastin/amastin-like surface proteins to perform our phylogenetic analysis.Alignment of the Leishmania-annotated amastins with 24 amastin/amastin-like proteins identified in the L. (L.) amazonensis genome (OrthoMCL and CDD–PFAM combined scoring) allowed us to build an amastin phylogenetic tree (Fig. 4). By placing the phylogenetic root halfway between the two most divergent/distant amastins (midpoint rooting) we identified clades composed of species-related amastins. Early branching clades could represent a class of amastin surface proteins conserved in Leishmania prior to its radiation (Fig. 4, blue branches). These Leishmania pre-speciation amastins are gathered in a, ß, and <U+03B3> subfamily clades.74 The presence of species-specific clades of d-amastins at terminal tree branches (Fig. 4, red, green, yellow, and purple branches) suggests that several amastin surface proteins appeared because of environmental selective pressures or pathogen speciation. At least in part, this could be associated with the diverse leishmaniasis outcomes of different Leishmania species. It is possible to identify amastin subfamilies unique to L. (L.) major, L. (V.) braziliensis, and L. (L.) infantum, and three groups in which L. (L.) amazonensis and L. (L.) mexicana amastins represent a distinct clade of amastins (Fig. 4, red branches). These amastins could play a role in the unusual housing of these parasites within spacious PVs of infected macrophages. Bayesian consensus phylogeny of amastin surface proteins. The phylogram is represented by a consensus of 214 amastin sequences. The root was inferred using midpoint rooting. WAG was used as the substitution matrix for the protein alignment.

The classification of amastin clades in subfamilies a, ß, <U+03B3>, and d was based on the amastin phylogeny performed by Jackson et al. (2010).One of the most striking features of the L. (L.) mexicana complex is the development of giant PVs in infected macrophages that harbor amastigotes. We speculate that the formation of large PVs may be related to factors secreted by the parasite, the subversion of host native vesicular trafficking, and potentially the production/incorporation of parasitic components into PV membranes. L. (L.) amazonensis amastigotes interact with the internal membranes of PVs via their posterior poles.8 The posterior pole behaves like an adhesion site between the parasite and PV membranes, although no adhesion factors or junction components have been identified to date. De Souza Leão et al.82 suggested that in L. (L.) amazonensis-infected macrophages, the internalization and degradation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules by amastigotes occur through their posterior poles. This degradation could be performed by secreted components inserted into the PV membrane. The posterior pole also may be interpreted as part of a parasitic secretory pathway in which secreted proteins directly encounter the host cell cytosol, bypassing the acidic milieu of the PV. Once in the host cell cytosol, secreted factors may be transferred to the host cell nucleus and/or plasma membrane, affecting gene expression, cellular functions and metabolic processes. However, the classically described site for parasite exocytosis and endocytosis is the anterior pole where the flagellar pocket is located. The flagellar pocket faces the lumen of the PV, and most secreted Leishmania proteins, regardless of their association with exosomes, are expected to reach the acidic (pH 4.5–5.0) PV milieu from there.83We hypothesized that Leishmania secreted factors could mimic mammalian factors, thus perturbing native host protein interactions. To identify possible interactions between parasitic and mammalian host factors, we constructed hybrid protein interaction networks in which human and mouse databases were compared against the list of proteins that are potentially secreted by L. (L.) amazonensis amastigotes. Our CDD–PFAM and OrthoMCL analyses identified nine conserved domains and three orthologous gene families that were exclusive to or expanded in L. (L.) amazonensis and/or L. (L.) mexicana and are also orthologous to human proteins (Supplementary data, Table S6). The CDD 143803, an HSP 70 domain, exists as six copies in L. (L.) amazonensis, four copies in L. (L.) mexicana, and three copies in the other species' genomes. We considered this as an expanded number of HSP70 domains in the L. (L.) mexicana complex. The six gene models in which these domains were identified (A42670, A6630, A68920, A73510, A30200, and A45910) were submitted to the TargetP and SecretomeP servers and gene models A30200 and A45910 were predicted for secretion. Additionally, A30200 and A45910 were similar to two L. (L.) mexicana proteins identified in a proteomic data analysis of L. (L.) mexicana amastigotes54 (LmxM.28.2770 and LmxM.34.4710, respectively; Supplementary data, Table S6). Although these genes are not exclusive to the L. (L.) mexicana complex, their similarity to two products from amastigote proteomic data is suggestive that, at least in L. (L.) amazonensis and L. (L.) mexicana, these products are expressed by the intracellular form of the parasite and could be secreted within host cells.The A30200 and A45910 gene models are candidates for the construction of hybrid interactomes, given that they present a protein domain expanded in both L. (L.) amazonensis and L. (L.) mexicana (CDD 143803), are predicted to be secreted and are similar to proteins identified in the proteome of L. (L.) mexicana amastigotes. The A30200 and A45910 gene models present a considerable similarity with the mammalian hypoxia up-regulated protein 1 (HYOU1) and the HSP 70 kDa protein 5 (HSPA5), respectively. We created HYOU1 and HSPA5 interactome subsets to identify host components that could be affected by the secretion of both A30200 and A45910 gene products. This analysis led us to identify toll-like receptor (TLR) 9 and IL-6 as putative targets of the L. (L.) amazonensis A30200 and A45910 gene products (Fig. 5A and B). The HYOU1 and HSPA5 both directly interact with TLR9, a receptor implicated in the recognition of CpG DNA motifs and present in endolysosomal compartments where it is activated by proteolytic cleavage.84 TLR9 is preferentially expressed in the granulomas of human cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by L. (V.) braziliensis,85 and TLR9-deficient mice are more susceptible to L. (L.) major infection.86,87 Thus, TLR9 is implicated in the immune response against Leishmania. The interaction between host TLR9 and the putative secreted L. (L.) amazonensis HYOU1/HSPA5-mimic could block TLR9 function and favor intracellular establishment of the parasite. TLR9 also is implicated in the production of NO via NO synthase 2, tumor necrosis factor, IL-6, and IL-12B. The production of IL-6 is inhibited in dendritic cells differentiated from monocytes in the presence of L. (L.) amazonensis88 and is present at low levels in the sera of Chiclero's ulcer patients infected for 3–8 months.89 Linares et al.90 reported that in vitro infection with L. (L.) amazonensis amastigotes decreases NO production by macrophages stimulated with IFN-<U+03B3> plus lipopolysaccharide. Thus, although hypothetical and genome based, our proposed interactome can be used to identify components implicated in the establishment of Leishmania infection of mammalian host cells. Moreover, the interactome provides a model for studying Leishmania-secreted proteins and their influence on important effectors of the host cell immune response. Interactomes of potentially secreted L. (L.) amazonensis [A30200 (A) and A45910 (B)] and mammalian immune cell proteins. The secreted parasite gene products are represented by red nodes in the interactome. The expression statuses of these parasite proteins during the amastigote stage were inferred using blastp with the proteomic database of L. (L.) mexicana amastigotes. The secreted components of L. (L.) amazonensis amastigotes share 28% identity and 94% coverage (A30200, A) and 69% identity and 90% coverage (A45910, B) with the mammalian HYOU1 and HSPA5 proteins, respectively. Both secreted components could directly interact with TLR9. We propose that orthologs of mammalian HYOU1 and HSPA5 are secreted by L. (L.) amazonensis amastigotes, interfering with host cell functions such as signaling and the production of NO and ILs. Arrows represent direct interactions and dashed arrows represent indirect interactions. The interactome was built using Ingenuity software, considering only proteins expressed in human and mouse immune cells and considering experimentally identified protein–protein interactions.Interactomes of potentially secreted L.

ConclusionsWe present the genome of the protozoan L. (L.) amazonensis together with functional annotations and extended analyses focused on host–parasite interactions. We examined the genome sequences of L. (L.) amazonensis and L. (L.) mexicana for potentially expressed genes at expanded copy numbers. Confirming that a few Leishmania species-specific genes may exist despite striking conservation at the gene level, we report conserved domains, orthologous gene families, and amastin surface proteins unique to L. (L.) amazonensis and L. (L.) mexicana. Additionally, we propose an innovative approach to interactome analysis that emphasizes the role of parasite secreted proteins in host interaction networks.4.

IntroductionSince the first description of recombinant DNA by Cohen et al. in 1973,1 scientists have dreamt of introducing novel characteristics into organisms for academic or industrial purposes, characteristics such as the production of desirable crops or consumable materials. Joining two or more DNA fragments via a ligase-catalyzed reaction (a ligation) is a fundamental technique in recombinant DNA technology and genetic engineering. The ligation of different DNA fragments can create new functional units. Many organisms can be genetically modified via recombinant DNA technology.Recent advances in functional genomics have revealed that gene clusters are involved in certain biological pathways or metabolic processes.2–9 For instance, a defined series of enzymatic reactions are often required in individual metabolic pathways. Therefore, introduction of a heterologous metabolic pathway into a host species will often required that multiple genes are expressed in the host organisms. However, despite many advances in molecular biology and genetic engineering technologies, a rapid, simple, and efficient method for joining a series of many gene cassettes is lacking.Stepwise cloning of restriction fragments is a commonly used method for connecting multiple DNA fragments. However, this method is time-consuming; moreover, it is often difficult to devise a cloning strategy because the number of unique restriction sites is often too limited. To address these difficulties and to construct long DNA fragments, several methods have been developed; MultiSite Gateway cloning, polymerase assembly multiplexing (PAM) method, In-Fusion system, and chemical syntheses of genomes are some of these methods. The MultiSite Gateway cloning is based on DNA recombination; a maximum of four DNA fragments can be assembled into one construct simultaneously, because the number of unique attB recombination site is limited. However, when more than five DNA fragments need to be joined, the Gateway methods also require many sequential reactions. The PAM method requires three steps for the construction of multi-cassette transgenes: polymerase cycling assemble of multiple oligonucleotides, overlap extension and annealing, and repair and ligation.10 The In-Fusion system is similar in principle to PAM; DNA fragments are amplified via PCR with oligonucleotide primers that carry extensions of >15 bp, and the In-Fusion exonuclease is used to chew from 3' to 5' at the fragment ends to produce single-stranded ends; the ends are annealed, and the DNA fragments are repaired and ligated in Escherichia coli.11 These methods for connecting multiple fragments proceed in a single step; therefore, the ligation reactions are faster than the stepwise cloning. But, these methods are often problematic when constructs with many gene cassettes are being built. It is difficult to ensure that the desired gene order and orientation and the correct nucleotide sequence are produced with any of these methods. Chemical syntheses of genome can be used to produce very large DNA constructs;12,13 however, this method often produces high error rates, and it is very expensive. Thus, the joining of multiple DNA fragments in a desired order is still labour intensive and time consuming.Here, we describe an alternative method for the sequential ligation of multiple DNA fragments, the precise sequential DNA ligation on a solid substrate (PRESSO) (Fig. 1). This method is cost-effective and produces DNA constructs more accurately than do previously described methods. Schematic representation of the PRESSO method. The 5'-biotin-labelled DNA molecule with recognition sequences for a meganuclease, e.g. I-SceI, and with a non-palindromic restriction site, e.g. an SfiI site, is used as the initial acceptor molecule for a series of sequential ligations. The donor DNA molecules for the subsequent ligations are prepared via PCR; the 5'-primers are biotinylated, the 3'-primers are unmodified for the initial acceptor and biotinylated for the donor DNAs, and all primers except for the 5'-primer of the initial acceptor contain an SfiI site. The amplified donor DNA fragments are digested with SfiI and purified. For convenience, ~200 bp DNA fragments are used as a spacer DNA (linker) in this study. The initial linker DNA molecules are attached to streptavidin-coated beads via the biotin label. The 3'-end of the initial acceptor DNA (the linker) is designed to be complementary with the 5'-end of the initial donor molecule, which has non-palindromic sites in 5'- and 3'-ends. The 3'-end of the first donor molecule is designed to be complimentary to the 5'-end of next donor DNA. Each ligation step is performed individually; a donor DNA is ligated to the growing end of a construct that is attached to a solid bead via the opposite biotin-labelled end; the beads are then washed and collected. In subsequent sequential reactions, the 5'-end of the next donor DNA molecule is ligated to the 3'-end of bead-bound DNA. In this manner, each donor DNA is connected to an acceptor DNA molecule that is attached to a solid bead. The final donor DNA molecules contain a vector sequence and a meganuclease, I-SceI, recognition site. Therefore, the final products on the beads include an I-SceI site on each end. The ligated DNA fragments are released from the bead via I-SceI digestion; to construct a transformable plasmid, the newly freed linear fragments are circularized via an intra-molecular ligation. The circular plasmids are then used to transform E. coli; replicated plasmids can then be recovered from transformed cells.Schematic representation of the PRESSO method.

MaterialsThe name, sequence, and restriction site information for each primer used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table S1. In this study, a unique restriction enzyme site was added onto many of the primers, so that restriction digests could be used to confirm the final product (Fig. 3). All restriction enzymes (including SfiI, BstXI, and I-SceI), KOD—Plus—Ver. 2 DNA polymerase, which exhibits high PCR fidelity, and E. coli DH5-a competent cells were purchased from TOYOBO (Osaka, Japan). We used Dynabeads® M-280 Streptavidin-linked beads (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA) and DNA ligation kit <Mighty mix> (TAKARA BIO, Otsu, Japan) as the solid phase for the sequential ligation reactions. In our preliminary experiments, we found that the efficiency of transformation of E. coli with the resultant plasmid carrying sequentially ligated DNA fragments varied significantly among reaction series that were examined by using some ligation mixture or ligation kits. The DNA ligation kit <Mighty mix> (TAKARA BIO) exhibited high efficiency enough to connect multiple DNA fragments using the PRESSO protocol. Usually 10–100 of E. coli colonies were obtained when we transformed highly efficient competent E. coli cells with the plasmid carrying a 20-kb DNA insert connected with 10 DNA fragments of 2 kb (Fig. 4). We recommend users to use the kit or to find a suitable one from available kits.2.2. Synthesis of a spacer DNAA biotin-conjugated DNA molecule with an I-SceI recognition site was synthesized as the spacer molecule that was attached to the streptavidin-linked beads. First, two complementary oligonucleotides, I-SceI-F and I-SceI-R, which each contained a I-SceI recognition sequence, were annealed to one another to generate a double-stranded DNA molecule; this molecule was then inserted between the EcoRI and PstI sites of the multi-cloning region of pUC19. This plasmid, pUC19-I-SceI, and two biotin-labelled primers, PUC-N-u (5') and PUC-CS (3'), were to PCR amplify a biotin-labelled DNA fragment (242 bp). The amplified products were purified with the QIAquick PCR purification Kit (QIAGEN, Germantown, MD, USA). The purified samples were dissolved in 100 µl of digestion buffer, and digested at 50°C with 50 U of SfiI overnight. The digestion products were purified with the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN) and precipitated with ethanol.2.3. Preparation of the initial donor DNA–streptavidin beadsPurified biotin-labelled linker DNA molecules (2 µg) were mixed with 30 µl of Dynabeads M-280 (Invitrogen) in binding solution [5 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), and 1 M NaCl] for 2 h at room temperature; the beads were washed with the washing buffer [5 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 mM EDTA, and 1 M NaCl] according to the manufacture's protocol.2.4. DNA fragments for the sequential ligationTo demonstrate the utility of PRESSO, three sets of 10 DNA fragments were PCR amplified from Arabidopsis thaliana genomic clones (Supplementary Table S2) with biotin-labelled oligonucleotide primers that each contained an SfiI restriction enzyme (Supplementary Table S1). The reactions were carried out for 30 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 50°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 1 min. The amplification products were purified with the Wizard® SV Gel and PCR Clean-UP System (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, USA), digested with SfiI as described above, and then applied to streptavidin-linked magnetic beads to remove any undigested products (Fig. 2). SfiI-digested DNA (2 µg in 300 µl) was mixed with streptavidin-linked beads (in 300 µl) for 1 h with gentle stirring. As undigested DNA fragments bound to the beads, the supernatant fractions were recovered to collect the fully digested products, which were then used for the sequential ligation reactions (see below). Purification of donor DNAs that were amplified with biotinylated primers. We purify donor DNA molecules to remove partially digested molecules. This step is often important to perform successful iterative ligations of multiple DNA fragments. Each donor molecule is amplified with biotinylated primers via PCR. The amplified fragments are digested with SfiI. When the digested fragments are mixed with streptavidin beads, partially digested products should interact with the beads, but the fully digested molecules should not. The supernatants are collected, because they contain the fully digested products with the appropriate overhang sequences; these products are then used for the sequential ligations.Purification of donor DNAs that were amplified with biotinylated primers.

Sequential ligation of DNA fragmentsWe dissolved 600 ng of the first donor DNA molecule in 30 µl of the ligation buffer from the DNA ligation kit (TAKARA BIO); this solution was then mixed with 30 µl of the mixture that contained streptavidin beads coated with biotin-labelled digested spacer DNA from pUC19-I-SceI; 30 µl of ligase solution from the kit was then added. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 1 h with gentle agitation on a rotator. The beads were then washed twice with Tris–EDTA (TE) buffer (200 µl for each wash). The beads were then sequentially incubated with each DNA fragment, in the appropriate order; each incubation was carried out in ligation buffer from the kit.For the last ligation reaction, we prepared a modified pHSG299 (TAKARA BIO) vector, designated pHSG299_CSPS. The vector pHSG299 was digested with EcoRI and SphI, and the following sequence was inserted to introduce four meganuclease recognition sites—PI-SceI, PI-PspI, I-SceI, and I-CeuI—into the vector; in this sequence (GAATTCgcggccgcggccggcccgggcTGCCATTTCATTACCTCTTTCTCCGCACCCGACATAGATtcttctACCCATAATACCCATAATAGCTGTTTGCCAtcttctTAGGGATAACAGGGTAATtcttctTCGCTACCTTAGGACCGTTATAGTTAggcgcgcctgcaggGCATGC), the upper case characters indicate, respectively, the following restriction enzyme recognition sites—EcoRI, PI-SceI, PI-PspI, I-SceI, I-CeuI, and SphI. The modified vector pHSG299_CSPS was amplified with two primers, CSPS-N2-CAA-u and CSPS-C2-u (Supplementary Table S1), and digested with two enzymes, SfiI and I-SceI. The digestion product was used for the last sequential ligation.2.6. Isolation of the ligation productsThe beads that contained the complete PRESSO product were first washed with 1.5 ml of TE buffer, and then rinsed with 200 µl of I-SceI buffer. The beads were then incubated with 50 U of I-SceI at 37°C for 2 h in 50 µl of I-SceI buffer. To release the DNA construct containing the array of fragments from the beads, the samples were heated at 60°C for 10 min with sodium dodecyl sulphate (final concentration, 0.1%), and the supernatant was collected. The DNA was precipitated with ethanol, and then dissolved in 200 µl of buffer that contained 350 U of E. coli DNA ligase (TAKARA BIO). The intra-molecular ligation was performed at 16°C for 2 h. The ligated DNA was precipitated with ethanol, dissolved in 10 µl of distilled water, and used to transform E. coli DH5-a cells.2.7. Antibiotic selectionTransformed E. coli were selected on LB plates that contained chloramphenicol (Cm), and the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (QIAGEN) was used to isolate the plasmid from cultures of transformed cells.2.8. DNA digestions and sequencingThe SfiI and I-SceI digestions have been described above. Many restriction enzymes—XbaI, BamHI, EcoRI, HindIII, KpnI, PstI, SacI, SalI, SphI, and PI-PspI (TOYOBO)—were used to confirm structure of the resultant plasmid (Fig. 3). The digestions were carried out according to the manufacturer's protocols. Each resultant plasmid was digested with I-SceI and PI-PspI to separate the insert DNA from the vector DNA. The insert DNA was then purified; aliquots of the purified insert DNA were then digested with each restriction enzyme in separate single-enzyme reactions (Fig. 3). The products of each digestion reaction were resolved via gel electrophoresis. The length of each product was compared with two sets of DNA size markers—1 kb plus DNA ladder (Invitrogen) and HMW DNA marker (Invitrogen)—to confirm the structure of the insert DNA. The size of each genomic DNA fragment that was included in the PRESSO array is listed in Supplementary Table S2. To estimate the sequence accuracy of insert DNA, four resultant plasmids with a 20-kb insert consisting of the array of 2.0 kb segments were sequenced. DNA sequences were determined using a Model 3730xI DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Forster City, CA, USA). Sequencing reactions were performed with the BigDye® Terminator version 3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Conformation of the PRESSO products. In each of three experiments, 10 different DNA fragments were ligated in an array along with a plasmid vector; the resulting plasmids were used to transform E. coli. Within each experiment; the lengths of all 10 DNA fragments were very similar 0.5, 1, or 2 kb; the inserts on resultant plasmids were 5, 10, or 20 kb, respectively, and were purified after the I-SceI and PI-PspI digestion; the isolated inserts were then used in 10 separate restriction digestion; each enzyme indicated was used to cut at 1 of the 10 segments in each of the three inserts. These restriction sites were designed in the primers for donor DNA amplification. The digested patterns were represented for the sequential ligation of 10 (A) 0.5, (B) 1, or (C) 2 kb DNA fragments. The lengths of digested DNA fragments were consistent with in the lengths of each individual donor DNA molecule listed in Supplementary Table S2. A SfiI site is also located at each connection between each pair of donor DNAs.Conformation of the PRESSO products.

A SfiI site is also located at each connection between each pair of donor DNAs.3. Results3.1. Experimental design and overview of a sequential ligation of multiple DNA fragmentsWe developed a PRESSO method that was based on non-palindromic sticky ends. In summary, there are three steps in PRESSO (Fig. 1). First, a biotin-conjugated linker DNA with a meganuclease restriction site, e.g. the I-SceI site, and a non-palindromic end cleaved by a restriction enzyme, e.g. SfiI or BstXI, is attached to streptavidin-linked beads. Secondly, each DNA fragment digested with SfiI is then ligated, in an ordered sequence of iterative ligation reactions, to the growing end of the DNA construct, which is attached to the streptavidin-linked beads via a biotin label at the opposite end. Thirdly, after the vector sequences are added in the final sequential ligation step, the biotin-conjugated spacer DNA is removed from the construct via I-SceI-catalyzed digestion, and the full-length linear DNA construct is circularized via an intra-molecular ligation to form a circular plasmid that is used to transform E. coli. Below, we describe the PRESSO method in detail.Non-palindromic sequences recognized by some restriction enzymes, such as SfiI and BstXI, are used in PRESSO. Cleavage at such sites can generate any desire 3'-overhanging single-stranded sequences; these overhangs are derived from the bp in the middle of the recognition site. For instance, the restriction enzymes, SfiI and BstXI, recognize the sequences GGCCNNNNNGGCC and CCANNNNNNTGG, respectively, and produce 3'-overhanging ends comprising bases, which are denoted ‘N’, from the middle bp; any nucleotide can occupy any ‘N’ position in an SfiI or BstXI site, and these enzymes produced three or four ‘N’ base-overhang ends, respectively. Non-complementary overhanging bases at each end of each DNA molecule prevent an intra-molecular ligation. In contrast, if the overhanging end of the donor molecule is complementary to the overhanging end of the acceptor molecule, the unpaired bases can form Watson–Crick base pairs between the donor and acceptor DNA molecules, and iterative ligation of such donor–acceptor pairs can produce an array of many DNA fragments that are arranged in defined orientations within a defined array sequence.PRESSO is carried out on a solid-phase, metallic streptavidin-conjugated beads, because these beads facilitate the removal of reaction intermediates after each ligation reaction, and this process precludes intra-molecular ligation (Fig. 1). The solid phase permits repeated cycles of digestion, purification, and ligation. Streptavidin-conjugated magnetic beads were chosen as the solid phase, because streptavidin binds with high affinity to biotinylated oligonucleotides, and the interaction is sufficiently strong and stable during DNA manipulations.14 The beads were also convenient for experimental handling, because they do not bind unlabelled DNA molecules. The initial double-strand DNA molecule (acceptor DNA) was designed to contain a biotinylated 5'-end and 3'-overhanging bases. The acceptor DNA was amplified with a 5'-biotinylated oligonucleotide and unlabelled primers, was cleaved with a non-palindromic restriction enzyme to generate a 3'-overhanging sequence that was complementary to the overhanging sequence on the first donor DNA molecules, and was then attached to the streptavidin beads.The donor DNA can be prepared either by subcloning into a vector that contains non-palindromic restriction sites or by PCR amplification with appropriate primers. Subsequent digestion of the vector or PCR products with the non-palindromic enzyme, such as SfiI, generates the donor DNA molecules with sticky ends. We purified donor DNA fragments by electrophoresis to remove undigested donor molecules and to remove any cleaved vector fragments that have overhang ends complementary to those of the donor molecules. These purification steps are especially critical for high yields when attempting to join multiple DNA fragments in a defined sequence, because ‘terminated’ molecules will accumulate as a result of incomplete digestion in each ligation cycle, and these ‘terminated’ molecules reduce the yield of the desired molecule. To avoid this problem, we used 5'-biotinylated primers to PCR amplify the donor molecules (Fig. 2); the PCR products were digested with SfiI, then mixed with streptavidin-linked beads, and finally, the unbound fully digested donor fragments were recovered from the supernatant; in contrast, ‘terminated’ partially digested molecules remained bound to the beads. This procedure allowed for the selection of completely digested non-palindromic ends and the successful sequential joining of 10 donor DNA molecules. The purified donor DNA was ligated to the 3'-end of acceptor DNA, which was bound to the beads. After each ligation, the liquid solution was removed and the beads were washed with buffer to accommodate addition of the next donor DNA molecules with non-palindromic ends. Repeated cycles of this procedure allowed the sequential addition of DNA fragments onto the growing acceptor molecules, which were fixed to the solid phase.The release of the final composite DNA molecules from the solid support was achieved via digestion with the meganuclease I-SceI, and an I-SceI site had been engineered into the initial biotin-labelled linker acceptor fragment and into the final donor vector fragment. The I-SceI restriction enzyme recognizes an 18-bp sequence, which is rarely present in any naturally occurring genome. Other commercially available meganucleases, such as I-CeuI, could also be used for this purpose. Thus, we performed the sequential ligation on the solid phase. Here, as an example, we connected 10 DNA fragments derived from Chromosome 5 of the Arabidopsis genome.3.2. Construction of a plasmid carrying 10 DNA fragments from ArabidopsisWe conducted three prototypical experiments; for each experiment, 10 different donor DNA fragments all of approximately the same length (0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 kb in Experiments A, B, and C, respectively; Fig. 3) were prepared, and each contained a unique restriction site so that the structure of each final plasmid construct could be determined (Supplementary Table S2). On Day 1, we amplified the biotin-conjugated spacer DNA, which included I-SceI and SfiI recognition sequences from the pUC19-I-SceI plasmid and was used for all three experiments; this DNA was digested with SfiI and attached to streptavidin-coated beads as the initial acceptor DNA. For each experiment, 10 unique fragments were prepared as donor DNA fragments; within an individual experiment, all 10 fragments were approximately the same length (0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 kb), but each had a distinct SfiI site and a unique restriction site engineered into the primer. For all experiments, all amplified donor DNA fragments were digested with SfiI, to produce distinct 3'-overhanging bases. Because undigested DNA fragments were removed from the solution by the streptavidin-linked beads, digested fragment could be purified from the supernatants and used as donor DNA molecules. On Day 2, five of each set of 10 DNA fragments were sequentially ligated to acceptor DNA on the streptavidin-linked beads; on Day 3, the remaining five donor molecules from each set of 10 were ligated to the acceptor arrays. After each sequential ligation reaction, the beads were washed, and the newly elongated construct was used as the acceptor molecule in the next ligation. The iterative reactions resulted in three separate arrays, each with 10 distinct DNA segments aligned in defined orientations and defined sequences. In each of the three experiments, the modified pHSG299 vector (pHSG299_CSPS), which encoded a chloramphenicol resistance gene and I-CeuI, I-SceI, PI-PspI, and PI-SceI recognition sequences, was used as the last donor molecule in the final sequential ligation.15 The vector was digested with SfiI and ligated to the 3'-overhang bases on final segment of the insert array, which was still attached to the streptavidin-linked beads. Each of the three final products of the sequential ligations was cleaved with I-SceI to release it from the original biotin-labelled acceptor molecule and therefore, the streptavidin-linked beads. These free linear molecules, which each contained 10 distinct segments and a vector backbone, were circularized via an intra-molecular ligation; the circular constructs were then used to transform E. coli. The E. coli cells were cultured on LB plates that contained chloramphenicol overnight. On Day 4, chloramphenicol-resistant clones were isolated for plasmid preparation.3.3. Confirmation of plasmids carrying 10 DNA fragmentsTo determine whether the plasmids contain our expected sequences, we digested the plasmid with restriction enzymes specific for the 10 segments within each array. First, we separated the insert DNA, the array of 10 segments, from the pHSG299_CSPS backbone by digestion with I-SceI and PI-PspI, which was followed by elution via gel electrophoresis. To determine whether arrays were arranged as expected, we performed 10 separate digests for each of the three predicted inserts; each digest contained a distinct restriction enzyme that was targeted to a specific segment within an array (Fig. 3). The predicted sizes of the DNA segment within the arrays containing 0.5, 1, or 2 kb segments are listed in Supplementary Table S2. The sizes of the DNA fragments that resulted from the restriction digests were consistent with these estimated segment lengths; therefore, each of the three inserts seemed to include the expected 10 segments in the expected order and orientation (Fig. 3). As we were also anxious about the efficiency of the sequential ligation, we investigated how many plasmids contained all 10 DNA of the expected segments in a single experiment. To assess this, we isolated 12 plasmids carrying the inserts with an array of 2.0 kb segments, and the plasmids were digested with two restriction enzymes, I-SceI and PI-PspI, to separate the insert from the vector backbone. For arrays generated from the 2-kb fragments, the insert DNA from 9 of the 12 plasmids was ~19.8 kb length, the insert DNA from one plasmid was ~2 kb length, and other two plasmids carried no insert, suggesting that ~75% of these transformants contained the expected constructs.To estimate transformation efficiency of the plasmids obtained using the PRESSO method, we connected 2–10 DNA fragments to produce plasmids harbouring the inserts with an array of 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 kb segments. In any case of PRESSO with <10 segments with up to 2.0 kb inserts, we found more than tens of colonies, even though increasing size of DNA fragments and cycling reactions reduced the efficiency (Fig. 4). Further, we isolated plasmids and investigated the insert length as described above. When we connected more than six DNA fragments using the PRESSO reactions, some plasmids included unexpected inserts. However, even when we connected 2 kb DNA fragments into an array of 10 segments, at least 10 colonies carrying our desired plasmid with correct size were isolated in our study. Thus, the efficiency of PRESSO is sufficient enough to connect multiple DNA fragments. Effects of DNA length and ligation cycles. We ligated 2–10 DNA fragments of 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 kb segments into the vector pHSG299_CSPS, and then transformed E. coli. The number of transformed colonies was shown. The error bars are standard deviations (SD).Effects of DNA length and ligation cycles. We ligated 2–10 DNA fragments of 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 kb segments into the vector pHSG299_CSPS, and then transformed E. coli. The number of transformed colonies was shown. The error bars are standard deviations (SD).Further, to investigate the accuracy of the PCR and the ligation reactions, we pick up 4 of 9 correct plasmids as examples, and determined the sequence of inserts within the arrays containing 2 kb segments. One of the four plasmids carried the insert with a correct sequence, and other three plasmids included a couple of errors in the insert sequences. We found total of five errors only in the junction sequences, which were originated as synthetic oligonucleotide PCR primers to amplify multiple DNA fragments. The errors found in the nucleotide sequence produced by the chemical synthesis are reportedly between 160 and 1394 bp per error.10 In contrast, PRESSO resulted in a ~15 840 correct bp for each incorrect bp based on the DNA sequence data; as total of five errors were detected in four clones of 19.8 kb inserts, and the error ratio was estimated as five errors/4 × 19.8 kb = 1/15 840. However, the errors in junction sequences ordinary will not affect the further analyses.4. DiscussionHere, we describe PRESSO, a method for arranging multiple DNA fragments into a single-defined array; this method is an up-to-date technology for handling multiple genes. The solid phase allows researchers to conduct iterative sets of reactions; each set includes a restriction digest, purification, and ligation; in this way, multiple fragments can be arranged into a single-defined array. In this study, we produced a large plasmid that contained a 5, 10, or 20 kb insert, which comprised 10 segments in defined orientations and a defined order. Ligation reactions that join sets of multiple DNA fragments are carried out as a routine task in our laboratory (data not shown). By combining PRESSO with standard cloning techniques, we were able to ligate 22 DNA fragments together in an array that encoded seven functional genes involved in astaxanthin synthesis, and confirmed that this construct indeed functions in transgenic plants15 (also see below).PRESSO has some advantages over other methods of DNA cloning; these advantages include high accuracy and efficiency. Although many methods for ligating multiple DNA fragments together have been developed previously, some of these methods that involve non-palindromic enzymes or Gateway systems can be used to connect only three or four DNA fragments together.16,17 These step-by-step methods are more time consuming than the PRESSO method. In methods, such as PAM or the In-Fusion system, all reactions were performed in a single tube without a solid phase;10–12 consequently, all DNA fragments are ligated together simultaneously, and the methods are faster than PRESSO. However, these methods that lack stepwise reactions produce undesired DNA sequences, caused by disorder or mismatched ligations. In fact, with the In-Fusion system, the number of transformants recovered decreases as the number of DNA fragments increases.11 In contrast, PRESSO, which depends on stepwise reactions on a solid phase, allows us to connect up to 10 cassettes precisely as shown in this study, and a longer DNA fragment in a plasmid can be prepared by ligating building blocks in which up to 10 DNA fragments are incorporated using the PRESSO protocol as shown in our previous research.15 By using each DNA fragments with distinct overhang ends, we could avoid disorder or mismatched ligations as seen in the previous methods.10–12 In our preliminary experiments, although we carried out the ligation reactions with same overhang sequences repeatedly in one assemble, we could not isolate our designed plasmids harbouring multiple DNA fragments; by skipping internal DNA fragments, many plasmids included less DNA segments than those that we desired. Using the distinct overhang ends is essential for the reaction. Recent reports about a fast ligation based on an automatable solid-phase high-throughput (FLASH) system for TALEffector nucleases (TALENs), which encode sequence-specific artificial nucleases, have also allowed for iterative ligations on a solid phase.18 Thus, PRESSO is effective for repeated ligation reactions.The PRESSO allows us to connect multiple DNA fragments together with the high sequence accuracy. In many previous reports, chemical nucleotide syntheses coupled with PCR and ligation reactions have been used to produce giant DNAs.13,19 The nucleotide sequences produced by chemical syntheses contain more errors than standard PCR or cloning as described in our results and in a previous report.10 Such undesired mutations in the oligonucleotides are also seen in long-range PCR primers, which are synthesized for the polymerase cycling assembly or for production of the overhanging ends. As long-range PCR for overlap extensions in PAM requires a low-fidelity but high-efficiency polymerase, the amplification of >20 kb of DNA often contains multiple errors.12,20 In contrast to the previous reports,12,20 the PRESSO system can suppress nucleotide substitutions as shown in our results, because DNA fragments can be designed to be short enough to be amplified with a high-fidelity polymerase.An important goal in biotechnology is to transfer multiple genes into an organism, so that they function in vivo. Using PRESSO, we were able to link 24 DNA fragments to create a single construct comprising a plasmid vector, a single enhancer, and seven functional genes involved in astaxanthin synthesis each within a separate cassette that included a promoter and a operator.15 We then introduced the constructed plasmid into plants and confirmed that astaxanthin was synthesized in the transgenic plants.15 A decade ago, simultaneous introduction via co-bombardment of multiple independent DNA molecules (genes) into rice cells was described.21 However, this co-bombardment approach required that many transformant populations had to be generated and screened to recover the desired transgenic plants for the presence of multiple genes, because the transgenic plants that harboured the desired combination of genes were very rare. This type of strategy is feasible for only some crops, such as rice or tobacco plants, that are readily transformed with high efficiency. In contrast, the PRESSO system described here will facilitate the introduction of a set of genes for a certain metabolic pathway from one species into another species even when the host species supports only low transformation rates. This capability system will open up new opportunities for the production of valuable materials in an easily manageable organism for both basic research and industrial purposes.A RIKEN Arabidopsis full-length (RAFL) cDNA library (RIKEN, Japan) is a well-established library generated from the Arabidopsis genome; this library covered ~17 000 of the protein-coding sequences from Arabidopsis, and each sequence was constructed with an SfiI site.22,23 Such full-length cDNA clones engineered with a non-palindromic restriction enzyme site can be used for PRESSO without PCR amplification of genes. By using available DNA clones, PRESSO becomes a powerful tool because it is quicker, more precise, and more cost-effective than the previously described methods.To generate transgenic organisms that express multiple heterologous genes, adaptor cassettes that contain a promoter or reporter may be required. By coupling PRESSO with such cassettes that also include sequences complementally to the ends of cDNA clones, many cDNAs could be directly ligated together in tandem. In our PRESSO system described here, each donor DNA molecule contains designed linker sequences. We believe that this strategy is not problematic in most of the cases, especially for the joining functional genes (as demonstrated in the previous reports15). However, if a specific junction sequence is required, as in the case of in-frame ligation of certain protein-coding sequences, Type IIS restriction endonucleases, such as FokI, could be used. Such nucleases cut DNA at the outside sequence of their non-palindromic recognition sites. Site-directed mutagenesis is another approach that could be used to change a sequence as desired after a based plasmid has been constructed.Multiple PRESSO reactions can be carried out in parallel. Currently, we are working on the simultaneous syntheses of multiple sequential ligation sets; these sets were designed based on network analyses, such as transcriptome or metabolome studies.3,4,6,7 Our approach will greatly facilitate the comprehensive characterization of gene function that is currently underway in various organisms.Supplementary DataSupplementary Data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by the ‘Innovation Technology for the Earth Program, Development of Transgenic Plants for Production of Industrial Materials Project’ from the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) as a part of the ‘Green Biotechnology Program’, in coordination with the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI); it was also supported in part by the Kazusa DNA Research Institute Foundation.We thank Yumiko Shirano for useful suggestions of connecting DNA molecules with sticky ends produced by the restriction enzyme SfiI, and Junko Takatsu, Eri Okuyama, and Misa Ki for their technical assistance.Supplementary data"

IntroductionTomato (Solanum lycopersicum), which is considered to be an important crop, originated from South and Central America, and spread to the rest of the world with accompanying morphological diversification.1 The Solanaceae family, to which tomato belongs, includes other important crop species, such as potato (S. tuberosum), eggplant (S. melongena), tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), and pepper (Capsicum annuum). Comparative genomics within these various genera and species have greatly accelerated understanding of their genome evolution and the genetic mechanisms that confer phenotypic diversity to these species.2 Furthermore, several interspecific genetic linkage maps have been constructed between cultivated tomato and its wild relatives (S. chmielewskii, S. habrochaites, S. pennellii, and S. pimpinellifolium).3 These maps allow identification of the genes responsible for interspecific phenotypic variations, including disease resistance, fruit size and shape, and plant architecture.3 However, few genetic studies have reported intraspecific variations due to its narrow genetic diversity.3,4In the field of human and animal genomic and genetic studies, the availability of whole-genome sequence data has resulted in more rapid advances in re-sequencing analysis and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) than in classical genetics and quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping.5,6 In plants such as rice (Oryza sativa) and Arabidopsis thaliana, the initial plant species for which whole-genome sequences were available provided representative targets for such analysis.7–10Tomato has also been used as a model plant in classical and molecular genetics,11 due to autogamous diploidy (2n = 2x = 24) and a relatively compact genome (~950 Mb). Recently, the whole-genome sequence of tomato was published.12 Furthermore, Hirakawa et al.13 inferred the functions of 200 SNPs among the transcribed sequences of cultivated tomato lines by determining their positions in predicted genes on the tomato genome. These results are expected to accelerate the understanding of genetic mechanisms that confer phenotypic variations among tomato cultivars.Massive parallel sequencing and genotyping methods have contributed to progress in genetics and genomics. Next-generation sequencers (NGSs), such as HiSeq2500 (Illumina), the GS FLX+ system (Roche), 5500xl SOLiD (Life Technologies), and Ion Proton (Life Technologies), have been employed for de novo assembly of genome sequences and re-sequencing analyses of genomes of several organisms.14,15 In such re-sequencing analysis, sequence reads from the whole genome are mapped onto the reference genome to identify nucleotide variations, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertions/deletions (indels).14 A large amount of nucleotide sequence data (up to Mb- or Gb-scale), redundantly covering the whole-genome sequence, can be obtained simultaneously by NGS technologies. This allows a huge number of the nucleotide variations to be identified cheaply and within a relatively short period of time. The identified SNPs can be used, for example, for polymorphic analysis of germplasm collections, which, in turn, allows genetic analyses such as QTL mapping, GWAS, and genomic selection.16 Large-scale SNP genotyping is often performed with commercially available array-based platforms, such as Infinium (Illumina), GoldenGate (Illumina), and Axiom Genotyping Solution (Affymetrix).Tomato accessions, so-called genetic resources, are stocked in several gene banks, including the Tomato Genetic Resource Center (TGRC), USA (http://tgrc.ucdavis.edu); the National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences (NIAS) Genebank, Japan (http://www.gene.affrc.go.jp); and the NARO Institute of Vegetable and Tea Science (NIVTS), Japan (http://www.naro.affrc.go.jp/vegetea). In the NIAS and NIVTS Genebanks, over 1500 tomato lines have been deposited from >50 countries. The morphological traits of each line are recorded when the plants are reproduced, whereas DNA-based genetic variation has not yet been evaluated. By combining massive parallel sequencing and high-throughput genotyping technologies, it is now possible to probe genome-wide genetic diversity in the large number of tomato accessions currently available. In addition, associations between genetic and phenotypic variations can be identified in the genetic resources by using morphological traits recorded in the NIVTS and NIAS Genebanks. These studies would provide useful knowledge for molecular genetic analysis and breeding. In this study, we re-sequenced six tomato lines to discover novel SNPs that could be used to estimate the ratio of the SNPs contributing to the phenotypic variation. The identified candidate SNPs were used for GWAS to predict the loci responsible for agronomically important traits, e.g. fruit size and shape and plant architecture.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Plant materials and DNA isolationSix inbred lines, ‘Ailsa Craig’ (AIC), ‘Furikoma’ (FRK), ‘M82’ (M82), ‘Tomato Chuukanbonhon Nou 11’ (PL11), ‘Ponderosa’ (PON), and ‘Regina’ (REG), which were selected as representative lines from the clusters in the phylogenetic tree obtained in our previous study,13 were used for whole-genome re-sequencing (Supplementary Table S1). AIC and PON are greenhouse types, and FRK and M82 are processing types suited for field cultivation. PL11 is a breeding material developed at the NIVTS for a short-internode trait,17 and REG is a dwarf tomato with cherry-type fruits obtained from Sakata Seeds Co., Japan. All materials except for REG are available from the NIVTS, Japan.The number of genotyped tomato accessions with SNPs was 663, of which 641, 9, 6, 5, 1, and 1 were derived from the NIVTS, Japan; five private companies (De Ruiter Seeds Co., The Netherlands; Sakata Seeds Co., Japan; Suntory Holdings Ltd., Japan; Takii Seeds Co., Japan; and Vilmorin Seeds Co., France); the TGRC at the University of California, USA; the National BioResource Project (NBRP) at the University of Tsukuba, Japan; Cornell University, USA; and the Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA), France, respectively (Supplementary Table S1). Total genomic DNA was isolated from leaves of a single plant from each line using a DNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen).2.2. Whole-genome re-sequencing and identification of SNP candidatesTotal genomic DNA from the six lines, such as AIC, FRK, M82, PL11, PON, and REG, was used for whole-genome shotgun sequencing according to the standard protocol (Life Technologies). The nucleotide sequences were determined using the 5500xl SOLiD sequencer (Life Technologies) in the paired-end mode (35 + 75 bases). The data obtained were mapped onto the reference genome sequence of ‘Heinz 1706’ (H1706) ver. SL2.4012 for SNP discovery using the LifeScope Genomic Analysis software (Life Technologies) with default parameters. When heterozygous SNPs were discovered in any one of six lines, they were manually excluded from the list of SNP candidates.The SNP candidates were classified into seven groups according to ITAG2.3 predictions of the gene positions on the tomato genome12 as follows: intergenic SNPs, SNPs at the donor and acceptor splice sites bordering two bases of introns, intron SNPs, SNPs at untranslated regions (UTRs), synonymous SNPs, missense SNPs, and nonsense SNPs. The functional categories of tomato genes predicted in the ITAG2.312 were assigned by BLASTP18 searches against the eukaryotic orthologous groups (KOG) database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/COG), with E-value cut-off of 1E-4.19SNP2CAPS20 and dCAPS Finder 2.021 were used for developing cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) and derived CAPS (dCAPS) markers, respectively. Oligonucleotides for the markers were designed using the PRIMER3 software.222.3. SNP genotypingA total of 1536 SNPs were selected for Illumina GoldenGate SNP genotyping of the 663 tomato accessions. The Illumina GoldenGate assay and subsequent SNP calling were performed as described by Shirasawa et al.23 Polymorphic analysis of CAPS and dCAPS markers including FAS, SP, and OVATE23,24 was performed as described by Shirasawa et al.232.4. Data analysisThe genetic distances and Jaccard's similarity coefficients of all combinations of any two accessions were calculated from the genotypic data using the GGT2 software25 as described by Shirasawa et al.26 A dendrogram of the genetic resources was established using the neighbor-joining method in the MEGA5 software.27Principal component analysis (PCA) was also performed to determine the relationship between samples using the TASSEL software,28 in which SNPs with minor allele frequencies (MAFs) of <0.05 were removed and the number of components was limited to three.The STRUCTURE software,29 in which SNPs with MAFs of >0.00 were included, was used to assess the genetic relationships of the investigated lines. The degree of admixture in each line was estimated under the conditions of a 100 000 burn-in period and 100 000 Markov Chain Monte Carlo replications. The ideal number of clusters (K) was estimated from the output of 20 independent calculations as described by Evanno et al.30Linkage disequilibriums (LDs) of all SNP pairs on each chromosome were detected using the Haploview software31 with the following parameters: MAF, =0.05; Hardy–Weinberg P-value cut-off, 0; and percentage of genotyped lines, =0.75. Haplotypes and tag SNPs were predicted based on the estimated LD blocks according to the definition of Gabriel et al.32Associations between genotypes and phenotypes were analysed using the mixed linear model (MLM) using the TASSEL program28 with the following parameters: MAF of =0.05. In the association analysis, we considered the kinship matrix based on the SNP data in the model of MLM, while population structure was excluded from the model since it could not be detected in the tomato accessions with the STRUCTURE analysis. The thresholds for the association were set to a –logP of >5.06 and 4.36 at a significant level of 1 and 5%, respectively, after Bonferroni multiple test correction.On NIAS Genebank databases (http://www.gene.affrc.go.jp), 71 phenotypic traits are registered for 9–479 accessions (the numbers of investigated lines differ depending on the traits) as actual measured numeric data, qualitative data, and ranked data. They were investigated in the field and/or under greenhouse conditions over a number of years (1983–2011) at multiple locations (seven sites in Japan and Taiwan). The phenotypic data for each accession redundantly recorded in multi-years and locations were averaged, so that the data could be regarded as continuous numerical data for the MLM. Of these, 23 traits that scored in >100 lines genotyped in this study were tested for the GWAS.3. Results3.1. Whole-genome shotgun re-sequencing of cultivated tomatoWhole-genome shotgun re-sequencing was performed for the six inbred tomato lines, such as AIC, FRK, M82, PL11, PON, and REG. DNA samples tagged with line-specific index sequences were subjected to sequencing analysis using the 5500xl SOLiD sequencer (Life Technologies) in the paired-end mode (75 + 35 bases) (Table 1). A total of 708.3 million read pairs corresponding to 77.9 Gb DNA were obtained (13.7× mean depth for each line). In the subsequent in silico analysis with the LifeScope Genomic Analysis software (Life Technologies), 53.9% of the obtained sequences covered 93.4% of the reference genome sequence of H1706 ver. SL2.4012 at 9.2× coverage on average for each line (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S2). The other 46.1% reads were omitted from the mapping results due to the low quality of the reads and repetitive sequences in the tomato genome.

Identification of SNP candidates and their positions on the tomato genomeWithin the mapped sequence reads, a total of 2 011 984 SNP candidates were discovered between H1706 (SL2.40ch01 to SL2.40ch12) and the re-sequenced lines. Heterozygous and triallelic SNPs were often observed among the identified SNP candidates. They were considered false positives and were excluded from further analysis. As a result, a total of 1 473 798 SNPs, consisting of 836 676 transition and 637 122 transversion mutations, were identified as confident biallelic SNP candidates (Fig. 1, http://www.kazusa.or.jp/tomato), for which accuracy was validated using the GoldenGate assay described below. Among these, 170 173 SNPs were confirmed by their convertibility to CAPS markers (http://www.kazusa.or.jp/tomato), which are considered a useful tool for conventional DNA polymorphic analysis.

Heterochromatic regions are indicated by vertical lines on the right of the chromosomes. Names of genes identified by map-based cloning in previous studies are shown on the right of the chromosomes.Different numbers of SNPs with respect to H1706 were observed in each line, e.g. 85 534 in PON, 85 670 in AIC, 120 329 in FRK, 245 730 in PL11, 710 904 in M82, and 1 102 982 in REG (Supplementary Table S3). SNP density with respect to H1706 was calculated to be, on average, one SNP per 516 bp (0.19%), and ranged from 1 SNP/689 bp (0.15%) in REG to 1 SNP/8884 bp (0.01%) in AIC, assuming a 760 Mb genome size for SL2.40 (Supplementary Table S3). The SNPs were unevenly distributed across the genomes, i.e. a remarkably large number of SNPs were observed on Chromosome 11 (Chr11) in PL11; Chr04, Chr05, and Chr11 in M82; and Chr04, Chr05, and Chr12 in REG. At the chromosomal segment level, the numbers of SNPs ranged from 1 (88–89 Mb position of Chr01 in M82) to 10 847 (34–35 Mb position of Chr05 in REG) using a 1-Mb window scale (Fig. 1).The identified SNP candidates were classified into seven groups according to their positions in predicted genes on the tomato genome sequence (see Section 2 for details). Of the 1 473 798 SNP candidates, 998, 279, 110, and 1 were redundantly mapped onto two, three, four, and five gene models, respectively, while the other 1 472 410 SNPs were positioned on a single gene model. As a result, a total of 1 475 688 SNP sites in gene models were targeted for classification. Among them, 1 316 332 (89.2%) were in intergenic spaces, corresponding to DNA sequences located between genes, including UTRs. The other 159 356 SNPs (10.8%) were in genic regions, of which 110 315 (7.5%) and 49 041 (3.3%) were in introns and exons, respectively (Table 2). The number of SNPs potentially affecting gene function was 22 805 (1.5%), including 156 SNPs at splice sites in introns, 558 resulting in nonsense codons, and 22 091 of missense codons. The number of SNPs categorized into seven classesThe number of SNPs categorized into seven classesThe functions of genes having or not having the SNPs were investigated. First, a total of the 34 348 tomato genes predicted in the ITAG2.312 were classified into the three groups: 508 genes having nonsense SNPs (Group 1); 9436 genes having nonsynoymous SNPs including nonsense, missense SNPs, and SNPs at splice junctions (Group 2); and 24 404 genes not classified in the Group 2 (Group 3). BLASTP was then used to compare the protein sequences with those in the KOG database.19 The 15 974 predicted genes were classified into KOG categories. The distributions of the categories were similar between the Groups 2 and 3 (Supplementary Fig. S1). In the Group 3, on the other hand, the proportions of the Categories C (energy production and conversion) and T (signal transduction mechanisms) were relatively prominent, while those of the Categories M (cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis), O (post-translational modification, protein turnover, and chaperones), U (intracellular trafficking, secretion, and vesicular transport), Y (nuclear structure), and Z (cytoskeleton) were conversely low (Supplementary Fig. S1).3.3. SNP genotyping of tomato accessions by the Illumina GoldenGate assayTo select SNPs showing high polymorphism in the accessions, the 1 473 798 SNPs were filtered by the following criteria: (i) a LifeScope score of 0.000000; (ii) a 3:4 SNP segregation ratio in seven plant lines (H1706 and the six re-sequenced lines), or PL11-specific SNPs, or SNPs specific to two lines including PL11 [the later two criteria were set because the PL11 line is considered to be closely related to many modern F1 hybrid cultivars (Fukuoka, personal communication)]; (iii) SNPs showing different segregation patterns among the seven lines within 3-cM windows covering whole genomes of a total length of 1500 cM;33 and (iv) an Illumina SNP score of >0.6, as determined on the Illumina website (https://icom.illumina.com). Using these criteria, 1235 SNPs were selected (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table S4). An additional 301 SNPs with MAFs of >0.3 and an Illumina SNP score of 1.0 were selected based on data reported in our previous studies.13,23A total of 663 tomato accessions (listed in Supplementary Table S1) were genotyped with the 1536 SNPs using the GoldenGate assay. As a result, 1293 SNPs were successfully genotyped in the 663 accessions, satisfying the criteria of the GenomeStudio Data Analysis software (Illumina). Of the 1293 SNPs, 1248 (96.5%) and 1147 (88.7%) showed segregations within the 663 accessions within the threshold of MAFs of >0 and =0.05, respectively (Supplementary Table S4). The MAF values of the 1248 SNPs were evenly distributed from 0.001 to 0.5, and no significant differences in the distribution of the MAF values of the seven SNP categories were observed (data not shown). The ratios of heterozygous alleles and null alleles were high in the seven F1 hybrids and three wild species, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S2). The higher ratio in the three wild species could reflect polymorphisms at the probe annealing sites.23 In contrast, few heterozygous or null alleles were observed in the 23 inbred lines.3.4. Clustering analyses of the tomato accessionsThe genetic distances between all combinations of any pairs in the 663 tomato accessions were calculated based on the genotypes of the 1248 SNPs. The genetic distances among the 663 accessions ranged from 0.00 to 0.72, with an average of 0.39. No obvious clusters were observed in the dendrogram of the genetic distances (Supplementary Fig. S3A). To evaluate this result, the genetic relationships between the accessions were determined by PCA, which showed that there were no clusters in the 663 lines (Supplementary Fig. S3B), because the individual proportions for PC1, 2, and 3 were 0.09, 0.06, and 0.05, respectively. Genetic relationship analysis using the STRUCTURE software indicated that there was no population structure in the accessions (Supplementary Fig. S3C). This is in contrast to the six clusters identified by the delta-K method reported by Evanno et al.303.5. Linkage disequilibrium and haplotype identificationsBecause no clear genetic structure was observed in the 663 accessions, LD across the tomato genome in these lines was investigated (Fig. 2, Supplementary Figs S4 and S5). A total of 123 LD blocks, i.e. chromosome sections showing significant LD (based on the definition of Gabriel et al.32) between each pair of located SNPs, were observed across chromosomes (Supplementary Table S4). The 123 LD blocks comprised a total of 458 SNPs. The average length of the LD blocks was 3.2 Mb, ranging from 256 bp in Chr10 between solcap_snp_sl_8260 and SL2.40ch10_59989140W to 58.3 Mb in Chr01 between SL2.40ch01_7886746R and SL2.40ch01_66149134Y (Supplementary Table S4). The lengths of LD blocks containing heterochromatic regions (average, 13.8 Mb) were longer than that in euchromatic regions (average, 58 kb) (Supplementary Table S4). LD measures; r2 values against physical distance (Mb) between all pairs of SNPs located on the same chromosome.LD measures; r2 values against physical distance (Mb) between all pairs of SNPs located on the same chromosome.A total of 437 haplotypes were identified in the 123 LD blocks. An LD block had an average of 3.6 haplotypes consisting of an average of 3.7 SNPs (data now shown). Subsequently, 308 tag SNPs, the minimum SNP subset required for distinguishing haplotypes, were selected from the 458 SNPs located in the 123 LD blocks (Supplementary Table S4).3.6. GWAS for agronomical traits in genetic resourcesGWAS identified a total of nine SNP loci that were significantly associated with eight morphological traits recorded in the NIVTS and NIAS Genebanks (Fig. 3, Table 3, and Supplementary Fig. S6). The eight traits were phenotyped by actual measured numeric data, qualitative data, and ranked data, and comprised inflorescence branching (nine ranks), plant habit determinate (indeterminante or determinate), plant height (cm), number of leaves between inflorescences (number of leaves), fruit size (10 ranks), locule number (five ranks), green shoulder on immature fruit (10 ranks), and the colour of the fruit epidermis (colorless or yellow), of which the numbers of scored lines were 476, 478, 457, 111, 479, 474, 452, and 137, respectively (Supplementary Table S1 and Fig. S7).

Distribution of SNPs associated with inflorescence branching. SNPs that associated significantly (-logP of 4.36 at a significant level of 5%) are indicated by arrows.Among the eight traits, inflorescence branching was associated with two SNP loci, SL2.40ch02_41751976Y and solcap_snp_sl_39457 (Fig. 3 and Table 3). The SNP SL2.40ch02_41751976Y not belonging to any LD block was located at a distance of 4.8 and 1.6 Mb from the previously identified S (Solyc02g077390) and AN (Solyc02g081670) genes involved in compound inflorescence,34 respectively. The other seven morphological traits were significantly associated with seven SNP loci (Table 3 and Supplementary Fig. S6). Of the seven SNPs not belonging to any LD block, five were located near previously identified genes responsible for the targeted traits. These were SL2.40ch06_42601581W located at 240 kb from SP (Solyc06g074350),35 which is associated with plant habit determinate, plant height, and the number of leaves between inflorescences; SL1_00sc6004_2094360_solcap_snp_sl_44897, located at 31 kb from FAS (Solyc11g071810),36 which is associated with fruit size; SL1_00sc6004_2094360_solcap_snp_sl_44897, located at 31 kb from FAS (Solyc11g071810);36 SL2.40ch02_41172086R, located at 594 kb from LC (Solyc02g083940 and/or Solyc02g083950),37 and 1.8 Mb from OVATE (Solyc02g085500),38 which are associated with locule number; SL2.40ch10_1539862R, located at 753 kb from U (Solyc10g008160),39 which is associated with green shoulder on immature fruit; and SL2.40ch01_71279371Y, located at 24 kb from Y (Solyc01g079620),40 which is associated with colour of the fruit epidermis. To investigate association between the genes conferring the traits, polymorphic analysis of SP, FAS, LC, OVATE, and U was performed (Supplementary Table S5). The replicated GWAS including the five loci showed that SP, U, and FAS were strongly associated with these traits (Table 3).4. DiscussionThe re-sequencing analysis presented here identified a large number of SNP candidates in the cultivated tomato, S. lycopersicum, in which DNA polymorphisms have been difficult to detect.4,23 This has been attributed to its narrow genetic diversity, which was caused by the genetic bottlenecks that occurred during its domestication, cultivation, and breeding.41 The intraspecies SNP density of 0.19% was approximately three times lower than that of 0.6% between S. lycopersicum and S. pimpinellifolium.12 The distribution of the SNPs on the reference sequence of H1706 was not evenly spaced over the genome as reported by Asamizu et al.42 (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table S2). In the H1706 genome, large introgressions are observed in Chr04, 09, 11, and 12, which has implications for the introduction of disease resistance loci into H1706 from S. pimpinellifolium.12 The biased SNP density observed in this study also suggests the presence of introgressions of genome segments from wild relatives in tomato breeding processes for disease resistance.12SNPs are abundant sequence alterations that can affect gene function. Among the seven inbred tomato lines (including H1706), 558 nonsense, and 22 091 missense, and 17 410 synonymous SNPs were found in 508 (1.5%), 9285 (26.7%), and 7825 (22.5%) of 34 727 predicted genes, respectively (Table 2). Between S. lycopersicum and S. pimpinellifolium, 3.5, 36.3, and 37.0% of genes contain nonsense, missense, and synonymous mutations.12 The ratio of interspecies nonsense mutations to intraspecies nonsense mutations is 2.3, while the ratios of missense mutations and synonymous variations were 1.4 and 1.6, respectively. This result suggests that the alleles of wild relatives possessing SNPs that critically disrupt gene function, i.e. nonsense SNP, have been negatively selected from the gene pool of wild relatives for the purpose of breeding.The tomato accessions used in this study included broad genetic diversities (Supplementary Figs S2 and S3). Genome-wide LD analysis based on these accessions revealed that the extension of the LD was dependent on the nature of the chromatin (Supplementary Fig. S4 and Supplementary Table S4). Similar observations have been reported for interspecific F2 mapping populations in tomato, which indicated that chromosome recombination in heterochromatin is strongly suppressed compared with that in euchromatin.33,43 LD analysis of whole genomes have been previously performed not only for tomato, but also for rice, soybean, and Arabidopsis.7–10,13,44–46 However, LDs specific to chromatin have not been investigated. It is expected that chromosome recombination over the genome is not appreciably different between the accessions and biparental mapping populations.GWAS revealed SNPs that were associated with agronomically important traits (Fig. 3, Table 3, and Supplementary Fig. S6), and three genes (FAS, SP, and U) were found to confer trait variations (Table 3). Although such genes have been previously identified by a map-based cloning strategy, with interspecific populations conferring phenotypic variations between cultivated tomato and its wild relatives, the present results indicated that these genes are responsible for phenotypic variations within cultivated tomato. The identified SNPs could be potent selection markers for marker-assisted selection in breeding. However, no significant SNP association was detected for most of the traits registered in the NIVTS and NIAS Genebanks. Two possibilities can be advanced to explain the lack of a significant association. First, the density of the SNPs was insufficient for GWAS. In this study, while 1248 SNPs were employed in GWAS, LD extension in the gene-rich euchromatin region (58 kb) was too short to be covered by the SNP density employed (1 SNP/213 kb in euchromatin; Supplementary Table S4). This analysis suggests that >3228 and >41 SNPs in eu- and heterochromatin regions, respectively, would be required to obtain high-resolution results from GWAS. Additionally, most of the traits were scored on 1–5 or 1–10 scales, rather than by performing actual measurements. Since the scale standards may vary between individual investigators, the accuracy is unlikely to be sufficient for GWAS. One of the reasons for the success in identifying the SNP associations with the eight morphological traits might be that the SNPs possessed large effects on phenotypic variations.In this study, we demonstrated that genetic resource accessions can be used for GWAS, i.e. there is no need to establish a specific mapping population via labour-intensive methods for performing crosses and advancing generations. In addition, a core collection would be more effective for GWAS, as it would avoid the labour and cost associated with high-density whole-genome genotyping and replicated phenotyping. In barley, GWAS was used to detect SNP associations with agronomical traits in a worldwide collection.47 The establishment of core collections for tomato, whose contents could be changed depending on the purpose,48 would enable the identification of valuable loci for molecular genetics and breeding.In conclusion, the usefulness of GWAS was demonstrated by analysing a large SNP data set obtained from the re-sequencing data. This study represents an important step forward in genomics, genetics, and for the breeding of cultivated tomato.5.

IntroductionThe phenomenon of regeneration has become the object of extensive research in recent years. The investigations on the molecular basis of regeneration in different models were rarely focused on epigenetic aspects, while it seems that these are the epigenetic mechanisms which could play a key role in both maintaining the capacity for regeneration and remodelling involved in the regenerative response. All organs in an organism originate from a single cell (zygote), which clearly indicates that a single genome contains the information needed to grow organs and tissues, and possibly to restore lost and injured structures. This information is stored through the whole life. However, the expression of this information is gradually repressed during development, with epigenetic mechanisms including DNA methylation playing an essential part.Although the direct evidence on the involvement of DNA methylation in regeneration is scarce, a few remarkable findings are worth mentioning including the role of the Shh gene methylation in amphibian limb regeneration1 and the changes of DNA methylation status in the Gadd45a promoter found during folate-induced regeneration response in the rodent spinal cord.2 To our knowledge, no analysis of genome-wide DNA methylation profiles related to regeneration has been reported so far.The MRL/MpJ mouse, an inbred laboratory strain of Mus musculus, emerged as the model of mammalian regeneration in the 1990s when the unusual phenomenon of regenerative ear-hole closure was discovered3 to be followed by the observations of enhanced regenerative response in other tissues including cornea,4 retina,5,6 digit tips,7,8 heart,9 articular cartilage,10 and spinal cord. The ability to close 2 mm through-and-through ear holes in the ear pinnae, which are used for a lifelong animal marking, clearly distinguishes the MRL/MpJ from most other mouse strains, although it is shared with the LG/J mouse, the MRL/MpJ's major ancestral strain.11 The response to injury in the MRL/MpJ mouse does not result in scar formation, but in complete restoration of excised fragment with normal tissue architecture, including blood vessels, hair follicles, sebaceous glands, and cartilage, that occurs within 30 days.3 Since this process requires reinstatement of different types of tissues, it resembles epimorphic regeneration observed in amphibians. One important feature of injury response in the MRL/MpJ mouse is increased activity of matrix metalloproteinases that decompose the extracellular matrix breaking the basal lamina, a layer that initially covers the wound surface. This process allows the formation of the blastema-like structure of undifferentiated cells that drive the process of regeneration.12 Another important feature of the MRL/MpJ mouse is its abnormal cell cycle profile with accumulation of the cells in the G2/M phase. This hallmark has been connected with the deficiency of p21, an inhibitor of cell cycle progression, that is not detected in the tissues of the MRL/MpJ mouse even after <U+03B3>-irradiation. Although the regeneration abilities of the MRL/MpJ expand themselves on other tissues, they do not reach as spectacular effects as those observed in urodele amphibians which restore lost limbs13 and regenerate as serious injuries as the complete transection of the spinal cord14 and partial heart resection.15 In the MRL/MpJ mouse, lost digits do not re-grow,8 heart regeneration is rather limited,9,16,17 and the heart does not heal in some types of injuries.18–22 The regenerative phenotype of the MRL/MpJ mouse has been found to be multigenic.23 It is also remarkable that increased regenerative response in the MRL/MpJ mouse is found in different tissues, and the strain maintains selected features of embryonic metabolism in adults including the enhanced expression of key stem cell markers, Sox2 and Nanog.24,25The object of the presented study is the comparative analysis of the genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in the MRL/MpJ “healer” mouse, using the C57BL/6J mouse as the reference. In our attempt to understand the epigenetic basis of regeneration, we would like to identify the differentially methylated genes and to evaluate their possible association with the regenerative capacity of the MRL/MpJ mouse. The study was designed to analyse global DNA methylation profiles in heart tissue, as it is known to have poor, if any, regenerative capacity, in order to refer to the liver, which has a strong regenerative potential, in addition to spleen, selected for its involvement in cell-mediated pathways of the immune system. As the regenerating tissues are difficult to obtain in sufficient amounts and the DNA methylation patterns in cultured cell lines are prone to change, we would like to focus the study on the normal tissues, thus examining the basis of regeneration rather than the regenerative response.2. Materials and methods2.1. Tissue samples and nucleic acid extractionTissue samples (hearts, livers, and spleens) from 5-week-old males and 8-week-old females of MRL/MpJ (stock #000486) and C57BL/6J (stock #000664) murine strains were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. The samples from 8 week-old females were not used for the microarray analyses, but for the validation experiments only. Genomic DNA was isolated using the DNeasy Blood &Tissue Kit (QIAGEN, cat. no. 69504) and RNA with the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, cat. no. 74104) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Tissues were delivered in RNAlater stablilization reagent (QIAGEN, cat. no. 76104) and were disrupted in liquid nitrogen before nucleic acids isolation.2.2. Methylated DNA immunoprecipitationMethylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) was performed according to the modified Weber's protocol.26 Equal amounts of genomic DNA from three individuals were pooled for each strain and tissue. Each pooled sample (7 µg) was diluted in 150 µl of water and randomly sheared by sonication to generate fragments between 300 and 1000 bp. A 4-µg portion of sonicated DNA was diluted in 450 µL of 10 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0, heat denatured at 98°C for 10 min and immediately cooled on ice for 10 min. A portion of the untreated, sonicated DNA was left to serve as the input control. The CpG-methylated DNA fragments were precipitated with anti-5-methyl cytidine antibody (Eurogentec cat. no. BI-MECY-1000), and the antibody–DNA complexes were captured with Dynabeads (Invitrogen, cat. no. 11202). The collected beads were washed in order to remove non-specifically-bound DNA, following the treatment with proteinase K for 20–24 h at 50°C in order to remove proteins. The CpG-methylated DNA was extracted with the phenol:chloroform method, precipitated with ethanol and glycogen, and resuspended in 60 µl of 10 mM Tris–Cl, pH 8.0.2.3. DNA Labelling and HybridizationDNA labelling and hybridization was performed according to NimbleGen's protocol with our modifications.27 The immunoprecipitated CpG-methylated DNA (test) and the untreated, sonicated DNA (input control) were labelled by using the random priming with the Nimblegen Dual-Color DNA Labelling kit (Roche-Nimblegen, cat. no. 06370250001) with fluorescent dyes Cy3 and Cy5, respectively. The combined test and input DNA samples were suspended in hybridization buffer (Roche, cat. no. 05583683001) co-hybridized onto Mouse DNA Methylation 3 × 720 K CpG Island Plus RefSeq Promoter Arrays for 20 h at 42°C, following washing with the Nimblegen Wash Kit (Roche cat. no. 05584507001).2.4. Microarray data acquisition and processingWe performed image acquisition with an MS200 Scanner (Roche, NimbleGen) at 2 µm resolution by using high-sensitivity and autogain settings. The data from scanned images were extracted and processed with DEVA v. 1.0.2 (Roche, Nimblegen) using default parameters. Data processing included obtaining log2 ratios, P-scores, and peak identification. Log2 ratios represent the ratios of the immunoprecipitated DNA signal to the input DNA signal. The mean log2 ratios were calculated using a Tukey biweight mean. P-scores were calculated from log2 ratios by performing the sliding-window (750 bp) Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) test around each probe applied to determine a -log10 P-value from the windowed KS test around that probe. The methylation peaks were obtained by merging consecutive probes with P-scores over the assumed cut-off (default 2.0), with maximum 500 bp spacing and minimum of two probes per peak. The processed data (P-scores) and raw data were deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database under the accession number GSE49221.2.5. Identification of differentially methylated genesThe methylation peaks were mapped to features (transcription start sites, primary transcripts, CpG islands, and other tiled regions) using DEVA v. 1.0.2, assuming the default distances 5000 bp upstream and 1000 bp downstream the feature The annotated data for the methylation peaks obtained at cut-off of 1.0 and 2.0 were merged using GenixNet, a script created by Dr P. Madanecki and adjusted to the analysed datasets, so that a single table containing all genes, tiled regions, and CpG islands with the methylation peak values for each strain and tissue at two different cut-off points was created. The data merged using GenixNet were sorted to identify the differentially methylated genes using the Excel spreadsheet. If a peak was mapped to more than one feature (e.g. transcription start site and primary transcript), the data listed in the tables of differentially methylated peaks (Supplementary Table S1) were restricted to a single feature selected according to the following order: transcription start site, primary transcript, CpG island, and tiled region.2.6. Validation of the MeDIP/microarray results and gene expression level quantificationThe methylation status of selected CpG nucleotides was evaluated using bisulphite sequencing and/or genomic DNA digestion with a CpG methylation-sensitive HpaII restriction endonuclease. Gene expression levels were quantified using real-time PCR.The bisulphite conversion of genomic DNA was carried out with the EZ DNA Methylation™ Kit (Zymo Research, cat. no. D5002) using 500 ng of genomic DNA. Approximately 100 ng of obtained converted DNA was used for the subsequent PCR reaction with the Maxima Hot Start Taq DNA polymerase system (ThermoScientificBio, cat. no. EP0601). The PCR reactions were performed on Veriti® 96-well Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems). The PCR amplified DNA fragments were extracted from the agarose gel and purified using the ISOLATE Gel and PCR kit (Bioline, cat. no. BIO-52029). The PCR products were sequenced using the Applied Biosystems ABI 3730XL/ABI3700 DNA sequencer (Genomed, Poland), and the chromatograms were analysed with ContigExpress (VectorNTI 11.0, Invitrogen).The CpG methylation-sensitive digestion of genomic DNA was carried out with the EpiJET DNA Methylation Analysis Kit based on MspI/HpaII digestion (ThermoScientificBio, cat. no. K1441) using 500 ng of genomic DNA and 50 ng of digested DNA for quantitative real-time PCR analysis. The methylation level was quantified using the 2-<U+0394>Ct method and expressed as the ratio between HpaII-digested DNA (target) and input/non-digested DNA (reference) used for enzymatic reaction. cDNA synthesis was performed with Maxima Reverse Transcriptase (ThermoScientificBio, cat. no. EP0742) using 200 ng of total RNA and oligo dT20. Approximately 10 ng of cDNA was used for subsequent real-time PCR reactions. The gene expression levels were calculated using the 2-<U+0394>Ct method with Actb as the reference gene. The results are presented as means ± SD.Real-time PCR reactions were carried out with FastStart Essential DNA Green Master (Roche, cat. no. 06402712001) on LightCycler® Nano (Roche). The primer sequences are listed in Supplementary Table S2.2.7. Linear regression and scatter plotsLinear regression coefficients were determined, and scatter plots were made using the XLSTAT package (Addinsoft).2.8. Chromosomal ideograms with the locations of differentially methylated genesThe chromosomal maps with the locations of differentially methylated genes were plotted using Idiographica v. 2.1 (http://www.ncrna.org/idiographica).282.9. Counting the DNA methylation peaks at different value rangesThe lists of unique peaks were obtained from the lists of mapped peaks generated by DEVA v. 1.0.2. The numbers of peaks at different methylation values were calculated in Excel spreadsheet.2.10. Gene set enrichment analysisThe gene set enrichment analyses were performed and functional annotations were assigned by using DAVID Bioinformatics Resource 6.7 [National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institute of Health29,30]. An EASE Score, a modified Fisher's Exact test, was applied to calculate statistical significance of gene set enrichments.2.11. Processing and analysis of genomic DNA methylation microarray data downloaded from the Gene Omnibus Expression DatabaseThe microarray data on gene expression in the heart and liver of the MRL/MpJ mouse were retrieved from GSE19322, GSE4710, GSE25322, and GSE5241 datasets deposited in the GEO database. The gene expression values were merged with the annotations from the corresponding platform files in Excel spreadsheet. The logarithmed signal values were exponentiated. Average values were calculated from replicates. To calculate median and quartile expression values for selected gene subsets (e.g. the genes hypomethylated in the MRL/MpJ mouse), the expression values were extracted in Excel spreadsheet using gene identifiers. Gene expression values between the subsets of genes selected according to their methylation levels were compared by Wilcoxon rank-sum two-tailed tests using the SAS statistical package version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA).Processed DNA methylation data (P-scores) were downloaded from the GSE21415 dataset deposited in the GEO database. The genome coordinates were converted from the NCBI MM8 build to the NCBI MM9 build using ‘Lift Genome Annotations’ service from the University of California Santa Cruz Genome browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgLiftOver). The methylation peaks were obtained with NimbleScan 2.6 (Roche, Nimblegen) at cut-off of 1.0 using default parameters (at least two probes per peak with maximum spacing of 500 bp). Average values were calculated from replicates. The methylation peaks were mapped to gene features using DEVA v. 1.0.2, assuming the standard distance 5000 bp upstream and 1000 bp downstream the feature. Average values were used for the features with more than one methylation peak.2.12. Analysis of correlations between DNA methylation and gene expression dataGene expression and methylation data were merged using GenixNet. Pearson's correlation coefficients were calculated using the SAS statistical package version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc.).2.13. Analysis of correlations between genome-wide DNA methylation profilesAs the formats of microarray platforms applied in this study and that by Liang et al. are different, we restricted the analysis to the peaks mapped to the transcription start sites shared by both platforms (18 199 unique genes included in Roche MM8 385 K RefSeq Promoter Array). If more than a single peak was mapped to a gene, average values were calculated by using Excel ‘pivot tables’ function. The methylation peaks for this analysis were obtained at cut-off of 1.0 in order to reduce the number of ‘0’ under the cut-off, which, in fact, represent a spectrum of values. The peaks under the cut-off of 1.0 were given the value ‘0’. The arrays were merged using Entrez identifiers. Pearson's correlation coefficients were calculated using the SAS statistical package version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc.).3. Results and discussionWe investigated the epigenetic basis of the regeneration phenomenon in the MRL/MpJ mouse using genome-wide DNA methylation profiling. As the MRL/MpJ strain does not have an immediate relative, which does not exhibit enhanced regeneration abilities, we chose the C57BL/6J mouse as the reference strain. We carried out genome-wide DNA methylation profiling in hearts, livers, and spleens of the MRL/MpJ and C57BL/6J strains using the MeDIP approach followed by microarray analysis. The Nimblegen microarray system ‘3 × 720 K CpG Island Plus RefSeq Promoter’ we applied in the study includes 20 404 promoter regions; 22 881 transcripts and 15 980 CpG Islands. The DNA methylation profiles we obtained for the MRL/MpJ and C57BL/6J were compared in order to identify the differentially methylated genes and regions. The overall comparisons of inter-strain similarities and differences between the examined genomic DNA methylation profiles are visualized using scatter plots (Supplementary Fig. S1).This study was designed as an initial analysis of genome-wide DNA methylation patterns and we restricted the selection of tissues to heart, liver, and spleen. Heart and liver were selected to contrast the non-regenerating organ with the regenerating one. Spleen was chosen for its role in the immune system, as immune response to injury seems to be one of the most critical events in the regeneration process.313.1. Genes differentially methylated in the MRL/MpJ mouseAs the DNA methylation patterns are prone to individual and conditional variation, we focused on the analysis of the genes revealing the most distinguishing differences in the methylation status. We assumed a gene/region to be differentially methylated if a methylation peak mapped to this gene/region meets at least one of two conditions: either the peak value is at least 3.0 or higher and it is at least twice higher than in the reference (at cut-off of 1.0) or it is at least 2.0 and it is lower than 1.0 for the reference (see Section 2 for the definition of peak value). A peak is mapped to a feature (transcription start site, primary transcript, CpG island, or tiled region) if it is located within 5000 bp upstream and 1000 bp downstream the region (a transcription start site, primary transcript, or CpG island).As the result several hundreds of differentially methylated genes, we will refer to as ‘hypomethylated’ and ‘hypermethylated’, were identified in liver, spleen, and heart tissue of the MRL/MpJ mouse (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table S1). The majority of differentially methylated genes and regions were not shared by the three examined tissues: heart, liver, and spleen. Twenty-three genes and CpG islands were found to be hypomethylated and 14 to be hypermethylated in the MRL/MpJ mouse in the three examined tissues. These genes and CpG islands were located on all chromosomes except the 18, 19, X, and Y (Fig. 2), and they are associated with a number of different functions. The complete list and the descriptions of these genes are presented in Supplementary Table S1, while a selection of remarkable representatives of this group (Table 1) are discussed later in this article.

(see the chapter: ‘Genes with similar DNA methylation status in the heart and liver of the MRL/MpJ but not the C57BL/6J mouse’).3.2. Validation of the MeDIP/microarray resultsA selection of DNA methylation peaks were validated in the MRL/MpJ and the C57BL/6J reference using bisulphite sequencing and/or digestion with a CpG methylation-sensitive restriction endonuclease HpaII, followed by quantitative real-time PCR analysis [Supplementary Table S3 (summarized results), Supplementary File S1 (experiment details), and Supplementary File S2 (representative DNA sequencing chromatograms assembled with the reference sequences)]. Gene expression levels of selected genes were examined by quantitative real-time PCR analysis [Supplementary Table S3 (summarized results) and Supplementary File S1 (experiment details)].3.3. The chromosomal locations of differentially methylated regionsThe hyper- and hypomethylated genes and regions were found on all chromosomes. Several chromosomal loci display significant positional enrichments of the genes differentially methylated in the MRL/MpJ mouse, but no remarkable regions of peak accumulation could be distinguished (Fig. 2A and B).3.4. Gene methylation status and gene expressionDNA methylation of gene promoters is known to repress gene expression. With regard to evaluating the impact of DNA methylation on gene expression in the examined tissues, we analysed the available expression microarray data for the MRL/MpJ heart and liver tissues reported in four different studies.16,17,37,38 Our evaluation was based on the correlations between DNA methylation status and expression signals, as well as mean values of expression signals calculated for subsets of genes at different peak value ranges. We found that the expression signal values were increasing with the decrease of DNA methylation status (Fig. 3A), and the values of methylation peaks and gene expression signals were reversely correlated (Fig. 3B). The Pearson's correlation coefficients for gene methylation and expression values in the heart though significant for both the C57BL/6J and MRL/MpJ mouse were lower for the latter one. This analysis confirmed that the obtained genomic DNA methylation patterns are adequate to the transcriptomic profiles. However, the gene expression signals in hearts for the groups of genes differentially methylated in the MRL/MpJ and C57BL/6J did not show statistically significant differences between these two strains (Fig. 3A). This inconsistence could be explained by age differences, as we used DNA methylation data obtained for 5-week-old animals and the gene expression data had been collected for much older mice (8- to 20-week old). It should also be noted that the majority of DNA methylation peaks mapped to the differentially methylated genes in the MRL/MpJ are located at higher distance than those in the C57BL/6J mouse (Fig. 6B). After all, in spite of the age differences, the overall correlations between DNA methylation and gene expression were confirmed. Gene methylation and gene expression profiles. (A) Gene expression levels at different DNA methylation peak value ranges in heart and livers of the MRL/MpJ mouse. The microarray gene expression data representing the tissues collected from uninjured organs were retrieved from the following datasets GSE4710 and GSE19222 (hearts), GSE5241 and GSE25322 (livers) that had been obtained in four independent studies.16,17,37,38 Wilcoxon rank-sum two-tailed tests were performed in order to compare gene expression values between the groups of genes selected according to the DNA methylation level ranges (determined in this study). The median and quartile values were normalized to the highest value from each dataset. (B) The correlations between the DNA methylation and gene expression levels. The Pearson's correlation coefficients were calculated for the gene methylation values determined in this study for the heart and liver of the MRL/MpJ and C57BL/6J mouse, and corresponding gene expression values that were obtained from four other independent studies,16,17,37,38 as described above.Gene methylation and gene expression profiles.

First, it should be noted that tissues unlike cell lines are more likely to be mosaics of cells that show different DNA methylation and gene expression patterns, thus a methylation peak may represent gene methylation status in a fraction of tissue cells, while another fraction of cells is responsible for high gene expression. Secondly, an individual gene does not have to show higher expression when unmethylated, as other repression mechanisms could be involved. Thirdly, some genes are induced due to demethylation of selected CpGs within a CpG island.393.5. Functional profiling of genes differentially methylated in the MRL/MpJ mouse: gene set enrichment analysisOnce the genes differentially methylated in the MRL/MpJ mouse were singled out, we could examine which functional and structural categories were overrepresented among these genes, to be followed by looking for associations with the phenotype. As the first step, we carried out gene set enrichment analysis for the groups of hypo- and hypermethylated genes using the DAVID algorithm and database.29,30 We examined the sets of genes hypo- and hypermethylated in hearts, livers, and spleens (six gene sets, Supplementary Table S1). The analysis revealed a number of statistically significant functional terms (Supplementary Table S4). Although terms which are not statistically significant, as well as those found for one of tissues, could provide useful clues on the association between DNA methylation and regeneration potential, we decided to focus on the statistically significant terms representative of the three examined tissues. The statistically significant functional terms representing the hypomethylated genes in the three examined tissues (Supplementary Table S5) could be associated with three major categories: phosphoproteins, alternative splicing, and negative regulation of metabolism (repressors), thus suggesting that the MRL/MpJ mouse is likely to produce more phosphoproteins, repressors, and alternatively spliced transcripts. Interestingly, intragenic DNA methylation has been associated with the use of alternative promoters and the synthesis of alternative transcripts,40 while positive regulation of phosphate metabolic processes in human foetal heart tissues has been concluded from the analysis of DNA methylation microarray data.41An additional term shared by the term sets obtained for the genes hypomethylated in liver, heart, and spleen of the MRL/MpJ mouse was associated with embryonic morphogenesis. This suggests that the DNA methylation pattern of MRL/MpJ mouse might have retained some embryonic features and the possibility will be discussed in the next chapter.The remarkable features of the functional terms representing the hypermethylated genes identified in the heart and spleen of the MRL/MpJ mouse were associated with three groups: G-protein-coupled receptors, including mostly olfactory receptors, Ig-like V-type, and natural killer receptor Ly49 genes. Over 1500 olfactory receptor genes are one of the most abundant gene family in mouse, and this may explain their overrepresentation. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that altered olfactory function has been reported in the MRL mouse model of the central nervous system lupus.42 The majority of selected Ig-like V-type genes belongs to the cluster of selection and upkeep of intraepithelial T cell genes. The region of chromosome 4, where the selection and upkeep of intraepithelial T cells genes are located, is polymorphic, and we found that the MRL/MpJ mouse lacks the nucleotide sequences corresponding to the DNA methylation peaks in the promoter regions of Skint3 and Skint4 (not shown), so it is not the epigenetic but the genetic impact rather which should be considered for this group of genes. The hypermethylated genes of natural killer Ly49 receptors included mostly killer cell lectin-like receptor subfamily A genes: Klra12, Klra13-ps, Klra4, Klra15, Klra23, Klra22, Klra18, and Klra33, located on the chromosome 6.None of the functional terms produced for the genes hypermethylated in the liver was shared by the term sets produced for the genes hypermethylated in the heart and spleen of the MRL/MpJ mouse.3.6. Do the genomic DNA methylation patterns of the MRL/MpJ mouse retain embryonic features?Enhanced healing typical of foetal and neonatal period suggests that the regeneration abilities of the MRL/MpJ mouse could be embryonic relics preserved in the adult organism. As indicated by Naviaux et al.,24 the adult MRL/MpJ mouse retains a selection of embryonic metabolic features. With regard to finding out as to whether the genomic DNA methylation profiles of the MRL/MpJ mouse exhibit embryonic traits, we investigated the representation of the genes associated with embryo development among the genes differentially methylated in the MRL/MpJ mouse, as well as we evaluated the overall similarity of the MRL/MpJ and embryonic methylation patterns.3.7. Genes associated with embryonic development are overrepresented among those hypomethylated in the MRL/MpJ mouseThe gene set enrichment analysis for the genes hypomethylated in the MRL/MpJ showed excessive numbers of genes associated with embryonic development and homeobox genes (Table 2). ‘Embryonic organ morphogenesis,’ one of the terms related to embryonic development, was shared by the functional term sets produced for the three examined tissues. Three different groups of genes associated with embryonic organ morphogenesis which were identified in the liver, heart, and spleen shared two elements: the insulin induced gene 2 (Insig2) and forkhead box C2 (Foxc2) (Supplementary Table S6). The latter could be of particular interest of regenerative medicine as a potent regulator of angiogenesis.43Excessive numbers of homeobox and embryonic morphogenesis genes are hypomethylated in the tissues of adult MRL/MpJ mouseThe gene set enrichment analysis carried out using DAVID showed that homeobox genes and a number of other genes involved in multiple developmental processes were significantly overrepresented in the group of the MRL/MpJ hypomethylated genes (Supplementary Table S1). The enrichment terms which are statistically significant with modified Fisher's exact test (p-values <0.05) are indicated with orange fields (darker shade of grey in the print) and those with p-values <0.05 after Benjamini correction are indicated with red fields (darker shade of grey in the print).Excessive numbers of homeobox and embryonic morphogenesis genes are hypomethylated in the tissues of adult MRL/MpJ mouseThe gene set enrichment analysis carried out using DAVID showed that homeobox genes and a number of other genes involved in multiple developmental processes were significantly overrepresented in the group of the MRL/MpJ hypomethylated genes (Supplementary Table S1). The enrichment terms which are statistically significant with modified Fisher's exact test (p-values <0.05) are indicated with orange fields (darker shade of grey in the print) and those with p-values <0.05 after Benjamini correction are indicated with red fields (darker shade of grey in the print).Homeobox genes have been found to be hypomethylated in the embryos of the C57BL/6J mouse in hearts and livers (spleens were not examined in that study).44 Homeobox genes were overrepresented among the genes differentially methylated in the spleens and livers, but not in the hearts of the MRL/MpJ mouse. Thirty-nine and 20 homeobox genes were found to be hypomethylated in the liver and spleen in the MRL/MpJ mouse, respectively (Table 2 and Supplementary Table S6). Seven of these homeobox genes were hypomethylated in both tissues.3.8. Genomic DNA methylation patterns of the MRL/MpJ mouse reveal lower inter-tissue diversificationTo evaluate the overall similarity between the genomic DNA methylation profiles of embryos and the adult MRL/MpJ mouse, we applied Pearson's correlation test. We analysed the DNA methylation data obtained in our study and that reported by Liang et al.44 As we were comparing the data produced by different generations of Nimblegen microarrays, we restricted the analysis to the transcription start sites shared by both platforms. The analysis of correlation data showed that the inter-tissue diversification of the genomic DNA methylation profiles was lower in the MRL/MpJ than in the C57BL/6J mouse (Fig. 4). Assuming that the DNA methylation patterns reflect tissue differentiation, which advances with development, the lower diversification of inter-tissue DNA methylation patterns seems likely to occur at earlier developmental stages. With regard to this hypothesis, we analysed the changes in correlation coefficients between the genomic DNA methylation profiles in embryo, newborn, and adult tissues using the data reported by Liang et al.44 to find out that in most cases the inter-tissue correlations of DNA methylation profiles decrease with age (Fig. 4, inset). To our knowledge, low inter-tissue diversification of the embryonic DNA methylation profiles has never been reported to date. Genome-wide DNA methylation profiles display lower inter-tissue diversification in the MRL/MpJ than in the C57BL/6J mouse. Inset: Similarly, we observed lower inter-tissue diversification of genome-wide DNA methylation profiles reported by Liang et al.44 in embryos and newborns than in adults (with the exception for the correlations between the heart and brain). The inter-tissue correlations between pairs of genomic DNA methylation profiles were determined using Pearson's correlations coefficients. All Pearson's correlation coefficients were statistically significant with P-values of <0.0001. Pearson's correlation coefficients were calculated for the pairs of genomic DNA methylation arrays obtained in this study: heart–spleen, spleen–liver, and heart–liver for both the MRL/MpJ and C57BL/6J mouse. Analogically, Pearson's correlation coefficients were determined for the genomic DNA methylation profiles in different tissues of murine embryos, newborns, and adults reported by Liang et al.44 The microarray data were extracted from the dataset deposited in the GEO database under the accession number GSE21415. The Pearson's correlation coefficients shown in the inset were determined for the average values obtained from two biological replicates, but similar trends were found in the correlations determined for individual animals (not shown).Genome-wide DNA methylation profiles display lower inter-tissue diversification in the MRL/MpJ than in the C57BL/6J mouse.

The analysis of genomic DNA methylation patterns in the embryonic and newborn tissues of the MRL/MpJ mouse is necessary to provide further evidence.3.9. Enhanced proportion of high methylation peaks in the MRL/MpJ compared with C57BL/6J mouseIn addition to the above-discussed low inter-tissue diversification, another characteristic feature of the genomic DNA methylation profiles of the MRL/MpJ mouse, we found, is an enhanced proportion of high methylation peaks (with the values of 4.0 and over) in comparison with the C57BL/6J (Fig. 5). Excessive numbers of high DNA methylation peaks in the genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in the tissues of MRL/MpJ mouse.

It is assumed that high methylation peaks have the values of 4.0 and over.3.10. The balance of DNA methylation is shifted upstream the genes in the MRL/MpJ mouseIt is not only the degree of CpG methylation in the regulatory region of a gene, but also the distance of methylated CpGs from the transcription start sites that contributes to the repression of gene expression.39,45 In other words, a DNA methylation peak though mapped to a gene may have different impacts on gene expression dependent on its location.To examine the distribution of DNA methylation peaks in relation to the distance from their promoters, we calculated peak numbers at different distance ranges from transcription start sites and primary transcripts in hearts, livers, and spleens of the MRL/MpJ and C57BL/6J mouse (Fig. 6). The microarray design of the Nimblegen platform we used includes mainly the transcription start sites associated with the basal promoters. The numbers of DNA methylation peaks at different distance range from transcription start sites and primary transcripts in the MRL/MpJ and C57BL/6J mouse. DNA methylation peaks were divided into four categories, according to their location from the genes they were mapped to: (i) distal, mapped from 5000 bp upstream up to 500 bp upstream from transcription start sites (TSSs), (ii) proximal, mapped from 500 bp upstream up to 100 bp downstream from transcription start sites, (iii) mapped within primary transcripts (PT) and 1000 bp downstream from PT 3' ends, except those up to 100 bp from TSSs, (iv) the peaks within remote CpG islands that were not mapped to any PT, i.e. those located over 5000 bp upstream from TSSs and 1000 bp downstream from PT 3' ends. (A) Peak counts including all DNA methylation peaks of =2.0. (B) Peak counts including differentially methylated peaks only (the peaks selected according to the criteria specified in the chapter: ‘Genes differentially methylated in the MRL/MpJ mouse’).The numbers of DNA methylation peaks at different distance range from transcription start sites and primary transcripts in the MRL/MpJ and C57BL/6J mouse. DNA methylation peaks were divided into four categories, according to their location from the genes they were mapped to: (i) distal, mapped from 5000 bp upstream up to 500 bp upstream from transcription start sites (TSSs), (ii) proximal, mapped from 500 bp upstream up to 100 bp downstream from transcription start sites, (iii) mapped within primary transcripts (PT) and 1000 bp downstream from PT 3' ends, except those up to 100 bp from TSSs, (iv) the peaks within remote CpG islands that were not mapped to any PT, i.e. those located over 5000 bp upstream from TSSs and 1000 bp downstream from PT 3' ends. (A) Peak counts including all DNA methylation peaks of =2.0. (B) Peak counts including differentially methylated peaks only (the peaks selected according to the criteria specified in the chapter: ‘Genes differentially methylated in the MRL/MpJ mouse’).We found that the number of DNA methylation peaks situated over 500 bp upstream from transcription start sites in the MRL/MpJ substantially exceeds than that in the C57BL/6J mouse (Fig. 6A). The number of DNA methylation peaks mapped within close promoter neighbourhood, in the range from 500 bp upstream up to 100 bp downstream from transcription start sites, is in turn higher in the C57BL/6J than that in the MRL/MpJ mouse (Fig. 6A). Such differences were revealed in all examined tissues and they do not reflect the differences in total peak numbers. The numbers of DNA methylation peaks located within the primary transcripts and up to 1000 bp downstream, which are mostly the intragenic ones, were remarkably higher in the C57BL/6J than that in the MRL/MpJ mouse in the spleens and livers, while in the hearts they were similar (Fig. 6A).We also found that the numbers of DNA methylation peaks mapped over 5000 bp upstream and over 1000 bp downstream from primary transcripts, we may consider intergenic, are lower in the MRL/MpJ compared with the C57BL/6J mouse (Fig. 6A). However, the microarray platform, we used, is a promoter one, and few probes are derived from the intergenic regions. Consequently, this estimate of intergenic DNA methylation may not be representative.Interestingly, the differences described above are dramatically more pronounced for the differentially methylated genes (Fig. 6B).The results indicate that the balance of DNA methylation in the MRL/MpJ mouse is shifted towards the distal alternative promoters and other distal regulatory elements as, for example, enhancers. This shift is particularly remarkable for the differentially methylated genes. However, it should be stressed that the observed methylation of distal regulatory regions is not prevailing, but rather more accentuated in the MRL/MpJ than in the C57BL/6J mouse. Alternative promoters are known to be associated with development and tissue and cell differentiation,46,47 which implicates the question as to whether this trait of DNA methylation profiles could impact the cellular differentiation potential in the MRL/MpJ mouse.3.11. Genes with similar DNA methylation status in the heart and liver of the MRL/MpJ, but not the C57BL/6J, mouseAs regeneration abilities of mammalian liver remarkably exceed those of the heart, the genes that display strong differences in the DNA methylation status between heart and liver could be of particular interest with regard to regeneration. Therefore, we singled out the genes that had ‘liver-like’ methylation status in the MRL/MpJ, but not in the C57BL/6J heart. We identified two, relatively small, groups of such genes. One group consisting of 18 genes and CpG islands were the genes that were hypermethylated in the heart and hypomethylated in the C57BL/6J liver, while hypomethylated both in the heart and liver of the MRL/MpJ mouse. Three genes involved in embryonic morphogenesis: Epha2, Pax2, and Gatad2a (Table 1) deserve particular attention in this group. The other set, including 47 genes and CpG islands, were hypermethylated in the C57BL/6J heart and hypomethylated in the liver, while hypermethylated both in the heart and liver of the MRL/MpJ mouse. Two groups of genes, 10 genes associated with acetylation, and 3 genes encoding LIM domains were overrepresented in this group (Supplementary Table S4). The result was not statistically significant for the first group, but it includes as an important gene as histone deacetylase 1 (Hdac1), which is one of key factors responsible for chromatin remodelling. The repression of this factor could prevent chromatin condensation, thus promoting the transcription of a number of target genes. The overrepresentation of three LIM zinc-binding domain genes (Csrp1, Ablim1, and Fhl1) was statistically significant, and LIM domains are known to play important roles in the regulation of developmental pathways.483.12. Remarkable representatives of the differentially methylated genesAs we identified as many as hundreds of differentially methylated genes in three tissues of the MRL/MpJ mouse (Supplementary Table S1), we would like to give a short description of a selection of these genes (Table 1). The selection includes the genes differentially methylated in all examined tissues and several others that could be of exceptional interest due to their potential importance to regenerative abilities. A few genes from this list which arrested our distinct attention and were not discussed before are discussed below.Since the MRL/MpJ mouse exhibits enhanced healing abilities, wound repair-related genes could be expected to be found in the group of the genes differentially methylated in this strain. As the genes related to wound healing are not a precisely defined category, it is difficult to evaluate if such genes are overrepresented among those differentially methylated in the MRL/MpJ. We found two genes associated with wound healing among the genes hypomethylated in the MRL/MpJ mouse that deserve particular attention: platelet-derived growth factor alpha (Pdgfa) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (Pdgfra). The roles of platelet-derived growth factors (platelet-derived growth factor beta in particular) and their receptors in wound healing have already been established.49The promoter regions of the gene encoding de novo methylase Dnmt3b are hypomethylated in the heart and spleen of the MRL/MpJ mouse. Dnmt3b could be of particular importance as it is expressed in embryonic stem cells and embryo inner cell mass and when expressed in adults could contribute to epigenetic plasticity.The promoter regions of the growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible 45 alpha (Gadd45a) gene were hypermethylated in the MRL/MpJ mouse in the spleen and heart (but not in the liver). Interestingly, enhanced methylation of this region has been observed in response to folate intervention during spinal cord regeneration.2Regeneration abilities are often associated with the pluripotency of stem cells. Nevertheless, the list of genes differentially methylated in the MRL/MpJ mouse does not include the key stem cell marker genes, such as Oct4 (Pouf51), Klf4, Sox2, Nanog, and Islet1 (which are covered by the array), where the three latter have been reported to display enhanced expression in the MRL/MpJ mouse.244. Concluding remarksThe analysis of genomic DNA methylation profiles revealed hundreds of genes hypo- and hypermethylated in the heart, spleen, and liver of the MRL/MpJ mouse strain in comparison with the C57BL/6J control, and 37 of these genes were differentially methylated in the three examined tissues. The distinguishing features of the genomic methylation patterns in the tissues of adult MRL/MpJ mouse, we found, were the shift of DNA methylation balance upstream the genes and relatively low inter-tissue diversity, resembling that we observed in previously reported genomic DNA methylation profiles of embryos and newborns.44 The possibility that the DNA methylation patterns of the MRL/MpJ mouse retain embryonic relics is supported by another observation, which is the overrepresentation of the genes involved in embryogenesis among the genes hypomethylated in the MRL/MpJ mouse. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report embryonic features of the genomic DNA methylation profile in adult organism.This study presents a group of genes differentially methylated in the MRL/MpJ mouse, which could be analysed as candidate genes of regenerative phenotype. The examination of additional reference strains is necessary to narrow the group by eliminating the genes related to inter-strain differences that are not linked with regeneration. Our results show that the embryo-like features of the DNA methylation patterns are likely to contribute to enhanced regenerative capacity observed in different tissues of the MRL/MpJ mouse. The analysis of the DNA methylation changes in the wound area in the MRL/MpJ and non-healing reference strains is necessary to examine the epigenetic differences which occur in response to injury.The Faslpr mutant of the MRL/MpJ mouse has been widely investigated as a model of systemic lupus erythematosus and other autoimmune diseases. The MRL/MpJ mouse has been also examined in the context of cholesterol metabolism.38 Although we focused on wound healing and regeneration aspects rather, we think that our data could also be useful for autoimmune and lipid metabolism studies.Supplementary DataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis study was supported by the research grant of National Science Centre of Poland 2011/01/B/NZ2/05352 and in part by the Foundation for Polish Science (FNP) support grant for the Kolumb programme fellows ‘The molecular basis of regeneration in the MRL mouse’ awarded to Dr P.

IntroductionGenetic modification (GM) is widely used to engineer organism traits for the purposes of basic research and applied science. In plants, Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation is the most widely used system of genetic engineering. Agrobacterium is an endemic soil bacterium and induces crown gall formation in host plants.1 There are numerous challenges in applying GM technologies to agriculture. To date, various types of GM crops, such as plants resistant to biotic and abiotic stresses, bioenergy crops, and biopharmaceutical crops, have been developed. Since the first commercialization of herbicide- or insect-resistant GM crop in 1996, 170 million hectares in 28 countries had been allotted to GM crops in 2012.2In a previous study, we generated transgenic rice (Oryza sativa) ectopically expressing the major Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica) pollen allergens Cry j 1 and Cry j 2. The transgene products specifically accumulated to high levels in the endosperm of rice grain.3 In mice fed the transgenic rice seed, we observed suppression of specific IgE antibodies and a reduction in the clinical symptoms of pollinosis, such as sneezing frequency and infiltration of inflammatory cells.3 We choose a single plant with a single transfer DNA (T-DNA) insertion site from this transgenic line and named as OSCR11.Differences between GM crops and non-GM crops are one of the most cited public concerns regarding food safety and security. Genomic changes caused by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation have been reported.4,5Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of rice requires a cell culture step, in which mutations called somaclonal variations arise. These mutations can be detected by Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP), Random Amplified Microsatellite Polymorphism (RAMP), and Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD): polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based analyses that depend on restriction enzyme sites, microsatellites, and specific primers, as has been reported in Arabidopsis.5 T-DNA integration occurs at regions of microhomology between the T-DNA and host genome sequences and/or during the double-strand break (DSB) repair process. Chromatin factors and histone proteins of host plants are also involved in this process, revealing potential sources of damage to the plant host genome by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation.6 Next-generation sequencing (NGS) approaches such as whole-genome resequencing and RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) offer the means to study the genomic differences between GM and non-GM crops. The genome sequence of virus-resistant transgenic papaya has been reported, but the differences between GM papaya and non-GM papaya were not addressed.7 Another study using microarray analyses found that gamma-ray mutagenesis altered the transcriptome of rice more profoundly than a transgenic modification.8As oral administration of OSCR11 seed is expected to have a therapeutic effect via the induction of oral immune tolerance against cedar pollen allergens, homozygous OSCR11 seed will be subjected to clinical trials as a treatment for cedar pollen allergy patients after authorization by the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency of Japan. In this study, we conducted whole-genome sequencing and transcriptome analysis of genetically modified OSCR11 rice using NGS. OSCR11 has the background genotype of the Koshihikari low-glutelin mutant a123, which accumulates high levels of recombinant proteins in the endosperm by rebalancing seed storage proteins.9 The a123 genotype is a triple mutant with mutations in three glutelin genes (a1: GluB-4, a2: GluA-2, and a3: GluA-1), and was obtained by crossing a1, a2, and a3 mutants (Fig. 1).10 The a1 and a2 mutations were obtained by gamma-ray treatment, and a3 was obtained by ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS).10 To accurately detect mutations induced by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, we determined the whole-genome sequences and transcriptomes of a123 and compared them with those of OSCR11. Origin of a123 and OSCR11. a1/gluB-4 and a2/gluA-2 mutations occurred after gamma-ray treatment, and the a3/gluA-1 mutation occurred after EMS treatment of the rice cultivar Koshihikari. a12 with both a1 and a2 mutations was obtained by crossing. a123 with all three mutations was obtained by crossing a12 and a3.

OSCR11 was obtained by performing Agrobacterium-mediated transformation on a123.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Whole-genome sequencing, sequence alignment, and screening of variant candidatesThe generation of transgenic rice expressing Japanese cedar pollen allergens was described previously.3 OSCR11, a rice line containing only a single T-DNA insertion site, was obtained by segregation. The host rice lines such as a123 and OSCR11 were cultivated in a greenhouse under natural light conditions for 2 weeks. Genomic DNA was extracted from leaves using a DNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen). Paired-end libraries with 450–500 bp insert sizes were constructed and sequenced on a HiSeq2000 (Illumina) instrument using a single lane for each sample and a 100-bp paired-end sequencing protocol. Sequence data are deposited into the DNA Data Bank of Japan Sequence Read Archive (accession no. DRA000918). Adaptor sequences were trimmed using cutadapt 1.011 with parameters: -e 0.1 –O 5 –m 20. Low-quality bases with a Phred Score of <Q20 at either side of each read were also trimmed. Reads shorter than 20 bp in length were discarded. Trimmed paired-end reads were aligned either to the Agrobacterium C58 genome sequence using BWA, or to the reference rice Nipponbare genome sequence (Os-Nipponbare-Reference-IRGSP-1.0) using the CLC Genomics Workbench 5.1 (CLC bio) with the following parameters: similarity, 0.9; length fraction, 0.9; insertion cost, 3; deletion cost, 3; mismatch cost, 3; non-specific matching, ignored. Structural variations (SVs) in OSCR11 were screened using the CLC Genomics Workbench 5.1 with the following parameters: P-value threshold, 1.0E-4; paired-read orientation, yes. Reads properly mapped in pair were extracted, and realigned to the reference with the same parameters. Whole-genome sequencing reads derived from Koshihikari rice (DRR000022–DRR000030) were downloaded from the Sequence Read Archive, and single-end 32-bp reads were aligned to the reference using the same parameters. After removal of duplicated reads, coverage was analysed using SAMtools 0.1.18. Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) candidates were screened using the CLC Genomics Workbench 5.1 with the following parameters: window length, 11; maximum gap and mismatch count, 3; minimum coverage, 1; minimum variant frequency, 75%. Deletion/insertion polymorphism (DIP) candidates were screened by using the CLC Genomics Workbench 5.1 with the following parameters: minimum coverage, 1; minimum frequency, 50%.2.2. mRNA-Seq analysisTotal RNA was isolated from developing rice seeds at 10–20 days after flowering from each of three independent a123 and OSCR11 plants using a standard phenol/SDS method.12 Following DNase I treatment, mRNAs were enriched using two iterations of a Dynabeads mRNA purification kit (Life Technologies). Libraries were generated using an Ion total RNA-Seq v2 kit (Life Technologies) and sequenced by Ion Torrent PGM (Life Technologies) with an Ion 318 Chip (Life Technologies). Low-quality nucleotides (Phred <Q20) were trimmed, and reads were then mapped onto the RAP-DB annotation13 of the IRGSP-1.0 genome using the CLC Genomics Workbench 5.1, allowing two mismatches for short reads, and requiring a minimum length and similarity of 0.9 for long reads. Non-uniquely aligning reads were randomly mapped. Three biological replicates were analysed for each line, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified with the DESeq R package using a 5% false discovery rate (FDR) cut-off.143. Results and Discussion3.1. Rice genome re-sequencingWhole-genome sequencing of a homozygous T5 transgenic OSCR11 plant and its parental line a123 was performed on the Illumina HiSeq2000 platform. We also obtained the genome sequence data of Koshihikari, the background cultivar of a123, from the previous report.15 We obtained 259, 223, and 268 million high-quality reads for Koshihikari, a123, and OSCR11, respectively (Supplementary Table S1). Several reports have shown that Agrobacterium genome sequences are occasionally integrated into the host genome together with T-DNA.16,17 To address this issue, we aligned OSCR11 reads to the Agrobacterium C58 strain reference genome18 using the BWA software.19 We did not detect any OSCR11 whole-genome sequence reads that aligned with C58, indicating that no portions of the Agrobacterium genome had been integrated into the OSCR11 rice genome.3.2. Detection of structural variationsTo detect SVs, we mapped all of our rice sequence reads against the Nipponbare reference genome (Os-Nipponbare-Reference-IRGSP-1.0) using the CLC Genomics Workbench 5.1. We screened SV candidates in OSCR11 by comparing the computed distances of the paired-end reads with their locations within the Nipponbare reference. A total of 149 insertions, 280 deletions, 12 inversions, and 39 instances of interchromosome swapping were called. We validated these SVs by manual inspection of read alignments and found that all of the detected insertions, inversions, and interchromosome swappings were false positives. Although in each case several sequence reads supported the detected polymorphism, these regions were also covered by paired-end reads that supported the Nipponbare reference genome arrangement. Following manual inspection of the sequence alignments, a total of 187 higher-confidence deletions remained. Deletion length varied from 67 bp to 54 kb, and no deletions were detected on chr06 (Supplementary Fig. S1). We compared the mapping results obtained with OSCR11, a123, and Koshihikari for deletions, and found an OSCR11 specific deletion of 810 bp on chr02 of OSCR11 (Fig. 2A). The deletion was confirmed by genomic PCR and DNA sequencing (Fig. 2B). Active transposons have been reported in rice callus.20 The deleted region on chr02 of OSCR11 contains several repeat units that are similar to transposons, but the junction sequences revealed that transposon translocation was not involved in this deletion (Fig. 2A). This result contrasts to previous reports analysing somaclonal variations in Arabidopsis and rice, in which SVs were not detected.21,22 However, since a deletion was only detected at a single locus and deletions in repeat regions are common,23 we could not conclude the deletion was caused by Agrobacterium infection. There are no annotated rice genes within the 10-kb region around the deletion, suggesting that the deletion is unlikely to alter the expression of nearby genes. OSCR11-specific 810-bp deletion.

(B) Confirmation of the OSCR11-specific deletion by PCR using primers indicated in A.3.3. Detection of transformation- and mutagenesis-induced polymorphismsTo identify specific SNPs and DIPs caused by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation procedures and mutagenesis by gamma ray and EMS, we used the Nipponbare genome as a reference to map our high-quality and clonal reads (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). For OSCR11 and a123, paired reads with a mapping distance of ~500 bp were used. Reads that mapped non-uniquely to multiple genomic positions were discarded in this analysis. Uniquely mapped reads covered 81–95% of the reference genome with 11.3–33.2× coverage. Both coverage and depth of coverage for each chromosome were similar (Supplementary Table S2). Rice SNP candidates supported by four or more reads using Illumina HiSeq sequencing and the IRGSP-1.0 genome as a reference are considered to be high-confidence SNPs.21 Therefore, we screened putative SNP using this criterion. Because the depth of coverage across the genome was different between lines, it was difficult to specifically determine whether the SNPs are unique to any particular genotype. To discriminate transformation-induced polymorphisms from false positives, we excluded polymorphisms (a) whose location was not covered by a123 reads, or (b) that were called in Koshihikari or a123 and supported by at least one SNP-containing read in OSCR11. Similarly, to discriminate mutagenesis-induced polymorphisms from false positives, we excluded polymorphisms (a) whose location was not covered in Koshihikari and OSCR11 or (b) that were called in Koshihikari.In agreement with the results of a previous study,15 63 480 SNPs relative to the Nipponbare reference were detected by four or more reads in Koshihikari, and 67 721 and 93 110 SNPs relative to Nipponbare were detected in a123 and OSCR11, respectively (Table 1). We identified 167 transformation-induced SNPs and 939 mutagenesis-induced SNPs, covering 95.3% and 93.1% of the genome, respectively (Tables 1 and 2). The ratio of transitions-to-transversions in transformation-induced SNPs was 1.0, which is similar to the ratio detected during somaclonal variation (Fig. 3A).21,22 In contrast, the transition : transversion ratio in mutagenesis-induced SNPs was 2.1, which is similar to the 2.4~2.7 ratio reported for spontaneous mutations in Arabidopsis (Fig. 3A).24 Most mutations caused by EMS are transitions, which reflect the chemical properties of this mutagen.25 Morita et al.26 reported that base substitutions accounted for 12.5% of mutations caused by gamma ray-inducing DSB in rice, and all of them were transversions. The relatively high transition-to-transversion rate in this study may reflect these tendencies.

DIPs preferentially occurred in repetitive regions including homopolymers and microsatellites, as previously reported.22 We detected 28 transformation-induced DIPs and 3147 mutagenesis-induced DIPs, covering 95.3% and 93.1% of the genome, respectively (Tables 1 and 2). Transformation-induced DIPs were 1 or 2 bp in size except for one 5-bp deletion (Fig. 3B). Among them, all of the 1- or 2-bp DIPs occurred in a mono- or di-nucleotide context, but the 5-bp deletion (chr09: 13005724) did not occur in a polymeric context (Fig. 3C). One or two bp DIPs may be generated by slippage during DNA replication. In Arabidopsis, somaclonal DIPs are 1 or 2 bp insertions or deletions in a polymeric context.22 The 5-bp deletion might have been the result of the improper repair of a DSB caused by Agrobacterium infection, but without T-DNA integration. However, since 5-bp deletions in a non-polymeric context have been detected among mutagenesis-induced DIPs (Fig. 3B), it might happen spontaneously.3.4. Comparison of mutation ratesWe identified a total of 195 transformation-induced mutations and 4086 mutagenesis-induced mutations, and mutation rates (number of mutations/covered sites) were 5.5 × 10-7 and 1.2 × 10-5, respectively. Both transformation-induced and mutagenesis-induced mutations were distributed across the genome in a largely uniform pattern, suggesting that they were randomly produced at a genome-wide level (Supplementary Fig. S2). The calculated mutagenesis rates are 91- and 2000-fold higher than the spontaneous mutation rate of 6.0 × 10-9 mutations/effective site calculated for Arabidopsis.24 Jiang et al.22 reported a theoretical mutation rate in Arabidopsis by multiplying the detected mutation rate by 4, resulting in a mutation rate of 1.1 × 10-6. The detected somaclonal mutation rate in Arabidopsis after 3 weeks of cell culture is ~2.6 × 10-7. Miyao et al.21 reported a somaclonal mutation rate of 1.7 × 10-6 in rice after 5 months of cell culture. In the transformation process used for establishing the transgenic OSCR11 line, cell culture was performed for ~2 months (callus induction: ~1 month, Agrobacterium infection: 3 days, and selection: ~1 month). Interestingly, somaclonal mutation rate per cell culture week (Arabidopsis: 0.86 × 10-7 and rice: 0.85 × 10-7)21,22 and the transformation mutation rate per cell culture week (0.68 × 10-7: in this study) were similar. Considering the base substitution rate of transformation-induced SNPs was highly comparable with the rate induced by somaclonal variation, transformation-induced SNPs cannot be readily distinguished from somaclonal variants. These results support previous reports, showing that cell culture is a primary mutation source during Agrobacterium-mediated transformation.5Among the transformation-induced mutations, 5.6% (11 SNPs) were non-synonymous, and altered the amino acid sequences of 11 genes (Tables 1, 2, and Supplementary Table S3). Among the mutagenesis-induced mutations, 3.9% (40 SNPs, 44 deletions, and 74 insertions) were non-synonymous, and altered the amino acid sequences of 140 genes (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S4). Numbers of non-synonymous mutations caused by transformation and mutagenesis were much less than those between japonica rice cultivars Koshihikari (794 genes) or Omachi (1017 genes) and Nipponbare.15,27 Although we did not observe deleterious phenotypes in our rice lines, the non-synonymous mutations induced by transformation might cause some phenotypes under specific conditions. The mutations detected showed a largely uniform distribution and did not preferentially accumulate near the T-DNA insertion site or near loci involved in the glutelin-reduced trait (Supplementary Fig. S2). Thus, undesired mutations can be easily eliminated by crossing.3.5. Transcriptome analysis of the a123 and OSCR11 endospermsTo investigate the influence of Agrobacterium-mediated transformation on the rice transcriptome, we performed strand-specific mRNA-Seq in the maturing endosperm of a123 and OSCR11 lines using Ion Torrent PGM. When OSCR11 seeds are provided to allergy patients as an edible vaccine, the embryo is removed by polishing; therefore, RNA was extracted from de-hulled endosperms whose embryos had been cut out. Since activities of promoters used for transgene expression are highest at 10–20 days after flowering, we chose this stage to analyse. We used single-end reads that mapped to known annotated exons (Supplementary Table S5). We identified only 28 DEGs between OSCR11 and a123 using a FDR of <0.05 (Table 3 and Supplementary Fig. S3), which is comparable with the small number of DEGs detected previously between transgenic rice and wild-type rice using microarray analyses. Among the DEGs, 11 were related to quality control proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), such as chaperones28,29 (Table 3). The altered expression of these genes is likely caused by the accumulation of recombinant proteins (cedar pollen allergens) that induce ER stress. OsbZIP50 is a cytoplasmic splice variant regulated by OsIRE1and is a molecular marker of strong ER stress.28 However, we did not detect this spliced transcript, indicating that the OSCR11 endosperm is not under strong ER stress. In OSCR11, the T-DNA was inserted 27 bp upstream of the Os08g0107400 5'-UTR, suggesting that the upregulation of Os08g0107400 was probably caused by the T-DNA insertion. Increased expression of GluA-2/Os10g0400200 and Os10g0207500, components of T-DNA,3 were directly derived from the transformed T-DNA. Half of DEGs, described above, could be explained by T-DNA insertion and introduced genes, or expected. Differentially expressed genes between a123 and OSCR11Fold changes are represented as log2 phase (OSCR11 to a123).Expression levels are normalized to Reads Per Kilobase of exon per Million mapped reads (RPKM).N/A in Fold change indicating RPKM in a line was >0, but the other was 0.aGenes associated with ER stress.bGenes directly related to integrated T-DNA.Differentially expressed genes between a123 and OSCR11Fold changes are represented as log2 phase (OSCR11 to a123).Expression levels are normalized to Reads Per Kilobase of exon per Million mapped reads (RPKM).N/A in Fold change indicating RPKM in a line was >0, but the other was 0.aGenes associated with ER stress.bGenes directly related to integrated T-DNA.We detected no transformation-induced SNPs or DIPs within 2 kb upstream of any DEG, suggesting that chromosome damage caused by the transformation event had little effect on the endosperm transcriptome. Signalling pathways operating downstream of a few polymorphic genes, or the ER stress that accompanies transgene transformation, may be responsible for the differential gene expression in OSCR11. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that epigenetic memory of stress or other factors are responsible for the DEGs that were not directly or indirectly caused by the T-DNA insertion.If there are significant damages on host genome by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, there should be many base transversions and numerous DSB repair traces such as deletions in non-polymeric contexts, like gamma-ray treatment causes them. We demonstrated that mutations caused by the transformation event used in developing a transgenic OSCR11 rice line were mainly induced during the cell culture step and were almost indistinguishable from those associated with somaclonal variation, suggesting that there was an undetectable level of genomic damage, if any, caused by Agrobacterium infection other than T-DNA insertion. Furthermore, the calculated mutation rate between OSCR11 and the host rice line a123 was significantly lower than that between a123 and the original cultivar Koshihikari. Thus, the observed low frequency of mutation is consistent with only a subtle transcriptome difference between OSCR11 and a123. The transformation procedures employed in this study are standard practices in many laboratories, but the culture media were optimized for Koshihikari and its derivative cultivars. We did not perform any backcrosses or screening based on the agronomic traits of OSCR11, yet OSCR11 was almost identical to a123 at the genomic level. Although it will be necessary to analyse more lines to establish the general differences between GM crops and non-GM crops, we concluded that this transgenic line is almost identical to a123 at the genomic level.Rapid progress has been made in gene targeting and recombination technologies to specifically edit target loci within the rice genome,30–32 but the potential side effects of Agrobacterium-mediated transformation have not been fully explored. To obtain transgenic crops whose genome is identical to that of the host in every respect except for specific target loci, multiple backcrosses will be necessary. Our study provides valuable information for researchers who use transgenic approaches to improve crop yields and other traits. Classical molecular techniques such as Southern blotting are still useful and necessary to compare genetic identity, but NGS platforms have the added potential of whole-genome analysis of transgenic plants. Combining whole-genome sequencing with transcriptome analysis is a robust method to assess the genome integrity of a transgenic plant in relation to its host crop.Supplementary dataSupplementary Data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work is supported by grants from the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Japan, ‘Agri-Health Translational Research Project’ grant to F.T., and ‘Development of Genome Information Database System for Innovation of Crop and Livestock Production’ to T.I.We thank E.
