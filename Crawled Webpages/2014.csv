IntroductionAmphibians have been used as vertebrate models for the experimentalist since the 19th century. Since 50 years or so, Xenopus laevis is the most widely used anuran amphibian research organism,1 an important model of vertebrate cell biology and development for many decades.2 However, of the thousands of species, only two closely related species (Xenopus silurana tropicalis and X. laevis) have considerable genomic resources: published genome of the Pipid, Xenopus (silurana) tropicalis, and transcript information of X. laevis.3,4Xenopus tropicalis, of which genome analysis results show that at least 1700 predicted genes identified to be human disease genes, occupies a key phylogenetic position among amniots and teleost fish.4 But, understanding of the genome requires large quality of transcripts as reference sequences. The transcriptome is comprised of a comprehensive set of genes active in selected tissues and species. Therefore, understanding global dynamics of the transcriptome is essential for interpreting genome expanded information and unravelling phenotypic variation.5In our previous studies, the Chinese red belly frog (Bombina maxima) has various different skin secretions defencing external stimulus, which is an endemic amphibian and lives in very harsh environments of the mountainous regions of southwestern China.6–9 This study was motivated by two reasons. First, genome-wide or transcriptome-wide approaches are now being applied to whole-genome wide duplication of Xenopodinae.10 However, the amphibian is still the lack of genomic resources like genomic sequences and transcriptome dataset, in spite of two Xenopus toads' genome or transcriptome being available. Secondly, more and more investigators found that Xenopus model offers an invaluable research tool for immunological research.11 In addition, the most ancient mechanism of immunity was considered to be direct microbicidal activity of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) in the human immune system.12 In frogs, extremely abundant and diverse AMPs have been reported in our previous studies.13 A lot of AMPs were also rich in B. maxima.7 In recent studies, the immune system of amphibian species is nearly as complex as that of mammals.11 But, research on the immune system of anuran amphibians exclusively relies on X. laevis as a model.14Bombina and Xenoanura diverged in the middle Jurassic and the ancestor of Bombina appeared the Eocene of Palaeogene.15 From the living environment and skin secretions of B. maxima, it could have a more mature immune system compared with Xenopus, potentially suited to be as a new model for identifying the nature of innate or adaptive immunity in vertebrates. Thus, we performed the latest paired-end RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) techniques16 to transcriptome-wide depict its feature of the immune system. The database of the transcriptome will submit to public databases for free to use.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Animals and ethicsBombina maxima, used here were obtained from the Kunming Institute of Zoology, which has been used in our previous studies. All the animal studies were reviewed and approved by the animal care and use committee of Kunming Institute of Zoology, The Chinese Academy of Sciences.2.2. Construction of the transcriptomeSkin and blood tissues were sampled from four adult frogs with no injury. RNA extraction and library construction are described in detail in Supplementary information S1. Transcriptome-sequencing clean reads is basis for assembly and following analysis (the data are archived at the NCBI Sequence Read Archive under accession number SRA058577; http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra). Transcriptome is assembled in de novo (Supplementary information S2).2.3. Transcriptome functional annotationThe transcript sequences were identified with the coding sequence (CDS) to search for gene ontology (GO) terms (Supplementary information S3). All translated protein sequences were identified protein domain prediction. Tissue-specific genes and comparative expression analysis are described in Supplementary information S4. Identification of novel non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) is identified as Tan's methods.17 The detailed description is mentioned in Supplementary information S5.2.4. Tissue expression of selected immune-related genesWe used cDNA as a template for reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) amplification of the coding regions of several given immune genes. Equal amounts of total RNA (1.05 µg) from each tissue were pooled for cDNA generation (Supplementary information S6). Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was carried out using the LightCycler® 480 (Roche, Switzerland) with SYBR premix Ex Taq II (TaKaRa, Japan). Samples were run in triplicates. Primers used in qRT-PCR are shown in Supplementary Table S1. For each primer, a melting curve of the PCR product was also performed to ensure the absence of artefacts. The comparative crossing points (<U+0394>CP) method18 was used for the relative quantification of the respective transcript expression. Expression values were normalized using an endogenous beta-actin.2.5. Stimulation of immune response in vitro and in vivoIn vivo immune response was stimulated by intraperitoneal injection of bacteria or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In vitro stimulation were carried out on splenocytes from B. maxima. The detailed methods are described in Supplementary information S8.3. Results and Discussion3.1. Sequencing and transcriptome assemblycDNAs prepared from skin and blood tissues of B. maxima were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq™ 2000. After sequencing, 59 820 004 and 58 492 250 raw reads was separately obtained from skin and blood tissue in B. maxima. Cleaning the low-quality reads, we acquired 55 533 592 (4 998 023 280 bp from skin tissue) and 54 967 354 (4 947 061 860 bp from blood tissue) clean reads (Table 1). Using the Trinity program to assemble clean reads to contigs in de novo, a total of 172 119 contigs were separately generated from these two tissues. After contigs assembly, a total of 88 213 putative gene objects (all unigenes) were obtained ranging from 200 to 20 882 bp and 602 bp in average length. The size of unigenes >500 bp was 27 661. The largest unigenes had 20 882 bp, and the N50 of unigenes was 868 bp (Table 1). The length of all unigene sequences was >200 bp and 41.0% (36 209) were >499 bp in length (Supplementary Fig. S1). In term of sequence completeness, we used a less stringent but broadly adopted definition, considering a sequence to be full length if it comprises at least the complete CDS.19 Of the 88 213 (41.2%) unigenes, 36 319 had CDS matches with direction possessed significant similarity (cut-off E-value of 1e-6) with best-hit blast results. Of 88 213 (3.5%) CDS sequences, 3129 were produced by ESTScan program, which cannot to be aligned to known databases. Finally, a total of 39 448 unigene sequences had the complete CDS (Supplementary Fig. S1). Summary of sequencing, assembly and analysis of B. maxima transcriptomeaQ20: percentage is the proportion of nucleotides with a quality value >20 in reads.bN50: unigene length-weighted median.Summary of sequencing, assembly and analysis of B. maxima transcriptomeaQ20: percentage is the proportion of nucleotides with a quality value >20 in reads.bN50: unigene length-weighted median.3.2. Function annotationSeveral complementary methods were used to annotate the assembled sequences. To begin with using BLASTX and BLASTN, the assembled sequences were searched against the Nr, Swiss-Prot protein databases and Nt nucleotides database (cut-off E-value of 1e-6). Of the 88 213 assembled sequences, 35 457 (Nr, 40.2%), 30 413 (Swiss-Prot, 34.5%) and 27 622 (Nt, 31.3%) had significant matches. The more detailed analysis of the blast top 30 hits is shown in Supplementary Fig. S2. We compared the transcriptome with CDS with that of human (Ensemble data release 69) and X. tropicalis (Xenbase, Xentr7_2). The overlap between transcripts from the transcriptome of Bombina and Xenopus is larger than the others (Fig. 1A). In total, above two times more transcripts of B. maxima have the orthologs in X. tropicalis, compared with human. However, the most of transcripts from B. maxima have no orthologs with human and X. tropicalis. Although ~32% of transcripts from B. maxima have its orthologs in Xenopus, obviously most of the transcripts were identified to be species-specific transcripts or novel-spliced transcripts of this frog and Xenopus. To determine the expression level of the transcripts in skin and blood tissues, we mapped the raw reads to the assembled sequences. The reads per kilobase per million (RPKM) values of the transcripts are shown in Fig. 1B. It depicts that gene with high expression has distinct biases for skin, compared with the blood. Functional profiles of the transcriptome. (A) The venn diagram shows the comparison of the transcriptome between B. maxima, X. laevis and human. The data of B. maxima are composed of transcripts with CDS from the transcriptome. The transcriptome of X. laevis and human is including of all cDNA sequences.

Of these, 11 905 (33.6%) were assigned to one or more 3423 GO terms. As reported in other Xenopus transcriptome studies,3 the largest proportion of transcripts fell into 2–3 broad and general categories as follows: ‘Biological Process’, ‘Molecular Function’ and ‘Cellular Component’ (Supplementary Fig. S3). These results were similarly found in Mytilus edulis,20Hypophthalmichthys molitrix,21Sus scrofa22. As our expectation, a great amount of transcripts were involved in localization process (2383, 20.02%) and development process (2204, 18.51%), corresponding to the results of X. tropicalis transcriptome.17 Meanwhile, annotation of the 88 213 unigene sequences using Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG) of protein databases generated the results for 9625 putative proteins. The COG annotated putative proteins ranged functionally into at least 25 molecular families, including cell cycle control, cell membrane biogenesis, immune defence and signal transduction (Supplementary Fig. S4), in accordance with the categories of GO annotation described above.To further analyse the tissue-specific genes, the strict filter was performed as Supplementary methods. Finally, 12 608 (14.3%) and 6771 (7.7%) unigenes were identified to be skin-specific and blood-specific genes (Fig. 1C). Compared with blood-specific genes, the skin-specific genes have a large proportion of high-expressed genes (Fig. 1D), 70 skin-specific genes whose RPKM values were >50. As our expectation, most of them were related to epithelial cell growth, wound healing and AMPs. One of high-expressed AMP—Maximin S2, isolated from skin secretion in our previous work, was identified to be as the skin-specific gene. Besides the Maximin S2, a fungicide antimicrobial peptide, Holotricin, was also a high-expressed skin-specific protein, which was not isolated from skin secretions in our previous work. In the high-expressed skin-specific genes, more and more epithelial cells' components were identified with highest RPKM values, such as WAP, Desmoglein-1. Our results responses the fact that this frog can be lived well in the harsh environment.Next, we examined the unannotated transcripts (47 582, 53.9% of all transcripts) for protein-coding transcripts potential, leaving 47 112 transcripts as potential ncRNAs. As methods of Supplementary information S5, we finally identified 1183 ncRNAs (Fig. 1E), which possess at least 70% sequence identity to known non-coding genes. These ncRNAs serve as the definite ncRNAs in B. maxima. Clustering analysis reveals that these genes can be broadly divided into three clusters (Fig. 1F). The first cluster corresponds to the transcripts whose expression levels had great variations between skin and blood tissue. The second cluster contains the genes whose high expressions were gradually increased over skin to blood. It indicates that the ncRNAs play important roles in skin and blood. The third cluster appears to contain the genes that are sharply degraded with high expression in blood, compared with skin. Not all ncRNAs derived from skin and blood tissues, we mapped the raw reads to ncRNAs transcripts and found that there were 146 (12.3%) skin-specific and 46 (3.9%) blood-specific ncRNAs (Supplementary Table S2). Collectively, our analysis has identified with confidence a total of 47 112 potential ncRNAs and 1183 definite ncRNAs. We observed that the majority of these ncRNAs appears to be lowly expressed, with 69.0% of them (or 815 transcripts) having maximum RPKM of <5. In addition, the non-coding transcripts that we found in this study appear to be performing tissue-specific function. This collection of ncRNAs provides a rich resource for future functional studies, which will greatly enhance our understanding the genetic adaption of the frog.3.3. KEGG pathways analysisA total of 24 579 assembled sequences were identified to occur in 242 predicted KEGG pathways. The number of sequences ranged from 2 to 2722. The top 20 pathways with the highest number of sequences are shown in Table 2, and the maximum of transcripts was found in the metabolic pathways (n = 2722). Metabolic pathways, implicated the intracellular metabolic pathways control immune tolerance and regulation of stem cell behaviour and life span,23 showed the highest number of transcripts here and corresponded to the results of GO annotation described above and published transcriptome report.21,22 As the previous report of X. tropicalis genome, 7% of protein-coding gene orthologs were identified to be human disease genes.4 We also identified 11.17% (2745) of transcripts related disease using KEGG analysis, related disease including Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease (n = 619), Chagas disease (American trypanosomiasis, n = 280), Parkinson's disease (191), Autoimmune thyroid disease (n = 131), Graft-versus-host disease (n = 121), Prion diseases (n = 116). Remarkably, 2693 (10.95% of 24 579 transcripts annotated by KEGG analysis) transcripts were identified to be related to cancer pathways and specified cancer (small-cell lung cancer, prostate cancer, endometrial cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer, bladder cancer and thyroid cancer). This analysis and annotation may be useful for further study and great interest for other researchers. Summary of top 20 pathways with highest gene numbersSummary of top 20 pathways with highest gene numbers3.4. Protein domains predictionInterProScan identified 55 758 protein domains (6912 types) among 22 241 unigene sequences. The protein domains abundantly occurred in immunoglobulin-related domains (n = 1802), Zinc finger, C2H2 (n = 864; IPR007087), followed by reverse transcriptase (n = 802; IPR000477), Zinc finger, C2H2-like (n = 748; IPR015880), Zinc finger, C2H2-type/integrase, DNA binding (n = 709; IPR013087) and Zinc finger, RING/FYVE/PHD type (n = 387; IPR013083) (Fig. 2). A total of 4416 transcripts (5.0% of the transcriptome) with protein domains including Zinc finger keyword were identified, which comprise 80 types of protein domain. Usually, the most common DNA-binding motif and transcription factors contain one or more capable of making sequence-specific recognition of DNA and also binding to RNA and protein targets.24 Comparing with other species' transcriptome or genome,25,26 Zinc finger protein domain was enriched in all scanned protein domains, such as 3.3% in Macrobrachiumrosenbergii transcriptome and 2.6% in the mouse transcriptome. The distribution of protein domains predicted in B. maxima unigenes. The protein domain prediction was obtained by the InterProScan software. Remarkably, the sum of immunoglobulin-related domain is higher than others.The distribution of protein domains predicted in B. maxima unigenes. The protein domain prediction was obtained by the InterProScan software. Remarkably, the sum of immunoglobulin-related domain is higher than others.Among the immunoglobulin-related domains, a total of 653 immunoglobulin (Ig)-like-fold domains (IPR013783) and 318 immunoglobulin-like domains (IPR007110) were predicted (Fig. 2). Ig-like-fold domains are involved in a variety of functions playing essential roles in the vertebrate immune response and many other processes, involved with protein–protein interactions with their ß-sheets. Ig-like-related domains were also found in other published species' transcriptome. However, its proportion in M. rosenbergii (0.9% of Ig-like-fold domains in 8411 detected contigs) was much less than that in B. maxima (2.9% of 22 241 input sequences). Moreover, the immunoglobulin provides further links between vertebrate immune systems. Interestingly, we found a high number of repeating units ending with Trp-Asp (WD)-containing domains (4.6% of the CDS), including WD40/YVTN repeat-like-containing domains (IPR015943; n = 423), WD40-repeat-like-containing domains (IPR011046; n = 303), WD40-repeat subgroup (IPR019781; n = 300), WD40-repeat domains (IPR001680; n = 281), WD40-repeat-containing domains (IPR017986; n = 267) and WD40-repeat 2 (IPR019782; n = 254) domains. In contrast to published domain prediction data, 2.1% of the transcripts with WD40-repeat domains in the M. rosenbergii transcriptome. These domains are involved in functions ranging from signal transduction transcription regulation to cell cycle control and apoptosis.27 In Xenopus, the WD40-repeat domains were present in wdr36, traf51 and pik3r4 related to transcriptional regulation and epigenetic regulation in the latest report.173.5. Genes related to the innate immune systemInnate immune system (IIS) is the ancient defence system and first defence line of multicellular organisms against various infectious agents. We identified 1501transcripts (570 genes) involved in the immune system process. Of these, a total of 32 transcripts and at least 11 different Toll-like receptors (TLRs) were identified in B. maxima, including TLR1, TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR6, TLR7, TLR8 and Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table S3). The TLRs signalling pathway is primarily dependent on TLR2 and TLR4. In humans, TLR2 binds LPS in the presence of LPS-binding protein (LBP) and CD14, and then induces nuclear factor (NF)-<U+03BA>B activation. In B. maxima, lipoprotein and peptidoglycan can induce the TLR signalling pathway in B. maxima, indicated by the predicted pathway map (Fig. 4A). The expression of several key molecules activated by the signalling pathway was validated in B. maxima (Fig. 4B and Supplementary Table S4). We detected the expression of TLR2 and TLR4 using qRT-PCR, and then found that TLR2 and TLR4 show a peak expression in spleen, kidney, stomach and liver (Fig. 4D). In digital expression genes analysis (Fig. 4C), the clustered expression of genes in skin and blood was divided into major three clusters. The first cluster contains genes whose expression in skin and blood keep in the medium level, comparing with others. Most of them are downstream genes of the signalling pathway. The second cluster corresponds to genes whose expression in skin was higher than that in blood except for its first branch. The third cluster contains genes with highest expression in the TLR pathway of B. maxima. The putative genes related to the immune system in B. maxima.

In MyD88-dependent pathway, it leads to the activation of IRAK. In MyD88-independent pathway, TRIF and Rac1 are the main adaptor protein and interact with TRAF3 or PI3K to activate IRF or AKT.

Results are the mean crossing points (<U+0394>CP) value ± SEM (n = 3 technical triplicates).CD14 transcripts of B. maxima were not mapped to the pathway determined by KEGG annotation. The similarity of CD14 in B. maxima was closely identical to that of Taeniopygia guttata and also to TLR2 type 2 of Amazona albifrons. In addition to previous studies, fish, of which TLR4 is not response to LPS, are resistant to endotoxic shock.28 In frog, the TLR4 is respond to LPS as a receptor in urinary bladder epithelial cells.29 As the pathway prediction, it showed that TLR4 might be failing to respond to LPS through LBP binding to CD14 induced the pathway. Hence, the fact that TLR4 of B. maxima can recognize the LPS to induce the pathway remains to be elucidated. Then, in addition to in silico analysis, we detected the response to LPS or bacteria both in vitro and in vivo. Interleukin (IL)-1ß and IL-8 are pro-inflammatory cytokines that play pivotal role in the innate immunity. In response to LPS stimulation, it can be activated in dependent of TLRs activation.30 We detected the IL-1ß and IL8 secretion by B. maxima splenocytes after LPS or bacteria stimulation. The results from RT-PCR demonstrated that the mRNA level elevated than that of unstimulated (Fig. 5A). LPS and bacteria stimulation upregulated the intracellular level of pro-IL-1ß, but LPS only slightly enhanced the secretion of mature IL-1ß. It seems that bacteria strongly enhanced the expression and secretion of IL-1ß (Fig. 5B). Western blotting of IL-8 revealed that LPS and bacteria enhanced the secretion of IL-8 by splenocytes (Fig. 5B). The secretion of IL-1ß and IL-8 upon LPS and bacteria stimulation were also tested in vivo. The results demonstrated that after intraperitoneal administration of either LPS or bacteria, IL-1ß and -8 could be found in the peritoneum exudate fluids (Fig. 5D). LPS and bacteria induced the change of peritoneum cell proportion, and also the upregulated proportion of cells was identified to be monocyte-like cells (Fig. 5E). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and bacteria induced pro-inflammatory caspase activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion in vitro and in vivo. (A) Splenocytes were isolated from B. maxima spleen and stimulated with LPS (8 µg/ml) or bacteria (3 × 108cfu/ml) for 2 h. The cells were collected for RT-PCR of IL-1ßand IL-8. Either LPS or bacteria can upregulate the mRNA level of IL-1ß and IL-8. (B) Splenocytes were incubated with LPS or bacteria. The cells and the supernatants were collected for western blotting of IL-1ß and IL-8. (C) Splenocytes stimulated with LPS or bacteria were lysed for the detection of caspase-1 activation by western blotting. The band of ~20 kDa represents the presence of activated caspase-1. (D) Bombina maxima weighted 25 ± 5 g were injected intraperitoneally with LPS (50 mg/kg in 0.1 ml PBS) or bacteria (3 × 108cfu in 0.1 ml PBS, Staphylococcus aureus, ATCC25923). Two hours after injection, peritoneum exudates were harvested, IL-1ß and IL-8 were detected by western blot. (E) Two hours after injection, peritoneal cells were harvested and analysed by flow cytometry. The mostly changed subset of cells was stained and photographed.Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and bacteria induced pro-inflammatory caspase activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion in vitro and in vivo.

The mostly changed subset of cells was stained and photographed.The ligation of TLRs signalling occurs primarily through MyD88 (MyD88-dependent pathway) or other adapter proteins (TRAM, TRIF and MyD88-independent pathway). It leads to the induction of antimicrobial genes, cytokines and chemokines and maturation of dendritic cells (Fig. 4A). In TLR4 signal transduction, Mal (MyD88) is a necessary adaptor.31 We surely found MyD88 transcripts and that had nearly 2-fold expression in skin than in blood, containing Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain. But, the RPKM value of MyD88 in skin was a little great than in blood. In addition, MyD88 is required for Xenopus axis formation as binding protein with Toll/IL-1 receptors.32 In the MyD88-independent pathway, the putative transcripts of components were identified such as TRAF3, TBK1 and several IRFs (Fig. 4A and Supplementary Table S3).The complement system is a key subsystem in innate immunity, which is composed of many serum proteins associated with many important activities.33 A total of 157 transcripts were identified including C2, C3, C3d, C4a, C5, C6, factor B, factor D and factor I, etc. The most of key complement components were also detected with high expression in skin, stomach and lung tissues of B. maxima (Supplementary Fig. S5 and Table S3). The complement components usually share the short consensus domains, such as C9 with perforin-like domain. We analysed the domains contained in complement components of B. maxima. Most of the complement components shared CCP domain and Tryp SPc (trypsin-like serine protease) domain (Supplementary Table S5). But, the factor P (properdin factor) and factor B have thrombospondin_1 domain. These domains may play a important role in complement initiation and amplification. The regulator of complement activation (RCA) is essential for excessive C3 activation that often drives the consumption of the complement pathway and damages self tissue.34 We identified two RCA-coding proteins in B. maxima, ARC1 and ARC3, which are closely identical to the ARCs of Xenopus (Supplementary Fig. S5D and E). In addition to the lectin pathway, we also identified that a number of 22 transcripts highly expressed in B. Maxima, including Fcn1 (M-ficolin), Fcn2 (L-ficolin) and Fcn3 (H-ficolin). In our results, it shows a peak expression in spleen, kidney and stomach (Supplementary Fig. S5C).The cytokine network is an important homeostatic system with potent activities in immune surveillance, growth, developmental and repair processes.35 The important role of cytokines is controlling immune responses.36 We identified 42 interleukin/interleukin receptor transcripts in the B. maxima dataset. We did not found IL-2 transcripts in B. maxima the same as in Xenopus that involved in the bactericidal activity in the adaptive immune system (AIS).37 However, IL-34 and IL-7 receptors were identified in B. Maxima, with no orthologs of Xenopus (Supplementary Table S6). Another ancient and conserved cytokine is the macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) in the immune system. We identified one full-length MIF transcripts (345 bp), which is closely identical to the MIF of Xenopus, mouse and human (Supplementary Table S6). MIF is conserved across taxa from invertebrate to vertebrates,38 emerging as an important mediator of IIS.In human, TLRs engage in Type I interferon (IFN) (IFN-a/ß) production. In our results, the full-length Type I IFNs were not identified in the transcriptome. But, we found short-length (<200 bp) small contigs with the medium identity (40–60%) to Xenopus Type I IFNs, which have low consensus overlaps for further assembly to long transcripts. In interferon receptor pathways, Interferon-a/ß receptor (IFNAR) expressed eight transcripts in the transcriptome and mapped to the pathway (Fig. 4A and Supplementary Table S3). It shows high similarity to IFNAR of chicken (Supplementary Fig. S6A). The Type I IFNs all bind to IFNAR, which is composed of two chains: IFNAR1 and IFNAR2. The intracellular domain of IFNAR1 associates with Tyk2, whereas IFNAR2 associates with JAK1 and JAK2. Type I IFNs can induce the evolutionary pathway, JAK/STAT pathway. As expected, 12 transcripts with a high identity to JAK2 and STATs were found in B. maxima (Supplementary Table S3). These cytokines also regulate the expression of over 1200 genes, the products of which function as mediators of host immune responses,39 such as four families of IFN-inducible GTPases including dynamin-like GTPases, Mx proteins, p47 GTPases and very large inducible GTPase-1 (VLIG-1).40 These four families of IFN-inducible GTPases were all expressed in the B. maxima transcriptome (Supplementary Table S7). There were also great amounts of VLIG-1 from two major groups expressed in this frog (Supplementary Fig. S6B).NOD-like receptors (NLRs) and RIG-like receptors (RLRs) act as pathogen sensors for the recognition of intracellular bacteria and viruses. Twenty-nine transcripts of NLRs were present in B. maxima, including of 10 members such as NOD1, NLRC3, NLRC5, NAIP. Another intracellular sensor is retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) receptors. Two transcripts of RIG-I were identified in this transcriptome, with high similarity to Xenopus, then to mouse and human (Supplementary Table S6). Caspase-1 is considered as a typical member of pro-inflammatory caspases, including caspase-1, caspase-4, caspase-5 and caspase-12 in human and caspase-1, caspase-11 and caspase-12 in mouse.41 Caspase-1 is activated upon the assembly of inflammasome, which is assembled by the activation of NOD-like receptors including NLRP3, NLRP1 and NLRC4. In our present study, we tested whether the pro-inflammatory caspase, caspase-1, could be activated. The pro-enzyme form of caspase-1 is an ~45 kDa protein and cleaved into a p10 and p20 subunit after activation. The results showed that, after bacteria stimulation, the appearance of p20 was determined by western blotting using a rabbit polyclonal antibody against caspase-1 p20. Although it seems that LPS was also able to induce the activation of caspase-1, the ability is much weaker than bacteria (Fig. 5C). As the downstream executor of inflammasome, caspase-1 activation implied the presence of the NLR–inflammasome–caspase-1 pathway in this frog.3.6. Genes related to the adaptive immune systemCurrently available data indicate that the AIS suddenly emerged on vertebrate with jaws like a ‘big-bang’ event.42,43 So, it is fascinating to many scientist and investigators for its origin and evolution. The highly complex of AIS is based on intact B-cell receptor (BCR)–T-cell receptor (TCR)–major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-based AIS.43 We identified the transcripts of BCR, TCR and MHC in B. maxima (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table S3). Moreover, we amplified some key components of the AIS and sequencing the amplified results (Fig. 6A). All of validated molecules were high expressed in B. Maxima, excluding IgM compared with the others (Fig. 6B and Supplementary Table S4). From the components of AIS, the immune system of B. maxima is nearly parallel to the mammals'. BCR is composed of two parts, ligand-binding moiety and signal transduction moiety. We identified that IgM, Ig CH II/IgY, IgG and many segments of heavy chain and light chains were definitely presented in the B. maxima transcriptome (Supplementary Table S3). IgM, generally evolutionarily conserved, is most ancient antibody class and secreted monomer.44 IgY is first found in amphibians, the function of which is equal to IgG and IgE.45 Shorter forms of IgY are believed to neutralize pathogen without activation of inflammatory response.43 In addition, we identified the IgG-gamma heavy chain in B. maxima that is searched with no result in Xenopus (Supplementary Table S6). IgG is involved in high-affinity memory responses. In summary, frog is the most primitive species, whose IgY and IgG play a important role in immune response, with a classical memory response that is based on class switching after antigen stimulation. This result showed that IgY has already taken rearrangement and is essential for immune response in B. maxima. CD79A was also identified in the transcriptome and had two transcripts. Therefore, the component of BCRs is complete in the AIS of B. maxima. TCR is responsible for recognizing antigens bound to MHC molecules. Beta-chain TCR and gamma-chain TCR were identified, but alpha-chain and delta-chain had no transcripts expressed in skin and blood tissues. TCR is a heterodimer, consisting of a/ß-chains and <U+03B3>/d-chains. A translocon organization of both a- and ß-TCR genes is found in all animals, and the d- and a-TCR gene with close linkage.43 Hence, the a- and d-chain of TCR probably existed in B. maxima. Genes related to the adaptive immune system. (A) Several selected molecules of the AIS in B. maxima were amplified by RT-PCR using RNA from skin and blood tissues, primers designed according to the assembled sequences of the transcriptome. These molecules were identified by searching against known database and domain prediction. Each two transcripts from 18 MHC I and 11 MHC II were detected by RT-PCR. (B) Five key immune components were detected its expression in seven different tissues using qRT-PCR. Results are the mean <U+0394>CP value ± SEM (n = 3 technical triplicates). (C) Eighteen MHC Class I amino sequences were from B. maxima, and MHC I of Gallus gallus, MHC Ia and Ib of Homo sapiens, MHC Ia and Ib of Mus musculus and MHC I of X. laevis. The bootstrap values next to the nodes represent the percentage of 1000 replicate trees supporting the corresponding clade. (D) Eleven MHC Class II amino sequences were from B. maxima, and other MHC II proteins from above species.Genes related to the adaptive immune system.

(D) Eleven MHC Class II amino sequences were from B. maxima, and other MHC II proteins from above species.The MHC is defined by MHC Class I and Class II; the MHC Class I/II molecules are closely involved in antigen presentation and usually has multiple copies in the vertebrates.46 We identified 18 transcripts of MHC Class I and 11 transcripts of MHC Class II expressed in B. maxima. As the previous methods,47 we conservatively estimated that the minimum number of putative expressed MHC Class I and Class II was three and two loci indicated by transcripts clustering into three and two major groups without a reference genome (Fig. 6C and D). Multiple loci for MHC Class II have a profound impact on peptide binding and anti-infections.48 With multiple loci for MHC Class II, the frog has an ability to battle constantly intracellular infection, such as virus. Most Xenopus species have a single-expressed MHC Class I gene (Class Ia), which encodes receptor molecules to present intracellular pathogen and is closely linked to other genes assisting in antigen processing.49 MHC Class Ib gene belongs to a separate MHC lineage. The expressed multiple loci of MHC Class I/II is considered to be the crucial role acted by one or two rounds of whole-genome duplication (WGD) at stage of fish or amphibians.50 In fact, X. laevis expresses non-classical MHC Ib genes with similarity in sequence and structure to classical genes.51 From the constructed a phylogenetic tree (Fig. 6C), the MHC Class Ib have rapid rate of evolution compared with classical MHC Class Ia of B. maxima and X. laevis. The multiple sequence alignment of the selected MHC Class I sequences (Supplementary Fig. S7A) also shows that the rate of residue substitution to MHC Class Ia lower than that of MHC Class Ib from this frog and other vertebrates. The MHC Class Ia of X. laevis shows high identity to that of B. maxima, except in very few sites. And the conserved sites of MHC Class I exist great variances in this frog (marked with red box). Counterpart to MHC Class II (Supplementary Fig. S7B, marked with blue box), it shows that the conserved domain of four transcripts in B. maxima is high similarity to the human MHC Class II, instead of Xenopus, which is correspond to the phylogenetic tree analysis (Fig. 6D). The phylogenetic analysis revealed that these sequences clustered into distinct two clades. One of these clades is grouped into MHC Class Ib genes from higher vertebrates. From bootstrap values, MHC Class Ib was indeed a more rapid evolutional rate than MHC Class Ia. As to a single classical Class I locus expressed in X. tropicalis and X. laevis, the degree to which B. maxima is a good potential model for the anuran MHC.In summary, we have developed comprehensive transcriptome for B. maxima. Although there is extensive genome or transcriptome achieved in Xenopus, comparative analysis showed that difference exists between these two species' transcriptome. The data obtained is rich in gene transcripts related to disease and disease pathway, especially to immunity. Based on pathway prediction, we uncover the fact that TLRs can recognize the lipoproteins, peptidoglycan, LPS or bacteria in this frog. Furthermore, our results showed that NLR–inflammasome–caspase-1 pathway is present in this frog, which is not clear in other frogs including of Xenopus. Besides that active IIS, this frog can live well in harsh environment owing to its nearly parallel AIS to the mammal. In addition, tissue-specific genes and ncRNAs analysis initially reveal the genetic adaption of this frog.Authors' ContributionsY.Z., F.Z. and W.L. conceived the study. Manuscript wrote by F.Z.

IntroductionCurrent advances of next-generation sequencing technologies (NGS) have enabled us to acquire massive DNA sequence data from any types of samples.1 In particular, complex bacterial communities composed of numerous species in various environments including human body has become the practically feasible targets, and the analysis has been shifting to the DNA-based approach in conjugation with bioinformatics for enumerated data of metagenome and 16S rRNA gene (16S) produced by NGS.2–5 Among these approaches, pyrosequencing-based 16S gene analysis is rapid and cost effective to comprehensively evaluate the overall structure of bacterial communities and to identify species present in them, irrespective of the yet-uncultured species.6 This method includes targeted PCR amplification of 16S rRNA gene variable regions with appropriate primers, followed by sequencing of the 16S amplicons using 454 pyrosequencer.7–10 We recently developed the improved analytical pipeline for pyrosequencing data of 16S rRNA gene V1–V2 variable region for human gut microbiota, by reassessing a PCR primer sequence, clustering conditions of error-prone 16S reads, and the quality check process to effectively remove low-quality data, and thereby the pipeline provided the high quantitative accuracy to estimation of the bacterial composition and abundance in the community.10In this study, we applied our improved pipeline to the analysis of the human oral microbiota. The oral cavity is a large reservoir of bacteria of >700 species or phylotypes, and is profoundly relevant to host health and disease.11–14 Current studies reported that various oral symptoms such as aphthous stomatitis, oral ulcer, dry mouth, and pyostomatitis vegetans are frequently observed in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients.15–20 IBD, including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is a chronic, idiopathic, relapsing inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract.21,22 The most widely accepted mechanism of IBD pathogenesis includes inflammation due to altered host immune response in association with continuous stimulation from the resident gut microbiota.23–28 Many studies also revealed that the gut microbiota of IBD patients significantly differed from that of healthy controls (HCs), and is termed dysbiosis.29–34Similarly, oral manifestations observed in IBD patients suggest the association of oral microbiota with such manifestations, yet-limited information exists about the oral microbiota of IBD patients. We characterized the salivary microbiota of IBD patients and HCs by barcoded pyrosequencing analysis of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. We observed that the salivary microbiota in IBD patients significantly differed from that of HCs, and found particular bacterial species associated with dysbiosis. We also showed that the observed dysbiosis is strongly associated with elevated inflammatory response of several cytokines with depleted lysozyme in the saliva of IBD patients, some of which showed a strong correlation with the relative abundance of certain bacterial species. Thus, the present study demonstrates an association between dysbiosis of the salivary microbiota and change in the host's physiological state in IBD.2. Material and methods2.1. Patients and control groupsAll participants of the CD, UC, and HC groups were informed of the purpose of this study, and written consent was obtained. This project was approved by the ethical committee of University of the Ryukyus. Metadata collected at the time of sampling included various demographics and a medication history for each patient (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2).2.2. Sample collection and DNA extractionUnstimulated saliva collected from subjects was immediately frozen by liquid nitrogen and stored in -80°C until use. Salivary genomic DNA was prepared according to the literature with minor modifications.35Bacterial cells were harvested from 1 ml of saliva by centrifugation at 3300g for 10 min at 4°C. Bacterial pellets were suspended in 10 mM Tris–HCl/10 mM EDTA buffer and incubated with 15 mg/ml lysozyme (Sigma-Aldrich Co. LLC) for 1 h at 37°C. Purified achromopeptidase (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) was added to a final concentration of 2000 units/ml and samples were further incubated for 30 min. Ten percentage of (wt/vol) sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) and proteinase K (Merck Japan) were added to the suspension to final concentrations of 1% and 1 mg/ml, respectively, and samples were further incubated at 55°C for 1 h. The lysate was treated with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (Life Technologies Japan, Ltd.) and centrifuged at 3300g for 10 min. DNA was precipitated by adding 1/10 volume of 3 M sodium acetate (pH 4.5) and 2 volumes of ethanol (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) to the supernatant. DNA was pelleted by centrifugation at 3300g for 15 min at 4°C. DNA pellets were rinsed with 75% ethanol, dried and dissolved in 10 mM Tris–HCl/1 mM EDTA (TE) buffer. DNA was further treated with 1 mg/ml RNase A (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) at 37°C for 30 min, and precipitated by adding equal volumes of 20% PEG solution (PEG6000-2.5M NaCl). DNA was pelleted by centrifugation at 8060g at 4°C, rinsed twice with 75% ethanol, dried, and dissolved in TE buffer.2.3. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene-based analysisThe hypervariable V1–V2 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified by PCR with barcoded 27Fmod and 338R primers.10 PCR was performed in 50 µl of 1× Ex Taq PCR buffer composed of 10 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mM KCl, and 1.5 mM MgCl2 in the presence of 250 µM dNTP, 1 U Ex Taq polymerase (Takara Bio, Inc.), forward and reverse primers (0.2 µM) and ~20 ng template DNA. Thermal cycling consisted of initial denaturation at 96°C for 2 min, followed by 25 cycles of denaturation at 96°C for 30 s, annealing at 55°C for 45 s and extension at 72°C for 1 min, and final extension at 72°C on a 9700 PCR system (Life Technologies Japan, Ltd.). Negative controls were treated similarly, except that no template DNA was added to the PCR reactions. PCR products of ~370 bp were visualized by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels, while negative controls failed to produce visible PCR products and were excluded from further analysis. PCR amplicons were purified by AMPure XP magnetic purification beads (Beckman Coulter, Inc.), and quantified using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Assay Kit (Life Technologies Japan, Ltd.). Equal amounts of each PCR amplicon were mixed and then sequenced using either 454 GS FLX Titanium or 454 GS JUNIOR (Roche Applied Science).We developed and used an analysis pipeline for pyrosequencing data of the 16S rRNA gene V1–V2 region generated from oral microbiota. Based on sample specific barcodes, reads were assigned to each sample followed by the removal of reads lacking both forward and reverse primer sequences. Data were further denoised by removal of reads with average quality values <25 and possible chimeric sequences. For chimera checking and taxonomy assignment of the 16S rRNA data, we constructed our own databases from three publically available databases: Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) v. 10.27, CORE (http://microbiome.osu.edu/), and a reference genome sequence database obtained from the NCBI FTP site (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genbank/, December 2011). Reads having BLAST match lengths <90% with the representative sequence in the three databases were considered as chimeras and removed. Finally, filter-passed reads were used for further analysis after trimming off both primer sequences.All of the 16S rRNA sequence data used in this study were deposited in DDBJ/GenBank/EMBL under accession numbers: DRA000984–DRA000986.From the filter-passed reads, 3000 high-quality reads/sample were randomly chosen. The total reads (59 × 3000 reads) were then sorted according to average quality value and grouped into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using UCLUST (http://www.drive5.com/) with a sequence identity threshold of 96%. Taxonomic assignments were made according to the best BLAST-hit phylotype. Weighted and unweighted UniFrac metrics36 were used to assess the diversity of the salivary microbiota between the CD, UC, and HC groups. UniFrac distances were based on the fraction of branch length shared between two communities within a phylogenetic tree constructed from the 16S rRNA gene sequences from all communities being compared.2.4. ImmunoassaysThe centrifugal supernatant of unstimulated saliva was analyzed by the Luminex fluorescence technique, using the Bio-Plex Pro Human cytokine 27-Plex Assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. LL-37 (cathelicidin, hCAP-18) levels were measured by ELISA using the Human LL-37 ELISA Kit (Hycult Biotech, Uden, The Netherlands). IgA levels were measured using the EIA-sIgA Test (MBL, Nagoya, Japan). Salivary lysozyme levels were measured using turbidimetric technique (SRL Inc., Japan). Total protein concentrations were measured by the Bradford protein assay using bovine serum albumin as the standard. In this study, saliva samples of only 15 HC, 14 CD, and 10 UC subjects were used for the assay of biomarkers, because the saliva from the other subjects was insufficient for measurement of all the indicated biomarkers.2.5. Statistical analysisAll statistical analyses were conducted with R version 2.15.2. Microbial richness, evenness, and diversity were assessed using the R Vegan package. Depending on the normality of the data, the Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney's U-test was used to perform statistical analysis. P-values were corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini–Hochberg method. Correlations between relative abundance of genera and immunological markers in saliva were calculated by Pearson correlation coefficients.3. Results3.1. Collection of 16S dataWe surveyed the salivary microbiota of 21 CD patients, 14 UC patients, and 24 HCs, all of whom (including their relatives) are residents, lasting at least three generations, of the Okinawa area in Japan. The general and clinical parameters of the study populations are given in Supplementary Table S1, and individual details are shown in Supplementary Table S2. Sample-assigned pyrosequencing reads having both forward and reverse primer sequences accounted for ~60% of the total number of reads. The 16S reads having average quality values <25 and possibly chimeric sequences represented 0.75 and 0.46% of the selected dataset, respectively. Finally, 506 133 high-quality 16S reads were obtained from 59 salivary samples. Sorting of the 16S reads by average quality value prior to clustering enabled selection of the representative sequence with the highest quality value among the 16S reads grouped in each OTU. On the other hand, the primer check step for removing reads lacking both primer sequences10 had the possibility to incorrectly remove reads containing V1–V2 regions longer than the maximum length of 431 bp in the filter-passed reads. This is because there are a few species with a V1–V2 region >431 bp (e.g. Campylobacter rectus has a length of 493 bp). Our primer check step did not significantly affect the present results because only one of the 177 000 raw reads examined hit to Campylobacter. However, to avoid the incorrect filtration of reads, we modified the primer check step so as not to remove reads having a length of >400 bp, even though they may not have both primer sequences.3.2. Overall composition of the salivary bacterial communitiesWe evaluated the ecological features of the salivary bacterial communities of the CD, UC, and HC groups by a variety of indices at the OTU level.37,38 The results are summarized in Table 1. Species richness is the observed number of bacterial species assigned by OTUs detected in the samples. Richness estimates were obtained from the observed number of species by the extrapolation method using estimators such as the Chao1 and ACE indices. Evenness is the degree of homogeneity of abundance of the species detected in the samples. Diversity estimates were obtained from species richness and evenness by using several different indices, which exhibit different sensitivities to given factors, to confirm our results. The results suggested that there were no significant differences in the overall configuration of the salivary microbiota among the three groups (Table 1). OTU-based microbial richness and diversity across the HC, CD and UC groupsOTU-based microbial richness and diversity across the HC, CD and UC groupsWe then compared the overall bacterial community composition using the UniFrac distance metric, a phylogenetic tree-based metric ranging from 0 (distance between identical communities) to 1 (distance between totally different communities). A principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) plot based on the weighted UniFrac metric revealed clear clustering of most IBD samples apart from the HC samples, indicating the difference in microbial communities between the two groups (Fig. 1A). A bar chart more clearly shows the significant difference in microbiota composition between the IBD and HC groups (Fig. 1B). Comparison of the salivary microbiota of HCs with that of the CD and UC groups indicated that the microbiota of HCs significantly differs from both of them, and no significant difference was found between the UC and CD groups (Fig. 1C). Similar results were obtained using the unweighted UniFrac metric with lower statistical significance than that of the weighted UniFrac metric (Supplementary Fig. S1). These data suggest that species abundance, rather than species diversity, largely contributes to the observed differences in salivary microbiota between the HC and IBD groups.

Moreover, there was no significant difference between the two IBD subgroups. These data suggest that age might not affect the observed dysbiosis of the salivary microbiota of the IBD patients.3.3. Differences in salivary microbiota composition between the HC, CD, and UC groupsThe final dataset of the examined CD, UC, and HC groups (n = 59) consisted of 177 000 reads and included representatives of 12 bacterial phyla (Fig. 2; Supplementary Fig. S3 and Table S3). The majority of the 16S reads were classified into only five phyla: Firmicutes (46.5%), Bacteroidetes (22.3%), Actinobacteria (13.7%), Proteobacteria (12.5%), and Fusobacteria (4.2%). TM7, SR1, Spirochaetes, Synergistetes, Tenericutes, and Cyanobacteria were also detected and collectively represented <1% of the total reads analyzed. Analysis at the phylum level showed that the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes was significantly higher in both the CD and UC groups as compared with HCs (P < 0.01), while that of Proteobacteria was significantly lower in both the CD and UC groups as compared with HCs (P < 0.01). No significant difference at the phylum level was observed between the UC and CD groups, which was consistent with the results of the UniFrac distance analysis.

Dagger indicates anti-TNF-a antibody treated CD.In total, 107 bacterial genera were identified (at 95% identity), accounting for 97.8% of the total dataset. The remaining unclassified sequences (2.2%) were assigned to higher level taxa. Fourteen genera, including Streptococcus, Prevotella, Rothia, Neisseria, Granulicatella, Actinomyces, Haemophilus, Veillonella, Gemella, Leptotrichia, Fusobacterium, Porphyromonas, Uncultured Lachnospiraceae, and Oribacterium, predominated accounting for 92.7% of the total dataset. Other genera represented <0.5% each (Fig. 3; Supplementary Table S3). Two genera, Prevotella (phy. Bact.) and Veillonella (phy. Firm.), were significantly higher in both the CD and UC groups compared with HCs (P < 0.01). Two genera, Streptococcus (phy. Firm.) and Haemophilus (phy. Prot.), were significantly lower in both the CD and UC groups as compared with HCs (P < 0.05 and 0.01, respectively). Two other genera, Neisseria (phy. Prot.) and Gemella (phy. Firm.), were also found to be significantly lower only in the CD group as compared with HCs (P < 0.01 and 0.001, respectively). These results indicate that the relative increase of Bacteroidetes in IBD patients was mainly due to the increase of Prevotella, and the relative decrease of Proteobacteria in IBD patients was mainly due to the decrease of Neisseria and Haemophilus. No significant difference in the relative abundance of either Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria was observed among the three groups (Supplementary Table S3).

The remaining OTUs were present at relative abundance levels <0.5% of the total dataset (Supplementary Table S4). The relative abundance of several OTUs belonging to the genera Streptococcus, Prevotella, Veillonella, Nesisseria, Haemophilus, and Gemella showed significant differences in IBD patients as compared with HCs. These results were concordant with those detected at the genus level. Among the abundant OTUs, those most closely assigned to Prevotella melaninogenica, Veillonella sp. oral taxon 158, Streptococcus mitis, Gemella sanguinis, Neisseria mucosa, and Haemophilus parainfluenzae showed significant differences in relative abundance between the HC and IBD groups (Supplementary Table S4).3.4. Salivary immunological biomarkers in the HC, CD, and UC groupsWe evaluated the inflammatory state, considering its influence on shaping the salivary microbiota, in saliva of the CD and UC patients as compared with that of HCs. The analysis was performed by measuring secretory IgA, cytokines, and enzymes including lysozyme in unstimulated saliva of 15 HC, 14 CD, and 10 UC individuals (Supplementary Table S5 and Fig. S4). There was no significant difference in the total protein concentration in saliva of the CD and UC patients as compared with that of HCs (P = 0.112 and 0.192, respectively). The lysozyme level was significantly lower in saliva of both the CD and UC groups as compared with HCs (P < 0.01). On the other hand, the levels of IgA and LL37 in both CD and UC groups were higher than that of HCs with statistical significance. The use of Luminex technology was highly sensitive in measuring cytokines from small volumes of saliva samples. In saliva of the CD and UC groups, the level of IL-1ß was significantly higher as compared with HCs (P < 0.05 and <0.01, respectively). The levels of IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1 were significantly higher only in saliva of the UC group, while elevated TNF-a level was found only in the CD group with statistical significance. The levels of IgA and MCP-1 in the UC group were significantly higher than those in the CD group. These data indicate that the oral cavity of IBD patients is usually in the inflammatory state, and the levels tend to be slightly higher in the UC group than the CD group.3.5. Composition of the salivary microbiota in relation to immunological biomarkersWe searched for correlations between the relative abundance of dominant bacterial genera and the measured biomarkers in the saliva of 39 subjects (Supplementary Table S5). The results are shown in Fig. 4. The relative abundance of Streptococcus negatively correlates with IL-1ß and IL-8 (r = -0.54 and -0.51, respectively, P < 0.001), while it positively correlates with lysozyme (r = 0.63, P < 0.001). On the other hand, the abundance of Prevotella positively correlates with IL-1ß (r = 0.58, P < 0.001) but negatively correlates with lysozyme (r = -0.54, P < 0.01). The relative abundance of Veillonella negatively correlates with lysozyme (r = -0.54, P < 0.001), while Haemophilus positively correlates with lysozyme (r = 0.58, P < 0.001). Linear regressions also validated correlations between the relative abundance of Streptococcus and Prevotella and the levels of lysozyme and IL-1ß, and between the relative abundance of Veillonella and Haemophilus and the level of lysozyme (Supplementary Fig. S5). On the whole, Prevotella, Actinomyces, Veillonella, and Lachnospiracea tended to positively correlate, while Streptococcus, Rothia, Neisseria, Haemophilus, and Gemella tended to negatively correlate with elevated cytokines in saliva of IBD patients.

Validation of 16S pyrosequencing data by targeted quantitative PCRWe designed specific PCR primers for quantitative PCR (qPCR) targeting genomes of P. melaninogenica and H. parainfluenzae, which showed significant differences between HCs and IBD patients by 16S pyrosequencing analysis (Supplementary Table S4). Using these primers, we found strong correlations between 16S-based and qPCR data for the quantification of P. melaninogenica (r = 0.87, P < 0.001) and H. parainfluenzae (r = 0.86, P < 0.001), indicating the quantitative accuracy of our 16S pyrosequencing-based results (Fig. 5).

Bacterial 16S rRNA-based pyrosequencing analysisIn this study, we used targeted amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene hypervariable V1–V2 region to evaluate bacterial composition at finer taxonomic levels. The use of primer 27Fmod enabled us to reduce underestimation of the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium species that predominate human microbiota, and thus the quantitative accuracy of the overall bacterial composition was greatly improved.10,39 One limitation of clustering the 16S reads using the UCLUST program is selection of the representative sequence for each OTU. The quality of the representative sequence is not always the highest in the OTU, which affects the BLAST identity, E-value and score, sometimes providing inappropriate results for taxonomic assignment of the OTUs. We overcame this limitation by sorting the 16S reads by their average quality values prior to clustering, leading to 16S reads with the highest quality being selected as the representative sequence for each OTU. Our 16S-based results were also validated by strongly correlating with the qPCR data targeting bacterial species showing significant changes between HC and IBD samples (Fig. 5). In addition, clustering of the reads was performed with a 96% pairwise-identity cutoff to reduce overestimation of the number of bacterial species (or OTUs) largely due to 454 pyrosequencing errors.10,40 Clustering with a 96% pairwise-identity cutoff should be applied for pyrosequencing reads obtained from other types of human microbiota.4.2. Salivary microbiota composition in IBD patientsThe abundant bacterial groups in the salivary microbiota detected in this study were similar to those previously reported,41–44 but the compositions differed from those observed in plaque microbiota.44 Our data clearly showed a significant difference in salivary microbiota composition between HCs and IBD patients. Shifts in oral microbiota composition were also observed in several oral manifestations such as dental caries,45 periodontitis,46 and oral squamous cell carcinoma.47 Moreover, various components of the oral microbiota have been implicated in systemic diseases such as pancreatic disease including pancreatic cancer,48 atherosclerosis,49 bacteremia,50 and endocarditis.51Altered bacterial community structure in the gut microbiota of IBD patients is a common finding in comparison with that of healthy subjects. Previous studies showed overall structural changes as well as reduced species richness of the gut microbiota in IBD patients.29–33 It is likely that the high microbial richness and diversity characterizing healthy microbiota may have a protective effect on humans. Unlike the gut microbiota of IBD patients, our estimates using several metrics revealed that microbial richness and diversity in the salivary microbiota of IBD patients was similar to that of HCs, despite significant changes in community structure (Fig. 1). These data suggest that the extent of the changes in the salivary microbiota is less than that in the gut microbiota of IBD patients.Our data indicated a significant increase of the genus Prevotella in the salivary microbiota of IBD patients, in which its relative abundance was almost equivalent to that of reduced Streptococcus, which is most abundant in healthy salivary microbiota (Fig. 3). Prevotella is a Gram-negative, obligate anaerobe, and a member of the prevalent genera in the human microbiome.52 Some Prevotella species were similarly increased, distinguishable from opportunistic infections, in bacterial vaginosis,53 esophagitis,54 antral gastritis,55 and saliva of caries-active subjects.45 These data suggest that the increase of Prevotella, with concurrently decreased Streptococcus, is clearly related with abnormal physiologies in IBD patients. The relative abundance of total Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria showed no significant difference between HCs and IBD patients (Supplementary Table S3). From these results, Gram-stain properties of bacterial surface structures may not be related with dysbiosis of IBD salivary microbiota, unlike the association of Gram-negative oral bacteria with dysbiosis observed in subgingival microbiota in periodontitis.564.3. Salivary microbiota associated with immunological biomarkersSaliva contains a variety of components such as cytokines, immunoglobulins, and antimicrobial proteins involved in host defence mechanisms for maintaining oral and systemic health.57 Alteration of the salivary microbiota in IBD patients suggests the occurrence of inflammatory immune responses in the oral cavity of IBD patients as intestinal inflammation associated with aberrant gut microbiota of IBD.23–26 Our data showed that the levels of many salivary cytokines and IgA were significantly higher in both CD and UC patients than those observed in HCs, indicating that inflammatory responses are elicited in the oral cavity of the patients. Similarly, elevated salivary IL-1ß, IL-6, and TNF-a levels in CD patients and an elevated IL-8 level in the saliva of patients with bowel disease were also reported.58,59 Unexpectedly, the elevated level of inflammatory biomarkers in UC patients was similar to or slightly higher than that observed in CD patients, regardless of differences in disease states between IBD patients (Supplementary Fig. S4 and Table S5). Salivary IgA induction was observed in CD patients with oral symptoms but not in those without oral symptoms.60 The elevated level of IgA in most IBD patients’ saliva examined suggests that those patients may have oral manifestations, however, we did not have access to their oral health clinical records.Salivary lysozyme levels were significantly reduced in both CD and UC patients as compared with that of HCs. Lysozyme is an antimicrobial protein, expressed by various cells including neutrophils, macrophages, and epithelial cells. It is abundant in saliva and plays an important role in the host constitutive defence system.61 It has been reported that salivary lysozyme was significantly lower in patients with gingivitis and periodontitis as compared with healthy subjects.62 In contrast, faecal lysozyme levels were significantly elevated in IBD patients.63 Further analysis will be required to elucidate the difference in lysozyme levels between saliva and the intestine.Lysozyme exclusively catalyses hydrolysis of Gram-positive bacterial cell wall. However, lysozyme can also be bactericidal for Gram-negative bacteria in vivo through synergistic action with salivary lactoferrin in the normal state.64 Therefore, this in vitro specificity of lysozyme activity may not be largely involved in the dysbiosis of salivary microbiota in IBD patients, in which the abundance of Gram-positive bacteria was not significantly different as compared with HCs (Supplementary Table S3).There were several subgroups of patients dependent on different medical treatments, and patients with different states of disease (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). In addition, Infliximab (anti-TNF-a antibody) therapy is commonly used for IBD patients, but up to one-third of the patients have been shown not to respond.65 Therefore, it was very difficult to precisely evaluate the differences in microbiota structure and biomarker levels between the subgroups. Nevertheless, phylogenetic analysis based on the weighted UniFrac distance metric did not show discrete clustering of particular subgroups, such as CD patients with or without Infliximab treatment and active CD, or CD in remission, suggesting limited contributions from the patients' disease state or medical treatment to the overall microbiota structure (Fig. 2).Strong correlations between some inflammatory biomarkers and salivary microbiota compositions were revealed (Fig. 4). The lower lysozyme and elevated IL-1ß, IL-8, IgA and several other biomarkers were likely to be synergistically or interactively associated with the abundance of the four dominant genera, Streptococcus, Prevotella, Veillonella, and Haemophilus. Interactions between these microbes and other species may also be involved in the dysbiosis of salivary microbiota of IBD patients.Finally, it is still unknown whether the inflammatory state in the oral cavity of IBD patients is the cause or a consequence of imbalances in the salivary microbiota, and which local (the oral cavity) or systemic (the gut) immune response is more responsible for the observed dysbiosis of salivary microbiota. Our results strongly suggest the existence of certain defined mechanisms by which aberrant, but similar, salivary microbiota among IBD patients is formed. The human gut microbiota is gradually shaped to its matured assemblage in a few years after birth, with temporal changes in the diversity and rank of dominant species largely dependent on diet and host physiological state.66 Salivary microbiota may also be established similar to gut microbiota. Since >1000 ml of saliva is produced per day in the average adult and it always flows into the gastrointestinal tract, bacteria in saliva also have many opportunities to reach the intestine. Therefore, it can be postulated that salivary microbiota affects the development of gut microbiota to some extent. To evaluate this hypothesis, it is necessary to investigate the progression of infant salivary microbiota and the oral inflammatory state. Additionally, further studies such as comparison of the salivary microbiota between IBD and other diseases will provide informative sources for discovering non-invasive salivary biomarkers specific to IBD.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported in part by the global COE project of ‘Genome Information Big Bang’ from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT) of Japan to M.H. and K.O., a research project grant from Azabu University to H.M., a grant from the Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST) program of the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) to K.O., and Scientific Research B (No. 22370087) to H.I. and (Nos. 21370108 and 24370099) to H.O. from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS).

IntroductionVia alternative splicing (AS) different mRNA isoforms are produced from one single gene. This diversification is one explanation for the discrepancy between the relatively low gene numbers of higher eukaryotes on the one hand and their cellular complexity on the other hand. AS affects binding properties, intracellular localization, enzymatic activity and many more properties of proteins.1 Examples of regulated pathways are sex determination in Drosophila melanogaster,2 neuronal differentiation in rat3 and auto-regulation of LAMMER kinases, which take part in splicing factor activation.4 Not only the mere presence of an isoform, but also the exact splice isoform ratio can influence the phenotype of cells and can be regulated in a tissue-dependent manner.5Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) have widely been used to detect AS and quantify the transcript diversity arising from AS. For example, AS estimates for animals range from 53% of the multi-exon genes in human, 53% in mouse, 24% in rat, 22% in chicken, 19% in fruit fly to 6% in roundworm.6 Interestingly, despite their relatedness, the estimates for mouse and rat differ remarkably. A possible reason for this are too few transcript data that limit the detection of AS events. Therefore, an approach was suggested that corrects for the amounts of transcripts and yields similar AS rates of ~31% for mouse and rat.7 Finally, from deep transcriptome sequencing an AS rate of >90% was estimated for humans.8 These findings support the view that sensitive methods will ultimately detect splicing variants for every multi-exon gene.9The basic AS types are the following: in exon skipping (SE, cassette exon), the exon can be spliced out of the transcript together with its flanking introns.10 Alternative 5' splice site (A5'SS, alternative donor) selection11 and alternative 3' splice site (A3'SS, alternative acceptor) selection12 result in longer exons and corresponding isoforms.13 Intron retention describes a mechanism where an intron can remain in the mature mRNA.14 Previous studies showed that eukaryote species do not have equal distributions of these AS types. Cassette exons predominantly occur in animals, whereas intron retention is more frequent in other taxa.15Fungi, especially Saccharomyces cerevisiae, have been used extensively as a reduced and easily manageable model system in biological research. There are many fungi that cause human and plant diseases (Supplementary Table S1), which provoke worldwide costs of several billion dollars a year. Other fungi are used for industrial fermentation and production of food and feed additives or are crucial in the degradation of xenobiotics and in the conversion of cellulose into biofuels (Supplementary Table S1). Fungi have compact genomes (the majority 10–90 Mbp) and genes with small introns. They also show extended consensus sequences for the 5'SS and the branchpoint region.16 These features facilitate a structural interpretation of intron sequences, and they suggest low-complex AS patterns, both of which make fungi attractive models for mechanistic studies of (alternative) splicing.A few studies estimated fungal AS rates on a genome-wide scale in comparative manner. Varying but relatively low AS frequencies were discovered in fungi and microsporidia (0–5% of genes in S. cerevisiae, Schizosaccharo-myces pombe, Encephalitozoon cuniculi and Cryptococcus neoformans).17 A correspondence between intron numbers per gene and AS numbers was found for the studied species. Also, AS seems to affect genes of different functions. Genes associated with regulation have higher AS levels. Evolutionarily old genes were found to be affected more often.17 In another comparative study of 14 fungi among other eukaryotes, also varying amounts of AS were observed. Yeasts showed nearly no events, and around 1000 AS instances were found for C. neoformans and Coccidioides posadasii, each.15 Studies of single fungal species show results from only a few AS events in Magnaporthe grisea18 to rates of 8.6% in Aspergillus oryzae19 and 4.2% in C. neoformans.20 Remarkably, Ho et al.21 estimate an AS rate for Ustilago maydis of 26% in a subset of multi-exon genes that have support by at least two ESTs.So far, AS research was mainly focused on animals and plants. With this study, we give a comprehensive report on fungi as the third eukaryote crown group. The comparability of the previous results on fungal AS is hampered due to the application of different biochemical and computational strategies. Thus, we undertook a systematic genome-wide comparative analysis of AS in 23 informative fungal species. The basis of our analysis are alignments of transcript sequences to genome sequences, and an AS rate estimation similar to that of Kim et al.72. Materials and methods2.1. Data sources and preparationWe downloaded chromosomal sequences, reference transcripts and gene annotations of 25 species (26 different strains) from NCBI's GenBank, RefSeq and EntrezGene databases, respectively.22 These data were complemented with most up-to-date sequences and annotations of Pichia stipitis (Joint Genome Institute23) and S. cerevisiae (Saccharomyces genome database24). Genome sequences and annotations of further three species (five strains) were from the Broad Institute (Fusarium oxysporum, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis Pb01, Pb03 and Pb18, Rhizopus oryzae25) and for further three species from the Joint Genome Institute (Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Trichoderma reesei, Mycosphaerella graminicola23). ESTs for all species were downloaded from NCBI's dbEST database, except for Arthroderma benhamiae, where Roche 454 data are from NCBI's SRA.22 Four species were excluded from the analysis because there were <200 ESTs. This yielded 27 species (30 strains) with sufficient data (Table 1). We masked low-complexity repeats from the genome sequences using the program RepeatMasker (Smit et al., unpublished). We removed sequence contamination, low-quality and low-complexity sequences from the ESTs using SeqClean (unpublished, ‘The Gene Index Project’ of Harvard University). Roche 454 reads were additionally cleaned for adapter stretches using in-house software. Annotation, EST mapping and AS data of the studied speciesNote, for P. brasiliensis and C. neoformans the same EST data were used for all strains, and hence, the same EST statistics come about.

Transcriptome-genome alignments and splice site conservationSpliced transcript-genome alignments were built in two steps: ESTs were mapped with Blat26 to obtain first rough guide alignments. The best Blat hits were further splice aligned with exalin.27 To use SS information as additional input for exalin, we prepared a scoring matrix based on SS consensi from Neurospora crassa as suggested by Zhang et al. Since SSs are conserved among fungi, this model was used for the analysis of all species. Alignments were filtered for minimal score (20 bits), mismatches (=10%, no mismatches in 5 nt region of SSs) and minimum length of exons and introns (6 and 40 nt, respectively). Only alignments with SSs from canonical (GT|AG) or well-accepted non-canonical (GC|AG, AT|AC) classes16 were considered for further analysis.SS sequence conservation was calculated as information content per position.28 To this end, we extracted the sequence from -4 to +7 nt from the exon–intron boundary, and the region from -4 to +4 nt from the intron–exon boundary. We used the upstream boundary of alternative 3' SSs and the downstream boundary of alternative 5' SSs.2.3. Detection of ASCustom Perl scripts were used to analyse filtered transcript-genome alignments for four AS events: exon skipping (cassette exon), alternative 5'SS and alternative 3'SS selection and intron retention. Using splice positions (genomic starts and ends of exons and introns) we compared the positions between all exons and introns to find overlaps and identify the basic AS types. AS events were predicted based on EST discrepancies only, not on discrepancies between ESTs and annotations. To account for the limited sequence data used in our analysis, one EST was considered sufficient to support an mRNA isoform. Constitutively spliced exons and introns were defined as not having support of AS at a minimum coverage of 10 ESTs.2.4. Random sampling of transcripts and per-gene AS ratesRandom sampling was done for each genomic location with n = 2 aligned transcripts. We randomly drew a defined number of transcripts and estimated the AS rate. To do so, AS events were assigned to genes based on mapping coordinates, and the number of AS affected genes was divided by the overall number of genes detected by random sampling. Then, we multiplied the AS rates with the number of genes having introns (potential AS candidates) divided by the number of all genes. This yielded whole genome AS rate estimations. This procedure was repeated 20 times to calculate a mean AS rate estimation. The procedure was done with different sampling depths, drawing 2–10 ESTs per locus. Due to a low EST coverage, loci with a higher coverage than 10 ESTs are rare for most analysed species. Thus, to avoid a bias towards highly expressed genes, results from lower sampling depths were kept in sampling repeats with higher sampling depths. That is, sampling depth i means to draw at most i ESTs from a locus. Pearson's product moment and its corresponding significance test was used to assess the correlation between AS rates and number of mapped ESTs (based on Student's t-test, assuming normal distribution of the data, R version 2.12.129). Four species were excluded from correlation analysis because <5% of their annotated genes were covered by the sampled ESTs (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S2): Aspergillus oryzae, Chaeto-mium globosum, Fusarium oxysporum, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum.2.5. Functional gene annotations and enrichment statisticsGenes were searched for protein domain motifs using HMMER330 (e-value < 0.01) together with the Pfam database (release 24). Alternatively, Pfam domain annotations were downloaded from the Broad Institute (Fusarium sp., Paracoccidioides sp., R. oryzae). Associations between Pfam domains and AS were tested using the following model: per species, all genes that have at least two EST hits are taken into consideration with their Pfam assignment and number of introns. Thereof, all introns are assumed to have an equal, species-specific probability p to be alternatively spliced, as averaged from the empirical data. The probability P(g<U+2208>AS) that a gene with n introns is alternatively spliced is calculated as P(g<U+2208> AS) = 1 - (1 - p)n.Then, the expected number of alternatively spliced genes coding a certain Pfam is calculated by cumulation: Exp(nAS,Pfam) = SP(gi <U+2208> AS).The distribution of nAS,Pfam was obtained from Monte Carlo simulation of the cumulation terms (n = 106). Binomial rather than hypergeometric simulation of P(gi <U+2208> AS) simplified the calculations and yielded a slightly wider distribution, resulting in conservative estimates of the distribution quantiles. Correction for multiple testing was done using the Bonferroni method.3. Results3.1. Mining of introns and splicing signalsThe number of available ESTs per species varies in a wide range (1557–1 040 774). To detect AS, at least two transcripts per locus are needed, i.e. one for each of at least two splicing isoforms. We find that, depending on the species, 0–100% of the annotated introns are overlapped by at least two ESTs (25% on average over all fungi; Supplementary Table S2), and 1–86% of genes are overlapped by at least two ESTs (28% on average; Table 1 and Supplementary Table S2). Per species, 98–100% of the detected introns per species harbour typical SSs (GT|AG), whereas non-canonical SSs (GC|AG, AT|AC) are rare (0–2%), in accordance with a previous study on fungi.16 The sets of reliable genomic intron and exon coordinates were subsequently examined for AS events.3.2. Whole genome AS ratesThe numbers of detected AS events strongly depend on the numbers of available ESTs (Supplementary Fig. S1a; Pearson correlation coefficient r = 0.82, P-value 1.8 × 10-6). A very high coverage of introns with ESTs, especially when using next generation transcriptome sequencing, can reveal even very rare events that may partly represent splicing noise of the cell. This can lead to overestimation of AS propensity of a species. On the other hand, an uneven genomic distribution of transcripts leads to an under-sampling of the genome-wide splice isoforms. To circumvent these pitfalls, we applied a random sampling strategy, similar to the one of Kim et al.7 to obtain AS rate estimations that are independent of EST amounts and distributions. We left out species where <5% of multi-exon genes were covered by the sampled ESTs for estimation of whole genome AS rates (last column Supplementary Table S2). For them we do not expect the estimations to be reliable enough. We mapped the AS events that were recovered by random sampling to genomic locations of annotated genes to calculate AS rates per gene. We found that the correlation between these AS rates and the EST numbers is clearly reduced (r = 0.16, P-value = 0.46, Supplementary Fig. S1b). Thus, random sampling gives AS rate estimates that are comparable between species.The more ESTs were sampled from a genomic location (sampling depth) the higher is the chance of finding AS events (Supplementary Fig. S2). We decided to sample up to 10 ESTs per locus to reduce the chance of sampling rare events and, thus, overestimation of AS capacities. The reduced gains of AS rates with higher sampling depth support this decision (decreasing slopes of curves in Supplementary Fig. S2). Thus, the following results refer to a sampling depth of 10 ESTs, if not stated differently.6.4% of fungal genes are affected by AS when averaging on species level (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S2). Excluding ascomycetous yeasts (P. stipitis, S. cerevisiae and S. pombe 0.26% AS affected genes), the rate is 7.3%. Coccidioides immitis and C. neoformans show outstanding AS rates of 13 and 18/20%, respectively (strains JEC21 and B-3501A). The relative proportions of the AS types averaged over all species, in the order of frequency are: intron retention 61%, alternative 3' SSs 23%, alternative 5' SSs 13% and skipped exons 3% (Fig. 1a). We only took into account strains B-3501A and Pb01 from C. neoformans and P. brasiliensis, respectively, for mean value calculation.

Validation of retained intronsAn alternative explanation for detected retained introns (RIs) would be the presence of unprocessed pre-mRNA in the sequenced samples or a contamination with DNA. First of all, the EST libraries used for this study were all prepared from total RNA and enriched for poly(A)-mRNA. This makes DNA contamination very unlikely. To further validate the detected RIs, we assessed the number of RI-supporting ESTs that have been already processed in the following way. For each species, we counted the number of RIs where at least one EST of the isoform that harbours the RI supports a spliced intron at another EST position. For all species with RIs, between 74 and 100% (average 96%) of those isoforms contain a processed intron (details see Supplementary Table S3). This clearly indicates that most RIs are authentic RNA events.3.4. Correlations of AS rates and genomic featuresWe calculated the correlations between genome and splicing quantities. We find a strong correlation (r = 0.73, P-value 8.8 × 10-5) between the number of EST-covered introns and the number of RIs across the species. This hints at fungal introns to have a certain chance per se to be retained in an alternative manner. In contrast, there is only a slight and barely significant correlation of the extrapolated genome-wide AS numbers with gene numbers (r = 0.41, P = 0.0502) and with genome size in nucleotides (r = 0.53, P = 0.009). Further, there is no correlation of the AS rate per gene with gene numbers (r = -0.05, P = 0.82) nor with genome size (r = 0.12, P = 0.57). Nonetheless, the small genome sizes (in base pairs and gene numbers) of the yeasts S. cerevisiae, S. pombe and P. stipitis coincide with their clearly reduced AS propensity.3.5. Intron retention is the major AS type in fungiIntron retention makes up two-thirds of the AS events in the investigated fungi. This also holds for each fungal group separately. We investigated the properties of affected introns and their aberration from constitutively spliced ones. We find that RIs are shorter (89 nt) than constitutively spliced introns (93 nt), on average across all species, though not significant (Mann–Whitney U-test, P = 0.211, n = 5665/23 268). Neither constitutively spliced nor RIs tend to preserve the reading frame. That is, in both sets, intron lengths are distributed evenly over the three possible remainders of division by three. Constitutively spliced introns: remainder zero, 32%; remainder one, 34%; remainder two, 34%; RIs: 33, 34 and 33%, respectively.3.6. Varying alternative splice propensity is taxon-dependentWe summarized and averaged the resampled AS rates into two different fungal taxa (see a species tree in Fig. 2). On average in Basidiomycota more genes are affected by AS (8.6%) than in Ascomycota (7.2% w/o ascomycetous yeasts, Mann–Whitney U-test, not significant, n = 5/14). Without the species showing outlying AS rates (C. immitis, P. brasiliensis, C. neoformans), the rates for Basidiomycota (6.1%) and Ascomycota (4.9%) are still different. Basidio-mycota and Ascomycota have very similar AS type proportions, with Basidiomycota showing slightly more RIs and less alternative 5' SSs (Fig. 1). In both cases RIs make up around two-thirds of all AS events while skipped exons are only marginally present. The ascomycetous yeasts of our study (P. stipitis, S. cerevisiae and S. pombe) show an AS rate of 0.26% on average, which is significantly lower than the rate of the other Ascomycota (Mann–Whitney U-test, P-value 0.003, n = 3/14). An explanation for this difference may be deviations in structural gene properties that influence splicing. We find that Basidiomycota have on average shorter constitutively spliced introns (86 nt) than Ascomycota (96 nt, Mann–Whitney U-test, P < 2.2 × 10-16, n = 5205/17 936), and also shorter RIs (72 nt vs. 95 nt, P < 2.2 × 10-16, n = 1545/4093). Considering the ascomycetous yeasts separately, they show on average 326-nt long constitutively spliced introns and 132-nt long RIs, though it should be noted that yeast RI data are only based on five introns. In contrast, the one Mucoromycotina (formerly Zygomycota) R. oryzae has very short constitutively spliced introns (61 nt) and RIs (54 nt). Species tree.

Species' lifestyles are colour coded: human pathogens, black; plant pathogens, dark gray; non-pathogenic fungi, light gray. Yeasts are underlined.To further support the idea of the influence of gene properties on taxon-dependent AS frequencies, we compared the average conservation of SS motifs (Supplementary Fig. S3a and b). Sequence conservation in terms of information content can be considered as a proxy for SS fidelity. We find that ascomycetous retained as well as constitutively spliced introns show higher SS conservation than the corresponding basidiomycetous ones (not significant, Mann–Whitney U-test, all P > 0.08). The one Mucoromycotina, R. oryzae, has higher SS conservation in both types of introns than the Basidiomycota, yet cannot clearly be distinguished from Ascomycota in this respect. Yeasts show the highest SS conservation. However, the number of sampled yeasts and Basidiomycota are very small so that only 5'SSs of yeast RIs are significantly more highly conserved than 5'SSs of basidiomycetous RIs (P = 0.036, n = 2 yeasts (yeast P. stipitis contributes no RIs), 5 Basidiomycota).3.7. Functional characterization of ASTo study the function of fungal AS we analysed annotated and predicted Pfam domains for all genes and their relations to the AS rate of the gene families. We pooled all data and asked if particular Pfam domains are associated with higher AS rates. In a neutral model, AS is homogeneously distributed over all introns. Based on this model, we calculated the expected fraction of AS-associated genes per Pfam domain and compared it with the observed AS fraction. Together, six significantly AS-enriched Pfam gene families were identified (Supplementary Table S4). Two are ribosomal genes (PF01479, PF01599) and two are genes involved in thiamine biosynthesis (PF09084, PF01946). We note that these gene families show particularly high expression rates (on average, EST coverage is 34, compared with 0.6 for a non-AS-enriched control group). Since ESTs are the primary evidence for AS, and the detection rate of AS increases with EST coverage, it is well possible that the high expression rates alone account for the Pfam-AS association in these gene groups.Apart from these, the other two significantly AS-enriched Pfam gene families are fungi specific (PF08520, PF12586) with unknown domain function. Remarkably, domain PF12586 occurs only in Cryptococcus. The next Pfam gene family with a known function, though below global significance (P = 0.35 with Bonferroni correction), is PF03073 and comprises integral membrane proteins that act as negative regulators of gene expression in response to oxygen or light (Supplementary Table S5).3.8. AS is associated with dimorphic switch and pathogenicityComparing AS rates of pathogenic and non-pathogenic fungi, we found interesting aspects: the rate in pathogenic species is higher (7.6%) than in non-pathogenic species (5.1%). Considering only human pathogens, the rate of 10.7% is even more striking, yet the differences are not significant (Mann–Whitney U-test, all P-values >0.09, n = 11 non-pathogenic, 6 human pathogenic).The Pfam domain descriptions of the AS affected genes pointed to an involvement in stress response to an altering environment as it occurs during host infection: heat shock proteins, chaperone/chaperonin. These proteins mediate stress response, for example thermo-tolerance in mammalian hosts.32 Furthermore, AS-affected genes are often related to availability of copper, which is typical when penetrating human host tissue: multi-copper oxidase and CTR copper transporter family. Glucuronoxylomannan, the predominant capsular polysaccharide in C. neoformans, experiences a structural change during dimorphic switching. Thus, the capsule surface changes, which results in a reduced recognition by the host's immune system.33 We identified homologues of the proteins involved in the production and modification of glucuronoxylomannan for all investigated fungi via sequence similarity using BLASTP. Four of these proteins do show AS association, namely RIs, two in C. neoformans JEC21 and two in C. neoformans B-3501A. Three are hypothetical proteins harbouring a glycosyltransferase GTB or CAP59 mtransfer region. Two are annotated as mannosyltransferase 1 (Supple-mentary Table S6). However, the predicted homologues are not significantly enriched in AS association (hypergeometric test, P > 0.1).Another virulence factor is the adaptation of a fungus to the altered environment of the host tissue. Up-regulation of oxidative and heat shock stress associated genes as tps1, hsp30 and ddr48 in P. brasiliensis P01 likely convey to cope with this micro-niche climate.34 The identified homologues of these 3 genes are frequently affected by AS in pathogenic fungi (15 cases) and 5 times in non-pathogenic fungi (Supplementary Table S7). Among the Tps1 homologues are genes from C. neoformans B-3501A and JEC21, one of P. anserina and one of T. reesei, an alpha,alpha-trehalose-phosphate synthase Tps1 subunit of L. bicolor and a hypothetical protein similar to alpha,alpha-trehalose-phosphate synthase subunit TPS3 of N. crassa. Some of the genes are affected by multiple AS events. The AS-associated Hsp30 homologues are three chaperones/small heat shock proteins from C. immitis, L. bicolor and U. maydis. Finally, Ddr48-homologues with AS association are hypothetical/predicted proteins of C. immitis, A. capsulatus, C. neoformans and M. graminicola, two of which have a predicted function: ‘similar to potential stress response protein’, and ‘Glycosyltrans-ferase GTB type’. These stress response-related proteins are significantly enriched in AS association (hypergeometric test, P = 0.00022).4. Discussion4.1. AS rate estimationWe here presented a comparative genome-wide survey of AS in the fungal kingdom. We based our survey mainly on Sanger-sequenced EST data (one species' ESTs are from 454 sequencing) and corresponding annotated genomes. In current AS studies, often next generation transcriptome sequence data with millions of short ESTs are used. However, though for some fungi, these data are available, the other prerequisite of having a well-annotated genome is rarely fulfilled. According to our results, next generation sequencing technologies with EST lengths of >200 nt (met by Roche 454 as well as Illumina/Solexa platforms) should be well feasible for the detection of the basic AS types in fungi. This is because the read length is clearly longer than the average fungal intron and exon lengths (constitutively spliced introns 93 nt and exons 132 nt).The alignment of transcript sequences to genomes is currently the most effective way to detect alterations of mature mRNA at a large scale. However, Fox-Walsh and Hertel9 argued that every multi-exon gene has a certain AS frequency, and the detection of an alternative isoform is a matter of sensitivity of the method applied. Thus, we here use a random sampling approach similar to the one by Kim et al.7 This universal normalization approach led to AS rate estimates that are independent of the number and distribution of the ESTs, and thus, are more comparable across species. We found AS events in every of the 27 studied fungi except one (P. stipitis), with an average rate of 6.4% of genes. Thus, we suppose that AS is a common phenomenon in the fungal kingdom. Coccidioides imitis and C. neoformans show outstanding AS rates of 13 and 18%, the latter being about three times more than anticipated in earlier studies.17,20 While successively increasing the sampling depth from 2–10, we found that the relative proportions of the AS rates between most species remain constant (Supplementary Fig. S2). This underpins the reliability of our normalization method. Because many loci have a lower EST coverage than the sampling depth of 10, our analysis yielded rather conservative estimates. It is likely that with deep transcriptome sequencing more fungal AS events will be found. Even when excluding very rare events, this may elevate the AS rates. This trend was seen for human and other mammals already,8 and can be supported by the finding that for A. benhamiae and N. crassa, both of which have high EST coverage, the AS rates clearly kept rising at higher sampling depths (Supplementary Fig. S2), opposed to most of the other species.Finally, in a recent study on fission yeasts, 433 AS events in overall 5144 genes were found in S. pombe.35 While considering scaling effects due to sequencing depth, our results agree well with these findings in that the AS rate is very low compared with that in non-yeast Ascomycota (see Supplementary Calculation S1). This validates the comparability of our normalized AS rate results.4.2. Fungal introns have an innate propensity to be retainedWe found that the trend of relative AS type distribution was the same in all the investigated fungal species. Intron retention made up the most prevalent of the investigated types (61% of the events). Contrarily, skipped exons were very rare (3%) and alternative 3' (23%) and 5' SSs (13%) comprised a third of the events. These results are in general agreement with previous findings on fungal AS15 and are similar to trends in plants.7,15 In contrast, skipped exons are more common than RIs in invertebrates and even more frequent in vertebrates.7The more introns a species genome harbours the more splicing needs to take place. The question is whether this also increases the chance to have alternatively spliced introns per se. Indeed, we found a strong correlation of genome-wide intron numbers and numbers of RIs. Thus, fungal introns seem to have an innate chance to be alternatively spliced. Similarly, Irimia et al.17 found a correspondence between AS and intron number per gene in 12 eukaryotes.We found that fungal RIs are shorter than constitutively spliced introns. Also, on the species level, there is a correspondence between intron lengths and their propensity to be alternatively spliced. Together, this hints at an involvement of the intron length in the recognition of introns. The intron definition mechanism is a model proposed to explain this same effect in plants. Splicing factors bind to the recognition sites on the RNA, and ‘bridge’ across the intron by mutual binding. Thus, failed recognition of one SS typically results in intron retention.15 This is in contrast to metazoan splicing, where splicing factors are assumed to form stable complexes across exons (exon definition mechanism) and where failed SS recognition typically results in exon skipping. It explains why metazoan introns tend to be much longer (e.g. 3413 nt in human36) but are rarely retained. Thus, we propose that the intron definition mechanism is prevalent in fungi similar to plants.Finally, there is a hypothesis that connects SS conservation with splicing propensity, saying that strict adherence to the SS motif promotes the splicing machinery to bind more reliably to the SS and thus decreases the chance of AS.37 McGuire et al.15 find weaker (i.e., less conserved) SSs at RIs compared with constitutively spliced introns in all their investigated species. Here, when comparing introns (both retained and normally spliced ones) between the taxa, we find that higher SS conservation correlates with lower AS rates, which supports the hypothesis.4.3. Fungal RIs are authentic and likely trigger nonsense-mediated mRNA decayThere is a debate if RIs are authentic AS events or represent incompletely spliced pre-mRNA. Contamination with genomic DNA is very unlikely since the construction of EST libraries relies on affinity-based poly(A)+ mRNA enrichment. From the analysis of fungal RIs, we found no tendency to preserve the reading frame, similar to results on non-fungal species in a previous study.15 This may support the hypothesis of spurious intron retention. However, we have several arguments against it. For the majority of EST libraries analysed here, cDNA was produced by poly(A)-tail capture, ensuring that ESTs derive from fully transcribed mRNAs. The current consensus is that intron splicing occurs predominantly cotranscriptionally,38 corroborated by findings that the nascent mRNA can recruit multiple spliceosomes simultaneously.39 Though the exact kinetics of RNA processing and export are unknwon, intron splicing is likely finished shortly after transcription. This supports the hypothesis that if a detected multi-intron mRNA was spliced at one intron, it has already been spliced at the other introns, too. In fact, averaged over all species, 96% of the transcript isoforms that support an RI contain a processed intron at another position, as was similarly reported for RIs in Arabidopsis thaliana.40 In these cases, the completed splicing of co-transcribed introns indicates that the molecules have passed spliceosomal processing and that RIs likely represent authentic events on mRNA. However, it is possible that RI-containing mRNAs had not left the nucleus, awaiting a later processing cycle or degradation. Nevertheless, even if this is true, these cases illustrate inherent differences in splicing efficiency.It was argued that despite a weak selection for coding potential, splice variants having RIs unlikely yield functional proteins.15 While we suppose that most RIs are authentic AS events, the isoforms with a frame-shifting RI unlikely yield productive, protein-coding mRNAs. However, we hypothesize that fungal RIs may in part be a means for post-transcriptional regulation via nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), in which transcripts containing premature termination codons (PTCs) are degraded.41 This is because RI sequences with frame shifts probably introduce PTCs (15 randomly drawn triplets pose a chance of >50% to contain a stop codon). Most of the NMD-related components41 are conserved in most of the fungi present in NCBI's HomoloGene database (Supplementary Table S8). Saccharomyces cerevisiae has an NMD machinery which is, however, not essential. Most RIs of the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica, contain PTCs and there is evidence that corresponding RNA is degraded by NMD.42 Finally, first evidence for functional NMD were found in N. crassa.43 As long as experimental data for a functional relevance of RIs are missing, we note that RIs qualify as mediators for a splicing-dependent mechanism of gene expression regulation, based on structure as well as on statistical association with functional categories (see below).4.4. Does AS facilitate multi-cellular complexity?The complexity of the (multi-)cellular structure has long since been an important feature to classify fungi into sub-taxa.44 Typical instances of diverse complexity are, being yeast or mold, and characteristics of sexual structures. There are predominantly single-celled yeasts, namely S. pombe, S. cerevisiae and P. stipitis, within the phylum of the Ascomycota, whose most complex yeast form is a four-spore ascus. The Mucoromycotina R. oryzae forms simple zygospores during sexual reproduction, but differentiated multi-cellular sporangia for asexual reproduction. Filamentous Ascomycetes produce more complex thalli, as, e.g. ascocarps (apothecium, cleistothecium, perithecium). Finally, Basidio-mycota, probably the most recent ‘crown group’ of fungi, develop complex fruiting bodies.44 We here find that the average AS rate of the mentioned taxa correlates with this order of complexity: Saccharomycotina and Taphrinomycotina (0.26% per-gene AS rate), Mucoro-mycotina (2.3%), Pezizomycotina (7.2%, Ascomycota excluding yeasts) and Basidiomycota (8.6%). We speculate that AS contributes to multi-cellular complexity of the fungi.We find that the fungi with the smallest genomes show nearly no AS. These are the ascomycetous yeasts S. cerevisiae, S. pombe and P. stipitis. This is consistent with an earlier study on S. cerevisiae and S. pombe.17 A major reason for this is probably the reduced proportion of intron-containing genes, e.g. 5% of S. cerevisiae genes vs. 86% in C. immitis, since Hemiascomycetes (Saccharomycetes) experienced intron loss during the course of evolution.45 However, from a certain genome size on, neither the AS rate nor the absolute AS number show any correlation. And, to an extreme, C. neoformans has only ca. 6600 genes but the highest found AS rate (18%).The composition of the splicing machinery can give another perspective in understanding the differences in AS capability. The core components of the spliceosome, i.e. the five snRNPs and essential dynamic factors like Prp8 or Slu7, are generally conserved in eukaryotes. However, the small subunit of U2AF (U2AF35 in human), involved in recognition of the 3'SS, is absent in S. cerevisiae. The family of serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins comprise many known splicing regulators, and it was proposed that a higher SR protein diversity increases the AS complexity.46 Our results do support this hypothesis: among yeasts, which have the lowest AS rates, S. cerevisiae has no SR proteins, only an SR-like homologue Npl3,47 and S. pombe has only two SR proteins.48 On the other hand, many of the other species of our study were found to have many SR and SR-related proteins,49 in accordance with their higher AS rates.We used Pfam domain annotations to analyse the possible functional associations of AS. The most significantly AS-enriched Pfam-coding gene families are ribosomal or do function in thiamine biosynthesis. However, these findings should be taken with caution since the expression level (i.e. EST coverage) is ~50-fold higher than average. Other AS-enriched gene families with moderate gene expression levels do code for fungi-specific protein domains of unknown function. This may indicate that AS is associated with enhanced evolutionary dynamics in these gene families, consistent with a supportive role of AS in gene evolution.50Taking together the relatively low fraction of AS-associated gene families and the gene expression bias among the few candidates, we conclude that a homogenous distribution model is currently a sufficient explanation for the occurrence of AS among the EST-covered genes. However, we anticipate that increasing EST sequencing depths, and a saturation of a major fraction of genes, will allow more detailed insights into the functional association of AS in fungi.Both, the elevated AS rates and the greater amount of splicing regulators of the more complex fungi suggest the hypothesis that AS may facilitate multi-cellular complexity. Furthermore, we found that AS is involved in another elaborate trait of certain fungi, namely virulence.4.5. AS likely regulates virulence of pathogenic fungiA first hint of AS involvement in pathogenicity was given by mere comparison of average AS rates. Human pathogenic fungi show on average a twice as high AS rate (10.7%) than non-pathogenic fungi (5.1%, neither plant nor human pathogenic). This is corroborated by the keywords of AS-associated Pfam domains which indicate enrichment for stress response functions. Moreover, a direct search for homologues of P. brasiliensis' tps1, hsp30 and ddr48 genes that convey cell rescue of this fungus while facing oxidative and heat shock stress in the human body,34 yielded many AS-associated genes in human and plant pathogenic fungi. Hence, it is likely that AS is involved in gene expression regulation during the adaptation to the environmental conditions in the host.The dimorphic switch is another virulence factor, and a key of persistent virulence.33 During host penetration, a fungus can either switch to filamentous growth (e.g. C. albicans, A. fumigatus), or switch from filamentous to uni-cellular growth (e.g. P. brasiliensis Pb01, C. immitis). The dimorphic switch is only poorly understood. However, several contributing compounds have been identified. Cryptococcus neoformans' glucuronoxylomannan (GMX), a capsular polysaccharide, is crucial for switching, as it alters the capsule surface. This increases the resistance against host immune system by hampering antibody and complement mediated phagocytosis.33 We found two homologues of GMX production and modification proteins in C. neoformans (in B-3501A and JEC21), each containing an RI. Of the 19 predicted homologues of tps1, hsp30, ddr48 and GMX-related genes, 5 have AS association in four non-pathogenic fungi (Supplementary Tables S6 and S7).An association of AS with pathogenicity has been found in former studies already. The UrRm75 gene in U. maydis, involved in dimorphism and virulence, contains four introns and has an alternative 3'SS.51 A putative heat shock protein and a putative alpha, alpha-trehalose-phosphate synthase (both stress response-associated) were predicted to be affected by AS in C. neoformans.20 Transcripts of cryptococcal intersectin 1 undergo AS and its disruption affects the production of several virulence factors in C. neoformans.52 In many fungi, Ste12-like transcription factors play essential roles in invasive growth and pseudohyphal development, and their gene transcripts are affected by AS within a conserved exon–intron structure.53 Summar-izing, gene regulation via AS likely facilitates virulence of pathogenic fungi on various levels.FundingThis work was funded by the Friedrich-Schiller-University Jena and the Jena School for Microbial Communication (JSMC).The authors thank Matthias Platzer from the Fritz Lipmann Institute (Jena), Ina Weiß from the chair of bioinformatics Jena, Michael Hiller from MPI of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics (Dresden) and Kerstin Hoffmann from the Friedrich-Schiller-University Jena, Germany for helpful discussions.

In silico comparative mapping of physically mapped ILP markers demonstrated substantial percentage of sequence-based orthology and syntenic relationship between foxtail millet chromosomes and sorghum (~50%), maize (~46%), rice (~21%) and Brachypodium (~21%) chromosomes. Hence, for the first time, we developed large-scale ILP markers in foxtail millet and demonstrated their utility in germplasm characterization, transferability, phylogenetics and comparative mapping studies in millets and bioenergy grass species.1. IntroductionFoxtail millet [(Setaria italica (L.) P. Beauv] has recently been regarded as a tractable model crop due to its small genome (~ 515 Mb; 2n = 2x = 18), low amount of repetitive DNA, inbreeding nature and short life cycle.1,2 Moreover, its close relatedness to several bioenergy crops with complex genomes such as switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), napiergrass (Pennisetum purpureum) and pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) and its potential abiotic stress tolerance adds up to the merits of foxtail millet as an experimental model crop for exploring various plant architectural traits, evolutionary genomics and physiological attributes of the C4 Panicoid grass crops.1–3 Since foxtail millet has one of the largest sets of both cultivated and wild-type germplasm rich in phenotypic variations, it appears promising for association mapping and allele mining of elite and novel variants to be integrated in crop improvement programmes.2,4,5 Hence, considering the importance of foxtail millet, the Joint Genome Institute (JGI) of the Department of Energy, USA, and BGI (formerly Beijing Genome Initiative), China, have recently sequenced its genome.6,7 The availability of genomic sequence has motivated the scientific community to generate genomic resources, which ultimately had resulted in the development of large-scale sequence-based genomic8 and genic expressed sequence tag (EST)-derived microsatellite markers.9 Noteworthy, the recently developed ‘Foxtail millet Marker Database (FmMDb)’ (http://www.nipgr.res.in/foxtail.html)10 encompasses all these generated genomic resources for the benefit of research community aiming in genetic improvement of target millet and its related bioenergy crop species, thus bridging the gap between the researchers and breeders.DNA markers such as restriction fragment-length polymorphism,11 random amplified polymorphic DNA,12 amplified fragment-length polymorphism,13 simple sequence repeat polymorphism (SSR),14 single-nucleotide polymorphism15 and intron-length polymorphism (ILP)16 exploit the variations, or polymorphisms in DNA sequences are used in various genotyping applications in crop plants. Of these, ILP markers are unique since they are gene-specific, co-dominant, hypervariable, neutral, convenient and reliable.17 ILP markers utilize the variation in the intron sequences and are the most easily recognizable type as it could be detected by PCR with primers designed on exons flanking the target intron.18 Thus, these markers in spite of being derived from gene sequences showed higher intra-specific polymorphism in plant species than other kinds of markers. In addition to being sequence-tagged sites markers,19 ILP markers have high transferability rates among related plant species.18,20 In order to facilitate straightforward mining of ILP markers, Yang et al.17 has developed a web-based database platform named PIP (potential intron polymorphism) to provide detailed information of the PIP markers and homologous relationships among PIP markers from different species.Regardless of these advantages, very few reports are available on development of ILP markers in plant species when compared with reports on other DNA markers. Noteworthy, till now only one study has been carried out on ILP markers in foxtail millet,20 where about 98 markers were developed and characterized. Hence, in view of the importance of ILPs and the availability of less significant number of ILP markers in foxtail millet, the present study was conducted aiming at: (i) developing ILP markers at large-scale from the entire set of publicly available foxtail millet ESTs, (ii) demonstrating the applicability of the ILP markers in examining genetic diversity and cross-species transferability and (iii) developing physical map for studying in silico ILP marker-based comparative mapping between foxtail millet and other grass species such as sorghum, maize, rice and Brachypodium.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant material and DNA isolationThe details of plant materials used in the study are summarized in Supplementary Table S1. The seeds of all the investigated species were surface-sterilized in 3% sodium hypochlorite for 20 min, rinsed with sterile distilled water and were germinated in greenhouse. The genomic DNA was isolated from the fresh young leaves using the CTAB method as described elsewhere.21 The DNA was purified and then quantified on agarose gel by comparison with 50 ng/µl of standard lambda (<U+03BB>) DNA marker (NEB).2.2. Development of putative ILP markersThe publicly available EST sequences of S. italica were searched and retrieved from NCBI dbEST (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/db/). Approximately 66 027 ESTs were used for the unigene definition using the CD-HIT (Cluster Database at High Identity with Tolerance) software tool (http://weizhong-lab.ucsd.edu/cdhit_suite/cgi-bin/index.cgi) for redundancy minimization and assembling of sequences. The non-redundant ESTs were used for the development of specific intron-based markers. Using rice genomic sequence as reference, PIP database (http://ibi.zju.edu.cn/pgl/pip/)17 was used to predict intron positions in the EST sequences and then designed a pair of primers flanking the intron position. A query EST was considered to be homologous to a subject-coding sequence only if there were at least 100 bp overlapping and 80% similarity between them. The corresponding position and length of identified introns from the subject species were obtained from the PIP database.17 To cross-check the primer-designing potential of ILP markers and validate the results of the PIP database, the forward and reverse primers designed for the ILP markers were BLAST-searched against latest released foxtail millet pseudomolecules of nine chromosomes (http://www.phytozome.net).2.3. Functional annotation and physical mapping of ILP markersThe putative functions of the ILP markers were assigned by executing BLASTX search of respective marker encompassing EST sequences against the non-redundant database at NCBI (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) with default search parameters. The ILP markers were BLAST-searched against the whole-genome sequences of foxtail millet available at Phytozome (http://www.phytozome.net) and plotted individually on each of the nine foxtail millet chromosomes according to their ascending order of physical position (bp), from the short-arm telomere to the long-arm telomere and finally visualized in the MapChart software.22 To further validate the BLAST results of in silico physical mapping, we re-analysed the forward and reverse primers of ILP markers against foxtail millet chromosome pseudomolecules using the ePCR program (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sutils/e-pcr).232.4. Validation of ILP markersThe ILPs were amplified in a 25 µl total volume containing 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase (Sigma), 50 ng of genomic DNA, 10 µmol/l of each primer, 0.5 mmol/l of each dNTPs and 2.5 µl of 10× PCR reaction buffer [500 mM KCl, 200 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.4) and 3 mM MgCl2] in an iCycler thermal controller (Bio-Rad). The PCR profile was an initial denaturation of 3 min at 94°C, followed by 35 cycles of 60 s at 94°C, 60 s at 50–55°C and 2 min at 72°C, and a final extension of 10 min at 72°C. The amplicons were resolved on 2% agarose gel (Cambrex, USA) in Tris-borate EDTA buffer (pH 8.0), stained with ethidium bromide and analysed using GelDoc-It™ imaging system (UVP). The fragment size for each locus was determined by 100 bp standard size markers (NEB). Results were confirmed by three replicate assays.The amplified products (alleles) from millet and non-millet species were eluted and cloned into pGEM(R)-T Easy vector (Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions. The recombinant plasmids were purified using AccuPrep Plasmid MiniPrep DNA Extraction Kit (Bioneer) following the manufacturer's protocol. The plasmids were sequenced in an automated sequencer (3730xI DNA Analyzer, Applied Biosystems) using M13 forward and reverse primers. The sequence information was used to construct multiple sequence alignment along with a reference S. italica sequence using the ClustalW2 program (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/clustalw2/index.html).2.5. Genetic diversityThe ILP marker profiles amplified among 96 foxtail millet accessions were scored manually; each allele was scored as present (1) or absent (0) for each of the ILP loci. Polymorphic informative content (PIC) values were calculated according to Roldán-Ruiz et al.24 as PICi = 2fi(1 - fi), where fi is the frequency of the amplified allele (band present), and (1 - fi) is the frequency of the null allele (band absent) of marker i. Using pairwise similarity matrix of Jaccard's coefficient,25 the level of genetic diversity among foxtail millet accessions was calculated and a phylogenetic tree was constructed by unweighted pair-group method of arithmetic average, neighbour-joining (NJoin) module of the NTSYS-pc software v2.02.26 The genetic relationships among millets and non-millet grass species based on cross-transferability of ILP markers were determined based on Nei (1983)27 diversity co-efficient, and a phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbour-joining (NJ) tree interface of the PowerMarker software ver2.5.28 The observed heterozygosity (HO), Nei's average gene diversity27 and fixation index (FIS) were also computed using the PowerMarker software ver2.5.28 Correlation analysis among PIC and the number of alleles were examined using the GraphPad InStat software v3.10 (www.graphpad.com).2.6. In silico comparative genome mappingThe ILP markers that were physically mapped on the nine chromosomes of foxtail millet were BLASTN-searched against genome sequences of sorghum, maize, rice and Brachypodium (www.phytozome.net) to develop marker-based syntenic relationships among the chromosomes of foxtail millet and three other grass species. A cut-off bit score of 54.7 and an E-value of <1e - 05 were considered optimum for BLASTN analysis. The marker-based syntenic relationships among foxtail millet, sorghum, maize, rice and Brachypodium were finally visualized with visualization blocks in the Circos software v0.55 (http://circos.ca).293. Results and discussion3.1. Development of ILP markers and physical mapping in foxtail millet genomeA set of 66 027 EST sequences of S. italica produced 24 828 non-redundant ESTs, which were used for generating ILP markers by using rice as reference genome in the PIP database.17 A total of 5123 ILP markers (20.6%) were generated out of 24 828 EST sequences with an average frequency of ~12.6 ILP markers per megabase genomic sequences (Supplementary Table S2). BLAST analysis of 5123 ILP markers against the foxtail millet genome showed the presence of all the markers in the genome, and the determination of genomic distribution of these 5123 ILP markers on the foxtail millet genome revealed physical localization of 4049 markers on the nine chromosomes of foxtail millet with an average marker density of 9.8 markers/Mb (Fig. 1; Table 1). The average marker density was maximum (14.1/Mb) in chromosome 9, followed by chromosome 5 (11.8/Mb), and minimum in chromosome 8 (5.7/Mb). An extensive analysis of chromosome-wise distribution and frequency of these physically mapped ILP markers showed higher frequency of markers mapped on chromosome 9 (831 markers, 20.5%) and minimum on chromosome 8 (230, 5.7%) (Fig. 1; Table 1).

Functional annotation of ILPBLASTX analyses of the 5123 EST sequences suggested a nearly defined function for ~71.5% of ILP markers, and 28.5% had no similarities to previously sequenced genes. Based on the function, the ILP markers with defined function (71.5%) were grouped into five major categories (Fig. 2). The largest category (47.4%) contained EST sequences with hypothetical/uncharacterized/putative functions. The second largest category (26.2%) comprised stress-related transcripts. The housekeeping proteins (9.5) ranked third, followed by protein kinases (8.6%) and transcription factors (8.3%) (Fig. 2). Foxtail millet being a potentially abiotic stress-tolerant crop particularly towards drought and salinity, investigating the EST sequences with hypothetical/uncharacterized/putative functions (47.4%) and those which no similarities to previously sequenced genes (28.5%) could provide novel clues on the stress tolerance mechanisms.

Marker validation, cross-genera transferability and genetic basis of sequence length variationTo amplify introns by PCR, the exon-primed intron-crossing PCR (EPIC-PCR) method was used,30 where primers were designed in flanking exons using the PIP database. The advantages of EPIC-PCR are it is fast, reliable, reproducible and convenient, providing ready-to-use and clearly intelligible results. Hence, from the 4049 physically mapped ILP markers, 440 primer pairs flanking the exons were chosen for further analyses based on two criteria, viz. representing the whole genome of foxtail millet and the function of the EST. All the ILP markers were evidenced to produce clear, successful and reproducible amplification in S. italica cv. Prasad with 100% amplification potential (Supplementary Table S3). This demonstrates the significance of the developed 4049 ILP markers in expediting foxtail millet genomics and molecular breeding. About 391 (~90%) of the 440 ILP markers amplified unique single allele, while 49 markers amplified more than one allele/multiple alleles. Thus, a total of 495 alleles were amplified by 440 ILP markers in S. italica cv. Prasad (Supplementary Table S3). All the 440 ILP markers have the ability to distinguish the investigated millet and non-millet species into two distinct groups (Fig. 3). Genetic relationships among millet and non-millet grass species based on 43 foxtail millet ILP markers, using NJoin clustering. Nine millet species including foxtail millet clearly differentiated from the five non-millet grass species and expected genetic relationships among species under study were also apparent.Genetic relationships among millet and non-millet grass species based on 43 foxtail millet ILP markers, using NJoin clustering. Nine millet species including foxtail millet clearly differentiated from the five non-millet grass species and expected genetic relationships among species under study were also apparent.From these validated set of 440 ILP markers, about 100 markers representing the whole foxtail millet genome were chosen to evaluate its polymorphism and molecular diversity potential in a set of eight accessions of Setaria including five cultivated and three wild species. About 45 (45%) SiILP markers showed polymorphism and a total of 163 alleles ranging from 1 to 5 alleles were amplified by candidate SiILP markers with an average of 2.15 alleles per marker locus (Supplementary Table S4). The polymorphic potential (~45%) of ILP markers estimated among foxtail millet cultivated and wild accessions was higher than that reported using the ILP markers derived from foxtail millet genomic sequences.20 The higher polymorphic potential of ILP markers is expected because of their development targeting the hypervariable introns, which are under less selective pressure.In order to investigate the utility of the ILP markers in cross-genera transferability, the 100 validated set of ILP markers were used to amplify the genomic DNA of millet (barnyard millet, finger millet, kodo millet, little millet, pearl millet, proso millet, guinea grass) and non-millet species (switchgrass, sorghum, maize, rice, Brachypodium) (Table 2; Fig. 4). Of the 100 SiILP markers assayed, the highest transferability percentage (98%) was observed in proso millet and lowest (59.4%) in wheat, with an average percent transferability of ~85% (Table 2). Markers which showed a consistent amplification profile in other species were scored as being cross-transferable, thus confirming the utility of developed ILP markers for revealing high cross-genera transferability. To gain further insight into the molecular basis of cross-transferability of ILP markers, the paralogous relationships of 4049 markers orthologous between foxtail millet and rice genes were determined. Three hundred and forty-seven (8.6%) of 4049 orthologous ILP markers were present in paralogous foxtail millet genes, while 80 (2%) were found in paralogous rice genes. It inferred that 3622 ILP markers designed in this study are unique either in the foxtail millet or in the rice genome. Interestingly, the 100 ILP markers showing orthologous relationships between foxtail millet and rice genes selected for cross-transferability study did not show any paralogous relationships within either rice or foxtail millet genome. This confirms the higher cross-transferability potential of ILP markers due to orthologous relationships among species rather than paralogy within species.

The amplicons are resolved in 2% agarose gel along with 100 bp DNA size standard.To examine whether the PCR products were really amplified or homologous to the target genes in millet and non-millet species, we randomly picked up a primer pair, SiILP4686 (Zea mays PHD transcription factor), which amplified variant alleles from 214 to 455 bp (Fig. 4). As expected, the sequences of cloned PCR products of the investigated species revealed indels and several point mutations, such as single-base insertions, deletions or translocations; in addition, polymorphism in intron length was observed (data not shown). Overall, multiple sequence alignment has shown that they were homologous to each other and comprised conserved exon regions at two end positions and non-conserved or variable intron region in the middle. Similar kind of observation was also reported in rice,18Hypericum perforatum31 and foxtail millet.20 Further, higher level of transferability of ILPs compared with previously identified markers reflects the conserved nature of exon positions in gene and variability in the non-coding sequences.18 Hence, in our study, the high levels of cross-species amplification indicate that the foxtail millet ILP markers could be successfully useful for comparative mapping in millet and non-millet species. Similarly, it was shown that EST-SSR has higher cross-species transferability than genomic SSR markers.10,32,33 In addition, all the 100 ILP markers possess ability to distinguish the investigated millet and non-millet species belonging to different genera. The variations in the number of alleles per ILP marker locus in different species studied are possibly dependent upon ploidy level, nature and number of genotype sets in each species used for analysis.3.4. Genetic diversityBesides, the validated physically mapped markers could enable one to discriminate all the 96 cultivated and wild foxtail millet accessions from each other with a level diversity from 0 to 65% (Fig. 5). A core set of 89 cultivated S. italica accessions and 7 related wild species were used to decipher the polymorphic potential of 20 ILP markers representing the whole genome of foxtail millet. In total, 59 alleles were identified with an average of about 3 alleles per locus, varying from 2 to 5 (Table 3). This was comparable with a recent study in foxtail millet using ILP markers,20 where the average number of alleles per locus reported was 2.6. The polymorphic information content (PIC) values were extended from 0.03 to 0.47 with a mean of 0.20. The observed heterozygosity (HO) for individual loci ranged from 0.00 to 0.32, with a mean of 0.13 (Table 3). The PIC value was calculated in order to examine the extent of information on diversity that these markers can provide and compare these results with previous published studies. The average PIC value (0.20) reported in this study was lower than that reported for rice (0.45 and 0.44).18,34 The probable reason for differences in results might be attributed to the difference in number of genotypes and their genetic background and number of markers used. Nei's average gene diversity (Nei) ranged from 0.03 to 0.52, with a mean of 0.22. Among all the loci analysed with fixation index (FIS), 15 loci were found positive, representing excess of observed homozygotes, whereas 5 loci were negative, demonstrating heterozygotes, with a mean of 0.42 per locus (Table 3). There was no significant correlation observed between PIC and allele number for the 20 markers investigated (data not shown). The phylogenetic tree constructed in this study using ILP markers differentiated 89 cultivated S. italica accessions and 7 related wild species from each other and clustered according to their taxonomic classification (Fig. 5). The dendrogram constructed grouped 96 Setaria accessions into two distinct clusters, cluster I with 89 accessions comprising cultivated species (foxtail millet, S. italica) and cluster II includes the wild Setaria species (Fig. 5). Therefore, the ILP markers with high amplification and polymorphic potential distributed over nine chromosomes of foxtail millet genome could be promisingly useful for many large-scale genotyping applications in foxtail millet.

In silico comparative genome mapping between foxtail millet and other grass speciesIn order to substantiate that the ILP marker-based physical map constructed in this study for foxtail millet genome could be useful in comparative genome mapping, the physically mapped 4049 SiILP markers were compared with their physical location on the chromosomes of other related grass genomes, including sorghum, maize, rice and Brachypodium (Fig. 6; Table 4). The comparative genome mapping showed considerably significant proportion of sequence-based orthology and syntenic relationship of SiILP markers distributed over nine foxtail millet chromosomes with sorghum (~50%, 2038), maize (~46%, 1867), rice (~21%, 868) and Brachypodium (~21%, 845) chromosomes (Fig. 6; Supplementary Tables S5–S8).

Comparative mapping between foxtail millet chromosomes with (a) sorghum; (b) maize; (c) rice and (d) Brachypodium chromosomes, using 4049 physically mapped foxtail millet ILP markers. Maximum syntenic relationships of foxtail millet chromosomes with sorghum chromosomes based on ILP markers was evident.The comparative mapping showed a syntenic relationship of 2038 ILP marker loci distributed over 9 chromosomes of foxtail millet with 2038 genomic regions on 10 chromosomes of sorghum (Fig. 6a; Supplementary Table S5). About 50% syntenic relationship of ILP marker loci between foxtail millet and sorghum chromosomes was observed on an average, with maximum synteny between foxtail millet chromosome 9 and sorghum chromosome 1 (~91%), followed between foxtail millet chromosome 5 and sorghum chromosome 3 (~89%) (Fig. 6a; Supplementary Table S5).About 1867 ILP marker loci distributed over nine chromosomes of foxtail millet showed significant matches with 1867 genomic regions of 10 maize chromosomes (Fig. 6b; Supplementary Table S6). Interestingly, each foxtail millet chromosome showed sytenic relationship with two maize chromosomes, thus highlighting the recent whole-genome duplication in maize. All the nine foxtail millet chromosomes showed considerable and higher average frequency (~46%) of ILP marker-based syntenic relationship with specific maize chromosomes. The physically mapped ILP markers on the foxtail millet chromosome 9 showed maximum synteny (~57%) with maize chromosome 1 and between foxtail millet chromosome 5 and maize chromosome 3 (~51%) (Fig. 6b; Supplementary Table S6).The syntenic relationship of 868 ILP marker loci distributed over nine chromosomes of foxtail millet with 868 genomic regions on 12 chromosomes of rice was evidenced (Fig. 6c; Supplementary Table S7). Maximum synteny of ILP marker loci was observed between foxtail millet chromosome 9 and rice chromosome 3 (~68%) and between foxtail millet chromosome 5 and rice chromosome 1 (~83%) (Fig. 6c; Supplementary Table S7).The ILP marker-based comparative mapping showed a similar pattern of synteny between foxtail millet and rice. Brachypodium chromosomes demonstrated a syntenic relationship with an average frequency of ~21% (845 marker loci) (Fig. 6d; Supplementary Table S8). The physically mapped ILP markers on the foxtail millet chromosome 9 showed maximum synteny (~76%) with Brachypodium chromosome 1 (Fig. 6d; Supplementary Table S8).Though there are many reports showing the mapping of microsatellite markers either genetically or physically on orthologous or syntenic chromosomes of different related plant genomes,7–9,35–38 this is the first report of comparative mapping using ILP markers. The syntenic relationships showed a higher degree of synteny between foxtail and sorghum genome followed by maize, rice and Brachypodium, which is possibly due to their taxonomic relationship, where foxtail millet, sorghum and maize belong to same subfamily Panicoideae, while rice belongs to Ehrhartoideae and Brachypodium belongs to Pooideae. The comparative mapping thus demonstrates the decrease of colinearity with increasing phylogenetic distance among plant species. These results are in accordance with the interpretations reported using genomic SSR markers8 and genic EST-derived SSR markers9 in foxtail millet. This shows the applicability of ILP marker-based comparative genome mapping between foxtail millet and other grass species such as sorghum, maize, rice and Brachypodium in translating the sequence information/candidate genes from this diploid crop to other polyploid biofuel grasses. Further, the ILP marker-based comparative mapping between foxtail millet and other grass species could enable transfer of gene-based marker information among these target species and thus would expedite map-based isolation of genes of agronomic importance in foxtail millet.4. ConclusionsTo the best of our knowledge, the ILP markers developed in this study are the large-scale novel set of markers in foxtail millet in addition to 98 earlier reported by Gupta et al.20 The present study identified 5123 ILP markers from 24 828 non-redundant ESTs, of which 4049 markers were physically mapped onto 9 chromosomes of foxtail millet genome. The validation, cross-genera transferability and genetic diversity studies demonstrated expediency of these ILP markers in germplasm characterization, genome relationships in millet and non-millet species and comparative mapping. The newly developed large-scale SiILP markers will be made available to the research community through the FmMDb (http://www.nipgr.res.in/foxtail.html)10 and this will promisingly expedite the molecular breeding in foxtail millet and other millets and forage grass species.Supplementary DataSupplementary Data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThe authors' work in this area was supported by the core grant of NIPGR.

IntroductionMicrosatellites, which are also known as simple sequence repeats (SSRs, often defined as 1–6 bp), variable numbers of tandem repeats (VNTRs) and short tandem repeats (STRs), have been found in all genomic regions of all examined organisms.1 Microsatellites have been traditionally regarded as ‘junk’ DNA and are mainly used as ‘neutral’ genetic markers.2 In recent years, microsatellites have been demonstrated to have many important biological functions (e.g. the regulation of chromatin organization, DNA metabolic processes, gene activity and RNA structure)3,4 and have therefore emerged as the third major class of genetic variations, alongside single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and copy number variations (CNVs).5 Microsatellite markers are co-dominant, multi-allelic, easily detected, hyper-variable, highly reproducible and abundant in the genome.6 Therefore, among the available genetic marker systems (e.g. RFLP, RAPD, SSR, AFLP, SRAP and SNP), the SSR marker has been the preferential choice for various applications, such as variety identification, genetic diversity evaluation, phylogenetic relationship analysis, genetic map construction, linkage/association mapping of gene/QTL, marker-assisted selection and comparative mapping.7,8Of the 47 genera in the Brassiceae tribe within the Brassicaceae (Cruciferae) family, the genus Brassica currently comprises 38 species,9 which include economically important crops that provide many vegetables, condiments, fodders and oil products.10 The main cultivated Brassica species include three diploid species, Brassica rapa (AA, n = 10), Brassica nigra (BB, n = 8) and Brassica oleracea (CC, n = 9) and three allotetraploid species, Brassica juncea (AABB, n = 18), Brassica napus (AACC, n = 19) and Brassica carinata (BBCC, n = 17). The genetic relationship of the six widely cultivated Brassica species are described as U's triangle11 in which the three allotetraploid species originated from the chromosome doubling after the natural hybridization between the three diploid species.Much research has been conducted to identify/characterize genomic/genic microsatellites and/or to develop markers in the Brassica species through probe (containing a repeated motif) hybridization against genomic/cDNA clones12–19 or through in silico analysis of publicly available bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) sequences,20 BAC-end sequences (BESs),21–23 genome survey sequences (GSSs),24 whole genome shotgun sequences (WGSs),25,26 expressed sequence tag sequences27,28 and unique transcript sequences.29–32 However, the pattern of microsatellite distribution has remained ambiguous, and the development/utilization of SSR marker has still been limited/inefficient in Brassica, which is mostly due to the lack of genome sequences. First, the sequences, programmes, criteria and parameters that are used for mining microsatellites usually have differed across these previous studies, which have made it difficult to compare and integrate these results to obtain the definitive conclusions on the pattern of microsatellite distribution. Secondly, only a small part of the genomic sequences of usually one species have been analysed in each of these previous studies. Therefore, it has been impossible to obtain general conclusions on the pattern of microsatellite distribution. In addition, the total number (˜10 000) of previously developed publicly available SSR markers is still limited33 and not sufficient for many studies, which require a large number and/or high density of genetic markers, such as high-density linkage map construction, gene/QTL fine-mapping and genome-wide/regional association mapping. Thirdly, due to the lack of genome sequences, the genomic distribution of microsatellites and the physical position(s)/product(s) number of the previously developed publicly available Brassica SSR markers have been all or mostly unclear, which has hindered their exact and/or effective utilization.Thanks to the rapid development of genome sequencing technology, the genome sequences are currently available for tens of plant species (http://www.phytozome.net), including three recently sequenced Brassica crop species, namely B. rapa,34B. oleracea (http://www.ocri-genomics.org/bolbase/index.html) and B. napus (our unpublished data). These sequences provide a powerful tool for genome-wide microsatellite characterization and/or marker development, which has been conducted in several model and crop plants, such as Arabidopsis (http://www.arabidopsis.org/), rice,35 maize (mips.helmholtz-muenchen.de/plant/maize/), sorghum (genome.jgi-psf.org/Sorbi1/Sorbi1.home.htm), black cottonwood,36 cucumber,37Brachypodim distachyon38 and foxtail millet39 but not Brassica. In view of this circumstance, we conducted genome-wide microsatellite characterization and marker development in the three sequenced Brassica crop species. The main objectives of this study were as follows: (i) to characterize and compare the frequency and distribution with respect to the motif length, type and repeat number of microsatellites in the assembled genomic sequences of these Brassica species; (ii) to characterize and compare the genomic distribution of microsatellites in the assembled pseudochromosomes of these Brassica species; (iii) to develop SSR markers from the assembled genomic sequences of these Brassica species and determine their copy number and positional relationship with the previously developed publicly available Brassica SSR markers and the annotated genome components; (iv) to construct a user-friendly comprehensive SSR marker database of Brassica and (v) to evaluate the newly developed genome-wide SSR markers by PCR (polymerase chain reaction) amplification in representative B. napus inbred lines.2. Materials and methods2.1. Sources of genome sequencesThe three inbred/pure lines, namely Chiifu-401 (B. rapa), O212 (B. oleracea) and Zhongshuang11 (B. napus), were sequenced by our own and several other institutes using Illumina GA II technology, and high-quality sequence reads were assembled using stringent parameters. Finally, a total of 40 549 (283.8 Mb), 120 061 (540.0 Mb) and 5098 (1000.9 Mb) sequence scaffolds were obtained for B. rapa, B. oleracea and B. napus, respectively, which represents 58.5, 77.6 and 81.7% of the nuclear genome and covers >98% of the gene space.2.2. Identification of microsatellitesPERL5 script MIcroSAtellite (http://pgrc.ipk-gatersleben.de/misa/)40 was used to identify and localize perfect microsatellites as well as compound microsatellites that are interrupted by a certain number of bases. The repeat unit length was defined as the default mono- to hexanucleotide because microsatellites of longer repeat units are very scarce. The minimum repeat unit was defined as 12, 6, 4, 3, 3 and 3, respectively, for the mono- to hexanucleotide. Compound microsatellites were defined as =2 repeats interrupted by =100 bp.2.3. Development of SSR primersPrimer pairs were designed from the flanking sequences of identified microsatellites using the primer3_core program (http://www-genome.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/primer/primer3_www.cgi) in batch mode. Two perl scripts, p3_in.pl and p3_out.pl, serve as interface modules for the programme-to-programme data interchange between MISA and the primer modeling software Primer3. The primer-designing parameters were 18–27 bp primer length, 57–63°C melting temperature, 30–70% GC content and 100–300 bp product size. The designed SSR primer pairs were denominated as the names of sequence scaffolds followed by a serial number of microsatellites (such as BrScaffold000001_1).2.4. Localization/mapping of SSR markers by in silico PCRThe primer-pair sequences of previously developed publicly available Brassica SSR markers were downloaded from the brassica.info website (http://www.brassica.info/resource/markers/ssr-exchange.php) and additional files in the recent literature.20,24,26,29,30,32 To determine their physical positions and copy numbers, the previously and newly developed Brassica SSR markers were aligned to the assembled genomic sequences of the studied Brassica species. This alignment was conducted using the in silico PCR method41 with the following default parameters: 2 bp mismatch, 1 bp gap, 50 bp margin and 50–1000 bp product size.2.5. Validation of SSR markers by PCR amplificationA total of 3974 SSR primer pairs were synthesized to test for PCR amplification in six representative B. napus cultivars/inbred lines (Tapidor, Westar, Zhongshuang11, No. 07197, No. 73290 and No. 91032), which were chosen from the core collections of a natural population and the parents of several segregating populations in our laboratory, for their large genetic distance and extreme trait(s) performance (our unpublished data).Genomic DNA of the six accessions was isolated from young leaves. PCR was performed in 20-µl volume that contained 0.2 mM dNTP, 0.5 U of Taq DNA polymerase, 75 ng of template DNA, 0.5 µM each primer and 1× PCR buffer (10 mM Tris pH 9.0, 50 mM KCl and 1.5 mM MgCl2). DNA amplification was conducted by the ‘touchdown’ method, with the following thermal profile: initial denaturation at 94°C for 5 min; six cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 45 s at 63°C with a 1°C decrease in annealing temperature per cycle and 1 min at 72°C; 26 cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 45 s at 57°C and 1 min at 72°C and a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. The PCR products were separated on 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and were visualized by silver staining.2.6. Statistical analysisThe correlation analysis was performed using the SAS PROC CORR procedure incorporated into SAS version 8.0. The Excel statistical function CHISQ.TEST was used to obtain the significance level (<U+2060>|$P_{\chi ^2 \,{\rm test}} $|<U+2060>) of the degree of fit for the practical and hypothetical distributions of microsatellites as well as genes and TEs in the assembled pseudochromosomes.3. Results3.1. Frequency and distribution with respect to the motif length, type and numberA total of 140 998, 229 389 and 420 991 perfect mono- to hexanucleotide repeat microsatellites were identified from 283.8, 540.0 and 1000.9 Mb of assembled genomic sequences of B. rapa, B. oleracea and B. napus, respectively (Table 1), with an overall frequency of 496.8, 424.8 and 420.6 per Mb or one every 2.01, 2.35 and 2.38 kb. Number, repeat number and total repeat length of the mono- to hexanucleotide repeats or motifs of microsatellites in the assembled genomic sequences of B. rapa, B. oleracea and B. napusNumber, repeat number and total repeat length of the mono- to hexanucleotide repeats or motifs of microsatellites in the assembled genomic sequences of B. rapa, B. oleracea and B. napusIn accordance with their high correlation (Supplementary Table S1), the distributions with respect to the motif length of microsatellites in the assembled genomic sequences of B. rapa, B. oleracea and B. napus were almost identical: mono-, di-, tri- and tetranucleotide repeats accounted for very similar and relatively high proportions, whereas penta- and hexanucleotide repeats were relatively uncommon (Fig. 1A).

The vertical axis shows the abundances (%) of microsatellites with different motif lengths, types or repeat numbers that are discriminated by the legends of different colours. For Figure 1B, because there is a limitation in the number of items (<256) in Excel, the abundances of the mono- to pentanucleotide motifs (a total of 151 types) are shown, while those for the hexanucleotide motifs (a total of 350 types) are displayed in Supplementary Table S2.Distribution with respect to the motif length (A), type (B) and repeat number (C) of microsatellites in the assembled genomic sequences of B. rapa, B. oleracea and B. napus. The vertical axis shows the abundances (%) of microsatellites with different motif lengths, types or repeat numbers that are discriminated by the legends of different colours. For Figure 1B, because there is a limitation in the number of items (<256) in Excel, the abundances of the mono- to pentanucleotide motifs (a total of 151 types) are shown, while those for the hexanucleotide motifs (a total of 350 types) are displayed in Supplementary Table S2.In accordance with their high correlation (Supplementary Table S1), the distributions with respect to the motif type of microsatellites in the assembled genomic sequences of B. rapa, B. oleracea and B. napus were almost identical (Fig. 1B; Supplementary Table S2). More specifically, both the dominant/major and absent/scarce mono- to hexanucleotide motifs in the assembled genomic sequences of the three Brassica species were mostly identical (Table 1; Supplementary Table S3). Interestingly, the dominant/major motifs (A, AT, AAG/AAT, AAAT, AAAAT and AAAAAT) were all A/T rich (Table 1), whereas the absent/scarce motifs were mostly C/G rich (Supplementary Table S3), which were highly consistent with the previous reports on microsatellites identified from 536 seed BACs of B. rapa,20 3500 genomic clones42 and 595 577 WGSs26 of B. oleracea and 13 794 GSSs (mainly BESs) of B. napus.24 It should be noted that the nucleotide composition characteristics of both the dominant/major and absent/scarce motifs in the assembled genomic sequences of the three Brassica species corresponded well to their much higher A/T (mean = 63.8%) than C/G (mean = 36.2%) content.In accordance with their high correlation (Supplementary Table S1), the distributions with respect to the motif repeat number of microsatellites in the assembled genomic sequences of B. rapa, B. oleracea and B. napus were also almost identical (Fig. 1C). Obviously, the microsatellite abundances decreased significantly as the motif repeat number increased, and the rate of this change was the slowest for dinucleotide repeat, followed by mono- and trinucleotide repeats, and was faster for other long repeats (Fig. 2). As a consequence, the difference between the average and minimum motif repeat numbers was the largest for dinucleotide repeat, followed by mono- and trinucleotide repeats, and was relatively small for tetra- to hexanucleotide repeats (Table 1).

The vertical axis shows the abundances of microsatellites that have different motif repeat numbers (from 3 to >20), which are discriminated by legends of different colours.In addition, the motif repeat number of the corresponding mono- to hexanucleotide repeats or motifs of microsatellites in the assembled genomic sequences of B. rapa, B. oleracea and B. napus were highly similar (Table 1; Supplementary Table S4). As a consequence, the total repeat length (=microsatellite number × motif length × motif repeat number) proportions of the corresponding mono- to hexanucleotide repeats or motifs of microsatellites in the assembled genomic sequences of B. rapa, B. oleracea and B. napus were mostly similar (Table 1; Supplementary Table S5).3.2. Genomic distributionThe genomic distributions of microsatellites and their relation with the annotated genome components (mainly as genes and TEs) were investigated (Fig. 3; Table 2), based on the assembled pseudochromosomes of the sequenced Brassica species (currently available for B. rapa and B. oleracea; Supplementary Table S6). <U+03C7>/italic>2 test between the practical and hypothetical/average distribution of microsatellites and their correlation with genes and TEs, for all pseudochromosomes of B. rapa and B. oleracea<U+03C7>/italic>2 test between the practical and hypothetical/average distribution of microsatellites and their correlation with genes and TEs, for all pseudochromosomes of B. rapa and B. oleraceaGenome-wide distributions of microsatellites as well as genes and TEs in the assembled pseudochromosomes of B. rapa (A) and B. oleracea (B). The horizontal axis shows the pseudochromosomes (B. rapa: A1–A10; B. oleracea: C1–C9), which are divided into 1-Mb intervals. The left and right vertical axes show the frequencies of the microsatellites/genes and TEs, respectively. On the figure, the curves/lines of different styles represent the practical/hypothetical(average) frequencies of microsatellites, genes and TEs, respectively.Genome-wide distributions of microsatellites as well as genes and TEs in the assembled pseudochromosomes of B. rapa (A) and B. oleracea (B). The horizontal axis shows the pseudochromosomes (B. rapa: A1–A10; B. oleracea: C1–C9), which are divided into 1-Mb intervals. The left and right vertical axes show the frequencies of the microsatellites/genes and TEs, respectively. On the figure, the curves/lines of different styles represent the practical/hypothetical(average) frequencies of microsatellites, genes and TEs, respectively.For both B. rapa and B. oleracea, the frequency of microsatellites was high at/near both ends but low in/near the middle of all the pseudochromosomes (Fig. 3), which likely corresponded to the peri- telomere and centromere, respectively.43 The frequencies of microsatellites for the different pseudochromosomes of B. rapa or B. oleracea were generally comparable, which was in accordance with the similar frequencies of genes/TEs for these chromosomes (Fig. 3; Table 2). Interestingly, the homoeologous chromosomes A3 and C3 both exhibited the highest microsatellite frequency among all the pseudochromosomes of B. rapa or B. oleracea, respectively, which was in accordance with their highest gene frequency among these chromosomes (Fig. 3; Table 2). In accordance with the high significance of the P-values of the <U+03C7>2 test between the practical and hypothetical/average frequencies of microsatellites in the 1-Mb genomic intervals (Table 2), the physical distribution of microsatellites on all the pseudochromosomes of both B. rapa and B. oleracea were highly non-uniform (Fig. 3), which suggests the non-random occurrence of microsatellites. In accordance with the usually higher P-values of the <U+03C7>2 test between the practical and hypothetical/average frequencies of microsatellites for the 9 pseudochromosomes of B. oleracea than for the 10 pseudochromosomes of B. rapa (Table 2), the distribution of microsatellites was more uneven in B. oleracea than in B. rapa (Fig. 3), which was likely attributable to the more concentrated distribution of genes/TEs in B. rapa than in B. oleracea. For both B. rapa and B. oleracea, the frequencies of microsatellites in the 1-Mb genomic intervals studied were significantly positively or negatively correlated with those of genes (total r = 0.75 and 0.87) or TEs (total r = -0.61 and -0.73), respectively (Table 2), which was accordant with one of the interesting findings in this study, that the genomic distribution of microsatellites was generally in accordance with that of genes but opposite to that of TEs (Fig. 3). These results were in agreement with the previous findings, which showed that microsatellites are preferentially associated with non-repetitive DNA/gene sequences in the plant genome.5,44 The high agreement of microsatellites and genes strongly suggests the putative role of microsatellites in regulating gene function3–5 and the use of SSR markers for tagging/cloning genes.In conclusion, the genomic distributions of microsatellites in the assembled pseudochromosomes of B. rapa and B. oleracea were generally similar.3.3. Development and database of genome-wide SSR markersA total of 115 869 (92.1%), 185 662 (91.4%) and 356 522 (95.0%) primer pairs were successfully designed from the flanking sequences of 125 856, 203 161 and 375 214 mono- to hexanucleotide and compound microsatellites identified from the assembled genomic sequences of B. rapa, B. oleracea and B. napus, respectively (Table 3). The primer pairs could not be designed for the remaining microsatellites, mostly due to the constraint of obtaining sufficient flanking sequences from either side of the identified microsatellites. Similar observations have also been observed in other genome-wide microsatellite marker development studies in plants, such as rice,35 black cottonwood,36 cucumber,37Brachypodim distachyon38 and foxtail millet.39 The frequencies of newly developed genome-wide SSR markers of B. rapa, B. oleracea and B. napus were 408.2, 343.8 and 356.2 per Mb or one every 2.45, 2.91 and 2.81 kb, respectively. Most of the genome-wide SSR markers of B. rapa (91.9%) and B. oleracea (75.4%) were developed from the mapped sequence scaffolds and thus have determined physical positions. The physical positions of the newly developed genome-wide SSR markers of B. napus will be determined soon because the anchoring of its sequence scaffolds will be completed after several months (our unpublished data). Number (%) of newly developed genome-wide SSR markers that generated certain numbers (from 0 to >3) of in silico PCR products in the assembled genomic sequences of B. rapa, B. oleracea and B. napus, respectivelyNumber (%) of newly developed genome-wide SSR markers that generated certain numbers (from 0 to >3) of in silico PCR products in the assembled genomic sequences of B. rapa, B. oleracea and B. napus, respectivelyBecause of the polyploidy nature of Brassica,45 SSR markers usually amplify multiple fragments from homologous DNA sequences, which could complicate or cause errors in the genotype scoring. Therefore, all of the newly developed genome-wide SSR markers were subjected to in silico PCR analysis in the assembled genomic sequences of B. rapa, B. oleracea and B. napus, and the numbers of in silico PCR product(s) were recorded and summarized (Table 3). For the 115 869 SSR markers developed from B. rapa, 47 (0.0%), 92 517 (79.8%), 10 977 (9.5%), 3309 (2.9%) and 9019 (7.8%) markers generated 0, 1, 2, 3 and >3 in silico PCR product(s), respectively, from the assembled genomic sequences of B. rapa; 59 201 (51.1%), 40 493 (34.9%), 6370 (5.5%), 2100 (1.8%) and 7705 (6.6%) markers generated 0, 1, 2, 3 and >3 in silico PCR product(s), respectively, from the assembled genomic sequences of B. oleracea and 12 765 (11.0%), 36 030 (31.1%), 38 162 (32.9%), 10 666 (9.2%) and 18 246 (15.7%) markers generated 0, 1, 2, 3 and >3 in silico PCR product(s), respectively, from the assembled genomic sequences of B. napus. For the 185 662 SSR markers developed from B. oleracea, 20 (0.0%), 121 169 (65.3%), 18 299 (9.9%), 7140 (3.8%) and 39 034 (21.0%) markers generated 0, 1, 2, 3 and >3 in silico PCR product(s), respectively, from the assembled genomic sequences of B. oleracea; 110 784 (59.7%), 48 423 (26.1%), 8486 (4.6%), 3349 (1.8%) and 14 620 (7.9%) markers generated 0, 1, 2, 3 and >3 in silico PCR product(s), respectively, from the assembled genomic sequences of B. rapa and 13 192 (7.1%), 54 749 (29.5%), 55 160 (29.7%), 14 156 (7.6%) and 48 405 (26.1%) markers generated 0, 1, 2, 3 and >3 in silico PCR product(s), respectively, from the assembled genomic sequences of B. napus. For the 356 522 SSR markers developed from B. napus, 0 (0.0%), 93 084 (26.1%), 110 106 (30.9%), 44 138 (12.4%) and 109 194 (30.6%) markers generated 0, 1, 2, 3 and >3 in silico PCR product(s), respectively, from the assembled genomic sequences of B. napus; 157 473 (44.2%), 138 202 (38.8%), 20 604 (5.8%), 7758 (2.2%) and 32 485 (9.1%) markers generated 0, 1, 2, 3 and >3 in silico PCR product(s), respectively, from the assembled genomic sequences of B. rapa and 106 706 (29.9%), 153 690 (43.1%), 24 601 (6.9%), 10 264 (2.9%) and 61 261 (17.2%) markers generated 0, 1, 2, 3 and >3 in silico PCR product(s), respectively, from the assembled genomic sequences of B. oleracea. Interestingly, the SSR markers that generated tens to thousands of in silico PCR products were mostly associated with the annotated TEs, especially the retrotransposons.We also determined the relationship between the physical positions of the newly developed genome-wide SSR markers and the previously developed publicly available Brassica SSR markers as well as the annotated genome components (mainly as genes and TEs) (Supplementary Table S7). Of the 115 869 SSR markers developed from B. rapa, 5991 (5.2%), 22 596 (19.5%) and 32 648 (28.2%) were involved in public Brassica SSR markers, genes and TEs, respectively. Of the 185 662 SSR markers developed from B. oleracea, 12 322 (6.6%), 33 228 (17.9%) and 73 487 (39.6%) were involved in public Brassica SSR markers, genes and TEs, respectively. Of the 356 522 SSR markers developed from B. napus, 23 928 (6.7%), 58 952 (16.5%) and 161 090 (45.2%) were involved in public Brassica SSR markers, genes and TEs, respectively. Interestingly, the TE-associated SSR markers were rarely involved in the annotated genes and mostly generated tens to thousands of in silico PCR products.To facilitate the access and effective utilization of the Brassica SSR markers, we constructed an integrative database (http://oilcrops.info/SSRdb), which has search tools to obtain much useful information for the newly developed genome-wide SSR markers from the sequenced Brassica species and the previously developed publicly available Brassica SSR markers (Fig. 4). For the previously developed publicly available Brassica SSR markers, this information includes the primer-pair sequences, microsatellite repeat, source, reference and number of in silico PCR product(s) in the assembled genomic sequences of the sequenced Brassica species (currently only for B. rapa, B. oleracea and B. napus). For the newly developed genome-wide SSR markers from the sequenced Brassica species, this information includes the following: (i) the sequence, type, length and physical position of microsatellite repeat; (ii) the serial number, sequences, annealing temperatures, lengths and expected product size of primer pair; (iii) the number of in silico PCR product(s) in the assembled genomic sequences of the sequenced Brassica species (currently only for B. rapa, B. oleracea and B. napus) and (iv) the positional relationship with the previously developed publicly available Brassica SSR markers and the annotated genome components (mainly genes and TEs). In addition, this database also provides useful analysis tools (such as BLAST, e-PCR, Primer3 and ExtractSeq) and web links to other databases (e.g. http://brassicadb.org/brad/) and websites (e.g. http://www.brassica.info/) related to Brassica research. More importantly, this SSR marker database for Brassica will update as the number of sequenced Brassica species increases. Brassica SSR marker database homepage (A) and search results pages (B–D). This database provides three search approaches: by the name of the previously developed publicly available Brassica SSR markers (e.g. BN12A), by the serial number of the SSR markers (e.g. BnScaffold000001_12) and by the start to end positions on the chromosome/scaffold (e.g. BnScaffold000001:20–20 000 bp). This database also provides many useful tools, such as e-PCR, BLAST and primer3.

Experimental evaluation of the newly developed genome-wide SSR markersA total of 3974 newly developed SSR markers from B. rapa and B. oleracea were tested for amplification in the six representative B. napus cultivars/inbred lines (Table 4). Of these, 3880 SSR markers (97.6%) successfully amplified at least one clear fragment, while the remaining 94 (2.4%) failed to amplify, which could be due to the differences between the genome sequences of B. napus and its two progenitors, B. rapa and B. oleracea.46,47 The amplification rate (97.6%) of the tested SSR markers in the six B. napus cultivars/inbred lines was slightly or much higher than the corresponding rates (94.3/82.9, 89.2 and 77.4%, respectively) for the previously developed SSR markers from GSSs (mainly BESs)/unique transcripts of B. napus,24,30 BACs of B. rapa20 and WGSs of B. oleracea,26 which suggests that there is a high quality in the SSR markers that were developed from the assembled genomic sequences. The amplification rate of the tested SSR markers showed small variations for different motif lengths, motif repeat numbers and repeat lengths (i.e. motif length × motif repeat number), which was consistent with the previous reports in Brassica20,24,26 and rice.35 For the majority of the tested SSR markers, the numbers of fragment(s) amplified from the six representative B. napus cultivars/inbred lines were equal or very close to those of in silico PCR product(s) in the assembled genomic sequences of B. napus (Supplementary Table S8). In particular, most (1602 of 1813; 88.4%) of the tested SSR markers that generated one in silico PCR product in the assembled genomic sequences of B. napus also amplified only a single clear fragment from the six representative B. napus cultivars/inbred lines. A considerable proportion (1099 of 3880; 28.3%) of the successfully amplified SSR markers also produced weak fragment(s), which could correspond to non-specific amplification(s) from homologous DNA sequences. Amplification and polymorphism rate of the tested SSR markers and their association with the number of amplified fragment(s), the motif length, the motif repeat number and the repeat lengthAmplification and polymorphism rate of the tested SSR markers and their association with the number of amplified fragment(s), the motif length, the motif repeat number and the repeat lengthThe majority (2765 of 3880; 71.3%) of the successfully amplified SSR markers was polymorphic across the six representative B. napus cultivars/inbred lines (Table 4). The polymorphism rate of the tested SSR markers was almost equal to or slightly higher than the corresponding rates (73.4/65.9, 57.9, 69.5%) for the previously developed SSR markers from GSSs (mainly BESs)/unique transcripts of B. napus,24,30 BACs of B. rapa20 and WGSs of B. oleracea.26 Obviously, the polymorphism rate of the tested SSR markers increased (from 67.5% to 85.9%) as the number of amplified bands increased (from 1 to >3). The polymorphism rate of the tested SSR markers decreased slightly from the mono- to tetranucleotide repeats, while it increased quickly from the penta- to hexanucleotide repeats. This inconsistency of the relationship between the SSR marker polymorphism level and the motif length was also observed frequently in the previous SSR marker evaluation experiments, such as in the tests of the 627 and 1000 SSR markers from the GSSs (mainly BESs) and unique transcripts, respectively, of B. napus,24,30 the 890 SSR markers from the BACs of B. rapa,20 the 1398 SSR markers from the WGSs of B. oleracea26 and the 1009 SSR markers from the assembled genomic sequences of cucumber.37 This type of inconsistency could be attributable to the observation that only a small number of SSR markers of the specific (usually long) motif length(s) have been used to investigate this relationship in all of the above-mentioned studies (e.g. only 21 and 12 penta- and hexanucleotide repeat SSR markers were tested in the current investigation), which worthwhile to develop more SSR markers with long motifs to further investigate the relationship between the SSR marker polymorphism level and the motif length. The polymorphism rate of the tested SSR markers was highly positively correlated with both the motif repeat number and the repeat length (r = 0.74 and 0.86, respectively), which was basically consistent with the previous reports in Brassica24,30 and other plant species, including cucumber37 and carrot.48 Both correlation coefficients in the current investigation were much higher than or equal to the corresponding values (0.21 and 0.41; 0.74 and _) that were estimated with the 627 SSR markers from the GSSs (mainly BESs) of B. napus24 or the 1009 SSR markers from the assembled genomic sequences of cucumber,37 respectively. Strikingly, the tested SSR markers that were designed from compound repeats were almost all (80 of 82; 97.6%) polymorphic across the six representative B. napus cultivars/inbred lines (Supplementary Table S8).Because the 1055 and 2919 tested SSR markers were developed from the sequence scaffolds of B. rapa and B. oleracea, respectively, they were thus designated as ‘BrSF’ and ‘BoSF’. To facilitate the effective utilization of these tested newly developed BrSF and BoSF SSR markers, the following useful information was provided (Supplementary Table S8): (i) the type, length, position and sequence of the microsatellite repeat; (ii) the name, sequences, annealing temperatures and expected product size of the primer pair; (iii) the number of in silico PCR product(s) in the assembled genomic sequences of the sequenced Brassica species (currently for B. rapa, B. oleracea and B. napus) and (iv) the polymorphism survey and number of fragment(s) amplified in six representative B. napus cultivars/inbred lines.4. Discussion4.1. The pattern of microsatellite distribution is likely conservative in BrassicaIn the current study, almost all of the important characteristics of microsatellite distribution in the assembled genomic sequences of the three recently sequenced Brassica crop species have been analysed and compared. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first report on the genome-wide analysis and comparison of the pattern of microsatellite distribution across the different species within the same genus in plants.First, the frequencies of microsatellites in the assembled genomic sequences of B. rapa (496.8 per Mb), B. oleracea (424.8 per Mb) and B. napus (420.6 per Mb) were similar, and all were higher than almost all of the previous estimations.20,21,24,26,42 The slightly higher frequency of microsatellites in B. rapa than in both B. oleracea and B. napus is likely attributable to the more concentrated distribution and lower content of TEs in the assembled genomic sequences of B. rapa than in B. oleracea and B. napus (Fig. 3) because the frequencies (285.5, 272.0 and 285.4 per Mb) of microsatellites in the coding DNA sequences of the three species are almost equal.49 Secondly, in accordance with the high correlation between these variables (Supplementary Table S1), the distributions with respect to the motif length, type and repeat number of microsatellites in the assembled genomic sequences of the three Brassica species were almost identical (Fig. 1; Supplementary Table S2). More specifically, both the dominant/major and absent/scarce mono- to hexanucleotide motifs in the assembled genomic sequences of the three Brassica species were mostly identical (Table 1; Supplementary Table S3). Interestingly, the dominant/major motifs were all A/T rich, while the absent/scarce motifs were mostly C/G rich, which corresponded well to the much higher A/T than C/G content in the analysed sequences. Thirdly, the repeat numbers of the corresponding repeats or motifs for the three Brassica species were mostly similar (Table 1; Supplementary Table S4). Fourthly, the total repeat length (=microsatellite number × motif length × motif repeat number) proportions of the corresponding repeats or motifs of microsatellites in the assembled genomic sequences of the three Brassica species were also mostly similar (Table 1; Supplementary Table S5). In addition, the genomic distributions of microsatellites in the assembled pseudochromosomes of B. rapa and B. oleracea were generally similar (Fig. 3).In conclusion, almost all of the analysed important characteristics of microsatellite distribution in the assembled genomic sequences of the three sequenced Brassica crop species were highly similar or almost identical, which suggests that the pattern of microsatellite distribution is likely conservative in Brassica. This circumstance is understandable because B. napus (AACC, 2n = 38) originated from the chromosome doubling after the very recent (˜0.01 MYA) natural hybridization between B. rapa (AA, 2n = 20) and B. oleracea (CC, 2n = 18),11 which diverged from a common ancestor only ˜5 MYA.504.2. Usefulness of the newly developed genome-wide Brassica SSR markersIn the current study, a total of 115 869, 185 662 and 356 522 SSR markers were successfully developed from the assembled genomic sequences of B. rapa, B. oleracea and B. napus, respectively (Table 3), with the frequencies of 408.2, 343.8 and 356.2 per Mb or one every 2.45, 2.91 and 2.81 kb. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first report on genome-wide SSR marker development in Brassica. Only a small proportion of the newly developed genome-wide SSR markers (5.2, 6.6 and 6.7% for B. rapa, B. oleracea and B. napus, respectively) were involved in the previously developed publicly available Brassica SSR markers (Supplementary Table S7), which suggests that most of the newly developed genome-wide SSR markers should represent the new SSR markers. The huge-number and high-frequency genome-wide SSR markers developed from the sequenced Brassica species in this study could be useful for many studies that require large-number and/or high-density molecular markers, such as high-density linkage map construction, gene/QTL fine mapping and genome-wide/regional association mapping.The acute physical positions of the majority of the newly developed genome-wide SSR markers of the sequenced Brassica species have been determined (http://oilcrops.info/SSRdb) based on the mapped sequence scaffolds (Supplementary Table S6) from which they are designed. In fact, the physical positions of most of the previously developed publicly available Brassica SSR markers have also been determined by in silico mapping against the pseudochromosomes of these sequenced Brassica species (http://oilcrops.info/SSRdb). The high-density SSR marker-based physical maps constructed in this study could be useful for the rapid selection of genome-wide SSR markers that are well distributed over these chromosomes for various genotyping applications.Because of the polyploidy nature of Brassica,45 the developed SSR markers usually amplify multiple fragments from the homologous DNA sequences, as revealed in the current (Supplementary Table S8) and previous12–14,22,24,26,27,29,30,42,51 studies in Brassica. This could complicate or cause errors in the genotype scoring due to the reciprocal overlapping and uncertain allelism of these fragments.33 However, only a small proportion of the previously developed publicly available Brassica SSR markers have been alleged to be single locus.33. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop more single-locus SSR markers to facilitate their application in Brassica. Previously, the single-locus SSR markers were developed by practical PCR amplification in a panel of inbred lines,33 which was time consuming, labour intensive, high cost and, thus, inefficient. In the current study, through the highly efficient in silico PCR analysis, a large number of newly developed genome-wide SSR markers (92 517, 121 169 and 93 084 for B. rapa, B. oleracea and B. napus, respectively) were found to generate one in silico PCR product in the assembled genomic sequences of the three sequenced Brassica species (Table 3). In addition, thousands of previously developed publicly available Brassica SSR markers were also found to generate one in silico PCR product in the assembled genomic sequences of these Brassica species (http://oilcrops.info/SSRdb). More importantly, most (88.4%) of the tested SSR markers, that generated one in silico PCR product in the assembled genomic sequences of B. napus, also amplified a single clear fragment in the six representative B. napus cultivars/inbred lines (Supplementary Table S8). These results suggest that SSR markers that generate one in silico PCR product should be the putative single-locus markers and could be especially useful. Interestingly, the proportion (27.9%) of the newly developed genome-wide Brassica SSR markers (Table 3), which generated one in silico PCR product in the assembled genomic sequences of B. napus, was close to the corresponding proportion (33.8%) of the previously developed 9858 SSR marker from the GSSs/unique transcripts of B. napus, the BACs of B. rapa and the GSSs of B. oleracea,33 which amplified a single clear fragment in six B. napus inbred lines.Also known as ‘functional’ markers,52 genic SSR markers are developed from genes and have a high transferability across related species.52 Although several studies have been conducted to develop genic SSR markers from the ESTs/unique transcripts of B. rapa,29,31,32B. oleracea31 and B. napus,30–32 the total number (<5000) of publicly available genic SSR markers has remained limited in Brassica (http://oilcrops.info/SSRdb). In the current study, a large number of newly developed genome-wide SSR markers (32 648, 33 228 and 58 952 for B. rapa, B. oleracea and B. napus, respectively) were involved in the annotated genes (Supplementary Table S7) and thus belonged to the genic SSR markers. Of these, only a small proportion (7.2, 6.1, 6.7% for B. rapa, B. oleracea and B. napus, respectively) was involved in the previously developed publicly available Brassica SSR markers (http://oilcrops.info/SSRdb). This finding suggests that most of these newly developed Brassica genic SSR markers could represent the new ‘functional’ markers, which should be highly useful in evolutionary studies,29 comparative mapping,32 candidate gene association mapping53 and molecular breeding.For the high transferability of SSR markers across the cultivated and wild Brassica species,27,33,54,55 the developed genome-wide SSR markers from B. rapa (AA, 2n = 20), B. oleracea (CC, 2n = 18) and B. napus (AACC, 2n = 38) should also be useful for B. nigra (BB, 2n = 16), B. juncea (AABB, 2n = 36), B. carinata (BBCC, 2n = 34) and other Brassica species. In addition, according to the previous marker transferability research,15,16,22,25 a considerable proportion of the newly developed genome-wide Brassica SSR markers (especially the genic SSR markers) should also be useful for the species that belong to other genera and tribes within the Brassicaceae family.More importantly, we also constructed an integrative SSR marker database for Brassica (http://oilcrops.info/SSRdb), which not only provides useful information on the newly developed genome-wide SSR markers from the sequenced Brassica species (currently only for B. rapa, B. oleracea and B. napus) but is also integrated with the previously developed publicly available Brassica SSR markers and the annotated genome components (mainly as genes and TEs). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive SSR marker database for Brassica until now, and it should be a significant contribution to the Brassica research community.4.3. Implications for SSR marker developmentThe numbers of clear fragment(s) amplified in the six representative B. napus cultivars/inbred lines for the 3974 tested SSR markers were usually equal or close to the numbers of in silico PCR product(s) in the assembled genomic sequences of B. napus (Supplementary Table S8). This finding suggests that the number of products amplified by SSR markers can be relatively accurately estimated by in silico PCR, which was in accordance with the previous reports in plants such as rice56 and Brachypodium.38 Therefore, the target microsatellite should be subjected to BLAST/in silico PCR analysis to estimate its copy number before SSR marker development, especially for the polyploidy species. In addition, most (88.4%) of the tested SSR markers that generate one in silico PCR product were also confirmed by practical PCR analysis (Supplementary Table S8). Therefore, the in silico identified single/low copy microsatellites should be preferential for marker development.Replication slippage and recombination are currently two major mechanisms that are responsible for microsatellite expansion or contraction.2,3,5,57 Because of the small numbers of the tested SSR markers of specific motif length(s), the relationship between the SSR marker polymorphism level and the motif length was usually inconsistent in both the current (Table 4) and previous20,24,26,30,37 studies. However, the general trend was similar: the SSR marker polymorphism level tended to decrease as the motif length increased. This relationship is understandable because shorter motifs allow more possible replication slippage events per unit length of DNA.58,59 In addition, the SSR marker polymorphism level was positively correlated with both the motif repeat number and the repeat length in both the current (r = 0.74 and 0.86, respectively) and previous37,47,48,60 studies. More importantly, the tested compound SSR markers were almost all (97.6%) polymorphic. These relationships are also understandable because more motifs, larger motif repeat number and longer repeat length give more opportunity for replication slippage.2 Therefore, microsatellites with a shorter motif length, larger motif repeat number, longer repeat length and especially the compound repeat should be preferential for marker development.It should be noted that a considerable proportion (Supplementary Table S7) of the newly developed genome-wide SSR markers from the sequenced Brassica species were involved in the so-called ‘mobile DNA sequences’ TEs61 and should thus be unstable. In addition, the SSR markers that are associated with TEs (especially retrotransposons) mostly generated tens to thousands of in silico PCR products (http://oilcrops.info/SSRdb). Therefore, caution should be observed with respect to marker development based on microsatellites that are associated with TEs (especially retrotransposons).Supplementary DataSupplementary Data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by the National Science and Technology Supporting Program (2010BAD01B02), the National Rapeseed Industry Technology System (CARS-13) and the Hubei Agricultural Science and Technology Innovation Center of China.Supplementary data"

IntroductionHigh salinity is a severe and increasing constraint on the global crop production. Most of our major crops are highly susceptible to salinity, and there is an urgent need to address this problem. Salinity tolerance is a complex multigenic trait, which depends on a range of physiological processes. The salinity stress response has been studied in model crop plant rice,1–4 which represents a glycophyte plant and does not possess the capability to tolerate high salinity. The existence of wild halophytic species, which can grow not only in saline but also in submergence prone habitats, has been reported.5,6 These wild species may prove to be an important gene reservoir for improving salinity tolerance in crop plants via genetic engineering approaches.5–8Porteresia coarctata (Oryza coarctata) is a wild halophyte, which shows considerable adaptation to high salinity (20–40 dS m-1) and can also tolerate complete submergence in saline water for a long period.9Porteresia grows in abundance near coastal areas, where the vegetation is inundated twice a day with highly saline water. Although many salinity- and submergence-tolerant rice cultivars have also been identified,10–12 they seem to be much less tolerant than Porteresia. It is a close wild relative of rice and can serve as an important source of genes related to salinity and submergence tolerance.8,13 Some novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying salinity tolerance have been obtained from transcriptome and genome analyses of close halophyte relatives of Arabidopsis, Thellungiella halophila and T. parvula.14–16 A few studies have demonstrated that engineering of some genes from Porteresia, such as those involved in inositol metabolic pathway, can confer salinity tolerance in cultivated rice.17,18 However, only a few genes have been isolated from Porteresia so far. Furthermore, the effect of submergence stress and its combined effect with salinity have hardly been analysed.5 The discovery of more genes and metabolic pathways in wild species like Porteresia can provide a better strategy to impart salinity tolerance in cultivated rice.The availability of next-generation sequencing technologies provides a high-throughput, rapid and cost-effective means to sequence and characterize the transcriptome of non-model and wild species as well.19–21 In this study, we sequenced the transcriptome of Porteresia under different conditions using Illumina technology. The transcriptome assembly was generated to reveal the first picture of its gene content. We also analysed gene expression under salinity and submergence conditions and identified the genes and metabolic pathways involved in these stress responses. The data presented here will provide a very useful resource to engineer salinity and submergence tolerance stress in crop plant rice.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materialPorteresia coarctata (Roxb) Tateoka plants were collected from saline river banks (Matla) of the Sunderbans in the coastal region of Bay of Bengal, India. The plants were brought to the laboratory along with soil and water. The plants were washed carefully to remove soil from the leaves and roots. The plants were given different treatments, including control (RO water, control), low salinity (450 mM NaCl, salt450), high salinity (700 mM NaCl solution, salt700), submergence (fully submerged in RO water, submergence) and submergence in low salinity (fully submerged in 450 mM NaCl, salt + submergence). The plants were harvested in three biological replicates 12 h after the treatment.2.2. RNA isolation and sequencingTotal RNA was isolated from each tissue sample (control, salt450, salt700, submergence and salt + submergence) using TRI reagent (Sigma Life Science, USA). The quantity and quality of RNA samples were checked using Nanodrop (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Agilent Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Singapore). Equal amounts of total RNA from three biological replicates were pooled for all the five treated samples before library preparation. Sequencing of all the five samples was performed by the commercial service provider, Genotypic Technology Pvt. Ltd, Bangalore, India, each in one lane using an Illumina Genome Analyzer II to generate 100 base long paired-end reads. The raw data obtained were filtered through the standard Illumina pipeline. The filtered Fastq files were further subjected to more stringent quality control using the NGS QC Toolkit (v2.3) to remove the low-quality reads and reads containing adaptor/primer contamination.22 The high-quality filtered reads were used for further downstream processing. The entire sequence data generated in this study are available in the Gene Expression Omnibus database under the accession number GSE44913. The non-redundant Illumina reads were filtered using the CDHIT program (http://weizhong-lab.ucsd.edu/cd-hit/).2.3. Transcriptome assemblyDe novo transcriptome assembly was performed using various tools, including Velvet (v1.2.01), Oases (v0.2.04), ABySS (v1.2.6), Trinity (vr2012-05-18) and CLC Genomics Workbench (v4.7.2). Various parameters, including k-mer length, insert length and expected coverage, were optimized to obtain best assembly as described previously.23 Reference-based assembly was performed using the CLC Genomics Workbench using default parameters, and assembled consensus sequences were exported into a fasta file. The annotated cDNA sequences of japonica rice (Os-Nipponbare-Reference-IRGSP-1.0)24 available at Rice Genome Annotation Project (MSUv7.0; http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/) were used as a reference. Merged assembly was performed using the TGICL program (v2.0), with minimum overlap length of 40 and minimum percentage identity of 90 for overlaps. The quality of assemblies generated was assessed using the perl scripts given in the NGS QC Toolkit.2.4. Functional annotationBLASTX searches against rice proteome, UniRef90, UniRef100 and NCBI non-redundant nucleotide databases, were performed to assign a putative function to each Porteresia transcript. GOSlim terms to each transcript were assigned on the basis of their best significant match (E-value = 1e-10) rice protein to provide a broad overview of their function. An E-value cut-off of 1e-10 was used to identify orthologs between Porteresia and rice. The transcription factor (TF) encoding Porteresia transcripts were identified based on the hidden Markov model profile search of conserved domain present in each TF family as described previously.23 The statistical significance of the difference in the number of members between Porteresia and rice in each TF family was calculated via Fisher's exact test.2.5. Read mapping and gene expression analysisTo estimate the gene expression, all the high-quality reads from each condition were aligned on the transcriptome assembly using the RNA-Seq Analysis utility of CLC Genomics Workbench. A maximum of two mismatches were allowed for the alignments. The read counts for each tissue sample were normalized by calculating the read per kilobase per million for each transcript. The DESeq software (v1.10.1)25 was used for differential gene expression analysis. DESeq provides a simple and computationally faster method for quantitative measurement of gene expression based on the negative binomial distribution with variance and mean linked by local regression.25 We calculated the size factor for each sample for normalization of read count data using DESeq. A P-value cut-off of =0.05 and at least two-fold change was used to identify differentially expressed genes. Heatmaps showing expression profiles (log2 fold change) were generated using the MultiExperiment Viewer (MeV, v4.8). K-means clustering was performed using Euclidean distance matrix with 1000 iterations using MeV. Hierarchical clustering was performed using Euclidean distance matrix with a complete linkage rule using MeV.2.6. Gene ontology and pathway enrichment analysisThe best Arabidopsis hit corresponding to each Porteresia transcript was identified using BLAST search to study gene ontology (GO) enrichment. GO enrichment of different sets of differentially expressed genes was performed using the BiNGO tool.26 The metabolic pathway data available in the RiceCyc database of Gramene27 were analysed to identify the enriched metabolic pathways in various gene sets. Both the GO and pathway enrichment analyses were performed at P-value cut-off of =0.05 after applying Benjamini-Hochberg correction.2.7. Real-time PCR analysisFor real-time PCR analysis, gene-specific primers were designed using the Primer Express (v3.0) software (Applied Biosystems, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The primer sequences used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table S1. Real-time PCRs were performed as described.28 The expression of most suitable internal control gene for rice, UBQ5,29 in each sample was used for normalization. At least three independent biological replicates with three technical replicates of each biological replicates for each tissue sample were used for the analysis. The correlation between expression profiles of selected genes obtained from real-time PCR and RNA-seq data analyses was determined using MS Excel.3. Results3.1. Transcriptome sequencingTo generate the transcriptome of Porteresia, we collected tissue samples from plants kept in water (control) and those subjected to salinity and submerged conditions. For salinity stress, we kept the plants in 450 mM (salt450) and 700 mM (salt700) sodium chloride solutions and for submergence stress, plants were kept completely submerged in water (submergence) and 450 mM sodium chloride solution (salt + submergence) and collected the tissues after 12 h of treatment. Porteresia is a halophyte, which grows naturally in coastal region, where plants experience lunar tide and are exposed to submergence in saline sea water every 12 h. Therefore, to obtain maximum representation of genes involved in signalling and adaptation response under salinity and submergence stress, we selected time point of 12 h for the analysis in our study. The RNA-seq libraries were constructed and sequenced using an Illumina sequencing platform. We generated a total of more than 422 million reads from above five samples. After quality filtering, about 375 million high-quality reads (ranging from about 65 to 90 million reads for each sample) were obtained (Table 1). The average Phred quality score was at least 30 at each base position for filtered reads, indicating high quality of filtered reads (Supplementary Fig. S1). Summary of sequencing data generated and mapping to Porteresia transcriptomeaNumber of high-quality reads mapped using CLC Genomics workbench.Summary of sequencing data generated and mapping to Porteresia transcriptomeaNumber of high-quality reads mapped using CLC Genomics workbench.3.2. Transcriptome assembly optimizationTo generate the optimal assembly of the Porteresia transcriptome, first, we performed de novo assembly using all the high-quality reads (374 759 624) and non-redundant reads (194 316 505) after removing duplicate reads from all the five samples. We used Velvet, Oases, ABySS, Trinity and CLC Genomics Workbench softwares to perform de novo assembly. The de novo assembly was generated at different k-mer lengths using these softwares. From each software, the best assembly output was selected based on the statistics (average and N50 contig lengths) and similarity with rice proteome (Supplementary Table S2). Among the various softwares, Oases generated the best assembly with largest average and N50 lengths at k-mer length of 59 for both datasets (Supplementary Table S2). However, only 34% and 29% rice proteins showed a significant hit with the assemblies generated from whole and non-redundant datasets, respectively. The assembly output from other softwares also exhibited very low similarity to rice proteins. As Porteresia is a wild relative of rice, higher similarity to rice proteins was expected. These results suggested that the output of de novo assembly was not optimal.Therefore, we followed a combined approach of both reference-based and de novo assemblies to generate the transcriptome of Porteresia. In the first step, we performed reference-based assembly using the CLC Genomics Workbench. We used all the reads from each sample to generate a consensus assembly (Supplementary Table S3). The average and N50 lengths of reference assembly were much higher when compared with de novo assemblies. The consensus assembly from all the five samples generated a total of 36 966 contigs with the average length of 1265 bp and N50 length of 1761 bp (Supplementary Table S3). This assembly utilized ~81% of the total reads. To identify the novel genes in Porteresia, as a second step, we performed de novo assembly of unused reads in the first step of reference-based assembly. We used different softwares (CLC, Trinity, ABySS, Velvet and Oases) and parameters to select the best assembly. Oases generated the best assembly with largest average (544 bp) and N50 (719 bp) contig lengths. However, the number of consensus sequences (161 160) generated was quite large. As a last step, we generated a merged assembly of the contigs generated in primary assemblies of two steps via TGICL program. Our earlier studies have shown that TGICL generates optimal merged assembly from the contigs of primary assemblies.23,30 This assembly resulted in a total of 152 367 (39 203 contigs and 113 164 singletons) unique sequences (referred as contigs) of at least 200 bp in length (Table 2). The average and N50 lengths of contigs were 794 and 1249 bp, respectively. The mapping of all the high-quality reads suggested that >95% of reads were used in the final merged assembly and average read depth of each contig was 2352.

Functional annotation of Porteresia transcriptomeThe unique set of transcripts generated above were designated as P. coarctata tentative consensus (PcTC) transcripts and assigned unique identifier number from PcTC000001 to PcTC152367. The whole transcriptome sequence is available at Porteresia Transcriptome Sequence web page (http://nipgr.res.in/mjain.html?Page=porteresia). The total transcriptome assembly size was ~121 Mb. About 48% of all the transcripts were longer than 500 bp and >24% transcripts were larger than 1000 bp (Supplementary Fig. S2). Most of the smaller transcripts were represented by the singletons (Supplementary Fig. S2). Many of these are expected to merge into larger transcripts, once more sequence data of larger read length become available. The average GC content and distribution of Porteresia transcripts were significantly different than that of rice (Supplementary Fig. S3), indicating substantial differences between rice and Porteresia genomes. Furthermore, to explore the putative function, we assigned gene description to each Porteresia transcript corresponding to the ortholog rice proteins and proteins in other databases. A gene description term could be assigned to ~36% of Porteresia transcripts. The lower percentage of annotated transcripts was because most of the smaller transcripts generated in the de novo assembly did not show significant similarity with known proteins in various databases and presumably represent species-specific genes.Based on their similarity with rice genes, Porteresia transcripts were assigned GOSlim terms under biological process, molecular function and cellular component categories. Among the biological process terms, biosynthetic process (20%) was most represented followed by nucleic acid metabolic process (15.3%) and response to stress (14.5%) (Fig. 1A). A high representation of response to stress category might contribute to the high salinity and submergence tolerance phenotype of Porteresia. The largest number of transcripts belonged to catalytic activity (16.1%), protein binding (15.1%) and hydrolase activity (12.3%) among the molecular function GOSlim terms. Among the cellular component terms, the transcripts related to membrane (18.5%) and plastid (17%) were the largest in number (Fig. 1A). We further analysed the Porteresia transcriptome to identify the TF-encoding genes. A total of 2749 transcripts encoding for TFs were identified. Among the 85 families represented in these transcripts, the MYB-domain (197) family TFs were most abundant followed by bHLH (150)- and NAC (147)-domain TFs (Fig. 1B). Although the total number of TFs was slightly higher in Porteresia (2749) than in rice (2452), we found significant differences in their distribution in certain families. Notably, the number of TFs predicted in Porteresia for bromodomain, zinc-finger CCHC and SNF2 families were significantly higher than rice. Likewise, the number of predicted TFs in AP2-EREBP, GRAS, MADS, TCP, TRAF and ZF-HD families were significantly lesser in Porteresia than in rice (Fig. 1B). These results suggest significant differences in the transcriptional machinery of the two species and might contribute to stress adaptation phenotype in Porteresia.

Differential gene expression analysisIn addition to the transcriptome construction, RNA-seq provides an opportunity to measure gene expression at the whole-genome level.31,32 To investigate the differential gene expression under different conditions, we mapped the reads from each sample on the Porteresia transcriptome. A total of 87–88% of the high-quality Illumina reads were mapped to the Porteresia transcripts (referred as genes hereafter) from each sample (Table 1). Differential gene expression analysis was performed using the DESeq software to identify the genes with altered expression under different conditions. A total of 15 158 genes exhibited differential expression under at least one stress condition analysed (Supplementary Table S4). The largest number of genes was differentially expressed in the plants subjected to submergence stress (5864) followed by both salinity and submergence stresses together (5787) (Fig. 2A). A total of 4841 and 4243 genes exhibited differential expression under low salinity (salt450) and high salinity (salt700) stress conditions, respectively. Under salinity stress, a larger number of genes were up-regulated (3020 under salt450 and 2553 under salt700) when compared with down-regulated genes (1821 under salt450 and 1690 under salt700). However, in contrast, the larger number of genes was down-regulated under submergence stress alone (3712) and salinity and submergence stresses together (3952) when compared with up-regulated genes (2152 for submergence and 1835 for salt + submergence) (Fig. 2A). Differential gene expression under different stress conditions.

(B) Venn diagram showing the number of genes differentially expressed under specific or different stress conditions.Furthermore, we identified genes showing overlapping or specific response to different stress conditions as depicted in Fig. 2B. Interestingly, a larger fraction of genes (69.5%) exhibited response to a specific stress condition. Other 4625 (30.5%) genes were responsive to more than one stress conditions. The largest number of genes (2555) was commonly regulated by submergence and salt + submergence stresses. Notably, most of them (99.6%) exhibited similar response (681 up-regulated and 1865 down-regulated) under both conditions. However, among the 790 genes commonly regulated by both high salinity and submergence stresses, most (78.2%) exhibited opposite responses (473 up-regulated under high salinity but down-regulated under submergence stress and 145 down-regulated under high salinity but up-regulated under submergence stress). Interestingly, however, 84% of the 757 genes commonly regulated by low salinity and submergence stresses exhibited similar response. Only 957 genes exhibited differential expression under both low and high salinity conditions, but most of them (94.6%) were regulated in the same direction. A very small fraction of genes (116) were differentially regulated under all the stress conditions analysed. Furthermore, we performed K-means clustering analysis and generated 10 clusters with different gene expression patterns across different stress conditions analysed (Supplementary Fig. S4). Among the clusters generated, we identified four groups of genes with distinct gene expression patterns (Fig. 3). Group I genes were up-regulated under salinity and/or salt + submergence stress. Group II genes were down-regulated under submergence and salt + submergence stress. Group III genes were up-regulated under submergence and salt + submergence stress. Group IV genes were up-regulated under salinity stress. K-means clustering of expression profiles of genes differentially expressed under different stress conditions. The clustering was performed on log2 fold change for each gene under different stress conditions when compared with under control condition.

Stress response of transcription factor genesTFs are the regulatory proteins, which play a key role in stress responses. Remarkably, we detected the differential expression of at least 329 (~12%) TF-encoding genes under different stress conditions in Porteresia. A heatmap showing the differential expression of genes belonging to different TF families is shown in Fig. 4. At least one member of 55 TF families exhibited differential expression. Among the various families, the largest number (32) of NAC TF family genes was differentially expressed. The members of other TF families, including MYB/MYB-related (25), bZIP (25), bHLH (23), HSF (18) and WRKY (17), were also significantly represented in the differentially expressed genes. A total of 96, 118, 132 and 127 TF genes exhibited differential expression under low salinity, high salinity, submergence and salt + submergence stress conditions, respectively. Among the 118 TF genes differentially expressed under high salinity stress, 88 were up-regulated and 30 were down-regulated. The members of NAC, MYB/MYB-related and WRKY families were the most abundant among these genes. In contrast, among the 132 TF genes differentially expressed under submergence stress, 44 were up-regulated and 88 were down-regulated. The members of bHLH, bZIP, HSF, NAC and MYB/MYB-related families were most abundant among these genes. In addition, several zinc-finger TFs of different classes were also regulated under different stress conditions. The members of these TF families have been found to be regulated under salinity and submergence stresses in Arabidopsis, rice and halophytes.33–35 Altogether, these data suggest the extensive regulation of transcription under salinity and submergence stress.

Gene ontology and metabolic pathway enrichment analysis of stress-responsive genesTo investigate the major functional categories represented in the stress-responsive genes identified above, we performed GO enrichment analysis. Most evidently, besides response to stress, we found the GO terms associated with various metabolic processes, such as secondary metabolite (oxoacid, ketone, amino acid, oxylipin, flavonoid, phenylpropanoid and chorismate) biosynthesis and hormone (jasmonic acid, ethylene and abscisic acid, ABA) biosynthesis, were most enriched in the genes up-regulated under different stress conditions analysed (Fig. 5, Supplementary Fig. S5). In addition, the GO terms, photosynthesis, photorespiration, rRNA processing and transport were also found enriched in up-regulated genes. However, in the down-regulated genes under salinity stress, the GO terms associated with polysaccharide (glucan, carbohydrate and starch) metabolism were most significantly represented (Supplementary Figs S5 and S6). The genes with function in protein turn over (proteolysis, peptidase activity and proteasome assembly) were highly enriched under low salinity. Such genes have been found responsible for salinity stress adaptation in halophyte, T. halophila.33 Under submergence alone or along with salinity stress, the GO terms response to various stresses, response to ABA, generation of precursor metabolites and energy as well as rRNA metabolism were most enriched. The finding of up-regulation of genes associated with energy conservation via metabolism rearrangement to enhance ATP production and/or nullifying deleterious effects of oxygen radicals, reactive oxygen species and other toxic compounds under submergence has been reported earlier also.36,37 In addition, the GO terms, such as response to gibberellin stimulus, response to hydrogen per oxide and transport, were represented in the down-regulated genes under submergence stress (Supplementary Figs S5 and S6). The GO term, regulation of transcription, was also found enriched in the stress-responsive genes, which is consistent with differential expression of the large number of TF genes as described in previous section. Notably, we noticed the significant enrichment of cellular component GO term, cell wall, in the differentially expressed genes (Supplementary Fig. S7). The changes in transcript levels of a number of genes encoding cell wall-related proteins have been observed in halophyte, T. halophila, in response to abiotic stress conditions.35,38 Overall, the different groups of genes with distinct expression patterns were also found to be associated with similar GO terms (Supplementary Fig. S8). For instance, the GO terms, response to stress and hormones were enriched in Group II genes, whereas photosynthesis and secondary metabolite biosynthesis terms were most significant in Group III genes. Group IV genes were found enriched in tryptophan biosynthesis, cellular amino acid derivatives biosynthesis, response to jasmonic acid and cell death-related GO terms.

A colour version is available online.Many of the stress-responsive genes identified above encode for the enzymes involved in several metabolic pathways, which regulate diverse cellular processes. Therefore, we investigated the metabolic pathways significantly enriched in stress-responsive genes by integrating the stress-responsive gene set with metabolic pathway data available in the RiceCyc database. The pathways involved in amino acids biosynthesis, secondary metabolite biosynthesis, hormone biosynthesis, carbohydrate metabolism and cell wall structures were significantly overrepresented among stress-responsive genes (Fig. 6), which are in well agreement with GO enrichment analysis. A list of pathways affected under stress conditions are given in Supplementary Table S5. Most evidently, the genes involved in the biosynthesis of various amino acids, including tryptophan, valine, isoleucine, glycine, glutamate and serine, were significantly represented in stress-responsive genes. The pathways for various stress-related hormone biosynthesis, such as jasmonic acid, ethylene and ABA biosynthesis, were also enriched. The genes involved in jasmonic acid biosynthesis were up-regulated under salinity stress, whereas genes for ABA biosynthesis were up-regulated under salinity stress, but down-regulated under submergence stress (Fig. 6). The pathways involved in carbohydrate metabolism, such as starch degradation, trehalose biosynthesis and anaerobic respiration, were also overrepresented among the stress-responsive genes. The genes involved in anaerobic respiration were significantly up-regulated under submergence stress alone and along with salinity stress. The genes involved in anaerobic metabolism have been found regulated in response to submergence, flooding and O2 deprivation across the plant species too.35,39 Notably, the genes involved in cell wall structure biosynthesis, such as cellulose and suberin biosynthesis, were also significantly enriched. The pathways involved in serotonin amides biosynthesis, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, phospholipase activity and fatty acid derivative biosynthesis were also found enriched. A similar set of metabolic pathways were significantly represented in the different groups of genes with distinct expression patterns (Supplementary Table S6). Regulation of metabolic pathways during salinity and submergence stress conditions. The metabolic pathways enriched in differentially expressed genes are shown.

A colour version is available online.Interestingly, we detected the differential expression of several genes in Porteresia implicated in SUB1A-mediated submergence tolerance response.40 In addition to the genes involved in ethylene response, carbohydrate metabolism, photorespiration and anaerobic respiration, we found putative gibberellin biosynthesis genes regulated under submergence stress, which mediates shoot elongation. The expression of Alcohol Dehydrogenase, a marker gene for anoxia stress, was also up-regulated under submergence stress, consistent with previous findings.35,40–42 We detected differential expression of several putative expansin genes as well under submergence and/or salt + submergence stress. The expansins have been shown to play a major role in cell expansion under anoxic condition, prevalent under submergence stress.35,42,433.7. Real-time PCR validation of differential gene expressionWe validated the results of differential gene expression analysis obtained from RNA-seq data by real-time RT–PCR analysis. The expression of at least 10 randomly selected genes was analysed in the three biological replicates of five tissue samples representing different conditions. The analysis revealed similar expression pattern of all the selected genes in real-time PCR analysis as observed from RNA-seq data. The statistical analysis also showed very good correspondence (correlation coefficient of 0.792) among the results of real-time PCR and RNA-seq data analyses as shown in Fig. 7.

DiscussionOver the past many years, considerable efforts have been made to understand the molecular mechanism of salinity tolerance/adaptation in plants. Several studies have reported the molecular responses of plants to salinity stress.1–4,34 However, only a few studies have been performed to analyse the submergence response.35,36,40 In the recent years, study of wild halophyte relatives has gained attention as models to investigate the mechanism of salinity and submergence tolerance due to their extreme tolerance/adaptability to these conditions.5,6 However, most of such studies are confined to close relatives of Arabidopsis, T. halophila and T. parvula.14–16 Recently, the transcriptome of a salinity-tolerant wild tomato species has also been reported.44 However, considering the complexity of salinity response and fundamental differences in the physiology of monocots and dicots, these dicot halophytes are not ideal models to understand the mechanism of salinity tolerance in monocot crop plants. Recently, the importance of P. coarctata, wild halophyte relative rice, has been recognized as a model to study stress tolerance in monocots and important source of genes for the improvement of rice via biotechnological approaches.8In the present study, we sequenced the transcriptome of Porteresia under different stress conditions using Illumina technology to explore its gene complement. Unexpectedly, Porteresia transcripts exhibited low similarity with rice proteins, suggesting significant differences between Porteresia and rice genomes. The similarity of Porteresia genes with rice was lower than that of other sequenced wild rice species.45,46 A substantial number of genes appeared specific to Porteresia because they do not have an ortholog in rice and other organisms as predicted based on the sequence similarity. Furthermore, we observed expansion or contraction of certain TF families in Porteresia vis-a-vis rice. This unique gene complement might provide means of stress adaptation in Porteresia. We identified a total of 15 158 genes responsive to salinity and/or submergence stress, which have been implicated in diverse biological processes and metabolic pathways. The genes involved in similar biological processes, such as photosynthesis, secondary metabolite biosynthesis, hormone biosynthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, cell wall-related enzymes and transport etc., have been implicated in salinity and/or submergence stress in Arabidopsis, rice and halophytes as well.33,35,38,40,41 A significant number of genes of unknown function were also differentially expressed under various stress conditions analysed, and many of these genes were presumably specific to Porteresia, which might also play a crucial role in stress adaptation.Several studies have demonstrated that TFs act as key regulators of plant response to environmental stimuli.47–49 The role of certain TF families, such as AP2-EREBP, MYB and NAC, in stress responses has been well established. We also observed the differential expression of members of these TF families under salinity and submergence stresses in Porteresia. We detected that most of TF genes differentially expressed under salinity stress are up-regulated, whereas most of differentially expressed TF genes under submergence stress are down-regulated. This is in accordance with the total number of genes differentially expressed showing up- and down-regulation under salinity and submergence stresses. These results suggest that overall transcriptional activity is induced under salinity stress, but repressed under submergence stress. Based on the analyses, we found that role of NAC, MYB and WRKY family TFs may be more crucial for salinity tolerance, whereas bZIP, bHLH, HSF and AP2-EREBP families play a major role during submergence stress. The role of SUBMERGENCE1 (SUB1) QTL in submergence tolerance is well known, which harbour a tandem cluster of AP2/ERF family genes.40,41,50,51 Recently, Niroula et al.52 proposed the existence of SUB1-dependent and -independent mechanisms involved in submergence tolerance in wild rice plants. However, further investigations are required to find the exact mechanism of submergence tolerance in Porteresia.Metabolic pathways maintain cellular homeostasis and are very important for imparting stress tolerance/adaptation in plants. We found significant enrichment of genes encoding key enzymes involved in important metabolic pathways under stress conditions in Porteresia. The production of secondary metabolites under stress condition has been well known as adaptive feature of plants. We also detected the enrichment of biosynthetic genes of certain secondary metabolites, such as hydroxycinnamic acid serotonin amides and phenylpropanoids etc., under stress conditions in Porteresia. Hydroxycinnamic acid serotonin amides have only been detected in rice, pepper and a few other plants so far and are supposed to act as antioxidants.53 Although their exact function is unclear, their antioxidant property may help encounter/adapt stress condition in Porteresia. Phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway of initial reactions (cinnamates biosynthesis) produces coumarate, which gives rise to a variety of secondary compounds such as flavonoids, stilbenes and lignin, which can help in protection against stress conditions.The plant hormones, ethylene and ABA are well known to be involved in adaptive response to environmental stresses. Jasmonic acid has primarily been implicated in defence response, but is involved in other stress responses as well.54 Furthermore, the biosynthesis of several secondary metabolites by jasmonates has been well documented,55–57 suggesting that biosynthesis of jasmonates may impart stress tolerance in plants via transcriptional activation of biosynthetic pathway of important secondary metabolites. The enzymes involved in cyclic methionine salvage pathway, which ensures ethylene biosynthesis via methionine recycling, were enriched under salinity stress.58 We observed up-regulation of ethylene biosynthesis genes under salinity and submergence stresses. Earlier reports have also shown the altered ethylene levels underwater, which activates genes associated with stress acclimation.41,50,59 ABA is a well-known stress implicated in plant stress responses, including salinity stress.60–63 The increased accumulation of ABA under salinity stress has been reported, which, in turn, activates several other genes to provide tolerance. However, under submergence stress, the levels of ABA are reduced.64 We also observed the down-regulation of ABA biosynthesis genes under submergence stress. Recently, it has been proposed that SUB1A gene delays leaf senescence via hormonal regulation, which can contribute to enhanced stress tolerance in rice.59The enrichment of various pathways related to carbohydrate metabolism, such as starch degradation, anaerobic respiration and trehalose biosynthesis, is in concordance with earlier reports, demonstrating that concentrations of soluble sugars increases under various abiotic stress conditions.65,66 The differential expression of genes related to carbohydrate metabolism in response to various abiotic stresses has been reported previously also.67 The sugars, sucrose and glucose either act as substrates for cellular respiration or act as osmolytes to maintain cell homeostasis.68,69 In fact, one of the present hypotheses for survival of rice under submergence stress is based on carbohydrate metabolism only.41,51,70 Trehalose has been proposed as osmoprotectant against various stresses. It has been demonstrated that accumulation of trehalose in rice plants results in increased soluble sugar content, which confers tolerance to different abiotic stresses.71,72 Furthermore, the elevated transcript levels of the genes associated with anaerobic respiration can allow plant cells to invoke the energy conserving mode of ATP production under submergence stress in Porteresia as speculated earlier.12,35 Recently, Miro and Ismail12 reviewed anaerobic respiration and starch degradation as the main traits associated with flooding tolerance in rice genotypes.The biosynthetic pathways for suberin and cellulose, major constituents of cell wall, were also found enriched in stress-responsive genes in Porteresia. Although the exact mechanism is not known, several studies have suggested a crucial role of cell wall in stress tolerance.73 The mutations in cellulose synthase genes have also been shown to alter stress tolerance in plants.74,75 Suberin is a primary constituent of primary cell wall of underground tissues and is analogous to cutin, which forms a layer on plant aerial parts to prevent the direct contact of epidermal cell with environment and thus, acts as a physical barrier to enhance plant resistance to abiotic stress. Based on the analysis of cutin biosynthesis mutants, it has been demonstrated that plant cuticle is required for the regulation of ABA biosynthesis and osmotic stress tolerance.76 Considering the similar biochemical nature of suberin and cutin, the increased biosynthesis of suberin may be crucial for stress tolerance in Porteresia. Furthermore, the characterization of enhanced submergence 1 (esb1) mutant provided evidence for the role of suberin in water balance, ion translocation and stress tolerance.77,78 Thus, alteration in the degree of suberization may result in improved stress tolerance in plants. Overall, it can be concluded that a well-organized transcriptional regulation is responsible for salinity and submergence tolerance in Porteresia. It will be very tempting to investigate the precise role of genes involved in the metabolic pathways enriched during salinity and submergence stresses in Porteresia. The genetic engineering of such candidate genes/pathways may confer stress tolerance in crop plants.In conclusion, we report the transcriptome sequence of wild halophyte rice, Porteresia. The results suggest that extensive transcriptional reprogramming under salinity and submergence stresses is responsible for tolerance to these stresses in Porteresia. The transcriptome analyses presented in this study provide several candidate genes involved in salinity and submergence tolerance, which can be used as potential targets for genetic engineering and opens new avenues for future investigations. The functional analyses of genes/pathways identified here along with investigations on non-coding regulatory RNAs, epigenetic modifications, biochemical complexity and metabolite profiling would be very useful to help understand the exact mechanism of salinity and submergence tolerance in Porteresia.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was financially supported by the core grant from NIPGR.

IntroductionHigh-resolution linkage maps are exceptionally valuable tools in many genetic and genomic applications, such as fine-scale quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping, characterization of recombination hotspots, comparative genome analysis and genome scaffolding. A key prerequisite for constructing a high-resolution linkage map is the availability of a large number of genetic markers (preferably, single-nucleotide polymorphisms—SNPs), which has been unfortunately out of reach for most non-model organisms until just a few years ago due to the huge investments in large-scale marker discovery and array-based genotyping. Recent advances in the next-generation sequencing technologies have revolutionized our ability to obtain massive genomic resources in a rapid and cost-effective manner and, therefore, greatly stimulate the development of a variety of genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) methods.1 Among available GBS methods, restriction site-associated DNA (RAD) has gained popularity for the construction of high-density linkage maps,1 and several methods with simpler RAD library preparation protocols have been developed.2,3 For example, Wang et al.2 have recently developed the 2b-RAD method by adopting Type IIB restriction enzymes to simplify RAD library preparation. The streamlined 2b-RAD method features even and tunable genome coverage, providing a flexible genotyping platform to diminish the extensive sequencing effort required for species with large genomes.Bivalves comprise ~14 000 species worldwide,4 constituting the second largest group of molluscs. Many bivalves are of economic importance and support both commercial fisheries and mariculture efforts. They make up an important source of food all over the world, with a production of over 11.7 million metric tons in 2008, corresponding to 22% of the global aquaculture production.5 Elucidation of genetic bases underlying economically important traits, such as growth and reproduction, has been a central task in bivalve genetic and breeding studies for the purpose of genetic improvement. Linkage maps have been constructed for many bivalve species with the aim for QTL mapping of important traits. However, the resolution of these maps is generally low (mostly 10–20 cM), thus limiting their usefulness in determining quantitative trait genes. Great progresses have been recently achieved by transcriptome sequencing for large-scale identification of candidate genes involved in bivalve growth and reproduction.6–10 Polymorphisms in some candidate genes have also been associated with the variation of bivalve growth traits.11,12 Bivalves exhibit fascinatingly diverse sexual patterning. Some species are dioecious, whereas some are simultaneous hermaphrodites with a few as protandrous hermaphrodites (male when young, then later become female) or proterogynous hermaphrodites (female when young, then later become male). Currently, the mechanism of sex determination remains poorly understood in bivalves. Some recent studies have associated the sex determination of bivalves with doubly uniparental inheritance (DUI) of mitochondria10,13 and a hypothetical model has been proposed.10 However, the generality of the proposed model is constrained because DUI is a peculiar mtDNA inheritance system that exists only in a few bivalve species.The scallop Chlamys farreri (Jones et Preston 1904) naturally distributes along the seacoasts of China, Japan and Korea, and is a commercially important bivalve species in China. With increasing acreage devoted to artificial farming, several issues such as declining production and frequent disease outbreaks have raised great concern in modern scallop aquaculture. Currently, genetic studies focusing on scallop growth, reproduction and immunity represent active research directions. Genetic and genomic resources for C. farreri have rapidly expanded, including low-density linkage,14–17 physical18 and cytogenetic maps,19 fosmid and bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries,20,21 a large number of expressed sequence tags.7,22 The direction of the present study was also shaped by our immediate need for building up an integrative genomic platform that unifies a variety of genomic resources, such as genome map, linkage map and physical map, and facilitates future genetic, genomic and breeding studies on C. farreri.2. Materials and methods2.1. Genome survey sequencing and gene annotationA two-year-old C. farreri individual was chosen for genome survey sequencing. Genomic DNA was extracted from its adductor muscle using the standard phenol/chloroform extraction method.23 Three paired-end DNA libraries with insert sizes of 175, 500 and 800 bp were constructed by following the Illumina's standard DNA library preparation protocol and were then sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq2000 platform.Raw reads were first filtered to remove low-quality reads resulting from base-calling duplications or adapter contamination. Clean reads were assembled using the SOAPdenovo software, which applies the de Bruijn graph structure to construct contigs. Subsequently, all reads were realigned to the contigs and the paired-end information was used to join unique contigs into scaffolds. Finally, intra-scaffold gaps were filled using paired-end extracted reads that had one read uniquely aligned on a contig and another read located in a gap region. Genomic sequences were archived in the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database (accession no. SRP018107).Our group has recently reported the most comprehensive transcriptome resource for C. farreri by 454 sequencing of cDNA libraries generated from diverse developmental stages and adult tissues,7 which provide an excellent basis for gene annotation of the obtained scaffolds. Genomic scaffolds were first annotated by aligning the 20 056 transcriptomic isogroup sequences (i.e. the longest isotig in each isogroup) onto these scaffolds using the GMAP program.24 To increase the annotation rate, the unannotated scaffolds were compared against the Swiss-Prot and non-redundant (NR) protein databases using BlastX, with an E-value threshold of 1E-4. For scaffolds without significant matches, tBlastX search with an E-value threshold of 1E-4 was conducted against the NR nucleotide database for further annotation. To increase computational speed, all Blast searches were limited to the top 10 significant hits for each query.2.2. Mapping familiesTwenty full-sib families were established in May 2009 by single-pair mating of ‘Penglai-Red’ scallops, an elite C. farreri strain developed by our group with features of red shell, fast growth and disease resistance. Growth-related traits including shell length, shell width, shell height and body weight were measured for all families at the age of 15 months. One of these families exhibiting high within-family variation of growth traits was chosen for linkage and QTL analysis.2.3. 2b-RAD sequencing2b-RAD libraries were prepared for two parents and 96 progenies by following the protocol developed by Wang et al.2 For the parents, standard BsaXI libraries were constructed, whereas for the progenies, reduced representation (RR) libraries were constructed using adaptors with 5'-NNT-3' overhangs to target a subset of all BsaXI fragments in the C. farreri genome. A unique barcode was incorporated into each library during library preparation, and then all libraries were pooled for single-end sequencing (1 × 50 bp) using an Illumina GA-II sequencer. All the 2b-RAD sequences were archived in the SRA database (accession no. SRA065207).2.4. Sequence data preprocessing and de novo genotypingRaw reads were first trimmed to remove adaptor sequences. The terminal 3-bp positions were excluded from each read to eliminate artefacts that might have arisen at ligation sites. Reads with no restriction sites or containing ambiguous base calls (N), long homopolymer regions (>10 bp), excessive numbers of low-quality positions (>5 positions with quality of <10) or mitochondrial origins were removed. The remaining trimmed, high-quality reads formed the basis for subsequent analysis.De novo 2b-RAD genotyping was performed using the RADtyping program v1.0 (http://www2.ouc.edu.cn/mollusk/detailen.asp?Id=727) under default parameters. The RADtyping program has recently been developed by our group, and it is an integrated pipeline that enables both accurate de novo codominant and dominant genotyping in mapping populations.2.5. Linkage map constructionSegregating markers that could be genotyped in at least 80% of the individuals were considered as high-quality markers and were retained for further analysis. For each segregating marker, goodness of fit of the observed with the expected Mendelian ratio was assessed using the <U+03C7>2 test, and those markers conforming to the expected Mendelian ratios (P = 0.05) were included in map construction. Linkage analysis was performed using the JoinMap 4.0 software.25 Sex-specific maps were first constructed for each parent. Maternal and paternal datasets were created using the function ‘Create Maternal and Paternal Population Nodes’ in the JoinMap program, which was also used to partition 1:2:1-type data into 1:1 female-type and 1:1 male-type data. A logarithm of odds (LOD) threshold of at least 6.0 was used to assign markers into linkage groups. The regression mapping algorithm was selected for map construction. The Kosambi mapping function was used to convert the recombination frequencies into map distances (centiMorgans). A consensus map was established by integrating the sex-specific maps through shared markers using the MergeMap software.262.6. QTL mapping and association analyses of growth traits and sexThe distributions of growth traits were first assessed using the univariate procedure of MATLAB software to check whether they followed normal distributions. Pearson correlations among four growth traits were calculated using pairwise comparison.Association analysis was performed as a complement approach to QTL mapping, which was implemented using an R package called ‘GWAF’30 that tests genetic association between genotypes and traits by fitting a linear model accounting for within full-sib pedigree correlation. The additive model in GWAF was selected by use of the kinship coefficient matrix in the analysis to avoid false positives owing to unexpected familial correlation. The functions ‘lme.batch’ and ‘gee.lgst.batch’ were used to perform a global test (i.e. Wald <U+03C7>2 test) of genotypic effects with growth traits and sex, respectively. Bonferroni correction was carried out to account for multiple comparisons.2.7. Integration of the linkage map, genomic scaffolds and a physical mapTo associate genomic scaffolds with the linkage map, all markers in the linkage map were mapped onto the scaffolds using the SOAP2 software31 (parameters –M 4, -v 2). Marker-associated scaffolds were further used as linkers to integrate the linkage map with a BAC-based physical map previously constructed for C. farreri.18 These scaffold sequences were compared against available BAC-end sequences (BESs) using BlastN with an E-value cut-off of 1E-10. A reciprocal comparison was performed to ensure one-to-one matches between the scaffolds and BAC contigs.3. Results3.1. Genome survey sequencing of C. farreriThe genome size of C. farreri is relatively large and was previously estimated as ~1.2 Gb.20 Genome survey sequencing was performed for a single C. farreri individual by sequencing three paired-end DNA libraries with insert sizes of 175, 500 and 800 bp based on the Illumina HiSeq2000 platform. In total, 62.4 Gb of sequencing data, equivalent to ~52× genome coverage, were produced (Table 1). K-mer analysis revealed remarkably high heterozygosity (~1.4%) in the C. farreri genome (Fig. 1). Owing to the high genome heterozygosity, assembly of these data produced a large number of small scaffolds (N50 = 1.5 kb), with the longest one only reached to 46 kb (Table 2). All the scaffold sequences are accessible at http://ipl.ouc.edu.cn/fuxiaoteng/cf_SRA_data. Of 20 056 isogroups in the C. farreri transcriptome,7 18 316 (91.3%) could match with 16 489 genomic scaffolds, suggesting that the majority of genes were present in our reference genome dataset. Of the mapped transcriptomic isogroups, 88.4% had been functionally annotated through the homology-based comparison against public databases. Summing up all scaffolds resulted in a total length of ~870 Mb, corresponding to ~70% of genome coverage; though not complete, it constitutes the most informative reference genome currently available for C. farreri.

The frequency of each 17-mer was calculated and plotted. Two peaks rather than one were observed, indicating high genome heterozygosity.3.2. Optimization of a 2b-RAD sequencing plan for linkage mappingBecause of the large genome size (~1.2 Gb) of C. farreri, it is necessary to devise a cost-effective sequencing plan that can balance the total sequencing cost and genotyping accuracy. In total, 210 570 BsaXI sites were identified from the reference genome dataset. Based on the genome coverage (~70%) of this dataset, the total number of BsaXI sites in the C. farreri genome was estimated as ~0.3 million. Sequencing all of the BsaXI sites to 20× for a large mapping population (e.g. hundreds of individuals) would require a large sequencing investment. A notable feature of the 2b-RAD method is its ability to fine tune marker density as needed by constructing RR libraries using less-degenerate adaptors.2 For example, an RR library constructed using adaptors with 5'-NNT-3' overhangs only targets ~1/10th of all the BsaXI sites in the C. farreri genome, and sequencing of such a library to 20× would require only 0.6 million reads per individual (in contrast to 6 million reads per individual for a standard BsaXI library), thus dramatically reducing the total sequencing cost.3.3. 2b-RAD sequencing of a C. farreri mapping populationBased on the calculations above, RR libraries were constructed for a C. farreri mapping population, sequencing of which produced 0.6–1.2 million high-quality reads per progeny. For the parents, standard libraries were constructed and sequenced to a sufficient depth (70–80×). As shown in Fig. 2, target sites of the RR libraries could be reproducibly detected among different progenies and their average sequencing coverage was ~6-fold higher than that of standard libraries. The sequencing depth for progenies ranged from 13.4 to 23.8 with an average of 16.75. Clustering parental reads resulted in 181 625 representative reference sites consisting of 138 141 parent-shared sites and 43 484 parent-specific sites. After filtering low-quality sites, 117 113 parent-shared and 35 799 parent-specific sites remained. These reference sites contained 92% of the unique BsaXI sites inferred from the scaffolds, suggesting that unique sites were well represented in the high-quality reference sites. Distribution of sequencing coverage for target sites derived from 365 randomly chosen C. farreri scaffolds (concatenated). For parents, sequencing data were generated from standard BsaXI libraries, whereas for progenies, RR libraries were sequenced. Target sites of the RR libraries could be reproducibly sequenced among progenies and their sequencing coverage was ~6-fold higher than for standard libraries.Distribution of sequencing coverage for target sites derived from 365 randomly chosen C. farreri scaffolds (concatenated).

Target sites of the RR libraries could be reproducibly sequenced among progenies and their sequencing coverage was ~6-fold higher than for standard libraries.3.4. High-resolution linkage mappingIn total, 7458 polymorphic markers were identified, of which 6842 were heterozygous in at least one parent, including 2196 co-dominant and 4646 dominant markers. Dominant markers showing 3 : 1 segregation pattern in progenies were not included in subsequent analysis due to their inability to construct sex-specific maps. Totally, 4881 markers that conformed to the expected Mendelian ratios (P = 0.05) were included in the linkage analysis. These markers were partitioned into maternal (1 : 1 female type; 2473 markers) and paternal (1 : 1 male type; 2175 markers) datasets for constructing sex-specific linkage maps. At the LOD threshold of 6.0, the markers were grouped into 19 linkage groups, corresponding to the haploid chromosome number of C. farreri.32 The female map contained 2025 markers and spanned 1175.4 cM with an average marker interval of 0.59 cM, whereas the male map contained 1861 markers and spanned 1154.9 cM with an average marker interval of 0.62 cM. Significant differences in recombination rates between the female and male maps were observed for linkage groups LG5, LG8, LG10 and LG15 (Table 3). LG5 and LG10 showed higher recombination rates in females than in males, whereas the contrary was found for LG8 and LG15. Summary of the consensus linkage map in C. farreriSummary of the consensus linkage map in C. farreriThe sex-specific maps were further integrated using anchor markers that were heterozygous in both parents. The consensus map contained 3806 markers (Fig. 3, Table 3) and spanned 1543.4 cM with an average marker interval of 0.41 cM. The length of each linkage group ranged from 54.9 to 99.6 cM, and the marker density varied from 123 to 274 across the linkage groups. Mapping all the markers to the annotated genomic scaffolds revealed 623 markers (18–53 per linkage group; Table 3) that resided in or close to genes. These markers represent a valuable resource for future comparative genome analysis.

Genome coverage of the consensus map was nearly complete and reached 99.5%. Given the estimated genome size of ~1.2 Gb for C. farreri,20 the average recombination rate across all the linkage groups was ~1.3 cM/Mb.3.5. QTL mapping and association analyses of growth traits and sexPairwise comparisons among five growth traits using Pearson's correlation revealed that all of them were highly correlated with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.77 to 0.96 (Table 4). The strongest correlation was observed between shell length and shell height (r = 0.96, P = 1E-10). A genome scan for these growth traits showed that they exhibited quite similar LOD profiles (Fig. 4), indicating that these traits were possibly regulated by the same set of genes. Therefore, a principle component analysis was conducted, which revealed that the first principal component (PC1) explained ~90% of the total phenotypic variation (Fig. 5). To increase the QTL detection power, PC1 was utilized as a composite trait for QTL mapping. Two significant QTLs were detected on LG1 and LG3 (Fig. 6a and Table 5) and the one on LG3 that passed the genome-wide significance threshold showed a stronger QTL signal. The two QTLs explained 11.4 and 16.9% of the total phenotypic variation, respectively. Given the high marker density in the linkage map, association analysis was also performed to serve as a complementary approach to evaluate the QTL mapping results. Association analysis revealed a similar distribution pattern across all linkage groups as in QTL mapping analysis (Fig. 6a) and supported QTL mapping results in general. Within the confidence interval of the QTL detected on LG3, one marker named f68558 was found to be located in the intron region of a transcription factor gene, PROP1 (Homeobox protein prophet of Pit-1) (Fig. 7 and Supplementary Table S1). It has been shown that PROP1 can regulate the production of growth hormone,35 a peptide that simulates growth, cell reproduction and regeneration in animals. Identification of PROP1 within the QTL region suggests that this gene may represent an important candidate QTL gene that is worthy of further investigation.

Moreover, no global difference (female : male = 1.01) in the recombination rate was observed for this linkage group between the two sex-specific maps (Table 3). Association analysis revealed 27 sex-related markers with high statistical significance (P < 1E-6; Supplementary Table S2) and all of them fell into the narrow QTL region identified by the QTL mapping analysis. Interestingly, one sex-related marker named f93422 was located in the coding region of a transcription factor gene, ZNFX1 (NFX1-type zinc finger-containing 1), which has been shown to be tightly linked with AMHR2 (anti-Mullerian hormone receptor type II), the sex-determination gene in the tiger pufferfish, Takifugu rubripes.363.6. Integration of the linkage map, genomic scaffolds and a physical mapA high-resolution linkage map can serve as an important platform for integrating multiple genomic resources. One such application is to improve genome assembly by orienting genomic scaffolds. For C. farreri, a majority of larger genomic scaffolds contained at least one BsaXI site (77% for scaffolds of > 5kb; 92% for scaffolds of >10 kb) and therefore, it could be potentially oriented using a high-density linkage map. Of the 3806 markers in the consensus linkage map, 2174 could be unambiguously anchored to scaffolds. These scaffolds were not only useful for directing a higher-level genome assembly, but also could serve as ‘long’ surrogates for 2b-RAD tags to enhance their utility in unifying genomic resources. To demonstrate this potential, we attempted to integrate the linkage map with a BAC-based physical map previously constructed for C. farreri.18 The physical map contained 2514 BAC contigs that had BESs; however, a large fraction of them had only a few BESs (e.g. 73% with less than three sequenced BAC clones), thus limiting the integration efficiency. Even so, 681 BAC contigs could still be linked with the linkage map through sequence comparison between BESs and marker-associated scaffolds (Supplementary dataset). An example showing the integration of LG1 and BAC contigs is present in Fig. 8. Schematic demonstration of the integration of linkage group LG1, genomic scaffolds and a BAC-based physical map.Schematic demonstration of the integration of linkage group LG1, genomic scaffolds and a BAC-based physical map.4. Discussion4.1. Genome sequencing in bivalvesIn spite of species abundance and diverse geographical distribution, little effort has been devoted to decoding bivalve genomes. To date, whole-genome sequencing has been performed for only two bivalve species, i.e. Pearl oyster (Pinctada fucata)37 and Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas),38 providing the first glimpse into bivalve genome architecture. Apparently, genome sequencing of a broader range of bivalves would enable a better understanding of their phylogeny, speciation and diversification. Our study represents the first step towards fully decoding a scallop genome. Genome analysis revealed that C. farreri possesses a highly heterozygous genome. This finding is not unusual and has been reported in other bivalve species.37,38 For example, it has been shown that, for the Pacific oyster, average density of SNPs is one SNP per 60 bp in coding regions and one per 40 bp in non-coding regions.39 High genome heterozygosity poses the challenge of efficient genome assembly. In such instance, a high-resolution linkage map would be much valuable in that they can orientate the small scaffolds to improve genome assembly.4.2. Devising an optimal 2b-RAD sequencing plan for linkage mappingLarge-scale linkage mapping studies generally call for a cost-effective sequencing plan that reasonably balances the sequencing cost and genotyping accuracy. Through simulation analysis, a sequencing depth of 20× for both parents and progenies can provide sufficiently high genotyping accuracy (>96%; unpublished data). Determining the amount of sequencing necessary for a desired sequencing depth would require the knowledge of a total number of restriction sites in a given genome. Without a reference genome, the total number of restriction sites can be simply predicted based on genome size and GC content by assuming sites that are Poisson distributed. However, it has been shown that such estimation departed considerably from the actual numbers in some instances.1 Our study demonstrates that genome survey sequencing can facilitate devising an optimal 2b-RAD sequencing plan by providing sufficient genome information to determine the minimal amount of sequencing required for a given sequencing depth. Meanwhile, the obtained genome information can also be used to enhance de novo 2b-RAD analysis in many other aspects, such as evaluation of the efficiency and reliability of de novo reference site reconstruction, identification of genes surrounding 2b-RAD tags and association of 2b-RAD tags with public genomic resources.For species with very large genomes, sequencing all BsaXI sites at a depth of 20× for all individuals remains a substantial investment. For example, sequencing 200 human individuals with the genome size of ~3 Gb would require 5.2 billion reads, which are approximately equivalent to the number of reads produced from >4 full sequencing runs using the HiSeq2000 platform. One advantage of 2b-RAD methodology is the option to adjust marker density to the desired level using selective adaptors. Sequencing cost can be further reduced by sequencing a subset of BsaXI sites deriving from RR libraries. We have demonstrated that sequencing a C. farreri RR library only required about one-sixth of the sequencing cost for a standard library at a given sequencing coverage, thus reducing the total sequencing cost dramatically. Therefore, sequencing RR libraries represents an effective option for large-scale linkage mapping studies dealing with species with large genomes.4.3. Linkage map construction and QTL analysisThus far, linkage maps have been constructed for many bivalve species including C. farreri.14–17 However, these maps were usually built using hundreds of markers and the resolution was generally low (mostly 10–20 cM), limiting their use in fine-scale QTL mapping and many other applications. In this study, the linkage map constructed for C. farreri contained 3806 markers, a marker density that has, to our knowledge, never been reached for any other bivalve species. This linkage map covered nearly the whole genome (99.5%) with a resolution of 0.41 cM. In addition, ~10% of the markers in the linkage map residing in or close to genes as revealed by mapping them to the annotated genomic scaffolds. Our map, therefore, provides sufficient resolution for fine-scale QTL mapping and facilitates the discovery of quantitative trait genes.Growth traits are of particular interest to scallop researchers due to their high commercial significance in scallop aquaculture. QTL mapping represents an efficient approach to identify genetic loci underlying these traits for marker-assisted selection in genetic breeding. Two growth-related QTLs were detected on the linkage groups LG1 and LG3, which are also supported by the association analysis, a complementary approach to evaluate the QTL mapping results. The markers located at the confidence intervals of these QTLs constitute a valuable marker set for further evaluation of their utility in marker-assisted selection. In particular, the homeotic gene PROP1, which was identified from the QTL region on LG3, drew our great interest. This gene encodes a paired-like homeodomain protein that is necessary for PIT1 (growth hormone factor 1) expression. In mammals, mutations in this gene can result in impaired production of growth hormone and other pituitary hormones.35 Polymorphisms in this gene have been associated with production traits in livestock animals, such as cattle,40 goats 41,42 and sheep.43 The marker f68558 is probably not the causal locus that is responsible for growth trait variation in C. farreri. Instead, we think it is more likely that f68558 is in tight linkage disequilibrium with the causal mutation that is possibly located in the regulatory region (e.g. promoter) of PROP1. The expression level of PROP1 has been checked in major adult tissues (e.g. adductor muscle, digestive gland, gill, mantle, male and female gonads and kidney) of C. farreri. It turned out that PROP1 was not expressed in neither of these tissues (data not shown), suggesting that scallop PROP1 is probably expressed and functioning during early embryonic development just like its homologues in vertebrates. In vertebrates, PROP1 is only temporarily expressed during early pituitary development.44 However, determining the temporal and spatial expression of PROP1 in bivalves is not straightforward, since the counterpart of pituitary has not been established in bivalves. Further work would be needed to overcome these barriers to evaluate the role(s) of PROP1 in scallop growth regulation.Unlike many other animals, scallops do not possess recognizable heteromorphic sex chromosomes,45 and little is currently known about their sex-determination mechanism. The use of molecular markers in mapping experiments to identify regions involved in sex determination represents an efficient approach to study sex-determination systems in species without heteromorphic sex chromosomes. In this study, both QTL mapping and association analysis revealed a highly significant sex-related QTL on LG11, suggesting the presence of a narrow sex-determination region (34.61–34.98 cM) in C. farreri. No global differences in recombination rates were detected for LG11 between the two sexes, which may account for the indistinguishable morphologies of sex chromosomes in C. farreri. Interestingly, we found that one sex-related marker (i.e. f93422) was situated at the transcription factor gene, ZNFX1, which has been shown to be tightly linked with the sex-determination gene AMHR2 in the tiger pufferfish.36 Unfortunately, we do not have direct evidence to support the physical linkage between ZNFX1 and AMHR2 based on the available C. farreri genome information. Furthermore, searching another two molluscan genomes, i.e. the Pacific oyster C. gigas (http://gigadb.org/pacific_oyster) and the owl limpet Lottia gigantea (http://metazoa.ensembl.org/Lottia_gigantea), did not support the two genes' linkage either, though this does not necessarily exclude the possibility of their physical linkage because these genome assemblies are still largely fragmented (scaffold N50 is 401 kb for C. gigas38 and 1.87 Mb for L. gigantean46). Our group has initiated the whole-genome sequencing project for C. farreri; therefore, this issue will be settled in the near future.4.4. Integration of the linkage map with multiple genomic resourcesRecent studies have shown that RAD-based linkage maps can greatly improve large-scale genome assembly.47,48 However, RAD tags are usually short in length (35–100 bp), thus limiting their direct use for integration with other important genomic resources generated from RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, exome sequencing or BAC–fosmid-end sequencing. Here, we propose that RAD tags can be effectively extended using the scaffolds obtained from genome survey sequencing. For C. farreri, although a majority of the scaffolds were not very long (scaffold N50 = 1.5 kb), they could already serve as ‘long’ surrogates for 2b-RAD tags to enhance their utility. We have demonstrated that this approach could facilitate the integration of the scallop linkage map with the BAC-based physical map, even though a large fraction of BAC contigs contained only a few BESs (e.g. 73% with less than three sequenced BAC clones). Besides, such approach can also facilitate the identification of genes surrounding a given tag, which can be crucial for the identification of quantitative trait genes in QTL mapping and association studies. Therefore, it can be envisioned that this scallop linkage map would serve as an important platform for unifying genomic resources that have been accumulated for C. farreri.4.5. ConclusionsWe generated a preliminary reference genome for a bivalve mollusc, expanding the genome resources currently available for bivalves—a group of animals that remain largely unexplored in terms of genome sequencing. A high-resolution linkage map was constructed for C. farreri with a marker density that has, to our knowledge, never been achieved in any other molluscs. Two growth-related QTLs and one putative sex-determination region were detected, and candidate genes identified from these QTL regions represent important targets for further evaluation. Integration of the genome map, linkage map and physical map exemplifies how to build up a comprehensive genomic framework in a non-model organism.Supplementary DataSupplementary Data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31130054), National Basic Research Program of China (2010CB126402), National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (2012AA10A402, 2012AA10A405 and 2012AA092204) and Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars of Shandong Province (2013JQE29001).We thank Dr Xiaojun Zhang (Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences) for kindly providing the physical map data.Supplementary data"

IntroductionCommon wheat, also known as bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), is a major staple food crop in many parts of the world; therefore, there is a strong demand for the genetic improvement of wheat to achieve better quality, higher yield, adaptation to various environments, and tolerance to biotic stresses. These improvements would contribute significantly to human welfare. Highly detailed genomic information is an important tool for the genetic improvement of wheat, but the full sequencing of the wheat genome has been challenging.Wheat has a large genome, of ~17 Gb, and is allohexaploid, with three homoeologous genomes (2n = 6x = 42, genome formula AABBDD) that have been suggested to originate from Triticum urartu (2n = 2x = 14, AA) as a donor of the A genome, Aegilops tauschii (2n = 2x = 14, DD) as a donor of the D genome, and Aegilops speltoides (2n = 2x = 14, SS) or a related species as a possible donor of the B genome, although the identity of the B genome donor is still debated.1,2 Additionally, ~80–90% of the wheat genome is composed of repetitive sequences,3 which is a significantly higher percentage than Brachypodium (22%), rice (26%), and sorghum (54%).4,5 The large size and polyploidy-related complexity of the wheat genome have hampered genomic analysis, and decoding of the whole genome remains challenging, even though next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has recently been applied.6Chromosome sorting by flow cytometry can reduce sample complexity and simplify the sequencing of complex genomes by dividing these genomes into smaller parts.7 Using this method, survey sequences of individual chromosome (1H) or chromosome arms (2HS-7HL) in the barley genome have been obtained and analysed with NGS technology.8,9 In wheat, the sorting of single chromosomes or chromosome arms from the cultivar ‘Chinese Spring’ (CS) and its aneuploid lines has enabled the construction of chromosome (arm)-specific BAC libraries,10 and these BAC libraries have served as the critical resources for the development of physical maps and map-based genome sequencing by the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium (IWGSC; http://www.wheatgenome.org/, 20 September 2013, date last accessed). As in barley, the sequencing of several wheat chromosomes (1A, 1B, 1D, 3B, 4A, and 5A) or chromosome arms (1AL, 3AS, 7BS, and 7DS) has been conducted using NGS.11–19 These survey sequences from whole-chromosome shotgun sequencing are highly informative, bringing not only insights into the molecular organization and evolution of the wheat genome at an unsurpassed resolution but also detailed contents of the syntenic genes among grass genomes.14–16 Recently, whole-genome shotgun sequence analysis was performed on the two diploid progenitors of wheat, T. urartu and Ae. tauschii, which provided information that was useful for decoding the complex polyploid nature of the wheat genome.20,21Chromosome 6B is the third largest chromosome in common wheat, with a total molecular size of 914 Mb, representing 5.4% of the wheat genome. Chromosome 6B consists of a 415 Mb short arm (6BS) and a 498 Mb long arm (6BL).10 Similar to chromosome 1B, chromosome 6B can be distinguished from other wheat chromosomes in the karyotype by the presence of a satellite with a secondary constriction on the short arm.22 A translocation of chromosomal segments from 6BS and 2BS has also been reported.23 Moreover, a pericentromeric inversion has been observed in the cultivar CS.23,24 These structural features differentiate the chromosome 6B from the homoeologous chromosomes 6A and 6D.Up to 30 loci, including genes underlying agronomic, morphological, and physiological traits, have been genetically mapped to the wheat chromosome 6B.25 Among these genes, only two gene loci, Nor-B2 (nucleolus organizer region) and Gli-B2 (a/ß-gliadin seed storage protein), have been studied well. The Nor-B2 locus, which is located in the secondary constriction of 6BS, contains approximately 5500 copies of the rRNA genes,26 and the Gli-B2 locus is located in a position distal to the Nor-B2 locus, within ~10 cM of the 6BS satellite region.27 A recent sequencing study of the Gil-B2 locus mapped to chromosome 6B revealed that 11 a/ß-gliadin genes, including one pseudogene, were clustered within an ~260 kb genomic region.28 In tetraploid wheat, two agronomically important genes on chromosome 6B, Gpc-B1 (grain protein content) and Yr36 (wheat stripe rust resistance), were isolated using a map-based cloning strategy.29,30In this study, we conducted whole-chromosome shotgun sequencing using DNA amplified from the flow-sorted chromosome arms 6BS and 6BL, which were derived from a double-ditelosomic 6B (dDt6B) line of CS. The DNA samples of 6BS and 6BL were sequenced with a long-read-type NGS (Roche 454 GS-FLX Titanium). The assembled sequences were analysed to characterize the genomic composition of wheat chromosome 6B, including its gene and repetitive sequence contents and its syntenic relationship with other grass genomes, and to identify microRNA (miRNA) and tRNA precursors. These data will be useful for developing new 6B-specific molecular markers to construct BAC-based physical maps and future molecular breeding with marker-assisted selection, which will increase the understanding of the evolutionary and functional aspects of the wheat genome.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materialsSeeds of dDt6B of the hexaploid wheat cultivar CS (accession number LPGKU2269) were obtained from the National BioResource Project of Japan (http://www.shigen.nig.ac.jp/wheat/komugi/top/top.jsp, 20 September 2013, date last accessed). The dDt6B line was originally developed by Sears,31 and this line contains chromosome 6B as a pair of telosomes, of which one is a short arm (6BS), and the other is a long arm (6BL). The karyotype (20"" + t""6BS + t""6BL) was confirmed by C-banding.322.2. Chromosome sorting and DNA amplificationLiquid suspensions of intact mitotic chromosomes were prepared from synchronized root tips. The samples were stained with 2 µg/ml 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), and the telosomes were sorted using a FACSVantage SE flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson, San Jose, USA). The level of purity in the sorted fractions was determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) according to the method described by Kubaláková et al.33 The DNA of the sorted chromosome arms was purified as described by Šimková et al.34 and then amplified by multiple displacement amplification using the illustra™ GenomiPhi V2 DNA Amplification Kit (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp., Piscataway, NJ, USA). The amplified DNA was purified by ethanol precipitation before sequencing.2.3. NGS and assemblyThe chromosome arm-specific DNA from 6BS and 6BL was sequenced independently using the 454 GS-FLX Titanium (Roche, CT, USA) at Hokkaido System Science Co., Ltd (Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan) and Takara Bio, Inc. (Otsu, Shiga, Japan), respectively. The 454 sequenced read data reported here have been deposited in the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) Sequence Read Archive (DRA) and are available under accession number (DRA000979).The sequence reads from each arm were assembled using a GS assembler 2.7 (Roche) with the parameter ‘-large -vt’ to remove the vector sequence. The assembled contigs were compared with the registered sequences of the human genome and the non-redundant database in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank by BLASTN with the threshold of E-value < 10-5. Contigs with human genomic sequence or other non-plant (non-Viridiplantae) sequences as the best hit were removed from subsequent analysis.2.4. Detection of repeats and genes for functional RNA speciesRepeat regions were detected with Censor (http://www.girinst.org/censor/index.php, 20 September 2013, date last accessed)35 with the option ‘-mode norm’. In addition to an existing repeat library, TREP complete annotation (http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/ITMI/Repeats/, 20 September 2013, date last accessed), a de novo repeat family constructed using RepeatModeler (http://www.repeatmasker.org/RepeatModeler.html, 20 September 2013, date last accessed), was used for repeat detection. To detect ribosomal DNA (rDNA) regions, a homology search against unmasked contigs using BLAT was performed with the options ‘-fine -q = rna –out = blast’ and thresholds of =95% identity and =100 bp coverage. As queries, four rDNA sequences, 5S (3IZ9), 5.8S (3IZ9), 18S (3IZ7), and 25S (3IZ9), and one spacer region between the 25S and 18S rDNAs (X07841) were downloaded from DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank (http://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/, 20 September 2013, date last accessed).The tRNA genes were predicted using the tRNAscan-SE ver. 1.3.1 program.36 The tRNA genes in Brachypodium distachyon, rice, and sorghum were also predicted using the same procedure. Any tRNAs that were annotated as ‘possible pseudogenes’ were not counted.We performed the miRNA prediction following the procedure in the previous report for wheat chromosome 5A.13 Mature and immature plant miRNAs were downloaded from miRBase (http://www.mirbase.org/, 20 September 2013, date last accessed).37 In total, 4677 miRNAs from 193 different organisms were available. First, using mature miRNAs as query sequences, BLASTN was performed against the assembled sequences with the option E-value of 10 and a word size of 7. If a mature miRNA showed hits with direct and reverse orientation within a contig, then the existence of an immature miRNA was postulated. Because the BLASTN hits did not always cover an entire query sequence, hit regions were extended in the 5'/3' direction, and the number of mismatches between a query and a hit region was recalculated using the ClustalW program. Two or fewer mismatches in at least one strand (direct/reverse) were accepted. Then, after an extension of 13 bp at both edges,38 immature miRNAs with lengths of =1000 bp were discarded because the longest immature miRNA in the known miRNAs of the plants we used is shorter than 1000 bp. Finally, the secondary structure of the immature miRNA was predicted with UNAfold 3.2.39 The minimal folding free energy index (MFEI) was calculated for each structure using the following equation: MFEI = AMFE/(G + C)%, where the adjusted MFE (AMFE) is the minimal free energy of 100 nucleotides. All sequences with an MFEI of =0.85 were accepted as miRNAs.402.5. Gene annotationIn this study, we determined the expressed loci using two methods: FLcDNA/mRNA mapping and ab initio gene prediction with EST evidence. These methods were developed for the rice genome annotation (The Rice Annotation Project).41 Wheat FLcDNAs were downloaded from TriFLDB (http://trifldb.psc.riken.jp/index.pl, 20 September 2013, date last accessed),42 and the mRNAs and ESTs were retrieved from DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank with the keyword ‘Triticum aestivum’. FLcDNAs/mRNAs were processed by removing the poly-A sequences and repeat masking by Censor using the TREP complete annotation with the option ‘-mode norm’. Then, processed FLcDNAs/mRNAs with lengths of >29 bp after removal of the repeated regions were used for further transcript mapping.41 These sequences were mapped on assembled contigs using BLAST+ with the parameters ‘-task blastn -evalue 0.01 -lcase_masking’, and with est2genome in the EMBOSS package with the parameters ‘-align -mode both -gappenalty 8 -mismatch 6 -minscore 10’. Transcripts mapped to a contig with >95% identity and >90% cumulative coverage were accepted. Mapped regions that were masked >50% by repeat sequences were discarded from further analysis. To define the transcribed regions (loci), mapped transcripts in exonic regions with at least one base of overlap were clustered.41Ab initio gene prediction was performed with the AUGUSTUS program43 trained using the rice build 5 annotation data.44 If the predicted genic regions were relatively less masked regions (<50%), then the predicted genes were classified as ‘non-repetitive genes’. As expression evidence, we used ESTs mapped by BLASTN with =95% identity and =90% coverage on a contig.41 Regions that overlapped by at least one base with EST-mapping regions were defined as ‘proven predicted genes’.2.6. Detection of orthologues in cerealsRice annotation data were retrieved from RAP-DB (http://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/, 20 September 2013, date last accessed),44 and the data for B. distachyon and sorghum were downloaded from Phytozome (http://www.phytozome.net/, 20 September 2013, date last accessed).4,45 Barley high-confidence genes were downloaded from MIPS PlantsDB (http://mips.helmholtz-muenchen.de/plant/barley/index.jsp, 20 September 2013, date last accessed).46,47 First, all genes from the four species were mapped on the combined contigs of 6BS and 6BL by tBLASTN using the parameter ‘-e 10-5 –U T’. Second, the best pairs between a gene and a contig were selected with the top hit of the BLAST search. Third, mapped genes with 1 bp overlap were clustered on contigs.413. Results and discussion3.1. Chromosome arm sorting and DNA preparationBoth of the chromosome arms of wheat chromosome 6B were sorted as telocentric chromosomes 6BS and 6BL from a double-ditelosomic line (dDt6B) by flow cytometry (Fig. 1). The use of telosomic stocks and flow cytometric sorting permits the dissection of the large wheat genome into small and well-defined pieces, facilitating analysis and mapping.7 Chromosome arms 6BS and 6BL were flow-sorted in batches of 59,000 and 49,000, respectively, from approximately 40,000 seeds obtained from 50 dDt6B plants, and the average purity in the sorted fractions, as estimated by FISH, was 91.2 and 92.8% for 6BS and 6BL, respectively. The approximately 7–9% contamination was due to a mixture of other chromosomes. Chromosomal DNA was extracted and amplified in six independent multiple displacement amplification reactions. Finally, we obtained ~20 µg of amplified DNA from each chromosome arm for use in 454 shotgun sequencing. The histogram of the relative fluorescence intensity (flow karyotype) obtained from the flow cytometric analysis of DAPI-stained mitotic metaphase chromosomes isolated from a double-ditelosomic line 6B of the common wheat cultivar CS. The histogram consists of a chromosome 3B peak, a small composite peak I containing chromosomes 1D, 4D, and 6D, and two large composite peaks, II and III, containing the remaining 16 chromosomes. The two additional peaks represent the short-arm telosome 6BS and the long-arm telosome 6BL, which can be easily discriminated and sorted. The two telosomes can be identified by FISH with GAA microsatellite (red) and Afa repeat (green) probes (insets).

Shotgun sequencing and assembly of chromosome 6B armsThe sequencing details representing the main metrics of the 454 sequencing and the assemblies for 6BS and 6BL are summarized in Table 1. Because the estimated lengths of 6BS and 6BL were 415 and 498 Mb, respectively,10 our total read lengths, 4.94 Gb for 6BS and 5.51 Gb for 6BL, were equivalent to a sequencing depth of ~11.9- and 11.1-fold, respectively. After the sequence assembly and the removal of short contigs (<200 bp), the total lengths of the assembled contigs for 6BS and 6BL were 234.8 and 273.2 Mb, comprising 262 375 and 173 655 contigs, respectively, which corresponds to 56.6 and 54.9% of the estimated lengths of both arms. These total lengths of the assembled contigs and the coverages of the estimated chromosome size were larger than those reported for other chromosome arms: 60.9 Mb (20.6%) and 116.2 Mb (21.8%) for 5AS and 5AL, respectively13; and 146.7 Mb (46.3%) and 239.6 Mb (44.5%) for 4AS and 4AL, respectively.16 Although the number of short contigs (<200 bp) is relatively large, 43 618 and 21 978 for 6BS and 6BL, these contigs are equivalent to only 6.41 and 3.23 Mb for 6BS and 6BL, respectively, which indicates that the effect of these contigs on the total assembled length is limited. The summary of 454 sequencing reactions and assemblies for the short and long arms of chromosome 6BThe summary of 454 sequencing reactions and assemblies for the short and long arms of chromosome 6B3.3. Repeated structure of wheat chromosome 6BThe wheat genome is composed of abundant repetitive elements, and >80% of the genome is occupied by repeated sequences.3,13,15,48 Using the known TREP library and the de novo repeat library from this study, we determined that 76.6% of the 6BS assembly and 85.5% of the 6BL assembly correspond to repeat elements. More than 13% of the repetitive regions in the assemblies of both chromosome arms were masked only in the de novo repeat library. These results indicate that chromosome 6B contains novel, unannotated repeat sequences, providing important insight into the genomic structure of wheat chromosomes for future reference genomic sequencing by the IWGSC.We used the TREP library to further classify the contigs that matched known transposable elements (TEs) into TE families (or subfamilies) according to the categories of a unified classification.49 We excluded the repeated contigs in the de novo library from this classification because these contigs were not well annotated and therefore could not be integrated under the same criteria as the contigs in the TREP library. We did not observe any bias in the distribution of the repetitive elements along each arm of 6B (Fig. 2). The LTR/Gypsy family was most frequent in chromosome 6B, followed by the LTR/Copia and DNA transposon CACTA families. This distribution tendency observed in 6B is essentially conserved in other sequenced wheat chromosomes (Fig. 2). The distribution of repetitive elements in wheat chromosomes 3B, 5A, and 6B.

Only the TREP repeat data were used to categorize repetitive elements.The distribution of repetitive elements in wheat chromosomes 3B, 5A, and 6B. Repeat detection in chromosomes 3B11 and 5A13 was conducted by the same procedure used for chromosome 6B. Only the TREP repeat data were used to categorize repetitive elements.Previous survey sequencing of wheat chromosome 5A revealed that most of the contigs with high coverage rates consisted of repeated sequences.13 However, highly masked contigs do not always have higher read depths, as shown in Fig. 3, and contigs with lower read depths were sometimes repetitive. We assume that repeat sequences are not always the cause of genome degeneration in the genomic assembly, and more precise analysis is necessary for an accurate conclusion. We used FISH to obtain insight into the distribution of TEs along chromosome 6B. We selected 24 families of TEs representing major components of the transposons found in our assemblies (Fig. 2). We amplified the unique regions of these TEs using PCR (Supplementary Table S1); 20 samples yielded products of the expected size. In two cases (Thalos and Icarus), the fragment size was smaller than expected, and the primers for Jorge and Athos did not produce discrete bands by agarose gel electrophoresis; there were smear patterns for Jorge and multiple bands for Athos. FISH with a probe for the AG12 microsatellite was used to identify chromosome 6B, which has the third strongest signal in the interstitial region of the short arm (Supplementary Fig. S1). Chromosome 6B can be discriminated from chromosome 3B by the presence of satellite DNA on the short arm. The distribution patterns of transposons were represented by FISH signals with each probe, as shown in Fig. 4. All of the tested probes displayed dispersed localization patterns along the length of chromosome 6B. Notably, the NOR (nucleolus organizer region) and centromere regions lacked transposon FISH signals. We did not observe striking differences in the distribution patterns of the transposons, and these patterns were not dependent on transposon family, class, or type. Notably, the TE sequences were not restricted to the C-band/N-band-positive pericentromeric heterochromatin. We found that the distribution of some transposons were not ubiquitous in the hexaploid wheat complement (Supplementary Table S1).

Detection of transcribed regionsMore than 80,000 FLcDNAs/mRNAs and millions of ESTs are available in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank and TriFLDB public databases, facilitating wheat transcriptome analysis.42 To detect the transcribed regions and to annotate the gene structures on chromosome 6B, we mapped these transcribed sequences to our assembled contigs. Using the two methods (the transcript mapping and ab initio gene prediction) described extensively in Materials and methods, we identified 2032 and 2766 loci on 6BS and 6BL, respectively, as genic regions supported by the data from the wheat transcriptome (Table 2), comparable with the results for chromosomes 3B and 5A.11,13The statistics of the transcriptomes in the short and long arms of chromosome 6BThe statistics of the transcriptomes in the short and long arms of chromosome 6BWe analysed whether our data contained transcribed regions of the genes involved in stress response, pathogen resistance, and flowering and the genes encoding seed storage proteins and some enzymes reported to be located on wheat chromosome 6B. The a-gliadin gene (acc. no. JX141494), the stripe rust resistance gene Yr36 (EU835199), and the grain protein content gene Gpc-B1 (DQ869673) were mapped to contigs from 6BS, and the a-amylase gene (M16991) and the genes for three low-temperature-responsive dehydrins, Wcs120 (M93342), Wcs66 (L27516), and Wcor410 (L29152), were mapped to 6BL contigs. These results for the chromosomal assignment of known genes were in accordance with previous studies.25,50,51 The three homoeologous sequences containing the flowering time genes, TaHd1-1, TaHd1-2, and TaHd1-3 had been isolated from the long arm of chromosomes 6A, 6B, and 6D, respectively.52 Our analysis reconfirmed that the sequence of TaHd1-2 (AB094488) was mapped to a contig from 6BL with 100% identity, which is in good agreement with the previous report. We also examined whether the genes isolated from chromosomes 6A or 6D but not from 6B were homoeologous on chromosome 6B. The gene involved in vernalization, TmVIL2 (vernalization insensitive 3-like 2) (DQ886917), has been isolated from the diploid wheat Triticum monococcum and was mapped to the short arm of chromosome 6Am.53 We found a contig containing the whole gene sequence of VIL2 on 6BS (Supplementary Fig. S2), which indicates that the homoeologous gene copy of TmVIL2 is conserved on chromosome 6B in hexaploid wheat. These mapping data support our survey sequences of wheat chromosome 6B, which contain previously reported genic regions and are useful for mining the genes located on chromosome 6B.3.5. Identification of the genes for functional non-protein-coding RNAsThe short arm of wheat chromosome 6B is characterized by the presence of satellite and a secondary constriction, NOR (nucleolus organizer region), as is chromosome 1B,22 which features a rDNA locus that contains approximately 5500 rRNA genes.26 To explore the structure of the rDNA region, we searched for contigs with homology to sequences corresponding to the 5S, 5.8S, 18S, and 25S rDNAs and a spacer sequence between 18S and 25S. From the 6BS assembled sequences, we found only eight contigs that showed homology to any sequence with >95% identity and >100 bp alignment. However, seven of these contigs exhibited extremely high read depths (73.7–203.8) (Table 3). Because the average read depth observed for 6BS was 9.05, the high depth rates indicate that these contigs represent sequences with high copy numbers. This result demonstrates that rDNA regions, including spacer sequences, were assembled in a few contigs because of high sequence similarity under functional constraint. In general, spacer sequences are more diverse than rDNA sequences because of a low functional constraint. In our study, the spacer sequences contained four repeat families that can be a source of additional diversification.54 Nevertheless, the rDNA regions consistently have high read depths in our survey sequencing, which suggests that concerted evolution occurred in this region, although the possibility that the rDNA regions were duplicated recently cannot be excluded. Contigs containing rDNA on the short arm of chromosome 6BContigs containing rDNA on the short arm of chromosome 6BWe detected 213 and 167 predicted tRNA genes in 6BS and 6BL, respectively. In both chromosome arms, the tRNALys gene was the most abundant, followed by the genes for tRNAMet (Fig. 5). Such a skewed distribution of tRNA genes was not observed in any of the syntenic chromosomes to wheat chromosome 6 in other grass species, e.g. chromosome 2 of Oryza sativa, chromosome 3 of B. distachyon, and chromosome 4 of Sorghum bicolor. We hypothesized that the expansion of a particular tRNA gene could be caused by repetitive elements, that is, if one tRNA gene is located in a repetitive region, the copy number of the gene increases dramatically along the propagation of the repetitive sequence. As expected, 83 of 131 tRNALys genes on chromosome 6B were located in an LTR retrotransposon, Gypsy, or de novo repeats. Although the details of the de novo repeats containing tRNALys are not clear, tRNA expansion could occur through repetitive elements. Because 86.7% of tRNAs located in repeat regions were tRNALys or tRNAMet, the skewed distribution of the tRNA genes on wheat chromosome 6B can be explained by the expansion of repetitive elements containing specific tRNA genes.

Pseudogenes were excluded, and tRNAs covered by repetitive elements were included.miRNAs are a class of small RNAs that mediate gene silencing at the post-transcriptional level.55 Only 42 wheat miRNAs are stored in miRBase as of release 19,37 which is significantly fewer than the number for other grass plants (rice: 708, maize: 321, sorghum: 242, and Brachypodium: 136). These observations suggest that more miRNA genes remain to be identified in the wheat genome. To find known/novel miRNA genes in our assembly, we conducted a homology search in miRBase using known plant miRNAs. A total of 2906 miRNAs (1381 loci on 6BS and 1525 loci on 6BL) were predicted using 350 mature plant miRNAs in miRBase as queries (Table 4). Some miRNAs are located in repeat regions,14,16 as has been observed for tRNA genes. Consistent with these previous reports, all but 26 of the predicted miRNA genes are located in repeat-masked regions. Especially, 1805 miRNA genes were located in a DNA transposon, Mariner, and 766 genes were located in CACTA repeats. Even though the LTR retrotransposons Gypsy and Copia were distributed most widely on both arms, only 63 miRNA genes were located in these transposons. These results indicate that miRNA genes propagate in the wheat genome with the diffusion of specific transposons, although which of the predicted miRNA genes are transcribed into mature miRNAs has not been determined.

Comparative analysis of syntenic chromosomes to wheat 6B among monocot speciesThe barley genome sequence was recently reported,46 and the annotation data for this species can be used as a possible gene set as the closest relative of wheat. Of the 26 159 high-confidence genes in barley, 2573 loci are located on chromosome 6H. Mapping barley genes to our wheat 6B assembly revealed that 2399 genes had significant hits on 2070 loci of wheat 6B (E-value < 10-5). Chromosome arm information is available for 423 and 313 genes located in chromosome 6HS and 6HL, respectively; therefore, we compared these barley genes with the arm information of our wheat assembles. We found that 380 of 423 6HS genes (89.8%) mapped to chromosome 6BS, and 246 of 313 6HL genes (78.6%) mapped to chromosome 6BL. Based on these data, we concluded that our assemblies provide good coverage of the transcribed regions, which were supported by the synteny with barley chromosome 6H. However, chromosome arm information is still missing for more than two-thirds of the genes on 6H; therefore, we cannot analyse the syntenic relationship between wheat 6B and barley 6H more precisely.We also compared the wheat 6B assemblies with the annotation data for monocot plant species such as O. sativa, B. distachyon, and S. bicolor to identify homologous regions. Our search indicated that 8783 loci from the three monocot plants were possibly homologous to wheat 6B contigs, and 3880 of which were found in all four genomes (Fig. 6). Wheat homoeologous group 6 chromosomes have a synteny with chromosome 2 of O. sativa (Os02), chromosome 3 of B. distachyon (Bradi3), and chromosome 4 of S. bicolor (Sb04).56,57 Our results demonstrated that 3772 loci were syntenic to at least one of the syntenic chromosomes of the three monocot plants. The mapping ratio of syntenic genes (40.2–59.7% between our annotated loci and those of syntenic chromosomes in the other three species) was comparable with the total coverage of our assembly for wheat chromosome 6 (55.6%). The distributions of the genes found on chromosome 6B with significant similarity to O. sativa, B. distachyon, and S. bicolor.

The numbers in parentheses represent loci on which genes from syntenic chromosomes were mapped.To verify the reliability of these loci, we assessed the wheat transcriptome evidence, such as wheat FLcDNA/mRNAs and predicted genes with EST evidence. We found that 57.4% of the syntenic regions had transcriptome evidence, which was significantly higher than the value for non-syntenic regions (32.7%). In particular, the regions syntenic to all three monocot species were highly supported by the transcriptome data (79.9%). These results confirmed that wheat chromosome 6 has conserved synteny with the chromosomes of other grass species at the sequence level.4. ConclusionsHere, we have provided the whole-chromosome shotgun sequence of wheat chromosome 6B, which provides an overview of the sequence features of this chromosome, including rDNA regions, a characteristic structure of wheat 6B, and we present new information about the TEs, expressed genes that are syntenic in other phylogenetically related species, and non-protein-coding tRNA and miRNA genes. We are now conducting on the reference genome sequencing of chromosome 6B using the MTP BACs within the framework of the IWGSC. However, filling the sequence gaps and evaluating the quality of the assembly data using only one data set may be difficult. This survey sequence provides valuable information for completing the genome assembly as well as the mate-pair sequencing, which is also now underway. Furthermore, the survey sequence information in this study will be directly used to identify 6B genes that can be exploited to control agronomically important traits and to construct DNA markers for these traits.

IntroductionMicrobial symbionts of mammals are ubiquitous, taxonomically diverse and highly abundant.1 Moreover, the word symbiont is used advisedly: among their many roles, gut microbes are critical in extracting nutrition for their hosts from the varied mammalian diets,2 with both diet and host phylogeny being necessary predictors for understanding gut microbe diversity.3,4 The complement of these organisms varies by individual within a species,5 and this variation can alter host phenotypes,6,7 a fact that makes understanding the diversity and function of these organisms of more than ecological interest.Although other techniques are becoming available,8 the majority of current metagenomic studies have employed the sequence of the 16S subunit of the prokaryotic ribosome for taxa identification.9 This gene is appealing as it should be universal and permits the use of generic PCR primers that allow amplification from very diverse taxa in a single thermocycler reaction.1 As such, sequencing of 16S genes avoids the very serious biases inherent in any approach to microbial diversity that requires culturing.1,9–12 More recently, it has become possible to shotgun sequence raw metagenomic samples at high depth,8,13 presumably avoiding the potential for PCR-based artefacts that can occur when directly amplifying the 16S gene14 and allowing researchers to more fully explore the genic diversity of this ecosystem.Such ecosystem probing may be especially rewarding when studying ruminants, because they are particularly dependent on their gut microbial symbionts. The reason for this dependence is that the cellulose and other plant materials that form the basis of their diets cannot be degraded by enzymes encoded in their own genomes.2 Instead, many different microbial taxa9,15 are responsible for producing a variety of enzymes that break down these plant cell components.8,13 Thus, in addition to the health-related concerns seen in microbiome studies in humans,5 understanding the microbiome of domestic animals has ecological and economic relevance.The complement of microbes in the rumen can alter several host phenotypes: both the overall microbe composition and the distribution of methanogenic microbes differ between cattle with high efficiency of converting ingested food into biomass and those with lesser efficiency.15,16 The precise nature of the animal's diet also directly influences the gut microbiota. In cattle, there are clear differences in the relative abundances of different microbial taxa (hereafter microbial distributions), depending on the type of grass consumed.17,18Here, we sought to better understand how diet alters rumen microbial diversity, using a shotgun sequencing approach that allowed deep sampling of microbial diversity across multiple individuals. Our goal was to understand the structural differences between two ecosystems, each defined by the host diet.2. Methods2.1. Animal trial and DNA sample collectionGrowing wethers (n = 77; initial body weight = 51.3 ± 1.2 kg) of Rambouillet, Hampshire, and Suffolk breed types were randomly allocated by body weight to receive either a concentrate- (CONCEN: 50% corn, 31% wheat middlings, yielding a measured dietary intake of 91.6% dry matter including 12.1% crude protein, 17.6% neutral detergent fibre, and a mean energy of 2.98 Mcal/kg; n = 39 animals) or forage-based (FORG: 67.7% alfalfa, 27.5% wheat middlings, yielding a measured dietary intake of 92.3% dry matter including 16.2% crude protein, 36.3% neutral detergent fibre, and a mean energy of 2.31 Mcal/kg; n = 38 animals) pelleted diet. Lambs were acclimated to diets using a 20% increase in the proportion of new-to-old feed every 4–5 days until the diet consisted of 100% new pelleted diet ad libitum. To give the clearest sense of the microbial diversity across these two diets, individuals were selected for metagenomic sequencing based on their rate of body weight gain relative to feed intake. To do so, individual feed intake was measured using the GrowSafe System for a 49-day trial period. Two-day average initial and final body weights were obtained to calculate daily gain. We used residual feed intake (RFI) in order to select 16 animals for metagenomic sequencing. Thus, RFI was calculated as the deviation of true feed intake from expected feed intake. Expected feed intake was determined by regressing daily gain and metabolic midweight on actual feed intake.19 RFI calculations were used to rank wether efficiency. Rumen fluid samples were collected at the end of the feeding trial and frozen at -80°C. DNA was then extracted from the fluid of the 10% most (n = 4, low RFI) and the 10% least (n = 4, high RFI) efficient wethers from each diet (eight animals per diet, n = 16).2.2. DNA extraction and library preparationSterilized zirconia (0.3 g of 0.1 mm) and silicon (0.1 g of 0.5 mm) beads and 1 ml of lysis buffer were added to thawed rumen fluid samples, and tubes were homogenized using a Mini-Beadbeater-8 at maximum speed for 3 min, incubated at 70°C for 15 min with gentle mixing every 5 min, and centrifuged at 4°C for 5 min. Supernatant was transferred into new 2-ml flat cap tubes and fresh lysis buffer was added to the pelleted beads. The homogenization, incubation, and centrifugation were repeated, and the supernatants were pooled. Precipitation of nucleic acids, removal of RNA and proteins, and purification were completed using the protocol of the QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA, USA). Genomic libraries from these 16 samples were constructed following the manufacturer's recommended protocol with reagents supplied in Illumina's DNA sample preparation kit. Briefly, genomic DNA was sheared using standard Diagenode BioRuptor methods to generate fragment sizes of ~300 bp. The resulting 3' and 5' overhangs were removed by an end-repair reaction that uses a 3'- to 5'-exonuclease activity and polymerase activity to blunt the fragment ends. A single adenosine nucleotide was added to the 3' ends of the blunt fragment followed by the ligation of Illumina adapters. The resulting adapter-ligated fragments were size selected on an agarose gel. Fragments of ~420 bp were excised from the gel and recovered from the gel slice by elution and ethanol precipitation as described by the Illumina protocol. Each purified library was quantified with a Qubit assay and library fragment size confirmed by the Agilent BioAnalyzer High Sensitivity DNA assay.2.3. Metagenomic sequencing, quality filtering, and identification of novel 16S genesLibraries were diluted and sequenced according to Illumina's standard sequencing protocol on a HiSeq 2000. The 16 libraries were multiplexed four libraries per lane, resulting in 100 bp, paired-end sequences. The mean insert size across the 16 samples was 309 bp, corresponding to an unsequenced insert between reads of ~109 bp. Raw sequence reads are available from NCBI's short read archive (Project SRP028527).Paired-end reads were quality filtered by truncating each read after the first run of three bases, with a phred quality score of <15.20 From the filtered reads, any read pair where one or both reads were <85 bases long or had an average quality score of <25 was omitted. The resulting reads represent 96 gigabases of sequence.We then used the software package EMIRGE21 to identify potentially unknown 16S rDNA sequences in these data. EMIRGE uses a reference 16S database (see below) and the Bowtie alignment tool22 to identify sequence reads that are potentially derived from 16S rDNA genes. It then iteratively constructs a set of new consensus 16S sequences found in the metagenomic sample, but not in the reference database.2.4. Classification of 16S rDNA-derived readsTo identify reads derived from 16S rDNA genes, we compared the filtered reads to two distinct reference databases of 16S rDNA genes. The first database (16S_Ref) was constructed by combining the Ribosomal Database collection of sequences23 and the set of 16S rDNA genes from the sequenced prokaryotic genomes at NCBI GenBank.24 Identical sequences were purged from the database, as were sequences of <1450 bases long and those with undetermined nucleotides (e.g. ‘N's), resulting in a final database of 27 290 sequences. The second database (16S_Merge) comprised the union of 16S_Ref and the novel 16S sequences identified above with EMIRGE. We then used Bowtie22 to align reads from our 16 animals to these two databases. For both the forward and reverse reads, we required at least 97% sequence identity between the read and the database sequences. We retained both the best hit for each read and a second list of all database sequences, where both members of a read pair aligned with a =97% sequence identity. This second list was retained in order to perform the sequence clustering and operational taxonomic unit (OTU) identification described below. In Table 1, we list the number of identified bacterial individuals in each sample that met these criteria.

In each case, we performed single-linkage clustering using custom software. To do so, we first computed all possible pairwise global alignments between the genes using our new GPU-based global pairwise alignment package.25,26 We next created a graph where each node was a 16S rDNA gene. We defined edges between pairs of genes if their pairwise global sequence identity was =97%.27 We then defined the OTUs to be the connected components in this graph.Using in-house perl scripts, we mapped these OTUs back onto the reads, using each read pair's top hit to assign that pair to an OTU. We identified 349 OTUs using 16S_Ref and 992 OTUs with 16S_Merge (Table 1). To test whether the percentage of reads mapped onto the rDNA database was the same for the two feed groups, we fit the number of reads mapped over the total number of reads to a binomial distribution, first requiring that proportion of reads mapped (p) be the same for both groups, then allowing p to differ between diets. Twice the difference in ln-likelihood for these models was compared with a <U+03C7>2 distribution with one degree of freedom (e.g. a likelihood ratio test).282.5. Phylum-level analysisUsing the taxonomic names from the 16S_Ref database, we analysed the phyla-level distribution of our OTUs, mapping each prokaryotic taxa or genus name to the NCBI taxonomy database29 to retrieve the corresponding phylum.2.6. Statistical comparison of metagenome populations between individuals differing in dietWhere p is a parameter to be estimated. Thus, in both cases, we have reduced the problem from estimating n - 1 parameters to estimating one parameter. To do so, we fit the observed OTU counts to these models by maximum-likelihood. The likelihood of an entire sample of animals L is then given by the product of the Djs from (2). We estimate a or p using numerical optimization to find the value that maximizes L.32Now that the data have been placed into a modelling framework, we can use the models to ask if different samples follow different multinomial distributions. To test for differences between the samples due to diet, we adopted a partitioning and randomization approach. First, we divided the OTU distributions into the two dietary groups: FORG and CONCEN described above. We then individually calculated ln(LF) for FORG and ln(LC) for CONCEN and computed D= [ln(LF) + ln(LC)]–ln(L). Note that FORG and CONCEN differ from the full dataset potentially in both the rankings of the 349 or 992 OTUs and the value of a or p. Thus, D is a measure of how much samples FORG and CONCEN differ. To assess if the observed difference would be expected by chance, we randomly repartitioned the full dataset A into samples of the same size as CONCEN and FORG 1000 times. For each such randomization, we calculated the value of Drand. If D for the real dataset is exceeded by not more than 5% of the values of Drand, we can statistically conclude that there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis of the same species distribution in CONCEN and FORG.2.7. Identifying OTU-level differences between feedsThe above approach only indicates whether or not the two feed groups are statistically distinguishable. It cannot describe the particular OTUs that drive this difference. In order to do so, we slightly modified our model to consist of three distinct multinomial distributions of the form of (1): MS, MF, and MC. Each distribution has its own value of a or p. Among the n OTUs, each can either be assigned to the shared distribution (MS) or to the distinct distributions (MF and MC): this assignment is coded as a binary vector |$\overline S $| of length n. The likelihood of a sample is then the product of the likelihood of the shared OTUs (si = 0) under MS and the distinct OTUs (si = 1) under either MF or MC, depending on the feed treatment for that sample. There are 2n possible values of |$\overline S $|<U+2060>, and we used our previously described simulated annealing software to search for the combination of the entries of|$\overline S $| and the values of the three a’s or p's that give the maximum likelihood of observing the data collected.33 We also compared the proportion of individuals who were members of the Methanobacteria group between the two feeds using the same binomial model used to test the read-mapping proportion.3. ResultsUsing Illumina sequencing, we obtained >480 million paired-end reads from the rumen metagenomes of 16 sheep. We used two strategies for analysing the microbial taxonomic diversity present in these animals. First, by mapping the reads to known 16S rDNA genes (16S_Ref, Methods), we identified 349 known prokaryotic OTUs present in at least one of our 16 animals (Methods; Table 1). Secondly, by using the EMIRGE package,21 we assembled probabilistic consensus sequences for new 16S rDNA genes (16S_Merge), resulting in between a 2- and 4-fold increase in the number of reads identified as coming from 16S rDNA genes and roughly a 3-fold increase in the number of OTUs seen (Table 1).In keeping with EMIRGE's described function of identifying new 16S rDNA sequences, <2% of the OTUs derived from EMIRGE 16S rDNA assemblies also included sequences from the existing database, strongly suggesting the presence of many unknown taxa in these samples.When considering gross, phylum-level differences between the animals in known taxa (16S_Ref), there is a clear distinction between the two feed conditions (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, the proportion of Illumina reads mapped onto 16S_Merge was roughly 2-fold higher among the concentrate-fed animals (1 in 2100 versus 1 in 5200), a significant difference (P < 10-10, likelihood ratio test, Methods). This bias is not attributable to an overall lower efficiency in obtaining DNA from these animals, as the raw number of reads obtained for each group is comparable (Table 1).

(A) Phylum-level breakdown of the microbial diversity, showing the top seven detected phyla for genes drawn from the 16S_Ref database (Methods).

We fit two statistical distributions to these data: a discrete power-law (purple) and a geometric (green; Methods).

Here, the power-law distribution is a better statistical fit (ln-likelihood of -416 927 and -380 366 for the geometric and power-law distributions, respectively).Methane production is a topic of considerable current interest,34 and consequently, we sought to assess if the abundance of methanogenic microbes differed between the two diet groups. As can be seen from Fig. 1A, there is considerable variation in the proportion of archaeans among the samples. All of these individuals were derived from one class among the Euryarchaeota, namely the Methanobacteria: they are indicated in pink in Fig. 1A. Nevertheless, on average, there are significantly more such microbes in animals administered a forage diet (P < 10-10; likelihood ratio test), a fact potentially related to the lowering of rumen pH under concentrate-type diets.35To explore these differences in a rigorous statistical manner, we examined the relative abundance differences between samples (Fig. 1B and C). To assess whether there were systematic differences in the OTU abundances depending on feed source, we fit maximum-likelihood models of species abundances to our 16 samples under both an assumed power-law and geometric distribution of rank abundances (Methods). We first asked if the animals fed concentrate diets showed differing OTU distributions than did those fed forage diets. For both the power-law and geometric models, there was a significant improvement in fit by allowing the two feed groups to have their own multinomial distributions (P < 0.001 using either 16S_Ref or 16S_Merge).This observed improvement in fit could result from a range of circumstances, from a large difference in abundance for a few OTUs to nearly non-overlapping OTU for the two treatments. Therefore, to understand the source of these differences, we applied a partitioning model that broke the OTUs down into two groups, one for which abundance was similar in both treatments and one for which each treatment had an independent abundance rank for that OTU (Methods). This approach is most appropriate when the OTUs analysed can be mapped to known taxa, and so we applied it to the OTUs found with 16S_Ref. We sought the maximum-likelihood arrangement of OTUs into these two groups. The two treatments are generally different in their most abundant OTUs (Fig. 2C and D: c.f. to A), with a group of more rarely observed OTUs with similar (low) abundances between the two treatments (Fig. 2B). Distinct sets of high-abundance taxa between forage- and concentrate-fed animals are overlaid on a common core of rare organisms. For each panel, the x-axis gives the rank of each OTU (according the scheme for that panel), whereas the y-axis is the frequency of that OTU in a particular animal. Unlike Fig. 1B, here only genes matching to 16S_Ref are included (Methods). (A) The OTU distribution seen when all animals' OTU frequencies are plotted against the average OTU abundance across all 16 animals. The predicted abundance curves from our power-law and geometric distributions provide a visually very poor fit to the data, with obvious differences in abundance between the two feed groups (red, forage and blue, concentrate). (B–D) A machine-learning approach was applied to partition the set of 349 OTUs into either a ‘shared’ group common to both feeds or a feed-specific group (Methods). Generally speaking, this approach placed the abundant taxa into feed-specific groups (C: forage-feed animals, FORG; D: concentrate-fed animals, CONCEN), while there was a set of low-abundance microbes that did not appear to differ between the feeds. Thus, in C and D, the OTUs are individually ranked for the forage- and concentrate-fed animals, while in B, both groups share a common ranking. Note that, unlike Fig. 1, this partitioning approach yields curves that visually match the geometric distribution well.

Discussion4.1. High diversity in sheep ruminal metagenomes, with strong distinctions due to dietWe highlight two key findings from our analyses of rumen metagenomic DNA from sheep. First, there is evidence for a large number of currently unclassified microbes in this environment. EMIRGE predicted a number of new 16S rDNA sequences that do not cluster with existing sequences in the 16S database, and these sequences represent the majority of the 16S rDNA reads identified. Secondly, there are large differences in microbial distributions between the two diets examined, regardless of the 16S database used (16S_Merge, Fig. 1B and C and 16S_Ref, Supplementary Fig. S1).4.2. Comparing microbial diversity across individual animalsMany discussions of the rumen microbial community quantify the complexity of the microbial community in terms of the number of species or OTUs.9,14,17,18 Here, we have chosen not to use that metric for several reasons. First, and trivially, the highly skewed distributions of the form of Fig. 1 suggest that while there may be a large number of lowly abundant taxa, it seems unreasonable to believe that the major differences between animals or diets result from these rare individuals. Secondly, most communities are described by two inter-related parameters, the richness (related to the number of taxa present) and the evenness (describing those taxa's relative abundance). Species abundance curves link these two concepts with a probability distribution, allowing fair comparisons between samples.36 Finally, we believe that the methods used to define OTUs in metagenomic contexts are unstable relative to sample size. We, like other researchers, have defined OTUs based on a 97% or greater sequence identity in the 16S rDNA gene. While this approach is sensible, it rests on an implicit network clustering approach whereby sequences are first linked by sequence identity, followed by a clustering step that defines connected components in a graph and hence OTUs (see Methods). However, adding sequences increases the chance of a new sequence bridging two previously separate OTUs. Thus, we expect that larger samples, while increasing the OTU count with new taxa, will also tend to compress that count through OTU merging. This effect is unlikely to have serious consequences in most cases, but it does mean that the OTU counts for different studies should not be directly compared. Our results are also unusual in that, because of our Illumina-based approach, we clustered not the sequence data but rather the ~9000 database sequences that those reads matched to (Methods). As a result, our OTU estimates should not be compared with PCR-based analyses.17,184.3. CaveatsOur Illumina sequencing-based approach has different biases than do culture or PCR-based methods. Our read-mapping strategy precludes the identification of taxa with 16S genes <97% identical to known samples. This limitation is likely the reason that, although we had similar numbers of sequence reads for the two diets, the number of identified 16S genes was lower in the forage-fed group (Table 1). Likewise, because we did not sequence entire 16S genes, it is possible that certain OTUs might contain individuals who, while having 97% identity in some regions of the gene, are more dissimilar in other regions. Fortunately, this bias is constant across our samples. Another issue with all 16S-based approaches is that 16S copy number is taken as a proxy for microbe abundance, even though 16S copy number is not constant across genomes. Again, this effect should not bias our analyses, because it influences them all equally. Finally, the EMRIGE approach, while powerful, has a few shortcomings. First, the sequences inferred do not necessarily represent particular microbes from the sample, but are rather consensus inferences. It is therefore potentially dangerous to try to place them in a phylogenetic context. Moreover, the EMIRGE pipeline requires known 16S rDNA sequences as input: there still may be highly diverged 16S rDNA that have been missed.Our results differ in detail somewhat from a previous analysis of the bacterial composition of both forage and concentrate-fed sheep that focused on the genus Prevotella.37 These authors found a higher percentage of Prevotella individuals in concentrate-fed animals, in contrast to our results finding that Prevotella was the dominant genus in forage-, but not concentrate-, fed animals (Fig. 2). Given the very different methods employed, it is difficult to know what to make of this difference. While the majority of the Prevotella found in an earlier bovine survey were from taxa not in 16S_Ref,38 they are unlikely to represent the most common OTUs here, since none of the five most abundant 16S rDNA sequences produced by EMIRGE had Prevotella as the strongest BLAST hit (data not shown). We note, however, that the general conclusion in both cases was that there was a greater diversity in the forage group.374.4. Diet-based differences in highly abundant microbes derived from a common core of taxaAs an alternative to the OTU counting approach mentioned above, we have described microbial diversity in terms of simple mathematical models (Figs 1 and 2). One apparent trend is the presence of a universal rare ‘core’ of organisms present in both groups (Fig. 2B). It is possible that this core is the result insufficient statistical power in our model. However, inspection of Fig. 2 shows some taxa with clear separation between the feeds (e.g. Prevotella ruminicola and Dialister succinatiphilus in Fig. 2A) and others with overlapping distributions (e.g. Selenomonas bovis in Fig. 2B). Instead, we suggest that another possibility is that a relatively large number of new microbial individuals enter the rumen, a suggestion supported by the observation that there are almost no OTUs of high abundance in one animal that are not at least found occasionally in all the other animals. Indeed, in only two microbial groups (Parascardovia denticolens and Allisonella histaminiformans) were 100 or more microbial individuals present in one feed group, with no individuals being present in the other. Thus, under this common inputs hypothesis, the observed differences are not a result of differences in microbes entering the system, but rather in the niches available to them when they arrive.In support of this idea of reasonably high microbe turnover is the fact that the two diets differ not only in the OTUs present, but also in the nature of the taxa abundance curves. When the diets are treated separately (Fig. 1) and all 16S rDNA sequences are used, the microbial ecosystem induced by the forage diet is clearly more diverse than that induced by the concentrate diet (a ‘flatter’ power-law curve in Fig. 1B for the forage diet versus Fig. 1C and the concentrate-fed animals). This result may appear to contradict the data of Fig. 2C and D, where the forage diet has a rumen community that is dominated by a single OTU (P. ruminicola). However, we believe that this apparent discrepancy results from the fact that the reference database used in that figure (e.g. 16S_Ref) more poorly represents the highest abundance taxa from the forage environment than from the concentrate-induced one. Thus, the slope seen in Fig. 1B implies that the forage diet has a greater diversity of rare OTUs relative to Fig. 1C. This fact can be observed in Table 1, where the ‘long-tailed’ distribution of abundances means that there are more total OTUs observed among the forage-fed animals, despite these animals having many fewer total individuals.The ecological literature on species richness (the number of OTUs present in our case) and species evenness (whether the numbers of individuals of those species are present in relatively equal numbers) is considerable.39–41 However, the exact role of species evenness, in particular, is complex and incompletely understood.39 Under some conditions, such as a constant environment, dominance by a few taxa may increase productivity.42 However, if the environment is more complex (e.g. certain local regions are more suitable to different taxa, or the environment changes in time), greater evenness of taxa abundance (less dominance) will improve productivity.42,43 One can make a plausible argument that the variety and complexity of the nutrients in a forage diet are greater, yielding greater evenness in the OTU abundances. On the other hand, the rumen is a system that has adapted over a long period for forage-like diets, and the differences seen might also be due to this fact. It would be most helpful to develop theories and tests able to distinguish between these two hypotheses.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by the USDA National Research Initiative (NRI) (grant 2011-68006-30185).The authors thank R.

IntroductionIn general, two cytoplasmic organelles in plants have their own genomes: chloroplast and mitochondria. These organelles have been thought to have ac-quired these genomes via endosymbiotic mechanism during the early evolution of eukaryotic species.1,2 Chloroplasts are considered to have originated from cyanobacteria, although their genome size (around 150 kb) and gene number (about 100 protein-coding genes) are remarkably reduced compared with those of cyanobacteria (genome size, around 7 Mb; gene number: more than 5000 protein-coding genes).3,4 The major parts of the chloroplast genome were simply eliminated since they were redundant with the nuclear genes. Furthermore, some other parts of the cytoplasmic genome had been transferred to the nuclear genome, and the original ones were lost.3,5 The transfer of DNA fragments occurred between three genomes, although the direction of transfer was not uniform. Transfer from the cytoplasmic-to-nuclear genome is considerably higher than the opposite, and transfer between organelle genomes is considered to be rare.6,7 The pattern of chloroplast DNA integration in the nuclear genome (so-called nuclear plastid DNA: NUPT) has been investigated in several species, and the mechanism of their integration and genomic organizations has been analysed in detail.7,8The transfer of DNA fragments from the chloroplast-to-nuclear genome is still active.9–11 The actual transfer rate was estimated to be about one per 16,000 pollen grains (about 6 × 10–5 per pollen grain)9 or one per 5 × 106 cells (2 × 10-7 per cell)11 by measuring functional gene integration into the nuclear genome. When the length and functional ability of genes were considered, the total transfer rate of DNA fragments from the chloroplast-to-nuclear genome would be higher than that estimated by direct experiments.9,11,12 The transfer of chloroplast fragments occurred via both simple and complex structural organizations.10 These fragments form continuous, rearranged, inter-chromosomal rearranged, and mosaic structured patterns in the nuclear genome.6 NUPTs also tend to be located close to each other,13 suggesting simultaneous integration and/or biased integration preferences.14 Although the integration mechanism of de novo NUPTs is still not completely elucidated, non-homologous recombination and/or non-homologous end joining of double-strand break repair are suggested to be the integration mechanism as any other extra-nuclear genome DNAs.15,16 The integration mainly occurs during male gametogenesis17 and is increased by environmental stresses.18,19 After the chloroplast DNA fragments became integrated into the nuclear genome, newly formed NUPTs are sometimes unstable and are lost rapidly.20 Even though some NUPTs escape from the early unstable stage, they are fragmented and eliminated from the genome.13,14,21Although the integration mechanisms, genomic organization, and evolution of NUPTs have been analysed in detail, most studies were performed using Oryza sativa and Arabidopsis thaliana.3,14,21–23 Despite frequent transfer and loss of genomic regions during evolution, the size and structure of the chloroplast genome is conserved among species, facilitating the elucidation of the general trend of DNA fragment transfer. Furthermore, because of its simple structure, chloroplast genome sequences have been determined from much more species, unlike mitochondrial genomes. In recent years, whole-genome sequences of >20 phylogenetically diverse plants have been published. Presently, estimating the genomic organization of NUPTs in these plant species has become possible, facilitating an understanding of the general rules of structural patterns and evolutionary history of NUPTs. Here, we report the amounts and structures of NUPTs from 17 plant species and discuss the general patterns that underlie the acquisition, maintenance, and elimination of nuclear-localized chloroplast DNA fragments.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Data usedOf the species whose whole-genome sequences have been reported, 7 with sequences for all 3 genomes (nuclear, chloroplast, and mitochondrial) and 10 with nuclear and chloroplast genome sequences were used in this study. Because there are some similarities between chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes, the former seven species were analysed in detail to estimate the pseudo-positive detection rate of NUPTs that were possibly originated from the mitochondrial genome. These seven species were as follows: A. thaliana,24,25Carica papaya,26Vitis vinifera,27,28Lotus japonicus,29,30O. sativa,31,32Sorghum bicolor,33,34 and Zea mays.35,36 The species with the data for nuclear and chloroplast genomes were as follows: Medicago truncatula,37Glycine max,38,39Manihot esculenta,40,41Ricinus communis,42,43Populus trichocarpa,44Cucumis sativus,45,46Fragaria vesca,47Solanum lycopersicum,48,49Solanum tuberosum,50,51 and Brachypodium distachyon.52,532.2. Identification of NUPTsThe organelle genome sequences of each species were used as query to conduct BLAST search against nuclear genome sequences available in July 2012. In many cases, NCBI BLAST server was used; and bulk data downloaded from Phytozome ver 8.054 or species-specific websites (L. japonicus, F. vesca, S. tuberosum, and S. lycopersicum) were also used to conduct local BLAST searches. The sequence dataset used in this study is listed in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2. In this study, only BLAST hits with 100 bp and longer in length and 90% and more identity to the chloroplast genome sequences were used for the following analyses. Because NUPTs were present as fragmented and mosaic structures, some sequences detected by BLAST search were very short. BLAST scores tend to be low for short-length homologous sequences; therefore, we used sequence identities as cut-off criteria. These criteria might have limited our analysis to only relatively recent transfer events.BLAST hits for the NUPTs found within inverted repeat regions of the chloroplast genome were obtained in both inverted repeat regions and could not be distinguished. These BLAST hits were counted only once. Some BLAST hits were found at the edge of the inverted repeat region and were also present on the other side of the inverted repeat over a single copy region. These sequences were counted in the latter position only.2.3. Identification of regions of NUPT origin on the chloroplast genomeThe chloroplast genomic region from where NUPTs originated was identified by assigning each identified NUPT to a chloroplast sequence. If NUPTs existed within inverted repeat regions, they were simply counted as half. After BLAST hits were assigned, the number of NUPTs was counted on each nucleotide site of the chloroplast genome. The differences in the presence of NUPTs between inverted repeat regions and single copy regions were tested by the Welch two-sample t-test.2.4. Estimation of age distributionFor each identified NUPT, the sequence identity to chloroplast genome was calculated. Although plant organelle genome is known to have a low- (1/10th) mutation rate compared with the nuclear genome,55–57 the exact nuclear/chloroplast mutation rate ratio is still unclear. Furthermore, because mutation directions differ between nucleotides in NUPTs,58,59 simple correction methods of genetic distances cannot be applied. Thus, p-distance was used to estimate the time of NUPT integration event (relative age). By using p-distances, the estimated age should represent relative age but not reflect true integration time. If natural selection affected evolution of the NUPTs, the substitution rate should vary especially if mutations were advantageous.2.5. Characterization of flanking regions of NUPTs on the chromosomesIn the species analysed in this study, detailed information about transposons was obtained for A. thaliana, O. sativa, and Z. mays from Repbase.60 For these species, the number of transposable elements (TEs) in the vicinity of NUPTs was estimated using the program RepeatMasker ver.4.0.1 (available from: http://www.repeatmasker.org/) to investigate the features of the integrated regions of NUPTs. In all, 5-kb sequences from both 5' and 3' flanking regions of NUPTs were extracted. The number of each type of TE within the regions was estimated using RepeatMasker in the default mode. For comparison, the number of TEs within randomly extracted regions from genomes was estimated to compare with those found in the vicinities of NUPTs.Some genomes retained NUPTs with substantial length and relatively low identities (i.e. predicted to be long-lived after insertion). In this study, NUPTs more than 5 kb in length with identities from 90 to 96% were considered as long-lived NUPTs. Flanking 5-kb regions were surveyed to analyse the surrounding region of long-lived NUPTs. Such long-lived NUPTs tended to be surrounded by other NUPTs or repeat sequences. First, the presence of other NUPTs surrounding long-lived NUPTs was verified. When long-lived NUPTs formed clusters with other NUPTs, the outer regions of such NUPT clusters were analysed as flanking regions of long-lived NUPTs. The occurrence of repeat sequences in the flanking region of long-lived NUPTs was analysed. Flanking 5-kb regions were used as query to conduct BLAST search against each nuclear genome sequence. If the entire or partial sequences in the 5-kb flanking regions were found >10 times in the whole genome, such sequences were tentatively defined as repeat sequences. The number of such repeat sequences in the flanking region was estimated.3. Results and Discussion3.1. Number and amount of NUPTs in plant speciesThe identified nuclear genome fragments similar to the chloroplast genome included several fragments that were also similar to the mitochondrial genome. Thus, we first estimated a proportion of sequences similar to both chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes (Table 1). Then, we estimated a proportion of NUPTs that are also similar to the mitochondrial genome. The results indicated that the values depended on the similarity between chloroplast and mitochondrial genome sequences. The proportion of indistinguishable sequences varied from 0.2 (L. japonicus) to 38.1% (V. vinifera) that were similar to that of sequences similar between chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes. The exceptions were A. thaliana and O. sativa. Arabidopsis thaliana had almost whole mitochondrial genome integration on Chromosome 261 that caused inflation of the proportion of indistinguishable sequences. The reason for the low proportion of indistinguishable sequences in O. sativa was not clear. The results in the following analyses, however, were similar even if these indistinguishable fragments were included, suggesting similar evolutionary dynamics between NUPTs and nuclear mitochondrial DNAs (NUMTs) in a species. Thus, the ambiguous sequences were not excluded while performing the other analyses. Summary of homologous regions between chloroplast and mitochondria genomesSummary of homologous regions between chloroplast and mitochondria genomesThe number and amount of NUPTs varied among species (Table 2). In all species, most identified NUPTs were short fragments (median ranged from 175 bp for L. japonicus to 514 bp for P. trichocarpa), and many of them are less than 200 bp (25% in P. trichocarpa to 65% in L. japonicas). Arabidopsis thaliana had only 38 NUPTs, and the total length of the NUPTs was about 18 kb. On the other hands, Z. mays had about 1500 NUPTs, and the total length was nearly 1 Mb. Previously, species with large genome sizes were shown to contain large amounts of NUPTs than those with small genome sizes.62 Similarly, in our study, a positive correlation existed between genome size and cumulative length of NUPTs (P < 0.01 by Kendall's rank correlation; Supplementary Fig. S1). However, the proportions of NUPTs in the nuclear genome were not constant among species. The lowest proportion was found in M. esculenta, which had only 10-4 of the nuclear genome showing similarity to its chloroplast genome. On the other hand, the monocot species O. sativa and dicot species R. communis had >0.2% nuclear genome similar to the chloroplast genome. The amount of NUPTs differed even between closely related species. In Gramineae species, the proportion of NUPTs varied from 0.024 (S. bicolor) to 0.222% (O. sativa). These differences might reflect differences in not only genome size but also genome complexity and proportion of repetitive elements and/or other factors. Because the assembly and annotation of the genome in most species has not yet been completed, additional NUPTs might be found in centromeres and chromosome knobs where the high amount of NUPTs would be expected.

Distribution of NUPTs according to their origin from the chloroplast genomeThe structural differences among chloroplast genome regions could cause variation in the transfer rate to the nuclear genome. Thus, the incidence of transfer would not be uniform throughout the chloroplast genome. However, no regions had a extremely low or high amount of NUPTs in all species (Fig. 1), although there were significant differences in NUPT origin throughout the chloroplast genome. The absence of obvious hot or cold spots (regions) of NUPT origin suggests that no chloroplast genome regions have a strong deleterious effect on the host genome when transferred to the nuclear genome. Moreover, no resistance to transfer/integration mechanisms existed in the local chloroplast genomic regions. Taken together with the presence of long NUPTs, the fact that NUPTs frequently originated from not only genic regions but also intergenic regions of chloroplast genomes suggests that the integration predominantly occurred through DNA molecules as previously suggested.63,64Distribution of NUPT sequences on the chloroplast genome. The amounts of NUPT origins on each chloroplast genome are shown for all 17 species. Numbers of NUPTs are plotted for each base pair of the chloroplast genome. For seven species with assembled mitochondrial genomes, NUPTs from the homologous regions between the chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes are shown by light gray bars, whereas other NUPT origins are shown by black bars. For the other 10 species, NUPT origins are shown by gray bars. Shaded boxes represent inverted repeat regions. Dark gray lines in the x-axis represent chloroplast genomes, where homologous regions between chloroplast and mitochondria are shown in white.Distribution of NUPT sequences on the chloroplast genome.

Dark gray lines in the x-axis represent chloroplast genomes, where homologous regions between chloroplast and mitochondria are shown in white.Matsuo et al.21 suggested that the high amount of NUPTs were present in the chloroplast–mitochondria homologous regions in rice. We also confirmed this biased origin in all species in which all three genome sequences were available (Supplementary Table S3). These results are reasonable because NUMTs cannot be distinguished from NUPTs in these regions, leading to the inflation of estimated NUPT numbers.3.3. Biased distribution of NUPTs in the nuclear genomeThe amount of NUPTs also varied among nuclear chromosomal regions in each species (Fig. 2). Most species had regions with extremely large amount of NUPTs. In a 1-Mb region, the expected amount of NUPTs ranged from 100 bp to 2.5 kb in each species, but there were many regions that contained more than 5-kb NUPTs. Because NUPTs are known to be clustered in a specific region,21,65 several regions would be rich in NUPTs. NUPTs close to the centromere regions were suggested to be longer and younger in O. sativa.21 Michalovova et al.66 showed that the pericentromere-biased distribution of NUPTs was observed especially in species with a small genome size, whereas species with large genome sizes showed a wide distribution of NUPTs. We also observed that the distribution of NUPTs was not always similar among species (Fig. 2). In species in which centromere locations were known, high amount of NUPTs was detected not only in the regions close to the centromere, but also in the distal regions of the chromosomes, even though such distal regions often contain gene-rich regions. This finding might imply the difference in the tolerability of the amount of NUPTs in the distal regions across species. Position of NUPTs on the chromosomes. Locations and amounts of NUPTs are shown for six species (A. thaliana, L. japonicus, V. vinifera, O. sativa, S. bicolor, and Z. mays). Vertical lines and empty diamonds represent chromosomes and their centromeres. Nuclear genome was split into 1-Mb regions, and the amount of NUPTs in each region was plotted across a horizontal bar.Position of NUPTs on the chromosomes.

Vertical lines and empty diamonds represent chromosomes and their centromeres. Nuclear genome was split into 1-Mb regions, and the amount of NUPTs in each region was plotted across a horizontal bar.The high amount of NUPTs in specific chromosomal regions could be related to the presence of TEs. Because NUPTs are non-functional elements like TEs, the pressures of their degradation and elimination would be high in gene-rich regions, where foreign DNA insertions cause disruption and/or interruption of accurate gene function and regulation. Actually, the regions surrounding NUPTs were rich in TEs in all the three analysed species (Fig. 3). Arabidopsisthaliana and Z. mays, but not O. sativa, had significantly a higher amount of TEs around NUPTs, suggesting co-localization or similar genomic organization of NUPTs and TEs. Our findings imply the similarities between NUPTs and TEs that are considered as ‘junk’ DNA and show restricted distributions in the host genomes. Types of TEs in the vicinity of NUPTs. The average number of TEs in the vicinity of NUPTs is shown. The 5-kb sequences from both 5' and 3' flanking regions were extracted to analyse the number of TEs. TEs in sequences were estimated using the program RepeatMasker (available from: http://repeatmasker.org). For comparison, the average number of TEs within randomly extracted regions from each genome was also estimated. The figures in parenthesis show the number of NUPTs analysed (with identity from 96 to 90%, =100 bp).Types of TEs in the vicinity of NUPTs.

Age distribution of NUPTsThere were two distinct patterns of NUPT age distribution in the analysed plant species (Supplementary Fig. S2). One was typical for A. thaliana and most other dicot species, where no clear biases were observed. The other was found in all Gramineae species and few dicot species, showing very high proportion of young fragments that decreased dramatically with time. Although these two patterns were completely different, closely related species occasionally showed different patterns from each other. In Fabaceae, G. max had no biased age distribution of NUPTs, whereas M. truncatula showed a high peak at the youngest age. Although age distribution patterns differed between species, when the same scale of NUPT amount was used (Fig. 4), the two typical patterns could be explained by the combination of two different categories: the exponentially reduced part and a low constantly existing part. The distributions of Gramineae species and few dicot species (P. trichocarpa and M. truncatula) seem to be composed of these two categories, whereas those of other dicots would have a small portion of exponentially reduced part. These two categories might represent the difference of selective pressure against NUPTs in each category. We discussed this hypothesis later. Age distribution of NUPTs. The amount of NUPTs for each 1% p-distance interval is shown for all 17 species. For seven species with assembled mitochondrial genomes, NUPTs from the homologous regions between chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes are shown by light gray bars, whereas other NUPT origins are shown by black bars. For the other 10 species, NUPT origins are shown by gray bars. The scale of the amount of NUPTs is the same in all species.Age distribution of NUPTs.

For the other 10 species, NUPT origins are shown by gray bars. The scale of the amount of NUPTs is the same in all species.In addition to the elimination of individual NUPTs, their length pervasively changed from that found in the original chloroplast regions (Fig. 5). Differences in NUPT length correlated with NUPT age, indicating time-dependent accumulation of indel variations. The cumulative length differences in age classes were mostly negative, suggesting NUPT lengths became shorter after integration into the nuclear genome (Supplementary Fig. S3). These results suggest that the degradation of NUPTs occurred by not only complete elimination of individual NUPTs, but also by small indel variations. Pervasive change in NUPT length. The proportion of NUPT length changes to the corresponding chloroplast sequence length was plotted for individual NUPTs. Horizontal lines represent p-distance between NUPTs and chloroplast sequences. Vertical lines represent the proportion of the length change between NUPTs and chloroplast sequences.Pervasive change in NUPT length. The proportion of NUPT length changes to the corresponding chloroplast sequence length was plotted for individual NUPTs. Horizontal lines represent p-distance between NUPTs and chloroplast sequences. Vertical lines represent the proportion of the length change between NUPTs and chloroplast sequences.Several NUPTs are known to be located in the same region with fragmentations and inversions.14,21,65 This phenomenon could have originated during the insertion process and create short-fragmented NUPTs around long NUPTs. Long NUPTs might have been degraded to short fragments or eliminated from the genome. This pattern was observed in many analysed species, especially in the species having numerous young-aged NUPTs (Fig. 6). In such species, some NUPTs were long as several tens of kb in size, but most of them had <4% p-distances to the chloroplast genome. This result suggests that the effective degradation and elimination occurred in all species, and that only small NUPTs can escape eliminations. It is of interest to know why some relatively long NUPTs (>5 kb) still exist without degradations. Such long-lived NUPTs might have been assigned new functions as genes or regulatory elements to be maintained under negative selection. The old NUPTs (>4% p-distances to the chloroplast genome) rarely maintained their lengths longer than 5 kb. Such long, old NUPTs were surrounded by short NUPTs (Table 3). Moreover, a high amount of repetitive sequences were located around the cluster of such NUPTs. These observations suggest that the long-lived NUPTs are relic of large NUPTs degraded to become fragmented, but not became functionary important.

Locations of NUPTs on the chloroplast genome are shown against p-distance for all 17 species. The shaded boxes represent inverted repeat regions.3.5. Patterns of maintenance and elimination of NUPTs during evolutionThe presence of NUPTs in the nuclear genome should be determined by the balance between the transfer and elimination rates during evolution. The transfer rate from the chloroplast-to-nuclear genome was estimated to be about 6 × 10-5 per pollen grain9 or 2 × 10-7 per cell11 by a direct experiment involving transgenic tobacco. These estimated values by direct experiments should be underestimate for the chloroplast genome transfer rate of any regions,9,11,12 because, in these experiments, antibiotic-resistant genes of about 1–1.5 kb were used and whole genic region, including promoter sequences, should be integrated in any chromosomal region where the integrated genes can become actively transcribed. Indeed, actual integrated DNA fragments were 6.0 to over 22.3 kb in length,10 suggesting chloroplast genome fragment integrations occurred by long DNA fragments. Such long-length NUPTs were very rare even in recently integrated sequences (0–6%; Supplementary Table S4). Although the direct experiment studies were carried by using tobacco alone, the actual transfer rate is valuable to consider the dynamics of NUPTs in plant genomes. By applying the values obtained in this study, we could roughly estimate the transfer rate of NUPTs in each plant species used in this study. Considering that all NUPTs are selectively neutral and using estimated transfer rate per generation, we found that the estimated number of NUPTs with <1% p-distances varied from 3 × 104 (O. sativa) to 2 × 106 (V. vinifera) (assuming neutral mutation rate per generation as 10-8). Even if the proportion of NUPTs longer than 1 kb was used for estimation, the values exceed over 3 × 104. Each estimated value was at least 100-times larger than the observed number of NUPTs with <1% p-distances in each plant genome (Supplementary Table S4). This might be partly because of the overestimation of the NUPT amount to be <5 kb (or 1 kb). The number of shorter NUPTs could become greater by degradation than that of actually transferred fragments, although the effect might be limited. Rather, the difference between expected and observed NUPT numbers indicates high elimination pressure against the integration of NUPTs in all plant species. In the early evolutionary stage of endosymbiosis, the transfer of chloroplast fragments, especially including genes, would contribute an essential role for the tight regulation of chloroplasts by the host plant. However, recently transferred chloroplast genome fragments (young NUPTs) might have no clear functional roles and most of them were inactive.67,68 The rarity of functionally important NUPTs indicates that they resemble non-functional junk DNA, such as TEs. The NUPT integrations into functional genes or gene regulatory regions could cause severe deleterious effects. If NUPTs are non-functional and have deleterious effect, they can survive only in the regions where functional genes are rare. The large amount of long NUPTs close to the centromere region is reasonable since the elimination pressure would be less.In this study, we found that the age distribution of NUPTs could be explained by the combination of the exponentially reduced part and uniformly existing part (Fig. 7). The former would be deleterious fragments and can survive in the gene-poor and TE-rich regions where eliminations are not effective. The uniformly existing parts are rare and short in all plant species. These old and short NUPTs possibly have less deleterious effect and have been maintained under neutrality. The different patterns of NUPT age distribution among plant species might reflect the amount of deleterious NUPTs in each species, or different integration rates among species that account for the amount of recently formed NUPTs. The pattern of degradation and elimination of integrated NUPTs is important especially for understanding the dynamics of exponentially reduced parts. Michalovova et al.66 suggested an important role of TEs on the mechanism of degradation and elimination of NUPTs. However, our results showed that there are many pervasive changes (small insertions and deletions within or including NUPTs) found in all species, indicating the relative importance of such indel variations for the degradation and elimination of NUPTs. Experimental studies using Tobacco suggest that rearrangements by pervasive changes occurred just after integration.20,67 Concomitant integration of multiple fragments could also form adjacent NUPTs from small disjunct parts of chloroplast genomes. Lloyd and Timmis68 analysed the patterns of integration and changes of de novo insertion of chloroplast DNA fragments to demonstrate integration by non-homologous end joining involving simultaneous insertion of several chloroplast DNA fragments from different chloroplast regions. The result suggested concomitant integration of three DNA fragments from different regions of the chloroplast genome. Although the relative importance of each factor that determine the pattern and dynamics of NUPTs is still unclear, both pervasive changes after integration and de novo concomitant integrations indicate the importance of early stage changes in the evolution of NUPTs. Detailed analyses on the elimination and degradation patterns of young NUPTs in different species might lead to the elucidation of the factor determining the amount of NUPTs in a species.

IntroductionChanges in gene dosage at the whole-genome, chromosomal or segmental levels can elicit phenotypic and gene expression effects associated with dosage-sensitive genes.1 Polyploidization events increase the dosage of all loci, including structural and regulatory loci, controlling traits that may be genome dosage sensitive. Due to the importance of polyploidy to plant evolution and crop breeding, many aspects of gene regulation in polyploids require elucidation,2,3 including how dosage effects and other epigenetic changes are triggered and maintained in both allo- and autopolyploids.4,5A range of studies in allopolyploid plant genomes have revealed rapid epigenetic changes, including alteration in cytosine methylation patterns, rapid silencing of ribosomal RNA and protein-coding genes, and de-repression of dormant transposable elements.6,7 However, allopolyploid genomes are genetic hybrids, where both ploidy (genome dosage) and hybridity (mutational differences) occur in concert, making it difficult to disentangle genetic effects from genome (and gene)-dosage effects.In contrast, the generation of autopolyploids in the same genetic background provides a model system for the analysis of genome-dosage effects (sensu strictu) in the absence of mutational differences between lines of different ploidy. In autopolyploids, there have been a range of studies on genome-dosage effects on phenotypes in maize8,9 and A. thaliana.10–12 Changes in genome dosage in autopolyploids, and also in individual gene dosage, have been shown to modify epigenetic silencing in plants.9,13 The majority of studies on gene expression changes in autopolyploids conducted, to date, have either focused on a limited number of genes12,14,15 or found few gene (transcript) expression level changes at the whole-genome level between diploids and tetraploids of A. thaliana.16,17In addition, little is known regarding the extent of DNA methylation changes associated with autopolyploidy in A. thaliana or the functional effects of DNA methylation polymorphisms on gene expression or phenotypic changes. In diploids, it has been previously shown in A. thaliana methyltransferase mutants (drm1, drm2, cmt3 and met1) that loss of methylation can lead to upregulation of genes,18–20 and conversely that increased methylation can lead to downregulation in A. thaliana hybrids.20In interploidy 2x × 4x crosses, genome-dosage effects can occur in a parent-of-origin-dependent or -independent manner, depending on whether the two different types of reciprocal F1 triploids (i.e. 2m:1p versus 1m:2p) display different phenotypes. While parent-of-origin-dependent genome-dosage effects have been observed on phenoypes in maize and A. thaliana, little is known regarding parent-of-origin-dependent genome-dosage effects on gene expression in reciprocal F1 triploids. The generation of reciprocal F1 triploids in the same genetic background provides a system for the identification and analysis of genome-dosage and other epigenetic parental effects on phenotypes and gene expression, which are not due to mutational differences between the reciprocal F1 triploids.In this study, we have used isogenic reciprocal F1 triploids to demonstrate a major parent-of-origin-dependent (i.e. parental) genome-dosage-dependent effect on transcript levels in paternal genome excess F1 triploids. We also demonstrate that this novel parental genome-dosage effect in the F1 triploids is CmCGG methylation-independent at the whole-genome level. This suggests that the paternally and maternally inherited chromosome sets in autopolyploid plants may be epigenetically different, due to parental genome-dosage effects that can affect transcript levels in a CmCGG methylation-independent manner.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materialsCol-0 diploid (2x) and tetraploid (4x) seeds, selfed for at least two generations after colchicine treatment, were the kind gift of Luca Comai (University of Washington). Maternal-excess triploids (3x(m)) and paternal-excess triploids (3x(p)) were generated by manually crossing emasculated diploid or tetraploid flowers with diploid or tetraploid pollen under a Leica MZ6 dissection microscope using Dumostar No. 5 tweezers. Sterilized seeds were sown on 0.5X MS (Murashige and Skoog) media and grown in a Percival growth chamber (16 h light and 8 h darkness). Seedlings were harvested at the two true leaf stage (Boyes standard 1.0221) for subsequent analysis. The ploidy of the resulting crosses was verified by flow cytometry using a Partec Ploidy Analyzer, with CyStain UV Precise P (Partec) reagents, following manufacturer's instructions.2.2. Sample preparation and microarray hybridizationRNA from four biological replicates per ploidy level, with 20 seedlings per replicate, was extracted using the QIAGEN RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (#74 903). mRNA was purified with QIAGEN Oligotex mRNA Mini Kits (#70 022) using 25 µg of initial RNA, and used for double-stranded cDNA synthesis (SuperScript Double-Stranded cDNA synthesis #11917-010). After RNAse treatment (Epicentre RNAseH) and dscDNA purification (QIAGEN Qiaquick PCR purification kit), samples were labelled using Invitrogen BioPrime DNA labelling, and processed. For methylation analysis, DNA was extracted using the QIAGEN DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (#69 104), and 300 ng of DNA digested by 20 units of Mse1 and 10 units of either HpaII or MspI (New England Biolabs) at 37°C for 16 h. After ethanol precipitation of digested DNA, the samples were labelled with Invitrogen BioPrime DNA labelling. All kits were used according to manufacturer's instructions. Transcriptome and methylome analyses were performed using a custom whole-genome, SNP-tiling array (AtSNPtile1).222.3. Tiling array and small RNA data analysisThe tiling array used was the AtSNPtile1-tiling array which contains 1.4 million unique probes tiled along both strands of the entire A. thaliana genome at 35 bp resolution. The tiling probes include all unique features with good hybridization quality on the A. thaliana-tiling array 1.0 (Affymetrix). The analysis of the tiling array data for the detection of indels, gene expression and DNA methylation differences, including the validation of gene expression difference (by qRT-PCR) and correlation between DNA methylation, small RNA and gene expression is described in Supplementary Data.3. Results and discussion3.1. Generation of isogenic F1 triploid plantsReciprocal crosses of tetraploid (4x) and diploid (2x) parental lines in the same accession background can generate viable reciprocal F1 triploids in A. thaliana that are genetically identical, i.e. they are isogenic (Fig. 1). Such reciprocal F1 triploids provide an ideal model system to investigate parent-of-origin-specific (parental) effects on gene expression and other phenotypes.23 To identify any parent-of-origin-specific genome-dosage effects on gene expression between isogenic reciprocal F1 triploids of A. thaliana (accession Col-0), microarray profiling was performed on A. thaliana seedlings. The reciprocal F1 triploids were generated from neo-tetraploid (F2) plants (in the Col-0 accession background) that were reciprocally crossed in both parental directions (as either pollen or ovule donor) to the diploid progenitor line. Paternal-excess F1 triploids (3x(p)), each containing two copies of the paternal genome and one copy of the maternal genome, were generated by fertilizing emasculated diploid flowers with pollen from the tetraploid (i.e. a 2x × 4x cross). In contrast, emasculated tetraploid flowers were fertilized with pollen from the diploids (i.e. a 4x × 2x cross) to generate the reciprocal maternal-excess F1 triploids (3x(m)). The comparison of these genetically identical 3x(p) and 3x(m) plants formed the basis of our analysis of parent-of-origin genome-dosage effects on the transcriptome.

High-density tiling array analysis confirms that isogenic reciprocal F1 triploids generated from interploidy crosses in A. thaliana are genetically identicalIn a selfing species, such as A. thaliana, the crossing of diploid and tetraploid plants that are in the same genetic background should result in the generation of F1 triploid plants that contain the same DNA sequence (i.e. are isogenic in terms of DNA sequence) as the parental lines. Such isogenic ploidy series systems allow us to test for strict genome-dosage effects on gene expression and other phenotypes. In addition, the generation of isogenic F1 triploids provides a model system for detecting parent-of-origin-specific genome-dosage effects. To confirm that reciprocal F1 triploids generated from interploidy crosses are indeed isogenic, we hybridized genomic DNA to the tiling arrays and screened for any evidence of single feature polymorphisms (SFPs)24 by comparing individual probe intensities across the reciprocal F1 triploids. No SFPs were detected in the isogenic F1 triploids.As this approach may not have detected longer indels spanning several tiling array probes, we also compared the two triploid datasets using a segmentation algorithm.25 Only one potential indel (Chr2: 13 390 565–13 391 067) was predicted using this approach. When we subsequently tested this by PCR using primers designed to span the location of the putative indel, no such indel could be detected (Supplementary Fig. S1), indicating that this was a false positive from the segmentation algorithm. Overall, this analysis confirmed that the reciprocal F1 triploid plants are genetically isogenic and hence, provide a robust platform for the investigation of parent-of-origin-specific genome-dosage effects in plants.3.3. Isogenic reciprocal F1 triploid plants display epigenetic parent-of-origin-specific genome-dosage effects on transcript levelsHaving confirmed that the reciprocal F1 triploids generated from reciprocal interploidy crosses were truly isogenic, the tiling arrays were used to interrogate the expression levels of 25 703 genes in seedlings. Despite the fact that the reciprocal F1 triploids are genetically identical at the DNA sequence level, 602 genes were found to be differentially expressed between the reciprocal F1 triploids [using a false discovery rate (FDR) of 4.74 × 10e-3]. All the 602 differentially expressed genes were identified as having fold changes greater than 2.5 (Supplementary Table S1). All these 602 genes were upregulated in the paternal-excess 3x(p) F1 triploid compared with the maternal-excess 3x(m) F1 triploid. The upregulation of gene expression levels in 3x(p) versus 3x(m) F1 triploids was validated by qRT-PCR for 15 of 20 genes tested (75%) (Supplementary Fig. S2).Overall, our results using isogenic F1 triploids provide the first evidence of widespread parent-of-origin-specific genome-dosage effects on gene expression in triploid vegetative plant tissues. While parent-of-origin-specific expression (e.g. due to genomic imprinting26) has been detected in triploid endosperm tissues,27–29 previous studies have found no evidence for parent-of-origin effects on gene expression in diploid vegetative tissues.223.4. The 602 genes subject to parent-of-origin-specific genome-dosage effects are enriched for stress-response genesTo investigate the biological processes associated with the altered transcriptome of the 3x(p) triploid F1 seedlings, we screened for Gene Ontology (GO) terms enriched among the 602 upregulated genes by conditional hypergeometric tests.30 In total, 872 biological processes (BPs), 546 molecular functions and 230 cellular components (CC) were tested for this analysis. The BP analysis discovered a significant parent-of-origin-specific genome-dosage effect on stress-response genes, with several stress-response terms significantly overrepresented in the genes upregulated in the 3x(p) F1 triploid, including both biotic and abiotic stress responses (Supplementary Table S2).To further investigate the enrichment for both abiotic and biotic stress-response genes in the 3x(p) triploid, the AtGenExpress abiotic stress, pathogen infection, growth conditions, hormone and chemical treatment datasets were also interrogated. For this analysis, a list of all differentially expressed genes was identified for each treatment–tissue–time-point combination in the AtGenExpress datasets, and these AtGenExpress lists were then compared with the 602 up-regulated genes in the 3x(p) triploid to identify significant overlaps. Using this approach, for each abiotic stress, tested (cold, salt, heat, osmotic, genotoxic, wounding, oxidative, drought and UV) significant overlaps were detected with the 602 genes identified in the 3x(p) triploid (Supplementary Table S3). In addition, significant overlaps were also detected between the 602 3x(p) genes and biotic stress-response gene sets. These included genes responsive to several pathogens, including Pseudomonas, potato blight, virulent, avirulent, Type III secretion system-deficient and non-host bacterial pathogens, bacterial derived elicitors [LPS, HrpZ, Flg22 and oomycete (NPP1)] and mildew infection (Supplementary Table S3). While genome-dosage effects on transcript levels have been observed between diploid and tetraploid A. thaliana,16,17,31,32 and tetraploid lines observed to have increased salinity tolerance,33 to our knowledge, this is the first time that a parent-of-origin-specific genome-dosage effect on transcript levels of biotic and abiotic stress-response genes has been demonstrated.3.5. Paternal-excess isogenic F1 triploids display elevated mCG methylation at CCGG sitesIt is commonly considered that genome-wide transcript expression is correlated with gene cytosine methylation,18,34,35 which, in plants, most commonly occurs in the CG context.36 To determine whether the genome-wide distribution of CG DNA methylation differed between the reciprocal isogenic F1 triploids, tiling array analysis of CG methylation in a CCGG context was performed. This analysis was performed using the same tiling array platform that was used for the transcriptome analysis, allowing for direct locus-by-locus comparisons to be made.Briefly, DNA was extracted from matched samples (i.e. the four biological replicates used in the gene expression study) and the DNA digested with either of the DNA methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes MspI or HpaII, both of which recognize CCGG restriction enzyme sites. MspI is insensitive to methylation at the internal cytosine (i.e. CmCGG) and will cut the CCGG site whether the internal C sequence is methylated or not. In contrast, HpaII will only cut CCGG when the internal cytosine is unmethylated (i.e. CCGG). Therefore, increased signal intensity at probes containing CCGG sequences in the HpaII-digested samples indicates methylation at the internal C site (i.e. CmCGG).To scan the genome for CG methylation polymorphisms between the reciprocal F1 triploids, a total of 75 943 CCGG sites interrogated on the array were each tested for MspI versus HpaII intensity differences, and a linear, mixed-effects model was implemented to detect both constitutive and polymorphic methylation (see Materials and Methods, and ref.37). In this experiment, constitutive methylated CCGG sites are those in which internal cytosine methylation is observed in both of the isogenic reciprocal F1 triploids. In contrast, polymorphic methylated CCGG sites are those in which internal cytosine methylation is observed in only one of the isogenic reciprocal F1 triploids. Using this approach, 8008 CCGG sites were identified as methylated at the internal cytosine (i.e. CmCGG) in both of the reciprocal F1 triploids (FDR = 5.64 × 10-3). In contrast, a further 5644 sites (7.4% of the total 75 943 sites scanned) displayed polymorphic internal cytosine methylation, indicating that these internal cytosine sites were differentially methylated between the genetically identical F1 triploids. Of these, 3587 (63.6%) were methylated in the 3x(p) but not the 3x(m) (FDR = 3.54 × 10-3), whereas the remaining 2057 (36.4%) showed the opposite pattern and were methylated in the 3x(m) (FDR = 5.77 × 10-3) but not the 3x(p). Of the 13 652 CmCGG sites detected across the genome, 41.3% were polymorphic between the reciprocal F1 triploids.The extensive differential CmCGG methylation between the isogenic reciprocal F1 triploids can be due to parental genome-dosage effects on mCG establishment or maintenance. Indeed, it is likely that there are parental genome-dosage effects on both of these DNA methylation mechanisms, as the 3587 could be neomethylated in the paternal-excess 3x, whereas the 2057 could be demethylated in the paternal excess (or vice versa). Our results suggested that RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM; via AGO4 and DRM2) at some loci could be subject to parent-of-origin-specific genome-dosage effects on CG methylation establishment.38 However, the transcript levels of AGO4 and DRM2 do not differ between the reciprocal F1 triploids, indicating that the parent-of-origin-specific genome-dosage effects on mCG methylation polymorphism are not due to AGO4/DRM2 transcript levels affecting mCG methylation establishment.Our results could also indicate that maintenance of mCG methylation at some sites via MET1, DDM1 and/or VIM1-3 can be subject to parental genome-dosage effects.38 However, the transcript levels of MET1, DDM1 and/or VIM1-3 do not differ between the reciprocal F1 triploids, indicating that the parent-of-origin-specific genome-dosage effects on mCG methylation polymorphism are not due to different transcript levels of MET1, DDM1 and/or VIM1-3 affecting mCG methylation maintenance. Alternately, the mCG methylation polymorphism observed could be due to parental genome-dosage effects on establishment or maintenance pathways that are operating at a post-transcriptional level. It is important to consider that the assay used does not interrogate all the CG sites in the genome, i.e. the assay is restricted to those CG sites in a CCGG context. Any conclusions made from our results hence relate to CCGG sites, and not to all CG sites in the genome. However, it is possible that the CCGG data subset may be representative of overall CG methylation (see below).3.6. Parental genome-dosage effect polymorphic CmCGG methylation is uniformly distributed across chromosomal regions in reciprocal F1 triploidsTo determine whether the polymorphic mCG methylation at CCGG sites was clustered on any chromosomes or chromosomal regions, the genome-wide distribution of constitutive CmCGG methylation was analysed across the five A. thaliana chromosomes. This determined that the constitutively methylated CmCGG sites are concentrated in pericentromeric regions, while depleted in the middle of the chromosome arms (Fig. 2A). This pattern for constitutive CmCGG methylation is similar to the distribution previously reported in diploids,34,37 including assays evaluating mC in all contexts.33 In contrast, the polymorphic CmCGG methylation sites that are subject to parental genome-dosage effects (i.e. those which differ between 3x(m) and 3x(p) triploids) are much more uniformly distributed across the chromosomes (Fig. 2A).

LOWESS smoothing of polymorphic methylation (blue), or a null distribution (black) obtained by shuffling by 1 kb blocks then LOWESS smoothing. X-axis represents the position across the chromosomes.As DNA methylation changes could have either site-specific or broader effects on local chromatin structure,39 we further investigated whether the DNA methylation polymorphisms were clustered across large tracts of sequence rather than at individual sites (as our method identifies). Hence, LOWESS smoothing was performed on the d scores using 200 kb discrete windows for both constitutive and polymorphic CmCGG methylated sites. LOWESS smoothing performs locally weighted regression on neighbouring d scores within the window such that each d score is adjusted to reflect the overall pattern displayed by its neighbours. This allows identification of regional methylation patterns along chromosomes when compared with a null distribution. After applying LOWESS smoothing, constitutive CmCGG methylation continued to be preferentially located around the pericentromeres, indicating that constitutively methylated sites are clustered in these regions (Fig. 2B). In contrast, the LOWESS-smoothed d scores for polymorphic CmCGG methylation sites are largely indistinguishable from those of the null distribution (Fig. 2C). This indicates that, in chromosome regions distal from the centromeres, polymorphic and constitutive CmCGG methylation sites do not show any patterns specific to large chromosomal tracts (i.e. at 200 kb windows or multiples thereof), and that the CCGG sites, which are differentially methylated between F1 triploids, are therefore likely to be discretely located at a resolution of <200 kb.3.7. Polymorphic CmCGG methylation is not associated with any particular genomic feature in the reciprocal F1 triploidsIt has been previously shown that ~20% of genes are methylated in A. thaliana diploids.34,35,37 We found that ~20% of genes contained either constitutive or polymorphic CmCGG methylation in the isogenic F1 triploids. To test whether the constitutive and polymorphic CmCGG sites differed in their associations with other genomic features, we compared their distributions across coding sequences (CDS), introns, 5' UTRs, 3' UTRs, areas 1 kb upstream or downstream of genes, and in intergenic regions (Fig. 3). The constitutive CmCGG methylation was found in all of the genomic features analysed, with some relative elevation in CDS and introns, and possible reduction in 5' UTR and 3' UTR (Fig. 3).

Constitutive (but not polymorphic) CmCGG gene body methylation in F1 triploids displays similar patterns to diploidsWhile the role of gene body methylation has yet to be fully elucidated in plants, roles in transcriptional accuracy and splicing efficiency have been suggested,34,40 and it appears that body-methylated genes are functionally important and display slower evolutionary rates in A. thaliana.41 It has previously been shown in A. thaliana diploids that genes containing body methylation tend to be less methylated towards their 5' and 3' ends.34,35,37 To determine whether this gene body methylation pattern was conserved in reciprocal F1 triploids, the distribution of both constitutive and polymorphic CmCGG sites across the gene body (CDS and introns) was plotted (UTRs were omitted as they are not annotated for all genes). Genes were further divided by gene length (i.e. <1, 1–2, 2–3 and >3 kb) (Fig. 4A and B). Genes containing CCGG sites were divided into 10 percentiles, and the proportion of CmCGG methylation was calculated for each percentile. Percentage methylation (CmCGG) across genic regions.

(A) Constitutive methylation between reciprocal triploids and (B) polymorphic methylation between reciprocal triploids. Gene regions split into percentiles from 5' to 3' end of genes. Genes were further split into sizes ranges from <1, 1–2, 2 and >3 kb.The pattern of constitutive methylation observed in both reciprocal F1 triploids was similar to that observed in diploids,34,35,37 with the 5' and 3' ends of body-methylated genes comparatively depleted in CmCGG methylation. This pattern is particularly pronounced for longer genes (Fig. 4A), again confirming a pattern observed in diploids.37 Furthermore, this pattern is observed when mC (i.e. methylation in all contexts) is plotted across gene bodies.33 Given that gene body methylation in A. thaliana is primarily in a CG context,42 this suggests that the CCGG sites tested in this study are broadly representative of gene body CG methylation in A. thaliana.However, the distribution of polymorphic CmCGG methylation across the gene body was rather different and was much more uniformly distributed across the gene body (Fig. 4B). There was also very little difference in the distribution of polymorphic CmCGG methylated sites across genes of different lengths. In summary, total constitutive gene body methylation of gene body regions is higher than that of polymorphic methylation overall (Fig. 3) and is particularly higher in the middle of the gene body, and the 3' end. In contrast, more CmCGG polymorphisms are found at the 5' end of genes when compared with constitutive methylation (Fig. 4A and B). We conclude that CmCGG methylation patterns are largely unchanged in isogenic reciprocal F1 triploids generated in either cross direction (when compared with diploids).A non-linear relationship between gene expression (absolute transcript levels) and gene body methylation has been observed in A. thaliana.34,37 The least expressed genes and the most highly expressed genes are found to contain the lowest levels of gene body methylation, whereas genes expressed at intermediate levels contain the highest levels of gene body methylation.33,36 To test whether this pattern of gene body methylation is maintained in A. thaliana F1 triploids, we investigated the correlation between constitutive CmCGG methylation and absolute gene expression levels. All genes were divided into 20 percentiles categories according to their absolute expression levels (see Materials and methods). Within each expression level percentile and for a range of gene annotation categories (i.e. CDS, intron, 5' UTR, 3' UTR, up- and downstream 500 bp regions), the number of genes containing constitutive CmCGG methylation site(s) was divided by those containing CCGG feature(s). For CDS and introns, the pattern of lowest and highest expressed genes having the lowest levels of constitutive CmCGG methylation was observed (Fig. 5). In contrast, CmCGG methylation within up- and downstream sequences, and in both UTRs, was generally low regardless of transcript expression levels (Fig. 5). As this pattern between gene expression and methylation is evident, when mC methylation is measured34,35, it is a further indication that the CCGG sites measured in this study provide a good representation of the broader mCG methylation distribution. Although there remains the possibility that other important CG sites might be missed in analysis for particular loci.

Gene expression levels from all arrays [3x(m) and 3x(p)] were used and genes were split into percentiles.3.9. Gene expression differences between reciprocal F1 isogenic triploids are not correlated with differential CmCGG methylationTo examine the relationship between CmCGG methylation polymorphisms and gene expression, gene expression d scores were linearly regressed against d scores for polymorphic methylation. Probes were mapped to genomic features CDS, introns, 5' UTRs and 3' UTRs, 1000 bp up- and downstream regions (up- and downstream regions were tested in 100 bp intervals). No significant correlation was observed between gene expression levels and polymorphic CmCGG methylation at CDS, introns or downstream regions (P < 0.05). In contrast, a weak but significant negative correlation (r = 0.13, P = 0.0039) was identified between gene expression and regions 900–1000 bp upstream of genes.Next, as most genes did not display any level of polymorphic methylation, we considered only those features found to have significant polymorphic methylation (either hypo- or hypermethylation), and compared their gene expression d scores with their polymorphic methylation d scores. Genomic regions hypomethylated in the 3x(p) were considered separately from those regions hypermethylated in the 3x(p). A moderate positive correlation between hypomethylated regions 800–900 bp upstream of genes 3x(p) and gene expression was identified (r = 0.31, P = 0.0459). Overall, our results indicate that polymorphic CmCGG methylation does not have a strong effect on gene expression in the reciprocal F1 triploids, and that the changes in gene regulation between paternal and maternal-excess triploids are not controlled by CmCGG methylation.3.10. 24-ht small RNAs differentially accumulate in up- and downstream regionsSeveral species of small non-coding RNAs play a role in gene and transposable element regulation either by post-transcriptional gene silencing (miRNAs and tasi-RNAs) or by RdDM (24-ht RNAs).43 In the case of RdDM, the accumulation of 24-ht RNAs at a locus can be considered an indication of asymmetric CHH methylation at that locus (where H = C, A or T), as CHH methylation is reliant on RdDM. Using existing data of 3x(m) and 3x(p) small RNA sequencing from A. thaliana leaf tissue,44 we investigated whether the differentially expressed genes between 3x(m) and 3x(p) displayed differential accumulation of either 21 or 24-ht RNAs across their genomic features (CDS, introns, 3' UTRs, 5' UTRs, up- and downstream regions).For the genes we have as differentially expressed between the reciprocal F1 triploids, the number of accumulated 24-ht small RNAs was fewer in the upstream regions of dysregulated genes in the 3x(p) (median: 2.59, IQR: 1.29–61.10) compared with 3x(m) plants (median: 15.10, IQR: 1.89–91.52) (Fig. 6A), although the interquartile ranges are comparable, indicating that at least some upstream regions in the 3x(p) accumulate similar numbers of 24-ht RNAs compared with the upstream regions in the 3x(m) (Fig. 6A). Similarly, downstream regions of dysregulated genes were found to accumulate less 24-ht RNAs in the 3x(p) (median: 2.59, IQR: 1.29–78.23) compared with 3x(m) (median: 16.98, IQR: 1.89–111.80). In contrast, the other genic features tested displayed much smaller variations in 24-ht RNA accumulation (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, the accumulation of 24-ht RNA remained consistent across 3x(m) and 3x(p) for each feature tested (Fig. 6B).

(A) Boxplots of 24-ht small RNA accumulation. (B) Boxplots of 24-ht small RNA accumulation.To test whether these patterns of small RNA accumulation were specific for the differentially expressed genes or whether they were consistent across all genes in the genome, the distribution of accumulation of 21- and 24-ht small RNAs for non-differentially expressed genes were identified (Supplementary Fig. S3A and B). The accumulation of both 21- and 24-ht RNAs was found to be comparable between 3x(m) and 3x(p) for all features tested, which is consistent with the original analysis of the small RNA data.44 These results indicate that the loss of 24-ht RNAs in leaves in the up- and downstream regions is associated with differentially expressed genes up-regulated in the paternal-excess triploid. Indeed, differences in 24-ht accumulation in up- and downstream regions of genes have previously been shown to contribute to divergence in gene expression between two A. thaliana species.45 Notably, 24-ht RNAs are known to be involved in de novo methylation, in particular asymmetric CHH methylation (via the RdDM pathway).46 Hence, loss of 24-ht RNAs leading to loss of CHH methylation could be mechanistically involved in the up-regulation of loci gene expression in the paternal-excess F1 triploids. However, the small RNA dataset used here represents small RNA sequencing data from leaf tissues, which have comparative limitations. Further investigation on the distribution of small RNA in seedlings of reciprocal triploids will shed further light on the relationship between gene expression and small RNA distribution in triploids.3.11. ConclusionsOverall, this study demonstrates that the transcriptomes of reciprocal F1 triploids are non-equivalent, despite the genetically identical nature of maternal genome excess versus paternal genome excess F1 triploids. This indicates that there are parent-of-origin-specific genome-dosage effects on the transcriptome of paternal-excess F1 triploids that could have an epigenetic basis. Even though DNA methylation is one form of epigenetic mark that has been widely associated with gene expression changes, our findings indicate that the parental genome-dosage-dependent effects on gene expression in paternal-excess F1 triploids are not associated with CmCGG methylation and may instead be associated with RdDM pathways involving 24-ht small RNAs that are associated with de novo CHH methylation. Overall, our study suggests that the paternally and maternally inherited chromosome sets in autopolyploid plants may be epigenetically different, due to parental genome-dosage effects that can affect transcript levels in a CmCGG methylation-independent manner. Such epigenetic differences between reciprocal F1 triploids that are genetically identical have implications for our understanding of triploidy and polyploidy in plants (and animals47), including for fundamental and applied genetics of triploid and other autopolyploid crops.Supplementary DataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was funded through grant funding to C.S. from Science Foundation Ireland (SFI; grants 02/IN.1/B49 and 08/IN.1/B1931).Supplementary data"

IntroductionSoybean is an important worldwide plant source of dietary protein and oil, and its capability of nitrogen fixation during symbiosis with rhizobia plays an important role in establishing sustainable agriculture systems. Cultivated soybean (Glycine max) is thought to have been domesticated from wild soybean (Glycine soja) with distribution in East Asia, including Korea, Japan, and most parts of China, as early as 7000–9000 years ago,1 although the exact domestication location(s) are under debate.1,2 Soybean has undergone radical phenotypic changes in the seed size, colour, shattering, seed dormancy, flowering time, and plant architecture during the process of domestication. Localization of the major causative genes, responsible for these traits, would facilitate improvements in soybean using marker-assisted breeding. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of the diverse soybean germplasm may offer the potential to rapidly resolve complex traits to gene-level resolution, as in maize and Arabidopsis. However, GWAS take years to construct segregating populations and require a high density of genome-wide markers. Association mapping is also prone to miss causative gene alleles, thereby requiring additional sequence-level mapping.3 The availability of a comprehensive genome variation catalogue for both cultivated and wild soybeans would greatly facilitate the identification of functional variations in elite varieties by comparing the genomic variations in an elite variety with data from the controls. Resequencing analyses of major crop plants, including soybean, rice, and maize, using a low-depth sequencing coverage have been reported recently.4–7 However, the strategy of pooling many accessions for variation calling might miss rare variants, as indicated in a dense resequencing study of 50 diverse rice accessions8 and deep Arabidopsis sequencing studies.9,10 Here, we provide dense variation data based on an analysis of high-depth resequencing data of a diverse group of 10 cultivated and 6 wild soybean genomes sequenced to >14× mean depth. Thus, our results will likely be useful for marker-assisted breeding and sequence-level gene mapping of soybean.2. Materials and methods2.1. SamplingAll samples were grown in greenhouses and in the field for morphological confirmation.2.2. Sample preparation and sequencingSeeds of each of soybean accessions (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2) were germinated in a dark chamber at 25°C in a pot. After primary leaves of the germinated seedlings opened, all etiolated shoots of the seedlings except their cotyledons were collected to extract genomic DNA. Sequencing libraries were constructed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). By applying the Illumina HiSeq2000 platform, we generated 305 Gb of 101 bp paired-end short reads from 15 samples with insert sizes of 237–336 bp (Supplementary Table S3). The short-read sequence data are deposited into the European Nucleotide Archive under accession number ERP002622. We imported 39.8 Gb of the 76 bp paired-end reads for IT182932, which was reported previously by Kim et al.11 Over 94% of the reads (86.3% for IT182932) were mapped onto the whole Williams 82 reference genome. A total of 86.3–90% of reads were mapped onto the chromosomes (Gm01–Gm20) except reads of IT182932 (76.1%). After removing duplicated reads, we used 78.9–88.5% (71.9% for IT182932) of the sequenced reads for downstream analysis (Supplementary Table S3).2.3. Genome size estimationThe estimation of genome size for each accession was computed based on counting of occurrences of K-mers (substring of length K). We estimated the genome size using JELLYFISH 1.1.512 with K-mer as 17 bp JELLYFISH counted 17-mer frequencies per depth. As the peak of 17-mer frequency (M) in reads is correlated with the real sequencing depth (N), read length (L), and K-mer length (K), their relationship can be expressed in a formula used in the Panda genome project: M = N × (L – K + 1)/L.13 Then, the estimated genome size was obtained by dividing the total sequence length by the real sequencing depth.2.4. Reads mappingPaired-end reads were mapped onto the Williams 82 reference genome (Glyma1) using Burrows Wheeler Aligner (version 0.5.9) with default options.14 The reference genome sequence was downloaded from the JGI genome portal (ftp.jgi-psf.org/pub/compgen/phytozome/V9.0/Gmax/assembly/Gmax_189.fa.gz, accessed on 10 November 2013). Glycine max chloroplast genome (NC_007942) was separately downloaded from the NCBI ftp site (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/Glycine_max/CHR_Pltd/gma_ref_V1.0_chrPltd.fa.gz, accessed on 10 November 2013) and included in the reference genome. After initial mapping of the raw reads onto the reference genome, we screened the reads that were mapped as unplaced scaffolds and the unmapped reads. Aligned reads considered to be PCR duplicates were removed using the MarkDuplicates in the Picard software package 1.48 (http://picard.sourceforge.net/, accessed on 10 November 2013). Mate information was re-synchronized using the Picard FixMateInformation tool. Alignments around the small indels were re-aligned with IndelRealigner, and base-pair quality scores (QUAL) were recalibrated with CountCovariates and TableRecalibration in the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK; version 1.0.5974).15 The realigned, recalibrated SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) files produced by these processing steps were used for single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)/indel detection and for all alignment-related statistics, such as allele counts.2.5. SNP and indel detectionIndividual genotyping was performed to identify SNPs and indels for each of the 16 samples. Then, multi-sample SNP genotyping was performed to compare the genotypes on the variant positions, where all samples were able to be genotyped. UnifiedGenotyper in GATK16 was used to generate the initial SNP and small indel calls. The SNP/indels were called with standard call confidence (-stand_call_conf) set to 30.0 and standard emit confidence (-stand_emit_conf) set to 10.0. An indel model (-glm INDEL) was enabled in indel calling. To identify high-quality variants, the initially called SNP/indels were evaluated with a Gaussian mixture model that was built with known soybean variants (dbSNP; version 133), and outliers were discarded. To reduce the SNP/indel false discovery rate, raw variant calls were filtered using VariantFiltration in GATK for the following annotations: QUAL of =50.0, depth of coverage (DP) =5, call quality divided by depth (QD) =5, mapping quality (MQ) =30, strand bias (SB) greater than or equal to -1.0, MQ zero reads (MQ0) =4, and MQ0 divided by depth (MQ0/DP) =0.1. We designed random primer pairs across the genome and performed Sanger sequencing to validate genotypes called using our Illumina data. Agreement between locations of SNPs/indels mapped in the Hwangkeum × IT182932 population,17 and SNPs/indels called in this study was also examined for validation.2.6. Identification of non-reference genesWe assembled the unmapped reads from each sample into contigs using SOAPdenovo.18 Default parameters were used and only contigs, not scaffolds, were constructed. We first assembled the unmapped reads separately in each accession, and contigs shorter than 2 kb were excluded to identify novel sequences. We then used the self-alignment approach to exclude the redundant sequences. In total, we identified 10 035 contigs with a total length of 31.5 Mb (Supplementary Table S6). In a previous analysis of IT182832 short reads using different methods, Kim et al.11 reported a total length of 8.3 Mb much longer than 0.83 Mb obtained in this study. However, a total length of contigs longer than 300 bp from IT182932 in the current analysis was 9.1 Mb, indicating that this difference likely reflects different methods and cut-off criteria. We conducted de novo gene annotation with AUGUSTUS19 for the 10 035 contigs. After annotation, we excluded the redundant genes that were assembled in different accessions. Only one copy of the genes with >90% identity and >90% coverage by BLAT was retained. In total, we annotated 1363 possible genes de novo containing =100 amino acids. Then, we used BLASTP20 to compare the candidate novel genes against the NCBI non-redundant (nr) database (>60% identity and 60% coverage). Then, we further performed functional annotation using InterProScan21 and HMMer3.22We attempted to validate some of these gain genes using a PCR amplification method. We chose 51 gain genes (transposon genes excluded) from the cultivars Williams 82K (n = 4) and Hwangkeum (8), as well as the wild soybean IT162825 (39). PCRs were performed using the cultivated soybeans Williams 82K and Hwangkeum, as well as the wild soybeans IT182932 and IT162825 as templates. In addition to singlet PCR using a pair of primers designed from each of the chosen genes, we performed multiplex PCR by adding a pair of primers designed from the soybean actin gene to be certain of the absence of the expected PCR products. The actin gene primers were: forward 5'-TGGACTCTGGTGAT GGTGTC-3' and reverse 5'-CTCCAATCCAAACACTGTA-3'.232.7. Identification of gene loss eventsTo identify gene loss events, we first discovered medium-size deletion (ranging from 200 to 300 000 bp) sites in the Williams 82 reference genome using Genome STRiP 1.0.3.24 Genome STRiP identifies structural variations in populations by using information from read pairs with unexpected alignments as well as analysis of read depth. We ran the Genome STRiP with default parameters for 15 accessions except IT182932. Calls ‘not detected’ in more than three accessions were excluded. This reduced false positives due to low depth of resequencing data at some regions or due to errors in the reference genome sequence. As a result, we identified 10 928 medium-size deletions in various accessions and then examined if these deletions were associated with gene loss events based on gene annotations from the soybean reference v1.1 gene set, which was downloaded from the SoyBase website (http://www.soybase.org, accessed on 10 November 2013). Validation of the gene loss events was performed by designing pairs of primers that amplify 200–300 bp DNA fragments flanking the deletion sites. We randomly chose 55 deletions of various sizes and used PCR to experimentally validate the deletions.2.8. Gene ontology term enrichment analysisGene ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis was performed on the non-reference (or gained) gene set, the gene set associated with gene loss events, and the identified candidate domestication or improvement gene set. We first loaded protein sequences of the gene sets into Pathway Studio ver. 9 (Elsevier). The enrichment analyses were performed using the ResNet Plant database (version 4.0) provided by this software. The identified orthologues using the BLAST best reciprocal hit method were used for the enrichment analysis. The algorithm returned a probability value (P) for the statistical significance test of gene enrichment between the input gene set and GO group. We considered a GO term to be enriched if the P-value was <0.001.2.9. Construction of phylogenySNPs were used to calculate the genetic distances between different accessions. The neighbour-joining method25 was applied to construct the phylogenetic tree based on the p-distance method and the bootstrap confidence analysis with 1000 replicates. The trees were drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances, which are in the units of the number of base differences per site. The constructed phylogenetic tree was plotted using MEGA5.262.10. Population structure inferenceWe used the STRUCTURE version 2.3.2,27 which is based on the maximum-likelihood method, to investigate the population structure across different values of K (number of putative ancestral clusters of allelic similarity). We used an admixture model with correlated allele frequency28 to assign individuals into K clusters. A 10,000 burn-in period of Chain Monte Carlo searches followed by 20,000 replicate runs were performed at each K from 2 to 7. We conducted STRUCTURE analysis for 17 accessions consisting of the reference genome (Williams 82), 10 cultivated, and 6 wild soybeans as well as an expanded set consisting of these 17 and 31 accessions from Lam et al.52.11. Calculation of linkage disequilibriumThe correlation coefficient (r2) of alleles was calculated to measure linkage disequilibrium (LD) levels in both the wild and cultivated soybeans using the Haploview software.29 The parameters were set as follows: maximum intermarker distance for LD comparisons (maxdistance) to 1000, output to pairwise LD text table format (dprime), minimum minor allele frequency (minMAF) to 0.1, and minimum Hardy-Weinberg P-value (hwcutoff) to 0.001. The average r2 values were calculated for pairwise marker distances, and the values were smoothed using the LOWESS function of R for both cultivated and wild soybean populations.2.12. Estimation of population parameters and detection of putative artificially selected genesPopulation statistics p, <U+03B8>w, and FST were calculated using in-house custom scripts, as described previously.30–32 The analysis using the reduction of diversity (ROD = 1 - pcul/pwild) introduced by Xu et al.8 was adapted to our samples. ROD values were calculated based on the ratio of diversity in the cultivated soybeans to the diversity in the wild soybeans (pcul/pwild) in 20% sliding windows along the entire genome. We performed this analysis using windows of 10, 50, 100, 150, 200, and 500 kb. The windows with >0.98 ROD values were picked out as candidate selective sweep regions, and genes in these regions were identified as putative genes under selection. Windows in multiple pericentromeric regions in our initial analysis showed high ROD values, as observed in a maize resequencing study.7 Because pericentromeric regions harbour few genes and correlations between genetic map and reference genome sequence in these regions are generally low,17 we masked pericentromeric regions from further analysis (Supplementary Table S4). In addition, we masked windows in the bottom 1% of SNP frequency.3. Results and discussion3.1. Sequencing and mappingWild and cultivated (domesticated) soybeans are classified into distinct species: cultivated soybean is G. max and its wild relatives are G. soja.33 However, a cultivated plant and its wild relative can normally cross and produce a fertile F1 hybrid generation despite distinctive phenotypes (Fig. 1a). Furthermore, G. soja is the only wild member of the subgenus Soja distributed in East Asia.34 Thus, this crop and its wild ancestor have been proposed to be more appropriately classified as G. max subsp. max and G. max subsp. soja, respectively,35 although most of the current literature and this study still use G. soja as the scientific name of the annual wild soybean. With this consideration, we use the term ‘cultivated’ and ‘wild’ soybeans to refer to G. max and G. soja, respectively, throughout this study to avoid the ambiguity of the current nomenclature.

To strictly control the quality of our sequencing and SNP calling, we also included Williams 82K,17 a variant of the Williams 82 strain, which was used to generate the reference soybean genome sequence.36 All improved soybeans, except Williams 82 which was bred by backcross breeding in the USA, were bred using a pedigree breeding method in Korea (Supplementary Table S2). Parental lines of improved varieties originated from China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and the USA. Although some of the parental lines share common ancestor(s) in their pedigrees, a unique parent in each of the five improved varieties should contribute ~50% genetic variation from a unique landrace through this breeding method. Six wild accession samples were collected according to the geographic distribution of the wild soybean in Korea (Supplementary Table S1 and Fig. S1). As Korea is located in the centre of the ancient soybean cultivation and wild soybean distribution areas and has a long history of soybean use as food, we hypothesized that intensive sequencing of representative Korean soybean genomes might reveal the genetic diversity of soybean.37We sequenced these 15 chosen accessions to >17× coverage (raw data) using an Illumina HiSeq2000 instrument except the wild soybean IT182932 (Supplementary Table S1). Genome resequencing analysis of IT182932 was reported by Kim et al.11 Raw reads of 39.8 Gb of the IT182932 genome produced by Illumina-GA were re-analysed in this study. Variation calling results of Williams 82K, Hwangkeum, and IT182932 were partly reported in our previous study, which compared soybean genetic and sequence-based physical maps.17 However, population-level analysis using dense variation data of these 10 cultivated and 6 wild accessions is first reported in this study. After removing duplicate reads (Supplementary Table S3), the final mean depth was >14× for all accessions and >97% of the reference genome was covered by more than one read and >94% by more than five reads for all accessions, but IT182932 (96.1 and 85.4%, respectively) (Supplementary Table S1). Homozygous variation callings required a minimum of five reads. The genome coverages were higher and much less variable than those of a similar study for rice accessions that ranged from 79 to 94%,8 indicating that, relative to rice, soybeans contain smaller portions of individual-specific or diverged sequences. The high variability in mapping rates among rice accessions is likely due to significant genome size differences among rice subspecies.38 The similarity of genome sizes between cultivated and wild soybean accessions was further tested by estimating the genome sizes of soybean accessions using a distribution of 17-mer frequency in the usable sequencing reads to determine the sequencing depth.13 We obtained estimated genome sizes (±SEM) of 1107 ± 11 and 1106 ± 22 Mb from 10 cultivated and 6 wild soybeans, respectively (Supplementary Table S5). The two estimated values were not significantly different (t-test, P-value = 0.990; F-test, P-value = 0.211). Thus, relative to Oryza sativa (rice) that is divided into several subspecies, the cultivated and wild soybeans that are widely divided into two different species, G. max and G. soja, should be regarded as a single species. The mean value of 1106 Mb from 16 soybeans was also similar to that of 1115 Mb estimated by flow cytometry,39 suggesting that the Williams 82 sequence assembly of 955 Mb36 may miss ~150 Mb.3.2. Identification of gene gain and loss events across the soybean genomeHigh-depth resequencing data allowed us to identify gene gain and loss events across the soybean genome. We assembled unmapped reads for each accession into contigs (Supplementary Table S6) and then used de novo gene prediction to annotate 1326 putative genes in the contigs, of which 345 had homologues in the NCBI nr database and 343 of these had homologues in plants (Supplementary Table S7, S8, and Supplementary Data Set 1). Interestingly, of the eight genes that we annotated in two sequences identified as the missing sequences of the Williams 82 genome assembly in our previous report,17 seven had >85% similarity in these 343 genes and four were identical in these 343 genes, indicating that many of the unmapped genes represent genes from missing sequences in the Williams 82 genome assembly. To test whether some of these unmapped genes are found only in a certain accession, we chose 51 such ‘novel’ genes for PCR validation. When two cultivated and two wild accessions were tested, the proper PCR product size for all 51 was amplified in one or more of the four tested accessions (Supplementary Fig. S2). Of the 51, 20, including four from Williams 82K, were amplified in all four accessions and 31 were absent in one or more of the tested four, indicating that although some of our de novo assembled genes reflected incompleteness of the current Williams 82 genome assembly, >60% were gain genes whose presence/absence in the soybean population were variable (Supplementary Table S8). Interestingly, the presence/absence patterns of 12 non-reference genome genes agreed to those predicted from our de novo assembly. The 343 gain genes consist of 133 characterized gene homologues, 108 uncharacterized gene homologues, and 102 transposon-related genes, indicating that some of these novel genes may have arisen from the movement of transposable elements, which commonly create incomplete pseudogenes in plants. However, in the GO analysis using the Pathway Studio (Elsevier), we found no GO term enriched by =2 genes in the 133 genes.In addition to the novel non-reference genome genes, we also identified genes absent in some accessions relative to the reference genome. We used the information of discordant paired-end reads at the deletion sites to collect evidence supporting these gene loss events. We identified 10 928 medium-size deletions between 229 and 308 146 bp (Supplementary Table S9 and Supplementary Data Set 2). Validation of the deletions by PCR suggested a false-positive rate of 26.6% in the dataset, which is higher than that (1 of 9) obtained with analysis of rice genome8 (Supplementary Fig. S3 and Table S9). Our close examination of the false-positive deletions showed that many of them correspond to the sites containing ambiguous 100–1000 N bps in the reference assembly as observed in our previous study.17 However, because some of the N-stretch-containing sites were shown to be positives in our validation, the predicted N-stretch-containing deletions were retained in our current data set (Supplementary Data Set 2). Of the deletions, 1737 were associated with gene loss events. The GO analysis of the 1737 lost genes yielded many enriched GO terms. Of the 30 significantly enriched GO terms in the biological process category, 12 were related to seed development, germination, and flower/leaf development reminiscent of the domestication-related traits (Supplementary Table S10). Domestication loci tend to show altered allele frequency.40 Most of the gene loss events in the 12 enriched GO terms did not show differential frequency between the cultivated and wild soybeans. However, 10 events showed distinct occurrence in the cultivated or wild soybeans (Supplementary Table S11), thereby suggesting that they may be candidate domestication genes. Functional studies of the 10 lost genes have been mostly performed in Arabidopsis, which is not a crop species, and only one gene, PAP15 (Glyma11g36510), has functionally been studied in several crop species including soybean.41,42 Overexpression of Arabidopsis PAP15 in soybean increased phytase activity in the soybean tissue.41 As numerous studies, including a recent report from Maupin and Rainey,43 have shown a significant relationship between phytate content and germination percentage of soybean seeds, which is a domestication-related trait,44 our result indicated that PAP15 is a strong domestication candidate gene.3.3. Variation across the soybean genomeWe identified ~9 million candidate SNPs in all 16 accessions by mapping reads for each accession to the reference genome sequence (NCBI dbSNP [ss7843006444–ss792422648]; viewable via our Soya Genome Browser (http://soya.rna.kr, accessed on 10 November 2013)). To obtain high-quality SNPs for population analyses, we excluded SNPs with missing data in any of the 16 accessions, as these would make subsequent inferences unreliable, yielding a final total of 3 871 469 high-quality SNPs (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S12). This represents the largest high-quality SNP dataset obtained in soybeans. In a low-depth resequencing analysis of 31 soybean accessions, Lam et al.5 reported 966 612 high-quality SNPs. Although most of the SNPs were located in intergenic regions, the number of genic SNPs, 788 809 (20.4%), are almost comparable with the total number of SNPs reported by Lam et al.5 A total of 1 109 412 non-singleton SNPs, which occurred in more than two accessions as homozygous SNPs, were identified (Supplementary Data Set 3). The non-singleton (common) SNPs can serve as a resource to identify tag SNPs that will be needed to capture most haplotype variation for GWAS and designing useful breeding programmes in soybean.45 Thus, our data may be useful to identify important soybean genes by serving as molecular markers for designing soybean SNP arrays and for breeding. Among the 3.8 million high-quality SNPs, 1 687 232 were found in cultivars. A large proportion (1 106 593; 65.6%) of these SNPs was also found in wild soybean accessions, indicating that most genetic variation in cultivated soybean is derived from variation in wild soybean. Of the remaining 580 639 (34.4%) cultivar-specific SNPs, some might have been false positives due to the relatively small wild soybean sample size. We identified 3 290 830 high-quality SNPs in the six wild soybeans, of which 66.4% were wild-specific. Of the SNPs in the wild soybeans, 49.9% were a single wild accession-specific, while 36.2% of the SNPs in the cultivated soybean were a single cultivated accession-specific (Supplementary Fig. S4). Collectively, our results suggested that wild soybean has a much more diverse gene pool than cultivars and thus, may contain useful genetic resources for improving soybean. Summary of SNPs and indels variations for cultivated and wild soybeans obtained from individual or multi-sample genotypingaVariations in coding sequences (CDS) of representative genes. As alternative transcripts were not included, the numbers presented should be regarded as approximate.Summary of SNPs and indels variations for cultivated and wild soybeans obtained from individual or multi-sample genotypingaVariations in coding sequences (CDS) of representative genes. As alternative transcripts were not included, the numbers presented should be regarded as approximate.In addition to SNPs, we also detected 1 769 260 candidate insertions (1–35 bp) and deletions (1–56 bp) (indels) by mapping reads with gaps allowed (Table 1) (NCBI dbSNP [ss7843006444–ss792422648]; Soya Genome Browser (http://soya.rna.kr, accessed on 10 November 2013)). After excluding indels with missing data in any of the 16 accessions, 499 865 high-quality indels were retained. We observed slightly more deletions than insertions. Single-base-pair indels were the most frequent, and numbers of longer indels decreased abruptly (Supplementary Fig. S5). Similar to trends observed for SNPs, the wild soybeans contained more indels than the cultivated soybeans (Supplementary Fig. S4 and Table 1), and rare variants comprised a large proportion of the total indels with ~73.2% of indels found in less than four accessions (Supplementary Fig. S4). Among the ~0.5 million high-quality indels, we identified 86.1% (430 564) of them in the wild soybeans, of which 79.8% were wild-specific. Most of the indels were located in intergenic regions, and 1.6% (8222) of the indels were located in coding sequences.To validate the variation calling results, we designed primer pairs from genomic regions of nine randomly selected genes as well as of two candidate domestication genes described below and performed Sanger sequencing. We sequenced 24.5 kb of soybean genomic DNA from each of the 16 accessions (GenBank: KF220802–KF221057). Of the 112 high-quality SNPs and 31 high-quality indels, except a Glyma20g32540 genomic region that showed unusually the high number of heterozygous variations, 109 (97% accuracy) and 28 (90% accuracy), respectively, were validated. Locations of SNPs/indels mapped in the Hwangkeum × IT182932 population17 and SNPs/indels called in this study agreed to each other. Our close examination of the Glyma20g32540 genomic sequence in the Williams 82 reference genome assembly suggested that the high heterozygous variation callings were caused by that reads from its homeologous genomic region containing Glyma10g35017, part of which was ambiguous with one 100-N bp, were mapped onto the Glyma20g32540 region. This notion was further confirmed by determining the ambiguous sequence by sequencing PCR products encompassing the 100-N-bp region. These results indicated that, due to the missing or ambiguous parts of the reference genome sequence, some degree of heterozygous SNP callings in these regions are inevitable. These validations also served to confirm the high quality of our SNP and indel dataset.3.4. Population structure of cultivated and wild soybeansTo examine the genetic population structure and relationships among the cultivated and wild soybeans, we constructed a neighbour-joining tree25,26 based on the 3 329 657 high-quality SNPs after excluding SNPs with heterozygous genotypes in some of the 16 accessions as well as SNPs identified in the unanchored 17 Mb scaffolds. The cultivated and wild soybeans formed two clearly separated subclades (Fig. 1b). Seoritae was most closely related to the wild soybeans in our phylogenetic tree. Pairwise distances between each pair of the wild soybeans were greater than those between any pairs of the cultivated soybeans, indicating that geographic distances of the collection sites in Korea are large enough to prevent intermixing of those wild soybeans analysed in this study, and that diversity between any pair of the collected wild soybeans is greater than those among all cultivated soybeans. When we compared pairwise distances between IT182848 and any of the wild and cultivated soybeans (Supplementary Table S13), the mean distance value between the IT182848 and wild soybeans is not significantly different from that between the IT182848 and cultivated soybeans (t-test, P = 0.324). Taken together, our phylogenetic tree analysis suggested that the cultivated soybean population is a subclade of the wild soybean population rather than an independent species or subspecies.To further investigate the population structure, we used the STRUCTURE program,27 which estimates individual ancestry and admixture proportions assuming that K populations exist based on a maximum-likelihood method.46 We analysed the data by increasing K (the number of populations) from 2 to 7 (Fig. 1c). We found a division between the cultivated and wild soybeans for K = 2. For K's ranging from 3 to 7, the variety of Seoritae consistently appeared to be slightly different from the remaining cultivated soybeans. Although numbers of the groups for K > 5 are smaller than that of K likely because of small population size, the number of groups within the wild soybean group increased with an increasing number of K up to three groups at K = 7. These results were consistent with the data from our phylogenetic analysis in that the cultivated soybeans are largely divided into three subgroups within a subclade (which was supported by results with an additional 31 soybeans described below), and each of the wild accessions contains more accession-specific SNPs than any of the cultivated accessions.The evolutionary history of soybean and the range of diversity of our resequenced cultivated soybeans were further revolved by incorporating the SNP data (downloaded from the BGI soybean resequencing ftp site; ftp://public.genomics.org.cn/BGI/soybean_resequencing/, accessed on 10 November 2013) from 17 wild and 14 cultivated soybean genomes resequenced at a low depth (~5×) reported by Lam et al.5 into our current SNP data set. We then extracted SNPs covered by all 31 accessions without the missing data or heterozygous genotypes. By intersecting these SNPs with the set of 3.3 million high-quality SNPs identified in our 16 accessions, we obtained 208 684 SNPs that could be used to analyse all 23 wild and 24 cultivated soybean accessions. The results again showed that cultivated soybeans represent a subclade of a large soybean clade, indicating that wild soybean is the direct progenitor of cultivated soybean (Supplementary Fig. S6). Excluding the four admixture accessions,5 which were also supported by our population structure analysis, the cultivated soybeans formed three well-defined subgroups, each of which contained at least one accession of the 10 accessions examined in this study. This indicated that the diversity level of the cultivated soybeans obtained in this study likely serves as a leverage for elucidation of the comprehensive diversity of the global cultivated soybeans. However, the six wild strains resequenced in this study were clustered into a single small clade, indicating that the diversity level of wild soybean in the East Asia is much greater than that obtained in this study.3.5. Identification of genome regions most affected by selection during soybean evolutionPhenotypic traits associated with domestication syndrome that have undergone repeated artificial selection usually have a reduction in nucleotide diversity and altered allele frequency in the domestication loci,40 as parameters that have successfully been used to identify putative artificially selected genes in crops and domesticated animals including maize (e.g.7,47), rice,8 cattle,48 and dogs.49 Our large SNP dataset (>3.8 M) from both the wild and cultivated soybeans provides an opportunity to identify the selected genes by comparing the polymorphism levels between cultivated and wild accessions.The processes of domestication, which is repeated artificial selection, can increase LD through the genome or in genomic segments flanking domestication loci.50 LD decayed to half of its maximum value at ~120 kb for wild soybeans and at ~340 kb for cultivated soybeans (Fig. 2a). These LD distances are quite similar to those (wild, ~75 kb and cultivated, ~150 kb) estimated by low-depth resequencing data of 17 wild and 14 cultivated soybeans.5 The LD distance of cultivated soybean is comparable with those of subpopulations of rice subspecies japonica, which ranged from 180 to 300 kb.8 However, LD distance of the wild soybeans is extremely longer than those of the wild plants analysed at the genome level to date, which are usually within <10 kb (e.g.8,51,52). This long distance is likely due to the selfing nature of wild soybeans unlike wild maize and rice species.45 Thus, our results suggest that although two to three times longer LD distance for the cultivated than that for wild soybean accessions indicated the existence of some degree of domestication or improvement bottleneck in the cultivated soybeans, the relatively long LD of the wild soybeans may allow us to easily identify approximate domestication or improvement regions using whole-genome resequencing data. However, it would be more difficult to pinpoint causal domestication gene(s) in the identified regions in soybean relative to rice or maize.

The chromosome number is indicated along the x-axis.We sought to identify regions with significantly lower levels of polymorphisms in the cultivated soybeans relative to the wild soybeans to detect selective sweeps driven by artificial selection.53 Thus, we used an ROD (ROD = 1 - pcul/pwild) method8 to identify regions of the genome most affected by selection during soybean evolution. ROD values were calculated based on the ratio of diversity in the cultivated soybeans to diversity in the wild soybeans (pcul/pwild) in 20% sliding windows along the entire genome except pericentromeric regions (Supplementary Table S4). We performed this analysis using windows of 10, 50, 100, 150, 200, and 500 kb with >0.98 as a cut-off ROD value (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. S7). The estimated genome diversity levels using p and <U+03B8>w parameters31 were >2-fold lower in the cultivated soybeans (p = 0.46 × 10-3 and <U+03B8>w = 0.46 × 10-3) compared with those in the wild soybeans (p = 1.08 × 10-3 and <U+03B8>w = 1.15 × 10-3). The windows having >0.98 ROD values that showed extremely low diversity in cultivars might have experienced cultivar-specific selective sweeps. Adjacent windows with >0.98 ROD values were grouped into candidate domestication regions (CDRs), which likely represent the effect of a single selective sweep, as previously suggested.7 The detected CDRs in each of the 10, 50, 100, 150, 200, and 500-kb windows covered ~15.5, 9.8, 7.2, 5.7, 4.4, and 1.6%, respectively, of the analysed soybean genome. Thus, the 100-kb windows showed genome coverage similar to that (~7.6%) of CDRs obtained in a recent maize study.7 Portions of the detected chromosomal regions with significant ROD values in different windows overlapped with each other. The regions detected by larger windows were a subset of those detected by smaller windows except for slight differences in window margins (Supplementary Fig. S7). We further calculated the divergence index FST using the same sliding window approach. We found that >80 and >50% of the windows with >0.98 ROD values were found in 25 and 10% upper tails, respectively, of the FST distribution in the larger than 100-kb windows (Supplementary Table S14 and Fig. S8). Relative to the extreme 90% distribution of japonica ROD regions falling in the 5% right tail of the genome-wide FST distribution,8 broader FST distribution of the soybean ROD regions is likely due to much longer LD distances (120 kb) of the wild soybeans relative to those of the wild rice and maize (<10 kb), as shown in our LD estimation described above. Collectively, our results, including the LD estimation, genome coverage of CDRs, and comparison between distributions of FST and ROD values, suggested that, in this study, the 100-kb window would maximize the precision for detecting the candidate regions under selection.We focused analyses on the 206 CDRs identified using the 100-kb windows, which contained 3068 genes (Supplementary Table S15). CDRs contained an average of 14.9 genes and had a mean size of 189 kb. The longest fragment extended to 880 kb, and the median was 140 kb. We considered all genes in these CDRs to be candidates of artificially selected genes. It is likely that many of these genes were not themselves subjected to selection, but rather hitchhiked along with the actual gene targeted for artificial selection. More analyses, including transgenic experiments, are needed to identify the actual selected genes.No canonical soybean domestication gene has been cloned yet. The genes annotated in the detected CDRs should prove useful, both for dissecting known quantitative trait loci (QTL) and identifying novel candidate domestication genes. When we searched for homologues of the domestication genes characterized in other crop plants such as rice, maize, and tomato, homologues of several canonical domestication genes including tga1, qSH1, fw2.2, PROG1, DAG1, DAG2, Tunicate1, and OsMADS56 were successfully identified in our putative artificial selection gene set (Supplementary Table S16). Although the majority of those canonical domestication genes have been functionally characterized in monocot crops distantly related to the soybean, most of CDRs containing their soybean homologues are, to our surprise, associated with QTL hotspots for domestication-related traits, such as plant height, leaflet shape, seed weight, pod dehiscence, and pod number. For example, Glyma17g08840 homologous to tga1 and Glyma17g08861 homologous to OsMADS56 are located in the same CDR on Gm17 and are associated with QTL that regulate multiple domestication-related traits, including leaflet length, plant weight, seed weight, and yield (Supplementary Table S16 and Fig. 3a). At the same CDR, we observed a putative transcription factor Glyma17g08761 containing TCP (TEOSINTE BRANCNED 1, cycloidea and PCF) domain characteristic of the maize gene tb1 that regulates the plant and inflorescence structure, although its TCP domain showed less degree of amino acid identity (~50%) than that of several other soybean TCP-containing proteins (~70%) to that of the tb1 protein (Fig. 3b). Thus, consistent with the multiple QTL reports by several studies, the CDR on Gm17 appears to be a hotspot for the domestication genes. However, its duplicated chromosomal segment from palaeopolyploidization,36 which is corresponding to the north end of Gm05, was not detected as a CDR.

POX is a functionally unknown domain named ‘associated with HOX’; homeobox is BEL1-type homeobox; MADS is SRF-type MADS box; K is K-box region.Many of causal mutations in the cloned domestication genes are amino acid changes, although regulatory changes almost equally contribute to causal mutations.53 To further characterize the genomic impact of domestication, we examined whether variations in coding sequences of the nine soybean genes homologous to canonical domestication genes described above changed the amino acid sequences of the expressed proteins (Table 2). Of the nine genes, three including Glyma16g02550.3, Glyma08g07260.3, and Glyma17g08861.1 did not contain any non-synonymous SNP (nsSNP). The remaining six genes contained various numbers of nsSNPs with different minor allele frequencies, most of which are <0.5. Interestingly, each of Glyma12g29991.3 (homologous to qSH1) and Glyma05g03660.8 (homologous to OsMADS56) contained a single fixed nsSNP between the resequenced cultivated and wild soybean populations. Both differences encode non-conservative amino acid substitutions and may affect protein function (Fig. 3c). In case of Glyma17g14191.1 (homologous to OsMADS56), we observed two conservative amino acid substitutions and one 4 amino acid insertion at a short amino acid span between positions 178 and 183 fixed between the cultivated and wild soybeans. In all the three genes, the fixed amino acid substitutions lie outside of the conserved domains (Fig. 3c), consistent with the previous cloning studies of canonical domestication genes including tga154 and PROG1.55Coding sequence diversity and amino acid differences in 10 cultivated and 6 wild resequenced soybean genomes at domestication candidate genes homologous to canonical domestication genesCul, cultivated soybean; Wild, wild soybean; CDS, coding sequence; MAF, minor allele frequency; nd, not detected.aThe format for an amino acid difference is X#Y, where X is the amino acid of the Williams 82 reference genome, # is the position of the substitution, and Y is the new amino acid; and X#_Y#insAB, where X and Y are the amino acids of the Williams 82 reference genome, #s are the positions of the insertion, and insAB indicates A and B amino acids were inserted.Coding sequence diversity and amino acid differences in 10 cultivated and 6 wild resequenced soybean genomes at domestication candidate genes homologous to canonical domestication genesCul, cultivated soybean; Wild, wild soybean; CDS, coding sequence; MAF, minor allele frequency; nd, not detected.aThe format for an amino acid difference is X#Y, where X is the amino acid of the Williams 82 reference genome, # is the position of the substitution, and Y is the new amino acid; and X#_Y#insAB, where X and Y are the amino acids of the Williams 82 reference genome, #s are the positions of the insertion, and insAB indicates A and B amino acids were inserted.We searched for significantly enriched GO terms among genes in CDRs and identified several GO terms reminiscent of domestication-related traits or molecular features of cloned domestication genes (Supplementary Table S17). The candidate genes were enriched in the GO terms related to seed development, morphology, growth, and transcriptional regulation. Interestingly, the terms ‘embryo development ending in seed dormancy’ and ‘response to abscisic acid stimulus’ in the biological process category, which are related to seed germination, were also observed to be enriched terms (P < 0.001) in the GO analysis of the lost genes described above. In the molecular function and cellular component categories, several terms such as ‘DNA binding’ and ‘nucleus’, which are related to transcription factors, were enriched (P < 0.001). This is somewhat consistent with the fact that the majority of domestication genes obtained by map-based cloning have been transcription factor genes.53 Several GO terms related to transport and stress responses, which play important roles in improving yield and stress resistance,56 were also identified.Genes regulating plant morphology, to which most of the domestication-related traits belong, typically show pleiotropic effects as exemplified by the ABC model.57 These genes may appear in more than two enriched GO terms relevant to domestication-related traits in the biological process category. By searching for candidate domestication genes enriched in multiple GO terms, we found three such genes as ROPGEF12 (homologous to Glyma07g02250, Glyma13g43380, and Glyma15g01930), TCP4 (Glyma12g14200), and TCP5 (Glyma17g08761) (Supplementary Table S18). ROPGEF12 is involved in polar growth of pollen tubes in Arabidopsis58 and is expressed differentially during the pollination process in the maize.59 Among the three ROPGEF12 homologues, Glyma07g02250 was particularly interesting because its chromosomal location was associated with multiple QTL for plant morphology reported by several independent studies (Supplementary Table S18). The TCP5 homologue, Glyma17g08761, was observed in the CDR-containing homologues of tga1 and OsMADS56 on Gm17 described above. The soybean genome encodes 57 predicted TCPs. By examining the genes in CDRs, we found two additional TCPs, Glyma05g03610 and Glyma17g14160, whose gene symbols have not been assigned. Our phylogenetic analysis showed that Glyma12g14200 and Glyma17g08761 belong to the CIN clade of Class II TCPs, and Glyma05g03610 and Glyma17g14160 belong to Class I TCPs60 (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. S9). These results suggested that our CDRs do not contain a TCP gene belonging to the CYC/TB1 clade containing the canonical domestication gene tb1. Nevertheless, as most of the functionally studied TCPs are involved in cell proliferation and branching, these four soybean genes are strong candidate domestication genes. This notion is further supported by that these genes are associated with multiple QTL for plant morphology (Supplementary Table S18). Interestingly, the three ROPGEF12 homologues are located on the three duplicated chromosomal segments from palaeopolyploidization36 (Fig. 4). Two TCP genes, Glyma05g03610 and Glyma17g14160, whose TCP domains are 100% identical but whose overall identity is 79%, are also located on the duplicated chromosomal segments (Supplementary Fig. S10). These observations likely reflect the important role that co-selection between these ancient duplicated segments has had in soybean domestication. Selection of three ROPGEF12 homeologs.

ConclusionsIn this study, we have provided a large genome variation dataset for the wild and cultivated soybeans. Millions of variations in the representative wild and cultivated soybean strains provided an opportunity to finely resolve the domestication or improvement history of cultivated soybean. The population structure and phylogenetic analyses not only support the hypothesis that cultivated soybeans (G. max) are a subclade of their progenitor wild soybeans (G. soja), but also disprove the hypothesis of multiple soybean domestication events in East Asia. We identified thousands of candidate genes that may have been artificially selected during the soybean domestication or improvement. The SNPs will be useful as dense markers of genome variation for marker-assisted mapping of important soybean traits as well as for pinpointing agronomically important genes in soybeans. The candidate genes selected during domestication may be agronomically important, and our results generally support that a translational genomics study would be productive for identifying the soybean domestication genes. Taken together with the data from Lam et al.5 and from Li et al.,61 which was published after the submission of the present paper with 25 soybean genomes sequenced to a low depth with a mean of 3.38×, the data generated in this study provide a valuable resource for improving soybean as well as elucidating the origin and evolution of soybean.Authors' contributionsW.H.C., N.J., N.K., and S.C.J. wrote the article.

IntroductionThe cultivated strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa) is a globally consumed crop species that is grown around the world; in the USA (37.5%), Europe (36.7%), Asia (16.3%), Africa (8.6%), and Oceania (0.8%).1Fragaria x ananassa is an octoploid species (2n = 8× = 56) with an estimated genome size of 1C = 708–720 Mb.2,3 In addition to its polyploidy, allogamous behaviour in F. x ananassa contributes further complexity to the genome structure. Until now, three genome composition models, namely AABBBBCC,4 AAA'A'BBBB,5 and AAA'A'BBB'B',6 have been proposed based on cytological and genetic evidence. Of the three models, the most recently proposed model, AAA'A'BBB'B',6 is considered the most probable candidate, since several studies have reported the disomic inheritance of large numbers of DNA markers,7–9 which suggests an allopolyploid genome composition in F.x ananassa.The genus Fragaria belongs to the family Rosaceae and is comprised of one cultivated (F.x ananassa) and 24 wild species, including 13 diploids, 5 tetraploids, 1 hexaploid, 4 octoploids, and 1 decaploid.10,11 The geographic origins of the wild species are distributed throughout Eurasia, North and South America, and Japan. Fragaria x ananassa originated in the 1700s from a natural hybridization between two octoploids, F. virginiana and F. chiloensis.12 However, the history of evolution from diploid to octoploid species in the genus Fragaria remains controversial. Davis et al.3 proposed that F. vesca, F. nubicola, and F. orientalis were possible progenitors to octoploids, based on the polygenic analysis of internal transcribed spacer sequences of rDNA and chloroplast DNA performed by Potter et al.13 Rousseau-Gueutin et al.14 hypothesized that the evolutionary history was based on five subgenomic entries, X1, X2, Y1, Y2, and Z, classified according to two nuclear genes, GBSSI-2 and DHAR. They proposed that the genomes of wild octoploids consisted of Y1'Y1'Y1""Y1""ZZZZ or Y1Y1Y1Y1ZZZZ genomes. The Y1 genomes were considered to be derived from two diploid species, F. vesca or F. mandshurica, via a tetraploid, F. orientalis, whereas F. iinumae was presumed to be the progenitor of the Z genome.Fragaria vesca, which is the most plausible progenitor of F.x ananassa, was selected as the genomic reference for Fragaria. Using a fourth-generation inbred line and the Roche 454, Illumina Solexa, and Life Technologies SOLiD platforms, the whole-genome sequence of F. vesca was published in 2011.15 According to the report, a total of 209.8 Mb were assembled into 272 scaffolds, and 34 809 candidate genes were identified by gene prediction. Later, the original v1.0 pseudomolecule assembly was updated to v1.1.16The F. vesca genome sequences have contributed greatly to advances in molecular genetic analysis in F. x ananassa8,9 and are expected to assist in the identification of genes related to agriculturally important traits in F. x ananassa, such as flowering time,17 male sterility,18 and stress resistance.19 However, consultation of the F. vesca genome has limitations, particularly for F. x ananassa-specific genome regions or genome regions derived from other progenitors. Therefore, whole-genome sequencing of F. x ananassa is needed for a comprehensive understanding of the genome structure of the species, in parallel with reference to the F. vesca genome.Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have revolutionized de novo whole-genome sequencing in most species. This is especially true in plant species, for which genomes are relatively large and complex in structure compared with non-plant genomes.20,21 Up to now, whole-genome sequences have been published in more than 50 plant species, including five species in Rosaceae: F. vesca,15 apple,22 pear,23 peach,24 and Chinese plum.25 However, to our knowledge, no reports of de novo whole-genome sequencing have been published for any polyploid species. As with strawberry, diploid progenitor species have been employed to advance the genomic understanding of other polyploid crops, such as potato,26 cotton,27 and banana.28 Genome sequencing of polyploid species has been avoided, because the homoeology of subgenomes made sequence assembly difficult. To overcome this difficulty, we attempted to construct a virtual ‘reference genome’ in octoploid strawberry, F. x ananassa, as a first step for whole-genome sequencing of the species.In this study, de novo whole-genome sequencing was performed in F. x ananassa using the Illumina (Illumina, Inc., CA, USA) and Roche 454 sequencing platforms (Roche Diagnostics, IN, USA). A virtual reference genome, which integrated genome sequences of homoeologous chromosomes, was constructed by eliminating heterozygous bases in the process of sequence assembly. In a previous study, macrosynteny at the chromosome level was observed between the linkage groups (LGs) in an F.x ananassa genetic map and the genome of F. vesca.9 Therefore, we aligned the generated F.x ananassa scaffolds with the pseudomolecules of F. vesca.15 In parallel, four wild Fragaria species, representing genetic diversity in the genus Fragaria, were selected based on simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers and were subjected to whole-genome sequencing using an Illumina platform. The assembled sequences of the wild species, along with the heterozygous F. x ananassa sequences, were mapped onto the F. x ananassa reference genome and used to elucidate the genome structures of the Fragaria species.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materialsA Japanese variety, ‘Reikou’, and its progeny (S1) were subjected to genome sequencing as representatives of F. x ananassa. ‘Reikou’ was bred in the Chiba Prefectural Agriculture and Forestry Research Center. Like other strawberry varieties, ‘Reikou’ maintains heterozygosity in the genome. The S1 progenies were sequenced for SNP discovery within ‘Reikou’ for further analysis (data were not shown in this study). A total of 20 wild Fragaria species with a diverse range of polyploidy were used in phylogenetic analyses with SSR markers (Supplementary Table S1). Along with the 20 wild species, the following four Japanese F. x ananassa varieties were subjected to the phylogenic analysis: ‘Reikou’, ‘Hokowase’, ‘Sachinoka’, and ‘Akihime’. Whole-genome sequencing was subsequently performed for four wild species, F. iinumae, F. nipponica, F. nubicola, and F. orientalis. The genomic DNA was extracted from young leaves using a DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Inc., CA, USA). DNA quantification and quality checks were performed using a Nanodrop ND1000 spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technologies, DE, USA) and 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis, respectively.2.2. Phylogenetic analysisGenomic polymorphisms from 24 Fragaria accessions (listed in Supplementary Table S1) were analysed using 632 F. x ananassa and F. vesca expressed sequence tag derived SSR markers that randomly mapped onto the 28 LGs of the consensus genetic map of F. x ananassa9 (Supplementary Table S2). PCR was performed as described in Isobe et al.9 The PCR products were separated using an ABI 3730xl fluorescent fragment analyser (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA). Polymorphisms were investigated using the GeneMapper software (Applied Biosystems). The genetic distances and Jaccard's similarity coefficients of all combinations of any two samples were calculated from the genotypic data using the GGT2 software.29 The hierarchical cluster analysis with the multiscale bootstrap was performed for 1000 replications with Ward's method by pvclust package30 for the R software (http://www.r-project.org/).2.3. Genome sequencingWhole-genome shotgun sequencing was carried out using the Roche 454 GS FLX+ and Illumina GAIIx/Hiseq 1000 platforms (Roche Diagnostics; Illumina, Inc., Fig. 1, Supplementary Table S3). Total cellular DNA of the ‘Reikou’ variety of F.x ananassa was used for the construction of single-end (SE) and paired-end (PE) libraries for the Roche 454 sequencing platform according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Insert sizes of the PE libraries were 3, 5, 8, and 20 kb. The strategy and status of sequencing and assembly of the reference genome of F. x ananassa (FANhybrid_r1.2).

PE, SE, and MP represent PE, SE, and MP reads, respectively. The FANhybrid_r1.2 sequences (a black box) are consisted with the 454 scaffolds gap-closed with Illumina reads and Illumina-specific assembled sequences (gray boxes).Illumina PE and mate-pair (MP) libraries were constructed from total cellular DNAs of ‘Reikou’, five S1 progenies of ‘Reikou’, and four wild species, F. iinumae, F. nipponica, F. nubicola, and F. orientalis, according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table S3). The expected insert sizes and read lengths of the libraries ranged from 290 bp to 2 kb, and 51–101 bp, respectively. Of the developed Illumina libraries, two ‘Reikou’ PE libraries (with insertion sizes of 600 and 400 bp) were subjected to genome sequencing by the Illumina GAIIx, whereas other Illumina libraries were analysed by the Illumina HiSeq 1000. The mixed sequences generated from the five S1 progenies were regarded as equivalent to the parental ‘Reikou’ genome and were assembled together with sequence data from the ‘Reikou’ libraries.

Quality control of Illumina readsThe Illumina reads were preprocessed for quality control using the FastX-toolkit, ver. 0.0.13 (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/). After quality filtering, the sequences that included an N or were trimmed according to the following criteria were excluded from further analysis: (i) bases with quality value <10; (ii) probable artefact reads; and (iii) adaptor sequences consisting of more than five bases at the 3' terminal. The genome size of F.x ananassa and the four wild relatives were estimated, based on a k-mer = 17 frequency of the Illumina reads, by using Jellyfish ver. 1.1.6.312.5. Assembly of the F.xananassa reference genomeThe 454 reads were assembled using Newbler 2.7 (Roche Diagnostics) in a heterozygotic mode (Fig. 1). The heterozygous bases between the homoeologous or heterozygous genomes were eliminated by the overlap layout consensus method, with sequence identity of 90%. The gaps on the scaffolds were closed by GapCloser 1.10 (p = 31) (http://soap.genomics.org.cn/soapdenovo.html) for the Illumina reads. In parallel, all the F.x ananassa Illumina reads were assembled using SOAPdenovo v1.0532 with k-mer = 75. After the assembly of the Illumina reads, the gaps on the scaffolds were closed by GapCloser 1.10 (p = 31). Illumina-specific scaffolds and contigs, when compared with the 454 scaffolds, were selected by conducting BLASTN33 searches with an E-value cut-off of 1E-10. To eliminate heterozygous bases, the Illumina-specific scaffolds and contigs were re-assembled according to the approach employed to assemble the fire ant genome.34 First, the sequences of Illumina-specific scaffolds and unassembled contigs were divided into 300-bp lengths with 200-bp overlaps. The divided sequences were then re-assembled using Newbler 2.7 in the heterozygotic mode. In cases when the divided sequences were not joined by Newbler 2.7, they were merged based on the overlapping sequences.Probable contaminating sequences on the 454 scaffolds and the Illumina-specific sequences were identified and removed using BLASTN searches against the chloroplast genome sequence of F. vesca (accession number: NC_015206.1), mitochondrial genome sequence of Arabidopsis thaliana (accession number: NC_001284.2), bacterial genome sequences registered in NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), and vector sequences from UniVec (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/vecscreen/univec/) with an E-value cut-off of 1E-10 and length coverage of =10%. The cleaned Illumina scaffolds, contigs, and singlets were integrated with the 454 scaffolds and designated as FANhybrid_r1.2.2.6. Assembly of Illumina reads from F. x ananassa and wild speciesThe assembly of Illumina reads from F.x ananassa was performed along with that of reads from the four wild species, F. iinumae, F. nipponica, F. nubicola, and F. orientalis (Fig. 2). The Illumina reads in each species were assembled using SOAPdenovo v1.05 with k-mer = 75. The gaps on the scaffolds in each species were closed by GapCloser 1.10 (p = 31). Probable contaminating sequences were identified and removed as described in the above section. The cleaned scaffolds and contigs =300 bp in length were designated FAN_r1.1 (F.x ananassa), FII_r1.1 (F. iinumae), FNI_r1.1 (F. nipponica), FNU_r1.1 (F. nubicola), and FOR_r1.1 (F. orientalis).2.7. Repetitive sequencesProbable repetitive sequences in the assembled genome of the Fragaria species were identified by RepeatScout35 with default parameters based on the discovery of repetitive substrings in the sequences. In parallel, similarity searches and repeat masking were performed by RepeatMasker (http://www.repeatmasker.org) on the assembled genome sequences of the Fragaria species against known repetitive sequences registered in RepBase.36 To identify novel repetitive sequences, the assembled genome sequences, with known repetitive sequences masked, were subjected to second-round similarity search by RepeatMasker against probable repetitive sequences detected by RepeatScout. The SSR motifs with equal or greater numbers of defined repeats were searched for in exons, introns, and entire regions on the assembled genomes using SciRoKo with misa mode.37 The defined numbers of repeats in mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, and hexa-motifs were 12, 6, 7, 5, 5, and 5, respectively.2.8. Assignment of RNA-encoding genesTransfer RNA genes were predicted by using tRNAscan-SE ver. 1.2338 with default parameters. Ribosomal RNA genes were identified by BLAT searches in BLAST output format, with an E-value cut-off of 1E-10 and length cut-off of 70 bp, using 5.8S rRNA (accession number: X15589.1), 18S rRNA (accession number: X15590.1), and 26S rRNA (accession number: X58118.1), in F.x ananassa.2.9. Gene prediction and annotationThe FANhybrid_r1.2 and the five Illumina-assembled genomes were subjected to gene prediction and modelling using Augustus 2.739 with a training set from A. thaliana and the following parameters; gene model = partial; protein, introns, start, stop, cds, coding seq, gff3, and UTR = on, and alternatives-from-evidence and alternatives-from-sampling = true. The genes related to transposable elements (TEs) were predicted according to the domain and product names of genes identified by similarity search in two databases, the Interpro database40 and the NCBI's non-redundant protein sequence (NR) database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Similarity searches in the former and later databases were performed by InterProScan41 and BLASTX33 with an E-value cut-off of 1.0 and 1E-10, respectively. The Gypsy-type TEs were further identified by a search using the hmmscan module in HMMER 3.042 against the hidden Markov model in the Gypsy Database 2.0.432.10. Comparative analysis between F. x ananassa and wild speciesBLAT searches44 were performed for the sequences in FANhyblid_r1.2 against the pseudomolecules of F. vesca (v1.1) with -minscore = 100 and -minIdentity = 95. Subsequently, the sequences in FANhybrid_r1.2 were aligned with the genomic sequences of F. vesca based on the results of the BLAT searches. Furthermore, the hit regions were selected according to the following criteria: (match score + number of gaps in query) × 100/query length (%) = 80, hit region in query × 100/query length (%) = 80, match score/query length = 25, 80 = (hit region in subject × 100/query length) = 120. The best alignments in each query sequence were identified approximately roughly identified using the pslReps program44 in BLAT with –minCover = 0.20. Validation and modification of the results were manually performed by eye. Furthermore, similarity searches were performed for the five Illumina-assembled genome sequences against FANhybrid_r1.2 by BLAT, and these sequences were aligned with the genome sequences of FANhybrid_r1.2 using the pslReps program as described above. In parallel, the BLASTN searches with an E-value cut-off of 1E-10 were performed between each possible pair of assembled genomes to investigate sequence similarity across the assembled genome sequences.BLAT searches were also performed for the five assembled genomes against the 34 809 candidate genes estimated on the F. vesca genome15 with the same parameters as described above. In addition, a total of 104 annotated candidate genes in F. vesca13 were selected for further investigation of degree of duplication in the assembled Fragaria genome sequences. Similarity searches between these 104 genes and the assembled sequences were performed by the FASTA36 program,45 based on a cut-off value of 90% identity. In parallel, Illumina-assembled genes predicted by Augustus 2.7 were subjected to cluster analysis with the 34 809 F. vesca candidate genes by using CD-hit v4.6.146 with the following parameters: c = 0.8, aS = 0.1.3. Results3.1. Phylogenetic analysis of Fragaria species with SSR markersA total of 632 SSR markers, which generated 954 loci mapped onto the consensus map of F.x ananassa,9 were employed for phylogenetic analysis of 20 wild Fragaria species and 4 F.x ananassa varieties. The average number of observed allelic peaks per marker was 11.1, ranging from 1 to 57 in all the tested species, with an average of 1.8 in each line, ranging from 1.0 in Fragaria daltoniana to 3.2 in F.x ananassa ‘Hokowase’. The genetic distances between all combinations of any two lines were calculated based on the presence or absence of 10 830 allelic peaks derived from the 632 markers. The genetic distances among the 24 lines ranged from 0.07 to 0.33 (Supplementary Table S4). On the constructed phylogenetic tree, the 24 lines were classified into four clusters (Supplementary Fig. S1A). The octoploids were clearly distinguished from Fragaria species of other ploidy (cluster C). Among the octoploids, two wild species, F. virginiana and F. chiloensis, were distinguishable from the cultivated species, F.x ananassa. The clusters A, B, and D consisted of six Fragaria species each. The relative genetic relations did not show large differences between a phylogenetic trees constructed with all samples and di-, tetra-, or octoploid-specific trees. Based on the phylogenetic analysis, the following four wild species were selected as representatives of Clusters A, B, and D for subsequent whole-genome sequencing: F. nipponica (Cluster A), F. iinumae (Cluster B), F. nubicola (Cluster D), and F. orientalis (Cluster D). Plural species were selected from Cluster D, because the cluster showed the closest genetic distance to Cluster C.Genetic distances were investigated for each of the LGs on the consensus map according to the locations of the tested markers9 (Supplementary Table S5). The mean genetic distances between F.x ananassa ‘Reikou’ and the 20 wild relatives ranged from 0.24 (LG3A) to 0.34 (LG3D). In comparison, among the homoeologous groups (HGs), HG5 showed the least variation between the corresponding LGs (0.28–0.30), whereas HG3 showed the greatest variation between the corresponding LGs (0.24–0.34). Fragaria vesca and F. chinensis showed closer genetic distances to F.x ananassa than any other diploid wild species for every LG except LG5D, for which the closest diploid species was F. iinumae.3.2. Genome sequencing and quality controlA total of 6 211 718 reads were obtained from F.x ananassa SE and PE libraries using the Roche 454 GS FLX+ platform (Supplementary Table S3). The number of obtained Illumina reads in F.x ananassa, F. iinumae, F. nipponica, F. nubicola, and F. orientalis were 4 219 377 380, 1 078 824 432, 1 075 841 020, 1 074 353 610, and 1 050 815 546, respectively. After quality control, 33% of the Illumina reads were excluded from further analysis. Consequently, the total bases that were subjected to subsequent analysis were 276.6, 70.8, 72.2, 74.3, and 74.5 Gb, in F.x ananassa, F. iinumae, F. nipponica, F. nubicola, and F. orientalis, respectively.3.3. Estimation of genome size based on the Illumina readsThe genome sizes of F.x ananassa and the four wild relatives were estimated based on a k-mer = 17 frequency of the Illumina reads (Supplementary Fig. S2). The genome sizes of the five Fragaria species were estimated as follows based on the distributions of distinct kmers along with consideration of the F. vesca genome size (209.8 Mb)13 and polyploidy in each species: F.x ananassa = 692 Mb, F. iinumae = 221 Mb, F. nipponica = 208 Mb, F. nubicola = 202 Mb, and F. orientalis= 349.3 Mb.3.4. Assembly of the F. x ananassa reference genomeAll 454 reads were assembled using Newbler 2.7 in the heterozygotic mode (Fig. 1). During assembly, heterozygous bases on the 454 reads were adopted based on the comparison of depth and accuracy between the bases. After the gaps were closed by GapCloser 1.0, a total of 7598 scaffolds consisting of 101 218 723 bp with 19 520 552 N were obtained (Supplementary Table S6). The longest contig was 348 406 bp, and N50 was 46 803 bp.In parallel, a total of 4 602 723 scaffolds and contigs consisting of 1 301 006 845 bp were generated using SOAPdenovo v1.05 and GapCloser 1.10. After the BLASTN search of the Illumina sequences against the 454 scaffolds, 1 153 521 Illumina-specific contigs were obtained, comprising 213.5 Mb. To assemble the Illumina-specific sequences using Newbler 2.7, the sequences that were longer than 300 bp were divided into 300-bp long sequences with 200-bp overlaps. As a result, a total of 1 437 769 Illumina sequences were re-assembled onto 40 416 215 bp (Supplementary Table S6). In addition, 137 608 unassembled singlets were obtained, including 10 330 repeats and 44 686 outliers. The total length of Illumina-specific sequences was 72 010 849 bp, and the N50 was 411 bp. The integrated 454 scaffolds and Illumina-specific sequences were qualified as a reference genome for F.x ananassa, designated FANhybrid_r1.2. The number of sequences, total length, N50, and GC% of the FANhybrid_r1.2 were: 211 588 sequences, 173 229 572 bp, 5137 bp, and 38.4%, respectively (Table 1). Statistics regarding the assembled genome sequences for F.x ananassa and four wild Fragaria speciesStatistics regarding the assembled genome sequences for F.x ananassa and four wild Fragaria species3.5. Illumina genome assembly in F. x ananassa and wild Fragaria speciesA total of 276.6 Gb of F.x ananassa Illumina reads were assembled by SOAPdenovo v1.05 and GapCloser 1.10. After excluding sequences of contaminating DNA, the number of sequences and total length of the Illumina-assembled sequences were 4 366 193 sequences and 1 264 283 529 bp, respectively (Supplementary Table S7). The assembled sequences that were shorter than 300 bp in length accounted for 86% of the total were excluded from further analysis. The selected sequences were totalled 697 765 214 bp with 39 320 129 Ns, and designated as FAN_r1.1. N50 and maximum length of the FAN_r1.1 were 2201 and 51 398 bp, respectively (Table 1).In parallel, de novo genome sequence assembly was performed for Illumina reads of the four wild species using SOAPdenovo v1.05 and GapCloser 1.10. As with F.x ananassa, assembled sequences of <300 bp in length were excluded from further analysis. The remaining sequences of F. iinumae, F. nipponica, F. nubicola, and F. orientalis were designated as FII_r1.1, FNI_r1.1, FNU_r1.1, and FOR_r1.1, respectively (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S7). The total length and N50 in the assembled genome sequences of the four wild species ranged from 199.6 (FII_r1.1) to 214.2 Mb (FOR_r1.1), and 722 (FOR_r1.1) to 3309 bp (FII_r1.1), respectively. GC% ranged from 38.1% (FOR_1.1) to 39.1% (FII_r1.1).3.6. Repetitive sequencesThe total length of repetitive sequences identified by RepeatMasker was 8 697 730 bp in FANhydrid_r1.2 (5.0% of the total length); 328 305 437 bp in FAN_r1.1 (47.1%); 63 285 682 bp in FII_r1.1 (31.7%); 52 580 277 bp in FNI_r1.1 (25.5%); 49 943 156 bp in FNU_r1.1 (24.5%); and 56 272 506 bp in FOR_r1.1 (26.3%) (Supplementary Table S8). When the same approach was applied to the F. vesca genome (v1.1), 51 223 702 bp (24.8%) was comprised of repeat sequences. Most of the identified repeats in the assembled genomes, except FANhybrid_r1.2, were novel repeats that were not registered in RepBase. The ratios of the novel repeats to the total lengths of Illumina-assembled genome sequences ranged from 22.6% (FNU_r1.1) to 44.9% (FAN_r1.1), whereas that in the FANhybrid_r1.2 was 3.9%. The ratio of the total length of known interspersed repeats to the total genome length ranged from 0.35% (FANhybrid_r1.2) to 0.94% (FAN_r1.1). The Class 1 long terminal repeat retrotransposons, including Copia and Gypsy types, were the most frequency observed in the known interspersed repeats.The total numbers of identified di- to hexa-nucleotide SSRs were 22 456 (FANhybrid_r1.2), 110 251 (FAN_r1.1), 32 487 (FII_r1.1), 35 188 (FNI_r1.1), 34 556 (FNU_r1.1), and 32 340 (FOR_r1.1) (Supplementary Table S9). In each genome, di-nucleotide motifs were the most frequently observed type of SSR, ranging from 57.6% (FANhybrid_r1.2) to 69.6% (FII_r1.1). The (AT)n motif was the most abundantly observed in the Illumina-assembled genomes, whereas (AG)n was the most frequent motif in FANhybrid_r1.2.3.7. RNA-encoding genesThe total number of putative tRNA-encoding genes in FANhybrid_r1.2 was 300, which was less than in the F. vesca scaffolds (Supplementary Table S10). Large numbers of putative tRNA-encoding genes (1720) were identified in FAN_r1.1, while 424–514 tRNA-encoding genes were predicted in the four wild Illumina-assembled genomes. The ratios of putative tRNA genes encoding amino acids ranged from 83.7% (FOR_r1.1) to 92.4% (FII_r1.1). The total number of predicted rRNA-encoding genes in FANhybrid_r1.2, FAN_r1.1, FII_r1.1, FNI_r1.1, FNU_r1.1, and FOR_r1.1 were 18, 86, 37, 53, 19, and 45, respectively (Supplementary Table S11).3.8. Gene prediction and annotationThe total number of predicted genes in FANhybrid_r1.2 was 45 377; more genes than in F. vesca (v1.0) but less than in other assembled genome sequences (Supplementary Table S12). The total sequence length and N50 were 32 959 863 and 1290 bp, respectively. Total numbers of predicted genes in the wild Fragaria sequences ranged from 76 760 (FII_r1.1) to 99 674 (FOR_r1.1). Approximately 3.7-fold more total sequence length were identified in FAN_r1.1 compared with FANhybrid_r1.2. The N50 of the five Illumina-assembled genomes ranged from 484 (FOR_r1.1) to 948 bp (FII_r1.1).The predicted genes were classified into TE genes versus non-TE genes (designated as intrinsic genes, Supplementary Table S13). The following three gene categories were subsequently notated: partial genes (without start or stop codons), pseudogenes (with in-frame stop codons), and short genes (encoding fewer than 49 aa). No notations were given for predicted full-length gene sequences framed by start and stop codons. In FANhybrid_r1.2, 41 730 sequences (92% of the total sequences) were predicted to be intrinsic genes, while the other 3647 (8%) were annotated as TEs. Among the intrinsic genes in FANhybrid_r1.2, 41% did not fall neatly into any of the three categories. This ratio was higher than that in the Illumina-assembled genome sequences.3.9. Comparative analysis between the genomes of cultivated and wild Fragaria speciesOf the 211 588 sequences in FANhybrid_r1.2, 120 703 showed significant similarity to pseudomolecules of F. vesca (v1.1) by BLAT search (Supplementary Table S14). The lengths of the mapped FANhybrid_r1.2 sequences in each of the seven chromosomes ranged from 13 922 608 (Chr1) to 26 401 015 bp (Chr6). The FANhybrid_r1.2 sequences showing significant similarity according to the BLAT search were well aligned across the F. vesca pseudomolecules (Supplementary Fig. S3). The mapped FANhybrid_r1.2 sequences included 145 387 993 bp of F. vesca pseudomolecules, which covered 70.3% of the total length (Supplementary Table S14). Furthermore, the MEGABLAST47 search (identity% =90 and E-value cut-off of 1E-50) was performed for the 90 885 FANhybrid_r1.2 sequences that did not align with the F. vesca pseudomolecules, against the wild Fragaria genome sequences. Of the 90 885 FANhybrid_r1.2 sequences, 22 145 showed significant similarity against the F. vesca genome sequences, whereas 68 740 did not (Supplementary Table S15). A total of 39 692 FANhybrid_r1.2 sequences (total length: 10 742 467 bp) showed no significant similarity to any of the genome sequences, and were concluded to be F. x ananassa-specific. In parallel, BLASTN searches were performed between all pairwise combinations of the assembled genomes (Supplementary Table S16). The total length of non-homologous sequences in FANhybrid_r1.2 compared with FAN_r1.1 was 1.4 Mb, whereas that in FAN_r1.1 compared with FANhybrid_r1.2 was 281.7 kb. Comparison with each of the five wild species revealed that the ratios of non-homologous sequences to total sequences of FANhybrid_r1.2 and FAN_r1.1 ranged from 4.7% (FNU_r1.1) to 5.6% (FOR_r1.1), and from 1.3% (FNU_r1.1) to 1.8% (F. vesca v1.1), respectively. In comparisons between the wild species, the smallest ratio of non-homologous sequences to the total was observed in FNU_r1.1 against FNI_r1.1 (0.66%), whereas the largest ratio was observed in FNI_r1.1 against FII_r1.1 (2.61%).A BLAT search mapped 142 699 FAN_r1.1 sequences (61.8% of the total) onto the FANhybrid_r1.2 sequence (Supplementary Table S17). Multiple FAN_r1.1 sequences were often mapped onto the same FANhybrid_r1.2 sequences. The numbers of single, double, triple, and quadruple FAN_r1.1 sequences that mapped onto the same FANhybrid_r1.2 sequences were 64 828 (45.4% of the mapped total), 31 922 (22.4%), 13 656 (9.6%), and 6289 (4.4%), respectively. The FANhybrid_r1.2 sequences that mapped onto five or more FAN_r1.1 sequences tended to be classified as repetitive sequences (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S4). The sequence of each wild species was then mapped onto the entire genomic sequence of FANhybrid_r1.2. The ratios of single and double sequences from the wild Illumina-assembled genomes that mapped onto the same FANhybrid_r1.2 sequences ranged from 62.4% (FOR_r1.1) to 87.3% (FII_r1.1), and from 9.5% (FII_r1.1) to 18.5% (FOR_r1.1), respectively. The ratios of single and double sequences from the F. vesca genome that mapped onto the same FANhybrid_r1.2 sequences were 72.7 and 4.8%, respectively. Fragaria vesca generated the largest number of top-hit sequences in each chromosome, followed by F. iinumae (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S5). The BLASTN search was furthermore performed for the FAN_r1.1 against the wild Fragaria genome sequences. Of the 625 966 FAN_r1.1 sequences, 5447 (0.9%) were not identified significant similarity to the wild Fragaria sequences (Supplementary Table S18). The ratios of top-hit sequences in FII_r1.1, FNI_r1.1, FNU_r1.1, FOR_r1.1, and F. vesca (v1.1) to the FAN_r1.1 sequences were 39.1, 8.9, 8.1, 8.2, and 34.8%, respectively. Position and coverage of the Illumina-assembled genome sequences mapped onto the FANhybrid_r1.2 sequence (left), and frequency of the top-hit sequences from the five wild Fragaria species against FANhybrid_r1.2 (right). The central black and white bars indicate the genome sequences of FANhybrid_r1.2 aligned based on the homologous sequence positions on F. vesca (v1.1) Chr1. Details are described in Supplementary Figs S3 and S4.Position and coverage of the Illumina-assembled genome sequences mapped onto the FANhybrid_r1.2 sequence (left), and frequency of the top-hit sequences from the five wild Fragaria species against FANhybrid_r1.2 (right). The central black and white bars indicate the genome sequences of FANhybrid_r1.2 aligned based on the homologous sequence positions on F. vesca (v1.1) Chr1. Details are described in Supplementary Figs S3 and S4.3.10. Comparative analysis between the genes in F. vesca and the assembled sequences in the Fragaria speciesTo investigate the degree of gene duplication in each assembled genome, BLAT searches were performed for the six assembled genome sequences against the 34 809 candidate genes identified on the F. vesca genome.15 The numbers of BLAT hit sequences in FANhybrid_r1.2, FAN_r1.1, FII_r1.1, FNI_r1.1, FNU_r1.1, and FOR_r1.1 were 27 718 (79.6% of the 34 809 candidate genes), 32 120 (92.3%), 27 560 (79.2%), 29 323 (84.2%), 31 869 (91.6%), and 31 901 (91.6%), respectively. Single hits were the most frequently observed in all the assembled genome sequences except FAN_r1.1 (Supplementary Fig. S6a). The distribution of FAN_r1.1 differed from those of the other assembled genome sequences; the peak in frequency was quite broad, and triple hits were the most frequently observed. Of the four wild species, the F. orientalis (FOR_r1.1) genome showed broader peaks than the others, whereas sharper peaks were observed in the F. iinumae genome (FII_r1.1). Cluster analysis was performed on the gene sequences predicted as ‘intrinsic gene’ and ‘intrinsic gene/partial’ (Supplementary Table S13) in the Illumina-assembled genome sequences of F.x ananassa and the diploids (Supplementary Fig. S7) against 34 809 F. vesca candidate genes. The numbers of gene sequences that did not cluster in any other species were 24 596 (14.2% of the total sequences) in FAN_r1.1; 3989 (6.7%) in FII_r1.1; 6351 (8.8%) in FNI_r1.1; 3399 (4.8%) in FNU_r1.1; and 1492 (4.6%) in F. vesca. The BLAT search results were further investigated for 104 genes that were annotated as agriculturally important traits in a previous study15 (Supplementary Table S19). The numbers of genes that had no hits to any of the assembled genomes were as follows: 17 (FANhybrid_r1.2), 10 (FII_r1.1), 3 (FNI_r1.1), 7 (FNU_r1.1), and 6 (FOR_r1.1). All the F. vesca genes showed hits to the FAN_r1.1 sequences. The distributions of the hit sequences were similar to the BLAT search results against the 34 809 genes, except the highest numbers of hit sequences in FNI_r1.1, and FOR_r1.1 were 2 (Supplementary Fig. S6b).4. DiscussionThe phylogenetic analysis with 632 markers revealed that F. vesca was the most closely related diploid species to F.x ananassa. The constructed phylogenetic tree suggested that F. vesca and F. nubicola were genetically closer to F.x ananassa than F. iinumae and F. nipponica. A comparison of the genetic distances between all pairs of the three diploids, F. iinumae, F. nipponica, and F. nubicola, indicated that F. iinumae and F. nipponica were more closely related than the other pairs. This result diverged from that of a previous report,10,14 which distinguished the genome of F. iinumae from those of F. nipponica and F. nubicola. It is considered that differences in investigated regions and scales may be responsible for the inconsistency to the previous studies. We concluded that the four wild species, F. iinumae, F. nipponica, F. nubicola, and F. orientalis, were good representatives of the genetic diversity in the genus Fragaria and were subjected to further genome sequencing analysis.The genome size of F.x ananassa was estimated as 692 Mb, based on the multiplicity of distinct k-mers in the Illumina reads. Despite the similarity in size to that determined in previous studies (708–720 Mb),2,3 it was less than 4-fold the size of the F. vesca genome (209.8 Mb).13 Similarly, the genome size of F. orientalis (349.3 Mb) was less than 2-fold the size of the F. vesca genome. Therefore, we suspected that the genome sizes of F.x ananassa and F. orientalis were underestimated. The estimated genome size of the three diploids, F. iinumae, F. nipponica, and F. nubiclola, was similar to that of F. vesca, and we therefore concluded that the estimated values were close to the true values. Most of the species, except F. orientalis, showed two peaks in the distribution of the number of distinct k-mers, and the distinct peaks detected on larger multiplicity were employed for the genome size estimation. Because not all the sequenced materials were from homozygous lines, the peaks identified on smaller multiplicity were assumed to stem from heterozygous sequences. The peaks employed for genome size estimations in F.x ananassa and F. orientalis were quite broad. The broad shape of the peaks may have resulted from the homoeologous nature of the sequences, and this could also have led to the underestimation of the genome sizes.The largest obstacle to genome sequence assembly of octoploid F.x ananassa was the homoeology of the subgenomes. In addition, outcrossing behaviour of F.x ananassa generates allelic heterozygosity within pairs of homoeologous genomes. Since up to eight heterozygous sequences exist in the F.x ananassa genome, it was predicted that this heterozygosity would create difficulty in assembling chromosome-specific sequences. Therefore, we tried to construct a virtual reference genome that could integrate genome sequences of homoeologous or heterozygous chromosomes by eliminating heterozygous bases. A number of assembling programmes were developed for the assembly of sequences generated by the NGS platforms. The base strategies were mainly classified into two methods: the overlap graph method and the de Bruijn graph method.48,49 The overlap graph method lays out a consensus paradigm based on overlapping sequences, whereas the de Bruijn graph method segments sequence reads into k-mers, and then assembles k-mers based on paths represented on the graphed reads. Because the overlap graph method assumes similarities between the reads in sequence assembly, it is able to eliminate heterozygous bases. The Newbler 2.7 and SOAPdenovo v1.05 are typical assemblers employing the overlap graph method and the de Bruijn graph method, respectively. Therefore, Newbler 2.7 was used for the assembly of the reference genome sequences, whereas SOAPdenovo v1.05 was used for the assembly of the sequence that maintained heterozygosity. The total length of the assembled genome, FANhybrid_r1.2, was 173.2 Mb, which was shorter than that of F. vesca. The N50 of the 454 scaffolds was 46 803 bp, whereas that of the Illumina scaffolds and contigs was 411 bp. Therefore, FANhybrid_r1.2 consisted of long 454 scaffolds and short Illumina sequences.The total length of all Illumina-assembled genome sequences in F.x ananassa was 1264.3 Mb, which was ~2-fold the genome size estimated by the Jellyfish program, and more than 6-fold the genome size of F. vesca. The N50 was quite short, 406 bp. The long total length and short N50 suggested that assembly of the Illumina reads was obstructed by large numbers of heterozygous sequences. Hence, contigs shorter than 300 bp were excluded from further analysis. As a result, the total length of FAN_r1.1 was reduced to 697.8 Mb, which was close to the length estimated by Jellyfish. The result of the similarity search against the candidate genes in F. vesca (Supplementary Fig. S6) indicated that high heterozygosity was maintained in FAN_r1.1 sequences. As with FAN_r1.1, the total lengths of Illumina-assembled genome sequences in the three diploids were similar to the genome size estimated by Jellyfish. However, the total length of F. orientalis (FOR_r1.1) was 214.2 Mb, which was ~61% of the genome size as estimated by Jellyfish. This result indicated a possibility of over-exclusion of sequences caused by the removal of sequences <300 bp in length.The total lengths of repeat sequences in the four wild Illumina-assembled genome sequences were close to that of F. vesca, whereas the FAN_r1.1 sequence was ~6.4 times that of F. vesca (Supplementary Table S8). This result implied that the total length of repeat sequences in FAN_r1.1 was overestimated due to the high heterozygosity in the sequences. In contrast, the total length of the repeat sequences in FANhybrid_r1.2 was quite short, 0.17 that of F. vesca. We considered that excessive integration had occurred as a result of the elimination of heterozygous bases through the use of the heterozygotic mode in Newbler 2.7. Similar patterns were observed in the numbers of tRNAs (Supplementary Table S10) and the length and numbers of candidate genes predicted by Augustus 2.7 (Supplementary Table S12). The frequency of SSRs ranged from 12.7 (FANhybrid_r1.2) to 16.8 (FNI_r1.1) per 100 kb across the five assembled genome sequences. This agreement in observed SSR frequency suggested that SSR identification was not affected by the heterozygosity in the assembled genome sequences. An SSR frequency in intron regions was 2- to 3-fold that in exon regions. Liu et al.50 reported loss of rDNA site numbers in octoploids by fluorescence in situ hybridization using 5S and 25S rDNA probes. However, we found no clear evidence of structural changes in the genomes during the evolutionary transition from diploids to octoploids based on the features of the assembled genome sequences.The BLAST analysis between the whole assembled genome sequences (Supplementary Table S16) showed that sequences in FAN_r1.1 covered larger regions in the F. x ananassa genome than those in FANhybrid_r1.2. The total length of non-homologous sequences was only 281 769 bp in FAN_r1.1 against FANhybrid_r1.2, whereas it was 1.4 Mb in FANhybrid_r1.2 against FAN_r1.1. The ratio of non-homologous sequence to total sequence did not exceed 3% in comparisons between any two pairs of assembled sequences. It was predicted that the percentages of non-homologous sequence between the four subgenomes in F.x ananassa (A, A', B, and B') would reflect those between the ancestral species. Therefore, we estimated that the percentage of non-homologous sequence between the four subgenomes did not exceed 3%.Based on the results of the BLAT analysis, 57% of the sequences in FANhybrid_r1.2 aligned with F. vesca pseudomolecules, while the other 43% of the sequences did not. The large number of non-aligning sequences in the BLAT analysis may be related to the strict thresholds used (i.e. the total length of the subject sequence must show significant similarity over 80–120% of the length of the query sequence). In the Illumina-assembled genomes, multiple sequences were often mapped onto the same FANhybrid_r1.2 sequences, and this might reflect the heterozygosity of the corresponding regions. This multiple mapping was observed across the genome sequence, and we concluded that the heterozygosity was randomly distributed in F. x ananassa and the four wild species sequenced in this study. In comparisons of the numbers of top-hit sequences of the five wild species, slight difference was observed between the results of BLAT analysis against FANhybrid_r1.2 and BLASTN search against FAN_r1.1. In the result of BLAT analysis, F. vesca showed the highest numbers of the top-hit sequences (Supplementary Fig. S5), while nearly equal ratio was observed in F. iinumae (39.1%) and F. vesca (34.8%) in the BLASTN search (Supplementary Table S18). We considered that the result of BLASTN search was more accurate, because the result of BLAT analysis was affected by the length of assembled sequences in the subject (wild species) sequences. The result of BLASTN search suggested that the genomes of F. vesca and F. iinumae equally contributed as progenitors of F. x ananassa, and agreed with previous studies.3,10,14 On the other hand, 14.2% of the FAN_r1.1 intrinsic genes were predicted as unique genes in F. x ananassa. These results suggested that the genome of F. x ananassa has diverged from the other Fragaria species during the process of evolution.In this study, we dissected the octoploid F. x ananassa genome through comparisons between reference and heterozygous genome sequences in F. x ananassa and sequencing analysis of the genomes of wild Fragaria relatives. To our knowledge, this is the first genomic analysis of a polyploid species, and we expect that this approach will be applied to the genomic analysis of other polyploid species. On the other hand, one remarkable issue remained; that is, the distinction between homoeologous and allelic heterozygous sequences. The small percentages of non-homologous sequence across the assembled genomes suggested that most of the genes in F. x ananassa have homoeologous sequences in the genome. To distinguish subgenome-specific sequences, we considered that introducing segregation analysis into the genome sequence assembly would provide a more effective approach. Therefore, S1 progenies of ‘Reikou’ were subjected to further analysis. The results obtained should contribute to progress in the genomic and genetic analyses of the octopolyploid species, F. x ananassa.5.

Despite their perceived importance, omics-level studies have seldom been applied to this group of animals largely due to a paucity of genomic resources.

IntroductionMollusca is the second most speciose animal phylum, containing more than 1 00 000 extant species distributed across eight major lineages.1 Molluscs play vital roles in the structure and functioning of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Many molluscs are important fishery and aquaculture species, and some also serve as models for studying neurobiology, biomineralization, and adaptive evolution in response to climate change.2,3 Despite their perceived importance, systematic studies of molluscan biology and evolution remain very limited largely due to a paucity of genomic resources.Recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies (e.g. Roche's 454 and Illumina's Solexa) now allow for rapid generation of extensive genomic resources at affordable cost for any organism, thus opening up opportunities for conducting omics-level analyses in molluscs. NGS-based genome sequencing has recently been performed for two bivalve molluscs, i.e. Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas)4 and pearl oyster (Pinctada fucata),5 providing the first insights into molluscan genome architecture and the genetic basis of stress adaptation, shell formation, and pearl biosynthesis. However, whole-genome de novo sequencing is currently still costly even using NGS platforms and remains out of reach for most laboratories focusing on non-model organisms. As an attractive alternative, transcriptome sequencing represents a cost-effective approach to rapidly expand gene resources, and it has been widely applied in many non-model organisms.6 The extensive gene resources generated by transcriptome sequencing are very useful not only for transcriptome-wide gene characterization and expression profiling, but also for large-scale single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) discovery. Such ‘functional’ SNPs are particularly valuable for quantitative genetic and evolutionary studies, because they have a great potential for quickly identifying causal genes responsible for either complex traits or adaptive evolution.Genome-wide scans for detecting quantitative trait loci (QTL) for traits of interest or genetic determinants for local adaptation usually require a large number of genetic markers. SNPs have attracted significant attention, as they represent the most abundant class of genetic variations in eukaryotic genomes and have already become the marker of choice in large-scale genotyping applications, such as high-resolution linkage and association mapping, genomic selection, and comparative genome analysis. However, SNP markers have been insufficiently developed for molluscs in comparison with well-studied model organisms, such as mouse, nematode worm, and zebrafish. Even for the molluscs that are well characterized at the molecular level (e.g. Pacific oyster), only hundreds of markers are available. Transcriptome sequencing has recently been conducted in many molluscs,7–11 providing extensive resources for large-scale gene-associated SNP mining. High-throughput SNP screening and marker development rely on an efficient genotyping platform. High resolution melting (HRM) has proved to be an extremely powerful technique for rapid profiling of genetic variation within PCR amplicons.12,13 HRM has several advantages over other genotyping methods, such as its simplicity, low cost, high sensitivity, and specificity, and has been widely applied to many non-model species for marker development at medium-to-large scale.14,15Our group has recently released a large amount of transcriptome data via 454 sequencing for a bivalve mollusc, Chlamys farreri (Jones et Preston 1904).16Chlamys farreri is naturally distributed along the seacoasts of China, Japan, and Korea and is also an important aquaculture species in China. To date, <100 SNP markers have been developed for this species,17,18 which is not sufficient for large-scale genomic analyses, such as high-resolution linkage and QTL mapping, association mapping, and comparative genome analysis. Here, we conducted the first large-scale gene-associated SNP marker development for C. farreri. The 1492 SNP markers developed in this study were further evaluated for their usefulness in population genomic, comparative genomic, and association analyses.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Transcriptome sequences, assembly, and SNP miningThe C. farreri transcriptome sequences (SRA accession no. SRA030509) were produced by 454 sequencing of cDNA libraries prepared from diverse developmental stages and adult tissues. The details of sample collection, library preparation, and 454 sequencing have been described in a previous study.16 Briefly, for larval samples, approximately 1000 parents were used for artificial fertilization, while adult tissues were collected from 30 individuals. To reduce the risk of identifying artificial SNPs arising from sequencing errors or misassembly of paralogous sequences, 454 reads were reassembled using the CAP3 programme19 under very stringent assembly criteria (overlap setting: 100 bp and 95% similarity). Using the QualitySNP programme,20 putative SNPs were identified in the assembled contigs that were covered by at least four reads and had at least two reads for each allele.2.2. SNP marker development based on the HRM genotyping platformSNP markers were developed using a cost-effective HRM method14 that used two PCR primers and one unlabelled probe. SNP markers were named as follows: C followed by a contig ID, and then S followed by the SNP position (bp) within the contig. HRM primers and probes were designed following the rules described by Wang et al.14 Primers and probes were synthesized (Sangon Biotech) and evaluated using six C. farreri individuals. PCR amplifications were performed in a 10-µl volume composed of 20 ng genomic DNA, 0.1 µM forward primer, 0.5 µM reverse primer, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM dNTPs (Invitrogen), 1× LCGreen Plus (Idaho Technology), 1× PCR buffer, and 0.5 U Taq DNA polymerase (TaKaRa). Thermal cycling began with an initial denaturing step at 95°C for 5 min, followed by 60 cycles of 95°C for 40 s, 63°C for 40 s, and 72°C for 40 s with a final extension at 72°C for 5 min. The corresponding probe was added to each PCR to a final concentration of 3 µM, and the reaction mixture was denatured at 95°C for 10 min and then slowly cooled to 4°C. HRM genotyping was performed on a Light-Scanner instrument (Idaho Technology) with continuous melting curve acquisition (10 acquisitions per °C) during a 0.1°C/s ramp from 40 to 95°C. All primer and probe sequences of the developed SNP markers are provided in Supplementary Table S1.2.3. Population genetic analysisThe developed SNP markers were evaluated using four wild, geographical populations. In total, 54 C. farreri individuals were used for this evaluation, of which 24 were collected from the Jiaonan (JN) population, 12 from the Changdao (CD) population, 12 from the Rongcheng (RC) population, and 6 from the Dalian (DL) population. The collection details of these samples were described in a previous study.21 Marker polymorphisms were evaluated within and among populations. For each marker, allele frequency, observed heterozygosity (Ho), and expected heterozygosity (He), along with tests for neutrality, Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, and linkage disequilibrium, were calculated using POPGENE22 or GENEPOP 4.0 program.23 For Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium and linkage disequilibrium tests, Bonferroni correction was also applied to account for multiple testing.2.4. Test for cross-species transferabilityIn total, 34 markers targeting 24 synonymous and 10 non-synonymous SNPs were selected for evaluating cross-species transferability in five scallop species from three Pectinidae subfamilies, i.e. Chlamydinae (Chlamys nobilis and Patinopecten yessoensis), Pectininae (Amusium pleuronectes), and Aequipectini (Argopecten irradians and Argopecten purpuratus). All species except A. purpuratus were purchased from local markets in China. Argopecten purpuratus samples were kindly provided by Dr Chunde Wang (Qingdao Agriculture University, China). For each species, eight individuals were used to evaluate polymorphisms.2.5. Marker annotation and gene comparison with Pacific oysterTo provide functional annotations for the SNP markers, relevant contig sequences were compared against the Swiss-Prot and Nr protein databases using BlastX, with an e-value threshold of 1e-5. Gene names were assigned to each marker based on the best hit. The BlastX results were imported into the Blast2GO software24 for gene ontology (GO) analysis. GO terms were assigned to query sequences based on three ontology classifications, i.e. biological process, molecular function, and cellular component. To gain an overview of gene pathways, KEGG analysis was also performed using the KEGG Automatic Annotation Server.25 The bi-directional best hit method was used to obtain KEGG orthology assignments. The contig sequences containing the SNP markers were also compared against the oyster protein database using BlastX, with an e-value threshold of 1e-4.2.6. Large-scale marker associations with growth traitsLarge-scale marker associations with growth traits were conducted on an elite variety of C. farreri named the ‘Penglai-Red’ scallop (Aquacultural Variety Registration Number of the Ministry of Agriculture of China: GS02-001-2005), which was developed by our group and has been under continuous artificial selection for red shell colour and fast growth for multiple generations. A large breeding population was established in May 2010 by artificial fertilization of more than 3000 sexually mature ‘Penglai-Red’ scallops at the hatchery of the Xunshan Aquatic Group Corporation (Shandong Province, China). After rearing for 2 months, half the juvenile scallops were moved to another hatchery that is ~250 km from the original hatchery. In May 2012, approximately 1000 2-year-old scallops were randomly sampled from each hatchery, constituting two target populations for the association analyses in this study. To reduce the genotyping cost, a selective genotyping strategy was adopted. For each population, 40 individuals with large body sizes and 40 ones with small body sizes were chosen for genotyping with the 1492 SNP markers. For an initial scan of the whole marker set, a DNA pool was established for each group by mixing equal amount of genomic DNA prepared from individuals within each group. The resultant DNA pools were subject to HRM analysis to search for allele frequency differences between groups. Markers showing large between-group differences in allele frequencies were subject to further validation by genotyping all individuals in both groups; statistical significance was determined using a <U+03C7>2 test.3. Results3.1. Transcriptome assembly and SNP miningIn total, 1 099 254 clean reads were used for transcriptome assembly. The final assembly consisted of 50 741 contigs and 406 825 singletons. Contig sizes ranged from 60 to 6063 bp, with an average of 541 bp. The average read and sequencing depth coverage across all contigs were 13.6 and 7.5, respectively. The relatively low sequencing depth limits our ability to detect less common or rare SNPs; nevertheless, this transcriptomic resource enabled us to identify a large number of candidate SNPs for marker development. A total of 21 813 putative SNPs were identified from 18 780 contigs. The distribution of SNP coverage is shown in Fig. 1. The overall SNP frequency was one SNP per 1258 bp. Of these SNPs, 14 641(67%) were transitions, whereas 7172 (33%) were transversions. A total of 7338 SNPs were identified from contigs for which gene annotation information was available.

Marker development based on the HRM genotyping platformThe entire marker development and evaluation procedure are depicted in Fig. 2. All putative SNPs were evaluated for HRM primer and probe design, which led to a successful set of primers and probes for 4500 SNPs with a wide range of minor allele frequencies (MAFs; Table 1). All primers and probes were synthesized and evaluated using six C. farreri individuals. A total of 3042 primer pairs produced strong single bands with expected sizes. Although the expected amplicon length was restricted to ~100 bp during primer design, 616 primer pairs still produced bands larger than the expected sizes, indicating potential introns in the vicinity of those SNPs. Longer amplicons can greatly diminish the sensitivity of HRM analysis, so these SNPs were excluded from further consideration. Two hundred and forty-seven primer pairs produced more than one band possibly due to non-specific amplifications. The remaining primer pairs resulted in poor amplifications, i.e. very weak or no PCR product, and were excluded from further consideration. Probe testing was subsequently performed for primer pairs with successful amplifications. In total, 2231 probes generated well-recognizable melting curve profiles with a distinct peak for each allele. Of these, 1492 loci were polymorphic across all assayed individuals, whereas 739 loci were monomorphic possibly due to the small number of assayed individuals. The SNP validation rate was correlated with the MAF in the initial discovery panel. A higher MAF tended to lead to a higher validation rate (Table 1). For example, at the MAF interval of 0.4–0.5, 75% of markers were polymorphic. In contrast, only 42% were polymorphic at the MAF interval of 0–0.1, and the low validation rate may be largely attribute to the relatively low quality of predicted SNPs (i.e. SNPs that were difficult to distinguish from sequencing errors). Information pertaining to all 1492 SNP loci has been submitted to the dbSNP database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/) under accession numbers rs831881546–rs831883035 and rs831883061–rs831883062.

Evaluation of SNP markers for population genomic analysisThe suitability of the 1492 polymorphic markers for population genomic analysis was evaluated using four geographical populations. PCR success rates across all individuals ranged from 48 to 100% with an average of 93%, suggesting that null alleles are indeed present at very low frequencies in these populations as expected for gene-derived markers. All the markers showed polymorphisms across the four populations and within each population. Marker polymorphism was 100% for the JN population, 96% for the CD population, 97% for the RC population, and 88% for the DL population. Population genetic parameters were estimated for the JN population (Supplementary Table S1), because this population had a relatively large sample size compared with the other populations, and therefore, genetic parameters could be estimated more reliably. For all markers, MAF ranged from 0.02 to 0.50. The Ho and He were 0.34 and 0.37, respectively; these values are relatively low compared with the previous estimates for the same population using microsatellite markers.21 In total, 1422 markers passed the neutrality test, suggesting that these markers are not under strong selection and are suitable for population genomic analyses that usually require neutral markers. The majority of markers were in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, and only 81 markers showed significant departures after Bonferroni correction. Significant linkage disequilibrium was detected in 102 marker pairs. These markers are valuable for detecting recent admixture and migration events in natural populations.263.4. Cross-species transferability testTo assess the cross-species transferability of the developed SNP markers, 34 markers targeting 24 synonymous and 10 non-synonymous SNPs were selected for HRM genotyping in five scallop species deriving from three Pectinidae subfamilies. A total of 23 were successfully amplified in at least one species, of which 16 were polymorphic in at least one species. The highest transferability (up to four species) was observed for marker C10745S115_CG (Table 2). Unexpectedly, the total number of transferable markers was quite similar (6–7 markers) for the three Pectinidae subfamilies, which does not reflect the difference in their phylogenetic relationships to C. farreri (i.e. C. farreri belongs to Chlamydinae, which is more closely related to Pectininae than to Aequipectini27). The markers that could be transferred to at least three species were all synonymous SNPs; while all but one of the non-synonymous SNPs were transferable only to a single species.

Functional annotation and gene comparison with Pacific oysterGene annotation was performed for the 1492 markers using BlastX comparison against the Swiss-Prot and Nr protein databases. A total of 1095 (73.4%) markers had significant matches to known proteins in these databases, corresponding to 953 unique accessions (Supplementary Table S1). GO analysis revealed that one or more GO terms could be assigned to 466 markers for a total of 923 GO assignments. The annotated markers were involved in diverse biological processes and functions, and their GO composition largely resembled that summarized for the total set of contigs (Supplementary Fig. S1). KEGG pathway analysis revealed that 420 markers were involved in 123 different pathways (Supplementary Table S2). In particular, 21 markers were involved in the immune system, and these markers are worthy of further evaluation to determine whether any are associated with disease/pathogen resistance.To evaluate the utility of the 1492 SNP markers for future comparative analysis with the oyster genome, the contig sequences of these markers were compared against the oyster protein database. A total of 963 C. farreri contigs containing 1034 SNP markers showed significant sequence homology to oyster proteins (e-value of < 1e-4; Supplementary Table S1). One example showing the correspondence between eight SNP markers and oyster scaffold419 is presented in Fig. 3. These oyster proteins are distributed on 514 genomic scaffolds (genome assembly v9; Table 3). The lengths of these scaffolds ranged from 2 to 1965 kb. A total of 235 scaffolds were matched by at least two C. farreri markers, and 39 scaffolds were matched by at least five markers (Table 3). These markers and matching related oyster scaffolds provide an important basis for further genome comparison between the two species.

Large-scale marker associations with growth traitsBased on the developed marker set, we further conducted a large-scale association analysis of growth traits using two C. farreri populations that were derived from a large breeding population of an elite C. farreri variety (‘Penglai-Red’ scallop), but were reared in two different geographic locations. Two populations were used in the association analysis to ensure identification of SNP loci linked with the genetic variance of traits but not the environmental effects. To reduce the genotyping cost, a selective genotyping approach was adopted, in which only two groups of individuals sampled from the two tails of the trait distribution were used for HRM analysis (Fig. 4). An initial scan of the whole marker set on DNA pools revealed that five markers showed prominent allele frequency difference between the two groups in both populations (Fig. 5). Statistical significance of the observed allele frequency difference was further confirmed for the five markers by genotyping each individual within each group for both populations (Table 4). After Bonferroni correction, four markers remained significant in at least one population. Gene annotation information was available for only one marker, C7493S233_CT (SDF4, 45 kDa calcium-binding protein, 7e-19).

Large-scale marker development from NGS-generated transcriptomic resourcesNGS technologies are now frequently being used to generate extensive genomic resources for non-model organisms. Although a large number of SNPs can be readily discovered from these resources, large-scale marker development and evaluation are seldom performed for such in silico predicted SNPs. In this study, we conducted the first transcriptome-wide marker development from more than 21,000 putative SNPs for a bivalve mollusc, which currently represents the largest gene-associated marker collection for the phylum Mollusca. Although stringent criteria were adopted for transcriptome assembly, the marker conversion rate remained relatively low (~33%), but was still comparable with those reported in recent studies using the same genotyping platform.14–16 The inefficient marker conversion can largely be attributed to low passing rates in the primer and probe tests, i.e. 32.4% failed the primer test and 18% failed the probe test. This issue may be directly related to a few well-known drawbacks of NGS platforms. For example, NGS platforms usually generate a substantial higher rate of sequencing errors than traditional Sanger-based methods. In particular, the 454 sequencing platform is prone to introducing higher indel errors than other platforms, especially when stretches of homopolymeric bases are present.28–30 Sequencing errors, when occurring at positions where a primer or probe binds, may hamper the amplification efficiency and confound subsequent HRM analysis. In addition, sequencing errors are also a major source of falsely predicted SNPs. As revealed by this study, there is a trend for SNPs with higher MAF to have higher validation rates. This result suggests that SNPs with high MAF (e.g. 40–50%) are less likely to be affected by sequencing errors and thus, should be given high priority during marker development. Furthermore, NGS platforms usually produce very short reads (e.g. 35–100 bp); accurate de novo assembly of such short reads poses a significant informatics challenge.31 Assembly artefacts can arise when reads of different genomic origins are misassembled together due to high similarity of sequence context. Such artefacts may result in PCR failure when primers are targeting two genomic regions far from each other. One interesting finding is that introns were present at a substantially high frequency, even though we restricted the expected amplicon length to ~100 bp during primer design. Approximately 14% of primer pairs produced amplicons with a larger than expected size, indicating that introns were present in the vicinity of SNPs. It should be noted that this percentage most likely underestimates the actual occurrence of introns, because very large introns would more likely result in PCR failure rather than successful amplicons of larger than expected size. The aforementioned issues cannot be easily amended without the aid of a high-quality reference genome. However, with the rapid development of sequencing technologies (i.e. much longer reads and higher accuracy) and more draft genomes being generated for non-model species, there is much hope that these issues can be resolved.4.2. Genic versus non-genic markers in molluscan population studiesCurrently, the genetic markers available for molluscs were developed predominantly from anonymous genomic sequences. It is well known that molluscan genomes are typically highly heterozygous.4,5 For example, the Pacific oyster has an average SNP density of one SNP per 60 bp in coding regions and one per 40 bp in non-coding regions.32 Such high genome heterozygosity can result in a high frequency of null alleles, i.e. alleles fail to amplify due to random mutations in primer-binding regions. Extremely high proportions of null alleles have been observed for the microsatellite markers developed in C. farreri (56%).33 Application of these markers in population genetic studies can severely distort the estimation of population structure and differentiation, parentage analysis, and assignment tests,34 and may result in misleading conclusions or inferences. In contrast, genetic markers developed from transcriptomic sequences can, to some extent, alleviate this problem, because transcribed regions are usually more conserved than non-transcribed regions. In this study, the average PCR success rate across all assayed individuals was 93%, suggesting that null alleles were indeed present at very low frequencies, as expected for gene-derived markers.Remarkably, high population transferability was observed for the developed SNP markers, and the vast majority of which were also neutral markers. Our study, therefore, provides a valuable set of SNP markers that are suitable for population genomic studies. A major benefit of utilizing gene-associated markers is that it is possible to quickly identifying causal genes under natural selection, which usually involves identifying outlier SNP markers showing significantly increased or decreased differentiation among populations compared with neutral expectations.35 Scaling up the number of available gene-associated SNPs to thousands of markers extends the genome coverage, thereby increasing the probability of identifying outlier loci that are in tight linkage disequilibrium with loci under selection.4.3. Cross-species transferability and comparative genomicsGene-associated markers generally exhibit higher cross-species transferability in closely related species than markers developed from anonymous genomic sequences. However, to what extent SNP markers developed from one species are transferable to others within the Pectinidae family remains unknown. In this study, about half of the tested markers were polymorphic in at least one of the five scallop species, with the most polymorphic marker transferable to up to four species, indicating the high cross-species transferability of the developed SNP markers. However, marker transferability across the three Pectinidae subfamilies showed no correlation with their phylogenetic relationships to C. farreri. This is somewhat unexpected, suggesting that these transferable SNPs may largely represent ancestral genetic variations that have been preserved differentially among Pectinidae subfamilies. Our study also revealed that SNPs with high transferability (=3 species) were all synonymous SNPs. This makes sense because synonymous SNPs do not alter the encoded amino acids and thus, are less likely to be removed by purifying selection. Once a polymorphism had arisen, it would be preserved for a long period of time during the evolution of the Pectinidae family.The high cross-species transferability together with the high annotation rate (~73%) of the developed markers hold great promise for conducting comparative genome analysis among molluscs. The recently released Pacific oyster genome represents the best assembled genome currently available for bivalve molluscs.4 It provides a valuable genomic resource not only for oyster genetic and breeding studies, but also for comparative genome analysis among molluscs. One of our ongoing projects is to construct a high-density linkage map for C. farreri based on the markers developed here. In the present study, we made an initial assessment of the usefulness of the developed markers (if they were included in a future linkage map) for comparative genome analysis between the two bivalve species. Of the annotated markers, 69% could be anchored onto the Pacific oyster genome, and 250 markers could be linked to very large oyster scaffolds that are longer than 500 kb and matched by at least five markers. Therefore, once the high-density map is constructed, these markers would help identify conserved genomic regions (i.e. synteny blocks) between the two species.4.4. Large-scale marker association analysis of growth traitsIdentification of major genes responsible for growth traits is highly desirable in scallop breeding programmes for the purpose of genetic improvement. Gene-associated markers are valuable tools for fulfilling such task, because they have great potential for quickly identifying causal genes underlying the trait of interest. The extensive marker set generated by this study provides an unprecedented opportunity to conduct a large-scale association analysis of growth traits in C. farreri. Using a selective genotyping approach, five growth-related markers were identified and confirmed in two C. farreri populations, where allele frequencies were associated with variation in growth trait. Unfortunately, four of these markers are currently uncharacterized, and therefore, their putative roles in growth regulation cannot be inferred. The marker C7493S233_CT was the only marker with annotation information (SDF4, 45 kDa calcium-binding protein). This gene belongs to the calcium-binding protein family, a large group of proteins that can regulate a variety of cellular processes including cell division, differentiation, motility, and apoptosis.36 Mutations in calcium-binding proteins have been associated with variation in growth traits, as demonstrated in Chinese cattle.37 Currently, it is largely unknown which genes or genetic loci are involved in scallop growth regulation. Our study offers the first report of candidate genes responsible for scallop growth regulation and provides markers for further genetic improvement of C. farreri in breeding programmes.4.5. ConclusionsWe developed for the first time large-scale gene-associated SNP markers for a bivalve mollusc, which currently represents the largest gene-associated marker collection in the phylum Mollusca. The properties of high polymorphism within and across populations, low frequency of null alleles, neutrality, and high cross-species transferability make these markers highly valuable for population genomic, comparative genomic, and genome-wide association studies.Supplementary DataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was financially supported and provided by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31130054), National Basic Research Program of China (2010CB126406), National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (2012AA10A401, 2012AA10A402, and 2012AA10A405) and Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars of Shandong Province (JQ201308).We are very grateful to Xunshan Aquatic Group Corporation (Shandong Province, China) for the help in maintaining and sampling scallop materials.Supplementary data"

The highest-induced genes are in the same operon and code for two sHSP. Only one of the five groEL genes in MAFF303099 genome was induced by heat shock. Unlike other prokaryotes, the transcriptional response of this Mesorhizobium included the underexpression of an unusually large number of genes (72% of the differentially expressed genes). This extensive downregulation of gene expression may be an important part of the heat shock response, as a way of reducing energetic costs under stress. To our knowledge, this study reports the heat shock response of the largest prokaryote genome analysed so far, representing an important contribution to understand the response of plant-interacting bacteria to challenging environmental conditions.","Rhizobia, the bacterial legume symbionts able to fix atmospheric nitrogen inside root nodules, have to survive in varied environmental conditions.

To our knowledge, this study reports the heat shock response of the largest prokaryote genome analysed so far, representing an important contribution to understand the response of plant-interacting bacteria to challenging environmental conditions.1. IntroductionRhizobia are soil bacteria able to colonize legume roots and form nodules, where atmospheric nitrogen is metabolized into compounds that can be used by the plant. The impact of the biological nitrogen fixation carried out by rhizobia in agriculture is both economic and environmental. Rhizobia may reduce the use of chemical N-fertilizers, which represent a production cost reduction and at the same time a decrease in the pollution resulting from N-fertilizers synthesis and from soil nitrate lixiviation.1Rhizobia typically have large genomes, which are often composed by several replicons. These seem to be common features of bacterial species that interact with a host.2 This rhizobial trend to harbour a large accessory genome is probably related, not only to the symbiosis itself (interacting with a host), but also to the plasticity required to survive in complex and distinct environments. As free-living bacteria, rhizobia have to cope with changes in soil conditions and as plant-symbionts, rhizobia must overcome plant defence mechanisms and adapt to the intracellular nodule environment. For all the above reasons, these bacteria are particularly interesting to study stress response. The most important consequences of heat stress at the cellular level are protein denaturation and aggregation.3 These effects are common to other adverse conditions, as for example oxidative stress, so the study of the heat stress response is also relevant in understanding tolerance to other stresses.The plasticity to respond to stressful conditions involves rapid changes in gene expression. Alternative sigma factors allow bacteria to rapidly redirect the RNA polymerases pool to the set of genes that are required to respond to a certain condition.4 Rhizobia genomes typically harbour a large number of alternative sigma factors, including multiple copies of rpoH, which encodes s32, the major sigma factor involved in the heat shock response.5 s32 might be involved in response to other stresses as seen in Rhizobium etli, where rpoH2 seems to be more related to oxidative stress response.6 Furthermore, rhizobia with rpoH deletions may also be affected in their symbiotic phenotype.6,7 The transcription of ~21% of the genes induced in response to a temperature upshift are rpoH1 dependent in Sinorhizobium meliloti and these include chaperones, proteases and small heat shock proteins (sHSP).5Important chaperone systems, such as GroES-GroEL and DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE, are s32-regulated in most alphaproteobacteria. Chaperones play a key role in the heat shock response, as they are involved in promoting the acquisition of the native conformation by proteins that suffered denaturation and present the wrong folding.8 The importance of chaperonins in defining tolerance to temperature has been highlighted by several studies in E. coli.9,10 A more recent study showed that a high level of the GroESL system has a fundamental role in the evolution of heat tolerance.11 Some important reports on the functional analysis of the multiple groESL operons in rhizobia have been published.12–14 Mutational studies showed that groESL operons within the same genome are induced by different stimuli and that these genes are involved not only in stress tolerance, but also in the nodulation and nitrogen fixation processes.15 In Mesorhizobium spp., both dnaK and groESL genes were reported to be transcriptionally induced by a temperature upshift, especially in heat tolerant isolates.16 In rhizobia, groESL operons are often CIRCE (controlling inverted repeat of chaperone expression) regulated, as already reported in Bradyrhizobium japonicum, S. meliloti and Rhizobium leguminosarum.13,17,18 CIRCE is a highly conserved DNA sequence that serves as binding site of the repressor protein HrcA.19,20Similar to the GroESL chaperonins, also the DnaKJ system seems to be involved in both heat tolerance and symbiosis phenotype.21–23 Regarding the co-chaperone dnaJ, rhizobia mutants showed that both stress tolerance and symbiotic performance are affected.21,22,24sHSP are mostly involved in preventing the irreversible aggregation of misfolded proteins. The presence of a large number of sHSP is a common feature in rhizobia genomes.25 Some sHSP have a specific regulation designated by repression of heat shock gene expression (ROSE). ROSE element is a posttranscriptional regulation mechanism that consists in a conserved sequence downstream to the promoter.26The heat shock response has been extensively studied in bacteria, however to our knowledge, only one rhizobia strain was studied in terms of heat shock transcriptome, namely S. meliloti 1021, a symbiont of Medicago spp.5,27 The strain analysed in the present report, Mesorhizobium loti MAFF303099, is a rhizobium able to establish nitrogen-fixing symbiosis with Lotus species.28,29M. loti MAFF303099 genome comprises a large chromosome (7 Mb) and two plasmids designated as pMLa (352 kb) and pMLb (208 kb). A chromosomal symbiosis island (610 kb) contains most genes involved in nodulation and nitrogen fixation. A previous study showed that this strain is tolerant to heat shock and cold conditions, and grows well at pH 5.30The aim of the present study is to characterize the transcriptional response to heat shock in a resourceful rhizobium with a large and complex genome. The analysis of the global transcriptional alterations following a sudden exposure to high-temperature conditions in M. loti MAFF303099 will contribute to a better understanding of the general stress response, in particular in symbiotic bacteria with multiple replicons and large accessory genome.2. Materials and methods2.1. RNA purificationOvernight cultures of M. loti MAFF303099 were grown in YMB31 at 28°C, to a final optical density of 0.3 (540 nm). A volume of 10 ml of bacterial culture was used in each treatment: 30 min at control (28°C) and heat shock (48°C) conditions. Cells were harvested and total RNA was purified using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). Contamination with DNA was removed by DNase digestion (Roche), followed by RNA cleanup using RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). Total RNA integrity was checked using the RNA Nano kit and an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyser (Agilent Technologies), while RNA quantification was performed using NanoDrop ND-1000 (NanoDrop Technologies). RNA was prepared from three independent cell cultures.2.2. Microarray experimentsRNA processing as well as microarrays hybridization and raw data extraction were a service provided by Biocant Park—Genomics Unit (Portugal). In order to enrich the RNA samples in mRNA, the MICROBExpress™ Kit (Ambion) was used to remove most of the rRNA. mRNA was then amplified with the MessageAmp™ II-Bacteria Kit (Ambion), with the incorporation of 5-(3-aminoallyl)-UTP (Ambion) for indirect labelling, which was carried out by the coupling of fluorescent Cy3 to the amplified RNA (aRNA), following the instructions of the Amino Allyl MessageAmp™ II aRNA Amplification Kit (Ambion).The 40K array for M. loti MAFF303099 (MYcroarray) includes probes for 7231 genes (~99% of the total number of protein-coding genes) with five replicates for each probe. Slide hybridization was carried out as described by the microarray's supplier, using the Gene Expression Hybridization Kit (Agilent Technologies). Data were acquired using a DNA Microarray B Scanner (Agilent Technologies), with an intensity of 100% PTM in the green channel.2.3. Data analysisThe microarrays data were analysed using BRB ArrayTools (version 4.2).32 The arrays were normalized using the array median and genes that were differentially expressed following heat shock were identified using MeV software.33 Genes were considered differentially expressed for P = 0.01 in the t-test.Despite the recent update on the annotation of the MAFF303099 genome released by NCBI (October 2012), all genes differentially expressed that were annotated as ‘hypothetical protein’ were further analysed using Blast2GO software.34 This analysis included Blast, Mapping and Annotation, and allowed further annotation of many genes. In order to assign the highest number possible of genes to a clusters of orthologous genes (COG) category, STRING 9.0 database (search tool for the retrieval of interacting genes)35 was used.MicrobesOnline Operon Predictions (www.microbesonline.org/operons/) was used for operon prediction.36 The identification of putative promoter sequences was performed using BPROM-Prediction of bacterial promoters software (www.softberry.com). DNAPlotter37 was used to generate circular DNA maps showing transcriptomics data.Spearman's coefficient was used to test for correlation between genome size and number of over- or underexpressed genes (IBM SPSS Statistics, version 21).2.4. Microarray data validationValidation of microarray data was performed by real-time quantitative RT–PCR (qRT–PCR). cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription using Maxima First Strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primers (Supplementary Table S1) were designed using Primer Express 3.0 software (Applied Biosystems). Real-time qRT–PCR reactions were prepared using 0.1 ng/µl of template cDNA, SYBR Green PCR Master Mix and 0.3 mM of each primer. Amplifications were carried out in a 7500 Real-time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). Ct values for the target genes were normalized using the reference genes hisC, rpoA and sigA, which showed no variation in the corresponding transcript levels for the experimental conditions used (data not shown).3. Results and discussion3.1. Global transcriptional responseAnalysis of the M. loti MAFF303099 transcriptome allowed the identification of 2186 protein-coding genes that were differentially expressed after heat shock (out of 7231 genes analysed), with an average false discovery rate of 1.5% (accession number GSE43529). This indicates that the transcript levels of ~30% of the protein-coding genes were altered by this stress. The transcriptional response included a much higher number of downregulated (1584) compared with the upregulated (602) genes (Fig. 1). The unexpected larger proportion of downregulated genes does not seem to be a feature of rhizobia, taking into account the similar numbers of induced and repressed genes reported for S. meliloti.5,27Microarrays analysis of M. loti MAFF303099 subjected to heat shock. M-values for the differentially expressed genes (P < 0.01) obtained from the comparison between heat shock (48°C) and control (28°C) conditions. Genes with increased amount of mRNA following the heat shock have positive M-values (overexpressed), while genes with decreased mRNA levels after heat shock show negative M-values (underexpressed).Microarrays analysis of M. loti MAFF303099 subjected to heat shock. M-values for the differentially expressed genes (P < 0.01) obtained from the comparison between heat shock (48°C) and control (28°C) conditions. Genes with increased amount of mRNA following the heat shock have positive M-values (overexpressed), while genes with decreased mRNA levels after heat shock show negative M-values (underexpressed).To our knowledge, the present study reports the largest prokaryote genome studied so far in terms of response to heat shock. To investigate the influence of genome size in the global heat response, a comparison of the transcriptional response to heat of prokaryotes with different genome sizes was performed (Fig. 2). Strain MAFF303099 shows an unusual proportion of downregulated genes in response to heat shock compared with several other bacteria and archaea that, in general, show a similar number of genes under- and overexpressed following a temperature upshift (though different heat shock conditions are compared). Despite the fact that diverse species with distinct lifestyles and subjected to different heat shock conditions are compared in Fig. 2, analysis of the transcriptomic data suggests a general trend of pronounced increase in the number of downregulated genes with genome size. One might speculate that many expendable genes are shutdown, so that the cellular machinery can be more effective in the synthesis of the specific functional response. Nevertheless, the extensive gene downregulation is not particularly detected in the accessory genome that is presumably more dispensable. Indeed, the symbiosis island shows dispersed under- and overexpressed genes similar to the rest of the chromosome (Fig. 3). Furthermore, some highly induced genes are plasmid encoded, mainly in pMLb (Fig. 4). This is somewhat unexpected since symbiosis islands and plasmids are mobile elements in the genome, known to be laterally transferred within soil populations and thus less expected to carry genes essential for stress survival. In addition, the set of 100 genes with highest M-values comprises 14 plasmid encoded genes, while the 100 highly underexpressed genes are all chromosomal (Supplementary Table S2).

Accordingly, ~40% of the induced genes show a low increase in the transcriptional levels (M < 1). This low level of gene induction, commonly disregarded, may be important part of cells response, as pointed before by Wren and Conway.54Analysis of the location of the differentially expressed genes in each replicon shows an apparently random distribution of over- and underexpressed genes, with the exception of an~200 kb-long region located in 1 000 000–1 200 000 (462 genes) where all the differentially expressed genes are downregulated (Fig. 3). Both in the chromosome and plasmids, distribution of the differentially expressed genes seems to be unrelated to the DNA strand or GC content.Real-time qRT–PCR was used to validate the microarray data. Genes were chosen based on M-values from the microarrays results, in order to include overexpressed, underexpressed and not differentially expressed genes, as well as genes encoded in both DNA strands and scattered in the chromosome. In general, the results from the real-time qRT–PCR experiments are in agreement with the microarrays analysis results (Table 1), with exception of the dnaK gene (discussed in the section ‘The DnaKJ chaperone system’). Microarrays data validation using real-time qRT–PCRnde, not differentially expressed.Microarrays data validation using real-time qRT–PCRnde, not differentially expressed.Protein-coding genes can be grouped into COG, according to their similarity in terms of domain architecture and function.55 The present study showed that temperature stress-induced changes in the expression of genes belonging to all COG categories from the MAFF303099 genome (Fig. 5). For all COG categories, the percentage of underexpressed genes is higher than that of overexpressed genes (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S1). In addition to the fact that a high number of differentially expressed genes are not in a COG (1580 genes), there are also many poorly characterized genes (‘S—function unknown’ and ‘R—general function prediction only’ categories) (Supplementary Fig. S1). Percentage of genes from each COG category overexpressed and underexpressed after the heat shock. Genes not in a COG are also shown. The number of genes included in each category is shown at the right end of the graphic.Percentage of genes from each COG category overexpressed and underexpressed after the heat shock. Genes not in a COG are also shown. The number of genes included in each category is shown at the right end of the graphic.The COG category with the highest percentage of overexpressed genes is ‘L—replication, recombination and repair’ (9%). This COG category also shows the lowest percentage of underexpressed genes (12%). Nevertheless, the percentage of overexpressed genes is between 7 and 8% in nine other categories, including the COG category where chaperones and other heat shock proteins are included (‘O—posttranslational modification, protein turnover and chaperones’). This suggests a balanced response in terms of gene induction throughout the COG categories; yet, ~13% of the overexpressed genes are not in a COG. Three categories include a high percentage of underexpressed genes following a heat shock, namely ‘D—cell cycle control, cell division, chromosome partitioning’, ‘F—nucleotide transport and metabolism’ and ‘N—cell motility’ (53, 48 and 44%, respectively). COG categories with a high number of overexpressed genes are ‘K—transcription’, ‘G—carbohydrate transport and metabolism’ and ‘E—amino acid transport and metabolism’ (Supplementary Fig. S1A). On the other hand, COG categories E and G also show a high number of underexpressed genes (Supplementary Fig. S1B). This is consistent with other bacterial species for which these two COG categories also showed a high number of over- and underexpressed genes in response to heat shock.46,48 According to Konstantinidis and Tiedje,56 large genomes tend to have a disproportional increase of genes belonging to COG ‘K—transcription’, ‘T—signal transduction mechanisms’ and ‘Q—secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport and catabolism’, which could be expected to be the most underexpressed categories in large genome bacteria, nevertheless that is not observed in MAFF303099 (Fig. 5 and Supple-mentary Fig. S1B).3.2. Small heat shock proteinsThe two most heat shock-induced genes (mll2387 and mll2386 with M-values of 6.61 and 6.32, respectively) code for sHSP (Table 2). These genes are probably co-transcribed, since a single putative promoter was identified upstream mll2387 (predicted promoter: -35 TTGACG and -10 ACTCATTCT). This particular sHSP operon is likely to play an important role in the heat shock response, since homologous genes were also detected as the most overexpressed in S. meliloti following a less severe heat shock.5 Following a longer heat exposure, these genes seem to be less overexpressed, yet showing an induction of approximately 4-fold.27 The homologous ibpAB are also the most-induced genes in the heat shock response of E. coli.51 Western analysis of protein extracts of several rhizobia species confirmed an increase of the amount of sHPS with temperature upshifts.25 As in many other bacteria species, in M. loti, S. meliloti and E. coli, a ROSE element was identified upstream of these operons26 (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Nevertheless, these sHSP genes were reported as rpoH-dependent in S. meliloti,5 suggesting multiple regulation mechanisms that may allow a dynamic stress response.

Gene descriptions shown in bold resulted from sequence analysis using Blast2GO software.aCOG category letters according to NCBI functional categories (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/COG/grace/fiew.cgi).Rhizobia genomes carry a large number of sHSP.25 Strain MAFF303099 has eight genes identified as sHSP, from which four were highly induced by heat shock (mll2387, mll2386, mll9627 and mll3033), two remained unaltered (mll2257 and mlr3192) and two were underexpressed (mlr4720 and mlr4721). sHSP can be divided into two classes in terms of sequence: class A includes sHSP similar to E. coli IbpAB, while sHSP grouped in class B are more divergent in terms of sequence.25 Gene mll2387 belongs to class A, while mll2386 is more divergent and considered a class B sHSP.57 According to Studer & Narberhaus58 it is improbable that mll2386 and mll2387 could form hetero-oligomers even if co-expressed, since in B. japonicum hetero-oligomers only occurred between sHSP from the same class. All class A sHSP from M. loti MAFF303099 (mll2387, mll3033, mlr3192 and mll9627-plasmid encoded) showed a ROSE element downstream to the promoter, which would confer high-temperature sensitivity to the transcription of these genes26 (Supplementary Fig. S2A). However, one of these sHSP was not overexpressed following the heat shock tested (mll3192-hspH), despite the fact that its B. japonicum homolog, also regulated by a ROSE element, is heat inducible.253.3. GroESL chaperone systemSimilar to other heat shock related genes, rhizobia genomes harbour several copies of the groESL operon, usually with different regulation mechanisms and expression kinetics.15M. loti MAFF303099 has four groESL operons in the chromosome and one in pMLa. From these five operons, only one appears to be involved in heat shock response, namely the groEL gene mlr2394, which was strongly overexpressed after heat shock exposure (M = 5.79). This groEL gene is highly similar to groEL5 and groEL1 from S. meliloti (87 and 83% amino acid identity, respectively), which are the most heat shock-inducible copies in that species.5,27From what is known from other rhizobia genera, only some groESL operons encoded in the same genome are heat inducible and those can be regulated either by the s32 or by CIRCE element.12,13,59 In the case of MAFF303099, a CIRCE element was found upstream all groESL operons (Supplementary Fig. S2B). The same exact consensus sequence of this inverted repeat is found in three operons and the remaining two operons differ in only two positions. The overexpressed groEL gene belongs to one of the operons regulated by a slightly divergent CIRCE element. Our results suggest that the presence of a CIRCE consensus sequence does not ensure a highly efficient induction under heat stress conditions. A similar situation was detected in R. leguminosarum, where a putative CIRCE element was found upstream of all three groESL operons, and further analysis of this regulation mechanism showed that the most heat-inducible operon was indeed CIRCE regulated, but a second operon, less induced by heat, was not affected by CIRCE deletion or hrcA knockout.17 This second operon was rpoH regulated, suggesting an overlapping of regulation mechanisms.17Despite the high M-value detected for the groEL mlr2394, the expression of the groES gene in the same operon (mlr2393) following the heat shock remained unaltered. Similarly, in S. meliloti, the gene SMb22023 (groES5) was not induced by heat shock, despite the high induction of the corresponding groEL5 gene (SMb21566).5,27 No promoter could be identified in the 59 bp groES–groEL intergenic space using BProm, so a bicistronic mRNA should be synthesized. A posttranscriptional cleavage could explain why only the transcript of the second gene in the operon is highly abundant. A cleavage event occurs in the groESL transcript of Agrobacterium tumefaciens, explaining why the transcript corresponding to groEL alone is the abundant mRNA detected after heat shock.60 Analysing the intergenic space in the MAFF303099 groES–groEL operon, using the ‘KineFold Web Server’,61 a stem-loop structure was found, though weaker than the one described to undergo cleavage in A. tumefaciens (data not shown). GroES–GroEL complexes comprising proteins encoded by different operons tend to be less efficient than the chaperonins complexes encoded by the same operon.62 However, the predominant GroES–GroEL complex consists of a single 10 kDa-heptameric ring (GroES) plus two rings of seven 60 kDa-monomers (GroEL), so the ratio between the two is 1:2, which is consistent with a lower groES transcription.3.4. DnaKJ chaperone systemThe role of the DnaKJ chaperone system in stress response is well known in other bacteria; however, few studies address these heat shock proteins in rhizobia. In the present study, dnaK (mll4757) and the co-chaperone dnaJ (mll4755) were not found to be significantly heat shock induced. Nevertheless, the real-time qRT–PCR results (Table 1) show that dnaK was induced by heat shock, agreeing with previous studies in Mesorhizobium.16 Approximately, 2-fold induction of the dnaK gene was detected in S. meliloti cells exposed to 40°C for 30 min,5 while no induction was reported for a shorter heat shock (42°C for 15 min).27 In the microarray analysis, the changes in expression levels of the dnaK gene were considered not statistically significant due to discrepancies among replicates.It was reported for several rhizobia species that dnaJ deletions cause reduced growth at high temperatures;21,24 however, no transcriptional activation following a heat shock was detected in the present study or in other studies with S. meliloti.5,27 Similar to our results, no induction of grpE was reported for S. meliloti by Sauviac and coworkers,27 while a different study showed induction of grpE by heat shock.5Another heat shock protein that has a close interaction with the DnaKJ system is ClpB. The clpB gene (mll3429) was found to be overexpressed in the present study, with an M-value of 2.93. The clpB gene was already seen to be upregulated following a heat shock in S. meliloti5,27 and the importance of ClpB in rhizobia stress response, especially to heat shock, was also previously reported.63 Similar to E. coli, the knockout of the clpB gene in Mesorhizobium ciceri led to an inability to endure high temperatures. Furthermore, in M. ciceri the symbiotic performance was also negatively affected.63,64 These results are consistent with the ClpB role in denatured protein disaggregation, namely by its cooperation with the DnaKJ system.653.5. Sigma factorsRhizobia usually have multiple copies of genes encoding the same sigma factors, for example rpoH and rpoE. The M. loti MAFF303099 genome includes 25 putative sigma factors, from which four were induced by heat shock (mlr0407, mll3697, mll8140 and mlr3807). None of these sigma factor-encoding genes is completely annotated; nevertheless, BLAST analysis showed that loci mlr0407 (highly induced) and mll8140 are similar to both s70 and s24, and mlr3807 is more similar to s24, while mll3697 shows high similarity to the S. meliloti rpoE2 gene (76%). Sauviac and collaborators27 suggested RpoE2 as the major global regulator of stress response in S. meliloti, despite the fact that no phenotype change was detected in the rpoE2 mutant. Our results are consistent with that suggestion, since mll3697 is overexpressed in heat shock conditions with an M-value of 2.4. The gene mll2869 encoding s70 was found to be underexpressed following heat shock conditions, which may contribute to the extensive downregulation detected in MAFF303099 transcriptional response.Sigma factors typically related to the heat shock response, as s32 (rpoH) and s24 (rpoE) that probably are encoded by mlr3741 and mlr8088 in MAFF303099, were not affected at the transcriptional level by the heat shock conditions applied. The gene rpoH2 (mlr3862) was also not induced in the conditions used in this study. Similarly, Martínez-Salazar and coworkers6 reported that none of the rpoH genes were induced by heat shock in R. etli. Nevertheless, rpoH mutants are usually impaired in their stress tolerance phenotype, as is the case for S. meliloti and R. etli.6,66rpoH1 controls the expression of ~21% of the heat shock-induced genes in S. meliloti and is also related to oxidative stress response, while rpoH2 seems to play a minor role in the heat shock response and is more involved in osmotic tolerance.5,6In E. coli, the rpoH regulation seems to be more at the protein level than at the transcriptional level. This control hypothesis is known as the ‘unfolded protein titration model’ and involves the most important chaperone systems: under normal growth conditions, s32 binds to DnaKJ and GroESL so it becomes unavailable for RNA polymerase binding; under heat stress, misfolded proteins have higher affinity for chaperone systems and s32 would be released.67 This posttranslational regulation has not been investigated in rhizobia, nevertheless the fact that no rpoH induction was detected under heat stress conditions is consistent with the proposed model.3.6. Nodulation and nitrogen fixation genesSome of the genes involved in nodulation and nitrogen fixation were detected to be differentially expressed after heat shock. Several fix genes showed severe underexpression, especially fixK, which encodes a transcriptional regulator and was the most underexpressed gene following the heat stress (Supplementary Table S2). The FixK is an activator for several operons, namely fiXNOQP and fixGHIS and the fixK gene is upregulated by micro-oxic conditions.68 MAFF303099 genome encodes two fixNOPQ operons (encoding cytochrome oxidases), one located in the symbiosis island. Interestingly, all the fix genes found to be underexpressed (fixK, fixJ, fixS, fixI, fixP, fixO, fixN) are outside the symbiosis island. Uchiumi and collaborators69 suggested that rhizobia might have acquired a housekeeping fixNOPQ operon before the acquisition of the symbiosis island. Similar to the present study, fix genes were previously detected to be underexpressed after a heat shock in S. meliloti,5 so a downregulation of the fixK cascade upon high-temperature conditions seems to be consistent. In S. meliloti, fixK is negatively regulated by the activity of fixT; however, no fixT gene is annotated in MAFF303099 genome (the most similar gene is msl5852, which is not differentially expressed in the present study).From the high number of nodulation genes encoded in the M. loti MAFF303099 genome (>40 genes) only 11 showed altered transcript levels after the heat shock. The genes nodC and nodE were heat induced, while nine other nodulation genes were underexpressed. Only nodL was previously reported to be underexpressed following heat shock conditions in S. meliloti5,27 but this gene expression remained unaltered in the present study.3.7. Other heat shock-inducible genesAmong the 50 genes with the highest M-values (Table 2), there are five transcriptional regulators, one sigma factor and one anti-sigma factor, which indicates that heat shock response is a complex system with relevant control at the transcriptional level.Additional analysis of all hypothetical proteins differentially expressed performed in this study, allowed further characterization of many genes, for example mll4607, which is now annotated as Ku protein (Table 2). Together with LigD this protein is involved in DNA repair, namely in the repair of non-homologous end-joining of double-strand DNA.70 Unlike other bacteria, rhizobial genomes encode multiple copies of this Ku/LigD system, which has been further studied in S. meliloti.71 Although none of the ku homologues is required for the symbiosis establishment, this DNA repair system is active in both free-living cells and bacteroids.71 From the four ku homologs in the MAFF303099 genome, three are induced by heat shock (mll4607, mlr9624 and mlr9623), as well as one of the three ligD homologues (mll9625). Until recently, double-stranded DNA breaks (DSB) were not thought to be a consequence of heat shock; however, a recent study, using eukaryotic cells, showed that heat shock may in fact induce DSB on certain phases of the cell cycle.72 It is tempting to agree with the suggestion from Kobayashi and coworkers71 that these systems do have some role under stress conditions, such as heat shock.Altogether our results suggest that in a large bacterial genome, the extensive gene downregulation may be an important part of the heat shock response. Although the present study has contributed to further knowledge on rhizobia stress response, future studies are required to understand the role of individual genes and the mechanisms regulating these molecular responses.Supplementary dataSupplementary Data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was funded by Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT), including the research projects FCOMP-01-0124-FEDER-007091, PTDC/BIA-EVF/4158/2012 and the strategic project PEst-C/AGR/UI0115/2011, that include FEDER funds through the Operational Programme for Com-petitiveness Factors—COMPETE and National funds.

IntroductionThe swine (Sus scrofa domesticus), particularly the miniature breeds, has been used as an important biomedical model organism for human disease studies because of the similarity in size, anatomy and physiology, as well as in organ development and disease progression with those of human.1 Bama pig and Tibetan pig, two Chinese indigenous miniature pig breeds inhabiting in Guangxi province and Tibetan plateau, respectively, are increasingly developed as animal models for medical studies in recent years. The relevant applications included the utilization of them as a model for human drug evaluation, xenotransplantation and diverse disease studies, and the developments of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell lines.2–9 Despite of their significant role in medical studies, our knowledge of whole-genome information at the transcript level (i.e. transcriptome) in these two breeds remains limited. For instance, patterns of transcriptome divergence between different postnatal developmental stages within and between the two breeds, which are from regions of different altitudes (Bama pig, 600–800 m above sea levels (m.a.s.l.); Tibetan pig, 2500–4300 m.a.s.l.), are poorly studied.With the rapid development in genomics, it is essential for a model organism to create deep genomic sequence data10–12 as well as detailed and integrated transcriptome data13,14 for tissues across developmental stages. Although the pig genome and transcriptome profiles have been characterized in some breeds in recent years,11,15–20 the transcriptome profiling still need further improvement in the characterization of both more tissues (organs) and more different developmental stages of these organs. For example, the transcriptome profiling of swine pituitary gland at different developmental stages would be an important add-in to a comprehensive profile of the porcine transcriptome.The pituitary gland, as a ‘master’ endocrine organ, receives signals from the brain and uses these messages to produce hormones that regulate developmental and physiological processes including growth, pubertal development, metabolic status, reproduction, lactation, and the capacity to cope with stress.21,22 Hence, profiling the transcriptome patterns of pituitary gland along the developmental process may enable us to understand not only the physiological functions of genes in the organ but also how the expression dynamics shapes the development characteristics at the individual or breed level. In this study, we investigated the anterior pituitary transcriptome in Bama (BM) pig and Tibetan (TN) pig at three representative stages: infancy (1.5-month), puberty (4-month), and adulthood (6-month for BM, and 8-month for TN) using Solexa RNA-seq technologies. These results allowed us to establish a general overview on the differential dynamics of gene expression in the swine pituitary gland, and further investigate the underlying functional differences in differentially expressed genes among the postnatal development stages and between the breeds.2. Materials and methods2.1. The animal and samplingThree Bama male pigs and three Tibetan male pigs were included in this study (Supplementary Data). The Bama pigs were housed in a miniature pig farm in Chongqing city, southwest China. The farm was managed by the Department of Laboratory Animal Science of College of Basic Medical Sciences in the Third Military Medical University. They are the descendants of sows and boars obtained from the original stocks at Bama County, Guangxi Province. The Tibetan pigs were housed in a pig farm in Nyingchi Prefecture, east of Tibet Autonomous Region, China, and the farm was managed by the College of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry of the Tibet University. They are from the pure stocks captured in the wild in originally distributional areas in Tibet. The three Bama male pigs consist of one 1.5-month-old (BM1, infancy, weight = 5.8 kg, 7 January 2010), one 4-month-old (BM4, puberty, weight = 11 kg, 22 January 2010), and one 6-month-old (BM6, adulthood, weight = 20 kg, 22 January 2010). The three Tibetan male pigs include one 1.5-month-old (TN1, infancy, weight = 8.75 kg, 29 January 2010), one 4-month-old (TN4, puberty, weight = 12.5 kg, 29 January 2010), and one 8-month-old (TN8, adulthood, weight = 52.5 kg, 29 January 2010). The status of sexual maturation in pubertal and adult pigs was examined by the pig farmers by their long-term experiences. Pubertal pigs are defined as the pigs that are capable of sexual reproduction, i.e. the first ejaculation. Adult pig refers to the pig reaching to body mature. Procedures involving animals were approved by the Committee for Animal Experiments of the Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China (No. IOZ13015) and complied with the Laboratory Animal Management Principles of China. The animals were euthanized by intravenous injection of pentobarbital sodium (150 mg/kg). The tissues were sampled immediately after death. The tissues were washed with saline, then cut into small pieces and saturated in Sample Protector (TaKaRa Code: D311A, TaKaRa Biotechnology (Dalian) Co., Ltd., China) and stored in -80°C refrigerator for preservation before use. TrIzol (Life Technologies (Beijing), China) was used to isolate total RNA following the manufacturer's protocols.2.2. cDNA library construction and sequencingSequencing libraries were prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions (Illumina, USA). Poly(A) mRNA was isolated from the total RNA through two purification rounds using poly-T oligo-attached magnetic beads, and was further fragmented. The first-strand cDNA was generated using reverse transcriptase and random hexamer primers. Following the second-strand cDNA synthesis and adaptor ligation, 300–400-bp cDNA fragments were isolated. The paired-end cDNA libraries were then prepared in accordance with Illumina's protocols and sequenced on Illumina GAII platform to generate 80-bp paired-end reads. The Illumina data processing pipeline version 1.4 was applied in image analysis and base calling.2.3. Bioinformatics analysisAfter trimming low-quality reads using FASTX Toolkit v0.0.13, the high-quality paired reads were aligned against the reference genome of Sus Scrofa (Sscrofa9.2; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/111518/) using the Burrows–Wheeler Alignment Tool23 (BWA) with allowing up to four mismatches and other default options. Alignments were also performed against the junction database (for 75 bp × 2) constructed by permutation and combination of exons for each gene. We counted the number of reads mapped to exons, introns, splice junctions, intron–exon adjacent regions, and intergenic regions of the annotated genes, respectively.The gene expression levels were measured as numbers of reads per kilobase of exon model in a gene per million mapped reads (RPKM).14 Genes (RPKM > 0) that were detected commonly in all the six samples were assigned as co-genes. To annotate the function of these co-genes, we conducted Gene Ontology (GO) analysis24 at the third level for each of the three main categories: ‘biological process’, ‘cellular component’, and ‘molecular function’ using in-house Perl scripts, which, by our experiences in data analysis, can explicitly and properly illustrate the functions of these genes and cluster the genes into categories based on their functions.Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) between different stages in each breed were identified with a R package named ‘DEGseq’.25 We took those with the combination of ‘at least two mapped reads, FDR (false discovery rate) =0.001 and the log2-fold changes =1’ of a gene at one stage in comparisons to the other two stages as stage-specific highly upregulated genes. We averaged the RPKM values at the three stages of each gene, and calculate the log2-fold changes of each gene between the two breeds. Genes with log2-fold change =1 or = -1 were assigned as the BM-specific (BHU) or TN-specific highly upregulated (THU) genes. These stage- or breed-specific highly upregulated genes were annotated in GO terms involved in biological process (P-value < 0.05). To reveal the expression profile of pituitary hormone genes among the developmental stages, we calculated the fold-change ratios in gene expression levels based on RPKM between the two adjacent stages in each breed.RNA-seq technology has the advantages of quickly and reliably discovering single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We conducted transcriptome comparisons between the two pig breeds and between each and the reference genome sequence of Duroc. SNPs were identified from the consensus sequence among the three transcriptome datasets within each of the breeds, and were referred that sequence within each breed to the reference genome sequence, respectively, using Sequence Alignment/Map tools version 0.1.1726 (SAMtools; http://samtools.sourceforge.net) with the following criteria: nucleotide with reads mapping quality score =60; consensus quality score =30; sequence depth =10. Further annotation of the SNPs was made with in-house Perl scripts.3. Results3.1. High-throughput sequencing and reads mappingWe obtained a number of ca 53.21, 49.05, 42.07, 47.05, 57.50, and 51.68 millions of raw reads for BM1, BM4, BM6, TN1, TN4, TN8, respectively (Table 1). The total length of the reads was over 24 gigabases (Gbs), representing around 8.9-fold of the whole pig genome (ca 2.7 Gbs). After discarding low-quality reads, 73.84–89.66% of the raw reads were remained as high-quality reads. Of which, 59.18–69.3% was mapped uniquely to the pig reference genome, 10.05–12.81% showed multiple matches (hereafter the ‘good matches’ referred to the unique and multiple matches), 14.25–18.23% had no matches, and the remaining 7.14–12.54% were further filtered as ‘bad’ matches at a coarser level or matched with only one end of the paired-end reads (Fig. 1a). The genomic distribution patterns of uniquely mapped reads showed that a majority of the reads located in annotated genic regions, with an average of 82.61% for BM and 85.96% for TN (Fig. 1b). 30.21–37.72% completely fell in annotated exons, 27.47–42.78% fully located in introns, 14.01–19.59% positioned to splice junctions, 0.46–1.04% overlapped with exons and introns. The remaining 8.25–23.16% of the uniquely mapped reads was assigned to intergenic regions. Furthermore, the number of uniquely mapped reads assigned to a known gene (at least with one mapped read) varied substantially in the samples, ranging from one to over three million with a median of 200–300 reads for each sample (Fig. 1c).

The black line in the box represents the median.3.2. Global gene expression analysisA total of 15 715 annotated genes were detected with RPKM > 0 in the two breeds at all the three stages (Supplementary Table S1). Of these genes, a large proportion (90.33%, 14 195/15 715) was detected commonly to the two breeds, whereas a much smaller proportion (3.72%, 585/15 715; 5.95%, 935/15 715) were represented exclusively in Bama and Tibetan pig (Supplementary Table S2). With respect to the different developing stages, 13 249, 13 286, 13 887, 14 132, 13 623, and 13 739 genes were detected from each of the transcriptome datasets for BM1, BM4, BM6, TN1, TN4, and TN8, respectively (Fig. 2a). In Bama pig, a total of 12 244 genes were represented at all three stages. 160, 570, and 424 genes were identified commonly between each pair of stages, while 421, 312, and 649 genes were discovered exclusively for BM1, BM4, and BM6, respectively. Similarly, 12 601 genes were represented at all three stages in Tibetan pig. 431, 235, and 496 genes were expressed commonly between each pair of stages, while 604, 356, and 407 genes were discovered uniquely in TN1, TN4, and TN8, respectively. It was worth noting that the numbers of genes detected in the samples were very similar between the two breeds in terms of RPKM (Fig. 2b).

Expression characterization in pituitary transcriptomeIn total, 11 844 co-genes were detected and were undergoing GO analysis, and 9381 of which were assigned to 431 GO terms. The number of genes allocated to different terms ranged from 1 to 6507. Among the significantly enriched GO terms (P-value < 0.05), the top 10 from each GO category with the highest numbers of co-genes were shown in Table 2, mainly being involved in metabolic process, positioning to cell part, and functioning in protein binding. The top 10 terms with highest number of co-genes in each of the three main categories of gene ontology (GO) at a significant level of 0.001 (P < 0.001)The top 10 terms with highest number of co-genes in each of the three main categories of gene ontology (GO) at a significant level of 0.001 (P < 0.001)To further characterize the unique gene expression profile in the pituitary, we included 61 genes that recurrently appeared in the top 100 most highly transcribed genes of each sample, and then grouped them into five categories in terms of their functions (Supplementary Table S3). The first category included the most actively transcribed genes for pituitary hormones (growth hormone (GH), glycoprotein hormones alpha (CGA), prolactin (PRL), Lutropin subunit beta (LHB), and follicle stimulating hormone beta (FSHB), which were expressed specifically and specify the pituitary gland. The second and third category contains ribosomal protein genes and mitochondrial redox carrier protein genes, respectively, which were intensively expressed due to the protein synthesis and energy requirement for the animal development. The fourth category contains genes encoding proteins with divergent functions, such as Neuronatin (NNAT) was reported to participate in the maintenance of segment identity in pituitary development,27 and considered to be associated with the pituitary adenomas.28 Chromogranin B (CHGB) is a neuroendocrine secretory granule protein playing an important role during vesicle biogenesis29 and secretion of hormones to exocytosis via the regulatory pathway.30 Most of the other genes were not expressed specifically in the pituitary, and thus were considered housekeeping genes, and some of these genes may employ as internal standards, such as ACTB and GAPDH.31 The fifth category contains genes annotated to be miRNA in Ensembl.3.4. Expressional differences among the developing stagesWe identified 1123, 64, 172, 1379, 210, and 132 DEGs that were stage-specific highly upregulated genes for BM1, BM4, BM6, TN1, TN4, and TN8, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S1). In GO enrichment analysis, a total of 80 GO terms involved in biological process were significantly (P < 0.05) enriched across the three stages in both the breeds (Supplementary Table S4). Most of the terms were enriched at the first stage, being 44 for BM1and 40 for TN1. In contrast, much less terms were enriched at the latter two stages: 2 for BM4, 7 for TN4, 8 for BM6, and 5 for TN8.At the first stage, GO terms are mainly involved in metabolic process and development process for both the breeds. In addition, GO terms were also involved in cell proliferation, cell death, etc. for BM1, and reproductive process and sexual reproduction for TN1. At the second stage, BM4 was represented by only two GO terms of behaviour and lymphocyte co-stimulation. For TN4, however, most of the enriched terms were related to response to stimuli. At the third stage, GO terms represented at BM6 were mainly related to organism development, and terms related to organism movement were enriched for TN8 (Supplementary Table S4).3.5. Expression differences between the two breedsA total of 1600 BHU and 759 THU genes were identified, and then were enriched in 74 and 16 GO terms involving in biological process, respectively (Supplementary Table S5). The 74 GO terms for Bama pig mainly referred to the development process, such as multicellular organismal development (204), anatomical structure development (192), cellular developmental process (130), and anatomical structure morphogenesis (120), negative regulation of biological process (115), followed by regulation of biological process, such as positive regulation of biological process (149), regulation of biological quality (126), positive regulation of cellular process (133), and response to stress (109). However, The 16 GO terms for Tibetan pig mainly involved in stimuli response, such as response to stress (45), system process (35), and response to external stimulus (25).3.6. Hormone genes expression pattern in postnatal pig pituitaryThe four most highly expressed hormone genes (GH, PRL, LHB, and FSHB) exhibited three different expression patterns among the three stages in the two breeds (Fig. 3). Both GH and PRL genes were expressed as a low–high–low pattern. The expression level of GH in Bama pig increased with ca 3.23-fold, up to 100384.4 RPKM at BM4, and then decreased to ca 0.84-fold at BM6, and similarly in Tibetan pig. Similar pattern of gene activity change was observed in the PRL gene as the GH gene between the three stages within breed. However, FSHB and LHB gene showed different expression patterns between the two breeds: for FSHB gene, it displayed a low–high–low pattern in Bama pig and a gradient of increasing expression pattern in Tibetan pig; for LHB gene, it exhibited a high–low–high expression pattern in Bama pig and a low–high–low expression pattern in Tibetan pig (Supplementary Table S6). The expression levels of four anterior pituitary hormones in the six libraries measured in RPKM.The expression levels of four anterior pituitary hormones in the six libraries measured in RPKM.3.7. SNP identificationWe identified 19 996, 15 964, and 2213 SNPs in the sequence comparisons of Bama pig versus Duroc, Tibetan pig versus Duroc, and Bama pig versus Tibetan pig, respectively (Table 3; Supplementary Table S7). The largest proportion (34.2%) of SNPs was found in intergenic regions. Around 19.5% of the SNPs were located in intronic regions, 26.4% in coding regions, 9% in the 3'-UTR and 1.8% in the 5'-UTR. In addition, ca 1.3% of the SNPs were found in the 500-bp upstream from the translation start site, which was much lower than that in the 500-bp downstream from the stop codon (7.8%). In the comparison of Bama pig versus Duroc, the total numbers of non-synonymous and synonymous SNPs were 2271 and 2732, respectively, with ratios of 1:1.2 and 1.47:1 for the Bama pig versus Duroc, Tibetan pig versus Duroc, respectively, while 4.4:1 for Bama pig versus Tibetan pig.

DiscussionWe present here, to the best of our knowledge, the first comprehensive exploration of gene expression dynamics in the pituitary gland of miniature pig as implemented by RNA-seq technology. We found the proportions of uniquely mapped reads located in introns (27.47–42.78%) and splice junctions (14.01–19.59%) was much higher than that in other species.14,32 Most of the DEGs were identified at the first stage than the latter two stages, and the gene functions were also represented at BM1 and TN1 by cellular process and reproductive process, respectively. The number of SNPs identified between the two miniature breeds and Duroc was much larger than that within the two miniature pigs.In this study, we found that 24.84% of the total high-quality paired-end reads (ca 246 millions) were filtered as unmatched, single-end matched, and bad matched reads, which could be due to the low sequence coverage of the swine reference genome (0.66×),33 reference genome errors, sequencing errors, and the mapping-defined criteria. Compared with that in other mammalian,13,14 a much larger proportion of uniquely mapped reads falls into the annotated intronic (on average: 33.07%) and intergenic (15.71%) regions, which suggested that the swine reference genome are far from being fully annotated. However, our transcriptome data have covered a large portion of the annotated transcripts (76.8%, 15 715/20 460) at Ensembl database (http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/susScr2/chromosomes/), indicating the robust ability of RNA-seq in discovering transcripts with lowly expressed values.34 The proportion (90.33%) of transcripts common in the two breeds is larger than that common in the stages within each breed (BM, 82.84%; TN, 83.28%), implying that the transcriptome variability derived from the different developing stages is much higher than that from the breeds. This is in accordance with the results from previous studies,35–37 which showed that a much larger fraction of transcriptome variability is explained by the tissue difference rather than the breed.GO analysis for the co-expressed genes showed that most of the genes are involved in metabolic process and cellular process of biological process, the cell part and organelle of a cellular component, and the binding and catalytic activity of molecular function. Similar results are found in the transcriptome analysis of European eel,38 rainbow trout,39 silver carp,40 and muscle and ovary of a landrace female pig.20 A greater number of DEGs were upregulated at the first stage than that at the latter two stages in both the breeds, showing the pituitary gland was undergoing vigorous development process at the first stage. This finding was confirmed by the results derived from GO analysis, which showed that the first stage was greatly over-represented by the GO terms related to metabolic process and development process. The expression of BHU and THU genes illustrated the differences between the two miniature breeds. Bama pig was dominated by the expression of genes referred to organism development, whereas Tibetan pig was dominated by the expression of genes involved in response to stress. We also observed a larger number of BHU genes than that of THU genes, indicating that more genes were highly expressed in Bama pig than that in Tibetan pig.Four hormone genes (GH, PRL, LHB, and FSHB) recurrently appeared in all the six sequencing libraries with extremely high expression levels. Any abnormality in the production of these hormones will cause isolated anterior pituitary hormone deficiencies and combined pituitary hormone deficiencies,41,42 implying their pivot roles in forming the molecular basis of the tissue specificity of the pituitary gland and enabling the normal development of different parts of the body. The GH gene, which is in critical need of normal growth of an individual, showed a postnatal growth wave peak at the second stage (BM4 and TN4) in both the breeds. This is in accordance with earlier observations that the inflexion point of growth curve of body weight in Bama pig was during 15–18 weeks in age,43 and the fast growth rate in the muscle fiber area of Tibetan male pig was reported in the 4th month compared with other months (2nd, 3rd, 5th, and 6th month).44 The PRL gene, which was reported to have the ability to stimulate mammary growth, reproduction, and lactation,45 showed a similar expression pattern as the GH gene, further confirmed that the intensive growth performance happens in ca the 4th month after birth. The different expression patterns of FSHB and LHB gene between the two pig breeds may be dependent on their stages of pubertal development, suggesting an earlier age of pubertal maturation in Bama pig than that in Tibetan pig. However, this observation is worthy of a further investigation like the profiling of plasma LHB and FSHB levels in peri-pubertal stages of the pigs.A larger numbers of SNPs were found between Bama pig (or Tibetan pig) versus Duroc than that between Bama pig versus Tibetan pig, indicating the divergence between the miniature pig and the large pig is greater than that between the two miniature pigs. Nevertheless, it should be noted that we could not clearly determine how many SNPs are doubtless due to RNA editing, sequence errors (in spite of sequence quality filtration), mapping error, or the reference sequencing errors.32In conclusion, we have presented here so far the most complete transcriptome data available for pituitary gland along the postnatal developing stages in Chinese native miniature pig. We found a large fraction of transcriptome variability, which can be explained by the difference between postnatal developing stages rather than between breeds. We also noted that the differences might be the reflection of genomic variations of individual pigs and experimental variations (e.g. tissue extraction, RNA preparation, and library construction), although the possibilities should be minimal. The four most actively transcribed hormone genes are indicative of their important functions throughout the period of postnatal development. The differences between stages and between breeds can be illustrated by the stage- and breed-specific upregulated genes. The SNPs analysis revealed the greater divergence between the two miniature pig breeds and the large breed. These findings provide new insights into the postnatal developing process of the pig pituitary gland, and will facilitate further genomic and gene function researches on the miniature pig.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis study was supported by grants from the National Basic Research Program of China (2011CB944100) and the National Transgenic Breeding Project of China (2013ZX08009-003).We thank Shuhui Song, Dongmei Tian for suggestions on data analysis, Yongqiao Sun for helping in the construction of sequencing libraries.Supplementary data"

IntroductionCulture-independent and 16S rRNA gene-based analysis is widely used to profile microbial communities.1 Such profiling of 16S rRNA genes has revolutionized our understanding of microbial communities by allowing the characterization of the diversity of the uncultured majority.2 Moreover, ongoing development of massively parallel DNA sequencing technologies allows deep sequencing of a sample and simultaneous sequencing of many samples per run via low-cost bar-coding techniques.3 Because of its advantages over the traditional Sanger sequencing, the massively parallel sequencing has been applied to large-scale sequencing projects, including the analysis of 16S rRNA gene amplicons from diverse microbial communities.4,5The Roche 454 Genome Sequencer FLX system6 is commonly used for the massively parallel sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene amplicons.5 Several studies have suggested that short (450–600 nt) reads obtained by the 454 platform7 are sufficient for the taxonomic assignment and the subsequent community comparison when the regions in 16S rRNA genes to be sequenced are carefully chosen.8 Notably, appropriate primer selection is a critical issue for analysing diverse microbial communities.9 The bias arising from poor complementarity between primers and 16S rRNA genes in particular taxa leads to underestimation of these taxa in a microbial community.10,11 Although the primer sets specific to Bacteria (e.g. the 338F and 533R set, which PCR-amplifies and covers the V3 regions of 16S rRNA genes)12 have generally been used for community profiling,5,12 recent studies of Archaea have revealed its ubiquitous distribution in diverse environments and its important roles in various ecosystems (e.g. ammonia oxidization in soil and seawater).13 To investigate the relative composition of Bacteria and Archaea and their ecological interaction in a microbial community,14 universal primer sets that can amplify both bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA genes are needed.15 Although many sets of universal primers have been designed for this purpose,9,10,15–17 some such primers have led to the amplification of eukaryotic 18S rRNA genes and small-subunit rRNA genes from mitochondria and chloroplasts.10,18 Moreover, it is often difficult to estimate the number and diversity of the eukaryotic rRNA genes present in the environment before conducting the sequence-based community analysis.18 Therefore, the use of primers that amplify rRNA genes of eukaryotic origins has led to mischaracterization of the diversity of microbial communities that were associated with eukaryotic cells.19,20 This unfavourable situation is very serious in the case of host-associated habitats (e.g. the human skin, oral cavity, and vagina).21The aim of this study is to overcome the problems associated with primer choice, and we attempted to identify the novel universal primers that complement only conserved bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA gene sequences so that eukaryotic and organelle rRNA gene sequences would not be amplified. In general, the commonly used degenerate primers do not always achieve a better taxonomic coverage than the non-degenerate primers,22 and other recently designed degenerate primers still introduce a level of bias into the community profile.23 Therefore, our present study was focused on only the non-degenerate universal primers. The primer set identified in this study was experimentally used to show the taxonomic composition of a soil microbial community by amplifying 16S rRNA genes from the microbial metagenomic sample and subsequent pyrosequencing using the Roche 454 system. To evaluate the appropriateness of our original primer set to the taxonomic bias that might result from the PCR amplification, the same metagenomic sample was also used for (i) pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene fragments after their amplification by use of the 338F and 533R set and (ii) the Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (GA IIx) platform-based shotgun24 sequencing of the metagenome and subsequent finding and analysis of the 16S rRNA gene fragments, and the taxonomic compositions inferred by the three sequencing experiments were compared.2. Materials and methods2.1 Identification of universal primer candidates from genome-sequenced strainsTo identify the candidate primer sequences for the PCR amplification of prokaryotic 16S rRNA genes, such genes from genome-sequenced strains were used as references because they have been accurately sequenced, are full-length genes, have well-defined taxonomic information. Bacterial and archaeal genomic sequences were obtained from the NCBI Genome Database (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genbank/genomes/Bacteria/, accessed on 11 November 2013) in November 2008. The 16S rRNA gene sequences in each strain were identified by RNAmmer.25 Then, one 16S rRNA gene sequence per species was randomly chosen because slight sequence differences exist among the 16S rRNA genes from strains of the same species,26 and among the gene copies within a genome.27 A total of 531 16S rRNA gene sequences were chosen. Their taxonomic information was obtained from the NCBI Taxonomy Database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/taxonomyhome.html/, accessed on 11 November 2013). A multiple sequence alignment of the 531 16S rRNA gene sequences was constructed using MAFFT version 6.713 with default parameters.28To find out the candidate sequences described above, highly conserved regions identified in the reference alignment were chosen as follows. Generally, the primer lengths for the PCR-amplification of 16S rRNA genes are more than 15 nt;9 therefore, we used a sliding window of 15 nt with a step size of 1 nt across the reference alignment. For each window, we calculated the frequency of each 15-nt sequence with one mismatch allowed. The 15-nt sequences that included gaps were also considered when calculating the frequencies. The consensus sequence for each window was defined as the 15-nt sequence that was found most frequently within one mismatch among strains. The coverage rate for a consensus sequence in each phylum was defined as the percentage of matched sequences among genome-sequenced strains within one mismatch.2.2 Evaluation of each candidate universal sequence using the databases of the Ribosomal Database Project and the comparative RNA Web siteEach candidate sequence was evaluated using the Probe Match program in the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) (release 10, update 22; http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/probematch/search.jsp, accessed on 11 November 2013).29 The 615 916 16S rRNA gene sequences in the RDP were retrieved by using the parameters Strain = Both, Source = Both, Size =1200, and Quality = Good, and then these sequences were used as reference sequences of the Probe Match program for the evaluation of the candidate sequences. The coverage for a candidate sequence in each phylum of the reference sequences was calculated as the percentage of genera for which more than half of the member sequences in each genus were found to match the candidate sequence within one mismatch. Because the reference sequences contain many uncultured strains,29 their taxonomic classifications are ambiguous, especially at the species level (e.g. description of the sp. as the taxa). Therefore, we used the genus, but not the species, to calculate the coverage for each candidate sequence. More than half of the 16S rRNA gene sequences in the reference sequences lacked their 5'- or 3'-terminal regions at the time of our analysis (http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/download/release10_22_containPosition.xls, accessed on 11 November 2013). Therefore, the candidate se-quences corresponding to such regions were excluded from the subsequent analyses.The possibility of amplifying eukaryotic and organelle rRNA genes was evaluated by calculating the coverage for each primer candidate and the eukaryotic and organelle rRNA genes that were obtained from the comparative RNA Web (CRW).30 Aligned rRNA sequences of chloroplasts, mitochondria, and eukaryotes were separately downloaded from the CRW (http://www.rna.ccbb.utexas.edu/DAT/3A/Summary/index.php, accessed on 11 November 2013). The sequences containing ambiguous nucleotides (e.g. any nucleotide, N, or pyrimidine, Y) were discarded. One 16S rRNA sequence per genus was randomly chosen to reduce taxonomic bias in the dataset. After the conversion of uracil residues to thymine ones in the sequences, the coverage for each candidate sequence in the CRW-derived and subsequently processed sequences (76 chloroplastic, 480 mitochondrial, and 583 eukaryotic ones) was calculated as the percentage of matched sequences within two mismatches to eliminate the possible amplification of such rRNA genes. Based on the results of prior studies,18 we assumed that three or more mismatches between a primer and template would not allow the successful PCR amplification. The candidate sequences that covered more than 50% of the mitochondrial and eukaryotic rRNA gene sequences were also excluded to avoid the amplification of such genes. To reduce the possibility of random and non-specific amplification of non-rRNA genes, we merged neighbouring candidate sequences to extend their sequence lengths while maintaining the coverage for each phylum.The validity of our primers was compared with the validity of 17 other universal primers published in the literature (Supplementary Table S1).9,10,12,31 We investigated the coverage of our and the 17 other primer sequences for (i) the 16S rRNA genes from bacterial and archaeal phyla in the reference sequences and (ii) the CRW-derived chloroplastic, mitochondrial, and eukaryotic rRNA genes described above. To avoid the difficulties of in silico evaluation, all ambiguous nucleotides in the 17 primers were converted to the nucleotides that gave rise to the best coverage for the reference sequences of bacterial and archaeal origins.2.3 Sample processing and sequencing of a soil microbial communityA brown forest soil sample was collected in April 2008 from farmland at the Ehime Research Institute of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries, Matsuyama, Japan,32 sieved through a 2-mm mesh to remove larger particles, and transferred to a sterilized glass pot with a loose lid. After its water content was adjusted to 60% of the maximum water-holding capacity, the soil was incubated at 28°C for 24 weeks. Total DNA was thereafter extracted from 10 g of soil using a PowerMax Soil DNA Isolation kit (MoBio, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The DNA sample was concentrated by ethanol precipitation to obtain sufficient amount of DNA for PCR and metagenomic sequencing. PCR amplification of 16S rRNA genes was performed in 50 µl of 1 × Ex Taq buffer (2 mM Mg2+ Plus; Takara Bio, Ohtsu, Japan) containing 0.2 mM dNTPs, 0.625 U of TaKaRa Ex Taq HS (Takara Bio), 0.2 µM each of the forward and reverse primers, 2% dimethylsulphoxide, 0.01% bovine serum albumin, and 30 ng template DNA. Two PCR primer sets, 342F-806R and 338F-533R,12 were used. The PCR programme consisted of a single cycle of 95°C for 30 s, followed by 25 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 15 s. A final extension was performed at 72°C for 7 min. PCR amplicons from eight parallel reactions were individually concentrated and purified by gel electrophoresis, and subsequently extracted to obtain more than 2 µg of amplicons. Pooled amplicons were sequenced on a 454 GS FLX Titanium one-sixteenth picotiter plate according to the manufacturer's protocols. In addition, 1-µg portions of metagenomic DNA were sheared to approximately 200-bp fragments using a Covaris-S instrument (Covaris, Woburn, MY, USA), and adapter sequences were ligated to both ends of the DNA fragments to generate a paired-end library. The library was subjected to 76 cycles of paired-end sequencing with an Illumina GA IIx instrument (one lane of an eight-lane flow cell) using reagents of an Illumina Sequencing kit, version 3.0, followed by base-calling using GA pipeline, version 1.5.0.2.4 Sequence analysisWe used the high-quality 454 platform reads after removal of the reads that (i) contained ambiguous nucleotides, (ii) contained <150 or >250 nt in the 338F-533R experiment and <350 or >550 nt in the 342F-806R experiment, and (iii) were associated with an average Phred-like quality score of less than 20 as calculated by the 454 sequencer. Both the forward and reverse primer sequences were removed using cross-match, version 1.090518 (-minmatch 10 -minscore 12) (http://www.phrap.org/phredphrapconsed.html, accessed on 11 November 2013). Reverse-complemented reads were converted so that all reads started according to standard-sense strand conventions. Chimera sequences were detected and removed by the ChimeraSlayer in mothur version 1.11,33 using the Silva reference alignment (http://www.mothur.org/w/images/f/f1/Silva.gold.bacteria.zip, accessed on 11 November 2013). We also discarded the Illumina reads that (i) were evaluated as quality ‘N’ by purity filtering using the GA pipeline version 1.5.0 and (ii) contained more than one nucleotide with the quality-flag ‘B’ in the first 60 nt.From the 615 916 16S rRNA gene sequences that were used as the reference sequences (see above), we eliminated (i) the 117 059 sequences whose origins at the genus-level were designated as ‘unclassified,’ and (ii) forty 23S rRNA gene-derived sequences with lengths longer than 2000 nt. Six sequences (S001337843, S001337931, S001337937, S001338015, S001338173, and S001338177) that contained unusually long homopolymers were also discarded because such homopolymers have returned many hits in our sequence similarity searches of the Illumina reads. Consequently, we obtained a database consisting of a total of 498 811 high-quality 16S rRNA gene sequences whose origins at the phylum and genus are definite, and we designated this database the ‘in-house high-quality RDP’ database. This database for Bacteria and Archaea was merged with the CRW-derived and above-described rRNA gene sequence database for chloroplasts, mitochondria, and eukaryotes.Taxonomic assignment of the high-quality reads that were obtained from the 454 amplicon sequencing by use of the 338F-533R and 342F-806R primer sets was performed by a BLASTN34 search [e-value <1e-8; Identity =94% (genus) or =85% (phylum); and Alignment length =100 (for 338F-533R) or =300 (for 342F-806R)] against our merged database described above. The thresholds for alignment length were necessary to eliminate inaccurate or false-positive alignments. Identification and taxonomic assignment of 16S or 18S rRNA gene fragments in the reads obtained by the Illumina metagenomic sequencing was performed by a BLASTN search [e-value <1e-5; Identity =94% (genus) or =85% (phylum); and Alignment length =50] of our merged database.When a best hit with the largest BLAST bit score existed, one was added to the taxon of the best hit for calculation of the taxonomic composition of the microbial community. When two or more database sequences had the same best BLAST bit score, one divided by the number of best hits was added to the corresponding taxa of the best hits. To improve the accuracy of the taxonomic assignments of the Illumina reads, we used only the read pairs whose sequences (i) were identified as those in a 16S rRNA gene from the same taxon and (ii) had a consistent alignment direction between the paired reads. The distance between the paired reads was not considered because the 16S rRNA genes in some taxa contain long insertions.352.5 Nucleotide sequence accession numbersSequences have been submitted to the DDBJ Sequence Read Archive under the following accession numbers: DRR001479 and DRR001475 for the 454-read data obtained using the 338F-533R and 342F-806R primer sets, respectively, and DRR001464 for the Illumina read data by metagenomic sequencing.3. Results and discussion3.1 Identification of universal primer candidates for 16S rRNA genes from genome-sequenced strainsThere is a large collection of 16S rRNA gene sequences in the databases,26,29,30 and almost all such sequences were obtained by use of PCR. Therefore, the sequences that failed to match the universal primers do not exist in the database.36 Furthermore, many sequences in the database still contain the primer sequences used for PCR.37 On the other hand, the 16S rRNA gene sequences from the genome-sequenced prokaryotic strains contain the complete 16S rRNA gene sequences, including both terminal regions, which are missing in many cases in the databases (e.g. see http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/download/release10_22_containPosition.xls, accessed on 11 November 2013). Therefore, the 16S rRNA gene sequences from the genome-sequenced strains are expected to provide us accurate information on the variability of 16S rRNA genes from many different taxa.Information concerning the consensus sequence for each 15-nt window and its coverage rate for 16S rRNA genes from the genome-sequenced strains of each phylum is shown in Figure 1 (some of the windows) and Supplementary Figure S1 (all windows). The windows in which almost all of the dots for the archaeal (top four) and bacterial lines showed >90% sequence identities (coloured red or yellow) were the universal primer candidate sequences. The candidates with conserved sequences for almost all bacterial and archaeal phyla were identified, and 50 such sequences are listed in Supplementary Table S2. Although the list was prepared based on the genomic data available in November 2008, the use of the updated data in July 2013 did not affect the conservation pattern of 50 universal primer candidate sequences across phyla (Supplementary Table S3). Our 50 universal primer candidate sequences are well overlapped with the degenerate primer candidates proposed by Wang and Qian (Supplementary Table S4),9 in spite that their algorism and database used were different from ours. Since the maximum sequencing read by the 2nd-generation sequencers at the time of our study was up to 450 nt, 17 out of the 50 candidate universal primer sequences that are located at the 3'-terminal regions of 16S rRNA genes (e.g. sequences 1390–1395, 1491–1496, and 1525–1526, Supplementary Fig. S1) were excluded for further analysis. Because the latest systems allow the determination of sequences up to 1100 nt in length (e.g. the PacBio sequencer7 and 454 GS FLX+ system; http://454.com/products/gs-flx-system/index.asp, accessed on 11 November 2013), the excluded sequences might be useful as primer candidates in the near feature.

All of the candidate sequences covered most of the chloroplastic rRNA genes within two mismatches, indicating the difficulty in avoiding their amplification during microbial community profiling. Twenty-one out of the 33 primer candidates [514–522 (nine candidates), 781–788 (seven candidates), and 907–915 (five candidates)] had relatively large coverage in bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA genes. However, these 21 candidate sequences also covered the mitochondrial and eukaryotic rRNA genes within two mismatches; therefore, these sequences were not further considered as candidates. In cases in which the targeted microbial community contains only a small fraction of Eukaryota, these primers might be a good choice for the community profiling.The remaining 12 candidates [341–343 (three candidates), 789–792 (four candidates), 879–880 (two candidates), and 1060–1066 (three candidates)] had sequences that appeared to exclude possible amplification of mitochondrial and eukaryotic rRNA genes. Because (i) the maximum length of a high-quality read for the 454 GS FLX Titanium system was ~450 nt and (ii) the longer sequences provide more accurate taxonomic assignments,8 we chose candidates 341–343 and 789–792 as forward and reverse universal primer candidates, respectively. After merging the sequences of the neighbouring candidates, but maintaining the coverage in each phylum, we finally chose the sequence from 342 to 357 (5'-CTACGGGGGGCAGCAG-3'; 16 nt: 342F) and that from 790 to 806 (5'-GGACTACCGGGGTATCT-3'; 17 nt: 806R) as potential forward and reverse universal primers, respectively.The coverage for our universal primer set and the 17 other universal primers (Supplementary Table S1) in each of the bacterial and archaeal phyla rRNA genes, and the chloroplastic, mitochondrial, and eukaryotic rRNA genes is represented as a heat map (Fig. 2). The previously designed primers,9,10,12,31 519F–534R (four primers), 784F, 906F, and 926R, covered mitochondrial and/or eukaryotic rRNA genes within two mismatches. The coverage for our universal primer set was, when compared with those for the 17 other universal primers, relatively large for bacterial and archaeal rRNA genes; however, relatively poor coverage was observed for some phyla (e.g. Crenarchaeota, Planctomycetes, OD1, and Chlamydiae). Furthermore, our universal primers had four mismatches (on average) against mitochondrial and eukaryotic rRNA genes. Most of the 19 primers covered chloroplastic rRNA genes within two mismatches (Supplementary Table S5). This result and the data in Supplementary Fig. S2 indicate that all of universal primer sequences examined in this study would be difficult to avoid the amplifications of chloroplastic rRNA genes. Finding a universal primer that avoids the amplification of chloroplastic rRNA genes is an important issue to be carried out in the future.

The number of genera is provided in parentheses.In general, the broad-range primers targeting bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA genes tended to also amplify eukaryotic rRNA genes.10,18,20 When researchers analyse the microbial communities that contain many eukaryotic cells, the use of broad-range primers will lead to a decrease in the efficiency of sequencing and the mischaracterization of the microbial diversity in each community.19 Such communities are exemplified by eukaryotic host-associated ones: for example, the human microbiome project revealed that the average ratios of human DNA in the total metagenomic DNA extracted from several human body sites were about 50%.21 A broad-range primer, 515F, is used as a standard universal primer to analyse microbial communities in several environments in the Earth Microbiome Project (http://www.earthmicrobiome.org/, accessed on 11 November 2013). Since the 515F primer perfectly matches to many eukaryotic, mitochondrial, and chloroplastic rRNA genes, some studies that analysed animal-associated environments reported that the use of this primer also led to the amplification of many eukaryotic, mitochondrial, and chloroplastic rRNA genes.39 We primarily aimed to identify novel non-degenerate universal primers that were expected to amplify most bacterial and archaeal rRNA genes, but not eukaryotic rRNA genes. Because of this aim, our novel universal primers could not easily amplify the 16S rRNA genes from some bacterial and archaeal taxa without bias. Examples of such underrepresented taxa are the archaeal phyla, Crenarchaeota, Korarchaeota, and Nanoarchaeota, and the bacterial phyla, Chlamydiae, Lentisphaerae, OD1, OP11, Planctomycetes, and SR1 (Fig. 2). If these taxa are the major members in a microbial community of an environment, use of the 342F-806R primer set for the amplicon sequencing analysis will give rise to significantly biased taxonomic composition. To avoid misunderstanding of the compositions, the prior information related to the taxonomic composition of the community is very important. For example, Crenarchaeota is a major archaeal phylum;40 thus, in the analysis of the microbial community rich in this phylum, the combined use of our universal primer set with an established Archaea-specific universal primer set10,17 will allow more accurate description of the composition of the community. Since both of the primer sets can amplify 16S rRNA genes from Euryarchaeota, the relative abundance of this phylum in the community can be inferred, allowing us to calibrate the relative abundance of Crenarchaeota to that of Bacteria in the community.3.3 Comparison of soil microbial community profiling by pyrosequencing with the two sets of primer pairs and by Illumina metagenomic sequencingExperimental validation of our universal primers was conducted by 16S rRNA gene-based profiling of a soil microbial community with the 454 pyrosequencing. To assess whether our primer set enabled us to amplify most bacterial taxa in the soil sample in comparison with other primer sets, a commonly used bacteria-specific primer set, 338F-533R,12 was also used for the 454 pyrosequencing. The use of 16S rRNA gene fragments obtained by shotgun metagenomic sequencing can eliminate any bias that might be associated with the initial PCR amplification of 16S rRNA genes for the pyrosequencing.41 Therefore, metagenomic sequencing was additionally performed using the Illumina platform with paired-end libraries of the same sample to examine whether use of our universal primers resulted in taxonomic bias. Our sequencing and subsequent filtering generated 15 165 (338F-533R) and 27 527 (342F-806R) high-quality 454 reads by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and 12 825 888 high-quality Illumina reads (6 412 944 read pairs) by metagenomic sequencing. A total of 3026 Illumina reads were assigned to 16S rRNA genes.Our use of the two primer sets generated no 454 reads that were assigned to mitochondrial or eukaryotic rRNA genes from our refined CRW database (see Materials and methods), although eight Illumina read pairs were assigned to 18S rRNA genes from some fungi. Therefore, our universal primers did not allow the detection of the amplification of mitochondrial or eukaryotic rRNA genes.Figure 3 shows the results of a BLASTN search for phylum-level taxonomic assignment of each 454 and Illumina read against our merged in-house high-quality RDP and CRW sequence database. The numbers of taxonomically assigned reads at the phylum level were 13 591 (89.62% of the total high-quality 454 reads for the 338F-533R experiment), 26 738(97.13% of the total high-quality 454 reads for the 342F-806R experiment), and 1513 for the Illumina read pairs (3026 reads) (Supplementary Table S6). Among the three types of experiments, the taxonomic compositions at the phylum level exhibited good Spearman's correlations (P-value < 0.05): illumina versus 338F-533R, r = 0.75; Illumina versus 342F-806R, r = 0.81; and 338F-533R versus 342F-806R, r = 0.86. These three experiments identified Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria as the major phyla in the soil microbial community. The compositional bias for each phylum among the three experiments was evaluated by investigating the rank abundance of each phylum in each experiment (Fig. 4). In comparison with the Illumina metagenomic sequencing data, the 454 amplicon sequencing using the 338F-533R and 342F-806R primer sets gave rise to data in which the phyla Verrucomicrobia, Planctomycetes, Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeaota, and the phyla Planctomycetes, Crenarchaeota, OD1, and Chlamydiae, respectively, were underrepresented. Such underrepresentation might have occurred because most 16S rRNA genes from the phyla had sequences with more than two mismatches with the 338F and 342F primer sequences. The use of the 338F-533R primer set generated no 454 reads that were assigned to Euryarchaeota, being consistent with the specific amplification of only bacterial 16S rRNA genes by this primer set. Conversely, eight 454 reads by the 342F-806R experiment and ten read pairs by the Illumina metagenomic sequencing were assigned to this phylum, indicating that 342F-806R can simultaneously amplify bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA genes.

Phyla are listed in a clockwise direction according to the rank abundance in the Illumina experiment.The genus-level taxonomic assignment for the 454 and Illumina reads is depicted in Supplementary Figure S3. The numbers of reads assigned at the genus level were 9956 (65.65% of the total high-quality 454 reads for the 338F-533R experiment), 20 431(74.22% of the total high-quality 454 reads for the 342F-806R experiment), and 1041 (Illumina read pairs) (Supple-mentary Table S7). The top 20 abundant genera identified in each experiment accounted for more than 70% of the taxonomically assigned reads in all three experiments. Most of the top 20 most-abundant genera in each experiment (Supplementary Fig. S4) were also categorized as those in the two other experiments, and a total of the top 26 most-abundant genera were used for comparative analysis. Compared with the Illumina metagenomic sequencing data, the 454 amplicon sequencing data led to an underrepresentation of three genera (the genera Subdivision3 and Spartobacteria in the Verrucomicrobia phylum, and the genus Zavarzinella in the Planctomycetes phylum) and two genera (Zavarzinella and OD1 in the OD1 phylum) in the 338F-533R and 342F-806R experiments, respectively. Underrepresentation might have also occurred because the 16S rRNA genes from these genera had sequences with more than two mismatches for the 338F or 342F primer. The 16S rRNA genes in certain genera (e.g. Conexibacter and Zavarzinella) were underrepresented in the 342F-806R or 338F-533R data when compared with the Illumina metagenomic sequencing data, and their underrepresentation could not be explained by the primer mismatches. The formation of (a) specific secondary structure(s) or differences in the accuracies of the taxonomic assignments for the 454 and Illumina reads might have been responsible for the underrepresentation. The Spearman's correlations calculated for the abundance of the 26 genera between each pair of experiments were: 0.37 (Illumina versus 338F-533R), 0.71 (Illumina versus 342F-806R), and 0.60 (338F-533R versus 342F-806R). Comparison at the genus-levels indicated that the taxonomic composition inferred by the 338F-533R amplicon sequencing correlated weakly with that by the Illumina metagenomic sequencing. In contrast, the taxonomic composition by the 342F-806R amplicon sequencing correlated very well with that by the Illumina metagenomic sequencing, indicating that our universal primers can amplify a broad range of taxa with a low bias.Since the Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA gene fragments in the metagenome produced no chimera or bias that is associated with the initial PCR step of amplicon sequencing, the taxonomic composition of the microbial community based on this sequencing method is highly reliable.41 However, the inference of taxonomic composition in a microbial community obtained using the metagenomic 16S rRNA gene fragments requires ultra-deep sequencing since such fragments represent only a very small fraction of the metagenome.42 Indeed, our use of the Illumina GA IIx platform for metagenome sequencing of the soil microbial community gave rise to only thousands of reads as 16S rRNA gene fragments from >10 million total reads. This observation implies that the quantification of relative abundance in a microbial community will be reliable for major taxa but unsuitable for minor taxa. Furthermore, the metagenomic 16S rRNA gene fragments corresponded randomly to a number of different regions within the 16S rRNA genes, indicating the difficulty in conducting a detailed comparison of metagenomic 16S rRNA gene fragments (e.g. construction of a phylogenetic tree). To characterize the taxonomic composition of a microbial community including its minor taxa at low cost, the amplification of 16S rRNA genes using appropriate universal primers is necessary. The taxonomic composition inferred by the 454 amplicon sequencing with our non-degenerate universal primer set correlated well with that obtained by Illumina metagenomic sequencing, indicating that our universal primers can characterize microbial communities without substantial bias and with low possibility to amplify eukaryotic rRNA genes. Although we did not carry out additional experimental validation of our novel and non-degenerate universal primer set by using other environmental samples rich in eukaryotic and mitochondrial rRNA genes, the results in this study indicate that our primer set is highly expected to be applicable to the analysis of many diverse microbial communities.Supplementary DataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Area ‘Genome Science’, Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology in Japan, and a Grant-in-Aid for the Institute for Bioinformatics Research and Development, the Japan Science and Technology Agency (BIRD-JST).We thank Dr T.

Further information on the genomic sequences is available at http://carnation.kazusa.or.jp.1. IntroductionCarnation (Dianthus caryophyllus L.) is one of the major floricultural crops in Japan and worldwide. It is a member of the family Caryophyllaceae and belongs to the genus Dianthus. More than 300 Dianthus species have been recorded.1 Many Dianthus species are distributed throughout Europe and Asia, and the distribution of this genus extends to arctic North America and to mountainous sites in Africa.2 Several species, including D. caryophyllus, D. barbatus, D. chinensis, D. plumarius, D. superbus and their hybrids are widely used as horticultural cultivars.3 Many new carnations have been bred for attractive characteristics such as flower colour, flower size, fragrance and flower longevity.The pigments in carnation flowers are mainly anthocyanin and chalcone derivatives, and most of the genes involved in pigment biosynthesis in carnation have been identified.4 Due to the absence of flavonoid 3',5'-hydroxylase (F3',5'H; a key enzyme in the synthesis of delphinidin) in carnation, blue or violet flowers have never occurred in carnations. The introduction of a petunia or pansy F3',5'H gene into carnation has led to the creation of blue or violet transgenic carnations, which are commercially available.5 The plant pigments of species belonging to the families of Caryophyllales (except for Caryophyllaceae and Molluginaceae) are betalains, which have never been detected with anthocyanins in the same species.6 The carnation, exceptionally bearing anthocyanins in Caryophyllales, is one of the attractive materials to study evolution of genetic systems for pigment synthesis.The vase life of cut flowers, or flower longevity, is one of the most important characteristics to carnation.7 Carnation flowers are highly sensitive to ethylene, which induces autocatalytic ethylene production and wilting in carnation petals.8 Conventional cross-breeding techniques have succeeded in improving the vase life of the carnation flower,9 which is a polygenic trait that is controlled by several genes involved in ethylene production and ethylene sensitivity.9,10To clarify the genetic and physiological mechanisms of agriculturally important traits, and to apply this information to actual breeding, a number of genetic and molecular tools have been developed. Genetic linkage maps of the carnation genome have been constructed and used to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) responsible for resistance to carnation bacterial wilt.11,12 With the aid of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology, large-scale transcriptome analysis (RNA-seq) has been conducted, revealing 300 740 unigenes consisting of 37 844 contigs and 262 896 singletons.13 Recently, we constructed a reference genetic linkage map for carnation using simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers derived from this RNA-seq analysis.14Most carnation cultivars are diploid, with a chromosome number of 2n = 2x = 30.15 The reported nuclear DNA content of carnation is 1.23–1.48 pg/2C, which indicates that the carnation has a comparatively small nuclear genome approximately four times the size of the Arabidopsis thaliana nuclear genome.16 The estimated genome size of carnation (670 Mb)16 is small compared with those of other ornamental flowers, such as Rosa hybrida (1.1 Gb), Antirrhinum majus (1.5 Gb), Petunia hybrida (1.6 Gb), Chrysanthemum morifolium (9.4 Gb) and Tulipa gesneriana (26 Gb), according to the Plant C-values database (http://data.kew.org/cvalues/). To understand the genetic systems of carnation and to accelerate the process of molecular breeding, we performed structural analysis of the whole genome of carnation for the first time in ornamentals. The information and material resources for the carnation genome generated in this study should enhance both fundamental and applied studies of carnations and related plants.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materialsThe carnation cultivars, ‘Francesco’ (for genome sequencing) and ‘Karen Rouge’ (for BAC construction) were grown under natural daylight conditions in a greenhouse in NIFS. ‘Francesco’, a red Mediterranean standard-type cultivar, is the leading cultivar in Japan,17 and ‘Karen Rouge’ is a cultivar with bacterial wilt resistance derived from D. capitatus ssp. andrzejowskianus.182.2. Construction of BAC libraries and BAC DNA sequencingBAC libraries were constructed from nuclear DNA prepared from young leaves of ‘Karen Rouge’. Nuclear DNA was partially digested with HindIII and size-selected, and 100–180 kb DNA was ligated to the BAC vector pIndigoBAC5 (Epicentre Biotechnologies, WI, USA) and introduced into Escherichia coli ElectroMAX DH10B cells (Life Technologies Co., CA, USA) by electroporation.For shotgun sequencing of BAC clones, BAC DNAs prepared according to the standard procedure were fragmented by nebulization, barcoded with a GS Titanium Rapid Library MID Adaptors Kit (Roche Diagnostics, IN, USA), and pooled for sequencing using the GS Titanium platform (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions.2.3. Shotgun sequencing of the carnation genomeWhole-genome shotgun sequencing of the cultivar ‘Francesco’ was performed using both HiSeq 1000 (Illumina Inc., CA, USA) and GS FLX+ (Roche Diagnostics) sequencers. Genomic DNA extracted from leaves was used for library construction according to standard protocols. The libraries included paired-end (PE) (insert size: 500 bp) and overlapping fragment (OF) (insert size: 180 bp) libraries for the HiSeq 1000 sequencer, and single-end (SE) and PE libraries (insert size: 4 kb) for the GS FLX+ system. In addition, two Illumina mate-pair (MP) libraries with 3 and 5 kb inserts, respectively, were constructed with GS Titanium Library Paired End Adaptors (Roche Diagnostics) as previously described.19,20 The sequence data collection is summarized in Supplementary Fig. S1.2.4. Sequence assembly and evaluation of authenticityA method taken for assembly of the genomic sequences of carnation is summarized in Supplementary Fig. S1. Sequence assembly for the BAC DNAs was performed using Newbler ver. 2.7 (Roche Diagnostics). Authenticity of the assembled genomic sequences described above was examined by aligning the sequences of subcontigs contained in the scaffolds of the genomic assemblies with the contig sequences of the BAC clones using the Bowtie 2 program. References for computer programs and databases are listed in Supplementary Table S1.2.5. cDNA sequencesCarnation cDNA sequences generated by Sanger sequencing (accession numbers: FY382825–FY405424)12 and GS FLX+ sequencing (accession numbers: FX296474–FX334317)13 were retrieved from NCBI GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/). In order to generate a non-redundant cDNA data set, redundant cDNA sequences were removed with a CD-HIT tool.2.6. Detection of repetitive sequencesKnown repetitive sequences, including transposable elements (TEs), were detected with the RepeatMasker (http://www.repeatmasker.org) and TransposonPSI (http://transposonpsi.sourceforge.net) programs, and novel repeats were detected with RepeatScout and Piler. To exclude protein-coding genes, the novel repeat library was searched against the SWISS-PROT database (http://www.uniprot.org) with BLASTX. The known and novel repeat sets were merged and redundant repeats were removed.2.7. Assignment of RNA-coding genesGenes for tRNAs were assigned using the tRNAscan-SE program. The rRNA genes were identified based on sequence similarity with those of A. thaliana. Genes for small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) were predicted using snoScan. Micro RNA (miRNA) genes were searched against a miRBase library that contained plant miRNA sequences detected by the MapMi program, which assigns miRNA precursor sequences in genomes by a combination of sequence alignment with Bowtie and prediction of RNA-secondary structures with RNAfold. References for computer programs and databases are listed in Supplementary Table S1.2.8. Assignment of protein-encoding genesTwo programs were used for the assignment of protein-encoding genes in the carnation genome: PASA (http://pasa.sourceforge.net), based on cDNA alignment and Augustus, based on ab initio gene prediction incorporating cDNA alignment information. The protein-encoding genes were first predicted using PASA and then, Augustus was trained with a dataset comprising 300 PASA-predicted genes likely containing complete coding regions. The trained Augustus was implemented with a hint file, which was generated by alignment of the cDNA set to the genome with BLAT. Finally, both the PASA- and Augustus-predicted datasets were merged, and only genes with a single exon predicted in both datasets, not in either one of the two datasets, were selected because the prediction accuracy of genes with a single exon is generally low.To deduce coding regions of the predicted genes, all possible amino acid sequences translated from three reading frames for multiple exon genes and six reading frames for single exon genes were similarity-searched against the Uniprot-Tremble database (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/uniprot/) with BLASTP. Translated amino acid sequences that had a similarity to a protein in the database with E-value = 1E–5, identity = 30% and minimal length = 50 amino acids were selected and defined as the coding regions. When all translated sequences of a gene exhibited no similar proteins, the longest coding region was selected. To confirm the coverage of the assembly and the accuracy of the annotated genes, core eukaryotic genes were mapped using CEGMA. References for computer programs and databases are listed in Supplementary Table S1. The predicted genes related to TEs were excluded for further analyses.2.9. Comparison of metabolic pathwaysFor comparison of the metabolic pathway, Beta vulgaris, A. thaliana and Oryza sativa were chosen. B. vulgaris, which has numerous cultivated root vegetables such as table beet and sugar beet, is a member of the same order Caryophyllales with carnation and has relatively large number of registered genes among this order. Arabidopsis thaliana and O. sativa are typical models of dicot and monocot, respectively. The nucleotide sequences of gene repertoires of A. thaliana and O. sativa were retrieved from the genome databases of TAIR10 and IRGSP 1.0, respectively. For B. vulgaris, expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences were obtained from dbEST of the NCBI databases and trimmed using the CROSS_MATCH program for vector sequences provided in CROSS_MATCH and NCBI's Univec (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/vecscreen/univec/) reads longer than 100 bp were subjected to assembly by PHRED with default parameters. The sequences of genes and unigenes thus obtained, as well as those of the predicted carnation genes, were mapped onto the KEGG reference pathways by BLAST searches against genes in the KEGG database with E-value cutoff of 1E–10, length coverage =25% and identity =50%, and the status of mapping was compared among the four plant species. References for computer programs and databases are listed in Supplementary Table S1.2.10. Functional classification of genesThe predicted gene sequences of carnation were searched against NCBI's Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins (KOG) by BLAST searches with E-value cutoff of 1E-20. In addition, functional domains located in the translated sequences in genes and unigenes were searched against the InterPro databases using InterProScan, and the detected domains were further classified into plant GO slim categories using the map2slim program.3. Results and discussion3.1. Sequencing the carnation genomeShotgun sequencing of the genome of the carnation cv. ‘Francesco’ was carried out using a combination of different sequencing libraries for two NGSs, the HiSeq 1000 and the GS FLX+ systems. In the HiSeq 1000 system, a total of 1277.4 million (M), 1526.5, 442.6 and 475.3 M reads corresponding to 127.7, 152.6, 44.3 and 47.5 Gb sequence data were collected from the PE, OF, 3 kb MP and 5 kb MP libraries, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S1). In parallel, 5.9 M single reads (mean length: 663 bases) and 1.3 M PE reads (mean length: 436 bases) corresponding to 3.9 Gb and 589 Mb sequence data, respectively, were obtained using the GS FLX+ system (Supplementary Fig. S1). The genome size of carnation cv. ‘Francesco’, which was estimated by k-mer analysis21 based on the HiSeq 1000 sequence data, was 622 Mb, which is 93% of the previous estimate (670 Mb)16 this value was adopted for subsequent analyses. Total redundancy of the obtained sequence data (376.6 Gb) was equivalent to ~604-times the estimated genome size.The method used for genomic data assembly is described in the Materials and methods and summarized in Supplementary Fig. S1 and Table S1. The total length of the resulting genomic assemblies was 568.9 Mb, equivalent to 91% of the estimated genome size, containing 69 Mb gaps filled by N; the N50 values of the contigs and scaffolds were 16 644 bp and 60 737 bp, respectively (Table 1). Statistics of D. caryophyllus cv. ‘Francesco’ genome assembliesaContigs or scaffolds shorter than the indicated length were excluded from the statistics.bSubcontigs in scaffolds, which were split by gap regions with length >4 bp.Statistics of D. caryophyllus cv. ‘Francesco’ genome assembliesaContigs or scaffolds shorter than the indicated length were excluded from the statistics.bSubcontigs in scaffolds, which were split by gap regions with length >4 bp.The N50 value of the final scaffolds was relatively low, probably due to the heterozygotic nature (~0.2% heterozygosity estimated in this study; data not shown) of the carnation genome. Because current methods for de novo assembly using de Bruijn graphs split assemblies at heterologous polymorphic sites, assemblies of heterozygous diploid genomes tend to be fragmented. However, the N50 value of the contigs contained in the scaffolds was 16.6 kb (Table 1), which allowed reliable characterization and gene annotations. Mapping of 248 core eukaryotic genes by the CEGMA program indicated that 96% of the core genes were completely covered in the genome assemblies. Comparison of the independently determined sequences of the two BAC clones with the assembled genomic sequences showed perfect alignment with correct order and coverage, demonstrating that the coverage and quality of the assembled genomic sequences were high.We constructed an SSR-based reference genetic linkage map of the carnation genome comprising 412 SSR loci on a total length of 969.6 cM.14 To correlate the genomic sequences obtained in this study to their positions on this linkage map, we searched the assembled genomic sequences for sequences of these markers and their adjacent regions using the BLASTN program. All primer sequences, sequences of the flanking regions and SSR motifs were successfully mapped to the assembled genomic sequences, although there were single base substitutions or small deletions of several bases long. Single corresponding scaffolds could be identified for 378 (91.7%) of the 412 SSR loci (Supplementary Table S2), and the remaining SSR loci were assigned to multiple scaffolds containing identical or highly similar sequences. Consequently, 268 scaffolds could be located on the genetic linkage map. Some of the scaffolds covered multiple marker loci, e.g. scaffold6 on LG 85P_5, with six SSR loci. The longest mapped scaffold was scaffold2 on LG 85P_9, which covered 1.2 Mb regions and three marker loci. The total length of the mapped scaffolds was 51.4 Mb, equivalent to 8.3% of the estimated genome size.3.2. Characteristic features of the carnation genomeThe repetitive sequences found in the assembled genomic sequences comprised 112 078 known TEs, 354 221 simple repeats and low complexity sequences, and 331 831 novel repeats defined by de novo repeat finding, the sum of which correspond to 33% of the assembled genomic sequences (Table 2). Comparison of the TE contents of the carnation genome with those of other plant species, such as A. thaliana, Brassica rapa, potato, tomato, cotton, soybean, sweet orange, rice, foxtail millet and sorghum (Supplementary Table S3), showed that the relative content of known TEs was lower than those of unclassified repeats, and simple repeats appeared to be higher in carnation. The lower content of TEs in the assembled genomic sequences in carnation may be attributed to the escape of TE sequences during the process of sequence assembly, since the carnation assemblies in this study were highly fragmented at the positions of potential repetitive sequences.

The CACTA element (En/Spm), dTac1 was first identified in a gene for glutathione-S-transferase, here designated Tac101, which is not likely to encode notable proteins for transposases.24 A similarity search against the ‘Francesco’ genomic sequences detected four types of CACTA elements, designated Tac201, Tac301, Tac401 and Tac501, in addition to Tac101 (Supplementary Table S4 and Fig. S3). None of these is likely to encode intact transposases that are active for transposition.The genome of ‘Francesco’ contains an acyl-glucose-dependent anthocyanin 5-glucosyltransferase (AA5GT) gene with an insertion by Ty1-1 (Ty1dic1), resulting in synthesis and accumulation of pelargonidin 3-O-malylglucoside that lacks its glucose moiety at the 5 positions. Ty1-1 in the ‘Francesco’ genome has one nucleotide substitution in the coding region of the transposase gene to generate a stop codon different from Ty1dic1. Similarity searching of the assembled genomic sequences indicated that there were six genes for Ty1-1 longer than 1 kb (Supplementary Table S4 andFig. S4).Thirteen genes for rRNAs and 1050 intact genes for tRNAs were identified in the assembled genomic sequences. Comparison of the number of genes for tRNAs in the genomes of 16 plant species indicated that the carnation genome contains many more genes than other plant species (Supplementary Table S5). A total of 92 and 143 genes for snoRNA and miRNA, respectively, were also assigned.We assigned protein-encoding genes in the carnation genome using two types of computer programs, PASA and Augustus. As a result, 10 519 protein-encoding genes predicted by PASA and 99 123 genes predicted by Augustus were merged, resulting in assignment of 56 137 protein-encoding genes including those in TEs (Supplementary Table S6).A similarity search against the Uniprot-Tremble database indicated that the translated amino acid sequences of the 42 047 predicted protein-encoding genes showed significant sequence similarity to the registered genes, and 12 871 were similar to TEs. Consequently, 43 266 protein-encoding genes excluding those TEs were assigned in the assembled genomic sequences, ~72% of which showed sequence similarity to registered genes (Supplementary Table S6). It is possible that the gene number was overestimated due to fragmentation of the assembled sequences and the heterozygotic nature of the genome.To estimate the gene coverage of the assembled genomic sequences and the accuracy of our gene prediction, we mapped core eukaryotic genes onto the assembled genomic sequences. Of the 248 core eukaryotic genes, 238 (96%) matched the entire coding regions, which increased to 242 (98%) if partial matches were included.3.3. Comparison of carnation gene repertoire with those of other plant speciesTo compare metabolic pathway genes, we examined the genes of B. vulgaris, A. thaliana and O. sativa. Since the genomic sequences of B. vulgaris are not yet available, 29 830 EST sequences of B. vulgaris retrieved from dbEST were assembled into 14 058 unigenes consisting of 5810 contigs and 8248 singletons (total size: 9 781 432 bp) and used for comparison. For A. thaliana and O. sativa, the complete gene sets, 35 386 and 42 136 genes, respectively, were retrieved from the TAIR10 and IRGSP 1.0 databases, respectively.The translated amino acid sequences of 43 491 coding sequences (CDSs) including splicing variants in carnation were searched against the unigenes of B. vulgaris and the complete gene sets of A. thaliana (TAIR10) and O. sativa (IGRSP 1.0) using BLAST with E-value cutoff of 1E–10. The distributions of the percentage of amino acid sequence identities are listed in Supplementary Fig. S5. The degree of similarity was in order B. vulgaris, A. thaliana and O. sativa, which is consistent with their phylogenetic relationship.The unigenes of B. vulgaris and the genes of A. thaliana (TAIR10) and O. sativa (IRGSP 1.0) were classified into KOG categories (Fig. 1). The number of unigenes classified into KOG was 6937 (49.3%) in B. vulgaris, and the number of genes classified into KOG was 19 005 (43.7%), 18 250 (51.6%), and 18 065 (42.9%) in carnation, A. thaliana, and O. sativa, respectively. The ratio of the genes in KOG Q (Secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport and catabolism) was relatively high in carnation. For classification of the genes based on GO slim, on the other hand, the number of unigenes classified into GO category was 5676 (40.4%) in B. vulgaris, and that of genes classified into GO category was 16 423 (37.8%), 21 875 (61.8%) and 20 203 (47.9%) in carnation, A. thaliana and O. sativa, respectively. This result indicated that the genes in the categories ‘nucleobase, nucleoside, nucleotide and nucleic acid metabolic process (Biological Process: BP)’, ‘cell wall (Cellular Component: CC)’ and ‘transferase activity (Molecular Function: MF)’ were relatively high in carnation (Supplementary Fig. S6). Gene assignment to KOG functional categories.Gene assignment to KOG functional categories.The unigenes of B. vulgaris and the complete gene sets comprising 35 386 and 42 136 genes of A. thaliana (TAIR10) and O. sativa (IGRSP 1.0), respectively, were mapped onto KEGG reference pathways. As a result, 11 030 of 43 491 translated amino acid sequences of CDSs in carnation, 13 979 of 14 058 unigenes in B. vulgaris, 13 154 of 35 386 genes in A. thaliana (TAIR10) and 12 082 of 42 136 in O. sativa (IGRSP 1.0) were successfully mapped onto the KEGG reference pathways (Supplementary Table S7). The pathways including the genes mapped only in carnation are as follows: ‘Pentose phosphate pathway’, ‘Galactose metabolism’, ‘Ether lipid metabolism’, ‘Alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism’, ‘Glycine, serine and threonine metabolism’, ‘Cysteine and methionine metabolism’, ‘Metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450’ and several others.3.4. Genes characteristic of carnationThe phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway that begins with phenylalanine and results in the production of anthocyanin, flavonoid and lignin is one of the most well-studied secondary metabolic pathways (Supplementary Fig. S7). Similarity searches and phylogenetic analyses25 for genes known to be involved in the synthesis of phenylpropanoid, flavonoid and lignin against the assembled genomic sequences of carnation was performed, and the results are summarized in Supplementary Table S8.Similarity searches detected a single possible flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase (F3'H) homologue among 241 genes homologous to cytochrome P450 in the genome of carnation cv. ‘Francesco’. The F3'H gene in cv. ‘Mrs. Purple’ is known to code for an active protein of 514 amino acid residues.4 By contrast, the F3'H homologue in cv. ‘Francesco’ contains one extra guanidine nucleotide in the potential coding region, resulting in the production of a truncated 193 amino acid peptide.In addition, a total of 84, 25, 120, 93 and 139 putative homologues of glutathione S-transferases, multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE)-type transporter, UDP-sugar dependent glycosyltransferase, Myb transcription factors and bHLH transcription factors, which are known to be involved in the phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway, were assigned in the assembled genomic sequences. Details of these genes as well as the results of phylogenetic analysis are shown in Supplementary Figs S8–S12.Betalains are commonly synthesized instead of anthocyanin in the order Caryophyllales, except for two families, Caryophyllaceae and Molluginaceae. Although carnation is classified under the family Caryophillaceae and produces anthocyanin as the main plant pigment in petals, and often in other organs, carnation may also contain the genes required to produce betalains. Three characteristic enzymes are involved in synthesis of betalains, i.e. l-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) 4,5-dioxygenase (DOD),6,26 cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (CYP76AD)27 and cyclo-DOPA glucosyltransferase (cD5GT), in the UDP-dependent glycosyltransferase (UGT) family.28,29One copy of a DOD homologue (Dca8668) was found in the carnation genomic sequences by similarity searching. Multiple alignments revealed that the amino acid sequence of the carnation DOD homologue contains the conserved motif typical of non-betalain-producing plants (Supplementary Fig. S13). This result suggests that the carnation DOD homologue does not catalyze the formation of betalamic acid.CYP76AD belongs to the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (CYP) family, which is one of the most divergent families in higher plants,27 with 241 homologues of CYP detected in the carnation genomic sequences. Dca32662 showed the highest amino acid identity (66.4%) with that of B. vulgaris CTP76AD1. However, the fact that this protein belongs to CYP76C implied that carnation genome does not encode betalain-related CYP family protein. A single homologue of Mirabilis jalapa cD5GT (MjcD5GT) gene was found. The deduced amino acid sequence of this UGT homolog showed 58.4% identity to MjcD5GT and 62.5% to Celosia cristata cD5GT.Similarity searches against the assembled genomic sequences in carnation identified all of the genes involved in the chlorophyll metabolic pathway in the carnation genome (Supplementary Table S9). We found multiple genes encoding putative isozymes, including glutamate-1-semialdehyde 2,1-aminotransferase (GSA), 5-aminolevulinate dehydrogenase (HEMB), porphobilinogen deaminase (HEMC), uroporphyrinogen III decarboxylase (HEME), magnesium chelatase D subunit (CHLD), Mg-protoporphyrin IX methyltransferase (CHLM), Mg-protoporphyrin IX monomethylester cyclase (CRD), protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (PORA) and divinyl chlorophyllide a 8-vinyl reductase (DVR), which are involved in chlorophyll synthesis in carnation. By contrast, all of the enzymes involved in the chlorophyll cycle and chlorophyll degradation are likely to be encoded by a single gene. STAY-GREEN (SGR), a protein involved in senescence-related chlorophyll degradation, is encoded by three genes.Similarity searches revealed that most of the enzymes involved in carotenoid biosynthesis are encoded by single genes in the carnation genome (Supplementary Table S10). In addition, two homologues of 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED) genes involved in abscisic acid biosynthesis in A. thaliana,30 two homologs of carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase (CCD4) genes as well as single homologues each of CCD1, CCD7 and CCD8, genes related to different enzyme activities and substrate specificities,30 were assigned (Supplementary Fig. S14). No ESTs encoding CCDs were found in the carnation EST dataset (Supplementary Table S10),13,31 suggesting that their expression levels are low.We searched for nucleotide-binding site-leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) genes in the assembled genomic sequences of carnation and assigned 217 NBS-containing potential Resistance (R) genes (Supplementary Table S11). The number of NBS-LRR genes in carnation is larger than that of cucumber,32 melon33 and papaya,34 but smaller than that of tomato,35 grape36 and rice.37 In this study, only three potential genes with Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domains at the N-terminal were identified, two of which lack LRRs, while 69 genes containing a coiled-coil motif were assigned, 52 of which lack LRRs. This result is consistent with the previous observation that the genome of B. vulgaris lacks TIR-type resistance genes despite the fact that this plant is a dicot.38 Our present results support the assumption that the loss of TIR-type resistance genes is not restricted to cereals or monocots in general,38 indicating the unique feature of R gene evolution in Caryophyllales. It should also be noted that more than 50% of the 114 NBS-containing genes lack N- and C-terminal domains (Supplementary Table S11), with 30 genes (NL) possessing only NBS-LRR domains.The 217 potential NBS-type R genes predicted in this study were assigned to 125 scaffolds. Of the 125 scaffolds, 87 contain single NBS genes, while the other scaffolds contain multiple NBS genes. The positions of eight scaffolds containing five or more NBS genes are shown in Supplementary Fig. S15. Approximately 30% of the NBS-type R genes are clustered in these scaffolds, and the scaffold most abundant in NBS-type R genes is No.146, which contains 11 genes. These results suggest that R genes are unevenly distributed in the carnation genome, as was reported for a wide range of plants.33–35,37Carnation has been used as a model system to study the mechanism of ethylene-induced flower senescence.10 Components of the ethylene signal transduction pathway, such as the ethylene receptors, Constitutive Triple Response (CTR), Ethylene-Insensitive 2 (EIN2) and EIN3, regulate a series of senescence-related genes.10 By searching the carnation genomic sequences, six putative genes for ethylene receptors (DcETR1, DcETR2, DcETR3, DcETR4, DcERS1 and DcERS2), two genes for CTR, two genes for EIN2 and three EIN3-like genes were identified (Supplementary Table S12). Phylogenetic analysis classified six ethylene receptors in carnation into two subfamilies; DcETR1, DcERS1 and DcERS2 are in Subfamily 1, which contains conserved histidine kinase domains, and DcETR2, DcETR3 and DcETR4 are in Subfamily 2 (Supplementary Fig. S16).With respect to ethylene biosynthesis, three 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) synthase genes (DcACS1, DcACS2 and DcACS3) and one ACC oxidase gene (DcACO1) have been identified.39 Based on sequence similarity, we found six more genes for ACS (DcACS4 –DcACS9) and four more genes for ACO (DcACO2–DcACO5; Supplementary Table S12). Notably, the putative gene products of DcACS4, DcACS5 and DcACS6 lack the motifs BOX6 and BOX7, BOX1 and BOX2, and BOX6, respectively, while those of other ACSs contain all seven conserved BOXs found in ACS isozymes in A. thaliana.40 Since only eight out of 12 ACS genes are catalytically active in A. thaliana,40 it is probable that all of the ACS identified in the carnation genome do not encode active ACS for synthesizing ethylene.Large amounts of soluble carbohydrate are required for flower opening as substrates for respiration and cell wall synthesis. Accumulation of substantial amounts of pinitol, one of the rare sugars potentially involved in salinity tolerance, is a unique aspect of sugar metabolism during flower opening in carnation.41 One gene (Dca24344) showing strong homology to known genes encoding myo-inositol methyl transferase (IMT), which catalyzes the conversion of myo-inositol to pinitol, was found in the carnation genome.Xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase (XTH), which is involved in the hydrolysis and reconstruction of xyloglucan in the matrix polysaccharides of the cell wall,42 is believed to play an essential role in increasing cell wall extensibility followed by water uptake during the process of petal cell expansion.43 Genome-wide analysis has revealed 33 and 29 genes in the XTH family in A. thaliana44 and O. sativa,45 respectively. In the carnation genomic sequences, 32 genes putatively encoding XTH were detected (Supplementary Table S13 andFigs. S17, S18), 11 of which were reported to be expressed in flowers and in some vegetative tissues.13,46Floral scent is a notable breeding target for carnation.47 Methylation by S-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent methyltransferases belonging to SABATH family,48 is an important catalytic process for emission of scent components from flowers. Methyl benzoate that is a major scent component of modern carnation cultivars,47 is also derived from the methylation of benzoic acid. A similarity search against the carnation genomic sequences detected 11 genes in the SABATH family (DcSABATH1-11), which are candidate genes of benzoic acid methyltransferase in carnation (Supplementary Table S14). Phylogenetic analysis of functionally characterized members of SABATH family showed that benzoic acid and salicylic acid methyltransferase form a monophyletic lineage irrespective of plant species (Supplementary Fig. S19).49 In contrast, DcSABATHs, SABATH members in carnation, did not strongly associate with this lineage.3.5.

IntroductionThe use of genomic data generated by so-called ‘next generation sequencing’ (NGS) has become commonplace in many fields of biological research, with sequencing-by-synthesis from Illumina currently the most popular. A standard Illumina paired-end (PE) library is made from DNA templates of about 500 bp in length, and a sequencing run can generate billions of paired reads of length 37–250 bp from either ends of these fragments.1 Reads from longer fragments of DNA can also be produced to aid the deconvolution of repetitive regions and for identifying large structural variations in genomes. A specialized mate-pair (MP) library, constructed by introducing a circularization step at the start of the library preparation, allows end sequencing from fragments of at least 2 kb.2–4 This powerful technology can be applied to address a wide range of biological questions, such as variant calling and resolving haplotypes between individuals of a population or de novo assembly of complex genomes.Advancement in library preparation also permits their creation from just a few nanograms of DNA.5 Nevertheless, obtaining even nanograms of starting material can be challenging in certain applications. One solution is to pool many samples to obtain sufficient DNA to construct one library. However, this approach is often not applicable to rare clinical or archived samples,6 and increases the complexity of downstream analysis. Within an assembly of pooled DNA samples, it can be particularly challenging to distinguish variants of a sequence that is repeated in the genome of one individual from allelic differences between multiple individuals. This problem increases with the levels of intraspecies variation, for instance, C. brenneri has 14.1% of polymorphic synonymous sites between individuals, comparable with hyperdiverse bacteria.7 A potential solution is to use whole-genome amplification (WGA) techniques to reduce the amount of DNA required to make a sequencing library. Several WGA protocols have been proposed8 and can be divided into those based on polymerase change reaction (PCR) or those involving multiple strand displacement amplification (MDA). PCR-based techniques such as degenerate oligonucleotide primed PCR9 and primer extension PCR10 can produce non-specific amplification artefacts and typically short-amplification products.11 MDA uses the strand-displacing DNA polymerase from Phi29 bacteriophage and has several advantages over PCR-based protocols. For example, MDA can generate long-amplified fragments up to 100 kb, which are of feasible size to serve as templates from which MP libraries can be synthesized.8 An alternative method of amplification called pWGA (primase-based WGA)12 is based on in vitro reconstruction of the naturally existing cellular DNA replication machinery found in bacteriophage T7, and comparable performance with MDA in terms of efficiency and unbiased amplification has been reported.12 WGA techniques have already been regularly used in genotyping bacteria,13 other small organisms14 and human cells.15 Though still in its infancy, sequencing from single cells is now feasible using WGA and this opens up a new field of exploring heterogeneity within populations, or populations of cells in an organism or tissue, an ultimate goal for many geneticists and molecular biologists.Despite the advances in WGA methods, preferential amplification of certain DNA fragments still exists,16 resulting in uneven sequencing between different parts of a given genome and chimera formation.17 In this article we describe the effect of amplifying nanograms of genomic DNA, which is usually the available starting material of a de novo small eukaryote genome project, with three different protocols before constructing Illumina short- and long-insert libraries. Using the high quality genome sequence of C. elegans as a reference, we show that GC content and composition of inverted and tandem repeats play a major role in the variation of read coverage. We demonstrate that reads sequenced from amplified DNA can generate de novo assemblies that are of comparable quality with those from unamplified DNA. In addition, we have also examined capillary reads from libraries cloned from amplified high molecular weight DNA of the potato cyst nematode Globodera pallida genome project. As the research focus is turning to more unexplored organisms and single cells, WGA protocols will become the standard method of choice. Understanding the caveats and biases generated with these protocols is a paramount requirement for interpretation of results.2. Materials and methods2.1. Whole-genome amplificationGenomic DNA was extracted from ~10 000 C. elegans N2 nematodes using Genomic tip G20 (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Ten nanograms of template DNA was used in each of three WGA reactions using: (i) GenomiPhi v2 (GE life science), hereafter termed Phi; (ii) Phi29 MDA plus trehalose, hereafter termed Tre; and (iii) Rapisome (BioHelix), hereafter termed Rap. The Phi WGA reactions were carried out in the 20 µl reaction mixture at 30°C for 90 min followed by heat denaturation at 95°C for 3 min according to the manufacturer's instructions. For Rap, DNA was mixed directly with the 25 µl reaction mixture and incubated at 37°C for 60 min according to the manufacturer's instructions. For Tre, Phi29 polymerase (Qiagen), 0.7 M trehalose and 16 h reaction time were used according to the method described in Pan et al.18 Amplified products were purified using a QIAAmp DNA mini kit (Qiagen) and DNA concentrations were measured using Qubit (Life technologies).2.2. Illumina library construction and sequencingOne microgram of DNA was used to construct standard 450 bp libraries using a TruSeq DNA Sample Preparation Kit with the standard protocol (Illumina), after fragmentation on the Covaris, 3 kb mate-pair libraries were constructed following the protocol described in Park et al.19 with the following exceptions. Size selection was carried out with Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) in a buffer of 5% PEG and 0.95 M NaCl, aiming to remove most fragments of length <1.5 kb. Nick translation was carried out for 11 min (libraries in Replicate 1) or 14 min (libraries in Replicate 2). Libraries were sequenced using the TruSeq SBS Kit v3-HS kit according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol (https://icom.illumina.com/) in either Illumina MiSeq 150 cycles (for 3 kb MP libraries in Replicate 2) or the Illumina HiSeq 100 cycles (for all other libraries). In situ, the linearization, blocking and hybridization step was repeated to regenerate clusters, release the second strand for sequencing and to hybridize the R2 sequencing primer followed by another 100 or 150 cycles of sequencing to produce PE reads.2.3. Data analysisReads were trimmed based on base quality (an average phred score of 15 for every four bases) and the presence of adaptor sequences. For 450 bp fragment short-insert libraries Trimmomatic20 was used with options: ‘ILLUMINACLIP 2:40:15 LEADING:3 TRAILING:3 SLIDINGWINDOW:4:15 MINLEN:36’. For 3 kb fragment long-insert libraries an in-house developed algorithm was used to trim biotin adaptor sequence which may present at either ends of the long-insert fragments (Supplementary Fig. S1). Three to 15% of reads were removed in short- and long-insert libraries, respectively, before undertaking the alignment stage (Supplementary Table S1).Illumina reads were aligned to the C. elegans reference genome (WS236 from Wormbase ftp://ftp.wormbase.org/) using SMALT (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/software/smalt/). Repetitive mappings were allowed, and only alignments with at least 80% or 50% of the sequence read aligned to reference were considered in the short- and long-insert libraries, respectively. Additionally, a maximum of 600 bp and 100 000 bp insert size were considered for paired mappings in the short- and long-insert libraries, respectively. Duplicates were called using GATK.21 SNPs were called using Varscan222 with options ‘-min-coverage 5—strand-filter 1’ using alignment files (in the form of bam format) as the input on each of the short-insert replicates. Tandem and inverted repeat content of the C. elegans genome was calculated using program trf23 and irf24 with default parameters, respectively. GC content and repeat content analyses for 10 kb windows in the C. elegans genome was calculated using a combination of BEDTools25 and custom Perl and R26 scripts. Capillary reads from the G. pallida genome project were first trimmed to increase bases having at least phred quality score of 40 and the vector contamination was removed. The resulting subset of reads was mapped against the G. pallida v1 assembly (ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/pathogens/Globodera/pallida/) using SSAHA2.27Assemblies were constructed from short-insert libraries using SGA v.0.10.928 with authors' recommended parameters (https://github.com/jts/sga/blob/master/src/examples/sga-celegans.sh). Scaffolding was performed using SSPACE basic version 2.029 with default settings, with library sizes set to the median insert values as shown in Table 1 with a standard deviation of 0.5. These assemblies were then compared with the C. elegans genome (WS236) using GAGE.30 Because of the differences in number of reads between replicates, we only presented Replicate 1, which has more sequencing depth (Table 4). A separate Supplementary Table S2 summarizes assemblies where every library is normalized to the library with least number of reads.

Results3.1. Genome amplificationCaenorhabditis elegans genomic DNA was amplified using three different protocols that utilized Phi29 polymerase alone (Phi); Phi29 polymerase supplemented with trehalose (Tre), which reportedly produces a more homogenous and unbiased amplification18; and Rapisome (Rap)—a commercially available version of pWGA, which does not utilize random primers and initial template denaturation that are possible factors in chimera formation in MDA reactions. After amplification, we observed DNA fragments of length>10 kb resulting from all amplification methods. The average yield of amplified DNA from 10 ng template DNA was 46 ng/µl of reaction mixture (Phi), 31 ng/µl (Rap) and 95 ng/µl (Tre). These fragments were further fragmented and size selected to generate Illumina libraries (Supplementary Fig. S1).3.2. Illumina read qualityA total of ~495 million of both standard 450 bp PE (short-insert libraries) and 3 kb MP (long-insert libraries) Illumina reads were generated from amplified C. elegans genomic DNA fragments. Two technical replicates were generated from each amplification protocol and unamplified DNA. The availability of a high quality C. elegans reference genome allowed the quality of the libraries to be assessed by checking various mapping metrics such as number of reads mapped, orientation of mates in a pair. In all cases, at least 82% of the reads were aligned to the reference genome (Table 1) and the insert size distribution, i.e. the distance between two mates of a read pair (including themselves) mapped to the genome in the correct orientation, was close to our expectation for selecting desired size fragments (Supplementary Fig. S2).Various errors can occur at different stages of Illumina library preparation (Supplementary Fig. S1). In both short- and long-insert library construction, duplicates can arise during PCR amplification, resulting in perfect copies of the original DNA templates being sequenced many times.31 Of the mapped reads in short-insert libraries, the number of PCR duplicates was ~1%, except in Rap libraries, where Replicate 1 had 2.8% duplicates and Replicate 2 had 35.7% duplicates suggesting that the starting amplified products had lower molecular sizes with only a fraction of DNA desirable as DNA templates. We therefore considered Replicate 2 as a ‘failed’ library and excluded it from subsequent analysis. The number of PCR duplicates in long-insert libraries was consistently higher than in short-insert libraries, as observed by others.4 The number of PCR duplicates also appeared to be affected by individual runs; a consistently fewer duplicates were observed in the second replicate. Again, we found that PCR duplicates in Rap amplified long-insert libraries were high in both replicates.Problematic reads can arise from several stages of long-insert library construction. First, fragments can be produced from circularized templates where nick translation has occurred in a segment that does not contain a biotinylated adaptor (Supplementary Fig. S1) presumably the selection stages are sometimes ineffective. We found out that 0.5–4.8% of such reads present in long-insert libraries and they appear to be higher in Replicate 2 and not influenced by WGA protocols (Table 2). Second, templates can still be circularized if size selection is not efficient (Supplementary Fig. S1). Paired reads sequenced from these fragments should have short-insert sizes and be aligned in the correct (outward-facing in long-insert libraries) orientation. We found these reads to be present at much higher frequency in Replicate 2 which were sequenced as a batch (Supplementary Fig. S2).

In the case of long-insert libraries, chimera formation is one of the causes of the formation of these reads.One of the main concerns in using amplification methods is their tendency to form chimeric DNA fragments, which seems to arise from a mechanism involving priming from displaced 3' termini.17 Based on this mechanism, the majority of chimeric DNA fragments will be sequences where a segment, which is partially deleted, illustrated by Segments a and b in Fig. 1A, joins to another Sequence c from the same chromosome which is inverted. Thus we could measure the tendency of amplified libraries forming chimeras by counting the number of read pairs that were mapped with both mates in the wrong orientation (i.e. forward–forward or reverse–reverse). All amplified libraries show an increased proportion of reads in the wrong orientation when compared with the unamplified counterparts (Table 2). This pattern is more prevalent in long-insert reads, where long-insert libraries prepared using Phi and Tre show 10–12.9% of reads with the wrong orientation compared with 0.55–4.1% in short-insert libraries. The majority of these reads are evenly distributed across the chromosomes in all amplified samples (Supplementary Fig. S3), suggesting that wrongly amplified fragments occur infrequently and randomly. As mentioned before, another characteristic of the chimeras is that part of the sequence will be deleted, and as a result the two segments where they map in the genome will appear to have been brought closer together as a consequence of the deletion (Fig. 1B). Hence, when insert size is calculated based on the mapping positions, we expect to see a much broader insert size distribution than of non-chimeric reads. Indeed, this is what we observed in all WGA long-insert libraries (Replicate 1 of Phi shown in Fig. 1C and rest in Supplementary Fig. S4) with distances between mates mapped in wrong orientation sometimes even >10 kb. By further looking at sequence reads that can be uniquely mapped into two different positions on the same chromosome, we found two cases that confirm the presence of chimeras in Phi and Tre amplified fragments (Supplementary Fig. S5). (A, B and D) Types of chimeric rearrangements. Each DNA sequence is represented by two or three adjacent segments. Arrows indicate directions of amplified fragments relative to the DNA sequence.

(A) and (B) Segment a is copied, b is deleted and c is copied and reverse complemented. (D) The first part of the sequence is copied twice, with unknown sequence placed between the two copies. (C) Insert size distribution plot of wrong-orientation reads in Phi amplified libraries.To our surprise, the insert size distribution of these chimeric reads all peaked close to 0 bp (Fig. 1C, Supplementary Fig. S4), suggesting that both mates in read pairs were overlapped or placed very close to each other. This observation cannot be solely explained by the priming mechanism where two different sequences on the chromosome were joined, and can only be explained if the same sequence is present on both ends of the sequenced fragment with one version inverted (Fig. 1D). To investigate this phenomenon further, we looked at Sanger sequence data that were produced from potato cyst nematode (Globodera pallida) genomic DNA, amplified using Genomiphi (Phi) and cloned into plasmid or fosmid vectors. Various insert sizes, from 2 kb to 40 kb (fosmid) were sequenced from either end with read lengths of 200–600 bp. Indeed, we also found that the majority of mates of wrongly oriented reads overlapped with each other, concurring that the same region was sequenced twice with one version inverted. Interestingly, we found that the fraction of wrongly oriented reads was correlated with fragment size, and in extreme cases 85% of MPs derived from fosmids mapped in the wrong orientation and overlapped each other (Supplementary Fig. S6).3.3. Uniform read coverage across the genomeOne of the most important criteria for accurate variant calling and assemblies from Illumina reads is an even coverage of sequence data genome-wide. We first evaluated the variability in the depth of coverage of short-insert reads32 by plotting the cumulative fraction of normalized depth of correctly paired read coverage that covers a given cumulative fraction of genome (Fig. 2). Normalization of read coverage depth allows libraries of different coverage depths to be compared with each other. The theoretical line (Fig. 2) indicates a perfectly uniform distribution of reads where 100% of the genome is covered by reads with a normalized and consistent depth of 1. Figure 2 shows that both replicates of the unamplified short-insert library have the closest fit to the theoretical line, suggesting the most uniform distribution of reads. The remaining samples show some level of deviation, suggesting non-uniform distribution across the genome. Distribution plots of the long-insert libraries show more deviation away from the theoretical distribution than short-insert libraries. This effect is more evident in the lower tail of the distribution, indicating a greater proportion of the genome has lower coverage. By inspecting regions of lower coverage across all libraries, the most evident patterns are regions enriched in G homopolymers tracts and GGC motifs33 (Supplementary Fig. S7). A plot of genome coverage against normalised average depth. Deviation from the theoretical curve (red) indicates less evenness in coverage depth distribution across the genome. Different protocols are plotted with different colours as listed in the legend, and dashed lines indicate read coverage from Replicate 1 of the long-insert libraries.A plot of genome coverage against normalised average depth. Deviation from the theoretical curve (red) indicates less evenness in coverage depth distribution across the genome. Different protocols are plotted with different colours as listed in the legend, and dashed lines indicate read coverage from Replicate 1 of the long-insert libraries.Next, we grouped the Illumina short-insert read coverage at each base into 10 kb non-overlapping windows across the C. elegans genome. Using Chromosome I as an example, plotting the median coverage of bases in each window immediately revealed the difference in coverage between libraries (Fig. 3). Some differences exist, but two technical replicates in each library show remarkably similar patterns with each other. Libraries with unamplified DNA show more uniform coverage across Chromosome I compared with amplified libraries. Interestingly, we observed that read coverage only seems to be more even towards the middle of Chromosome I in all WGA protocols, but is even throughout in Chromosome X (Supplementary Fig. S8). The unevenness in coverage of data from Illumina short-insert libraries at C. elegans autosome arms mirrors the distribution of inverted and tandem repetitive sequences, which also cluster more frequently at the autosome arms34 (Supplementary Fig. S9). To investigate this phenomenon, we re-annotated the tandem and inverted repeat contents of C. elegans genome and compared them with read coverage in 10 kb windows. Strikingly, we found that both tandem and inverted repeat content are significantly correlated with read coverage across all samples including unamplified libraries (P < 0.001, Spearman's test). Read coverage in libraries treated with Phi and Tre decrease with increasing content of tandem and inverted repeats (Fig. 4A and B). Libraries created with Rap also show an inverse relationship between read coverage and tandem repeat content, but positively correlated with inverted repeat content, which explains contrasting patterns of coverage on autosome arms against Phi and Tre.

Short-insert libraries prepared under all protocols showed a good fit to the theoretical distribution (Fig. 5A); however, we see a strong positive bias towards higher GC in all long-insert libraries (Fig. 5B). To characterize this observation further, we obtained the normalized coverage difference between short- and long-insert libraries in 10 kb windows and correlated with the GC content of the window. Compared with short-insert libraries, the majority of long-insert libraries show more amplification generated from higher extremes of GC regions and less amplification from lower extremes of GC regions (Supplementary Fig. S10).

Application 1: variant callings in WGA librariesTo investigate the effect on variant calling caused by the decreased uniformity in amplified libraries, SNPs were called using Varscan222 on each of the short-insert replicates. Since the same starting material was used for all samples, and considering the technical variations between different sequencing runs, we first inferred 643 homozygous and 2117 heterozygous SNPs that were called in both non-amplified replicates. Only one replicate of the Rap amplification was analysed, which therefore showed the least robust SNP calling accuracy. For samples amplified with either Phi or Tre, we found ~80% homozygous SNP calls were also called in at least one replicate (Table 3A). The majority of miss calls in libraries prepared using these two protocols from sites with a coverage depth =2, consistent with the expectation that some regions of the genome failed to amplify during the process. The effect of non-uniform read coverage of amplified libraries is further reflected in their heterozygous calls, where only 61–65% of SNPs from the non-amplified library were also called in at least one of the replicates from the two amplification protocols. An exhaustive investigation of the miss-called SNPs revealed that most of the missed heterozygotes were incorrectly called as homozygous (Table 3B).

Application 2: assembly generated by WGA prepared librariesIn order to evaluate the effect that different WGA protocols may have in generating a genome assembly, we used the SGA assembler28 to assemble reads from each of the libraries. These assemblies were then assessed using GAGE30 and summarized in Table 4. We only presented Replicate 1 for this analysis because of the much lower coverage in Replicate 2 observed in all libraries, with the smaller numbers of reads producing significantly worse assemblies (Supplementary Table S2). Having a genome reference allowed us to compute corrected N50 where contigs were broken at miss-assembled regions prior to the calculation of N50. The first observation is that the Rap amplified libraries produce the worst assembly, and as expected the most contiguous and accurate assembly is produced from unamplified library. The second observation is that the assemblies produced from Phi and Tre amplified libraries are almost identical to unamplified libraries, with only an additional 0–4.3% of the assembly missing compared with the reference and similar corrected N50 values. The variation in assembly quality between replicates was greater than between non-amplified and amplified libraries prepared by following either Phi or Tre protocols (Supplementary Table S2). Summary statistics of assembly and scaffolding data from different librariesSummary statistics of assembly and scaffolding data from different librariesTo assess the effect of the uneven sequencing coverage and the presence of erroneous orientation in the long-insert libraries, we ran the SSPACE29 scaffolder on the best assembly (non-amplified Replicate 1) using reads from each long-insert library. We only used Replicate 1 for this analysis because of the much lower coverage in Replicate 2 observed in all samples. A total of 10 additional miss-assemblies were identified by GAGE after scaffolding with the unamplified long-insert library (Table 4) and, comparably, the Phi amplified library created the same number of miss-assemblies but actually had the largest corrected N50, as well as containing the largest scaffold of all the assemblies. The assembly scaffolded with the Rap amplified library, which contains the fewest wrongly oriented reads in among all amplified libraries but has the most PCR duplicates, shows the fewest additional miss-assemblies and with both the N50 and longest scaffold length very similar to the unamplified sample.4. Discussion4.1. Bias due to WGA protocols and genome featuresThere are two main types of biases present in Illumina read sequenced from amplified DNA: those that arise from the Illumina library construction and sequencing process, and those arising from the nature of DNA fragments generated from WGA. Reads of different insert size also exert influences on the extent of these biases. First, inverted repeats are known to generate chimeras in WGA protocols,17 the extent of which we assessed by recording the number of wrongly oriented reads in the samples. In fact, the distribution of wrongly oriented reads reveals that previously proposed mechanism17 only constitute a part of these, and instead the majority of these reads arise from fragments containing the same sequence on both ends with one end being an inverted version of another. The same trend was found in the G. pallida capillary reads, and a positive correlation was observed between numbers of chimeras and length of sequenced fragments. An explanation could be that the duplicated sequences are more likely to be present in larger fragments. Hence selection of such fragments in larger insert libraries after shearing will also result in preferentially selection for artefacts. In shorter insert Illumina libraries, the wrongly amplified sequences were broken down into smaller fragments and hence a decreased number of wrongly orientated reads was found. It would be interesting to sequence the whole wrongly amplified fragment to reveal the dominant nature of chimera formation in WGA.Secondly, we obtained the quality statistics of read libraries such as read coverage aligned across the genome, proportions of wrongly oriented mapped reads and searched for potential biases due to GC content, repeat composition of the C. elegans genome and the different insert size libraries. Coverage biases in regions of genomes as a result of amplification have been previously observed in bacteria16 and in humans,15 and we found that the uneven coverage between chromosome arms and centres are correlated with tandem and inverted repeat content, both of which have been previously described to bias the coverage of WGA reads.16,17 We show that in repeat regions Phi and Tre displayed lower read coverage, while Rap showed different biases depending on the repeat type, suggesting alternative mechanisms affecting the amplification process. It also may not be the repeat sequence per se, as repetitive regions in the genome are also associated with the global structural features such as histone modifications. For example, chromosomal arms of C. elegans show enrichment of H3K9 methylation,36 which are also zones of elevated meiotic recombination.34Thirdly, we found the presence of GC bias in the reads from long-insert libraries including those without WGA, despite the C. elegans genome possessing an almost uniform GC content (36%) across all chromosomes.34 The current proposed mechanisms behind WGA do not explain a bias with GC content, and indeed we found no obvious effect of WGA libraries against GC content. Hence, the overall bias is mainly caused during the library construction process of the long-insert libraries and will be even more prevalent in genomes that possess more extreme GC content, such as Plasmodium falciparum (17% GC).Finally, in this study we have analysed a total of three WGA protocols. We found that the addition of trehalose (Tre) does not seem to improve the coverage evenness against the libraries amplified with Genomiphi only (Phi), as all the metrics and biases are almost identical between two protocols. A possible explanation is that Genomiphi might have already contained reagents that work similarly to trehalose. On the other hand, libraries amplified using Rapisome (Rap) showed different patterns to Genomiphi based protocols. Constructing a good Illumina library from Rap amplified products seemed to be more difficult than Genomiphi based protocols, considering the lower number of mapped reads and higher number of PCR duplicates. However, Rap amplified libraries have shown lower number of wrongly orientated reads, suggesting an alternative mechanism that attributes to biases to different genome features. For instance, we show regions associated with inverted repeat actually increase read coverage in Rapisome libraries. It will be of interest to find out whether the lower percentage of wrongly orientated reads in Rapisome amplified libraries are also noticeable in longer insert libraries. If that was indeed the case, then Illumina libraries can be constructed from much larger amplified DNA fragments with still lower proportions of wrongly oriented reads.4.2. Performance of WGA readsSequence reads from amplified fragments can potentially give rise to false SNP calls, particularly in genomic regions that are difficult to amplify. We found that SNPs were under-called from reads generated from amplified DNA compared with unamplified samples. When reads were sequenced at good coverage, we found that ~80% of homozygous SNP candidates from unamplified samples could also be identified correctly from amplified samples, while the majority of miss calls were due to insufficient read coverage. The limitation seems to be more prevalent in heterozygous SNPs, where only up to 65% of candidates could be accurately identified. Most of these SNPs were called as homozygous in one of the alleles, and this may be due to the fact that most SNP callers make heterozygous calls confidently if allele frequencies were close to 50%, for which non-uniform coverage results in departure from this assumption. Hence, although most of the homozygous SNPs can be accurately identified in WGA samples, it is essential to investigate the allele frequencies of variant sites in order to not miss calls that were otherwise heterozygous in the sample.There have been advances in assembly algorithms that assemble genomes with fluctuating coverage in the samples, but we wished to emphasize the effect that reads sequenced from amplified fragments have on a typical assembly process, hence we applied commonly used methods to assemble the C. elegans genome using short-insert reads with the SGA assembler,28 and scaffolded using long-insert reads with the SSPACE scaffolder.29 Contig and scaffold statistics generated from amplified libraries were comparable with those from their unamplified counterparts. In fact, we found that variability between technical replicates influenced assembly metrics more than different WGA protocols. We also found that the wrongly oriented reads did not cause more miss-assemblies than expected. An explanation is that our long-insert libraries were sequenced at adequate coverage and problematic reads were present in minority. Occasions can arise where correct reads suggest joining of two scaffolds but problematic reads suggest otherwise, in which case the SSPACE scaffolder will scaffold correctly because the number of correct reads outweighs problematic reads. However, we expect that reads from larger insert WGA libraries would result in significantly more scaffolding errors because the majority of reads are problematic, with the error rate increasing with fragment length.4.3. ConclusionWGA will remain an essential method in genomics for many years to come. The mechanisms of chimera formation and other sources of bias have been investigated and there are many new protocols that are currently being developed to minimize such effects. In the meantime, it is also important to evaluate the nature of biases in order to correctly interpret assembly results. Here, we have presented the effects of WGA on Illumina reads. We recognize the biases present from the reads, and show that the DNA amplified from all protocols investigated in this article is able to call the majority of SNPs and produce accurate assemblies comparable with those produced from unamplified DNA. Reads sequenced from longer fragments are still useful in scaffolding and problematic reads can be detected and filtered out as long as they remain a minority. We envisage also using WGA in other eukaryotic species (including nematodes) that possess similar GC content and base composition to C. elegans. Fundamentally, as biologists turn to sequencing more unexplored species or samples from which only very low amounts of starting material are available, our study provides a first initial assessment on Illumina sequencing from WGA DNA.5.

IntroductionGenomic and transcriptomic comparisons between closely related bacteria are powerful approaches to infer insight into the metabolic potentials and regulatory networks. Among cyanobacteria, this has been illustrated by detailed comparative analyses of the marine picoplanktonic cyanobacteria Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus.1–3 However, due to the lack of data from closely related strains, no comprehensive comparison has focused on Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (from here on Synechocystis 6803), the otherwise most popular cyanobacterial system to work with. Synechocystis 6803 was the first phototrophic and the third organism overall for which a complete genome sequence was determined.4 The genome of Synechocystis 6803 was manually curated by the research community at CyanoBase (http://genome.microbedb.jp/cyanobase/Synechocystis).5 Over the years, several substrains of 6803 evolved in different laboratories showing distinct physiological features (e.g. glucose tolerance), from which also several have recently been re-sequenced.6–9The coverage with analysed genome sequences for the cyanobacterial phylum has been greatly improved recently. Based on a diversity-driven selection of species for genome sequencing, 54 additional strains were analysed,10 raising the number of publicly available cyanobacterial genome sequences to 126. With strain PCC 7509 also, one Synechocystis strain was sequenced. However, it is only very remotely related (90% 16S rRNA identity) to Synechocystis 6803 and belongs even to another clade (B1) than Synechocystis 6803 (B2) in the cyanobacterial tree.10 Therefore, despite its naming as Synechocystis, the strain PCC 7509 is quite distant from Synechocystis 6803. In the current cyanobacterial tree, Synechocystis 6803 is sharing a clade with unicellular N2-fixing oceanic strains such as Cyanothece spp.10 It has been reported that a 97–100% 16S rRNA identity is necessary for a productive genome comparison among strains.1–3Thus, Synechocystis 6803 lacked a closely related organism with a known genome sequence that appeared suitable for comparative analysis. To fill this gap, we selected Synechocystis sp. PCC 6714 (from here: Synechocystis 6714) as candidate. Synechocystis 6803 as well as strain 6714 are unicellular cyanobacteria that were isolated from the same freshwater pond in Oakland, California, by R. Kunisawa. These strains were initially part of the ‘Berkeley Culture Collection’,11 which were later transferred into the ‘Pasteur Culture Collection’ of cyanobacteria.12 The decision to choose Synechocystis 6714 was further supported by the high 16S rRNA identity (99.4%) among the two strains, thus well suited for comparative analyses. Their close genetic relation also was seen in an expression-based screen that revealed the presence of a highly transcribed CRISPR system in it,13 similar to the one in Synechocystis 6803.14 Moreover, the strain 6714 also represents an established laboratory strain, amenable to genetic manipulation.15,16Here, we focus on the draft genome analysis of Synechocystis 6714 in comparison to strain 6803. In a parallel study, we will provide the primary transcriptomes of both strains under 10 different conditions using strand-specific cDNA sequencing.2. Materials and methods2.1. Genome sequencing, assembly, gap closure, and annotationSynechocystis 6714 was purchased from the Pasteur Culture Collection (PCC) in Paris, France. Genomic DNA was extracted as described earlier.9 We prepared two libraries for sequencing, one with fragment lengths of 160 nt for paired-end sequencing and one with ~3 kb long fragments, which was used for preparing a mate pair library (Illumina Mate Pair Library Prep Kit, catalogue no. PE-112-2002). Both libraries were subjected to paired-end sequencing, yielding 135 969 158 reads of 101 nt length. The accumulated sequence information resulted in a nearly 2000-fold coverage when expecting a genome of 3.5 Mb. The reads were assembled with velvet17 using a kmer-length of 85, a coverage cut-off at 5, and an expected coverage of 1300. This resulted in 74 contigs arranged in five scaffolds longer than 10 000 nt. Gaps within scaffolds were analysed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and subsequent Sanger sequencing and, if successful, closed with the obtained sequence information. This removed 19 gaps reducing the number to 55. Gene prediction and annotation was done with RAST18 and led to the prediction of 3733 protein coding genes, 40 tRNAs, and 1 cluster of ribosomal RNAs.2.2. Orthologue predictionOrthologue prediction was based on the 3733 open reading frames (ORFs) from Synechocystis 6714 and 3683 ORFs from Synechocystis 6803, resulting from a combination of all ORFs from Mitschke et al., Supplementary data file S119 and all plasmid-located ORFs annotated in CyanoBase5 [accession nos. AP004311, AP004312, AP004310, AP006585, L13739, L25424, and pCC5.2 (without accession no.)]. Orthologues of protein coding genes were identified using a reciprocal best blast hit (RBH) strategy. For the identification of gene families and unique genes, we used Markov clustering (MCL)20 on the results of reciprocal BlastP searches. Clustering into protein families using the MCL algorithm yielded 2413 shared protein families with 3385 and 3187 members in Synechocystis 6803 and 6714, respectively. Putative transposase genes were identified by BLASTp searches against the ISfinder21 requiring a BLASTp value of =1e10-8.2.3. Physiological experimentsIn addition to Synechocystis 6714, we used Synechocystis 6803 substrain ‘PCC-M’9 for comparative physiological experiments. Liquid cultures were grown at 30°C in liquid BG11 medium12 under continuous white light illumination of 50–80 µmol quanta m-2 s-1. For growth on solid medium, BG11 was supplemented with 0.9% agar (Kobe I, Roth, Germany). Salt-dependent growth, GG contents, and mRNA patterns were measured for cultures of 300 ml volume that were grown under constant shaking in 500 ml Erlenmeyer flasks. The cells were pre-cultivated for 2 days at standard conditions before sterile, crystalline NaCl was added to a final concentration of 2, 4, and 6% (w/v), respectively. After 4 days, 50 ml of cells was harvested by rapid filtration on hydrophilic polyethersulfone filters (Pall Supor 800 Filter, 0.8 µm). The adherent cell material was immediately dissolved in 1 ml of PGTX solution22 and total RNA was extracted as described.13 For the measurement of glucosylglycerol content, 2 ml of cells was harvested by centrifugation and soluble metabolites were extracted with 80% ethanol (HPLC gradient, Roth, Germany). The supernatant was freeze-dried. The cell extract was then purified from insoluble material by centrifugation and the supernatant was also freeze-dried. Both, the dried cell extracts and external fractions were resuspended in A. dest (HPLC gradient, Roth, Germany), centrifuged and the supernatant was freeze-dried again. Samples were then analysed by gas chromatography as previously described.232.4. Northern blot analysisFor expression analysis, 3 µg of total RNA was separated on 1.5% agarose gels, transferred to Hybond-N nylon membranes by capillary blotting and cross-linked by UV-illumination. The membranes were hybridized with 32P-labelled RNA probes generated from specific DNA templates by using Ambion® MAXIscript® T7 In Vitro Transcription Kit as described earlier.24 The oligonucleotide sequences used for the generation of DNA templates by PCR are given in Supplementary Table S1. Signals were visualized with the Personal Molecular Imager FX system and Quantity One software (Bio-Rad).3. Results and discussion3.1. Draft genome of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6714The genome of Synechocystis 6714 was sequenced using two libraries of different lengths by paired-end sequencing and assembled into five scaffolds ranging from 46 504 to 2 984 476 nt in length. The DNA is characterized by an average GC content of 47.37%, which is very close to the value of 47.4% reported for strain 6714 in 1971 based on CsCl density gradient equilibrium centrifugation.11 The longest scaffold C2 likely represents the major part of the chromosome, since it closely resembles the chromosome of strain 6803. Table 1 summarizes the main features of the draft genome. Since the scaffolds C0 and C4 carry tRNA genes and the majority of their protein-coding genes have orthologues on the chromosome of Synechocystis 6803, they also are likely part of the chromosome. This assumption also is in line with their 3 and 5% higher GC content compared with the scaffolds C1 and C3. For comparison, the GC content of the Synechocystis 6803 chromosome is 47.72%, whereas it also is lower for three out of the four large plasmids (pSYSX, 42.72%; pSYSA, 44.48%, pSYSM, 42.95%).25 By combining the scaffolds C0, C2, and C4, we estimated the size of the Synechocystis 6714 chromosome to be around 3.45 Mb, which is fairly similar to the 3.57 Mb of Synechocystis 6803. Summary of the Synechocystis 6714 draft genome main featuresSummary of the Synechocystis 6714 draft genome main featuresCompared with the rather high similarity of the chromosome size and coding capacity, the similarities of plasmid sequences were rather low between the two strains. Among the seven plasmids25–28 of Synechocystis 6803, we found no significant similarities toward its plasmids pSYSG, pCC5.2, pCA2.4, and pCB2.4 in strain 6714. In contrast, sequences resembling about one-third each of pSYSA, pSYSM, and pSYSX of Synechocystis 6803 were detected in strain 6714 (Fig. 1). Thus, our draft genome points at a different composition or lower coding capacity of extrachromosomal plasmids in strain 6714 compared with strain 6803.

Synechocystis 6803 possesses at least 134 genes encoding transposases. These transposases, which were identified by BLASTp searches against the ISfinder database,21 requiring a BLASTp E-value of =10–8, were assigned to 11 different families, each containing 1–45 identical copies. The highest copy numbers were found for the IS630, IS5, and IS701 families of IS elements (Table 2, Supplementary Table S2). In Synechocystis 6714, we identified only 32 transposase genes, which belong to only six different families. The highest copy numbers were found for the IS200/IS605 family and as before in strain 6803 for IS630 and IS5 families (Table 2, Supplementary Table S3). At a first glance, this high divergence in the numbers and types of insertion sequences appears surprising, given the otherwise close relatedness among the two strains. However, this finding is in line with reports for the ISY203 group of elements (belonging to the IS4 family) that vary even among substrains of 6803. Four members of this IS element with identical nucleotide sequences were present only in the ‘Kazusa’ substrain, whereas they were absent in the genomes of other substrains.29Types and numbers of IS elements found on basis of identified transposase genesTypes and numbers of IS elements found on basis of identified transposase genesUsing RBH, we identified 2838 orthologous protein-coding genes between Synechocystis 6714 and 6803, leaving 845 specific genes in strain 6803 and 895 specific genes in strain 6714. Thus, among the two strains, more than 75% of the genes are conserved. However, many of the strain-specific genes belong to gene families that were clustered as paralogues to pairs of orthologue genes when using the MCL algorithm,20 indicating gene duplications, sequence, and probably also functional diversification. The full list of orthologue and paralogue genes between the two strains is presented in Supplementary Table S4. In Supplementary Tables S5 and S6, we present the lists of unique protein-coding genes. Only 537 of the 845 Synechocystis-6803-specific genes are located on the chromosome (=16% of all chromosomal protein-coding genes; Supplementary Table S5), whereas 308 of the genes lacking a clear orthologue (=76% of all plasmid-located protein-coding genes in 6803) can be explained by the strong differences in the plasmid-located gene pool. Moreover, it should be noted that the majority of strain-specific genes encodes for proteins of unknown function, i.e. the functional significance of the majority of differences is thus uncertain.3.2. Large-scale differences between Synechocystis 6803 and Synechocystis 6714: unique genetic arrangements in a large genomic island and prophage Psy1The higher number of transposon genes in Synechocystis 6803 is correlated with a low degree of syntheny between the two strains. Another situation exists with the rfb-gene cluster that differs entirely between the two strains and encodes several glycosyltransferases possibly involved in cell wall biosynthesis and the modification of cell surface properties. This region has features of a genomic island, since the adjacent genes are conserved between the two Synechocystis strains, but the GC content drops considerably (from 48 to 35%) within this region in both strains (Fig. 2). Genomic islands consist of sets of genes that become laterally transferred, belong to the flexible gene pool of a bacterial phylum and frequently provide a certain fitness advantage.30 Accordingly, the most closely related homologues matching to these proteins are found in a wide variety of organisms. For the 50 genes located in the Synechocystis 6714 rfb gene cluster, the phylogenetically top-matching proteins belong to groups as diverse as Zetaproteobacteria, Bacilli, Clostridia, Armatimonadetes, Rhodopirellula, and Stigonematales cyanobacteria. The top-matching proteins against the Synechocystis 6803 rfb gene cluster proteins are of comparable diversity. A particular example is also the norf2 gene which was annotated on the basis of transcriptome data.19 The most closely related proteins to Norf2 (Fig. 2) are annotated in Thiocapsa marina (69% identical and 86% similar residues) and several Thioalkalivibrio species, pointing further to the alien origin of this genomic region. A likely genomic island in two Synechocystis strains. A genomic segment of ~40 kb from Synechocystis 6803 is shown with some genes annotated for orientation (EPS, exopolysaccharide export protein; CmcI, Cephalosporin hydroxylase protein; GT1, GT1 family of glycosyltransferases; GTA-GTB, fusion protein joining a glycosyltransferase family A with a glycosyltransferase family B domain; Norf2 is a 68 amino acid peptide-encoding gene originally predicted on basis of transcriptome data indicating the presence of an mRNA for this conserved reading frame).19 Adjacent genes to this region are in the two strains of the gene pairs slr0976/slr0977 and sly1015510/sly1015500 encoding a DUF820 protein and an ABC transporter permease component; left side in 6803) and slr1084/slr1085 and sly1015040/sly1015030 (encoding a WcaF-type acyl transferase and a glycosyltransferase; right side in 6803). The GC % content, indicated by the green bars (each representing 1000 nt), drops considerably within this region. Thus, this region has features of a genomic island. The nucleotide identity to matching segments in the Synechocystis 6714 genome is colour coded (red >90%, light red >70%). The corresponding stretch in the Synechocystis 6714 genome encompasses genes sly1015490– sly1015020, almost entirely belonging to the list of unique genes in that strain (Supplementary Table S6). The proteins encoded by these genes are annotated as hypothetical proteins, UDP-glucose 4-epimerase, several different glycosyltransferases, rhamnogalacturonides degradation protein RhiN, dTDP-glucose 4'6'-dehydratase, methylase/methyltransferase, ABC transporter, GDP-mannose 4'6'dehydratase and as NAD-dependent epimerase/dehydratase.A likely genomic island in two Synechocystis strains.

In Synechocystis 6714, the orthologues of these seven genes (sly1009900–sly1009960) form a cluster with gene sly1009870 encoding the NiFe hydrogenase metallocenter assembly protein HypD, whereas the homologue in Synechocystis 6803, slr1498, is located 1.62 Mb away.A further difference between Synechocystis 6714 and 6803 genomes is the presence of a prophage in the former but its lack in the latter (Fig. 3). As this prophage has not been previously described, we called it Psy1, for prophage in Synechocystis 1. The genomic DNA of Psy1 has integrated into the trnF (phenylalanine-specific tRNAGAA) gene, duplicating its 3' half but restoring the gene to be functional intact. This insertion might have occurred only recently as the duplicated segment of the trnF gene is still sequence identical with the original prophage host gene. Although the Psy1 genome is with a total length of 20 660 nt quite short for a prophage, genomes of comparable size have recently been reported for siphoviruses, which infect marine cyanobacteria (e.g. S-CBS1 infecting Synechococcus strains CB0201, CB0204, CB0202, and CB0101).31 The annotation of Psy1 adds another 27 genes unique for strain 6714 (Supplementary Table S6). Most of these genes have no closely related homologues in database searches, indicating that Psy1 might belong to a novel group of bacteriophages. Clear homologues exist for Sly1027750, an integrase with several homologues in other cyanobacterial genomes; Sly1027640, an HK97 family phage portal protein with the tail sheath protein from the Pseudomonas transducing phage PhiPA3 as the best matching protein in the bacteriophage database (BlastP E-value 7e-16);32 Sly1027490, a lysozyme superfamily protein with the putative endolysin from Acinetobacter phage phiAC-1 as the best matching bacteriophage protein (BlastP E-value 2e-30);33 Sly1027700, a D5 N terminal like domain-containing protein of phage D5 proteins and bacteriophage P4 DNA primases (Fig. 3).

One of the two proteins encoded by these two genes, Sly1027680, has similarity to bacteriophage repressor proteins and belongs to the HTH XRE family of Cro/CI repressor proteins, suggesting its possible involvement in silencing Psy1 activity. The other protein, Sly1027670, possesses a predicted partial endoribonuclease Y domain and revealed in database searches several good matches, with protein Ssl7074 from Synechocystis 6803 as the top hit (47% identical and 59% similar positions). Interestingly, gene ssl7074 in Synechocystis 6803 is located within the CRISPR2-associated region of cas genes next to the cas 6-2b gene, a candidate for an endonuclease involved in CRISPR crRNA maturation.143.3. Genetic differences with particular physiological relevanceSeveral of the strain-specific genes likely affect the physiology or provide certain strain-specific characteristics allowing their settlement in specific environmental niches (see Supplementary Table S5 and S6 for the list of unique genes in Synechocystis 6803 and 6714, respectively). For instance, only Synechocystis 6803 possesses genes for the proteins Flv2 and Flv4, which are essential for growth under fluctuating light and are supposed to protect photosystem II against photoinhibition.34 In contrast, in Synechocystis 6714, two operons are found, each encoding all subunits of the high-affinity K+ transporter Kdp,35 similar to the situation in filamentous cyanobacteria such as Anabaena sp. PCC7120, whereas Synechocystis 6803 harbours only one copy of the kdp2 type.36 To date, it was believed that unicellular cyanobacteria have a single kdp system or none, whereas filamentous cyanobacteria have two or more copies.36A distinct group of protein-coding genes that differs between the two strains are associated with the CRISPR system, the prokaryotic immune system, accounting for 17 different proteins alone (Supplementary Tables S5 and S6). There are three distinct loci of CRISPR-cas genes in both strains.13,14 One of them (called CRISPR3/CRISPR3*) is highly conserved, whereas the other two appear to have been substituted over their entire length, possibly by an active mechanism of exchange. Details of the different CRISPR-cas loci were published separately.13One feature that has been reported to differ even between Synechocystis 6803 substrains is motility. Therefore, a standard motility assay was conducted and demonstrated that Synechocystis 6714 is non-motile (Fig. 4). However, among the known mutations that affect motility in Synechocystis 6803 substrains, we found an intact spkA protein kinase gene,37 an intact hfq gene,38 as well as most pil genes.39 However, one missing gene in Synechocystis 6714 encodes an orthologue of PilA5 (slr1928 in Synechocystis 6803), a type 4 pilin-like protein, which is involved in the formation of thick pili and motility40 and therefore may explain the observed phenotype. Verification of physiological and genetic differences predicted upon draft genome analysis of Synechocystis 6714. (A) Phototactic motility of Synechocystis. Cells from liquid cultures (OD750 = 0.2) were dropped onto a BG11-agar plate, pre-cultivated under standard conditions for 3 days and afterwards exposed to a gradient of incident light with intensity 50 µE. The photograph was taken before and after further 5 days. (B) Drop dilution assay showing the growth on solid media in the presence of increasing concentrations of Zn2+ ions. The photograph was taken after 10 days of standard cultivation.Verification of physiological and genetic differences predicted upon draft genome analysis of Synechocystis 6714.

The photograph was taken after 10 days of standard cultivation.Furthermore, a gene cassette involved in the sensing and the resistance to Zn2+ and Co2+ (including the genes corR, corT, ziaA, and ziaR; Supplementary Table S5)41,42 appears to be specific for Synechocystis 6803 and missing in strain 6714. The functional significance of this difference was tested in growth experiments in the presence of increasing amounts of Zn2+ ions and revealed the higher tolerance of strain 6803 against high Zn2+ levels (Fig. 4).Another four genes, which were not found in the Synechocystis 6714 genome, are the ggtABCD genes encoding a transport system for the (re-)uptake of the compatible solute glucosylglycerol.43,44 Apart from that, the loci adjacent to ggtA or ggtBCD in Synechocystis 6803 are conserved in the genome of Synechocystis 6714 (Fig. 5A and B). To verify the absence of Ggt, Northern hybridization with 32P-labelled probes specific for ggtA or ggtBCD was performed with RNA from salt-treated cells. As expected, no mRNA was detected in salt-treated cells of strain 6714, whereas the expression level of the ggt genes correlated with the external salinity in Synechocystis 6803 (Fig. 5C). Moreover, the relative abundance of the mRNA for ggpS, the gene encoding the key enzyme of glucosylglycycerol synthesis, the main compatible solute in these two strains, was measured and revealed its salt-dependent expression in Synechocystis 6714 (Fig. 5C), similar to the well-characterized situation in Synechocystis 6803.45 These results further substantiated that, even though the 6714 genome is not completely finished, the lack of certain genes correlates to physiological differences. Comparative genome analysis reveals the absence of the genes encoding the glucosylglycerol transport system (Ggt). (A) Genomic region encompassing the ggtA gene in Synechocystis 6803 and of the corresponding region in Synechocystis 6714. (B) Genomic region encompassing the ggtBCD operon. Apart from Ggt, both loci are well conserved (protein identity scores of ca. 90%). (C) Occurrence of mRNAs for ggtA, ggtBCD, and ggpS in salt-treated cells of both strains. For ggpS, salt-dependent expression was observed in both strains, whereas mRNAs for ggtA and ggtBCD were not detected in strain 6714.Comparative genome analysis reveals the absence of the genes encoding the glucosylglycerol transport system (Ggt).

For ggpS, salt-dependent expression was observed in both strains, whereas mRNAs for ggtA and ggtBCD were not detected in strain 6714.Deletion of Ggt in Synechocystis 6803 results in the inability of taking up GG as well as trehalose and sucrose.43,44 Furthermore, the ggtA mutant of strain 6803 became leaky for GG, i.e. an increase in GG in the medium was observed when cells were grown in salt medium, suggesting that its transport is mainly necessary for recovery of GG leaked through the cytoplasmic membrane into the periplasm.43 Due to the absence of Ggt in strain 6714, an uptake of GG seemed unlikely and a GG accumulation in the medium during growth at elevated salinities should be measureable. To test this hypothesis, the intra- as well as extracellular GG contents were measured for cultures acclimated to different salinities. Under freshwater conditions (0% NaCl), the cells of both strains were virtually free of GG. In Synechocystis 6803, the intracellular GG level increased corresponding to the external salt level, whereas in the surrounding medium, virtually no GG was found (Fig. 6A). In principle, a correlation of the internal GG content and the external salt concentration was also observed for strain 6714. Up to a salinity of 4% NaCl, the GG concentrations with respect to the average biomass (expressed as OD750) were similar. However, no further increase was observed when cells were grown at 6% NaCl pointing to a somewhat lower salt tolerance of strain 6714 (see below). Interestingly, GG also accumulated in high amounts in the surrounding medium, which supports the assumption that an effective system for the re-uptake of GG is missing in Synechocystis 6714 (Fig. 6A). Similar to the internal, also the external GG content increased according to the salinity (Fig. 6A). Effects of the absence or presence of the ggtABCD system.

Thus, an effective uptake system seems reasonable for a bacterium whose osmotic adaptation is based on GG accumulation. For a Ggt mutant of Synechocystis 6803, it was postulated that the inability to take up leaked GG should result in a lower salt tolerance or at least to a lower growth performance under higher salinities, especially if the cells are grown under Ci-limitation.43 Interestingly, in liquid cultures that had a rather low surface:volume ratio, which results in a poor aeration in turn leading to a low degree of Ci availability, strain 6714 grew slower compared with strain 6803 in the presence of increased NaCl concentrations (Fig. 6B). In contrast, both strains showed similar growth performance under freshwater conditions (0% NaCl). Moreover, strain 6714 also showed a lower salt tolerance when cells were grown on solid medium in the presence of various NaCl concentrations (Fig. 6C). In the presence of 3% NaCl, no colonies were observed for strain 6714, whereas 6803 grew well under the same condition.4. DiscussionThe here presented draft genome sequence of Synechocystis 6714 allows comparative genome-based studies, as we demonstrate for several examples of physiological importance. Other comparative analyses include the direct comparison of promoter elements and of conserved sRNAs with similar regulation, implying conservation of function as we are showing in a separate manuscript.We have noticed several important differences between the two strains. As the absence of a gene from a draft genome sequence might be considered ambiguous, we have highlighted cases for which the physiological difference predicted by the lack of certain genes could indeed be demonstrated. Among these differences is the lack of a transport system for the re-uptake of the compatible solute glucosylglycerol, linked to the observation that strain 6714 showed growth retardation at salinities above 2%, whereas strain 6803 even managed 4% in liquid cultures. The accumulation of GG in the external medium meaning a permanent loss of fixed carbon might be reasonable for the reduced salt tolerance of strain 6714 as has been postulated earlier.43In addition to compatible solute accumulation, a balancing of the ionic composition is also important to cope with changing salinities. For instance, an active extrusion of Na+ is essential for cyanobacteria in order to maintain a low, non-toxic intracellular level. Homologues for most genes known to be involved in Na+ transport and which might be also important during salt acclimation (for review, see Hagemann)46 are found in the genome of Synechocystis 6714. However, a homologue of sll1685 (PxcA) which might be involved in the energetization of Na+ transport is missing. Furthermore, the genome of Synechocystis 6714 harbours two copies of the kdp operon each encoding a high-affinity K+ transporter (genes sly5000010–sly5000050 and sly1021590– sly1021630), whereas strain 6803 has a single copy of this operon (slr1728–slr1731). The Kdp ATPase system, initially characterized in Escherichia coli, is responsible for the immediate uptake of K+ after salt or osmotic shock in E. coli.35 In combination with glutamate as an organic counter ion, K+ is believed to act as a temporary compatible solute and moreover as a regulatory signal for the initiation of subsequent acclimation processes, also in cyanobacteria.46,47 Interestingly, the kinetics for the uptake of K+ in cyanobacteria after salt shock was characterized for Synechocystis 6714.48 A sudden osmotic shift by adding 500 mM NaCl was followed by a transient accumulation of K+ which started within the first minutes, peaked at around 30–60 min and declined after 24 h to levels similar to non-shocked cells. The decrease in K+ was accompanied by an accumulation of GG. The kinetics of a K+ uptake have not been measured so far for Synechocystis 6803, but it might be a bit different from the process in Synechocystis 6714 due to the absence of a second kdp operon.Another interesting observation is the putative substitution of a gene cassette of ~40 kb encoding several glycosyltransferases, transport proteins, and hypothetical proteins in the two strains. Together with the presence of some genes not found in any other cyanobacteria and the strongly reduced average GC % content in this region, this region is likely representing a genomic island. Physiologically and ecologically important genomic islands have been identified in several marine cyanobacteria.2,3,49,50 Interestingly, glycosyltransferase and glycoside hydrolase gene families have also been found frequent in several of these cyanobacterial genomic islands. Therefore, the modification of cell surface polysaccharide and lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis by several of these enzymes, presumably allowing diversification of cell surface features appears central for this group of organisms. Such modification capacity is likely to be relevant in the avoidance of grazers and even more in the avoidance of bacteriophage infection.51In conclusion, the draft genome analysis of Synechocystis 6714 allows to follow interesting research problems in this strain. However, most importantly, it opens exciting new opportunities when working with the most advanced cyanobacterial model, Synechocystis 6803.5.

IntroductionProtein repeats are important and common phenomenon shared by all organisms. A repetition in protein sequence allows considerable sequence divergence and multiple binding partners. This observation indicates that the protein repetitions could be an evolutionary link among all members of the proteins.1 Unlike domains and motifs, protein repeats can occur individually, even though multiplicity is a known fact for them.2 One such evolutionarily conserved protein ensemble is known as Armadillo (ARM) repeat protein family. The occurrence of Armadillo gene family has been reported in proteomes of diverse organisms, such as unicellular eukaryotes (Chlamydomonas), non-metazoan (Dictyostelium), and recently been reported in higher plants.3–8 Armadillo comprises a multigene superfamily, in many plant species. ß-Catenin is the vertebrate homologue of Armadillo protein, critical for the development of multicellular organisms.9,10 Proteins having ARM repeats are known to participate in multiple cellular processes such as signal transduction, nuclear transport, cell adhesion, and protein degradation.11–17 Studies have revealed that ARM proteins have some novel functions in plants, which are determined by their plant-specific functional groups present along with the ARM repeat domain.14 This observation indicates the functional significance of these non-described related domains and proteins, and suggests the involvement of many of these ARM repeat proteins in biotic, abiotic, and hormonal signalling networks.1,13,18Arabidopsis have been reported with more than 100 ARM repeat proteins, a subset of these has already been characterized.14 Studies in Arabidopsis thaliana,7Oryza sativa,8Nicotiana tabacum,6 and Brassica napus15 have helped to categorize ARM proteins into several distinct and specific subgroups on the basis of different functional groups present in conjunction with ARM repeat domain. Unlike animals, several of plant ARM proteins function as components of ubiquitin-proteasome system. There, they act as a part of Plant U-box (PUB) family where the ARM repeat region is preceded by an E3 ubiquitin ligase motif called the U-box14,15 thereby targeting a protein for timely degradation, which is a well-conserved mechanism throughout eukaryotes.3Although considerable amount of work has been carried out in characterizing ARM proteins in plants, the functions of the majority of members in this family remain unknown. The objective of the current study is to explore the Armadillo superfamily in rice genome. Using bioinformatics approaches and the information derived from publically available plant databases, the detailed phylogenetic and domain analysis have been carried out for the entire set of ARM proteins. Subsequently, detailed expression analysis during various stages of development and abiotic stress conditions using gene chip microarray and real-time PCR was undertaken to develop a detailed molecular, evolutionary, and functional insights of their possible role in planta.2. Materials and methods2.1. Identification of Armadillo superfamily genes in rice genomeInitially, a sequence homology search was performed in RGAP-TIGR 6.1 (http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/) using protein sequences of Arabidopsis Armadillo proteins as query.14 All entries with an E-value of =1 were considered as the member of ARM family. Subsequently, a protein name (or keyword) search was performed in the NCBI protein database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein) to obtain ARM repeats containing sequences from O. sativa. All sequences retrieved from these databases were used to perform a pBLAST search again in RGAP6.1. After excluding partial and redundant sequences, all putative ARM repeat proteins were subjected to HHPred scan (http://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/hhpred) for their domain structure.19 Sequences that were showing significant homology (E-value = 1) with the prototypical ARM repeat proteins such as ß-catenin, importin-a, plakophilin, and APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) were considered as members of Armadillo superfamily in O. sativa.The HMM profile for the ARM domain was generated using seed sequences retrieved from Pfam (PF00514) and used to obtain a consensus model using HMMER package 3.0.20 The HMM profile was used as query to search all the annotated proteins in whole rice genome at TIGR (O. sativa; TIGR release 6.1; ARM domain proteins). In addition, 141 putative protein sequences of ARM superfamily available in InterPro database (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/pfa/iprscan) were retrieved and further scanned using HMM_ARM signature matrix as well as HHPred (http://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/hhpred) for the presence of tandem ARM repeats. Finally, the deduced protein sequences of predicted Armadillo genes obtained from all the above searches were analysed for any additional motifs or domains using SMART (http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de) and Pfam (http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/) databases. Various properties and attributes of ARM genes such as locus ID, protein length (AA), tBLASTx match with Arabidopsis, and expression evidence in terms of total number of ESTs were extracted from RGAP 6.1 and full-length cDNA accession from KOME (http://cdna01.dna.affrc.go.jp/cDNA) and NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). The HMM search was also performed in the recently released version 7.0 of rice pseudo-molecule database, and the number of predicted Armadillo genes was found to be the same as in version 6.1.2.2. Phylogenetic analysisTo investigate the evolutionary relationship of Armadillo genes in rice, phylogenetic analysis was carried out using the full-length protein sequences of rice and Arabidopsis14 ARM repeat proteins. In addition, to investigate evolutionary relationships within the ARM/U-box gene families of both the species, a combined phylogenetic tree was generated using complete protein sequences. These phylogenetic trees were constructed by neighbour-joining algorithm employing MEGA 5.0.21 The bootstrap analysis was performed using 1000 replicates and the branch lengths corresponded to phylogenetic distances are in units of the number of amino acid substitutions per site.2.3. Nomenclature, chromosomal distribution, and duplication of rice Armadillo genesThe genes were uniformly named in numerical order starting from OsARM1 to OsARM109. To avoid multiple designations being applied to the same gene, previous nomenclature has been kept unchanged (Supple-mentary Table S1). The location of rice Armadillo genes was determined using chromosomal map tool available as Oryzabase-Integrated Science Database (http://viewer.shigen.info/oryzavw/maptool/MapTool.do). The duplication of Armadillo genes on segmentally duplicated regions was determined using ‘Paralogons in Arabidopsis’ (http://oldwolfe.gen.tcd.ie/athal/all_results) and segmental genome duplication database for rice (http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/segmental_dup/100kb/segdup_100kbshtml) at a maximum length distance permitted between collinear gene pairs of 100 kb. For finding tandemly duplicated candidates, genes with separation by five or less genes were selected.2.4. Estimating age of duplicated paralogue gene pairsTo calculate the age of segmentally duplicated Armadillo paralogues, the pairwise alignment of Armadillo gene pairs from Arabidopsis and rice was performed using Clustal X 2.0.12. The age of a duplication event was estimated by the number of synonymous substitution per synonymous site (Ks). The Ks values of the duplicate Armadillo gene pairs were estimated by the program K Estimator 6.1.22 Based on synonymous substitutions per year (<U+03BB>) of 1.5 × 10-8 for Arabidopsis,23 6.5 × 10-9 for rice,24 and by substituting the calculated Ks values, the approximate age of duplicated events of the duplicate Armadillo gene pairs was estimated (T = Ks/2<U+03BB>). The selection pressure for these duplicate Armadillo paralogue gene pairs was calculated as Ka/Ks ratio.2.5. Plant material, growth conditions, and stress treatmentThe tissue was harvested from field-grown rice plants (O. sativa ssp. Indica var. IR64) at different stages of panicle and seed development.25 For the stress treatment, sterilized IR64 rice seeds were grown in culture room conditions at 28 ± 1°C with a daily photoperiodic cycle of 14 h light and 10 h dark. After 7 days growth, different stress treatments were subjected to the seedlings. Salt treatment was given by transferring the seedlings into 200 mM NaCl solution; for cold treatment, seedlings were kept at 4 ± 1°C in sterile water; and for dehydration, seedlings were air-dried on a Whatmann sheet at 28 ± 1°C for 3 h. Parallel control samples were prepared by keeping the seedlings in sterile water for 3 h. Treated seedlings were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen.2.6. Microarray-based gene expression analysisGenome-wide microarray analysis was performed according to Ray et al.25 to generate the expression profile of OsARM genes. The samples for microarray experiment included 3 vegetative stages (mature leaf, 7-day-old seedling, and their roots), 11 reproductive stages (P1–P6 and S1–S5; representing panicle and seed developmental stages, respectively), and 3 abiotic stress conditions, i.e. cold, salt, and dehydration. Total RNA was isolated from three biological replicates for each stage/treated tissue and microarray experiments were carried out using 51 Affymetrix Gene Chip Rice Genome Arrays (Gene Expression Omnibus, GEO, platform accession number GPL2025) as described in Ray et al. The raw data (excel) files generated from all the chips were imported to Array Assist 5.0 software (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) for detailed analysis. Microarray expression data have been deposited in the gene expression omnibus (GEO) at NCBI under the series accession numbers GSE6893 and GSE6901 by Ray et al.25 The downstream analysis was performed according to Ray et al.252.7. Expression analysis by MPSSThe expression profile for those genes, which could not be represented on Affymetrix rice Gene Chip®, was generated from rice MPSS (Massively Parallel Signature Sequence) database (http://mpss.udel.edu/rice/). Analysis was performed using five different selected libraries to retrieve 17 bp signature sequences. Only those signatures were included in the analysis, which were unique to the genome and were transcribed from the respective strand of the gene (Classes 1 and 2). A TPM (transcript abundance values per million) cut-off of =3 was set to avoid the background signal. The normalized TPM were used to assess the expression profile.2.8. Quantitative expression analysis by real-time PCRReal-time PCR was performed to verify the microarray expression pattern for a few selected OsARM genes, expressed significantly during three abiotic stresses and in various rice tissues/developmental stages. Primers were made for all the selected genes preferentially, from the 3' end, employing PRIMER EXPRESS (Applied Biosystems, USA), with default settings. Each primer was checked using BLAST tool of NCBI for its specificity for the respective gene, and also was confirmed by the dissociation curve analysis after the PCR reaction. Four micrograms of DNase-treated total RNA were used to synthesize the first-strand cDNA in 100 µl of reaction volume using high-capacity cDNA Archive kit (Applied Biosystems). KAPA SYBR FAST master mix (KAPA BIOSYSTEMS, USA) was used to determine the expression levels for the genes in ABI Prism 7000 Sequence detection System (Applied Biosystems). Two biological replicates of each sample were used for the real-time PCR analysis. The average of three technical replicates for each sample was calculated to obtain the Ct value. To normalize the variance among samples, actin was used as the endogenous control. Relative expression values were calculated by employing the <U+0394><U+0394>Ct method and normalized the data against the maximum average expression value from microarray. The Pearson correlation coefficient (r value) between microarray and real-time PCR was calculated. The (r)-values range between -1 and +1; positive r-values correspond to correlated data sets, negative values to anti-correlated data sets, and values close to zero to non-correlated. To calculate the real-time PCR efficiency, serial dilutions of 10 folds were made of selected cDNA samples. Target assay was performed for ACTIN gene. Using the standard curve plotted for the Ct value and the log copy number (Supplementary Fig. S1), the slope of the line was calculated. Using the formula (Efficiency = 10(-1/Slope)-1), efficiency was calculated.2.9. Promoter analysisTo find the various cis-acting regulatory elements in the promoter of prospective stress-inducible rice Armadillo genes, 1 kb upstream sequence from translation start site was extracted from RGAP 6.1. The upstream sequence was subsequently scanned in PlantCARE26 database for the presence of various cis-regulatory elements. Various motifs involved in stress responsiveness and development were identified and their positions were marked.3. Results3.1. Identification of Armadillo superfamily in the rice genomeIn order to identify and categorize Armadillo protein family in rice on a genome-wide level, multiple approaches were employed. Together, BLASTp and HMM profile search resulted into a list of 133 OsARM genes. In addition, 141 protein sequences from InterPro database (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/) and 1055 sequences from NCBI of Armadillo superfamily in rice were retrieved. Although ARM repeat proteins do not essentially share a large sequence similarity, they do share a related structure.27 Taking into account that true repeat proteins contain multiple repeats and detection of all these repeats by domain prediction servers is not feasible because they often are not exact enough to identify certain motifs varying in terms of sequence and number of repeat units.28 Henceforth, all the combined hits obtained from above searches were subsequently analysed in the HHpred server (http://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/hhpred).19 HHpred provide highly sensitive detection of HEAT/ARM repeats by implementing pairwise comparison of hidden Markov models (HMMs) profile and for structure prediction with a low false-positive rate.19 Following the intensive database search, HMM search, structure, and domain analysis, 158 Armadillo genes (E-value = 1 × 10-10) were identified in the rice genome (Supplementary Table S1).3.2. Phylogenetic and domain analysis of OsARM repeat proteinsTo elucidate the evolutionary significance of ARM proteins across species, comparative phylogenetic analysis was performed using complete protein sequences of OsARMs and their respective Arabidopsis orthologues from previous study by Mudgil et al.14 The result showed that rice ARM repeat proteins coincide with specific ARM gene subtypes in Arabidopsis, signifying that ARM repeats might have co-evolved between the monocots and eudicots (Fig. 1). Additionally, several other accessory functional domains were found to be present in all predicted ARM repeat proteins. As observed in Arabidopsis, the U-box containing ARM repeat proteins (OsPUB-ARM) were found to outline a major group with 47 of 158 ARM repeats proteins in the rice genome. The unique UND region was also recognized based on sequence homology with the Arabidopsis UND/U-box proteins. Interestingly, the number of UND/U-box proteins was found to be equivalent (17) in both rice and Arabidopsis. Moreover, we observed that rice ARM proteins also display similar organization of ARM repeats and other domains when compared with well-characterized orthologues of Arabidopsis ARM family. Other known domains found in rice are five Importin-a proteins with Importin-ß-binding (IBB) domain followed by five to seven ARM repeats. A large number of additional motifs were found to be associated within the predicted set of ARM proteins. These included domains implicated in protein–protein interactions such as HEAT and BTB. Again, several domains recognized for their role in protein ubiquitination such as U-box (47), HECT (1), Fes1 (3), and F-box (1) were found in conjunction with ARM domain in rice. In addition, two calcium-dependent phospholipid binding C2 domain responsible for membrane targeting and three microtubule-associated kinesin motor domain proteins were also found to be present. The protein sequence of sole orthologue of Arabidillo-1, 2 in rice (LOC_Os10g41360) derived from RGAP (http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu) did not contain NLS/F-box N-terminal; however, a BAC clone search (GenBank Accession: AAG60190) in NCBI has confirmed the similar domain organization. Phylogenetic relationship between Arabidopsis and rice ARM superfamily genes. A phylogeny created with the full-length protein sequences of ARMs in Arabidopsis and O. sativa. The alignment of ARM repeat protein sequences of rice Armadillo genes was done using ClustalX 2.0.12. An unrooted neighbour-joining (NJ) tree was generated using the p-distance substitution model in MEGA 5. Bootstrap analysis was performed with 1000 replicates to obtain a support value for each branch. Based on bootstrap score, the phylogenetic tree is divided into 15 groups. The domain organization and number and position of ARM repeats in rice have been predicted by the sequence analysis in HHpred and Pfam. The domain organization of Arabidopsis ARM proteins has been adapted from Mudgil et al. 2004. The representative domain organization of each gene is shown on the right.Phylogenetic relationship between Arabidopsis and rice ARM superfamily genes.

Chromosomal distribution and duplication of Armadillo genes in riceTo determine the chromosomal distribution of Armadillo genes in rice, chromosomal maps were constructed. ARM genes were found to be variably distributed on all chromosomes with maximum 27 genes on chromosome 7 and minimum 6 on chromosome numbers 9 and 10. This is followed by chromosome numbers 12, 2, 3, and 1 with 20, 18, 17, and 16 genes, respectively (Fig. 2). Sixteen pairs of OsARM genes were found to be segmentally duplicated (Supplementary Table S2). Moreover, tandem duplication was observed among 30 genes forming 9 groups on chromosome numbers 5, 6, 7, and 12. Maximum tandemly duplicated genes were found on chromosome numbers 7 and 12 with four and three groups of genes. Whereas, in Arabidopsis, 13 pairs of ARM genes were found to be segmentally duplicated and 10 genes with four groups were found to be exhibiting tandem duplication (Supplementary Table S3). Predictably, all segmental as well as tandemly duplicated genes share similar domain organization and almost same number of ARM repeats. We further estimated the approximate age of segmentally duplicated Armadillo paralogous gene pairs from Arabidopsis and rice (Supplementary Table S4). The number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (Ks) is generally used to estimate the evolutionary age of duplicate gene pairs.29 The nucleotide sequence of three duplicated gene pairs, At1g20780–At1g76390, At3g06210–At5g18980, and At3g01450–At5g14790 from Arabidopsis showed a Ks value of 0.673, 0.622, and 0.615, respectively, indicating that their duplication might have occurred 22, 20.7, and 20.4, MYA (million years ago) consistent with its divergence from the genus Brassica~12–20 MYA,30 but four of the gene pairs At1g01830–At2g45720, At1g23030–At1g71020, At5g09800–At5g64660, and At3g49810–At5g65920 showed a Ks value of 1.656,0.787, 0.715, and 0.719, respectively, indicating that their duplication might have occurred 55, 26, 23.83, and 23.9 MYA before the appearance of crucifers ~24–40 MYA.31 Likewise, the segmentally duplicated pair OsARM13-OsARM49 showed a Ks value of 1.15, signifying that its duplication might have occurred ~88.65 MYA, subsequent to the divergence between monocots and dicots (100–200 MYA), while six other gene pairs OsPUB31–OsPUB34, OsPUB2–OsPUB3, OsARM20–OsARM85, OsPUB35–OsPUB36, OsPUB21–OsPUB22, and OsARM77–OsARM81 showed a Ks value of 0.6, 0.54, 0.47, 0.49, 0.81, and 0.68 representing duplication at ~46.45, 41.75, 35.98, 37.49, 62.56, and 52.51 MYA after the divergence of poaceae from the common ancestor ~55–70 MYA.32 Interestingly, two of the segmentally duplicated pair in Arabidopsis (At1g22870–At1g71410 and At2g25130–At4g31890) and one in rice (OsARM33–OsARM34) with corresponding Ks values of 0.793, 0.536, and 0.06 present an evidence for a recent duplication at 1.7, 2.6, and 0.46 MYA.

Expression analysis of OsARM genes under abiotic stress conditionsThe microarray data for OsARM genes were generated using Affymetrix rice genome arrays for 7-day-old rice seedlings. Out of 158 genes, probe sets for 14 genes were not available on Affymetrix gene chip array. Unique probe sets were found for 105 genes, 2 for 32 genes, 3 for 6 genes, and 4 for 1 gene. In the case of multiple probe sets, one with the highest baseline expression in the array was chosen for the analysis. Expression profile of 144 OsARM genes was analysed under three abiotic stress conditions (salt, cold, and drought) (Figs 3 and 4 and Supplementary Table S5). After defining a criterion of fold change value of =2 (either up- or down-regulated) for experimental samples in comparison to control untreated 7-day-old seedlings, 36 OsARM genes showed differential expression, with 26 of them being up-regulated and 10 were found to be down-regulated in any of the above given conditions. Four genes (OsPUB33, OsPUB41, OsPUB2, and OsPUB39) were found to be up-regulated and a single gene OsARM14 was found to be down-regulated in all three stress conditions together. Notably, out of 26 up-regulated genes, 7 (OsPUB8, OsARM82, OsPUB22, OsARM54, OsARM11, OsPUB43, and OsPUB28) exhibited higher expression under drought stress, whereas 5 genes (OsARM1, OsPUB38, OsPUB40, OsPUB3, and OsPUB46) were up-regulated under salt stress, specifically. Eight genes (OsARM7, OsPUB30, OsPUB32, Oryzadillo, OsARM8, OsARM92, OsPUB5, and OsPUB6) were up-regulated under salt and drought stresses together. Whereas, only a single gene (OsARM13) was found to be up-regulated under cold and drought stresses together. Interestingly, one gene (OsPUB28) was found to be up-regulated in drought and down-regulated under cold stress simultaneously. Expression profiles of OsARM superfamily genes. Reproductive development comprising six stages of panicle [P1 (0–3 cm), P2 (3–5 cm), P3 (5–10 cm), P4 (10–15 cm), P5 (15–22 cm), and P6 (22–30 cm)] and five stages of seed [S1 (0–2 DAP), S2 (3–4 DAP), S3 (4–10 DAP), S4 (11–20 DAP), and S5 (21–29 DAP)] development. Clustering of the expression profile was done with log-transformed average values taking mature leaf as baseline. Three experimental stress conditions are denoted as CS, cold stress; DS, drought stress; SS, salt stress; and S, control, 7-day-old unstressed seedling. A gene is considered differentially expressed during reproductive development if up- or down-regulated at least 2-fold, with respect to three vegetative controls (mature leaf, root, and 7-day-old seedling) and with respect to 7-day-old unstressed seedling in the case of abiotic stress. The colour scale at the bottom of the heat map is given in log2 intensity value. (A) The expression profile for OsARM genes other than U-box.

Again, four genes (OsARM46, OsPUB21, OsPUB75, and OsARM87) were found to exhibit down-regulation together under drought and salt stress. Besides, a single gene (OsPUB28) was found to be specifically down-regulated under cold stress. Expression analysis of 14 OsARM genes, which could not be represented on the Affymetrix rice gene chip, was generated through MPSS. Many-fold up-regulation was observed for two genes (OsPUB45 and OsARM96) under all three abiotic stress conditions (Supple-mentary Table S6).3.5. Expression analysis of OsARM genes during developmentThe expression profile of OsARM genes during different stages of development was generated by microarray expression data obtained from Affymetrix rice whole-genome arrays. Corresponding probe sets for 144 OsARM genes were found on Affymetrix gene chip; hence, their expression profile could be analysed. For expression analysis during reproductive development, six panicle stages (P1–P6) and five seed (S1–S5) developmental stages were compared with three combined vegetative developmental stages, namely mature leaf, root, and seedling. Altogether, 89 OsARM genes were found to be expressing differentially (with fold change = 2), during vegetative and reproductive developmental stages (Figs 3 and 4 and Supplementary Table S7). Cluster analysis was performed for all 89 differentially expressed genes using the K-means clustering algorithm of ArrayAssist (Stratagene). Based on their amplitude of expression, these genes could be clustered into six groups (Fig. 5). Out of these 89 genes, 64 and 55 genes were up-regulated in panicle and seed tissues, respectively. High transcript level was observed commonly for 42 OsARM genes in both panicle and seed developmental stages. Exclusive up-regulation was observed for 22 genes during panicle and for 13 genes during seed developmental stages. A total of 15 and 28 genes were down-regulated during panicle and seed developmental stages, respectively. Eight genes (OsARM10, OsPUB74, OsPUB35, OsARM17, OsPUB22, OsARM94, OsPUB29, and OsPUB21) were commonly down-regulated in panicle and seed stages together. Only 7 genes showed exclusive down-regulation during panicle (OsARM19, OsARM1, OsARM2, OsARM39, OsARM80, OsPUB36, and OsARM15) and 20 genes (OsARM49, OsARM90, OsARM35, OsARM37, OsARM92, OsARM31, OsARM9, OsPUB56, OsPUB10, OsARM21, OsARM96, OsARM26, OsARM102, OsARM53, OsPUB44, OsARM46, OsARM59, OsPUB75, OsARM14, and OsPUB18) during seed development stages. To understand the relationship between abiotic stresses and plant development, we compared the expression profiles of Armadillo genes during various stages of development and under abiotic stress conditions. A total of 34 genes expressed differentially and exhibited overlapping expression under three abiotic stresses and reproductive developmental stages. Among these, 20 genes (OsPUB39, OsPUB5, OsPUB40, OsPUB46, OsARM13, OsPUB28, Oryzadillo, OsARM8, OsARM11, OsPUB43, OsPUB2, OsARM54, OsPUB41, OsPUB32, OsPUB33, OsPUB30, OsPUB38, OsPUB3, OsPUB8, and OsARM22) were found to be up-regulated in both developmental stages and stresses, whereas only one gene (OsPUB21) was exhibiting down-regulation under these conditions. Besides, a single gene (OsARM14), which was showing down-regulation under all three stress conditions and panicle stages at the same time, showed a considerable up-regulation under seed stages. In another instance, expression of (OsPUB33, OsPUB41, OsPUB2, and OsARM13) was found to be high and common in all developmental stages and stress conditions. Similarly, transcript levels of OsPUB28, which were showing up-regulation under drought stress and down-regulation under cold stress, were found to be high across all developmental conditions.

Validation of microarray expression by real-time Q-PCRAmong 36 OsARM genes expressing differentially under abiotic stress conditions, expression pattern of eight significant candidate genes was validated experimentally, employing quantitative real-time RT–PCR. All the eight genes showed anticipated expression pattern in most of the conditions and hence, could be correlated with microarray expression pattern. Similarly, differential expression of five genes under developmental stages was validated by Q-RT–PCR analysis. Statistical analysis also confirmed a positive correlation association between the microarray and real-time analysis (Figs 6 and 7 and Supplementary Table S8). However, the magnitude of expression varied in some samples. This kind of variation in expression by these two techniques, i.e. microarray and real-time PCR, has also been observed previously.33,34 The real-time PCR efficiency was also calculated and was found to be ~92%, which is in the acceptable range.

Expression analysis of duplicated genesTo study the evolution and response of the duplicated OsARM genes under abiotic stress and during developmental conditions, their expression profile was generated using microarray data. The signal intensity values for 12 segmentally duplicated genes in three vegetative stages, six panicle, five seed, and three abiotic stress conditions are represented as an area chart (Fig. 8). The expression analysis of six pairs of segmentally duplicated paralogous genes (OsPUB31–OsPUB34, OsPUB2–OsPUB3, OsPUB35–OsPUB36, OsARM77–OsARM81, OsPUB5–OsPUB6, and OsPUB19–OsPUB20) shows identical expression pattern throughout the range of stress and developmental conditions and thus shows retention of expression. However, the level of expression varied between these duplicated genes. Four pairs of duplicated genes (OsPUB33–OsPUB34, OsPUB39–OsPUB40, OsARM4–OsARM39, and OsPUB17–OsPUB18) exhibited pseudo-functionalization, due to negligible expression shown by one of the duplicated paired partners. The acquisition of new function and hence, neo-functionalization has been shown by two pairs of segmentally duplicated gene (OsARM13–OsARM49 and OsPUB21–OsPUB22) where both the duplicated partners display clearly distinguishable expression profile. Expression pattern of duplicated OsARM genes. The expression values of segmentally and tandemly duplicated genes obtained from microarray data were compared in leaf (L), root (R), and 7-day-old seedling (SDL) tissue, in various stages of panicle development (P1–P6), seed development (S1–S5), and under cold stress (CS), dehydration stress (DS), and salt stress (SS). Each area graph represents compilation of the mean normalized signal intensity values from 17 stages of development/stress conditions. Gene pairs have been grouped into retention of expression, neo-functionalization, and pseudo-functionalization based on their respective profile.Expression pattern of duplicated OsARM genes.

Cis-regulatory promoter elements of stress-inducible genesIn silico analysis of 1 kb upstream region (from translation start site) of the OsARM genes, which were differentially expressed under abiotic stresses revealed the presence of various regulatory elements, such as ABRE (Abscisic acid Responsive Element), ARE (Anaerobic Response Element), LTR (Low Temperature Res-ponsive), MBS (Myb-Binding Site), HSE (Heat Shock Element), GCN4 (endosperm expression), and TC-rich repeats (defence and stress response). These motifs have been previously known to regulate various stress and plant developmental responses.35,36 These motifs are present variably in the promoter of selected stress-induced OsARM genes. Most regulatory elements are present in the 1 kb upstream region of OsPUB2, which was commonly up-regulated in all the three abiotic stresses, with eight elements followed by OsPUB75 (down-regulated in salt and drought) with seven regulatory elements. All the OsARM genes included in the analysis contained at least four regulatory elements in their promoter region. A detailed analysis confirmed the relationship of gene response and presence of corresponding cis-element in their promoter region (Supplementary Fig. S2 and Supple-mentary Table S8).4. Discussion4.1. Organization of Armadillo genes in rice genomeARM repeat proteins display ubiquitous presence across eukaryotes and expanded rather dramatically in the land plant lineage. In the present study, extensive database searches facilitated identification of 158 Armadillo repeat proteins in rice genome. To identify orthologous clades among ARM proteins in rice and Arabidopsis, a combined phylogenetic tree was generated. Due to the presence of inconsistent number of ARM repeats and high degree of sequence divergence between them, it was difficult to deduce phylogenetic relationship between these proteins, which has also been observed previously.14 Assuming all ARM repeat proteins were originally derived from a common ancestor; the full-length protein sequence was used for phylogeny prediction. The phylogenetic analysis revealed the distribution of ARM proteins into 15 major clades. It was observed that the nodes at the base of the major groups were not well supported (low bootstrap score), but nodes at the base of many minor groups were robust (bootstrap values > 90%). A large number of ARM proteins from both rice and Arabidopsis were falling into the same subgroups based on their related domain composition, suggesting a common ancestry of ARMs in two diverse species. We also observed that 39 of 158 OsARM proteins outlined a monophyletic group (Group 15, Fig. 1) but no Arabidopsis specific subgroup was identified. The family size difference between Arabidopsis and rice may be the consequence of differential expansion among subfamilies. We also analysed domain contents and organizations of predicted OsARM repeat proteins. Besides ARM, there are various other accessory domains present in many proteins. As expected, proteins with similar domain organizations tend to be clustered together based on overall sequence homology. It was observed that 47 rice PUB/ARM proteins together with Arabidopsis orthologues are majorly dispersed in Groups 1–4 based on the kind and number of ARM repeats they possess. To examine the relationship among the large number of identified U-box/ARM proteins in Arabidopsis (41) and Oryza (47), the phylogenetic tree was constructed using complete protein sequences. The U-box proteins were divided into five distinct phylogenetic groups with 85–99% bootstrap support (Supplementary Fig. S1). Mudgil et al.14 in their study have predicted a unique N-terminal region in U-box, termed as UND domain in 17 of the U-box/ARM proteins in Arabidopsis. The ATPUB/ARM proteins having UND region were found to be closely coinciding with 17 OsPUB/ARM proteins. Sequence analysis also confirmed the presence of UND-like domain in these OsPUB proteins. Moreover, the number and arrangement of ARM repeats in closely associated PUB proteins in the phylogenetic map was also found to be identical. The division of PUBs in different groups indicates the evolutionary path taken up by these proteins due to the proliferation of ARM repeats within them. On the other hand, the phylogenetic comparison using only U-box domain sequence suggests an independent evolution of this domain in both species (data not shown). The similarity between wide range of domains and motifs found in the Arabidopsis and rice Armadillo members suggests that the domain/motif arrangement of most of the members of Armadillo family was established before the divergence of rice and Arabidopsis. In general, except U-box/ARM, which are interestingly extended in four different groups in the phylogenetic tree (Groups 1–4), HECT (Group 5), IBB (Group 6), C2/ARM (Group 7) proteins, the majority of OsARM genes do not show a distinct clade-wise grouping and many of the members did not fall in any of the defined clade. In agreement with previous studies, indicating conservation of the Arabidopsis Arabidillo-1, Arabidillo-2 genes across the land plants, which are involved in root architecture development, were found to be having a single orthologue in rice as Oryzadillo.37–39 Similar conservation was observed in the case of proteins containing distinguished domains such as PUB, C2 (Ca2+ binding motif), ARK (ARM repeat-containing kinesin), and Importin-a/ARM proteins between rice and Arabidopsis. Perhaps, the association of ARM repeats with several other functional domains might be allowing them to interact with various unrelated proteins.4.2. Potential role of OsARMs in abiotic stress and plant developmentOur microarray expression analysis of OsARM gene family confirmed the presence of some unique ARM repeat proteins, which might play significant role under abiotic stress and in plant development (Supple-mentary Tables S5 and S7). The expression analysis showed that a subset of OsARM genes was expressing differentially under abiotic stress conditions. Among these 36 differentially expressed genes, 21 consists a U-box domain. Specifically, in the plant system, regulated protein degradation has been implicated in a number of pathways as diverse as growth and development, light and hormonal signalling, embryogenesis, leaf senescence, and biotic and abiotic stress.40–45 This association of large number of U-box proteins with ARM repeats suggests a significant role of these repeats in protein degradation and key regulatory pathways, including stress signalling. This statement was further supported by the fact that several Arabidopsis ARM/U-box proteins were also confirmed to be expressing in different tissues under varying growth conditions.16 Furthermore, it may be speculated that the ARM repeats may mediate interactions with large number of proteins, conferring substrate versatility to the proteasomal degradation pathway.The overall up-regulation under abiotic stress and developmental conditions has been observed in OsPUB33, whereas its orthologue ATPUB23 has been established to involve in response to water stress and as a negative regulator of PAMP-triggered immunity.46,47Another OsARM gene (OsPUB5) that showed up-regulation under drought and salt stress conditions has its functionally characterized orthologue in Arabidopsis (At1g10560) reported to be involved in plant ABA response.44 Further, sole representative of LRR/ARM/F-box domain containing ARABIDILLO-1,-2,Oryzadillo was also found to be many-fold up-regulated under salt and drought conditions. Recent finding suggests that homologues of these proteins are conserved across plants species exhibiting novel and overlapping functions.37,38 Interestingly, some of the OsARMs (OsPUB28, OsARM14, OsPUB75) were found to be showing elevated expression under developmental conditions but a significant down-regulation under stress conditions. Another U-box/ARM gene (OsPUB6), which was found to be highly, expressed under drought and salt stress conditions in the microarray analysis, share sequence similarity with Arabidopsis AtPUB18. In Arabidopsis, the role of PUB18 has been established in salt and ABA-mediated drought stress response.13 A different OsPUB/ARM (OsPUB8), found to be induced under drought stress, reproductive, and developmental conditions, is an orthologue of Arabidopsis ATPUB9, which regulates plant ABA response.48 Similarity in the expression pattern among orthologous group of genes suggests that closely related genes are not evolving separately and can be represented as functional orthologue both in rice (monocot) and in Arabidopsis (dicot).Furthermore, two of the OsARM family genes (OsARM45 and OsARM87) harbour C2 domain, specifically known to be involved in the calcium signalling pathways.49 In the expression analysis, OsARM87 was found to be showing significant down-regulation under drought and salt stress conditions; however, OsARM45 did not show differential expression under any of the conditions but might be involved in the interaction with microtubules, since a cytoskeletal role has been predicted for its orthologue ATCSI1/C2 in Arabidopsis.50 This can also be speculated that the ARM/C2 proteins possibly be involved in the interaction with the target proteins, thereby localizing them to the membrane. Further, Importin-a/ARM proteins are known to aid in localizing cNLS (classical Nuclear Localization Signal) containing proteins from cytoplasm into the nucleus.51 Expression analysis showed down-regulation of IBB-domain containing (OsARM2) gene in the panicle and up-regulation in seed stages, although it was not found to be expressed under any of the stress conditions. In Arabidopsis, ARM/BTB/POZ domain containing protein ARIA (ARM repeat protein interacting with ABF2) has been implicated in ABA-dependent gene expression.7 Whereas in rice, the transcript levels of ARIA orthologue (OsARM42) were found significantly high under all developmental conditions, but no stress-responsive expression was found. Apart from abiotic stress-regulated genes, a large subset of ARM proteins (89) were found to be differentially regulated under developmental stages (Supple-mentary Table S7). Many of these showed preferential accumulation of transcripts in given developmental stages. The comparison of specific regulation of these genes under vegetative and seed developmental stages has allowed segregation of transcripts in six co-expression groups (Fig. 5). The number of genes varied from 5 (cluster IV) to 23 (cluster VI) in these clusters. Cluster I includes 18 ARM genes, which are highly expressed, and cluster V includes 5 low expressing ARM genes in all the developmental stages analysed. Eleven genes in cluster II also exhibited lower expression in all the conditions analysed. The possible explanation for low expressing OsARM genes in various developmental stages analysed might be due to their expression in specific cell-type(s) or tissue/condition other than those included in this study. However, other ARM genes exhibited transcript abundance in one or more distinct developmental stages analysed. Twelve genes in cluster III were expressed preferentially in stages of panicle development and their expression was lower in seed development stages. Eleven ARM genes in cluster II were preferentially expressing during P3, P4 and S1, S2 stages, but their expression was restricted, specifically during P5 stages. These results suggest the involvement of ARMs in various stress and developmental events in rice.Furthermore, we found that six pairs of segmentally duplicated genes were also expressing differentially under abiotic stress conditions (Supplementary Table S10). Although, five of these duplicated pairs were showing similar expression under the same stress conditions, one pair (OsPUB21–OsPUB22) showed highly diverged expression patterns as the former was up-regulated under drought and the latter was down-regulated in the same condition. For OsPUB45, expression was analysed in MPSS and it was found to be up-regulated under stress conditions. It has been found that the independent individual ARM repeats are short of definite structure and function; however, the presence of multiple repeats in tandem provides a definite structural and functional composure to the repeat proteins, which are mostly associated with some other functional domain.11 Nevertheless, our expression analysis revealed many ARM repeat proteins without any associated domain to be differentially regulated under stress conditions, which might indicate a plant-specific functional role for them during stress and developmental conditions.4.3. Cis-regulatory elements in the promoter of OsARM genesWe could identify several stress-responsive motifs in the promoter region of abiotic stress-inducible OsARM genes. Cis-acting elements have been previously known to control the molecular processes of various plant stress and developmental responses.52–56 For example, in OsARM13 and OsPUB2, which were found to be highly expressed under cold and drought stresses, motifs such as ABRE, HSE, MBS, and LTR were found to be present variably. Interestingly, the promoter region of the OsPUB75 gene, which has been down-regulated under seed stages, stress, and drought conditions, contains several stress and developmental-related cis-elements. Sequence elements such as GCN4 and SKN-1 essential for endosperm-specific expression were identified at multiple locations in the 1 kb upstream regions of seven genes. Transcript level of these genes under developmental conditions was also found to be many-fold high in the expression analysis. Further, TC-rich repeat responsible for defence and stress responses have been found in the promoter region of three genes, suggesting their possible role during these conditions.4.4. Duplication events contributed to the proliferation and functional diversification of OsARMs in riceA number of OsARM genes were found to be duplicated either segmentally (~10%) or in tandem (~19%), suggesting a role of gene duplication in the expansion and evolution of this gene family in rice genome. Gene duplication serves as a mechanism to increase functional diversity. Duplication events often lead to diversification of gene function such as neo-functionalization or pseudo-functionalization.57,58 To know the functional redundancy/diversification of duplicated ARM genes, the expression profiles were generated for 12 pairs of duplicated genes, covering the spectrum of abiotic stresses as well as vegetative and reproductive developmental stages (Fig. 8).Here, parallel retention (retention of expression) of a stress response in six pairs of duplicated genes with some quantitative differences indicates that they maintain similar stress response as their ancestor. One possible explanation for this high rate of retention is that the duplicate genes we analysed tend to be derived from more recent duplication events. Since there is a direct relationship between the degree of expression divergence of duplicated genes and their divergence times,59 the degree of stress-response change is most likely correlated with the age of gene duplication events as well. The relative frequency analysis of paralogous genes using synonymous substitution rate Ks showed that younger duplicate genes were more likely to be retained during stress responses and thus exhibits retention of expression. Intriguingly, we found that the gene pair (OsARM13–OsARM49) with the highest Ks rate (1.15) has been predicted to be the earliest diverging (~88.65 MYA) followed by (OsPUB21–OsPUB22) with the Ks rate (0.813) and diverging (~62.56 MYA) exhibited neo-functionalization. Hence, the elevated rate of duplication and retention of stress responses by these genes in ARM family suggests that they might be crucial for responses to stress. The Ka/Ks analysis showed that the Armadillo repeats are undergoing purifying selection in both species, as all the segmentally duplicated Armadillo pairs from Arabidopsis and rice showed Ka/Ks < 1.5. ConclusionThe present study provides a comprehensive account of the Armadillo gene family in rice. Protein sequence and phylogenetic analysis revealed the evolutionary conservation of this group of proteins across different plant species. Several developmental stage-specific, abiotic stress-responsive ARM genes belonging to various groups have been identified. The results further encourage stress and developmental-specific functional analysis of a few members of this gene family in crop plant rice and their further characterization for agricultural importance.Supplementary dataSupplementary Data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work is partially supported by internal grants of University of Delhi and Department of Biotechnology (DBT) India to GKP.

IntroductionProkaryotic genomes are extremely diverse in terms of their nucleotide and oligonucleotide composition as well as presence of various forms of sequence repeats and patterns that can affect physical properties of the DNA molecule. For example, Ussery et al.1 analysed oligopurine/oligopyrimidine runs and alternating purine/pyrimidine patterns in prokaryotic genomes and reported large differences among different organisms. Alternating purine/pyrimidine patterns promote Z-DNA conformation, whereas oligopurine/oligopurimidine runs can facilitate formation of A-DNA or H-DNA.2 They found that differences among different prokaryotes were related to optimal growth temperature (OGT) and pathogenicity, possibly as a result of structural adaptations of DNA of these organisms.3 In another example, potential G-DNA-forming sequences were found to occur at vastly different frequencies in different prokaryotic genomes.4 The amount of intrinsic DNA curvature in promoter regions was found to be related to OGT.5 Our own analysis of more than 1000 prokaryotic chromosomes suggested a large variance among different genomes in DNA curvature-related 10–11 bp sequence periodicity, which could reflect differences in chromosomal structure.6 The presence of long simple sequence repeats (SSRs) in a genome is strongly correlated with the organism's dependence on a eukaryotic host.7 These results indicate a significant variance of general DNA properties among different prokaryotes, which in some cases appear to be related to the organisms' habitats and lifestyles.Advances in DNA sequencing technologies over the past decades led to a situation where complete genomes are available for many microbes about which very little is known apart from the information that can be derived from the genomic DNA sequence. In particular, despite the diversity of DNA properties mentioned above, our knowledge about chromosome structure and organization in the cell is limited to studies of a few model organisms. While it is reasonable to assume that the general model of bacterial nucleoid composed of dynamic, supercoiled DNA loops stabilized by nucleoid-associated proteins is probably universal,8,9 the differences in DNA sequence properties suggest that subtle variations may exist among bacteria with completely sequenced genomes. Such differences in physical characteristics of the chromosomes could play roles in the organisms' physiology and adaptations to their particular environments.We present a survey of local sequence patterns in prokaryotic genomes with a potential to generate local irregularities in DNA structure. Our goal was to assess diversity of the prokaryotic genomes in terms of abundance of sequence patterns indicative of possible structural transitions in the DNA molecule. While physiological functions of sequence patterns promoting non-canonical DNA conformations and sequence patterns promoting conformational transitions in DNA are not well understood, there is increasing evidence that they can play important roles. For example, SSRs have been implicated in phase variation, a mechanism that promotes reversible switching of phenotypes.10,11 Palindromes and close inverted repeats form stem-loop structures in RNA, which can function in transcription terminators and riboswitches, and they can promote formation of cruciform structures in DNA, which influence replication, regulation of gene expression, and recombination.12 Close direct and inverted repeats have mutagenic effects on DNA.13–16 Specific guanine-rich patterns can promote formation of quadruplex G-DNA.17–19 The G-DNA formation in telomeres is well documented, but G-DNA may also play a role in gene expression, replication, recombination, and integration of viruses.19–23 Alternating purine–pyrimidine patterns can under favourable conditions promote transitions to the Z-DNA conformation, while oligopurine/oligopyrimidine runs promote formation of A-DNA or triple-stranded H-DNA.2,24–28 Transient formation of left-handed Z-DNA can influence transcription and promote genome instability,28–31 and indirect evidence suggests similar roles for triple-helical H-DNA.26,32 Intrinsic DNA curvature is largely related to periodic spacings of A-tracts and can influence DNA–protein interactions in regulatory regions, aid DNA compaction in the nucleoid, and possibly promote a particular mode of supercoiling.5,33,34 Although the physiological significance of the unusual DNA conformations in different organisms is still poorly understood, it is reasonable to ask how common the sequence patterns that promote their formation are in different genomes because their unusually high or low occurrence may indicate its functional importance.Our present work differs from earlier similar surveys not only by investigating a wider range of sequence patterns in a large number of genomes but also by using a more realistic null model to assess significant anomalies. Significant deviations from expected pattern occurrences could indicate that the pattern per se is subject to selective constraint and therefore functionally significant in a given organism but the pattern over- or under-representation could also arise as a tolerated artefact of other biases affecting the DNA sequence. Our null model reflects the genome-specific nearest neighbour preferences, codon biases, and heterogeneity of the DNA sequence; therefore, deviations from expected occurrences are more likely to reflect their functional significance of the investigated sequence patterns. We interpret our results in terms of relationships with organisms' habitats, phylogenetic classifications, and other characteristics.2. Materials and methods2.1. Data setsComplete prokaryotic genomes were downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) ftp server (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/Bacteria/). Pattern representations were assessed for the complete genomes, as well as for 1 Mb segments randomly selected from each genome. The purpose of the latter approach was to reduce the effect of statistical artefacts from comparing sequences of different sizes. The results presented in this paper are based on the 1 Mb segments, while the data for the complete genomes are shown in the Supplementary data (Supplementary Tables S5–S7). Genomes smaller than 1 Mb were excluded from the analysis. Our final data set included 1424 complete genomes of 941 species, 519 genera, and 37 phyla or subphyla (Supplementary Table S1). We used the existing annotation (the ‘CDS’ keywords) to differentiate protein-coding and non-coding sequences.The OGT and oxygen requirement classifications for each genome were obtained from the Genomes Online Database (http://www.genomesonline.org).35 Among the 1424 complete genomes, 1378 genomes have the OGT classification available and 1304 genomes have the oxygen requirement classification available. To eliminate sampling biases towards genera represented by many completely sequenced genomes, we performed statistical assessments at the level of genera rather than individual genomes. Accordingly, we apply a single classification to each genus, which is determined by the majority of species within the genus. This procedure yielded OGT classification for 498 genera (including 18 psychrophiles and psychrotolerant organisms, 382 mesophiles, 72 thermophiles, and 26 hyperthermophiles) and oxygen requirement classification for 465 genera (159 anaerobes, 202 aerobes, 95 facultative, and 9 microaerophilic organisms).2.2. Patterns of interestTable 1 provides a list of sequence patterns whose occurrences in prokaryotic genomes were investigated in this work. The patterns were selected based on the available information about sequences that promote various forms of structural transitions or mutations in DNA under favourable circumstances. However, because exact rules governing structural transitions in DNA are not fully understood, we use multiple forms of similar patterns, in most cases pertaining to varying length of the pattern and number of tolerated mismatches. The specific parameters used in the definition of the patterns were in part dictated by the size of the analysed genomes in order to obtain sufficient data sample for statistical evaluations. List of sequence patterns investigated in this workaSegments matching the sequence pattern are underscored, mismatches are shaded, and symmetrical segments are separated by a vertical dashed line.List of sequence patterns investigated in this workaSegments matching the sequence pattern are underscored, mismatches are shaded, and symmetrical segments are separated by a vertical dashed line.It is worthwhile to note that we are not aiming to predict accurately every site in the genome that is likely to undergo a conformational transition under favourable conditions. We are only asking how common are sequences favouring certain structural transitions in each genome and whether their frequency could be indicative of selective constraints acting on such sequences. At the same time, the extensive simulations with randomized genomes described below require that the patterns are sufficiently simple that they can be identified quickly. Given this limitation, we selected the sequence patterns to be approximately representative of the sequences known to undergo the specific structural transitions under favourable conditions.2.3. Evaluation of pattern representationsPattern Locator36 was used to count loci in each analysed sequence that matched the sequence pattern at hand (the observed count). The expected count of matching loci was determined as the average number of matching loci in 20 randomized sequences. The randomized sequences were generated by the ‘m1c1’ model of the Genome Randomizer software previously developed in our laboratory37 (available for download at http://www.cmbl.uga.edu/software.html). In this model, the analysed sequence is first divided into segments corresponding to annotated protein-coding genes and intergenic regions. For each intergenic segment, a random sequence of the same length is generated as the first-order Markov chain, thus preserving the nucleotide and dinucleotide composition of that specific intergenic segment. Analogously, a random sequence is generated for each gene as a first-order Markov chain using the codon alphabet. The final randomized genome is constructed by reassembling the randomized genes and intergenic segments in their original order. The resulting randomized sequence mimics not only the overall nucleotide, dinucleotide, and codon frequencies of the complete genome but rather of each individual gene and intergenic region. Thus, the null model incorporates the compositional heterogeneity of the genomic sequence at the scale of individual genes. Because we factor the codon usage biases, dinucleotide preferences, and differences between protein-coding and non-coding sequences into the null model, we are more likely to detect anomalous usage of sequence patterns that arises from direct selection on the sequence patterns as opposed to anomalous usage that is a simple consequence of codon or dinucleotide biases characteristic of the particular genome or its various segments. As a result, our assessments are more likely to reflect selective constraints and functional significance of the analysed sequence pattern than assessments utilizing a simpler null model.The pattern representations are classified into nine levels, from -4 (extremely under-represented), through 0 (normally represented) to +4 (extremely over-represented) based on the P-value and the observed/expected ratio (Supplementary Table S8). We use the combination of the two criteria because the observed/expected ratio is independent of the sample size and measures the deviation from the null model in more absolute terms but does not directly provide assessment of statistical significance. Using P-value alone could emphasize small deviations in large samples (e.g. large genomes or more frequent patterns), whereas using the observed/expected ratio alone could lead to over-interpretation of results that lack statistical significance. Assigning representation categories based on both criteria is a compromise designed to avoid these potential pitfalls. The P-values are assessed based on an assumption that the counts of matching loci follow the Poisson distribution. This is a reasonable approximation for long sequences and patterns that occur at low frequencies.Statistical assessments could be skewed by inclusion of observations that are not independent, such as several closely related genomes (e.g. different strains of the same species or closely related species), which are likely to feature similar levels of representations of various sequence patterns simply as a result of insufficient evolutionary divergence. To reduce the effect of dependent observations resulting from insufficient divergence, we combined the results for all genomes of the same genus into a single ‘observation’ by averaging pattern representation categories for all available genomes belonging to that genus.3. Results3.1. Simple sequence repeatsA strong avoidance of tandem repeats of mono-, di-, and tri-nucleotides spreads over all phyla, especially in the whole genome and protein-coding regions, while tandem repeats of longer oligomers are generally normally represented and sometimes weakly over-represented (Table 2 and Supplementary Table S9). However, tandem repeats of mono-, di-, and tri-nucleotides are generally less suppressed in the intergenic regions when compared with protein-coding regions (Supplementary Tables S10 and S11). Trichodesmium erythraeum and Methanosphaera stadtmanae are extreme examples with strongly over-represented mono-nucleotide repeats 1n8 (a single nucleotide repeated =8 times) in the intergenic regions (P < 10-12), but normally represented in the whole genome and extremely under-represented in the protein-coding regions. Most Chlorobi (6 species out of 10) also tend to have over-represented 1n8 pattern in the intergenic regions. Tandem repeats of longer oligonucleotides (6–11 bp) are extremely over-represented in intergenic regions as well as complete genomes of Methanococcus voltae, Methanococcus aeolicus, and Natrialba magadii (and to a lesser extent in several other genomes) but not in the protein-coding segments (Supplementary Tables S2–S4).

Numbers in the second row indicate the number of genera available for each phylum. Only phyla represented by three or more genera are shown.Mono- and dinucleotide repeats are about equally suppressed in psychrophiles, mesophiles, thermophiles, and hyperthermophiles (Table 3 and Supplementary Table S12). However, the suppression of trinucleotide tandem repeats is more pronounced in thermophiles and hyperthermophiles than in mesophiles and psychrophiles (significant at P < 10-5; the P-value is based on Fisher's exact test for 2-by-2 contingency tables). Oxygen requirement appears to have no relationship to tandem repeat representations.

See Supplementary Table S5 for coloured version of this table.3.2. Close direct repeatsIn general, close direct repeats are normally represented or slightly over-represented in complete genomes of most prokaryotes and in the intergenic regions, and they are mostly normally represented in genes (Supplementary Tables S9–S11). The cd10g50 repeats (two copies of the same 10-mer separated by =50 nucleotides) exhibit the strongest trends among the investigated direct repeat structures. They are mostly over-represented in the intergenic regions, weakly under-represented in protein-coding regions, and normally represented in the whole genome. It is interesting to note the contrast in representations of close pairs of 10 bp repeats (cd10g50) and multiple close copies of shorter oligonucleotides (4n6g12, 6n6g24, 8n4g24). While the former are often strongly over-represented in intergenic regions and normally represented to weakly under-represented in genes, the latter are normally represented or moderately over-represented in both genes and intergenic regions (Supplementary Tables S10 and S11).Representations of close direct repeats exhibit clear negative trends with increasing OGT (Table 3 and Supplementary Table S12). For example, clustered repeats 8n4g24 (at least four copies of the same octamer separated by gaps of no more than 24 bp) are over-represented in ~50% of psychrophiles and mesophiles but in few thermophiles and virtually no hyperthermophiles (Fig. 1; the difference is significant at P < 10-6). A significant decrease in pattern representations with increasing OGT is seen also for patterns 6n6g24 and8n4g24, indicating a general trend of lower local repetitiveness in thermophiles and hyperthermophiles. There is no clear relationship between the representation of close direct repeats and oxygen requirement. Comparison of representations of selected patterns in different OGT classes. Bars show the percentage of species in each OGT class which have the given pattern under-represented, normally represented, or over-represented. The pattern is considered over-represented if the P-value is <10-4 and observed to expected ratio >1.10 (representation level 2 or higher) for majority of the complete genomes available for that genera, it is deemed under-represented if the P-value is <10-4 and observed to expected ratio <0.91, and normally represented otherwise. See Materials and methods and Supplementary Table S8. The four patterns for which the data are shown are representative of close repeat structures (8n4g24, top left), palindromes and close inverted repeats (pals9g12, top right), potential Z-DNA-promoting patterns (RY12, bottom left), and DNA bending pattrens (bend60w100, bottom right). See Table 1 for description of the pattern codes.Comparison of representations of selected patterns in different OGT classes.

See Table 1 for description of the pattern codes.3.3. Palindromes and inverted repeatsPalindromes and inverted repeats are strongly over-represented in the complete genomes across almost all bacterial phyla but less so in archaea and Aquificales (Table 2 and Supplementary Table S9). There are few organisms that strongly avoid palindromes in protein-coding regions and the complete genomes, including cyanobacteria Synechosystis and Thermosynechococcus (Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). Representations of palindromes and close inverted repeats in protein-coding sequences vary significantly among different genera, from extremely over-represented (e.g. Cyanobacterium, Thermoanaerobacter, Allivibrio, Azobacteroides) to strongly suppressed (e.g. Rhodomicrobium, Phenylobacterium, Jannaschia, Clavibacter). Many a-proteobacteria exhibit some level of palindrome suppression. Clavibacter is an outlier among Actinobacteria, which generally tend to have palindromes normally represented and in some cases over-represented (Supplementary Table S3).A comparison between genes and intergenic regions shows that inverted repeats are almost invariably over-represented in the intergenic regions and generally normally represented in the protein-coding regions (Supplementary Tables S3 and S4). The high concentration of palindromes and inverted repeats in the intergenic region is not necessarily surprising because of their function in transcription termination and as regulatory elements, which are generally located outside the protein-coding segments of genes.There is a general trend of decreasing representations of palindromes and inverted repeats with increasing OGT (Fig. 1, Table 3, and Supplementary Table S12). In contrast, there is only a weak or no relationship between representations of palindromes and oxygen requirement.3.4. Oligopurine/oligopyrimidine runs and triplex DNA-promoting patternsH-DNA triplexes form under favourable conditions in oligopurine/oligopyrimidine sequences with a mirror symmetry,24,26 whereas some oligopurine/oligopyrimidine segments can also promote formation of A-like DNA.2 Mirror repeats and extended oligopurine/oligopyrimidine stretches are generally normally represented in complete genomes of most phyla (Table 2 and Supplementary Table S9), with moderate over-representations in some Cyanobacteria (Anabaena, Nostoc, Microcystis, Trichodesmium), Chloroflexi (Chloroflexus and Roseiflexus), Planctomycetes (Isosphaera), and Verrucomicrobia (Methylacidiphilum) (Supplementary Table S2). However, oligopurine and oligopyrimidine stretches, mainly patterns R15 and R30e3, are suppressed in complete genomes of some phyla. Separate analysis of protein-coding and non-coding regions shows that oligopurine/oligopyrimidine stretches tend to be normally represented in intergenic regions and that anomalous representations of these patterns in some phyla arise from biases in protein-coding segments (Supplementary Tables S10 and S11).Suppression of oligopurine/oligopyrimidine stretches, especially R15, is most common among hyperthermophiles, whereas mesophiles and psychrophiles exhibit normal representations of these patterns (Table 3 and Supplementary Table S12). The R15 pattern is also more likely to be under-represented in anaerobes than in aerobes (Table 3, Supplementary Table S12, and Supplementary Fig. S1). On the other hand, mirror repeats cm10g50 and mirs12g20 are more likely to be over-represented in the coding regions of anaerobes than aerobes (Supplementary Table S13 and Supplementary Fig. S2).3.5. Guanine-rich patterns and G-DNA-promoting sequencesFormation of intrastrand G-DNA quadruplex is promoted by clustered short runs of guanine.17–19 We investigated several forms of such G-rich clusters (G-patterns; Table 1), among which the GGG4g6 pattern (four G-triplets separated by gaps of no more than six nucleotides) represents best the sequences known to form G-quadruplexes.2,38,39 In general, the G-patterns are normally represented in prokaryotic genomes (Table 2 and Supplementary Table S9). GG dimer clusters (GG8g4, eight or more GG dimers separated by =4 nucleotides from each other) tend to be moderately over-represented in protein-coding regions of a-, ß-, and d-proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Deincoccus-Thermus group, and Planctomycetes (especially for Isosphaera) (Supplementary Table S10). The other guanine patterns are generally normally represented with most notable exceptions among Cyanobacteria where species of Microcystis, Anabaena, and Nostoc feature extreme over-representation of all forms of G-patterns (Supplementary Table S2). The planctomycete Isosphaera pallida also has G-patterns strongly over-represented. With these few exceptions, the GGG4g6 pattern, which is most directly related to G-DNA formation, is mostly normally represented or slightly under-represented, suggesting that if G-DNA-promoting sequences have significant physiological roles in bacteria, such roles are probably limited to only a few species or genera.Most organisms with over-represented GG8g4 pattern are aerobes, whereas virtually no anaerobes have excess of GG8g4 (Supplementary Fig. S1). However, over-represented GG8g4 pattern could also reflect excess of glycine-rich segments (encoded by the GGN codons) or proline-rich segments (encoded by CCN with GG dinucleotides in the complementary strand) in proteins, whereas the GGG4g6 does not exhibit a relationship with oxygen requirement. There is no apparent relationship between G-pattern representations and the OGT (Table 3 and Supplementary Table S12).3.6. Z-DNA-promoting patternsThe left-handed Z-DNA conformation is most commonly adopted by runs of alternating G–C and more generally by alternating purine–pyrimidine (RY) patterns. The RY patterns are often under-represented but to different extent in different phyla—most strongly in a-, ß-, and <U+03B3>-proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Chlorobi, Chloroflexi, and Planctomycetes (Table 2 and Supplementary Table S9). In contrast, the RY patterns are normally represented in Fusobacteria, Aquificales, and Thermotogae and even slightly over-represented in Chlamydiae. In general, the suppression of RY patterns is stronger in protein-coding regions, although several phyla exhibit significant RY pattern suppression in intergenic regions as well (Supplementary Tables S10 and S11). Interestingly, Treponema pallidum and Treponema paraluiscuniculi exhibit a strong over-representation of all forms of RY patterns, whereas other spirochaetes, including other species of Treponema, have RY patterns normally represented or weakly under-represented. Similar extreme over-representation of RY patterns applies to Helicobacter felis and to a lesser extent to Helicobacter bizzozeronii but not to other Helicobacter species. The archaeon Thermofilum pendens also exhibits a strong over-representation of RY patterns and several other genomes show a weaker RY-pattern over-representation (Supplementary Table S2).We used Pattern Locator and associated software tools36,40 (http://www.cmbl.uga.edu/software/patloc.html) to investigate in detail the distribution of RY patterns in several specific genomes, including the above-mentioned genomes with over-represented RY patterns. We did not find any significant anomalies in the distribution of the RY patterns with respect to the origin or terminus of replication, with respect to the 3' ends of genes (stop codons), or any strong association with a particular class of genes. However, we noted increased numbers of RY patterns overlapping with start codons, such that the ATG/GTG start codons are embedded in RY patterns which sometimes extend several codons deep into the protein-coding region (Supplementary Fig. S3). This tendency appears to be widespread among prokaryotic genomes. However, comparison between ATG and GTG triplets that function as start codons and those that are not translation start sites shows no significant difference in fractions of ATG/GTG triplets overlapping with extended RY patterns between the two groups (Supplementary Table S18). This suggests that the increased number of RY patterns overlapping with translation start sites is not directly related to the translation but rather a simple consequence of ATG and GTG themselves having the form of a short RY pattern (RYR), thus increasing the likelihood of finding a longer RY pattern at the same site.Representations of RY patterns tend to increase with increasing OGT (Table 3 and Supplementary Table S12). For example, the pattern RY12 is under-represented in 60% of psychrophiles, 50% of mesophiles, ~25% of thermophiles but only a single hyperthermophilic genus, Thermaerobacter (Fig. 1; significant at P < 10-6).Among all analysed sequence patterns, the RY patterns exhibit the most notable trend with respect to the level of oxygen requirement (Table 3 and Supplementary Table S12). Interestingly, facultative species exhibit the strongest suppression of RY patterns followed by aerobes, whereas RY pattern representations in anaerobes and microaerophilic organisms are close to normal (see Supplementary Fig. S1c for pattern RY12). The same trend was observed when the comparisons between aerobes and anaerobes were restricted to mesophiles, or bacteria (Supplementary Tables S15 and S17), indicating that the relationship between RY patterns and oxygen requirement cannot be attributed to increased number of anaerobes among thermophiles or different representations of anaerobes and aerobes among bacteria and archaea.3.7. Patterns contributing to DNA curvatureSequence patterns related to DNA curvature (the bend-patterns) range generally from normal to over-represented. The over-representation is most pronounced in <U+025B>-proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, Deferribacteres, and Thermotogae (Table 2 and Supplementary Table S8). This trend applies to both protein-coding and intergenic regions, although differences among phyla are more prominent in protein-coding regions (Supplementary Tables S9 and S11). At the opposite extreme, Mycoplasma haemofelis, Mycoplasma penetrans, Cytophaga hutchinsonii, and Pelagibacter sp. show moderate to strong suppression of DNA bends in their genomes (Supplementary Table S2). The genus Mycoplasma is particularly interesting, featuring species with extreme over-representation of DNA bends as well as strong under-representation. This is consistent with our previous report that various genome properties among Mycoplasma vary more than in other genera.37 In addition, C. hutchinsonii and Pelagibacter sp. feature extreme suppression of bend-patterns in protein-coding regions but not in intergenic regions (Supplementary Tables S3 and S4).With respect to OGT, intrinsic DNA bends tend to be more over-represented in hyperthermophiles and thermophiles than in mesophiles and psychrophiles (Table 3 and Fig. 1). Surprisingly, the number of genera with over-represented bend-patterns in protein-coding segments increases with increasing OGT in protein-coding regions but decreases for bend-patterns in non-coding regions (Supplementary Fig. S4). The same trend is shown in Supplementary Fig. S5, where genomes of thermophiles and hyperthermophiles tend to have more protein-coding bends than intergenic bends, whereas the opposite is true for most psychrophiles. Statistical significance of this trend has been confirmed by the Mann–Whitney U-test (Supplementary Table S19).With respect to oxygen requirement, representation of DNA bending patterns tends to decrease with the increasing level of oxygen (Table 3 and Supplementary Table S12). Specifically, the bend-patterns tend to be over-represented in anaerobes and microaerophiles but not in aerobes. For example, the pattern bend60w100 is over-represented in half of the anaerobes, but <20% of aerobes (Supplementary Fig. 1; significant at P < 10-6). This trend holds when the data are restricted to mesophiles or thermophiles, suggesting that the trend with respect to oxygen requirement is independent of the trend with respect to OGT (Supplementary Tables S15 and S16).4. Discussion4.1. Comparisons with previous workThe work presented here differs from similar earlier surveys in scope (both the number of genomes used in the analysis and the number of different types of sequence patterns investigated) as well as methodology. The most important methodological difference is in the null model used to assess whether a sequence pattern is anomalously represented in a given genome. Our null model takes into account the nearest-neighbour biases and codon usage propensities of all individual genes and intergenic regions, which likely have separate underlying causes not related to potential functional significance of the investigated sequence patterns. In terms of our results, one significant difference relative to earlier work concerns representations of alternating purine–pyrimidine patterns. Bohlin et al.3 reported that alternating RY patterns were generally suppressed across different phyla except ß-proteobactria, where they were mostly over-represented, with a particularly strong surplus of RY patterns in Burkholderia. These authors used the i.i.d. model (independently drawn and independently distributed letters) as a benchmark. Using our more realistic null model, we found that ß-proteobactria including Burkholderia species suppress the RY patterns to the same extent as other bacteria (Table 2 and Supplementary Tables S2 and S9). We therefore conclude that the increased amount of RY patterns in ß-proteobactria arises from two opposite evolutionary constraints: biased codon and dinucleotide usages that favour RY-patterns and are specific for ß-proteobactria, which are partially offset by suppression of long RY-patterns, which is rather universal among bacterial genomes. Similarly, the over-representation of oligopurine/oligopyrimidine stretches reported by Bohlin et al. for some phyla arises from the biases at the level of dinucleotide and codon usages, as we found the oligopurine/oligopyrimidine stretches normally represented or under-represented in all phyla (Table 2 and Supplementary Table S9).For SSRs, our results are consistent with previous works including our own survey of SSRs in prokaryotic genomes.7 In particular, our present data confirm that SSR comprised tandem repeats of very short units (mono-, di-, and trinucleotides; patterns 1n8, 2n5, and 3n4) tend to be strongly suppressed in prokaryotic genomes, while repeats of longer units (tetranucleotides through 11-mers) tend to be normally represented or weakly over-represented (Table 2 and Supplementary Table S9). This strong difference points to likely functional difference between tandem repeats of very short (1–3 bp) and longer (4–11 bp) units. Our present results differ from the earlier data in that we previously included repeats of tetranucleotides in the same group as mono-, di, and trinucleotides,7 while the present results indicate that tetranucleotide SSRs may be more accurately included in the same group as SSRs composed of pentanucleotides and longer units, which are generally not suppressed. This result suggests that tandem repeats of tetranucleotides and longer units may not have the same harmful effects as repeats of mono-, di-, and trinucleotides. The difference between tandem repeats of very short units (1–3 bp) and longer units (=4 bp) could also arise from properties of the methyl-directed repair pathway, which is very efficient in repairing heterologous loops of 1–3 bp, but its efficiency dramatically drops as the length of the loop increases.41,42Ladoukakis and Eyre-Walker43 reported a small but significant excess of short inverted repeats (6–9 bp) in protein-coding sequences and proffered that the inverted repeats could arise by sequence-directed mutagenesis where an imperfect palindrome or inverted repeat converts to a perfect one due to template switching during replication.15 Their result is consistent with that of Katz and Burge,44 who found that native mRNA sequences in many bacterial genomes possess a significantly higher potential to form stable RNA secondary structures than random sequences preserving the codon usage, dinucleotide frequencies, and the protein sequences encoded by the native mRNAs. Katz and Burge proposed that the excess of base pairing in mRNA molecules is due to selection for stable mRNAs. We analysed occurrences of slightly larger palindromes than Ladoukakis and Eyre-Walker but with a similar result that palindromes and close inverted repeats are strongly over-represented in both protein-coding and non-coding regions of genomes of most prokaryotic phyla.The excess of palindromes is weaker in the archaea and in the Aquificae than in other bacterial phyla. This result is similar to that of Katz and Burge, who reported a significant excess of mRNA secondary structures in most bacteria but few archaea, and not in Aquifex aeolicus (note that their study was based on a much smaller sample of genomes available at that time and A. aeolicus was a sole representative of Aquificae in their data set). The weaker over-representation of palindromes in archaea and Aquificae is related to general decrease in palindrome representations with increasing OGT (Fig. 1). The decrease in palindrome representations with increasing OGT might seem counterintuitive if selection for mRNA stability drives the excess of palindromes in mRNA sequences. One possible explanation is that higher temperatures prevent formation of stable mRNA structures even with an increased content of inverted repeats, thus making selection for inverted repeats moot, or perhaps higher temperature decreases the efficiency of palindrome conversion via sequence-directed mutagenesis. Yet another potential explanation for weaker over-representation of inverted repeats in thermophiles stems from the work by Paz et al.,45 who noted that thermophilic mRNA sequences have increased purine-to-pyrimidine ratios compared with mesophiles, as well as excess of short oligopurine tracts. These authors proposed that purine-loading of mRNA sequences could increase their thermal stability. The resulting purine–pyrimidine imbalance could decrease the base-pairing potential in the mRNA sequences and the purine bias could therefore contribute to lower excess of palindromes and inverted repeats in thermophiles.4.2. Relationship with OGT and oxygen requirementExtreme temperature as well as presence of oxygen (via reactive oxygen species) cause damage to DNA and require cellular mechanisms to prevent or correct the damage in order to keep the cells viable. Such protection can be enzymatic (e.g. detoxification pathways) but could also involve adaptations in DNA composition and structure. One particularly puzzling question is how thermophiles prevent their DNA from denaturing. The simple explanation that DNA of thermophile is more GC-rich and thus more stable was mostly rejected as more data became available.46,47 Kawashima et al.48 proffered excess of RR and YY dinucleotides over RY and YR dinucleotides as a characteristic of thermophiles but this has later been shown a poor indicator of thermophily.47 We were therefore interested in finding whether any of the sequence patterns we analysed could be related to differences in OGT and oxygen requirement, and possibly contribute to the protection of DNA from the effects of extreme temperature and/or oxygen damage.One of our more surprising results concerns the relationship of representations of intrinsic DNA bends with OGT. Bolshoy and coworkers5,49 reported an excess of intrinsically bent DNA in intergenic regions of prokaryotic genomes, including segments containing putative promoters and transcription terminators. Notably, the amount of bent DNA in intergenic regions was significantly weaker in thermophiles than in mesophiles. In a separate work, Tolstorukov et al.33 found intrinsic DNA bends distributed widely throughout bacterial genomes, including both intergenic and protein-coding regions, and they proposed that the intrinsic bends could play a role in compaction of the bacterial nucleoid. Our present data show that predicted intrinsic DNA bends are over-represented in many phyla in both protein-coding and non-coding segments. Interestingly, the protein-coding and non-coding regions exhibit opposite trends with respect to OGT. For non-coding sequences, our results are consistent with the decrease in curved DNA in thermophiles observed by Kozobay-Avraham et al.5 However, the representation of DNA bends in protein-coding sequences tends to increase with increasing OGT.We propose that the opposite trends in protein-coding and non-coding DNA segments reflect different roles of DNA bends. Intergenic bends are often associated with regulatory elements and could facilitate opening of the DNA double helix at the transcription initiation sites.50,51 Decreased amount of intrinsic DNA bends in intergenic regions of thermophiles is consistent with experiments that showed that anomalous gel mobility characteristic of intrinsically curved DNA disappears at increased temperatures.52 If sequence-directed intrinsic DNA bending is ineffective at high temperatures, then selection for intrinsic bends at regulatory sites could be weak or absent. It is also possible that DNA bending is less important to transcription initiation at high temperatures. Surprisingly, the excess content of intragenic bends, which are less likely to have direct regulatory functions but may contribute to establishing and maintaining the nucleoid structure, increases with increasing OGT. The latter result could possibly indicate that the intrinsic bends maintain their role in stabilizing the nucleoid structure even at high temperatures and that high OGT may require increased amount of intrinsic DNA bending to maintain adequate structural stability of the chromosome.In addition to palindromes and close inverted repeats discussed above, some direct repeat structures also feature decreasing representations with increasing OGT (Table 3 and Fig. 1). We speculate that higher temperature might make the thermophile DNA more susceptible to illegitimate recombination, DNA polymerase slippage, or other forms of mutations facilitated by short repeats, and that reducing the amount of repeats, both direct and inverted, could be a strategy to counteract increased recombination rates. Along these lines, thermophiles were reported to have lower mutation rates than mesophiles, possibly driven by selection to maintain thermostability of the encoded proteins.53 Because close repeats are often sources of mutations, suppression of close repeats could be a part of the strategy to decrease overall mutation rates in thermophiles.Alternating RY patterns exhibit trends related to both OGT and oxygen requirement and these trends are independent of each other. The relationship with oxygen requirement is particularly intriguing. Facultative organisms suppress RY patterns more strongly than both aerobes and anaerobes. The main known structural effect of RY patterns is that they can facilitate transitions to left-handed Z-DNA under favourable conditions. The B-to-Z transition in such sequences can be induced by torsional stress arising from processes that require DNA unwinding, such as transcription or replication.28,31 The general suppression of RY patterns in prokaryotes suggests that B-to-Z DNA transitions are generally undesirable. It is intriguing to speculate that Z-DNA could be more detrimental to facultative organisms perhaps due to interference with effective regulation of a diverse ensemble of metabolic pathways related to the ability to grow in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. However, the specific mechanism of such interference between Z-DNA formation and transcriptional regulation is not clear.Overall, our data indicate potential new mechanisms how genome properties adapt to particular environments. Most of these mechanisms are related to adaptations to growth at high temperatures, which appear to be accompanied by reduction in overall repetitiveness of the DNA sequence, reduced excess of palindromes, and reduced DNA curvature in regulatory regions accompanied by general increase in intrinsically curved DNA in protein-coding sequences.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work is supported by the grant number DBI-0950266 from National Science Foundation.We wish to thank Dr Barny Whitman and Hao Tong for stimulating suggestions, and Orion Mantione for his help in writing the program to predict DNA bends.Supplementary data"

The functional categories including a higher number of genes are ‘Metabolism and generation of energy’, ‘Protein folding, modification and targeting’ and ‘Biogenesis of cellular components’. The knowledge of the genome sequence of the ISA1307 strain is expected to contribute to accelerate systems-level understanding of stress resistance mechanisms in Z. bailii and to inspire and guide novel biotechnological applications of this yeast species/strain in fermentation processes, given its high resilience to acidic stress. The availability of the ISA1307 genome sequence also paves the way to a better understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying the generation and selection of more robust hybrid yeast strains in the stressful environment of wine fermentations.1. IntroductionAmong food spoilage yeasts, those belonging to the genus Zygosaccharomyces are considered the most problematic to the food and beverage industries, with the Z. bailli species representing the most significant spoilage yeast within the genus, specially in acidic food products.1,2 Regardless of the progress achieved in product formulation and in the control and development of improved sanitation technologies, Z. bailii still is a major challenging threat of spoilage in mayonnaise, salad dressings, sauces, pickled or brined vegetables, fruit concentrates and various non-carbonated fruit drinks as well as other acidified foods.1,2Zygosaccharomyces bailii is also a significant spoiler of wines.3 The success of Z. bailii as a spoilage yeast results from a number of physiological traits of the species, in particular, its remarkable resilience against weak acids used as food preservatives such as acetic, benzoic, propionic, sorbic acids and sulphur dioxide, being able to proliferate in the presence of concentrations which are frequently above the permitted values by some food legislations.1,2,4Zygosaccharomyces bailii is also able to tolerate high concentrations of ethanol and other sanitizers and to grow in a wide range of pH (2.0–7.0) and water activities (0.80–0.99).1,2Zygosaccharomyces bailii is known to vigorously ferment hexoses and, like other members of the Zygosaccharomyces genus, Z. bailii exhibits a frutophilic behaviour metabolizing fructose at a higher rate than glucose when the two carbon sources are present in the growth medium.2,5,6 Moreover, Z. bailii is able to cause spoilage from an extremely low inoculum, to tolerate moderate osmotic pressure and to grow at high growth rates under oxygen-restrictive conditions.2,7 Food products that are preserved at low pH, low water activities or low oxygen concentrations, and that contain adequate amounts of fermentable sugars, are therefore at a particular risk of spoilage by this yeast, causing significant economic losses for the industries that produce and commercialize these products. Zygosaccharomyces bailii is also frequently isolated in wine fermentations and although this is generally considered detrimental, potential beneficial effects have also been proposed.8,9 This yeast species is a potential new host for biotechnological processes.10,11 In particular, it is an attractive candidate to allow fermentation processes to be performed under otherwise restrictive conditions, or to be used in heterologous protein and metabolite production due to its high resilience to a number of environmental stresses, high specific growth rate and high biomass yield.10,11 The use of Z. bailii was already found to be successful for the production of lactic acid, l-ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and vitamin B12.11,12Differently from Saccharomyces cerevisiae,13 the exploitation of Omic strategies in Zygosaccharomyces yeasts has been severely limited by the absence of available genome sequences for species of this genus. The genome of Z. rouxii CBS732, completed in 2009,14 was the first genome sequence of this genus being disclosed and only very recently the genome sequence of the Z. bailii type strain CLIB213T (=ATCC58445), was released.15 Therefore, until today, most of the studies dedicated to Z. bailii only explored gene-by-gene approaches.7,16–20 A quantitative proteomic analysis, based on quantitative two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE), was however recently performed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the adaptive response and intrinsic high tolerance of Z. bailii cells to sub-lethal concentrations of acetic acid.21 A coordinate increase in the content of proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism and energy generation as well as in general and oxidative stress response was registered.21 Results reinforced a previously established concept that glucose and acetic acid are co-consumed in Z. bailii, with acetate being channelled into the tricarboxylic acid cycle.18,21,22 When acetic acid is the sole carbon source, results suggest the activation of gluconeogenic and pentose phosphate pathways, based on the increased content of several proteins of these pathways after glucose exhaustion.21 The lack of a genome sequence for Z. bailii limited this expression proteomic analysis, given that only 40% of the differently expressed proteins could be identified by peptide mass fingerprinting.21 The development of molecular biology tools for Z. bailii, such as the isolation of stable auxotrophic mutants and release of a set of vectors allowing ectopic gene expression, is also relatively recent.10In this article, we describe the sequencing and annotation of strain ISA1307, isolated from a continuous sparkling wine production plant.23 Here, we also provide evidences supporting the notion that this strain, formerly considered of the Z. bailii species, is an interspecies hybrid between Z. bailii and another closely related yeast species. The phylogenetic relationships of a large cohort of isolates first classified as Z. bailii were recently re-examined, and significant differences in their rRNA gene sequences and genome fingerprinting patterns were found, leading to the distribution of these isolates into three species: Z. bailii, Z. parabailii and Z. pseudobailii.24 Despite the differences registered at the molecular level, the Z. bailii species could not be distinguished from the other two novel species using physiological tests.24 The occurrence in wines of natural hybrid strains generated by hybridization of different Saccharomyces species is widely described in the literature,25,26 the lagger brewing yeast Saccharomyces pastorianus being the most paradigmatic example.27 The occurrence of hybrid strains within the Zygosaccharomyces genus involving, at least, the Z. rouxii, Z. pseudorouxii and Z. mellis species, was also reported.28–30 The ISA1307 strain focused on our work has been used in several studies conducted to examine different aspects of Z. bailii physiology, in particular, its extreme tolerance to acetic acid (minimum inhibitory concentration value for acetic acid in the range of 270–420 mM compared with 80 mM for S. cerevisiae21,31 and our unpublished results), metabolism of fructose and glucose5,32 and growth under oxygen-restrictive conditions.7 A genomic library from strain ISA1307 was constructed33 and successfully used for functional analysis of several relevant genes.5,19 Considering that formation of hybrids in the stressful environment of wine fermentations has been associated with improved strain robustness strains,25 it is expected that the sequencing and annotation of ISA1307 genome reported in this work may be used to inspire and guide novel biotechnological applications of this strain and Z. bailii species under otherwise restrictive process conditions. The availability of the ISA1307 genome sequence will also open the door to a better understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying the generation of hybrid strains in the stressful environment of wine fermentations.2. Materials and methods2.1. Strains and growth mediumThe prototrophic yeast isolates ISA1307,23Z. bailii ATCC58445T (=CLIB213T) and the laboratory strains acquired from the Euroscarf collection S. cerevisiae BY4741 (genotype MATa; his3<U+0394> 1; leu2<U+0394> 0; lys2<U+0394> 0; ura3<U+0394> 0) and S. cerevisiae BY4743 (genotype MATa/a his3<U+0394>1/his3<U+0394>1 leu2<U+0394>0/leu2<U+0394>0 LYS2/lys2<U+0394>0 met15<U+0394>0/MET15 ura3<U+0394>0/ura3<U+0394>0) were used in this study. Strains were maintained and cultivated in rich YPD growth medium which contains, per liter, 2% glucose (Merck), 2% yeast extract (Difco) and 2% peptone (Difco).2.2. Quantification of ISA1307 and S. cerevisae total genomic DNA by flow cytometryQuantification of total genomic DNA from S. cerevisiae (strains BY4741 and BY4743) and of the hybrid strain ISA1307 was performed using a SYBR Green I-based staining protocol, as described before.34 Briefly, cells batch cultured in YPD growth medium, at 26°C, until mid-exponential phase (OD600 nm of 1.0 ± 0.01; 106 cells for each species), were harvested by centrifugation, washed with H2O and fixed overnight in 0.5 ml of 70% ethanol (vol/vol). Fixed cells were collected by centrifugation, washed with 50 mM of sodium citrate buffer (pH 7.5) and re-suspended in 750 µL of this same buffer supplemented with 1 mg of RNAse A. After 1 h of incubation at 50°C, 1 mg of proteinase K was added to the cell suspension and the mixture was left at 50°C for another hour. Cells were subsequently stained using 20 µL of SYBR Green I working solution (corresponding to a 500-fold dilution of the commercial solution). Samples were sonicated at low power and analysed in an Epics® XL™ (Beckman Coulter) flow cytometer equipped with an argon ion laser emitting a 488-nm beam at 15 mW. The green fluorescence was collected through a 488-nm blocking filter, a 550-nm/long-pass dichroic and a 525-nm/bandpass. Thirty thousand cells per sample were analysed to obtain the cell cycle profiles shown in Fig. 1. The mean fluorescent intensities obtained for S. cerevisiae BY4741 and BY4743 were used to build a calibration curve from which it was estimated the size of the genome of the ISA1307 strain.

Mean fluorescent intensities (MFI) of G0/G1 peaks of the cell cycle histogram were estimated by flow cytometry. The MFI values obtained for the two S. cerevisiae strains were used to build a calibration curve that was used to calculate the size of the genome of the ISA1307 strain (12.16 Mb for the size of the genome of the haploid strain S. cerevisiae BY4741).

Karyotyping of the ISA1307 strainIntact DNA for pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was prepared in plugs as previously described.35 ISA1307 and Z. bailii ATCC58445 cells, cultivated overnight at 26°C in YPD growth medium, were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with 0.05 M EDTA, pH 8.0 and resuspended at a concentration of 1.2 × 109 cells/ml in 0.05 M EDTA containing 3 mg/ml of Zymolyase 100T for digestion. Plugs were formed by mixing the suspension of cells with the same volume of low melting agarose 2% (SeaPlaque; Cambex Bio Science, Rockland, ME, USA) at 40°C. Plugs were then incubated overnight in 0.45 mM EDTA, pH 8.0 and 7.5% (vol/vol) 2-mercaptoethanol at 37°C. After this incubation step, plugs were washed three times in Tris/EDTA buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 8.0 and 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) and incubated overnight in 0.5 M EDTA, 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mg/mL of proteinase K (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1% sodium-N-lauryl sarcosinate at 50°C. After washing five times, during 30 min each, with TE, pH 8.0, at room temperature, samples were stored at 4°C. PFGE was performed in a CHEF-DRII Chiller System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). PFGE gels were run in 0.5% Tris borate–EDTA buffer at 12°C with an angle of 120° with a voltage of 3 V/cm and switch times of 300 s for 120 h.2.4. Genome sequencing, assembly and annotationThe genome of the ISA1307 hybrid strain was sequenced at CD Genomics (New York, USA) using a whole-genome shotgun approach that explored paired-end Illumina sequencing. Details on the methods used for genome sequencing, assembly and subsequent annotation are described in Supplementary Material.3. Results and discussion3.1. The ISA1307 strain is an interspecies hybrid between Z. bailii and a closely related speciesFollowing the analysis of the ISA1307 strain genome sequence described below and given that yeast isolates formerly identified as Z. bailii were recently reclassified in the Z. bailii, Z. parabailii and Z. pseudobailii species,24 we have examined the taxonomic classification of this strain. The sequences of the house-keeping genes RPB1, RPB2, EF1-a and ß-tubulin were compared. These gene sequences were proposed as sequences with a very high capacity to discriminate Z. bailii, Z. parabailii and Z. pseudobailii species.24 Only one copy of the RPB1 gene was found in the ISA1307 genome, this being identical to the corresponding orthologue annotated in the genome of several Z. bailii strains (Supplementary Material). The ß-tubulin, RPB2 and EF1-a genes are duplicated in the genome of the ISA1307 strain, with one allele being almost identical (>99% identity at the nucleotide level) to the corresponding orthologue found in Z. bailii strains and the other allele being identical to the orthologues found in Z. parabailii strains24 (Supplementary Material). The analysis of the genome sequence revealed that this allelic divergence is registered in ~90% of the genes found to be duplicated in the ISA1307 genome (see below). Altogether, these results strongly suggest that the ISA1307 strain is an interspecies hybrid between Z. bailii and a closely related species. The results obtained for sequences of ß-tubulin, EF1-a and RPB2 genes appear to suggest that Z. parabailii could be the other parental species. A closer inspection to the sequences of these genes deposited for the different strains classified as Z. parababilii by Suh et al.24 showed the existence of multiple ambiguous positions, which suggests that these sequences already have been obtained by amplification of divergent alleles. Thus, we hypothesize that the strains previously classified as Z. parabailii could be hybrid strains. This hypothesis is in line with the reported inability of Z. parabailii ATCC56075 (=NCYC128) to undergo meiotic sporulation,36 a phenotypic trait common in hybrid strains25,37 and also described for ISA1307.173.2. Karyotyping and estimation of total DNA content of the ISA1307 strainTo estimate the size of ISA1307 genome, exponential cells were fixed and DNA was quantified by flow cytometry using the fluorescent probe SYBR Green I.17 Cell cycle analysis revealed that the intensity of the G0/G1 peak exhibited by ISA1307 cells is 1.7-fold higher and 1.1-fold lower than the values registered for the reference strains S. cerevisiae BY4741 (haploid) and BY4743 (diploid), respectively (Fig. 1A). Considering that S. cerevisiae BY4741 has a size of 12.16 Mb (www.yeastgenome.org), the estimated size of ISA1307 total DNA is ~22.0 Mb (Table 1). To complement this analysis, PFGE was used to separate ISA1307 genomic DNA. Under the experimental conditions used, 13 chromosomal bands were observed, with sizes ranging from 733 to 2120 Mb (Fig. 1B). PFGE profiling of the type strain Z. bailii ATCC58445 (=CLIB213T) was also performed, and five chromosomal bands were observed (Fig. 1B). This result is in line with a previous publication, suggesting that the ISA1307 strain has at least three more chromosomes than the Z. bailii type strain.17 The sum of the PFGE bands is ~19 Mb, differing by 3 Mb of the total amount of DNA that was estimated by flow cytometry, a gap that can result from co-migration of chromosomal bands in the PFGE gel. In fact, it is possible that the first two bands (2120 and 1981 kb) and eventually the last band (730 kb) are duplicated, based on their higher intensity, compared with the other bands observed in the gel (Fig. 1). Genome assembly statistics of the Z. bailii-derived interspecies hybrid strain ISA1307The most significant parameters associated with assembly of the reads that were obtained after sequencing of the ISA1307 genome are indicated.Genome assembly statistics of the Z. bailii-derived interspecies hybrid strain ISA1307The most significant parameters associated with assembly of the reads that were obtained after sequencing of the ISA1307 genome are indicated.3.3. Assembly of ISA1307 genomeTwo rounds of paired-end Illumina sequencing (inserts with ~350 bp, 100 base reads) were carried out to obtain the sequence of ISA1307 genome. Around 120 Gb of readings were acquired yielding a genome coverage of 600 fold. The de novo assembly of the reads was carried out using SOAPde novo assembler38 resulting in 190 scaffolds. After the assembly process, the sum of the scaffolds size obtained (21.1 Mb) was well above the size expected for a haploid genome (which would be ~11 Mb), indicating that the duplicated sequences from the homeologous chromosomes (homologous chromosomes acquired from two different species) of the ISA1307 strain were not aligned in a unique consensus sequence. The same had also been obtained during genome sequencing of other interspecies hybrid strains, such as S. pastorianus or Pichia sorbitophila,27,39 this being attributed to the different origin of the homeologous chromosomes that compose the genome of hybrid strains. To reconstruct the genome sequence of the ISA1307 strain, we have used a similar approach to the one used to assemble the genome of other hybrid yeast strains.27,39,40 Briefly, 190 scaffolds with homologous genes were detected (using an all-against-all BLASTP analysis) and then sequentially ordered based on the search of syntenic blocks with the genomes of Z. rouxii CBS732 and S. cerevisiae S288c. These yeast species were selected for this analysis, since they are phylogenetically close to Z. bailii and their genomes are well annotated and available in public databases (Genolévures database41 and Saccharomyces Genome database42 or CYGD,43 respectively). The junction points between scaffolds predicted to be contiguous by our synteny-based in silico analysis were tested by PCR to confirm correct scaffold positioning, and the existing gaps were closed by sequencing the amplification product. A summary of the genome assembly statistics is summarized in Table 1. The final reconstructed genomic sequence of the ISA1307 strain is distributed over 154 scaffolds with sizes ranging from 2160 to 806 952 bp. The sum of all scaffolds size is 21 141 152 bp (Table 1), which corresponds to 96% of the genome size that was estimated by flow cytometry (see above). The sequence of the genome of the ISA1307 strain and the subsequent annotation performed was deposited in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA, http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/CBTC010000001-CBTC010000154). Although a genome sequence for the type strain Z. bailii CLIB213T has been recently published,15 this was only released after the assembly of ISA1307 genome. A comparative genomic analysis between the genomes of ISA1307 and Z. bailii CLIB213T (discussed below) suggests that the genome of the two parental species are interspersed in the genome of the hybrid strain ISA1307, which shows that the use of Z. bailii CLIB213T genome as a reference for the assembly process of ISA1307 genome would have been disadvantageous, compared with the strategy that we have used which was based on the use of S. cerevisiae and Z. rouxii genomes.3.4. Annotation and structure of ISA1307 genomeTo annotate protein-encoding genes in the genome sequence of the ISA1307 strain, a combination of ab initio and homology methods were applied using the gene structure of S. cerevisiae S288c and Z. rouxii CBS732 genes as references. In total, 9925 genes are predicted to be encoded by the genome of the hybrid ISA1307 strain, 90% of these being considered duplicated genes (corresponding to 4385 gene pairs) (Supplementary Table S1) since the encoded proteins share >50% Simap similarity at the amino acid level (listed in Supplementary Table S1). The number of genes predicted to be encoded by the genome of this strain is around twice that of genes annotated for the type strain Z. bailii CLIB213T.15 The scaffolds encoding homologous genes were indicated by suffices ‘A’ and ‘B’ in the scaffold names to reflect the existence of two orthologous sets of scaffold sequences. Sixteen scaffolds lacking clear orthologous sequences remained and were maintained as singletons labelled with the ‘s’ suffix. A MUMmer44 alignment of the A and B scaffolds indicates a base identity of 92.6% [for a total of 89.5% (A) and 94.0% (B) of aligned bases], consistent with the proposed hybrid nature of the ISA1307 genome. In line with this difference, variation in the sequence of the ISA1307 duplicated genes was also observed (Supplementary Table S2). For 90% of the ISA1307 duplicated genes, it was found that one of the alleles was almost identical to the corresponding gene found in Z. bailii CLIB213T (99–100% identity at the nucleotide level), while the sequence of the other allele was less similar (94–98% identity at the nucleotide level) (Supplementary Table S2). Notably, the ISA1307 gene alleles presumed to have originated from Z. bailii (that is, those identical to genes found in the CLIB213T strain) were distributed between A and B scaffolds (Supplementary Table S2), indicating that the genetic information coming from this species is, apparently, not confined to only one of the homeologous chromosomes of the ISA1307 strain probably due to the occurrence of chromosomal rearrangements after hybridization of the parental strains. The differences in the two alleles of ISA1307 duplicated genes registered at the nucleotide level had almost no impact in the sequence of the encoded proteins since only six gene pairs (ZBAI_07571/ ZBAI_01790; ZBAI_06324/ ZBAI_01930; ZBAI_09856/ ZBAI_05001; ZBAI_07267/ ZBAI_01173; ZBAI_08269/ ZBAI_03260; ZBAI_08169/ ZBAI_01798) exhibited a rate of non-synonymous substitutions (dN) and synonymous substitutions (dS) above 1.The general features of ISA1307 genome, in particular, gene density, average GC content, number of tRNAs and number of rRNA locus are consistent with those described for other hemiascomycetous yeasts, in particular, for S. cerevisiae S288c and Z. rouxii CBS73214 (Table 2). The average gene length of all genes is 1471 bp and the incidence of introns is ~3%, in line with the results obtained for S. cerevisiae S288c and Z. rouxii CBS732 (Table 2).14 Around 97% (9631 genes) of the genes are predicted to be intron-free. The remaining genes are predicted to have two (277 genes) or three or more exons (17 genes), similarly to the S. cerevisiae S288c and Z. rouxii CBS732 genes (results not shown). No significant differences were registered in the gene structure located in A and B scaffolds (results not shown), which is compatible with the anticipated genetic relatedness of the parental species that originated the ISA1307 strain. General features of ISA1307, Z. rouxii CBS732 and S. cerevisiae S288c genomesFor the ISA1307 strain genome, each parameter indicated in the table was calculated from the final reconstructed genomic sequence after annotation. ISA1307 genome size was calculated based on the results obtained by flow cytometry shown in Fig. 1A. Average gene density represents the fraction of each genome occupied by protein-coding genes (other genetic elements were not considered). Information from Z. rouxii CBS732 and S. cerevisiae S288c genomes were taken from14 coding sequences (CDS). The size of the chromosomes was estimated based on the results obtained in the PFGE shown in Fig. 1.General features of ISA1307, Z. rouxii CBS732 and S. cerevisiae S288c genomesFor the ISA1307 strain genome, each parameter indicated in the table was calculated from the final reconstructed genomic sequence after annotation.

Massive genomic rearrangements seem to have occurred since the differentiation of Z. bailii, Z. rouxii and of the ISA1307 strain from S. cerevisiae because the genetic information contained in the chromosomes of the budding yeast is dispersed throughout Z. rouxii CBS732 chromosomes and throughout the scaffolds of the genome of ISA1307 and of Z. bailii CLIB213T (Fig. 2A). The genomes of ISA1307, Z. bailii CLIB213T and Z. rouxii CBS732 genomes are more syntenic, reflecting the close phylogenetic distance between these strains, however, the existence of large gaps is still evident (Fig. 2B). In general, a high degree of sinteny was observed between the two homeologous scaffolds of the ISA1307 strain and scaffolds of Z. bailii CLIB213T (Fig. 2 C and D), consistent with Z. bailii being one of the parental species of the ISA1307 strain and with the hypothesis that the other parental strain is phylogenetically close to Z. bailii.

This image was obtained using the multigenome alignment GBrowse_syn (http://mips.helmholtz-muenchen.de/gbrowse2/cgi-bin/gbrowse_syn/zbailii).Twelve putative centromere-like sequences were found in the 154 scaffolds (Supplementary Table S3) that compose the ISA1307 genome, this being compatible with the 13 chromosomal bands obtained in the PFGE analysis (Fig. 1B). The structure of the centromere sequences obtained is similar to the sequences described for point centromeres of hemiascomycetous yeasts14: two conserved domains CDE I and CDE III interspersed by an AT-rich CDE II domain (ranging from 69 to 82%—AT content) (Supplementary Table S3). Although the assembly and annotation above described indicate the existence of large duplicated genomic regions in the genome of the ISA1307 strain, only two or three of the 13 chromosomal bands obtained in the PFGE gel seem to be duplicated (Fig. 1; see above). It is not possible to fully elucidate the structure of ISA1307 genome solely with the data available; however, the results of genome sequencing and karyotyping (Fig. 1) suggest that the genome of this hybrid strain includes chromosomes composed by highly similar homeologous chromosomes (presumably corresponding to the duplicated bands observed in the PFGE gel) and chromosomes composed by more dissimilar homeologous chromosomes (presumably corresponding to the different-sized single bands observed in the PFGE gel). Like ISA1307, other yeast hybrid strains have also been demonstrated to have complex genome structures.27,29,39,403.5 Origin of ISA1307 predicted proteinsThe vast majority of the proteins predicted to be encoded by the genome of the ISA1307 strain have their best homologue with proteins found in yeast species phylogenetically close to the Z. bailii species, namely Z. rouxii, Torulaspora delbrueckii, S. cerevisiae or other yeasts of the Sacharomycetecea family (results not shown). However, it was possible to identify in the predicted proteome of the ISA1307 strain at least 42 proteins that share a high degree of similarity with proteins found in species distant from the Sacharomycetecea family (e.g. Candida tenuis, Hansenula polymorpha, Schizosaccharomyces pombe) or even in moulds (e.g. Aspergillus niger, Penicillium digitatum or Fusarium oxysporum) (Supplementary Table S4). Six ISA1307 predicted proteins seem to have a bacterial origin since their closest homologues are proteins found in Burkholderia cenocepacia, Burkholderia terrae or Dickeya dadantii (Supplementary Table S4). The occurrence of prokaryote-to-eukaryote and eukaryote-to-eukaryote gene transfers has been demonstrated in S. cerevisiae and in several other fungi.47 The physiological function of the proteins that seem to have been acquired by the ISA1307 by gene transfer is widespread including a putative Cu, Zn-superoxide dismutase, putative transporters involved in the uptake of monocarboxylates, amino acids and urea, two permeases similar to multi-drug resistance (MDR) transporters of the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS), one enzyme required for catabolism of mannose and one enzyme required for metabolization of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate, an intermediate in the biosynthesis of the plant hormone ethylene (Supplementary Table S4). Extensive genomic analysis has demonstrated that the acquisition of novel genes by fungi, coming from another fungi or coming from a prokaryote, is often associated with increased cellular fitness to proliferation in the corresponding ecological niche.47 Remarkably, 17 of the proteins that seem to have been acquired by the ISA1307 strain do not have an orthologue in Z. bailii CLIB213T (Supplementary Table S4), suggesting that they might have been acquired after the hybridization process.3.6. Functional categorization of ISA1307 genesThe function of the 9931 gene loci predicted to be encoded by the genome of the ISA1307 strain was clustered according to their physiological function using the FunCatDB functional catalogue48 (Fig. 3). The highest number of genes were found in the functional classes of ‘Metabolism and generation of energy’ (35% of the total of predicted genes), ‘Protein folding, modification and targeting’ (25% of the predicted genes) and ‘Biogenesis of cellular components’ (21% of the predicted genes) (Fig. 3). The functional categorization of the ISA1307 genome is, in general, similar to the one obtained for S. cerevisiae S288c or Z. rouxii CBS732 genomes (Supplementary Fig. S1). Genes encoding transposable elements were found to be very scarce in the ISA1307 genome (Supplementary Fig. S1). The more abundant motifs found in the proteins predicted to be encoded by the ISA1307 genome were: (i) the WD40/YTVN motif, present in signal transducing G-proteins or in actin-interacting proteins, (ii) kinases-associated motifs, (iii) motifs present in NADP+-binding enzymes, (iv) the armadillo motif, found in protein phosphatases and in initiation translation factors and (v) signature motifs of transporters of the MFS (Fig. 4). These motifs were also the more abundant motifs found in S. cerevisiae S288c or Z. rouxii CBS732 proteomes (results not shown).

ISA1307 genes involved in metabolism and transport of carbohydratesGenes encoding enzymes involved in all major pathways of central carbon metabolism were found in ISA1307 ORFeome, including enzymes of the glycolytic pathway, TCA cycle, neoglucogenesis, pentose phosphate pathway and the anaplerotic enzymes isocitrate lyase, pyruvate carboxylase, phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase and malic enzyme (Supplementary Fig. S2 and Table S5). Based on the genome annotation, it is anticipated that the respiratory chain of ISA1307 cells includes two mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenases (one located in the inner mitochondrial membrane and another in the outer membrane), one FADH : fumarate dehydrogenase (Complex II), one cytochrome C : ubiquinone reductase (Complex III) and one cytochrome C oxidase (Complex IV) (Supplementary Fig. S2 and Table S5). The hybrid strain ISA1307 does not seem to have a functional complex I, like all the other described yeasts able to perform aerobic alcoholic fermentation,49 nor does it have alternative oxidases to perform cyanide-resistant respiration. This organization supports the idea that the hybrid strain ISA1307 obtains energy from the respiratory chain through the proton gradient generated by Complexes III and IV, which is consistent with previous studies demonstrating the high sensitivity exhibited by Z. bailii strains to the cytochrome-C reductase inhibitor antimycin.50 Genes encoding enzymes required for the catabolism of galactose, glycerol, acetate, ethanol and fructose were also identified in the genome of the ISA1307 strain (Supplementary Fig. S2 and Table S5), consistent with the described ability of this strain to use all these carbon sources.22 Enzymes required for catabolism of xylose, sorbose, sorbitol, inulin and glucose-based polysaccharides were also found in the genome of the ISA1307 strain (Supplementary Fig. S2 and Table S5). A putative lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (encoded by the ZBAI_09900 gene) was also found, suggesting that ISA1307 cells may be able to perform lactic fermentation in alternative to alcoholic fermentation. Interestingly, we could not find in the genome of Z. bailii CLIB213T, an orthologue for this putative LDH enzyme found in the genome of the ISA1307 strain (Supplementary Table S5), indicating that it may have been acquired from the other parental species of the ISA1307 strain.Nine putative hexose transporters similar to the well-characterized S. cerevisiae Hxt transporters are included in the predicted ‘transportome’ of the ISA1307 strain, as well as two transporters of the sugar porter family, one transporter similar to the Kluyveromyces lactis glucose/fructose/galactose transporter Hgt1 and several predicted hexose-like transporters of uncharacterized function (Supplementary Table S5). Fructophilicity, one of the main physiological characteristics that distinguishes the Z. bailii species, is retained in the ISA1307 strain.51 The activity of the highly specific fructose transporter Ffz1 and the repression of glucose transport by the presence of fructose are considered to be on the basis of fructophilicity of the ISA1307 strain.5,51 Besides Ffz1 (ORF ZBAI_03578), three other genes encoding transporters highly similar to Ffz1 were found in the ISA1307 genome (Supplementary Table S5). Three of the four Ffz1-like genes found in the genome of ISA1307 were also present in the genome of Z. bailii CLIB213T (Supplementary Table S5). Interestingly, one sugar transporter (ZBAI_01802) that is present in S. cerevisiae wine strains but absent in the laboratory strain S288c (Supplementary Table S4) was found in ISA1307 genome. Two gene homologues of S. cerevisiae gene ADY2, encoding an acetate transporter, and two putative glycerol permeases, were also found to be present in ISA1307 genome (Supplementary Table S4).3.8. Proteins involved in Crabtree effect regulationThe ISA1307 strain and also other strains belonging to Z. bailii species are known to have an alleviated Crabtree effect, being able to co-consume glucose and other carbon sources.6,18,21,22 The genome sequence of the ISA1307 hybrid strain and of the type strain Z. bailii CLIB213T were searched for homologues of the Snf1-signalling pathway, known to play a prominent role in glucose repression in S. cerevisiae52 (Table 3). No significant differences were registered in the amino acid sequence of the proteins predicted to function in the Snf1-signalling pathway in ISA1307 and in Z. bailii CLIB213T, indicating that this pathway should function in a similar manner in the two strains (results not shown). However, the organization of the Snf1 pathway in the ISA1307 strain and in Z. bailii CLIB213T is apparently different from the one described in S. cerevisiae, since the regulatory subunits Gal83 and Sip2 are apparently fused into a single protein (with similarity to the protein domains found in the two independent S. cerevisiae proteins) and only two Mig transcription factors are encoded by the genomes of the Zygosaccharomyces strains (Table 3). The homology between the three S. cerevisiae Mig transcription factors and the two putative Mig-like transcription factors found in Z. bailii CLIB213T or in the ISA1307 strain was limited to the DNA-binding domain, suggesting that all these transcription factors may recognize similar DNA-binding sites, as found in other fungi.53 Interestingly, the promoter regions of the ISA1307 genes predicted to encode gluconeogenic enzymes, enzymes of the TCA cycle or enzymes required for acetate or glyoxylate metabolism, all subjected to glucose repression in S. cerevisiae in a Mig1-dependent manner,52 harbour DNA motifs similar to the binding site described for ScMig1 (results not shown). Although a significant difference was registered at the level of the transactivation domains of the two ZbMig and the three ScMig transcription factors, only by the analysis of the genome sequence it is not possible, at this phase, to uncover the mechanisms underlying the different behaviour of the ISA1307 strain and of Z. bailii strains, compared with S. cerevisiae, concerning the Crabtree effect. The alleviation of the Crabtree effect was suggested to be behind the high intrinsic resistance of the ISA1307 strain, and of the Z. bailii species in general, to acetic acid and to other weak acids used as food preservatives.18,21,22 However, since these compounds are very diverse in structure, it is unlikely that the high resistance of Z. bailii or of the ISA1307 strain to all these weak acids results from the co-catabolism of all these compounds. Conservation of the Snf1-signalling pathway in S. cerevisiae, in Z. bailii CLIB213T and in the interspecies hybrid strain ISA1307Proteins from ISA1307 and from Z. bailii CLIB213T homologous to the S. cerevisiae proteins described to belong to the Snf1-signalling pathway.52 The physiological function of the S. cerevisiae proteins is based on the information available at saccharomyces genome database.Conservation of the Snf1-signalling pathway in S. cerevisiae, in Z. bailii CLIB213T and in the interspecies hybrid strain ISA1307Proteins from ISA1307 and from Z. bailii CLIB213T homologous to the S. cerevisiae proteins described to belong to the Snf1-signalling pathway.52 The physiological function of the S. cerevisiae proteins is based on the information available at saccharomyces genome database.3.9. Genes involved in transport and metabolism of amino acids and other nitrogen compoundsThe genome of the ISA1307 strain encodes enzymes required for biosynthesis and catabolism of all proteogenic amino acids (Supplementary Fig. S3). Around 40% of the ISA1307 genes included in the ‘Metabolism’ and ‘Cellular transport’ functional classes (Fig. 3) encode proteins related to amino acid metabolism or uptake. Remarkably, there are 18 predicted pyruvate decarboxylases (PDCs) in the genome of the ISA1307 strain while in Z. rouxii CBS732 and S. cerevisiae S288c there are only three and five proteins, respectively, with this function annotated (Supplementary Table S6). In the type strain Z. bailii CLIB213T, there are five genes encoding PDC enzymes annotated (Supplementary Table S5), suggesting that the increase in the number of these genes is a particular characteristic of the ISA1307 strain. PDC enzymes are involved in alcoholic fermentation (by catalysing the conversion of pyruvate to acetaldehyde) and in catabolism of branched and aromatic amino acids through the Ehrlich pathway. The amplification of PDC genes in the genome of the ISA1307 strain does not favour alcoholic fermentation since the alcoholic fermentation rate of these cells is below the rates exhibited by Z. rouxii or S. cerevisiae cells;7 however, it may represent an adaptive response to the significant amounts of aromatic and branched amino acids (the main substrates of the Ehrlich pathway) that are found in wines,54 the ecological niche where this hybrid strain was isolated from. Thirty-six ISA1307 genes are predicted to encode amino acid permeases, including general amino acid permeases and permeases specific for proline, histidine, lysine, arginine, methionine, histidine, branched amino acids (valine, isoleucine and leucine) and for neutral amino acids (Supplementary Table S6). Genes required for catabolism of allantoine, urea and the non-proteogenic amino acid GABA, as well as genes encoding permeases for these nitrogen sources, were also found in the predicted set of ISA1307 proteins (Supplementary Fig. S3). Interestingly, some of the permease-encoding genes found in the ISA1307 genome have homologues in S. cerevisiae strains isolated from wines, but not in the laboratory strain S288c (Supplementary Table S6). The comparison of the genome of several S. cerevisiae wine strains with the genome of the laboratory strain S288c strongly suggests that the acquisition of genes required for transport and metabolism of nitrogen sources results from adaptation to the nitrogen-depleted environment of wine musts.553.10. Genes involved in meiosis and matingInfertility is a common characteristic of hybrid yeast strains due to the incompatibility of genes coming from the parental genomes, gross chromosomal rearrangements and abnormal gene segregation, among other factors.25,37 As expected from an hybrid strain, ISA1307 cells were only found to propagate by clonal expansion through mitotic divisions.17 Other strains previously classified as Z. bailii (NCYC563, NCYC1427, NCYC1416 and NCYC128) were also found to be unable to produce meiotic spores;36 however, it remains to be established if these strains do belong to the Z. bailii species (not examined in24) or if they are hybrid strains or strains belonging to a closely related species. Based on the infertility phenotype exhibited by the ISA1307 strain,17 it was generally accepted that Z. bailii cells were unable to undergo meiosis. The predicted proteome of the ISA1307 strain and of the type strain Z. bailii CLIB213T, whose ability to undergo meiosis is, as far as we know, unknown, was searched for proteins homologous to those described to be required for functional meiosis and mating in S. cerevisiae (Supplementary Table S7). A number of proteins demonstrated to play an essential role in meiosis in the budding yeast are apparently not encoded by the genome of the ISA1307 strain including: (i) Ime1 and Ume6, key transcriptional regulators of meiosis-related genes, (ii) Emi1, required for transcriptional induction of Ime1, (iii) Zip2 and Cst9, involved in the formation of the synaptonemal complex, (iv) Don1, Mpc54, Spo16, Spo20, Spo21, Spo22 and Spo74, involved in the formation of the meiotic plate and (v) Rec104, Zip2, Mlh2, Msh4 and Msh5 genes, required for the induction of meiotic recombination (Supplementary Table S7). Concerning the molecular machinery required for mating in S. cerevisiae, the transcription factors Dig1 and Dig2, required for the regulation of mating-specific genes and for triggering the invasive growth pathway, also seem to be absent from the ISA1307 genome (Supplementary Table S6). Moreover, neither the S. cerevisiae a or a matting cassettes (encoded in the HMRA1/HMRA2 and HMALPHA1/HMALPHA2 locus) nor the corresponding a or a mating factors [encoded by the MATa1/MATa2 and MAT(alpha1)/MAT(alpha2) genes] were also found to have homologues in the ISA1307 genome (Supplementary Table S6). Around half of the genes required for meiosis in the budding yeast that are missing in the genome of the ISA1307 strain were found in the genome sequence available for Z. bailii CLIB213T; however, this strain lacks proteins with a very prominent role in the meiotic process, such as Ime1 (Supplementary Table S7). Homologues to the S. cerevisiae a and a mating cassettes were also not found in the genome of Z. bailii CLIB213T (Supplementary Table S7). Solely based on the inspection of the genome sequence, it is not possible to say if the infertility phenotype of ISA1307 cells derives from being a hybrid strain or if this trait was found in the parental species, in particular, in Z. bailii.3.11. ISA1307 genes involved in stress responseOne of the goals underlying species hybridization is the increase in cell robustness. Indeed, hybrid yeast strains isolated from the harsh environmental conditions of wine fermentations were found to be more resistant to stress than their parental species.56–58 One of the main phenotypic traits of ISA1307 strain is its high tolerance to acetic acid stress.18,21Zygosaccharomyces bailii species are known for being resistant to stress induced by several weak acids food preservatives and tolerant to several sanitizers and to osmotic stress induced by high sugar concentrations.2 Although this high intrinsic resilience of Z. bailii cells to the above referred stresses is believed to underlie the high spoilage capacity of this yeast species,2 specially in acidic foods and drinks, the molecular mechanisms behind this trait are still unknown or unclear. Having this in mind, the genome of the ISA1307 strain was searched for proteins described to play a role in in S. cerevisiae response and resistance to weak acid food preservatives, in particular, to acetic acid. The genome of the ISA1307 strain encodes one protein, encoded by the paralogous genes ZBAI_03527 and ZBAI_08525, homologous to the S. cerevisiae transcription factors Msn2 and Msn4, which control the transcriptional response to environmental stress,59 in particular the response to weak acid food preservatives.13 Apparently, Z. bailii CLIB213T genome also encodes one protein (ZYBA0S17-00848g1_1) with similarity to the ScMsn2/ScMsn4 transcription factors. The highest degree of similarity of this putative ZbMsn2/4 with ScMsn2 or ScMsn4 is registered at the level of the DNA-binding domain, mapped in the C-terminal region of these proteins.59 Most of the genes involved in S. cerevisiae Environmental Stress Response (ESR) are conserved in the genome of the ISA1307 strain and, in general, the promoter region of these putative stress-responsive genes harbours the STRE motif (5'-CCCCT-3', results not shown) for ScMsn2/ScMsn4 binding. Approximately 98% of genes that were found to mediate MDR in S. cerevisiae60 are conserved in ISA1307 and Z. bailii CLIB213T genomes (Supplementary Table S8), suggesting that some of the mechanisms that were described to underlie the MDR phenomenon in the budding yeast, namely plasma membrane lipid composition, intracellular protein trafficking mediated by vesicular transport or proteosomal activity, may also be active in Z. bailii. The genome of the ISA1307 strain encodes at least 63 MDR transporters of the ABC (28) and of the MFS (35) (Supplementary Table S9). The role of a number of these transporters in S. cerevisiae MDR has been well documented, in particular, the MFS transporters Azr1, Aqr1, Tpo2 and Tpo3,61 and the ABC transporter Pdr12,62 described as determinants of S. cerevisiae resistance to weak acids food preservatives13 (Supplementary Table S9). Four non-paralogous ISA1307 genes are predicted to encode Pdr12-like proteins; this apparent PDR12 amplification being an interesting observation considering the major role attributed to this protein in S. cerevisiae response and resistance to weak acid-induced stress.13 Six MFS-MDR transporters of uncharacterized function that do not appear to have homologues either in the sequenced S. cerevisiae strains or in Z. rouxii CBS732 were also found to be encoded by the genome of the ISA1307 strain (Supplementary Table S9). Two of these transporters (encoded by ZBAI_07578 and by the paralogous genes ZBAI_00386/ ZBAI_01804) do have a very high homology to MFS-MDR transporters from Candida dubliensis and Aspergillus fumigatus, suggesting that these genes could have been acquired by gene transfer (Supplementary Table S9). Interestingly, we could not identify in the genome of Z. bailii CLIB213T orthologues for these putative eight MFS-MDR transporters nor for the four Pdr12-like genes that were found in the genome of the ISA1307 strain (Supplementary Table S9). Therefore, it is hypothesized that these genes could be encoded by the non-Z. bailii species genome of the hybrid strain ISA1307. The vast majority of the genes that mediate S. cerevisiae tolerance to acetic acid, propionic acid and sorbic acids (90–95%, depending on the weak acid) were also found to be conserved in the ISA1307 hybrid strain and in Z. bailii CLIB213T genomes (Supplementary Table S10). Among these, conserved genes are the key regulators of S. cerevisiae response to weak acid stress Haa1, War1 and Rim101.13 Most of the genes of the Haa1-, Rim101- or War1- regulons that were described in S. cerevisiae were also found in the ISA1307 predicted proteome (Supplementary Table S10), suggesting that these signalling pathways could also be active and play a role in the intrinsic high resistance of this strain and of the Z. bailii species to weak acids food preservatives and, in particular, to acetic acid. Although the stress signalling pathways described for S. cerevisiae are well conserved in other fungi, there is evidence for a rapid adaptive evolution of these regulatory pathways under the environment challenges to which they are exposed in the different ecological niches.63 The knowledge of the genome sequence of the ISA1307 interspecies hybrid strain opens the door to the in silico and in vivo genome-wide identification of genes and pathways involved in stress resistance in Z. bailii and in this Z. bailii-derived hybrid strain, in particular, of those genes relevant for yeast protection against stresses characteristic of the wine environment.Supplementary dataSupplementary Data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis research was supported by FCT and FEDER through POFC-COMPETE [contracts PEst-OE/EQB/LA0023/2011_research line: Systems and Synthetic Biology PTDC/AGR-ALI/102608/2008, PEst-C/BIA/UI4050/2011, and post-doctoral grant to M.P.

IntroductionMeiotic recombination enhances the genetic diversity in natural populations and contributes to genome evolution. In organisms as diverse as yeasts and mammals, meiotic recombination events do not take place at random but are clustered at specific genomic regions, referred to as recombination hotspots.1,2 Nevertheless, until recently, the molecular basis underlying determination of the hotspots has been elusive.We previously reported that wm7, a wild mouse-derived haplotype of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on chromosome 17, enhances meiotic recombination at a hotspot within the MHC.3 Subsequently, we found that a factor genetically linked to this hotspot determines its recombination rate, and that the wm7 haplotype carries a recombination-enhancing factor.4 Recently, the factor was reported to be a histone methyltransferase, PR/SET domain containing 9 (Prdm9).5–7 Prdm9 mediates histone modifications, such as H3K4me3, and is thought to mark recombination hotspots. Since its identification, many reports have shown that Prdm9 polymorphisms correlate well with site variation in hotspots in different mammalian species, including humans, chimpanzees, and mice.8–12 Genome-wide ChIP analysis with antibodies that recognize DMC1 and RAD51 performed for two different Prdm9 alleles in a common genetic background revealed that Prdm9 variation can account for the site specificity of almost all of the DNA double-strand breaks that initiate meiotic recombination.11 Thus, Prdm9 appears to be a major trans-acting factor for determining the spectrum of hotspots in mice and humans, and perhaps in other mammalian species as well.8–11A Prdm9 knockout mouse shows meiosis arrest, indicating that Prdm9 histone methyltransferase activity is involved in progression of meiosis.13 This function has also been implicated in reproductive isolation, a process that prevents free exchange of genes between two genetically divergent populations, leading to speciation. In crosses between the mouse subspecies Mus musculus domesticus and M. m. musculus, the F1 male hybrids are sometimes sterile. The locus responsible for this hybrid sterility was named Hybrid sterility 1 (Hst1), and mapped to chromosome 17. Recent results revealed that Hst1 is identical to Prdm9, such that Prdm9 became the first speciation gene to be reported in mammalian species.14,15Comprehensive information on Prdm9 polymorphisms in natural populations should provide an important insight into Prdm9 functions, especially in evolution. Past studies have focused on Prdm9 polymorphism in human populations. The results revealed that the worldwide population is quite diverse, with differences including repeat number variations of the zinc finger (ZF) DNA-binding repeat and amino acid substitutions in the zinc finger array (ZFA) of the Prdm9 C-terminal domain.7,10,16,17 Importantly, non-synonymous substitutions preferentially occur at three amino acids along the a-helix domain of the ZF, which are involved in recognition of the hotspot nucleotide motifs.18 Currently, it is thought that hotspot diversity in natural human populations can be attributed to polymorphism of the Prdm9 ZFA.19There are marked advantages to studying Prdm9 polymorphism in natural populations of M. musculus. First, the phylogenetics of M. musculus is well established.20,21Mus musculus is a complex species, and comprises distinct ‘phylogroups’ or subspecies. The results of extensive phylogenetic analysis of Eurasian wild mice revealed that these subspecies diverged roughly 0.5–1.0 million years ago.20 Their habitats are demarcated throughout the Eurasian continent.21,22 Secondly, whereas subspecies of M. musculus are thought to be in an early stage of speciation, neighbouring species, including M. spretus, M. macedonicus, and M. spicilegus, inhabit areas overlapping those of M. musculus.22 Thus, M. musculus and its neighbouring species provide an ideal model system to study phylogeography and speciation. Thus far, mouse Prdm9 polymorphisms has been investigated in commonly used laboratory inbred strains and inbred strains derived from wild mice.5,7,23 However, in these studies, sample collection was limited, as laboratory inbred strains originate predominantly from a single western European subspecies, M. m. domesticus.24,25 Moreover, only a limited number of inbred strains derived from wild-captured mice were included in previous studies.5,23In this study, we extended the population survey to wild mice collected in natural populations of M. musculus subspecies and neighbouring species, as well as inbred strains derived from wild mice. We also investigated Prdm9 polymorphism in mice with the t-haplotype chromosome variant, which is characterized by long inversions on chromosome 17 and is linked to the Prdm9 locus. Genes on the t-haplotype are highly divergent from those on wild-type chromosome 17.26 The results of our study confirm that Prdm9 polymorphisms are concentrated in ZFA with extensive variation of the ZF repeat number and hyper-variation of amino acids at the three DNA recognition sites within the ZF. Our survey of 79 wild-captured mice and 37 inbred strains revealed as many as 57 different Prdm9 alleles in M. musculus. In contrast, some alleles were predominant in two subspecies, M. m. domesticus and M. m. musculus. The overall phylogeography of mouse Prdm9 reflects evolutionary episodes of this species. More importantly, Prdm9 alleles that predominate in one subspecies are often found in territories of other subspecies. Likewise, highly divergent Prdm9 alleles associated with the t-haplotype were found to introgress into all subspecies of M. musculus.2. Materials and methods2.1. MiceNine mouse strains (M. m. molossinus, MSM/Ms; M. m. musculus, NJL/Ms, KJR/Ms, BLG2/Ms, SWN/Ms, CHD/Ms; M. m. castaneus, HMI/Ms; M. m. domesticus, PGN2/Ms, BFM/Ms), one Japanese fancy mouse-derived strain (M. m. molossinus, JF1/Ms), and two MHC congenic mouse strains (B10.R209, B10D2.TCH/+) were maintained at the Genetic Strains Research Center, National Institute of Genetics (NIG). A classical laboratory mouse strain, C57BL/10Snf, was purchased from the Jackson Laboratory and maintained at the NIG. The inbred strain SPR2/Rbrc, derived from M. spretus, was provided by the RIKEN BioResource Center (BRC) through the National BioResource Project, which is funded by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), Japan. Inbred strains used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table S1. All animal experiments were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of NIG.2.2. Prdm9 cDNA synthesisTotal testes RNA from each mouse strain was isolated with Isogen (Nippon Gene). Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized using the Primescript RT reagent kit (TAKARA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.2.3. Mouse genomic DNA samples and PCR conditionsMost genomic DNA samples, including classical inbred and wild-captured mice, were prepared by the Genetic Strains Research Center at the NIG. Some were prepared at Hokkaido University. Several genomic DNA samples were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. Genomic DNA samples from t-haplotype mice were kindly provided by Joe Nadeau or by the RIKEN BRC. All the genomic DNA samples are listed in Supplementary Table S2. To prevent errors in PCR, we used high-fidelity DNA polymerases (KAPA HiFi from Kapa Biosystems or KOD Neo FX from Toyobo). In addition, we repeated independent amplification at least three times for each sample. PCR primer sets and conditions are shown in Supplementary Table S3, and the amplified sites are shown in Supplementary Fig. S6.2.4. Sequence analysisTo determine the sequences of cDNA, ZFA, high SNP region 1 (HSR1) of Prdm9, and intron of T-complex protein 1 (Tcp1), we sequenced PCR products directly or after subcloning. For subcloning, PCR products were extracted with a QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN) after electrophoresis. Then, the purified PCR products were subcloned into pCR-Blunt II-TOPO (Invitrogen). For sequencing, we used the BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems) and a 3130XL DNA Analyser (Applied Biosystems). Primers used for sequence analyses are listed in Supplementary Table S4. We analysed at least six clones per sample and carried out multiple independent experiments for each allele. All sequence data from this study were submitted to the DDBJ Sequence Read Archive (Accession numbers AB843858 to AB844116 and AB846828).2.5. Coding of ZF repeatsThe Prdm9 ZFA nucleotide sequence was conceptually translated (Fig. 1B), and then the sequence of 28 amino acids from 512S to the last residue, which corresponds to the ZFA, was extracted from all ZF repeats. We assigned a one-letter box with a given colour to every ZF repeat that had a given amino acid triad at the most variable positions of the a-helix domain (-1, 3, and 6). When amino acid variation was found for a ZF repeat at less variable positions (-5, -2, and 1), the right bottom of the box was labelled with the variant amino acids. Polymorphisms in Prdm9 cDNA sequences from inbred mouse strains. Amino acid polymorphism of Prdm9 excluding ZFA is summarized. Full-length cDNA of Prdm9 was sequenced for 12 inbred strains derived from M. musculus and one inbred strain derived from a neighbouring species, M. spretus. Nucleotide sequences of the inbred strains were compared with the C57BL/6J reference sequence (NCBI mm9). The C57BL/10J sequence was identical to the reference. Comparison revealed nucleotide substitutions that lead to 16 amino acid substitutions in total, as well as two insertions and one deletion of an amino acid relative to the reference. No amino acid substitution was observed in the PR/SET domains. Upper arrows indicate positions of amino acid variation. An asterisk (*) indicates an interspecific variation (or variation in B10.D2-TCH/+). All amino acid variations are listed in the table below the diagram of Prdm9 protein. The letters S, I, and D in variant types indicate substitution, insertion, and deletion of an amino acid, respectively.Polymorphisms in Prdm9 cDNA sequences from inbred mouse strains.

Phylogenetic analysisTo construct a phylogenetic tree of ZFA, we aligned ZFA repeat units using a progressive multiple sequence alignment algorithm implemented in ClustalW.27 Briefly, each repeat unit was converted to a one-letter code according to the amino acid residues at five signature sites, i.e. the three most variable and two less variable among ZF repeats. Mismatch scores between repeat units were given by the number of different signature sites between two units. The gap open penalty was set to 0.5 and the gap extension penalty we used was 0.1. The algorithm aligns ZF repeat unit sequences by maximizing the alignment score, as is typical for nucleotide and protein sequence alignment. After alignment, the repeat unit sequences were transformed into nucleotide sequences and nucleotide distance was measured using Kimura's two-parameter method.28 A phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbour-joining method29 and implemented using the MEGA 5 software.30 A phylogenetic tree of HSR1 and Tcp1 was similarly constructed using neighbour-joining with Kimura's two-parameter distances. Bootstrap resampling tests were conducted with 1000 iterations.3. Results3.1. Polymorphism in the cDNA sequence of Prdm9To determine the overall nature of mouse Prdm9 polymorphism, we first cloned Prdm9 cDNAs by PCR from total RNAs prepared from the testes of 12 inbred strains (Supplementary Table S1). These comprised seven strains derived from wild-captured mice belonging to different subspecies: two congenic strains harbouring wild-derived Prdm9 alleles, one inbred strain of the Japanese fancy mouse (JF1/Ms), and one inbred strain derived from a different species, M. spretus. The PCR products showed marked variation in size. For each sample, the major band was cloned and then sequenced using a capillary sequencer.Comparison between these 12 sequences yielded a total of 28 nucleotide changes in the 1565-bp Prdm9 ORF, excluding the ZFA (Fig. 1). Of these, 19 cause amino acid changes. When compared with the C57BL/6 reference sequence (NCBI mm9) and our C57BL/10 sequence (this study), insertions and deletions (in/dels) without frame shifts were observed in two strains, CHD/Ms and B10.D2-TCH/+ (Supplementary Fig. S1). No difference was found in the PR/SET domains of the 12 strains examined. In contrast, the repeat numbers of ZF were largely variable among these strains, consistent with changes in the electrophoretic mobility of the PCR products (Supplementary Fig. S2A). In addition, we found numerous nucleotide changes in ZFA. Almost all of these were associated with amino acid changes.3.2. ZFA polymorphism of wild-captured miceWe next extended our survey of Prdm9 ZFA polymorphisms to wild-captured mice. The entire ZFA region is encoded by the last exon. We directly amplified this exon by PCR from genomic DNA from total of 79 wild mice collected at different locations (Supplementary Table S3). The samples include populations belonging to three major M. musculus subspecies and a neighbouring species. To avoid artificial PCR products, we used high-fidelity DNA polymerase and highly stringent conditions. Moreover, PCR primer sets were designed for regions 200 bp apart from both ends of the ZFA to prevent mis-annealing of PCR intermediates. PCR products were separated on an agarose gel and the major band, which displays extensive variation in size among samples (Supplementary Fig. S2B), was subjected to subcloning. When two major bands existed, the both bands were subcloned, as they are likely to represent heterozygous alleles. Reproducibility was confirmed by repeated independent PCR amplifications. More than six clones were sequenced for each sample with two different primer sets. If two types of ZFA sequences were reproducibly obtained, they were judged as heterozygous alleles.We aligned all ZF repeats identified in this study (Fig. 2A). The first ZF repeat appears to be uniform, but the internal ZF repeats were highly variable. In particular, DNA recognition positions -1, 3, and 6 were highly variable (Fig. 2A), consistent with a previous report.17 A lower level of variation was found at positions, -5, -2, and 1. The last repeat tends to be less variable than the internal repeats. In total, we identified 36 unique ZF repeats in ZFA. Of these, 24 are newly identified in this study (Fig. 2A). Amino acid variation in Prdm9 ZF repeats. (A) Multiple alignment of ZF repeat sequences from inbred strains and wild-captured mice. The alignments were made separately for the first repeat, the internal repeats of the ZFA, and the last repeat, as their degrees of variation are different (see text). The a-helix domain of the ZF is shown at top of the internal repeat. The one-letter code is shown to the left of the repeats.

The format of the alignment is the same as that used for mouse Prdm9.We further compared variation in the mouse ZF repeats with those in human PRDM9, as obtained from a public database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore) (Fig. 2B). Amino acids in the backbone of C2H2-class ZFs are well conserved between the two species; however, some species-specific amino acid variations are found. For example, the amino acid at position -2 of the a-helix domain is mostly tyrosine (T) in the mouse, but serine (S) or arginine (R) in humans. The amino acid at position 5 is mostly isoleucine (I) in mouse, but exclusively leucine (L) in human. These positions reside in the a-helix domain, close to the most variable DNA recognition positions, i.e. positions -1 and 6. Amino acid variation is also found within each species. It is conceivable that this variation results in changes to DNA recognition patterns.3.3. Phylogeography of polymorphisms in the ZFA of Prdm9 in natural populationsTo simplify annotation of Prdm9 ZFAs in subsequent analyses, we used a one-letter code to identify each ZF repeat depending on the amino acid triads present at the most variable three positions, -1, 3, and 6, as well as additional alterations (Fig. 2A) (see Materials and Methods for detail). Figure 3 presents an alignment of all ZFA diagrams of wild-captured mice, inbred strains derived from wild mice, and commonly used laboratory inbred strains. The data indicate that wild-captured mice have ZFAs of various lengths. The ZF repeat numbers were between 9 and 16. We could identify as many as 57 ZFA variants within a single species, M. musculus. In addition, we found that neighbouring species of M. musculus have ZFA variant types different from those of M. musculus. ZFA alignment for inbred and wild-captured mice. We first assigned a one-letter coding system to ZFAs (see text), then aligned the ZFA diagrams based on the sequences of classical laboratory strains, wild-derived inbred strains, wild-captured mice, neighbouring species of M. musculus, and t-haplotype bearing mice. Using this code, we easily classified all variant types of ZFA. ZFA boxes are aligned from the N-terminal (left of the diagram) to the C-terminal end of the protein (right of the diagram). The diagrams are categorized into DOM- and CAS-related ZFA variant types (left block), MUS-related ZFA variant type (centre block), and other ZFA types of neighbouring species and t-haplotype (right block). The identification (ID) code for each ZFA diagram is indicated onto the left of the diagram. The names of inbred strains and taxonomy are indicated to the left of the ID codes.ZFA alignment for inbred and wild-captured mice.

After alignment, the phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbour-joining method.29 This phylogenetic analysis revealed that the ZFA variants could be divided into five major groups (Fig. 4A). The localities where the wild mice were collected are then plotted on the territories of three major subspecies of M. musculus (Fig. 4B). Phylogeny and phylogeography of Prdm9 ZFAs.

Japanese wild mice, M. m. molossinus, are a hybrid of two subspecies, MUS and CAS.Group 1 exclusively includes mice collected in the territory of subspecies M. m. musculus (hereafter, MUS), which extends on the North Eurasian continent from Eastern Europe to the Far East. Groups 2, 4, and 5 mainly include mice collected in the territory of subspecies M. m. castaneus (CAS), which includes a wide range, from Southwestern Asia to India, and extends to Southeast Asia, South China, Indonesia, and the southern and northern edges of Japanese islands. Group 3 includes mice collected in the territory of subspecies M. m. domesticus (DOM), which extends from western and southern Europe to the Middle East and the shores around the Mediterranean Sea. Group 3 territory also includes the New World, North and South America, coincident with human migration. This group also includes commonly used classical inbred strains, which are overwhelmingly derived from the DOM lineage.31 Groups 2 and 5 also include a small number of mice collected in the MUS and DOM territories, respectively. Likewise, Group 3 includes one mouse collected in the CAS territory. In the Japanese population, 12 of 13 mice (including two inbred strains) showed only a single ZFA variant type (Ma5), classified as Group 1. The remaining strain has the variant type of Group 4 (Ca2).Altogether, although M. musculus as a whole holds huge variations in ZFA, the mice collected in the MUS and DOM territories exhibit mutually exclusive ZFA variant patterns (Group 1 for MUS and Group 3 for DOM, respectively). The existence of such predominant variant types is not seen in the case of the mice collected in the CAS territory. In this region, ZFA variant types can be further divided into at least the three major groups.We calculated the frequency of wild-captured mice heterozygous for ZFA variant types in different territories of subspecies (Supplementary Fig. S3). The value for the total M. musculus population is 35% (26/74); for DOM, 10% (2/20); for MUS, 44% (11/25); for CAS, 50% (12/24); and for Japanese wild mice (M. m. molossinus), 10% (1/10). These results are consistent with the degree of ZFA diversity observed in the three subspecies populations.3.4. Phylogeny of Prdm9 ZFA in t-haplotype miceB10.D2-TCH/+ is a heterozygous MHC haplotype mouse stock that harbours a recessive lethal mutation. In this stock, the wild-derived MHC haplotype is transmitted to the next generation at a highly distorted ratio (unpublished data). Therefore, we inferred that B10.D2-TCH/+ has t-haplotype (Supplementary Fig. S4). Prdm9 cDNA from this strain did not have polymorphisms observed for other strains in the PR/SET domain; however, unique substitutions were found outside the ZFA, as for M. spretus, in addition to a DOM-type sequence. The result suggests that this stock is heterozygous for DOM-type and more divergent Prdm9 alleles (Fig. 1). Its ZFA has 11 repeats of ZF with a rare type of the amino acid triad. To analyse other strains carrying the t-haplotype, we amplified the ZFA from seven t-haplotype samples, tw5/+, tw71/+, tw75/+, t12/+, tw12/+, t0/+, and tw2/ tw2. With the exception of for tw2, all samples were heterozygous for a DOM-type chromosome. Sequencing of ZFA from all strains showed a rare variant type in addition to a DOM-type ZFA. Notably, the sequence of the rare variant is identical among samples carrying the t-haplotype and B10.D2-TCH/+. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the ZFA sequence associated with the t-haplotype is more divergent from those of the five major groups in M. musculus (Figs 3 and 4A).We compared Prdm9 genome sequences among three inbred strains, C57BL/6J, CAST/EiJ, and PWK/PhJ, which are derived from three subspecies, DOM, CAS, and MUS, respectively. We found nucleotide sequence polymorphism in a 750-bp intronic region of Prdm9 residing in the interval between two exons that encode the PR/SET domain (Supplementary Fig. S5). We named this HSR1 (Fig. 5A). To clarify the phylogeny of regions outside the Prdm9 ZFA, we sequenced HSR1 from different subspecies of wild-captured M. musculus and neighbouring species. We also sequenced a 2.38-kb region that includes introns 8–11 of Tcp1, a t-haplotype marker,26 to analyse the phylogeny of a gene linked to Prdm9. We constructed phylogenetic trees from these two sequences, HSR1 and Tcp1, using the neighbour-joining method.29 For tree construction, M. caroli, which is more divergent from M. musculus than other neighbouring species,20 was used as an outgroup. The overall topology of the Tcp1 tree is similar to the tree based on Prdm9 ZFA (Fig. 5C). In particular, Tcp1 in the t-haplotype has diverged from those in the wild-type chromosome, consistent with a previous report.26 However, the sequence is similar to that found in some mice from the CAS territory. In contrast, the phylogenetic tree of the HSR1 sequence shows that Prdm9 in the t-haplotype is similar to that found in mice from the CAS and DOM territories, but distant from those of mice from the MUS territory (Fig. 5B). These results indicate that the single Prdm9 allele in t-haplotype introgressed into all subspecies of M. musculus, and suggest that intragenic recombination somewhere in the interval between ZFA and HSR1 in the Prdm9 gene occurred in the past.

DiscussionThe results of this study support that the mouse Prdm9 polymorphism is highly polymorphic. Indeed, the degree of the polymorphism of Prdm9 is comparable with that of MHC, which may be maintained by selective advantage.32Prdm9 polymorphisms converged in the ZF repeats and in amino acid positions at -1, 3, and 6 of the a-helix domain, which are extremely variable and are thought to recognize DNA sequences. A lower level of variation was found for amino acid positions -2 and 1 in both mouse and human ZF repeats. We infer that all these positions have been subjected to positive selection to increase the diversity of Prdm9 polymorphism,17 as non-synonymous substitutions preferentially occur at positions -2 and 1, both in mice and in humans. In humans, 19 unique ZF repeats have been identified by extensive analysis of genome sequences from various human populations.5,7,10,17,33 This number is lower than that in mouse (Fig. 2B). It is likely explained by the shorter time of divergence between different human populations, in contrast to a longer period of divergence between different mouse subspecies (i.e. 0.5–1.0 million years).20The first and last ZF repeats showed a lower level of variation when compared with internal repeats. In the first repeat, the first cysteine, which is involved in tertiary structure of the C2H2-class ZF, has been lost. As a consequence, it may not function as authentic ZF (Fig. 2A and B). For the last repeat, the C2H2-class ZF is conserved and amino acids at positions 3 and 6 are variable in mice (Fig. 2A). These positions show a higher ratio of Ka/Ks value (4 : 1), suggesting that they participate in DNA recognition.The most prominent feature of ZFA polymorphism is repeat number variation. In mouse populations, the minimum number of repeats is 9, including the first and last repeats (Fig. 3). This number was found in three mouse subspecies. Longer repeats (15 and 16) are enriched in the MUS territory, although some MUS mice have shorter repeats. In the MUS territory, although mice inhabiting the border with CAS territory carry such shorter repeats, they share ZFA characteristic of the MUS type.The results of our phylogeograpical study clearly show that M. musculus as a species holds extensive Prdm9 polymorphism, owing to large degrees of variation in the ZFA. Within a subspecies lineage, the ZFA variant types tend to be similar, with the exception of the CAS lineage. Even though MUS territory extends long distances, reaching from the Northern Eurasian continent to Eastern Europe and the Far East, most mice collected in this range are exclusively included in Group 1 (Fig. 4A and B). The Japanese population, M. m. molossinus, is a hybrid of two subspecies, MUS and CAS, but its genome is overwhelmingly derived from MUS.34 We found that the majority of mice collected in different localities in Japanese islands have a single ZFA variant type (Ma5) of Group 1. Another variant type (Ca2) in Group 2 (CAS) is carried by one mouse sample with the wm7 MHC haplotype, which was first used for identification of Prdm9 as the hotspot determinant.7 Thus, the present result supports a hybrid origin of M. m. molossinus.34–36Recent studies suggested that Southwest Asia and North India are the likely places of origin of M. musculus.37–39 In this region, three major subspecies lineages, DOM, MUS, and CAS, likely separated from one another in subdivided regions and diverged over a relatively long evolutionary time period of 0.5–1.0 million years. Subsequently, the three lineages dispersed to their present ranges, probably associated with agricultural dispersal by humans.22,37–39 The latter event is estimated to have occurred relatively recently, 10–20 thousand years ago.22,40,41 Eastward MUS lineages from the origin of M. musculus may have reached to the Far East, then migrated to Japanese islands 2–3 thousand years ago through the Korean peninsula as stowaways during the transportation of rice, following preceding CAS migration from Southeast Asia, which might have occurred 5–10 thousand years ago.22 If these evolutionary episodes of M. musculus are correct, then it appears that a large degree of Prdm9 diversity is not always required for survival in natural populations. A single version of the hotspot repertoire has been sufficient to maintain the Japanese population in a time span of at least 2–3 thousand years. Likewise, local populations in MUS and DOM territories have survived for 10–20 thousand years with a limited polymorphism at Prdm9. Regarding the CAS lineage, the high heterogeneity of ZFA in these mice is consistent with data suggesting that CAS consists of multiple sublineages, which show a relatively large degree of genome divergence from one another.22 Given that the CAS territory includes the likely place of origin of M. musculus,41 its heterogeneity is reminiscent of the African human population, which shows greater diversity of Prdm9 ZFA.9 Thus, overall, the phylogeographical features of Prdm9 polymorphism in M. musculus are similar to what has been inferred from information about many other genes.21,22,42 Furthermore, we infer that the requirement for hotspot diversity depends on geographical range and time span in evolution, and that Prdm9 polymorphism has not been maintained by a simple balanced selection in the population of each subspecies.The results of this study show that subspecies-specific Prdm9 variant groups prevail in the demarcated territories of M. musculus subspecies; however, the data also revealed intermingled variant groups in areas where the territory of one subspecies borders another (Fig. 4B). Moreover, except for Group 1, each of the major ZFA variant groups contains small numbers of mice collected in the territory of other subspecies. A more prominent example of intermingled Prdm9 alleles was observed in the case of t-haplotype.Mouse t-haplotype harbours three inversions in chromosome 17.43–45 The nucleotide sequences of t-haplotype associated genes are largely diverged from those of the wild-type chromosome of M. musculus.44,46 At present, in mouse natural populations, t-haplotype is observed in all subspecies of M. musculus at 10–40% of frequency.47,48 It is inferred that t-haplotype has been introgressed into all subspecies of M. musculus 10–20 thousand years ago as a single event, and expanded to all subspecies during agricultural dispersal, due to high distortion of the transmission ratio of t-haplotype relative to wild-type chromosome.44,46 This study clearly shows that t-haplotype mice have unique and characteristic Prdm9 ZFA and intronic (HSR1) sequences. These data support the idea that the t-haplotype is of monophyletic origin. In our phylogenetic trees, Tcp1 and Prdm9 HSR1 in t-haplotype appear in the same clade as those from mice collected in the CAS territory. This suggests that t-haplotype originated in a sublineage of the CAS subspecies and rapidly introgressed into all subspecies of M. musculus.Our phylogenetic analysis also revealed that the topology of the ZFA tree differs from that of the HSR1 tree. This implies that intragenic recombination occurred in the interval between these two regions, despite the fact that they are only 9 kb apart. If ZFA contains a recombination hotspot, an associated frequent and unequal recombination might give rise to repeat number variation of ZFs.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported in part by Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Areas titled ‘Systematical studies of chromosome adaptation’ and ‘Non-coding DNA’ from MEXT, Japan, to T.S. and K.O., respectively, and a grant from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Research Fellowship to H.K.We thank P.

IntroductionGrasses (Poaceae), including rice, wheat, and sorghum, are the most important plant species on the earth, and are a major source of nutrition and sustainable energy.1 To study Poaceae genome will help scientists better understand the mechanisms of how genes control physiological events in Poaceae, and help discover and make use of functional genes from the large amount of Poaceae plants, especially from those able to survive under extreme conditions. Recently, Brachypodium distachyon has been used as a new model organism for Poaceae grass, as it is much more closely related to several economically important Poaceae species such as rice, sorghum, wheat, and turf grasses.The WRKY family genes are plant transcription activators in various physiological processes; they were regarded as the first isolated regulatory genes from plants.2,3 WRKY transcription factors (TFs) are conserved in evolutional history throughout the plant kingdom. Members of this family contain at least one conserved DNA-binding domain with a highly conserved WRKYGQK heptapeptide sequence, followed by a C2H2- or C2HC-type of zinc finger motifs. These conserved sequences have been designated as the WRKY domains, and function in W-box DNA motif (C/T)TGAC(C/T)-binding activation.4 In Arabidopsis thaliana, a total of 72–74 members of the WRKY TFs can be divided into three major groups with several subgroups, based on their sequences in the WRKY domain and their relationships in the phylogenetic clades.4,5 The Group I WRKY TFs contain two WRKY domains, one at the C- and the other at the N-terminal of the protein. These two WRKY domains seem to be functionally redundant.6 Peptide sequences outside the C-terminal WRKY domain contribute significantly to the overall strength of DNA binding; the N-terminal WRKY domain might participate in the binding process by increasing the affinity or specificity to their targets.7–9 In contrast, most Group II and Group III WRKY TFs only contain a single WRKY domain; this domain is more similar in sequence to the C-terminal than to the N-terminal WRKY domain of Group I proteins, suggesting that the C-terminal WRKY domain in Group I WRKY TFs and single WRKY domains in Group II and Group III WRKY TFs are functionally equivalent and constitute the major DNA-binding domain.4 The differences between Groups II and III are in their C-terminal zinc domain.Previous studies have demonstrated that WRKY TFs play essential roles in various physiological processes, including senescence, root development, sugar signalling, and germination.3,10 Furthermore, WRKY TFs have been shown to be involved in responses to various biotic stresses caused by viruses,11 bacterial pathogens,12,13 fungi,14 abiotic stresses,3,15,16 and some signalling substances such as salicylic acid (SA)/benzothiadiazole,17–19 jasmonic acid (JA),18–20 gibberellin,21 and abscisic acid (ABA).22,23 In Arabidopsis, the majority of the 74 WRKY genes are transcriptionally inducible upon pathogen infection and other defence-related stimuli.24 For example, it has been proven that AtWRKY25 functioned as a negative regulator of SA-mediated defence responses to Pseudomonas syringae.13 In Boea hygrometrica leaves, BhWRKY1 is proven to be a regulator in an ABA-dependent signal pathway to regulate BhGolS1 expression.23 Using northern blotting analysis, Qiu et al.15 revealed in rice that 10 of 13 OsWRKY genes were differentially regulated in response to abiotic stress factors NaCl, polyethylene glycol (PEG), cold, and heat. Under a salinity stress, a microarray analysis using 70-mer oligonucleotide probes representing 23 686 genes revealed that 18 AtWRKY genes were induced in A. thaliana root treated with 150 mM NaCl.16 Furthermore, numerous studies have shown that many WRKY genes were responsive to drought, heat, cold, and so on. On the other hand, a single WRKY gene often showed transcription activity in response to several stress factors, indicating that it has different regulatory function in diverse stress responses. For example, the expression of AtWRKY25 and AtWRKY33 were responsive to both heat and salt stress.25,26 Thus, a genome-wide analysis of B. distachyon WRKY genes should help to reveal the underlying complex molecular mechanisms of WRKY proteins in response to various stresses.In our study, 86 WRKY genes were identified from the B. distachyon Bd21 genome and classified according to their homology with known WRKY genes in Oryza sativa. We investigated the evolutionary relationship of B. distachyon WRKY TFs with their counterparts from monocot O. sativa and dicot A. thaliana. Subsequently, we used quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) to examine their transcript profiles in different tissues and in response to several biotic or abiotic stresses and phytohormone treatments. Since BdWRKYs showed various expression patterns and expression levels under a series of abiotic stresses and phytohormone treatments, we checked if there are correlations between the differences in the WRKY domain and their spatial and temporal expression patterns in response to stress treatments. We have also done detailed correlation analyses between promoter cis-elements and the genes expression pattern. Our study provided genome-wide evolutionary characterization and expression analysis of WRKY genes in B. distachyon, an important step for further investigation into the functions of these genes.2. Materials and methods2.1. Sequence retrievalWe performed a BLAST search among sequenced genomes of land plants in plantTFDB,27 GramineaeTFDB,28 Superfamily, and Phytozome (http://www.Phytozome.net) using well-known plant WRKY proteins as queries. The database of UniProt (http://www.uniprot.org/blast/) and GeneBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) were used for searching the WRKY proteins in red and green algae. To verify the reliability of our results, all putative non-redundant sequences were assessed with UniProt and SMART (http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/) analyses, respectively.2.2. Identification of WRKY protein in B. distachyonTo identify B. distachyon genes encoding WRKY proteins with at least one possible WRKY domain, we performed a GeneBank BLASTP search, UniProt, and B. distachyon genome Database (http://www.brachypodium.org/), using the amino acid sequences of the WRKY domain. The Brachy WRKY Database (http://www.igece.org/WRKY/BrachyWRKY/BrachyWRKYIndex.html) was used as a referral for verifying the reliability of our results.29 We also obtained information of the chromosome locations of each gene from the results of BLASTP at the B. distachyon genome Database. A total of 86 BdWRKY genes were found in B. distachyon (Supplementary Table S1). Furthermore, to avoid confusion, we used the same numbering system as Tripathi et al.292.3. Sequence analysisTo analyse the sequence of the 86 typical identified B. distachyon WRKY proteins, we performed multiple alignment analyses of the WRKY domains sequence by ClustalW (www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/).302.4. Phylogenetic analysisA neighbour-joining (NJ) tree was constructed using the MEGA version 5 software,31 based on the alignment of WRKY domains in O. sativa, A. thaliana, and B. distachyon. To determine the statistical reliability, we conducted bootstrap analysis with the following parameters: p-distance and pairwise deletion. Bootstrap analysis was performed with 1000 replicates.2.5. Protein motifs and structure analysisAnalysis for conserved motifs in the WRKY proteins was carried out using MEME (http://meme.sdsc.edu/meme/cgi-bin/meme.cgi).32 The settings were: any number of repetitions of a single motif, the minimum width of a motif with six amino acids, the maximum width of a motif with 80 amino acids, and the maximum number of motifs up to 15 amino acids. Subsequently, the MAST program was used to search detected motifs in protein databases.33 The details of sequence logo of motifs were shown in Supplementary Fig. S1.2.6. Cluster analysis of expression dataThe 2-week-old seedlings (Bd21) were used for harvesting leaf, stem, and root samples. For phytohormone analysis, 2-week-old seedlings were treated in MS liquid medium containing 100 µM methyl jasmonate (MeJA), 100 µM ABA, 1 mM SA, and 20 µM 6-Benzylaminopurine (6-BA) for 3 h, respectively. For abiotic stress treatment, 2-week-old seedlings were treated in MS liquid medium containing 20% PEG, 200 mM NaCl, and 10 mM H2O2 for 3 h, respectively. Cold and heat treatments were achieved by placing 2-week-old seedlings in MS liquid medium at 4 or 45°C for 3 h, respectively. For phytopathogen treatment, 2-week-old seedlings were sprayed with Fusarium graminearum (F0968) and two strains of Magnaporthe grisea (Guy11, avirulent ACE1 genotype; PH14, virulent ACE1 genotype) for 4 or 12 h. The BdWRKY array constituted of 86 primer sets representing all members of the B. distachyon WRKY gene family. The primer sets are listed in Supplementary Table S2. The expression of the 86 BdWRKY genes was assessed upon the qPCR result analysis. Each experiment was repeated three separate times. The expression profile was calculated from the –<U+0394><U+0394>CT value [-<U+0394><U+0394>CT = (CTcontrol.gene - CTcontrol.actin) - (CTtreat.gene - CTtreat.actin)], and obtained by the PermutMatrixEN vesion 1.9.3 software, and shown by a green-red gradient. The data were statistically analysed using an OriginPro 7.5 software. The up-regulated genes were defined as a fold change greater than 1.5 with a P-value of <0.05, and with a fold change of =0.66 was used to define down-regulated genes when the P-value of <0.05.2.7. Promoter analysisThe 1500 bp promoter sequences of BdWRKY genes were obtained from the B. distachyon genome Database. PLANT CARE (http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webto<U+200B>ols/plantcare/html/) was used to determine the cis-acting regulatory elements and to analyse the BdWRKY gene promoter sequences.343. Results and discussion3.1. Distribution of WRKY domain-containing proteins in plant kingdomWRKY domain-containing proteins are extensively found in plants, some fungi, bacteria, and slime moulds. Here, we searched for WRKY genes in six comprehensive datasets, GenBank, UniProt, plantTFDB, GramineaeTFDB, Superfamily, and Phytozome of plant species. In this study, we focused our search and analyses on six major types of model organisms whose genomes have been already sequenced, including red alga, the chlorophytes, the moss, the lycophyte, the eudicots, and the monocots.35,36 The result showed that, as a gene super family that plays important roles in regulation of defence response pathways, WRKY TFs conservatively existed in plant kingdom (Fig. 1). In general, only a few of WRKY homologous genes could be found in algae genome, while plants possess a large number of WRKY genes (Fig. 1). The results indicated that the earliest evolutionary origin of the gene containing the WRKY was from unicellular green algae of chlorophyta, suggesting that WRKY proteins arose before plants transitioned from water to land. With the evolution of species, the land plants have developed a series of highly sophisticated mechanisms that help them to adapt to changing environmental conditions,37 and hence, the number of WRKY TFs increased and they were extensively found in land plants in response to the environmental stimuli and regulation of physiological reactions.

Chromosomal distribution and duplication events of BdWRKY genesTo date, the information regarding expansion events of the BdWRKY gene family in B. distachyon remains unclear. To investigate the relationship between genetic divergence and gene duplication within the BdWRKY gene family in B. distachyon, we determined the chromosomal locations of BdWRKYs based on the information from the B. distachyon genomic database (http://www.brachypodium.org/). The result showed that the BdWRKYs were distributed throughout all the five B. distachyon chromosomes, most BdWRKYs were distributed on Chromosomes 1 and 2 (Fig. 2). Then, the distribution appeared to be uneven. Relatively high densities of BdWRKYs were observed on the top and at the bottom arms of Chromosome 2. In contrast, low densities were detected in Chromosomes 3, 4, and 5. Subsequently, we analysed the gene cluster expansion events of BdWRKYs in the B. distachyon genome. Based on the phylogenetic relationship and sequence similarity, we identified 15 pairs of BdWRKY genes with high levels of protein sequence similarity. For instance, the entire protein sequences of BdWRKY33 and BdWRKY41 shared 71% similarity, whereas those of BdWRKY81 and BdWRKY82 shared 64% similarity. Among BdWRKY genes with a high degree of homology, 8 (53%) pairs of BdWRKYs reside within chromosomal segments that have clear relatives in the B. distachyon genome, suggesting that they may have evolved from duplication events. As shown in Fig. 2, two of those multiple pairs of duplicated regions were located at Chromosome 2, and the others distributed on Chromosomes 3 and 5 (Fig. 2, bars with numbers).

The bars with numbers on the chromosomes indicate the four predicted duplication regions.In general, plants can integrate alternative developmental pathways during evolution, and then choose suitable pathways in their growth and development in response to different environmental cues.38 It is believed that multiple members of a specific gene family that form a large regulative network to control complicated physiological processes were a result of the long evolutionary history of a particular species.39,40 The individual members of a gene family represent a succession of genomic rearrangements and expansions during the process of evolution.41 In this study, we found at least four putative segmental duplication events in the B. distachyon genome; and those duplications influenced the distribution of BdWRKY genes in B. distachyon. Particularly, the putative duplications between BdWRKY33/36 and BdWRKY41/42 were highly similar. Moreover, on the putative segmental duplications of the Chromosome 2, the order of the BdWRKY genes (including BdWRKY30/81/51/56/46) arrangement on the top arm of Chromosome 2 was similar to those of the BdWRKY genes (including BdWRKY82/53/16/58/45) at the bottom arm of this chromosome. BdWRKY33 and BdWRKY36 are on a segment of Chromosome 5, and this segment is likely a duplicate of a segment on Chromosome 3 where BdWRKY41 and BdWRKY42 are located (Fig. 2). The motif structure of BdWRKY33 is identical with BdWRKY41, while there were only a few differences between BdWRKY36 and BdWRKY42, suggesting that the C-terminal of the segmental duplications on Chromosomes 3 and 5 might diverge to perform new functions during the process of evolution (Fig. 2). Thus, it is inferred that the new gene initially resulted from the duplication, and thereafter diverge from a series of synonymous and/or non-synonymous mutations.3.3. Characteristics of BdWRKY domainsThe gene family of TFs usually contain highly conserved domain or domains involved in DNA binding.42 Assigning structural domains to protein sequences is important in performing a comprehensive analysis of highly divergent sequences in large gene families.43 Based on both the number of WRKY domains and the features of their zinc finger-like motif, the BdWRKY can be classified into three main groups, consistent with the previous report.29 The WRKY TFs with two WRKY domains belong to the Group I, while most proteins with one WRKY domain belong to the Group II (Supplementary Fig. S2). Generally, Group I and Group II WRKY TFs share the same type of zinc finger-like motif with a C2H2 zinc ligand (C–X4–5–C–X22–23–H–X1–H; Supplementary Fig. S2). There is a small subset of BdWRKY TFs containing a C2HC motif (C–X7–C–X 23–H–X1–C; Supplementary Fig. S2), and this subset is assigned to Group III. Although the WRKYGQK heptapeptide sequence was highly conserved in BdWRKY TFs, sequence similarity beyond the domains is quite low among most genes. As we know, a protein domain is considered as an evolutionary unit of protein function and the domain coding sequence can be duplicated and/or recombined.44 From recent research on genomes analysis, new protein functionalities appear to arise from the addition or exchange of protein domains by duplicating one or more domains, recombining fragments of DNA from different organisms, and diverging duplicated sequences by base substitutions, deletions, and insertions.41,45 Therefore, the whole family of BdWRKY TFs, which might result from long-time evolutionary history, represented divergent WRKY domains, even in much closely related gene pairs, such as BdWRKY33/41, BdWRKY24/54, BdWRKY81/82, and so on.To further investigate the evolutionary relationships among the WRKY domains from different species, we estimated the phylogeny by using the NJ program from MEGA 5 for the WRKY domains from O. sativa, A. thaliana, and B. distachyon. All subgroups were present in monocots and eudicots (Fig. 3), indicating that the appearance of most WRKY TFs in plants predates the divergence of monocot/eudicots. Meanwhile, no species-speci<U+FB01>c subgroups and/or clades were observed in O. sativa, A. thaliana, or B. distachyon, implying that WRKY family genes were more conserved during evolution. In addition, WRKY domains from the same lineage tend to cluster together in the phylogenetic tree, suggesting that they experienced duplications after the lineages diverged (Fig. 3). Furthermore, WRKY phylogenetic tree showed almost the same clustering patterns in O. sativa and B. distachyon (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table S3). In total, about 62 pairs of WRKY domains from O. sativa and B. distachyon were clustered as pairs, indicating that they might be the orthologous WRKY domains (Fig. 3). For example, the WRKY domains of BdWRKY54 and OsWRKY31 are highly similar, indicating that some consensus in domain may have existed before the divergence of B. distachyon and O. sativa. Meanwhile, only two pairs of WRKY domains from B. distachyon and A. thaliana could be clustered as pairs, suggesting that the BdWRKY domains are evolutionarily more closely related to OsWRKY domains, which is consistent with the notion that both B. distachyon and O. sativa belong to monocots. The phylogenetic similarity found in O. sativa and B. distachyon WRKY domain suggests that they may have evolved conservatively. NJ analyses of 301 WRKY domains from O. sativa, A. thaliana, and B. distachyon, containing 262 plant WRKY proteins.

The domains clustered into eight major subgroups, IN, IC, IIa, IIb, IIc, IId, IIe, and III.3.4. Protein structure and tissue-specific expression pattern of BdWRKYBased on sequence similarity and protein structure, we also divided the 86 members of the BdWRKY TFs into seven subgroups (I, IIa–e, and III) (Fig. 4A and B). Remarkably, the WRKY domains were almost identical, even though the lengths of the coding region of the WRKY genes were different, and the cluster result based on whole BdWRKY sequences was different from the clustering based on BdWRKY domains. A schematic representing the structure of all members of BdWRKY TFs was constructed from the MEME motif analysis results (Fig. 4B).32 Most members of the BdWRKYs shared three motifs, Motif 3, Motif 2, and Motif 1 linked in order. A few members, such as BdWRKY8, BdWRKY65, BdWRKY72, and BdWRKY75, showed quite different protein structures compared with other members (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, many of the motifs were selectively distributed among the specific clades in the phylogenetic tree, for example, Motif 8 in Group IIe, and Motif 15 in Group I. The clustered BdWRKY pairs, i.e. BdWRKY81/82, BdWRKY31/63, showed highly similar motif distribution (Fig. 4B). The motifs and their arrangement in the BdWRKYs are similar among proteins within subfamilies, demonstrating that the protein architecture is remarkably conserved within a specific subfamily. The biological functions of many WRKYs remain to be elucidated. The above findings may facilitate the identification of functional units in BdWRKYs and lead to the discovery of their roles in plant growth and development.

The expression values of the 86 BdWRKY genes were assessed upon the qPCR result analysis.TFs usually harbour many types of DNA-binding domains and they can be grouped into a handful of different, often large, gene families.46 By forming intricate networks, TFs control the expression of genes in a genome at the transcriptional level.47 It has been noted previously that many TF gene families exhibit great disparities in abundance among different organisms and different tissues to exert different physiological functions. Thus, gene expression patterns can provide important clues for gene function. To further analyse the tissue specificity of the WRKY gene family members, we confirmed their transcription levels in three different tissues, leaves, stems, and roots. The expression of all of the WRKY gene family members was detected in all three tissues (Fig. 4C). The results revealed that several BdWRKY genes, including BdWRKY7, -24, -31, -38, -61, and -64, showed higher expression levels than other members of the WRKY family in all the tissues tested. The expression of BdWRKY78 was highly induced in the root while its expression level was relatively low in the leaf and stem. BdWRKY32, -41, -73, and -74 showed higher expression levels in the stem than that in the leaf and root (Fig. 4C). The expression pattern of these genes suggested that BdWRKYs were involved in the growth and development of organs or tissues under specific conditions. Interestingly, most of clustered gene pairs showed the same expression pattern, such as BdWRKY31/63, BdWRKY81/82, BdWRKY77/80, and so on. On the other hand, gene pairs BdWRKY37/60, BdWRKY36/42, BdWRKY56/58, and other clustered pairs exhibited different expression patterns (Fig. 4C). These results indicated that most of clustered gene pairs had more similarities in the WRKY domain and shared similar expression patterns; they might be functionally redundant. The BdWRKY pairs that showed different expression levels may be involved in different signalling pathways. Since the expression of genes was regulated by a series of TFs, the disparities in abundance of BdWRKY gene among different tissues suggested that the BdWRKY genes, although are TFs themselves, were also regulated by other TFs in different tissues.3.5. Expression profiles of BdWRKY upon multiple phytohormone treatments and abiotic or biotic stressesIt has been demonstrated that WRKY genes were not only involved in the activation of plant defence systems,48 but also played key roles in the control of plants' response to environmental stimuli.3 Since it has been thought that BdWRKY genes are responsive to plant defence-related phytohormones, we investigated the expression profiles of the WRKY family genes in B. distachyon after phytopathogen treatments. A total of three phytopathogens, including F. graminearum (F0968) and two strains of M. grisea (Guy11, avirulent ACE1 genotype; PH14, virulent ACE1 genotype), were used to inoculate Bd21 seedling in this study. The expression profiles of the BdWRKY family genes at 4 hpi (hour post-inoculation) and 12 hpi were shown in Fig. 5A. The data demonstrated that a large number of BdWRKY genes were rapidly and significantly up-regulated after inoculation of phytopathogen within 4 h. At least 15 BdWRKY genes were up-regulated by all three phytopathogens treated, while nine BdWRKY genes were induced after single phytopathogen inoculation, such as BdWRKY8, -34, -50, -69, -70, and so on. As shown in Fig. 5A, the expression levels of BdWRKY21, -37, -69, and -70 increased remarkably at 4 hpi, and decreased at 12 hpi after F0968 treatment. However, several BdWRKY genes (BdWRKY1, -9, -29, etc.) were up-regulated 12 h after F0968 inoculation. These data suggested that BdWRKY21, -37, -69, and -70 were the early response TFs upon phytopathogen F0968 attack, while BdWRKY1, -9 and -29 were induced at the second stage of the F0968 infection. Interestingly, numbers of BdWRKY genes (e.g. BdWRKY3, -72 and -77) were induced faster by PH14 than by Guy11. They were up-regulated at 4 hpi after infection by PH14, but at 12 hpi, they were down-regulated by PH14 and up-regulated by Guy11. Since the pathogenic ability of virulent ACE1 genotype (PH14) was stronger than the wild-type Guy11, these results suggested that the expression of BdWRKY genes were very sensitive to biotic stress and the regulation of BdWRKYs were important to plant defence. BdWRKY as TF genes were first induced or repressed by phytopathogen, and then, were involved in the regulation of plant defence gene expression.

The expression of the 86 BdWRKY genes was assessed upon the qPCR result analysis.Similarly, the expression profiles of the BdWRKY family genes under different stress conditions were also examined using the qRT-PCR in our study. A total of five stress types, i.e. heat, cold, NaCl, PEG, and H2O2, were tested in this study. Detailed expression profiles of the WRKY family genes under different stress conditions were provided in Supplementary Table S4. Heatmap representation of expression profiles of these WRKY family genes under different stress conditions are shown in Fig. 5B. The data revealed that 60 and 80% of BdWRKY genes were up-regulated under heat and cold stress conditions, respectively. More than 50% of the BdWRKY genes were up-regulated under more than one stress conditions. For examples, BdWRKY10, -33, -59, and -65 were up-regulated in both heat and cold treatments, while BdWRKY81 showed a high up-regulation under heat and salt stresses. It has been reported that the severity of the stress and the metabolic status of the plant affected the capacity of plant to tolerate abiotic stress.49 ABA as a phytohormone plays an important role in integrating various abiotic or biotic stress signals and controlling downstream stress responses.49 Here, our data indicated that almost 50% of the BdWRKY genes were down-regulated under three or more stress conditions, which is consistent with the results of most BdWRKY gene down-regulated by ABA treatment. For example, BdWRKY19, -22, -51, and -52 were down-regulated by PEG (drought stress), and similarly, their expression levels were very low after ABA treatment. These correlations of BdWRKY genes expression levels between abiotic stress and phytohormone treatment suggest that BdWRKY regulation of downstream gene expression may be linked to stress-induced phytohormone alteration.Recent studies of the OsWRKY genes have also shown that many of OsWRKY genes were responsive to JA, SA, and ABA treatments.50,51 It has also been reported that WRKY TFs were key factors for the increased transcript abundance of SA- and JA-responsive genes.52–54 To investigate the hormonal control mechanisms underlying BdWRKY gene expression, we treated Bd21 seedlings with four phytohormones, MeJA, SA, 6-BA, and ABA, respectively and analysed the changes in transcript abundance of these 86 BdWRKY genes using qRT-PCR. Our results demonstrated that most of BdWRKY genes were repressed by ABA after 3 h of treatment (Fig. 6A). In contrast, 52 of the 86 BdWRKY genes were up-regulated within 3 h treatment of 6-BA. Only three and eight BdWRKY genes exhibited increased expression levels in response to MeJA and SA treatments, respectively. Seven of 86 BdWRKY genes exhibited positive modulation of expression in response to two phytohormones, while only BdWRKY25 showed up-regulation in response to all four phytohormones. Interestingly, BdWRKY14 showed very high expression after SA treatment, even though its expression level was decreased after MeJA or ABA treatment. It has been reported that the expression of two genes, OsWRKY45 and -62 (OsWRKY71 and -14 in this paper, respectively), were increased in SA (SA)-treated rice leaves.50 Similarly, BdWRKY11 and -14 (the homologous genes of OsWRKY45 and -62) also showed a rapid increase after SA treatment. The results indicated that some homologous genes between O. sativa and B. distachyon share functional conservation. On the other hand, our data also revealed that a number of B. distachyon homologous of rice WRKY genes (e.g. OsWRKY48/BdWRKY38) did not show similar expression patterns, suggesting that the functions of some genes were altered during the evolution. According to the statistical analysis, there is a good correlation between the number of MeJA-inducible cis-element and the expression levels in most BdWRKY genes after 3 h MeJA treatment (Fig. 6B and C, and Supplementary Fig. S4). Similarly, the number of SA-inducible cis-element showed a good correlation with the expression levels of most BdWRKY genes after 3 h SA treatment (Fig. 6D).

IntroductionSequence annotation is the process of associating biological information to sequences of interest. Annotations can include the potential function, cellular localization, biological process or protein structure of a given sequence.1 Some sequences are annotated using direct experimental evidence, but most annotations are inferred from sequence similarities or conserved patterns associated with known characteristics.2–5 Large publically accessible databases of annotated sequences make it possible to automatically annotate large collections of unknown sequences. This is especially valuable for the interpretation of large sequence datasets generated by genome and expressed sequence tag (EST) sequencing projects as well as gene and protein expression experiments, such as DNA microarrays, and many other emerging research areas.6Sequence annotation is also important in transcriptomic experiments that aim to identify gene clusters with similar expression patterns that are linked to a particular biological process or experimental condition. Biological function can then be inferred from annotations shared within these clusters.7Several methods have been developed for the annotation of the large datasets generated by sequencing projects. These methods typically perform homology-based searches and infer annotations from sequences with high levels of homology to the query sequence. To detect sequence similarity, most methods use BLAST, a fast heuristic algorithm for identifying homology between sequences based on local sequence alignments.8Blast2GO is one of the most widely used tools for genomic annotation.9 It performs three steps: a BLAST search, a step that maps similar sequences to existing annotation associations, and finally term annotation. As its name suggests, Blast2GO mainly uses terms from the Gene Ontology (GO) controlled vocabulary for annotation,10 although it also includes other annotation classes. However, Blast2GO is most commonly run online, which can make it more difficult to analyse large collections of sequences. Other methods can be installed locally, and so avoid problems associated with remote execution, such as sequence number limitations or resource thresholds. Blast2GO is also available in an offline form, but installation requires knowledge of relational databases that make it less suitable for routine use and difficult for non-specialist users. AutoFact11 can perform several types of BLAST search using locally downloaded domain and motif databases. However, it uses databases with descriptive non-standard annotation entries rather than controlled vocabularies such as GO. The resulting lack of homogeneity in terms of vocabulary or syntax can make it much more difficult to automatically assign annotations or evaluate annotation quality.The above methods can be applied to a wide range of different sequence types and organisms. Many other tools are specialized for specific applications. Some tools only deal with single annotation classes, as is the case for Gotcha, which only uses GO terms.12 Others are specialized for the annotation of specific sequence types, such as the EST-specific ESTAnnotator13 and EST-PAC.14 In addition, some tools are designed especially for the annotation of specific organisms. For example, BLANNANOTATOR assigns non-standard annotations to bacterial sequences.15Some platforms allow diverse data sources to be integrated for the purposes of sequence annotation and annotation analysis. For example, the Babelomics suite,16 of which Blast2GO is part, contains tools for assigning interactions, pathways or even regulatory annotations to analysed sequences. Another widely used platform is DAVID,17 which extracts functional annotations from a variety of public genome resources, and allows subsequent analysis by biological enrichment. One of the richest annotation sources is BioMart,18 which retrieves sequence annotations from Ensembl and other databases.All of these annotation methods use BLAST to detect and evaluate the similarity between a query sequence and putative homologues.8 For each query sequence, BLAST attempts to create alignments with database sequences and uses these alignments to judge sequence similarity. Most annotation methods select the database sequence with the highest overall similarity score for each query sequence as the donor of annotation information. In addition, a minimum similarity threshold sets the limit below which sequences will be rejected even if they are the most similar sequence in the database. Defining the similarity threshold is not an easy task, as it must balance annotation quality and sequence coverage (SC). Moreover, it has been shown that the optimal similarity threshold can vary between different sequence types.19 Several other BLAST variables, such as how it scores alignment gaps, can also result in significantly different results. These factors can be difficult to configure, particularly for non-specialist users.We have developed Sma3s, a fast, accurate and flexible annotation tool specifically designed for the annotation of large collections of sequences obtained from diverse gene libraries or coding sequence datasets. It is comprised of three modules that solve the annotation process with progressively less-stringent sequence similarity requirements, combined with methods to optimize specificity. Each module uses an initial exhaustive BLAST search as its starting point. The third Sma3s module enhances annotation quality using term enrichment to identify annotations shared by groups of similar sequences. We have defined optimal default Sma3s parameter values to minimize user intervention for most applications, thus aiding consistency and comparability. We show that Sma3s can rapidly produce high levels of prediction accuracy with minimal human supervision and modest computational resources.2. Materials and methods2.1. ImplementationSma3s was written in Perl using modules of the BioPerl 1.6 project (http://www.bioperl.org) and is freely accessible from the Sma3s website (http://www.bioinfocabd.upo.es/sma3s/). Sma3s uses two programmes from the Blast package: blastp for amino acid sequences and blastx for nucleotide sequences, using an E-value threshold of 10-6, and blastclust for sequence clustering procedures. A Perl biological enrichment module, based on hypergeometric distribution, was used to calculate probability values (http://www.cse.huji.ac.il/course/2006/bioskill/Ex2/HyGe.pm).Sma3s uses the UniProt database in plain-text format files (file.dat), corresponding to the taxonomic division of the organism under study, as its main data source. More details about programme requirements and operation are available on the website.Running on a dual-processor Intel Pentium 4 CPU 3.00 GHz with 4 Gb of RAM, the programme takes an average of 0.7 s to annotate each sequence (mean length = 400 amino acids) against a division of the Swiss-Prot database (~45 000 sequences), using the three modules. In fact, the most time-consuming process (~90%) is the initial exhaustive BLAST (blastp or blastx), whose results are then reused in subsequent parameter tuning and annotation refinement steps.2.2. Annotation typesUniProt20 is arguably the most complete publically available protein database. Human-based curation ensures high-quality annotations, which is particularly evident in the Swiss-Prot section, compared with the automatically annotated TrEMBL section (also part of UniProt). Sma3s uses Swiss-Prot as its main source for extracting annotations. The UniProt fields used by Sma3s are:GO10 provides a controlled vocabulary to describe genes and gene product attributes. It is organized into three biological ontologies: molecular function, biological process and cellular component. Standardized GO term annotations are included in the cross-reference (DR) field of UniProt.InterPro21 is an integrated documentation resource of protein families, domains and sites. It combines complementary sequence pattern information from several databases. UniProt provides InterPro identifiers also from the DR field.The Swiss-Prot keywords constitute a well-defined and controlled vocabulary of terms used to annotate a UniProt protein entry. These keywords (the KW field in UniProt) describe functions, biological processes, structure, cellular localization and other protein characteristics.This annotation provides a description of the metabolic pathway(s) in which a protein is involved. It is obtained from the comment (CC) field containing generic and specific metabolic pathway descriptors (e.g.: -!- PATHWAY: Nucleotide metabolism; purine metabolism). Sma3s gathers annotations of the most generic level (‘Nucleotide metabolism’ in the previous example). This type of annotation is particularly useful for identifying co-expressed genes that are active in the same metabolic pathway.New annotation types can be incorporated into Sma3s with only minor changes to its algorithms.2.3. Threshold calculation for the selection of multiple homologous sequences2.4. Statistical significance analysis of annotationsEach term assigned by Sma3s' prediction algorithm is assigned a P-value to indicate annotation quality. Annotations from Module 3 take P-values from a biological enrichment calculation, while those from Modules 1 and 2 are derived from the highest rated BLAST hit.The cut-off P-value was determined experimentally to be =0.1 (see the Results section).2.5. Accuracy estimationSma3s assesses three different ratios to evaluate method accuracy taking into account test sets of previously annotated sequences. These ratios are based on TP (true positives: predicted terms corresponding to the real annotation), FP (false positives: predicted terms not corresponding to the real annotation) and FN (false negatives: non-predicted real terms).To evaluate prediction coverage percentages, two more values were calculated: the SC (the number of sequences with predicted annotations with respect to sequences with known annotations) and term coverage (TC, the number of predicted annotations with respect to known annotations).2.6. Test datasetsAll the databases used in this work belong to the UniProt Knowledgebase Release 2011_08, which were obtained from the EBI ftp-site: ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/knowledgebase/taxonomic_divisions/.We downloaded four taxonomic divisions (bacteria, plants, invertebrates and mammals) and built five independent random datasets of 1000 sequences (5000 in total) for each taxonomic division. These datasets were processed with Sma3s. Query sequences were removed from the database before each run to avoid self-annotation.We extracted two independent DNA arrays from the GEO database:25 Affymetrix Murine 11K SubB Array (AC:GPL76) and the Affymetrix Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Array (AC:GPL198). The nucleotide sequences from these arrays were downloaded, and sequences shorter than 150 were removed (to ensure a minimum amino acid sequence length of 50). Reference annotations were taken from both Affymetrix-assigned GO terms and GO terms extracted from the Swiss-Prot entries referred to in the Affymetrix annotation.2.7. Blast2GO and Top-BLAST testsWe opened Blast2GO as a Java application (http://www.blast2go.com/b2ghome), selecting the 2Gb memory version, as would be typical for non-expert users performing a search with default parameters. The test did not include graphical data mining or enrichment analysis Blast2GO options. For Top-BLAST annotation, the best hit from a default BLAST search was used to annotate every sequence in the dataset. Self-prediction in Blast2GO (annotation based on annotations from the query sequence) was unavoidable, since dataset sequences cannot be removed from the database.3. Results3.1. Sma3s algorithm overviewWith Sma3s, we set out to develop a tool that can intelligently assign annotations to query sequences in a way that maximizes accuracy without sacrificing coverage, and works in a way that is robust enough to generate high-quality results without having to adjust the parameters.To achieve these aims, we designed Sma3s as a modular system that processes query sequences in a series of discrete steps. The method starts with a BLAST similarity search, followed by a three-step annotation process which sequentially tests different degrees of similarity between query and database sequences (Fig. 1). The first module annotates query sequences using database homologues with very high levels of similarity (Fig. 1, M1). The second module performs a reciprocal BLAST on sequences unannotated in the first step to generate annotations from orthologous database sequences (Fig. 1, M2). The third module uses a novel strategy (Fig. 1, M3) that looks for more distantly related sequences and analyses these data for statistically significant sequence annotations. Sma3s workflow. The first M1 module derives annotations from highly similar sequences stored in the database, choosing sequences using the Top-BLAST method, which selected the highest similarity homologue from each BLAST search that meets the minimum similarity criteria. The remaining sequences are passed to the second module (M2), which performs reciprocal BLAST searches to identify orthologous sequences as annotation sources, also using the Top-BLAST method. Finally, the M3 module obtains annotations from a set of related sequences whose similarity is supported by statistically significant concentrations of similar annotations, filtered by clustering techniques to avoid over-representation from duplicated gene families. This figure appears in colour in the online version of DNA Research.Sma3s workflow.

Finally, the M3 module obtains annotations from a set of related sequences whose similarity is supported by statistically significant concentrations of similar annotations, filtered by clustering techniques to avoid over-representation from duplicated gene families. This figure appears in colour in the online version of DNA Research.Module 1: The first annotator uses a Top-BLAST strategy to check whether the query sequence (or one very similar to it) already exists in the UniProt database, and then directly assigns database annotations to the query sequence. We established a minimum sequence identity of 90% and a sequence overlap of at least 90% of the database sequence, although these parameters are customizable. In all cases, Sma3s uses annotations from Swiss-Prot in preference to TrEMBL when identical amino acid sequences are found in both databases (Table 1, see the next section for details). Sma3s results with different source databasesSequence coverage (SC), specificity (Sp), sensitivity (Sn) and REQ values are shown together with the corresponding standard deviation.Sma3s results with different source databasesSequence coverage (SC), specificity (Sp), sensitivity (Sn) and REQ values are shown together with the corresponding standard deviation.Module 2: This module annotates using information from putative orthologues with lower similarity. The second module of Sma3s is based on reciprocal BLAST searches. It detects lower similarity sequences with at least 75% of per-residue identity, covering at least 75% of database sequence length. The best hit is then used as an input seed in a blastp or tblastn search against the initial set of query sequences. If this second BLAST identifies the starting query sequence as the best hit, then an orthology relationship is established, and consequently, the annotation recovered. As in the previous step, Sma3s uses Swiss-Prot annotations in preference to TrEMBL (Table 1, see the next section for details).Module 3: Module 3 recovers annotation information from multiple homologous sequences using a novel multi-step approach. The first step is to determine which homologues have sufficient similarity to the query sequence. Work by Sander22 and Rost23 found that minimum alignment length was a better criterion than overall percentage sequence identity for estimating sequence and structural homology, especially when comparing pairs of structurally matched proteins with lower levels of similarity. Intuitively, for short sequence alignments, a high percentage identity is needed to establish statistically significant relationships. Conversely, long pairwise alignments require lower identity to be qualified as significant. In the context of protein structure, a minimum threshold of ~20% was found to be a good predictor of protein structure, provided that the alignment had a length of at least 150 residues. Function is less well conserved than structure, but further studies have reported that biological function is typically conserved when two sequences exhibit 40% sequence identity.24 Thus, based on the hypothesis that function conservation is also related to sequence alignment length, we have used a modified form of Rost's equation (see Materials and Methods for details) that only selects sequences whose alignments have at least 40% identity at any alignment length.Although the sequences selected by this method can have significantly lower similarities to those identified by Modules 1 and 2, the combined analyses of multiple sequences can be used to increase annotation reliability. This is based on the hypothesis that annotations shared by several homologous sequences are more likely to reflect functions shared by the query sequence. Module 3 uses biological enrichment to only select those terms which appear more frequently in the identified homologues than would be expected by chance in the source database (see ‘Statistical significance assessment of annotations’ in the Materials and Methods section for details).The presence of several redundant sequences in the search results could bias the term enrichment algorithm. To reduce this possibility, very similar sequences are first combined by ‘clustering’. Redundant sequences are identified using blastclust (part of the Blast package), using 95% identity and alignment length as search criteria. Thus, when evaluating the frequency of annotation terms, each cluster counts only once, regardless of the number of sequences it contains.In summary, Module 3 processes each query as follows (also see Fig. 1, M3): (i) the BLAST report is scanned for statistically significant alignments according to Rost's equation; (ii) identification and grouping of clusters containing very similar members of the same family; (iii) a preliminary annotation set is formed by combining individual non-redundant annotations from each cluster and finally, (iv) biological term enrichment is used to select significantly overrepresented annotations in each group of homologous sequences. Owing to the modular implementation of the algorithm, each module can be run independently, allowing the user to easily customize annotation criteria.3.2. Sma3s annotates random Swiss-Prot sequence collections with high accuracyWe trained Sma3s using random datasets extracted from the four Swiss-Prot taxonomic divisions. Five independent random sets of 1000 sequences (5000 in total) were extracted for each division. These sequences were then annotated using the corresponding division from Swiss-Prot, and each query sequence removed from the database at each step to avoid self-annotation.We evaluated the annotation of each random set of sequences for SC, specificity, sensitivity and REQ values (an accuracy measurement which combines both specificity and sensitivity, with 0 being the best possible value). The results obtained varied significantly between taxonomic divisions, but not between different datasets from the same division (Fig. 2). Sma3s annotation of random Swiss-Prot test datasets. The sequence coverage (SC), specificity (Sp), sensitivity (Sn) and REQ values obtained by Sma3s are shown for (a) bacteria, (b) plants, (c) mammals, (d) invertebrates, (e) and average values, with standard deviation for all four datasets. This figure appears in colour in the online version of DNA Research.Sma3s annotation of random Swiss-Prot test datasets. The sequence coverage (SC), specificity (Sp), sensitivity (Sn) and REQ values obtained by Sma3s are shown for (a) bacteria, (b) plants, (c) mammals, (d) invertebrates, (e) and average values, with standard deviation for all four datasets. This figure appears in colour in the online version of DNA Research.To identify the optimal default cut-off value, we tested Sma3s with different P-values using our random datasets as query sequences and the corresponding taxonomic divisions of the Swiss-Prot database as annotation sources. As can be seen in Fig. 2, more restrictive P-values generated consistent results with low REQ values and higher specificity (Sp) but at the cost of reduced sensitivity (Sn). The highest accuracy, as defined by the lowest REQ values, was obtained when specificity and sensitivity had equal or similar values. With the exception of the invertebrate dataset, a P-value of 0.1 resulted in average sensitivity and specificity values >0.8. These values compare favourably with those of other tools, such as Blast2GO9 or Gotcha,12 whose accuracy typically ranges between 0.65 and 0.7. On this basis, we established a default P-value of 0.1 for Sma3s.When the same test datasets were annotated using the uncurated TrEMBL database or the complete UniProt database instead of Swiss-Prot, the average accuracy was reduced despite the high coverage obtained (Table 1). This can be explained by the fact that the unreviewed TrEMBL sequence collection is much larger than the manually annotated Swiss-Prot set. Thus, a large proportion of annotations assigned from the UniProt database are derived from TrEMBL, even though UniProt also contains Swiss-Prot sequences.Accuracy was also calculated separately for each of the four annotation types recovered by Sma3s: GO terms, SW-Keywords, InterPro and Pathways (Fig. 3). Best results were obtained for Pathway and InterPro annotations, which had REQ values =0.2 for all except the invertebrate dataset. Keyword and GO annotations had poorer REQ values, but still achieved average sensitivity and specificity values of 0.8 (and as high as 0.97 for bacteria). The exception, again, was the invertebrate dataset for which Sma3s generated higher REQ values, associated with significantly lower sensitivity. The relatively poor results for the invertebrate dataset are probably due to the relatively small number of sequences present in the corresponding invertebrate database. Sequence length is also important. In fact, this dataset is the group with the highest proportion of very short sequences (10-40 amino acids), which are usually annotated with difficulty (Supplementary Fig. S1a). Sensitivity, specificity and REQ index for different annotation types. (a) Sensitivity, (b) specificity and (c) REQ index calculated from the results obtained by Sma3s with the random datasets from different taxonomic divisions are shown, separated by the different annotation types under study.

This figure appears in colour in the online version of DNA Research.3.3. The M3 module can enrich the annotation of previously analysed sequencesAs described above, each dataset sequence is annotated by one of the three different modules in the Sma3s algorithm, which sequentially run from M1 to M3. To determine the effectiveness of each module, we calculated the percentage of random dataset sequences annotated by each module. On average, the M1 module annotated 53.76% of sequences (Table 2) with M2 and M3 annotating the remainder (19.70 and 26.54%, respectively). As modules M2 and M3 only annotate query sequences that were not annotated by the previous module(s), the ~26% of sequences annotated by M3 suggests that it significantly increases Sma3s annotation coverage. Number of annotations assigned by each Sma3s moduleThe average number of annotations identified by Sma3s is shown for the random and DNA arrays datasets, together with the corresponding standard deviation. Note that the percentages for each dataset group sum 100%, since Sma3s has applied its three modules consecutively (default configuration).Number of annotations assigned by each Sma3s moduleThe average number of annotations identified by Sma3s is shown for the random and DNA arrays datasets, together with the corresponding standard deviation. Note that the percentages for each dataset group sum 100%, since Sma3s has applied its three modules consecutively (default configuration).M1 and M2 modules provide highly accurate results since annotations are obtained from verified orthologues with high degrees of identity between query and donor sequences. However, as both modules employ the traditional Top-BLAST approach, each query sequence is annotated from only one putative orthologue. In contrast, the M3 module typically extracts annotations from several homologous sequences identified in the BLAST report. To better compare the relative benefits of the different approaches used by Sma3s, we compared the annotation of our random datasets using the three modules as described above (M123) against annotation using Module 3 alone (M3). In the latter case, all sequences are annotated by Module 3, not just the sequences unannotated by Modules 1 and 2. Figure 4 shows that the mean specificity and sensitivity of the M3 module were slightly lower than the full Sma3s analysis, with the REQ value increasing from 0.19 to 0.32. However, M3 obtained more annotations (Fig. 4, column TC) due to its ability to extract annotations from multiple homologues. M3 accuracy was also compared with combined M1 and M2 modules (M12), which represent more conventional annotation algorithms. M12 obtained higher specificity (0.97) since it annotates only using very similar sequences (Fig. 4). However, sensitivity is rather less (0.47) with only 64% of dataset sequences annotated. This results in an REQ value of 0.71 for M12 versus the 0.32 for M3. Several examples illustrate this additional advantage of Sma3s M3 as a standalone annotation tool. Comparison of Sma3s performance using all modules (M123) or the M3 module alone. Corresponding sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp), sequence coverage (SC) and term coverage (TC) values appear above the bars.

This figure appears in colour in the online version of DNA Research.The best BLAST hit of the pig Qil1 protein (QIL1_PIG) in the mammalian dataset is the primate homologue (QIL1_MACFA). Because this protein entry does not contain any of the four annotation types used by Sma3s, pig Qil1 was not annotated by M1. However, the M3 module was able to annotate pig Qil1 localization using the GO term ‘Mitochondrion’, obtained from a more distant Qil1 mouse homologue (QIL1_MOUSE).The Sma3s M3 module could be used even in cases where incomplete annotations are present in Swiss-Prot. For example, when M1 or M2 Sma3s modules are used with invertebrate datasets, the U3-lycotoxin-Ls1a protein from the wolf spider (TX308_LYCSI) only generates the GO term ‘extracellular region’. In contrast, the M3 module annotates the sequence with two additional GO terms: ‘pathogenesis’ and ‘calcium channel inhibitor activity’. Since this protein belongs to the spider toxin CSTX superfamily, which blocks mammalian neuronal calcium channels,26 these terms should be present in the annotation of this protein.Another example is the SfsA protein (SFSA_PSEF5) from Pseudomonas fluorescens. SfsA was annotated in bacterial datasets with the Swiss-Prot keyword ‘Complete proteome’ and no GO terms. However, M3 predicted the following Keywords and GO terms: DNA binding and carbohydrate metabolic process. These terms seem valid because the bacterial SfsA family includes sugar fermentation stimulation proteins that contain a helix-turn-helix motif that probably binds DNA at its C-terminus.273.4. Accurate annotation of DNA array sequence setsTo test Sma3s with an experimental set of sequences, we chose collections belonging to two different Affymetrix DNA arrays (one mouse and one Arabidopsis). The real annotations for these datasets were extracted from the Affymetrix web server (March, 2012) as GO terms linked to the sequences, or as GO terms extracted from Swiss-Prot IDs linked to the sequences. Sma3s was used to annotate these arrays using default parameters, and accuracy measured using the reference annotations. We compared these results with the traditional Top-BLAST method, and the widely used Blast2GO tool with default annotation settings (Fig. 5). Annotation of two DNA arrays using Sma3s, Blast2GO and Top-BLAST. The annotation prediction results of mouse and Arabidopsis sequences are shown from Sma3s with all modules, Sma3s with the M3 module only, Blast2GO and Top-BLAST.

This figure appears in colour in the online version of DNA Research.Arabidopsis and mouse array analyses were performed with either the Swiss-Prot (Fig. 5a) or Affymetrix (Fig. 5b) annotations as references. In the case of Arabidopsis, Sma3s showed the best accuracy (as measured by REQ, sensitivity and specificity), although Top-BLAST provided a better sequence and TC. However, there were striking differences between the Swiss-Prot and Affymetrix annotation sources. We observed a much bigger difference in REQ values between Sma3s (M123 and M3 alone) and the other methods with Swiss-Prot annotations.In the case of the mouse dataset, Sma3s provided significantly better sensitivity albeit with slightly poorer specificity than Top-BLAST when using Swiss-Prot as an annotation source (Fig. 5c). A similar pattern occurred when using Affymetrix sources (Fig. 5d), but the differences were more marginal. In contrast to the Arabidopsis collection, Sma3s generated the highest TC values for mouse sequences with both annotation sources. Our results suggest that both the full and M3-only implementations of Sma3s analysis compare favourably with commonly used annotation tools, with equal or better REQ values in almost all cases. However, it is clear that the annotation results obtained were very sensitive to both the query dataset and the choice of annotation source.3.5. Sma3s is fast and has low-memory usageIn the post-genomic era, it is critical to have annotation tools that can be easily integrated into sequence analysis pipelines and applied quickly to large datasets. Therefore, it is important that annotation analyses run efficiently without excessive resource demands or sequence limitations. To this end, we estimated the speed of Sma3s analysis using the modest computer hardware (see Materials and Methods for details). We tested run times and memory usage using three datasets with progressively increasing sizes (Fig. 6). Measurements were taken separately for the BLAST search and sequence annotation steps. Sma3s processing times increased in proportion to the number of sequences analysed (Fig. 6a). Times were highly dependent on the initial BLAST step which increased in proportion to the sequence number. However, Sma3s annotation times were much lower and barely affected by increasing dataset sizes. Significantly, Sma3s run times were two orders of magnitude shorter than those of the Blast2GO method.

Sma3s had an essentially constant memory usage in its two steps despite the sequence number increase, in contrast to the Blast2Go method. Our results show that Sma3s is able to efficiently annotate large sequence datasets using modest computational resources.4. DiscussionSequencing projects produce hundreds of thousands of new biological sequences that need to be quickly and accurately annotated since this information constitutes the basis for subsequent analysis, such as pathway design or genomics and transcriptomics studies. Therefore, fast and user friendly methods are needed to support sequence annotation at this stage.Sma3s uses three consecutive modules: M1 (which searches for very similar sequences in the database), M2 (which searches for orthologues) and M3 (which extracts information from several homologous sequences). The novel approach used by the M3 module selects several homologues for each query sequence, using a modified Rost equation, which takes into account both alignment length and percentage identity. Annotations from all the non-redundant sequences are pooled, but only annotations that are significantly enriched versus the expected background frequency are assigned to the query sequence. This has the advantage that useful annotation information present in several homologues can be extracted, rather than only from the sequence with the highest homology.Our tests have shown that Sma3s is a fast annotation method requiring minimal human supervision and computational resources. Mean Sma3s accuracy using different annotation types (GO, Swiss-Prot keywords and pathways, and InterPro) was higher than 0.8 (except for the invertebrate dataset), and was even higher (0.9) for specific datasets such as bacteria. In addition, REQ values were consistently very low. InterPro annotation was highly specific and sensitive (see Fig. 3), which can be explained by the fact that current InterPro annotation is strongly focused on sequence similarity, which has been shown to be effective for protein function prediction 26. On the other hand, it is difficult to judge Sma3s Swiss-Prot Pathway annotation given the limited coverage of this category in the UniProt database. Importantly, both InterPro and Pathway use short and controlled vocabularies with low term diversification.Some annotation methods can assign sentences derived from the database description line 15. Sma3s can also assign this descriptor (data not shown). However, the accuracy of these non-standard annotations is difficult to measure, whereas controlled terms such as GO or Keywords are more useful for experiments using massive datasets. Sma3s can be easily adapted to use different annotation classes, and each term predicted by Sma3s can be assigned a corresponding probability value. For example, Sma3s also includes annotations for the most probable gene names for each annotated sequence (data not shown), which can be useful for non-specialized users who only want to rapidly identify their sequences. Furthermore, Sma3s could be used with other annotation sources since the annotation assignment step can easily be disengaged from the main algorithm and used with other databases. For example, the annotation component could be extended to use data from the BioMart project, which links annotations from heterogeneous databases to UniProt identifiers. If Sma3s was converted to a web service,28 it could be directed to use BioMart public web services as an annotation source. This would also make Sma3s more versatile by dividing Blast and annotation steps into separate services.4.1. The reference dataset and the BLAST results influence annotation accuracyWe demonstrated the accuracy of Sma3s with tests using different random datasets (Fig. 2). Moreover, Sma3s outperformed other widely used annotation methods when annotating DNA array datasets (Fig. 5). The only exception was the mouse dataset using Swiss-Prot as a reference. The annotation accuracy of this dataset is strongly dependent on reference annotations, which in this case came from Affymetrix. These annotations are assigned using NetAffx, which is based on homology transfer from heterogeneous databases, including Swiss-Prot, but also Unigene and LocusLink 27. Furthermore, these annotations depend on the external database entries associated with individual Affymetrix sequences, which have been shown to contain frequent inaccuracies 28. Thus, selection of a suitably high-quality reference annotation set seems to be an important factor for testing this or any other method. Nevertheless, Sma3s produced the best results in virtually all cases.Further evidence for the idea that database annotation influences annotation accuracy is presented in Table 1, where the well-annotated Swiss-Prot division of UniProt provided the best accuracy (including specificity and sensitivity), while TrEMBL provided the lowest values. UniProt is the most widely used protein database since it contains rich information on each sequence. UniProt is comprised of Swiss-Prot, a curated section reviewed by skilled annotators and TrEMBL, an unreviewed section containing additional sequences that can be moved to Swiss-Prot once they have been manually reviewed. We have found that the best annotation accuracy is obtained when Swiss-Prot is used as the sole reference database (Table 1). Conversely, accuracy was reduced when using either TrEMBL or the complete UniProt database, mainly due to lower sensitivity. These lower values are expected partly because the test datasets were extracted from Swiss-Prot, and partly because TrEMBL is a much larger database. Thus, when UniProt or TrEMBL are used as reference sources, a higher proportion of Sma3s annotations are TrEMBL-derived, which consequently lowers the average annotation accuracy.Similarly, it is important to highlight that results were also dependent on the quality of annotated reference sequences for each taxonomic group. For example, Sma3s annotation of random invertebrate sequences was of a much lower quality than those of bacterial sequences. The main difference between the two Uniprot datasets is in the number of sequences they contain: 24 050 invertebrate sequences versus 326 570 bacterial sequences. In order for Module 3 to assign an annotation, it has to be statistically enriched within the homologous sequences. The probability of finding enriched annotations is more likely with the higher numbers of candidate sequences available in the bacterial dataset. In fact, we have found that a combination of TrEMBL and SWISS-PROT databases increases sensitivity when annotating weakly conserved genomes (unpublished observation). However, this approach results in a higher rate of false positives.Sequence length may be an important factor for successful annotation. For example, short sequences occur most frequently in invertebrates and to a lesser extent in plants (Supplementary Fig. S1a). These sequences are rarely annotated due to the low alignment scores they produce. The M1 module, which requires very high levels of similarity, is typically the most effective Sma3s component for annotation of these sequences (Supplementary Fig. S1b). This effect is likely to be enhanced by the higher diversity of the invertebrate dataset versus the bacterial one.Another key factor for successful annotation is the initial BLAST search. In order for a sequence to be annotated by any of the three Sma3s modules, the initial BLAST must identify sequence alignments. For example, of the 30% of mouse array sequences which were not annotated by Sma3s (SC = 0.7 in Fig. 5), 86% lacked BLAST results, making annotation impossible. In the case of Arabidopsis array sequences, 40% lacked BLAST results thus limiting annotation coverage to a maximum of 60%. This dependency on BLAST results is shared with most annotation methods, including AutoFact 11, Blast2GO 9 and GOtcha 12. In the case of Sma3s, the effect of the BLAST search is especially important given that Sma3s was able to annotate 90% of array sequences with BLAST alignments, largely due to the novel M3 module (Table 2).4.2. The combined use of the three Sma3s modules generates accurate annotation, with enhanced coverage from the M3 moduleWe have shown that Sma3s can annotate different dataset types using its three module structure. Modules M1 and M2 are able to identify closely related database sequences and extract specific annotations, albeit with low overall coverage (TC in Figs 4 and 5). Thus, modules M1 and M2 provide high-quality annotations (with lower REQ values), increasing the overall sensitivity and specificity of Sma3s (Sn and Sp in Fig. 4).Our findings suggest that the M3 module can increase SC in some cases, especially where close orthologues lack database annotation. The initial BLAST result can be reused by the M3 module to obtain new annotations for sequences previously annotated by M1 or M2. M3 annotation is broader, allowing new terms to be found (Fig. 4) but with lower specificity, thus increasing the chance of generating false positives. For most applications, using the three Sma3s modules sequentially balance the higher accuracy of Modules 1 and 2 with the identification of useful annotations from Module 3 for otherwise unannotated sequences.Our results demonstrate that the Sma3s M3 module is able to generate new annotations for sequences that were unannotated in their original databases. Thus, the M3 module may be valuable as a database curation tool, adding new annotations to existing public databases. However, it is important to take into account that this module is likely to generate annotations with lower specificity (Sp in Figs 4 and 5). Ideally, users would be able to choose between high sensitivity and high specificity according to the goal of the experiment.4.3. Sma3s has low computing requirementsThe Sma3s algorithm comprises two different basic steps: similarity searching by BLAST and annotation by different strategies in each of the three modules. For high-throughput analyses, the BLAST itself accounts for most of the calculation time. Result execution times (Fig. 6) demonstrate that parallel BLAST searches could accelerate the process without affecting the rest of the algorithm. In fact, both Sma3s and Blast2GO can use separately generated BLAST reports, which may allow accelerated analysis if the user was to execute similarity searches in parallel. However, the speed advantage of Sma3s over Blast2GO is due to more than the speed of the BLAST search. Another reason for the speed of Sma3s is that it uses Swiss-Prot, a relatively small high-quality database, which itself increases annotation accuracy (Figs 2, 3 and 5). These results together allow for a faster and more accurate annotation process when analysing large datasets. Thus, Sma3s can annotate a set of 20 000 sequences in ~3 h, without human intervention. Finally, memory usage is low (Fig. 6b), alleviating the need for high performance computing facilities.In conclusion, Sma3s is a fast and accurate method for annotating massive nucleotide or amino acid datasets in a way that is readily accessible for non-expert users. In fact, Sma3s has already been used in the functional annotation of both the olive29 and the maritime pine30 transcriptomes, and is now being used for the annotation of both a new bacterial genome and an EST database of almost 300 plant datasets containing a total of 8.6 million sequences (data not published yet).Authors' contributionsA.M.M. significantly helped in the design computational implementation, and testing of Sma3s algorithm.

IntroductionRapeseed (Brassica napus L.; AACC, 2n = 38) is the one of the most important oil crops worldwide. Brassica napus is a recent allopolyploid species derived from natural interspecies hybridization between two phylogenetically close species, B. rapa (AA, 2n = 20) and B. oleracea (CC, 2n = 18) <10 000 years ago.1,2 Rapeseed has a short domestication history of only ~400–500 years.3–5 During the breeding history of rapeseed, the most outstanding event is the introduction of two traits, zero seed erucic acid and low seed glucosinolate content (so called double-low, canola quality 00). However, many traits such as oil content, seed yield, disease resistance, etc. urgently need to be further improved in the modern cultivars. Molecular design breeding is currently one of the most available breeding methods. Screening-specific materials with some desired traits in a comparatively genetically diverse source of germplasm including old genotypes with high levels of erucic acid and seed glucosinolates and discovering the advantageous allelic variants by genetic analysis may advance molecular design breeding.Genetic mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTL) in rapeseed is well established and has been employed to localize QTLs for quantitative traits, such as oil content,6 glucosinolate content,7 fatty acid composition of the seed oil,8 flowering time,9 yield components,10–13 etc. In all these studies, although QTL mapping is very successful in detecting QTL, the genetic variation in the mapping population is restricted to only the two parents, and the markers for detected QTL are not necessarily transferable to other materials. Furthermore, the ability of fine mapping a QTL in these studies is limited by the frequency of polymorphic loci between the two parents and requires a population consisting of several thousands of individuals, making it laborious and time-consuming to perform. There is, so far, no report on map-based cloning of a causal gene in a QTL of rapeseed.Association mapping, also called linkage disequilibrium (LD) mapping, which directly studies statistical associations between genetic markers and phenotypes in natural populations, is an alternative to QTL mapping.14 An association mapping study utilizes the higher number of historical recombination events that have occurred throughout the entire evolutionary history of the mapping population, allowing <U+FB01>ne-scale QTL mapping.14,15 With the rapid developments in genomics and dramatically decreasing cost of genotyping technology, association mapping has rapidly became a promising approach for the genetic dissection of complex traits. For a species with available genome sequences such as Arabidopsis thaliana, rice, maize, etc., genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have contributed to revealing rich genetic architectures of complex traits.16–21Since rapeseed contains two homologous but divergent subgenomes A and C, which were shaped by whole-genome triplication followed by extensive diploidization,22,23 its genome structure is complex, which has hindered genomic research and high throughput discovery of high-quality molecular markers. The population structure, LD and association mapping in rapeseed were studied using amplified fragment length polymorphism and simple sequence repeat markers.24–29 However, due to the limited number of DNA markers and low-efficient genotyping technologies, a small number of lines or markers were used in these studies. Recent advances in sequencing and computational technology have enabled the discovery and efficient assay of large numbers of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in rapeseed.30,31 Delourme et al.32 analysed the genetic diversity and LD of a rapeseed collection of 313 inbred lines from different geographical origins using >4300 SNPs that were localized on an integrated map of rapeseed. The genomic research of Brassica genera has developed rapidly in recent years. The Brassica A genome sequence from B. rapa has been published,33 and Brassica C genome sequencing from B. oleracea has also been completed and will be published soon (http://www.ocri-genomics.org/bolbase/). Owing to the complicated genome of B. napus, genome sequencing has not yet been completed. Based on a high-density (~21 K) SNP linkage map of rapeseed,31 Harper et al.34 refined the order and orientation of the A and C genome sequence scaffolds, constructed pseudomolecules representative of the 19 chromosomes of B. napus and successfully carried out associative transcriptomics of glucosinolate and erucic acid content in a population of 53 B. napus lines.In this study, we genotyped a panel of 472 rapeseed accessions from all over the world using a 60K Brassica Infinium® SNP array recently developed by the international Brassica Illumina SNP consortium. By in silico mapping of the SNPs of the array to ‘pseudomolecules’ representative of the B. napus genome to obtain their hypothetical position, we performed a GWAS of seed weight and seed quality in B. napus. The SNPs significantly associated with traits were identified, and the candidate genes were confirmed or predicted.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materialsA set of 472 rapeseed inbred lines collected from the National Mid-term Gene Bank for Oil Crops of China were used for association analysis. According to the information from the gene bank and our own observations, the accessions were assigned to five different germplasm types, i.e. winter oilseed rape (OSR) (160), semi-winter OSR (200), spring OSR (110), spring fodder (1) and winter fodder (1). Based on their origins, 266 accessions originated from Asia, 128 from Western Europe, 20 from Oceania, 26 from North America and 32 from Eastern Europe (Supplementary Table S1). For SNP array quality control, 12 doubled haploid (DH) lines (Supplementary Table S2), a resynthesized B. napus SBn8, a cultivar Zhongshuang9 and their F1 hybrid named F1ZSSB were employed.2.2. Experiment design and traits measurementOne representative plant of each accession of the association population was self-pollinated in the 2010/2011 winter–spring growing season, and the leaves of each plant were sampled to extract genomic DNA. The self-pollinated seeds of each accession were grown in the experimental farm at Wuhan (114.31°E, 30.52°N), China, in the 2011/2012 growing season. Each accession was grown in a plot with three rows and 10–12 plants in each row, with a distance of 0.2 m between plants within each row and 0.3 m between rows. Before flowering time, each plot was separated by nylon net with a 0.35-mm square hole to propagate seeds. Fatty acid analysis was performed by using gas liquid chromatography (GC) with a Model 6890N GC analyzer (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA), following the protocol as described.35 The erucic acid content was expressed as its percentage of total fatty acids in mature seeds.The 472 accessions of the association population were grown using a randomized complete block design with three replications in the experimental farm at Wuhan, and Nanchang (116.27°E, 28.37°N), China, in the 2012/2013 growing season. Each accession was grown in a plot with five rows with the same plant density abovementioned. The weight of randomly selected 1000 well-<U+FB01>lled, open-pollinated seeds of each plot was measured to represent seed weight for one replicate of each accession. Seed oil content and total glucosinolate content were estimated by near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS). Approximately 3 g seeds per accession were measured using a Foss NIRS Systems 5000 instrument on a reflectance scanning mode.As the traits of the association panel were investigated in multi-environments with three replications, an R script (www.eXtension.org/pages/61006) based on a linear model described by Merk et al.36 was used to obtain the best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) of each trait of each line. The resulting values were used as phenotypes for the association analysis.2.3. SNP genotyping and filteringSNP genotyping was performed using the Brassica 60K Illumina® Infinium SNP array by Emei Tongde Co. (Beijing) according to the manufacture's protocol (http://www.illumina.com/technology/infinium_hd_assay.ilmn). The SNP data were clustered and called automatically using the Illumina BeadStudio genotyping software. Those SNPs with AA or BB frequency equal to zero, call frequency <0.8 or minor frequency <0.05 were excluded. The remaining SNPs were scrutinized visually and those SNPs that did not show three clearly defined clusters representing the three possible genotypes (AA, AB and BB) were also excluded.2.4. In silico mapping of SNPsThe source sequences for designing SNP probes of the SNP array were used to perform a BLAST37 search against version 4 of the ‘pseudomolecules’ representative of the genome of B. napus (Supplementary Table S3). Only the top BLAST hits against the pseudomolecules were considered. BLAST matches to multiple loci, with the same top identity, were not considered to be mapped.2.5. Genetic diversity, population structure and linkage disequilibrium analysisPolymorphism information content (PIC) of the SNPs were estimated using the PowerMarker version 3.51.38 The differences of PIC between linkage groups were assessed using one-way analysis of variance implemented in SPSS 9.0. All the SNPs were used to estimate the genetic relatedness between individuals by principal component analysis (PCA) using the GCTA tool.39 A total of 3900 SNPs [minor allele frequency (MAF) = 0.2] evenly distributed across the whole genome were selected to perform the following population structure and relative kinship analysis. The software package STRUCTURE v2.3.440 was used to infer population structure. Five independent runs were performed with a K-value (the putative number of genetic groups) varying from 1 to 10, with the length of burnin period and the number of MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) replications after burnin both to 100 000 under the ‘admixture model’. The most likely k-value was determined by the log probability of data [LnP(D)] and an ad hoc statistic <U+0394>k based on the rate of change of LnP(D) between successive k as described by Evanno et al.41 The cluster membership coefficient matrices of replicate runs from STRUCTURE were integrated to get a Q matrix by the CLUMPP software42 and graphically displayed using the DISTRUCT software package.43 Accessions with the probability of membership >0.7 were assigned to corresponding clusters, and those <0.7 were assigned to a mixed group. Nei's genetic distance44 was estimated and used for constructing an unrooted neighbour-joining tree by the PowerMarker software, and the tree was visualized using FigTree (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/). The relative kinship matrix comparing all pairs of the 472 accessions was calculated using the software package SPAGeDi.45 Negative values between two individuals were set to 0, as described by Yu et al.46 LD was estimated as the squared allele frequency correlations (r2) between all pairs of the SNPs, using the software TASSEL3.0.472.6 Genome-wide association analysisTrait–SNP association analysis was performed using six models to evaluate the effects of population structure (Q, PC) and kinship (K): (i) naive—without controlling for Q and K, (ii) Q model, controlling for Q, (iii) PCA model, controlling for PC, the top 10 principal components were used as fixed effects, (iv) K model, controlling for K, (v) Q + K model, controlling for both Q and K and (vi) P + K model, controlling for both PC and K. The naive, Q and PCA models were performed using a general linear model; the K, Q + K and P + K models were performed using a mixed linear model with optimum compression and population parameters previously determined (P3D) variance component estimation in TASSEL 3.0.46,48 The distribution of observed -log10(p) for each SNP from marker–trait associations was compared with the expected distribution in a quantile–quantile plot. Signi<U+FB01>cance of associations between SNPs and traits was based on threshold p < 2 × 10-6 (i.e. -log10(p) = 5.7), a stringent Bonferroni correction calculated by dividing 0.05 by the total number of SNPs in the analysis, 24 256. The signi<U+FB01>cant association of more than one SNP was regarded as a true association. Furthermore, false discovery rates (FDRs) were calculated as [(m× P)/n] × 100%,49,50 where m is the total number of SNPs (i.e. 24 256), P is the p-value threshold for detecting significant association (i.e. 2 × 10-6) and n is the total number of signi<U+FB01>cant associations per trait.3. Results3.1. Phenotypic variations of measured quantitative traitsGlucosinolate content, oil content and seed weight of the B. napus association panel comprising 472 accessions were measured for three replications in two locations. As the key genes responsible for the natural variation of the erucic acid content are known, this trait was investigated for only one replication in one location and used for evaluating the ability and accuracy of the GWAS of this panel. Extensive phenotypic variations were observed as shown in the descriptive statistics in Table 1. The erucic acid content, which varied from 0 to 53.7 with an average of 22.7, had the maximum coefficient of variation of 73.4%, whereas oil content in Nanchan, which varied from 33.4 to 52.6 with an average of 43.6, had the lowest coefficient of variation of 5.4%. Seed weight and glucosinolate content were quite consistent across different geographic location replicates with the correlation coefficient of 0.876 and 0.914, respectively, and oil content has the correlation coefficient of ~0.775 (Supplementary Fig. S1). Phenotypic variations for seed weight and seed quality in this B. napus panelaSD is an abbreviation of standard deviation, which was calculated based on the measured values of seeds from three replicated experimental blocks.bCV is an abbreviation of coefficient of variation, which was estimated as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean of all accessions.Phenotypic variations for seed weight and seed quality in this B. napus panelaSD is an abbreviation of standard deviation, which was calculated based on the measured values of seeds from three replicated experimental blocks.bCV is an abbreviation of coefficient of variation, which was estimated as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean of all accessions.3.2. SNP performance and qualityCalling SNP genotype data using the BeadStudio genotyping software generally produced three clear clusters, i.e. the AA homozygote, BB homozygote and AB heterozygote. Of the 52 157 SNPs in the array, 10 389 which had zero call frequency of AA or BB were excluded. Then, with a cut-off of missing data >0.2 and MAF <0.05, 1866 and 1428 SNPs were filtered, respectively, reducing the number of SNPs to 38 474. Those that remained were scrutinized visually and 29 027 SNPs with three clearly defined clusters were selected. Theoretically, the DH lines are homozygous throughout their genome, while the 12 DH lines derived from geographically different inbred lines of B. napus showed a heterozygosity rate of 1.8~2.8%, which might be caused by miss-calling or homologous sequences and should be excluded. As a result, 2186 SNPs with the heterozygous genotype in any DH lines were filtered and 26 841 SNPs were finally selected.To further control SNP quality, a parent/F1 triplet and four DNA duplicates were used to analyse the pedigree consistency and technical reproducibility, respectively. As a result, the allele calls were highly reproducible (Supplementary Table S4) with no or negligible inconsistencies between technical replicates. Furthermore, the parent/F1 triplet showed a pedigree inconsistency of <1%, confirming the high quality of the genotype calling of the selected SNPs in the array.3.3. SNP in silico mapping and diversityBy BLAST analysis of the resource sequences of the SNPs in the array against ‘pseudomolecules’ representative of the genome of B. napus, 47 805 of 52 157 SNPs were in silico mapped (Supplementary Table S3). Among the selected 26 841 SNPs with fine performance, 24 256 were mapped (Supplementary Table S5 and Fig. S2). Linkage group A2 had the least markers of 506 with a marker density of one per 52.9 kb, and C4 had the most markers of 2104 with a marker density of one per 25.0 kb. The SNP diversity in the whole collection was expressed by a PIC value, and the results were shown in Supplementary Table S5 and summarized in Table 2. Except for linkage groups C5, C7 and C8, 75% of SNPs in each linkage group had PIC values over 0.25. The levels of polymorphism of linkage groups in the A subgenome (with the exception of A2, A4 and A5) were generally higher than those in the C subgenome. The mean PIC values of A8 and A9 were highest, nearly 0.32, whereas that of C7 was lowest, only 0.254. Summary of the PIC values in different linkage groups of the B. napusaPIC is an abbreviation of polymorphism information content.bValues followed by different letters in this column are significantly different at the level of 0.05.Summary of the PIC values in different linkage groups of the B. napusaPIC is an abbreviation of polymorphism information content.bValues followed by different letters in this column are significantly different at the level of 0.05.3.4. Population structure, relative kinship and linkage disequilibriumThe population structure of the association panel was calculated using 3900 SNPs by STRUCTURE, and clustering inference performed with possible clusters (k) from 1 to 10 showed that the most signi<U+FB01>cant change of likelihood occurred when K increased from 3 to 4, and the highest <U+0394>k value was observed at k = 3 (Fig. 1). Both parameters suggested that the 472 genotypes could be assigned into three groups. Using a probability of membership threshold of 70%, 164, 29 and 17 lines were assigned into the three groups, respectively. The remaining 262 lines were classi<U+FB01>ed into a mixed group (Supplementary Table S1). Most of the lines in Group 1 were from Asia and belong to semi-winter OSR (Supplementary Table S6). European lines were the main component of the Groups 2 and 3, in which the larger part were winter OSR and spring OSR, respectively. The NJ phylogenetic tree based on Nei's genetic distances displayed three clear clades (Supplementary Fig. S3), corresponding to the three groups estimated by STRUCTURE. The lines belong to mixed groups distributed across the whole tree. The PCA based on the 24 256 genome-wide SNPs showed that the <U+FB01>rst two principal components explained 11.7 and 5.8% of the genetic variance, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S4). The three major groups identified using STRUCTURE (i.e. except for the mixed group), winter OSR, spring OSR and semi-winter OSR were assigned to three major clusters. The analysis of relative kinship showed that the average relative kinship between any two lines was 0.0856. A total of 51.4% of kinship coef<U+FB01>cients between lines were equal to 0, and 32.6% kinship coef<U+FB01>cients ranged from 0 to 0.2 (Supplementary Fig. S5). This pattern of genetic relatedness revealed that most lines have no or weak kinship in this OSR panel. To assess the extent of LD, we calculated the mean pairwise r2 for all SNPs as 0.0176.

Association mappingWe assessed the utility of six statistical models for controlling type I and II errors in this B. napus panel. As can be seen in the QQ plots (Fig. 2), the distribution of observed -log10(p) values from the naive model departed quite far from the expected distribution leading to a high level of false-positive signals. For all four traits, any model controlling population structure or relative kinship performed signi<U+FB01>cantly better than the naive model. The models controlling relative kinship, i.e. K, Q + K and P + K, had similar effects in reducing the false positives, while P + K showed slightly greater effect than K and Q + K models. For erucic acid content and glucosinolate content, the PCA, K, Q + K and P + K models were better than the Q model. All of the models except the naive model performed well for oil content and seed weight, and no significant difference was observed among these five models for the seed weight. There were no significant associations between SNPs and oil content in the Q, P + K models based on threshold -log10(p) = 5.7, which might indicate false negatives in this analysis. Quantile–quantile plots of estimated -log10(p) from association analysis using six methods for four traits: (a) Erucic acid content; (b) glucosinolate content; (c) oil content and (d) seed weight. The black line is the expected line under the null distribution, and the deviations from expectation indicate that the statistical analysis may cause spurious associations. The horizontal dashed green lines indicates genome-wide significance threshold -log10(p) = 5.7.Quantile–quantile plots of estimated -log10(p) from association analysis using six methods for four traits: (a) Erucic acid content; (b) glucosinolate content; (c) oil content and (d) seed weight.

The horizontal dashed green lines indicates genome-wide significance threshold -log10(p) = 5.7.According to the Q-Q plots of the six models, we used PCA and Q + K models to identify association signals. First, in order to evaluate the power of association analysis in this panel, the erucic acid content, for which genetic control was well known, was first used to perform association analysis. Two significant regions located at 9.5 and 63.7 Mb of A8 and C3, respectively, in the ‘pseudomolecules’ of B. napus were detected by both models (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Fig. S6a and Table 3). The FDRs for associations detected in Q + K and PCA models were 0.046 and 0.312%, respectively. The two GWAS peaks, at Bn-A08-p12599446 and Bn-scaff_15794_3-p29807, contributed to 12.2 and 7.9% of phenotypic variance, respectively, based on R2 values. These two peak SNPs were found to be 233 and 128 kb away from the key genes BnaA.FAE1 and BnaC.FAE1, respectively, indicating that our association genetics approach was successful.

Each dot represents a SNP. The horizontal dashed green line represents the Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold -log10(p) = 5.7.Four and five significant associations for glucosinolate content were detected by Q + K and PCA models, respectively, with the FDR of 0.083 and 0.106%. Both models detected four common regions at 3.2, 50.0, 39.9 and 2.8 Mb of A9, C2, C7 and C9, respectively, in the ‘pseudomolecules’ of B. napus (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Fig. S6b and Table 3). The cumulative phenotypic variance explained by all signi<U+FB01>cant SNPs was 56.7%. As the deletions of the A. thaliana orthologous gene HAG1 (At5g61420) in C2 and A9 were regarded to lead to low glucosinolate content,34 we searched the HAG1 paralogues in the ‘pseudomolecules’ of B. napus and found four paralogues at 3.4 Mb of A9, 49.6 Mb of C2, 40.7 Mb of C7 and 4.7 Mb of C9, which were very similar to the four GWAS peaks. The candidate gene BnaC.HAG1c was 1.9 Mb away from the peak SNP Bn-scaff_17526_1-p1140588, which might be due to the low density of SNPs around the candidate gene. In addition, the PCA model also detected a novel locus at 6.33 Mb of C4, which contributed 5.0% of the phenotypic variation (Supplementary Fig. S6b and Table 3). For oil content, only one significantly associated region in A8 was detected by Q + K and PCA models with FDRs of 2.5 and 0.714%, respectively (Fig. 3c, Supplementary Fig. S6c and Table S3). The GWAS peaks explained 6.1% of the total phenotypic variance. The GWAS peak for oil content was similar to that for erucic acid. For seed weight, Q + K and PCA models detected one association in A9 and A7 with the FDR of 1.667 and 0.384%, respectively. The GWAS peak detected by Q + K, i.e. Bn-A09-p30654305, at 34.65 Mb of A9, explained 11.4% of the phenotypic variance (Fig. 3d, Supplementary Fig. S6d and Table 3). The SNP Bn-A09-p30654305 was also detected by the PCA model as a single associated SNP in A9. In addition, using the PCA model, we also detected an associated SNP Bn-A10-p12639538 at 2.67 Mb of A7 (Supplementary Fig. S5d and Table 3), which explained 4.9% of the total seed weight variation.4. DiscussionHigh-quality molecular markers and reliable genotype data are the precondition of genetic diversity analysis and association mapping. The amphidiploid nature of the B. napus genome might make automated SNP detection challenging and confounding, with homologue, paralogue and also homoeologue variation.30,51 Trick et al.30 termed three types of SNPs, i.e. inter-homoeologue polymorphisms, hemi-SNPs and simple SNPs in B. napus. The inter-homoeologue polymorphisms do not represent allelic variation per se, and as hemi-SNPs are the allelic polymorphisms in the homoeologous sequences, the short flanking sequences of the hemi-SNPs could not be specifically mapped in the ‘pseudomolecules’ representative of the genome of B. napus. By scanning the rapeseed association panel using the 60K SNP array, the clustering results showed that ~10 000 SNPs had zero call frequency of AA or BB, which could, in part, be caused by inter-homoeologue polymorphisms. Meanwhile, ~10 000 SNPs showed more than three clusters, which are indicative of two loci in a duplicated sequence as suggested by Ganal et al.,52 and are possibly hemi-SNPs. By strictly filtering, the genotypes of the finally selected SNPs of all DH lines were completely homozygous, and the DNA pedigree consistency and technical reproducibility were nearly perfect, suggesting the high quality of these selected SNPs.On the whole, over 76% of the SNPs have the PIC of 0.25–0.5, which was regarded as the PIC range of medium polymorphism of the DNA marker.53 On average, the polymorphism level was slightly higher for the A than for the C linkage groups in our population, contrary to the results of Delourme et al.32 In our panel, nearly half of the genotypes were Asiatic, while those of Delourme et al. were European.32 Asiatic cultivars were selected for improved adaptation to the local environment by introgression of B. rapa into B. napus germplasm,54,55 increasing the genetic diversity of the A genome. Our <U+FB01>nding suggests that genetic diversity of B. napus germplasm should be broadened by introgression of B. oleracea, as described by previous studies.24,56Understanding the population structure of the association mapping population contributes to reducing both Type I and II errors between molecular markers and traits of interest.46,57 In our study, the association population was classified into three groups, semi-winter, winter and spring OSR were the main components of these three groups. Distinct clustering of winter and spring types has been reported by previous studies.24,32,58,59 In our study, although Groups 2 and 3 mainly distinguished winter and spring types, respectively, some winter and spring types were found in the mixed group, located at an intermediate position between Groups 2 and 3. Delourme et al.32 also observed that some spring OSR lines did not show distinct clustering. These intermediate lines might be derived from hybrids of the lines from different gene pools.60,61 The kinship analysis revealed that most lines in the panel have no or weak kinship, together with significant differences in phenotype performance, indicating that this panel is suitable for association analysis. The mean pairwise r2 values is close to previous estimates of 0.011726 or 0.024734 and lower than 0.037 estimated for the population used by Delourme et al.,32 confirming the low overall level of LD in B. napus. At the genome level, mean LD decay was estimated to be 0.5–1.2 cM in rapeseed germplasm.24,26,32 Given the length of the genetic map of 2500 cM, >2100–5000 evenly spaced markers would be necessary to perform GWASs in rapeseed. Therefore, by selecting in excess of 20 000 SNPs, our study should have more than sufficient markers to perform a good association analysis.In the previous association analysis study in rapeseed, generally only population structure estimated by STRUCTURE40 was considered.27–29,62 However, spurious associations cannot be controlled completely by population structure since the Q matrix only gives a rough dissection of population differentiation. Furthermore, the programme STRUCTURE needs intensive computational cost on large data sets. The current PCA software such as EIGENSTRAT63 and GCTA39 could analyse tens of thousands of samples with millions of SNPs with high performance and infer continuous axes of genetic variation; therefore, the PCA based on genome-wide SNPs was broadly used to detect and correct for population strati<U+FB01>cation in GWAS;18,19 however, a few residual false-positive associations still existed in the PCA model.64 Yu et al.46 suggested that integration of the pairwise kinship into a mixed model to correct for relatedness could reduce spurious association, which was subsequently supported by the study in maize,48 sorghum65 and barley.66 In our study, six models, i.e. naive, Q, PCA, K, Q + K and P + K models, were first compared for controlling the false positives in B. napus association mapping. The models considering population structure or relatedness, especially PCA, K, Q + K and P + K models, could effectively eliminate the excess of low p-values for all traits; however, the P + K model also likely eliminated true positives, which is a common problem seen in other systems as well.16,67 Therefore, in order to reduce the false positives and false negatives, both Q + K and PCA models were considered to identify association signals.The position of the DNA markers relative to the genome sequence or linkage map is also preferable for successful association mapping. In this study, the SNPs of the array were in silico mapped in B. napus ‘pseudomolecules’ to establish their hypothetical order. The positions of the significant association signals detected in this study are consistent with previous studies. It has been shown that two homoeologues, namely BnaA.FAE1 and BnaC.FAE1 on linkage groups A8 and C3, respectively, are responsible for controlling erucic acid content.68,69 In the present study, the peaks of the two association signals for erucic acid content (represented by the markers Bn-A08-p12599446 and Bn-scaff_15794_3-p29807, which have the highest significance of association on A8 and C3, respectively) were within 233 kb of these two genes, indicating that our association approach was successful.For glucosinolate content, we identified four association signals on A9, C2, C7 and C9, which were detected independently in different studies.7,70,71 Howell et al.70 regarded that the QTLs on A9, C2 and C9 were homoeologous loci, whereas the underlying control genes were not uncovered until Harper et al.34 identified genomic deletions that underlie the QTLs on A9 and C2. In the low-glucosinolate rapeseed accessions, the deleted segments contained orthologs of the transcription factor HAG1 (At5g61420),34 which controls aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis in A. thaliana.72 In Brassica juncea, silencing of the orthologs of HAG1 was reported to cause low glucosinolate content.73 Interestingly, in the present study, four peak SNPs associated with glucosinolate content were identified to be close to the paralogues of HAG1. Further studies are necessary to reveal the DNA variation of the other two paralogues of HAG1 on C7 and C9.Control of seed oil content is complex and previous studies have detected at least 10 QTLs, which were environmentally sensitive and with minor effects.74–76 These studies commonly regarded that two QTLs on A8 and C3 overlapped with the QTLs for erucic acid content. Since the BnaA.FAE1 and BnaC.FAE1 were cloned and confirmed as the key factors controlling the synthesis of erucic acid in rapeseed,68,69 it was regarded that the pleiotropy of FAE1 was responsible for the decrease in seed oil content along with the reduction of seed erucic acid content in the modern cultivars. Our study showed that the peak SNP on A8 was only 233 kb away from the BnaA.FAE1, indicating the role of fine mapping of GWAS.Seed weight of rapeseed is also a complex trait, which has a relatively high heritability and may primarily be controlled by genes with additive effects.10,11 So far, >80 QTLs across the 19 linkage groups have been identi<U+FB01>ed and individual QTL contributed to 2.0–28.2% of the phenotypic variation.10–12,77–80 The seed weight QTLs on A7 were repeatedly detected in many studies with diverse genetic materials,10–12,78,80 and the QTL on A9 was identified as a major QTL with the most contribution of 28.2% for the total seed weight variation.12 Interestingly, our association mapping also detected a major QTL on A9 and a minor QTL on A7, indicating our association panel might be suitable for dissecting complex traits in B. napus. Since associated markers and causal polymorphisms underlying traits of interest are in a narrow interval equivalent to the distance of LD decay,57 the genes flanking the peak SNPs and falling within the window of LD decay were always used to predict the candidate genes.81 As the average LD across our panel is very low (mean pairwise r2 = 0.0176), it is reasonable to suppose that the detected loci in our study will be located in close proximity to the candidate genes controlling seed weight, and that these tightly associated SNPs would be of significant benefit in a molecular design breeding approach to improve seed weight.Supplementary DataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by the Chinese National Basic Research and Development Program (2011CB109302), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31301360), Strategic Japanese-Chinese Cooperative Program on ‘Climate Change’ (2012DFG90290), National Science and Technology Pillar Program during the Twelfth Five-year Plan Period (2011BAD35B09) and Chengguang Program for Young Scientists of Wuhan Municipal Government (2013070104010031).Supplementary data"

IntroductionOptically pure lactic acid is necessary for the production of the bioplastic polylactic acid. The use of cellulosic biomass instead of food crops should lower the cost for commercial production of this green plastic. Enterococcus mundtii QU 25 is a non-dairy bacterial strain that was originally isolated from ovine faeces.1 Unlike most lactic acid bacteria, strain QU 25 can ferment both cellobiose and xylose to produce l-lactic acid.1,2 This strain metabolizes a mixture of glucose and cellobiose simultaneously without apparent carbon catabolite repression (CCR),1 and it produces optically pure l-lactate (=99.9%) with a yield of 1.41 mol/mol xylose consumed, without by-products such as acetic acid or ethanol.1,2 Moreover, high productivity of l-lactic acid in an open repeated batch fermentation system under non-sterile conditions was demonstrated.3 Therefore, the use of strain QU 25 is highly desirable for the economical production of l-lactate from renewable biomass substrates. Furthermore, determination of the genome sequence of this bacterium is necessary to generate optimized, recombinant strains for commercial use.Draft genome sequences of microorganisms can be obtained rapidly and cost-effectively by using second-generation sequencing technologies. Owing to its relatively short read length of second-generation platforms (100–700 bp), obtaining a complete genome sequence requires additional costs and time-consuming finishing steps such as scaffolding and gap closing. By comparison, third-generation single molecule real time (SMRT) sequencing technology developed by Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) can produce considerably long sequences (~23 kb). Complete genome sequencing using only PacBio sequence data was recently reported.4To date, there have been only two draft genome sequences available for E. mundtii (strains CRL16565 and ATCC 882). Here, we report the complete genome sequence of strain QU 25, whose chromosome sequence was determined using only PacBio sequence data. This is the first complete genome sequence of an E. mundtii strain. The data reveal useful insights on lactic acid fermentation in this bacterium, as well as phylogenetic relationships with other Enterococcus species.2. Materials and methods2.1. Culture conditions and preparation of genomic DNA for sequencingEnterococcus mundtii QU 25 cells were grown to mid-log phase in GM17.6 Cells from 100-ml culture were harvested, suspended in 25 ml of a solution containing 2 g of polyethylene glycol 2000, 62.5 mg of egg white lysozyme, and 5 mM Tris–hydrochloride (pH 8.0), and incubated for 60 min at 37°C. After centrifugation, the cells were resuspended in 12.5 ml of TES buffer (50 mM Tris–hydrochloride [pH 7.6], 20 mM sodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and 25% sucrose), treated with 8 µg/ml of ribonuclease A for 60 min at 37°C, and then lysed with heat at 60°C for 2 h in the presence of 40 µg/ml of proteinase K and 1.7% sodium dodecyl sulphate. Total DNA was extracted gently from the lysate with PCI mixture (phenol, chloroform, and isoamyl alcohol in a ratio of 25 : 24 : 1, respectively) three times and precipitated with ethanol.2.2. Genome sequencingFor PacBio RS sequencing, two types of SMRTbell DNA template libraries were created with 1- and 10-kb sheared genomic DNA, and prepared using the standard PacBio RS sample preparation methods with C2 chemistry specific to each insert size. The 10-kb library was sequenced on eight SMRT cells with a 1 × 120-min collection protocol, generating 189 953 post-filtered continuous long reads (CLRs; mean length, 3702 bp; maximum length 20 405 bp; ~234× coverage). The 1-kb library was sequenced on eight SMRT cells with a 2 × 55-min collection protocol, generating 258 068 post-filtered circular consensus sequences (CCS; mean length, 660 bp; ~57× coverage).For the second-generation Roche/454 sequencing, a 1.6-kb fragment library was sequenced using the GS-FLX+ system. A total of 302 056 reads (mean length, 455 bp; ~34× coverage) was generated and assembled using Newbler (ver. 2.6). To estimate the plasmid copy number, a 500-bp paired-end library was sequenced using the Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx, generating 76-bp paired-end reads (48 724 736 reads, ~1234× coverage). The copy number of plasmid per chromosome was estimated based on the coverage ratio between the corresponding contig and the chromosome contig using CLC Genomics workbench 6 (CLC bio, Aarhus, Denmark).2.3. Error correction, assembly, and optical mappingThe error correction of CLRs was performed using the command pacBioToCA.7 CCS (57× length coverage) reads were used for correction. After error correction, we selected reads named PacBio-corrected Reads (PBcRs) for assembly. Assembly was performed using Celera Assembler (ver. 7.0).8 To confirm the correctness of the assembly, DNA from QU 25 cells was digested using NcoI and a whole-genome optical map (OpGen, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD, USA) was generated.92.4. Genome analysisAt first, the genome sequence was automatically annotated using the MiGAP, Microbial Genome Annotation Pipeline (www.migap.org) with the g-MiGAP level. In the pipeline, open reading frames (ORFs) were identified using MetaGeneAnnotator,10 and genes for tRNAs and rRNAs were identified by tRNAscan-SE and RNAmmer, respectively.11 Predicted ORFs were annotated using BLASTP searches against other Enterococcus genomes, and National Center of Biological Information (NCBI) nr12 with an E-value of 1 × 10-10. Additional annotation was performed using InterProScan13 and KEGG pathway analyses.14 Regions containing prophage were predicted by a phage search tool, PHAST (http://phast.wishartlab.com/)15 and further manual inspection. The insertion sequence (IS) was detected by ISsaga.16 CRISPR loci were detected by CRISPRfinder.17 For comparative genomes of other Enterococcus spp., a draft genome sequence of E. mundtii ATCC 882 was obtained from the Broad Institute website (https://olive.broadinstitute.org/genomes/ente_mund_atcc882.1). In addition, complete genome sequences of five Enterococcus spp. with (E. casseliflavus EC2018: NC_021023; E. faecalis V58319: NC_004668, NC_004669, NC_004670, and NC_004671; E. faecium Aus000420: NC_017022, NC_017023, NC_017024, and NC_017032; E. faecium DO21: NC_017960, NC_017961, NC_017962, and NC_017963; E. hirae ATCC 979022: NC_015845 and NC_018081) were obtained from the NCBI website for genome comparisons. GenomeMatcher23 and In Silico Molecular Cloning Genomics Edition (IMC-GE) software (In Silico Biology, Japan) were also used for intra- and inter-QU 25 genome comparisons.2.5. Vancomycin resistance assayEnterococcus mundtii QU 25 was propagated in MRS medium (Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK) at 30°C for 12 h as a pre-culture. One hundred microliters of pre-culture were inoculated in 10 ml of MRS medium containing various concentrations of vancomycin (2–100 µg/ml, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). After incubation at 30°C for 24 h, the minimum concentration of vancomycin that resulted in the absence of growth was considered to be the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC).2.6. Bacteriocin activity assayLactobacillus sakei JCM 1157T and E. faecalis JCM 5803T were employed as indicator strains for bacteriocin activity. Taken together with E. mundtii QU 25, E. mundtii QU 2 (mundticin producer)24 and JCM 8731T (non-bacteriocin producer) were tested as positive and negative controls, respectively. The three E. mundtii strains were also used as indicator strains for cross- and self-immunity. All strains were propagated in MRS medium at 30°C for 12–18 h before use. Strains QU 25, QU 2, and JCM 8731T were cultured in MRS medium at 30°C for 12 h for bacteriocin production. Bacteriocin activity assay was performed by the spot-on-lawn method, as described previously.25 Briefly, 10 µl of each cell-free culture supernatant were spotted onto a double-layered agar plate containing 5 ml of Lactobacilli Agar AOAC (BD, Sparks, MD, USA) inoculated with an overnight culture of an indicator strain as an upper layer, and 10 ml of MRS medium supplemented with 1.2% agar as a bottom layer. After overnight incubation at appropriate temperatures for indicator strains, bacterial lawns were checked for inhibition zones.2.7. Catalase and haemolysin activity assaysStrain QU 25 was tested for catalase activity by two methods. First, cells cultured in MRS liquid medium at 30°C for 12 h were collected by centrifugation and examined for catalase activity by the addition of 3% hydrogen peroxide solution. Secondly, colonies formed on the sheep blood-containing agar plates (Eiken Chemical, Tokyo, Japan) after incubation at 30°C for 24 h were examined by the addition of 3% hydrogen peroxide solution. Generation of oxygen bubbles was considered to be indicative of catalase activity. Colonies formed on blood agar plates were also examined for haemolysin activity. Discolouration or clearing of blood agar in the vicinity of the colonies was regarded as haemolysis.2.8. Nucleotide sequence accession numbersThe complete genome sequence for E. mundtii QU 25 was deposited in GenBank/DDBJ/EMBL under accession numbers AP013036–AP013041.3. Results and discussion3.1. Genome summaryTo determine the full genome sequence of E. mundtii QU 25, we combined two sequencing platforms: PacBio and Roche/454. As a result, the complete chromosome sequence of E. mundtii QU 25 was determined using only PacBio RS sequencing. This technology generates two types of sequences: CLRs and CCS reads.26 The read length of CLRs can reach up to 23 kb; however, the average base accuracy is only 82.1–84.4%.7 CCS reads are consensus sequences obtained from multiple passes on a single sequence with relatively short lengths (~2 kb) and a low error rate.27 The PBcR algorithm can improve read accuracy of CLRs from 80% to over 99.9% by using CCS reads.7Error correction of CLRs was done using high-accuracy sequences of CCS with the PBcR algorithm.7 After error correction, the resulting 6806 PBcRs of at least 7-kb length (mean length, 8517 bp; maximum length, 16 733 bp; ~20× coverage) were assembled, generating five contigs. Comparison between the NcoI digest of the whole-genome optical map and in silico-generated physical maps of contigs showed that the largest contig (3 Mb) was mapped onto the chromosome, confirming the correctness of the assembly (Fig. 1A). Thus, we concluded that the remaining four contigs were plasmids. The presence of the 2.5-kb plasmid, which had been detected as an extrachromosomal element by agarose gel electrophoresis (data not shown), was not included in the five contigs generated by PacBio, due to its assembly threshold of 7-kb read length. Therefore, we adapted one contig produced using Roche/454. Analysis of the Enterococcus mundtii QU 25 complete genome.

Coordinates on the genome were designated as bp starting from the first nucleotide of the start codon of dnaA. We confirmed the likely location of the replication terminus by identifying a single dif sequence (ACTTTGTATAATATATATTATGTAAACT, position 1 449 088 to 1 449 115) that aligns with the shift in GC skew (Fig. 1B). A total of 2900 protein-coding sequences (CDS), 63 tRNA genes, and 6 rRNA operons were predicted in the QU 25 chromosome. General features of the Enterococcus mundtii QU 25 genomeGeneral features of the Enterococcus mundtii QU 25 genome3.2. Genomic comparisons with other Enterococcus speciesFrom the phylogeny based on 16S rRNA sequences, E. mundtii was closely related to E. hirae and E. faecium, while E. casseliflavus and E. faecalis were more distantly related to E. mundtii.28 To investigate the taxonomic position of E. mundtii QU 25 based on genome-wide comparisons, we first carried out ortholog analysis with the draft genome of E. mundtii ATCC 882 and five complete genomes of other Enterococcus spp., including two E. faecium strains (DO and Aus0004), E. hirae ATCC 9790, E. casseliflavus EC20, and E. faecalis V583 (Supplementary Table S1 and Fig. 1B). The results were consistent with the phylogeny based on 16S rRNA. While E. mundtii ATCC 882 showed the highest similarity to QU 25 as anticipated, two other species (E. faecium DO and Aus0004, and E. hirae ATCC 9790) showed moderate degrees of similarity, while E. casseliflavus EC20 and E. faecalis V583 were the least similar. DNA dot plot analysis showed the centre diagonal line between QU 25, the two E. faecium strains, and E. hirae (Fig. 2), indicating that not only each of the genes but also their genome structures (or gene orders) were related. There were gene regions unique to the QU 25 strain (Fig. 1B). Except for prophages, the 9-kb region (positions 1 359 588–1 368 963) includes five hypothetical proteins and a cell wall-anchored protein with a LPXTG motif.

Dot plots were generated using BLASTN and GenomeMatcher software. This figure appears in colour in the online version of DNA Research.3.3. Mobile genetic elementsThree chromosomal regions were identified as prophage loci. Their positions are indicated in Fig. 1B and are named phiEmqu1 (38.7 kb; positions 806 547–845 215), phiEmqu2 (47.9 kb; positions 2 327 297–2 375 151), and phiEmqu3 (40.8 kb; positions 2 556 843–2 597 594). Sixty, 70, and 54 phage-related genes were identified in these regions, respectively (Supplementary Table S2). Prophages phiEmqu1 and phiEmqu3 contained several putative genes involved in DNA replication. However, no genes for DNA synthesis were found in the largest prophage phiEmqu2, suggesting that it is replication-defective. As shown in Fig. 1B, the locations of ori (dnaA) and ter (dif) were not exactly opposite each other. The dif motif, which is strongly associated with replication termini,29 was ~60 kb off the exact opposite position of ori (dnaA). Phage-mediated replicore imbalance has been observed in E. faecium Aus0004.20 Thus, the replicore balance of QU 25 could be disrupted by the insertion of phiEmqu2 and/or phiEmqu3.Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) are involved in a recently discovered interference pathway that protects cells from bacteriophages and conjugative plasmids. Approximately 40% of sequenced bacterial genomes and ~90% of genomes from archaea contain at least one CRISPR locus.30 No CRISPR loci were detected in the QU 25 genome. Many insertion sequence elements (ISEs) have been found in enterococci. The relatively closed species, such as E. mundtii ATCC 882, E. faecium DO and Aus0004 strains, and E. hirae ATCC 9790, have 21, 180, 76, and 14 ISEs and transposase-related genes, respectively. At least 13 different ISEs were detected in the QU 25 genome, ranging in copy number from 1 to 5, representing 33 distinct copies and distributed around the chromosome and plasmids (Supplementary Table S3). The most frequently observed ISE type was the ISL3 family.3.4. PlasmidsEnterococcus spp. have been reported to possess a number of plasmids that often confer resistance to antimicrobials and particular heavy metals, and serve to enhance virulence and/or DNA repair mechanisms.31–34 In strain QU 25, the plasmid copy number per chromosome was estimated by observing the distribution of read coverage of the Illumina sequence read, which indicated one copy of pQY182, pQY082, pQY039, and pQY024, and five copies of pQY003 (Table 1). BLASTN analyses showed that these five plasmids were similar to those of E. mundtii, E. faecium, E. hirae, or E. faecalis (Supplementary Table S4).Plasmid pQY182 harbours genes that encode a two-component regulatory system, a cellulose 1,4-beta-cellobiosidase, a toxin–antitoxin system, and several proteins with DNA repair functions. Plasmid pQY082 harbours duplicated regions of 8.3 kb, which include the IS1675 transposase, ubiD family decarboxylase, two cell surface proteins, and two proteins with unknown functions (EMQU_3088-3094 and EMQU_3155-3160 with 99% similarity). pQY082 also harbours genes that encode several proteins with DNA repair functions and a toxin–antitoxin system. Toxin–antitoxin systems have been frequently reported in E. faecium strains,35 and the QU 25 chromosome additionally has at least four such systems. Plasmid pQY039 contains several genes for a DNA damage-inducible protein and a gene encoding a toxin–antitoxin system. Plasmid pQY024 also harbours genes for a DNA damage-inducible protein, a toxin–antitoxin system, and mundticin KS genes (see Discussion later). Plasmid pQY003 only harbours genes with unknown function, except for the replication initiation protein.3.5. Vancomycin resistanceBecause many Enterococcus isolates show vancomycin resistance which has been associated with hospital-acquired infections, we tested the sensitivity of QU 25 to this antibiotic for the safety of industrial use. The results showed that the vancomycin MIC for QU 25 was >2 µg/ml, indicating that this strain is vancomycin-sensitive. Several known genes involved in vancomycin resistance (vanA, vanB, vanX, vanH, vanR, and vanS)36 were not detected in the QU 25 genome and also in plasmids.3.6. Bacteriocin activity and self- and cross-immunityBacteriocins are ribosomally synthesized bacterial peptides or proteins that show antimicrobial activity, generally against species that are closely related to bacteriocin producers.24 Mundticin is one of the bacteriocins produced by some E. mundtii strains. It is significant to clarify whether QU 25 produces mundticin or not for the resistivity to contamination in a large-scale culture. Three genes, such as munA (mundticin precursor), munB (ATP-binding cassette [ABC] transporter), and munC (mundticin KS immunity protein), are responsible for mundticin production in E. mundtii NERI 7393.37 The gene cluster containing these three genes was identified on plasmid pQY024, and munA (EMQU_3203; 100% nucleotide sequence identity), munB (EMQU_3204; 99.56% nucleotide sequence identity), and munC (EMQU_3205; 98.99% nucleotide sequence identity) showed high homology with corresponding genes in strain NERI 7393.To examine whether the gene cluster for mundticin synthesis was functional, QU 25 was tested for bacteriocin production. QU 25 and E. mundtii QU 2 showed bacteriocin activity against three indicator strains (L. sakei JCM 1157T, E. faecalis JCM 5803T, and E. mundtii JCM 8731T), none of which showed inhibitory activity (Table 2). QU 25 and QU 2 showed no activity against each other (Table 2), which indicated that these strains have self- and cross-immunity against their bacteriocins. Bacteriocin-producing strains are known to have immunity (tolerance) to their own bacteriocins and to bacteriocins with similar structures. Collectively, these results strongly suggest that QU 25 produces a bacteriocin with similar characteristics to mundticin produced by QU 2.

Haemolysin activityHaemolysin is one of the putative enterococcal virulence factors,20 so it is important to test the haemolysin activity for the safety of industrial use in a large-scale culture. Four putative haemolysin genes (haemolysin, haemolysin III, haemolysin A, and a-haemolysin) were identified (EMQU_0190 and EMQU_0948, EMQU_0449, EMQU_0841, and EMQU_1982, respectively). We tested haemolysin activity and no changes to the blood agar in the vicinity of the colonies were observed (data not shown), suggesting that these putative haemolysin genes in QU 25 might be inactive or silent under the tested culture conditions.3.8. Metabolic pathways for lactic acid fermentationQU 25 was previously reported to have two different pathways for xylose metabolism: the phosphoketolase (PK) pathway and the pentose phosphate (PP)/glycolytic pathway in low xylose concentrations.2,38 When QU 25 was grown in high xylose concentrations, PK activity was not detected. However, higher transaldolase and transketolase activities were detected2, indicating that strain QU 25 would utilize the PP/glycolytic pathway, not the PK pathway, as the main pathway for lactic acid fermentation.Genes for xylose metabolism in the QU 25 chromosome were located in a 22-kb region (positions 2 904 895–2 926 710 bp) in two gene clusters: one involved in the initial metabolism of xylose and uptake of pentose, and the other involved in the PP/glycolytic pathway and uptake of related sugars (Fig. 3). The first gene cluster contained xylR (EMQU_2811; xylose repressor), xylA (EMQU_2810; xylose isomerase), xynB (EMQU_2809; xylan beta-1,4-xylosidase; additionally, there is another xynB gene [EMQU_2642] outside of this cluster), xylB (EMQU_2805; d-xylulose kinase), putative xylose transporter genes annotated as l-arabinose and d-ribose ABC transporter (EMQU_2806-2808), and a hypothetical protein (EMQU_2804), the N- and C-terminal regions of DNA mismatch repair protein (EMQU_2803 and EMQU_2802, respectively, which were thought as pseudogenes), ABC transporter ATP-binding protein (EMQU_2801), and its permease (EMQU_2800). Since pentose transporters have been shown to be promiscuous,39d-xylose would likely be transported by these gene products in QU 25. Gene clusters involved in the initial metabolism of xylose and the PP/glycolytic pathway in E. mundtii QU 25. Numbers below arrows indicate feature code (EMQU_XXXX).Gene clusters involved in the initial metabolism of xylose and the PP/glycolytic pathway in E. mundtii QU 25. Numbers below arrows indicate feature code (EMQU_XXXX).The second gene cluster contains genes for the PP/glycolytic pathway, including a transketolase (EMQU_2812) and a transaldolase (EMQU_2814). Furthermore, this cluster contains an allulose-6-phosphate 3-epimerase gene (EMQU_2813), genes for a fructose-like phosphotransferase system (EMQU_2815-2819), and a putative transcriptional regulator (EMQU_2820). Transketolase is a key enzyme in the PP/glycolytic pathway, and the QU 25 chromosome additionally harbours one transketolase gene (EMQU_1275). Since allulose-6-phosphate 3-epimerase catalyses the conversion of d-allulose-6-phosphate to d-fructose-6-phosphate, this enzyme and the fructose transporters may supply various ketoses to the PP/glycolytic pathway. For genes involved in the PK pathway, PK (EMQU_1837), acetate kinase (EMQU_2620), phosphotransacetylase (EMQU_2119), acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (EMQU_2205), and alcohol dehydrogenase (EMQU_1129, EMQU_1829, and EMQU_2109) were dispersed throughout the chromosome.To get insights into the lactic acid fermentation characteristics of strain QU 25, we performed the comparative analysis on the presence of key enzymes related to lactic acid fermentation from xylose using KO (KEGG Orthology) gene assignment (Supplementary Table S5). Two clinical isolates of E. faecium (DO and Aus0004) and E. hirae ATCC 9790 lack genes necessary for the metabolism of xylose (transaldolase, PK, xylulokinase, and xylose isomerase). Another clinical isolate, E. faecalis V583, lacks genes for transketolase, transaldolase, and PK. Thus, it is most unlikely that these strains metabolize xylose. E. casseliflavus EC20 has genes for PK, xylulokinase, and xylose isomerase, so that this strain can metabolize xylose by the PK pathway. It also has two complete genes for transketolase, but lacks transaldolase for the PP/glycolytic pathway. However, Kato et al.40 reported that Lactococcus lactis IO-1, which can utilize xylose, also lacks the gene for transaldolase and is presumed to have an alternative PP/glycolytic pathway. Therefore, EC20 might metabolize xylose also by the PP/glycolytic pathway. Two E. mundtii strains (QU 25 and ATCC 882) have two genes of full-length transketolase and all other genes necessary for the xylose metabolism by the two pathways. The results of our genomic analysis coincide with the description on their phenotype about xylose metabolism in Bergey's Manual (p. 599, Table 116).28 From these results, remarkable genomic features related to lactic acid fermentation in QU 25 still remain unclear, and the analysis of transcriptional regulation of these genes could help its clarification.QU 25 was able to metabolize a mixture of glucose and cellobiose simultaneously without apparent CCR.1 In Gram-positive bacteria, the roles of catabolite control protein A (CcpA) and seryl-phosphorylated form of histidine-containing protein (P-Ser-HPr) in CCR have been well studied.41 Genes encoding CcpA (EMQU_1943), HPr (EMQU_0954), and HPr kinase/phosphorylase (EMQU_1951) were also found in the QU 25 genome. The mechanism by which CCR is prevented in the presence of glucose is still unknown.Strain QU 25 shows a predominant production of l-(+)-lactate when grown at high concentrations of cellobiose and xylose, whereas d-lactic acid was not detected in the culture broth.1,2 However, two l-lactate dehydrogenase genes (l-LDH; EMQU_1380 and EMQU_2714) and one d-lactate dehydrogenase gene (d-LDH; EMQU_2453) were identified. Potentially, little or no d-LDH was expressed under these culture conditions. Lactate racemase, another gene involved in d-lactic acid formation,42 was not found in the QU 25 genome.4. ConclusionsWe have highlighted the phylogenetic relationship of E. mundtii QU 25 with related enterococcal species and characterized mobile genetic elements, including multiple prophages and ISEs, plasmids, and genes for metabolic pathways for lactic acid fermentation in this strain. In addition, we have demonstrated that QU 25 has bacteriocin activity. The complete E. mundtii QU 25 genome sequence described here may be an important resource in the genetic engineering of recombinant strains for optimized production of lactic acid.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis study was supported by the MEXT-Supported Program for the Strategic Research Foundation at Private Universities, 2008-2012 (S0801025).We thank Pacific Biosciences, Inc.

IntroductionCytokinins are N6-substituted adenine derivatives that have significant functions in various aspects of plant growth and development, including apical dominance, shoot or root branching, leaf expansion, lateral bud growth, photosynthesis, seed germination, floral transition, and leaf senescence.1 Cytokinin signal transduction is mediated by a two-component system (TCS), which is similar to the two-component phosphorelay system that allows bacteria to sense and respond to environmental changes.2 Although this system was originally discovered in bacteria, two-component signalling elements have also been identified in fungi, slime molds, and plants. However, a canonical histidyl-aspartyl phosphorelay is not found in animals.3–6 A simple TCS involves a histidine (His) sensor kinase and a response regulator (RR)6,7 His kinase (HK) perceives environmental stimuli via an input domain and autophosphorylates in a conserved His residue in a kinase domain. This phosphoryl group is then transferred to a conserved Asp residue on the receiver (Rec) domain of an RR. An RR undergoes phosphorylation, thereby modulating its ability to mediate downstream signalling. Eukaryotes, such as yeast and plants, have evolved a more complex multi-step TCS with additional phosphorylation steps and His phosphotransfer (HP) proteins.8 Multi-component phosphorelay systems employ HK signal transduction in a multi-step His-Asp-His-Asp phosphotransfer process.Genes involved in the TCS have been extensively studied in Arabidopsis. The completion of the Arabidopsis genome sequence has revealed 55 genes encoding putative HK (AHK), HP (AHP), RR (ARR), and related proteins. Arabidopsis HKs are grouped into three main subfamilies: cytokinin receptor; ethylene receptor; and phytochrome. In addition, three HKs (CKI1, AHK5, and AHK1) are present in Arabidopsis; such kinases do not belong in these groups. The overall structures comprise a hybrid sensor HK containing a variable input domain, several N-terminal transmembrane domains, and a transmitter domain with a conserved structure, which includes the His residue that is the site of autophosphorylation, and a fused Rec domain.9 However, the transmitters of three ethylene receptors (ETR2, ERS2, and EIN4) and phytochromes lack key residues in highly conserved HK sequence motifs; thus, these transmitters unlikely perform HK activity. For this reason, these molecules are called diverged HKs of two-component elements.10–13 Moreover, three cytokinin receptors (AHK2, AHK3, and AHK4) share a cyclase/HK-associated sensory extracellular (CHASE) domain, which is a putative recognition site for cytokinins.14 Five ethylene receptors (ETR1, ERS1, ETR2, ERS2, and EIN4) also share an ethylene-binding domain (C2H4). Five phytochromes (PHYA, B, C, D, and E) are characterized by a chromophore-binding domain (PHY) and two PAS (Per/Arndt/Sim) folds. AHPs, which contain a highly conserved xHQxKGSSxS motif, can mediate the transfer of a phosphate group from the Rec domain of an AHK to the Rec domain of an ARR.15 AHP6 is a pseudo-His-containing phosphotransfer (HPt) protein without a conserved histidine residue; thus, AHP6 cannot function as a phosphotransfer protein. In fact, AHP6 functions as a negative regulator of cytokinin signalling by inhibiting phosphorelay from phosphorylated AHP1 to ARR1.16 The canonical members of ARRs can be divided into two major classes: Type-A ARRs and Type-B ARRs, according to their amino acid sequences and conserved domains. Type-A ARRs are primary cytokinin response proteins comprising a Rec domain along with short C-terminal extensions. Type-B ARRs are composed of an N-terminal Rec domain and a large C-terminal output domain with a Type-B signature GARP (GOLDEN/ARR/Psr1) motif of ~60 amino acids17 that are distantly related to the Myb DNA-binding superfamily.18,19 Type-C ARRs are also present, and the members of this protein class were originally considered as Type-A ARRs because these molecules have the same domain structure.20 In contrast to the Type-A ARR genes, Type-C ARR genes cannot be induced by cytokinin,20–22 and their functions in the cytokinin signalling pathway remain unknown. In addition, diverge RRs, referred to as pseudo-RRs (PRRs), lack the conserved Asp for phosphorylation.23 As a highly characterized pseudo-RR, Clock PRR contains a distinct plant-specific Co, Col and Toc1 (CCT) motif in their C-terminal extensions and functions in the regulation of circadian rhythms.24–26Abiotic stress conditions, such as drought and high salinity, are two of the most common stress factors that adversely affect plant growth and yield. Plants have evolved a complex signalling network at molecular, cellular, and system levels to survive and flourish in varied environments.27 Phosphorylation, which is mediated by TCS genes, is a key mechanism of stress signal transduction in plant cells.28 Increasing evidence demonstrates that TCS genes are involved in the response pathway to environmental stimuli in Arabidopsis, rice, and soybean.29–37 To date, TCS genes have been identified at a genome-wide scale in various plant species, including Arabidopsis,13,15 rice,26,38–41Lotus japonicus,42 soybean,28,32 maize,43,44 and Physcomitrella patens,45–47 among others. However, the knowledge of their potential functions in stress adaptations remains confined to Arabidopsis and rice. Studies on TCS genes in Chinese cabbage are yet to be conducted.Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa ssp. pekinensis) is one of the most important B. rapa crops and considered as an economically important vegetable worldwide because of its high yield and good quality. The whole-genome sequencing of B. rapa (Chiifu-401-42) by the Brassica rapa Genome Sequencing Project Consortium48 enables us to undertake a genome-wide identification and functional analysis of the gene families related to the morphological diversity and agronomic traits of Brassica crops.49 Furthermore, the ‘A’ genome of B. rapa is an important resource to study the evolution of polyploidy genomes and potential strategies to improve Brassica-related crops genetically.50 Given the significance of TCS genes in diverse biological and physiological processes, including our main interest area of abiotic stress responses, whole genome-wide analysis was performed to identify the HK, HP, and RR proteins involved in TCS in Chinese cabbage. The gene structures, conserved domains, and phylogenetic relationships of the TCS genes were analysed in detail. A comprehensive analysis of tissue or organ-specific expressions of TCS genes in Chinese cabbage, and their expression profiles to abiotic stresses (drought and high salinity) and exogenous phytohormones (tZ and ABA) were conducted. Moreover, the gene duplications and evolutionary patterns of the TCS genes in Chinese cabbage and Arabidopsis were determined. Our results provided a framework of future functional analyses of the TCS genes and lay a good foundation for the utilization of potential genes used for breeding to enhance plant production, quality, and stress-resistance in Chinese cabbage.2. Materials and methods2.1. Identification of TCS genes in Chinese cabbageArabidopsis TCS protein sequences were used as seed sequences to search the Brassica Database (BRAD) Version 1.1 (http://brassicadb.org/brad/)48,51,52 and the NCBI database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). The search was based on a BLASTP search with an expected value of 100. The protein sequences of the identified TCS members were used as queries to reconfirm the multiple databases to ensure that no additional related genes were missing from the database. All of the sequences that satisfied the requirements were analysed by using the Pfam database (http://pfam.janelia.org/),53 the SMART database (http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/),54 and the Conserved Domain Database of the NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/wrpsb.cgi)55 to eliminate the genes that did not contain the known conserved domains and motifs of the TCS members. The genomic information concerning on the chromosome locations of the TCS genes and the amino acid sequences of TCS proteins were obtained from BRAD. HKL members in soybean were identified and supplied as described.28 Sequence identities were calculated using the MatGAT software.562.2. Gene structure, motif recognition, multiple-sequence alignment, and phylogenetic analysesThe gene structure schematic of the TCS genes was illustrated using the Gene Structure Display Server (http://gsds.cbi.pku.edu.cn/). To identify the conserved motifs of the TCS protein sequences, we used the online MEME (http://meme.sdsc.edu/meme/meme.html).57 The deduced amino acid sequences of the conserved HK domain, Rec domain, Hpt domain, Myb domain, and CCT motif were aligned using the ClustalX program.58 For the phylogenetic relationships of HK, HP, and RR genes in B. rapa and Arabidopsis thaliana, the identified HK, HP, and RR protein sequences were separately aligned with a gap opening penalty of 10 and a gap extension penalty of 0.2 by using ClustalW implemented in the MEGA5.0 software (http://www.megasoftware.net/).59 The phylogenetic trees were further constructed using the neighbour-joining (NJ) method, in which Poisson correction, pairwise deletion, and bootstrapping (1000 replicates; random seeds) were considered as parameters.2.3. Analysis of the putative promoter regions of the TCS genes in Chinese cabbageThe upstream sequences (1000 bp) of the transcriptional start site of each TCS gene were chosen as the putative promoter regions to identify the abiotic stress-related and phytohormone-related cis-elements. The PlantCARE website (http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/plantcare/html/search_CARE.html) was used to identify the putative cis-regulatory elements along the promoter sequences.60 Besides, the recently reported stress-responsive cis-motifs that were not covered,61–66 such as ICEr1, ICEr2, NACRS, ZFHDR, MYBR, MYCR, CRT, ABRE, EE, G-box, T/G box, and CE3, were also used as queries to search against the promoter sequences. In addition, the upstream sequences (1000 bp) of the Type-A RR genes were used to query the PLACE database (http://www.dna.affrc.go.jp/PLACE/)67 and search for the three regulatory motifs: the cytokinin-responsive Type-B ARR1-binding elements AGATT68 and GATCTT19,69 and the cytokinin-enhanced protein-binding element TATTAG.702.4. Chromosomal localization, gene duplications, and evolutionary analysis of the TCS genes in Chinese cabbage and ArabidopsisThe Brassica Genome Browse (http://brassicadb.org/cgi-bin/gbrowse/cbgdb11/) was used to map the positions of the TCS genes in the physical maps of 10 B. rapa chromosomes. The TCS genes of A. thaliana were distributed and visualized using a chromosome map tool (http://www.arabidopsis.org/jsp/ChromosomeMap/tool.jsp). Tandem duplications were defined whether or not the two genes are separated by four or fewer gene loci.71 Segmental duplications were identified by synteny analysis using an online tool (http://chibba.agtec.uga.edu/duplication/).72 The synteny analysis of the TCS genes was performed using PGDD (http://chibba.agtec.uga.edu/duplication/). The occurrence of duplication events and homologous genes divergence as well as selective pressure on duplicated genes were estimated by calculating synonymous (Ks) and non-synonymous substitutions (Ka) per site between the duplicated gene pairs by using the Codeml procedure of the PAML program.73 The divergence time was calculated at a neutral substitution rate of 1.5 × 10–8 substitutions per site per year for the chalcone synthase gene (Chs).742.5. Plant growth, treatments, and samplingBrassica rapa subsp. pekinensis line Chiifu-401-42 was grown in an experimental farm in Zhejiang University. The roots, floral stems, leaves, little buds (<1.6 mm), medium-sized buds (1.6–2.8 mm), big buds (>2.8 mm), flowers, sepals, petals, stamens, pistils, little siliques, medium-sized siliques, and big siliques of the plant were sampled to analyse the tissue- or organ-specific expressions. Methods and sites of sampling were described previously.75 Besides, little siliques, medium-sized siliques, and big siliques were defined as siliques at 3, 14, and 25 days after pollination and fertilization.All of the seedlings used for treatment were grown at 25 ± 1°C for ~3 weeks with a 16-h light/8-h dark photoperiod. The nutrient solution was supplied with 200 mM NaCl for salt treatment. The total roots were separately collected at 0, 3, 8, 24, and 48 h after stress induction. Three-week-old seedlings were withheld from watering to simulate drought conditions, and the seedlings were divided into four levels (0, I, II, and III) based on the degree of the drought symptoms as previously described.75 The total roots were separately collected at these four levels. For mock control, seedlings were grown at normal conditions with nutrient solution and samples were collected in the meanwhile. For plant hormone treatment, 3-week-old seedlings were sprayed with the following: 100 µM trans-zeatin (tZ) for the cytokinin treatment and 100 µM abscisic acid (ABA) for the ABA treatment. Only the second true leaves were sampled to minimize differences. The leaves were sampled at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 h after spraying, and the control sample was sprayed with double distilled water alone. All the samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in a refrigerator at -75°C.2.6. RNA extraction and quantitative reverse transcription PCR analysisRNA extraction, reverse-transcription, and quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) reactions were performed as previously described75 using the primers listed in Supplementary Table S1. The specificity of the reactions was verified by melting curve analysis, and the products were further confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The BrCyp gene was used as the reference gene to study different organs or tissues and developmental stages; the BrUBC30 gene was used in abiotic stress and plant hormone treatment studies as recommended by Xiao et al.76 The comparative <U+0394><U+0394>Ct method was used to calculate the relative expression levels of different genes. qRT-PCR results were clustered using the average linkage method with Pearson correlation distance metric by Multiple Array Viewer.773. Results and discussion3.1. Identification and annotation of the TCS genes in Chinese cabbageA total of 85 TCS gene members were identified based on BLASTP search results against the BRAD and NCBI databases from the B. rapa genome. The DNA, CDS, protein sequences, and promoter regions of all the identified TCS members were provided in Supplementary Dataset 1. A total of 20 BrHK(L) proteins were divided into two groups, BrHKs and BrHKLs, according to the characteristics of their conserved domains (Supplementary Table S2). Eleven BrHKs contained a conserved histidine-kinase domain (HK), whereas nine BrHKLs comprised a diverged histidine-kinase-like domain (HKL). Seven BrHPs with conserved HPt domain and BrPHP1 with a pseudo-HPt lacking the His phosphorylation site were retrieved (Supplementary Table S3). A total of 57 RR proteins were further classified into 21 Type-A RRs, 17 Type-B RRs, 4 Type-C RRs, and 15 pseudo-RRs based on their conserved domains and motifs (Supplementary Table S4). BrRR22 lacked the Myb domain, but BrRR22 was still assigned to Type-B RRs because this gene exhibited high similarities with the proteins in this group. The full-length gene was unlikely obtained; thus, further analysis should be conducted to obtain the full-length clone and to classify this gene in the Type-B RR subfamily. Many TCS proteins in Chinese cabbage shared high sequence identities with their Arabidopsis counterparts, indicating the conservative evolution of TCS genes. To show a clear and systematic understanding of the number of TCS genes in plant genomes, we summarized the TCS genes that have already been identified in several plants (Table 1). Considering that Brassica genomes have undergone another whole-genome triplication (WGT) after speciation from A. thaliana, we presumed that the TCS genes in Chinese cabbage should have approximately three times as many members as that of Arabidopsis. However, the TCS genes identified in Chinese cabbage were only 1.55 times as many as those found in Arabidopsis. This result suggested that a substantial loss of genes after a hexaploid was formed by WGT. This finding is consistent with that in previous studies, in which a total of 41 174 protein-coding genes have been identified in the B. rapa genome; such genes were roughly 1.5 times as many as those found in A. thaliana (27 411 genes in TAIR10).49 A total of 21 and 18 HK genes are found in the genomes of Glycine max and P. patens; however, this finding has raised a question on the numerous HK genes present and the mechanism by which these HK genes were obtained during evolution. The origin and evolutionary pattern of the TCS signalling pathway were investigated by surveying the genomes of several sequenced key plant species ranging from unicellular algae, moss, and lycophytes to higher land plants, including Arabidopsis and rice, to determine the proteins involved in cytokinin signal transduction.45 CHASE domain-containing proteins were not detected in the genomes of any of the algal species. Physcomitrella patens was possibly one of the most basal plant species containing all of the components necessary for cytokinin signalling. Moreover, the number of the cytokinin receptor genes did not increase in the same manner as that of the other components. This result is also true for the cytokinin receptor genes of Chinese cabbage in our study. In contrast, Chu et al.43 identified 11 ZmHKs with highly conserved CHASE domains. Eight ZmHKs comprised three conserved domains (CHASE, transmitter, and Rec domains). Three ZmHKLs contained a CHASE domain, but these proteins do not comprise an integral transmitter domain or Rec domain, suggesting that the CHASE domain is highly conserved in the evolution of ZmHKs. This surprising anomaly increased the complexity of the evolution of CHASE domain-containing cytokinin receptor genes in plants. By comparing the numbers of Type-A RR and Type-B RR genes in various species, it is noted that there was not always more Type-A RR genes than Type-B RR genes. Until now, we only have some knowledge that Type-B RR genes were already found in the unicellular algae while the Type-A RR genes, as the youngest subgroup of RR genes, only first appeared in the land plant species.45 Since RR members were identified in only several species, more rules might be found if more RR genes were identified.

Gene structure, conserved domain, and phylogenetic analysisTo analyse the structural characteristics and conserved regions of the TCS genes, we mapped the gene structures containing exons and introns. We also examined their conserved regions and motifs; furthermore, their putative protein sequences were aligned (Supplementary Fig. S1 and Table S4). The HK, HPt, Rec, and Myb domains as well as the CCT motif of the two-component elements were well conserved. However, a group of diverged two-component elements, such as BrHKLs, BrPHP1, and pseudo-BrRRs, lacked the conserved phosphorylation sites. In addition, to identify subgroups and reveal the evolutionary relationships of the TCS genes in Chinese cabbage, Arabidopsis, rice, and soybean, the complete amino acid sequences of HK(L), HP, and RR proteins were used to perform multiple alignments and construct phylogenetic trees. Besides, 15 GmHKLs were identified and supplied for a more complete phylogenetic tree (Supplementary Table S5 and Dataset 2). Figure 1 shows that HK(L) members were further divided into six subfamilies: cytokinin receptor subfamily; AHK5/CKI2 subfamily; AHK1 subfamily; CKI1 subfamily; ethylene receptor subfamily; and phytochrome subfamily. Cytokinin receptor subfamily comprised four BrHK proteins (BrHK6–9) with HK, HATPase, Rec, transmembrane (TM), and CHASE domains. The CHASE domain is specific for cytokinin receptor genes and necessary for cytokinin binding; this result indicated that BrHK6–9 genes may function as cytokinin receptors. The presence of a TM domain in the cytokinin receptor genes of Chinese cabbage indicates the endomembrane location of cytokinin-binding sites.78,79 AHK5/CKI2 subfamily comprised three BrHK proteins (BrHK2–4) with HK as well as HATPase and Rec domains; however, this subfamily lacked a TM domain. Both AHK1 and CKI1 subfamilies contained only one BrHK member with HK, HATPase, Rec, and TM domains. Ethylene receptor subfamily could be further divided into ethylene receptor subfamily I and ethylene receptor subfamily II. Ethylene receptor subfamily I was composed of two BrHK proteins (BrHK10 and BrHK11) with TM, C2H4, GAF, and HK domains. BrHK11 lacked the Rec domain. Ethylene receptor subfamily II was composed of four BrHKL proteins (BrHKL1–4) with TM, C2H4, GAF, and HKL domains. Both BrHKL3 and BrHKL4 lacked the Rec domain. BrHKL4 contained an additional MATH (meprin and TRAF homology) domain, which belonged to the TRAF-like superfamily. Based on the gene structure and conserved domains analyses, we proposed that BrHKL4 was formed by the fusion of two genes (Supplementary Fig. S5A). However, the actual fusion mechanism remains unknown. C2H4 is an ethylene-binding domain, suggesting its potential function in ethylene receptors. Phytochrome subfamily contained five BrHKL proteins (BrHKL5–9) with HKL, HATPase, GAF, PHY, and PAS domains. These BrHKLs lacked the Rec domain. PHY domain is a chromophore-binding domain. The presence of chromophore-binding domains demonstrated that they were candidate genes involved in phytochromes. The phylogentic tree constructed with all the authentic and pseudo-HPts of Chinese cabbage, Arabidopsis, rice, and soybean indicates the presence of subgroups (Fig. 2). BrHP1-4 and BrHP7 showed a close relationship with AHP1, AHP2, AHP3, and AHP5, which act as positive regulators in CK signalling.80BrHP5 and BrHP6 were clustered into a same group with AHP4, which showed relatively distinct genetic relationships from the other AHPs and might play negative roles in CK signalling.80 Besides, BrPHP1 was close to AHP6, a pseudo-HPt that lacked the His phosphorylation site, acting inhibitory roles in CK responses by competing with other AHPs.16 According to the classification method proposed by Schaller and co-workers,13,26 RR proteins were classified as Type-A, Type-B, Type-C, and pseudo-RRs (Fig. 3). All the Type-A RRs could be well clustered into a group, which comprised 21 Chinese cabbage members (BrRR1–21) with one conserved Rec domain (Rec). Type-B RRs seemed to be more diverse with five subgroups (I–V). Seventeen Chinese cabbage Type-B RR members located in Type-B I RRs (BrRR22–32), Type-B II RRs (BrRR36–38), and Type-B III RRs (BrRR33–35). Notably, several OsRRs alone occupied two extra subgroups. OsRR28, OsRR29, OsPRR11, and OsPRR12 composed a single subgroup, Type-B IV and also OsRR31-33 composed another single subgroup, Type-B V. We supposed that this phenomenon might be due to the fact that rice, as a monocotyledon, had distant relationships with dicotyledons. Type-C RRs contained four Chinese cabbage members (BrRR39–42) with conserved Rec domain (Rec) alone. Pseudo-RR members were mainly divided into two groups, i.e. Clock PRR and Type-B PRR. These pseudo-RR members had relatively closer phylogenetic relationships with Type-B RR members. Ten Clock BrPRR members (BrPRR1–10) contained the conserved CCT motif and conserved pseudo-Rec domain, which lacked the conserved amino acid that is essential for phosphorylation. Five Type-B BrPRR members were located in two clades, in which one clade contained four Type-B BrPRR members (BrPRR11–14) with the conserved pseudo-Rec domain and Myb domain; whereas the other clade contained BrPRR15 with the pseudo-Rec domain alone. The gene fusion phenomenon was also observed. Besides, the pseudo-Rec and Myb domains, BrPRR10 also had a CDF (cation diffusion facilitator) domain. Based on the gene structure and conserved domain analyses, BrPRR10 was also proposed to be formed by fusion of two genes (Supplementary Fig. S5B). They are not alone, in fact, we previously identified that BrCKX1-3 was formed by the fusion of the CKX and TPR gene.75Phylogenetic relationships of HK proteins and related proteins in Chinese cabbage, Arabidopsis, rice, and soybean.

This figure appears in colour in the online version of DNA Research.On the whole, all the TCS members from Chinese cabbage, Arabidopsis, rice, and soybean were classified and grouped well in our phylogenetic trees, which was consistent with previous results.26,28 However, it is evident that TCS members from the same species were interspersed in each subgroup, especially the monocotyledonous rice, suggesting that the closer phylogenetic relationships of the species, the closer phylogenetic relationships of homologous genes. For Chinese cabbage and Arabidopsis, each gene of Arabidopsis almost corresponded to 1–3 homologous Chinese cabbage genes in each clade of the phylogenetic tree, further supporting that Chinese cabbage genome underwent another WGT after divergence from Arabidopsis and this event occurred after Brassicaceae diverged from Gramineae and Leguminosae.3.3. Chromosomal distribution and duplications of TCS genes in Chinese cabbage and ArabidopsisChromosomal location of each TCS gene was determined from the genomic sequences of Chinese cabbage; in addition, 83 TCS genes were mapped on the 10 chromosomes with an apparently uneven distribution (Fig. 4). The two unmapped genes, BrHK6 and BrRR40, were located on Scaffold000104 and Scaffold000191, respectively. Gene duplication events are important to gene family evolution because duplicated genes provide the raw materials for the generation of new genes, which in turn facilitate the generation of new functions.81 Brassicaceae genomes have undergone three rounds of whole-genome duplication; these genomes are referred to as 1R, 2R, and 3R, which are equivalent to the <U+03B3>, ß, and a duplication events; furthermore, Brassica genomes have undergone another WGT (4R) after speciation from A. thaliana,82–84 which led to significantly increased duplicated gene numbers in B. rapa. In plants, gene numbers are mainly expanded by segmental and tandem duplications in gene families.85 We examined tandem duplications and segmental duplications of TCS genes in Chinese cabbage. As shown in Table 2, multiple TCS genes were involved in segmental duplications, whereas only one tandem duplicated gene pair was identified; therefore, the expansion of TCS genes in Chinese cabbage was mainly attributed to segmental duplications. Compared with duplicated TCS genes in Chinese cabbage, TCS genes in A. thaliana were also involved in segmental duplications, but with smaller percentage. However, all the 10 Type-A ARR genes and half of the Type-B ARR genes were strikingly segmentally duplicated.

The arrows next to gene names show the transcription direction.The synonymous substitution rates (Ks) and non-synonymous substitution rates (Ka) are measured to explore the gene divergence mechanism after duplication. Large-scale duplication events are defined as simultaneous gene duplication. Assuming a molecular clock, the Ks of these duplicates are expected to be similar over time. However, substantial rate variations are noted among genes.86 To elucidate the evolutionary patterns and divergence of the segmental duplicated TCS genes in Chinese cabbage and Arabidopsis, the Ks and Ka modes for the segmental duplicated paralogs and orthologs were determined (Supplementary Table S6). We used the relative Ks measure as the substitute for time to evaluate the divergence time between Chinese cabbage and Arabidopsis. The frequency distributions of the relative Ks values that were obtained from duplicated orthologous gene pairs, between the Chinese cabbage and Arabidopsis genomes and duplicated paralogous gene pairs in the Chinese cabbage and Arabidopsis genomes, are shown in Fig. 5. The relative Ks distribution of the duplicated paralogous gene pairs for TCS genes in A. thaliana peaked from 0.8 to 0.9, which indicated that these duplicated genes occurred at ~53 to 60 Mya, which corresponds to the 3R time.87,88 The relative Ks distribution of the duplicated paralogous gene pairs for TCS genes in Chinese cabbage displayed peaks from 0.3 to 0.4 and from 0.8 to 0.9, which suggests an additional duplication event occurred at ~20 to 26 Mya after 3R, which corresponds to the 4R time.88 Our results further confirmed the hypothesis that Brassica genomes have undergone another WGT after speciation from A. thaliana. The existence of gene duplications in Chinese cabbage and Arabidopsis that occurred during 3R also demonstrated their conservation during the long-term evolution. For the duplicated orthologous gene pairs between Chinese cabbage and Arabidopsis, the relative Ks distribution showed a major peak from 0.4 to 0.5, which suggests that the two genomes were separated at ~27 to 33 Mya; this finding was in agreement with previous studies that Brassica and Arabidopsis genomes diverged after the 3R event.87–91 In addition, another less obvious peak appeared from 0.7 to 0.8, which was responsible for the 3R event before the speciation between Brassica and Arabidopsis genomes. The Ks values distribution of the TCS genes in the genome of A. thaliana (At) and B. rapa (Br) viewed through the frequency distribution of Ks modes. Ks value distributions were obtained from duplicated paralogous genes pairs in the At genome (A) and Br genome (B) and duplicated orthologous gene pairs between the Br and At genomes (C). The vertical axis indicates the frequency of paired sequences, whereas the horizontal axis denotes the Ks values with a 0.1 interval.

Analysis of the putative promoter regions of TCS genes in Chinese cabbagecis-Regulatory elements, which are located upstream of genes and act as binding sites for TFs, have essential functions in determining the tissue-specific or stress-responsive expression patterns of genes.92 To further understand transcriptional regulation and potential functions of these TCS genes, 1000 bp regions upstream of the transcriptional start site were applied to identify cis-regulatory elements. A number of abiotic stress-related (e.g. drought, high salinity, extreme temperatures, and wound) and hormone-related (e.g. ABA, auxin, ethylene, GA, MeJA, and SA) cis-elements were found in the putative promoters of TCS genes in Chinese cabbage. These cis-elements are counted and classified in Supplementary Table S7. The occurrences of these cis-elements suggested that these TCS genes might have potential functions in abiotic stress adaptations and various hormone signalling.GARP is a Type-B signature; and the binding sites of GARP are present in the Type-A ARR gene promoters, which suggest that Type-B ARR proteins may bind to these promoters and activate transcription.19 Previous research also confirmed that cytokinin-dependent induction of the Type-A RR genes is partially dependent on transcriptional regulation by Type-B RR genes.68,93 We investigated the cytokinin-related binding elements in the Type-A BrRR promoter regions. Cytokinin-responsive Type-B ARR1-binding elements AGATT and GATCTT as well as cytokinin-enhanced protein-binding element TATTAG were widely evident (Supplementary Table S8); this finding indicated that Type-A BrRR genes might be transcriptionally regulated by Type-B BrRR proteins and cytokinin. Two ARR1-binding elements were found in some Type-A BrRR gene promoters; thus, we speculated that the TCS is conserved between Chinese cabbage and Arabidopsis at the level of system regulation, as well as gene structure.3.5. Expression profiles of TCS genes in various tissues, organs, and developmental stagesTissue- or organ-specific and developmental stage-related expression data are useful in identifying genes that are involved in defining the precise nature of individual tissues in a given developmental stage.92 A clear expression profile of genes of interest is an indispensable step to find and utilize agriculturally important genes. To obtain first insight into the functions of TCS genes during the Chinese cabbage vegetative and reproductive development, qRT-PCR was used to analyse the transcription levels of TCS genes in various tissues, organs, and developmental stages. Totally, only 31 of the 61 TCS genes that could be distinguished by qRT-PCR were selected for expression analysis because of the high similarities of the TCS sequences, and the remaining 9 BrHKL genes and 15 BrPRR genes were not within the scope of our study. Based on Fig. 6 and Supplementary Fig. S6, data analyses indicated high variability in transcript abundance of the TCS genes in Chinese cabbage. A majority of TCS genes showed relatively high expression levels in roots, such as BrHK3, BrHK4, BrHP1, BrPHP1, BrRR3, BrRR12, and BrRR31. This finding might be correlated with the fact that cytokinins are mainly synthesized in roots. Notably, BrRR17, BrRR7, BrRR3, BrRR12, BrHK9, BrHP7, and BrRR31 exhibited similar expression patterns and were grouped together. These genes were expressed abundantly in vegetative organs, floral buds, and developing siliques; however, these genes showed low transcripts in sepals, petals, and stamens; these findings indicated that they have spatio-temporal expression characters. BrRR19 had a relatively higher expression level in floral buds and four whirl flower organs; this finding suggests its function in flower development. Genes with high transcripts in developing siliques may have essential functions in seed quality and yield. We found that BrRR33 and BrRR38 were almost expressed exclusively in developing siliques, which demonstrates that they were candidate genes in improving seed quality and yield. To explore the expression patterns of the homologous genes between Chinese cabbage and Arabidopsis, gene expression data for Arabidopsis TCS genes were retrieved from the Genevestigator database (data not shown) and then we compared these data with our results. Most of the homologous genes showed similar expression patterns, suggesting the functional conservation of homologs. Comparisons of the tissue-specific expression profiles between Chinese cabbage and Arabidopsis TCS genes might help in determining the unknown functions of the TCS genes in Chinese cabbage. In Arabidopsis, AtCKI1 is mainly expressed in flowers and participated in female gametophyte development.94–96 Similarly, BrHK1, which is a AtCKI1 homologous gene, showed major transcriptions in flowers and pistils in Chinese cabbage. Similar expression profiles may suggest similar function for Arabidopsis orthologous TCS genes in Chinese cabbage. Based on the high sequence identity and similar expression patterns, we proposed that BrHK1 was also related to female gametophyte development in Chinese cabbage. Consistently, with a loss of function mutant line, Ito and Kurata38 revealed that OsHK1, which is a AtCKI1 homologous gene in rice, is essential for rice female gametophyte development. This result further strengthened our hypothesis and proved the conservation function of CKI1. Furthermore, AtAHK5/CKI2 is mainly expressed in roots97 and regulated salt sensitivity and resistance against bacterial and fungal infection98; in addition, AtAHK5/CKI2 acted to integrate multiple signals via H2O2 homeostasis and is independent of ABA signalling in guard cells.99 Two homologous genes, BrHK3 and BrHK4, were analysed in Chinese cabbage, and these genes also showed major transcriptions in roots. Thus, BrHK3 and BrHK4 were probably involved in stress adaptations in Chinese cabbage.

Expression profiles of TCS genes under drought and salt stresses in Chinese cabbage rootsIn addition to cytokinin signalling, accumulating evidence proves that TCS is also involved in plant adaptation to various environmental stresses. Relationships between cytokinin signalling and stress responses were summarized in several reviews.29,100–102 Roots were generally believed to be the main organs involved in drought and high salinity stresses, thus 26 of the 31 examined TCS genes that showed relatively high expression levels in Chinese cabbage roots were selected; in addition, qRT-PCR was used to analyse their expression profiles under drought and salt stress conditions. As shown in Fig. 7 and Supplementary Figs S7 and S8, most of the TCS genes, as a whole, were suppressed in drought conditions. In different degrees of drought symptoms, expressions of BrHK6, BrHK7, BrHK8, BrHP2–3, BrHP4, BrHP7, BrRR1, BrRR3, BrRR7, BrRR23, BrRR27, and BrRR30 were continually suppressed and decreased to ~15% of the control level. Transcripts of BrHK3, BrHK9, BrHP6, and BrRR8 were also primarily suppressed, which subsequently increased again after a fall in level <U+2161>; however, the transcriptions of these genes were still below the basal level in level III, which indicates that they were potential negative regulators in drought stress response. BrHP5, BrHP1, BrRR19, and BrRR31 were clustered into one group, and these genes showed upregulated expressions in levels II or III. BrHP1 was consistently induced; this finding suggests the positive roles of BrHP1 in drought stress. For the salt treatment, most of the TCS genes also showed decreased expression levels; however, the responses of these genes were not always the same with drought treatment. BrHK8 and BrRR27 seemed to be unaffected with salt treatment; however, these genes were continually suppressed in drought conditions. The transcript of BrPHP1, which is a pseudo-HP gene, was unaffected by drought treatment; BrPHP1 transcript was suppressed in high salinity conditions. BrRR8 was mainly induced with 2-fold upregulated expression levels after 48 h salt treatment; however, this gene was suppressed in drought treatment. Likewise, BrHP5, BrHP1, BrRR19, and BrRR31 were clustered together with increased expressions, suggesting their positive functions under high salinity conditions. BrRR19 and BrRR31 transcripts were stable 8 h after salt treatment; however, these genes were continually induced after 8 h and showed 3.4- and 2.0-fold increased expression levels at 48 h. Theoretically, almost all the TCS genes in Chinese cabbage could be induced by drought and salt stresses because of the presence of stress-inducible cis-regulatory elements in their promoter regions. However, our results conflicted with our hypothesis with most of the genes being supressed. Although cis-element can be used to predict stress-responsive genes via a cis-element-based targeted gene-finding approach;28 however, the frequency of a cis-element sequence in the whole genome is relatively high because of their short length (5–9 bp core) and flexibility. In addition, a number of cis-element sequences might be syntactically correct without providing practical regulatory function. Moreover, there are also stress-repressive genes among the TCS genes and we have limited knowledge on the stress-repressive cis-element.103 In fact, the patterns of responses to abiotic stress stimuli of the TCS genes were complicated and varied in terms of the species, genotypes, and organs or tissues. In Arabidopsis, drought significantly induced the expression of a Type-A ARR gene subset, ARR5, ARR7, and ARR15,104 whereas almost all genes for Type-A RR genes were suppressed by drought stress in rice.35 Moreover, all of the members of the TCS family had differential transcript abundance (under both non-stress and salinity stress conditions) among salt-tolerant (Pokkali) and salt-sensitive (IR64) rice genotypes.37 Furthermore, Argueso et al.101 collected data from BIO Array Resource and illustrated that TCS gene responsiveness to different abiotic stresses in Arabidopsis root and shoot tissues are different. Le et al.32 examined and compared the TCS gene expression profiles in root and shoot tissues of soybean plants under dehydration stress; in addition, Le et al. found that the majority of soybean TCS genes respond to dehydration stress in either root- or shoot-specific manner. This is also the case for the expression patterns of GmARFs in drought stress.105 So cis-element-based predicted genes should be validated experimentally to reveal their authentic expression profiles in specific tissues or organs upon various abiotic stress conditions. One of our interests is that whether genes located in the same clade of the plylogenetic tree would show similar response patterns to abotic stresses. Thus, we carefully examined and compared the expression patterns of TCS genes in Arabidopsis, rice, and soybean with our results. It was amazing that even the homologous TCS genes showed varied response patterns, suggesting the stress-responsive functional divergence of the homologous genes. In Arabidopsis, AHK2, AHK3, and CRE1 transcripts were all rapidly induced by dehydration; AHK2 expression also appeared to be influenced by NaCl and ABA treatments; and induction of the AHK3 mRNA was observed during high salinity and cold stresses, whereas expressions of CKI1 and CKI2 were not induced by any treatment.29 However, in rice, the HK genes (HK5 and HK3) that are homologous to CK receptor genes (AHK2, AHK3, and CRE1) in Arabidopsis were induced by drought stress, while HK6 homologous to CKI2 was repressed when exposed to drought stress.35 Likewise, the soybean HK genes (GmHK10–17) that are homologous to Arabidopsis CK receptor genes (AHK2, AHK3, and CRE1) showed more diverse response patterns, for example, GmHK11 was repressed while GmHK12 was induced under dehydration stress.28 Furthermore, response patterns unlikely correlated well with their biological functions under abiotic stress conditions. We have mentioned that transcripts of AHK2, AHK3, and CRE1 in Arabidopsis could be induced by abiotic stresses;29 however, loss-of-function analysis of ahk2, ahk3, and cre1 indicated that the stress-responsive AHK2, AHK3, and CRE1 acted as negative regulators in ABA signalling; in addition, AHK2 and AHK3 negatively control osmotic stress responses in Arabidopsis.29 Other supporting evidence was that AHK2 and AHK3 have negative regulatory functions in cold stress signalling, via ABA response inhibition; however, the transcripts of these genes were not altered by cold condition.36 The information regarding TCS gene identification would be more valuable if the functional predication is verified. For the TCS genes in Chinese cabbage, expression profiling is an initial step; further elucidating the potential functions of these genes involved in abiotic stress adaptations would be an interesting and meaningful study.

Effects of exogenous tZ and ABA on TCS gene expressions in Chinese cabbage leavesThe response patterns of TCS genes to exogenous cytokinin levels were carefully examined in Arabidopsis. Previous data based on Northern blot, microarray, and qRT-PCR analysis indicated that AHK, AHP, and Type-B ARR genes were not regulated by exogenous tZ and BA except for the upregulated AHK1 and AHK4; Type-A ARR genes, which function as the cytokinin primary response genes, are strongly induced upon treatment with cytokinins.106–109 To determine the effects of exogenous cytokinin on TCS gene expressions, we investigated the expression profiles of 23 of the 31 examined TCS genes with relatively high expression levels in Chinese cabbage leaves by qRT-PCR analyses (Fig. 8 and Supplementary Fig. S9). Spraying is a simple and easy method for treatment and also leaves response well to exogenous phytohormones. Our results revealed that the selected seven Type-A RR genes were transcriptionally upregulated by tZ. The inductions of these genes occurred in 30 min; the transcripts of such genes remained at high levels at 1, 2, and 4 h. Many BrHK, BrHP, and Type-B BrRR genes were primarily suppressed; afterward, their transcripts increased again and remained at the basal levels at 2 and 4 h. Considering that Type-A ARR genes negatively regulated HP and Type-B ARR gene transcriptions in Arabidopsis,93,110 we supposed that the instantly upregulated Type-A BrRR genes suppressed the BrHP and Type-B BrRR gene transcriptions; therefore, these events led to a negative feedback loop, thereby suppressing the expressions of putative cytokinin receptors (BrHK6–9) in Chinese cabbage; furthermore, autoregulations of these genes ensured transcript abundance as time progresses. ABA is the key hormone involved in the regulation of both stress- and non-stress-related processes.111,112 Furthermore, cytokinins are generally postulated to function as antagonists of ABA in various growth and physiological processes, including environmental stress responses. Studies have also suggested the presence of intensive interactions and crosstalk between cytokinins and ABA as well as their signalling pathways.100 Thus, we also examined the effects of exogenous ABA on TCS gene expressions in Chinese cabbage. Figure 9 and Supplementary Fig. S10 showed that many TCS genes were suppressed by ABA treatment; this finding was consistent with the response patterns of drought and salt treatment. BrHK9, BrRR3, and BrRR17 were strongly and instantly suppressed, and even dropped to undetectable levels after 30 min. BrHP4, BrHP7, BrRR28, and BrRR30 transcripts were relatively stable with ABA treatment. BrHP1, BrHP6, BrRR1, and BrRR32 were clustered together with increased expression levels upon ABA treatment. BrHP1 was also induced by drought and salt treatment; this result further confirms the positive regulations of BrHP1 in stress environments. However, similar to the case with drought and salt treatment, promoter regions of Chinese cabbage TCS genes were rich in cis-element involved in ABA response, such as MYBR, MYCR, and ABRE etc., many of the TCS genes were contrarily suppressed by ABA treatment, and these could be mainly attributed to the complex interactions of hormone network in addition to the own limitations of cis-element-based predicting approach.

ConclusionsIn summary, a total of 20 HK(L), 8 HP, and 57 RR proteins were identified and annotated in the Chinese cabbage genome. This study provided the first insight into the TCS members of Chinese cabbage. The analysis results of duplications, evolutionary patterns, and divergence of TCS genes gained useful information on the evolutionary aspects of Chinese cabbage genome. We also focused on the response patterns of the TCS genes to drought and high salinity conditions and screened numerous candidate stress-responsive genes in Chinese cabbage. TCS has an important function in signal transduction involved in plant growth, development, and environmental stimuli. Moreover, Chinese cabbage is one of the most important vegetables that are widely cultivated. Our results contributed relevant information to molecular genetic studies, thereby providing a better understanding of the biological functions of the TCS genes in Chinese cabbage. Our study may also provide guidance for molecular breeders to develop economically important high-yielding and high-quality stress-tolerant crops in agriculture.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis research was partially supported by the Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no.

IntroductionOver the last decade, technological developments have led to the generation of an unprecedented amount of genomic data for model organisms, providing basis for the discovery of their genes and understanding their genetics. The sequence of the first plant genome, from the dicot Arabidopsis thaliana, was completed and published at the end of 2000.1 This sequence has served as a common reference for gene annotation and comparative genomics.2,3 In particular, using the whole-genome sequence, information provided by the next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies (the new data are emerging from the 1001 Genomes Project launched in early 2008; http://1001genomes.org/) has dramatically increased the numbers of known genetic variants [up to several millions of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)] in this model plant. The monocot species Asian rice (Oryza sativa L.) is one of the most important cereal crops, feeding more than half of the global population, especially in Asian countries. The International Rice Genome Sequencing Project (IRGSP) deciphered the whole genome of the subspecies japonica cultivar Nipponbare in 2005, and released a map-based high-quality sequence covering >95% of its genome.4 This sequence has provided a foundation for our understanding of rice genome organization, including both genes and repetitive sequences, and accelerated functional genomic studies in rice. To date, ~700 rice genes controlling various morphological and physiological traits, including resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses, have been functionally characterized.5 With the Nipponbare sequence as a reference, genome re-sequencing of a large number of rice accessions has led to the discovery of millions of SNPs and insertion/deletion sites (indels), enabling genome-wide association studies (GWAS) aimed at identifying agronomically important genes in rice.6,7To meet the challenges deriving from rapid population growth and worldwide climate change, continuous efforts to increase rice production by using the genetic improvement technologies will be of great importance. One of the world's oldest crops (domesticated ~10 000 years ago), rice is traditionally classified into two major subspecies, indica and japonica.8–10 Owing to the deep genetic structure of rice evolved during domestication and adaptation and its autogamous breeding system, current O. sativa cultivars and landraces can be subdivided in more detail into five genetically differentiated groups: indica, aus, aromatic, temperate japonica, and tropical japonica.11 While the reference Nipponbare sequence is particularly useful for evolutionary and functional studies, its use for extensive analysis of genome diversity remains limited because of considerable inter- and intra-species and even intra-subspecies chromosomal rearrangements, such as insertions and deletions, duplications, inversions, translocations, and transpositions.12–15 Consistent with the above observations, the portion of uniquely mapped reads among the NGS short-read sequences from 50 cultivated and wild rice accessions against the Nipponbare reference genome varied greatly, from 73.0 to 93.0%, with the highest rate in temperate japonica accessions followed by tropical japonica, aromatic, aus, indica, and wild rice accessions.7 The power of GWAS for identifying rice genes depends greatly on the number and quality (high accuracy and even distribution along each rice chromosome) of SNPs, particularly when the analysis is conducted with germplasms collected within a subspecies or local populations.16,17 Moreover, the absence of some genes conferring tolerance to submergence or phosphorus deficiency from the Nipponbare genome caused by DNA insertions or deletions has been reported, strongly indicating that a single-reference genome is insufficient for discovery of novel genes or comprehensive transcriptome analysis through the RNA-Seq technology in rice.18–20 Because of the deep genetic structure in O. sativa, thereafter, new reference sequences from additional rice cultivars are needed, although chromosomal mapping and de novo assembly of the NGS reads are still challenging.21,22Rice cultivar Kasalath belongs to the indica subspecies or aus group of O. sativa, which has higher genome diversity than the japonica subspecies.11 Carrying a number of beneficial traits such as early maturity and tolerance to drought and phosphate deficiency, this cultivar, together with Nipponbare, has been particularly useful for developing a series of important genetic and genomic resources that have already contributed greatly to the molecular and functional analysis of rice chromosomes.12,18,23–29 In this study, we sequenced the whole genome of Kasalath rice by using two NGS platforms, Illumina (GAIIx and HiSeq2000) for short reads and Roche 454 (GS FLX Titanium and GS FLX+ Titanium) for long reads. We performed de novo assembly and chromosomal mapping of the NGS read sequences. In addition, we carried out the transcriptome analysis with RNA-Seq data obtained from young leaves and panicles of Kasalath by using the GAIIx for annotation of expressed sequences. Comparative analysis of the Kasalath sequence and those of other rice cultivars confirmed its value as a new reference genome to facilitate future evolutionary and functional genomic studies in rice.2. Materials and methods2.1. Library construction and genome re-sequencingTotal genomic DNA of Kasalath was extracted from young leaves of a single plant by using the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide method.30 We constructed DNA libraries with insert sizes of 800–1500 bp according to standard manufacturer's protocols (http://www.454.com/; Basel, Switzerland) to generate long-read sequences by using Roche 454 pyrosequencing technology (GS-FLX Titanium and GS-FLX+ platforms) as described previously.31 We also constructed libraries with insert sizes of 250–400 bp according to the manufacturer's instructions (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) to produce short single or paired-end reads on the Illumina GAIIx or HiSeq 2000 platforms.31 To facilitate annotation of the expressed sequences, we constructed cDNA libraries with insert sizes of 350–400 bp from total RNA samples prepared from the young leaves or young panicles of Kasalath, and used these libraries to generate short-read RNA-Seq data on the Illumina GAIIx instrument as described.322.2. Genome assemblyRaw sequence read data generated on both platforms were preprocessed to trim low-quality or adapter sequences on both ends as described previously.31 Sequencing errors in the Illumina data were corrected by String Graph Assembler (SGA) software v. 0.0.20 with ‘k-mer = 55’.33To construct the Kasalath pseudomolecules (Supplementary Fig. S1), we first performed de novo assembly of 454 reads into sequence contigs by using Celera Assembler v. 7.0 software with utgErrorRate = 0.015, ovlErrorRate = 0.03, cnsErrorRate = 0.05, cgwErrorRate = 0.05, utgGraphErrorRate = 0.015, utgMergeErrorRate = 0.02, and default values for other options. To improve sequence accuracy, we then mapped the error-corrected Illumina reads to the above contigs by Burrows–Wheeler Alignment (BWA) v. 0.6.2 software with the ‘-e 10’ option.34 With the mapped paired-end reads, we further refined the alignments around the indel sites by using Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK)35 software and discarded the putative polymerase chain reaction duplicates by using Picard software (http://picard.sourceforge.net/). Errors in each sequence contig were detected by calling variants using the SAMtools mpileup function with ‘-q 20 -Q 20’ options.36 Errors were corrected if the detected variants were homozygous with a quality score of =30, sequencing depth of =10, and frequency of =70%. This error correction procedure was performed twice to ensure sequencing accuracy. After again mapping the error-corrected Illumina reads to the error-corrected 454 contigs, we finally conducted a hybrid de novo assembly by merging the error-corrected 454 contigs with the unmapped Illumina reads by using SGA with ‘-m 75 -d 0.4 -g 0.1 -r 30’ options.2.3. Generation of Kasalath pseudomoleculesAll contigs of =500 bp were subjected to chromosomal mapping. First, we physically mapped their sequences to the Nipponbare reference genome (IRGSP 1.0)31 by using MUMmer v. 3.23 software (NUCmer) with default settings.37 We selected the optimal alignments by using delta-filter commands; the coordinates of each contig were displayed by using the show-coords command.37 All aligned contigs with values below the thresholds (90% nucleotide identity and 80% sequence coverage) were removed. If a contig was split into two or more fragments, we considered that it might correspond to genomic sites with large indels relative to the Nipponbare sequence. To determine the insertion sites, we used a fixed threshold of unaligned fragments of =100 bp with flanking sequences of =200 bp (Supplementary Fig. S2A). To determine the deletion sites, we used gapped alignments of 100–50 000 bp with flanking sequences of =200 bp (Supplementary Fig. S2B).38Bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-end sequences (BESs) from Kasalath were used to anchor the sequence contigs that could not be aligned to the Nipponbare genome by MUMmer. We mapped all Kasalath BESs (DDBJ accessions AG831174–AG909573; http://rgp.dna.affrc.go.jp/E/publicdata/kasalathendmap/index.html) onto the Kasalath contigs by BLASTN algorithm with ‘e-value 1.0e-5’ option.39 We selected the best positions with =90% nucleotide identity and =95% sequence coverage, and used only the uniquely aligned BESs for further analysis. We also mapped the Kasalath BESs to the Nipponbare genome sequence by selecting the best positions with =90% nucleotide identity and =90% sequence coverage, and retained only the pairs of BESs uniquely mapped at a distance of <300 kb on the Nipponbare genome. Unmapped Kasalath contigs were anchored onto the Nipponbare genome if they (i) contained uniquely aligned BESs mapped onto a Nipponbare genomic region where no Kasalath contigs have been assigned by MUMmer and (ii) had the mates of BESs aligned on a different contig already mapped on the Nipponbare sequence by MUMmer. Finally, we used the Illumina paired-end sequences to anchor the remaining Kasalath contigs to the Nipponbare sequence in the same manner as for the construction of chromosome pseudomolecules.2.4. Transcriptome analysisThe RNA-Seq reads of Kasalath were mapped onto its pseudomolecules by Tophat v. 2.0.8b software with the ‘-min-intron-length 67 --max-intron-length 3608’ options.40 The thresholds for the intron length corresponded to the 1st and 99th percentiles of the distribution of intron length, as retrieved from the annotations in the Rice Annotation Project (RAP) database.41 In addition, we set the ‘-G’ option on the basis of the intron/exon structures in the pseudomolecules converted from the Nipponbare genome annotated by the RAP. Gene structures predicted by Cufflinks v. 2.1.1 software individually for the young leaves and young panicles were merged by Cuffmerge software.42 DNA sequences of predicted transcripts were mapped onto the Nipponbare genome or proteome41 sequences by the BLASTN algorithm and est2genome tool43,44 with thresholds of =90% nucleotide identity and =70% sequence coverage.2.5. Detection of SNPs and indels among rice cultivarsPseudomolecule sequences were compared among japonica rice Nipponbare (IRGSP 1.0, http://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/), indica rice 93-11 (http://rise2.genomics.org.cn/page/rice/index.jsp), and aus rice Kasalath by using the MUMmer program to detect the existence of SNPs and indels. To ensure that large indels (=100 bp) between any two cultivars were not due to misassembled contigs, we mapped all Illumina reads of the Kasalath genome to its pseudomolecule sequences by using BWA to confirm that the boundaries of the insertions (Supplementary Fig. S2A) and deletions (Supplementary Fig. S2B) were covered by at least five overlapping reads stepped over by their paired sequences. Each SNP and indel was annotated by SnpEff (http://snpeff.sourceforge.net/index.html) to predict the effects of variants on genes.2.6. Chromosomal mapping of the publicly available short-read sequences by using multiple rice pseudomoleculesPublicly available sequence data generated by the Illumina GAII instruments from 50 accessions of cultivated and wild rice at ~15× coverage were downloaded from the NCBI Short Read Archive (accession number SRA023116).7 By using BWA,34 we aligned these sequences to the pseudomolecule sequences of Nipponbare, Kasalath, and 93-11 to examine the efficiency of chromosomal mapping. By using TASUKE, a web-based application developed recently for visualization of large-scale re-sequencing data,45 we constructed a genome viewer to display the sequences of and the structural variations among the above rice accessions with reference to the genomic sequence of Kasalath instead of Nipponbare.3. Results and discussion3.1. Kasalath pseudomolecules constructed from 330.55 Mb of sequencesBy performing de novo assembly of 2.49 Gb of sequences (>6× coverage) generated by Roche 454 (1.73 Gb from GS-FLX Titanium with an average read length of 386.1 bp, and 0.76 Gb from GS-FLX+ with an average read length of 593.8 bp) with Celera Assembler, we created 109 362 contigs containing 296.3 Mb with an N50 length (minimum length of contigs representing 50% of the assembly) of 3.2 kb. To increase coverage and accuracy of genomic sequences, we additionally generated a total of 57.47 Gb of Kasalath sequences (>148× coverage) by using Illumina GAIIx and HiSeq2000. On the basis of trimmed and error-corrected Illumina sequences, we corrected the sequencing errors within all contigs initially assembled from the Roche 454 reads. Finally, we conducted the hybrid de novo assembly by using all of the above-sequence data from both Illumina and Roche 454, which produced 51 550 contigs containing a total of 330.55 Mb non-overlapping sequences, which corresponds to 88.6% of the published Nipponbare sequence (373.25 Mb) (Table 1). Approximately 72% (36 932) of these Kasalath contigs, corresponding to 87.7% (289.80 Mb) of the total assembled sequences, were successfully anchored to the 12 chromosomes (Supplementary Table S1), covering 292.49 Mb of the Nipponbare reference genome. The total length (35 914 803 bp) of Kasalath contigs anchored on chromosome 1 by the hybrid de novo assembly was longer than that (32 835 386 bp) achieved only by single-reference (Nipponbare) mapping using BWA (details not shown). By using the MUMmer alignment software, we mapped the above two sequences to a BAC-based genomic sequence (41.37 Mb) of Kasalath chromosome 112 (=99% nucleotide identity), which revealed chromosome coverage of 82.3 and 73.0%, respectively. Therefore, our assembly of NGS reads can link genomic sequences to the Kasalath chromosomal regions, which is not possible by using reference mapping only. Such chromosomal regions could be cultivar-specific; these differences may be caused by the insertions or deletions of DNA segments, and in some cases they might be of great importance for the maintenance and use of rice genetic resources. For example, recent cloning and functional analysis of a major quantitative trait locus for phosphorus-deficiency tolerance (Pup1) in rice placed this gene within a chromosomal region of ~90 kb on Kasalath chromosome 11, which was absent in the Nipponbare genome.18 In our present study, a total of 18 contigs (60.25 kb) were successfully assembled from the above genomic region of Kasalath, which fully covered the Pup1-specific protein kinase gene (PSTOL1).

Genome-wide diversity among Kasalath, Nipponbare, and 93-11Sequence alignment by MUMmer revealed SNPs at 2 787 250 nucleotide sites between Kasalath and Nipponbare (alignment length of 278.75 Mb) and 2 216 251 nucleotide sites between Kasalath and 93-11 (alignment length of 259.00 Mb) (Table 2). Thus, the SNP frequency was 1.00% between aus and japonica and 0.86% between aus and indica, consistent with the genetic structure of O. sativa reported so far.8–11 Kasalath and 93-11 shared 1 378 591 common SNPs in comparison with the Nipponbare genome, which provides useful genomic resources for future studies of domestication and subspeciation of Asian cultivated rice. The SNPs present only between Kasalath and 93-11, two closely related cultivars, offer great potential for the discovery of naturally occurring mutations that might be associated with recent phenotypic changes that appeared during local adaptation after the divergence of japonica and indica. Statistics of SNPs and indels detected between Kasalath, Nipponbare, and 93-11 genomesStatistics of SNPs and indels detected between Kasalath, Nipponbare, and 93-11 genomesThis genomic information should help to explain in-depth the molecular mechanisms underlying not only the evolution, but also the functions of rice genomes. A total of 37 869 genes have been annotated in the Nipponbare genome.41 We found that most of the SNPs resided in non-genic regions. Only 5.1% (142 366) of the total SNPs detected between Nipponbare and Kasalath were located within protein-coding regions (Fig. 1). SNPs creating premature stop codons (nonsense mutations) or altering splice-site motifs can be expected to cause harmful effects on gene and protein function and eventually loss of function. We examined SNP presence and locations within 26 132 genes with sequences fully aligned between the Nipponbare and Kasalath genomes, and discovered that 902 genes had premature stop codons or splice-site motifs altered; of these, 33 seemed to have been pseudogenized in Kasalath. To compare the expression of the genes with and without harmful SNPs in the two cultivars, we carried out whole-transcriptome analysis in Nipponbare and Kasalath by using the RNA-Seq data for young leaves and young panicles. The fraction of genes specifically expressed in Nipponbare was significantly higher among the genes carrying harmful SNPs than among the genes without such SNPs (P < 10-9), suggesting that genes with harmful mutations are subject to pseudogenization. Distribution pattern of SNPs detected between the genomes of Nipponbare and Kasalath cultivars.Distribution pattern of SNPs detected between the genomes of Nipponbare and Kasalath cultivars.Furthermore, we detected large indels at 7393 genomic sites between Kasalath and Nipponbare (100–38 041 bp; average length 1999 bp) and at 3780 genomic sites between Kasalath and 93-11 (100–15 333 bp; average length 735 bp) (Table 2), corresponding to large indel frequency of 0.003% (aus–japonica) and 0.001% (aus–indica). The total amount of indel nucleotides (completed sequences) in Kasalath relative to Nipponbare was 14.78 Mb (5026 deletions, 13.49 Mb; 2367 insertions, 1.29 Mb); much fewer indel sites were observed in Kasalath relative to 93-11 (2244 deletions, 1.84 Mb; 1,536 insertions, 0.94 Mb). We detected many more chromosomal sites for deletions than for insertions, probably owing to inefficiencies of de novo assembly of NGS short reads and chromosomal mapping of assembled contigs, especially for the genomic regions carrying recently duplicated segments or highly repetitive sequences. When we took into account the insertions containing partially assembled sequences, the total length of inserted sequences in Kasalath increased to 7.39 Mb, which, however, was still much less than that of the deleted sequences (13.49 Mb). These findings imply that the genome of Kasalath (estimated size of 363 Mb) is slightly smaller than that of Nipponbare (384–387 Mb).31 The distribution pattern of deletion sizes in Kasalath against Nipponbare displayed two peaks if deletions of <1 kb were ignored (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. S2). The first and the largest peak appeared at 4 kb (3–5 kb), in which 58.5% of nucleotides were from repetitive sequences. The second peak was at 12–13 kb (11–14 kb), in which up to 62.7% of the nucleotides were from repetitive sequences. These data reveal the involvement of transposable elements, particularly those from the long-terminal-repeat retrotransposon families.15Size distribution and sequence classification of large deletions in Kasalath in comparison with Nipponbare.Size distribution and sequence classification of large deletions in Kasalath in comparison with Nipponbare.3.3. Gain and loss of genes in Kasalath, Nipponbare, and 93-11About 72.0% of the Nipponbare chromosomal sites (67.6 Mb) uncovered by Kasalath pseudomolecules were masked as repetitive sequences. Clearly, up to 89.0% of the transcript sequences of Nipponbare were rescued by the assembled contigs of Kasalath (Fig. 3). This result indicates that most of the genic regions in Kasalath were captured through our re-sequencing and genome assembly. However, we still found that 6.3% (2828) of the total transcripts (44 536, including alternative variants) annotated in Nipponbare were likely absent in Kasalath (exon coverage <5%). To clarify whether these missing transcripts represented real changes of gene content between these cultivars, we examined the gene coverage by aligning the 93-11 genome (indica) to the Nipponbare reference genome. Interestingly, a similar number of the Nipponbare transcripts (2904) were likely missing in the 93-11 genome, of which 1278 were also absent in Kasalath (aus). These results clearly indicate that at least 3.1% of the genes in the japonica cultivar Nipponbare (1174 of 37 869 genes, excluding alternative variants) lack orthologs in indica and aus cultivars, mainly because of insertions or deletions. The frequency of the Nipponbare genes absent in Kasalath or 93-11 seemed to vary among the 12 chromosomes; chromosome 3 had the lowest value of 7.6 genes absent per Mb (Supplementary Fig. S3). As expected, an extremely high frequency (21.6 genes absent per Mb) was observed on chromosomes 11 and 12, which are characterized by recent generation of gene copies by tandem gene amplification and segmental duplication in the Nipponbare genome.46 Since these two chromosomes are known to carry the genes for agronomically important traits (such as resistance to blast, bacterial blight, viruses, and insects; photoperiod-sensitive male sterility; and salt tolerance),47 our comparison of the genomic sequences of different rice cultivars should provide fundamental information useful for our understanding of the evolution and function of these genes to the benefit of future molecular breeding programmes.

The horizontal axis represents the sequence coverage (×100%) of each gene annotated on Nipponbare pseudomolecules.We obtained 2.3 Gb of the RNA-Seq reads from young leaves of Kasalath and 2.9 Gb from young panicles. This enabled us to perform whole-transcriptome analysis of the aus rice genome. By mapping these two datasets to Kasalath pseudomolecule sequences (all assembled sequences), we annotated 55 188 transcripts comprising 35 139 loci (Supplementary Fig. S4). To estimate the gain of genes in aus rice in comparison with japonica rice, we aligned all Kasalath transcript sequences to the Nipponbare pseudomolecules or protein sequences from the proteome database.41 A total of 2664 transcripts remained unmapped (<90% nucleotide identity and <70% sequence coverage); of these, 1226 unique to Kasalath (<50% sequence coverage). Of the 1226 transcripts, the translated sequences of 789 matched 535 known proteins. Analysis of the functional protein domains encoded by these transcripts revealed that protein kinases and disease resistance-related proteins were over-represented (Table 3), supporting the previous results of comparative genome analysis of Asian cultivated rice.48Top 10 over-represented functional domains in the genes found in Kasalath but not in NipponbareTop 10 over-represented functional domains in the genes found in Kasalath but not in Nipponbare3.4. Chromosomal mapping of publicly available NGS short reads from 50 rice accessions to multiple reference sequencesThe map-based, high-quality sequence of Nipponbare has been typically used as a reference for not only comparative, but also functional genomics.6,7,49–51 In the present study, comparative analysis of genomic sequences of Kasalath, Nipponbare, and 93-11 led to the discovery of cultivar-specific sequences; some were associated with genes of agronomic importance such as Pup1 in the Kasalath genome. About 7.39 Mb of inserted sequences were detected in Kasalath relative to Nipponbare, and 40.75 Mb of Kasalath sequences still remained unmapped to its chromosomes. This result emphasizes the necessity and importance of using pseudomolecule sequences as additional references for comparative genomic studies in rice to understand comprehensively its genome diversity, particularly among the cultivars of the indica subspecies and aus-type cultivars. We mapped the publicly available Illumina short reads derived from 50 diverse landraces and wild rice accessions7 to the pseudomolecule sequences of Kasalath, Nipponbare, and 93-11 (Supplementary Table S2). The mapping rate of unique reads (uniquely mapped reads/total reads × 100%) varied widely between the accessions, from 62.3 to 84.8% (Fig. 4). As expected, more sequence reads from the aus and indica varieties were mapped to the Kasalath and 93-11 genomes than to the Nipponbare genome, except for one tropical japonica accession (IRGC43397), which might have been previously misgrouped by phylogenetic analysis or its genomic DNA used for genotyping and sequencing was mislabelled. On the other hand, the mapping rates were low for all accessions when the 93-11 pseudomolecule sequence was used as a reference. This result indicates certain limitations in using the current 93-11 sequence for extensive comparative genomic studies in rice, probably because of its lower accuracy or poorer quality of sequence assembly than those of the Nipponbare and Kasalath pseudomolecules. A recent study has been performed to improve sequence quality and chromosome coverage by re-sequencing the 93-11 genome up to 36-fold depth.49 Detailed data on the gene annotation and the sequence and structural variations among the 50 rice accessions obtained in the present study by using the Kasalath pseudomolecules as a reference are accessible through our genome viewer (http://rice50ks.dna.affrc.go.jp/) developed on the basis of the TASUKE program (Supplementary Fig. S4).45Rate of uniquely mapped NGS reads from 50 rice accessions by using Nipponbare, Kasalath, and 93-11 pseudomolecule sequences as references.

ConclusionsIn this study, we performed deep sequencing (>154-fold coverage) by using NGS technologies and de novo assembly of the whole genome of the aus rice cultivar ‘Kasalath’. The assembled sequences cover 91.1% of the whole genome and 89.0% of the transcribed regions annotated on the basis of the reference Nipponbare genome. Besides millions of SNPs, comparative genomics revealed genome-wide sequence and structural variations, including thousands of large indels associated with the gain or loss of genes, between japonica, indica, and aus-type rice cultivars. Chromosomal mapping of the publicly available NGS reads from 50 rice accessions to Kasalath pseudomolecules demonstrated that its genomic sequence should be extremely useful as a new reference for future comparative genomic studies, particularly for capturing the sequence polymorphisms that could not be obtained by using the Nipponbare pseudomolecule sequences alone.Accession numbersThe genomic and RNA-seq sequences of Kasalath rice reported in this paper have been deposited in the DDBJ database with accession numbers DRA000968 and DRA001099.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by grants from the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Japan (Genomics for Agricultural Innovation, QTL5003 and GIR1001; Development of Genome Information Database System for Innovation of Crop and Livestock Production) and from the MEXT-Supported Program for the Strategic Research Foundation at Private Universities (S0801025).We thank Junichi Yonemaru, Hiroshi Ikawa, Takayuki Yazawa, and Ryutaro Itoh for useful scientific discussions and assistance with sequence datasets.Supplementary data"

IntroductionThe centromere is the part of the chromosome to which spindle fibres attach via the kinetochore, and it serves as the forefront of chromosome migration during cell division. The main DNA components of centromeres are usually tandemly repeated sequences, and the most abundant sequence in primate centromeres is alpha-satellite DNA (AS), which has basic repeat units of ~170 bp in length.1,2 Human AS has been classified into two types according to the organization and nucleotide sequence properties of its repeat units.3,4 One is monomeric AS, which is a simple repetition of the basic repeat units. The other is higher-order AS, whose sequence is organized into a higher-order repeat (HOR) structure, in which a block of multiple basic repeat units forms a larger repeat unit. In a typical HOR structure, any combination of two basic repeat units within the larger repeat unit shows nucleotide sequence identities of 70–90%, whereas the identity often exceeds 95% between a basic repeat unit and its counterpart (located at the same position) in another larger unit. Higher-order AS is known to be present in all normal human centromeres,4 to occupy central portions of centromeres (whereas monomeric AS is found mostly in peripheral regions),5 and to be more important than monomeric AS in centromere function.3,4,6 It is unclear, however, what aspects of higher-order AS are associated with these facts. One approach to identifying these associations would be to clarify the history of higher-order AS, including its evolutionary origin and expansion. The present study addresses the evolutionary origin of higher-order AS.Humans (genus Homo) are included in hominids (family Hominidae), along with chimpanzees (genus Pan), gorillas (genus Gorilla), and other great apes. Small apes (gibbons) are not included in hominids and form another taxon (family Hylobatidae). Collectively, organisms included in these two families are called hominoids (superfamily Hominoidea). All hominids examined to date carry higher-order AS.7,8 In small apes, however, AS of this type had not been found until we recently reported one in the siamang (Sympha-langus syndactylus).9Although the HOR structure observed in siamang AS was clear (HOR units consisting of four or six basic repeat units), there remained two unresolved questions: (i) whether HOR structures are common among small apes or are limited to the siamang and (ii) whether AS residing in the centromere (without migrating to another chromosomal position) exhibits HOR structures or if HOR is limited to non-centromeric AS in small apes. The second question arose because of the fact that the siamang carries AS in terminal regions of chromosomes as large blocks of constitutive heterochromatin as well as centromeres.10 The function and formation processes of these heterochromatin blocks are not yet clear. Similar structures have also been observed in chromosomes of chimpanzees and gorillas. However, their DNA component is not AS, but is an unrelated tandem repeat sequence (called the StSat sequence) comprising 32-bp repeat units.11,12 In the present study, we obtained results that can be used to answer the two questions described above. Our results indicate that higher-order AS widely occurs in hominoids.Structures of tandem repeat sequences are difficult to accurately determine using data from whole-genome shotgun sequencing or next-generation sequencing, because of difficulty in assembling sequence reads into contigs. Primer walking on a cloned DNA fragment is also inadequate because of the presence of multiple primer annealing sites in the clone. In fact, centromere regions are left as large gaps even in the human genome database.13,14 To overcome this problem, we used a traditional method consisting of cloning long genomic DNA fragments, preparation of deletion clones, and sequencing end regions of these clones. There was, however, another problem to be solved before sequencing analyses: which clones should be sequenced? Our idea was to detect signs of HOR structures by comparing sequences of two different regions within a clone. For this purpose, we used the transposition reaction of a bacterial transposon, which provided AS sequences with unique sites for annealing by sequencing primers. Below, we describe our methods, results, and their significance with regard to the evolutionary origin of higher-order AS.2. Materials and methods2.1. Animals for collection of genomic DNAIn the latest taxonomy of small apes, the family Hylobatidae consists of four genera: Hoolock, Hylobates, Nomascus, and Symphalangus.15,16 A species of the genus Symphalangus (S. syndactylus) has been examined in a previous study.10 In the present study, we focused on the other three genera. The species and the origin of the individuals that served as DNA sources were as follows: the Western hoolock gibbon (Hoolock hoolock), an adult female (named Faisal) bred at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Safari Park, Bangladesh; the agile gibbon (Hylobates agilis), an adult male (named Raja) bred at the Primate Research Institute of Kyoto University; and the Southern white-cheeked gibbon (Nomascus siki), an adult female (identification number 001064376) bred at Khao Kheow Forest and Wildlife Park, Thailand.2.2. Preparation of genomic librariesWe collected genomic DNA from white blood cells by following a standard method. A genomic library of each species was constructed, following a previously described protocol.10,17 The vector was an 8.1-kb fosmid pCC1FOS, and the inserts were 40- to 44-kb genomic DNA fragments that were generated by mechanical shearing and isolated by gel electrophoresis and subsequent recovery from a gel piece. Identification of AS-containing sequences from these libraries is described in the Results section together with strategies and results.2.3. DNA sequencingWe performed subcloning of a part of the fosmid clones, preparation of a series of deletion clones from the subclone plasmids and sequenced the deletion clones by using the M13 universal primer. The details of our strategy are described in the Results section along with the results. The sequencing method used was Sanger's method, which involved using an Applied Biosystems 3730xl DNA Analyzer.2.4. Fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis of chromosomesWe performed fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis following the procedures described previously.10 Specific conditions are explained in each case.3. Results3.1. Collection of genomic DNA clones containing repetitive sequencesWe screened the genomic libraries of the three gibbon species for repetitive sequences by the genomic hybridization method described previously.10,17 In this screening, the target of the hybridization was fosmid clones randomly selected from the library and fixed on nylon membranes. The probe was genomic DNA (fragmented by mechanical shearing in advance) of the same species as that of the target DNA. For example, fragmented genomic DNA of Hoolock hoolock was chemically labelled and used as probe in the hybridization assay for Hoolock hoolock fosmid clones. If a fosmid carries repetitive DNA (such as AS) as its insert, the same sequence occupies a large fraction of the probe DNA. A large number of labelled DNA fragments anneal to this fosmid, and the fosmid produces an intense signal. If a fosmid clone carries a single-copy region, the same sequence is present at a low frequency in the labelled DNA, and the fosmid displays a weak (or even undetectable) signal. A big advantage of this method is that any repetitive sequences are identified irrespective of their nucleotide sequences (even if the sequences are unknown), with more chances of identification (stronger signals and larger numbers of signals) for sequences of higher copy numbers.18 For each species, we screened 384 fosmid clones (four membranes corresponding to four 96-well plates) and picked up 12 clones exhibiting the highest level of signal intensities.3.2. Selection of AS-containing clonesWe sequenced one end of the clones obtained by genomic hybridization and selected clones whose sequence reads showed tandem repeat structures with unit sizes between 100 and 200 bp (the size of the basic repeat units of AS is uniform among hominoids at ~170 bp and is included in this range). Of the 12 Hoolock, 12 Hylobates, and 12 Nomascus clones, 4, 9, and 6 clones, respectively, met this criterion. Sequence reads from all of these clones exhibited >70% nucleotide identity with the consensus sequence of human AS and with that of siamang AS.103.3. Detection of signs of HORWe first tried to detect HOR signs by comparing the sequences of two terminal regions (~900 bp each), which we had successfully carried out in the case of Symphalangus in our previous study.9 This test resulted in an HOR sign in one (HylFos15) of the clones from Hylobates (data not shown). The test, however, did not give a positive result in any of the four clones from Hoolock or six clones from Nomascus, suggesting that, even if these clones contain an HOR structure, its scale (the number of basic repeat units constituting an HOR unit) is larger than that found in Symphalangus. We developed another method to obtain longer sequences, with the expectation that longer sequences would increase the possibility of detecting signs. The strategy used for this purpose is shown in Fig. 1. We prepared a clone of the Tn5 transposon that carried the kanamycin-resistance gene. We mixed it with an AS-containing genomic DNA clone and induced the transposition reaction by supplying the Tn5 transposase enzyme. The fosmid vector (pCC1FOS) for the genomic DNA clone carried the chloramphenicol-resistance gene. After the transposition reaction, the reaction mixture was introduced into bacterial cells by electroporation, and single colonies that survived on LB/agar plates containing chloramphenicol (5 µg/ml) and kanamycin (5 µg/ml) were selected. Fosmid DNA extracted from these colonies mostly carried a single Tn5 insertion at different positions. We sequenced two of these clones by using sequencing primers that annealed to the left or right terminal regions of Tn5 and were oriented outward. Strategy for the detection of HOR signs. Transposition of the Tn5 transposon to DNA molecules of an AS-containing fosmid clone was induced, and two clones carrying Tn5 at different positions were selected. Each clone was sequenced using two primers that annealed to Tn5 and oriented outward. The sequence reads (~900 bp, including the tail region of a low reliability) were combined, and a longer sequence (~1800 bp) was obtained. These sequences were compared between the two clones by the dot-matrix analysis. When a line spanning more than two basic units was found, it was regarded as a sign of HOR.Strategy for the detection of HOR signs.

These sequences were compared between the two clones by the dot-matrix analysis. When a line spanning more than two basic units was found, it was regarded as a sign of HOR.Each sequence read contained data for >855 (5 × 171) nucleotides. Although the tail region of the sequence read (distant by >700 nucleotides from the sequencing primer) had quite a high possibility of containing sequencing errors, this was not a problem for our purpose because the data were used for detecting signs of HOR, but sequencing errors masked such signs. By combining the sequence reads for both sides of a single Tn5 insertion, we could obtain nucleotide sequence information for a region of >1710 (10 × 171) nucleotides, and it contained sequence information for at least nine consecutive repeat units.In each clone, we compared two sets of such sequences by dot-matrix analysis. When a line spanning more than two repeat units was found in the dot matrix, we regarded it as a sign of an HOR. The detection efficiency of this method depends on the scale of the HOR to be revealed, namely, how many (designated as n hereafter) basic repeat units constitute the HOR. For HORs with n = 16, our method is expected to be powerful enough to detect a sign with only two sets of sequence data. For n = 17, the probability of detecting a sign with two sets of sequence data is 15/n. The value of the probability is as large as 0.5 for n = 30 and 0.375 for n = 40. If we use sequence data of additional insertion points, we can increase the probability.We examined the AS-containing fosmid clones by the transposition assay and subsequent sequencing analysis. Of the four Hoolock and six Nomascus clones, one and three clones, respectively, exhibited signs of HOR. Figure 2 shows examples of the results of this dot-matrix analysis. We selected one clone each (clones HooFos09 of Hoolock and NomFos1B3 of Nomascus) and moved on to determining the long sequences of the AS arrays contained in these two clones, and also the clone HylFos15 from Hylobates. Dot-matrix analysis of clone partial sequences for signs of HOR. The criterion in the dot-matrix analysis was that a 19-nucleotide match should exist over a window of 20 nucleotides. Examples of the results are shown. HooFos09 and NomFos1B3 exhibited a line spanning more than two basic repeat units, and HooFos03 and NomFos3F5 did not.Dot-matrix analysis of clone partial sequences for signs of HOR.

HooFos09 and NomFos1B3 exhibited a line spanning more than two basic repeat units, and HooFos03 and NomFos3F5 did not.3.4. Transfer of fragments to plasmidAs explained earlier, sequencing strategies relying on shotgun segmentation or primer walking are not adequate for tandemly repeated sequences, such as AS. The strategy we employed was preparation of a series of deletion clones by using exonuclease III and Mung bean nuclease.19 By digesting the DNA fragment with an appropriate combination of restriction endonucleases (KpnI whose 3'-protruding cutting site is resistant to the exonuclease, and BamHI or SalI whose 5'-protruding cutting sites are sensitive), the deletion starts at one end of the fragment and continues to various degrees. The maximum fragment size for which these treatments work smoothly is ~16 kb. The size of the fosmid clones was 40–44 kb. Therefore, it was necessary to transfer part of the fosmid clones into a plasmid vector. For delimiting the part to be analysed, PCR was not adequate because of the repetitive nature of the object sequence.Restriction endonuclease NotI recognizes an eight-nucleotide segment (GCGGCCGC), which rarely appears even in the insert size of the fosmid vector. The vector carried two NotI recognition sites located closely to its cloning site, and we manipulated the Tn5 transposon in advance to have an NotI site in it. These NotI sites enabled us to determine the position of the Tn5 insertion by cutting Tn5-carrying fosmid DNAs and running an electrophoresis gel. We checked 12 Tn5-carrying clones originating from the HooFos09, HylFos15, and NomFos1B3 clones, and selected one in which Tn5 had been inserted at a position 10–16 kb distant from one end of its AS array. We then subcloned the NotI-delimited DNA fragment into the NotI site of an ampicillin-resistant plasmid (pBluescript II SK+), and subsequently transferred the fragment to a chloramphenicol-resistant plasmid (originating from pHSG399) to which we had, in advance, added some restriction enzyme sites necessary for the preparation of deletion clones. We used the ampicillin-resistant plasmid because transfer of a long fragment from a chloramphenicol-resistant vector to another chloramphenicol-resistant vector becomes easier by using an intermediate vector carrying a resistance gene to a different antibiotic (ampicillin in this case). The plasmid clones carrying the AS fragments from the HooFos09, HylFos15, and NomFos1B3 clones are designated HooCam09, HylCam15, and NomCam1B3, respectively.3.5. Sequencing analysisWe prepared deletion clones of various lengths by treating HooCam09, HylCam15, and NomCam1B3 with exonuclease III and then with Mung bean nuclease. We checked the insert size of these deletion clones, arranged them in the order of longest to shortest, and selected 55, 28, and 41 clones, respectively, to be used as sources of partial sequences. The criterion for this selection was any two adjacent clones that did not differ in insert size by >0.5 kb. Figure 3 shows an example of gel electrophoresis in which clones of 5.3–0.5 kb were placed according to their sizes. We sequenced the selected clones by using the M13 universal primer. We then manually assembled the obtained sequence reads into a contig sequence. Confirmation of deletion clone insert size. Deletion clones of various sizes were prepared from the HooCam09 and NomCam1B3 clones. Out of these pools, clones of sizes adequate for sequencing analysis were selected. This photograph is an example of gel electrophoresis in which deletion clones of insert sizes of 5.3–0.5 kb, originating from HooCam09, are contained. The 2.1-kb vector plasmid carried two cutting sites for restriction endonuclease XhoI just outside of the cloning site, and the insert fragments in the original clones did not have a site for this enzyme. Each deletion clone was digested with XhoI and divided into two fragments: the 2.1-kb plasmid vector and its insert fragment.Confirmation of deletion clone insert size.

Evidence for HORsWe obtained a 16 429-bp contig sequence for the HooCam09 clone, a 7828-bp contig sequence for the HylCam15 clone, and a 12 093-bp contig sequence for the NomCam1B3 clone. These were deposited in DDBJ with accession numbers AB861929, AB900117, and AB846956, respectively. We defined the boundaries and orientation of the basic repeat unit, so that they would be the same as those used in our previous studies.10,20 The three clones contained 95, 44, and 70 basic repeat units, respectively.We made pairwise comparisons between basic repeat units, and the essence of the obtained results is shown as matrices in Fig. 4. In the matrices, red and yellow cells indicate identities of >95 and 90–95%, respectively. Matrices containing the nucleotide identity of each cell are shown in Supplementary Figs S1–S3. In HooCam09 and NomCam1B3, clear step-like lines consisting of red cells appeared with a constant interval throughout the sequence. The interval was 31 basic repeat units for HooCam09 and 9 basic repeat units for NomCam1B3. HylCam15 showed step-like lines exhibiting two types of intervals (8-unit interval for units 5–12 and 13-unit interval for units 13–44). Thus, it is evident that the AS sequences contained in these clones are organized into HOR structures. Pairwise comparisons of basic repeat unit sequences. The comparisons were made using the MEGA5 program21 under default settings. The horizontal and vertical axes of each matrix represent consecutive basic repeat units contained in the AS contig sequence. Cells showing nucleotide identities of 90–95 and >95% are indicated by yellow and red, respectively. The same matrices containing the identity values in the cells are shown in Supplementary Figs S1–S3.Pairwise comparisons of basic repeat unit sequences. The comparisons were made using the MEGA5 program21 under default settings. The horizontal and vertical axes of each matrix represent consecutive basic repeat units contained in the AS contig sequence. Cells showing nucleotide identities of 90–95 and >95% are indicated by yellow and red, respectively. The same matrices containing the identity values in the cells are shown in Supplementary Figs S1–S3.From the matrices shown in Fig. 4, we picked up cells that represented pairs of basic units located at identical positions in different HOR units (e.g. the second basic repeat unit in the third HOR unit and the second basic repeat unit in the fourth HOR unit). In the HooCam09 clone, the average pairwise nucleotide identity among these pairs was 99.8%. The average value among the pairs of the other relationships was 89.2%. In the NomCam1B3 clone, the values were 98.6 and 88.0%, respectively. In the analysis of the HylCam15 clone, in which the 13th–44th basic repeat units (exhibiting a 13-unit interval) were used, we obtained the values of 97.0 and 86.5%, respectively. These situations are similar to those observed in human AS sequences: 95–99 and 70–90%, respectively.223.7. Chromosomal locationsWe conducted FISH analysis of chromosomes, by using HooCam09, HylCam15, and NomCam1B3 as probes, to identify chromosomal locations (Fig. 5). HooCam09 exhibited strong signals on the centromere region of chromosome 4 of Hoolock hoolock chromosome spreads. HylCam15 produced signals in the centromere regions of all Hylobates agilis chromosomes. NomCam1B3 showed clear signals on the centromere regions and terminal regions of most chromosomes of Nomascus siki. These results are consistent with the FISH results we obtained previously by using a clone of siamang AS as a probe.20FISH analysis of chromosomes for locations of AS. The left panels show FISH images obtained using a fluorescence scanner, and the right panels are images of the same chromosome spreads stained with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). In the left panels, red signals indicate hybridization of the probe DNA to chromosome DNA. The combination of chromosome spread and probe is shown on each left panel. The bar in the panels represents 10 µm. All experimental procedures were the same as those described in our previous work.10FISH analysis of chromosomes for locations of AS.

Comparison of AS sequences among hominoid speciesWe made within-species consensus sequences of AS repeat units of Hoolock hoolock, Hylobates agilis, and Nomascus siki. Furthermore, from references, we obtained consensus sequence for Nomascus leucogenys, S. syndactylus, human, and orangutan. We then made a neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree of these consensus sequences, which is shown in Fig. 6. The five gibbon species representing four genera formed a cluster distinct from that of the two hominid species, and the two Nomascus species formed an internal cluster within the gibbon cluster.

The consensus sequences of AS of Hoolock hoolock, Hylobates agilis and Nomascus siki were obtained by sending the contig sequences, which we determined in the present study, to the Consensus Maker program (version 2.0.0; http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/CONSENSUS/consensus.html). The consensus sequences obtained are included in the respective DDBJ files. The consensus sequences for Nomascus leucogenys,23Symphalangus syndactylus,9 human22, and orangutan7 AS were obtained from the respective references.

DiscussionIn addition to humans, higher-order AS has also been observed in all great ape species examined to date, although it had not been found in small apes (except for our recent report) or other primate taxa more distant from humans. Based on this distribution in primates, it is widely postulated that higher-order AS arose in the common ancestor of hominids.We have demonstrated the presence of high-order AS in all of the four genera of small apes. Thus, higher-order AS occurs widely in hominoids. The species of the Symphalangus genus that we previously examined was shown to have higher-order AS containing four or six basic repeat units in its HOR units. In the present study, we found clear HOR structures in the AS of species of Hoolock and Nomascus, in which 31 and 9 basic repeat units formed HOR units, respectively. HOR structures were also found in a species of Hylobates, although two types of HORs (8 and 13 basic repeat units) coexisted in a single clone.Nomascus leucogenys (Northern white-cheeked gibbon) has been extensively examined in the past for HOR structures by computational analysis of its genome sequence database and additional FISH experiments, but no positive evidence was obtained.23 In the present study, we have identified HOR in AS of N. siki (Southern white-cheeked gibbon). These two species are so close phylogenetically that they have been regarded as subspecies of one species until about a decade ago (N. leucogenys leucogenys and N. leucogenys siki, respectively). The most probable reason for this difference of results would be the difference in the method used; we relied on traditional sequencing of long clones preceded by detection of HOR signs. Another possible factor is the difference in the gibbon species. Satellite DNA is known to undergo rapid fluctuation in copy number. The HOR-containing AS we found may have been amplified in a small number of generations in the lineage leading to N. siki (or the individual we used), or its copy number may have been reduced rapidly in the lineage for N. leucogenys (or the individual used by those authors).Our strategy included a screening step of AS-containing fosmid clones for those exhibiting HOR signs, in which small parts of candidate clones were sequenced. We examined four Hoolock and six Nomascus clones by the method newly developed in the present study, and one and three clones, respectively, exhibited an HOR sign. Considering that our library screening did not involve a factor to favour HOR-containing AS clones, the HOR structure does not appear to be rare in AS sequences contained in their genomes. The lack of a sign does not necessarily mean that the AS clones examined have no HOR structure. In our method, as we described in the Results section, the probability of finding a sign in a single fosmid clone is 15/n, where n is the number of basic repeat units constituting the HOR unit. If n is as large as 100, it would be required to increase the number of fosmid clones to be examined or the number of Tn5 insertions in individual clones. We did not attempt this in the present study because we wanted to develop another, more efficient method.Another significance of our results is that we found HOR structures in AS residing in the centromere. This question remained from our previous study,9 because Symphalangus syndactylus carries AS in terminal regions of chromosomes in addition to in centromeres. The species of genus Nomascus examined so far also contain AS in terminal regions.20,23 In contrast, such structures are not found in Hoolock hoolock and Hylobates agilis,20 and, therefore, the possibility that the fosmid clones we sequenced originate from chromosomal portions other than the centromere would be negligible.The currently dominant view about the evolutionary origin of HOR-containing AS is that it arose in the common ancestor of hominids (family Hominidae). The evidence of its widespread occurrence in the other family (Hylobatidae) of hominoids requires reconsideration of the currently dominant view. Likely explanations for the history of HOR-containing AS are as follows: (i) HOR-containing AS was present in the last common ancestor of hominoids and (ii) HOR-containing AS emerged in most or all basal branches of hominoids. As a more parsimonious explanation, (i) would be preferred.The neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree of AS sequences is consistent with the widely accepted phylogenetic relationship of the host species. This neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree is, however, not powerful enough to extract information concerning the history of HOR structures, because the source sequences of the gibbon species (except for the case of Nomascus leucogenys) are limited to higher-order AS, while the consensus sequences of the hominid species represent both higher-order AS and monomeric AS.The purpose of the present study was to show evidence, if any, for HOR-containing AS in multiple gibbon genera, which was attained with lines clearly appearing in constant intervals in the pairwise comparison tables. It is now of interest whether AS sequences of gibbons exhibit within-species variation in the HOR structure, and, if so, how large the variation is. In hominids, the within-species HOR structure variation is larger in humans than in great ape species, and the reason for the higher level of variation in humans is not known. Further studies by identifying different types of HOR structures in gibbons are expected to contribute to the understanding of factors leading to the high level of variation of AS structure in humans, and factors that are associated with the more important role of higher-order AS than monomeric AS in centromere function.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis study was supported by Grants-in-Aid (23657165 and 23470098 to A.K. and 22247037 to H.H.) from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.We are grateful to Hiroshi Masumoto and Masanaru Takai for helpful discussions.Supplementary data"

IntroductionMedicago truncatula is a diploid model legume, a close relative of the tetraploid crop alfalfa,1 with its nuclear2,3 and plastid (AC093544) genomes sequenced and with a large collection of Tnt1 retrotransposon-tagged mutants.4Medicago truncatula belongs to the minority of flowering plant species in which plastids are inherited from both parents.5 Furthermore, the M. truncatula plastid genome lacks the large inverted repeat (IR) encoding the plastid ribosomal RNA operon; therefore, the species belongs to the inverted repeat-lacking clade (IRLC) of the Papillionideae subfamily.6,7 The analyses of chloroplast genes of IR-containing and IRLC plastid genomes revealed that the synonymous substitution rate in IR genes is 2.3-fold lower than in the single-copy genes, whereas uniform substitution rates were found in genomes lacking an IR.8 A study of IRLC legume species revealed that the ycf4 gene in Lathyrus has at least 20 times higher local point mutation rate than genes elsewhere on the plastid genome and the ycf4-psaI-accD-rps16 region is frequently associated with a gene loss in legumes.9 Localized hypermutation and associated gene loss were attributed to an unusual process, such as repeated DNA breakage and repair.9 Short tandem and inverted repeats were also found to be a salient feature of some of the legume plastid genomes.10 Repeats in the intergenic region of plastid genomes are common. Interestingly, however, some legume species harbour repeats in the coding regions of ycf1, ycf2, ycf4, psaA, psaB and accD genes. Despite these repeats, the original reading frame is maintained, suggesting that the genes are functional. The repeats are species-specific, and present in only some of the species, suggesting rapid gene evolution in legumes.9–11Thus far, studies of plastid genome sequences in legumes have involved only a single accession per species. The next-generation sequencing technology has enabled rapid sequencing of plastid genomes from total cellular DNA, in the absence of cloning.12–14 To gain insights into mechanisms operating at the species level, we used the next-generation technology to fully sequence the plastid genomes of four M. truncatula lines. Jemalong 2HA15 and R108-116 are genetic lines with an established tissue culture system. These are ecotypes with potential for plastid transformation, a prerequisite to studying the interaction of plastid and nuclear genes and engineering the photosynthetic machinery. We have chosen cultivars Borung and Paraggio from a screen of 11 lines to be used as parental lines in a study of plastid inheritance.We report here the finding of two alternative genome configurations in ssp. tricycla, represented by four accessions in a sample of eight. Furthermore, we found surprising, ecotype-specific length polymorphisms in the accD and ycf1 coding regions. The alternative genome organization and intragenic length polymorphisms could be linked to the presence of short direct and inverted repeats. However, the rate of genome rearrangements is sufficiently low, so that no ptDNA heterogeneity could be observed in plants maintained by single-seed descent.2. Materials and methods2.1. M. truncatula linesLines Jemalong A17, A20, Borung, Caliph, Cyprus, Parabinga, Paraggio, Salernes, Sephi, DZA012, GRC020, GRC098, ESP031 and ESP098A were received from the Samuel Roberts Noble Foundation, Ardmore, OK, USA. Jemalong 2HA and R108-1 seeds were received from Pascal Ratet and Eva Kondorosi. ISV-CNRS was from Gif sur Yvette, France respectively. Medicago truncatula ssp. tricycla lines 2529 (USDA PI 660437), 2624 (USDA PI 660450), 761 (USDA PI 535614), 765 (USDA PI 535618), 1665 (USDA PI 660496), GR546 (USDA PI 516949) and W11366 (USDA PI 564941) were obtained from Stephanie L. Greene, USDA, ARS National Temperate Forage Legume Germplasm Resources Unit, Prosser, WA, USA.2.2. DNA sequencingTotal cellular DNA was isolated from greenhouse-grown leaves using the CTAB method.17 The chloroplast genome was amplified in overlapping fragments using PCR primers modified from ref.18 or designed based on the reference Jemalong A17 plastid genome (GenBank AC093544) (Supplementary Table S1). Pooled PCR fragments (Supplementary Table S2) were purified on a QiaQuick MinElute kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) and ~8 µg of DNA was sheared in a Covaris ultrasonicator using the ‘500-bp’ programme. DNA sequence was determined on an Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) using a 500-bp insert library and 80-bp paired-end reads following the manufacturer's protocol. DNA sequence of trnQ-cemA region in 10 M. truncatula lines (GenBank KC989947–KC989956) was determined by dideoxy sequencing of PCR amplicons.2.3. Genome assemblyThe plastid genomes from 80-nt paired-end reads were assembled using a combination of the Velvet v. 1.119de novo assembly program at hash length 71 and the Burrows–Wheeler Alignment Tool v. 0.5.920 reference-based assembly programs. Missing regions between contigs were filled in by Sanger sequencing of PCR products amplified from the total genomic DNA template. Annotation was carried out using DOGMA21 and homologues in the Cicer arietinum (NC_011163), Pisum sativum (NC_014057), Lotus japonicus (NC_002694) and Solanum lycopersicum (NC_007898) ptDNA. Annotation of the ycf4 gene was based on ref.9.2.4. DNA gel blot analysesSouthern probing was carried out according to ref.22, except that a modified Church hybridization buffer (0.5 M Na2HPO4, 7% SDS, 10 mM EDTA, pH 7.2) was used instead of Rapid-hyb Buffer (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA). An amount of 1.5 µg of EcoRV- or HhaI-digested total cellular DNA was loaded per lane and probed with 32P-labelled Jemalong A17 PCR fragments (Supplementary Table S3).3. Results3.1. Sequencing of M. truncatula plastid genomesWe report here the plastid genome sequence of four M. truncatula ecotypes: Jemalong 2HA, Borung, Paraggio and R108. We constructed paired-end libraries of PCR-amplified DNA, sequenced them on the Illumina GAII platform and assembled the plastid genome sequences from 80-nucleotide (nt) reads. The sequence ambiguities and gaps were resolved by dideoxy sequencing of PCR amplicons using total cellular DNA as template, and the genome sequences were deposited in GenBank. The three ecotypes in ssp. truncatula, Jemalong 2HA (124 033 bp; GenBank JX512022), Borung (123 833 bp; GenBank JX512023) and Paraggio (123 706 bp; GenBank JX512024), have the same genome organization (Figs 1 and 2). The plastid genome sequence of Jemalong 2HA (from here on referred to as 2HA) is identical to the Jemalong A17 plastid genome in the database (GenBank AC093544) other than two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the A17 ptDNA. Upon re-sequencing the relevant regions of the A17 ptDNA, we confirmed that the 2HA and A17 ptDNA sequences are identical. We also assembled the plastid genome sequence of the R108 line; eliminated ambiguities by Sanger sequencing of amplicons and confirmed structure by DNA gel blot analyses (Section 3.2). We report here that the R108 (ssp. tricycla) ptDNA (123 418 bp; GenBank KF241982) has a large ~45-kb inversion relative to the three ssp. truncatula ecotypes (Supplementary Fig. S1). The inverted region is between rps15 and rps18, involving all genes from ycf1 to rpl20. Accordingly, the gene order at the junctions in the 2HA, Paraggio and Borung plastid genomes is rps15-ycf1 and rpl20-rps18, whereas the gene order in the R108 ptDNA is rps15-rpl20 and ycf1-rps18. The inversion apparently occurred via two intergenic runs of thymidine nucleotides (Ts) highlighted in yellow in Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. S1.

Coding regions are in blue, and non-coding regions are in pink.PCR amplification using the 2HA and R108 templates yielded the predicted junction fragments, confirming the genome structures shown in Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. S1 (primer pairs 12.909F-13.689R and S7_57758F-58.549R, and 13.689R-58647R and 12.821F-58.118F, respectively, in Supplementary Table S1). We also performed PCR amplification with non-matching primer combinations that should not have yielded specific amplicons. The 2HA template with R108-specific primers did not yield specific fragments, as expected. However, amplification of R108 template with 2HA-specifc primers (S7_57758F and 58.549R, Supplementary Table S1) yielded a specific product that, when sequenced, turned out to be a 2HA-type junction. This product apparently derived by amplification from a nuclear template that was incorporated in the nuclear genome prior to the appearance of R108 genome arrangement, confirming that the 2HA-specific genome organization is ancestral to the R108 type. In contrast, we could never amplify the R108-type ptDNA junction in the 2HA, or the other ssp. truncatula ecotypes.3.2. DNA gel blot analyses confirm inversion in the R108 ptDNAInversion in the R108 ptDNA has been confirmed by DNA gel blot analyses. The DNA probes were derived from the regions flanking the inversion in the 2HA line (Fig. 3A). Each of the four probes could distinguish the 2HA and R108 plastid genomes when probing HhaI-digested total cellular DNA (Fig. 3B). Probe 1 hybridized to a 7–kb fragment in 2HA and a 4.8–kb fragment in R108. Probe 2 hybridized to a 7–kb fragment in 2HA and a 5.4–kb fragment in R108. Probe 3 recognized 3.2 and 4.8–kb fragments and Probe 4 recognized 3.2 and 5.4 kb fragments in the 2HA and R108 samples, respectively. Single fragment sizes with the probes indicate that the two genome configurations are stable, and no flip-flop recombination is taking place via the short inverted repeats. We analysed multiple individuals and obtained results consistent with only one ptDNA configuration in different 2HA and R108 plants, as shown in Fig. 3B. Probing of EcoRV digested total cellular DNA also confirmed genome structure and the absence of flip-flop recombination (Supplementary Fig. S2). The 24- and 20-nt inverted repeats in the R108 and 2HA ptDNA (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. S1) are apparently too short to mediate frequent recombination that could be detected in DNA blots.

Survey for the inversion in ssp. tricycla plastid genomesThe R108 ecotype belongs to ssp. tricycla. To determine whether the inversion is characteristic of the subspecies, total cellular DNA was analysed from seven additional ssp. tricycla accessions. DNA gel blot analyses shown in Fig. 3C indicate that three of the lines (761, 765 and GR546) have an R108-type ptDNA and four others (2529, 2624, 1665 and W11366) a Jemalong 2HA-type gene order. Thus, two stable genomic isoforms are present in M. truncatula ssp. tricycla.3.4. Sequencing the accD-psaI-ycf4-cemA region reveals variability in accDInsertions and deletions in plastid genomes are typically restricted to intergenic regions. Large insertions and deletions in the M. truncatula ptDNAs are present in the ycf1-trnN, rpl14-rps8 and clpP-rps12 intergenic regions (Fig. 2). A striking feature visualized by the mVista alignment in Fig. 2 is the large number of insertions and deletions in the accD, and to a lesser degree in ycf1, coding regions.Intrigued by the insertions and deletions in the accD coding regions, we developed PCR markers spanning two variable regions and surveyed 24 M. truncatula ecotypes. We found that most, if not all, ecotypes could be distinguished by the combination of the two markers (Fig. 4A). To gain further insights into accD coding region variability, we sequenced the accD-psaI-ycf4-cemA region in 10 M. truncatula ecotypes (GenBank KC989947–KC989956). Alignment of the 10 accD coding regions revealed extensive length variation: ecotype GR546 had the longest (2391 bp, KC989955) and Borung the shortest (1953 bp, KC989949) accD, encoding 796 and 650 amino acids, respectively. Alignment of M. truncatula, other legume and angiosperm accD coding regions revealed islands of sequence conservation, including sequences at the N- and C-termini (Fig. 4B). Species-specific repetitive DNA has been reported in the P. sativum and Lathyrus sativus accD coding regions.9 Therefore, we used dot matrix plots to visualize repetitive DNA in the accD coding region of M. truncatula ecotypes (Fig. 4E). We have found that the variable regions contain a large number of complex repeats that are unique to the ecotype. The tobacco (512 amino acids), Arabidopsis (488 amino acids) and other angiosperm accD genes are significantly shorter (Fig. 4C) and lack repeats (Fig. 4D), suggesting that the variable protein regions encoded in the DNA repeats are not important for gene function. Interestingly, the reading frame in the accD genes has been conserved, suggesting that the genes are functional. In the potato plastid accD, three functionally relevant sites were identified: a putative acetyl-CoA binding site, a CoA-carboxylation catalytic site and a carboxybiotin-binding site.24 Each of the sites is clustered at the C-terminus of the protein, and they are conserved in all M. truncatula accessions (Fig. 5). Variation in the accD coding region is unique to ecotypes in M. truncatula. (A) PCR amplicon sizes are unique to ecotypes.

Length variation in the ycf1 coding regionWe aligned the ycf1 coding region in our four sequenced M. truncatula ptDNAs and screened them for indels. We have found that each of the coding regions were unique to the ecotype (Supplementary Fig. S3). The relatively large (5.3-kb) gene contains 10 polymorphic regions in the four lines, some of which are flanked by repeats, as in the accD gene. However, the repeats are less complex than in the accD gene, and the indels are much shorter. Unlike the length of accD, the overall length of ycf1 coding region is conserved in angiosperms (Supplementary Fig. S3).4. Discussion4.1. Two stable plastid genome configurations in M. truncatulaSequencing of multiple plastid genomes in rice (Oryza)25 and Jacobaea vulgaris26 revealed that intraspecies genome variability is typically restricted to SNPs and microsatellites in intergenic regions, and silent point mutations within coding regions. Particularly well conserved are plastid genomes in the Solanaceae family where the ptDNA of two sequenced cultivars in tomato (cv. IPA6 and cv. Ailsa Craig)27 and tobacco (cv. Bright Yellow and cv. Petit Havana)28 are identical to the nucleotide and the ptDNA of the allotetraploid Nicotiana tabacum and its maternal progenitor, Nicotiana sylvestris, differ only by seven sites.29 In contrast, our probing of plastid genome structure in M. truncatula revealed two stable plastid genome configurations. The 45-kb inversion is through a run of Ts nested in a short (20–24 nt) imperfect repeat (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. S1). Finding two alternative genome configurations in a species, aside from an early report in pea,30 to our knowledge, is unprecedented. The plastid gene order in the IR-containing legume L. japonicus31 and the closely related IRLC legume C. arietinum (chickpea)32 is the same as in the three ssp. truncatula accessions. Therefore, the R108 ptDNA genome organization is derived, generated by an inversion via the short direct repeats (Supplementary Fig. S1). Compared with the ancestral gene order, reorganization of the ptDNA in another legume, Trifolium subterraneum, is much more extensive, involving 14–18 inversions of 16 gene clusters. The endpoints of rearranged gene clusters are flanked by repeated sequences, as in M. truncatula, or tRNAs and pseudogenes.33 The ptDNA of the legume species P. sativum and L. sativus contain five and three inversions, respectively.9 In these legume species, the ptDNA of only a single accession has been studied. We predict, based on our finding of two stable plastid genomes in M. truncatula, that a survey of multiple accessions in these legume species is likely to uncover multiple genome configurations.4.2. Intraspecies variation in the accD and ycf1 coding regionsThe plastid-localized accD genes encode the ß-carboxyl transferase subunit of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase). It is an essential gene in tobacco, in which attempts at deleting the gene failed to yield stable knockout plants.34 Interestingly, accD has been lost independently at least six times from the plastid ge-nome of angiosperms, concurrent with the evolution of a nuclear copy.35 Well characterized is loss of the accD gene from the Gramineae plastid genome, where the prokaryotic type (heteromeric) plastid ACCase was replaced with a eukaryotic-type homomeric form in the nucleus.36,37 The evolutionary loss of accD gene from the plastid genome of Trifolium repens9 and Trachelium caeruleum35 was also concurrent with the transfer of an accD copy to the nucleus. In T. repens, the nuclear copy of accD is fused with the plastid lipoamide dehydrogenase; in T. caeruleum, a truncated carboxylase domain (331 amino acids), containing only ~250 conserved amino acids, is fused with a transit peptide. The accD genes in the sequenced M. truncatula ptDNA are larger, ranging in size from 650 to 796 amino acids (Fig. 4B), and always include the conserved carboxylase domain. Each of the 24 M. truncatula ecotypes in our survey appears to have a unique accD gene (Fig. 4A). However, the reading frame in each of the 10 sequenced lines has been maintained (Fig. 4B). The variable domains constitute the polymorphic regions containing a cluster of complex repeats (Fig. 4E). The compatibility of length variation with accD function explains why so many alleles are present in the different ecotypes. Intragenic expansion and contraction of the accD coding region appear to be linked to the presence of repeats. Frequent length polymorphism is likely to be generated by replication slippage, as described in the repeat-containing Oenothera ptDNA. Unlike in M. truncatula, the repeats in the Oenothera ptDNA are found in intergenic regions.38,39The ycf1 gene is also essential in tobacco, as no stable transplastomic plants lacking the ycf1 gene could be obtained.40 The ycf1 gene encoding a 214–kDa protein of the Tic complex41 is also tolerant to insertions and deletions, but the size of insertions and deletions is much smaller than in the accD gene, 2–15 amino acids in ~10 polymorphic regions. The reading frame is always maintained, suggesting that the genes are functional. The repeat structure in the ycf1 coding region is less complex than in the accD gene, typically a pair of short (5–8 nt) tandem repeats flanking the variable region.4.3. Next-generation sequencing of plastid genomesWe assembled the plastid genome sequence from 80-nt reads of PCR-amplified DNA. PCR amplificons of the ptDNA could be readily obtained for the ssp. truncatula genomes, which have the same general organization as the published A17 ptDNA. Inversion in the R108 ptDNA was suspected based on the absence of large PCR amplicons from the regions containing the inversion using A17 primers (note the absence of fragments with primers 9.7F/15.5R and 49F/50.8R in Supplementary Table S2 in R108 line). However, ancestral ptDNA copies in the nucleus were a complicating factor in the R108 line, because we obtained small PCR fragments for both configurations at the rpl20-rps18 junction. The controversy could ultimately be resolved by DNA gel blot analyses detecting only high-copy ptDNA, confirming the inversion in the R108 plastid genome. The presence of a few copies of ptDNA fragments covering the entire genome in the nucleus is well documented in many species, including tobacco,42Arabidopsis43 and maize.44 Best characterized is the nuclear plastid DNA (NUPTs) in the rice nucleus, where sequential transfer of ancestral ptDNA could be shown.454.4. Utility of genome sequence for genetic analyses and biotechnologyThe ptDNA sequence information we report here provides new markers to study plastid inheritance,5,46 and for the design of plastid transformation vectors where homology between the vector targeting sequences and recipient ptDNA is important for efficient incorporation of the transforming DNA.47,48 Our study of complete plastid genomes of multiple accessions in M. truncatula revealed a significant intraspecies ptDNA variation. Therefore, it will be particularly important to obtain subspecies-level ptDNA sequence information for vector design in clades, which have highly rearranged plastid genomes, such as the Geraniaceae,49,50 Campanulaceae,51–53 Oleaceae54 and Fabaceae.33,55Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by the United States Department of Agriculture, National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Biotechnology Risk Assessment Research Grant Program Award 2010-2716 to P.M.

IntroductionTomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) is an economically important vegetable crop worldwide and a pre-eminent plant genetic analysis system. Genetic marker development for tomato has been conducted over 30 years through various approaches, including restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), random ampli<U+FB01>ed polymorphic DNA (RAPD), ampli<U+FB01>ed fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs), simple sequence repeat (SSR), cleaved ampli<U+FB01>ed polymorphisms (CAPs), and conserved ortholog sets (COSs). Most markers developed by these approaches are based on DNA or cDNA polymorphisms between wild species and cultivated tomato, which lead to the construction of the first generation reference linkage maps and isolation of genes of interests.1,2 However, the ability of using these markers to detect polymorphisms in cultivated tomato is limited.3 Recent efforts to develop new markers in cultivated tomato have been focus on single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using in silico mining of expressed sequence tag database and experimental validation,4–7 amplicon sequencing of COS genes,8,9 hybridization to oligonucleotide array,10 and next-generation sequencing of transcriptome or re-sequencing of genome.11–13 Owing to the abundance and wide distribution of SNPs in the whole genome and the availability of automatic large-scale genotyping platform, SNPs have widely been used in association analysis,13–15 high-density SNP map construction,7,16 as well as population structure and genetic variation analysis17–20 in cultivated tomato.Short insertion and deletion (InDel) polymorphisms are increasingly being received attention in human because they are the second abundant form of genetic variation and can influence multiple human phenotypes including diseases.21–25 Therefore, great efforts have been put on identification, mapping, and functional analysis of InDels in the human genome.26–28 Similar work has been done in other species, such as Arabidopsis and rice.29–33 In tomato, a total of 749 966 putative InDels of 3–300 bp have been identified by comparing the genome sequences of Solanum pimpinellifolium accession LA 1589 and S. lycopersicum variety Heinz 1706,34 and more than 80 000 putative InDels of 1–15 bp have been discovered by comparative analysis of transcriptome between wild species S. galapagense and cultivated tomato.35 However, less work on discovery of InDels in cultivated tomato has been done.The availability of the whole genome or transcriptome sequences provides a potential to identify InDels in silico. We here developed a pipeline to identify InDels by comparative analysis of the two available genome sequences of LA 1589 and Heinz 1706. A total of 3029 candidate InDels were subjected to experimental validation by PCR amplification of genomic DNA in a collection of 22 tomato lines. The main objective of this study was to develop easy-using markers for genetic study and marker-assisted selection in cultivated tomato.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materials and DNA isolationA panel of 22 tomato genotypes comprising of cultivated tomato (S. lycopersicum) and its wild relatives were used to validate InDel polymorphisms. These inbred lines were selected to represent a diverse collection including eight accessions of S. pimpinellifolium, five processing varieties, one greenhouse cultivar, four fresh market cultivars, and four S. lycopersicum var. cerasiforme accessions (Table 1). Nine of them were used for SNP detection in our previous study.9 The eight S. pimpinellifolium accessions were selected from the core collection or sources being used for genetic studies and were used to detect polymorphisms of candidate InDels within the species. Genomic DNA was isolated from fresh-collected young leaves of at least eight plants for each genotype using the modified CTAB method.36Description of plant materialsDescription of plant materials2.2. Prediction of InDels between LA 1589 and Heinz 1706The genomic DNA sequences of S. pimpinellifolium accession LA 1589 (Spimpinellifolium_genome.contigs.fasta.gz) and S. lycopersicum variety Heinz 1706 (S_lycopersicum_chromosomes.2.40.fa.gz) were downloaded to a local computer from the SOL Genomics Network (SGN, http://solgenomics.net/, 19 February 2014, date last accessed). The genomic DNA sequence contigs of LA 1589 were assigned to Heinz 1706 genome using local MUGSY37 downloaded from Sourceforge (http://mugsy.sourceforge.net/, 19 February 2014, date last accessed). InDel polymorphisms referring to Heinz 1706 were mined from the alignments using custom PERL scripts. Flanking sequences of 100 bp from each side of candidate InDels were extracted from Heinz 1706 sequences for insertion and LA 1589 sequences for deletion. The flanking sequences were then blasted against LA 1589 sequences for deletion or Heinz 1706 sequences for insertion using local BLASTall with an E-value of e-20 to remove hits with low similarity. The types (insertion or deletion), lengths, nucleotides, and chromosomal positions of InDels were extracted using a PERL script with the highest score of blast search.2.3. Selection of InDels for validation and primer designOur initial goal was to verify 3000 candidate InDels of 2 bp or longer evenly distributing on 12 chromosomes. Based on the genome sequenced for Heinz 1706 (760 Mb),34 the average distance between two adjacent InDels would be ~250 kb. The number of InDels to be validated was determined by the length of each chromosome (Table 2). However, we found that the InDels were not always evenly distributed on chromosomes and hotspots have high levels of InDels than other regions. Therefore, we tried to acquire an InDel per 200 kb in each chromosome using a PERL script. If a region on a chromosome did not have InDel variation, the PERL script would make 200 plus 100 kb on circulation until it matched. Summary statistics for primer design, PCR amplification, and polymorphismsaThe sequenced genome size was obtained from Sato et al.34Summary statistics for primer design, PCR amplification, and polymorphismsaThe sequenced genome size was obtained from Sato et al.34To design primers for PCR validation of InDels, flanking sequences of 100 bp for each side of candidate InDels were extracted. Primers were designed using local Primer338 downloaded from Sourceforge (http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=112461, 19 February 2014, date last accessed) with PCR product length 100–200 bp and the optimal length of primer sequence of 20 bp. Several primer pairs were designed for each InDel. The best primer pair was selected based on the optimal GC content of 40–60% and the difference of GC content between forward and reverse primers <10%. All the process was carried out using custom PERL scripts. Primers were synthesized at Sunbiotech Company (Beijing, China) or Sangong Company (Beijing, China).2.4. Validation of InDels using PCRThe PCR technique was adapted to validate the candidate InDels. All synthesized primers were first used to amplify genomic DNA of tomato lines LA 1589 and Heinz 1706. Only primers that successfully amplified a product and had length polymorphisms were then used to detect polymorphisms in the 22 tomato genotypes.All PCRs were done in 10-µl reaction volume using the method described in Wei et al.39 Reactions were heated at 95°C for 5 min, followed by 32 cycles of 30 s at 95°C, 30 s at 50–60°C depending on the Tm values of primer pairs, and 30 s at 72°C, with a final extension of 5 min at 72°C. The PCR products were subsequently separated in 8% polyacrylamide gel and visualized using the silver-staining approach.172.5. Data collection and analysisThe presence or absence of each allele for each InDel was coded by 1 or 0, respectively, and scored for a binary data matrix. Allele frequency of each InDel marker was calculated for each genotype. Nei's genetic distance40 was calculated for each pair of tomato genotypes using the programme in the software package PHYLIP 3.695 (http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip.html, 19 February 2014, date last accessed). An Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA) cluster analysis was performed to develop a dendrogram.The occurrences of InDels in coding regions of genes were examined by blasting the flanking sequences of 100 bp for each side of the InDel against the tomato ITAG2.3_cds.fasta downloaded from SGN using a PERL script.3. Result3.1. Candidate InDels between LA 1589 and Heinz 1706A total of 145 695 candidate InDels were identified between the genome sequences of Heinz 1706 and LA 1589, of which 65 619 were insertions and 80 076 were deletions in Heinz 1706 (Table 3). The average size of predicted InDels was 4.1 bp with a range of 1–94 bp, of which ~54.0% were 1 bp, 42.3% were 2–20 bp, and 3.7% were longer than 20 bp. The average density of InDels was one per 5.22 kb with a range of 4.33–6.72 kb on 12 chromosomes. The highest density was on chromosome 6 and the lowest density was on chromosome 12 (Table 3). The least difference of numbers for InDels between 1 bp and >1 bp was observed on chromosome 2 (101), while the largest was on chromosome 10 (1496). Predicted number and frequency of InDels between Heinz 1706 and LA 1589Predicted number and frequency of InDels between Heinz 1706 and LA 15893.2. Number of primers designed and success of PCR amplificationUsing the approach described in the section ‘Selection of InDels for validation and primer design’ of Materials and methods, 3029 candidate InDels were selected and primers were designed for PCR validation (Supplementary Table S1). The average physical distance between two adjacent InDels was 250 kb with a range of 241 (chromosome 2) to 255 kb (chromosome 3) on 12 chromosomes. PCR results showed that 272 primer pairs could not generate PCR products from the genomic DNA of both Heinz 1706 and LA 1589 (Table 2) . The PCR success rate was 91.0%, which was consistent with our previous finding of 91.9% for PCR amplification of genomic DNA in tomato.9 The InDel sizes of PCR products amplified by most primer pairs (98.5%) were as predicted. However, 23 primer pairs showed smaller and 10 primer pairs showed larger sizes than predicted (Supplementary Table S1). In addition, 485 primer pairs did not show detectable polymorphisms between Heinz 1706 and LA 1589 (Table 2). The InDel sizes between 6 and 30 bp had a high percentage (83.6%) of polymorphism validation, while InDels with sizes of <6 bp and >30 bp received 78.3 or 43.3% polymorphism validation, respectively. Particularly, only one of five InDels was validated when the size was >50 bp (Supplementary Table S2). The primer pairs with PCR failure or non-detectable polymorphisms were excluded, and the remaining 2272 primer pairs were used for subsequent analysis. Therefore, the actual average distance between two adjacent InDels was 334 kb with a range of 285 (chromosome 2) to 430 kb (chromosome 1) on 12 chromosomes.The 2272 InDel markers generated 5025 alleles in the whole collection of 22 tomato genotypes. The number of alleles generated for all InDels varied from 2 to 8 with an average of 2.2. Among the polymorphic InDels, most (85.3%) had two alleles, 10.7% had three alleles, and 2.7% had four alleles (Fig. 1). Only three and two markers had seven and eight alleles, respectively. Similarly, 84.9% polymorphic InDels in S. pimpinellifolium, 94.7% in S. lycopersicum var. cerasiforme, and 95.8% in S. lycopersicum had two alleles (Fig. 1).

Marker polymorphisms and distribution among three tomato speciesOf the 5025 alleles amplified by 2272 InDel markers, 1930 were shared by all three species. The total number of alleles in each species reduced from 3941 in S. pimpinellifolium to 3431 in S. lycopersicum var. cerasiforme and 3110 in S. lycopersicum (Fig. 2). The number of alleles unique to each species also dramatically decreased from 1382 in S. pimpinellifolium to 56 in S. lycopersicum var. cerasiforme and 60 in S. lycopersicum. Solanum pimpinellifolium shared more alleles with S. lycopersicum var. cerasiforme than with S. lycopersicum.

This figure appears in colour in the online version of DNA Research.Pairwise comparisons revealed that almost all InDel markers were polymorphic between S. pimpinellifolium and S. lycopersicum var. cerasiforme or S. lycopersicum. However, the proportion of polymorphic InDels reduced to 53.0% between S. lycopersicum var. cerasiforme and S. lycopersicum. There were 0.1–20.7% InDels had alleles alternatively fixed in paired species. In addition, 18.5–26.9% InDels had alleles shared by paired species. Proportions of InDels with alleles specific to one certain species varied from 6.1 to 44.0% (Fig. 3). The proportion of polymorphic InDels was 61.4–100.0% (average 84.6%) between any accession in S. pimpinellifolium and any genotype in S. lycopersicum, 55.3–93.8% (average 71.5%) between any accession in S. pimpinellifolium and any line in S. lycopersicum var. cerasiforme, and 7.7–33.9% (average 19.2%) between any line in S. lycopersicum var. cerasiforme and any genotype in S. lycopersicum (Supplementary Table S3).

Solanum pimpinellifolium had a relatively even distribution of polymorphic InDels on all 12 chromosomes. Solanum lycopersicum var. cerasiforme had the similar distribution pattern of polymorphic InDels as S. pimpinellifolium on chromosomes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 11, but clusters of polymorphic InDels occurred at some regions on chromosomes 1, 7, and 12. The distribution of polymorphic InDels varied across and within chromosomes in S. lycopersicum. Among six chromosomes with less polymorphic InDels, chromosomes 1, 8, 10, and 12 had relatively even distribution, while the long-arm ends of chromosomes 3 and 7 had more InDels than other regions. There were less InDels at one end of chromosomes 2, 4, 5, 9, and 11. However, chromosomes 5, 9, and 11 showed relatively even distribution. On chromosome 6, the short arm had more polymorphic InDels than the long arm.The proportion of polymorphic InDels on 12 chromosomes ranged from 45.9 to 81.8% in S. pimpinellifolium, 5.8 to 76.6% in S. lycopersicum var. cerasiforme, and 5.3 to 72.2% in S. lycopersicum (Fig. 4). The numbers of polymorphic InDels considerably decreased on four chromosomes 1, 7, 8, and 12 in S. lycopersicum var. cerasiforme and S. lycopersicum (Table 2). Furthermore, the proportions of polymorphic InDels on chromosomes 3 and 10 were close between S. pimpinellifolium and S. lycopersicum var. cerasiforme, but significantly decreased in S. lycopersicum (Fig. 4). Interestingly, increases of InDel polymorphisms were observed on chromosomes 4, 5, and 11 in S. lycopersicum var. cerasiforme and S. lycopersicum. The proportions of polymorphic InDels also increased on chromosomes 2 and 3 in S. lycopersicum var. cerasiforme.

Marker polymorphisms and genetic vitiation within three tomato speciesThe proportion of polymorphic InDels was 61.6% in 8 S. pimpinellifolium accessions, 45.2% in 4 S. lycopersicum var. cerasiforme accessions, and 31.6% in 10 cultivated tomato varieties (Table 2). However, the rate of polymorphic InDels between any two genotypes was low with a range of 14.3–33.6% in S. pimpinellifolium, 17.5–31.5% in S. lycopersicum var. cerasiforme, and 1.5–19.8% in S. lycopersicum (Supplementary Table S3).Not surprisingly, the eight accessions of S. pimpinellifolium had the largest genetic variation among three species. The average genetic distance was 0.216 with a range from 0.178 (PI 128216) to 0.244 (LA1589). Accessions LA 1589 and LA 2181 had the greatest genetic distance with 0.394, whereas accessions PI 128216 and LA 0373 had the least genetic distance with 0.137. The average genetic distance slightly reduced to 0.202 with a range from 0.162 (LA 4133) to 0.237 (PI 114490) in four S. lycopersicum var. cerasiforme lines, but significantly decreased to 0.108 with a range of 0.086 (Baiguoqiangfeng) to 0.139 (M 82) in 10 varieties of S. lycopersicum. The minimum genetic distance was 0.012 between varieties Liger 87-5 and M 82, followed by 0.015 between varieties Baiguoqiangfeng and Zhongshu 5, while the largest genetic distance was 0.214 between Shijifeng and M 82.The dendrogram was constructed from the pairwise genetic distance matrices based on Nei's distance for 22 genotypes. Two distinct groups, A and B, were obtained (Fig. 5). All 8 accessions of S. pimpinellifolium were in Group A, and 10 S. lycopersicum var. cerasiforme cultivars and 4 S. lycopersicum var. cerasiforme accessions were in Group B. The four fresh market cultivars clustered together. However, five processing varieties, one greenhouse variety, and four S. lycopersicum var. cerasiforme accessions did not form their own clades. Of the four S. lycopersicum var. cerasiforme lines, LA 4133 clustered to three processing and one greenhouse varieties, Black cherry clustered to two processing varieties, while PI 114490 and LA 1310 stood alone.

Genes with InDels in the coding regionBlast search of flanking sequences of 2272 validated InDels against the tomato ITAG2.3_cds.fasta data identified 56 InDels in coding regions of annotated genes (Supplementary Table S4), of which 64.3% were deletions in Heinz 1706 and 35.7% were insertion in Heinz 1706. Based on the sizes of InDels, 28.6% of InDels were frame-shift mutations, because the numbers of nucleotides in the InDels were indivisible by three. The remaining 71.4% InDels did not result in frame-shift, but would cause insertion or deletion of some amino acids.4. DiscussionMolecular markers are important to genetic study and marker-assisted selection. Large-scale discovery combining high-throughput genotyping of SNPs have shown its power in gene identification and breeding in tomato.12 However, high costs and technical or equipment demands will still be a major obstacle for large-scale use of SNPs in the developing countries.41,42 On the contrary, the genotyping of short InDels is relatively easy and inexpensive with a simple PCR and electrophoresis. Short InDels can also be analysed with high-throughput technologies26,43,44 and in large-scale multiplexing.45 As a type of genetic markers, InDels have been successfully used for forensic analysis46–48 and individual identification44,45 in human, as well as genetic studies in several plant species including rice, wheat, citrus, and Arabidopsis.33 Although the tomato genome sequences have been widely used in various purposes including SNP discovery, genetic mapping, gene prediction, gene expression, genetic diversity, comparative genomics, and epigenetics since their release,49 identification of InDels has so far been confined to detect polymorphisms between wild species and cultivated tomato.34,35 In this study, we identified InDels by comparative analysis of genome sequences between S. pimpinellifolium and S. lycopersicum, and then validated them in 10 cultivated tomato lines via PCR amplification. Of 2272 InDels polymorphic between LA 1589 and Heinz 1706, 31.6% were polymorphic among the 10 cultivated tomato varieties and 1.5–19.8% were polymorphic between any 2 of the 10 cultivated tomato varieties. Based on the total number of InDels (145 695) between LA 1589 and Heinz 1706, we estimated that there were 2100–28 800 InDels between any two cultivated tomato varieties, suggesting that there were abundant InDels for genetic study and marker-assisted selection in the cultivated tomato.Precise identification of InDels in sequence databases depends on the strategy and the parameters used for data mining as well as the quality of sequence data. Since InDels are the dominant error type generated by 454 pyrosequencing50 and an InDel error rate of one per 6.4 kb was observed in tomato,34 the initial work on identification of InDels between the genomes of LA 1589 and Heinz 1706 did not count InDels of 1 and 2 bp to avoid overestimation of small InDels due to sequencing errors.34 Using a bioinformatic pipeline involving various comparative genomics tools, 9474 InDels of 15–100 bp were identified between LA 1589 and Heinz 1706, and >80% could be verified by PCR (Jiang et al. unpublished data, acquired from ftp://ftp.solgenomics.net/maps_and_markers/LippmanZ/, 19 February 2014, date last accessed). In this study, a total of 145 695 InDels were predicted between LA 1589 and Heinz 1796, which was approximate one-fifth of 749 966 InDels Identified in Sato et al.34 The overall frequency of InDels (one per 5.22 kb) was also much lower than one per 110 bp in Sato et al.34 However, the number (9137) of InDels of 15–94 bp was close to the results of Jiang et al., though the strategies used for InDels identification were different. Owing to the lack of methodology description in Sato et al.,34 we were not able to determine the cause of the difference between two studies. Two points might be worthy of notice. First, the lengths of putative InDels identified in two studies were different with ranges of 3–300 bp in Sato et al.34 and 1–94 bp in this study. We could not identify any InDels >94 bp using our methodology. Secondly, the rate of validation (82.4%) was close to 81.7% obtained in Koenig et al.,35 though the comparisons involved in different wild species and cultivated varieties, indicating that ~20% of predicted InDels (=2 bp) were false due to sequencing error. All these suggested that our prediction might be more close to the real number of InDels in the currently available genome sequences of LA 1589 and Heinz 1706.The polymorphic InDels evenly distributed across all 12 chromosomes in S. pimpinellifolium, but appeared non-randomly distributed across and within chromosomes in S. lycopersicum var. cerasiforme and S. lycopersicum. Domestication and selection could be one causal of this difference. For example, there were 38 and 35 polymorphic InDels at the bottom (~11 Mb) of chromosome 2 in S. pimpinellifolium and S. lycopersicum var. cerasiforme, respectively, but only two InDels were polymorphic in S. lycopersicum. This might be due to the existence of quantitative trait loci for fruit weight and selection for large fruit in S. lycopersicum.12 In addition, several studies have proved that the introgression of disease resistance genes in many cultivars has strong influence on SNP patterns.19,51 This kind of introgression could also cause the difference of polymorphic InDels distribution among three species.It has been suggested that domestication and inbreeding dramatically reduced the genetic variation52 and modern cultivars have less genetic variation than old ones in tomato.53,54 In this study, genetic variation of three species was investigated using the same large set of InDel markers, which allowed us to compare genetic polymorphisms among and within species at the same time. The number of polymorphic InDels, the total number of alleles amplified by InDel markers, and the average genetic distance in 10 S. lycopersicum varieties significantly reduced comparing with those in 8 S. pimpinellifolium accessions, supported the reduction of genetic variation in cultivated tomato. The four S. lycopersicum var. cerasiforme accessions showed an intermediate amount of genetic diversity between S. lycopersicum and S. pimpinellifolium, which was consistent with previous findings.55,56 However, some novel alleles occurred in both S. lycopersicum var. cerasiforme and S. lycopersicum, suggesting that domestication and selection could also generate new variation.The occurrence of InDels in coding regions of a gene can either cause frame-shift or amino acid InDels, which most likely alternates the gene function and results in phenotype change.57 A Rider mutational insertion event occurring in the first exon of the Psy1 gene causes the early termination of Psy1 transcription that results in yellow flesh in the tomato r mutant.58 A single-base deletion mutation in the coding region of SlIAA9 gene, an Aux/IAA gene involving in tomato leaf morphology, converts tomato compound leaves to simple leaves.59 InDels occurring in the promoter region can also affect the gene expression.60 Here, we identified 145 695 InDels between LA 1589 and Heinz 1706, and 31.6% of them were polymorphic in cultivated tomatoes. The percentage of InDels (2.5%) occurring in coding regions of genes identified in this study was much lower than our recent work (19.7%) on comparative analysis of resistance-like genes between LA 1589 and Heinz 1706.61 Identification of specific genes in our previous work other than a random sample in this study could cause the different proportions of InDels in coding regions.In conclusion, there are abundant short InDels in cultivated tomato. Identification and validation of this kind of short InDels will not only provide molecular markers for genetic study and marker-assisted selection in breeding, but also provide useful information for gene cloning and functional analysis.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThe work was partially supported by the National Program on Key Basic Research Projects (The 973 Program: 2012CB113900) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31171973).We thank Dr David M.

We believe that the malaria mutator system could provide a novel and useful tool to investigate malaria biology.1. IntroductionMalaria imposes a serious public health concern throughout the tropics with estimated 1.2 million deaths worldwide in 2010, due mostly to infections of Plasmodium falciparum, the most virulent human malaria parasite.1 This parasite has developed drug resistance to almost all conventional antimalarial drugs.2 Development of malaria vaccines targeting both insect and blood stage parasites is still ongoing.3,4 These circumstances urge us to further pursue effective intervention strategies to combat malaria. However, our knowledge of the parasite biology to identify new drug and vaccine targets is still inadequate. Current genetic tools, although limited, provided opportunities to specifically alter the parasite genome to explore its biology and gain new insights into gene function and expression.5–11 A combination approach that exploits the advantages of different genetic tools may provide the best strategy to study malaria parasite biology.Important biological phenotypes/traits of malaria parasites like drug resistance are often caused by a point mutation(s).12–14 If the mutation rate of malaria parasites is artificially increased, it is expected that parasites can rapidly acquire novel phenotypes/traits that can be selected for under appropriate selectable conditions: e.g. drug resistance would be readily produced under the pressure of a drug of interest. To date, little attempts have been made to utilize such parasites with an accelerated mutation rate to study malaria parasite biology.In eukaryotic organisms, the spontaneous mutation rate is very low, e.g. 3.3 × 10-10/base pair (bp)/cell division in yeast,15 2.7 × 10-9/bp/generation in Caenorhabditis elegans,16 and 5.8 × 10-9/bp/generation in Drosophila melanogaster.17 The mutation rate of in vitro P. falciparum culture was recently reported as 1.0–9.7 × 10-9/bp/generation.18 These low mutation rates are ensured by the high fidelity of DNA replication due to the strict selectivity of correct bases and the proofreading function of DNA polymerases, as well as the mismatch repair system. DNA polymerases a, d, and e are involved in nuclear genome DNA synthesis, of which polymerases d and e possess a proofreading 3' <U+2192> 5' exonuclease activity for lagging and leading DNA strand replication, respectively. The proofreading activity domain of DNA polymerases d and e is widely conserved from prokaryotes to eukaryotes,19,20 including Plasmodium.21 Disruption of the proofreading activity by site-directed mutagenesis significantly increased a mutation rate by as much as 10-fold to >100-fold,20,22,23 and the mutator effect is particularly strong in DNA polymerase d.20,24 Furthermore, in microorganisms such as yeast and fungi, the mutator system has been employed to generate various mutated phenotypes including drug resistance.25–28In the present study, we generated a mutator malaria parasite (hereinafter called a ‘malaria mutator’) using a rodent malaria parasite, Plasmodium berghei ANKA by eliminating the proofreading activity of its DNA polymerase d and performed genome-wide analysis of mutations in order to see whether mutation rate in the mutator increased as expected. The mutation rate of the malaria mutator was 86- to 90-fold higher than the control parasite.2. Materials and methods2.1. Generation of mutator parasites and its phenotypic analysesThe rodent malaria parasite, P. berghei ANKA strain (clone 2.34), was used. The plasmid and primer sequences used for generation of mutator parasite are described in Supplementary Data (Supplementary Data). In brief, the two amino acids critical for proofreading in DNA polymerase d were replaced with alanine in the mutator parasites. The phenotype analyses (growth rate, gametocytogenesis, male gametogenesis, and ookinete formation) of the mutator parasites were performed as described in Supplementary Data.2.2. Maintenance of parasites in miceMutator (referred to PbMut) and control parasites (PbCtl) were maintained by weekly passages in mice. We injected intraperitoneally 100 or 1,000 infected erythrocytes into two female ddY mice (6- to 10-week-old; Japan SLC), respectively. Infected blood of either mouse reaching adequate parasitaemia (several percent) was collected 1 week later by cardiac puncture and used for the next passage. Cloning of parasites by limiting dilution was done in the 53rd and 119th week of passage for PbMut, and in the 43rd and 119th week of passage for PbCtl.2.3. High-throughput genome sequencingGenomic DNA from the cloned lines and PbWT (Supplementary Data) was sequenced genome wide using an Illumina HiSeq 2000 or an Illumina Genome Analyzer II. Paired-end read sequencing was performed using read lengths of 90 or 100 bases. Low quality reads with an N-rate of >10% and/or reads for >50% all bases with a PHRED quality score of =5 were removed. To exclude mouse DNA-derived reads, the sequence reads were aligned to the Mus musculus (C57BL/6J) genome sequence from the NCBI Genome database using SOAP2,29 and matched reads were removed.2.4. Read mapping and mutation identificationThe sequence data were further processed using two pipelines, i.e. one by read alignment using Bowtie version 0.12.730 and variant calling with VarScan version 2.2.8,31 and the other with the CLC Genomics Workbench software (CLC Bio). We used the genome sequence (18.2 Mb) of the P. berghei ANKA strain32 as a reference sequence, which was downloaded from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute website (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/). Further details are provided in Supplementary Data. Mutations detected by Illumina genome sequencing were validated preliminarily by Sanger sequencing. For comparison, all insertions and deletions (indels), all base substitutions causing non-sense mutations, and all base substitutions detected using either of two pipelines were validated preliminarily by Sanger sequencing (Supplementary Data). The Sanger sequencing confirmed all the mutations (data not shown). Thus, we inferred that the sequences produced by Illumina sequencing were consistent.2.5. Detection of mutation clusters in a chromosomeThe r-scan statistics was used to detect significant clustering of mutations along each chromosome as described previously.33 We used two probability cut-offs: 1 and 5%. Overlapping clustering regions were considered as a single mutation cluster region.2.6. Estimation of mutation ratesWe estimated the mutation rate using the base substitution data generated by the Bowtie and VarScan pipeline. The mutation rate was calculated using the equation µbs = m/(nT), where µbs is the base substitution rate (per nucleotide site per day), m is the number of mutations detected, n is the number of nucleotide sites, and T corresponds to the passage days.34 The mutation rate was calculated for the following specific regions: synonymous sites (Syn) and non-synonymous sites (NonSyn) in protein-coding regions; introns; intergenic regions; and the overall sequences. Syn and NonSyn sites were estimated as described by Nei and Gojobori.35 The mutation rate per replication was also calculated. In the ddY mice used here, P. berghei multiplied ~10-fold per day during the logarithmic growth phase, and hence, we assumed log210 (˜3.3) replications per day. We considered that the number of base substitutions were the same as that of point mutations because no complicated mutations were found at a given substituted site. Fisher's exact test for the 2 × 2 contingency table was performed to assess statistical significance of difference in variant proportion between specific regions (i.e. Syn vs. NonSyn, NonSyn vs. intron, and intron vs. Syn). For this test, we rounded the numbers of Syn and NonSyn sites to unit.2.7. Data accessThe raw sequence reads used in this study are available from the DDBJ Sequence Read Archive (DRA) under accession No. DDBJ: DRA000656. The information for P. berghei genes discussed in this publication is available from PlasmoDB (www.plasmodb.org).3. Results3.1. Generation of malaria mutatorUsing site-directed mutagenesis and gene transfection techniques, we established a mutator P. berghei line where DNA polymerase d had a defective proofreading activity (referred to as PbMut) and a control P. berghei line with wild-type (non-mutated) DNA polymerase d (referred to as PbCtl) (Supplementary Data). These parasite lines were then subjected to serial passages and cloning, and two PbMut lines (M122A and M122B) and one PbCtl line (C122), as well as one PbWT line, were obtained (Supplementary Data).3.2. Mutations generated in the malaria mutatorHigh-throughput genome sequencing of PbMut lines (M122A and M122B), one PbCtl line (C122), and one PbWT line produced each 0.9–1.2 Gb, which corresponded to ~50-fold redundancy relative to the P. berghei ANKA genome sequence from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (18.2 Mb) (Supplementary Data). We reconstructed ~86–95% sequence regions that encompassed the 14 chromosomes and analysed them for mutations generated in PbMut and PbCtl. Preliminary analysis revealed that PbWT (clone 2.34) used in this study had 71 substitutions compared with the Wellcome Trust Sanger ANKA reference sequence (Supplementary Data). It is not certain whether these differences are true substitutions or due to artefacts such as mapping errors and/or sequencing/assembly errors from the lower coverage (×4) reference genome sequence.32 We therefore compared the sequence of PbWT (clone 2.34) with those of PbMut and PbCtl lines, and different sites were regarded as variants that occurred in each line. The number of point mutations in PbMut and PbCtl differed dramatically (Table 1, Fig. 1, and Supplementary Data). We only detected two base substitutions in C122, whereas 178 and 175 base substitutions were detected in M122A and M122B, respectively (Supplementary Data). A large proportion of the substitutions (n = 162) were shared by the two PbMut lines. This high rate of shared mutations between the two PbMut clones was probably due to a severe bottleneck effect during each mouse passage, where 100–1,000 infected erythrocytes were inoculated intraperitoneally, corresponding to intravenous injection of 10–100 infected erythrocytes. There were 107 and 110 base substitutions in the protein-coding gene regions of M122A and M122B, respectively. Most of these substitutions, 89 and 92 substitutions in M122A and M122B, respectively, were NonSyn substitutions (missense mutations).

PbMut lines also had seven to eight base substitutions in introns and 58–63 base substitutions in intergenic regions. PbCtl had two NonSyn substitutions in genes with unknown function (Supplementary Data). Five single-base indel mutations were detected in single-nucleotide repeat regions in PbMut lines (Table 3), but none in the PbCtl line. Two were found in protein-coding genes, causing frameshifts in the phosphatidylinositol transfer protein gene (PBANKA_136380) and a gene encoding for ApiAP2 (PBANBKA_143750).

This might suggest the presence of mutation hot spots in the P. berghei genome.3.3. Mutation rate of the mutatorOverall substitution rate (mean ± SE) was 0.14 × 10-9/bp/day (0.42 × 10-10/bp/cell division) for C122, 12.7 × 10-9/bp/day (3.8 × 10-9/bp/cell division) for M122A, and 12.2 × 10-9/bp/day (3.7 × 10-9/bp/cell division) for M122B, respectively. Thus, the mutation rate was 86- to 90-fold higher in PbMut than in PbCtl. Since no mutation was detected in the intergenic regions in PbCtl, we were unable to calculate the mutation rate in the intergenic regions, but it should be <0.21 × 10-9/bp/day (0.62 × 10-10/bp/cell division), the rate estimated by assuming one mutation in the regions. The mutation rates (M122A: 13.6 × 10-9/bp/day and M122B: 11.9 × 10-9/bp/day) in the intergenic regions in PbMut were similar to those in overall regions (Fig. 2). In intragenic regions, the mutation rate in NonSyn sites was comparable with that of overall sites. Although the NonSyn mutation rates (M122A: 13.2 × 10-9/bp/day and M122B: 13.4 × 10-9/bp/day) appeared to be higher than the rates in Syn sites (M122A: 11.3 × 10-9/bp/day and M122B: 11.2 × 10-9/bp/day) and in introns (M122A: 8.5 × 10-9/bp/day and M122B: 7.3 × 10-9/bp/day), these differences were not significant (P > 0.05 by Fisher's exact test) (Fig. 2).

Growth rate and sexual differentiation of the mutatorThe growth rate analysis revealed that two PbMut lines (M122A and B) proliferated in the mouse with a similar rate to those of PbCtl (C122) and PbWT (Supplementary Data). This result suggests that elimination of the proofreading activity of DNA polymerase d and the generated mutations did not affect asexual blood stage parasite growth. It seems likely that parasites with mutations deleterious to parasite survival were eliminated during the propagation of parasites in mice, and thus parasites that may have showed slow growth rate were masked under the present experimental conditions. Interestingly, M122A and M122B did not produce gametocytes, while C122 did (Supplementary Data). Consistently, neither exflagellation nor ookinete formation was observed in PbMut lines (Supplementary Data).4. DiscussionThe present study demonstrated that elimination of the proofreading activity of the P. berghei DNA polymerase d produced malaria parasites (malaria mutator) with a high mutation rate (86- to 90-fold higher mutation rate in PbMut vs. control PbCtl). The increased mutation rate in PbMut is comparable with a =60 time increase observed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.23 We consider this 86- to 90-fold higher mutation rate as a tentative one that needs to be refined by further investigation. In this study, only one parasite lineage each for PbCtl and PbMut was used to calculate the relative mutation rate. To obtain more accurate mutation rates in both PbCtl and PbMut, mutation rates from several lineages would be required.PbMut lines grew with a similar rate to those of PbCtl and PbWT lines (Supplementary Data). Because of this, it is unlikely that the 89–92 NonSyn mutations (and other mutations) in the PbMut lines were deleterious to parasite survival. Apart from genes with unknown function, most of the genes with NonSyn changes code for housekeeping functions but not proteins involved in immune evasion (Supplementary Data). These genes may well have had relaxed constraints, not seriously affecting parasite survival during the asexual blood stage. We identified five non-sense mutations in PbMut lines (Table 2), causing truncations in each gene. The truncation of these genes, likewise, appeared not to affect parasite growth, suggesting that expression of these genes may not be essential for the asexual blood stage development. This is the case for the ookinete protein gene (PBANKA_123360), which is not expressed at the blood stage (PlasmoDB). Previously, it was shown that knockout of the serine/threonine protein kinase gene (PBANKA_090380) was lethal, which suggested the importance of this gene during the asexual blood stage.36 However, the mutation detected in PbMut lines was located downstream of the protein's kinase domain, thus the kinase activity was probably not impaired in the truncated protein.Two indel mutations causing frameshifts were also detected: one in the phosphatidylinositol transfer protein gene (PBANKA_136380) and the other in the transcription factor gene with AP2 domain(s) (ApiAP2) (PBANKA_143750). The frameshift mutation at amino acid position 506 caused a truncation (1513 amino acids) in the Pleckstrin homology domain of the phosphatidylinositol transfer protein gene. This domain binds to phosphatidylinositol lipids, suggesting that the truncated protein lost its function. BLASTP search did not identify any homologue of PBANKA_136380 in PlasmoDB. Thus, the expression of the phosphatidylinositol transfer protein gene may not be essential during the asexual blood stage. The ApiAP2 gene is a member of the gene family of DNA binding transcription factor proteins and is involved in the regulation of gene expression at various stages of parasite development.37 The frameshift in the ApiAP2 gene caused an extension of the gene product (from 2339 to 2377 amino acids in non-mutated gene and frameshift-mutated gene, respectively). Recently, it was reported that two clones of gametocyte-deficient P. falciparum produced by piggyBac random mutagenesis were attributed to insertions in ApiAP2 gene.38 Notably, we did detect no gametocyte in PbMut lines at the 122nd mouse passage. The ApiAP2 gene which we identified is not orthologous to one that Ikadai et al. reported, but the APiAP2 family may function as a key molecule for sexual differentiation of Plasmodium parasites.Random mutagenesis using artificial mutagens such as alkylating agents or irradiation remains viable tools to generate malaria mutants. However, artificial mutagen-induced mutations are highly biased, e.g. G/C to A/T transition by ethyl methanesulfonate,25,39 A to T and T to A transversions by N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea,39 or pyrimidine dinucleotide-associated C to T transitions by UV or neutron irradiation.40 These biases may influence studies such as drug resistance and vaccine resistance, which should reproduce the actual mutants in the field. The mutations generated in the malaria mutator were probably generated during natural processes of DNA replication as the principle of the mutator relies on a defective proofreading activity of DNA polymerase d. Malaria parasites with identified DNA mismatch repair activities have been linked to drug-resistant parasites.41 Because of this, we believe that the malaria mutator system could be useful for reproducing drug resistance observed in the field. We have, in fact, generated mutator parasites resistant to sulfadoxine and could identify a NonSyn mutation in dihydropteroate synthase gene, a known target of the drug (data not shown). It would be interesting if we could also use the malaria mutator to demonstrate emergence of vaccine-resistant parasites similar to the mutator phenotype of the bacterial pathogen, Neisseria meningitidis, which rapidly became resistant to bactericidal antibody B5 and had a competitive advantage over a non-mutator strain.42Constructing the mutant library including various mutants will be useful to readily acquire novel phenotypes/traits. The analysed PbMut lines, however, shared a large proportion of variants, suggesting that the diverse population was not constructed after long-term passages in this study. Mouse passage by inoculating a large number of mutator parasites (e.g. 106 infected erythrocytes) and increasing passage lineages will serve to construct the mutant library. If this attempt improved the diversity of mutant library, more precise mutation hot spots might be identified by analysing the several number of mutant parasite lines.In the malaria mutator system, there is one limitation to overcome; unrelated mutations may be inevitably accumulated in the parasite during the propagation of parasites through mouse passages. Once the mutator parasite with a novel phenotype is isolated, accumulation of further unrelated mutations in the parasite must be stopped. Genetic crossing with the wild-type parasites can be used to replace the mutated DNA polymerase d with the wild-type enzyme. Also, genetic crossing will be useful to reduce extra mutations uninvolved in the phenotypes. Although PbMut lines at the 122nd mouse passage lost the ability of gametocyte formation, accumulation of deleterious mutations in genes essential for mosquito or liver stages will be suppressed by conducting a long-term mouse passage in combination with mosquito passage in the future. The candidate mutation(s) involved in novel phenotypes could be inferred with whole genome sequencing and/or linkage group selection.6 Furthermore, screening test with recent molecular technology like an artificial chromosome library could be useful to accelerate the identification of genes involved in novel phenotypes of interest.7,8 We believe that the mutator system could be useful for rapid generation of novel mutants, as rodent malaria parasites are ideally suited for ease with which the whole life cycle of Plasmodium asexual stage could be achieved. The characterization of the malaria mutator will also allow rapid correlation of sequence data with biological function.FundingThis work was supported by grant-in-aid for Scientific Research from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan (18073013, 24112705, and 24117504; http://www.mext.go.jp/english/) and from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Sciences (22406012, 23659211, 24590501, and 24790401; http://www.jsps.go.jp/english/), and a grant for research into emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan (H23-Shinkosaiko-ippan-014; http://www.mhlw.go.jp/english/).

IntroductionSecondary metabolites are an important resource for bioactive compounds, including lead compounds for new drugs, effective components of functional foods and chemical raw materials. Although a variety of secondary metabolites have been discovered primarily from actinomycetes, fungi and plants, a significantly larger number of secondary metabolites are thought to remain undetected due to the silencing of corresponding biosynthesis genes under the conditions used for screening.1–3The genes responsible for the biosynthesis of each secondary metabolite are often clustered in the genome.4 Furthermore, the basic structures of the known secondary metabolites are often synthesized by the so-called core genes, polyketide synthase (PKS), nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) and dimethylallyltryptophan synthase (DMAT). Thus, BLAST and Pfam searches for domains in polypeptides encoded by these genes have served as powerful means in identifying essential genes in secondary metabolism biosynthesis (SMB) gene clusters. Clust Scan and CLUSEAN identify core genes for SMB by searching the functional domains and motifs of PKS and NRPS.4,5 Other software tools, such as SMURF and antiSMASH, first identify the core genes using their motifs and then extend the flanking genes with homology to genes frequently found in the known SMB gene clusters, including hydroxylases, oxidases, methylases, transcription factors (typically Zn(II)Cys6 binuclear cluster types) and transporter genes.6,7 However, some SMB gene clusters, such as the oxylipin8 and kojic acid9 biosynthesis gene clusters, lack core genes in their clusters. These examples indicate the importance of devising a method for the prediction of SMB gene clusters without using the known motifs of the core genes.Recently, the development of next-generation sequencing technology has dramatically accelerated the sequencing of the genomes of diverse organisms. Even the genomes of filamentous fungi, which have relatively large genome sizes among microbes, can be accurately sequenced without reference genomes.10 The extremely high throughput and low cost of sequencing have increased the motivation to sequence the genomes of closely related species and even strains of the same species11 for detailed and comprehensive genome comparisons.In this study, we developed a novel method that applies a comparative genomics approach to predict SMB gene clusters, including those without core genes. This method depends on the characteristics of secondary metabolism genes, namely that they are highly enriched in non-syntenic blocks12 and are rarely orthologous even between clusters producing similar compounds due to generally high sequence diversity.13 Our method successfully predicted SMB gene clusters without using motif information from known genes in the SMB gene clusters. Through the optimization of the prediction parameters, we have also depicted the structural characteristics of the SMB gene clusters.2. Materials and methods2.1. Genome dataThe nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the genomes and deduced coding sequences, respectively, were retrieved from the following databases: Aspergillus flavus (accession no. EQ963472~EQ963493) and A. oryzae (accession no. AP007150~AP007177) from DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank DNA database; A. fumigatus, A. nidulans and A. terreus from the Aspergillus comparative database (http://www.broadinstitute.org/annotation/genome/aspergillus_group/MultiHome.html); Magnaporthe grisea from the Magnaporthe comparative database (http://www.broadinstitute.org/annotation/genome/magnaporthe_comparative/MultiHome.html); Chaetomium globosum from the Chaetomium globosum database (http://www.broadinstitute.org/annotation/genome/chaetomium_globosum); and Fusarium graminearum, F. oxysporum and F. verticillioides from the Fusarium comparative database (http://www.broadinstitute.org/annotation/genome/fusarium_group/MultiHome.html) at The Broad Institute. The gene IDs of GenBank was assigned to the genes annotated by Broad Institute by using BLASTP search.2.2. Algorithm overviewThe method for prediction of gene clusters devised in this study consists of three steps. The first step is to search pairwise similarity between the genes in the two genomes and to perform successive alignment detections of homologous genes (Fig. 1a and b). This step is based on the assumption that SMB gene clusters that produce compounds that are not identical but that have common basic structures have similar member genes. Low gap and mismatch penalties allow the detection of a gene cluster pair containing inversions and/or deletions in their gene members. The second step is to correct the boundary of the predicted gene cluster. This step is achieved by scoring homologous genes, considering genes outside but proximal to the predicted gene cluster (Fig. 1c and d). The third step is to enrich gene clusters with higher probability to function as SMB gene clusters via synteny analysis (Fig. 1e). Secondary metabolism genes are highly enriched on nonsyntenic blocks when the A. oryzae genome is compared with the genome of A. fumigatus or A. nidulans.12 Thus, of the gene clusters predicted in the prior step, those forming syntenic blocks can be eliminated (Fig. 1e).

Pairs of contiguous genes from ‘xi1’ to ‘xi8’ in genome 1 and from ‘yj1’ to ‘yj7’ represent an example identified as a seed for predicting a gene cluster (R0 or other seed regions). (c) The seed was extended until the prescribed length (Param3 = 35). The symbols lx and ly represent the numbers of genes added to the seed region of the first and the second genomes, respectively. X and Y represent extended clusters in the first and the second genomes, respectively. (d) The boundaries were corrected (Param4 = -1), and a pair of candidate gene clusters, ‘xi1’ through ‘xi8’ and ‘yj1’ through ‘yj8’, was identified. The symbols ibegin and iend represent the locations of the genes at the beginning and end, respectively, of the cluster in the first genome. The symbols jbegin and jend represent the corresponding gene locations in the second genome. The CB value is the sum of the maximum scores for the upstream and the downstream boundaries of a predicted cluster. The integers are indicated as an example for the particular alignment of clusters represented in this figure. (e) Synteny analysis was performed to distinguish the SMB gene cluster from the syntenic block (SB). The SB, a subset of X and Y, represents a set of genes aligned to create a contiguous block of orthologous gene pairs located within the defined distance between neighboring genes (Param5 = 10 kb). The above parameters are examples and not necessarily those used for the actual analyses.2.3. Identification of homologous and orthologous gene pairsPrior to comparing the order of genes between a pair of genomes, homologous gene pairs were identified in an amino acid homology search (Fig. 1a) using BLASTP14,15 with e-values (Param1) of 1.0e-5, 1.0e-10, 1.0e-15, 1.0e-30 or 1.0e-50 as thresholds. Orthologs were determined using the bidirectional best BLASTP hit method.2.4. Identification of the seed region pair for a gene clusterOther seeds were detected by a traceback of the same score matrix (see Supplementary Data). These seeds were subjected to the correction of boundaries in the next step. Gene cluster coordinates were also searched using the reverse orientation for one of the two genomes.2.5. Correcting gene cluster boundariesR0 and other seed regions, consisting of the genes xi (i1 = i = in) and yj (j1 = j = jm), may not have the correct boundaries as a gene cluster for various reasons, particularly when part of the cluster has a reversed orientation in the gene order. This reversal could be caused by a small inversion.In this study, by taking the actual, experimentally confirmed sizes of the clusters into consideration, the minimum number of homologous gene pairs was set to 3, and the values 15, 25, 35, 45, 55 and 65 were used for the maximum number of genes contained in a gene cluster (Param3).In this study, the values -0.1, -0.2, -0.3, -0.4, -0.5 and -1 were used as the negative penalty (Param4).2.6. Synteny analysisSecondary metabolism genes are highly enriched in nonsyntenic blocks.12 Secondary metabolism genes, which have high sequence diversity in general,13 are rarely orthologous in the comparison of genomes between two species. In contrast, syntenic blocks, in which genes existing across species commonly accumulate, have a high proportion of orthologs. Thus, candidate gene clusters that have a high probability of secondary metabolism biosynthesis genes can be selected by referring to their localization in nonsyntenic blocks (Fig. 1e).Orthologous gene pairs between X and Y were aligned to create contiguous blocks until no more orthologs were identified within the threshold range of the intergenic distances in both genomes (Fig. 1e). Contiguous blocks composed of at least two orthologs were defined as syntenic blocks (SBs). Non-orthologous genes inserted between orthologs were allowed within the threshold of an intergenic distance of 5, 10, 20, 30, 40 or 50 kb (Param5).SBs were subsets of extended seeds, X and Y. If the percentage of the member genes in the subset segment for the number of genes in the entire extended cluster was less than the threshold, the corresponding candidate gene cluster was selected as a predicted secondary metabolism gene cluster. In this study, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 and 35% were used as the thresholds for the SB percentage (Param6). Multiple predicted clusters overlapping each other were merged into a single cluster similarly to methods used in other SMB gene cluster prediction software.6,183. Results and discussion3.1. Effect of each parameter on the predictionTo detect SMB gene cluster candidates, the genome sequences of 10 species of filamentous fungi, including A. oryzae (see Materials and methods), were subjected to a comprehensive pairwise comparison, with the exception of between identical genomes. We first detected known SMB gene clusters from the genomes of A. flavus and A. fumigatus to optimize the parameters of our method. The clusters that the method predicted for the biosynthesis of aflatoxin and gliotoxin from A. flavus and for the biosynthesis of ergot, epipolythiodioxopiperazine-type toxin (ETP), fumitremorgin, gliotoxin, melanin, Pes1, pseurotin and siderophore from A. fumigatus, are listed in Table 1 and were subjected to the analysis of differences in boundary positions when compared with those from the experimentally confirmed clusters. Absolute values of the differences in gene numbers at the upstream and the downstream boundaries were summed to generate a value defined as the prediction error. The minimum error was obtained from all of the clusters predicted for each gene cluster, and the average of the minimum errors for the 10 gene clusters from A. flavus and A. fumigatus described above was then calculated at each value for the parameters. As shown in Fig. 2, a combination including Param1 = e-10, Param2 = -0.2 and Param4 = -0.3 gave the smallest errors for the prediction of the cluster boundaries. Param3 (extension length), Param5 (intergenic distance) and Param6 (permissible ratio of syntenic blocks) had little influence on the prediction of gene clusters within the range used in this study. Consequently, Param3 = 35 genes, Param5 = 10 kb and Param6 = 25% were used. Table 1.Known gene clusters predicted using this method Predicted gene cluster

The default values, except for the parameter indicated in each panel, were the same as those used in Fig. 3.To evaluate the performance of our method, we detected known SMB gene clusters using the genomes of 10 filamentous fungal species. Of the 24 gene clusters that have been identified to date, together with their corresponding products (Supplementary Data), 21 gene clusters were successfully detected with the optimized parameters described above (Table 1). The minimum and the maximum errors among all of the predicted gene clusters and the error for the cluster with the maximum CB value are also indicated. Figure 3 shows the effects of Param1, Param2 and Param4 on the number of known SMB gene clusters that were detected within the minimum error of 10 genes. The number of clusters increased by decreasing the stringency of Param1 and Param2 simply because of the increased sensitivity for seed detection. A similar increase in the detected clusters was observed in the detection performed with the A. fumigatus genome regardless of whether the clusters were previously known (Fig. 4a and b). In contrast, decreasing the stringency of Param4 resulted in a decrease in the number of detected clusters (Fig. 3c). This result was also observed for the detection of clusters with fewer member genes, i.e. <10 (Fig. 4c). Some gene clusters located within a short distance of each other in the genome were predicted as a merged single cluster of genes when a low stringency for Param4 was given. Accordingly, this low stringency led to an increase in the number of clusters with large cluster sizes (Fig. 4c). Figure 3.Open in new tabDownload slidePrediction of known gene clusters.

A decrease in the number of predicted clusters for a stringent Param2 and little change on the number by Param4, as shown above, indicated that a pair of gene clusters has similar gene contents in terms of sequence similarity, although the order of the genes might be partially rearranged, such as by inversion.3.2. Detailed analysis of successful and failed predictions of known gene clustersOf the 21 known SMB gene clusters predicted using our method (Table 1), some of the clusters were predicted by comparing two genomes belonging to different genera. For example, the gene clusters for the biosynthesis of aflatoxin in A. flavus and fumonisin in F. verticillioides were predicted by comparison with the M. grisea and A. fumigatus genomes, respectively. The SMB gene clusters appear to be composed of genes with common sequence characteristics, even between genomes from different species with phylogenetically extensive distances.Despite the high probability of detecting the known SMB gene clusters described above, the detection of clusters for Pes1, fusaric acid and asperthecin failed. The Pes1 and asperthecin biosynthesis gene clusters consisted of only two and three genes, respectively, and had little or no chance of having conserved homologous pairs longer than three genes in the same order in the genome. The fusaric acid biosynthesis gene cluster, which contains a total of five genes, included three genes that had unique sequences. Given the abovementioned reasons, ~12.5% of the known SMB gene clusters are thought to remain unpredicted. The kojic acid biosynthesis gene cluster, which consisted of three genes with only weak similarity to the genes sequenced to date, was successfully detected, although its cluster size was overestimated. It is thought that the existence of genes adjacent to a cluster with a high similarity to genes of a distantly related gene cluster led to the successful detection of this short gene cluster (Table 1).Considering the accuracy of detecting the known SMB gene clusters described above, the predicted unknown gene clusters without the core genes are highly likely to also be involved in SMB (see Supplementary Data, complete lists of predicted clusters from A. nidulans, A. fumigatus, A. flavus and A. oryzae). To further evaluate the probability of a relationship with SMB, the content of Q (secondary metabolism) genes in the euKaryotic Orthologous Groups (KOG) functional category was analyzed. The ratios of the Q genes in the predicted clusters and the remainder of the genes on nonsyntenic blocks from the A. fumigatus genome were 119/1,038 and 100/2,297, respectively. The successive statistical analysis of this result indicated enrichment for Q genes in the predicted clusters with a P-value of 10-13, which strongly suggested that the predicted unknown gene clusters were related to SMB regardless of the existence of core genes in the cluster.Interestingly, some known gene clusters were detected by comparison with the gene cluster that appeared to have little relationship except for the core structure of the products, such as polyketide, a nonribosomal peptide. For example, the A. nidulans asperfuranone biosynthesis and A. terreus lovastatin biosynthesis gene clusters (Fig. 5, Table 2) consisted of genes annotated as PKS, oxidoreductase and a transporter (Table 2). These gene clusters were aligned in the forward and reverse directions to create a seed (Fig. 5). Table 2.Examples of member genes in a predicted gene cluster GID

Properties of secondary metabolism genesWe devised a comparative genomics method for predicting SMB gene clusters by effectively utilizing the rapidly growing accumulation of genome sequences. In this study, we have successfully identified the known SMB gene clusters with a high probability (21 out of 24 clusters). The results indicate overall similarities in the amino acid sequences and/or the order of member genes between the pairs of gene clusters, including those involved in the biosynthesis of A. nidulans asperfuranone and A. terreus lovastatin, A. fumigatus fumitremorgin and F. verticillioides fumonisin and A. fumigatus melanin and F. graminearum aurofusarin.Secondary metabolism genes are highly enriched in the nonsyntenic blocks in a comparison of the genomes of three Aspergillus species.12 We have applied this observation to our method and have successfully identified various known SMB gene clusters from the genomes of the 10 fungal species, including those outside the genus Aspergillus. This observation indicates that the high enrichment of secondary metabolism genes in nonsyntenic blocks was conserved among various species for at least the 10 fungal species used in this study. However, SMB gene clusters producing common products in phylogenetically close species may often be syntenic, as previously shown in various reports, which has resulted in the failure of detection by comparisons of the corresponding clusters in the respective genomes. Typical examples of unsuccessful detections involved the combinations of SMB gene clusters for A. flavus aflatoxin and A. nidulans sterigmatocystin19,20 and F. verticillioides and F. oxysporum bikaverin cluster homologs.21 Similarly, horizontal transfer of a gene cluster may also result in unsuccessful detection of the cluster, even between species with large phylogenetic distances.19,21 An SMB gene cluster is known to consist of genes encoding proteins of particular characteristic functions, such as PKSs, NRPSs, Zn(II)2-Cys6 transcription factors,22 and major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporters.23 Significant enrichment of these genes allowed identification of SMB gene clusters, owing to the overall similarity among various clusters producing different compounds and between species with large phylogenetic distances. Our method, which first detected seeds by local gene alignments and successively corrected their boundaries using simple similarity searches independent of synteny, identified SMB gene clusters more efficiently than expected prior to this study, even though nonsyntenic blocks are known to have high diversity.24,25The previously reported methods predicted SMB gene clusters based on the sequence similarity of the core genes in the cluster, such as NRPS, PKS, a hybrid NRPS-PKS enzyme and DMAT.6,7,18 In contrast to these methods, our method does not depend on the presence of core genes. Due to this remarkable feature, the A. oryzae kojic acid biosynthesis gene cluster, which does not include core genes, was successfully predicted using this method. In contrast, there are also examples of missing predictions of known short SMB gene clusters, such as those responsible for the biosynthesis of asperthecin in A. nidulans and fusaric acid in F. verticillioides (Table 1). The inability to identify the gene clusters named above was due to the existence of an inversion in the former cluster and unique genes in the latter one, resulting in the failure of the local alignment of homologous gene pairs. In both cases, the short sizes of the clusters (three to five genes) prevented the remaining portions of the clusters from being identified. Similarly, intervention of a cluster by a horizontal gene transfer of another cluster (more than five genes), dividing the cluster into small segments,26 may also cause detection failure.In this study, many known SMB gene clusters were identified within 19 genes as errors for the maximum CB score, when error is defined as the sum of absolute differences of cluster margins at both ends. Because our method does not depend on gene order within the length of the cluster size for the correction of cluster boundaries, this observation strongly suggests that the genes inside and outside of the clusters have different sequence characteristics. Accordingly, the probability of homology between the genes inside the clusters from the two genomes is significantly higher than (i) the probability of homology between the genes outside the clusters or (ii) the probability of homology between the genes inside the clusters and the genes outside the clusters (P = 6.2 × 10–121, <U+03C7>2 test). In contrast, the cluster sizes of some gene clusters, e.g. the kojic acid biosynthesis gene cluster, were overestimated. This overestimation suggests two possibilities: (i) the two clusters were located side by side with few or no non-SMB genes in between or (ii) the gene cluster may be a part of the ancestral SMB gene cluster, with the remainder of the genes being presently inactive. In the cases of clusters with errors larger than 10 at the maximum CB value, such as the clusters for aflatoxin, terrequinone and pseurotin biosynthesis as well as kojic acid biosynthesis in Table 1, genes with characteristics of SMB genes were identified beyond the experimentally determined cluster margins.As described above, our method is a useful means to predict SMB gene clusters, particularly novel clusters without core genes; thus, this method has the potential to discover novel mechanisms of unknown SMBs. Two major problems of our method are that short gene clusters might not be detected in some cases and that the prediction of a cluster boundary might not always be accurate. Recently, a method for predicting accurate margins of SMB gene clusters by analyzing the co-expression of neighboring genes has been reported,27 with the condition that the gene indispensable for the SMB gene cluster is identified using the known sequence of the core gene. Therefore, the combination of our method and the expression analysis method described above could effectively compensate for the problems that currently exist in both methods. However, our method is essentially not applicable to SMB gene clusters that are unique to particular genomes. Nevertheless, of the 24 known SMB gene clusters on the 10 genomes used in this study, 21 clusters were identified via comprehensive pairwise comparisons. The problem of detecting ‘rare SMB gene clusters’ could be solved by increasing the number of genomes used for predictions. The acceleration of sequence accumulation due to the rapid development of sequencing technologies is expected to significantly increase our method's performance of in a short period of time. A comprehensive analysis of the distribution of secondary metabolism genes and motifs in translated polypeptides across diverse species, together with the structural analyses of corresponding compounds, will open a new era in the study of secondary metabolism.3.4.

IntroductionOligonucleotide composition varies significantly among species even with the same genome G+C% and designated as a ‘genome signature’, which characterizes the genomic sequences of individual species.1–3 Kohonen's self-organizing map (SOM) is a powerful tool for clustering high-dimensional complex data on one map.4,5 For codon and oligonucleotide compositions handled as high-dimensional data, we have modified the conventional SOM to BLSOM.6,7 BLSOMs for oligonucleotide compositions can classify genomic fragments (e.g. 100 kb) from a wide range of species according to species, without species information during the BLSOM calculation.8,9 BLSOM can also visualize diagnostic oligonucleotides responsible for the species-specific clustering, supporting an efficient knowledge discovery from a big sequence data.The present paper studies vertebrate genome signatures and their evolutionary changes with special focus on coelacanth. Coelacanth is one of the oldest known living Sarcopterygii and of the nearest living relatives of tetrapods.10 Therefore, analysis of this genome is believed to provide information concerning molecular evolutionary processes during the transition from fishes to tetrapods, and the genome of African coelacanth (Latimeria chalumnae) has recently been sequenced.11,12 Oligonucleotide BLSOM for genome sequences from a wide range of vertebrates, including the coelacanth, shows that CG suppression (i.e. under-representation of CG dinucleotide) is the highest among fishes and equivalent to that of tetrapods. The evident CG suppression in the mammalian genomes has been connected with the methylation at C in CG dinucleotide, which is a well-characterized epigenetic maker. Therefore, phylogenetic tree analyses on DNA methylases of fishes and tetrapods have been conducted. The classification and visualization power of the oligonucleotide BLSOM is very high and can efficiently unveil a wide range of genome characteristics from massive amounts of genomic sequences without prior knowledge, and therefore, this unsupervised data-mining method is a powerful and timely tool useful for genome studies in the era of big sequence data obtained from high-throughput DNA sequencers.2. Materials and methods2.1. BLSOMSOM is an unsupervised clustering algorithm that non-linearly maps high-dimensional vectorial data onto a two-dimensional array of lattice points.4,5 We previously modified the conventional SOM for genome informatics to make the learning process and resulting map independent of the order of data input, on the basis of batch-learning SOM (BLSOM).6,7 The initial weight vectors were defined by principal component analysis instead of random values, and BLSOM learning for oligonucleotide composition was conducted as described previously.8 The map size was chosen assuming that the average number of data per lattice point was 10. Diagnostic oligonucleotides for species-dependent separation were visualized as described previously.8 The BLSOM programme was obtained from takaabe@ie.niigata-u.ac.jp.2.2. SequencesCoelacanth genome sequences were obtained from http://coelacanth.nig.ac.jp, and other genome sequences were obtained from the UCSC ftp site (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/). When the number of undetermined nucleotides (Ns) in a fragment sequence (e.g. 100 kb) exceeded 20% of the sequence, the sequence was omitted from the analysis. In the case where the number of Ns was <20%, the oligonucleotide frequencies were normalized to the length without Ns and included in the analysis. Amino acid sequences of coelacanth Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b and Dnmt1 (GENE ID: R03136, A01856 and A13991) were obtained from the Coelacanth Genome Project (http://coelacanth.nig.ac.jp/).3. Results3.1. BLSOM for six fish genomesTo compare the coelacanth's genome signature with that of other fishes and to study molecular evolutionary mechanisms for the establishment of their signatures, we constructed BLSOMs with di-, tri- and tetranucleotide compositions in all 100-kb sequence fragments from six fish genomes, including the African coelacanth genome. The fishes other than coelacanth were chosen, since a major portion of their genomes was sequenced and registered in the International DNA Sequence Databanks (DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank) as complete or draft genome sequences. In the Databanks, only one strand of complementary sequences is registered, and the strand is chosen rather arbitrarily in the registration of fragment sequences (e.g. draft genome sequences). Our previous BLSOM analysis of a wide range of species7 revealed that sequences from a single genome often gave a mirror-symmetrical split on BLSOM in the vertical direction, e.g. according to the replicational direction of genomic fragments.13 When investigating the general characteristics of genome sequences such as genome signatures, differences between two complementary strands are not important. Furthermore, the obtained map should not be affected by the choice of strands registered to the Databanks. Therefore, we constructed a BLSOM, for which the frequencies of a pair of complementary oligonucleotides in each fragment were summed up (e.g. AAC and GTT; abbreviated as AAC+GTT).8 The BLSOM for this degenerate set of a pair of complementary di-, tri- and tetranucleotides is abbreviated as DegDi, DegTri and DegTetra. The DegTri is listed in Fig. 1A; other two are listed in Supplementary Fig. S1A and B. Lattice points containing sequences from a single species are coloured to indicate the species, whereas those containing sequences from multiple species are indicated in black. With no information concerning species during BLSOM calculation, species-specific clustering (self-organization) of the fragment sequences is clear; i.e. sequences from individual species have formed their own territories. The number of black lattice points on DegTri and DegTetra is smaller than on DegDi, showing their higher clustering power; for details of their differences (Fig. 1A). One of the basal characteristics of BLSOM separation for genomic sequence has been attributed previously to the G+C%.7,9,14 Sequences with higher or lower G+C% are located on the left or right side of the map (Supplementary Figs S1Aii and S4Aii), showing that the G+C% is reflected primarily in the horizontal direction.

Lattice points containing sequences from multiple species are indicated in black and those containing sequences from a single species are coloured as follows: coelacanth (), medaka (), stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus; ), fugu (), tetraodon () and zebrafish (). Lattice points containing no sequences after BLSOM calculation are indicated in white blank. 89, 95 and 97% of the sequences are located at the lattice points containing sequences from a single species (designated as pure lattice points) on DegDi, DegTri and DegTetra (see also Supplementary Fig. S1Ai and Bi). The separation of two closely related species, fugu and tetraodon, is rather poor especially on DegDi; therefore, black lattice points are evident for their territories (green for fugu and dark green for tetraodon). When these species belonging to Tetraodontidae are grouped into one category, 92, 97 and 98% of all fish sequences are located in the pure lattice points on DegDi, DegTri and DegTetra.

Lattice points are marked as described in Aii.BLSOM can visualize diagnostic oligonucleotides responsible for species-specific clustering (self-organization) and provides information concerning possible molecular evolutionary mechanisms for establishing the present genome signatures. For this visualization, we have previously developed a method to unveil diagnostic oligonucleotides in a way unaffected by a simple difference in G+C% of genomic sequences.8 After calculating the frequency of each oligonucleotide expected from the mononucleotide composition for each lattice point, the observed/expected ratio is indicated in red (over-represented) or blue (under-represented) (Fig. 1Aii and Supplementary Fig. S1Aiii and Bii).We focus on the oligonucleotides whose occurrence in coelacanth (red in Fig. 1Ai) differs from that in other fishes, i.e. the oligonucleotides, for which the transition between red and blue coincides with the border between the coelacanth's and the other fishes' territories in Fig. 1Aii. CCC+GGG is over-represented (red) only in the coelacanth territory; and CG-possessing trinucleotides are more under-represented in the coelacanth territory (dark blue) than in the other fishes' territories (pale blue). Importantly, all other CG-possessing trinucleotides (Supplementary Fig. S2A), as well as CG (Supplementary Fig. S1Aiii) and all CG-possessing tetranucleotides (Supplementary Fig. S2B), are more under-represented in the coelacanth territory (dark blue) than in the other fishes' territories (pale blue). This shows higher CG suppression in coelacanth than in other fishes; a numerical analysis of the CG suppression will be shown later.3.2. BLSOM for a broad phylogenetic range of vertebrate genomesOligonucleotide BLSOM for fish genomes shows that a notable characteristic of coelacanth distinct from other fishes is the highest CG suppression. Importantly, this finding can be obtained with no prior knowledge, showing a prominent ability of this unsupervised data-mining method in knowledge discovery. Once this type of information is obtained, we can focus on detailed research of the respective genome characteristics. A major mechanism for the evident CG suppression in the mammalian genomes has been connected with methylation at C in CG dinucleotide, which is followed by spontaneous deamination. As a result, CG steadily mutates to TG, resulting in CG suppression and in CA and TG over-representation. In the case of fish genomes, by analysing a wide range of animal genomes from various aspects, Simmen15 has found that their CG suppression is also accountable in terms of 5-methylcytosine mutation; in the study, the author has proposed the following four criteria which support the 5-methylcytosine mutation. (i) Genome-level CG suppression. (ii) Genome-level TG and CA excess. (iii) Positive correlation between the local CG relative abundance (i.e. the observed/expected ratio of CG) and the local G+C% level. This is because regions of high G+C content possess a higher DNA melting temperature than low G+C content regions, and therefore, these are less susceptible to strand separation, resulting in a lower rate of deamination and a lesser degree of CG suppression. (iv) Negative correlation between local relative abundance of CG and TG (CA). We have found that all four criteria are applicable to coelacanth (Supplementary Fig. S3), showing that a major mechanism for the CG suppression in coelacanth is related to the 5-methylcytosine mutation, as previously reported for other fishes.15Methylated C is a well-characterized epigenetic marker, and therefore, the highest CG suppression in coelacanth among fishes should be of particular interest in terms of evolutionary changes in epigenetic systems. We next included five additional vertebrate genomes covering a broad phylogenetic range of tetrapods, for which complete or draft genome sequences were available. On DegTri and DegTetra (Figs 1B and 2A), as well as DegDi (Supplementary Fig. S1C), for 100-kb sequences from the 11 vertebrate genomes, species-specific clustering is apparent. In Figs 1Bii and 2Aii, we mark the lattice points corresponding only to fish territories, which are located primarily in the lower part of the map.

(Cii) Lattice points containing only unique sequences are marked. (Ciii) Lattice points containing only repeat sequences are marked.The genomes of warm-blooded vertebrates are known to be composed of a long-range segmental G+C% distribution designated as ‘isochore’, which has been connected with chromosomal bands.16–20 A single genome, especially of a warm-blooded vertebrate, has multiple territories on DegTri [e.g. four chicken (Gallus gallus) territories marked in pink in Fig. 1Bi]. As previously mentioned, sequences with high or low G+C% are located on the left or right side of the map, and therefore, the split into several sub-territories in the horizontal direction should most likely relate to isochore structures.On DegTri and DegTetra, the suppression of CG-possessing oligonucleotides in coelacanth and tetrapods and the high occurrence of CC+GG-possessing oligonucleotides in coelacanth and most tetrapods except chicken are clear (Figs 1Biii and 2Aiii); other examples of diagnostic oligonucleotides for phylotype-dependent clustering are listed in Supplementary Fig. S4. It should also be noted that the oligonucleotides diagnostic for one species are primarily common among the sub-territories of the species, e.g. the characteristic over-representation of CCC+GGG in the tetrapods other than chicken is observed regardless of intra-genomic G+C% differences such as isochores of chicken (Fig. 1Biii). In addition to the characteristic occurrence of CG- and CC+GG-possessing tetranucleotides, phylotype-dependent characteristics that cannot be explained by the characteristics of the dinucleotide composition are observed on DegTetra, e.g. under-representation of GTCA+TGAC in coelacanth and tetrapods (Fig. 2Aiii). Such oligonucleotides' biological significance will be discussed later.3.3. Distinction between unique and repeat sequencesHigher eukaryote genomes are composed of unique and repeat sequences with different biological significances. Since repeat sequences usually have peculiar oligonucleotide composition, the composition in repeat sequences might be a major causal factor for genome signatures detected by the present oligonucleotide BLSOMs. This possibility is tested as follows. In the UCSC Genome Browser, repeat sequences identified by RepeatMasker and Tandem Repeats Finder (with a period of =12) are specified in lower-case letters to distinguish from unique sequences specified in upper-case letters. We thus separately constructed oligonucleotide BLSOMs for repeat and unique sequences of the 11 vertebrates; we first concatenated repeat and unique sequences separately and divided these artificially concatenated sequences into 100-kb fragments, followed by counting oligonucleotide composition. DegTri for unique sequences shows the clear species-specific separation (Fig. 2B), proving that their genome signatures are not the peculiar characteristics of oligonucleotide compositions in repeat sequences; the same finding was obtained on DegDi and DegTetra (data not shown). In Fig. 2Ci, unique plus repeat sequences have been analysed on one DegTri; using the same map, unique and repeat sequences are separately marked (Fig. 2Cii and iii). Clear separation is observed among species and between unique and repeat sequences, showing differential oligonucleotide compositions among these different categories.3.4. CG suppression in a wide phylogenetic range of vertebratesA difference in CG suppression observed among different lineages of vertebrates may relate to the differential features in epigenetic systems.21,22 Considering the fact that biologically important genome characteristics tend to be maintained stably during evolution, we analysed the CG suppression of many more vertebrates than those analysed with BLSOMs, because CG suppression can be analysed even if their contiguous sequences are rather short (e.g. shorter than 100 kb). Specifically, we analysed CG suppression for 44 vertebrate genomes covering a broad phylogenetic range. The CG/GC ratio (often called the CpG/GpC ratio) has long been used to examine CG suppression for individual species, because this ratio is not affected by the genome G+C% difference. Strictly speaking, however, this ratio should be affected by the possible species-specific GC dinucleotide occurrence. Therefore, the observed/expected ratio of CG (i.e. normalization with the occurrence level expected from the mononucleotide composition) was analysed (Fig. 3A); the species are arranged in descending order of the normalized CG level. Supporting the BLSOM results, the normalized CG level in coelacanth (0.31, arrowed) is clearly lower than in other fishes (indicated by a horizontal bar) and rather equivalent to that of a wide range of tetrapods, e.g. platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus; 0.38), X. tropicalis (Xenopus tropicalis; 0.35), cat (Felis catus; 0.33) and tenrec (Echinops telfairii; 0.30). It should also be mentioned that Marsupialia, such as tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii), wallaby (Macropus eugenii) and opossum (Monodelphis domestica), have a very low-CG occurrence (<0.14). Since the CG suppression has been evolutionarily conserved well within individual phylogenetic lineages, the CG suppression is thought to relate to fundamental biological functions. Similar results are found for the aforementioned CG/GC ratio (Supplementary Fig. S5A). Supplementary Fig. S5A also shows that the evident CG suppression of coelacanth among fishes is observed in both unique and repeat sequences. Supplementary Fig. S5B and C shows that CA/AC and TG/GT ratios of coelacanth are higher than those of other fishes and equivalent to most of tetrapods, as expected from the mechanism responsible for the CG suppression; CA and TG over-representation.

(A and B) The occurrence level of CG and of CC+GG normalized with the level expected from the mononucleotide composition. The species are arranged in descending order of the normalized CG level. The data for coelacanth is arrowed and those for other fishes are indicated by a horizontal bar.CpG islands, which belong to the unique sequence category, have been connected with transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. Figure 4 analysed the CG level in the sequences within and outside CpG islands, which were identified by ‘newcpgreport’ (http://emboss.sourceforge.net/apps/cvs/emboss/apps/newcpgreport.htm). The CG level outside CpG islands varies significantly among fishes and the coelacanth has the lowest CG level, as reflecting its global genome characteristics. In contrast, the CG level within CpG islands is rather similar among fishes including coelacanth. This level varies significantly among tetrapods; the level of lizard is similar to that of coelacanth, but those of chicken, mouse and human are clearly higher than that of coelacanth. This difference observed even between closely related species may reflect the difference in actual detailed molecular mechanisms in the transcriptional regulation. The higher CG suppression outside CpG islands (Fig. 4B) is consistent with the hypothesis that hypermutation of methylated C is the main cause of higher CG suppression in coelacanth, because methylation of C generally occurs outside CpG islands. CG occurrence within and outside CpG islands for 11 vertebrate genomes analysed in Fig. 2.CG occurrence within and outside CpG islands for 11 vertebrate genomes analysed in Fig. 2.3.5. DNA methylase genesThe CG occurrence in lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) is the highest (0.78) and rather similar to a level of the very slightly methylated genome of drosophila (Drosophila melanogaster),23,24 but significantly differs from medaka (Oryzias latipes; 0.46) (Fig. 3A). This wide range of CG suppression among fishes indicates that various changes in DNA-methylation and -demethylation systems have occurred during the fish lineage evolution. Taking this into account, we next consider the possible molecular mechanisms responsible for the highest CG suppression of coelacanth among fishes. Since CG suppression in vertebrate genomes is believed to relate to methylation at CG dinucleotide, we first compared de novo DNA methylases found in the coelacanth genome with those of other fishes and tetrapods; de novo DNA methylases are responsible for the new addition of a methyl group to DNA. As opposed to the two catalytically active de novo DNA methylase genes (dnmt3a and dnmt3b) of mammals, zebrafish (Danio rerio) is known to have six de novo DNA methylase genes and lacks dnmt3l which is catalytically inactive but required for the establishment of genomic imprinting.25,26 It is also known that the expression pattern of zebrafish dnmt6 and dnmt8, which more closely resemble mammalian dnmt3a in amino acid sequence, more closely resembles that of mammalian dnmt3a than dnmt3b, but the expression pattern of the other four zebrafish genes (dnmt3, dnmt4, dnmt5 and dnmt7) resembles the pattern of mammalian dnmt3b, i.e. dnmt6 and dnmt8 have been shown to more ubiquitously express in developing and adult tissues than the other four zebrafish genes.27In the coelacanth genome, we can find two dnmt3 genes (dnmt3a and dnmt3b) as observed for mammals but no dnmt3l as observed for zebrafish. Using multiple sequence alignment (MUSCLE) in Mega6,28 phylogenetic analyses of coelacanth Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b were conducted at a protein-sequence level (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S6). All three programmes (maximum likelihood, minimum evolution and neighbour-joining) show that the coelacanth Dnmt3a is clustered with tetrapods' Dnmt3a, but not with other fishes' Dnmt3a. In the case of Dnmt3b, maximum likelihood shows that the coelacanth Dnmt3b is clustered with tetrapods' Dnmt3b as observed for Dnmt3a (Fig. 5), but minimum evolution and neighbour-joining show it to be outside of tetrapods' and other fishes' clusters (Supplementary Fig. S6). In the case of Dnmt1, which preferentially methylates hemimethylated DNA for maintaining the methylation pattern in the newly synthesized strand, all three programmes show the coelacanth Dnmt1 to be outside of tetrapods' and other fishes' clusters (Fig. 6). Phylogenetic tree of Dnmt3 constructed with maximum likelihood. Nine hundred and fifty amino acid sites are used for the tree inference and the tree is unrooted. A bootstrap value is presented above each branch. The scale is proportional to the number of substitutions per amino acid.Phylogenetic tree of Dnmt3 constructed with maximum likelihood.

One thousand five hundred and twenty amino acid sites are used for the tree inference and the tree is unrooted. A similar tree was obtained with neighbour-joining and minimum evolution (data not shown).The difference found among these three methylases, which have differential biological functions, may indicate the differential level of contribution to the CG suppression during evolution; the ubiquitously expressed de novo methylase Dnmt3a may have contributed most significantly to the evident CG suppression in coelacanth. For the adequate understanding of CG suppression, however, additional molecular mechanisms such as RNA-directed DNA methylation29 and DNA-demethylation systems have to be considered. Since the CG-suppression level has stably been conserved phylogenetically (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S5), analyses of this level from various aspects may provide novel knowledge about fundamental biological mechanisms related to epigenetics.3.6. Oligonucleotides unrelated to CGIf we know in advance that a fundamental characteristic of the coelacanth genome distinct from other fishes is related to CG suppression, a simple analysis of dinucleotide composition should be enough to prove this characteristic. However, when we have not such background knowledge, an unsupervised data-mining method such as the present BLSOM becomes valuable because it can unveil a wide range of characteristics hidden in the genome sequence. Actually, the occurrence of various CG-non-possessing oligonucleotides in coelacanth was found distinct from that in other fishes, but equivalent to that in almost all tetrapods. A clear example is the over-representation of (CC+GG)-possessing tri-and tetranucleotides on DegTri and DegTetra (Figs 1Biii and 2Aiii). Figure 3B presents the observed/expected ratio of CC+GG in 44 vertebrate genomes, and Supplementary Fig. S7A and B presents the results for CCC+GGG and CCCC+GGGG. As observed on BLSOMs (Fig. 1Aii and Biii, and Supplementary Fig. S1Aiii, Bii and Ciii), their occurrences in coelacanth are clearly higher than in other fishes. The same is true for most tetrapods, including Marsupialia but excluding chicken and turkey (Meleagris gallopavo). It should also be noted that the occurrence of CCCC+GGGG in coelacanth is the highest among the vertebrates analysed (Supplementary Fig. S7B).4. DiscussionThe genome characteristics maintained stably in a certain phylogenetic lineage should reflect its fundamental biological significance. An apparent causative factor for the genome signature is the context-dependent DNA mutation and repair mechanisms. It should also be mentioned that the oligonucleotides longer than tetranucleotides often represent motif sequences responsible for sequence-specific protein binding (e.g. transcription factor binding). The occurrence of such motif oligonucleotides should differ from the level expected from the mononucleotide composition in the respective genome and may differ among genomic portions within one genome. We have recently found that DegPenta- and DegHexa-BLSOMs for the human genome can effectively detect characteristic enrichment of many transcription factor-binding motifs in pericentric heterochromatin regions.30 The present study has found evident CG suppression and CC+GG over-representation in coelacanth and tetrapods, by using DegDi, DegTri and DegTetra. If the BLSOM analysis extends to oligonucleotides longer than tetranucleotides, we may assign in silico the oligonucleotides with important biological functions such as transcription factor-binding in the genome of coelacanth and other species, for which experimental studies other than DNA sequencing have been poorly done.BLSOM can analyse big sequence data such as millions of sequences simultaneously31 and, therefore, can analyse genome sequences from a wide range of species and visualize characteristics of their oligonucleotide composition on a single map. This can support an efficient knowledge discovery from the big data with no prior knowledge. Pointing out the oligonucleotides whose occurrence is peculiar commonly (and thus stably) in a certain lineage should provide information concerning biological roles of these oligonucleotides in the lineage. In conclusion, BLSOM is a powerful and timely tool useful for genome studies in the era of big sequence data obtained from high-throughput DNA sequencers.Conflict of Interest statement.

IntroductionOur gastrointestinal tract provides residence to the intestinal microbiota, which includes both beneficial and potentially pathogenic microorganisms.1,2 It has been postulated that an imbalance in the composition of the microbiota is a risk factor in several human disorders, including inflammatory bowel disease, metabolic syndrome, allergy and cancer.3–5 Furthermore, recent reports have shown that even minor changes in the gut microbiome can have an impact on the host phenotype.6,7 Thus, the ability to shape the intestinal microbiota should have clinical importance.The mucosal surface of the intestine is continuously exposed to an enormous variety of antigens, such as food antigens and microorganisms. Immunoglobulin A (IgA) plays important roles in the mucosal immune system, and it has been shown that the production of IgA is limited in germ-free mice compared with conventional mice.8 In addition, microbial colonization is required for secretory IgA (SIgA) production in the intestine.9,10 In studies of gnotobiotic mice, it was shown that colonization by microbes, particularly segmented filamentous bacteria, clostridia and Bacteroides species, stimulates production of IgA.11,12 However, it is still unclear what molecule(s) produced by/derived from commensal microbes induce(s) mucosal IgA production.Prebiotics are defined as food ingredients that are non-digestible and non-absorbable in the upper gastrointestinal tract and which improve the condition of the host through selective stimulation of the growth of probiotic bacteria.13 Fructooligosaccharide (FOS) is a well-known prebiotic that has anti-tumor,14 infection-protective15 and allergy-preventive effects16 in the host through host–microbial crosstalk in the gut. The impact of FOS intake on the intestinal IgA response has been extensively studied in mouse models. The concentration of IgA in the small and large intestines is significantly increased with FOS intake.17 Furthermore, the number of B220+ IgA+ cells in Peyer's patches is significantly increased, and the level of secretory component and SIgA in the ileal gut lumen is elevated. It has also been shown that FOS intake enhances production of cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-5, IL-6 and interferon-<U+03B3>, in Peyer's patches; these cytokines can induce IgA production through their effects on CD4+ helper T cells, which further increases the amount of IgA in the mucosa.18In humans, ulcerative colitis patients supplemented with Bifidobacterium longum and oligofructose-enriched inulin showed improvement in the clinical features of chronic inflammation,19 and daily intake of oligofructose and inulin significantly decreased Crohn's disease activity.20 Supplementation with FOS has also been shown to support the growth of Bifidobacterium species, accompanied by an increase in T lymphocytes.21 Some studies have also reported a tendency for prebiotics-treated individuals to have higher faecal SIgA levels.22,23 Although commensal microbiota have been implicated in the FOS-induced production of IgA, evaluation of the gut microbial ecosystem is not an easy task, mainly due to its highly complex composition and the large individual difference among human subjects.22We have developed a meta-analysis platform based on a multi-dimensional profiling technique to evaluate gut environmental changes, including host–microbial crosstalk.24 In order to understand the molecular mechanisms for the induction of IgA production in human subjects by FOS supplementation through gut microbes and/or their metabolite(s), we applied the multivariate microbe–metabolite correlation analysis combined with faecal IgA secretion of the host to evaluate the inter- and intraindividual changes in the gut ecosystem occurring with FOS supplementation. Here, we show a significant correlation of faecal IgA content with microbial composition and metabolites, and further implicate the likely involvement of particular metabolites in FOS-induced IgA secretion.2. Materials and methods2.1. Faecal sample collectionSeven volunteers including three males and four females (20–30 year olds) from different families in Japan participated in this study (Supplementary Data). All subjects were informed of the purpose of this study. This study was approved by the ethical committee of RIKEN, and written consent was obtained from all subjects. All subjects had no medical history of gastrointestinal or metabolic diseases, nor had they had special dietary habits or restrictions, herbal supplements, probiotics or antibiotics within at least 1 month before the sampling. For 1 week, the volunteers ate FOS, 10 g twice a day (Meioligo W, Meiji Kabusiki Kaisya). Faecal sampling was performed at least twice during each period (before FOS intake, during FOS intake and after FOS intake). Faecal samples from each individual were immediately frozen on collection and stored at -80°C before analysis.2.2. Measurement of faecal IgA by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assayFaecal samples were lyophilized by using VD-800R lyophilizer (VD-800R, Tokyo, Japan) for 24 h. Freeze-dried faeces were ground with 3.0-mm Zirconia Beads (Biomedical Science, Tokyo, Japan) using a Shake Master (Biomedical Science) for 10 min. About 10 mg of faecal samples were measured and suspended into 300 µl of phosphate-buffered saline buffer containing proteinase inhibitor cocktail tablets: complete EDTA-free (Roche Applied Science, USA), and homogenized for 1 min. The homogenate was centrifuged at 17,800 × g for 15 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was collected and frozen at -20°C. The amount of faecal IgA was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). To measure total IgA, the wells of a Maxisorp immunoplate (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) were coated with goat anti-mouse IgA (A90-103A, Bethyl Laboratories, Inc., USA). After blocking of unoccupied sites on the plastic with bovine serum albumin, the test samples and standard mouse IgA (mouse reference serum; RS10-101, Bethyl Laboratories, Inc.) were added. Subsequently, bound IgA was detected by sequential incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgA antibodies (A90-103P, Bethyl Laboratories, Inc.) (1 mg/ml), and 3,3',5,5'-tetramethyl benzidine (TMB) (Organon Teknika, Durham, NC, USA) (1 mg/ml) and 1 : 10,000 hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Japan) in sodium acetate buffer (pH 6.0). After incubation at room temperature for 15 min, colour development was stopped by adding 100 µl of 0.18 M sulphuric acid (H2SO4, Wako Pure Chemical Industries), and then the absorbance at 450 nm of each well was measured. The total IgA content of each sample was calculated by means of a standard curve.2.3. Faecal DNA extractionAbout 10 mg of freeze-dried faecal sample was suspended with mixture buffer [400 µl of 10% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS)/10 mM Tris–HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0 solution, 400 µl of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25 : 24 : 1), and 200 µl of 3 M sodium acetate]. Faeces in mixture buffer were disrupted with 0.1 mm zirconia/silica beads (BioSpec Products, Inc., USA) by vigorous shaking (1500 rpm, for 10 min) using a Shake Master (Biomedical Science). After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min at room temperature, the DNA was purified using a phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25 : 24 : 1) solution and was precipitated by adding ethanol and sodium acetate, and stored at -20°C.2.4. 454 barcoded pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA geneThe V1–V2 variable region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified by PCR using forward primer (5'-CCATCTCATCCCTGCGTGTCTCCGACTCAGNNNNNNNNNNagrgtttgatymtggctcag-3') containing the 454 primer A and reverse primer (5'-CCTATCCCCTGTGTGCCTTGGCAGTCTCAGtgctgcctcccgtaggagt-3') containing the 454 primer B.25 Forward primers were tagged with 10 bp unique barcode labels at the 5' end along with the adaptor sequence (indicated in N). Each reaction mixture contained 10 pmol of each primer, 0.16 mM deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates, 25 µl of 2xEx Taq PCR buffer, 1.0 U Ex Taq polymerase (Takara Bio, Inc., Shiga), 50 ng extracted DNA and sterilized water to achieve a final volume of 50 µl. PCR program was set as follows: 96°C 2 min and 20 cycles of 96°C 30 s, 55°C 45 s, 72°C 1 min followed by 72°C for 10 min. After confirmation of the PCR product formation using agarose gel electrophoresis, purified by AMPure XP magnetic purification beads (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Brea, CA, USA), and quantified using the Quant-iT PicoGreen ds DNA Assay Kit (Life Technologies Japan, Ltd, Tokyo, Japan). Mixed samples were prepared by pooling approximately equal amounts of PCR amplicons from each sample and subjected to 454 GS FLX Titanium or 454 GS JUNIOR (Roche Applied Science) sequencing according to the manufacturer's instructions.2.5. Analysis of 16S rRNA sequences using the QIIME pipeline16S rRNA sequence data were processed by the quantitative insights into microbial ecology (QIIME) pipeline.26 Briefly, sequences that were less than 200 bp or greater than 1000 bp in length contained incorrect primer sequences, or contained more than 2 ambiguous bases were discarded. The remaining sequences were assigned sample aliquots based on their unique nucleotide barcodes, including error-correction. Chimeric sequences were removed using Usearch.27 Reads removed in these filters were ~42% of all sequences (Supplementary Data). All filter-passed reads of the 16S V1–2 sequences were deposited in DDBJ with accession number DRA001212. Sequences were clustered into Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) using 97% sequence similarity. OTUs were assigned to a taxonomy using RDP classifier with the confidence level set at 0.5.282.6. Sample extraction for NMR measurementsFaecal samples (10 mg) were measured and suspended with extraction buffer consisting of 90% (v/v) deuterium oxide (D2O), 100 mM potassium phosphate and 1 mM 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulphonate (DSS) as an internal standard. The solution was shaken at 1500 × g for 15 min at 65°C and then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C. The supernatant was collected in an NMR tube and frozen at -20°C.292.7. 1D and 2D NMR measurementsAll NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DRX-700 spectrometer operating at 1H 700.153 MHz frequency with the temperature of the NMR samples maintained at 298 K. The NMR spectra were processed using a procedure similar to that described previously.30–33 Briefly, 1H NMR data were reduced by subdividing spectra into sequential bins of 0.04 ppm designated regions between 1H chemical shifts of 0.06–9.8 ppm. 1H-13C heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) data were reduced by subdividing spectra into sequential bins of 0.3 ppm in the f1 direction and 0.03 ppm in f2 designated regions between 1H chemical shifts of 0.5–9.0 ppm and 13C chemical shifts of 40–90 ppm, respectively. After exclusion of water resonance, each region was integrated and normalized relative to the DSS intensity and analysed by principal component analysis (PCA) using the R software and plotted using the Excel software. Loading plot analysis revealed the contribution of bins to the PCA scores, and 2D spectral assignments were performed using the SpinAssign software.332.8. Multivariate statistical analysisSupplementary Data provides a schematic overview of the analytical steps in this study. Multivariate statistical analysis was performed with R program environment by using an in-house program. A two-dimensional correlation map was calculated as a symmetric matrix using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, in which an element at position (i, j) is defined as a correlation coefficient between the ith and jth positions in each set of 1D spectra of metabolites, microbial diversity of high-throughput sequencing and the amount of IgA. A more positive (negative) coefficient means the existence of a positive (negative) correlation between the ith and jth peaks or bands. Each correlation pattern was clustered using hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA). HCA was performed using a Euclidean distance and ward clustering method. The two-dimensional correlation map was drawn by the R software.29In the heat map of microbe–metabolite correlation coefficient, individual ID number was put as a tag in front of each microbe name (at the family level) to clarify the individual from whom those microbes were isolated (for example, ID4-Bacteroidaceae). Correlation coefficient between microbial composition and metabolic profile was calculated in each individual, and the data obtained from individuals were merged. Microbe–metabolite correlation pattern was clustered using HCA. HCA of the metabolic profiles in individual ID-coded microbes reveals several metabolic profile clusters that were related to different microbes. Clusters of metabolic profiles defined by cutting branches off the dendrogram. We selected clusters in which more than 70% of microbes were derived from IgA responders ID4 and ID5.IgA–metabolite–microbe correlation network was constructed with microbes in extracted clusters, based on the multiple correlation data from ID4 and ID5 using the Cytoscape software34 (http://www.cytoscape.org/). Each node indicated IgA, a metabolite and a microbe from the result of the above analysis. Microbial node size showed the average value of relative abundance. Edges represent the correlation coefficient >0.65 between the two connected nodes in the network. Width of each edge line positively correlates with its correlation coefficient value.3. Results and discussion3.1. FOS effect on faecal IgA concentration is heterogeneous in different healthy human volunteersFaecal samples were collected at several time points from healthy volunteers (age = 20–30, male = 3, female = 4) before, during and after FOS intake, and the amount of faecal IgA was determined. As a group, the average faecal IgA tended to increase upon FOS intake, but the difference was not statistically significant (Fig. 1A). However, the individual faecal IgA profiles were quite heterogeneous (Fig. 1B and Supplementary Data); especially, only in volunteers ID4 and ID5, the faecal IgA levels were significantly elevated during the FOS-intake period when compared with those in other periods. Therefore, the effect of FOS on IgA induction varies widely among individuals. Figure 1.Open in new tabDownload slideEffect of FOS supplementation on total faecal IgA production in human volunteers.

Commensal microbiota composition varies greatly among individualsWe hypothesized that the effect of FOS intake on faecal IgA levels was likely influenced by individual differences in the composition of the gut microbiota. To determine whether this was the case, PCR products of bacterial 16S rRNA-encoding genes in the faecal DNA samples were analysed using high-throughput pyrosequencing. A total of 222,863 reads were sequenced, averaging at 3537 reads per sample. Indeed, the heat maps of the individual microbial profiles at the family level looked quite different from each other (Fig. 2A). Consistently, the unweighted UniFrac PCoA of faecal microbiota clustered the faecal DNA samples from the same individuals (Fig. 2B), rather than from the samples with and without FOS intake (Fig. 2C), indicating that FOS-induced microbiota variations are overlooked because of the large interindividual variations when datasets from individuals are collectively analysed (Fig. 2D and Supplementary Data).

Three human enterotypes can be distinguished by differences in microbial composition.36 These enterotypes are not altered by short-term diet changes.37 Consistent with this stability, FOS did not alter the major composition of the intestinal microbiota in individuals in this study (Fig. 2B and C).3.3. Faecal metabolic profiles are distinctive among individualsWe also examined the individual faecal metabolic profiles before, during and after FOS intake, since prebiotic FOS-induced metabolic changes in the gut ecosystem could result in the modification of IgA production. To this end, faecal metabolites were extracted from the faecal samples and measured by 1H NMR spectroscopy. The heat map of the obtained 1H NMR spectra divided into bins showed similar interindividual metabolic changes upon FOS intake (Fig. 3A). Nevertheless, the PCA of these metabolic profiles showed a tendency towards individual clustering (Fig. 3B), rather than being clustered according to the presence or absence of the FOS supplementation (Fig. 3C). These observations are consistent with a previous study, reporting that 1H NMR-based metabolomics of urine and serum show individual differences.38,39Figure 3.Open in new tabDownload slideEffect of FOS supplementation on faecal metabolites.

Score plots are coloured by individuals (B) and shaded by diet periods (C).Taken together with the data on microbiota composition described above (Fig. 2), these results indicate that interindividual differences are too large for population analyses such as PCA to extract significant parameters contributing to the FOS-induced differences, and that intraindividual analysis could instead reveal the mechanisms for the effect of FOS on IgA production in humans. Thus, the individual difference in the effect of FOS on faecal IgA concentration could be due to the individual differences in their gut microbiota and/or metabolites.3.4. Intraindividual correlation analyses among commensal microbiota composition, faecal metabolic profiles and faecal IgA concentration reveal microbial and metabolic changes related to enhanced faecal IgA levelsTo evaluate intraindividually the impact of FOS intake on gut microbiota composition in the absence of the interindividual differences, we performed individual PCA (Supplementary Data). The data revealed that FOS intake caused changes in microbiota composition in each individual, but that these changes were different from individual to individual. We also evaluated the influence of FOS intake on the individual faecal metabolic profile, by performing PCA individually (Supplementary Data). Similar to the changes observed in the microbiota, FOS also induced faecal metabolic changes in each individual.In order to obtain more integrated information about the effect of FOS intake on IgA production, we next performed intraindividual two-dimensional correlation analyses to link the commensal microbial variation, the faecal metabolic profile and the amount of faecal IgA. The coefficient of correlation for each individual gut environmental factor was calculated using the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, and the correlative information was clustered individually by HCA to seek the covariation factor(s) that related to the induction of faecal IgA production (Fig. 4). The microbe–IgA correlation analysis showed that the commensal microbiota composition co-varied strongly with the individual faecal IgA production profile (Fig. 4A). HCA on the microbe–IgA correlation patterns from seven volunteers showed that the profile from ID3 and ID7 was strikingly distinct from the others. This might result from an apparently abnormal IgA profile in ID3 in that the faecal IgA levels were extremely low during and after FOS intake (Supplementary Data). In addition, microbiota composition in ID7 is a different from the other individuals (Fig. 2B). In the metabolite–IgA correlation analysis, we found that the correlation patterns were divided into two groups; ID4 and ID5 were grouped together and separated from the others (Fig. 4B). As described above, the amount of IgA was significantly increased during FOS intake only in ID4 and ID5, suggesting that the change in metabolites common to ID4 and ID5, but not to the other individuals, may contribute to their FOS-induced increase in faecal IgA. 1H chemical shifts revealed by this analysis to be common in ID4 and ID5 are listed in Supplementary Data.

The correlation similarity among individuals was further clustered by HCA.To analyse the relationship between microbiota and faecal metabolites before, during and after FOS intake, we performed microbe–metabolite correlation analysis (Fig. 5A). Characteristic correlation patterns were represented as the phenolic region (around 6.5–8.5 ppm). Based on the HCA, the correlation patterns divided the microbiota into 11 bacterial clusters. Faecal bacteria from each individual contributed differently to these clusters (Fig. 5B); intriguingly, Clusters 1, 6 and 8 consisted of the microbes derived predominantly from ID4 and ID5 (>70%). The result showed that these microbes were closely related to Rikenellaceae, Bifidobacteriaceae, S24-7, Peptostreptococcaceae, Barnesiellaceae, Mogibacteriaceae, Pasteurellaceae, Veillonelaceae, Coriobacteriaceae, Clostridiaceae, Alcaligenaceae, Desulfovibrionaceae and Pasteurellaceae at the family level (Supplementary Data). Major OTUs in these microbial families were assigned using BLAST against non-redundant database (Supplementary Data). Supplementary Data lists the 1H chemical shifts of metabolites correlated with these clusters which were commonly seen in ID4 and ID5.

Assignment of the candidate metabolites involved in the induction of faecal IgA productionComparison of metabolites correlated with IgA and microbes shared in ID4 and ID5 (Supplementary Data) revealed that some of the 1H chemical shifts were commonly extracted from both the microbe–metabolite correlation and the metabolite–IgA correlation. These metabolites were assigned by two-dimensional J-resolved (2D-J) spectroscopy, 1H-13C HSQC and total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY),40 as well as according to the literature41–43 and the PRIME website44 (Supplementary Data). Metabolites that showed a positive correlation with increased IgA were identified as l-phenylalanine (3.30 and 7.42 ppm), l-lysine (1.70 and 3.02 ppm), tyramine (6.90 ppm) and butyrate (2.14 ppm); and p-cresol (6.82 and 7.10 ppm) was negatively correlated with IgA levels. The molecular network around IgA based on these results is shown in Fig. 6. Taken together, our results suggest that these bacteria in clusters are directly or indirectly involved in the metabolism of these molecules, an activity that may ultimately result in the up-regulation of faecal IgA production in the gut of ID4 and ID5.

Microbe 1: ID4 Rikenellaceae, 2: ID5 Bifidobacteriaceae, S24-7, 3: ID5 Peptostreptococcaceae, 4: ID4 Barnesiellaceae, Mogibacteriaceae, Pasteurellaceae and ID5 Clostridiaceae, 5: ID4 Veillonelaceae, Coriobacteriaceae, 6: ID5 Pasteurellaceae, 7:ID5 Desulfovibrionaceae.In this study, a positive correlation of l-lysine, l-phenylalanine, tyramine and butyrate, and a negative correlation of p-cresol, were found with the FOS intake-induced increase in faecal IgA, using the combination of microbe–metabolite and metabolite–IgA correlation analyses (Fig. 6). Consistent with our observations, it has been reported using in vitro experiments that human intestinal contents with live commensal microbes metabolize FOS into butyrate and tyramine.45Bifidobacterium preferentially utilize FOS as an energy source to produce lactate and acetate. Bifidobacterium themselves do not generally produce butyrate,46 but other commensal microbes can produce butyrate from acetate and lactate produced by Bifidobacterium.47,48 It has also been reported that both lactate and acetate can be converted to butyrate by human faecal microbes in vitro.49Tyramine is a decarboxylation product of tyrosine, and two types of tyrosine metabolic pathways exist in commensal microbes. One pathway produces p-cresol,35,50 while the other produces tyramine.51,52 Our data showed that tyramine and p-cresol were positively and negatively correlated with IgA production, respectively, in FOS responders ID4 and ID5, suggesting that FOS intake may impact the microbiota composition to change the tyrosine metabolic pathways in favour of tyramine production in the gut ecosystem of FOS responders.It has been reported that an important function of phenylalanine is to up-regulate the expression of GTP cyclohydrolase I, which is the first and rate-controlling enzyme for the synthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin, an essential cofactor for nitric oxide synthase (NOS). Consequently, an adequate intake of dietary phenylalanine is required to maintain a sufficient provision of tetrahydrobiopterin for the production of NO by inducible NOS (iNOS) in activated macrophages and other leucocytes.53 Moreover, an inadequate intake of dietary lysine reduces antibody responses and cell-mediated immunity.54 By sharing the same transport systems with arginine, the availability of dietary or extracellular lysine can modulate the entry of arginine into leucocytes and NO synthesis by iNOS.53 iNOS is expressed mainly in macrophages and dendritic cells, which produce NO upon stimulation with cytokines and bacterial components. Recent investigations have demonstrated that IgA production is decreased in iNOS-/- mice.55 Therefore, these amino acids may be involved in the induction of IgA production through NO production.3.6. ConclusionIn the present study, our intraindividual, multiple time point correlation analyses showed that enhancement of faecal IgA levels by FOS supplementation correlates with changes in the intestinal metabolites, likely produced by commensal microbes. Our study also have confirmed that the human intestinal microbiota possess large individual variations that make it difficult to detect significant but small changes commonly induced in individuals by an intervention, such as FOS intake in this study. This fact emphasizes the importance of intraindividual analyses, such as those employed in our study, for analysing changes in the gut microbiota in the human population. Consistent with this notion, a similar approach has recently been taken to reveal human gut environmental changes in response to short-term dietary intervention.56 Collectively, we propose that the multiple omics approach on the repeated intraindividual time-course sampling should be appropriate for uncovering the gut environmental changes upon intake of probiotics and prebiotics, as well as foods and drugs. In contrast, when repeated intraindividual samples are not available, these approaches may not detect significant differences/changes unless data from a large scale population are collected.In conclusion, our study has demonstrated that intraindividual multiple time-point correlation analyses are useful for understanding the FOS intake-induced increase in faecal IgA concentration. Since an enormous amount of biological data can be obtained with recent innovations in analytical hardware, such as the pyrosequencer, NMR and mass spectrometry, data-mining techniques are becoming more and more important. Application of our multiple correlation approach for analysing the individual gut ecosystems will enable us to better understand the whole picture of the impact of prebiotics, such as FOS and probiotics, on our gut ecosystem.Authors' contributionsS.F. and H.O. conceived and designed the experiments.

IntroductionRadish (Raphanus sativus L.), also called ‘Daikon’, is an important vegetable root crop especially in Asia. There is a large variation in size and shape of roots from smaller than 3 cm in diameter in the case of the European garden radish to more than 30 cm in diameter for ‘Sakurajima Daikon’ and from a round type in the case of the European garden radish and ‘Sakurajima Daikon’ to a long type such as ‘Moriguchi Daikon’ having a root more than 2 m in length. Fresh sprouts are used as a vegetable, and in tropical Asia, immature siliques are consumed as a vegetable. Radish is also produced as an oil crop, oil being extracted from mature seeds. Radish roots contain glucosinolates, which are hydrolyzed by inherent myrosinase (EC3.2.1.147) after disruption of cells, resulting in production of pungent components, i.e. isothiocyanates. Since 4-methylthio-3-butenyl isothiocyanate generated from the major glucosinolate in radish has been reported to have anti-mutagenicity1,2 and anti-carcinogenicity,3 radish may become more popular for use in salads.Radish belongs to a genus different from that of turnip (Brassica rapa), but they are highly similar in morphology to each other as vegetables. Shapes of siliques and seed sizes are obviously different between them. Phylogenetic analyses of Brassicaceae species using DNA markers or nucleotide sequences of genes have revealed that R. sativus belongs to the rapa/oleracea lineage not to the nigra lineage.4,5 Chromosome numbers of these species are different, i.e. n = 8 in Brassica nigra, n = 9 in Brassica oleracea and R. sativus, and n = 10 in B. rapa. Genome syntenies between these species are complicated,6,7 suggesting that extensive genome rearrangements have occurred during or after speciation of these species, while overall genome syntenies are well conserved in Poaceae crops, e.g. rice, wheat, maize, barley, and sorghum,8 and Solanaceae crops, e.g. tomato, potato, and eggplant.9The development of next-generation sequencers (NGSs) has enabled accumulation of a large amount of genomic nucleotide sequence data of many organisms at relatively low cost. De novo assembly of the genomic sequence data can provide whole-genome sequences, which can be assigned to chromosomes using the sequences of mapped DNA markers in a linkage map. Although the draft genome sequences of Chinese cabbage in B. rapa have been obtained and published,10 it is difficult to use these sequence data as references to determine the radish genome sequences because of highly complicated genome synteny between B. rapa and R. sativus.7In the present study, R. sativus draft genome sequences were determined by a NGS along with bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-end sequences. Using the sequence information, we constructed a high-density linkage map by adding new DNA markers and combining two different linkage maps, resulting in 2,553 DNA markers including 2,351 sequence-characterized markers (954 dot-blot-SNP markers, 768 PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) markers, and 629 expressed sequence tag-simple sequence repeat (EST-SSR) markers), and revealed detailed synteny between R. sativus and B. rapa. Additionally, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between several inbred lines were surveyed.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materialsA genetic linkage map has been previously constructed using an F2 population derived from a cross between two radish lines, which were self-pollinated for three generations from ‘Sayatori 26704’ (hereafter ‘Sayatori’) (National Institute of Vegetable and Tea Science, Japan) and ‘Aokubi S-h’ (hereafter ‘Aokubi’) (Takii Seed Co., Japan), respectively.7 ‘Sayatori’ is a seedpod vegetable with a very thin and small root like a rat tail and ‘Aokubi’ is Japanese radish with a long and thick root. Crossing these two lines yielded 189 F2 plants, which were used for construction of a linkage map. Total genomic DNAs were extracted from leaves with the CTAB method11 and subjected to genotype analysis and de novo sequencing analysis. For SNP identification by sequencing of bulked PCR products, three inbred lines, such as ‘Yumehomare’, ‘Sakurajima’, and ‘Nishimachi-Risou’, and an inbred line, ‘N1-3’, obtained from a cross between ‘Mino-wase’ and ‘Miyashige-Soubutori’ were used.2.2. Sequencing analysisTotal genomic DNA of ‘Aokubi’ was subjected to library construction according to the standard protocol (Illumina) for paired-end (PE; insert size of 250 bp) and mate-pair (MP) libraries (insert size of 5 kb). Sequencing analysis was carried out with a HiSeq 2000 sequencer (Illumina) in the paired-end sequencing mode (101 and 38 bases each for PE and MP libraries, respectively). Massive sequencing of a PE library for a radish line, ‘Sayatori’, was also carried out with an Illumina GAIIx sequencer in the paired-end mode (101-base each). The obtained Illumina reads were trimmed with quality scores of <10 by PRINSEQ 0.19.5.12 The end sequences of BAC clones, which were randomly selected from a BAC library of a doubled haploid line derived from ‘Aokubi’, were determined by the Sanger method13 using ABI3730xl (Applied Biosystems, USA).2.3. Genome assemblyThe low-quality and contaminated Sanger reads were eliminated by Cross_match (-minmatch 10 -minscore 18) for masking vector sequences (NCBI's UniVec), Trim2 (-m 100 -q 20 -x 10) for trimming low-quality bases, and Blast (E-value cut-off of 1E-10) for eliminating sequences similar to bacteria (all the bacterial genome sequences of NCBI), chloroplasts (accession number: NC_000932.1), and mitochondria sequences (accession number: NC_001284.2) of Arabidopsis thaliana.The Illumina PE reads of ‘Aokubi’ were assembled by the SOAPdenovo 2r223 assembler14 with a k-mer size of 81 and the default parameters. The resultant scaffolds were subjected to gap-filling with the Illumina reads by GapCloser 1.10 (p = 31) (http://soap.genomics.org.cn). Then, the scaffolds were bridged with the Illumina MP reads by SSPACE2.0.15 Furthermore, BAC-end sequences of ‘Aokubi’ were employed to construct super-scaffolds with SSPACE2.0.2.4. Gene prediction and annotationFrom the RSA_r1.0, genes were predicted by Augustus 2.716 with a training set of A. thaliana (TAIR10). The parameters used were –species = arabidopsis –genemodel = partial –protein = on –introns = on –start = on –stop = on –cds = on –codingseq = on –alternatives-from-evidence = true –alternatives-from-sampling = true –gff3 = on –UTR = on. The predicted genes were classified into four categories, i.e. intrinsic (with start and stop codons), partial (without start and/or stop codons), pseudo (with in-frame stop codons), and short genes (encoding <50 amino acids). Transposable elements (TEs) were judged from the results of hmmscan17 against GyDB18 with an E-value cut-off of 1.0, BLASTP against NCBI non-redundant protein database (nr: http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE=Proteins) with an E-value cut-off of 1E-10, and InterProScan19 against InterPro databases.20 To evaluate the accuracy of the gene prediction, radish unigene sequences available from the RadishBase (http://bioinfo.bti.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/radish/index.cgi)21 were used for BLAST searches (E-value cut-off of 1E-10) against the sequences of the RSA_r1.0.Functional domains in the predicted genes, which were searched for against InterPro databases20 using InterProScan,19 were assigned to the plant GO slim categories by using the map2slim program.22 Subsequently, the predicted genes were classified into eukaryotic Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins (KOG) categories23 by BLAST searches with an E-value cut-off of 1E-20. In addition, the predicted genes in the radish genome together with those in the A. thaliana and B. rapa genomes and unigenes for B. oleracea and Raphanus raphanistrum were clustered by CD-hit24 with parameters of c = 0.4; and aS = 0.4.2.5. Repetitive sequence analysisPutative repetitive sequences in the RSA_r1.0 were identified by RepeatScout25 with default parameters. In parallel, similarity searches and repeat masking were performed by RepeatMasker (http://www.repeatmasker.org) on RSA_r1.0 against known repetitive sequences registered in the RepBase.26 SSR motifs were searched for the RSA_r1.0 using SciRoKo27 with the MISA mode. The same analyses were carried out on the A. thaliana and B. rapa genomes.2.6. Discovering SNPs with other Raphanus linesThe Illumina reads obtained from the resequencing of ‘Sayatori’ described above were mapped onto the RSA_r1.0 for SNP discovery using the Bowtie 2 (http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/index.shtml)28 and SAMtools (http://samtools.sourceforge.net/) with default parameters.In our previous studies,7,29 2,880 primer pairs were designed for specific amplification of coding regions of genes containing 3'-untranslated regions. Using this primer set, sample preparations for sequencing were conducted for four R. sativus lines independently according to Zou et al.29 Sequences were determined using the Illumina GAIIx and the obtained reads were analysed by mapping to reference sequences of ‘Aokubi’ (RSA_r1.0) to discover SNPs between each R. sativus line using the program Bowtie 2 and SAMtools with default parameters.2.7. Development of SNP markersTwo strategies were adopted to discover SNPs between the parental lines ‘Sayatori’ and ‘Aokubi’. One was sequencing of PCR products of the parental lines by the Sanger method13 as described by Li et al.7 PCR primer pairs were designed for amplification of the unigenes from the RS2 library of the Radish Database (http://radish.plantbiology.msu.edu). SNPs were discovered by the comparison of determined sequences. Another strategy was the use of NGS data of both parents. SNPs were surveyed by mapping of reads of ‘Sayatori’ to ‘Aokubi’ reference sequences as described above. Polymorphic sequences for eight kinds of restriction enzymes, i.e. BamHI, EcoRI, HindIII, PstI, SacI, SalI, XbaI, and XhoI, were also surveyed by CLC Genomics Workbench 5.5 (CLC Bio., Denmark).PCR primer pairs were designed to amplify 400–700 bp products spanning SNPs. The sequences having SNPs were used for designing bridge probes30 for MPMP dot-blot-SNP analysis.7 In this case, the 189 F2 plants from the cross between both parents were used. In PCR-RFLP analyses, PCR primer pairs were designed spanning the polymorphisms and each PCR product was digested by a proper restriction enzyme and then separated by 2% agarose gel in 1× tris-acetate-EDTA buffer. The resulting DNA bands were stained with ethidium bromide. For this analysis, 29 F2 plants from the 189 F2 were selected by selective mapping software MapPop 1.031 and subjected to genotyping.2.8. Linkage analysisFirst, a new marker data set for SNPs was added to the original data to produce a combined data set. Linkage analysis was carried out using the JoinMap 4.0 software (Kyazma B.V., Wageningen, The Netherlands). The markers were grouped into nine linkage groups (R1–R9)7 at high logarithm of ODDs (LOD) threshold (=6). Marker order was determined by a regression mapping algorithm on the basis of a minimum LOD score of 1.0 and a recombination threshold of 0.4 in each LG. Recombination frequencies were converted into map distances in centimorgan (cM) using the Kosambi mapping function.Secondly, a new marker data set for polymorphisms by PCR-RFLP was also added to the renewed genotype data, and linkage analysis was carried out in the same manner described above. The linkage map was graphically visualized with MapChart.2.9. Integration of genetic mapsTo integrate a radish linkage map of EST-SNP markers with the linkage map of EST-SSR markers constructed by Shirasawa et al.,32 116 EST-SSR markers evenly distributed along the nine linkage groups were used to analyse polymorphism between the two parental lines and the EST-SSR markers having polymorphism were used for analysis of the F2 population. The PCR products were separated by 2% agarose gel or 8% polyacrylamide gel in 1× tris-borate-EDTA buffer.The sequences of the unigenes located in the newly constructed linkage map and the map of Shirasawa et al.32 were aligned to identify the same unigenes using the SEQUENCHER version 4.7 (Gene Codes Corporation, MI, USA) with the following parameters: window = 100, similarity = 90. Prior to construction of an integrated map, the orientation of each linkage group in the linkage map of Shirasawa et al.32 was adjusted in accordance with the linkage map using the consensus SSR markers. Using a software MergeMap (http://138.23.178.42/mgmap/), these two linkage maps were integrated to be a consensus map.2.10. Assignment of scaffolds to a linkage mapThe sequences of scaffolds were searched by BLAT with sequences of DNA markers on the linkage map. The scaffolds with identity =90% and score =120 were assigned to their corresponding DNA markers.2.11. Comparison with the B. rapa genome sequencesFor a comparison analysis between the sequences of DNA markers and genomic sequences of B. rapa,10 homology search was performed using the local BLAST software included in the CLC Genomics Workbench 5.5 (CLC Bio.). The genome sequence fragments of B. rapa with the lowest E-value of <1E-50 were regarded as the homologous sequences. Syntenic regions (SRs) were identified according to conserved collinearity of EST sequences in the linkage map of R. sativus and the B. rapa genome sequences.For a dot-plot view of SRs of R. sativus and B. rapa genomes, genomic sequences of scaffolds anchored to the integrated high-density linkage map of R. sativus in this study were aligned to genomic sequences of B. rapa according to the following step. Since the linkage map for assignment of the scaffolds was an integrated high-density linkage map combining an SNP-based map, a PCR-RFLP-based map by a selective mapping method, and an SSR-based map, the accuracy of the positions of the marker types might be in the order of SNP, SSR, and PCR-RFLP markers. If a scaffold was assigned to multiple markers on a linkage group, the most accurate marker position as the unique position of the scaffold was preferentially selected. In addition, if a scaffold was assigned to multiple markers of the same type, the position of the marker whose neighboured markers' syntenic relationship with the B. rapa genome was consistent with the microsyteny between the scaffold and B. rapa genome was regarded as being the proper position of the scaffold. Thus, the ‘pseudomolecules’ representative of the genome of R. sativus was established and the genetic distances between the scaffolds were converted to physical distances based on the ratio of total length of linkage map and genome size of R. sativus. Furthermore, physical distances between the predicted genes were also estimated. All genomic sequences of predicted genes in the pseudomolecules of R. sativus and those in the B. rapa genome were compared with each other using nucleotide BLAST. The genes of B. rapa with the lowest E-value and the E-value of <1E-100 were regarded as syntenic homologues. A list of syntenic homologues between genes in R. sativus and B. rapa was compiled and the dot-plot view was constructed by EXCEL based on the position of the syntenic homologues in two genomes.3. Results and discussion3.1. Genome assemblyIn the whole-genome shotgun sequencing of ‘Aokubi’ with an Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencer in the paired-end mode, a total of 1,142 million (M) and 924 M reads corresponding to 103.7 Gb and 87.4 Gb DNA were obtained in the PE and MP libraries, respectively. Total depth of the obtained sequence data (191.1 Gb) was shown by calculation to be ~246.5 times as the estimated size of the radish genome being 528.6 Mb (Supplementary Data), which is almost the same size as 530 Mb of a predicted R. sativus genome size.33 After trimming the reads with quality scores of <10 by PRINSEQ 0.19.511 and the adaptor sequence used in paired-end reads by fastx_clipper in FASTX-Toolkit (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit), the remaining paired-end reads were assembled into 1,020,003 scaffolds containing 435,331,541 bases, and the gaps in the scaffolds were subsequently filled with the Illumina reads by GapCloser 1.10 (p = 31) (http://soap.genomics.org.cn/soapdenovo.html). The total length of the gap-filled scaffolds was 438,973,418 bases consisting of 1,020,003 scaffolds. The Illumina MP reads were used for extension of the length of the scaffolds, resulting in 473,904,309 bases consisting of 992,801 scaffolds (Supplementary Data). Both ends of 20,736 BAC clones were sequenced by the Sanger method.13 After removing end sequences with low-quality values of <20 and those showing similarities to contaminated sequences of chloroplasts, mitochondria, bacteria, and a cloning vector, the remaining 27,904 high-quality BAC-end sequences (accession no. GA872392–GA901611 in DDBJ) representing the radish genome were subjected to construction of super-scaffolds (Supplementary Data). An assembly analysis using SSPACE 2.0 constructed 737 super-scaffolds. Finally, 76,592 scaffolds with =300 bp spanning 402,330,269 bases (N50: 46,262 bases; GC%: 34.9) were obtained and named RSA_r1.0; they covered 75.9% of the estimated genome size in radish (530 Mb) (Table 1). Sequences of RSA_r1.0 were registered in the DDBJ database as accession DF384214-DF396802 and are published in the ‘Raphanus sativus Genome DataBase’ (http://radish.kazusa.or.jp). Statistics of RSA_r1.0Statistics of RSA_r1.0Comparative analyses of linkage maps between B. rapa and A. thaliana34 and between R. sativus and A. thaliana7 have suggested that the diploid R. sativus and B. rapa species possess triplicated genomes. Nucleotide sequencing35,36 and cytogenetic analysis37,38 in Brassica species have also suggested this. Therefore, a possibility of mis-assemblies of scaffolds should be considered. To evaluate validities of scaffolds, a linkage of both ends of each scaffold was tested. For this purpose, DNA markers derived from both ends of each scaffold were produced for 59 comparatively long ones (>100 kb), which were selected randomly, and used them for genotyping analyses of 48 F2 plants derived from a crossing between ‘Aokubi’ and an inbred line from ‘Sayatori’.7 Of the 59 examined scaffolds, 56 exhibited complete linkages (Supplementary Data), suggesting that the possibility of mis-assembly must be low, ca. 5%, in the present study.3.2. Gene annotationA total of 80,521 genes were predicted in RSA_r1.0 (Table 2 and Supplementary Data) through an analysis by Augustus 2.716 with a training set of A. thaliana. Using the hmmscan module in HMMER 3.017 against the Database GyDB 2.0,18 BLASTP search against NCBI's non-redundant protein sequence database, and InterProScan19 against the InterPro database,20 61,572 genes were predicted as intrinsic genes, i.e. genes with start and stop codons (45,002) and partial genes (16,570) (Table 2 and Supplementary Data). There were 15,545 genes predicted to be transposable elements and 3,404 pseudo and short genes. Therefore, the 61,572 predicted genes (average length: 874 bases; GC contents: 46.6%) were employed for further analysis (Table 2). Among them, 1,335 genes for transfer RNAs were identified, a number similar to that in B. rapa and twice that in A. thaliana (Supplementary Data). Of 85,083 radish unigene sequences available from the RadishBase,21 84,165 (98.9%) were found in the genome sequences of RSA_r1.0 (Supplementary Data), indicating that the genome coverage of RSA_r1.0 was sufficient to identify genes. Statistics of genes predicted by Augustus 2.7Statistics of genes predicted by Augustus 2.7The total length of repetitive sequences in RSA_r1.0 was 107.2 Mb. The size was not so different from that in the B. rapa genome (93.4 Mb), while it was much larger than that in A. thaliana (23.6 Mb) (Supplementary Data). Predominant repetitive sequences in RSA_r1.0 were novel ones occupying 14.7%, as in B. rapa (19.1%). In the known interspersed repeats, long terminal repeat elements of the Class I elements including copia- and gypsy-types were the most frequent repeat sequences in RSA_r1.0 (4.1%) as in B. rapa (4.4%) and A. thaliana (8.7%).The 61,572 genes predicted by Augustus were annotated by the following analyses. First, the predicted genes in the radish genome of ‘Aokubi’ together with those in the A. thaliana and B. rapa genomes and EST-derived unigenes for B. oleracea and R. raphanistrum were clustered. The 61,572 genes in R. sativus, 41,019 in B. rapa, 35, 386 in A. thaliana, 36,862 in B. oleracea, and 22,618 in R. raphanistrum were clustered into 24,188; 17,942; 16,357; 19,807; and 11,843 families, respectively (Fig. 1). Of them, 6,110 families were common among the five species. The number of families specific to R. sativus was 8,759 and the distribution of the species-specific families to total families was 36.2%, which was much higher than those in B. rapa (15.6%) and A. thaliana (16.2%), suggesting that unique sequences are richer in radish than in B. rapa and A. thaliana. Functions of the predicted genes were investigated and compared with those in R. sativus, A. thaliana, B. rapa, B. oleracea, and R. raphanistrum. Among the radish predicted genes, 21,828 showed similarities to protein-encoding sequences in NCBI's KOG database23 with functional classification (Supplementary Data). Although their distributions are similar to those of the five species (Fig. 2), comparatively higher values in two KOGs, i.e. ‘replication, recombination, and repair’ and ‘cell cycle control, cell division, and chromosome partitioning’, than those in B. rapa and A. thaliana were displayed in R. sativus.

SNP identification by whole-genome sequencingGenome-wide SNPs were identified by a sequencing strategy. Whole-genome resequencing of a radish line, ‘Sayatori’, was carried out using an Illimina GAIIx sequencer, and a total of 14.3 Gb data, mean depth of 28 times, were obtained. The reads were filtered with a quality score of <10 and mapped on RSA_r1.0 to discover SNP candidates (Supplementary Data). Consequently, a total of 1,137,732 SNP candidates were identified from 151,012,313 bases of RSA_r1.0 with a read depth of 3–18 times. Of them, 500,113 and 637,619 SNP candidates were found in the intrinsic and partial genic regions (77,327,761 bases) and in intergenic regions including TEs, pseudogenes, and short genes (73,684,552 bases), respectively. SNP densities were, therefore, calculated to be 1/155 and 1/116 bp in the genic regions and the intergenic regions, respectively. The ratios of transitions to transversions were 1.3 (376,530/261,089) and 1.4 (281,810/218,303) in the genic regions and the intergenic regions, respectively.3.4. Construction of a high-density linkage map of DNA markersOf the 670 primer pairs newly designed from the radish unigene sequences (http://radish.plantbiology.msu.edu), single DNA fragments were amplified by 528 primer pairs; of which, 351 showed nucleotide polymorphism between ‘Sayatori’ and ‘Aokubi’, which are the parents of F2 plants used for DNA marker mapping, by the Sanger sequencing method. According to the identified SNPs, 351 dot-blot-SNP markers were developed and named <RS2> <EST name> <s>. Additionally, SNPs were surveyed between ‘Aokubi’ and ‘Sayatori’ by mapping of ‘Sayatori’ reads to ‘Aokubi’-scaffold sequences, whose sequence data were collected by the Illumina sequencer as described in the previous paragraph. SNPs were randomly selected and 140 primer pairs were designed for amplification of the regions containing SNPs. Of these, 129 primer pairs amplified single DNA fragments of both ‘Aokubi’ and ‘Sayatori’. Dot-blot-SNP markers were designed and named <RGA> <scaffold name> <s>. The MPMP dot-blot-SNP method7 was employed for SNP genotyping.Of the 351 and 129 dot-blot-SNP markers, 181 and 94, respectively, showed clear dot-blot signals with distinct differences between SNP alleles. In total, 275 DNA markers were used for analysis of 189 F2 plants. Taken together with the genotype data of 746 markers in the previously published map,7 linkage analysis was performed by the JoinMap 4.0. As a result, 954 markers including 889 RS2-SNP markers and 65 RGA-SNP markers were assigned to nine LGs, designated as R1–R9.7 The information of new dot-blot-SNP markers is shown in Supplementary Data.To map more DNA markers onto the linkage map, selective mapping was carried out by genotyping analysis using 29 of the 189 F2 plants. Preliminarily, using a part of the Illumina sequence data of ‘Aokubi’ and ‘Sayatori’, we mapped reads of ‘Sayatori’ to contigs of ‘Aokubi’ by CLC Genomics Workbench 5.5 (CLC Bio.) to design PCR-RFLP markers. One hundred and sixteen PCR-RFLP markers were found to be available for genotyping of F2 plants and those were named <RGB> <contig name> <c> (Supplementary Data). Furthermore, after construction of RSA_r1.0 scaffolds, 1,028 PCR-RFLP markers were designed by the comparison of sequences between RSA_r1.0 scaffolds of ‘Aokubi’ and reads of ‘Sayatori’. Six hundred and fifty-two markers were added to the linkage map and the markers were named <RGC> <order of design of primer pair> <c> (Supplementary Data). Consequently, a linkage map of 1,020 cM with 1,722 markers was constructed.Another linkage map reported by Shirasawa et al.32 has been constructed with 832 markers including mainly 630 EST-SSR markers using the different population. Among them, 12 makers were common between both linkage maps. One hundred and sixteen SSR markers were used for analysis of ‘Aokubi’ and ‘Sayatori’; of which, 41 showed polymorphism between them. Of the 41 markers, 37 were available for genotyping of the 189 F2 plants. Using a total of 49 markers, an integrated map was constructed by the MergeMap software. The integrated map consisted of 2,553 markers (Supplementary Data and Supplementary Data). Respective linkage groups for the R. sativus LGs were assigned from R1 to R9, according to Li et al.7 (Supplementary Data). The total length covered by the integrated linkage map was 1,165.8 cM with an average interval distance between neighbouring markers of 0.46 cM (Supplementary Data).SNP markers showing distorted segregation were surveyed. Five regions showed segregation ratios significantly deviated from the expected ratio, i.e. 1 : 2 : 1. A region from RSCL4186s to RGA1553s in R3 had segregation ratio of 2 : 3 : 1. Segregations of a region from RS2CL1405s to RS2CL3657s in R5, a region from RS2CL7837s to RS2CL7123s in R6, and a region from RS2CL6859s to RSCL8726s in R6 were approximately 1 : 1 : 1. A region from RS2CL1468s to RS2CL1940s in R8 showed a segregation ratio of 1 : 3 : 1.3.5. Assignment of scaffolds to the integrated map and comparison with the genome of B. rapaRSA_r1.0 scaffolds were assigned to the integrated linkage map using alignments with the marker sequences. To R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, and R9, 98, 164, 122, 212, 196, 189, 108, 120, and 136 scaffolds were assigned, respectively (Supplementary Data). A total of 1,345 scaffolds spanned 116.0 Mb, which covers 21.8% of the Raphanus genome.Since B. rapa and R. sativus are considered to have originated from the same ancestral species after genome triplication, which was followed by extensive genome rearrangements, chromosome synteny was investigated by comparative mapping. The sequences of the DNA markers on the integrated linkage map were compared with the genome sequences of B. rapa by BLASTN. Under a significance E-value threshold of <1E-50, B. rapa homologous sequences were identified (Supplementary Data). According to the genome collinearity between B. rapa and R. sativus, 49 SRs were identified (Supplementary Data). The whole linkage groups of R3 and R8 were confirmed to show almost complete synteny with the upper part of A3 and all of A8, respectively. The collinearities of R3 and R8 were also observed in C3, B3, and S3, and in C8, B7, and S8.7 This observation suggested that a rearrangement event has seldom occurred in these chromosomal regions, although the reason is unknown. On the other hand, the R5 and R6 linkage groups showed very complicated genome syntenies, being composed of nine and eight SRs derived from parts of five and six linkage groups of B. rapa, respectively (Supplementary Data). In the other R. sativus linkage groups, such as R1, R2, R4, R7, and R9, similar complicated compositions were also observed (Supplementary Data). In Poaceae genomes such as rice and barley and in Solanaceae genomes such as tomato and potato, highly syntenic relationships between close relative species have been reported.8,9 To the contrary, highly complicated relationships have been observed between B. rapa and B. oleracea.7 Similar complexity was also detected between B. rapa and R. sativus. Whole genome triplication (WGT) of ancestral species of these Brassica crop species has been estimated to have occurred between 13 and 17 million years ago.35,36 After WGT, chromosome rearrangements might have occurred many times by the time R. sativus was established.Based on the genomic sequences of the scaffolds that were anchored to the linkage map, collinearity with the B. rapa genome was surveyed. Genomic sequences of predicted genes in the anchored scaffolds were aligned with those of B. rapa10 by BLAST and those with low E-values (<1E-100) were 10,995 genes in R. sativus and 10,422 in B. rapa. The dot-plot view (Fig. 3) revealed the same large SRs between genomes of R. sativus and B. rapa, corresponding to the 49 SRs (Supplementary Data). Figure 3.Open in new tabDownload slideDot-plot view of SRs of R. sativus (horizontal) and B. rapa (vertical) genomes. All genomic sequences of predicted genes in the pseudomolecules of scaffolds assigned to the R. sativus linkage map and those in the B. rapa genome were compared with each other, using nucleotide BLAST. The genes of B. rapa with the lowest E-value, which meets <1E-100, were regarded as the syntenic homologues, and the dots were plotted on the chart (see Materials and Methods). The genetic distances between the scaffolds were converted to physical distances based on the ratio of total length of linkage map and genome size of R. sativus.

SNP identification by sequencing of bulked PCR products in other Raphanus linesIn our previous studies, 2,880 primer pairs were designed to construct an SNP-based linkage map,7 and Zou et al.29 developed a highly efficient method for identification of SNPs by determining nucleotide sequences of the bulked PCR products amplified by these primer pairs using an NGS. Using the same primer pairs, multiplex PCRs were carried out in four inbred lines of ‘Yumehomare’, ‘Sakurajima’, ‘N1-3’, and ‘Nishimachi-Risou’, and the nucleotide sequences were determined by an Illumina sequencer. The short reads of these lines along with those of ‘Taibyosobutori’ and ‘AZ26H’29 were mapped onto fragments of RSA_r1.0 scaffold sequences. Taken together with the identified fragments of ‘Sayatori’, SNPs were surveyed between all inbred lines and the results for the number of SNPs and the number of common amplicons containing SNPs between different lines are shown in Supplementary Data and Supplementary Data, respectively. A great number of SNPs were detected in the combination of ‘Sayatori’ and the other inbred lines. The number of SNPs per common amplicon was over 5.5 and was the most, i.e. 6.95, between ‘Aokubi’ and ‘Sayatori’. In the other combinations, the number of SNPs ranged from 2,066 at minimum between ‘Taibyosobutori’ and ‘Aokubi’ to 3,568 at maximum between ‘Sakurajima’ and ‘Aokubi’. Consequently, many SNPs were detected in every combination and will certainly be useful for molecular genetic studies such as QTL analyses, as described by Zou et al.294. DatabaseThe draft genome sequences (RSA_r1.0), gene sequences, and SNP information between cultivars are available from the Raphanus sativus Genome DataBase (http://radish.kazusa.or.jp).

IntroductionGlobally, the sweet potato [Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam] is an important food crop with an annual production of 104 million tons (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations; http://faostat3.fao.org/, 20 May 2014, date last accessed). This crop is known to be a valuable food source that contains various nutrients, including a high starch content, complex carbohydrates, dietary fibre, vitamins and anthocyanins. In addition to its high nutrient content, this crop is resilient, easy to propagate and grows relatively well in infertile and nitrogen-poor soils. There are over 8,000 varieties, including wild accessions, landraces and breeding lines registered with the International Potato Center (http://cipotato.org/sweetpotato/, 20 May 2014, date last accessed). Thus, the sweet potato is grown widely and is used for various purposes throughout the world. However, the sweet potato is a hexaploid (2n = 6x = 90) outbreeding species with a high degree of heterozygosity, and genome sequence information is not available for this species, which has hindered genetic analyses, the development of molecular markers and DNA fingerprinting.1–5Retrotransposons are major components of eukaryotic genomes and they are present in high copy numbers in most of the plants.6–8 Retrotransposons are divided into two major groups: a group with a long terminal repeat (LTR) sequence at both ends and another group without LTRs (non-LTR). The non-LTR retrotransposons are further divided into long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs) and short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs).6–8 In our previous study, we identified two active retrotransposon families in sweet potato, i.e. an LTR-type Rtsp-1 and a LINE-type LIb.9,10 These two families exhibited a high degree of insertion polymorphism and newly inserted copies were inherited steadily throughout clonal propagation.10 The retrotransposon insertion polymorphisms found in different cultivars can be used for DNA fingerprinting.11–16Next-generation sequencing technology has developed rapidly in the past few years and it has been utilized in various fields of genetics, thereby accelerating genomic and genetic research dramatically. More recently, bench-top high-throughput sequencing instruments such as the Roche/454 GS Junior (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), Illumina MiSeq and Ion Torrent PGM (Life Technologies) have been released, which are capable of sequencing several megabase to gigabase pairs in a single lane-sequencing run with enhanced speed and cost performance.17,18 In particular, the MiSeq system has the highest throughput per run and the lowest error rate,17 and the latest version enables to generate up to 15 Gb per run with 2 × 300 bp reads using new reagent kits (http://www.illumina.com/systems/miseq.ilmn, 20 May 2014, date last accessed). These bench-top systems produce smaller sequence datasets than traditional high-throughput sequencing instruments (Roche/454 GS FLX+ and Illumina HiSeq 2000), but their utilization is increasingly widespread because of their greater time and cost performance during sequencing analysis, although with modest performance.In the present study, we conducted DNA fingerprinting based on the insertion polymorphisms of the active retrotransposon families (Rtsp-1 and LIb) in sweet potato. Using a bench-top sequencing platform, we successfully identified 2,024 insertion sites in 38 cultivars based on a single lane-sequencing run. It should be noted that the insertion sites of the active retrotransposon families were highly polymorphic among those cultivars. Using the cultivar-specific insertion sites, we successfully developed sequence-characterized amplified region (SCAR) markers, which may facilitate the precise identification of cultivars. Moreover, the genotyping data related to the insertion sites can be used to determine the genetic relationships among cultivars. The sweet potato is a non-model crop species and its whole genome sequencing data are not available, but our method enables efficient genotyping based on a number of polymorphic retrotransposon insertion sites.2. Materials and methods2.1. DNA samplesDNA samples from the 38 sweet potato cultivars listed in Supplementary Data were provided by the National Agriculture and Food Research Organization, Kyusyu Okinawa Agricultural Research Center. Young leaves were collected from field grown plants and genomic DNA was extracted using a DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Inc., Germany).2.2. MiSeq library constructionGenomic DNA (5 µg) was separated into fragments of ~6 kb by g-TUBE (Covaris) centrifugation and purified using a QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen). The purified products were treated with DNA polymerase I and T4 DNA polymerase to convert the heterogeneous ends via their physical fragmentation into blunt ends. The blunt ends were adenylated at the 3' end using a Klenow fragment that lacked a 5' to 3' exonuclease activity. A forked adapter with a T overhang at the 5' double-stranded end was ligated using T4 DNA ligase. The retrotransposon insertion sites were specifically amplified using nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR), where the first PCR was performed with retrotransposon-specific (Rtsp-1_ppt or LIb_L_D4) and adapter-specific (AP2) primer combinations using the ligated products as the template, and the second PCR was performed with primers for the 3' end sequence of Rtsp-1 or LIb [adjacent to the 3' end polyadenosine sequence (poly(A)] and an adapter sequence (AP3) using the initial PCR products as the template. The PCR comprises an initial denaturation at 94°C for 2 min, which was followed by 30 cycles at 94°C for 30 s, 80°C for 30 s, 58°C for 30 s and 72°C for 1 min, with a final extension at 72°C for 15 min. The PCR products were selected by size (300–500 bp) using gel electrophoresis and purified with a QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen). The MiSeq sequencing adapters were ligated to the size-selected products from each cultivar using a TruSeq DNA-Sampling Preparation Kit (Illumina) to obtain cultivar-specific combinations of the dual index sequences in the adapters (Fig. 1). Equal amounts of the ligated products from the 38 cultivars were pooled before MiSeq sequencing, and a paired-end sequence of 150 bp was determined at each end (Fig. 1). MiSeq sequencing was conducted using the MS-102-1001 MiSeq Reagen Kit (300 cycles) (Illumina). In sequencing run, we added a PhiX Control v3 (Illumina) at 50% of our library, because Illumina recommends spike-in a PhiX control DNA for low diversity library where a significant number of the reads have the same sequence. It is known that a high-concentration spike-in (40% or higher) of PhiX improves matrix generation and phasing/prephasing calculations and helps balance the overall lack of sequence diversity. Our library was considered to have low diversity nucleotide composition because of the Rtsp-1 or LIb sequences, or an adaptor AP3 sequence at the beginning of one read of a sequence pair. This should be combined with a reduction of the amount of library used. The sequences of the adapters and primers are reported in Supplementary Data. The MiSeq reads of this study have been submitted to DDBJ (http://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/, 20 May 2014, date last accessed) under accession no. DRA001340.

Data analysisThe MiSeq output was divided into each cultivar based on the dual index TruSeq sequence. The sequencing data were handled using Maser, the pipeline execution system of the Cell Innovation Program at the National Institute of Genetics (http://cell-innovation.nig.ac.jp/index_en.html, 20 May 2014, date last accessed). When one read of a sequence pair was filtered for invalid Rtsp-1 or LIb primer sequences, the entire pair was discarded. The LINE element of LIb has a poly(A) tail with variable lengths at the integration site.10,19 Those poly(A) sequences were removed from the LIb reads using the PRINSEQ tool20 before subsequent data processing. After trimming the Rtsp-1 or LIb sequences from the reads, they were trimmed further to 50 bp from the retrotransposon junction and filtered based on the quality value (QV) for all base calls =20. Next, the outliers were filtered by trimming them to a specific length that included most of the sequences (>99 or >98%), whereas reads shorter than this specific length were filtered out. Identical sequences observed in =10 reads were treated as a single sequence using the FASTA format with read count information, whereas those with <10 reads were discarded. Using the sequences that passed through these processes, we determined Rtsp-1 and LIb insertion sites according to the following steps: (i) we conducted all-to-all comparison of these sequences to reveal their similarities, which were used to build clusters that represent an individual insertion site. It started with the self-alignment of the produced sequences via BLAT analysis21 using the following parameter settings: -tileSize = 8, -minMatch = 1, -minScore = 10, -repMatch = –1 and -oneOff = 2. BLAT is one of the local pairwise alignment programmes.21 (ii) We clustered these sequences into groups based on their sequence similarity with the results of pairwise alignments. In each cluster, sequences were collected in FASTA format. (iii) We performed a multiple sequence alignment using these FASTA files for each cluster to reveal the sequence similarity with ClustalW program,22 which produced an alignment file per cluster. Then, we determined the representative sequence in each cluster based on the number of sequence. The sequence with the highest number was extracted as the representative sequence in each cluster. Our results showed that the sequences to be aligned in each cluster were very similar to each other (identity of >90%). These processes generated the cluster of sequence or non-clustered sequence with =10 reads as an individual insertion site that a copy of Rtsp-1 or LIb was inserted in at least one or more cultivars. However, assigning the insertion sites to cultivars would probably have caused some errors, because sequence errors in the index sequence may have allocated the reads to an incorrect cultivar while sequences with small read numbers may have been incorrectly included in large clusters by the BLAT analysis. These erroneous assignments would have resulted in a very small number of reads. Thus, we set a critical value for determining the presence of Rtsp-1 and LIb insertions, i.e. if the reads for a cultivar at a specific insertion site comprise <0.01% of the entire reads for that cultivar, we assumed that the retrotransposon was absent from that site. Each cultivar was genotyped by combining the presence (1) or absence (0) of information at each site for all the insertion sites (Supplementary Data).2.4. Development of SCAR markersWe designed the PCR primers to amplify the junction of the retrotransposon and its insertion site. Supplementary Data showed all genotyping information (scores 0 and 1) in the cultivars, the representative sequence in each cluster and non-cluster sequence. We focused on the putative cultivar-specific insertion site that was present in one cultivar (scoring; 1) and absent from others (scoring; 0). The primer sequence of SCAR marker was designed based on the representative sequence for the cluster of these cultivar-specific insertion site (Supplementary Data). The PCR was performed with Rtsp-1-specific primer (Rtsp-1_ppt) and insertion site-specific (RP_*) primer combinations using the genomic DNA as the template (Supplementary Data). The PCR comprises an initial denaturation at 95°C for 2 min, which was followed by 30 cycles at 95°C for 30 s, 58°C for 30 s and 72°C for 30 s, with a final extension at 72°C for 15 min. The PCR products were visualized using 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis.2.5. Phylogenetic analysisA distance matrix was calculated from the presence/absence matrices using Nei's and Li's coefficient index23 with the FreeTree program (Supplementary Data).24 The phylogenetic reconstruction was based on the neighbour-joining method. Support for the internal branches in the phylogeny was assessed using 1,000 bootstrap replicates. A dendrogram was constructed with MEGA5.253. Results3.1. MiSeq sequencing of the Rtsp-1 and LIb insertion sitesWe constructed a MiSeq sequencing library to screen the junction sequences of the Rtsp-1 and LIb insertion sites in 38 sweet potato cultivars (Fig. 1). Each cultivar sample was labelled using a TruSeq DNA-Sampling Preparation Kit with dual indexing (Fig. 1). The Rtsp-1 and LIb libraries were mixed at a ratio of 4 : 1 to prepare a single sequencing sample, because the copy number of Rtsp-1 was estimated to be approximately four times higher than that of LIb.9,10A total of 4,401,639 read pairs were obtained from a single lane-sequencing run using the MiSeq platform, i.e. 3,567,587 and 834,052 read pairs represented Rtsp-1 and LIb insertion sites, respectively (Table 1). The results indicated that the read number ratio in each library (Rtsp-1 reads = 81.1% and LIb reads = 18.9%) was close to the expected value (Rtsp-1 reads = 80% and LIb reads = 20%). Of these read pairs, 86.8% for Rtsp-1 and 89.8% for LIb had valid retrotransposon-specific sequences (Table 1), which indicated that nested PCR could specifically amplify DNA fragments from the junction sequences of these elements. The read numbers for each sample are presented in Supplementary Data. Summary of the MiSeq read data processingaThe clusters include groups of two or more sequences and non-clustered single sequences for the insertion sites of Rtsp-1and LIb, where the minimum number of reads for an identical sequence was 10.Summary of the MiSeq read data processingaThe clusters include groups of two or more sequences and non-clustered single sequences for the insertion sites of Rtsp-1and LIb, where the minimum number of reads for an identical sequence was 10.3.2. Identification of the Rtsp-1 and LIb insertion sites in 38 cultivarsTo identify the Rtsp-1 and LIb insertion sites, we selected one end of a paired read that contained the junction sequence of the Rtsp-1 and LIb ends and their insertion sites. A sequence of 150 bp in the read was filtered based on the valid retrotransposon sequences and QV scores with base calls =20 in the insertion site sequence of 50 bp (see Materials and Methods) (Table 1). After these filtering processes, 63.7 and 51.2% of the reads remained for Rtsp-1 and LIb, respectively (Table 1). These reads were used in the clustering analysis to obtain sequence information for each insertion site (Table 1). The clustering process was conducted using BLAT,21 where the parameter settings were -tileSize = 8, -minMatch = 1, -minScore = 10, -repMatch = –1 and -oneOff = 2, which generated 1,497 and 527 clusters or non-clustered single sequences for the insertion sites of Rtsp-1 and LIb, respectively, where the minimum number of reads required for an identical sequence was 10 (Tables 1 and 2). We detected Rtsp-1 and LIb in each insertion site of the 38 cultivars (Supplementary Data). In the 38 cultivars, the median number of Rtsp-1 insertion sites per cultivar was 257.5 (range = 216–347), whereas that for LIb was 92.5 (range = 67–147) (Fig. 2). Also, the average number of Rtsp-1 insertion sites among 38 cultivars was 259, whereas that of LIb was 102.6, respectively. Of the 1,497 Rtsp-1 insertion sites, 88.6% were polymorphic among cultivars and 19.4% were identified as cultivar-specific sites, which were present in only one cultivar and absent from others (Table 2). For LIb, the same figures were 99.2 and 16.1%, respectively (Table 2). Thus, the insertion sites of these two active retrotransposon families were found to be highly polymorphic among sweet potato cultivars. Table 2.Summary of the insertion sites identified

Development of SCAR markers for cultivar identificationWe designed PCR primers using the Rtsp-1 insertion sequences of five cultivar-specific sites (Supplementary Data). We conducted PCR amplification with the 38 sweet potato cultivars using these cultivar-specific insertion primer (RP_*) and Rtsp-1-specific primer (Rtsp-1_ppt), which produced single, distinct and clear bands (Fig. 3). The SCAR markers developed in this study can be treated as dominant markers and used for the simple and rapid screening of cultivars.

Genetic relationships among sweet potato cultivarsTo investigate the genetic relationships among the 38 sweet potato cultivars, we conducted a phylogenetic analysis based on the Rtsp-1 and LIb insertion sites. Basically, sweet potato is cultivated by vegetative propagation. However, Japanese sweet potato cultivars had been developed with crossing the limited number of cultivars, which indicated most cultivars used in this study were genetically related. The genetic distance scores were calculated based on Nei's and Li's coefficient index (Supplementary Data). The phylogenetic trees were constructed using the neighbour-joining method (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Data). The genetic relationships among cultivars based on the Rtsp-1 and LIb insertion polymorphisms were consistent well each other (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Data). Pedigree information was known for some cultivars (Supplementary Data), which was also consistent with the genetic relationships in the phylogenetic trees. In addition, the parent and offspring cultivars shown in the pedigree information had lower genetic distance (Supplementary Data), which indicated they are genetically closely-related. This suggests that obtaining genotyping information based on the active retrotransposon insertion sites may be useful for determining the genetic relationships among sweet potato cultivars.

DiscussionIn this study, we conducted DNA fingerprinting based on the insertion polymorphisms of the active retrotransposon families (Rtsp-1 and LIb) in the sweet potato. The application of a MiSeq sequencing platform, which is a bench-top high-throughput sequencer, allowed >1.3 Gb of high-quality sequencing data to be produced at a low cost in a short time. We successfully identified 2,024 insertion sites for two types of retrotransposon families and obtained 76,912 (2,024 insertion sites × 38 cultivars) genotyping data points in a single sequencing run. We developed several SCAR markers based on the cultivar-specific insertion sites (Fig. 3). This type of marker has several advantages compared with simple sequence repeat (SSR) marker or amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) marker, because they can be used to produce specific and easily recognizable bands by agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3).26–28 Thus, the SCAR markers developed in this study could be used for the rapid and precise screening of sweet potato cultivars in breeding programmes. Furthermore, the genetic relationships among sweet potato cultivars can be determined based on the genotyping data, which were demonstrated by the phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Data). Our methods should accelerate sweet potato genotyping and they provide a practical method for cultivar identification.The sweet potato is a non-model crop species and its whole genome sequence information is not available. It is a hexaploid plant (2n = 6x = 90) with an estimated genome size of 2,200–3,000 Mb.29 Recently, comprehensive transcriptome sequencing of the sweet potato was reported in three studies.29–31 Thus, genetic analyses of the sweet potato based on molecular markers have been delayed compared with other plant species. In general, genotyping with a high-throughput sequencing system, such as the Illumina HiSeq 2000, has been conducted based on single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci in model species.32–38 If a reference genome sequence is available, whole genome resequencing or exome resequencing may be effective for genome-wide SNP and/or indel calling using multiple samples after mapping the reads to the reference genome. In non-model crop species such as the sweet potato, however, these resequencing methods cannot be applied because of the lack of reference sequences. Thus, targeting the sequences of highly polymorphic sites in cultivars may be an efficient alternative method for genotyping these species. Moreover, high-sensitivity targeted sequencing is far less expensive and requires less sequencing data per sample than whole genome resequencing.14,16,19 Our results demonstrated that the active retrotransposon insertion sites were highly polymorphic in cultivated sweet potato varieties, and the targeted sequencing of these sites could be achieved using a MiSeq bench-top system. Thus, the low cost and time-saving DNA fingerprinting methods developed in this study could facilitate the precise identification of cultivars, as well as being used for assessments of genetic diversity and conducting linkage analyses.FundingThis work was supported by a Research and Development Project for Application in Promoting the New Policy of Agriculture Forestry and Fisheries grant from the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Japan and by the Programme to Disseminate Tenure Tracking System, from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), Japan (to Y.M.).We thank Drs Yoshihiro Okada and Yasuhiro Takahata at the National Agriculture and Food Research Organization, Kyusyu Okinawa Agricultural Research Center, for providing plant materials and their experimental support.

IntroductionTranscriptional regulation of gene expression plays a major role in both plant development and in response to environmental stimuli. Each is controlled by various classes of transcriptional factors (TFs), either by interaction with cis-acting elements, or with other TFs required for gene expression.1,2 In plants, there are more than 60 TF families currently identified with varied functional roles that are being progressively defined.1,2 The trihelix family, one of the first TFs discovered in plants, is classified as GT factors due to their binding specificity for GT elements.3–6 The DNA-binding domain of GT factors features a typical trihelix (helix-loop-helix-loop-helix) structure. Taken together, the helices form a bundle held together by a hydrophobic core that determines the specific binding of GT elements with a degenerate core sequence of 5'-G-Pu-(T/A)-A-A-(T/A)-3'.4,6–8The first trihelix TF of GT-1 was isolated from pea (Pisum sativum). It binds to the promoter region of the rbcS-3A gene to regulate light-dependent expression.4 Some homologous members of the GT-1 family were later found in Arabidopsis, rice, and tobacco; but their physiological roles in the light response were still not uncovered.9–13 It is notable that the transcription of GT-1 has been found to occur independent of light, which was proposed to transmit signal to their targets through the phosphorylation of a threonine in the trihelix domain.8,14In the last decade, a dozen trihelix genes from various plants were cloned and characterized. They showed a large functional divergence, in processes such as: seed scattering during crop domestication, embryo development, morphogenesis control of manifold flower organs, and biotic and abiotic stresses resistance, etc.11,15–22 Most of the functions involved in plant development have been studied in Arabidopsis. The Arabidopsis transcription factor PETAL LOSS (PTL) was reported to function in the morphogenic control of manifold flower organs, such as the perianth, petals, and stamens.17,23 Several genes were reported to play divergent roles during the process of whole seed development.15,18,20 The knockout mutant (EDA31), a close member of PTL, was found to be involved in embryo sac development, as it blocked the development before fusion of polar nuclei.24 Another gene within the GT-1 clade, present in Arabidopsis (At5g63420), encodes a metallo-ß-lactamase-trihelix chimera that is abundantly expressed in seeds and has been proved an early embryogenesis requirement. The mutants asil1 and asil2 of another two GT factors, ASIL1 and ASIL2, have been shown to accumulate chlorophyll only at the late state of embryo development, which negatively regulates the albumin gene 2S3, as well as several other seed maturation genes in Arabidopsis.25 Recently, an important GT factor gene, SHA1, was characterized and shown to regulate the seed scattering process during domestication.19 This gene was identified by genetic variant and map-based cloning in rice, wild type of which can promote the function of the abscission layer in the pedicel of mature seeds.26 Although the gene members across the entire trihelix family participate in plant developmental programmes and light response, two recent studies suggest that some GT factors are also involved in the basic resistance of plants to abiotic stresses, especially salt tolerance.21,22 Overexpression of the GT-2-like soybean gene, GmGT-2B, was shown to increase tolerance to salt, drought, and freezing, while another gene, OsGT<U+03B3>-1, originally found in <U+03B3> clade, regulated salt resistance when using a reduced expression mutant and overexpressed transgenic lines.21,22While functional knowledge of TFs is still very limited, the currently characterized family members show an immense functional divergence. It is not known whether these functions share common underlying mechanisms. For example, the repression of growth of trichomes,16 inter-sepal zones,17 and the accumulation of storage products, except during late embryogenesis, may be regulated by similar molecular mechanisms.18,25 It will be an important step forward to establish functional relationships between the trihelix family members. There have been 30 gene members identified in Arabidopsis and rice; however, a more thorough systematic analysis is needed to uncover the evolutionary and functional information of this family.11,27 In this study, we investigated the evolutionary history, expression patterns, and transgenic lines of trihelix genes in planta for functional clues. A total of 12 available whole genomes were employed to identify gene family members and to evaluate phylogenetic relationships, genomic loci, subcellular localization, and structural characteristics. In order to further discern gene functions of this family, we combined the analysis with microarray data and semi-quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR) in response to various abiotic stress conditions. Two sorghum trihelix genes were further selected to be cloned and overexpressed in Arabidopsis for functional evaluation.2. Materials and methods2.1. Database search and sequence retrievalFull genome assemblies of 12 plant species representing eudicots (Arabidopsis thaliana), magnoliid dicots (Aquilegia coerulea and Mimulus guttatus), monocots (Brachypodium distachyon, Oryza sativa, Setaria italica, Zea mays, and Sorghum bicolor), ferns (Selaginella moellendorffii), mosses (Physcomitrella patens), and algae (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Ostreococcus lincimarinus) were downloaded from the Joint Genome Institute plant genomics database (http://www.Phytozome.net). The expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences of wheat were downloaded from NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information). The amino sequences of the trihelix domain were extracted from known members of putative trihelix genes in Nicotiana tabacum, A. Thaliana, and O. sativa, as described in PlnTFDB,1 which were used as a query for blast with a cut-off value of e-10. As for confirmation of the predicted genes, manual correction was performed using the online web server FGENESH (http://linux1.softberry.com/berry.phtml).28 The confirmed sequences were further subjected to verify the presence of the trihelix domain using conserved domain analysis.292.2. Phylogenetic analysisMultiple sequence alignments of the identified trihelix genes were performed by the Clustal W program using default parameters.30 To evaluate the fit of major models of amino acid substitutions, the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and Akaike information criterion (AIC) were applied to select the fit model that was followed by amino acid frequencies and rates of amino acid substitutions for each amino acid pair using discrete gamma distribution. The phylogenetic tree was constructed with the Molecular Evolution Genetic Analysis (MEGA) 5.0 software according to the fit model using the maximum-likelihood (ML) method and the bootstrap test was carried out with 1000 iterations.31 To ensure that the more divergent domains could contribute to the topology of the ML tree, all positions with <95% site coverage were eliminated.2.3. In silico microarray profiling and co-expression analysisThe expression data of Arabidopsis and rice trihelix genes were subjected to an online web-tool, Genevestigator (https://www.genevestigator.ethz.ch), against an Affymetrix platform using default parameters. The expression patterns of trihelix genes in particular organs and at specific growth conditions were presented as heat maps, in which the colour intensity corresponded to the expression level. Genes without probes and those of low quality were not generated for further study. For co-expression analysis, microarray CEL files of O. sativa were downloaded from GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). The microarray probe data were retrieved from Affymetirx. The robust multichip average method, provided by Affymetrix power tools (APTs), was used to convert Affymetrix probe level data into expression values.32 The Pearson correlation coefficient of two genes was calculated based on each Affymetrix microarray dataset after filtering out low-quality slides. In order to choose an appropriate cut-off value for co-expression gene network construction, we examined the distribution of random pairs, resulting in r = 0.585 as a positive co-expression relationship, and r = -0.465 as a negative co-expression relationship.33 The selected OsTrihelix genes from different sub-clades throughout phylogenetic analysis and their co-expressed genes were subjected to the Cytoscape program to visualize the co-expression gene network under edge-weighted force-directed layout.342.4. Chromosomal localization and domain structure predictionSyntenic gene datasets against chromosome regions among rice, brachypodium, maize, and sorghum were downloaded from PGDB (http://chinna.agtec.uga/edu/duplication). The pan-grass syntenic gene sets were downloaded from the CoGe (http://synteney.cnr.berkerley.edu/CoGe/). The selected collinear trihelix genes were visualized by the Circos program.35The crystal structure of the DNA-binding domain of Arabidopsis GT1 (Protein Data Bank code number 2JMW) was used as a template for constructing the structure models of the trihelix protein in each clade according to the phylogenetic analysis. Sequences from each clade were aligned by the Align 2D structure alignment program (homology module, InsightII; Accelrys), respectively. Structures were automatically built by the MODELER module of InsightII. MODELER uses a spatial restraint method to build a three-dimensional image of protein structure and is capable of generating a reliable predicted structure using probability density functions derived from homologous structures and general features of known proteins. Then, molecular dynamics simulations were carried out for the entire system to optimize all protein structures by the GROMACS 3.0 software.2.5. Abiotic stress treatments and RT–PCRSeedlings of the rice and sorghum were allowed to grow on mesh supported in plastic containers with Murashige and Skoog (MS) solution (16/8-h light/dark photoperiod, at 25°C, with 70% relative humidity) for 14 days.36 For abiotic stress treatments, seedlings were treated with salinity (250 mM NaCl), dehydration (25% of PEG 10,000), and cold (4°C). Leaves of five or more seedlings were harvested at 9 h, 1, 2 and 3 days after initiation of the treatments, frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen, and then stored at -80°C. Total RNA was extracted with the RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to manufacturer's instructions. The first-strand cDNA synthesis was conducted using a first-strand cDNA synthesis kit for RT–PCR (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). Semi-quantitative RT–PCR was then conducted as described previously.37 A total of 20 gene-specific primer pairs for rice and sorghum trihelix genes were designed. The actin gene was employed as an internal control (Supplementary Data).2.6. Subcellular localizationThe coding regions of Sb06g023980 (Clade I), Sb06g020670 (Clade II), Sb04g022190 (Clade III), Sb04g004960 (Clade IV), and Sb06g024110 (Clade V) were amplified and cloned into the pBIN35S:EGFP vector, which were transformed into Agrobacterium of GV3101. For transient expression of the fusion proteins in Nicotiana benthamiana, the resultant Agrobacterium culture was resuspended in infiltration medium (10 mM 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid hydrate, pH 5.6, 10 mM MgCl2, and 200 mM acetosyringone) and then injected into 4-week-old N. benthamiana leaves with an optical density of 0.5 OD at 600 nm. The addition of transformed 35S:EGFP Agrobacterium was used as a control. Confocal microscopy was used to assess the results at 3 days post-N. benthamiana leaf infection. Fluorescent images were obtained using an LSM 510 META NLO system (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).2.7. Transgenic Arabidopsis analysisAgrobacterium strains GV3101 containing pBIN35S:Sb06g023980 and pBIN35S:Sb07g02907 were used to transform Arabidopsis plants according to the floral-dip method.38 Transgenic lines were selected on MS agar plates containing 30 mg/l kanamycin and the T3 lines were used for further phenotypic analysis. Two-independent Sb06g023980 and Sb07g02907 overexpressing Arabidopsis lines were tested to observe the effects of cold, salt, and drought stresses. The transgenic seeds were germinated on 1/2 MS medium for 2 days and transferred into medium containing 75, 125, 150, and 180 mM NaCl for the salt tolerance test and moved to 4°C for cold tolerance analysis. Plant growth was then monitored and photographed after 14 days. For drought treatment, the wild-type and transgenic plants were grown in soil for 3 weeks, after which water was withheld for phenotype observations.3. Results3.1. Trihelix family in plantaFull genome sequences and ESTs from the algae C. reinhardtii and O. lincimarinus, the moss P. patens, the fern S. moellendorffii, the grass B. distachyon, O. sativa, S. italica, Z. mays, S. bicolor, and T. aestivum, the magnoliid dicot A. coerulea and M. guttatus, and the eudicot A. thaliana were blasted for trihelix genes with the putative trihelix-binding domain as a query. Initially, a total of 319 non-redundant putative trihelix genes were identified: 29 in P. patens, 25 in S. moellendorffii, 28 in B. distachyon, 30 in O. sativa, 39 in S. italica, 48 in Z. mays, 27 in S. bicolor and 8 in T. aestivum, 27 in A. coerulea, 28 in M. guttatus, and 30 in A. thaliana. However, no trihelix genes were found in algae. The identified trihelix genes showed divergent molecular characteristics with protein lengths ranging from 210 to 1045 amino acids, molecular weights ranging from 23.06 to 114.53 kDa, and isoeletric points ranging from 4.51 to 10.02 (Supplementary Data). To construct a phylogenetic tree, we first performed a model test among the putative trihelix proteins using an ML procedure.3,39 The models with the lowest AIC and BIC scores were considered to best describe the substitution pattern.40 In total, 48 different amino acid substitution models were tested by the MEGA 5.2.2 software using a discrete Gamma distribution. This revealed a Jones–Taylor–Thornton (JTT) evolutionary model with five categories that fitted the evolutionary pattern to construct the ML tree (Fig. 1). The topology of the phylogenetic tree, bootstrap values, and sequence identity (>30%) were used to classify the trihelix genes into five distinct clades. The moss and fern trihelix genes were found in relative rooting positions of Clades I, II, IV, and V, indicating they had independently diverged from ancestral land plants and further expanded from vascular plants and angiosperm (Supplementary Data and Supplementary Data). Clade III was the only to contain angiosperm-specific trihelix genes (Supplementary Data). All trihelix genes in Clades II, III, IV, and V contain a single trihelix domain; however, the members in Clade I are constituted by both single and double trihelix domains (Supplementary Data and Supplementary Data). Evidence did not indicate which domain emerged first; however, the existence of gene members with double domains from moss species indicate that the single or double domain structure of trihelix genes likely diverged early given their emergence in land plants (Supplementary Data).

In Clade I, the third a-helix often contained a conserved phenylalanine (F) and cysteine (C) instead of tryptophan. Previous research suggests that a fourth amphipathic a-helix with a conserved mode of (F/Y)-(F/Y)-X-X-(L/I/M)-X-X-(L/I/M) aids the third a-helix for DNA binding. Here, we found that it located closely downstream of the trihelix domain in most members of Clades I, II, III, and V, but not in Clade IV (Supplementary Data). Another conserved structure was located in the C-terminal half in members of all the clades, which is possibly associated with dimerization of these TFs (Supplementary Data). This domain seems rich of L and E, but not conserved between each clade.3.2. Genomic organization, structure, and subcellular localizationTo investigate the genomic organization of trihelix genes, duplication blocks were downloaded from the database, as described in Materials and methods. With the exceptions of chromosomes 6 and 7 of O. sativa and chromosome 10 of S. bicolor, the trihelix genes were evenly distributed on most chromosomes of the tested cereal species (Supplementary Data). Strong gene conservation was detected in duplication blocks and a collinear relationship with homologs was established for: 29 of 30 genes in O. sativa, the entire 28 genes in S. bicolor, the entire 28 genes in B. distachyon, and 43 of 47 genes in Z. mays (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Data). All the collinear gene pairs in O. sativa, S. bicolor, B. distachyon, and 30 genes in Z. mays were true orthologs between each species. A total of 13 collinear gene pairs between different chromosomes were detected in Z. mays, which likely resulted from the ancient tetraploidy processes in evolution.41 However, four Z. mays trihelix genes of GRMZM2G037493, GRMZM2G415229, GRMZM2G023119, and AC209784.3_FGT011 were not found in any duplication blocks, suggesting that there were independent gene duplication events (Fig. 2). The rice trihelix gene of Os03g18330 seems to be a tandem duplication copy of Os03g18340. Although most of the genes were well preserved in the tested cereal species, rare instances of gene loss after duplication were also detected, such as the ortholog of Sb06g015280 in rice, the orthologs of Os02g31160 and Os04g45940 in sorghum, and the ortholog of Os02g43300 in brachypodium (Supplementary Data).

The orthologous pairs between sorghum and zea maize are indicated by magenta, and the inter-homeologs of zea maize are indicated by yellow.To obtain the structural characteristics of the trihelix family, the sequences from each clade were aligned by the Align 2D structure alignment program using Arabidopsis GT1 as a template and the predicted structures were evaluated.42 Generally, the results of protein three-dimensional structure modelling illustrated that the structure of the trihelix factors in each clade was conserved, especially in the N-terminal domain (Supplementary DataA). Eighty-eight simulated trihelix structures were constructed and five typical structures were selected and superimposed to evaluate the goodness of fit of the overall topologies via Ramachandran plot analysis (Supplementary DataA and B). The constitution of amino acid residues showed the most favoured with the plots indicating the goodness of fit of selected models. Furthermore, the model within each clade confirmed the same conformation of the structural elements of helices. Structural modifications were present in loop regions of the C-terminal domain and in the linker between the N- and C-terminal domains, where the structural conservation is relatively varied according to the profile scores (Supplementary DataA and C). The protein sequence differentiation in these regions is high among protein members of each clade. This observation may be due to either relaxed functional constraints or to sequence divergence from the selected template.To further characterize this gene family, the subcellular localization of rice trihelix genes was studied. Five sorghum trihelix genes that are representative of one of the five clades, Sb06g023980, Sb06g020670, Sb04g004960, Sb04g022190, and Sb06g024110, were chosen to construct an EGFP fusion protein under the control of the 35S promoter and transitionally expressed in N. benthamiana leaves. The transient expression of 35S:EGFP was observed in both the cytosol and nuclei with a weak signal (Fig. 3A). When fused with the EGFP, all five of the rice trihelix genes directed nuclear expression exclusively, supporting functional roles in transcriptional regulation (Fig. 3B–F).

Transcriptional responses of trihelix genes against abiotic stressesTo investigate expression divergence, we first examined the expression pattern of the trihelix family of rice and Arabidopsis using public microarray data. Most of the trihelix genes in Arabidopsis were shown to be ubiquitously expressed at tissue-specific level; however, the genes in Clade I seemed to be preferably expressed in flower organs, whereas those in other clades showed a strong signal in seeds (Supplementary Data). Similar to Arabidopsis, most of the rice trihelix genes showed the tendency for ubiquitous expression in most plant organs, but rarely in pollen (Supplementary DataA). Furthermore, many rice trihelix genes in Clades I (Os04g45750, Os02g01380, Os02g43300, Os03g02240, and Os10g37240), II (Os04g51320), IV (Os04g32590 and Os02g07800), and V (Os05g48690, Os01g48320, Os09g38570, and Os04g45940) showed broad transcriptional responses against abiotic stresses, such as cold, drought, heat, and salt. Although the responses of individual genes varied according to the particular stressor employed (Supplementary DataB). Unexpectedly, the expression of Arabidopsis genes was rarely stimulated by abiotic stress, even though the transcripts of several genes (AT5G28300 and AT1G33240 in Clade I, AT2G38250 and AT5G01380 in Clade II) in root samples were shown to be up-regulated under drought or salt conditions (Supplementary DataB). For further validation, we next selected 10 genes in rice and their orthologs in sorghum to conduct semi-quantitative RT–PCR analysis with leaf tissue from seedlings subjected to high salinity (250 mM NaCl), dehydration (25% of PEG 10,000), and cold (4°C) conditions. Results similar to microarray data were obtained for the selected rice trihelix genes, in that all clades demonstrated stress-induced expression changes (Fig. 4). In Clade I, the expression of both Os04g45750 and Os02g43300 were stimulated by cold, salt, and drought conditions, whereas expression in the sorghum homologs, Sb06g023980 and Sb04g033390, were not influenced by any of the stressors. The expression of Os02g33610 was not induced by any of the tested stressors, while its ortholog, Sb04g005900, preserved the expression motif against cold and salt. In Clade II, the expression levels of Os04g40930 were decreased compared with those of the sorghum ortholog, Sb06g020670. In contrast, the orthologous pair of Os04g51320 and Sb06g027540, conserved the expression pattern in response to cold, drought, and salt (Fig. 4). Similar results were also observed in Clades III, IV, and V, where the expression between each gene member in the same clade or between orthologs showed a large divergence (Fig. 4). To obtain additional information regarding the functions of the trihelix family, we conducted co-expression analysis using rice microarray data. As expected, Os01g52090 and Os02g07800 were co-expressed with abiotic and biotic stress-related genes. Several genes of Os02g07800, Os05g48690, and Os02g33610 were found to be co-expressed with genes involved in nitrogen compound metabolic processes. Furthermore, the functional enrichment tests suggested that Os01g21590 and Os01g48320 were associated with the oxidation–reduction processes and the ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic processes, respectively, while Os09g38570, Os04g45750, and Os10g37240 were implicated in glycosylase activity and microtubule motor activity (Supplementary Data).

Functional characterization of transgenic plantaThe transcriptional responses to stress may be informative about the functions of trihelix genes. Here, both the Sb06g023980 in Clade I and Sb06g024110 in Clade V showed the response against cold, salt, or drought. They harbour one or two GT domains, respectively. To further examine their functions, we generated transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing lines (35S:Sb06g023980 and 35S:Sb06g024110) for stress tolerance test. Two-independent transgenic lines (T3) were selected depending on the expression levels under normal conditions (Fig. 5A). When grown at normal conditions in soil, no significant difference in phenotypes was observed between wild-type and transgenic plants. However, after exposure to drought stress (i.e. stopping irrigation for 10 days), the transgenic plants exhibited a higher tolerance than control plants (Fig. 5B). After watering again, the survival rates of Sb06g023980 transgenic plants reached 55.7% (34/61 for Line 1) and 51.9% (30/57 for Line 2), while Sb06g024110 transgenic plants reached 45.1% (23/51 for Line 1) and 38.2% (24/63 for Line 2), both of which were significantly higher than those of the control plants (32.1%, 27/84), respectively (Fig. 5D). For cold and salt tolerance, the root length test showed that the transgenic seedlings grew faster over a 7-day period and their roots were significantly longer (t-test, P < 0.01) than the wild type. No significant difference was observed between the transgenic and the wild-type seedlings under normal conditions (Fig. 5E–G). These results imply that heterogeneous overexpression of Sb06g023980 and Sb06g024110 genes in Arabidopsis can promote the rates of seedling growth and survival under drought, cold, and salt stress conditions.

By taking advantage of the recently sequenced plant genomes, we hereby identified the family members on the basis of sequence homology using the putative trihelix genes as a blast query. A total of 319 genes were found covering all of the tested land plants, while no algae trihelix genes were discovered. This result implies that the trihelix genes may have emerged since land plants during evolution. Interestingly, only eight genes in the EST database were identified for wheat, which is a hexaploid and should contain 2-3 times the number of gene members than diploid grass species, such as rice (30) and sorghum (28). One reason for this discrepancy may be incomplete profiling of the wheat gene, although the EST database reportedly covers ~95% of wheat transcriptome.43The trihelix family had previously been classified, using rice and Arabidopsis genes, into three distinctive subfamilies (GTa, GTß, and GT<U+03B3>).27 Here, we employed all the tested species in the analyses, covering the trihelix genes from moss, fern, and monocot and dicot plants. After applying the BIC and AIC test and constructing a phylogenetic tree using the ML procedure to classify the genes into five major clades, we used the JTT model of amino acid substitutions to evaluate phylogeny (Fig. 1). Upon examining the Arabidopsis and rice genes, we found that Clades II, IV, and V harbour the genes in a-subfamily, while Clades I and III mainly correspond to the ß and <U+03B3> subfamily. Because all the Clades I, IV, and V contain the trihelix genes in ancestral species at rooting positions, and thus we prefer to classify them in three different clades (Fig. 1). Similar to our study, Kaplan-levy et al. classified trihelix genes from rice and Arabidopsis into five clades, named GT-2, GT-1, SH4, SIP1, and GT<U+03B3>. However, that classification method placed the sub-branch containing At5g63420 and Os02g33610 (Clade I in the current study) into the GT-1 clade (Clade II in the current study).11 Our analysis revealed that two additional sub-branches, located on more rooted position of the aforementioned sub-branch, contain trihelix members only from ancestral species, such as Pp1s29_84V6, 409669 and Pp1s85_150V6. This finding supports the classification of this branch into Clade I (Supplementary Data). Furthermore, most of the genes containing a C-terminal trihelix domain were found to fall in Clade I (Supplementary Data), additional evidence that this sub-branch is appropriately classified in Clade I.A total of 31 rice trihelix members had been identified before by Kaplan-levy et al. However, we found that Os4g33300, a chimeric gene with a kinase domain at C-terminal, had lost the trihelix domain and was therefore excluded from this family in this study (data not shown).11 Moreover, previous reports indicate that there are two types of trihelix genes which harbour one or two GT domains, while the evolutionary turnover of these domains are unclear.27 In our study, both the single and double domain structures have been found in ancestral species in Clade I, revealing their early divergence during evolution (Supplementary Data).Characterization of trihelix genesThe Poaceae dates back to about 50–70 million years, with a gene expansion by the pre-grass whole genome duplication in the last common ancestor.44 The examination of the duplication blocks of the trihelix family among O. sativa, S. bicolor, B. distachyon, and Z. mays revealed that most trihelix gene copies were well preserved in the genome, suggesting the functional conservation of these genes. This conservation is apparent even in the trihelix family in B. distachyon, which experienced extensive independent genome reduction during evolution.45 In the case of Z. mays, a total of 43 collinear genes were detected, including only 13 gene pairs located on homeologous chromosomes. The true functional significance of the partial gene loss between duplication regions in Z. mays is unknown, but it is generally thought to be involved in returning an ancient allotetraploid to a genetically diploid state.41In Pfam, the trihelix transcription factor is classified into the myb/SANT-like family, as they all form an a-helix-turn-a-helix structure. However, the trihelix family is generally thought to feature a typical helix-loop-helix-loop-helix structure with an individual helix longer than the myb repeat, which targets different binding sequences.42 In our study, the trihelix family was classified into five major clades, all of which showed the typical features of the trihelix family as the previously described, such as the high conservation of tryptophan (W) and an additional F and L rich a-helix lying closely downstream to the trihelix domain (Supplementary Data). A recently reported solution structure of Arabidopsis GT-1 revealed that the three helices were held together by a hydrophobic core, and the third helix was likely responsible for DNA binding with the aid of the fourth helix.42 In our structural analysis, we found the predicted 3D structures were relatively conserved (Supplementary Data), although the sequence of a-helixes and the length of linker sequence between each a-helix were dynamic among clades (Supplementary Data). When testing the subcellular localization of the selected sorghum trihelix genes from each clade, the strong nuclear signals supported their functional roles in transcriptional regulation. However, the conservation or divergence of the binding sequence of the family members in each clade needs to be further investigated.Transcriptional responses of trihelix genes against abiotic stressesThe Arabidopsis and rice are model dicot and monocot plants. According to our analysis of the public rice microarray data, Clade I of Arabidopsis trihelix genes shows enriched expression in inflorescence, while genes in Clades II–V seemed more abundantly expressed in seeds (Supplementary Data). This is consistent with previously described functional roles of trihelix genes in flower and seed development.11,17,18 Conversely, the expression pattern of rice trihelix genes differs from that in Arabidopsis (Supplementary Data). Most family members in rice were broadly expressed during the plant life cycle and showed an extensive response to abiotic stresses. These findings were further confirmed by RT–PCR (Fig. 4). A robust response to cold, drought, and salt was also detected in gene members of sorghum, although the same expression pattern was not always conserved between sorghum and rice orthologs. It is yet to be determined whether the responses to abiotic stress are the major differences between dicots and monocots of this gene family. There is valuable knowledge to be gained by studying the evolutionary turnover of these functional roles involved in plant developmental programmes and abiotic stress resistance. The transcriptional divergence among the gene members in rice and sorghum is likely due to regulatory subfunctionalization, as it is very unlikely these genes independently evolved all of the functional roles in cold, drought, and salt tolerance.Functional characterization of transgenic plantaRecently, several trihelix genes from rice (in Clade III) and soybean (in Clade I) were reported to be involved in salt and drought tolerance,21,22 which broadens the functional roles of this family. Our transcriptional analysis on rice and sorghum revealed that the expression of trihelix genes within various clades was broadly stimulated by abiotic stress (Fig. 4), which implies that the functional involvement in abiotic stress resistance within this family might be conserved in grass. This supposition was further supported by the phenotypic analysis of transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing Sb06g024110 (one GT domain) in Clade V and Sb06g023980 (two GT domains) in Clade I. Both demonstrated increased drought, salt, and cold tolerance (Fig. 5). In contrast, our transcriptional study of Sb06g023980 showed that gene expression was not stimulated by drought (Fig. 4). This further supports the regulatory subfunctionalization of this gene family in sorghum.In this study, we established the trihelix family radiation in 10 plant species and carried out functional characterization. The current trihelix family, expanded in angiosperm, seems to be a common ancestor of land plants with a large functional divergence associated with regulation of light, stress, and a series of developmental programmes.11 The results of our current study indicate functional conservation within this family in transcriptional regulation responses to drought, salt, and cold. Furthermore, we believe this conservation to be of ancestral origin, rather than a newly evolved phenomenon. The extent of the functional diversification within the trihelix family across different species is a topic for further investigation. Results of our co-expression analysis suggest that examining the involvement of this gene family in nitrogen metabolic processes, oxidation–reduction processes, and glycosylase and microtubule motor activity may add to the existing evolutionary, transcriptional, and functional body of knowledge surrounding the trihelix transcription factor family.FundingThis work was financially supported by the National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program, 2014CB138100) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 31200982).

IntroductionAllowed by the redundancy of the genetic code, coding regions exhibit non-uniform usage of synonymous codons. This deviation from uniform codon usage is termed codon usage bias (CUB) and is related among others to various aspects of gene translation (and more generally gene expression) and its efficiency;1–10 specifically, it was suggested that it regulates transcription and translation, but may also be related to recombination rate. Indeed, it is known for over 30 years that in most organisms the degree of CUB of genes correlates with their expression levels.11–14Various approaches for quantifying the CUB of a gene have been suggested in the last decades: the effective number of codons, for instance, measures deviations from equal usage of synonymous codons,13 while other indices such as the frequency of optimal codons,15 the codon bias index,11 and the codon adaptation index (CAI)16 define a subset of ‘optimal’ codons and measure the frequency of these codons in the coding region of the gene.The CUB indices have been employed in hundreds of previous studies. For example, it is known that in many organisms (e.g. Escherichia coli) the CAI exhibits a very high correlation with protein levels (similar to the one obtained between mRNA levels and protein levels17); thus, CAI has been frequently used as a proxy of expression levels (see, for example,18–20). In addition, it has been employed in a vast number of key studies in the recent years.18,19,21,22One disadvantage of measures that are based on a set of reference genes11,16,23 is the fact that in the case of organisms with poor genomic data and without large scale cellular measurements, creating a meaningful reference set is challenging. Another disadvantage of these measures is the fact that they cannot separate between the various possible causes of CUB in highly expressed genes: some of them may be related directly to the translation process (e.g. co-evolution and/or adaptation to the tRNA pool8,24,25) and others may not be related to translation (e.g. GC content and folding9,26–28).In 2004, dos Reis et al.8 proposed the tRNA adaptation index (tAI), which aims to estimate only the adaptation of codons/genes to some aspects directly related to the elongation step occurs in the ribosome via the adaptation to the tRNA pool, wobble interactions, and properties of the ribosome. Specifically, the tAI considers the fact that different tRNA species can recognize a codon with different affinities.2,8,29 Thus, the tAI is different than CUB-based measurements mentioned above and provides important information related to translation that is not necessarily covered by CUB measures.Indeed, measures of the adaptation of genes to the tRNA pool (such as the tAI) have extensively been used in the recent years for studying questions in diverse biomedical disciplines such as evolutionary biology, functional genomics, and systems biology (see, for example,3,30–35).where tGCNij is the gene copy number of the jth tRNA that recognizes the ith codon (a proxy of the tRNA levels24,29,36), and Sij is a selective constraint on the efficiency of the interaction between the ith codon and the jth tRNA, which is scored between 0 (perfect interaction) and 1 (no interaction);8 specifically, the Sij weights can be related to aspects of translation elongation (tRNA, wobble interactions, and properties of the ribosome), as these aspects are expected to affect the efficiency of the codon–anticodon interaction. Wi values are calculated according to Crick's wobble rules for codon–anticodon pairing (Table 1). The codon relative adaptiveness value wi is obtained by dividing each Wi with the maximum Wi value over all codons.8 The tAI of a gene is defined as the geometric mean of the wi values of its codons. Crick's wobble rules for calculating WiThe Wi values are calculated based on Equation (1). The 64 codons are clustered in the genetic code into 16 groups, each one consists of four codons. The four codons in each group differ only in their third position (the wobble position). The formulas for calculating the Wi values for each of the four codons in the group are given in the table. i denotes the index of the codon in the quartet which ends with U, i + 1, i + 2, and i + 3 denote the three other codons which end with bases C, A, and G, respectively. j denotes the index of the tRNA whose anticodon starts with I; all base pairing between the ith codon and the jth anticodon are WC. j + 1, j + 2, and j + 3 denote the three other tRNAs whose anticodons start with bases G, U, and C, respectively. tGCNij represents the tRNA gene copy number corresponding to the interaction between the ith codon and the jth tRNA. For each codon, Wi sums over all tRNAs that can pair with the codon. For example, the GCU codon which ends with U can either pair with anticodons that start with I (IGC) and generate a standard WC base pairing, or pair with anticodons that start with G (GGC) and generate a wobble base pairing.Crick's wobble rules for calculating WiThe Wi values are calculated based on Equation (1). The 64 codons are clustered in the genetic code into 16 groups, each one consists of four codons. The four codons in each group differ only in their third position (the wobble position).

For each codon, Wi sums over all tRNAs that can pair with the codon. For example, the GCU codon which ends with U can either pair with anticodons that start with I (IGC) and generate a standard WC base pairing, or pair with anticodons that start with G (GGC) and generate a wobble base pairing.In 1966, Crick37 suggested that in some cases wobble pairing may occur in the third base of the codon. According to Crick, the pairing at the third codon position has to obey chemical constrains; thus, some of the optional parings will not occur. For example, the unlikely pairing of guanine–adenine is due to a side group of guanine, which cannot make one of its bonds. In addition to the four standard nucleotides, modified nucleosides often occupy the wobble position of the anticodon (usually position 34 of the tRNA). In fact, the wobble position is the most frequently modified nucleoside in tRNA.38,39 Inosine, for example, is a common modification of adenine that occurs in the wobble position of many tRNA species.39–43Out of the eight Sij weights, four are related to Watson–Crick (WC) interactions and the others are related to wobble interactions. In prokaryotic genomes, tRNAIIe has a unique wobble position nucleoside [lysidine (L) in bacteria and agmatidine (agm) in archaea], which recognizes the AUA codon;44 thus, the prokaryotic Sij set contains one additional wobble Sij weight. The different possible pairs at the wobble position and the current tAI weights of the corresponding interactions are summarized in Table 2. The different base-pairingsSij-values are given to the pairing between the first position of the jth anticodon (tRNA) and the third position of the ith codon. Sij-values of WC base pairs are shown in italics, wobble values are shown in bold. Interactions which are not included in the calculation of the tAI are marked with hyphens. Lysidine (L) is a bacterial RNA modification of the DNA nucleotide cytidine (c).44,45The different base-pairingsSij-values are given to the pairing between the first position of the jth anticodon (tRNA) and the third position of the ith codon. Sij-values of WC base pairs are shown in italics, wobble values are shown in bold. Interactions which are not included in the calculation of the tAI are marked with hyphens. Lysidine (L) is a bacterial RNA modification of the DNA nucleotide cytidine (c).44,45In the tAI, WC Sij weights are fixed to zero (perfect interactions) under the assumption of no constraint on these interactions. The wobble interaction weights are inferred by optimizing the correlation between gene expression levels (mRNA levels) and their corresponding tAI in Saccharomyces cerevisiae;8,46 the rationale behind this optimization is based on the following relations (which hold in many organisms): (i) there is correlation between mRNA levels and protein levels; (ii) there is correlation between translation rate and protein levels; and (iii) highly translated genes are under selection to include codons with higher adaptation to the tRNA pool.The possibility of having different wobble interaction weights across different genomes has not yet been comprehensively studied. Here, we develop a novel generic approach for species-specific estimation of the tAI Sij weights without the need of gene expression measurements; for convenience, we name the new measure: species-specific tAI (stAI). This measure includes different Sij weights for each organism. We show that the correlation between protein levels and stAI is higher than that between protein levels and tAI.Based on our approach, we infer the wobble Sij weights for a wide variety of organisms from the three domains of life, in order to examine the conjecture that organisms from different domains have significantly different Sij weights and to understand these differences.2. Materials and methods2.1. Computing the Sij weights of the stAI without the need of gene expression measurementsThe tAI weights are based on optimizing the correlation between tAI (Equation 1) and expression levels in S. cerevisiae and E. coli.8 However, large scale measurement of mRNA levels and specifically protein abundance (PA) are not available for most of the organisms with sequenced genomes.To solve this problem we develop an approach that is based on the assumption that highly expressed genes should have both higher adaptation to the tRNA pool (i.e. higher tAI) and higher CUB (i.e. less uniform distribution of codons).8 Thus, there should be a significant correlation between CUB and tAI. Based on this assumption, we find the Sij-values that optimize the correlation between CUB and stAI. Note that the optimized correlation is at the level of genes while for each gene both measures are based on its codons content. Below we provide additional details about our approach including the CUB measure that we use.2.2. Relative codon biasRCBS takes into account base compositional bias, to get a more reliable measure of highly favoured codon frequency while controlling for other features of the coding sequence such as GC content bias.According to Equation (2), rare codons will be given lower dxyz (i.e. a value close to -1) while a very frequent codon will be given a higher dxyz value (e.g. it can be 1). Thus, very rare codons decrease the final RCBS score of the gene and very frequent ones increase its final RCBS score (see Equation 3). However, we believe that (almost by definition) genes with very high CUB should include both very frequent codons and very rare codons. For example, if a hypothetical amino acid A has two codons, one is ‘optimal’, and the second is ‘not optimal’, we expect a very highly expressed codon usage biased gene to have a very high dxyz score for the first one and a very low dxyz score for the second one. But, we wish that both cases/codons will contribute to the same direction and increase the RCBS score.As we later demonstrate, in our framework the DCBS gives better results than the RCBS.Finally, it is important to emphasize the fact that both RCBS and DCBS control for mutation bias. Specifically, when we compute the DCBS (see above), the frequency of each codon [f(x,y,z)] is normalized by the expected frequency under the assumption that the different nucleotides are independent [f1(x)·f2(y)·f3(z)]; the later represents among others the mutation bias. The measure that we use is based on the frequency of the codon normalized by the expected frequency according to the mutation bias, and thus control for mutational bias (see also Supplementary Data regarding the way our approach controls for possible factors affecting CUB).2.3. Inferring the parameters of the stAIThe stAI inferred here is based on the same equations of the tAI with an organism-specific Sij-values' set (Equation 1), which is based on a measure of CUB. For every genome used in this study, the unique Sij set was inferred by optimizing the non-parametric (Spearman) correlation between DCBS (Equations 4 and 5) and stAI (Equation 1). To avoid convergence to local maxima point, we used various starting points. Specifically, we included in the set of starting points the original weights of the tAI8 and also the two extreme values of these weights (all zeros and all ones). In order to choose a set of starting points, we halved the allowed region of the Sij values (i.e. the region: Sij between 0 and 0.5, and the region: Sij between 0.5 and 1) and considered all combinations for sampling values from these two regions (24 possibilities for the four eukaryotic wobble Sij and 25 for the five prokaryotic wobble Sij); thus, organisms from the same domain shared the same set of starting points. For each specific starting point, we used a hill climbing search method to iteratively optimize the Sij weights using a variable step size (starting with an initial step size of 0.3 and finishing with step size of 0.001). At each step size, when a new optimum was not found, the step size was decreased by a factor of 1.35. Iteration of the hill climbing included a random choice of Sij elements to change and a direction (i.e. increasing and decreasing) that increases the correlation between stAI and DCBS. The final chosen set of Sij was the one exhibited the maximum correlation between the stAI and DCBS. In order to determine whether the chosen set of starting points constituted a sufficient sample of the search space for the algorithm convergence, we added 100 more random starting points. The additional points provided no significant change in the final correlation between stAI and DCBS.2.4. Comparison of the hill climbing method to Nedler–Mead search methodThe Nedler–Mead (NM) optimization48 is the search method used to infer the Sij-values of the original tAI.8 When considering similar set of initiation points, our heuristic search outperformed the NM in finding the maxima of the objective function (i.e. the correlation between stAI and DCBS) in six of the eight model organisms (and was quite similar in the other two). We do not claim that hill climbing is better than NM; however, in the case of the specific problem analysed here (where the hill climbing explores the search space very well), and when considering the Matlab implementation of NM, the hill climbing was a bit better.2.5. The analysed organismsOur analysis included 100 different organisms (archaea, bacteria, and eukarya), in which CUB was correlated with the amount of adaptation to the tRNA pool. The correlation between stAI and DCBS/RCBS determined whether or not a tested genome would participate in the analysis. We excluded organisms in which an insignificant positive correlation or a significant negative correlation was observed; in such organisms, the assumptions that connect stAI to CUB do not hold and thus our method cannot be implemented. A detailed list of the excluded organisms is provided in Supplementary Data.2.6. Generating randomized genes sequencesRandom sequences were generated according to the real genomic codon distribution. For each of the 100 genomes studied in this work, 20 randomizations were performed by randomly drawing codons from the calculated genomic distribution and maintaining the protein content of the original genome.2.7. Genomic sequencesIn addition to the model organisms, which were chosen due to their available proteins measurements, we selected the genomes according to the list from ref.49, while trying to build relatively balanced group size wise (thus since bacteria was significantly larger than other groups in the list, we only included organisms of the three major phylums provided there: Cyanobacteria, Alphprobacteria, Gamma-probacteria).Coding sequences of all 100 species were retrieved from the NCBI (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/). Genomic tRNA copy numbers of all species except Aspergillus nidulans, Debaryomyces hanasenii, and Candida albicans were obtained from the Genomic tRNA Database (http://gtrnadb.ucsc.edu/). For A. nidulans, D. hanasenii, and C. albicans, we used the tRNA copy number as reported in ref.30. A detailed list of all organisms analysed here is provided in Supplementary Data.2.8. Protein abundanceLarge scale protein abundance (PA) measurements of S. cerevisiae, E. coli, Arabidopsis thaliana, Shigella dysentariae, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, and Leptospira interrogans were retrieved from paxdB (http://pax-db.org/#!home). For S. cerevisiae, E. coli, S. dysentariae, and L. interrogans, a few datasets were provided. In this case, a weighted average between the different PA values was taken (i.e. we averaged the datasets after normalizing each of them such that they have identical average). Schizosaccharomyces pombe expression levels were obtained from ref.50. The protein levels of some of the multiple cellular organisms were based on analysis of multiple tissues (A. thaliana, D. melanogaster, and C. elegans) (see details in http://pax-db.org/#!home). Specifically, we analysed all protein levels data that were available in paxdB (http://pax-db.org/#!home) on 2012. Note that in mammals it has been shown that the tRNA levels in various tissues tend to be correlative (the ranking of the tRNA genes abundance remains similar while the average value might change51); this is probably the case in many other organisms.2.9. Permutation test for comparing two Sij meansAn empirical P-value was computed to test the null hypothesis that the means of two Sij distributions do not significantly differ between two groups of organisms; let n and m denote the number of organisms in the two groups, respectively. For each Sij component of the weights vector, we performed the following steps: first, we defined the normalized distance between the Sij means in the two groups of organisms as the absolute difference between the means divided by the sum of the two corresponding standard deviations (SDs). Secondly, we permute the Sij elements of the two groups by randomly drawing n values as the first group and m (non-overlapping) values as the second group. The random permutations were performed 100 times, each time the distance between the two random groups was computed. Finally, the P-value was defined as the number of times the random distance was higher or equal to the original distance divided by 100.2.10. Spearman correlation as a measure to guide the optimizationThe main advantage of this measure is the fact that it is a non-parametric measure that captures any monotonic relationship between CUB and stAI. Since this measure has been successfully employed in many papers in the field in this context,18,52,53 we decided to use it also here.2.11. The general rational related to evaluating the stAI and demonstrating that stAI outperforms tAIIn this section, we would like to explain and emphasize the rational related to the analyses reported in this study. First, as mentioned in the section Introduction, CUB measurements such as the CAI quantify different gene expression aspects than the tAI. Here, we aim at improving the tAI (and not the CUB indices such as the CAI) and thus, our major baseline for stAI evaluations is the tAI (and not the CUB indices such as the CAI). Secondly, we use the correlations with PA as an indirect way to evaluate the stAI: we expect that genes with higher translation efficiency will have higher PA; we also expect that a better measure related to the adaptation to the tRNA pool will have higher correlation with translation efficiency; thus, we expect that a better measure related to the adaptation to the tRNA pool will have higher correlation with PA. It is clear that there can be CUB-based measurements with higher correlation with PA than stAI (see, for example,54)—however, as mentioned, the aim of this study is not to infer PA predictor but to improve the inference of the tAI parameters.3. Results3.1. The correlation between the CUB and tRNA pool varies among different organismsA correlation between CUB and stAI is expected; however, the strength of this correlation among different organisms can teach us about the evolutionary forces shaping their genomes.The correlations between stAI and DCBS obtained in the algorithm vary from a lowest value of 0.1136 (for the archaea Halomicrobium mukohataei) to a highest correlation of 0.7626 (for the fungi Yarrowia lipolitica). The bottom 10% correlations were obtained in prokaryotic genomes (the four archaea: H. mukohataei, Archaeoglobus fulgidus, Pyrobaculum aerophilum, and Metallosphaera sedula; and the six bacteria: Anabaena variabilis, Brucella suis, Gloeobacter violaceus, Prochlorococcus marinus MIT9313, Synechococcus elongates, and Trichodesmium erythraeum); thus, in this organisms, selection for CUB is presumably either weak or/and not strongly related to translation elongation and the tRNA pool.The top 10% of the correlations were obtained mainly in eukaryotic genomes (the eight fungi: C. albicans, C. glabrata, Eremothecium gossypii, Saccharomyces bayanus, S. mikatae, S. paradoxus, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Y. lipolitica; and the two bacteria: E. coli and Pasteurella multocida); in these organisms, the selection for CUB is probably strongly related to the tRNA pool and translation elongations. All correlations are reported in Supplementary Data.3.2. The stAI exhibits better PA predictions than the tAI in non-fungal organismsThe correlations between stAI and PA are presented in Fig. 1. All eight models showed significant correlations. In six of the eight organisms, the correlation between stAI and PA was higher than that between tAI and PA. This result (Table 3) indicates that stAI outperforms the current tAI as a predictor of PA in all non-fungal organisms. For the two fungi used here (S. cerevisiae and S. pombe), the original tAI predicted PA better than the stAI. This result is not surprising since the Sij-values in the tAI were inferred based on the optimization of the correlation between tAI and S. cerevisiae mRNA expression levels8 (which strongly correlates with PA in S. cerevisiae; Spearman correlation of 0.74, P< 0.000155); on the other hand, stAI is based on CUB, which is a less accurate measure of protein levels. However, for most of the sequenced genomes exist to date, expression levels are not available; thus, the stAI is valuable.

The correlations (and P-values) are calculated for the eight model organisms with PA measurements which include three bacteria (A–C), three non-fungal eukaryotes (D–F), and two fungi (G–H).We emphasize that although previous studies reported a significant positive correlation between CUB and expression levels in the model organisms studied here,12,23,56,57 it is not trivial that Sij optimization based on CUB improves the correlation with protein levels. Specifically, CUB is correlated with protein levels, but mRNA levels and protein levels in different organisms are also usually correlated;52,58,59 thus it is not clear that Sij optimized based on the CUB of the organism necessarily have higher correlation with protein levels than the Sij optimized based on mRNA levels of S. cerevisiae.3.3. Robustness analysis demonstrates that in non-fungal organisms the stAI outperforms the tAI in terms of the correlation with PAIn order to empirically estimate the organism-specific probability that stAI (which is based on DCBS) improves the correlation with PA, a jack-knifing approach was implemented. One round of it involved the implementation of the algorithm for calculating the stAI on a sample of random subset of 50% of the proteins. Finally, the correlation between stAI and PA was computed for the sample and was compared with the correlation of PA with two related indices: the original tAI and stAI that is based on RCBS (i.e. its Sij were inferred from RCBS and not from DCBS). This procedure was repeated 100 times where each time the index exhibited the highest correlation with PA was counted (Fig. 2).

The middle bars representing the number of times (based on the jack-knifing analysis) the stAI outperformed the other versions of the tAI; as can be seen, stAI outperforms tAI in all non-fungal organisms.As can be seen, the results demonstrate again that for non-fungal organisms, the species-specific inference of the Sij tends to predict PA better than the traditional tAI. The 100 Sij sets, their corresponding correlations between stAI and DCBS and the full taxonomy for each organism, are provided in Supplementary Data.3.4. Sij inferred based on CUB are similar to the Sij inferred based on PAIn order to check whether the Sij that are inferred based on CUB (i.e. based on the DCBS) converge to similar values as those which are based on expression levels, we computed Sij sets by optimizing the correlation between stAI and PA for the model organisms with available PA measurements. This approach of using expression levels to optimize the tAI was employed in the study of ref.8. The Spearman rank correlation between the concatenated vectors of Sij-values (35 points) inferred based on the DCBS and the one inferred based on PA is 0.6902 (P-value <10-5; permutation P-value <0.001; 35 points). The Euclidean distance between the two vectors is also significantly lower than the one obtained by random permutation of the two vectors; specifically, when we performed 1,000 permutations of these values, all of them had higher Euclidean distance (P-value <0.001). The Sij-values that were obtained via correlation with DCBS and the ones obtained via correlation with PA are provided in Supplementary Data.3.5. Considering all tRNA–codon pairing possibilities do not improve the performances of the stAIThere are possible cases of non-standard base pairing that currently are not included in the tAI wobble rules (U–U binding for instance). It is interesting to check whether introducing such additional rules to the model can improve its performances. Using Equation (1), we included in the set of Sij all missing pairing options (U:U, C:U, U:C, C:C, C:A, G:A, I:G, and G:G). An initial weight of 0.5 was given to all non-WC Sij (WC Sij are fixed to zero). Nevertheless, considering all possible pairings in the stAI weights calculation did not improve the correlation of the stAI with DCBS or with PA. The original approach (i.e. WC and wobble only) reached higher maxima values for seven of the eight models. In addition, for five of the eight models, better correlations with PA, were obtained for the original stAI.3.6. Adding constraint on WC interactions do not improve the performances of the stAIThe first four Sij weights, which represent the constraint on WC interactions, are fixed to zero. Assuming that these interactions might not be perfect and thus allowing them to change during the optimization did not provide further improvement. The starting point for each model was the one exhibited the maximum correlation between stAI and DCBS in the original search. The original search, in which WC Sij are fixed to zero, reached higher maxima values for five of the eight models; in addition, in five of the eight models, the original search exhibited a better correlations with PA than the new search.3.7. Distances between the inferred Sij-values correlate with evolutionary proximityIn the next step, we aimed at understanding if the organism-specific Sij-values reflect evolutionary proximity and if they are biologically meaningful. To this end, the inferred Sij-value sets of the 100 organisms were clustered into three groups using the k-means algorithm.60 We compared the clustering result to the clusters obtained by partitioning the organisms to the three domains of life. The clustering correctly classified 77% of the 26 eukarya, 45% of the 38 bacteria, and 67% of the 36 archaea (Fig. 3). In general, 61% of the total 100 organisms were classified into the correct domain.

None of the 20 randomizations outperformed the original clustering (with respect to total correct classifications, empirical P-value <0.05). This result demonstrates that with high probability the reported clustering cannot be obtained randomly even when considering randomized genomes with similar features to the original ones (global CUB and the same proteome), supporting the conjecture that the obtained Sij-value similarities correlate with the evolutionary distances and thus have biological meaning.Finally, it is important to mention that there is co-evolution between CUB and tRNA levels (see, for example,24,34,61,62). Specifically, based on various theories, the CUB should co-evolve with the tRNA pool and the tRNA–codon interaction efficiencies to optimize the organism fitness; thus, CUB, tRNA levels, and tRNA–codon interactions cannot be separated.3.8. Similarities among the inferred Sij-values of the analysed organismsThe mean efficiency of the different inferred codon–anticodon interactions over all the analysed organisms are summarized in Table 4. The results emphasize the similarities among the different organisms and domains. The mean inferred wobble Sij-valuesThe mean inferred wobble Sij-values strength for each domain of life and for the entire analysed dataset (last row).The mean inferred wobble Sij-valuesThe mean inferred wobble Sij-values strength for each domain of life and for the entire analysed dataset (last row).As mentioned, Sij-values are between 0 and 1. Since these values represent a constraint on the codon–anticodon interactions, interactions with lower values are considered more efficient. For example, it can be seen from Table 4 that the inosine–cytosine interaction has the lowest mean value (sI:C = 0.42), while the wobble inosine–adenosine has the largest mean value (sI:A = 0.76). This suggests a good I:C interaction and an inefficient I:A interaction. These findings are supported by Murphy and Ramakrishnan.63 where it is stated that the decoding of adenosine-ending codons by inosine is inefficient. It is also mentioned that the inosine–cytosine interaction is very similar to the canonical G:C pair.SL:A and Sagm:A have a similar distribution, and the corresponding P-value proves that the mean values are not significantly different (see Fig. 4E). Since agmatidine is in many ways similar to lysidine (see ref.64), it makes sense that their Sij-values are similar.

Each figure contains three histograms representing the Sij in the different domains of life; the mean and SD of the Sij-values in each domain are also reported.

Differences among the inferred Sij-values of different groups of organismsTo test the hypothesis that the Sij-values of different organisms groups (i.e. different domains or different phylums within the same domain) have significantly different means, we computed an empirical permutation P-value (see section 2). The Sij distributions and their corresponding P-values are presented in Fig. 4.As can be seen, the sI:C distribution is similar between the three domains (Fig. 4B); however, sU:G, sI:A, and sG:U tend to be significantly different among the three domains. An empirical P-value was used also for the comparison between the two major phylums within each domain. The only significant difference was obtained for the sI:A distribution of eukarya subgroups Opisthokonta vs. Viridiplantae and bacteria subgroups Proteobacteria vs. Cyanobacteria (see Fig. 5). All other insignificant Sij distributions among different phylums appear in Supplementary Data.

DiscussionIn this study, we describe a new approach for inferring the efficiency of wobble interactions in the tAI without prior knowledge about the expression levels of the analysed organism. The approach is based on the fact that in most organisms highly expressed genes have higher CUB which is, at least partially, due to selection for improved adaptation of the codons to the tRNA pool of the organism. With our approach we infer the efficiency of wobble interactions via optimizing the component of the CUB that is due to adaptation to the tRNA pool (i.e. the correlation between these two measures: CUB and adaptation to the tRNA pool).Thus, one limitation of our approach (and other CUB-based approaches) is the fact that it will not work in the case of organisms with no strong enough selection for both CUB and the adaptation to the tRNA pool in highly expressed genes; specifically, we assume that the evolutionary selection for this two phenomena tend to be stronger when the gene expression is higher.In addition, we show that with our approach we are able to infer the efficiency of wobble interactions in non-fungal organisms better than the conventional approach (the tAI that does not optimize these values for each organism separately). In addition, we provide the estimations of these values for 100 organisms and show that they vary among different organism and correlate with evolutionary proximity. We report the similarities and differences among the inferred efficiencies of the analysed organisms.PA measurements rather than mRNA level measurements are more appropriate for estimating the extent to which a coding sequence feature is related to translation efficiency. Thus, the improved correlation between stAI and PA exhibited for the non-fungal model organisms relatively to the correlation between tAI and PA demonstrates the advantages of our novel approach. Specifically, the improved correlation between stAI and PA indicates a strong association between translation efficiency (and thus PA), and the combined information the stAI provides which includes the co-adaptation of CUB to the tRNA pool, and the efficiency of the different wobble interactions.Currently, there are less than a few dozen large scale measurements of protein levels, while there are >25,000 sequenced genomes. In addition, in the case of most of the organisms on earth, it is much easier to sequence their genomes, while it is usually impossible to culture them in order to measure their protein levels (see, for example,65). Our approach can improve the study of translation and evolution in such organisms, even if there are no available gene expression measurements.The idea of different domains having different wobble Sij-values is supportive with the successful significant clustering reported in this study. The differences between the bacterial and eukaryotic ribosomes66,67 might provide a plausible explanation to this result as specific physical, chemical, and geometrical constraints are imposed on each tRNA–codon interaction. In the budding yeast, for example, the wobble inosine tRNA modification is essential for viability.40 This result is in line with a recent study68 that two kingdom-specific tRNA modifications are major contributors that separate archaeal, bacterial, and eukaryal genomes in terms of their tRNA gene composition. Specifically, with our approach, we were able to provide information about the interaction efficiencies that tend to vary among the different domains (sU:G, sI:A, and sG:U) and within some of the domains (sI:A); in addition, we show that the efficiencies of some of the interactions are conserved in all the domains (sI:C). Combining this information with additional information such as phylogenetic analysis, three dimensional conformations of the ribosome and tRNA molecules and knowledge related to tRNA modifications can provide a better understanding of the exact structure of the ribosome and tRNA molecules, their biochemical interactions, and their evolution.We further verified that modelling non-conventional interactions between nucleotides does not significantly improve our model. Thus, our analysis supports the conjecture that, in the analysed organisms, wobble/WC interactions/parameters that appear in the original tAI measure should not be updated.Finally, there has been a debate about the causality of the tRNA adaptation/protein level relations. Some previous studies suggested that increasing the adaptation to the tRNA pool has direct effect on translation rate and thus on protein levels.34,69 However, other studies have suggested that this relation is not causal: endogenous highly expressed genes have higher adaptation to the tRNA pool via reasons that are not directly related to the translation rate.62,70 For example, it has been suggested that the adaption of highly expressed genes to the tRNA pool improves the global ribosomal allocation among genes based on the fact that genes with higher adaptation to the tRNA pool consume less ribosomes;9,70,71 it was also suggested that evolution maintains a balance between codon frequency and the cellular levels of the tRNA genes such that the actual translation elongation speed is constant;62 highly expressed genes have higher adaptation to the tRNA pool since the effect of these genes on maintaining this balance is higher than in the case of lowly expressed genes.62 It is important to mention that the success of our approach is robust to the outcome of this debate. The fact that highly expressed genes have higher adaptation to the tRNA pool as reflected by the wobble interactions and the cellular tRNA levels is enough for the success of our approach, the exact biophysical/evolutionary mechanism does not matter.FundingThis study was supported in part by a fellowship from the Edmond J.

Introduction1.1. Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 as a model for fundamental and applied research in cyanobacteriaThe production of biofuels based on oxygenic photosynthesis in metabolically engineered cyanobacteria is considered a major resource for future energy.1–8Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (from here: Synechocystis 6803), a unicellular cyanobacterium naturally competent for DNA uptake and chromosomal integration by homologous recombination,9–12 is frequently used in these studies. However, Synechocystis 6803 is also widely used in fundamental research on ecological or photophysiological questions and to unravel the reactions and metabolites of photosynthetic primary metabolism.13–15Based on global proteomic16,17 or microarray-based approaches,18–20 the response of Synechocystis 6803 to many different environmental conditions has been elucidated. A genome-wide mapping of its transcriptional start sites (TSSs) under standard growth conditions revealed 3,527 active TSSs,21 from which only one-third (1,165) was located within a distance of 100 nt upstream of an annotated gene or associated with pyrosequencing reads reaching into the coding sequence (gTSS), while another third (1,112) was on the reverse complementary strand of 866 genes (aTSS), suggesting massive antisense transcription. Last but not least, 429 seemingly orphan TSSs (nTSSs) located in intergenic regions led to the prediction of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Thus, with ~64% of all TSSs, the major transcriptional output was found to consist of ncRNA in a genome that is to 87% protein-coding.21 However, the existing genome-wide map of TSSs was inferred from cultures grown under standard growth conditions only. Therefore, the suite of promoters active under different conditions has largely remained unknown, rendering the systematic comparison of promoter sequences and putative regulatory elements impossible.1.2. Comparative approaches to microbial transcriptomic analysesRNA-seq and especially differential RNA-seq-type transcriptomic analyses (dRNA-seq22) are powerful analytical tools. Comparative transcriptomics has been used to study the differences in transcriptional regulation under different environmental conditions. Such an analysis compared the primary transcriptomes of the major human pathogen Helicobacter pylori under mid-logarithmic growth phase versus acid stress conditions, mimicking the host environment.22 Comparative analysis of the primary transcriptome of the cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 revealed >10,000 TSSs active during the differentiation of N2-fixing heterocysts, from which >900 TSSs exhibited minimum fold changes of eight, suggesting a large number of hitherto unidentified regulators of cell differentiation and N2-fixation.23Here, we describe a large-scale approach to analyse the response of the Synechocystis 6803 primary transcriptome to different, environmentally relevant stimuli. We established genome-wide maps of the 5,162 TSSs active under at least one of the 10 different growth conditions, which were employed to identify 4,091 transcriptional units (TUs) on the chromosome and the plasmids pSYSA, pSYSG, pSYSM and pSYSX. Based on a unique expression factor (UEF) for every TSS, we describe regulons and relevant promoter sequences for 10 conditions important for photosynthetic growth at single-nucleotide resolution.2. Materials and methods2.1. Biological material and growth conditionsWe used the Synechocystis 6803 strain ‘PCC-M’24 throughout this work. Liquid cultures were grown in 100 ml Erlenmeyer flasks using 75 ml of BG11 medium25 at 30°C under continuous white light illumination of 50–80 µmol quanta m-2 s-1 and a continuous stream of air to the desired growth phase (OD750 = 0.6–0.8). For the transcriptome analyses, cells were harvested from exponentially growing cultures which were then transferred to nine different conditions: (i) cold stress, 15°C for 30 min; (ii) heat stress, 42°C for 30 min; (iii) Ci depletion, cells were washed three times with carbon-free BG11 and cultivated further for 20 h; (iv) dark, no light for 12 h; (v) Fe2+ limitation, addition of iron-specific chelator desferrioxamine B (DFB) and further cultivation for 24 h; (vi) high light, 470 µmol quanta m-2 s-1 for 30 min; (vii) N depletion, cells were washed three times with nitrogen-free BG11 and cultivated further for 12 h; (viii) P depletion, cells were washed three times with phosphate-free BG11 and further incubated for 12 h; (ix) stationary phase, cells were grown until an OD750 of 4.7 was reached.2.2. RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis and sequencingSynechocystis 6803 cultures were harvested by rapid filtration on hydrophilic polyethersulfone filters (Pall Supor 800 Filter, 0.8 µm). The filter covered with cells was immediately immersed in 1 ml of PGTX solution26 and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted and analysed by gel electrophoresis and Northern blotting as described.27 For each condition, total RNA from two independent cultures was pooled for the following analyses. For sequence analysis, cDNA libraries were constructed (vertis Biotechnologie AG, Germany) and analysed on an Illumina sequencer as previously described.23 The dRNA-seq protocol22 distinguishes treated and untreated libraries. For the treated libraries, total RNA was fragmented with ultrasound (four pulses of 30 s at 4°C) and RNA species that carry a 5' mono-phosphate were degraded using Terminator™ 5' phosphate-dependent exonuclease (TEX, Epicentre). The exonuclease-resistant mRNA (mainly primary transcripts with 5'-PPP) was poly(A)-tailed using poly(A) polymerase. Then, 5'-PPP RNA was cleaved enzymatically using tobacco acid pyrophosphatase (TAP), ligated to an RNA linker23 and first-strand cDNA synthesis initiated using an oligo(dT)-adapter primer and M-MLV reverse transcriptase. The second-strand cDNA synthesis was primed with a biotinylated antisense 5'-Solexa primer, after which cDNA fragments were bound to streptavidin beads. Bead-bound cDNA was blunted and 3' ligated to a Solexa adapter. The cDNA fragments were amplified by 10–12 cycles of PCR. The resulting cDNA samples were double-stranded with a size of ~150–700 bp. For the untreated libraries, we pooled total RNA from samples representing all 10 growth conditions and depleted rRNA using the MICROBExpress kit (Ambion). Except for the TEX treatment, the libraries were handled as described for the treated libraries.2.3. Read mapping and data normalizationA total of 344,768,773 reads was obtained for the 10 different conditions. The data were deposited in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive under accession SRP032228. A total of 300,073,773 reads (56,611,278 non-ribosomal reads) were mapped to the genome with segemehl28 using default parameters. The data were normalized in two steps. First, the treated libraries were scaled to library sizes of 100 million reads. Positions with read starts =500 and with a ratio >0.5 between read starts and coverage were defined as true primary positions. In a second step, library-specific correction factors based on the fraction of counts at true primary positions were applied. For the two untreated libraries, we obtained 33,357,164 and 31,985,927 reads, of which 4,058,785 and 3,039,856 mapped to non-ribosomal regions. The counts for the two untreated libraries were scaled to counts per 100 million and averaged.2.4. Prediction of TUsAutomated detection of TUs by RNAseg29 is based on start positions and coverage by reads from the treated libraries and the coverage by reads from the untreated libraries. We used a combined dataset of all treated libraries, which provides for each genomic position the maximum number of read starts from any library together with the coverage from the same library. For the TU prediction, RNAseg was applied with the following settings: ‘-R 500 -l 0.5 -a 100 -k 20,000 -u 200 -w 100’. Thus, a TU has to have a minimum of 500 reads from a treated library starting at its TSS, a ratio of at least 0.5 for reads starting from the treated library versus those covering the TSS, an average coverage of 100 reads from the untreated library and a maximum length of 20 kb. Non-TU regions must not exceed an average coverage of 200 from the untreated library. The chromosome was split into 35 parts of ~100 kb length overlapping by 20,000 nt. For each part, RNAseg produced predictions with different numbers of TUs up to a maximum, which was imposed by the parameter settings. We extracted the maximal number of TUs for the individual parts and merged them. In the case of inconsistencies in the overlapping regions, the longer TU was kept. RNAseg cannot handle overlapping TUs, which originate from internal TSSs (iTSSs). As a result, a TU may end directly in front of an iTSS, while it likely extends to the same end as the transcript originating from this iTSS. Therefore, adjacent TUs were merged when their contact point was located within an annotated gene on the same strand. The contact points were stored as candidate iTSS. We termed a TU gTU when one or more annotated genes were covered, aTU when it was antisense to annotated genes or TUs (overlap =20 nt), iTU when the TU was located within an annotated gene and nTU when it was free-standing. The classification of a TU is frequently ambiguous, e.g. a TU covering annotated genes, extending into a region antisense to a downstream gene or TU on the opposite strand, as it is known for excludons.30 In such cases, we provided all possible notations with an order of g > a, which for gene internally located TSSs (iTSSs) was further complemented by an ‘i’. Thus, a TU starting at an iTSS, covering an annotated gene and extending into an antisense region, was termed gaiTU.2.5. Leaderless transcript detectiongTSSs that were mapped to start codons, either the A of AUG or the preceding 10 nucleotides, were subjected to a closer inspection. If N-terminally shorter homologues in other bacteria were found, these gTSSs indicated mis-annotated start codons and the corresponding gene locations were updated.2.6. Northern blot analysisSelected transcripts were verified by Northern hybridization using single-stranded radioactively labelled RNA probes, which were generated by in vitro transcription as described.31 The oligonucleotides used to amplify the according probe templates are listed in Supplementary Data. For the analysis, 3 µg of total RNA were separated on 1.5% agarose gels, transferred to Hybond-N nylon membranes by capillary blotting and cross-linked by UV-illumination and hybridized, as described earlier.31 Signals were visualized by using a Personal Molecular Imager FX system with Quantity One software (Bio-Rad).3. Results3.1. High-resolution transcriptomesWe isolated total RNA from cells cultivated under 10 different conditions (darkness, high light, cold and heat stress, depletion of iron, phosphate, nitrogen or inorganic carbon, exponential and stationary growth phase) and prepared cDNA libraries enriched for primary transcripts22 (treated libraries). In addition, we prepared two untreated libraries for RNA pooled from all conditions. The combined data of the two untreated libraries provided sequencing reads distributed over the complete length of a transcript, based on which TUs were defined. Depending on the context, we term a TU gTU when it covers one or more annotated genes, aTU when it is antisense to another TU and nTU when it is free-standing (for details see Section 2). Each TU is associated with a TSS that is named accordingly, and the TSS's read count from the treated library defines the expression level of the TU. This and the complexity of TU definition are illustrated in Fig. 1. The flavoprotein (flv4-2) operon (TU156) comprises the genes, sll0217 (flv4), sll0218 and sll0219 (flv2), and several short asRNAs, of which As1_flv432 (TU158) is by far the most abundant one. As1_flv4 sets a threshold on the expression of the flv4-2 operon,32 thus preventing premature expression. Under standard conditions, the expression of this operon would be disadvantageous, because flavodiiron proteins encoded by this operon open up an alternative electron transfer route.33 The situation changes in high light or carbon limitation, when this photoprotective function is needed. Indeed, our data show strong induction of the flv4-2 gTSS under carbon limitation and high light (Fig. 1), consistent with previous observations that were obtained by other methods.32,34 Interestingly, we found an additional iTSS (within TU156) within the coding region of flv4.

The full list of all TUs is presented in Supplementary Data. A previous study21 reported 3,527 TSSs active at exponential growth conditions. When using the same threshold of two raw reads, our data for the exponential growth condition validated 3,282 (93%) of these. However, with the parallel analysis of nine further growth conditions and due to the higher sequencing depth, we found also many new TSSs. In summary, the 5,162 TSSs active at least in one of the tested conditions were employed to identify 4,091 TUs. Hence, one-fifth of the mapped TSSs are internal or alternative starts. The identified TUs provide information about the expression of 83% (3,101 of 3,725) of the annotated genes. Though our data provide a dramatically increased resolution, there are still 624 genes for which no transcript information was obtained. Numbers of g, a, i and nTUsNumbers of g, a, i and nTUs3.2. Differential expression and regulationFigure 2A shows the fractions of the TU types with a predicted TSS for each of the analysed conditions. We observed maximum numbers of active TUs in N-depleted and cold stress cultures, minimum numbers in stationary phase cultures and cultures kept for 12 h in darkness. We modelled the expression level of a TU by the read count from the treated libraries at the corresponding TSS. For the TU prediction, we set rather strict criteria, e.g. requiring a minimum number of 500 normalized reads from the treated library of at least one condition. While this is necessary for the specificity of the prediction, lower TSS read counts are still reasonable when assessing the expression level of a TU. The distribution of read counts at TSSs among all conditions is shown in Fig. 2B. The read counts can be modelled by a mixture of two gamma distributions, where the one for lower read counts (<U+03B3>2 in Fig. 2B) resembles our background model for P-value calculation. Requiring a P-value of =0.05 results in a read count cut-off of 80. Following this criterion, we saw only 1,170 TUs (22%) present under all 10 conditions. However, most of the TUs were found in 9 of the 10 tested conditions (Fig. 2C). Figure 2.Open in new tabDownload slideTU and TSS statistics.

Thus, TUs with a high UEF respond strongly to a particular stimulus. In Table 2, we show for each condition the TU associated with the highest number of reads and an UEF of >2.0. Interestingly, for many conditions we found sRNAs among the top-responding TUs.

This approach identified four TSSs strongly responding to phosphate stress that gives rise to four TUs that explain the expression of the 12 genes reported previously.36 Thus, our data fully explain the regulation of the known P stress regulon in Synechocystis 6803 and provide the exact TSSs, none of which had been known before (Table 3 and Supplementary Data). Moreover, our data identified seven additional TUs that were induced upon P stress, which cover additional 21 genes. Among these genes is sll0290, encoding a polyphosphate kinase, but surprisingly also two TUs seemingly unrelated to phosphate metabolism, covering the genes for phenoxybenzoate dioxygenase, a ferredoxin, the methyl-accepting chemotaxis-like protein PilJ and the regulator Hik39 as well as with chlLN the genes for two subunits of the protochlorophyllide reductase. Moreover, two of these TUs, PsiR1 (phosphate-stress-induced RNA 1, part of TU3627, Fig. 3) and TU79, are likely sRNAs or encode very short peptides. It should be noted, however, that our identification of TUs and the associated regulation is not always directly comparable with the results of microarray analyses that target the steady-state accumulation of an mRNA, while our measure of expression focuses on nascent transcripts. Furthermore, differences in sample preparation, signal readout and signal processing likely result in deviations between the methods. Table 3.TUs associated with the phosphate stress regulonTU ID

Putative -10 elements are underlined and an arrow highlights the first transcribed nucleotide. For the complete dataset on the P stress regulon, see also Table 3.In previous work, the repetitive 8-bp Pho box consensus sequence PyTTAAPyPy(T/A) was described in the upstream regions of the phoA, sphX and pstS2 genes of Synechocystis 6803. This sequence was shown to be recognized by SphR, the PhoB homologue.36 Some of these elements are located more than 300 nt upstream of the respective genes; however, the exact locations of these elements within the respective promoter sequences were not investigated. Here, we found these elements to form tetrameric repeats within 61–182 nt upstream of the TSSs and identified very similar elements at the corresponding positions within the promoter of the newly identified P-stress-regulated PsiR1 transcript (Fig. 3C), providing further support to the idea that PsiR1 is a previously unknown member of the Pho regulon in Synechocystis 6803. Whereas our Northern experiment clearly indicated PsiR1 to accumulate in the form of a distinct ~500 nt sRNA (Fig. 3B), we cannot exclude the possibility of its translation into one or two small peptides, as there are two short reading frames, 46 and 55 codons in length, present within PsiR1.As in our approach targeting the phosphate stress regulon, we ranked the iron-stress-specific TUs according to their maximum UEF values (Table 4). Known iron-stress-induced genes, such as that for the iron-stress-induced protein A (IsiA), were among the top induced TUs. Remarkably, again a putative sRNA, which we termed IsaR1 (iron stress-activated RNA 1), was among the top induced TSSs. In a previous microarray-based study, IsaR1 was identified as the sRNA whose expression responded most strongly on iron stress20 (called NC-181 there), but its TSS had not been mapped. The accumulation of IsaR1 under iron depletion was verified by Northern hybridization (Fig. 4). Table 4.TUs associated with the iron stress regulon TU ID

Furthermore, the overall strongest TSS gives rise to the sRNA Ncr0700. This sRNA is highly expressed in darkness (>11 million normalized read counts), but also expressed at relatively high levels after heat shock or during stationary phase (4 and 4.8 million reads, respectively). We observed similar patterns also for mRNAs, for example, for the small protein Norf121 (Fig. 5), but in the following, we will focus on sRNAs, as these are the least-explored component of the regulatory apparatus.

As expected, PsrR1 was most highly expressed under high light and strongly decreased at darkness. Additionally, we found that it is relatively highly expressed under other conditions such as Fe or N depletion. Especially, a 10 times higher read number for cold compared with heat stress suggests a temperature-dependent regulation, which was confirmed by Northern hybridization (Fig. 5).In addition to the light intensity, the availability of macronutrients, including nitrogen and inorganic carbon, is very important for photosynthetic growth. Commonly, in N-depleted cells especially genes encoding subunits of transport systems for nitrate [e.g. nrtABCD (sll1450-53)], urea [e.g. urtABC (slr0447, slr1200, slr1201)] and ammonium [e.g. amt1 (sll0108), amt2 (sll1017) and amt3 (sll0537)] become up-regulated.38–40 We observed a higher read number for the corresponding TSSs under N depletion, except for the nrt operon and amt1. However, as described above, TSS activity is not always directly comparable with steady-state levels measured by microarrays, which may explain the only partial agreement with existing microarray data. Beside uptake systems, also genes for enzymes involved in metabolizing nitrogen are regulated, e.g. glutamine synthetase (GS) type III (glnN, slr0288), which is responsible for the condensation of ammonium and glutamate, as well as isocitrate dehydrogenase (icd, slr1289), which provides 2-oxoglutarate for the GOGAT reaction. For both, an increased read number was detected in N-depleted cells which is consistent with previous reports.40 Also consistent with previous findings,40 the genes gifA (ssl1911) and gifB (sll1515), both of which encode inhibitory proteins for GS activity, are down-regulated in our data. Intriguingly, also under N-depletion, an sRNA (NsiR4 for nitrogen-stress-induced RNA 4, previously named SyR1221), which is encoded in between the genes sll1697 and sll1698, was found among the transcripts with the highest read numbers. Actually, NsiR4 was expressed in all conditions, but with a maximum under N depletion (UEF = 3.52, Table 2 and Fig. 5), which suggests a regulatory role in the metabolism of nitrogen.A similar observation was made for carbon as an environmental factor. An sRNA (previously named SyR1421) located upstream of the gene slr1214, encoding a UV-dependent response regulator,41 was among the 20 most strongly expressed TUs for all conditions. Interestingly, its expression was completely shut down when cells were exposed to CO2 concentrations higher than the ambient concentration of 0.03% (Fig. 6). Thus, these data indicate a specific carbon-dependent regulation, and thus, we named this sRNA CsiR1 (carbon-stress-induced RNA 1).

Operons, 5' and 3' untranslated regionsWe found 683 TUs that cover more than one gene and the longest TU comprised 22 genes (TU355; Supplementary Data). Its composition is rather diverse and contains mainly genes without an ortholog in any other cyanobacteria. It represents a major part of the rfb-glycosyltransferase gene cluster that has features of a genomic island and encodes several enzymes for the modification of cell surface structures.42 The finding that these genes are transcribed as a very long multicistronic operon is consistent with the idea that they form a gene cluster that was jointly transferred. The second-longest TU (TU837, 18 genes) and the adjacent third-longest TU, TU833 (9 genes; Supplementary Data), represent the S10/spc ribosomal protein operon.The untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs are functionally relevant elements, i.e. they can harbour regulatory features such as riboswitches or are targeted by regulatory sRNAs. Our TU-based approach intrinsically defines 5' and 3' UTRs and their length distribution is shown in Fig. 7. The median 5' UTR length is 52 nt, which is somewhat longer than the preferred 5' UTR length of 20–40 nt found in proteobacteria.43 The median 3' UTR length is 118 nt.

Our data provide evidence for 51 leaderless mRNAs in Synechocystis 6803, including the previously reported apcE (slr0335), slr1079 and slr0846 mRNAs.21 Interestingly, their expression was distributed over all conditions (Supplementary Data). In addition, based on iTSS locations shortly behind the annotated start codon and the conservation of reading frames, our data allowed the reannotation of the 5' ends of 46 reading frames in Synechocystis 6803 (Supplementary Data).4. Discussion4.1. The TU approachTraditional dRNA-seq-based studies so far were more focused on the identification of TSSs and often used fixed-length thresholds for assigning them to mRNA, sRNA or cis-asRNA transcripts. For example, in our previous analysis,21 a TSS was classified as gTSS if it was located 100 nt upstream of an annotated gene; in the work on Campylobacter jejuni, 300 nt were used; in the work on Anabaena sp. PCC 7120, this was 200 nt, unless specified otherwise due to additional information.23,45 These rather arbitrary assumptions need to be made for automatic annotation but are erroneous. For example, it is well known that the actual UTR lengths can differ greatly, e.g. the key transcription factor HetR in Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 is transcribed from four different gTSS, with the two most distal ones giving rise to 5' UTRs of 696 and 728 nt.46–49 Here, we defined TUs, which directly provide information on TSSs, operons and UTRs, and lower the potential for false-positive TSS predictions, since a TSS needs to be followed by a region covered by reads from the untreated library.4.2. Regulons inferred from dRNA-seq analysisOur approach allows the definition of regulons and relevant promoter sequences at single-nucleotide resolution, demonstrated exemplarily for the Pho regulon. Based on the definition of the UEF, a statistical reliable quantitative data evaluation became possible. This approach allowed us to identify the suite of TSSs specifically linked to activation under phosphate stress, which fully explain the regulation of the known P-stress regulon in Synechocystis 680336 (Fig. 3 and Table 3). Moreover, we suggest seven additional TUs to belong to the P-stress regulon, two of which appear to encompass sRNAs.4.3. Many growth conditions exhibit a strongly responding sRNAFor the majority of the conditions in our study, we identified an sRNA among the top expressed or induced transcripts. A change in the light conditions triggered the induction of PsrR1, which is probably a key player in the regulation of the photosynthetic apparatus (Georg et al. unpublished data). Interestingly, two other transcripts, the sRNA Ncr0700 and the short mRNA Norf1, behaved in completely the opposite way for the conditions tested, with a peak of expression in the dark and the minimum in high light (Fig. 5), suggesting a specific role under that condition.In addition to the light intensity, the availability of macronutrients is very important for photosynthetic growth. Indeed, we identified several sRNAs with an according pattern of expression under iron stress (IsaR1), or which were induced specifically by the depletion of carbon (CsiR1), nitrogen (NsiR4) or phosphate (PsiR1). The phosphate-stress-induced sRNA PsiR1 is the second highest-induced transcript according to our data. Interestingly, PsiR1 seems to be part of the 5' UTR of sll1552, from which it may originate by post-transcriptional cleavage. Alternatively, incomplete termination of PsiR1 transcription may allow read-through into sll1552. Thus, in both scenarios its TSS also drives the transcription of sll1552, such that they constitute an operon of an sRNA and a protein-coding gene. We found a similar organization for nsiR4, which forms an operon together with the protein-coding gene sll1698. Here, again, we validated NsiR4 as an individual transcript, which is highly induced upon N depletion.Although the individual functions of the sRNAs remain to be elucidated at the molecular level, our findings are in line with the important role of sRNAs in many regulatory processes. Their identification in Synechocystis 6803, a cyanobacterial model organism with a well-studied physiology and genetics, is advantageous for their future detailed characterization.5.

IntroductionNeurogenesis takes place robustly during the development of fetal nervous system and continues postnatally and in adults.1,2 It relies on multipotent neural stem cells (NSCs), which can generate different cell types of nervous system. Based on their localization and developmental stages, NSCs exhibit distinct spatial and temporary properties in terms of the neural specification and differentiation potentials.3 NSCs can also be derived from pluripotent stem cell (PSC) in vitro neural differentiation.4 Different protocols have been developed to derive and propagate NSCs from PSCs.5,6 Similar to their in vivo counterparts, PSC-derived NSCs showed distinct neural differentiation competence according to the protocols utilized. Currently, PSC in vitro neural differentiation is widely employed to study the regulation of neurogenesis and to generate NSCs or neurons in cell replacement therapy of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders.7,8 However, most of the PSC-derived NSCs were lack of bona fide NSC properties, i.e. they displayed restricted neural differentiation fate and failed to generate all cell types of neural lineage, or they lost the ability to respond to regionalization cue.3 These shortcomings hampered their potential applications in basic research as well as in cell replacement therapy. Recently, Elkabetz et al.9 identified an early stage of NSC population during the process of human embryonic stem cell (ESC) neural differentiation. These earlier NSCs exhibited the unique rosette morphology and were named as rosette NSC (R-NSC). Compared with other NSCs ever described, R-NSC possesses true NSC properties (i.e. broad neural differentiation potential and regionalization ability) and is considered as stem cells of neural lineage.9 Albeit with high potential in the study of neurogenesis as well as cell replacement therapy, R-NSC is difficult to be maintained and propagated in culture. Moreover, whether R-NSC exhibits a high risk of tumourigenicity following transplantation remains elusive. In these regards, an intensive study of R-NSC is required in order to thoroughly understand the molecular mechanisms regulating the self-renewal and multipotency of the R-NSCs. However, few works were carried out and little information was obtained regarding the molecular properties of R-NSC in human and even in mice. To our knowledge, only one study examined the human R-NSC-specific genes by microarray analysis.9Rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) has >90% (92.5–95%) DNA homologue to human and has long been considered as a reliable non-human primate model to study various human diseases and to assess the preclinical safety of medical treatments.10,11 In particular, the cell replacement therapy based on the invention of induced PSC (iPSC) technology called for safety assessment in primates before its application in clinics.12,13 Thus, rhesus monkey plays intermediate translational roles as therapeutic strategies evolve from rodent systems to human clinical applications. Rhesus monkey ESCs (rESCs) and iPSCs have successfully been derived in several laboratories around the world, and they shared a number of properties with human ESCs.14–16 Furthermore, rhesus monkey animal models for neural degenerative diseases including Huntington's disease,17 Parkinson's disease,18 and spinal cord injury19 were demonstrated. Investigating the rESC-derived R-NSCs and transplanting them into the monkey disease models would be a perfect strategy to evaluate the cell replacement therapy in human neural degenerative diseases.To understand the molecular characters and especially the molecular interaction networks implicated in the maintenance of unique functional properties of R-NSC in rhesus monkey, we performed in vitro neural differentiation of rESCs according to the protocol developed by Elkabetz et al.9 Using the mRNA and microRNA (miRNA) deep sequencing-based systemic analysis, we investigated the whole-genome mRNA and miRNA profilings of the ESCs, R-NSCs at early and late passages (R-NSCP1 and R-NSCP6, respectively), and neural progenitor cells (NPCs) which completely lost the characteristics of R-NSCs. Our results described the dynamics of transcriptomes and miRNAomes during ESC neural differentiation. Comparisons among the four differentiation stages uncovered a hand of R-NSCP1-specific or prevalent mRNAs, miRNAs, and signalling pathways. The regulatory interactions of these molecules were also proposed.2. Materials and methods2.1. rESC culture and induction of neural differentiationrESCs (line IVF3.2) were cultured on feeder cells of mitotically inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblasts as described previously.20 Embryoid body (EB) differentiation was employed to induce neural differentiation. Briefly, rESC colonies were transferred onto tissue culture dishes coated with 1% agar and differentiated in ESC culture medium depleted of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) to induce EB differentiation. EBs were then transferred onto extracellular matrix-coated (10 µg/cm2, Sigma-Aldrich) tissue culture dishes to spread and propagate in DMEM/F12 medium (Gibco) supplied with ITS (Sigma-Aldrich), 2.5 µg/ml of fibronectin (Millipore), 60 µM putrescine (Sigma-Aldrich), and 20 ng/ml of bFGF. Neural tube-like structures could be observed in EB outgrowth, and rosette-like clusters were then manually separated and expanded according to the protocol described by Elkabetz et al.9 with minor modifications. In brief, rosette clusters were replaced on culture dishes pre-coated with 15 µg/ml of polyornithine plus 1 µg/ml of laminin (Po/Lam) (Sigma-Aldrich) in N2 medium supplemented with SHH (200 ng/ml; R&D), FGF8 (100 ng/ml; Sigma-Aldrich), ascorbic acid (0.2 mM; Sigma-Aldrich), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF, 20 ng/ml; R&D). The first passage of rosette culture was defined as R-NSCP1. To propagate the R-NSCs, only rosette structures were picked and passed at the density of 100–400 × 103 cells/cm2 when the growth reached 80% confluence. R-NSCs after the first passage were propagated in Po/Lam culture dishes in N2 medium with 0.2 mM ascorbic acid, 20 ng/ml of BDNF, 500 ng/ml of SHH, 500 ng/ml of Dll4 (R&D), and 500 ng/ml of Jagged-1 (R&D). Under this culture condition, rosette structure can be maintained for up to five generations. At the sixth generation, the rosette structure was no longer visible and the cells were defined as R-NSCP6. NPCs were derived from R-NSCs with extended culture on Po/Lam culture dishes in N2 medium with 0.2 mM ascorbic acid, 20 ng/ml of BDNF, 20 ng/ml of FGF2, and 20 ng/ml of EGF for >100 days.21 The differentiation efficiency from R-NSCs to NPCs under this condition was close to 100% based on cell morphology as well as calculating the percentages of cells labelled with stage-specific marker S100b.2.2. Patterning and neural differentiation of R-NSCs and NPCsR-NSCs were examined for neural regional patterning potentials.9 The following factors were used to coax the regional patterning of R-NSCs: 200 ng/ml of SHH plus 1 µM retinoic acid (RA) for posterior patterning, 200 ng/ml of SHH plus 100 ng/ml of FGF8 for anterior patterning, 40 ng/ml of Wnt3a (R&D) for dorsal patterning, and 200 ng/ml of SHH for ventral patterning.NPCs were examined for their neural differentiation abilities. For neuronal differentiation, NPCs were replated onto Po/Lam-coated plates at a density of 2.5 × 104 cells/cm2 in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with N2, B27 (Gibco), BDNF (20 ng/ml), glial derived neurotrophic factor (20 ng/ml), 1 mM dibutyryl cyclic AMP (Sigma-Aldrich), and ascorbic acid (200 nM). For astrocyte and oligodendrocyte differentiation, 1% fetal calf serum (Gibco) was added in the above media.22,232.3. Immunofluorescent staining and quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reactionFor immunofluorescent staining, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature followed by permeabilization in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. After blocking with 3% bovine serum albumin, cells were incubated with primary antibodies (Supplementary Data) overnight at 4°C. Cells were then rinsed in PBS (3× 5 min) followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated or Texas red-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h. Negative controls were carried out without the addition of the primary antibody.Cell samples used for cDNA preparation and quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (qRT–PCR) validation were different from those used for RNA-Seq. Total RNA was extracted using Trizol LS Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacture's instruction. Potential contamination from genomic DNA was eliminated by DNase digestion. RNA was reverse-transcribed into single-strand cDNA. Aliquots of cDNA were used as templates for qRT–PCR. The PCR consisted of 1 µl of 1 : 3-diluted cDNA, 10 µl of SYBR green-Taq mixed solution (Sigma), and 20 pmol each of 5' and 3' primers (Supplementary Data) in a total volume of 20 µl and was performed in an Opticon thermal cycler (Bio-Rad) for 35 cycles with denaturation at 95°C for 15 s, annealing at 55–58°C for 30 s, and extension at 72°C for 15 s. RNA without reverse transcriptase treatment was used as negative control.2.4. Sample collection and preparation of the libraries for mRNA and miRNA deep sequencingIn R-NSCP1 culture, a fraction of cells lost the rosette morphology indicative of differentiation. In order to avoid the contamination of R-NSCP1 sample by other cells, only rosette structures were manually collected (R-NSCP1) for downstream RNA extraction. Similarly, pure rosette structures without contamination of differentiated cells were used for R-NSC passage. At passage 6, the rosette structure was no longer formed and all cells in the culture dish were collected (R-NSCP6) for RNA extraction. To get the enough amount of cells for RNA-Seq, ESC neural differentiation was repeated many times and the R-NSCs as well as NPCs from each repeat were pooled for RNA extraction. Therefore, the sample of each stage is the pool of many repeats. mRNA sequencing using HiSeq 2000 was performed at Macrogen Inc. According to the manufacturer's instructions (Illumina), mRNA was purified using poly-T oligo-attached magnetic beads. Following purification, the mRNA was fragmented into small pieces. The cleaved RNA fragments were converted to the first-strand cDNA followed by generation of double-strand cDNAs. These cDNA fragments went through end repair course by adding a single ‘A’ base as well as the adapter ligation. The cDNA libraries prepared from samples of ESCs, R-NSCP1, R-NSCP6, and NPCs were used for paired-end mRNA sequencing by Illumina HiSeq 2000.For miRNA sequencing, total RNA was ligated to a pair of adaptors at the 5' and 3' ends according to the manufacturer's instructions (Illumina). RNA molecules were converted to cDNA and amplified by RT-PCR using adaptor primers. After amplification, library of small RNAs with size of ~140 bp was purified and used for cluster generation and single-end small RNA sequencing by Illumina HiSeq 2000.2.5. Read mapping and abundance estimate for genes and miRNAsRNA-seq reads were mapped to the M. mulatta genome (MMUL_1.0) using TopHat24 (v. 2.0.6) with default settings. Cufflinks25 (v. 2.0.2) were used to estimate fragments per kilobase of exon per million fragments mapped (FPKM) values for University of California Santa Cruz Genome Database known genes. According to the previous report that a gene with three FPKMs corresponds to about one transcript in one cell,26 we consider the genes with an FPKM value of =3 as expressed.Using the Bowtie software27 (v. 2.0.2), miRNA sequence reads were aligned to the rhesus annotated miRNAs in the miRBASE database (Release 19, http://www.mirbase.org/) and the frequency of reads that mapped uniquely to each miRNA was calculated. The adaptor sequences were trimmed from individual reads using a customized Perl script. Reads in which the adaptor sequences were either mutated or absent were discarded. Unmatched sequences were collapsed to obtain a set of unique reads. The reads with sequence length between 15 and 30 were analysed by miRDeep algorithm.28 Reads that aligned to more than five positions in the human genome were excluded from the data set, as they may reside in repetitive locus. The potential precursors were excised to generate secondary stem–loop structure using the Vienna RNAfold package (v. 1.8; http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at).29 Finally, miRDeep assigned a score to each read based on: (i) seed sequence homology to known human miRNA, (ii) the presence of a star sequence, (iii) minimum free energy (RNAfold), (iv) energetic stability (Randfold), and (v) frequency of reads that correspond to Dicer processing. A final score was assigned, and the minimum total score by default was one.2.6. Alternative splicing analysisWe conducted the alternative splicing (AS) analysis using the MATS software (version 3.0.7.beta).30 Six comparisons were made between any two of the four stages to test if there were 5% or more change of the exon inclusion level (<U+03A8>) for exon skipping events, and the events with false discovery rate (FDR) of <0.1 were determined as significant changes between the two stages. The stage-specific AS events were then determined as that with the highest of lowest <U+03A8> in a specific stage, and the <U+03A8> changes are significant between this stage and any other stages base on MATS calculation. Considering that R-NSCP1 and R-NSCP6 are similar, the AS events did not have to be significant between these two stages when defining AS events as R-NSCP1 or R-NSCP6 specific.2.7. miRNA-target predictionIn order to retrieve information of miRNA targets in rhesus monkeys, we integrated data sets of different sources. First, we retrieved miRNA-target information from the miRNAMap database (version 2.0).31 In prediction, the minimum free energy threshold of the miRNA and target duplex was set to -12 kcal/mol and the miRanda score was specified as 120. The predictive parameters of TargetScan and RNAhybrid were set as default values. Secondly, we applied miRDB (http://mirdb.org/miRDB/), which was an online database for miRNA-target prediction and functional annotations based on support vector machines and high-throughput training data sets.32 The target score was set to 50 in prediction.2.8. Statistical analysisFisher's exact test with Benjamini–Hochberg FDR controls33 was performed to identify enriched Gene Ontology (GO) terms and annotated gene sets in the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB).34 We also used gene expression profiles of many human/mouse tissues from the Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation (GNF, version 3; http://biogps.org/)35,36 to further characterize the transcriptome alterations in ESC neural differentiation.3. Results3.1. Characterization of rESC-derived NSCsrESCs derived in Dr Wei-zhi Ji's lab were used in this study.20 These stem cells have normal karyotype, express ESC markers, and can form three germ layer cells in teratoma formation assay.20 According to the neural induction protocol developed by Elkabetz et al.,9 ESCs at passages 15–30 were sequentially differentiated into early (neural rosette) and late (glial-like) stages of NSCs. The identities of R-NSC and glial-like NSC/NPC were characterized based on the standards described in Elkabetz et al.'s study.9 Briefly, R-NSCs at passage 1 (R-NSCP1) represented the early stage of NSC and displayed typical morphology, i.e. the columnar epithelial cells radically organized to form rosette structure. They expressed not only the common NSC markers Sox2 and Nestin (Fig. 1A), but also the neural rosette specific markers Dach1 and PLZF (official symbol ZBTB16) (Fig. 1B and C). These early NSCs adopted polarized neuroepithelial structure of anterior central nervous system (CNS) fate and exhibited forebrain precursor cell marker Forse1 (Fig. 1D). They also displayed asymmetric apical localization of tight junction protein ZO-1 and neuroepithelial marker N-cadherin (N-cad) (Fig. 1B and D). Most importantly, these early R-NSCs possessed broad regional specification competence. For instance, they could be coaxed to differentiate into HB9+ spinal motor neurons by SHH/RA posterior patterning cues (Fig. 1E), and into En1+ midbrain precursors in response to SHH/FGF8 anterior patterning molecules (Fig. 1F). They also underwent ventral–dorsal specification upon exposure to ventral and dorsal patterning signals such as SHH or Wnt3A, as indicated by the inducible expression of ventral forebrain marker Nkx2.2 (Fig. 1G) and the dorsal marker Msx1 (Fig. 1H).

In our experimental setting, R-NSCs at the sixth passage (R-NSCP6) lost most of the unique properties described above including typical rosette morphology, the polarized distribution of ZO-1 and N-cad, and the responsiveness to patterning cues. However, they retained the partial staining for R-NSCP1 markers PLZF (Fig. 1J) and Dach1 (Fig. 1K), and expressed the common NSC markers Sox2 and Nestin (Fig. 1I). Thus, R-NSCP6 represented a transitional stage between R-NSCP1 and the glial-like NSC/NPC, which completely lost the expression of R-NSC-specific marker PLZF (Fig. 1L) and could be maintained in the presence of FGF2/EGF for long time. These FGF2/EGF-dependent NPCs expressed common NSC markers Nestin and Sox2 (Fig. 1M) as well as stage-specific marker S100b (Fig. 1N). Their NSC identity was further confirmed by the ability to differentiate into neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes as indicated by the expression of specific marker genes ß3-tubulin (Fig. 1O), GFAP (Fig. 1P), and O4 (Fig. 1Q), respectively. Taken together, we established three NSC types R-NSCP1, R-NSCP6, and NPC, which represented early-to-late neural developmental stages and displayed decreased capacities in neural patterning and specification.3.2. Gene expression signatures of the three NSC populationsTo investigate the regulation of monkey ESC neural differentiation and to identify the unique molecular properties of R-NSCP1, we performed parallel genome-wide analysis of mRNA and miRNA expression profiling in four samples (Supplementary Data). Respective 72, 78, 78, and 100 million sequence reads (36, 39, 39, and 50 million mate pairs) were obtained in ESCs, R-NSCP1, R-NSCP6, and NPC. Using stringent criteria FPKM =3 to define an ‘expressed’ gene, we detected the expression of 12,457 of 20,106 genes (~61.96%) surveyed in at least one stage and constructed the high-resolution transcriptomes of the four samples (Supplementary Data). Based on these expression data, we re-examined the differentiation stage of these NSC types by looking closely at the expression patterns of the following marker genes: LOC708561 (similar to SOX1), PAX6, LOC694175 (similar to OTX2), LOC716287 (FOXG1-like), GBX2, EMX2, FABP7, SLC1A3, GFAP, S100B, AQP4, OLIG2, and CD44. SOX1 is one of the known earliest neural precursor markers and plays essential roles in neural determination. Its expression can be detected as early as in primitive neuroepithelial progenitors (NEPs), but disappears in radial glias (RG).37,38 PAX6 is a broad NSC marker with expression initiated in primitive NEP and sustained until the late NSCs.38 OTX2, FOXG1, EMX2, and GBX2 are markers of anterior identity and play roles in early establishment of anterior/posterior patterning of neural plate (e.g. GBX2) or in the regional patterning of the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain.3,39–41 Because the NSCs of early stage exhibit anterior identity, the co-expression of anterior markers with early neural markers is commonly used to mark the early NSCs with broad neural differentiation competence. FABP7, SLC1A3, GFAP, S100B, AQP4, OLIG2, and CD44 are highly transcribed in the late stage of NSC/NPC.3 As shown in Fig. 2A, among the six early NSC markers, PAX6, OTX2, FOXG1, and EMX2 were prevalently expressed in both R-NSCP1 and R-NSCP6 cells, whereas SOX1 and GBX2 were specifically expressed in R-NSCP1. Late-stage NSC markers FABP7 and SLC1A3 displayed prevalent expression in NPC other than in R-NSCP1 and R-NSCP6. Genes involved in the neuronal or astrocytic differentiation process (GFAP, S100B, AQP4, OLIG2, and CD44) were restrictively expressed in NPC. Moreover, hierarchical clustering analysis of these four samples revealed that R-NSCP6 was clustered with NPC instead of R-NSCP1 (Supplementary Data). Taken together, these data further supported that the regional specification and neural differentiation potentials decreased from R-NSCP1 to NPC.

To this end, the expression fold change between the highest FPKM value and the secondary highest FPKM value was calculated for each gene. Genes with the fold changes of =2 were considered as stage specifically over-expressed genes. As a result, we identified 1,147, 258, 949, and 821 genes showing prevalent expression in ESC, R-NSCP1, R-NSCP6, and NPC, respectively (Supplementary Data). Among the 1,147 genes over-represented in ESCs, 391 were exclusively detected in ESCs (an FPKM value of <3 in other stages). The well-known conserved markers of undifferentiated ESCs including POU5f1, NANOG, DNMT3B, L1TD1, ZFP42, SALL4, LEFTY1, and PRDM14 were included in the list. LOC719865 (similar to RNA-binding protein Lin-28A) was also highly expressed in ESCs. Supplementary Data summarizes the most enriched genes (fold change =50) with a high expression level (FPKM =20) in rESCs. It is interesting to note that PKM2, which encodes pyruvate kinase isoform M2 important for aerobic glycolysis, was exclusively and abundantly expressed in ESCs, suggesting that the PSCs might have distinct metabolic property from proliferating somatic stem cells.Among the 258 R-NSCP1-prevalent genes (Supplementary Data), 124 were restrictively expressed in R-NSCP1 (an FPKM value of <3 in other stages). Of which, the uncharacterized genes LOC100428562 (cytochrome c oxidase subunit 2-like), LOC100428486, LOC100428944, and LOC100430630 showed a high expression level (FPKM =48) in the R-NSCP1 stage. Whether they play critical roles in R-NSCP1 function deserved exploration. Table 1 summarizes the typical R-NSCP1-enriched genes with relative high expression abundance (FPKM =10 and fold change =4). The expression pattern of PAX3, Col3A1, and WNT1 was randomly selected for validation by qRT–PCR (Supplementary Data-prevalent genes are well-known gene signatures in neural regionalization and patterning during neurogenesis (e.g. PAX3, PAX8, OLIG3, LGI1, GLI3, EN2, DCX, DMRTA1, and SLIT2).42–46 The GNF database shows that four of the nine gene signatures (including LGI1, GLI3, EN2, and DCX) are predominantly expressed in neural tissues (the expression levels in neural tissues, such as whole brain, retina, and hypothalamus, are significantly higher than the other tissues; Wilcoxon signed-rank test, P < 0.01). More interestingly, the DCX gene (doublecortin) is specifically expressed in the fetal brain. In addition, we annotated all the R-NSCP1-prevalent genes using human gene signatures in MSigDB34 (v4.0) and found that the genes up-regulated in neurons (Term ID: CAHOY_NEURONAL) were enriched (FDR <1 × 10-10). The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis on these 258 R-NSCP1-prevalent genes revealed that these genes were highly enriched in the basal cell carcinoma, pathways in cancer, Hedgehog signalling pathway, and Wnt signalling pathway (Fisher's exact test, FDR <0.01; Fig. 2B). Six components of the Hedgehog signalling pathway including GLI3, LRP2, LOC694650, WNT1, WNT4, and WNT2B were significantly over-represented in R-NSCP1 (Fig. 2C) (Fisher's exact test, FDR <0.01). Similarly, components of the Wnt signalling pathway, including AXIN2, DAAM2, FZD10, NKD1, and the three WNT genes mentioned above, were over-represented in R-NSCP1 (Fig. 2C). The function of Hedgehog signalling in facilitating R-NSC expansion in vitro has been validated in the previous study.9 AXIN2 is a universal read-out of Wnt signalling activation, and its prevalent expression in R-NSCP1 (Supplementary DataB) indicated that Wnt signalling pathway was highly activated in R-NSCP1 cells and might play important roles in regulating the biology of early stage R-NSC. In addition, we explored the expression patterns of gene signatures in Hedgehog and Wnt signalling pathways in human tissues using the GNF database.35,36 It shows that 5 of the 10 gene signatures are predominantly expressed in neural tissues, including GLI3, WNT1, WNT2B, DAAM2, and FZD10 (Supplementary Data). Top list of r-NSCP1-prevalent genes during rESC neural differentiationTop list of r-NSCP1-prevalent genes during rESC neural differentiationCompared with R-NSCP1 cells, R-NSCP6 and NPC cells displayed decreased plasticity in neural patterning and specification. In consistence with this tendency, many important transcription factors involved in CNS regionalization and specification were identified as R-NSCP6 prevalent (Table 2). These genes include TBR1, NEUROD6, NEUROD2, NEUROD1, NEUROG1, CTXN1, NR2F1, NR2F2, DMRT3, RSPO2, EMX1, BHLHE22, VSTM2L, LEAP2, RAB3a, Hes6, LY6H, MAPK11, GLI1, HMP19, FBXW9, FBXW5, DLK1, and LHX2. Apart from these known factors, many uncharacterized genes were uncovered to be highly enriched in R-NSCP6 (Supplementary Data). Investigating the functions of these novel genes would provide new insights into the regulation of CNS specification in primates.

AS in rESC neural differentiationAS is an important layer of gene expression regulation and plays necessary roles in various aspects of developmental processes. To find out whether splicing switch of genes participates in the regulation of unique R-NSC properties, we used MATS30 to analyse AS changes during rESC neural differentiation. We focused on the exon skipping AS and identified 161 stage-specific events in all four stages (Supplementary Data). Among them, 28 events were R-NSC-specific. For examples, an alternative exon in CTNND1 is specifically highly included in R-NSCP1 (Fig. 3A), an alternative exon in CDCA7 shows a high inclusion level only in R-NSCs at P1 and P6 (Fig. 3B), an alternative exon in Abl-interactor 2 (ABI2) shows nearly exclusive inclusion in R-NSCs (Fig. 3C), and an alternative exon in ARFIP1 shows R-NSC-specific low inclusion (Fig. 3D). AS could result in different protein products; all the four alternative exons shown in Fig. 3 are in coding regions and inclusion of these exons results in inclusion of a certain number of amino acids encoded by the alternative exons in the protein products. For instance, the inclusion of the 183-bp alternative exon in ABI2, an SH3-domain protein involved in neuronal development, lead to protein product with additional 61 amino acids. On the other hand, AS could have other effects such as premature termination due to read frame shift. One hundred and fifty-one of the 161 stage-specific alternative exons are in protein-coding regions, even though most of them (100 of 151) cause in frame change of protein, there are 31 splice variants cause reading frame shift and 10 splice variants result in different usage of start codons (Supplementary Data). The R-NSC stage-specific inclusion of alternative exon suggests that the exon inclusion may be important to regulate R-NSC-specific functional properties.

Total 32.5, 39, 33, and 36 million sequence reads were obtained from the ESC, R-NSCP1, R-NSCP6, and NPC, respectively. After mapping to the rhesus monkey miRBASE database, 451 of the 466 annotated rhesus miRNAs (~97%) were detected with absolute reads of =1 in our study.To evaluate our miRNA sequencing quality, we compared the miRNA expression profile of ESCs with that reported in Sun et al.'s study.20 By Solexa sequencing, Sun et al. discovered total 352 annotated miRNAs in three lines of rESCs (including IVF3.2). Here, we detected 451 miRNAs solely in ESCs from line IVF3.2. Apart from the 329 overlapping miRNAs in these two independent works, we detected additional 122 annotated miRNAs in rESCs. The full list of miRNA species was shown in Supplementary Data.To find out the miRNAs prevalently expressed in each stage, the expression fold change between the highest reads count and the secondary highest reads count was calculated for each miRNA. miRNAs with the expression fold changes of =2 were considered as stage specifically over-represented. As a result, we identified 74, 59, 73, and 6 annotated miRNAs showing prevalent expression in ESC, R-NSCP1, R-NSCP6, and NPC, respectively (Supplementary Data). Among the 74 ESC-prevalent miRNAs, 11 miRNAs were restrictively expressed in monkey ESCs. The well-known ESC-enriched miRNAs including miR-302a, miR-302b, miR-302c, miR-302d, miR-367, miR-371-5p, miR-371-3p, miR-372, and miR-373 were in our list, indicating the liability of our data. We then focused on those miRNAs with high expression in R-NSCP1 or R-NSCP6. Table 3 presents the top miRNAs with the reads count of >1.0 × 104 and fold change of >3.0 in R-NSCP1 or R-NSCP6. Highly expressed miRNAs in r-NSCP1 and r-NSCP6 in rhesus monkeyHighly expressed miRNAs in r-NSCP1 and r-NSCP6 in rhesus monkeymiRNAs regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. We then examined the possible regulatory interactions among these stage-prevalent miRNAs, mRNAs, and signalling pathways. We first looked at the expression dynamics of well-known Lin28-let7 regulatory axis. RNA-binding protein Lin28 represses the maturation of pre-let7 precursor. Down-regulation of Lin28 mRNA is accompanied with up-regulation of let-7 miRNA family, and this regulatory axis dynamics is required for ESC differentiation as well as commitment to neural fate.47 Indeed, our expression data clearly showed the gradual decrease in Lin28B expression from ESCs to R-NSCP6. Inversely, the expression levels of most Let-7 family members (let-7a, 7c, 7e, 7f, 7g, and miR-98) increase gradually from ESC to R-NSCP6 (Fig. 4A).

(B) Wnt signalling pathway and potential miRNAs regulators.As mentioned above, Hh and Wnt signalling pathways were highly activated in R-NSCP1 but suppressed in R-NSCP6, we then asked whether there were R-NSCP1- or R-NSCP6-prevalent miRNAs implicated in regulating the pathways. The in vivo activities of Hh and Wnt are tightly controlled at multiple levels by variable positive as well as negative regulators. The important regulators of Hh signalling include Gas1, Ptch1, Sufu, and Gli3.48,49 Sufu and Ptch1 maintained stable mRNA expression during the six passages of R-NSCs, whereas Gas1 and Gli3 significantly down-regulated their expression when R-NSCs were passed into the sixth generation. We thus focused on Gas1 and Gli3 to search for their potential regulating miRNAs. To do this, we set the following criteria that the candidate miRNAs should pass through the combinatorial miRNA-target predictions (see Section 2) and display inverse expression pattern during the passage of R-NSCs. Similarly, we examined the expression dynamics of Wnt pathway components during the process of R-NSC passage. Several components of the Wnt pathway displayed drastic expression change between R-NSCP1 and R-NSCP6. These include ligands WNT1, WNT2B, WNT4, WNT8B, receptor FZD10, and three Wnt antagonists DKK3, SFRP4, and APC2. Of note, APC2 is a CNS-specific negative regulator of Wnt signalling.50 We searched for their potential regulating miRNAs. Figure 4B summarizes the predicted miRNAs having potential in modulating Wnt signalling intensity in R-NSCs. In the Hh signalling pathway, we detected mir-495 and mir-383 for Gas1 and mir-654-5P for Gli3.4. DiscussionR-NSCs represent an early stage of neural development. Their broad neural differentiation and regional specification potentials made them attractive in cell replacement therapy. However, little is known regarding the mechanisms regulating their full neural differentiation potential. Studying the underlying molecular regulators would shed lights on their potential utilization in regenerative medicine. To our knowledge, few works had been done to systematically investigate the molecular properties of R-NSCs. By microarray analysis, Elkabetz et al.9 compared the gene expression profile of R-NSCP1 with that of NPC and identify a list of R-NSCP1-specific genes. However, due to the discrete neural differentiation stage and wide gap between R-NSCP1 and NPC, the genes highly expressed in R-NSCP1 may not be bona fide R-NSCP1-specific. To overcome this shortcoming, we included R-NSC at passage 6 (R-NSCP6) along with R-NSCP1 and NPC in this study. When compared with R-NSCP1, R-NSCP6 lost the morphological rosette feature as well as partial neural regionalization abilities and therefore served as transition between R-NSCP1 and NPC. Inclusion of R-NSCP6 in our experimental design could trim off the molecules not bona fide unique to R-NSCP1 and therefore increased the likelihood for identification of molecular regulators of R-NSCP1 functions. Indeed, many of the R-NSCP1-specific genes identified in Elkabetz et al.'s study were not included in our list.9 For instance, PLAGL1, DACH1, PLZF, NR2F1, ZNF312, LIX1, LMO3, DMRT3, FAM70A, EVI1, MMRN1, RSPO3, EMX2OS, and LEF1 were top 14 R-NSCP1-specific genes in Elkabetz's work.9 However, only PLZF was verified to be truly R-NSCP1 prevalent in this study (Supplementary Data). Others were equally (e.g. PLAGL1, DACH1, LEF1) or even increasingly (e.g. NR2F1 and DMRT3) expressed in R-NSCP6 compared with R-NSCP1, although their abundance in R-NSCP1 was significant higher than that in NPC (Supplementary Data). Thus, our ESC neural differentiation system provided a better platform to study the molecular properties of R-NSCs. Furthermore, we utilized high-throughput deep sequencing instead of microarray-based approaches for systemic analysis. Deep sequencing has the advantage over microarray in discovery of novel genes or miRNAs without bias and therefore can largely broaden our knowledge on the regulation of monkey ESC neural differentiation.Rhesus monkey is considered as a better non-primate animal model than mouse in biomedical research. Comparison of our data with human PSC neural differentiation supported that the expression patterns in ESC neural differentiation are similar between human and rhesus monkeys. For example, Wu et al.51 applied high-throughput deep sequencing to analyse the transcriptome changes that occur during the differentiation of human ESCs into the neural lineage. Many common gene signatures enriched for Wnt and Hedgehog signalling pathways are shared between human and rhesus (WNT1, WNT4, NKD1, etc.) in these two studies. We also compared the most important gene signatures in mouse ESC neural differentiation52 with our R-NSC-prevalent genes and found that the many of the gene signatures (69 of 539 rhesus mouse ortholog pairs from rhesus R-NSCP-prevalent genes; Supplementary Data) are conserved in the neural differentiation process, such as COL4A6, SPOCK1, TNFRSF19, FBXW5, HES6, LHX2, NR2F1, NR2F2, and RAB3A (Tables 1 and 2). However, there exist species-specific genes. For example, Wnt3a and Wnt5b might be mouse-specific, while Wnt2b is active in rhesus monkey. These comparisons between species to derive the conserved and divergent genes/pathways will be of critical importance in building suitable animal models for human diseases.In summary, by whole-genome comparison of mRNA and miRNA expression profiles, we identified a set of mRNAs, miRNAs, and signalling pathways exclusively or prevalently expressed/activated in R-NSCP1 or R-NSCP6. The possible regulatory interactions between mRNAs and miRNAs were also discussed. These molecules or signalling pathways could participate in the control of the full neural specification and differentiation potentials of R-NSCs, and their exact roles await future investigation.5.

IntroductionCommon wheat (Triticum aestivum L., genome constitution AABBDD) is an allohexaploid species that originated from interspecific hybridization between tetraploid wheat (Triticum turgidum L., AABB) and the wild diploid relative, Aegilops tauschii Coss. (DD).1,2 In common wheat, its large genome (17 Gb) and allopolyploidy have complicated the construction of high-resolution genetic maps. Diversity arrays technology (DArT), a microarray hybridization-based technique, has been developed in common wheat for high-throughput genotyping without relying on sequence information.3 DArT generates whole-genome fingerprints by scoring the presence versus absence of DNA fragments in genomic representations generated by the digestion of genomic DNA with a combination of two restriction endonucleases.4 Using the wheat PstI(TaqI) v2.6 array, 1,348 DArT markers were mapped in a hexaploid Synthetic W7984 × Opata M85 doubled haploid population.5 The most recent common wheat PstI(TaqI) v3.0 array comprises about 7,000 markers that are polymorphic in a wide range of wheat cultivars.6Recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology have made it possible to screen a huge number of polymorphic sites even in species without reference genome information. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were discovered by sequencing of a complexity-reduced fraction of the tetraploid wheat genome7 or cDNA of common wheat,8–10 and have been used to develop high-throughput SNP-typing platforms such as BeadExpress,7 KASPar,8 and Infinium.10 Using an Illumina 9K iSelect SNP assay, 7,504 polymorphic loci were positioned in a consensus map constructed based on integrating information on seven common wheat mapping populations.10Improvements in the throughput of NGS technologies made it possible to conduct SNP typing of an entire mapping population by direct sequencing, combining the process of polymorphism discovery and genotyping in a single experiment. In tetraploid and hexaploid wheat, sequence-based genotyping has been performed by sequencing of complexity-reduced genomic DNA11–13 or a targeted genomic region.14 The former, called complexity reduction of polymorphic sequences (CRoPS), restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq), or genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS),15 was applied to the development of high-density genetic maps ranging from >10,00011 to >400,000 markers12 in the hexaploid wheat mapping population. In the latter, the targeted genomic region (for example, exome) can be captured and re-sequenced.14 Sequence-based genotyping is cost-effective and faster than array-based platforms, but often have a significant amount of missing data due to the low coverage of sequencing.15To efficiently construct a high-resolution map in common wheat with few missing data points, we developed a microarray-based polymorphism detection system using NGS data obtained from complexity-reduced genomic DNA samples of two common wheat cultivars, Chinese Spring (CS) and Mironovskaya 808 (M808), and genotyped 210 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) between the two cultivars. Moreover, quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis was performed for 14 morphological and agronomically important traits using the high-density map constructed.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materialCS and M808 were selected because of the difference in growth habit, geographical origin and abiotic stress responses, and the availability of RILs derived from them. M808 was bred in Mironovska Institute, Ukraine. It is reported to be one of the most freezing tolerant wheat cultivars tested.16 In contrast, CS is a spring-type wheat landrace from Sichuan Province in China. A mapping population of 210 RILs derived from a cross between two common wheat cultivars, CS and M808, developed by Kobayashi et al.,16 was used in this study. The plants were grown individually in pots arranged randomly in a field of Kobe University (34°43'N, 135°13'E) in two seasons (2009–10 [Kobe10, indicating location and growing season] and 2011–12 [Kobe12]), and in a glasshouse of Kyoto University (35°2'N, 135°47'E) in the 2011–12 season (Kyoto12). Total DNA from each RIL and the parents was extracted from leaves using standard procedures.162.2. Library preparation and NGSDNA samples (180 ng) of CS and M808 were digested first with PstI (New England BioLabs, Inc., Ipswich, MA, USA) at 37°C for 1 h and then with BstNI (New England BioLabs) at 60°C for 1 h. We selected this combination of restriction enzymes based on in silico analysis in rice, our experience in sugarcane,17,18 and its use in barley.4 Digested DNA was ligated to PstI adapters (5'-CACGATGGATCCAGTGCA-3' and 5'-CTGGATCCATCGTGCA-3') using T4 DNA ligase (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan) and ATP (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan). The ligation reaction was run at 16°C for 16 h and the ligase was inactivated by holding at 60°C for 20 min.Ligated samples were PCR-amplified for 30 cycles using 5'-GATGGATCCAGTGCAG-3' with PrimeSTAR HS DNA Polymerase (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan) under the following conditions: 10 s at 98°C, 15 s at 55°C, and 60 s at 72°C. PCR products were purified using a MinElute PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The constructed libraries were sequenced as 2 × 100 nt paired-end reads on the Genome Analyzer IIx instrument (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). The sequences were deposited to the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) Short Read Archive (DRA001257).2.3. Processing of raw reads and design of probesFirst, trimming of adaptor and primer sequences and low-quality 3' ends (quality score =2) from raw reads was performed using an in-house developed software. Reads with the length of <70 nt were discarded including pairs. CS and M808 libraries were de novo assembled separately using Velvet version 1.1.05.19 Velveth was run with a k-mer size of 65, and velvetg with expected coverage: ‘auto’, coverage cut-off: ‘auto’, insert length of 220 bp, minimum contig length of 100 bp, and allowing scaffolding. From contigs and unused reads (in assembly), tiling probes were designed with a Tm of ~76°C and the length of 50–70 bp.To construct a primary array, the designed probes were first aligned to filtered reads of CS and M808 using Bowtie version 0.12.7,20 where no more than three mismatches were allowed and up to 40 alignments were reported (-v 3, -k 40). CS-derived probes that met all the following five conditions were selected: (i) the number of aligned CS reads with no mismatch was =5, (ii) no aligned CS reads with 1–3 mismatches, (iii) no aligned M808 reads with a perfect match, (iv) no aligned M808 reads with one or two mismatches, and (v) the number of aligned M808 reads with three mismatches was =2. The last condition was included because this array-based polymorphism detection system has been demonstrated to accurately detect differences of more than three nucleotides.17,18 A similar selection was performed with M808 probes. In total, 223,000 probes from both CS and M808 were spotted in triplicate on a NimbleGen 3 × 1.4 M array (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany).2.4. Hybridization and construction of secondary arrayTo select probes for the construction of a secondary array, CS, M808, and 14 randomly selected RILs were genotyped. After digestion of total DNA with PstI and BstNI, adapter ligation, PCR amplification and purification of PCR products as described in the library preparation section, they were labelled with Cy3 using the NimbleGen One-Color DNA Labeling Kit (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Hybridization was performed at 42°C for 72 h on a NimbleGen Hybridization System (Roche Diagnostics). Arrays were scanned using a NimbleGen MS200 Microarray Scanner (Roche Diagnostics) and genotype calling was performed based on the signal intensities.For selection of probes, a <U+03C7>2 test was used to compute segregation of each probe in the 14 RILs. Those deviating from Mendelian 1 : 1 segregation at a 1% significance level were discarded. The secondary array was constructed using one selected probe per contig or read, consisting of 21,346 CS-derived probes, 21,205 M808-derived probes, and 2,303 probes for normalization. These 44,854 probes were spotted in triplicate on a NimbleGen 12 × 135 K array (Roche Diagnostics). This array was used for genotyping of 210 RILs and the two parental lines.2.5. Genetic map constructionThe genotyping data for 422 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were previously generated.16 A total of 140 barc, 1 cfa, 34 cfd, 18 gdm, 109 gwm, 4 hbd, 15 hbe, 41 hbg, and 60 wmc loci were used for chromosomal assignment of wheat array-based markers (WABMs) developed in this study. VRN-D1 was mapped using primer sets 5'-CTGGTTGTCTGCCTCATCA-3' and 5'-CTCTCTCCCCCTGCTAGT-3', and a second copy of Ppd-B121 using 5'-TAACTGCTCGTCACAAGTGC-3' and 5'-CCGGAACCTGAGGATCATC-3'. Loci were assembled into linkage groups using Antmap version 1.222 with the ‘all combination’ method and different threshold distances (5.75, 12.0, 17.5, and 25.0 cM). Loci were ordered using MapDisto version 1.7.7,23 and the genetic distances were calculated with the Kosambi function.242.6. BLAST searches of the mapped contigs and readsTo search repeat elements (REs) in the mapped contigs and reads, they were used as queries against the Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences (MIPS) RE database version 9.0 for Poaceae (ftp://ftpmips.helmholtz-muenchen.de/plants/REdat/) using the blastn algorithm. A blastn search was also performed against Ae. tauschii,25Triticum urartu,26 and barley high-confidence genes and genomic sequences.27 Contigs and reads mapping to the A-genome were searched by the blastn algorithm against the T. urartu draft genome sequence, while those mapping to the D-genome were searched against the Ae. tauschii draft genome sequence.25,26,28 All BLAST hits were filtered with an E-value cut-off of 10-5 and hit length of =50 bp. The genetic map and the results of the RE search were represented in a circular plot using the Circos version 0.63 software.292.7. In silico digestion of the draft genome sequences of T. urartu and Ae. tauschiiUsing an in-house PERL script, genomic scaffolds of T. urartu and Ae. tauschii were fragmented at PstI and BstNI sites, and those having only PstI sites at both ends but not BstNI sites were extracted. A blastn search was performed against the MIPS RE database version 9.0 for Poaceae using as a query the extracted T. urartu and Ae. tauschii genomic fragments with lengths between 65 and 6,000 bp (E-value <10-5 and hit length =50 bp).2.8. In silico mapping to the physical map of barleyFor reads and contigs mapping to the A- and D-genomes, a blastn search was first conducted against draft genomic sequences (T. urartu for the A-genome and Ae. tauschii for the D-genome)25,26 as described above. The obtained scaffolds were mapped based on a blastn search of the genes contained in these scaffolds against the barley genome (E-value <10-5 and hit length =50 bp). The A- and D-genome scaffolds without genes as well as reads and contigs mapping to the B-genome were searched against the barley genome using the same blastn parameters.2.9. Phenotypic measurementsA list of traits, growing season, and location is presented in Supplementary Data. Heading time (HT) and flowering time (FT) were recorded as days after sowing. Maturation time (MT) was evaluated as the number of days that had passed when the ear neck turned yellow. HT, FT, and MT were measured for the three earliest tillers of each plant, and mean values were calculated. Grain-filling period (GFP) was defined as the number of days from flowering to maturation.Spike-related traits (such as spike length [SL], number of spikelets per spike [SpN], SL per number of spikelets [SLperSpN], and top five spikelets length [T5SpL]) and culm length (CL) were assessed for the three earliest tillers of each plant before anthesis. Seed-related traits such as seed length (SdL), seed width (SdW), seed height (SdH), and seed length-to-width ratio (SdLperW) were measured using seeds on the central spikelets of the first, second, and third spikes. For each spikelet, only the components of the first and second florets were used. The mean of the replicated measurements over three spikes was calculated for each trait and used as the trait value in subsequent analyses. SdL, SdW, SdH, and SdLperW were evaluated using at least 10 seeds per line. For tiller number (TN), the number of tillers bearing ears was counted at harvest.2.10. QTL analysisQTLs were analysed by composite interval mapping using R/qtl package version 1.21-230 for the new map and for that constructed by Kobayashi et al.16 using SSR markers. This SSR map was constructed using 412 SSR markers. First, QTL genotype probability was calculated using the function calc.genoprob with a step size of 1 cM and Kosambi map function. QTL analysis was performed with cim function using three marker covariates and Kosambi map function. The log-likelihood (LOD) score threshold was determined by computing a 1,000 permutation test for all traits. The percentage of phenotypic variation (PV) explained by a QTL for a trait was estimated using the fitqtl function in R/qtl.3. Results3.1. Construction of a microarrayTo design probes for the development of a microarray, we sequenced complexity-reduced genomic DNA samples from two common wheat cultivars, CS and M808. Genome complexity was reduced using a combination of two restriction enzymes, PstI and BstNI. After ligation of adapters with sticky ends complementary to the 3'-overhang created by PstI, only the DNA fragments having a PstI site at both ends, with no BstNI site, were amplified by PCR. After trimming and filtering of raw reads, 63,563,396 (6.04 Gb, genome coverage of 0.36× [Supplementary Data]) and 63,961,698 (6.09 Gb, 0.36×) reads were generated for CS and M808, respectively (Fig. 1). Both libraries were independently assembled using Velvet,19 yielding 84,985 contigs and 39,324,373 unused reads during assembly for CS and 123,680 contigs and 33,006,701 unused reads for M808. Figure 1.Open in new tabDownload slideSchematic of primary array development. Raw reads obtained from sequencing complexity-reduced CS and M808 genomic DNA were pre-processed for quality filtering prior to assembly with Velvet. Tiling probes were designed from contigs and unused reads. To predict non-polymorphic probes, alignment to filtered CS and M808 reads was performed. The primary array was constructed by spotting 446,000 filtered probes in triplicate. See Materials and methods for more details.Figure 1.Open in new tabDownload slideSchematic of primary array development.

The primary array was constructed by spotting 446,000 filtered probes in triplicate. See Materials and methods for more details.From contigs and unused reads, tiling probes were designed. The probes were aligned with the filtered reads of CS and M808, and only the probes that predicted detection of ‘presence’ or ‘absence’ alleles were selected (see Section 2.3.). Thus, the primary array contained 1,338,000 probes per plex (446,000 probes in triplicate) on a 3 × 1.4 M array (Fig. 1) with a genome coverage of 4.51 × 10-3 fold.The primary arrays were used for genotyping of CS, M808, and their 14 derived RILs, and of the 446,000 probes, 303,387 were polymorphic. Probes showing segregation distortion from a 1 : 1 ratio at a 1% significance level were discarded and only one probe per contig or read was selected. The final array contained 44,854 probes (including 2,303 probes for normalization, genome coverage of 7.45 × 10-4 fold) in triplicate on a 12 × 135 K array and was used for genotyping of CS, M808, and 210 RILs. We named these microarray probes as WABMs.3.2. Construction of a high-density linkage mapIn a previous study, a linkage map was constructed for 210 RILs of CS and M808 using 422 SSR loci.16 Of the 42,551 microarray probes, polymorphism was observed for 15,530 (36.5%) with a minor allele frequency of =10% among the 210 RILs. Missing data points were counted in each of the RILs and ranged from 17 to 1,074, with an average of 159.0 ± 153.0 (Supplementary Data). To use high-quality data in further analyses, nine RILs with =465.1 (mean + 2 SD) missing data points were excluded. Missing data points were also counted for each marker and ranged from 0 to 42, with an average of 2.49 ± 5.84 (Supplementary Data). Markers with >20 missing data points were excluded, and 14,464 markers were used for genetic map construction.In total, 13,480 markers, including 13,056 WABMs, 422 SSRs, VRN-D1, and Ppd-B1, were grouped into 21 linkage groups. The remaining markers did not form linkage group or the linkage group was small (<10 cM) without chromosomal assignment. Of the mapped WABMs, 7,253 (55.6%) were probes derived from contigs. The probe sequences for these markers are presented in Supplementary Data. The number of total markers per chromosome ranged from 1,256 on chromosome 2B to 85 on chromosome 4D (Table 1). The number of markers with a non-redundant (nr) genotype pattern was 5,243, comprising 2,744 loci (markers with the same position on genetic map). The total map length was 5,093.12 cM, with an average marker interval of 0.38 cM when considering all markers, 0.97 cM per nr marker, and 1.86 cM per locus. Number of markers mapped to each chromosome of common wheatNumber of markers mapped to each chromosome of common wheatSegregation distortion was computed for each marker and P-values of <1.82 × 10-5 (Bonferroni corrected P-value: 0.05/2,744 loci) from a <U+03C7>2 test (1 : 1 ratio) were observed for markers of chromosomes 2B, 2D, 5A, 5B, 6B, and 7B (Fig. 2, Tracks 6 and 7; Supplementary Data). The greatest distortion was observed at the telomeric region of chromosome 6BL (235.8 cM), where the allele frequency was 89.5% for CS and 10.5% for M808.

Annotation of mapped contigs and readsTo annotate mapped contigs or reads, blastn searches were conducted against protein-encoding genes of Ae. tauschii, T. urartu, and barley, and against the RE database of the Poaceae of the MIPS. Of the 13,056 contigs/reads, 32.5, 27.0, and 23.9%, respectively, had hits to the Ae. tauschii, T. urartu, and barley genes (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Data). Overall, 39.8% of the contigs/reads had at least one hit in one of these three databases. These contigs/reads derived from genic regions were distributed all across the wheat genome and chromosomes (Fig. 2, Track 2; Supplementary Data). Figure 3.Open in new tabDownload slideHistogram of annotated WABMs revealed by blastn analyses of genome databases. Reads/contigs anchored to the high-density genetic map were searched using the blastn algorithm against genes of Ae. tauschii, T. urartu, and barley and against Poaceae REs.Figure 3.Open in new tabDownload slideHistogram of annotated WABMs revealed by blastn analyses of genome databases.

Reads/contigs anchored to the high-density genetic map were searched using the blastn algorithm against genes of Ae. tauschii, T. urartu, and barley and against Poaceae REs.REs were found in 11.4% of the mapped contigs/reads (Fig. 3). The proportion of DNA transposons and retroelements was similar (Table 2), and no bias in the distribution was found for these REs (Fig. 2, Tracks 3 and 4; Supplementary Data). The CACTA superfamily (present in 38.7% of the probes) was mainly found among the DNA transposons followed by the miniature inverted-repeat transposable element (MITE) family (25.6%) and Mariner superfamily (17.5%). Among the retroelements, Gypsy (30%), Copia (23%), and other (29%) long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons were the predominant classes. REs found in the mapped contigs and readsREs found in the mapped contigs and readsTo test whether digestion with PstI and BstNI and selection of DNA fragments having only PstI sites at both ends reduced the genomic fraction containing REs, T. urartu and Ae. tauschii genomic scaffolds were digested in silico. Overall, 136,189 and 106,724 fragments were, respectively, generated from the T. urartu and Ae. tauschii scaffolds. The size of A-genome fragments ranged from 6 to 23,779 bp with an average of 57.2 ± 551.7 bp, and that of D-genome fragments varied from 6 to 28,677 bp with an average of 44.9 ± 346.7 bp. The majority of these fragments were =80 bp (Supplementary Data). Because contigs and reads obtained from the NGS data of CS and M808 ranged from 65 bp to <6,000 bp, a blastn search of the in silico digested genomic sequences against the MIPS RE database was performed using as query the A- and D-genome-derived fragments between 65 and 6,000 bp. REs were found in 84,410 (76.1%) of the 110,984 A-genome fragments, and in 60,522 (69.2%) of the 87,466 D-genome fragments. In contrast to the sequences mapping to the linkage map, retroelements predominated on DNA transposons in the fragments derived from the in silico digestion of both T. urartu and Ae. tauschii genomes (Supplementary Data). REs found were mainly members of the CACTA superfamily of DNA transposons or Gypsy retroelements.3.4. In silico mapping of the contigs/reads to the physical map of barleyTo determine how many of the mapped sequences could be used for the analysis of synteny between wheat and barley (Hordeum vulgare L., H-genome) chromosomes, they were mapped in silico to the physical map of barley.27 For sequences mapping to the wheat A- and D-genomes, a blastn search was first conducted, respectively, against the T. urartu and Ae. tauschii draft genomic sequences;25,26 the scaffolds obtained were mapped based on a blastn search of the genes contained in these scaffolds against the barley genome. Of the 4,462 WABMs mapping to the A-genome, hits against the T. urartu genomic scaffolds were obtained in 3,918 (87.8%) sequences, and 2,856 (64.0%) were anchored to the barley physical map (Table 3). In total, 1,658 (37.2%) markers were mapped to the same homoeologous group chromosomes (e.g. between 1A and 1H), accounting for ~40% for most of the chromosomes but only 8.5% for chromosome 4A. Collinearity between the A- and H-genomes was observed for many of these markers (Fig. 4), except on chromosome 4A, where inversions and translocations have been reported.31,32 Translocations among chromosomes 4A, 5A, and 7B could also be observed, as previously reported (Supplementary Data).

The y-axis indicates the position on the physical map of barley in Mb and the x-axis the position on the genetic map of wheat in cM.The proportion of D-genome markers with hits against the Ae. tauschii genomic sequence (1,319/2,228), and consequently, those anchored on the barley physical map (1,006/2,228), was much lower than the A-genome markers (Table 3). However, a similar percentage (41.4%) was observed for markers mapping to the same homoeologous group chromosomes.For B-genome markers, the proportion of hits against the barley genome was similar to that in the A-genome (62.4%), but the number of markers mapping to the same homoeologous group was lower in the B-genome (27.8%, Table 3). Although collinearity with the barley genome was observed for many of these markers, the number of non-syntenic markers tended to be higher in the B-genome (Fig. 4). In general, synteny with barley chromosomes at the centromeric region was clearly observed only in a few chromosomes such as 1A and 2A.3.5. QTL analysis for 14 morphological and agricultural traitsTo compare the efficiency of the newly constructed map with the original SSR map developed by Kobayashi et al.16 for analysing complex traits, QTL analysis of 14 agronomically important traits was performed using both maps. Flowering-related traits such as HT, FT, MT, and GFP were evaluated over two growing seasons at Kobe10 and Kobe12 (see Section 2.1.), and at Kyoto12 (Supplementary Data). Of the spike-related traits, SpN, SLperSpN (indicative of spike compactness), and T5SpL were evaluated for Kobe12; SL was also evaluated for Kyoto12. Seed-related traits such as SdL, SdW, SdH, and SdLperW were measured for Kobe12. Phenotype data for CL and TN were obtained for Kyoto12. The mean values of the parental lines and RILs are shown in Supplementary Data. Strong positive correlations were observed among HT, FT, and MT, and between SL and SLperSpN (Supplementary Data). Relatively, strong correlation was also found between T5SpL and SLperSpN, SdH and SdW, and SdLperW and SdW.QTL analysis was performed using composite interval mapping, and only the QTLs with peaks above the LOD threshold computed by a 1,000-permutation test were selected. The LOD threshold values were significantly higher (P < 0.001) in the new high-density map, with an average of 4.76 ± 0.15, than in the original SSR map (3.76 ± 0.08). In total, 29 QTLs were identified using the SSR map and 32 QTLs using the high-density map, of which 25 were identified in both maps (Supplementary Data and Supplementary Data); seven QTLs were identified only in the high-density map and four QTLs only in the SSR map.The 1.5-LOD support interval, meaning the interval in which the LOD score was within 1.5 units of its maximum, tended to be smaller in the high-density map (average of 14.62 ± 18.03 cM) than in the SSR map (22.01 ± 19.85 cM), but the difference was not significant (P = 0.129) (Table 4). Excluding the D-genome QTLs, where the map resolution was still low, the difference became significant (9.45 ± 3.29 cM for the high-density map and 17.21 ± 11.29 cM for the SSR map, P < 0.01). The number of markers within the 1.5-LOD intervals was also significantly higher (P < 0.05) in the high-density map (average of 16.40 ± 22.97) than in the SSR map (average of 4.20 ± 1.98) (Table 4). Comparison of 1.5-LOD support intervals and number of markers within this interval between the newly constructed and original SSR mapsaOnly the 25 QTLs identified in both maps were included.bKobayashi et al.16Student's t-test was used to test for statistical significance (*P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001).Comparison of 1.5-LOD support intervals and number of markers within this interval between the newly constructed and original SSR mapsaOnly the 25 QTLs identified in both maps were included.bKobayashi et al.16Student's t-test was used to test for statistical significance (*P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001).Most of the identified QTLs were located in a similar chromosomal region to those previously reported (Supplementary Data). Of the flowering-related traits, the early flowering effect of the CS Ppd-B1 allele was observed in all the datasets and explained >30% of the PV. The early flowering effect of CS at 5B and 5D QTL for HT and FT was observed only in one environment (Kyoto12 and Kobe12, respectively), indicating a possible genotype × environment interaction.Of the spike-related traits, QTLs for SL were identified on chromosomes 3A, 4A, and 6A, and explained ~10% of the total PV. The CS allele increased SL at the 3A QTL, but decreased it at the 4A and 6A QTLs. The 3A QTL also exhibited an effect on T5SpL (explaining 7.77% of PV) and SLperSpN (9.82% of PV). Similarly, the 4A QTL also affected T5SpL (15.39% of PV) and SLperSpN (10.39% of PV) and might explain the positive correlation between these traits (Supplementary Data). The 6A QTL had an effect on SLperSpN explaining 15.01% of the PV. QTLs for SpN were identified on homoeologous group 2 chromosomes, of which 2B QTL (linked to the Ppd-B1 locus) exhibited a major effect and explained 22.16% of the PV.A QTL for SdL was detected on chromosome 3A (6.25% of PV), and another was detected for SdH on chromosome 1B (9.60% PV). QTLs for SdW and SdLperW were detected on the long arm of chromosome 2D, and explained, respectively, 5.94 and 8.78% of the total PV. This QTL also might explain the significant correlation between SdW and SdLperW (Supplementary Data).4. DiscussionThe construction of high-resolution genetic maps in common wheat has required extensive effort due to its large genome and allohexaploid nature. More than 60% of wheat and barley genomes are composed of REs, with retroelements found at least four times more frequently than DNA transposons.25–27,33 In this study, a microarray-based polymorphism detection system was developed using NGS data obtained from complexity-reduced genomic DNA samples of CS and M808. Although the reduction in complexity using a combination of two restriction enzymes, PstI and BstNI, did not affect the composition of REs (Supplementary Data), most of the array-based markers used for construction of the genetic map were derived from genic regions (Supplementary Data). In addition, retroelements were under-represented in the array-based markers, indicating that the selection of useful polymorphic probes decreased the number of sequences derived from highly repetitive regions.SNP typing of the entire mapping population using NGS technology has also been applied in polyploid wheat species.11–13 Although the GBS approach is cost-effective and fast, it also often leads to a significant amount of missing data due to the low coverage of sequencing.15 These missing data points have mostly been replaced with estimated genotypes through statistical imputation.15 An advantage of the array-based genotyping approach in wheat is the low generation of missing data, in contrast to the GBS approach. In 9 of the 210 RILs (F7 generation) of CS and M808, the number of missing data points was higher than the mean + 2 SD, and they were thus excluded. These missing data points can be explained in part by the presence of heterozygous regions, because data of ambiguous intensity were converted into missing values. In the remaining 201 RILs, no missing data were observed for most of the markers (Supplementary Data), indicating a high yield of data from this array-based genotyping system.The high-density genetic map was composed of 13,480 SSR marker and WABMs, and the markers were distributed across the allohexaploid wheat genome, especially in the A- and B-genomes (Fig. 2). The mapped marker number was similar to that constructed using the GBS approach.11 As reported in previous studies, the number of markers in the D-genome was much lower than in the A- and B-genomes of common wheat (Table 1).8,10 The reads and contigs anchored to the high-density map were also mapped in silico against the physical map of barley, because common wheat lacks any physical map. The draft genome sequences of T. urartu26 and Ae. tauschii25 were used for the anchoring of A- and D-genome markers, whereas B-genome markers were directly mapped to the barley genome. The use of T. urartu and Ae. tauschii genome information greatly increased the number of markers aligned on the same homoeologous group chromosomes of barley compared with the B-genome markers (Table 3). Because of the lower number of D-genome markers, collinearity with barley chromosomes was difficult to observe (Fig. 4). In most cases, collinearity was not observed at the centromeric region. This might be due to the lower gene density and higher number of repetitive sequences present in the proximal region of barley and wheat chromosomes.27,28In the high-density map, segregation distortion was observed in six chromosomal regions, with the long arm of chromosome 6B showing the greatest distortion (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Data). This might have been caused by the presence of the pollen killer gene, Ki, on the long arm of chromosome 6B of CS.34,35Ki would affect marker segregation in a large chromosomal region of 6BL, though its position on 6BL has not been accurately determined yet.35 Distortions on chromosomes 2B and 5B are due to an epistatic interaction of hybrid necrosis alleles, Ne1w on the long arm of chromosome 5B of CS, and Ne2 on the short arm of chromosome 2B of M808.35Ne1 and Ne2 have been roughly mapped to 5BL and 2BS, respectively.36 The distorted regions of 2BS and 5BL were more limited around the causal genes than on 6BL. The three other segregation distortions on chromosomes 2A, 5A, and 7B were not observed in our previous study using the original SSR map of CS and M808.35 Thus, the increased map resolution should clarify the presence of additional regions showing segregation distortion. However, the causal genes for the segregation distortion on chromosomes 2A, 5A, and 7B are unknown. In general, segregation distortion is considered to occur due to the presence of a reproductive barrier gene,37–39 suggesting that reproductive barrier genes might be located in these three chromosomal regions.QTL analysis using the high-density and SSR maps identified a similar number of QTLs for both maps (Supplementary Data). Although most of the QTLs were commonly identified in the two maps, a higher number of QTLs was identified in the high-density map. In the high-density map, the LOD threshold values computed by a 1,000-permutation test were significantly higher, as reported in rice.40 Thus, the four QTLs identified only in the SSR map might be masked in the high-density map due to these higher threshold values. The increased map resolution resulted in identification of QTLs in a narrower chromosomal region and in a more accurate position than for the SSR map (Table 4 and Supplementary Data).In the high-density map, the QTL associated with flowering-related traits corresponded well to the Ppd-B1 locus on chromosome 2B and the VRN-D1 locus (Supplementary Data). The early flowering phenotype of CS (Supplementary Data) can be explained mainly by the effect of the photoperiod-insensitive allele of Ppd-B1 (probably due to its higher copy number)41,42 and dominant spring allele of VRN-D1.43 The spike compactness (SL/SpN) and short SL of CS can be explained by the 6A and 4A QTLs. The 4A QTL also exhibited an effect on T5SpL, which might contribute to the square-head like spike morphology of CS. On the other hand, the CS allele at the 3A QTL contributed to a less compact spike, longer SL, and longer T5SpL. Grain size and shape are associated with milling quality and yield in wheat. Large and spherical grains have been predicted to be the optimum grain morphology to increase milling yield.44 The CS allele at the 2D QTL, with an increasing effect on SdW and reduced SdLperW, and the M808 allele at the 1B QTL (increased SdH) contributed in seed roundness. Favourable alleles for increasing yield were also found in CS at the 2B QTL for CL (reduced plant height) and at the 1A QTL for TN (increased number of tillers with ears). Therefore, the results of QTL analyses indicate that the high-density map efficiently and precisely functions to identify QTLs for morphological and agricultural traits.Because of the difference in geographical origin and growth habit of the common wheat cultivars CS (spring habit Chinese variety) and M808 (winter habit Ukrainian variety) used for the development of our array-based system, it is expected to work better between spring and winter wheat and/or Chinese/Asian and European variety. Further study is needed to test the usefulness of this genotyping system using a large wheat population set.A number of tightly linked WABMs were found in most of the QTLs, which could facilitate marker-assisted selection or map-based cloning of genes. For this application, the marker of interest should be converted into a PCR marker. Our results demonstrated that this array-based polymorphism detection system can yield high-quality genotype data useful for high-density genetic map construction and QTL analysis of agronomically important traits.FundingThis work was supported by a grant from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) of Japan [Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B) no. 25292008] to S.T., by cooperative research funds from TOYOTA Motor Co.

IntroductionIntestinal epithelial cells (IECs) act as a mucosal barrier between the luminal environment (i.e. microbes and their toxins as well as food-derived antigens) and the internal milieu, and actively contribute to the gut immune system.1 Maintenance of this barrier is crucial for the homeostasis, i.e. the immune system's ability to remain tolerant to antigens. Therefore, dysregulation within the epithelial layer can increase permeability, lead to abnormalities in interactions between IECs and immune cells, and disturb the intestinal immune homeostasis, all of which are linked to the clinical disease course of several intestinal disorders including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).2 IBD is a chronic inflammation of the intestine and is characterized by an imbalanced production of a wide range of pro-inflammatory mediators including tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-a3. TNF-a is a central pro-inflammatory cytokine in IBD and the use of TNF-inhibitors in the treatment of IBD has been successful.4 The Caco-2 cell line is a widely used model for human IECs, resembling the in vivo differentiation of enterocytes/colonocytes both morphologically and biochemically.5 Because of this, it is an important model for molecular studies focused on gut disease including IBD. At the same time, differentiated Caco-2 cells are widely used to predict the absorption of orally administrated drugs in the pharmaceutical industry.Despite its wide usage in both applied and basic science, there have been only few comprehensive genome-wide efforts to characterize Caco-2 on the transcriptional level. This is needed, because genome-wide methods have shown that the majority of genes have multiple isoforms, driven by alternative promoter usage,6,7 alternative splicing,8 or alternative transcription termination.9 Usage of alternative isoforms can have drastic functional impact, for instance by loss of functional protein domains.10 Microarray-based methods will fail to pinpoint the exact promoters that are responding to cellular changes, because most genes have alternative promoters.6 Alternative promoters are often tissue- or context-specific6 and can thereby be viewed as independent regulatory platforms in which different cellular contexts can influence the expression of a gene. An example of this is the DLGAP gene which has four alternative promoters, each specific for a different brain tissue.10 Despite its importance, alternative promoter usage is uncharacterized in most medically relevant models.State-of-the-art methods for the detection of active promoters or transcription start sites (TSSs) are CAGE11 and TSS-seq.12 These methods are genome-wide and based on generating full-length cDNAs from mRNAs, followed by sequencing the first 20–40 nucleotides from their 5'-end. These techniques have been used to chart mammalian genomes,13,14 dissect TSS usage in core promoters, investigate evolutionary conservation and turnover, and for systems biology of developing macrophages (reviewed in refs15,16). The CAGE technique has been thoroughly validated by gene reporter assays, histone marks and other RNA sequencing techniques (e.g. refs6,10,14,17,18).Surprisingly, the CAGE technique can also identify active enhancers, since the active enhancers are lowly transcribed in a bidirectional pattern.19 Using massive enhancer reporter screens, we have previously shown19 that this approach is more than two times as accurate as non-transcribed enhancer candidates identified by histone modification ChIP-seq or DHS-seq (e.g. refs20–22).In this study, we present the first genome-wide map of promoters for the Caco-2 cell line, before and after stimulation with pro-inflammatory TNF-a. We show that TNF-a stimulation induces expression from a large number of promoters, where many are novel alternative promoters of well-characterized genes and some represent completely novel TNF-a-specific non-protein-coding transcripts. Similarly, we identify many candidate enhancer regions that respond to TNF-a stimulation and can be linked with similarly responding genes. Finally, we show that many TNF-a-responsive promoters and enhancers are likely regulated by known inflammatory factors like NF-<U+03BA>B.2. Materials and methods2.1. Cell culture and stimulationThe human intestinal cell line Caco-2 (American Tissue Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD, USA) cells were cultivated as monolayers and maintained as previously described.23 For stimulation experiments, 106 cells were seeded in 24-well plates (NUNC Brand, Thermo Fisher, Rochester, NY, USA) and grown to >95% confluence. Cells were then stimulated in medium with or without TNF-a (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) in the presence or absence of tosyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK) NF-<U+03BA>B inhibitor; 100 µM; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), FR180204 (ERK inhibitor; 30 µM; Merck Chemicals, Darmstadt, Germany), or vehicle [0.4% dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO); Sigma-Aldrich] as done previously.24 In experiments involving treatment with inhibitors, cells were exposed to the inhibitors 1 h prior to the addition of TNF-a and subsequently stimulated with TNF-a (10 nM) for 24 h. For CAGE analysis, we used biological triplicates with or without TNF-a (10 nM).2.2. Protein extraction and immunoblottingProtein extraction and immunoblotting was done as described in Seidelin et al.,25 using LAMC2 (1 : 333; mouse monoclonal, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) antibodies (1 : 20,000; mouse monoclonal; Fitzgerald, Concord, MA, USA).2.3. CAGE library preparation and processingCAGE libraries were prepared from 5 µg of total RNA purified using the Purelink mini kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) as recommended by the manufacturer. Libraries were prepared and mapped to the hg19 assembly as in ref.19 CAGE tags that mapped close to each other on the same strand were grouped into 52,451 tag clusters (TCs) as in ref.26 The expression level for each library in each TC was normalized to sample size (tags per million mapped tags, TPM). For differential expression assessment, we used EdgeR27 on the TCs having >4TPM and used an FDR threshold of <0.05, comparing TNF-a stimulation and control replicates. This defined a set of TCs that were induced by TNF-a [TNF-a(+)] and a set of TCs that are depleted [TNF-a (-)].2.4. Gene ontology analysisTNF-a(+), TNF-a(-) and the set of all TNF-a TCs with TPM > 4 were intersected with RefSeq genes. Genes with more than two TCs were counted only once. DAVID28 was used to identify enriched gene ontology (GO) terms, using default settings. The RefSeq gene symbols were uploaded and converted to DAVID gene symbols. For the TNF-a(+) and TNF-a(-) sets, only Homo sapiens annotations were used. All Caco-2 TCs with TPM > 4 was used as background. Only overrepresentations of GO terms, where P < 0.05 (Benjamini corrected), were reported.2.5. Enhancer detection, expression quantification and promoter associationsPutative Caco-2 enhancers were identified from CAGE-derived bidirectionally transcribed loci, as discussed in ref.19 In summary, bidirectionally transcribed loci were defined from forward and reverse strand CAGE tag TCs supported by at least two CAGE tags in at least one sample. Only TCs not overlapping antisense TCs were used. We identified divergent (reverse–forward) TC pairs separated by at most 400 bp and merged all such pairs containing the same TC, while at the same time avoiding overlapping forward and reverse strand transcribed regions (prioritization by expression ranking). A centre position was defined for each bidirectional locus as the mid position between the rightmost reverse strand TC and leftmost forward strand TC included in the merged bidirectional pair. Each bidirectional locus was further associated with two 200 bp regions immediately flanking the centre position, one (left) for reverse strand transcription and one (right) for forward strand transcription, in a divergent manner. The merged bidirectional pairs were further required to be bidirectionally transcribed (CAGE tags supporting both windows flanking the centre) in at least one individual sample, and to have a greater aggregate of reverse CAGE tags (over all samples) than forward CAGE tags in the 200 bp region associated with reverse strand transcription, and vice versa. We quantified the expression of bidirectional loci for each strand and 200 bp flanking window in each sample separately by counting the CAGE tags whose 5' ends were located within these windows. The expression values of both flanking windows were normalized by converting tag counts to TPM. The number of CAGE tags aligned to ChrM was subtracted from the total number of aligned CAGE tags in each library before normalization. The normalized expression values from both windows were used to calculate a sample-set wide directionality score, D, for each enhancer over aggregated normalized reverse, R, and forward, F, strand expression values across all samples; D=(F - R)/(F + R). D ranges between -1 and 1 and specifies the bias in expression to reverse and forward strand, respectively [D = 0 means 50% reverse and 50% forward strand expression, whereas abs(D) close to 1 indicates unidirectional transcription]. Each bidirectional locus was assigned one expression value for each sample by summing the normalized expression of the two flanking windows. Bidirectional loci were further filtered to have low, non-promoter-like, directionality scores [abs(D) <0.8] and to be located distant to TSSs and exons of protein- and multi-exonic non-coding genes. This set was used to extend the set of CAGE-defined enhancers by the functional annotation of mammalian genomes (FANTOM) consortium from a large number of tissues and cells.19 The expression of these enhancers were quantified in each individual Caco-2 CAGE library as described above, and enhancers supported by at least three CAGE tags in any Caco-2 library were considered for further analyses. Enhancers with an absolute log2 expression fold change =2 between average TNF-a stimulated and unstimulated samples were considered differentially expressed. Putative enhancer–promoter associations were derived from proximal enhancer–promoter pairs (within 200 kb) with correlated expression (Pearson's r >0.5).2.6. Motif overrepresentation analysisRegions -300 to +100 bp around the gene TSS (as in ref.17) were scanned with all JASPAR29 motifs using the Clover motif overrepresentation tool30 with default settings, and all not-significantly regulated TCs as background. When analysing TNF-responsive enhancers, the regions ±300 bp around the mid-positions were used, using non-responsive enhancers as background.2.7. qPCR validation of promoter usageTotal RNA from Caco-2 cells was extracted using the NucleoSpin columns (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany) following the manufacturer's protocol. Total RNA (1–2 µg) was used to prepare cDNA by SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) reactions were performed on a Stratagene Mx3000P thermocycler (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) using the Maxima SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) according to manufacturer's instructions. All primers were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Leuven, Belgium). Primers were designed to amplify regions immediately downstream of the CAGE signal (Supplementary Table S1). Target gene expression values were normalized to the RPLP0 gene, which was amplified in parallel reactions.2.8. Transient transfection assaysOne day prior to transfection, Caco-2 cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well and transiently transfected the following day as described previously.31 In stimulation experiments, the medium was changed 24 h after transfection, washed and subsequently stimulated with or without TNF-a (10 nM) for the next 24 h. LAMC2 luciferase reporter constructs were: pGL3-LAMC2 containing the 1.2 kb LAMC2 promoter region upstream of TSS32 and pGL3-LAMC2 + Enhancer containing the 1.2 kb LAMC2 promoter and the enhancer region at chr1:183,149,939–183,150,336 (hg19). The pGL3-LAMC2 + enhancer plasmid was constructed by amplifying the enhancer region by PCR and subcloning it into pGL3-LAMC2 in the Sal1 site of pGL3-plasmid upstream of the LAMC2 promoter using the In-Fusion® HD Cloning kit from Clontech. For assays investigating the effect of overexpression of NF-<U+03BA>B subunits on the LAMC2 transcriptional activity, pCMV4-p65 and pCMV4-p50 (Addgene plasmid number: 21966 and 2196533) or pCMV4-p52 (Addgene plasmid number: 2328934) were used. Plasmids were co-transfected with the LAMC2 reporter constructs. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, cells were harvested and lysed; luciferase and ß-galactosidase activities were determined using the Dual Light system (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA) according to manufacturer's instructions.3. Results3.1. CAGE identifies novel TNF-a-responsive promotersWe prepared CAGE libraries from total RNA from Caco-2 cells pre-treated with or without TNF-a in biological triplicates. CAGE tags were mapped to the human genome, and nearby CAGE tags were grouped into 52,451 TCs. As in previous work, we will for simplicity refer to these TCs as candidate ‘promoters’. Using an expression cut-off of four TPM to focus on strong initiation events, 13,970 TCs were retained, of which 92% overlapped an annotated RefSeq gene model. The remaining 8% were labelled novel intergenic promoter candidates. A substantial fraction of genes (23%) had two or more overlapping TCs on the same strand, suggesting alternative initiation events that would not be detected by, for example, microarray techniques. As in the ENSEMBL annotation pipeline35 we defined the canonical TSS as the TSS that is the most upstream in annotated gene models. Of the TCs overlapping RefSeq genes, 61% (7.814 TCs) were within 100 nt from the canonical annotated TSS, while 7% (902 TCs) were within 100 nt of annotated alternative promoters, and the final 32% (4,101) did not overlap any annotated TSS; we labelled these candidate novel alternative promoters (Fig. 1A and B). In order to compare with a more comprehensive, but less conservative, gene annotation, the same TCs were overlapped with the Gencode V19 basic gene annotation.36 While the number of TCs mapping to gene models and canonical TSSs did not change substantially (94 and 53%, respectively) compared with the RefSeq results, a larger fraction of TCs within genes were overlapping Gencode-annotated TSSs (25%), indicating that many of the intragenic TCs correspond to real mRNA TSSs (Fig. 1C).

We subsequently refer to these two categories as TNF-a(+) and TNF-a(-) promoters/TCs.RefSeq genes overlapping TNF-a(+) promoters were enriched in GO terms involving immune response, defence and cytokine activity (Table 1). Many of the TNF-a(+) genes are well-studied responders to TNF-a stimulation and/or inflammation including the TNF<U+0391>IP3,37PTGS2,38CFLAR,39IL-8,40HDAC941 and SGPP242 genes. The TNF-a(-) genes include genes associated with cell growth, including histone 1 genes. In both TNF-a(+) and TNF-a(-) sets, we observed a remarkably high number of alternative promoters—either novel or overlapping annotated cDNAs starting within known genes; this is particularly true for TNF-a(+) promoters, where 54% are novel: 143 correspond to candidate alternative promoters within known genes, and 49 correspond to novel intergenic promoters (Fig. 1D and E).

We validated their response to TNF-a by qPCR in quadruplicates and four different TNF-a concentrations. For validating alternative promoters, we used two primer pairs: one pair located immediately downstream of the TC of interest and the other pair just downstream of the most upstream annotated promoter. In the large majority (16 of 20) of cases, the qPCR results validated the CAGE data as well as the response to TNF-a (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Figure S1).

This figure appears in colour in the online version of DNA Research.The first example is the CFLAR gene (Fig. 2A), a regulator of apoptosis, known to be up-regulated in IECs from patients with active UC.25 The most upstream promoter is only slightly TNF-a-responsive (1.3-fold increase, P < 0.01), while the alternative promoter is more responsive (3.6-fold, P < 0.001). Similarly, the NCK1 gene, involved in signal transduction, has an alternative promoter with a high up-regulation (170-fold, P < 0.001) at the highest concentration of TNF-a, while the response of the most upstream promoter is less than two-fold (P < 0.01) (Fig. 2B). The alternative promoter is predicted to lead to loss of an SH3 domain, described further below.The PLD1 gene, a phospoholipase used in signal transduction (Fig. 2C) and utilized by TNF-a to activate the NF-<U+03BA>B and extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK1/2) during an immune response,44 has two promoters defined by CAGE, where the annotated most upstream promoter is slightly activated by TNF-a (1.8-fold increase P < 0.001), but the novel promoter found ~30 kb downstream is down-regulated more than 4-fold (P < 0.001) (Fig. 2C). This demonstrates that the genes are not only up-regulated as a consequence of TNF-a stimulation.We also confirmed that two uncharacterized, long, non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) found by CAGE are responding to TNF-a stimulation. The first (Fig. 2D), annotated by GENCODE36 as RP11-283G6.5 extends 40 kb downstream to overlap the 3' UTR of the SSPN gene on the antisense strand, is increased more than 60-fold in response to TNF-a (P < 0.001). Such chains of linked sense–antisense RNAs have been previously described45 and sense–antisense pairs have the potential to influence each other's expression levels.46 The other lncRNA (Fig. 2E) only has support from ENCODE RNA-seq and ESTs, is situated in a large intergenic region and is 50% down-regulated as a response to TNF-a (P < 0.01). Since this lncRNA is functionally uncharacterized, further experiments are needed to deduce the impact of this down-regulation, but we note that there is evidence for other lncRNAs with direct functional roles in inflammation, such as the LEHTE lncRNA which is induced by TNF-a, and binds NF-<U+03BA>B in a negative feedback loop.47Finally, we validated a TNF-a-responsive bidirectional promoter composed of the annotated IFIH1 gene (involved in interferon response and linked to autoimmune diseases) and a paired novel promoter starting on the opposite strand ~200 bp upstream of the IFIH1 promoter (both promoters are >12-fold up-regulated, P < 0.001) (Fig. 2F). GENCODE gene annotation36 shows that the novel promoter on the plus strand is likely a distal promoter of the GCA gene, a regulator of adhesion. We note that the canonical promoter of GCA is expressed on similar levels before and after TNF-a. Therefore, we hypothesize that usage of the bidirectional promoter will make GCA partially responsive to TNF-a.3.2. Loss of protein domain-coding exons due to alternative promoter usageAs discussed above, many of the responding TCs correspond to known or novel alternative promoter candidates. Related to this, 41 RefSeq gene models contained two or more significantly responding TCs. In most of the cases (36), all TCs within a gene were up-regulated, in four cases both TCs were down-regulated and in one case (TMEM150B) one TC was significantly up-regulated while the other TC was significantly down-regulated.A handful of genes where the use of an alternative promoter leads to exclusion of coding exons have been described previously.48 One example is the promoter usage in the LEF1 gene. This gene contains an N-terminal domain necessary and sufficient to bind ß-catenin, a central domain that interacts with co-repressors and a C-terminal DNA-binding domain. The protein has two promoters: promoter 1 produces full-length proteins which recruit ß-catenin to Wnt signalling, and promoter 2 produces proteins lacking the ß-catenin-binding domain and therefore functions as repressors of Wnt signalling, hence the two isoforms will have opposing effects. An imbalance in the usage of these to promoters is, for example, seen in colon cancer, where promoter 2 is silenced.49Our CAGE data make it possible to assess the frequency of these types of events in Caco-2 as a response to TNF-a. We found that 75 of the TNF-a(+) promoters are within an annotated coding region. These represent shorter RNA isoforms, which, if translated, would give rise to N-termini-truncated proteins. To identify cases similar to the LEF1 example above, we investigated if any of the intragenic TNF-a(+) promoters were located within or downstream of PFAM50 protein domains mapped to the coding sequence. In total, we found 39 promoters in 33 genes, where usage of the TNF-a(+) promoter would lead to RNAs that exclude one or more protein domains. Five of the promoters were within 100 bp from a known (alternative) RefSeq promoter, where all the gene products are annotated as protein coding. In these cases, it is likely that these TNF-a(+)-responsive promoters are producing proteins with truncated N-termini and loss of functional domains. For non-annotated alternative promoters, further validation is needed to prove that the produced RNAs are translated. We here show four examples of genes where exons containing domains are lost when using the TNF-a(+) promoters (Fig. 3). Examples of loss of exons coding for protein domains due to alternative promoter usage.

This figure appears in colour in the online version of DNA Research.The NCK1 gene, described and validated above (Fig. 2B), have two promoters; the upstream P1 at the canonical promoter and P2, which is an alternative TSS and preferentially used after TNF-a treatment. When using P2, one of the SH3_1 domains and one of the SH3_2 domains are lost (Fig. 3A). SH3 and SH2 domains are important for protein–protein interaction, and the alternative promoter usage could potentially lead to an up-regulation of Ras activity in the cell.51A more extreme example of loss of multiple domains is COL16A1 (qPCR validation showed in Supplementary Figure S1G). This gene encodes the alpha chain of type XVI collagen and maintains the integrity of the extracellular matrix. COL16A1 contains several collagen domains and usage of the alternative downstream promoter decreases the number of collagen repeats from 18 to 10 (Fig. 3B). This exemplifies a trend in the dataset: if a domain is lost there is often (7 of 33 genes with alternative promoters analysed) another instance of the domain still present in the resulting transcript.In some cases, usage of an alternative downstream promoter leaves a transcript without predicted domains. This is the case for the zinc finger protein TRIM29 (Fig. 3C). In the unstimulated state little transcription is observed from this gene, but after stimulation we observe high expression from an alternative promoter situated approximately in the middle of the gene. Using this promoter leads to loss of a B-box-type zinc finger domain, often involved in ubiquitinylation, and it is unclear whether the remaining transcript has any function on protein level (Fig. 3C).Another example of a gene where no downstream domains are kept is the apoptotic regulator BCL2L13 (Fig. 3D). Most of the expression of this gene comes from two distinct promoters, P1 at the annotated 5' end of the gene, and P2 mapping to an annotated start site, which corresponds to an RNA including only the last exon of the gene. In the unstimulated state P1 is primarily used. When stimulated the usage is switched: P2 now shows the highest expression. When P2 is used, the PFAM protein domain Bcl-2 is lost (Fig. 3D). The shorter transcript, produced from P2, has been described previously:52 overexpression of the transcript resulted in higher activation of caspase-3 and apoptosis than the full-length variant. A necessary caveat for these examples is that whereas CAGE data might reveal whether a protein-coding domains is lost due to alternative promoter usage, it cannot prove whether a certain alternative promoter produces a transcript that is translated into a protein, in particular in cases where the alternative promoter is not previously annotated and linked to sequenced full-length RNAs.3.3. Identification of enhancer candidates responding to TNF-aWe have previously shown that bidirectional CAGE TCs situated at most 200 nt from each other can identify enhancer RNA.19 The method has been extensively validated with >100 in vitro reporter gene assays and shown to be a more accurate prediction method for enhancer activity than untranscribed hypersensitive sites or enhancer candidates predicted by chromatin immunoprecipitation.19 We have also shown that expression correlations between the enhancer activity and that of nearby promoters can identify physical interactions. With the same approach as in ref.,19 using a combination of the CAGE data from this study supplemented by CAGE data from a wide range of tissues,14,19 we found 890 Caco-2-expressed candidate enhancers, where 62% overlap Caco-2 DNase hypersensitive sites20 (Supplementary Table S3). Of these, 443 (49.7%) responded 4-fold or more to stimulation by TNF-a compared with control and 222 (of the 443) were up-regulated as a response to TNF-a stimulation. Within the list of 443 TNF-a-responsive enhancers, we found 37 unique enhancer–promoter pairs with a maximal distance of 200 kb, where the enhancer and the promoter expression are highly correlated before and after stimulation, suggesting regulatory interaction. An interesting example of such pairings is the enhancer 60 kb downstream of the UBR4 gene,53 linked by co-expression to a novel alternative promoter within the UBR4 locus. We subsequently validated the promoter expression change by qPCR (Fig. 4A). Other examples include the TNF-a-induced candidate enhancer region located within the first intron of the TNFSF10 gene—a member of the TNF ligand superfamily, whose annotated promoter is also highly induced by TNF-a (Fig. 4B), and an enhancer candidate 2 kb upstream of the ANXA13 gene (known to increase in expression during epithelial cell differentiation54) where both the gene promoter and the enhancer expression is decreased as a response to TNF-a (Fig. 4C).

Regulation of LAMC2 TNF-a response: an example of CAGE-enabled targeted analysisComputational prediction of transcription factor-binding sites in promoter regions identified by CAGE has proved to be a powerful approach for the identification of key transcription factors in a given system.6,10,16,17 Indeed, NF-<U+03BA>B-binding sites, and binding sites of other known inflammatory transcription factors such as SPIB (Table 2), are significantly overrepresented in TNF-a(+) promoters, which fits with previous work.56Clover analysis of overrepresented transcription factor-binding sites in the -300 to +100 bp region covering CAGE TCs found in differentially expressed promoters of Caco-2, in response to TNF-a stimulationP-values are calculated by Clover.55 Motif names are taken from the JASPAR database.Clover analysis of overrepresented transcription factor-binding sites in the -300 to +100 bp region covering CAGE TCs found in differentially expressed promoters of Caco-2, in response to TNF-a stimulationP-values are calculated by Clover.55 Motif names are taken from the JASPAR database.We were encouraged that the same transcription factor-binding sites were also overrepresented in the CAGE-defined enhancers activated by TNF-a (Table 3). These sites were not overrepresented in TNF-a(-) promoters and enhancers, which instead had an overrepresentation of hepatocyte nuclear factor motifs (HNF-4a and HNF-3a) (Tables 2 and 3). Since HNF-4a is important for the differentiation of the IECs during embryonic development, the overrepresentation of HNF-4a sites in the non-stimulated promoters and enhancers could indicate that unstimulated cells are differentiating towards an IEC-like state57 while differentiation is repressed in stimulated cells. Clover analysis of overrepresented transcription factor-binding sites in the -300 to +300 bp region around the centre of CAGE-defined enhancers active in Caco-2, in response to TNF-a stimulationP-values are calculated by Clover.55Clover analysis of overrepresented transcription factor-binding sites in the -300 to +300 bp region around the centre of CAGE-defined enhancers active in Caco-2, in response to TNF-a stimulationP-values are calculated by Clover.55As a case example, we focused on the LAMC2 gene (Fig. 5A) whose main promoter is >8-fold up-regulated in TNF-a-stimulated Caco-2 cells as measured by CAGE. LAMC2 has previously been shown to be induced by TNF-a in other cell lines.58 Indeed, we validated that TNF-a stimulation (P < 0.05, t-test) increased the expression of LAMC2 mRNA and protein levels in a dose-dependent manner with a maximal effect observed at 10 nM (Fig. 5B and C). TNF-a can initiate pro-inflammatory signalling by activating the NF-<U+03BA>B pathway and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. In mammals there are three major constituents of the MAPK superfamily: ERKs (ERK1/2 or p42/p44), c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK1/2/3) and the p38 MAPK family.56 The NF-<U+03BA>B family of transcription factors consists of five mammalian members [NFKB1(p50), NFKB2(p52), RELA(p65) and RELB]59,60 that can form either homodimers or heterodimers. Therefore, the role of these signalling pathways in TNF-a-mediated up-regulation of endogenous LAMC2 expression in Caco-2 cells was investigated. Interestingly, we noticed a ~400 nt long candidate enhancer region (chr1: 183,149,939–183,150,336, hg19 assembly) upstream of the LAMC2 TSS, which is predicted to have a single NF-<U+03BA>B-binding site and is also bound by RELA as indicated by ENCODE ChIP-seq21 data (Fig. 5A). Consistent with the hypothesis of NF-<U+03BA>B-mediated regulation, the NF-<U+03BA>B inhibitor TPCK effectively diminished the effect of TNF-a on LAMC2 mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 5E and F). Moreover, it has previously been demonstrated that an active ERK pathway is involved in the regulation of LAMC2 in squamous cell carcinoma.61 However, inhibition of ERK1/2 with FR180204 had only a minor effect on the TNF-a-induced LAMC2 mRNA expression (Fig. 5D) and almost no effect on the LAMC2 protein levels (Fig. 5F) in our experiments. Since these findings indicate a transcriptional up-regulation by TNF-a and NF-<U+03BA>B, we measured the effect of TNF-a on the activity of an LAMC2 promoter construct32 with and without the predicted enhancer; the enhancerless construct did not respond to TNF-a, but the enhancer–promoter construct gave a 3-fold increase in reporter signal (P < 0.001 (t-test)) (Fig. 5G). Validating the causal role of NF-<U+03BA>B, co-transfection of LAMC2 reporter constructs with RELA in combination with NFKB1 or NFKB2-expression plasmids could significantly (P < 0.001 (t-test)) up-regulate the enhancer–promoter construct but not the enhancerless construct.

DiscussionHere, we have presented the first TSS map of the Caco-2 cell line, and the changes in TSS usage as a response to TNF-a. We show that almost half of the TNF-a-activated promoters are novel, underscoring the importance of alternative and novel promoters in particular and the merit of experimental methods not based on annotated genes. Several of these have the potential to produce gene products that loose coding regions for important domains. Regardless of whether the candidate promoters were known, overlapped known genes or represented novel transcripts, qPCR-based experiments could validate the large majority of the chosen promoters as TNF-a responsive promoters (negative or positive).CAGE has previously been used to locate active enhancer regions and their putative gene targets,19 and its application to Caco-2 cells highlights a large number of enhancer candidates, where many are TNF-a-responsive. Interestingly, we observed that the same type of transcription factor-binding sites were overrepresented in both promoters and enhancer regions that were activated as a response to TNF-a. Related to this, a case study guided by the CAGE technique identified an NF-<U+03BA>B-responsive enhancer region regulating the LAMC2 gene, which explains its responsiveness to TNF-a.62LAMC2 has previously been shown to be a useful biomarker in the diagnosis of the invasiveness of cervical adenocarcinoma63 and in colorectal cancer,64 but was here shown to be a potential inflammatory marker as well.We have here presented comprehensive maps of the locations and activity of promoters and enhancers in the Caco-2 cell line. Importantly, many of the responding promoters are uncharacterized and comprise either novel alternative promoters (often to key inflammatory genes) or TSSs of uncharacterized RNAs that in all likelihood are non-coding, which could not have been detected by array-based methods. Therefore, our data are a rich resource for empowering detailed, gene-centred studies in Caco-2.5.

IntroductionGrain amaranths, collectively referring to all the three grain-producing species of Amaranthus under the family Amaranthaceae, are among the most neglected crops in human history. Grain amaranths, A. caudatus, A. cruentus, and A. hypochondriacus, were domesticated for human consumption some 8,000 years ago and were the staple food for the Inca and the Aztec civilizations for thousands of years.1 However, cultivation of grain amaranths remains obscure during modern times following the ban on cultivation. In 1980s, the USA declared grain amaranths ‘the crop of the future’ based on its unique nutritional profile.1–3 The excitement over grain amaranths grew in 1972 when an Australian scientist John Downton reported that the edible cereal-like grains of amaranths display lysine content as high as in milk.1 The importance of this finding is even more crucial considering decades of failed attempts, with existing engineering strategies, to improve the lysine content in rice and wheat because of the inherent inverse correlation between lysine content and yield.4Grain amaranths are among the rare edible dicots that have evolved to use C4 photosynthesis. It is well established that the species with C4 photosynthesis are more efficient during drought and other environmental stress conditions. Considering that all species producing protein-rich edible grains, such as legumes and nuts, use C3 photosynthesis, C4 photosynthesis must be one of the most sought-after phenotypes in edible dicot crops. Now that the genomes of many C3 legumes have been sequenced,5,6 the genome of one of the grain amaranths is likely to aid in the improvement of protein-rich dicot plants using comparative genomics. Besides, it has been shown that even under carbon dioxide-rich conditions, C4 dicot species under the Amaranthaceae family perform better than respective C3 dicots in terms of dry mass,7 making this species a contestant among other plant species as bioenergy resources.Grain amaranths are also important contestants for expanding our narrow food base. Decorating the phylogenetic tree of angiosperms based on the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG) III system of classification with edible plants (Supplementary Data) reveals that all the major clades across the plant kingdom, except Caryophyllales, are loaded with edible crops. The order Caryophyllales (http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~david/flora/flora.html) comprises 70 genera and 800 species8 and is relatively void of edible crops. All the cereals are classified under monocots, the legumes, fruits, and nuts under Rosids, and the staple root crops such as potato and sweet potato under Asterids. Hence, grain amaranths, classified under the order Caryophyllales, offer an attractive alternative for expanding our food base via supplementing protein-rich cereals in the plant-based diet.The species under the order Caryophyllales, including grain amaranths, are also unique from other angiosperms with regard to the synthesis of important secondary metabolites.9 Unlike the use of phenylalanine-derived anthocyanins for use as colouring pigments by most angiosperms, species under Caryophyllales use betalains for the same purpose, which are derived from tyrosine.10,11 Since tyrosine is also the precursor for melanin, the colouring pigment in mammals, the genome of a grain amaranth can, perhaps, also be exploited to develop cosmetics and cure for various skin disorders.12 For example, based on the ethnopharmaceutical survey, one of the plant species used by Rwandese to cure skin discolouration is a species under Caryophyllales, Chenopodium ugandae.12 To this end, more recently, the genome of the first Caryophyllales, Beta vulgaris, has been reported and will aid in expanding our understanding of betalains.13 The genome of one of the grain amaranths, whose flowers are already used as food colouration, will add to the study of enzymes involved in betalain synthesis.Despite the huge potential of grain amaranths with regard to human health and disease, the genome of grain amaranths is yet to be deciphered. A partial transcriptome of A. hypochondriacus, one of the grain amaranths, has been reported, which was generated to understand how species under the Amaranthaceae family respond to environmental stress.14 In another application, limited sequencing of the genome of Amaranthus tuberculatus, a weed variety, has been generated to decipher the mechanism by which this species develops resistance to triple herbicides.15 A more systematic genomic effort on grain amaranths includes creation of BAC libraries for all the three grain species,16 developing microsatellite markers,17 and creating a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based linkage map.18Genomic studies of grain amaranths from the point of view of their unique nutritional profiles and C4 photosynthesis among edible dicots are limited. In various parts of South Asia including Nepal, grain amaranths have been cultivated as staple crops for consumption as an alternative to cereals by the locals.19 Here, we present the draft genome and transcriptome of a landrace that belongs to A. hypochondriacus (Rajgira) obtained from stable lines from the farmers in northern Karnataka, India, to aid in deciphering the genotype behind these important and unique traits from the edible variety.2. Materials and methods2.1. Sample collection for genome and transcriptomeWe obtained the domesticated grains of A. hypochondriacus from farmers in northern Karnataka growing this as a crop for consumption in the name of ‘Rajgira’ or ‘Rajeera’ throughout southern India. We purchased the seeds of other grain species, A. cruentus and A. caudatus, from Park Seeds sold in the names of ‘Autumn's Touch’ and ‘Love-Lies-Bleeding’, respectively. These three types of seeds were grown in campus grounds in three separate lots for taxonomic purposes (Fig. 1). Large numbers of seeds from the first round from each grain species were whitish or pinkish for A. hypochondriacus, whitish for A. cruentus, and reddish for A. caudatus (shown inset in Fig. 1). Amaranthus hypochondriacus produced two types of plants—one with white and the other with red inflorescences. Separating the seeds of white and red varieties of A. hypochondriacus and growing for over two generations retained the inflorescence of the parent plants in the successive generations, thus suggesting purity of lines obtained from farmers. Also, repeated generations produced not only 100% white seeds for the white plants of A. hypochondriacus, but also the plants looked very similar in size, inflorescence, and yield. We have used the tissues from the plants of A. hypochondriacus with white inflorescence after two generations for sequencing both the genome and the transcriptomes reported here.

Taxonomy of AmaranthusAmaranthus is a monoecious plant and the inflorescence is a thyrse with a racemose (catkin) main axis and cymose clusters (cymules) of one male flower and two or more female flowers. Amaranthus hypochondriacus is characterized by its apical erect inflorescence, which is heavily loaded with small edible seeds at maturity. The inflorescence can be bright red or whitish green depending on the presence or absence of betalain pigments in the plant variety (left, Fig. 1). The inflorescence of A. cruentus is also apical but with a Christmas-tree like topology that may gradually turn orange at maturity (middle, Fig. 1). The seeds are comparatively larger in size and the stem more robust than that of the other two species. Amaranthus caudatus produces apical but drooping inflorescences that are red in colour and produce small reddish seeds (right, Fig. 1). The plant is also comparatively fragile unlike the other two grain species.2.3. KaryotypingThe seeds of the plants selected for sequencing were allowed to germinate in water for 24 h. The root tips were incubated at 4°C for 4 h and then fixed using Carnoy's solution. The processed root tips were excised and treated with 1 N HCl for 1 min, followed by treatment with 45% acetic acid for 10 min, staining with 0.2% aceto-orcein along with gentle heat fixing over a spirit lamp, squashing with the thumb, and mounting using 50% glycerol on a microscopic glass slide. The image was captured at 100× magnification under a compound light microscope. As shown in Fig. 2, the number of chromosomes in the selected diploid plant was confirmed to be 32 (n = 16) for sequencing purposes.

Extraction of genomic DNADNA for sequencing was extracted from fresh leaves of 45- to 50-day-old plants using the DNEasy Mini Plant DNA Extraction kit (Qiagen). The quality of the extracted DNA was checked using fluorometry (Qubit, Invitrogen) and by agarose gel electrophoresis.2.5. Extraction of total RNAFor RNA extraction, leaf and stem tissues were collected from a pool of more than 10 individuals, from the plants grown from the same seed collection from which the genome was sequenced, at (i) 15 days, (ii) 25 and (iii) 30 days of age, and from (iv) mature seeds. The leaf and stem tissues, on excision, were immediately cleaned with DEPC-treated water, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80°C until RNA extraction was done. The mature seeds were collected from the inflorescence which was sun-dried, threshed, cleaned, and then stored at room temperature until RNA extraction was done. Total RNA was extracted using the conventional phenol–chloroform extraction method20 as standardized in the laboratory. Quality assessment of the total RNA was done on 1% agarose gel and the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer using high-sensitivity RNA chips.2.6. Library preparationFor genome sequencing, one paired-end (PE; with an insert size of 300 bp) and four mate-pair (MP; with insert sizes of 1.75, 3, 5 and 10 kb) DNA libraries were made using the TruSeq DNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina) by following the manufacturer's low-throughput (LT) protocol. One microgram and 10 µg of the genomic DNA were used for the preparation of the PE and the MP libraries, respectively. DNA molecules were sheared by Covaris S2 according to the manufacturer's instructions and processed as follows.The fragmented DNA molecules were made blunt by performing end repair in End-Repair Mix (containing T4 polynucleotide kinase for 5' phosphorylation, T4 DNA polymerase to fill in the 5' overhangs, and Klenow to remove the 3' overhangs) for 30 min at 30°C, and purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Furthermore, 3' adenylation of the blunt-end DNA was carried out by incubating with A-Tailing Mix (containing a Klenow fragment) at 37°C for 30 min. Ligation of TruSeq adapters was done using DNA Ligase Mix (containing T4 DNA ligase) by incubating at 30°C for 10 min, and the reaction was stopped by adding Stop Ligase Mix. The adenylated DNA was purified using the Agencourt AMPure XP beads as done previously. Library size selection (for an insert size of 300 bp) was done using agarose gel electrophoresis, and the adapter-ligated purified DNA was further enriched by PCR for 10 cycles using adapter complementary primers (P5 and P7) followed by a clean-up using the Agencourt AMPure XP beads. The quality and quantity of the library were estimated by spectrophotometry (NanoDrop, Thermo Scientific) and fluorometry (Qubit, Invitrogen), and the size distribution was analysed on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer using high-sensitivity DNA chips.The fragmented DNA molecules were made blunt by performing end repair in End-Repair Mix for 15 min at 20°C, followed by end labelling for 15 min at 20°C using biotin-dNTP mix and purification using the Agencourt AMPure XP beads. DNA of appropriate size (1.75, 3, 5, and 10 kb) was selected using agarose gel electrophoresis and circularized using Circularization Ligase. Any remaining linear DNA in the circularization step was digested using Exonuclease, and the circular DNA was again sheared using Covaris S2 as done previously. The biotinylated DNA fragments were purified using Dynal magnetic M-280 streptavidin beads as per the manufacturer's guidelines. Again, end repair was performed by incubating the biotinylated DNA fragments (immobilized on the streptavidin beads) in End-Repair Mix for 30 min at 20°C and purified; 3' adenylation was done by incubating the immobilized DNA molecules with A-Tailing Mix at 37°C for 30 min. Ligation of TruSeq adapters was done using DNA Ligase Mix by incubating at 20°C for 15 min and the reaction was stopped by adding Stop Ligase Mix. The biotinylated adapter-ligated immobilized DNA was further enriched by PCR for 18 cycles using adapter complementary primers followed by a clean-up using the Agencourt AMPure XP beads. The quality and quantity of the library were estimated by spectrophotometry (NanoDrop, Thermo Scientific) and fluorometry (Qubit, Invitrogen), and the size distribution was analysed on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer using high-sensitivity DNA chips.Transcriptome libraries of 155 bp were prepared using the TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina) following the manufacturer's LT protocol. Two micrograms of total RNA were subjected to mRNA selection using poly-T oligo-attached magnetic beads using two rounds of purification. The selected poly-A RNA was subjected to fragmentation to sizes between 100 and 300 nt by incubating in fragmentation mix for 8 min at 94°C. First-strand cDNA was synthesized by adding 1 µl of Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) to solution containing primed RNA and first-strand master mix followed by incubation at 25°C for 10 min, 42°C for 50 min, and 70°C for 15 min. The complementary second-strand cDNA was synthesized by incubating first-strand cDNA in second-strand master mix at 16°C for 60 min. End repair was performed to remove the 3' overhangs and fill the 5' overhangs by incubating the DNA in End-Repair Mix containing T4 polynucleotide kinase, T4 DNA polymerase, and a large (Klenow) fragment of DNA polymerase I for 30 min at 30°C, and purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. A-tailing of DNA was performed at 37°C for 30 min with the Klenow fragment followed by ligation of TruSeq adaptors using T4 DNA ligase by incubating at 30°C for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by adding stop-ligase mix and purified by using Agencourt AMPure XP beads. Adaptor-ligated DNA was then subjected to PCR enrichment with adaptor complementary primers for 15 cycles followed by clean-up using Agencourt AMPure XP beads. The quality and quantity of the library were estimated by NanoDrop and fluorometry (Qubit, Invitrogen), and the size distribution was analysed on the Agilent Bioanalyzer using high-sensitivity DNA chips.2.7 Quantification of prepared library and sequencingThe libraries were quantified using SYBR-Green-based qPCR reagents (Kapa Biosystems). The qPCR results were compared with the predetermined concentration of the PhiX library. Eight picomolar of all the DNA libraries were used for cluster generation in cBot (Illumina). Also, 8 pM of the four RNA libraries prepared were pooled in equimolar ratio and seeded on four lanes of the flow cell for cluster generation. All the libraries were sequenced on Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx following the manufacturer's standard protocols. PE genomic reads of length 75 bases, MP genomic reads of length 36 bases, and PE transcriptomic reads of length 72 bases were generated.2.8. AssemblyThe reads were analysed for their quality and all those with >75% of bases with phred scores of =20 and <15 Ns were considered to be of high quality.After testing for quality, the reads were assembled using SOAPdenovo (SOAPdenovo31mer version 1.05).21 Assembly was performed in two stages in a high configuration system with 96 GB RAM. First, 465,246,312 PE reads of 72-mers were assembled using default parameters and a k-mer size of 31. In the other set, using the same parameters, all the reads totalling 869,113,408 both from PE and MP libraries were assembled. The resulting scaffolds were subject to various analyses such as synteny, heterozygosity, Gene Ontology (GO) annotation, repeat analysis, duplication study, and proteome prediction, using available tools and scripts developed in-house.Transcriptomic reads with the seed accession ID of IC 38040 (PI 480569) were downloaded from NCBI-SRA (SRX055331) and assembled into contigs using MIRA.22The high-quality reads from various tissues were pooled together and used as a set with Trinity (Release 16 February 2013) for assembly.23 Trinity, a de novo transcriptome assembler, uses a fixed k-mer length of 25 and it was run on a high configuration system with 48 GB RAM to generate trinity components.2.9. Filtering criteriaThe coverage of the scaffolds was measured by aligning the genomic scaffolds of A. hypochondriacus with various public sequencing data. All comparisons with the same species were done at the DNA level (blastn) and with other species at the amino acid levels (tblastn or tblastx).24 A filtering criterion of >99% over a contiguous stretch of >100 bases is used to establish identity with sequences from the same species, and a filtering criterion of 60% match over a contiguous stretch of 35 or more amino acids is used to establish the orthology of genes with other plant species such as Arabidopsis thaliana, Vitis vinifera, and Solanum lycopersicum.2.10. Synteny analysesAll the synteny analyses were performed using SyMap25 and in-house perl scripts.2.11. Heterozygosity analysisFrequency of mutation in the genomic scaffolds was estimated by piling up the genomic reads to the scaffolds using Bowtie26 and SAMtools27 and counting the number of reads with an alternate base (minor allele) from that present in the reference. For the study, positions with depth between 10X and 315X (three times the read coverage) and minor allele frequency of 0.3 or more were considered. Also, the k-mer spectra of the sequenced genome and transcriptome were generated from the high-quality sequence reads using SOAPdenovo. The k-mer size was selected as 31 for the purpose as well as for the assembly of the genomic reads. The k-mer count with a very low frequency of 1 and 2 was removed.2.12. GO annotationThe GO annotation for all the A. thaliana genes with orthology to other species was compared using the ‘GO annotation search, functional categorization and download’ tool available at TAIR.28 The percentage of A. thaliana genes within each GO category that are orthologous to scaffolds in the draft genomes of V. vinifera, S. lycopersicum, and A. hypochondriacus is computed as a percentage of the total number of A. thaliana proteins within the respective category for that species. The percentage of genes within each category reported by GO analysis for each species is normalized with respect to that of A. thaliana to estimate the number of genes deciphered within each GO category for the three species compared.2.13. Proteome predictionAb initio gene predictions were done on the genomic scaffolds using GENSCAN,29 AUGUSTUS,30 and GeneMark,31 with the smallest predicted sequence being 100 nucleotides long. These predicted sequences were annotated using BLAST against plant protein databases. Extrinsic prediction from genomic scaffolds and transcripts was also done using BLAST against plant proteomes downloaded from PlantGDB32 including UniProt, mRNA, and HTC databases.2.14. Repeat analysisWe have used both extrinsic and ab initio methods to assess the extent of repeat elements in A. hypochondriacus, compared with selected plant species. For extrinsic analysis, we have used Repbase33 using A. thaliana repeats as templates. For the de novo method, we have used RepeatScout34 and RepeatModeler35 to predict novel repeats from the genomic scaffolds and masked the genome with the respective repeat element using RepeatMasker.36,372.15. Duplication eventProtein-level homology was studied between paralogous pairs in several species belonging to different plant orders including A. thaliana, Glycine max, and V. vinifera from Rosids, S. lycopersicum from Asterids, A. hypochondriacus and B. vulgaris (USDA version) from Caryophyllales, and Oryza sativa, Sorghum bicolor, and Zea mays from the monocots. The proteomes for A. thaliana, G. max, V. vinifera, S. lycopersicum, O. sativa, S. bicolor, and Z. mays were downloaded from public repositories (TAIR28 and PGDD38), whereas those for A. hypochondriacus and B. vulgaris were predicted ab initio using Genscan from genomic scaffolds. Also, the GENSCAN-predicted proteome of S. lycopersicum was used as control to negate any possibility of bias in the result due to the gene prediction tool used for A. hypochondriacus and B. vulgaris. Furthermore, frequency polygons and kernel density plots of percentage identities of significant hits (those that were not self-hits or isoforms with 100 percent identity, and where the alignment covered at least 80% of the query or the subject sequence, whichever was longer) were plotted using R.392.16. Phylogenetic treeAmino acid sequences of aspartate kinase (AK) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) genes available at GenBank for plants of interest were collected. Sequences for the remaining species for which genomic scaffolds were available were extracted from the results of BLAST24 against the sequence from A. thaliana or from the closest taxon for which the sequence was available.Multiple sequence alignment was carried out using MUSCLE,40 present as an application in MEGA5, using the default parameters. The evolutionary history was inferred using the Neighbor-Joining method.41 The bootstrap consensus tree inferred from 1,000 replicates is taken to represent the evolutionary history of the taxa analysed.42 Branches corresponding to partitions reproduced in <50% bootstrap replicates are collapsed. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Poisson correction method in the units of the number of amino acid substitutions per site.43 The analyses involved 25 AK and 75 PEPC sequences. Positions in the alignment containing gaps and missing data were eliminated to get a contiguous stretch of aligned sequences. There were a total of 229 and 278 positions in the final dataset for AK and PEPC proteins, respectively. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA5.44 The phylogenetic trees were visualized using iTOL.45,462.17. Gene expression profilingRNA-seq reads from each sample were mapped using bowtie to the full-length cDNA obtained for all the enzymes in the lysine biosynthesis pathway by virtual splicing from genomic scaffolds and transcriptome. The read counts were converted to reads per kilo base of exons per million reads mapped (RPKM) to normalize the measurement across samples.3. Results and discussion3.1. Coverage by sequencing, assembly, and mappingThe species A. hypochondriacus (Rajgira), grown in northern Karnataka, India, was selected for sequencing. Following plant selection and genomic DNA extraction, five PE libraries of 300 bp and four MP libraries with insert sizes ranging from 1.5 to 10 kb were created. A total of 869,113,408 high-quality reads including 465,246,312 75-mers from PE and 403,867,096 36-mers from MP libraries were sequenced to produce a total of 49.4 billion bases, thus providing a coverage of 106-fold over the estimated genome size of 466 million bases.16 Also, we have generated 8.6 billion bases of transcriptome from three stages of shoot development and from mature seeds.Table 1 includes the statistics from the assembly of genomic reads into scaffolds. The total ATGC content, without Ns, within the assembled scaffolds is 273 million bases. Addition of MP reads improved the size of the largest scaffold by 20 folds to 485,353 from 24,878 bases and scaffold N50 to 35,089 from contig N50 of 1,884. The genome of A. hypochondriacus was found to be AT-rich with 66% AT content (Supplementary Data), which compares with the genomes of other plants.47 Figure 3 shows the uniform coverage of the 16 chromosomes by genomic scaffolds, which harbour 355 (86%) SNPs of the 411 linkage SNPs reported for grain amaranths.18Table 1.Summary of statistics of genome and transcriptome assemblyAssembled ‘ome

The transcriptome is also AT-rich like that of other plant transcriptomes.48 The total number of non-redundant bases resulting from assembly is 47 million bases without any intervening Ns, which would suggest that 10% of the A. hypochondriacus genome is transcribed in the tissues sequenced. Also, 74% of raw transcript reads map onto the genomic scaffolds, which is much more than what can be expected based on the ATGC content of the assembled genomic scaffolds which comprise 58% of the genome.The genomic scaffolds reported here were also compared with a publicly available transcriptome sequence (SRX055331) with the seed accession of IC 38040/PI 480569 (India 38040) generated using 454 platform by another independent effort.14 Despite the fact that India 38040 has a reddish stem and drooping inflorescence (personal communication), we find significant homology between the edible white variety sequenced here and India 38040. For example, of the total 6,222,321 non-redundant bases in the assembled transcriptome from India 38040, 5,185,660 bases (83.34%) aligned to the genomic scaffolds with identities greater than 99% over a contiguous stretch greater than 100 bases.3.2. Quality assessment and synteny of genomic scaffolds with B. vulgarisThe recently reported genome of B. vulgaris is the only reported genome of a member of the Caryophyllales plant order,13 which is used here to both assess the level of synteny between the two species and to assess the quality of the scaffolds reported here. All the 4,897 scaffolds above the N50 of 35,089 bases, constituting 322.6 Mb (69% including Ns in the scaffolds) of the A. hypochondriacus genome, find synteny for collinear blocks adding up to 85 Mb with the genome of B. vulgaris. As shown in Fig. 4, among the top 100 scaffolds (greater than 161,660 bases), 60% finds unique synteny with the genome of B. vulgaris compared with only 4% with A. thaliana. Sixty-nine of the top 100 scaffolds have collinear blocks syntenic to unique loci on B. vulgaris chromosomes, whereas 7 scaffolds show synteny, which is split over two different chromosomes of B. vulgaris. Twenty-four scaffolds that find no synteny with B. vulgaris are not necessarily from a gene-less region, but contain predicted genes most represented in GO category under ‘other cellular processes’ and ‘other metabolic processes’. These predicted genes may be present in B. vulgaris, but may have diverged significantly beyond the filtering criteria used for synteny analysis.

to A. thaliana proteomeAn amino acid level comparison of A. thaliana proteome49 against genomic scaffolds of A. hypochondriacus shows that 60.11% of A. thaliana proteins find orthology within the genomic scaffolds using the filter mentioned in the Materials and Methods section. Similar efforts with the scaffolds of two other species, V. vinifera50 and S. lycopersicum,51 finds comparable, 17,311 (63%) and 16,538 (60.32%), respectively, orthology to the A. thaliana proteome. Also, as shown in Fig. 5, the orthology of 14,590 A. thaliana genes common to the genomic scaffolds of V. vinifera, S. lycopersicum, and A. hypochondriacus suggests that functions of these genes are common to all dicots. A GO annotation of the A. thaliana orthologs in V. vinifera, S. lycopersicum, and A. hypochondriacus scaffolds shows that more than 80% of the genes annotated under each GO category in A. hypochondriacus has been deciphered (Fig. 6), and that the coverage of A. hypochondriacus genes within each category is comparable to the other two reported genomes of V. vinifera and S. lycopersicum.

Genomic features of A. hypochondriacusThe mRNA reads from transcriptome sequencing efforts were assembled into transcripts with an N50 of 3,279 containing 15,179 transcripts above the median. Both extrinsic and ab initio methods were chosen for predicting the number of genes coded by A. hypochondriacus from both 57,658 assembled transcripts and 367,441 genomic scaffolds. For extrinsic prediction, we have used plant proteome databases including UniProt, HTC, and plant mRNA at plantGDB. For ab initio prediction of genes from the genomic scaffolds, we have used gene prediction tools including GENSCAN with 36,487, Augustus with 28,662, and GeneMark with 63,044 predicted genes. From the assembled transcriptome of A. hypochondriacus, the total number of potential proteins is estimated at 21,650 genes with either evidence of homology in the plant proteome database and/or evidence of gene prediction from the genomic scaffolds. An additional 3,179 potential proteins were added from genomic scaffolds, which were missed by gene prediction methods and not represented in the transcriptome, but show homology to the plant proteome database, thus making the total number of estimated proteins coded by A. hypochondriacus genome 24,829. This compares with the 27,421 proteins predicted for B. vulgaris, the other sequenced member of Caryophyllales.13Mapping of raw genomic reads onto the assembled scaffolds revealed ~1 SNP per 1,000 bases based on 282,692 SNPs out of 260 Mb base positions scanned. This indicates that the genome of A. hypochondriacus is relatively more homozygous than other sequenced plants. For example, the frequency of SNPs in Malus domestica, O. sativa, Z. mays, V. vinifera, and Fragaria vesca is 1 in 288 bases, 1 in 268 bases, 1 in 124 bases, 1 in 100 bases, and 1 in 15 bases, respectively.52–56 The k-mer spectrum of the genome (not shown) also gives a unimodal curve, supporting the high level of homozygosity within the assembled part of the genome.57Characterizing the repeat elements in the A. hypochondriacus genome is challenged by the fact that repeats from species under the plant order Caryophyllales is missing in major repeat databases such as RepBase. Masking the draft genomes of a number of species including an unpublished draft of B. vulgaris using A. thaliana repeats as templates reveals that the A. hypochondriacus genome contains a relatively low percentage of repeat elements (Table 2). Also, masking the draft genomes of several species using the predicted repeats from the respective genomes using RepeatScout reveals 7.47% of repeats in the A. hypochondriacus genome, compared with 69.86% in B. vulgaris (USDA version, unpublished), 68.34% in S. lycopersicum, 55.02% in V. vinifera, 18.43% in A. thaliana, 68.67% in S. bicolor, and 47.69% in O. sativa (Table 2). A more rigorous prediction of repeats using RepeatModeler masked 13.76% of the A. hypochondriacus genome, still far below the 63% for B. vulgaris using RepeatModeler reported recently.13 Based on the number of proteins predicted for the genome and the success achieved in splicing full-length cDNA for a majority of genes from select biochemical pathways, we rule out the possibility that the low percentage of repeats in the A. hypochondriacus genome could stem from a fragmented assembly. Comparative repeat element analysis using both A. thaliana repeats and predicted repeatsThe species used for comparison are—Ah: A. hypochondriacus; Bv: B. vulgaris (USDA version); Sla: Silene latifolia;58 Sl: S. lycopersicum; Vv: V. vinifera; At: A. thaliana; Sb: S. bicolor; Os: O. sativa.Comparative repeat element analysis using both A. thaliana repeats and predicted repeatsThe species used for comparison are—Ah: A. hypochondriacus; Bv: B. vulgaris (USDA version); Sla: Silene latifolia;58 Sl: S. lycopersicum; Vv: V. vinifera; At: A. thaliana; Sb: S. bicolor; Os: O. sativa.Estimation of 24,829 proteins provided an opportunity to look for any sign of recent whole genome duplication using a method reported by Axelsen et al.59 Figure 7 shows the comparison of proteomes of various species to find levels of divergence among paralogs. The peak near 90% for Z. mays, A. thaliana, and G. max confirms the recent whole genome duplication events reported for these species.60Amaranthus hypochondriacus and B. vulgaris, both species classified under the order Caryophyllales, lack the peak near 90% similar to V. vinifera, suggesting no recent whole genome duplication event in A. hypochondriacus and B. vulgaris. The peak near 30 for all dicot species represent a paleohexaploidy event common to all dicots,50 including the two species of Caryophyllales studied here. Based on this analysis, we have redrawn the place for A. hypochondriacus in Fig. 8, which is reproduced with permission from the authors.61Figure 7.Open in new tabDownload slideA genome duplication study in A. thaliana, G. max, V. vinifera, S. lycopersicum, A. hypochondriacus, B. vulgaris, O. sativa, S. bicolor, and Z. mays by comparison of the distribution of percentage identities among paralogous pairs from the respective proteomes.

Similar overestimation has been reported for the V. vinifera genome, which is attributed to 11% hemizygosity.55 Since, in genomes with a significant percentage of hemizygosity, the coverage of the homozygous regions can be expected to be two times compared with the hemizygous regions, assembly tools are likely to be more biased towards the homozygous regions, thus providing the basis for high coverage of coding regions.3.5. C4 evolutionIt is now well established that PEPC (EC 4.1.1.31) is the key enzyme in the C4 pathway.62 Thus, comparative analysis of PEPC genes across plant kingdom, including C3 and C4 plants, has been attempted by many groups.63,64 There are multiple PEPC isoenzymes in all plant species including C3 plants. Work by various groups has shown that the C4-specific PEPC gene harbours a serine in place of alanine at position 780 of maize PEPC gene with accession CAA33317 (A780S) among both dicots and monocots.65 For example, one of the four sorghum PEPC genes harbours this mutation.We have identified full-length cDNA sequences for all the four PEPC isoenzymes from the genome of A. hypochondriacus with only one harbouring the A780S mutation. In order to check if all PEPC genes across various species harbouring A780S mutation result from divergent or convergent evolution, we have created a phylogenetic tree using the multiple sequence alignment of all the PEPC isoenzymes from representative species under various major plant orders including many C3 and C4 from both dicots and monocots (Fig. 9). All PEPC isoenzymes harbouring the A780S mutation, among monocot species, cluster together, suggesting C4 evolution predating speciation in monocots. However, the PEPC gene harbouring the A780S mutation in C4 dicots (represented by A. hypochondriacus and Mollugo cerviana from Caryophyllales and Flaveria trinervia from Asterids), clusters in distal clades. Based on this observation, there can be two hypotheses: (i) the C4-specific mutation occurred independently under Asterid and Caryophyllales; (ii) all C3 dicot plants have selectively lost an ancestral C4-specific isoform during the course of evolution. The first hypothesis has been reported in the literature65 and our observation supports the same. In other words, C4 switch in dicots is a convergent evolution.65 For the second hypothesis to be true, one would need to show that at least one C3 dicot plant continues to retain a C4-specific PEPC gene.

in the lysine biosynthetic pathwayIn plants, the aspartate family pathway is responsible for the biosynthesis of four amino acids—threonine, isoleucine, methionine, and lysine.66 Based on the lysine biosynthetic pathway in KEGG,67,68 here are a total of seven enzymatic steps in the synthesis of l-lysine starting from l-aspartate, of which the first two steps are shared for all four amino acids before the lysine biosynthesis pathway diverges. The number of isoenzymes encoded by A. hypochondriacus for all the seven enzymatic steps in the aspartate pathway of lysine biosynthesis has been identified and is listed in Table 3 for comparison with those in other plant species. Isozyme number polymorphism in A. hypochondriacus compared with other speciesThe enzymes listed in the table are: AK: monofunctional aspartate kinase; ASD: aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase; DHDPS: dihydrodipicolinate synthase; DHDPR: dihydrodipicolinate reductase; DAPAT: diaminopimelate aminotransferase; DAPE: diaminopimelate epimerase; DAPDC: diaminopimelate decarboxylase.Isozyme number polymorphism in A. hypochondriacus compared with other speciesThe enzymes listed in the table are: AK: monofunctional aspartate kinase; ASD: aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase; DHDPS: dihydrodipicolinate synthase; DHDPR: dihydrodipicolinate reductase; DAPAT: diaminopimelate aminotransferase; DAPE: diaminopimelate epimerase; DAPDC: diaminopimelate decarboxylase.It is known that both in prokaryotes and photosynthetic eukaryotes, lysine biosynthesis is mainly regulated by two allosteric enzymes.69 These are (i) monofunctional AK (EC 2.7.2.4), the first and the critical enzyme in the aspartate family pathway, and (ii) dihydrodipicolinate synthase (DHDPS, EC 4.3.3.7), the first enzyme towards lysine biosynthesis within the aspartate pathway. Given this, polymorphisms of any kind within these two gene loci can be expected to have a high likelihood of correlating with the high-lysine phenotype in grain amaranth.There are varying numbers of monofunctional AK isoenzymes with varying lysine sensitivity in plants. For example, AK1, AK2, and AK3 genes of A. thaliana vary significantly in their affinity to lysine, with AK1 being the least sensitive.69 In this context, it is of interest to know if the lysine sensitivity of the only monofunctional AK gene of A. hypochondriacus compares with AK1 or the other two enzymes of A. thaliana. Phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 10) using the multiple sequence alignment of protein sequences of AK gene paralogs from diverse species, clusters the AK gene of A. hypochondriacus in the same clade as the AK1 gene of A. thaliana, suggesting that the AK gene of A. hypochondriacus is similar in lysine sensitivity to the AK1 gene. Loss of orthologs of the two lysine-sensitive AK2 and AK3 genes in A. hypochondriacus may be one of the reasons for the high-lysine phenotype in A. hypochondriacus, thus providing a testable hypothesis.

Profiling gene expression levels from transcriptome sequencing for three stages of shoot development and mature seeds, we observe that the expression levels of both DHDPS isoenzymes decrease with developmental stages of the shoot and significantly spike up in the seeds (Table 4). The high levels of expression of DHDPS isoenzymes in seeds suggest yet another hypothesis for producing high-lysine grains in grain amaranths. Expression level of genes implicated in the lysine biosynthetic pathway in the shoot at three stages of development and in mature seedsExpression level of genes implicated in the lysine biosynthetic pathway in the shoot at three stages of development and in mature seedsTo correlate the observed gene number polymorphism for AK genes and eQTL of the DHDPS gene, we have generated horizontal and vertical profiles of free lysine across the different developmental stages of all three grain species using ultra-fast liquid chromatography. The study reveals that the free lysine content in seeds of the genus is relatively higher than that in the shoot (0.152 µmol/100 mg in 25-day-old shoot and 0.189 µmol/100 mg in mature seeds). The free lysine content analysis correlates with the expression levels of the DHDPS gene, suggesting eQTL for the high-lysine phenotype. However, the expression profiles of all the other enzymes including AK shows no correlation with high-lysine content in seeds compared with the shoot. Perhaps, the absence of orthologs of the two lysine-sensitive AK genes in A. hypochondriacus may be sufficient for high-lysine phenotype.4. ConclusionWe have reported the draft genome of the first grain species under the plant order Caryophyllales and the first C4 dicot to be sequenced. Using the reported SNPs derived from homozygous regions of grain amaranths,18 we conclude that as high as 86% of the homozygous gene-rich region has been deciphered. Similarly, annotation of the genome using various criteria, including transcriptome mapping, gene prediction, and GO annotation, vindicates the conclusion. Also, based on the high level of synteny to the genome of B. vulgaris, we authenticate the quality of the reported scaffolds. We also confirm that the paleohexaploidy event reported to be common to all sequenced dicot species under Rosids and Asterids is also common to Caryophyllales. We have corroborated that the C4 evolution under Caryophyllales has occurred independently of other C4 dicots, for example, F. trinervia under Asterid. Also, we have proposed two testable hypotheses for the high-lysine phenotype including gene number polymorphism for the AK gene and eQTL for DHDPS. We have demonstrated that the draft genome reported here can be useful in advancing our understanding of the diverse phenotypes that are unique to grain amaranths including the unique nutritional profile, aggressive growth, drought resistance and adaptability to environmental stress and characterize genes involved in the biosynthesis of betalains.4.1.

IntroductionSince the emergence of life on Earth, deoxyribonucleic acid, the carrier of genetic information, has been continuously exposed to various types of damaging factors, including internally generated reactive oxygen species (ROS), and several external factors, such as ionizing radiation, UV radiation, ROS, and other reactive molecules.1 Unrepaired DNA lesions cause mutations, which can lead to undesirable cell death, carcinogenesis, or age-related pathophysiology.2 Living organisms have various DNA repair systems to counteract these threats and to deal with errors in the DNA replication process. Thus, DNA repair systems are essential for all organisms, from bacteria to higher eukaryotes; most of these systems have been evolutionarily conserved.3,4Because life evolved to use highly reactive molecular oxygen for energy production under aerobic conditions, ROS is one of the major factors involved in the generation of DNA lesions. Among oxidative DNA lesions, with more than 100 types of modifications identified in mammals, 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG; also known as its tautomer 8-hydroxyguanine) is the most abundant and well-characterized base modification.5,6 It has been shown that, under normal conditions, there is one 8-oxoG molecule per 105–106 guanines in a genome, corresponding to thousands of 8-oxoG molecules per single cell.7,8Genomic 8-oxoG can be formed in two ways; direct oxidation of a guanine residue in a genomic sequence or oxidation at the nucleotide pool levels, i.e. the formation of 8-oxo-dGTP followed by its incorporation during DNA synthesis.9,10 If a guanine residue in the genome is oxidized to 8-oxoG and the strand is used as a template in replication, an adenine residue is often incorporated in the daughter strand as the complementary nucleotide. This is because not only cytosine but also adenine can pair with 8-oxoG. As a consequence, G <U+2192> T transversion mutation is frequently observed at the position of 8-oxoG modification.9 During replication, the oxidized nucleotide, 8-oxo-dGTP, may be incorporated into the complementary strand to pair with an adenine residue; in the next round of replication, cytosine may be inserted complementary to 8-oxoG. This would result in an A <U+2192> C transversion mutation.11 It has been reported that G <U+2192> T somatic mutation is mostly observed in oxidative stress-associated tumours such as lung, breast, ovarian, gastric, and colon cancers.12,13 It has also been reported that 8-oxoG modifications are associated with other diseases such as neurodegenerative and ageing-associated disorders.14–17There are several methods to measure 8-oxoG contents in genomes. The total 8-oxoG has been quantified using the HPLC–ECD (electrochemical detection) system,18 and specific regions of several hundred bases have been analysed by ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction (LM-PCR).19,20 There are also some reports of 8-oxoG measurements in entire genomes using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH-based)21 and DNA immunoprecipitation (IP) methods,22 although the obtained resolution of 8-oxoG along with the chromosomes by these methods is tens of Mb.No detailed analysis of genome-wide distribution of DNA damages is available thus far.23 To examine the distribution of 8-oxoG modifications and identify susceptible regions in the genome with high resolution, we conducted array-based comprehensive profiling. The resulting 8-oxoG profile revealed that there is a clear negative correlation between 8-oxoG distribution and gene density. The negative correlation can be attributed to spatial positioning of chromosomes, so-called chromosome territory (CT)24 in the nucleus, where gene deserts tend to be located at perinucleic regions. Our results can be explained by the fact that perinucleic regions are more accessible to the external ROS than the regions close to the centre of the nucleus. Another possible explanation is that the chromosomes at perinucleic regions tend to be in compact conformations, preventing the recruitment of the 8-oxoG repair components.2. Materials and methods2.1. SamplesMale Wistar rats (specific pathogen-free; SPF), obtained from Japan SLC, Inc. (Shizuoka, Japan), were maintained in an SPF environment. The rats were sacrificed at 5 weeks of age, and the kidneys were harvested. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of Kyoto University and Nagoya University approved all the animal experimentation protocols. The experiments were performed with two biological replicates.2.2. Genomic DNA extraction and 8-oxoG immunoprecipitationFresh rat kidneys were frozen at -80°C, and 100 mg of the tissue was homogenized in 1.0 ml of homogenization buffer (0.15 M NaCl, 0.1 M EDTA; pH 8.0) with 0.1 mM desferal using a glass homogenizer on ice. Genomic DNA was extracted using the NaI method (Wako, Osaka, Japan); the solution was saturated with argon gas and contained 0.1 mM desferal to prevent further DNA oxidation. The DNA was digested with BmgT120I (G^GNCC) (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan) at 37°C for 90 min. Fragment sizes were established by agarose gel electrophoresis (1.5% w/v agarose). The average size of the fragments was 500 bp.The digested DNA samples were subjected to IP; 5 µg aliquots of DNA fragments were immunoprecipitated by adding 10 µg of 8-oxoG-specific monoclonal antibody, N45.1, purchased from Japan Institute for the Control of Aging (Shizuoka, Japan). The specificity of the antibody against the DNA fragments containing 8-oxoG was already validated by quantitative PCR analysis.22,25 IP was performed in 900 µl of the reaction buffer (0.1% bovine serum albumin, 10 mM phosphate buffer; pH 7.4), with stirring at 4 r.p.m. for 3 h at 4°C. Subsequently, 100 µl of Dynabeads (M-280 sheep anti-mouse IgG) (Dynal, Oslo, Norway) was added to the mixture (final volume, 1000 µl) and mixed at 4 r.p.m. for 5 h at 4°C. The Dynabeads complex was washed twice in the following three buffers: buffer 1: 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM HEPES–KOH, 140 mM NaCl (pH 7.5); buffer 2: 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM HEPES–KOH, 500 mM NaCl (pH 7.5); and buffer 3: 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM EDTA, 250 mM LiCl, 10 mM Tris–HCl, (pH 8.0). The immunoprecipitated beads were eluted from the Dynabeads complex with 80 µl of elution buffer (10 mM EDTA, 1% sodium dodecyl sulphate, 50 mM Tris–HCl; pH 8.0) at 65°C for 10 min.2.3. MicroarrayFor two-colour microarray, the test immunoprecipitated DNA fragments and 10 ng of input (control) DNA fragments (only digested by BmgT120I, without IP by N45.1 monoclonal antibody) were treated with proteinase K at 37°C for 1 h, followed by phenol–chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The following oligonucleotides were used as adaptor DNA: 5'-GNCTGCGGTGA-3' and 5'-AGCACTCTCCAGCCTCTCACCGCA-3'; complementary sequences are underlined. Ligations of the adaptor to the test and input DNA were performed using Ligation Pack (Nippon Gene, Toyama, Japan), following the standard protocol. The fragments with the adaptor were amplified with two PCR cycles.The test and input DNA (800 ng per sample) were labelled with Cy5 and Cy3, respectively, using the standard protocol for Agilent DNA Labeling Kit (Agilent Technologies), and the mixed samples were applied to the Rat Genome CGH Microarray Kit 244A (Agilent Technologies), following the manufacturer's instructions. The arrays were scanned using the Agilent DNA Microarray Scanner G2505B (Agilent Technologies). The scanned data were subjected to image analysis using Agilent's Feature Extraction Software (v10.5.1.1; Agilent Technologies) with the default parameters. Two biologically replicated microarray experiments were performed.2.4. Genome sequence data, annotations, and other publicly available dataThe rat genome sequence data (assembly November 2004; rn4)26 and the associated annotation data were downloaded from the UCSC Genome Browser.27To draw the distribution of 8-oxoG along chromosomes, we applied a smoothing method for each probe by calculating the averaged 8-oxoG level for all the probes in 500 kb in both directions.To compare the distribution of 8-oxoG with gene expression data previously generated using microarrays (GSE7625),28 gene expression data for normal rat kidney (GSM184440 and GSM184441) were downloaded from GEO database at NCBI.29 The raw data were normalized using MAS5 package in Bioconductor/R.30 Subsequently, the normalized values were log2-transformed for both biological replicates.The data for lamina-associated domains (LADs) and the DNA adenine methyltransferase identification (DamID) profiles of lamin B1 in mouse embryonic fibroblast31 were downloaded from UCSC Genome Browser.27 To compare these data with our 8-oxoG profile data for the rat, we converted the genomic coordinates using the liftOver program provided by UCSC Genome Browser.27 We set the -minBlocks option to 0.1 to reduce unconverted regions.We used the custom track function of UCSC Genome Browser to visually examine the distribution of properties along the chromosomes. For detailed analysis and high-quality image generation over a wide range, we wrote graph-drawing programs in Perl, PostScript, and gnuplot.2.5. Statistical analysisWe used the R package to draw boxplots, histograms, and contour plots. The R package was also used to calculate P-values for Student's t-tests.3. Results3.1. Genome-wide distribution of 8-oxoGTo obtain a complete distribution of 8-oxoG in normal rat kidney chromosomes, we performed DNA immunoprecipitation (IP) followed by microarray analysis using input (control) DNA fragments without IP as a reference (Fig. 1; for details, see the Materials and Methods section).

DNA obtained without immunoprecipitation was used as an input (control). Immunoprecipitated DNA and input DNA fragments were labelled with Cy5 and Cy3 dyes, respectively, and applied to the microarrays.To analyse the distribution of 8-oxoG, we plotted the signal of each probe of the microarray in the rat chromosomes. There are ~244,000 probes (60-mer in length) on the microarray used in this study (Agilent Rat Genome CGH Microarray Kit 244A), corresponding to the average probe interval of 1 in 6,000 bases. The averaged 8-oxoG levels are plotted along the chromosomes and shown together with the ideogram in Figure 2. The plot reveals that the regions with high 8-oxoG level are not uniformly distributed; their size fluctuates around several Mb, with some 8-oxoG-rich regions larger than 10 Mb. For example, there is a broad peak spanning more than 10 Mb in the position of 50–60 Mb in chr14. However, there are also some 8-oxoG-depleted regions. We did not observe any clear correlation between the 8-oxoG levels and ideogram-banding patterns. The average probe interval of the microarray that we used in this experiment is 6,000 bases, while the 8-oxoG levels fluctuate with intervals of several Mb. This indicates that the probe density is high enough to depict the 8-oxoG profile along chromosomes. Figure 2.Open in new tabDownload slideDistribution of 8-oxoG along the chromosomes.

To achieve this, we divided the chromosomes into non-overlapping 1 Mb fragments, and counted the genes and averaged log2(IP/input) value of 8-oxoG for each fragment (Fig. 4). The box plot clearly shows that 8-oxoG levels increase with the decrease in the number of genes in a fragment (Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) = -0.47, P < 0.001), particularly for fragments with less than three genes. For the fragments without any genes (627 fragments), the median of averaged log2(IP/input) value of 8-oxoG is 0.39, while for the fragments with three genes (255 fragments), the averaged log2(IP/input) value for 8-oxoG level is -0.11. There are no clear differences between the values for 8-oxoG levels for the fragments with eight or more genes. This shows that the fragments with two or fewer genes tend to have more 8-oxoG than the fragments with three or more genes, confirming that the observed negative relationship between the profile for 8-oxoG levels and gene density was true on the genome-wide scale. In general, the GC content in gene deserts are lower than that in gene-rich regions, indicating that higher 8-oxoG levels in gene deserts are not simply due to biased base composition.

Chromosomes were divided into 1 Mb of non-overlapping regions, and the number of genes and averaged 8-oxoG levels were calculated for each region.This trend can be partially validated by the independent data obtained in our previous study.22 By analysing these data, we have observed that the chromosomes with high 8-oxoG levels have low gene density, while those with high gene density have relatively low 8-oxoG levels. The data from that study were of low resolution compared with the results obtained in the present study. However, the fact that a negative correlation between 8-oxoG levels and gene density has been found in two independent studies gives more weight to our conclusions.3.3. Lack of significant association between 8-oxoG levels and transcriptional activityTo analyse the negative correlation between 8-oxoG distribution and gene density, we examined the gene expression levels to establish whether the 8-oxoG levels in genic regions associates with transcriptional activity of the genes.We used the gene expression data from microarray experiments in our previous study, which were performed on matched samples (GSM184440 and GSM184441).28 On the basis of the distribution of gene expression levels, we calculated the median expression value and used this value to divide the genes into two groups, i.e. those with high and low expression. For each gene, we calculated the averaged 8-oxoG level using log2(IP/input) values of the probes located within genic region, i.e. from the transcription start to end site. The values were subsequently used to draw histograms (Supplementary Data). The two distributions were almost identical; we did not observe any statistically significant differences (Student's t-test; P = 0.043), indicating that the 8-oxoG levels in genic regions do not associate with transcriptional activity of the genes. We also applied the same statistical test to the gene sets with extreme expression levels, i.e. (i) genes with top 25% and bottom 25% expression levels and (ii) genes with top 10% and bottom 10% expression levels, and compared the distributions of 8-oxoG levels between these groups of genes with the extreme expression. The former set (top/bottom 25%) gives P = 0.100 and the latter set (top/bottom 10%) gives P = 0.101, further confirming that the 8-oxoG levels in genic regions does not associate with transcriptional activity of the genes.3.4. Association between 8-oxoG levels and structural features of chromosomes in the nucleusIt has recently been reported that the organization of chromosomes in the nucleus has a certain architecture, known as CT.24 CT is closely linked with gene regulation in mammalian cells and is conserved between species.32,33 The structural features of chromosomes have been demonstrated using FISH for specific loci34 and by DamID for LADs at a sub-megabase resolution.31 Lamins are filamentous proteins found in nuclear lamina at the nuclear periphery, serving as the scaffold of the nuclear envelope, and LADs are the specific chromosomal regions with higher AT content located close to the nuclear lamina. Gene density along the chromosomes is correlated with the structural features of chromosomes; gene-dense regions tend to be located towards the centre of the nucleus, while gene-poor regions are observed close to the nuclear periphery, i.e. LADs.To analyse the distribution of 8-oxoG in terms of the three-dimensional architecture of chromosomes, we compared its distribution with the lamin B1 profile determined for the mouse cells using DamID mapping.31 There is no profile available for lamin B1 in the rat cells; however, because it has been shown that LADs do not considerably change between different cell types and species,35 we used the data for mouse embryonic fibroblasts. First, we downloaded the data of the lamin B1 profile for these fibroblasts with the coordinates on mm9 assembly and subsequently converted the coordinates to rat (rn4) using the liftOver program.36 The 8-oxoG and lamin B1 profiles showed a clear correlation (Fig. 5; Supplementary Data). For quantitative assessment of the correlation, we divided the genomic sequence into 200 kb fragments, and calculated the averaged 8-oxoG and lamin B1 values for each fragment. We adopted 200 kb as a fragment size because LADs generally span from 100 kb to 10 Mb.37 We converted the averaged values of these two indices for each 200 kb fragment into a contour plot to visually evaluate the relationship between 8-oxoG and lamin B1 profiles (Fig. 6A). We observed a positive trend between 8-oxoG and lamin B1 levels even though LADs are high AT content. The transitions between regions with low and high levels of lamin B1 are extremely sharp;37 we observed clear bimodal distribution in terms of lamin B1 levels. Next, following the bimodal distribution, the genomic fragments were grouped into two subsets using the averaged lamin B1 value of 0 as a cut-off, and the data were used to plot the histograms shown in Figure 6B. Averaged 8-oxoG values in the negative and positive lamin B1 groups were -0.13 and 0.25, respectively. The histograms show significantly different distributions (Student's t-test; P < 2.2 × 10-16), indicating that there is an excess of 8-oxoG in LADs.

The fragments are grouped into two subsets using the averaged lamin B1 value of 0 as a cut-off. Sets with high and low contents of lamin B1 are shown in red and blue, respectively.To confirm the significance of this trend, we evaluated the chance to obtain such differences in 8-oxoG levels in negative and positive lamin B1 groups by randomly assigning lamin B1 levels to genomic fragments. We iterated this procedure 1,000 times and confirmed that such differences do not occur by chance (z-score = 55; P < 10-10).To further confirm that the observed correlation is not due to an artefact of using lamin B1 profile obtained from mouse embryonic fibroblasts transferred to rat genome but irrespective of cell types, species, and fragment size for averaging, we conducted the same analysis by using lamin B1 data for the following samples: mouse astrocytes, mouse nueral progenitor cells, mouse embryonic stem cells, and human Tig3 lung fibroblasts.31,37 According to the previous paper,35 71% of the genomic regions are similar among different cell types in terms of LAD localization. This can be divided into two parts: the genomic regions that are constitutively classified as LADs (constitutive LADs) (33%) and the genomic regions that are always LAD free (constitute inter-LADs) (38%). By transferring the data for each cell types to rat genome, and also by changing the fragment size to 50 and 500 kb, we always obtained similar patterns of distributions to that of mouse embryonic fibroblasts with the fragment size for averaging of 200 kb, indicating that the observation that the excess of 8-oxoG in LAD regions is not affected by the data source to be transferred to rat genome and the fragment size for averaging, but rather found to be a robust feature of 8-oxoG distribution (Supplementary Data).4. DiscussionThe first study of the genome-wide distribution of 8-oxoG has been performed for human lymphocytes using in situ immunodetection.21 The study has shown that 8-oxoG is unevenly distributed in the genome but follows a specific pattern; the distributions are similar in different individuals.21 In our previous study, we have successfully determined the distribution of 8-oxoG along chromosomes in mouse kidney cells at low resolution; we have used DNA immunoprecipitation with the 8-oxoG-specific antibody and cloning followed by Sanger sequencing.22 Both studies obtained low-resolution profiles (~10 Mb). In the present study, we improved our previous procedure22 to achieve considerably higher resolution by adopting DNA immunoprecipitation followed by microarray analysis. Therefore, we obtained the 8-oxoG distribution along rat genome with the average probe interval of 6 kb.There is a dynamic equilibrium between generation and repair of 8-oxoG modifications; therefore, the distribution observed is a snapshot of such an equilibrium state. The main 8-oxoG repair pathway is the base excision repair (BER). This repair pathway, which involves OGG1, MTH1, and MUTYH enzymes,38 exists in a wide range of species from prokaryotes to higher eukaryotes.39 Some studies have reported another type of 8-oxoG repair mechanism in Escherichia coli, a transcription-coupled repair (TCR)40,41 although 8-oxoG is a non-helix-distorting base lesion. Recently, it has been suggested that a similar repair system may also exist in eukaryotes.42 If such a system existed in eukaryotes, we would observe a negative correlation between 8-oxoG levels and transcriptional activity. However, we did not observe significant correlation between 8-oxoG levels and gene expression levels. This does not exclude the existence of TCR for 8-oxoG in eukaryotes because 8-oxoG levels in genic regions is rather low compared with gene-poor regions, which makes it difficult to detect subtle, if any, differences. If we increase the 8-oxoG level by artificial oxidative stress, we may be able to see a negative correlation between the 8-oxoG level and transcriptional activity.There are several possible reasons for the differences in 8-oxoG levels along chromosomes. According to the CT model, gene-rich regions tend to be located towards the interior of the nucleus, whereas gene-poor regions are closer to the nuclear periphery.24 The negative correlation observed between the 8-oxoG level and gene density may reflect the spatial architecture of chromosomes in the nucleus. LADs are well-characterized structural features of chromosomes.31 Therefore, we focused on the relationship between 8-oxoG and LADs. The distribution profiles of 8-oxoG and LADs are highly similar, suggesting that 8-oxoG is preferentially formed in LADs. This can be interpreted in at least two ways. One possible explanation is that LADs occupy the outermost regions of chromosomes in the nuclear spatial architecture. These regions are more exposed to the external oxidative stresses than the centrally located parts of chromosomes and more likely to be modified (Fig. 7A). This observation is consistent with the ‘bodyguard’ hypothesis proposed by Hsu.43 The author argued that heterochromatin localized at the nuclear periphery may protect the centrally located euchromatin against mutagens and other substances that modify chromosomal DNA. Although experimental evidence that directly supports this hypothesis was not provided for a long time,34 our observation that 8-oxoG tends to co-localize with LADs is in agreement with the hypothesis. In addition, guanine is known to be susceptible to oxidation because of its low oxidation potential, leading to a speculation that the formation of 8-oxoG may protect other genomic regions from mutagenesis due to oxidative stress.44Figure 7.Open in new tabDownload slideTwo models showing the association of 8-oxoG distribution with the relative position in the nucleus.

(B) Heterochromatin structures in LADs impede the access of repair enzymes, such as OGG1.Another explanation of the similarity between 8-oxoG and LAD profiles is that the compact structure of LADs may prevent repair components from interacting with these regions (Fig. 7B). It has been shown that LADs are mostly inactive with regard to transcription and other cellular activities and are dominated by suppressive histone modifications such as H3K27me3.37 It has been also shown that LADs form heterochromatin.45 In heterochromatic regions, the recruitment of enzymes involved in BER, such as OGG1, is blocked; BER is less active in the heterochromatic than in euchromatic regions.46There is a positive correlation between 8-oxoG levels, ageing, and carcinogenesis,6 which led us to focus on the detailed distribution of 8-oxoG along the chromosomes. We used normal rat kidney tissue, which is a suitable model for carcinogenesis due to oxidative stress. Rat kidney cancer induced by oxidative reagents, such as FeNTA, has long been used as a model for such cancers.47,48 In this model, the development of cancer takes from 1 to 2 years after injecting with FeNTA, which is comparable with the lifespan of a rat. The process resembles the development of cancer in humans to a larger extent than several transgenic mouse cancer models, which develops cancer considerably shorter period of time.49–51 Although the rate of cancer development is generally rather lower in rodents than in humans, rats injected with FeNTA develop cancer more frequently than mice after the same treatment.47,52 For these reasons, rats seem to be a model species particularly suitable for the analysis of cancer development in humans. We are planning to trace genome-wide changes in the distribution of 8-oxoG under oxidative stress condition to see if 8-oxoG increases in nuclear periphery. This will lead to further experiments about cancer development by measuring the 8-oxoG distributions at different stages of cancer to reveal its role in cancer progression. The data obtained in this study can constitute a basis for further studies in this and related fields.5.

IntroductionGlucosinolates (GSs) are secondary metabolites mainly found in the family of Brassicaceae1,2 which includes rapeseed (Brassica napus L.), the globally important oil crop. Some breakdown products of GS have an anti-nutritional value for livestock,3 thus making it necessary to breed for rapeseed varieties with low GS (<30 mol g-1) in seeds.4 However, modern varieties with low GS in seeds tend to be associated with a concomitant reduction of the GS content in leaves,5,6 and thus they are more susceptible to insects7,8 and diseases such as Sclerotinia sclerotiorum.9 For this reason, it is desirable to reduce the GS contents within seeds so that the cake is suitable for fodder and yet maintain the disease-protective effects of high GS contents in other organs. As a prerequisite for this aim, candidate genes for GS biosynthesis and transportation in rapeseed must be identified.The chemical structure of GS comprises a thioglucose moiety, a sulphonated oxime, and a side chain derived from aliphatic or aromatic amino acids, or tryptophan.3 There are three basic steps for GS biosynthesis in plants, i.e. amino acid chain elongation, GS skeleton formation, and side-chain modification.10,11 To date, nearly all genes responsible for biosynthetic steps have been identified,12–24 leading to the clarification of the core pathway of GS biosynthesis in Brassicaceae (Supplementary Fig. S1).25–27 The GSs are believed to be synthesized mainly in rosette and silique walls and then relocated actively to embryos through phloem by specific transporters.28–32 Blocking the reallocation of GS from vegetative organs to embryos could be an effective way of reducing GS concentrations in seeds without affecting other tissues. This concept has been supported by the most recent identification of GTR1 and GTR2 that encode a GS transporter in Arabidopsis. In the gtr1 gtr2 double-mutant plants, the GS content was found to be reduced by 100% in seeds but with a 10-fold increase in rosette.33Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis is a powerful method to study the genetics underpinning quantitative variation in GS profiles.34 For total GS accumulation in the seeds, seven QTLs have been identified on several linkage groups in rapeseed.35–38 More recently, Feng et al.39 identified 105 metabolite QTLs that had an effect on the GS concentration and constructed an advanced metabolic network for the GS composition in both leaves and seeds of rapeseed. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) is another powerful tool of identifying genes associated with complex traits, which has several advantages over bi-parental QTL mapping.40,41 The number of GWASs conducted is rapidly increasing, and it has resulted in the discovery of genes for tocopherol, carotenoid, and oil content in maize,42–44 and genes underlying important traits such as flowering time and grain yield in rice.45,46 Studies regarding GWAS in rapeseed have gained attention in recent years. The overall level of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in 85 winter rapeseed genotypes was found to be very low, with a mean r2 of 0.027.47 A structure-based association study using gene-linked simple-sequence repeat markers revealed that four genes were associated with the total GS content in seeds.48 Most recently, a panel of 472 rapeseed lines were further applied to a GWAS of seed weight and seed quality traits, leading to the identification of four clusters of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) highly associated with the GS content.49With the rapid development of the new biotechnology, especially the emergence and application of next-generation sequencing technologies such as Illumina (Solexa) sequencing, a considerable progress in the accumulation and distribution of Brassica genome data has been made in recent years. These endeavours have resulted in a 95-k unigene set and 41,211 SNPs publicly available for Brassica community (Brassica genome gateway; http://brassica.nbi.ac.uk/). More recently, the massively parallel RNA sequencing (mRNA-Seq)50 was also applied to dissect the genome of B. napus at transcriptome level, which led to the development of some 23,000 SNP markers and the construction of an ultradensity linkage map in B. napus.51 Moreover, gene expression variation (i.e. gene expression marker, GEM) for each unigene can also be inferred from the same set of mRNA-Seq data, providing additional ca. 189,000 GEMs for both A and C genome. With the huge amount of markers (SNPs and GEMs) derived from mRNA-Seq, an improved GWAS method termed ‘associative transcriptomics’ (AT) was proposed to overcome the difficulties (e.g. the complexity of polyploidy and the lack of reference genome sequences to order SNPs) that hinder GWAS in B. napus.52 The novel AT methodology has been proved in a relatively small panel, and the orthologs of HAG1 (also known as MYB28), the key player in the regulation of aliphatic GS biosynthesis in Arabidopsis (Supplementary Fig. 1), were discovered to be vital for GS variation in B. napus.52 However, due to the small number of lines used, the power of AT has not been fully exploited, and many other candidate genes for GS as well as their allelic variations in the germplasm have yet to be characterized. Frequency distribution of total seed glucosinolate concentrations in the diversity panel.Frequency distribution of total seed glucosinolate concentrations in the diversity panel.The aim of this study is to address the genetic control of GS natural variation in B. napus using AT. This has been achieved by genotyping a panel of 101 lines by mRNA-Seq and phenotyping the total GS content in seeds. Four consensus association peaks and also many candidate genes involved in the GS pathway were identified. The identification of candidate genes not only furthers our understanding of the gene network for GS biosynthesis but also provides markers for the breeding of low GS rapeseed varieties.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materials and GS measurementsA diversity panel comprising 101 B. napus lines was used for association mapping study. Within this panel, there are 54 winter, 17 spring, and 5 semi-winter rapeseed type lines, which are mainly collected from Europe, Canada, and China, respectively. To maximize allelic variations for GS-related genes, B. napus lines of five kale types, nine swede types, nine fodder types, one synthetic type, and one vegetable type were also included (Supplementary Table S1).Seeds of all lines were sown into 9-cm pots containing Scotts Levington F1 compost (Scotts), germinated, and grown in long-day (16-h photoperiod) glasshouse conditions at 15°C for 21 days, as described previously.52 The experiment was arranged into a four-block, one-way randomized design with one plant of each of the lines per block and randomized within each block. The first true leaf of each plant (21 days after sowing) was excised and pooled according to line and frozen in liquid nitrogen, giving a final harvest of four pooled leaf samples per line. These samples will be used for DNA and RNA extractions.To phenotype the GS content, seeds of all lines were sown in January 2012 as described by Smooker et al.53 Then, the vernalized seedlings were transplanted into the field at John Innes Centre, Norwich, UK (1.297°E, 52.628°N) by the end of April 2012 in four randomized blocks at an average density of three plants per square meter. Before the flowers opened, racemes were covered by bread bags to obtain selfed seeds for GS measurement. Mature seeds were harvested from each plot and measured for the total GS content using near infra-red spectroscopy (NIRS) at KWS-UK (Foss NIRS Systems 5000). The GS content for each line was presented as a mean value of four replicates.2.2. Transcriptome sequencing and SNP callingRNA was prepared by grinding juvenile leaves in liquid nitrogen and extracting the RNA using the E.Z.N.A. Plant RNA Kit (Omega Bio-Tek) according to the manufacturer’'s protocol. After RNA samples had been isolated and dried, they were dissolved in diethylpyrocarbonate-treated H2O, and a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (model ND-1000) was used to determine the RNA concentration. RNA quality was assessed by running 1 µl of each RNA sample on an Agilent RNA 6000 Nano LabChip (Agilent Technology 2100 Bioanalyzer).Illumina sequencing, quality checking, and processing were conducted as described previously.51 Briefly, the sequencing libraries for all lines were prepared separately using the Illumina mRNA-Seq kit (RS-100–0801, Illumina Inc.), and run on a single lane for 80 cycles on the Illumina Genome Analyzer GAIIx. Illumina base calling files were processed using GERALD to produce a sequence file containing 80 base reads for each sample.SNPs were called by the meta-analysis of alignments of Illumina reads obtained from each of 101 B. napus against a Brassica A and C genome-cured unigene reference sequence, as described previously.54,55 SNP positions were excluded from further analysis if more than two alleles were detected across the accessions, and a noise threshold of 0.15 was employed to reduce false SNP calls due to sequencing errors.Using methods and scripts also described before,52,54,55 SNPs identified within the superset assembled over all the 101 B. napus lines were then assigned to the A or C genomes through the computational detection of cis-linkage within sequenced Illumina reads to independently identify inter-homologue polymorphisms (IHPs). Only simple cases with two classes of linkage (each of the bases constituting the IHP linked exclusively to only one of the bases constituting the SNP) were accepted. SNPs were traversed to make genome assignments based on the IHP-mediated and other lines of evidence.2.3. GEM callingUsing methods and scripts described before,54,55 Illumina reads from the 101 B. napus lines were realigned against the ‘cured’ reference comprising the A and C genome versions of 94,558 unigenes (189,116 in total) using MAQ version 0.7.1 (http://maq.sourceforge.net/index.shtml) and assigned to the A and C genome. When a read maps equally well to multiple IHP positions, MAQ will randomly pick one position, thereby distributing reads evenly between the A and C genome versions of the unigene where the sequence is identical. MAQ pile-up text files were generated from the MAQ binary map files. The Perl script tagcounter.pl54 was used to count the number of reads aligning to the A and C genome version of each unigene by accessing the pile-up files, outputting a count and calculated reads per kb (of unigene) per million aligned reads (RPKM) value for each unigene.2.4. SNP association analysisThe SNP data set for the 101 lines was entered into the program STRUCTURE 2.3.4.56 An admixture model with independent allele frequencies was used, and the K value best representing the data set was determined according to the method of Evanno et al.57 Once the optimal number of K populations was established, a Q matrix score for each individual line could be used as a fixed effect in the subsequent association analysis. The GS trait data, Q matrix, and SNP data for all lines were entered into the program TASSEL 3.0.58 Minor allele states below 0.05 were removed from the SNP data set, and a kinship (K) matrix was calculated to estimate the pairwise relatedness between individuals. These data sets were entered into a mixed linear model (MLM) with optimum compression and P3D variance component estimation to decrease the computing time for the large data set. The significant value and also the marker effect for each SNP were exported, and a Manhattan plot was generated in R package (http://cran.r-project.org).2.5. GEM association analysisThe relationship between gene expression and GS content of seeds was determined by linear regression using R package.52 For each unigene, RPKM values were regressed as the dependent variable and the GS content as the independent variable, and R2 and significance values (P) were calculated for each unigene. The P-value for each unigene was converted into -log10P and plotted against its physical position in the ‘pseudomolecules’ to generate a Manhattan plot.2.6. Co-expression analysisWeighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA)59 was performed as described previously.52 Briefly, 101 B. napus lines were clustered according to the RPKM values of unigenes. Then, a soft-thresholding power (ß = 5) to approximate scale-free topology within the network was determined by plotting the scale-free topology fitting index against soft threshold (power). Genes were then clustered using dissimilarity based on the topological overlap calculated between all genes. A value of 0.2 was selected to cut the branches of the dendrogram, resulting in a network containing 122 modules, each represented by a colour. Each module was summarized by the first principal component of the scaled (standardized) module expression profiles. Thus, the module eigengene explains the maximum amount of variation of the module expression levels. Network construction was performed using the ‘blockwiseModules’ function in the software package, which allows the network construction for the entire data set. The summary profile (eigengene) for each module was then correlated with external traits. This analysis identifies several significant module trait associations; the most interesting is the relationship between the ‘lightblue4’ module and total GS content in seeds (Supplementary Fig. S2). The programme Cytoscape60 was used to draw the network with significant connected genes.To analyze gene ontology (GO), all unigenes from ‘lightblue4’ module were submitted to the online toolkit, agriGO (http://bioinfo.cau.edu.cn/agriGO/), to generate a GO network using the Singular Enrichment Analysis tool.612.7. Polymerase chain reaction amplification and resequencingThe nucleotide sequences of two unigenes, JCVI_13343 (BnaA.GTR2a) and EX043693 (BnaC.HAG3b), were retrieved from database (http://brassica.nbi.ac.uk/) and used as templates to design specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers. BnaA.GTR2a was amplified from genomic DNA using oligonucleotide primers GTR2F (GGGATTTTCTTCGCCTTT) and GTR2R (GTCCAAAGAGTTGTAAATGGT), and BnaC.HAG3b was amplified with HAG3F (TGGAGTGTACGAGAAAAAC) and HAG3R (TTCATACATCAAATACCAAAC). Following PCR amplification, the products were resolved on a ABI 3730XL capillary sequencer by GATC Biotech Ltd. (London, UK) as a commercial service and analysed using Sequence Scanner V1 (http://www.appliedbiosystems.com) to determine the presence or absence of each DNA polymorphism.3. Results3.1. Phenotypic variation of total GS concentration in seedsSeeds of 101 B. napus lines were harvested and measured for total GS concentration using NIRS (Fig. 1). The GS content for each line ranged from 8.0 to 195.6 µmol g-1, with an average of 65.3 µmol g-1. The coefficient of variation was estimated as high as 73.2%, a sign of wide variation for GS concentrations in this panel. Thus, it is suitable for association mapping. Moreover, 41% of lines were classified as low GS (<30 µmol g-1), one of the two key characteristics for the canola quality in rapeseed. The GS concentrations for Tapidor and Ningyou7 (two parents of the widely used mapping population TNDH) were 19.0 and 85.7 µmol g-1, respectively, which were very close to previous results (19.9 and 78.6 µmol g-1).393.2. Genotyping of B. napus linesRNA was isolated and sequenced from each of 101 B. napus lines, providing a total of >200 Gb of 80-bp sequence reads (under accession numbers: ERA122949, ERA036824, and ERA063602). By mapping sequence reads to a reference sequence comprising the Brassica unigene set, a total of 225,011 SNP markers were called (Supplementary Table S2). Among these markers, 80,880 with minor allele frequencies (MAF) <0.05 were removed, and the remaining 144,131 SNP markers were further mapped onto specific genomes. As expected, only a few of these markers could be mapped onto either A (7580) or C (7673) genome, which are very useful for anchoring genetic loci to a specific genome location; the majority (89.4%) was mapped onto both genomes, because A and C genome sequences are highly similar.51The GEM, expressed as RPKM value of a unigene, can also be inferred from the mRNA-Seq data. This exercise provided a total of 189,116 GEMs, with 94,558 on A and C genomes. Among these GEMs, 49,599 and 50,935 were shown to be informative (i.e. RPKM > 0 for at least some lines) on respective A and C genomes; thus they were also used for marker-trait association study.3.3. Genetic structure and LDThe 144,131 informative SNPs were first used for genetic structure analysis. Again, all B. napus lines can be largely divided into two clusters by the Bayesian clustering algorithms implemented in STRUCTURE, one of which consists of most winter-type lines and the other of spring-type, swede, and kale lines (Supplementary Fig. S3 and Table S1).To facilitate comparison, the 15,253 mapped SNP markers that have been previously used in a smaller panel52 were again used for LD analysis in 101 lines. The extent of LD was gauged by calculating pairwise r2 for the mapped SNPs using an LD window of 500 (providing >30,000 pairwise values of r2). The mean LD across the whole genome was 0.0209, which is close to the previous estimates of 0.0246 in a subset of these lines52 and confirms the low overall level of LD in B. napus.The strength of LD was also measured across each chromosome pseudomolecule. As an example, there were several small but strong LD blocks (r2 > 0.2) in A2 (Supplementary Fig. S4a). Meanwhile, two large LD blocks sit on both ends of C9 (Supplementary Fig. S4b).3.4. Loci associated with the GS concentrationSNPs and GEMs were separately used for AT study on total GS concentration in seeds. Firstly, 144,131 informative SNPs were regressed with the GS trait using a MLM implemented in TASSEL, leading to the identification of 10 association peaks at a Bonferroni threshold of P < 6.9 × 10-6 (i.e. P = 1/144,131; -log10P = 5.2) (Supplementary Fig. S5a). These peaks were located on A2, A3, A6, A9, C2, C3, C4, C7, and C9 (Table 1). It is not surprising that some peaks on the A genome are very similar to those on the C genome, owing to the fact that most SNPs were mapped onto both A and C genomes. The well-defined peaks were found on A2, A3, A6, A9, C2, C3, and C9, within which there were foci to identify candidate genes for GS. However, P-values erroneously fail to be significant for markers in multiple comparison tests when analysing a large number of SNPs.52 Therefore, we used an ad hoc threshold of 10-4 to assess genomic regions underlying association peaks for the presence of candidate genes. In all, 255 SNPs were found to be highly associated with GS, which were derived from 110 unigenes (Supplementary Fig. S6). Of the 110 unigenes, only 2 were directly implicated in the GS metabolism pathway (Table 2), and the proteins encoded by the remaining 108 genes were classified as transcription factors, factors responding to stimulus or involved in cellular process, catalytic activity, or with unknown functions (data not shown).

International Union of Biochemistry ambiguity codes: R = A or G.Secondly, 100,534 GEMs were then regressed (simple linear regression) with GS concentrations, which resulted in the identification of seven association peaks located on A2, A4, A9, C2, C4, C7, and C9 at P < 9.9 × 10-6 (i.e. P = 1/100,534; -log10P = 5.0) (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. S5b). A total of 352 GEMs (262 unigenes) were screened within these peaks at P < 10-4. Of these unigenes, 22 have also been identified by SNPs (Supplementary Fig. S6). Moreover, 24 unigenes detected by GEMs were shown to be directly involved in GS metabolism (Table 3). This number is 12 times of those captured by SNPs, demonstrating that the GEM analysis is more powerful than the SNP analysis in terms of capacity of screening candidate genes for GS.

Among these peaks, five co-located on A2, A9, C2, C7, and C9 (Table 1). Interestingly, four out of the five common peaks locate in the same intervals of previous QTLs for total GS contents39 (Fig. 2). Within these peaks, the previously characterized orthologs of HAG1,52 a gene encoding transcription factor for GS biosynthesis, were re-identified by both SNP and GEMs (Tables 2 and 3), indicating the robustness of AT results.

Blue bar beneath chromosome pseudomolecule indicates the confident interval of a QTL for total seed glucosinolate content reported.393.5. Distribution pattern of GEMsThere was a well-defined association peak on A2. Interestingly, GEMs within this peak showed a distinct clustering pattern, as reflected by the existence of a gap (i.e. some GEMs clustered at –log10P > 6.2 while the others at <4.9) (Supplementary Fig. S5b). Actually, the eight GEMs clustering at the top of this peak were highly correlated with each other (P < 0.01), and two of them have similar functions (encode methylthioalkylmalate synthase, MAM)62 in GS biosynthesis, whereas the other six encode proteins with unknown functions. This observation indicated that genes involved in the GS pathway may tend to be located in close proximity to each other and have similar expression patterns, resulting in this clustering of GEMs.3.6. Gene co-expression analysis for GSGEM analysis has the additional advantage that it can be used for WGCNA to dissect the biological process underlying traits. This approach was used to construct a co-expression network for the GS concentration that contained 122 modules (co-expressed genes), with between 31 and 16,989 unigenes in each module. The ‘lightblue4’ module was highly correlated with the total GS content of seeds (r = 0.55; P = 2.0 × 10-8) (see also Supplementary Fig. S7). This module comprises 91 unigenes (114 GEMs), of which 40 were implied to be involved in GS biosynthesis (Supplementary Table S3).Then, a co-expression network was constructed with probes (genes) from ‘lightblue4’ module to identify the relationships between genes highly associated with GS metabolism. It was found that the unigene JCVI-16890, the Arabidopsis ortholog of which encodes a plastidic bile acid transporter (BAT5),63 is in the central node in this network. Other hub genes in this network included JCVI_12709 and JCVI_30455, the orthologs of which encode branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase (BCAT/MAAT)64 and MAM1, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S8). All these genes have been shown to play key roles in the GS biosynthesis pathway in Arabidopsis (Supplementary Fig. S1).GO analysis was further performed with unigenes from the ‘lightblue4’ module to construct a biological metabolism network. As a result, most of the genes are enriched in the biological process related to GS synthesis, such as carbohydrate metabolic process and cellular nitrogen compound metabolic process in the initial stage and later in the GS biosynthetic process and sulphur amino acid biosynthetic process. Meanwhile, a few genes encode proteins for cellular components responding to external stimulus (Supplementary Fig. S9).3.7. Identification of DNA polymorphism by re-sequencingApproximately 66 candidate genes involved in the GS metabolic pathway have been identified by either AT or WGCNA (Tables 2 and 3 and Supplementary Table S3). Some genes of interest were further selected to investigate and verify the potential associations of allelic variation of genes with phenotypic variation in the association panel. This was achieved by amplifying and re-sequencing PCR products using lines with various GS contents in seeds.The first unigene of interest is JCVI_13343 (BnaA.GTR2a); the Arabidopsis ortholog encodes proteins for transporting GS compounds from leaf to seed.33BnaA.GTR2a is located in a genomic region within the peak on A2 (Fig. 3a), and its expression was positively correlated with the accumulation of GS in seeds (r = 0.43, P < 10-4), accounting for 18.8% of trait variation (Supplementary Fig. S10a). Although there were nine known SNPs (at positions 469, 625, 655, 667, 688, 775, 860, 861, and 952) within this unigene, none of them was strongly associated with GS. To detect the potential new sequence variation (i.e. insertion or deletion, InDel) within this locus, specific primers were designed and used to amplify the complete unigene (ca. 600 bp) from 42 lines. By sequences alignment, all nine known SNPs were re-identified although some of them were not polymorphic (as only a subset of lines were analysed), and six were previously unidentified SNPs (at positions 538, 565, 571, 640, 727, and 748) (Supplementary Table S4). These results confirmed the robustness and efficiency of SNP development via mRNA-Seq in B. napus. However, none of the 10 polymorphic SNPs (at positions 469, 538, 565, 571, 640, 655, 727, 748, 860, and 861) were correlated with the GS content (r < 0.11, P > 0.500) and thus were not likely to be causative for trait variation. Associations and genomic locations of two candidate genes for the seed glucosinolate content.

(a) A locus identified on A2, and (b) A locus identified on C9.Another unigene of interest is EX043693 (BnaC.HAG3b), which is located within the peak on C9 which coincides with a region of strong and extensive LD (Fig. 3b). In Arabidopsis, HAG3 (MYB29) is a transcription factor modulating many genes in the GS pathway.65 Expression of BnaC.HAG3b is highly associated with GS accumulation (r = 0.41, P < 10-8) and accounts for 16.8% of trait variation (Supplementary Fig. S10b). However, no SNPs have been detected by mRNA-Seq within this gene. Therefore, genomic regions covering the length of EX043693 were amplified from 70 lines and then sequenced to detect potential DNA sequence variations. By comparing sequences of these DNA fragments, four InDels, i.e. InDel3–1 (3-bp insertion), InDel3–2 (3-bp deletion), InDel7 (7-bp deletion), and InDel1 (1-bp deletion), were detected. These InDels formed two haplotypes: haplotype I includes the 3-bp insertion and 11-bp (i.e. 3 plus 7 plus 1) of deletions, while haplotype II has the sequence identical to the reference unigene EX043693 (Fig. 4). A total number of 60 lines were determined as haplotype I at these loci and 10 lines as haplotype II. The average GS concentration of haplotype I (56.3 µmol g-1) was only 55% of that of haplotype II (the wild type), consistent with the net 8-bp (frame-shift) deletion reducing the functional properties of the encoded protein. To facilitate germplasm screening and marker-assisted selection for the low GS content, a pair of specific PCR primers was designed, which only captures the 11-bp deletions so that the polymorphism can be more easily resolved by agarose gel (Fig. 4). An example of PCR amplification is given in Fig. 5; the haplotype I and II lines can be clearly distinguished by the presence of a 226-bp- and 237-bp-specific fragment, respectively. Thus, the polymorphism at BnaC.HAG3b locus has been successfully converted into a PCR-based marker. Summary of significant polymorphisms at BnaC.HAG3b locus.

Scenario of AT for GSAssociation mapping is a powerful tool for the identification of genes underlying complex traits. However, it is not so straightforward to perform GWAS in polyploid crops such as rapeseed, mainly due to the complexity of genome constitution and the lack of complete genome reference sequences. As an allopolyploid species, rapeseed is formed by the hybridization of progenitor species B. rapa (which contributed the A genome) and B. oleracea (which contributed the C genome).66 The constituent A and C genomes within B. napus are highly similar to their ancestors, with only ~15% difference at a nucleotide level and only 3% at a transcript level,51,54 which thus hinder the development of tens of thousands of SNPs for GWAS. To address this challenge, our study focused on the development of molecular markers by mRNA-Seq, which can not only detect the sequence variation (i.e. SNPs) but also transcript abundance (i.e. GEMs). Juvenile leaf was used as a tissue for mRNA extraction, because it has a large number of expressing genes and so serves as a good gene compartment. In our AT study, SNPs were successfully associated with GS concentration in seeds. Interestingly, such association could also be achieved by using GEMs as independent variants to regress with GS contents as dependent variants. The scenario of AT for GS is that the juvenile leaf, where expressing genes have been captured by mRNA-Seq, is a major organ for GS synthesis at the vegetative stage. The GS compounds are then stored in these organs and subsequently transported to the embryos at a later developmental stage, as exhibited in Arabidopsis.30–33 Thus, GS accumulation in seeds is biologically connected with gene expression in leaves. Indeed, the expression of many genes, including those already known to be involved in the GS pathway, was found to be highly associated with the GS content and formed several peaks on the genome (Fig. 2). More generally, the high association of gene expression at the early developmental stage (e.g. juvenile leaf) with a target trait at a later development stage (e.g. in seeds) is due to allelic, cis-acting variation rather than being a read-out of a transcription network, as hypothesized previously for the association in maize hybrids of transcript abundance variation in leaves with grain yield.67 With this concept in mind, many association peaks were also identified in wheat for straw biomass traits such as height, weight, and width by AT (Harper et al., submitted). Therefore, it seems that AT can be widely applied to many crops, even including those with complex genomes like rapeseed and wheat. Moreover, candidate loci can also be successfully identified using the transcriptome of a single tissue that provides a suitable genome compartment, such as juvenile leaf. This has the added benefit that multiple trait types can be mapped using a single mRNA-Seq data set.4.2. Improving the resolution of ATCompared with the previous AT study for the GS content in B. napus using 53 lines as a proof of concept,52 a greatly enhanced resolution was achieved by using an extended panel comprising 101 lines in this study. With this new diversity panel, the total number of SNP markers was found to increase from the previous 101,644 to the present 225,011. Even after removing markers with MAF < 0.05, the informative SNP markers (144,131) that can be used for the AT study were also twice as high as the previous report, leading to the detection of 10 association peaks at a significance level of P < 6.9 × 10-6. In comparison, only four peaks were detected in the previous study, even at a lower threshold (P < 10-4).36 Likewise, three more peaks were detected using a similar number of GEMs in this study, leading to the identification of many more candidate genes for GS. Given that many more association peaks and candidate genes were identified, the resolution of AT appears to be markedly improved by using an enlarged panel. It is anticipated that the resolution can be further improved by using an even larger diversity panel.Most recently, Li et al.49 also carried out a GWAS and identified four association peaks on A9, C2, C7, and C9 for GS content, which were reconfirmed in our study. It is worth noting that the number of association peaks in our analysis is still superior to theirs (i.e. 10 versus 7) although they have used a larger panel (472 lines), possibly due to a much larger number of SNP markers employed (144,131 versus 24,256). Another unique feature of our study is that additional GEMs can be developed for marker-trait association and gene co-expression analysis, which in turn allowed for the identification of many more candidate genes (Table 3 and Supplementary Table S3).4.3. Possible function of new genes inferred from gene co-expression analysisIn our study, a gene network for GS has been inferred from WGCNA (Supplementary Fig. S8), which was further confirmed by GO analysis (Supplementary Fig. S9). As for GO analysis, most genes are enriched in GS or sulphate amino acid (a precursor for GS) synthesis. The unigene JCVI_16890 (BnaC.BAT5) was found in the hub of the core network (Supplementary Fig. S8). In Arabidopsis, BAT5 is a member of the putative bile acid transporter family and the target of the aliphatic GS regulators, HAG1 and HAG3 (MYB29). Moreover, BAT5 mediates the transport of 4-methylthio-2-oxobutanoate and of long-chain 2-keto acids across the chloroplast envelope membrane before, during, and after side-chain elongation of 2-keto acids and is thus a key player in the aliphatic GS biosynthetic pathway.63 Other genes in the present core network included MAM1, BCAT4, and AOP2, and those genes encoding proteins for amino acid metabolites (AK3 and IMD1). These genes function in nearly all key steps in the GS pathway (Supplementary Fig. S1), and all were connected to the some extent, with BAT5 (Supplementary Fig. S8). Thus, BnaC.BAT5 also seems to have a key role for GS biosynthesis in B. napus, which was underlined by the fact that the transcript abundance of BnaC.BAT5 is positively correlated with GS accumulation in seeds (r = 0.493, P = 1.2 × 10-6).Another unigene of interest was JCVI_9761 (ortholog of AT5G14910), which was the only one found in common between the WGCNA, SNP, and GEM analyses. This gene encodes a putative heavy metal transport/detoxification containing domain protein in Arabidopsis. It is located in the chloroplast thylakoid membrane, chloroplast stroma, or chloroplast, and is involved in heavy metal ion transport (http://www.arabidopsis.org/). Although evidence is still lacking for the direct connection of AT5G14910 with GS biosynthesis, some clues exist for such a connection. For instance, a complex interaction between metals and GS levels was observed,68 which underlines a mechanism for plant defence against herbivores or pathogens.69 Zinc can be taken up and compartmented by specific transporters70 and clearly had a distinctive effect on the specific group of indolyl GS in Thlaspi caerulescens. Within both roots and shoots, the levels of these compounds were drastically reduced by zinc.71 In B. rapa, higher zinc concentration in hydroponic solution markedly decreased the accumulation of aliphatic GS but increased the indole and aromatic GS in shoots.72 Thus, the ortholog of AT5G14910 in B. napus (i.e. JCVI_9761) seems to be a potential regulator of the GS biosynthesis although it still needs to be fully elucidated in future.4.4. Sequence variation of GTR2 and HAG3, and the development of markers for breeding selectionmRNA-Seq is a powerful tool to develop SNPs but has some limitations for detecting more extensive sequence variation. It is therefore necessary to confirm or detect new causative polymorphisms by re-sequencing PCR fragments amplified from genomic DNA for two main reasons. Firstly, during the discovery of SNPs by aligning 80-bp mRNA-Seq reads to the reference sequences, very restrictive criteria were empirically applied (allowing only 1-bp mismatch) to avoid false discovery incurred from sequence errors,55 but this process also removes all sequence variation =2-bp. Secondly, sequence variation at noncoding regions within a gene such as promoter, terminator, or intron cannot be detected by mRNA-Seq.Previously, orthologs of HAG1 on A9 and C2 have been identified as key regulators for GS synthesis in rapeseed.52 In this study, another two genes, BnaA.GTR2a and BnaC.HAG3b within the respective peaks on A2 and C9, were of particular interest in that they can jointly explain 25.8% of trait variation by regression analysis. Unfortunately, no causative SNPs were found in the mRNA-Seq data for either BnaA.GTR2a or BnaC.HAG3b. Therefore, specific primers were designed and used to amplify the corresponding genomic regions. Re-sequencing of the PCR products failed to detect any causative polymorphism within JCVI_13343 locus, which only covers 21% of GTR2 mRNA (2.8 kb) in Arabidopsis. In future, sequencing the whole length of GTR2 in B. napus is needed to identify more sequence variations responsible for GS, because InDels may also exist in the promoter, terminator, or intron regions.42 An alternative explanation of the lack of causative polymorphisms in JCVI_13343 is that it is trans-regulated, i.e. its expression level (represented as the RPKM value) is modulated by other gene(s), not by its own sequence variation.As for unigene EX043693 (BnaC.HAG3b), the 3-bp insertion and 11-bp deletion are likely to be important for its function. In fact, insertion and deletion in the genome are very common in crops and are an important mechanism underlying trait variation. For example, two copies of HAG1 (BnaC.HAG1a and BnaA.HAG1c) were shown to have been deleted from both C2 and A9 in low GS B. napus lines.52 In maize, a 117-bp insertion in the promoter and a 35-bp deletion in the intron of ZmVTE4 resulted in a significantly higher level of tocopherol content.42Finally, we have successfully developed a PCR-based marker to detect the 11-bp deletions in BnaC.HAG3b. The genetic effect of this PCR marker on GS has been verified in the diversity panel and thus can be used in germplasm screening and breeding selection of low GS lines.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC BB/H004351/1 (IBTI Club), BB/E017363/1, ERAPG08.008) and UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra IF0144) as well as the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31371663).

This draft genome provides a valuable resource for understanding and improving both fundamental and applied research with pufferfish in the future.1. IntroductionPufferfish of the genus Takifugu are considered as one of the most delicious and expensive dishes in Japan, China and Korea, and they have been artificially cultivated since 1960s.1 Nowadays, a big industry of pufferfish aquaculture is already well established in the East Asia. Takifugu flavidus, also known as the tawny puffer, is one representative economic species that is mainly distributed in the shore waters of the East China Sea, the Yellow Sea and the Bohai Bay. The type locality of T. flavidus is in Qingdao, China. In comparison with another common economic pufferfish T. rubripes (torafugu, the tiger puffer), T. flavidus is incapable of long-distance migration, but only short-distance seasonal migration.2 In addition, T. flavidus is morphologically different from T. rubripes in the skin colour pattern, anal fin colour, body size and other characteristics. There is obvious variation in the skin colour pattern during the growth of T. flavidus. The juvenile T. flavidus is light yellow mixed with dark in the dorsal side with irregular white polka dots. As it grows, the dorsal side turns into dark yellow with elongated black spots with daisy-like edge.3 On the contrary, T. rubripes is black in the dorsal side and has particular black marks with white margins above the pectoral fins (colour pattern like tiger skin). The skin colour pattern basically remains unchanged during the growth of T. rubripes.4 Moreover, the body size of T. flavidus is significantly smaller than that of T. rubripes, as well as the growth rate is much slower. The maximum total lengths of T. flavidus and T. rubripes are 40 and 80 cm, respectively. To reach the weight of 300 g, it will take >30 months for T. flavidus but only 12 months for T. rubripes.5Takifugu flavidus has the highest transaction price among all pufferfish in China, because the taste flavour is believed to be more superior.Pufferfish have been regarded as excellent models for novel gene discovery and evolution study of vertebrates for decades because of their particularly small and compact genomes.6,7 Their genomes are the smallest of all known vertebrate genomes, while still retain a similar gene repertoire with vertebrates at the same time. There is no significant difference in the quantity and length of genes between pufferfish and other vertebrates, except the sizes of introns and repetitive regions are notably reduced.8 The draft genome of T. rubripes was sequenced and released as the second vertebrate genome in 2002,9 and the draft genome of Tetraodon nigroviridis (green spotted puffer) was released in 2004.10 However, the available genetic information of the T. flavidus is still very limited until now. The sequencing of T. flavidus genome is undoubtedly necessary to understand the genetic basis of the characteristic phenotypes of T. flavidus, and it is also helpful to assist the molecular breeding.The second-generation sequencing (next-generation sequencing, NGS) technologies have successfully been applied for many research fields in recent years because of the extraordinary high-throughput sequencing capacity and the low cost per base, such as transcriptome analysis, genotyping and target resequencing.11 However, the short reads of NGS make it still a tough task to de novo assemble higher organism genomes.12 A common strategy for the genome construction of higher organism is hybrid assembling with longer reads, for instance, the reads of bacterial artificial chromosome sequencing or 454 sequencing,13 with the inevitable consequence of more workload and longer turnaround time.In the present study, the draft genome of T. flavidus was sequenced only with the short reads of SOLiD 4 platform and assembled using an assisted assembly approach. This draft was the first genome assembly of T. flavidus, and the third genome of pufferfish. Information on the T. flavidus genome obtained in this study will enhance both fundamental and applied research with T. flavidus and related pufferfish.2. Materials and methods2.1. Biological materialThe T. flavidus pufferfish used in the present study was from inbred lines produced through several generations of sister–brother mating at the Ocean and Fishery Sciences Research Institute of Hebei Province, China. One individual was randomly selected from the population of inbred for dissection and sampling.2.2. Genome sequencingGenomic DNA was extracted from the muscle sample of a 2-yr-old male T. flavidus using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen), and fragmented using the HydroShear DNA Shearing system (Digilab). Mate-pair libraries with average insert sizes of 1, 3 and 7 kb were constructed following the SOLiD 4 Library Preparation Guide (Applied Biosystems), respectively. Templated bead preparation was performed using the SOLiD EZ Bead system (Applied Biosystems). P2-enriched beads were quantified using Nanodrop-2000 (Thermo) and sequenced on the SOLiD 4 Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). The raw sequencing reads were submitted to NCBI Short Read Archive under the accession number SRA059136.2.3. Genome assemblyRaw reads were error-corrected by the SOLiD Accuracy Enhancer Tool and mapped to the genome of T. rubripes (release 4.66 from Ensembl) using the Bioscope software (Applied Biosystems). The intersection of all sequence variants [reported as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and Indels] was extracted from the alignment results of three libraries. Home-made Perl scripts were used for revising the genome of T. rubripes to obtain an ‘intermediate reference’ (IR), which was used as the reference in the next run of alignment step from which new SNPs and Indels were extracted from. The procedure was iterated until no more SNPs and Indels were found. From the result of the latest alignment, consecutive regions that meet the threshold values (length >100 bp, mismatch bases of seed =2 bp, mismatch bases of alignment =4 bp and coverage >7×) were extracted for contig construction. HAPS (Hybrid Assembly Pipeline with SOLiD reads, http://abcommunity.lifetechnologies.com/docs/DOC-1316) was used for the following scaffolding and gap-filling steps. This whole-genome shotgun project has been deposited at DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank under the accession number AOOT00000000. The assembly described in this paper is the first version, AOOT01000000.2.4. Genome sequence syntenyA home-made Perl script was used to extract all scaffolds with length above 10 kb in the genomes of T. flavidus, T. rubripes and Tetraodon nigroviridis. The scaffold sequences were aligned by MUMmer (version 3.0).14 The alignment command was ‘nucmer --mum -c 400 -l 150’ for T. flavidus versus T. rubripes and ‘promer --mum -c 40 -g 50 -l 15’ for T. flavidus versus Tetraodon nigroviridis. Alignment was repeated for every combination of scaffolds, and scaffolds were allowed to be rearranged and inverted to achieve max matches. The resulting alignment data were filtered with the delta-filter program of MUMmer.2.5. Repetitive sequence and non-coding RNA gene identificationAll repetitive sequences were identified by the RepeatMasker (version 3.3.0) with the latest RepBase libraries.15 Tandem repeat sequences were also determined using the Tandem Repeat Finder,16 whose results were subsequently summarized by the Tandem Repeats Analysis Program (TRAP).17 Non-coding RNAs were annotated in both the ab initio prediction way and the homologous alignment way. Rfam18 and miRBase19 were searched using BLAST+20 for the ncRNA annotation, and tRNAscan-SE21 was applied for the transfer RNA (tRNA) annotation.2.6. Potential protein-encoding gene prediction and functional analysisGene prediction was performed by automatic gene assignment programmes that combined ab initio gene finding and extrinsic evidence prediction. Augustus22 was trained by the genome annotation of T. rubripes and fed with the transcriptome sequencing data of T. flavidus as ‘hints’ for the protein-encoding gene prediction. The protein-encoding gene prediction was also performed by GENSCAN23 with the parameter file of HumanIso.smat. All gene predictions were evaluated and combined into consensus gene structures by the EVidenceModeler.24 The predicted peptide sequences were aligned to the ‘nr’ database of NCBI using Blastp with an E-value of 1e-5. Sequences with length <50 aa or poorly supported by the Blast hit were discarded. The predicted genes were searched against the InterPro database using InterProScan25 for gene families and functional domain assignment. The local database of Blast2GO26 was used for the GO annotation and the KEGG pathway retrieve.2.7. Related genome reference informationThe genome and all protein sequences of T. rubripes (v4.66) and Tetraodon nigroviridis (v8.66) were downloaded from Ensembl ftp and used for comparison (http://www.ensembl.org/info/data/ftp/index.html).3. Results and discussion3.1. Assembly and sequence analysis of the T. flavidus genomeThree mate-pair libraries with average insert sizes of 1, 3 and 7 kb were sequenced and generated 426.3, 154.9 and 177.9 million paired-end reads with read length of 2 × 50 bp, respectively. The genome size was estimated to be ~390 Mb using K-mer counting. The total sequencing length was 75,920 Mb, covering ~195-fold of the whole genome.During the assisted assembling (Supplementary Data), 779,694 SNPs and 156,376 Indels with combined length of 1,779,694 and 1,075,154 bp, respectively, were used as a guide of the genome revision to obtain IR. A total of 511.6 million reads, corresponding to 131.2-fold of the genome, were successfully mapped to IR. Based on the alignment result, 241,314 contigs longer than 100 bp were constructed (Table 1). The longest contig was of 36,127 bp, and the total length of contigs was of 313,590,395 bp. The N50 size of contigs was 2,774 bp. Assembly statisticsAssembly statisticsScaffolding and gap filling were performed using the mate-pair information to interlink the contigs and cover the gaps as many as possible. As a result, 31,086 gaps from low similarity regions were successfully filled among the total 208,550 gaps (Supplementary Data). There were 50,947 scaffolds with the combined length of 384,451,902 bp and N50 size of 305,741 bp, which covered >95% of the whole genome (Table 1 and Supplementary Data). Thirty-five scaffolds were with length longer than 1 Mb, among which the longest was 2,799,124 bp. The average GC content of T. flavidus genome was 45.2% (Fig. 1), which was very close to that of T. rubripes genome (45.5%) and slightly lower than that of Tetraodon nigroviridis genome (46.3%). In addition, the GC-rich and GC-poor regions in the genome of T. flavidus were slightly less than those of T. rubripes and Tetraodon nigroviridis (Fig. 1).

This figure appears in colour in the online version of DNA Research.The sequence synteny was evaluated by comparing the T. flavidus assembly with the genome of T. rubripes and Tetraodon nigroviridis, respectively. There were 2,469 scaffolds of T. flavidus (total length was 348.0 Mb) aligned to the 1,996 scaffolds of T. rubripes (total length was 366.9 Mb) and 4,027 scaffolds of Tetraodon nigroviridis (total length was 284.9 Mb), respectively. For T. flavidus versus T. rubripes, there was a high level of colinearity (Fig. 2A). Most scaffolds of T. flavidus were aligned with scaffolds of T. rubripes, whereas only a small number of them had no homologous sequences. For T. flavidus versus Tetraodon nigroviridis, the colinearity was not obvious at DNA level, but clearly visible at protein level (Fig. 2B). The result demonstrated the conservation among the genomes of pufferfish, especially that between T. flavidus and T. rubripes from the same genus.

This figure appears in colour in the online version of DNA Research.It is usually computationally demanding and even impossible to assemble the genomes of higher organisms with short reads due to the larger genome size and repetitive sequences.27 Hybrid assembly was a widely used strategy that extensively used longer sequencing reads with higher cost.28,29 In the present study, the genome of T. flavidus was assembled only with the SOLiD short reads following the assisted assembly strategy. The N50 size of contigs was 2.8 kb, N50 size of scaffolds was 305.7 kb and >95% of genome was covered by gap-including scaffolds, exhibiting that the assembly effect was comparable with that of the hybrid assembly strategy.3.2. Repetitive sequencesA total of 26.5 Mb sequences were identified as repetitive sequences, which accounted for 6.87% of the total genome of T. flavidus. There were 46.9% repetitive sequences with length from 2 to 10 bp, and their combined length was 12.4 Mb. The di-, tri- and tetranucleotide simple sequence repeats (SSRs) took up 26.1, 7.9 and 11.0% of the identified SSRs, respectively. (CA)n, (GCA)n and (ATCC)n were the most common SSR patterns, each representing 83.0% of dinucleotide, 24.4% of trinucleotide and 26.6% of tetranucleotide SSRs, respectively (Supplementary Data). RepeatMasker analysis showed 4.81% of genome matched interspersed repeats (Table 2). The most abundant repeats classification was the retroelement [class I transposable elements (TE)], of which the major components were the L2/CR1/Rex type LINEs (1.64%) and the RTE/Bov-B type LINEs (0.50%). Repetitive sequences in the genome sequences of T. flavidusRepetitive sequences in the genome sequences of T. flavidusThe proportion of repeats in the T. flavidus genome was greater than that in the Tetraodon nigroviridis genome, which was the most compact vertebrate genome (4.51%), and slightly less than that in the T. rubripes (7.40%). It indicated that the compactness of the T. flavidus genome was close to the genome of T. rubripes, but less than the genome of Tetraodon nigroviridis. The results also showed that class I TE was the major repetitive sequences in all the three pufferfish genomes, and the L2/CR1/Rex type LINEs constituted the major component of the class I, whereas the Tc1-IS630-Pogo type transposons constituted the major component of the class II TE. The high diversity of retrotransposons has been observed in the genomes of other fishes like zebrafish Danio rerio and regarded as a characteristic feature of fish genomes.30 The repetitive sequence repertoires of the three pufferfish species were conserved not only in the diversity but also in the copy number, which indicated that the divergence of the pufferfish lineage occurred not long ago and the evolutionary pressures might lead to the preservation of the repeats identified in the present study.3.3. Non-coding RNA genesThere were 659 putative tRNA genes identified in the genomic sequences. Among them, 54 genes were probable pseudogenes due to incomplete open reading frames (ORFs), and the remaining 605 tRNA genes corresponding to 50 species of anticodons were sufficient for translation of all amino acids (Table 3 and Supplementary Data). In addition, there were 75 genes for 69 species of snoRNA, 86 for 12 species of snRNA (U-RNA), 115 for 5S RNA and 19 for SSU rRNA in the genome of T. flavidus. Non-coding RNA genes in the genome sequences of T. flavidusNon-coding RNA genes in the genome sequences of T. flavidusAdditionally, 183 genes for 143 miRNA species were identified in the genome of T. flavidus (Supplementary Data). Among them, 93 miRNA species were also identified in the T. rubripes genome, whereas only 19 miRNA species were identified in the Tetraodon nigroviridis genome. In other words, >53% of the miRNA species of T. flavidus were uniquely conserved within the Takifugu genus, indicating that these genes might emerge after the appearance of Takifugu pufferfish. Meanwhile, the copy numbers of the 20 most abundant miRNA species in the T. flavidus genome were compared with that in the T. rubripes genomes. There were six miRNA species with the same copy number (mir-124-3, mir-135a-1, mir181b-1, mir190, mir190b and mir-375). However, the copy number variations were detected for the remaining 14 miRNA species, and all of them were more abundant in the T. flavidus genome. Since miRNAs played important regulatory roles by targeting mRNAs for cleavage or translational repression,31 the higher copy number of the conserved miRNA species in T. flavidus indicated that its gene expressions were under more rigorous monitoring. It could also be deduced that the recruitment of miRNA genes had been ongoing with speciation in the Takifugu lineage.3.4. Protein-encoding genesThe current T. flavidus gene catalogue was composed of 30,285 protein-encoding genes. Among them, 29,192 genes were complete models with both the start codon and the stop codon, whereas the remaining 1,093 genes were with incomplete ORFs. The longest protein product was of 13,255 aa, and the shortest was of 50 aa. More than 33.7% of the protein products (10,206/30,285) had the sizes above the average length of 517.9 aa. The number of exons per gene was 7.2 on average. In addition, 75% of introns were below 543 bp in size (Q3 value), and the most common intron size was 76 bp (the modal value). By comparing the predicted gene repertoire with gene sets assembled from transcriptome sequencing data,32 only 16 predicted exons (~0.0%) and 336 predicted introns (~0.2%) were missed in the transcriptome. In addition, a total of 29,710 novel exons and 2,839 novel introns were present on the transcriptome. The comparison results confirmed the accuracy of gene prediction and also indicated that there were more transcript isoforms in T. flavidus than expected.The set of protein-encoding genes in T. flavidus was more similar in the number and size distribution as that in T. rubripes (33,609 protein products with an average length of 501.0 aa) than that in Tetraodon nigroviridis (22,400 protein products with an average length of 545.8 aa).9,10 Although the modal values of intron sizes in T. flavidus and T. rubripes were quite similar (76 and 79 bp, respectively), there was an interesting diversity that the Q3 value of intron sizes in T. flavidus was greater than that in T. rubripes and Tetraodon nigroviridis by 68 and >300 bp, respectively, suggesting that T. flavidus possessed slightly longer introns than the other two pufferfish.A similarity search of protein sequences of the 30,285 presumptive protein-encoding genes was performed with the protein sequences of T. rubripes and Tetraodon nigroviridis, respectively. The alignment result indicated that 27,337 genes (90.3%) and 24,088 genes (79.5%) shared significant similarity with those in the T. rubripes and Tetraodon nigroviridis, respectively (E-value <1e-20). Moreover, a total of 270,803 InterPro annotations that were corresponding to 21,848 protein signatures (protein motifs, functional sites and domains) were retrieved for 26,344 protein-encoding genes (87.0%). There were 957 and 1,285 protein signatures of T. flavidus with >10 gene copy number variance comparing with T. rubripes and Tetraodon nigroviridis, respectively (Supplementary Data). Among them, 60.4% (578/957) were more abundant than that of T. rubripes, whereas only 28.1% (361/1,285) were more abundant than that of Tetraodon nigroviridis. There were 221 protein signatures in T. flavidus, which were more abundant than that in both T. rubripes and Tetraodon nigroviridis, such as the fibronectin type III superfamily (SSF49265) and SET domain superfamily (SSF82199), whereas 253 protein signatures were less abundant than that in both T. rubripes and Tetraodon nigroviridis such as the neurotransmitter-gated ion-channel transmembrane superfamily (SSF90112). The majority of protein signatures in T. flavidus have a similar copy number with that in T. rubripes and Tetraodon nigroviridis. Since the genome of the genus Takifugu is very compact, the functional genes are supposed to be under high evolutionary pressures, and the pseudogenes often with copy number variation only account for a very small proportion. As for the more or less abundant genes, the copy number variance might be related to unique characteristic such as the muscle composition of T. flavidus.A total of 51,990 GO annotations were assigned, and 15,813 of all protein-encoding genes were classified into the biological process, molecular function and cellular component categories (Fig. 3). In the level 2 biological process category, cellular process (19.0%), metabolic process (17.2%) and biological regulation (14.0%) accounted for the major portion, whereas the molecular function category and cellular component category were mainly consisted of binding (51.7%) and cell (54.5%), respectively. There were 117 metabolic pathways affiliated by the presumptive protein-encoding genes of T. flavidus in the KEGG database (data not shown).

Characteristic features of the genes in T. flavidusIn the present study, 16 genes were identified to be involved in the pigment biosynthesis, including 3 CSF-1 receptor orthologs, 3 tyrosinase orthologs, 8 tetrahydrobiopterin synthase orthologs and 4 GTP cyclohydrolase orthologs (two genes were also tetrahydrobiopterin synthase orthologs). They were important components of the two major pigment synthesis pathways in teleost fish: the melanin and the pteridine pathways, which played important roles in the generation of black and yellow pigments, respectively.33 In teleost fish, the pigment granules were distributed in either microtubule-dependent or microtubule-independent ways.34,35 In the T. flavidus genome, there were 116 genes involved in the microtubule-dependent transport system, including the plectin and dynein orthologous genes (Supplementary Data), and 108 genes were with complete ORFs. It was interesting that 12 dynein orthologous genes were aligned in the SCAFFOLD_0437, suggesting the tandem duplication of these genes. The corresponding sequences that shared sequence similarity with the dynein orthologous genes distributed in at least five scaffolds (scaffold_144, scaffold_214, scaffold_286, scaffold_371 and scaffold_440) of the T. rubripes genome, but none of them contains more than two copies of dynein orthologous genes. On the contrary, there were only 58 microtubule-related genes in the genome of T. rubripes. The identified genes confirmed the mechanisms of the pigment development and colour pattern formation in teleost fish, and the expansion of microtubule-related genes in T. flavidus suggested that the enhanced transport capacity provided by the microtubule-dependent pigment transport system might play an important role in the colour pattern variation during the growth of T. flavidus.There were a batch of genes involved in the growth and development through hormonally mediated pathways in the teleost fish, such as insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) and growth hormone (GH) axis.36 The growth rate and appetite were obviously enhanced in the GH-transgenic coho salmon, according to previous studies.37 In the genome of T. flavidus, there were 718 genes from 9 species of growth factors and corresponding receptors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), transforming growth factor (TGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), nerve growth factor (NGF), insulin-like growth factor (IGF), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), as well as 8 genes of GHs and 7 genes of the somatostatin (GH-inhibiting hormone) (Table 4). Comparing with the T. rubripes and Tetraodon nigroviridis genomes, the gene copy numbers of VEGF and VEGF receptors in T. flavidus were significantly greater, which participated in blood vessel formation (angiogenesis). It might hint that the angiogenesis function was more activated in T. flavidus, but conclusion can only be made upon further evidence. Surprisingly, there was no significant difference in most growth factors/hormone-related gene copies among the three pufferfish. EGF and PDGF even had more gene copies in Tetraodon nigroviridis, which had the smallest body size. It was reasonable to believe that the body size was determined and regulated by alternative genes. At the same time, there was an interesting finding that the genes potentially encoding proteins with the Brinker DNA-binding domain (BrkDBD) existed in both the T. flavidus and Tetraodon nigroviridis genomes, whereas none was found in T. rubripes. In T. flavidus, 40 of the 42 Brinker-encoding genes were with complete ORFs and distributed in 38 scaffolds of T. flavidus. Structure comparison between BrkDBD coding genes of T. flavidus (including exons and introns) and genome sequences of T. rubripes was also performed (Fig. 4). The data showed that even sharing a high level of sequence similarity in total, there is no complete homologous sequences of the BrkDBD coding gene distributed in a single scaffold of T. rubripes. Instead, the homologous sequences distribute into multiple scaffolds of T. rubripes. It is most likely due to the species difference, not assembly artefacts, since the BrkDBD coding regions are supported by transcriptome data as well. Among them, 30 BrkDBD-encoding regions were hit by the transcriptome sequencing data of T. flavidus,32 whereas none was observed in the transcriptome of T. rubripes. In Tetraodon nigroviridis, there were five BrkDBD-encoding genes located in the same chromosome. The Brinker is a transcription repressor of the activated targets of decapentaplegic (Dpp), whose gradient resulted in significantly increased tissue size and cell amounts.38 The Dpp/Brinker system was a well-known regulator of tissue growth and size.39,40 There was likelihood that the smaller body size and slow growth rate of T. flavidus and Tetraodon nigroviridis were regulated by the Brinker-encoding genes.

More importantly, they are the major source of metabolic energy for growth, reproduction, swimming and migration in teleost fish rather than carbohydrates which are mainly utilized in mammals.41 In the genome of T. flavidus, there were a total of 394 genes involved in the lipid metabolism, including 185 genes in the lipid digestion, 12 in the lipid absorption, 154 in the extracellular and intracellular transport, 38 in the biosynthesis and catabolism and 5 in the mobilization (Supplementary Data). No significant variation was observed for the copy numbers of the most lipid metabolism-related genes in T. flavidus (short-distance migration puffer) comparing with that in the T. rubripes (long-distance migration puffer). In the genome of T. flavidus, there were one adiponectin receptor gene and one noradrenaline transporter gene both involved in the mobilization of the lipids, whereas none was found in the genome of T. rubripes. The potential coding sequences found in T. flavidus were then aligned to the T. rubripes genome with blastn (E-value = 1e-20), revealing 5 and 7 scaffolds of T. rubripes sharing significant similarity, respectively (Fig. 5). Taken the adiponectin receptor gene for example, the homologous sequences for the first ~6 kb are distributed in scaffold_202 of T. rubripes, and the majority of the left region (after ~7 kb) is distributed in scaffold_8 of T. rubripes. The dispersed distribution led to the fact that no complete coding DNA sequence (CDS) of these two genes can be found in T. rubripes. However, the adiponectin receptor gene was identified in both transcriptomes when mapped onto the T. flavidus genome with a similar expression level in T. flavidus and T. rubripes. One reasonable explanation is that the T. rubripes assembly is still incomplete, which caused difficulty of CDS searching and protein prediction, so the adiponectin receptor gene should exist and be activated in both T. flavidus and T. rubripes. In addition, 20 of 24 exons of the potential noradrenaline transporter-encoding gene were found in the transcriptome of T. flavidus, but only 2 exons were hit by the transcriptome of T. rubripes. It was possibly only caused by mismatch, because only two exons were hit and expression levels were quite low. The transcriptome data confirmed the possibility that the noradrenaline transporter gene has a higher expression level in T. flavidus, even if there is complete CDS in T. rubripes. It was known that noradrenaline regulated the energy supply by stimulating the triacylglycerol hydrolysis and fatty acid oxidation.41 Therefore, it might be an implication of the particular lipid utilization mechanisms for the short-distance migration of T. flavidus, comparing with the long-distance migration pufferfish.

ConclusionsThe genome of T. flavidus pufferfish was sequenced by the SOLiD 4 platform, and the short reads were assembled using the assisted assembly strategy. The draft genome was of 384.5 Mb, comprising 50,947 scaffolds with an N50 value of 305.7 kb. The assisted assembly in the present study achieved a rival result comparing with the hybrid assembly in cooperation with longer reads, but at much lower cost. It can be applied to the genome assembling of species whichever had a closely related reference. The genome analysis revealed that T. flavidus has a lack of repetitive sequences, and the compactness was similar with the genome of T. rubripes. There were 30,285 presumptive protein-encoding genes in the genome. Through functional analysis of genes, the presumable genes involving in the characteristic features of T. flavidus including the colour pattern variation during growth, the relatively slow growth rate and the possible lipid metabolism mechanisms for short-distance migration were identified. The genome information reported in the present study provides a valuable platform for further studies of pufferfish and possesses significant importance in aquaculture industry and scientific research.FundingThis research was supported by High Technology Project (863 Program, No. 2014AA093501) from the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology.

IntroductionHopanoids are a group of natural pentacyclic triterpenoid lipids widely distributed in plant and bacterial systems, act as cell membrane rigidifiers, analogues to sterols present in eukaryotes which have tetracyclic rings. Apart from their biological occurrence, hopanoids were also observed in geo-sediments (geohopanoids) formed due to diagenetic processes and are considered as ‘molecular fossils’ for ancient bacteria.1 Till date, ~200 structures of hopanoids are identified from bio-/geo-sources.2 Hopanoids play a key role in conferring membrane integrity under extreme conditions of stress and any loss in hopanoids makes the bacterium sensitive due to weakening of outer membrane integrity.3,4 Hopanoids are synthesized from six isopentenyl units forming squalene, an immediate precursor in hopanoid synthesis.5 In a highly complex cyclization reaction which is similar to oxido squalene to sterols conversion, the hopane skeleton is formed from squalene by the squalene hopene cyclase coded by the gene shc.5 Though the occurrence of shc gene is widespread among bacteria, there is limited information on the hopanoids identified from different members.1Among the hopanoids of phototrophic bacteria, much of the work was focused on Rhodopseudomonas palustris TIE-1, which accumulates substantial amounts of diploptene, diplopterol, aminobacteriohopanetriol and 2ß-methyl-bacteriohopanepoyol.6 A large diversity of hopanoids occur in a recently described photosynthetic proteobacterium, Rhodomicrobium udaipurense JA643T belonging to the family Hyphomicrobiaceae.7 There are nine genomes sequenced from the family Hyphomicrobiaceae in the class Alphaproteobacteria (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/MICROBES/microbial_taxtree.html), and the genus Rhodomicrobium has two recognized species names; R. vannielii and R. udaipurense, which are phototrophic.7 While R. vannielii ATCC17100T could tolerate solvent stress and degrade aromatic hydrocarbons, R. udaipurense JA643T was psychrotolerant with diverse metabolic capabilities.7,8 To assess the metabolic potentials with particular reference to the hopanoid biosynthetic genes of R. udaipurense JA643T, we have sequenced the whole genome of this bacterium. The present genome sequence will expand our understanding of hopanoid biosynthesis and provide more insights into the role of hopanoids in R. udaipurense JA643T.2. Materials and methods2.1. Organism and DNA preparationRhodomicrobium udaipurense JA643T was grown photoheterotrophically in light with 2,400 lux at 30°C  for 48 h maintaining micro-anaerobic conditions in the screw cap test tube. Culture was grown in liquid mineral medium with pyruvate as carbon source.9 DNA was isolated with the QIAamp minikit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The authenticity of the genome was confirmed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, which was done as previously described.102.2. Genome sequencing and annotationsGenome sequencing was outsourced to the NxGenBio Life Sciences (India). In brief, genomic DNA was fragmented using Covaris system for a mean size range of 300–350 bp. Genomic DNA shotgun library was prepared using standard Illumina TruSeq protocol. Sequencing was carried out using Illumina Hiseq 2X 100 bp paired end chemistry. Two sequencing runs in total were carried out. The quality of raw reads was checked by fastQC (www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). The raw reads were trimmed by fastx toolkit (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/). The sequence data were de novo assembled using Newbler assembly software. Annotations were performed with de novo assembled sequence using the RAST (Rapid Annotation using Subsystem Technology) servers.11 tRNA and rRNA were predicted using RNAmmer.12In silico DNA–DNA hybridization was carried out using formula 2 of GGDC website server (http://ggdc.dsmz.de/).Average nucleotide identity (ANI) was calculated using ANI calculator (http://enve-omics.ce.gatech.edu/ani/). SpecI server was used to confirm the species identification.13 Phylogenetic tree was constructed by MEGA 5 software.14 The sequence data were also mapped to the reference sequence of R. vannielii ATCC 17100T using Burrows Wheel Aligner (BWA version 0.7.5). The reference genome sequence of R. vannielli ATCC17100T (GCA_000166055.1) was taken from NCBI. The reference genome map was generated using CGView server.152.3. Extraction and characterization of hopanoid by GC–MSCells were grown photoheterotrophically as previously described by Venkata et al.7 with pyruvate (34 mM) as carbon source. Cells were pelleted at 8,000g for 10 min at 4°C. Hopanoids were extracted according to Welender et al.4 In brief, cells were sonicated in 10 ml methanol:dichloromethane (DCM):water (10:5:4) and centrifuged at 3,000g for 10 min. Supernatant was transferred to a new tube; sonication was repeated one more time and the supernatants were pooled. Ten millilitres of water and DCM were added to the supernatant and centrifuged at 3,000g for 10 min. The organic phase was combined and evaporated to dryness. Hopanoids were derivatized by acetic anhydride:pyridine (1:1) and analysed by GC–MS (Agilent 7890). Separation was achieved using DB-1HT column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d.; 0.1 µm film thickness) with helium as carrier gas. Ramping program was started with 100°C (held for 2 min), then ramped from 100 to 200°C at 10°C min-1 and from 200 to 360°C at 6°C min-1 (held for 10 min). The system was operated with the following parameters: electron voltage 70 eV, source temperature 200°C, interface temperature 350°C and acquisition delay for 120 s. Mass spectrometer was operated in full-scan mode (m/z 30–1,000).3. Results and discussion13.7 million reads of 101 bp long were obtained after sequencing the genome of R. udaipurense JA643T. Raw reads were trimmed and assembled into 256 contigs having 3,649,277 bp (3.64 Mb) in total. The largest contig size was 103,250 bp, and N50 of contig was 26,179 bp. However, the Newbler software predicted that the genome size of R. udaipurense JA643T would be ~3.8 Mb. Thus, genome sequence has revealed 96% of the whole genome, with an average G + C content of 62.4 mol% and 3,611 open-reading frames (ORFs). The protein coding bases were 3,000,076 bp in total, covering 82.21% of the total bases determined. It contains 68 tRNAs and 3 rRNA (Table 1). General features of Rhodomicrobium udaipurense JA643T draft genome sequenceGeneral features of Rhodomicrobium udaipurense JA643T draft genome sequenceThough R. udaipurense JA643T and R. vannielii ATCC17100T have 100% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, based on genome relatedness (46.1% after DNA–DNA hydridization) and phenotypic traits, these were described as two different species.7 Delineation of the two species was further confirmed by in silico regression DDH analysis of the whole genomes, and the determined value of 58.6% is much lower than the gold standard value of 70% for delineation of bacterial species.16 Further, SpecI analysis using 40 phylogenetic marker genes (pMGs) also indicated an average identity (Supplementary Data) of 94.69% which concludes a clear delineation between the two species.13 Calculated ANI value of 95.26% between the genomes of R. udaipurense JA643T and R. vannielii ATCC17100T strengthens the separation into two species.Protein-coding genes of R. udaipurense JA643T have an average length of 830 bases, ranging from 70 to 4,796 bases. Out of 3,611 ORFs identified, 2,295 (63.55%) were functionally annotated, 1,238 (34.28%) were hypothetical, 64 were putative and 14 were conserved hypothetical genes. Most of the annotated protein coding sequences [~1,367 genes (62.74%)] were involved in metabolic and biosynthetic processes. In addition, 39 genes were involved in cell signaling and regulations, 26 genes in motility and chemotaxis, 119 genes in RNA metabolism, 74 genes in membrane transport, 168 genes in protein metabolism, 109 genes in DNA metabolism, 46 genes into defence, 88 genes in cell wall and capsule formation and 259 genes in other cellular functions, which were not distributed in subsystem category (Supplementary Data and Supplementary Data).When contig sequences of R. udaipurense JA643T were mapped on R. vannielii ATCC17100T genome sequence, only 2,989 genes got mapped, indicating that the remaining 622 genes were diverged from R. vannielii ATCC17100T counterparts or absent in R. vannielii ATCC17100T genome. Rhodomicrobium udaipurense JA643T showed phototrophic growth, and it contained sets of genes for bacteriochlorophyll biosynthesis and a set of light harvesting complexes as well as puf L,M,C,H genes. A set of light harvesting complex gene sequences were observed with one a and a ß gene. For N2 fixation, two types of nitrogenase dimmers, molybdenum-dependent and vanadium-dependent nitrogenase, were present with all related cofactors and accessory genes. Secondary transport system genes included facilitator super family (MFS) transporter, resistance nodulation cell division (RND) pumps, tripartite ATP-dependent periplasmic (TRAP) transporter and organic solvent resistance transporter. The heavy metal efflux transporters and organic solvent resistance transporters present may allow the organism to survive in high concentrations of metals and other solvents.16Rhodomicrobium udaipurense JA643T has the genes involved in the degradation of nitrogen-containing compounds like amino acids and heterocyclic aromatic compounds and may dehalogenate with the help of different monooxygenase, dioxygenase, peroxidases and dehalogenase.Draft genome sequence of R. udaipurense JA643T showed the presence of genes involved in benzoate degradation. Anaerobic benzoate degradation takes place by two known pathways; one occurs through –CoA ligation, while the other by hydroxylation, and R. udaipurense JA643T has genes involved in both the pathways.17 There are 12 genes related to aromatic hydrocarbon metabolism; of these, 6 genes are involved in benzoate degradation through hydroxylation. However, the RAST subsystem classifies genes involved in benzoate degradation through hydroxylation as nonfunctional in this organism. The presence of aromatic hydrocarbon metabolizing genes and utilization of benzoate by R. udaipurense JA643T and R. vannielii ATCC17100T indicate their probable role in the aromatic hydrocarbon recycling in oxic/anoxic environments.1,17Some of homologous sequences unique in R. udaipurense JA643T may compensate the function; sterol-binding domain-containing protein, hemolysins and related proteins containing CBS domain, putative homolysin, myosin cross-reactive streptococcal antigen, cobalt–zinc–cadmium/protein resistance, sporulation domain protein, sperimidine synthase, antibiotic biosynthesis monooxygenase, stage 0 sporulation protein J and sporulation initiation inhibitor protein. The summary of all these genes is given as Supplementary Data.4. Hopanoid biosynthesisInformation on the genes involved in the biosynthesis of hopanoids is limited, and our study mainly focused on the genomic insight of hopanoid biosynthesis in R. udaipurense JA643T.3,4,6 Hopanoids are biosynthesized from isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) which is synthesized either through mevalonate pathway or methyl erythritol phosphate pathway (MEP).18 Genes involved in the MEP pathway are present in R. udaipurense JA643T, and the genes are scattered in the genome (Fig. 1). Only 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate reductase coding gene (ispH) was present in the cluster of seven hopanoid biosynthesis genes. List of seven genes involved in the MEP pathway is given in the Supplementary Data. IPP isomerase catalyzes the conversion of relatively unreactive IPP to electrophile dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP).19 Farnesyldiphosphate synthase (ispA/ispB) catalyzes the formation of (2Z, 6E)-farnesyl diphosphate from three IPP.20 Squalene synthase (hpnC/hpnD) catalyzes stepwise tail-to-tail addition of farnesyl diphosphate (C15) which condenses to form presqualene pyrophosphate, an intermediate product.5 Presqualene pyrophosphate is converted to squalene (I) by squalene synthase (hpnC/hpnD). Squalene synthase (hpnC/hpnD) is homologous to phytoene synthase (involved in carotenoid biosynthesis) and the function of hpnC/hpnD in the hopanoid biosynthesis is poorly understood.21,22Figure 1.Open in new tabDownload slideLocation of the hopanoid biosynthetic genes in the genome of Rhodomicrobium udaipurense JA643T.

These genes encode radical SAM protein (hpnH), adenosine nucleosidase (hpnG), squalene hopene cyclase (shc/hpnF), squalene-associated, FAD-dependent desaturase (hpnE/crtI), squalene synthase (hpnD and hpnC) and glycosyltransferase family protein (hpnB). Ten additional genes involved in hopanoid biosynthesis were scattered in the genome. The region having hopanoid biosynthetic genes and their upstream and downstream regions are shown in Fig. 1. The fragmented organization of the genes indicates the complex regulatory network of hopanoid biosynthesis. Squalene (I), hop-22(29)-ene (II), diplopterol (III), tetrahymanol (IV), 2-methyldiploptetrol (VI), adenosylhopane (VII), bacteriohopanetetrol (XI), aminobacteriohopanetetrol (XII), N-tryptophanyl aminobacteriohopanetetrol (XV) were identified through GC–MS analysis (Fig. 2), and their structures are given in Supplementary Data.

Cyclization of squalene (I) into the pentacyclic tripterpenoid is one of the complex processes catalyzed by squalene hopene cyclase (shc/hpnF). A single enzyme catalyzes the stepwise formation of 13 covalent bonds and 9 stereo centres.5 Accumulation of squalene (I) by <U+0394>shc mutant could not produce hopanoids including tetrahymanol (IV),4 suggesting the role of shc gene in the biosynthesis of tetrahymanol (IV) as well. Phylogenetic tree using 339 shc genes from different microorganisms showed (Supplementary Data) a distinct clade for Rhodomicrobium spp. and has a sequence similarity of 97% between shc genes of R. udaipurense JA643T and R. vannielii ATCC17100T (Table 2). Genes involved in the hopanoid biosynthesis pathwayaSimilarity with respective genes of Rhodomicrobium vannielii ATCC17100T.Genes involved in the hopanoid biosynthesis pathwayaSimilarity with respective genes of Rhodomicrobium vannielii ATCC17100T.hpnP encoding 2-methyltransferase was not identified in the draft genome sequence of R. udaipurense JA643T. However, identification of a methylated hopanoid (2-methyldiplopterol; Fig 2) indicates the presence of hpnP gene in R. udaipurense JA643T which might have not been covered in the draft genome sequence. The hop-22(29)-ene (II) is further converted to adenosylhopane (VII) by the radical SAM protein (hpnH) required for the addition of adenosine to hopane skeleton. hpnH gene product is a B12-binding radical SAM protein, and mutation in hpnH resulted in the production of C30 hopanoids (diploptene and diplopterol).6 Removal of adenine moiety from adenosylhopane (VII) carried out by adenosylhopane nucleoside/hopanoid-associated phosphorylase, encoded by hpnG gene (a putative nucleoside hydrolase) lead to the formation of ribosylhopane (VIII). Mutation in hpnG gene resulted in loss in the synthesis of bacteriohopanetetrol (XI) and aminobacteriohopanetriol (XII), and consequently an intermediate adenosylhopane (VII) was accumulated.6A lactone hopanoid, ribosylhopane (VIII), was identified as an intermediate in the biosynthesis of C35 hopanoids.23 The lactone ring of this hopanoid could be opened via a lactone hydrolysis, a reaction which is similar to the hydrolysis of the quorum-sensing molecule (acylhomeserine lactone [AHL]) by acylhomoserine lactonase.24 However, gene O-acylhomoserine lactonase was not observed in the draft genome of R. udaipurense JA643T. The lactone ring of hopanoid might be opened via oxidation to form putative ribonylhopane (IX) precursor.25 The presence of ribonylhopane (IX) in some R. palustris mutants suggested that the biosynthesis of the C35 hopanoids would require an oxidation of the ribosylhopane (VIII) produced by the hpnG to form ribonylhopane (IX).6 The pathway may proceed with the interconversion of ribonylhopane (IX) to formylhopane (X), because ribonylhopane (IX) is less reactive, whereas formylhopane (X) is more reactive. In the GC–MS analysis, ribosylhopane (VIII), ribonylhopane (IX) and formylhopane were not detected. The gene involved in the interconversion of ribosylhopane to formylhopane is also not yet known.Formylhopane (X) may undergo reductive amination leading to the formation of an amino group containing hopanoid, aminobacteriohopanetriol (XII).26 Knockout study of ornithine: oxo-acid aminotransferase (hpnO) showed that it was involved in the formation of aminobacteriohopanetriol (XII).6hpnO bears homology with N-acetylornithine aminotransferase (ArgD). ArgD acts on an aldehyde rather than a hydroxyl group supporting the idea that the formylhopane (X) is more likely to be the correct substrate. In GC–MS analysis, N-tryptophanyl-35-aminobacteriohopane-32,33,34-triol was observed, in which amino acid residue is linked to the amino group of aminobacteriohopanetriol, indicating that there is a modification of aminobacteriohopanetriol in R. udaipurense JA643T. The genes involved in the synthesis of bacteriohopanetetrol and N-tryptophanyl-35-aminobacteriohopane-32,33,34-triol are not yet known, but products were identified in GC–MS analysis.Sterol desaturase (erg32/hpnX) gene was present on contig no. 30 in the genome of R. udaipurense JA643T from 959,672 to 958,896 bp. Upstream and downstream regions are shown in Fig. 1. Sterol desaturase family protein known to catalyze formation of a C-5 double bond in the B ring of ergosterol. erg32 is involved in the biosynthesis of ergosterol which is important for the plasma membrane structure, function and localization of the plasma membrane proteins. However, in R. udaipurense JA643T sterols are not present. As hopanoids are the sterol surrogates and some hopanoids with double bond at C6 and C11 positions were reported previously (XIV),27 it is hypothesized that sterol desaturase (hpnX) might be responsible for the incorporation of double bond in the hopanoids.hpnI/hpnB genes are associated with hopanoid glycosyltransferase, and glycosylated hopanoids were identified with Geobacter sulfurreducens and Geobacter metallireducens.28,29 Hopanoids with glycosyl moiety is expected in R. udaipurense JA643T since hpnI/hpnB genes were observed in the genome of this organism; however, no glycosyl group containing hopanoids were detected in the GC–MS analysis. hpnC, hpnD and hpnE genes are involved in the modification of squalene. hpnE is a squalene-associated, FAD-dependent desaturase which has oxidoreductase activity. Perzl et al. suggested that it might be involved as an oxidoreductase in hopanoid or terpenoid biosynthesis pathways.21 However, its role in hopanoid biosynthesis is not understood. Gene hpnA encode for NAD-dependent nucleoside diphosphate–sugar epimerase/dehydrates protein, which was not observed in the draft genome of R. udaipurense JA643T. Hopanoid biosynthetic genes between R. udaipurense JA643T and R. vannielii ATCC17100T were compared. Sequence similarity ranges from 95 to 99% between them (Table 2, Supplementary Data). The hopanoid biosynthetic pathway was then inferred based on the genes identified, experimental validation of hopanoid molecules and available literature (Fig. 3).3,4,15–30Figure 3.Open in new tabDownload slideSchematic representation of hopanoid biosynthetic pathway in Rhodomicrobium udaipurense JA643T based on genes identified, GC–MS analysis and previous reports.3,4,15–26,30 This figure appears in colour in the online version of DNA Research.Figure 3.Open in new tabDownload slideSchematic representation of hopanoid biosynthetic pathway in Rhodomicrobium udaipurense JA643T based on genes identified, GC–MS analysis and previous reports.3,4,15–26,30 This figure appears in colour in the online version of DNA Research.Schematic representation of hopanoid biosynthetic pathway in Rhodomicrobium udaipurense JA643T based on genes identified, GC–MS analysis and previous reports.3,4,15–26,30 This figure appears in colour in the online version of DNA Research.Schematic representation of hopanoid biosynthetic pathway in Rhodomicrobium udaipurense JA643T based on genes identified, GC–MS analysis and previous reports.3,4,15–26,30 This figure appears in colour in the online version of DNA Research.Apart from hopanoid biosynthetic genes, few genes playing a key role in localization of hopanoids, hopanoid regulation and transportation were also observed in R. udaipurense JA643T. One such gene is hopanoid-associated RND transporter (hpnN) which encodes an RND-like transporter that helps to localize hopanoids to the outer membrane. hpnN and hpnO were located close together with a gene coding for hypothetical protein in between. <U+0394>hpnN mutant no longer contain any hopanoids in the outer membrane, suggesting its importance in hopanoid transportation.31hpnN mutant produces more 2-methylhopanoids, possibly indicating some role for hpnN in hopanoid homeostasis.31 Similarly, extracellular sigma factor (ECF) regulates the methylation of hopanoids at C-2 position.32 Genome sequence of R. udaipurense JA643T showed that it has two RNA polymerase ECF-type sigma factors. Probably these sigma factors may be the regulators for the expression of hpnP gene and production of methylated hopanoids.In summary, genome sequence of R. udaipurense JA643T has a set of genes required for degrading aromatic compounds and resistance to solvents. It has all the machinery required for photosynthesis. There were 18 genes involved in the hopanoid biosynthesis and transport of hopanoids in this organism. The MEP pathway exists in R. udaipurense JA643T which leads to the formation of IPP. Major hopanoids were diploptene, diplopterol, bacteriohopanetetrol, aminobacteriohopanetriol and N-tryptophanyl-35-aminobacteriohopanetriol. Though hpnP gene was not covered in the genome of R. udaipurense JA643T, the presence of methylated hopanoids (Fig. 2) indicates that this gene might be present in the complete genome of this organism. On the other hand, we could not find hpnP gene from the complete genome of R. vannielii ATCC17100T, and this makes the difference in the hopanoids of R. udaipurense JA643T. The genes involved in the formation of amino acid group containing hopanoids need an in-depth investigation.Hopanoid-deficit mutants can grow at optimized laboratory conditions; however, the mutants act differently under stress conditions. Hopanoids confer membrane integrity and help the bacterium to tolerate bile salts, pH, antibiotics and temperature.4 Hopanoids are also important for a bacterium to undergo normal cell cycle.31 However, the role of hopanoids in R. udaipurense JA643T is yet to be revealed, and this part of the work is in progress at our laboratory, while comparisons are also being made with R. vannielii ATCC17100T, whose complete genome sequence is available.4.1.

IntroductionThe eggplant (Solanum melongena L.) is a vegetable crop species belonging to the Solanaceae family, which includes economically important species such as tomato (S. lycopersicum L.), potato (S. tuberosum L.), pepper (Capsicum annuum L.), and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.). The genus Solanum is the largest of the solanaceous genera, being comprised of more than 1,000 species.1 Among the model plants for the Solanaceae family and genus Solanum, extensive efforts have been made to accumulate molecular genetic information about tomato and potato. High-density molecular marker linkage maps2–4 and comprehensive datasets of expressed sequence tags (ESTs)5,6 have been developed for both species. Recently, reference genome datasets have been published for potato7 and tomato,8 and consequently, tomato has obtained the position as the model for plants bearing fleshy fruits.9Eggplants, and the closely related Solanum species belonging to the subgenus Leptostemonum, are some of the most important vegetable crops in Asia, the Middle and Near East, Southern Europe, and Africa10 and are some of the key materials of various cuisines in these countries. The global production of eggplant has been growing and reached 48.4 million tons in 2012, which was roughly one-third of the total production of tomato (FAOSTAT, http://faostat.fao.org). Nevertheless, eggplant has been much less recognized as a target for molecular genetics research than tomato and potato, probably because it is produced and consumed less widely, especially in Western countries, and because, as described by Wu et al.,11 many of the agronomically important traits in eggplant are shared by other solanaceous crops, such as tomato and potato, and in most cases, the genetics of these traits has been investigated in detail in the other two species. However, from the botanical and agronomical points of view, compared with the two Solanum model species, eggplant has many unique aspects including extra-large fruit size, high tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses, and parthenocarpy without any negative pleiotropic effects.12,13 While its nutritional value, such as content of vitamins, has not been considered remarkable, eggplant has recently begun to be reconsidered as a good source of free radical scavengers, such as anthocyanins and phenolics,14,15 from the viewpoint of functional food research. From the phylogenetic aspect, eggplant is indigenous to the Old World, whereas most solanaceous crops are believed to have originated in the Americas,10 and therefore, the accumulation of genetic information about eggplant will not only facilitate molecular understanding of eggplant itself, but will also make this unique species a valuable member of the Solanaceae for comparative biological studies of genetics, physiology, development, and evolution of this taxon.Even though the eggplant has received rather less attention than other model crops as a material for molecular genetics, several research groups have been conducting genetic studies on eggplant over the last two decades. The first DNA marker linkage map for eggplant was developed by applying random amplified polymorphic DNA and amplified fragment length polymorphism markers to an F2 mapping population derived from an intraspecific cross of cultivated eggplant lines.16 Since then, consecutive efforts have been made to accumulate molecular genetic information such as ESTs,17 simple sequence repeats (SSRs),18,19 and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs),20 to develop more detailed linkage maps.21–23 Furthermore, by the development and adoption of orthologous gene-based markers for comparative linkage map analyses, macro-syntenic relationships among the solanaceous species including eggplant have been elucidated in detail.11,24,25 To facilitate our understanding of eggplant genome structure, which is fundamental to the molecular deciphering of complex traits, we performed whole-genome sequencing and construction of a draft genome dataset. The information acquired should accelerate fundamental comparative genomics by building bridges between eggplant, an Old World Solanum species, and tomato, its New World ally.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materialsThe following eggplant materials were used: a pure-bred cultivar ‘Nakate-Shinkuro’, two pure-bred breeding lines ‘AE-P03’ and ‘EPL-1’, and two germplasms ‘LS1934’ and ‘WCGR112-8’. ‘Nakate-Shinkuro’, one of the typical Asian cultivars and one of the founders for modern commercial cultivars, was used for whole-genome shotgun sequencing. ‘AE-P03’ and ‘LS1934’ were used for cDNA preparation for EST sequencing. All lines except for ‘EPL-1’ were used for the genomic DNA sequence capture analysis. A previously reported F2 population, LWF2 (n = 90),24 and a newly developed F2 population, EWF2 (n = 120), were used for the construction of linkage maps. The EWF2 population was derived from a cross between the lines ‘EPL-1’ and ‘WCGR112-8’.2.2. Whole-genome shotgun sequencing and
primary assemblyNuclear DNA purified from the leaves of ‘Nakate-Shinkuro’ by the method of Peterson et al.26 was used for the construction of paired-end (PE; insert size of 200–300 bp) and mate-pair (MP) libraries (insert size of 2 kb) according to the standard protocol (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Sequence analyses were carried out with a HiSeq 2000 sequencer (Illumina) in the PE sequencing mode (101-bases each) at Hokkaido System Science Co. Ltd, Japan. The obtained Illumina reads from PE and MP libraries were trimmed with quality scores of <10 at the 3' termini by using fastq_quality_filter (-q 10 -p 10) and fastq_quality_trimmer (-t 10 -l 21) of the FASTX-Toolkit (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit). The artefacts were removed by applying fastx_artifacts_filter of the FASTX-Toolkit. In addition, the adapter sequences in the Illumina reads were trimmed by using fastx_clipper (-M 5) of the FASTX-Toolkit. The trimmed reads of the PE and MP libraries were assembled by using SOAPdenovo v1.0527 with the default parameters. Based on the result of trial assemblies using a small fastq dataset (~750 Mb) with various k-mer settings (i.e. k = 21, 31, 41, 45, 49, 51, 53, 55, 61, 71, and 81), k-mer size of 51 was adopted for the assembly because it resulted in the longest maximum length of scaffold. The resultant scaffolds were subjected to gap-filling with the Illumina reads by using GapCloser 1.10 (P = 31; http://soap.genomics.org.cn; Fig. 1).

Sequence capture analysis of genic DNASequence reads in genic regions were enriched by sequence capture. First, cDNA sequencing was carried out to append more comprehensive information of the expressed sequences to the Sanger-based ESTs.17 Mature leaf and root samples were collected from LS1934. Samples of flowers at anthesis and immature fruits at 2 weeks after anthesis were harvested from AE-P03. Total RNA was isolated from these four materials separately by using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The four RNA preparations were mixed equally (500 pg each) and then used for cDNA library construction with a Creator-SMART cDNA library construction kit (Takara Bio, Inc., Otsu, Japan). Normalization of cDNA was performed by using a Trimmer-Direct kit (Evrogen, Moscow, Russia). Normalized cDNA was amplified with a 5'-adaptor primer and biotinylated poly-T primer and then fragmented and fractionated by size. Fragments with length 300–800 bp were purified, and the 3'-end fragments were enriched by using the Streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Life Technologies). Library preparation from the normalized and 3'-end-enriched cDNA and the sequence data collection with the Roche 454 GS FLX sequencer (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) were performed by a contractor (Dragon Genomics Co. Ltd, Yokkaichi, Japan) and the resultant raw data were integrated with previously reported Sanger EST data,17 clustered and assembled by using Paracel Transcript Assembler version 2.7 (Paracel, Inc., Pasadena, CA, USA) with the parameter settings of InOverhang = 30, EndOverhang = 30, ClipQual = 10, QualSumLim = 300, PenalizeN = 0, IgnorePolyMaskChars = on, and KeepDups = on. The dataset of the cDNA sequences was named ‘43k EST assembly’.A custom oligonucleotide sequence capture array (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) was designed based on the 43k EST assembly. Enrichment of eggplant genomic DNA corresponding to the cDNA sequences was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions by using mixed DNA samples from four eggplant lines: ‘AE-P03’, ‘LS1934’, ‘Nakate-Shinkuro’, and ‘WCGR112-8’. Captured reads were obtained by using the Roche 454 GS FLX sequencer and assembled by using the Newbler 2.7 software in the genomic mode (Roche Diagnostics). Ambiguous bases that were probably due to the sequence variations among the four lines were revised to bases of ‘Nakate-Shinkuro’ by mapping the Illumina reads to the Newbler assembly with the BWA 0.6.2 software28 with default parameters to complete the ‘Nakate-Shinkuro’ genome assembly (Fig. 1).2.4. Hybrid assembly of the Illumina scaffolds and
Roche contigsThe scaffolds and contigs, respectively, assembled from Illumina HiSeq 2000 and Roche 454 GS FLX reads were subjected to the second-round assembly to obtain hybrid scaffolds by using the PCAP.rep program with 98% identity (-m 10 -l 50 -t 98 -v 0 -y 8).29 Contaminant sequences that showed high sequence homology to vectors (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/vecscreen/univec), the bacterial genomes registered in the NCBI database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), chloroplasts of tomato (accession number NC_007898.2), potato (NC_008096.2), Solanum bulbocastanum (NC_007943.1), or Arabidopsis thaliana (NC_000932.1), or mitochondria of tomato (SOLYC_MT_v1.50, http://www.mitochondrialgenome.org), tobacco (NC_006581.1), or A. thaliana (NC_001284.2), were identified by using BLASTN with an E-value cut-off of 1E-10 and length coverage of =10% and were excluded from the hybrid scaffolds. After recruiting the contigs that showed sequence similarities (according to BLASTN searches with an E-value cut-off of 1E-10) against tomato predicted genes, or against marker-associated sequences located on an integrated eggplant genetic map, LWAE2012 (see subsection 2.6.), the obtained dataset was further connected as super-scaffolds by using the Illumina MP reads and SSPACE 2.0 software (-x 1 -m 50).30 The resultant super-scaffolds, which represented the eggplant genome, were named SME_r2.5.1 (Fig. 1).The gene space coverage of SME_r2.5.1 was estimated from the results of BLAT mapping (minScore = 200, minIdentity = 95, maxIntron = 10,000) by using an eggplant unigene dataset SomeGI Release 1.0 (http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/tgi/cgi-bin/tgi/gimain.pl?gudb=eggplant) as queries against the genome assembly. To validate the accuracy of the assembly of SME_r2.5.1, we conducted similarity searches of SME_r2.5.1 against the nucleotide sequences of two bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones (DDBJ accession numbers: AB917429.1 and EF517791.1) by using the BLAST program with an E-value cut-off of 1E-10, and the percent nucleotide identity was calculated by matcher (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/psa/emboss_matcher/nucleotide.html) in EMBOSS program31 with default parameter settings. The eggplant genome size was estimated by using the KmerFreq_AR in SOAPec v.2.0.1 package (http://soap.genomics.org.cn) with the trimmed Illumina reads at k-mer size of 17.2.5. Repetitive sequence analysisPutative repetitive sequences in SME_r2.5.1 were identified by using the RepeatScout program32 with default parameters. In parallel, known repetitive sequences registered in Repbase33 were identified and masked on SME_r2.5.1 by using the RepeatMasker program (http://www.repeatmasker.org). To detect unique repetitive sequences in eggplant, the masked sequences were further masked by RepeatMasker program against the repetitive sequences identified by RepeatScout. SSR motifs were searched on SME_r2.5.1 by using the SciRoKo software34 in the ‘MISA’ mode with default parameters. These analyses were also carried out on the tomato (SL2.40),8Solanum pimpinellifolium (A-1.0),8 potato (PGSC DM v3.4),7 and tobacco genomes (Niben.v0.4.4).352.6. Genome-wide SNP and SSR discovery and
linkage mappingThe raw data of microarray-captured DNA obtained by using Roche 454 GS FLX (see subsection 2.3.) were assembled by using the MIRA 3.2.1 program (http://www.chevreux.org/projects_mira.html) to predict SNP candidates. The resultant contig sequences, including ‘probable’ SNPs that were high-quality (a Phred score of =50), bi-allelic, and supported by two or more reads, were located in the reference tomato genome SL2.40 based on the results of BLASTN searches with flanking sequences as queries. Marker candidates that would evenly spread across the eggplant genome were then selected according to eggplant–tomato macro-synteny information.24 The GoldenGate array (Illumina) was designed and used for genotyping the SNPs. SSRs (see subsection 3.1.4.) located in probable euchromatic regions in the eggplant genome were selected based on eggplant–tomato macro-synteny information, and allele typing was conducted by using a 3730xl DNA sequencer and GeneMapper software version 3.7 (Life Technologies).A linkage map EW2012 was constructed de novo based on the DNA marker genotype data and data for a single phenotype (corolla colour) obtained from the EWF2 mapping population by using the MAPMAKER/EXP 3.0 software,36 with a logarithm of the odds (LOD) score cut-off of =6.0 (grouping) or =3.0 (ordering) and a maximum distance of =37.2 cM. The data newly obtained from LWF2 were appended to the previously reported data24 to construct an updated map, LW2012. The maps EW2012, LW2012, and previously reported AL2010,24 were then combined by using the JoinMap 4.0 software (Kyazma B.V., Wageningen, The Netherlands) to construct an integrated map, LWAE2012.2.7. Gene prediction and annotationIn SME_r2.5.1, gene coding sequences were predicted by using Augustus 2.7 program37 with a training set of tomato genes, ITAG2.38 and the following parameters: species = tomato, genemodel = partial, protein = on, introns = on, start = on, stop = on, cds = on, codingseq = on, alternatives-from-evidence = true, alternatives-from-sampling = true, gff3 = on, and UTR = on. The predicted genes were classified into four categories, i.e. intrinsic (with start and stop codons), partial (without start codons, stop codons, or both), pseudo (with in-frame stop codons), and short genes (encoding <50 amino acid residues). Transposable elements were inferred according to the results of hmmscan38 against GyDB 2.0 (2.3.2)39 with an E-value cut-off of 1.0, BLASTP40 against the NCBI non-redundant (nr) protein database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) with an E-value cut-off of 1E-10, and InterProScan41 against the InterPro database42 with an E-value cut-off of 1.0. To evaluate the accuracy of the gene prediction, 17,034 coding DNA sequences (CDSs; =150 bp) were predicted by using SomeGI Release 1.0 unigene data and Augustus 2.7 and then used as queries for BLAT mapping (minScore = 150, minIdentity = 95, maxIntron = 10,000) against the sequences of SME_r2.5.1 and the predicted genes in SME_r2.5.1. Genes encoding transfer RNAs were predicted by using tRNAscan-SE version 1.2343 with default parameters.The predicted genes in the eggplant genome together with those in the tomato (ITAG2.3, 34,727 genes), potato (PGSC DM v3.4, 56,218 genes), tobacco (Niben.v0.4.4, 76,379 genes), and A. thaliana genomes (TAIR10, 35,386 genes) were clustered by using the CD-hit program44 with the parameters c = 0.4 and aS = 0.4. Functional domains in the predicted genes were assigned to the plant gene ontology (GO) slim categories by using the map2slim program.45 In parallel, the predicted genes were classified into the ‘euKaryotic clusters of Orthologous Groups’ (KOG) categories46 by conducting BLASTP searches with an E-value cut-off of 1E-20. In addition, the predicted genes were mapped onto the KEGG reference pathways47 by performing BLASTP searches against the KEGG GENES database (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/genes.html) with an E-value cut-off of 1E-10, length coverage of =25%, and identity of =50%.2.8. Comparative analysis of the eggplant and
tomato genomes and genesComparative analyses between eggplant and tomato genomes were performed with both gene-based and genome scaffold-based strategies. For the gene-based approach, reciprocal best-hit relationships were identified between predicted genes in SME_r2.5.1 and those in the tomato genome (ITAG2.3) by using the methods of Fukuoka et al.,24 in which similarity searches were carried out with the Smith–Waterman algorithm of the SSEARCH program.48 For the genome-based comparison, the eggplant super-scaffold sequences were mapped onto the tomato genome SL2.40 by using the BLAT program (minScore = 200, minIdentity = 85, maxIntron = 10,000). In parallel, the DNA markers mapped on LWAE2012 were attributed to the eggplant super-scaffolds by using BLAT. The whole-genome relationship between eggplant and tomato was determined as described below. First, the eggplant super-scaffolds successfully mapped onto the tomato genome were aligned according to the order of the position on the tomato genome. Next, the genome regions conserved between the two species (named ‘synteny blocks’) were identified by checking the order and linkage properties of eggplant DNA markers in the super-scaffolds, and the range and direction of the synteny blocks was determined. Finally, the eggplant super-scaffolds were re-aligned in the order of the deduced eggplant genome organization.3. Results and discussion3.1. Sequencing and assembly of the eggplant genomeIn the whole-genome shotgun sequencing analysis, a total of 977 million and 346 million reads corresponding to 98.7 and 35.0 Gb, respectively, were obtained from the sequencing analysis of PE and MP libraries, respectively, with the Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencer (Supplementary Data). The obtained reads were assembled into 1,321,157 scaffolds of 1,146 Mb total by using SOAPdenovo v1.05, and the gaps in the scaffolds were subsequently filled with the Illumina reads by using GapCloser 1.10. The total length of the gap-filled scaffolds was 1,093 Mb (Supplementary Data).By using the Roche 454 GS FLX sequencer, 519,243 single reads were obtained from a normalized and 3'-end-enriched cDNA fragment library constructed from a mixture of total RNA samples prepared from leaves, roots, immature fruits, and flowers. The raw sequence data have been registered in the DDBJ Sequence Read Archive (DRA001156). The data were combined with 98,086 Sanger EST reads comprised of 2 × 43,474 paired reads obtained from both 5'- and 3'-ends of each cDNA clone and 11,138 single-end reads from either end.17 The dataset was used for clustering and assembly with the Paracel Transcript Assembler to obtain 40,288 contigs and 17,019 singlets (i.e. 57,307 sequences in total). If two paired reads were found in separate contigs or singlets, the pair of contigs or singlets were appropriately oriented and joined with 20 ‘N's. Finally, the 57,307 sequences were integrated into 43,236 unique sequences, i.e. the 43k EST assembly, for use in gene space enrichment by oligonucleotide microarray. The sequence information of the assembly is available at the EST-DB eggplant database of the NARO Institute of Vegetable and Tea Science (NIVTS; http://estdb.nivot.affrc.go.jp).Gene space enrichment by using the EST-based sequence capture array was performed for two purposes: for euchromatic region-directed SNP discovery (see below, subsection 3.1.5.) and for improvement of draft genome assembly by incorporating longer Roche 454 reads. By means of an oligonucleotide microarray-based method, a genomic DNA fragment library enriched for the 43k EST assembly sequences was constructed from a mixture of genomic DNA samples isolated from the four eggplant lines (‘Nakate-Shinkuro’, ‘LS1934’, ‘WCGR112-8’, and ‘AE-P03’). Nucleotide sequence data of 482,154,310 bases from 1,396,184 reads in total obtained by GS FLX sequencing were assembled into 45,786 contigs (38.3 Mb in total length) by using Newbler 2.7. To integrate the contigs into the genome assembly, the possible sequence variations in the contigs due to polymorphisms among the four lines were overridden by the bases of ‘Nakate-Shinkuro’ by mapping the Illumina reads to the Newbler contigs with BWA 0.6.2. Subsequently, the bases with a low quality (a Phred score of <10) were trimmed from the 3' terminal ends and the contigs of <50 bases in length were discarded. Finally, 45,729 contigs of the total length of 38.2 Mb representing the ‘Nakate-Shinkuro’ genome were built (Supplementary Data).The obtained Illumina scaffolds and the revised Roche 454 contigs were assembled by using PCAP.rep to generate 81,273 hybrid scaffolds (836.8 Mb). A subset (30,935) of the Illumina scaffolds (cut-off length, =500 bp; average length, 2,787 bp) and 3,629 Roche 454 contigs (cut-off length, =500 bp; average length, 1,037 bp) remained unassembled. The nucleotide length of the unassembled scaffolds and contigs was 89.8 Mb in total, of which 17.2 Mb (19.2%) was undetermined (i.e. base = ‘N’). From the 81,273 hybrid scaffolds, sequences of <500 bp and those showing similarity with the sequences of vectors, bacteria, chloroplasts, or mitochondria were eliminated. Then, 26 (18 Roche and 8 Illumina) contigs that showed sequence similarities with the tomato predicted genes by BLASTX search and 5 (4 Roche and 1 Illumina) contigs that showed sequence similarities with the eggplant linkage map, LWAE2012 (see below, subsection 3.1.5.), by BLASTN search were recruited from the unassembled contigs. After that, the complete set of 43,845 ‘decontaminated and rescued’ sequences, which had a total length of 829.0 Mb (Supplementary Data), were further connected as super-scaffolds by using the Illumina MP reads and SSPACE 2.0. The resultant sequences were regarded as the draft genome sequence of eggplant and were named SME_r2.5.1 [DDBJ accession numbers: BAUE01000001–BAUE01143048 (143,048 entries)]; the sequences consisted of 33,873 super-scaffolds covering 833.1 Mb in total with an average GC content of 35.7% (Table 1). Statistics of the eggplant genome assembly SME_r2.5.1Statistics of the eggplant genome assembly SME_r2.5.1The SME_r2.5.1 draft genome spans ~74% of the eggplant genome, which has an estimated total length of 1,127 Mb (Supplementary Data). This genome coverage appears to be relatively low compared with that of other genome sequencing projects in which >80% of the whole genome is reported to be covered.7,8,35 In our study, HiSeq 2000 reads assembled by using SOAPdenovo generated a dataset of 86,288 scaffolds (=500 bp) that was 940.2 Mb in total length and covered 83% of the estimated eggplant genome size. Fifty percent of the total length of the assembly was contained in the contigs or scaffolds with lengths of =30 kb (i.e. N50 = 30 kb). By conducting further hybrid assembly and scaffolding together with 454 GS FLX reads by using PCAP.rep and SSPACE 2.0, the quality of the dataset was considerably improved in which the number of sequences decreased to less than one half (33,873 super-scaffolds) and the N50 length more than doubled (64.5 kb). The decrease in the total length of the sequences from 940.2 to 833.1 Mb (89%) in the hybrid assembly step might be caused by the difference of assembly fundamentals; among the discrete scaffolds that were built by SOAPdenovo assembly based on the de Bruijn graph algorithm, those that have intergenomic duplications, residual heterogeneity, or both might be merged by PCAP.rep based on similarity-based assembly. Furthermore, the super-scaffolding step of SSPACE 2.0 excluded the 89.8-Mb unassembled scaffolds and contigs, as mentioned above. Although this might be one of the reasons for the reduction in genome coverage, the strategy is appropriate because the unassembled scaffolds and contigs contained a large number of undetermined Ns, and therefore, they would be less informative for downstream analysis such as gene prediction and comparative analysis.On the other hand, gene space coverage would be expected to be increased by the use of sequence-captured 454 GS FLX reads. To evaluate the gene space coverage of SME_r2.5.1, a dataset of 25k eggplant unigenes (DFCI gene index, SomeGI Release 1.0, n = 25,443) was used as the query in BLAT mapping to SME_r2.5.1, rather than the 43k EST assembly obtained in this study, because the latter was mostly constructed from a mixture of 3'-end-enriched cDNA libraries and would not be suitable for representing the non-biased gene space structure. By BLAT mapping of SomeGI Release 1.0 unigenes, 24,144 (94.8%) sequences were mapped successfully to SME_r2.5.1 and furthermore, 22,338 (87.8%) sequences were covered by SME_r2.5.1 in more than 90% of each sequence (Supplementary Data). The result suggests that SME_r2.5.1 represents ~90% of the gene space in the eggplant genome.The accuracy of the assembly of SME_r2.5.1 was evaluated by comparative analysis with the sequences of two eggplant BAC clones (accession numbers: AB917429.1 and EF517791.1), which were the only publicly available eggplant BAC sequences at the time (June, 2014). Both of the BAC sequences showed adequate correspondence to the four genome contigs (Supplementary Data), suggesting that SME_r2.5.1 was properly assembled overall.The total length of repetitive sequences in SME_r2.5.1 was 586.8 Mb, which was 70.4% of the assembled genome sequences, a similar proportion to that observed for the tomato genome (68.3%; SL2.40), the S. pimpinellifolium genome (68.2%; A-1.0), the potato genome (64.2%; PGSC DM v3.4), and the tobacco genome (72.6%; Niben.v0.4.4; Supplementary Data). Among the known interspersed repeats, long terminal repeat elements of Class I, including copia- and gypsy-types, were the most frequent repeat sequences in the assembled genomes of eggplant (28.8%), as in those of other Solanum species. In contrast, appreciably different proportions of unique repetitive sequences were found in the five species: 34.6% (eggplant), 26.3% (tomato), 27.3% (S. pimpinellifolium), 20.9% (potato), and 49.8% (tobacco) of each genome. The relatively large amount of unique repetitive sequences present in the genome of tobacco, which is not a Solanum species but is a member of the Solanaceae family, would at least in part explain the huge genome size (~3.1 Gb) of tobacco compared with Solanum species (eggplant, 1.13 Gb; tomato and S. pimpinellifolium, ~0.95 Gb; potato, 0.84 Gb). Even within the four Solanum species, however, the sizes of the genomes seemed to reflect the total lengths of the unique repetitive sequences.In parallel, SSR motifs with di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, and hexanucleotide repeats that contained more than 7, 5, 4, 4, and 4 repeat units, respectively, were detected in SME_r2.5.1 (Supplementary Data). In total, 83,401 SSRs were found in SME_r2.5.1. Of these SSRs, 40,551 (48.6%) consisted of a di-nucleotide repeat unit, and of these, AT repeats were the most frequent (32,076 [38.5% of total SSRs]). Trinucleotide SSRs comprised the majority of the other SSRs (30,514 [36.6% of total SSRs]), and approximately half of them were AAC repeats (14,677 [17.6% of total SSRs]). AT repeats were also prominent in tomato, S. pimpinellifolium, potato, and tobacco. Among the trinucleotide motifs, AAC repeats were the predominant repeat in eggplant as well as in tobacco, while AAT repeats were the most frequent trinucleotide motif in tomato, S. pimpinellifolium, and potato. The differences in the distributions of the various SSR motifs among the genomes of the five species might reflect the phylogenetically close relationship of tomato, S. pimpinellifolium, and potato,25 which all belong to the subgenus Potatoe, from which eggplant and tobacco are relatively separate.Using the MIRA-based assembly and SNP mining of sequence data obtained from microarray-captured genomic DNA samples, we identified 4,536 SNPs among the four eggplant lines, ‘AE-P03’, ‘LS-1934’, ‘WCGR112-8’, and ‘Nakate-Shinkuro’. Of these SNPs, 1,152 positioned on the tomato genome based on the BLASTN results obtained with flanking sequences as queries against the tomato genome. Because these SNP markers were distributed in a non-biased manner across the tomato genome, we assume that they are also distributed in a non-biased manner across the eggplant genome. In parallel, from the 71,065 di- and trinucleotide SSRs found in SME_r2.5.1 (Supplementary Data), 360 SSRs were selected for marker development based on (i) the repeat number (preferably from 14 to 30), (ii) the motifs (dinucleotide repeats were preferred to trinucleotide ones; CA and GA were given priority to AT and CG), and (iii) the position in the tomato genome estimated by BLASTN searches (euchromatic position and non-biased distribution were preferred). Then, polymorphisms and PCR efficiency of the 360 SSR marker candidates were evaluated and 240 SSRs were selected for the construction of a linkage map based on two independent interspecific F2 mapping populations, EWF2 and LWF2. In total, 574 SNPs and 221 SSRs were successfully mapped (Supplementary Dataa and b). The resultant integrated linkage map, LWAE2012, which incorporated the published map AL201024 as well as the EWF2 and LWF2 maps, spanned a total genetic distance of 1,280.6 cM (Supplementary Data). Detailed information on the linkage map and DNA markers are available in the VegMarks database (http://vegmarks.nivot.affrc.go.jp). In total, 1,745 loci were mapped in the integrated map, with an average interval between markers of 0.73 cM and a maximum gap of 9.6 cM. Of the 1,745 DNA marker-associated sequences, 1,590 (91.1%) were successfully mapped to the 1,117 super-scaffolds of SME_r2.5.1 with high specificity by BLAT (minScore = 100, minIdentity = 90, and maxIntron = 10,000; Supplementary Data). The 1,117 ‘marker-tagged’ super-scaffolds spanned 101.8 Mb (12.2%) of the 833.1-Mb total sequence of SME_r2.5.1.3.2. Characterization of the genes encoded in the eggplant draft genome sequenceA total of 85,446 genes were predicted in SME_r2.5.1 by Augustus 2.7 and the predicted gene dataset was designated as Sme_r2.5_cds (Supplementary Data). Of these predicted genes, 41,048 were transposable elements and 2,363 were pseudo or short genes or both, all of which were excluded from further analysis. Of the remaining 42,035 predicted genes (average length of CDSs, 874 bases; average GC content, 43.6%), 38,498 were predicted as intrinsic genes and 3,537 were predicted as partial genes (Supplementary Data); the final subset of 42,035 predicted genes and their deduced amino acid sequences were named Sme_r2.5_cds_ip and Sme_r2.5_pep_ip, respectively. In addition, 890 transfer RNAs and 451 rRNAs were identified in SME_r2.5.1 (data not shown).To evaluate the accuracy of gene prediction, CDSs predicted with the use of SomeGI Release 1.0 were mapped to SME_r2.5.1 and Sme_r2.5_cds. Of the 17,034 predicted CDSs, 14,839 (87.1%) were successfully mapped both to SME_r2.5.1 and Sme_r2.5_cds. However, 1,616 CDSs (9.5%) were mapped to the genome super-scaffolds only, indicating that these CDSs were underpredicted by Augustus 2.7 and were not included in the Sme_r2.5_cds dataset (Supplementary Data). Construction of a prediction model based on eggplant full-length cDNA sequences would be a possible solution to be investigated in future.The 42,035 predicted genes of Sme_r2.5_cds_ip were annotated as described below. First, they were clustered into 35,000 gene families together with those in tomato, potato, tobacco, and A. thaliana genomes by conducting similarity searches with the CD-hit program. Whereas 6,780 gene clusters contained genes of all five species, 4,018 were exclusively comprised of eggplant genes (Fig. 2). Of the 4,018 eggplant-specific clusters (Supplementary Data), 19 clusters (clusters 1263, 2198, 7438, 7678, 8329, 9682, 9958, 9990, 10050, 11273, 11575, 14375, 17950, 21073, 21449, 22340, 24396, 26132, and 32194) were annotated as putative disease resistance-related genes, suggesting that these genes might confer the known unique and broad-spectrum disease resistance in eggplant compared with other Solanum crops.49,50 On the other hand, a total of 19,155 clusters were found in which eggplant genes were absent (Supplementary Data). Next, the predicted genes were mapped onto the KEGG metabolic pathways categorized as ‘1. Metabolism’. Of the 42,035 predicted eggplant genes of Sme_r2.5_cds_ip, 3,909 were mapped to 1,514 edges (i.e. enzymes) involved in 131 of the 164 metabolic pathways in the KEGG database, whereas the 5,180; 6,414; 7,228; and 7,142 genes of tomato, potato, tobacco, and A. thaliana, respectively, were mapped to 1,695; 1,674; 1,745; and 1,718 edges involved in 130, 135, 132, and 132 pathways, respectively (Supplementary Data). Subsequently, the functional domains found in the predicted genes were classified according to the GO slim categories;45 no remarkable differences in their distributions were observed between eggplant, tomato, potato, tobacco, and A. thaliana (Supplementary Data). Finally, the function of the predicted genes was investigated and compared with those in tomato, potato, tobacco, and A. thaliana. In Sme_r2.5_cds_ip, functional categories were assigned to the 23,022 genes by conducting similarity searches against the KOG database;46 their distributions were similar among the five species (eggplant, tomato, potato, tobacco, and A. thaliana; data not shown).

In the predicted gene set, Sme_r2.5_cds_ip, only one putative gene each encoding HCT (Sme2.5_04555.1_g00001.1) and HQT (Sme2.5_00673.1_g00011.1), respectively, was identified based on sequence similarity to the known counterparts, A. thaliana AtHCT (NP_199704.1) and tomato LeHQT (CAE46933.1).52 For C3H, five closely related homologs were identified in eggplant (Supplementary DataB). C3H is a member of the cytochrome P450 gene family CYP98A53 and a single-copy gene, CYP98A3, is involved in CGA biosynthesis in A. thaliana.54 There are two other CYP98A genes (CYP98A8 and CYP98A9) in the A. thaliana genome and they are thought to be involved in biosynthesis of a pollen coat constituent and to be multiplied via mRNA-mediated retroposition, because they have no introns and are clustered in tandem on chromosome 1.55 In eggplant, however, all five of the putative CYP98A genes were more closely related in amino acid sequence to A. thaliana C3H, CYP98A3, than to CYP98A8 and CYP98A9, suggesting that these five genes might be involved in the pathways related to CGA biosynthesis. All five genes had introns; and except for Sme2.5_00529.1_g00005.1, the gene showing the highest similarity to CYP98A3, the genes were located in tandem on a single super-scaffold, Sme2.5_00085.1. Therefore, these CYP98A members in eggplant would have evolved through different processes than the mRNA-mediated retroposition envisaged in A. thaliana. Gene duplication that brought about these new members of the CYP98A family might be responsible for the complex composition and increased content of CGAs found in eggplant.3.3. Comparative properties of the eggplant and tomato genomesTo find out the orthologous relationships between the eggplant predicted genes and corresponding tomato genes, similarities between nucleotide sequences were investigated. Of the 42,035 eggplant predicted genes in Sme_r2.5_cds_ip, 16,573, which were predicted on 5,926 super-scaffolds, showed reciprocal best-hit relationships with genes in the tomato genome SL2.40 (Supplementary Data), suggesting that they are orthologs of the tomato genes and probably have functions in common with their counterparts. Of the 68 tomato genes containing phenotyped known mutations,8 51 genes including genes responsible for disease resistance and fruit quality were successfully paired with putative orthologous eggplant genes (Supplementary Data). For each of the remaining 17 tomato genes, a closely located orthologous gene pair was found that could be used as a feasible starting point for chromosome walking experiments to isolate its ortholog in eggplant. The availability of the 16,573 putative ortholog sets will help to unite genetic information available for the two solanaceous species.Of the total 33,873 super-scaffolds in SME_r2.5.1, 9,489 (28.0%) were successfully mapped onto the tomato genome by BLAT-based mapping (Supplementary Data) including 1,027 of the 1,117 ‘marker-tagged’ super-scaffolds. The 9,489 super-scaffolds are equivalent to 476.2 Mb in total (57.2% of SME_r2.5.1) and include 30,260 intrinsic and partial genes (71.9% of Sme_r2.5_cds_ip). We first arranged the super-scaffolds in the order of the corresponding tomato genome positions, which spanned >98% in physical distance of the tomato genome, and 56 conserved synteny blocks and 44 break points of synteny were identified between eggplant and tomato genomes (Supplementary Data). Then, the 9,489 super-scaffolds were re-aligned in the order of the eggplant genome based on map position data of the ‘marker-tagged’ super-scaffolds. The genome-wide relationship between eggplant and tomato genomes is summarized in Supplementary Data. Previously, Doganlar et al.22 identified 43 synteny blocks and 31 break points of synteny in the eggplant genome compared with the tomato genome by comparative analysis of eggplant and tomato linkage maps comprised of 233 DNA markers. In our study, additional genome rearrangements between the two species were detected including an inversion in chromosome 1 and an inversion and a translocation in chromosome 8, where no rearrangements were suggested in the previous studies.11,22,24 While further and more comprehensive efforts should be made to fill the gaps to complete the eggplant genome sequencing, the dataset of 9,489 super-scaffolds aligned in the order of eggplant genome would be a helpful milestone for eggplant genomics in the future.The two parental lines of the mapping population EWF2, ‘EPL-1’, and ‘WCGR112-8’ show a distinct difference in corolla colour to each other. Whereas ‘EPL-1’ has a purple corolla that is normal for typical eggplant cultivars and lines, ‘WCGR112-8’ has a pure white corolla that is fairly rare among eggplant germplasms (Supplementary DataA). The corolla colours in EWF2 segregated clearly into purple and white with a ratio of 90 : 28 (n = 118; data for two individuals could not be obtained because of their very poor growth) that fit a ratio of 3 : 1 (<U+03C7>2 = 0.102, P = 0.75), suggesting that this trait was controlled by a single locus and the purple corolla was dominant over the white. The locus controlling the trait was mapped to a single locus on chromosome 12 between two markers, gg9149_779 and emxC0904. The sequences flanking the markers were successfully mapped to two super-scaffolds, Sme2.5_00058.1 and Sme2.5_07318.1, respectively. As suggested by the eggplant–tomato synteny relationship described in the previous section (Supplementary Data), the eggplant genome region between gg9149_779 and emxC0904 corresponded to two separate tomato genome regions, 49,983,748–48,201,788 (inverted) and 50,651,935–50,780,466 on chromosome 11, that were located in two different synteny blocks, sb55inv and sb56 (Supplementary DataB). Whereas 167 gene models were predicted in these two tomato genome regions, 88 genes were predicted in eggplant in the corresponding region, which is covered by 53 eggplant super-scaffolds, and among them, 2 eggplant Myb-like genes (Sme2.5_02513.1_g00003.1 and Sme2.5_05212.1_g00003.1) were identified. Because it has been reported in various plant species that Myb-like transcription factors are intimately involved in regulation of the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway,56–58 we consider that these genes are promising candidates for the gene or genes responsible for the corolla colour. Only two Myb-like genes were also found among the 167 tomato genes located in the region (Solyc11g065840.1.1 and Solyc11g069030.1.1), suggesting that there are only two Myb-like genes in the eggplant genome region, even though it is not completely covered by super-scaffolds. While further analysis is required, of course, to provide evidence of the gene or genes responsible for corolla colour, the result suggests that making connections between the comprehensive genome information for tomato and the draft genome sequence and high-density linkage map of eggplant will be a powerful means to further our understanding of the relatively unexplored species, eggplant.3.4.

IntroductionTimely detection of emerging genetic variants and other evolutionary features associated with important clinical phenotypes such as increased virulence and drug resistance are central to malaria control strategies. Genome sequencing of parasite populations has been identified as an effective tool for detecting genetic changes.1,2 Despite the current success in the sequencing technology, there remain significant challenges in achieving global genetic surveillance of parasite populations in the field. Most genome-scale analyses, such as whole-genome sequencing, require large amounts of clean genetic material that is often difficult to obtain,3 and therefore a serious impediment to genetic analysis on many clinical samples. A large number of valuable clinical specimens are collected in the form of small samples that yield low quantity and quality of genetic material.4–7 A common method for collecting clinical samples in the field is through heel/finger-pricks.5,7–10 However, the quantity and quality of parasite genetic material that can be extracted from these small blood samples usually fall below the threshold required by genome sequencing platforms.To alleviate the problem of low DNA quantities, whole-genome amplification (WGA) is now routinely applied in many applications,3,11 but has yet to be optimized for use in genomes of extreme base composition such as Plasmodium falciparum. Two major forms of WGA have been described: multiple displacement amplification (MDA)12,13 and PCR-based amplification methods.14,15 MDA has been the method of choice for a wider range of genome amplification studies, because it produces longer DNA products with extensive genome coverage.16MDA is based on f29 polymerase, which, in the presence of random hexamers annealed to denatured DNA, uses an MDA mechanism to synthesize high-molecular-weight DNA from very minute amounts of input material under isothermal conditions.17,18 The best results, however, have been obtained from genomes with relatively balanced base composition.11,19,20 Amplification of genomes with imbalanced base composition, such as the AT-rich P. falciparum, has remained a challenge.21,22In this study, we sought to identify and optimize a WGA system suitable for an AT-base-biased genome of P. falciparum. Using standard conditions as outlined for each system, we tested the efficiency of non-MDA- and MDA-based methods. Initial findings showed that MDA-based systems produced a more uniform genome coverage than non-MDA methods (data not shown). We have optimized an identified MDA system to produce an improved genome coverage and a reduced base-bias with more accurate genome representation. We show that our optimized WGA conditions are suitable for as low as 10 picograms (pg) P. falciparum input DNA, producing high-sequence concordance with unamplified genomic DNA. This development promises a significant tool to aid implementation of the global genetic surveillance of parasite populations through small blood sample sequencing.2. Materials and methods2.1. DNA samplesPlasmodium falciparum 3D7 genomic DNA was a gift from Prof. Chris Newbold (University of Oxford). The clinical isolates were obtained from the Malaria Genetics Group's Sequencing Sample Repository at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. Other genomic DNA was extracted from 17 progeny clones of P. falciparum strains derived from genetic cross between 7G8xGB423 and a 3D7 strain (3D7_glasgow).2.2. Whole-genome amplificationAll non-MDA WGA were performed following individual kit manufacturer's instructions. MDA-based WGA was performed using either REPLI-g Mini kit (Qiagen) or Genomiphi kit (GE Healthcare). For Genomiphi, the kit manufacturer's instructions were followed without modification. For the REPLI-g Mini kit, manufacturer's instructions were followed during preliminary tests. The following modifications were performed in developing optimized conditions for the REPLI-g Mini kit: nuclease-free water and all tubes were UV-treated before use. WGA reactions were performed in 0.2 ml PCR tubes. Buffer D1 stock solution (Qiagen) was reconstituted by adding 500 µl of nuclease-free water, and a working solution was prepared by mixing the stock solution and nuclease-free water in the ratio of 1 : 3.5, respectively. Unmodified Buffer N1 was reconstituted by mixing Stop solution (Qiagen) and nuclease-free water in the ratio of 1 : 5.7. Modified buffer N1 was prepared by including tetramethylammonium chloride (TMAC) at a concentration of 300 mM. To denature DNA templates, 5 µl of the DNA solution was mixed with 5 µl of buffer D1 (working solution prepared as described above). The mixture was vortexed and centrifuged briefly before incubating at room temperature for 3 min. Denatured DNA was neutralized by adding 10 µl of either unmodified or modified buffer N1. Neutralized DNA was mixed by vortexing and centrifuged briefly. To amplify the DNA template, denatured and neutralized sample was mixed with 29 µl of REPLI-g Mini Reaction Buffer and 1 µl of REPLI-g Mini DNA polymerase to obtain a final reaction volume of 50 µl. The reaction mixture was incubated at 30°C for 16 h using an MJ Research PTC-225 thermal cycling system (GMI, Inc., USA) with the heating lid set to track at +5°C. Amplified DNA was cleaned using Agencourt Ampure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) using sample to beads ratio of 1 : 1 and eluted with 50 µl of EB (Qiagen).2.3. Illumina library preparation and sequencingAll sequencing libraries were prepared as PCR-free. Whole-genome amplified or unamplified genomic DNA (1.5 µg in 75 µl of TE buffer) was sheared using a Covaris S2 (Covaris, Inc., Woburn, MA, USA) to obtain a fragment-size distribution of ~300 to ~600 bp. The sheared DNA fragments were end-repaired and A-tailed using the NEBNext DNA sample preparation kit (NEB), following an Illumina sample preparation protocol. Pre-annealed paired-end Illumina PCR-free adapters were ligated to the A-tailed fragments in a 50-µl reaction containing 10 µl of DNA sample, 1× Quick T4 DNA ligase buffer, 10 µl of PCR-free PE-adapter mixture, 5 µl of Quick T4 DNA ligase (NEB) and incubated at 20°C for 30 min. The ligation reaction was cleaned twice using Agencourt Ampure XP beads (Beckman Coulter). Cleaned DNA was eluted with 20 µl of buffer EB. Aliquots were analysed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) to determine the size distribution and to check for adapter contamination. Samples were sequenced using either Illumina Hiseq 2500 or Miseq technologies (San Diego, CA, USA) with 75 bp read length and the paired-end read options. Corresponding WGA and non-WGA samples were run in the same lanes, using different multiplex tags. This strategy reduces potential confounding artefacts relating to sequencing chemistry.2.4. Read mapping and genotype concordance analysisReads were mapped against the P. falciparum reference sequence (http://plasmodb.org/common/downloads/release-10.0/Pfalciparum3D7/fasta/data/), using BWA (V0.6.2). We analysed the genotype calls from 17 samples derived from the progeny clones of genetic crosses of 7G8xGB4 laboratory strains,23 including one parent reference strain 3D7 as a control. For genotype concordance analysis, we generated de novo variation calls using samtools (V0.1.1.19) mpileup and bfctools (V0.1.17), calling on both WGA and non-WGA samples. For in silico genotyping, we used a list of 20 737 high-quality single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) positions and alleles generated from the sequence of genetic crosses (unpublished data). We performed in silico genotyping of both the WGA and non-WGA samples using samtools mpileup and counting alleles present in at least five reads.3. Results3.1. WGA using standard methodsWe performed tests on various WGA systems to identify those suitable for AT-rich P. falciparum genome. We compared non-MDA—Endcore-Rapid (NuGen), MALBAC (Yikon Genomics), Rapisome (Biohelix) and MDA—Repli_g (Qiagen) and Genomiphi (GE Healthcare) systems. Our preliminary data (not shown) indicated that non-MDA methods were less tolerant to the AT-biased genome compared with their MDA counterparts. With non-MDA amplification, we observed excess bias towards regions with high GC content and poor coverage of high AT regions of the genome resulting into high levels of allele dropout. Further optimization focused on the MDA systems. Repli_g and Genomiphi are the most commonly used methods for MDA. Although both kits have shown similar results in many systems,24,25 the majority of studies have been with genomes of relatively balanced base composition. Here, we have assessed the performance of Repli_g and Genomiphi by amplifying an AT-rich P. falciparum genome. Amplification of pure P. falciparum 3D7 genomic DNA by both kits produced very similar results as assessed by genome coverage analysis metrics. However, amplification of host-contaminated clinical samples produced dissimilar results in terms of base composition and overall genome coverage (Fig. 1). Whereas amplification products generated by both Repli_g and Genomiphi did not maintain the exact original host/parasite DNA proportions, Genomiphi products were more biased towards the host DNA (Fig. 1), an observation suggesting bias towards templates of neutral base composition originating from the host genome. Based on the level of bias, we chose to optimize Repli_g for amplification of the P. falciparum genome. Figure 1.Open in new tabDownload slideLorenz curves of genome coverage analysis. Cumulative fraction of sequence reads against cumulative fraction of genome covered is shown for each sample. The diagonal line represents an ideal perfect uniform coverage. The further the sample curves deviate from the diagonal line the more bias in genome coverage they are. Repli_g (solid lines) and Genomiphi (dashed lines) sample pairs were normalized to equal number of reads. Repli_g and Genomiphi amplification of P. falciparum 3D7 genomic DNA (3D7) resulted in identical coverage uniformity as shown in overlapping solid red (Repli_g_3D7) and dashed red (Genomiphi_3D7) curves, respectively. Amplification of clinical samples with varied proportions of human DNA contaminations produced different uniformity of coverage with Genomiphi (dashed lines) showing slightly more bias than their corresponding Repli_g (solid lines) amplified samples. 3D7, pure P. falciparum genomic DNA; PK76, clinical sample with 53% host DNA contamination amplified with either Genomiphi (Genomiphi_PK76) or Repli_g (Regpli_g_PK76); PD21, a clinical sample with 7% host contamination amplified with either Genomiphi (Genomiphi_PD21) or Repli_g (Regpli_g_PD21); PK67, a clinical sample with 19% host contamination amplified with either Genomiphi (Genomiphi_PK67) or Repli_g (Regpli_g_PK67).Figure 1.Open in new tabDownload slideLorenz curves of genome coverage analysis.

Optimized WGA conditions reduce amplification bias and improve coverage on low complexity regionsNon-coding regions of P. falciparum DNA contain ~90% A+T base composition. Amplification of AT-rich genomes is a challenge to almost all commercially available polymerases. We have previously shown that addition of TMAC improves coverage of low GC regions of the genome during PCR,22 but the same has not been tested with f29, the MDA polymerase. To investigate the effect of TMAC on MDA, we amplified P. falciparum 3D7 genomic DNA of varied input amounts (0.1–2 ng) both in the presence and absence of TMAC. We compared the quantity and quality of both products and observed that, like many commercial PCR polymerases, f29 is inhibited by TMAC at certain levels of concentration. We have determined 60 mM as a concentration that is non-inhibitory to the polymerase and optimal for WGA of an AT-biased genome. Although the quantity of the amplification product was higher in the absence (standard procedure) than in the presence of 60 mM TMAC (data not shown), the quality of MDA product, in terms of coverage and base composition, was improved in the optimized procedure where TMAC was added (Figs 2 and 3). As shown in Fig. 2, amplification using a standard protocol (Std) resulted in excessive bias in regions of low complexity. Inspection of the over-amplified regions reveals sequences of low complexity and numerous repeat patterns. We used a tandem repeat finder programme26 and revealed numerous sequences in tandem repeat conformation that may have affected amplification bias. The top three tandem repeats are provided in Supplementary Data. Unlike the standard WGA protocol, our optimized amplification procedure abolished excessive amplification bias and produced a more uniform coverage. The mechanism by which this bias is corrected is not clear, but it is conceivable that TMAC stabilizes and stiffens the DNA backbone, thereby minimizing cis-priming by the looping of displaced DNA strands during amplification. We also show that base composition bias increased with a decrease in the amount of input DNA during amplification with standard protocols. This bias was not observed in samples amplified with the optimized (Opt) conditions (Fig. 3). Figure 2.Open in new tabDownload slideLookSeq analysis of coverage uniformity.

Optimized conditions reduce chimera formation and maintain template base composition during MDA by f29Formation of chimeric reads is a major problem with MDA technology.27 Chimeras cause serious mapping and assembly problems, and therefore reduce the quality and quantity of the WGA product. We analysed the formation of chimeras by comparing WGA products following standard and optimized procedures. The number of chimeric reads increased as the amount of input DNA was reduced (Fig. 4). However, optimizing WGA condition by including TMAC additive decreased the formation of chimeras and improved the quality of reads in P. falciparum WGA. Figure 4.Open in new tabDownload slideBar graph of chimeric read analysis. Different amounts of P. falciparum 3D7 genomic DNA (ranging from 2 ng to 100 fg as shown in sample labels) were used as an input template for amplification by Repli_g following the standard or optimized procedure. Amplification products were sequenced as PCR-free, and reads obtained were normalized and analysed for the presence of chimeric reads. A non-WGA sample (control) showed the least number of chimers. Using the standard procedure, the number of chimers increased with a decrease in the amount of input DNA. Samples amplified using the optimized procedure showed a decrease in chimer formation that remained low and steady from 2 ng to 100 pg of input DNA.Figure 4.Open in new tabDownload slideBar graph of chimeric read analysis.

WGA from 10 pg of input P. falciparum genomic DNAMost studies with f29 MDA have used an input DNA of =10 ng for WGA.19,20 In many cases, this amount may be difficult to obtain from valuable clinical specimens. We set to find out the minimal amount of parasite DNA that can be successfully amplified by the optimized conditions to obtain uniform genome coverage. We performed WGA on P. falciparum genomic DNA with an input amount ranging from 2 ng down to 100 femtograms (fg). WGA products were multiplexed and sequenced using Illumina MiSeq or HiSeq 2500 machines. Sequence reads generated were analysed to determine the minimum threshold required to produce optimal coverage suitable for various whole-genome studies including genotyping by SNP analysis. To assess the quality of the sequence data generated from each input amount, reads were mapped to the reference genome using BWA. CallableLoci program of the genome analyser tool kit (GATK)28 was used to inspect and count the proportion of the genome with high-quality base coverage (callable bases), positions of the genome with zero coverage (uncovered bases) and the size of coverage gaps. Using these metrics, we show that the number of callable loci (high-quality bases) remained relatively high for samples with input DNA ranging from 2 ng to 10 pg. However, the quality of sequence data dropped sharply for samples with input DNA <10 pg (Fig. 5). A similar trend was observed with the proportion of gap sizes (length of uncovered bases, Fig. 5 bottom panel) and chimeric reads (Fig. 4), where a sharp increase in these values was observed for samples with input DNA <10 pg. From these observations, we concluded that 10 pg is the minimal amount of P. falciparum input DNA that produces quality genome coverage under the optimized MDA conditions described. This amount of DNA is equivalent to only ~380 parasite genomes. Figure 5.Open in new tabDownload slideDetermining the lowest threshold of input DNA mass for WGA. Different amounts of P. falciparum 3D7 genomic DNA (ranging from 2 ng to 100 fg, as shown in sample names) were used as an input template for amplification by Repli_g following the standard or optimized procedure. Samples were multiplexed and sequenced using a fast turn-around Illumina Miseq machine. Sequence reads mapped to the reference were normalized and analysed for coverage and base quality using the ‘CallableLoci’ program of GATK. A non-WGA sample was used as an unamplified control. Input quantities ranging from 2 ng down to 10 pg produced reads with high-quality ‘callable’ bases covering over 60% of the genome. Input DNA below the10-pg threshold produced poor base quality with only <30% of genome covered with ‘callable’ bases. Input DNA <10 pg showed a sharp increase in positions with zero coverage (bases uncovered) and an increase in gap sizes in genome coverage.Figure 5.Open in new tabDownload slideDetermining the lowest threshold of input DNA mass for WGA.

Detailed analysis of WGA products from a 10-pg input template DNAStandard WGA methods produce products that show sequence representation bias, allelic dropout and amplification artefacts. These problems tend to increase as the amount of input template decreases. To adequately evaluate the quality of the WGA products produced from an input of 10 pg—1,000-fold smaller than the standard input amounts—we performed analysis on genomic DNA extracted from P. falciparum strains derived from the progeny clones of genetic cross between 7G8xGB4 laboratory strains, as well as the 3D7 Strain. Genomic DNA extracted from 17 progeny clones was sequenced both as WGA and as bulk genomic DNA (non-WGA). We performed detailed analysis by comparing sequence data generated from WGA and their matching unamplified genomic DNA (non-WGA). WGA and non-WGA samples yielded a median of 3.5 and 3.4 billion base sequences, respectively, with 94.8 and 95.3% of the read mapping to the reference sequence (Table 1). WGA samples showed coverage between 180× and 500×, whereas non-WGA samples showed coverage between 90× and 250×. A median of 1.5 and 1.2% of genome bases was not covered in WGA and non-WGA samples, respectively (Table 1). Sequence coverage and mapping analysisSequence reads obtained from WGA and non-WGA samples were analysed for coverage and mapping statistics. Nearly identical average number of sequence reads, mapping and coverage statistics were obtained for both WGA and non-WGA datasets. However, coverage distribution was less uniform in WGA compared with non-WGA datasets.Sequence coverage and mapping analysisSequence reads obtained from WGA and non-WGA samples were analysed for coverage and mapping statistics. Nearly identical average number of sequence reads, mapping and coverage statistics were obtained for both WGA and non-WGA datasets. However, coverage distribution was less uniform in WGA compared with non-WGA datasets.3.6. Genotype concordance analysisTo evaluate the fidelity of sequence representation by WGA, we analysed the genotype calls from 17 cross samples and the parent reference strain. We performed de novo and in silico genotype calls on sequence generated from both the WGA and non-WGA samples. Genotype concordance was determined by comparing SNP and InDel calls from matched pairs of both non-WGA and WGA samples.For each pair of WGA and non-WGA sample, we generated de novo variation calls simultaneously. A median of 20,338 biallelic de novo SNPs with a quality score of =250 were called for each sample. For the 3D7 reference strain (3D7_Glasgow), only 185 de novo SNPs were called (Supplementary Data). Both of these numbers are well within the expected range for this method.1 As given in Table 2, call pairs were grouped into ‘Perfect Concordance’, ‘WGA New Alleles’ and ‘Undetermined’. Identical calls in both non-WGA and WGA samples had a median of 97.3% and a mean of 96.7% ± 1.2 that are in perfect concordance, and new alleles present only in the WGA samples (considered as WGA-introduced alleles) had a median of 1.2% and a mean of 1.8 ± 1.1%. Most of the WGA-introduced alleles were due to a mixed call in WGA, where the non-WGA counterpart only showed the reference allele. Discordant single-allele calls were extremely rare with a median of zero SNPs and a total of 10 occurrences across all the samples (Supplementary Data). Additionally, de novo SNP calls in 5,075,789 well-covered coding positions (Table 2) produced perfect concordance with a median of 98.5% and a mean of 98.0 ± 1.4%, while the occurrence of WGA-introduced alleles dropped to a median of 0.7% and a mean of 0.8 ± 0.4%. In this subset, no discordant calls (alt/ref or ref/alt) were observed (Supplementary Data). Calls that were grouped as ‘Undetermined’ represent alleles that were missing or wrong alleles (present in the non-WGA samples but are neither the reference nor the alternative allele). WGA and non-WGA SNP concordance analysisWGA and non-WGA data were analysed for de novo SNP calling concordance. Matching sequence data from cross samples were paired and the SNP calling was performed simultaneously. Concordance rates were generated by comparing WGA and related non-WGA calls. Columns on the left show comparison of all calls covering the entire genome, whereas columns on the right show a subset of all calls covering only the high-quality coding regions of the genome. Values in the perfect concordance columns represent the proportion of calls that were identical in both WGA and non-WGA samples. WGA new allele columns show the proportion of SNPs that were present only in the WGA and not in their matching non-WGA alleles.

As given in Table 3, InDel calls from the whole genome with perfect concordance between WGA and non-WGA samples had a median of 97.6% and a mean of 96.8 ± 1.7%, and WGA-introduced InDels had a median of 1.5% and a mean of 2.4 ± 1.8%. Similarly, de novo InDel calls in the coding regions only produced near-perfect concordance with a median of 98.7% and a mean of 98.2 ± 1.4%. WGA-introduced InDels in these regions dropped to a median of 0.4% and a mean of 1.4 ± 1.3%.

Call comparisons between the WGA and non-WGA from same samples were grouped into ‘Perfect Concordance (identical)’, ‘WGA Missing Alleles’, ‘WGA New Alleles’ and ‘Undetermined’ (missing allele). Identical alleles with perfect concordance between WGA and non-WGA samples had a median of 97.95% (Fig. 6). A median of 0.48% calls represent alleles that were called in the WGA, but not in the non-WGA, samples. These reflect cases where the WGA sample had a mixed call and the non-WGA sample had a single-allele call. A median of 0.94% represent alleles that were missing in WGA, but were called in non-WGA samples. Discordant single-allele calls were extremely rare, with a median of zero and a mean of 2.9 SNPs per sample. Four of the 17 samples showed such discordant calls, and only three samples had more than one such call. The 3D7 (3D7_Glasgow) reference sample showed 99.58% identical calls, and only one new allele in WGA sample was returned as a mixed call (Supplementary Data).

DiscussionHigh-throughput DNA sequencing technologies have gained a wide range of applications in infectious disease research, including global surveillance of the emergence and spread of drug resistance, detection of regions of the genome under selection and identification of genetic determinants of clinical phenotypes through genome-wide association studies. The P. falciparum genome presents inherent technical challenges to next-generation DNA sequencing, such as its extreme AT-richness. Whole-genome sequencing of P. falciparum field isolates poses additional difficulties due to the small quantity of DNA often retrieved from patients in the clinical setting and the high degree of host DNA contamination from leucocytes. This study addressed the first of these key problems by developing a method for WGA capable of producing high-quality sequence data from just 10 pg of input P. falciparum DNA.Although PCR-based WGA techniques, such as primer extension PCR, ligation-mediated PCR and degenerate oligonucleotide-primed PCR, have been successfully used in some studies such as single-cell amplification,29 their wider application has been limited. PCR-based WGA methods produce relatively shorter products, non-specific amplification artefacts and incomplete genome coverage.19,20,30 MDA has been associated with base-bias and generation of chimeric products.29 Nonetheless, MDA has been the method of choice for a wider range of genome amplification studies, because it produces longer DNA products with extensive genome coverage. MDA also produces higher DNA yields with relatively less amplification bias.3,11,19Here, we have assessed MDA on an AT-rich genome using a range of input DNA quantities. We describe an optimized WGA method incorporating TMAC reagent that improves amplification coverage of the difficult AT-rich loci of the genome. We establish 10 pg of input DNA as the lowest threshold from which our optimized WGA protocol generates an amplification product with optimal P. falciparum genome coverage for most genome sequencing analysis. This amount equates to ~380 parasite genomes, equivalent to ~1 µl of blood in a patient with 0.01% parasitemia. Furthermore, we show that the optimized conditions significantly reduce the formation of chimeric reads, thereby improving the overall quality of the amplified product.Standard WGA from such small quantities of input material is often associated with bias and incomplete genome coverage. A single-cell genomic approach that uses infected red blood cell sorting technology has recently been reported that achieved a genome coverage of ~50% with a standard WGA method.31 Although genome coverage in single-cell approach is still low, this technology has opened avenues for single-cell genomics studies in malaria and offers great opportunities for dissecting multiple genotype infection. Our optimized WGA method described here will be useful for optimizing genome coverage in such single-cell genome amplifications, as well as direct field applications for small sample sequencing. For improved malaria clinical sequencing, we routinely employ the combination of host depletion methods32,33 and the current optimized WGA procedure to generate high-quality whole genome sequencing data.We have assessed the quality of the amplified products generated from 10 pg input DNA using high-throughput sequencing of DNA extracted from 17 progeny clones derived from genetic crosses between two laboratory strains. We performed a comparative analysis between the WGA data and their corresponding non-WGA counterparts. We show that coverage was sufficient for allele calling and other whole-genome analyses. Although the number of uncovered bases was slightly higher in WGA (median, 1.5%) than non-WGA (median, 1.2%) samples (Table 1), the difference was insignificant (t-test, P = 0.053, 95% CI). The same applies to preference for mitochondria DNA amplification, which showed a median of 2.6% in WGA against 0.6% in the non-WGA samples.Another key aspect of P. falciparum whole-genome sequencing from clinical specimens is removing host DNA contamination. This can be achieved either at the blood sample processing stage through leucocyte depletion or through selective enrichment of parasite DNA after extraction.32–34 The combination of an effective method for removing human DNA that is applicable to the field setting, and the ability to perform whole-genome sequencing from very low quantities of input DNA as described in this study, has the potential to greatly increase the scope and scale of P. falciparum genomic research. This, in turn, would contribute significantly to malaria genetic surveillance and control strategies.5. ConclusionThe optimized amplification conditions described here have generated high-quality whole-genome sequence data (99.8% genome coverage) from a minute amount of input DNA, equivalent to <400 P. falciparum genomes. This work shows for the first time that accurate in silico genotyping and de novo calling of genetic variants is achievable on a WGA sample using <1 ng of input DNA from an extremely AT-rich genome. We anticipate that sequencing from small quantities of input DNA (<1 ng) will become a significant aid to genetic and genomic studies of P. falciparum in the field, particularly when combined with effective methods for removal of host DNA contamination.FundingThis research was supported by the Wellcome Trust through the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (098051), the Resource Centre for Genomic Epidemiology of Malaria (090770/Z/09/Z) and the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics (090532/Z/09/Z).

IntroductionContinuous cell lines that originate from mammalian tissues serve as not only invaluable tools for life sciences, but also important animal cell substrates for the production of various types of biological pharmaceuticals. One lineage of the most frequently utilized mammalian cell lines for these purposes is the Vero cell lineage, which was established from the kidney tissue of an African green monkey (AGM). The primary culture of this tissue was started on 27 March 1962 in Chiba University in Japan, several continuous cell sub-lines were obtained after passages for several months, and a sub-line was then chosen as the standard Vero cell line.1,2Vero cells were found to be highly susceptible to various types of viruses including simian polyoma virus SV-40,1,2 measles virus,3 rubella virus,4,5 arboviruses,6,7 and adenoviruses7 soon after their establishment, and were later found to be also susceptible to bacterial toxins including the diphtheria toxin,8 heat-labile enterotoxins,9 and Shiga-like toxins (or ‘Vero’ toxins).10,11 After their global distribution,12,13 the application range of Vero cells extended from virology in academic laboratories to diagnostic practices in hospitals and bacterial toxin assays. Vero cells have pseudo-diploid karyotypes14 and are non-tumourigenic when a cell passage was not prolonged.15,16 Therefore, the Vero cell lineage has been successfully utilized as a cell substrate for human vaccines.17,18 Vero cells are still the first choice cell model for various types of life-threating emerging pathogens such as H5N1 influenza virus,19 Ebola haemorrhagic fever virus,20 and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus.21 Animal substrates for vaccine manufacturing are desired to be shifted from animals and eggs to assured continuous cell lines, because animal materials have several concerns related to quality control, stable supply, and animal ethics.17–19 In addition, antigenic drift affecting the vaccination efficacy to humans, which often occurs during the proliferation of influenza viruses in hen eggs,22 might be improved by shifting to vaccine strain-susceptible human or non-human primate culture cells.Therefore, the Vero cell lineage should be fully characterized using modern technologies to prepare threats of infectious diseases. The whole-genome sequences of continuous cell lines provide invaluable basic information for various purposes. The genome sequence of a cell line is a comprehensive basis for many genetic characteristics of the cell line, it is closely relevant to other omics approaches such as transcriptomics and proteomics on the cell line, and also facilitates targeted genome editing of the cell line.23–25 However, the whole genome of Vero cells has not yet been determined. We here provided a draft sequence of the whole genome of the Vero cell lineage after massively parallel sequencing of the genome DNA and also karyological and RNA-seq analyses. The genome landscape gave a mechanical insight into events that had occurred during the establishment of the permanent cell line susceptible to various types of microbes. In addition, we presented a proof of concept for the genomic-based quality control of cell lines.2. Materials and methods2.1. Karyological analysisMetaphase chromosomes from Vero cells and AGM peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were analysed by conventional Giemsa-banding (G-banding)26 and multi-colour fluorescence in situ hybridization (M-FISH) with 24 differentially labelled human chromosome-specific painting probes (24xCyte kit MetaSystems, Altlussheim, Germany). For detailed information, see Supplementary Data.2.2. Genome DNA preparation and de novo assemblyGenome DNA was prepared from Vero cells (with passage number 115) and PBMC using the Qiagen Blood & Cell Culture DNA kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany). Libraries constructed for paired ends and mate pairs were sequenced with HiSeq2,000 (Illumina Inc., San Diego, California). After quality filtering, sequences were assembled into scaffolds using SGA and SSPACE software27,28 (see Supplementary Data for detailed assembly procedure). Protein-coding genes were predicted by the AUGUSTUS program with reference to the human genome as a model29 and also with RNA-seq reads to assist in the predictions.2.3. Mapping to the rhesus macaque and AGM
reference genomeReads were mapped on the draft genome of the rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta: rheMac2) and AGM (Chlorocebus sabaeus 1.0: GCA_000409795.1) using the BWA-MEM algorithm with default parameter settings.30 After mapping, potential polymerase chain reaction (PCR) duplicates, which were mapped to the same positions of the reference genome, were removed using Picard software (http://picard.sourceforge.net). The average genome coverage of paired-end sequences after removing the PCR duplicates was 54-fold for the AGM reference. Single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) were called following the Best Practice pipeline of the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) software package, which includes base quality score recalibration, insertion/deletion (indel) realignment, and discovering and filtering SNVs and indels.312.4. Detection of genomic rearrangements in the Vero JCRB0111 cell lineCopy number variants were detected using the Control-FREEC software32 with a 100-kb window size and 20-kb step size. Sites with map quality scores <40 were not used in the analysis. Structural variants were identified using the integrated structural variant prediction method DELLY. Junction sequences with =85% identity to the other part of the reference genome and split-read coverage >100 were also filtered out.To reduce rare and false-positive variant calls, we further applied the following conservative criteria. To detect deletions and inversions, we counted reads spanning non-rearranged sequence regions with at least 7 bp overlapping to each sequence proximal and distal to the boundaries. The number of these canonical reads should be proportional to the number of non-rearranged cells. The number of canonical reads was calculated for each non-rearranged region and divided by 2, because one rearrangement had two non-rearranged regions. We selected the regions at which rearranged reads (split reads) consisted of at least 70% of total reads mapped on boundary regions (sum of canonical and split reads). We also filtered out the regions that had <20 paired-end supports. For additional information, see Supplementary Data.Loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) regions were identified using 1-Mb-size windows with average heterozygosity <0.0005 and the ratio of homozygous to heterozygous SNVs smaller than 0.2. The cut-off criteria were determined using the distribution of these values in a whole genome (Supplementary Data). The windows were progressively merged into larger regions when average statistics in the region satisfied the criteria.2.5. MiscellaneousProcedures for cell culture, tumourigenicity test, RNA-seq, phylogenetic analysis, and genomic PCR are described in Supplementary Data.2.6. EthicsAll animal experimental procedures were approved by the National Institute of Biomedical Innovation Committee on Animal Resources as the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.2.7. Accession codesThe short reads and assembled draft genome sequence have been deposited in the public database (accession number: DRA002256). The full-length simian endogenous retrovirus sequences obtained in Vero JCRB0111 cells have been deposited in DDBJ (accession number: AB935214).3. Results3.1. Vero cell seedTo obtain the reference genome sequence of the cell lineage, cell seeds with the least passage levels were desirable as material. We chose a cryopreserved cell lot registered at the Japanese Collection of Research Bioresources Cell Bank, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the oldest or nearly the oldest lot (with a passage level of 115 from the original primary culture started in March 1962) among the currently available stocks. Lot JCRB0111 (hereafter referred to as Vero JCRB0111) was expected to be a close relative to widely distributed Vero cell seeds such as ATCC CCL81 and WHO Vero 10–87.1,2,12,13,33–35 The heteroplantation of Vero JCRB0111 cells in immunocompromised nude mice (n = 10) did not produce any discernible tumours, while that of human cervical carcinoma-derived HeLa cells produced tumours in nude mice at 100% efficacy. Thus, Vero JCRB0111 cells are non-tumourigenic, which is consistent with previous findings of Vero cells being non-tumourigenic when their passage number was limited.15,16When choosing the Vero JCRB0111 cell seed in this study, we confirmed that there was no microbial contamination in the seed using conventional tests. In addition, DNA-seq short reads, which were obtained to resolve the draft sequence of the whole Vero cell genome, were employed to comprehensively detect microbe-relevant sequences with a megablast search. No discernible sign of microbe-relevant sequences (except for endogenous retroviral sequences as shown below) was detected in the cell genome sample, which confirmed the absence of microbial contamination in the Vero cell seed.3.2. KaryotypingThe Vero JCRB0111 cell line had different karyotypes with chromosomes numbering between 52 and 62, and the modal chromosome number appeared to be 59 chromosomes in 79 of 100 metaphase cells (Fig. 1A). The same analysis on PBMC from normal female AGM showed 60 chromosomes (Supplementary Data).36 Because the G-banding karyotypes of Vero cells include several abnormal chromosomes (Fig. 1B), M-FISH was applied to identify chromosomal rearrangements. Human M-FISH probes hybridized efficiently to AGM chromosomes and showed 32 syntenic blocks in normal AGM karyotypes (Fig. 1C). This homology to humans was consistent with previous findings,37 and implied that the human M-FISH signal pattern can be used as a normal AGM reference (Fig. 1C). G-banding and M-FISH analyses revealed that 18 of 37 Vero metaphases represented a main clone with 59 chromosomes. M-FISH identified 40 segments in the Vero metaphases (Fig. 1D), which indicated the occurrence of one fusion and seven translocations. The fusion occurring between chromosomes 7 and 24 led to a reduction in the chromosome number from 60 to 59. Duplications and deletions were also detected in 6 chromosomes (Fig. 1D), showing rearrangements involved in 14 chromosomes. However, major chromosomal rearrangements were not detected in the other 46 chromosomes by G-banding or M-FISH (Fig. 1B and D), which suggested that a haploid chromosome set was retained in its original form. In addition to these common features, additional abnormalities were detected in 11 of 37 cells (Supplementary Data). Although the other eight karyotypes were found to have similar abnormalities, the Vero cell line appeared to include several subclones. The main clone accounted for less than half of the population (18 of 37 cells) and the Vero cell line had a high cytogenetic heterogeneity.

De novo assembly of the Vero genome sequenceTwo paired-end and three different size mate-pair libraries were constructed from Vero cell DNA, and the libraries were sequenced by massively parallel sequencing. The insert size distribution and read length of the libraries are summarized in Supplementary Data. After quality filtering, we obtained a total of ~2.55 billion paired-end and 390 million mate-pair reads. The filtered sequences were used for de novo assembly of the Vero genome. Our final scaffolds consisted of 401,905 scaffolds, which were 2.97 Gb in total, and had the N50 of 508 kb and N90 of 48 kb. The AUGUSTUS program identified 25,877 putative protein-coding genes in the genome scaffolds, using RNA-seq data as a support.3.4. The female C. sabaeus origin of the Vero cell lineageThe Vero cell lineage was originally reported to be established from the kidney of the AGM Cercopithecus aethiops.1,2 However, the species classification of AGMs is a still debated issue and has been revised several times.38,39 In current nomenclature, Cercopithecus aethiops is further classified into four different species of Chlorocebus. To clarify the species origin of the Vero cell lineage, we compared our reads with four previously reported complete mitochondrial sequences of Chlorocebus species: Chlorocebus aethiops, Chlorocebus tantalus, C. sabaeus, and Chlorocebus pygerythrus.40 The mutation rate in the mitochondrial genomes of Old World monkeys is known to be markedly higher than that in nuclear genomes41; therefore, the mitochondrial sequences of these four species had sufficiently diverged to cause mapping bias of short reads. We mapped the paired-end reads to all four Chlorocebus mitochondrial genomes as a reference and found that the mitochondrial genome of C. sabaeus had the highest coverage and lowest divergence to the mitochondrial genome of Vero cells (Supplementary Data). Furthermore, a phylogenetic tree using whole mitochondrial genome sequences indicated that the Vero cell line was closest to C. sabaeus (Fig. 2A). The gender of the AGM individual from which the Vero cell lineage was established has not yet been clearly described. A pair of X chromosomes in karyotyping (Fig. 1) and the almost diploid copy number of X chromosomes in sequence data (Fig. 2B) were observed in Vero JCRB0111 cells. Collectively, we concluded that the Vero cell lineage had been established from a female individual of C. sabaeus. Figure 2.Open in new tabDownload slideGenome landscape of the Vero genome.

Identification of SNVsTo characterize SNVs in the Vero cell line nuclear genome, we mapped our paired-end reads to the reference genome of the rhesus macaque (M. mulatta), which has been annotated more than other non-human primate genome sequences. A total of 92% of the unambiguous sites of the rhesus macaque draft genome was covered with high-quality reads, and the genotype was called with high confidence (genotyping quality score =45 and coverage =10), which indicated that the rhesus macaque genome would work as a reasonable reference sequence for analysing the Vero cell genome. Approximately 58.5 million SNVs were identified (Supplementary Data). Of these, ~51.2 million and 7.3 million SNVs were homozygous and heterozygous, respectively. Most of the homozygous SNVs in the Vero cell line were attributed to evolutionary divergence between the genus Macaca and Chlorocebus, which was ~8–12 million years ago.42,43 The estimated divergence between the rhesus macaque and Vero cell line genomes was ~2.2%. The level of heterozygous SNVs in the Vero cell line was also high and was markedly higher than that in a human individual.44 This may be partly explained by the higher genetic diversity within AGM populations. We also identified ~2.9 and 2.7 million small deletions (=28 bp) and insertions (=44 bp), respectively (Supplementary Data).3.6. Detection of genomic rearrangements in the
Vero cell lineBy comparing our paired-end reads with the publicly available draft genome of the AGM C. sabaeus (C. sabaeus 1.0: GCA_000409795.1), we examined potential >1- kb-scale deletions, segmental duplications, inversions, and translocations using the information of improper paired-end mapping and split-read mapping.45 In order to present a landscape of genomic rearrangements in the main population of the Vero cell lines, we set stringent criteria for finding genome rearrangements that could identify rearrangements of high frequency in the cell population. A total of 138 deletions, 78 duplications, and 12 inversions of high frequency were detected (Fig. 2B; Supplementary Data), whereas none of the translocation candidates were detected at a high frequency. AGM chromosome 12 harboured a homozygous deletion that spanned across nearly 9 Mb (Supplementary Data). The region was syntenic to human chromosome 9 and rhesus macaque chromosome 15 (from MLLT3 to LINGO2) and contained ~40 genes including the type I interferon gene cluster and CDKN2 genes (Fig. 2B and C; Supplementary Data). This homozygous large deletion was validated as given below.3.7. Detection of LOHWe identified copy number variations in different genomic regions using the mapping coverage of paired-end reads. Nine regions in chromosomes 2q, 8q, 15q, 16q, 21, 23q, 28, and Xq had three copies, while eight regions at 3p, 7p, 13p, 17q, 21q, 27q, and Xq were identified as a single copy (Fig. 2B). AGM chromosome 8p showed an intermediate coverage between two and three copies, in which the duplication and translocation of AGM chromosome 8p varied among the clones. These large-scale copy number changes agreed well with the karyotypes examined using M-FISH analysis (Fig. 1D). LOH regions were identified using the density of SNVs and its ratio to the density of homozygous SNVs. In addition to the identified haploid regions, we identified large LOH blocks in chromosomes 6q, 12q, and 23. The LOH on chromosome 12 harboured a large homozygous deletion (Fig. 2C; Supplementary Data; see also below).3.8. Validation of large deletions by PCRThe large deletions predicted by the massively parallel sequencing system were validated by genomic PCR. Regarding the 8.85-Mb deletion of chromosome 12, a set of PCR primers striding across the deletion junction produced a ~230-bp amplicon from Vero cells, but not from normal AGM cells, while a PCR primer set designated for the AGM genome produced a predicted amplicon from normal AGM cells, but not from Vero cells (Fig. 3A). We tested two Vero cell lines, JCRB0111 and ATCC CCL81, and obtained identical results (Fig. 3A). In similar validation tests for another four large (>90 kb) predicted deletions (Supplementary Data), DNA fragments with breakpoint junctions were amplified from the Vero cell lines, but not from AGM PBMC for all these deletions, which confirmed the existence of these deletions in Vero cells (Fig. 3A; Supplementary Data). Four small (1–2 kb) predicted deletions were also confirmed to exist (Fig. 3B; Supplementary Data). Figure 3.Open in new tabDownload slideValidation of genomic deletions in Vero cells by PCR analysis. Large deletions (>90 kb deletions) (A) and some small deletions (1–2 kb deletions) (B) were selected. Although the genomic PCR confirmed the existence of breakpoint junctions for the 573 kb deletion in chromosome 21 and the 294 kb deletion in chromosome 9, a part of these regions appeared to exist somewhere in the genome (A; see also Supplementary Data). Amplicons corresponding to the deletions predicted in chromosomes 1 and 10 were produced not only from Vero cells, but also from AGM PBMC, while amplicons corresponding to the ‘non-deleted’ counterparts were not produced even from AGM PBMC (B; see also Supplementary Data), which indicated that our determined sequences for the Vero cell genome existed homozygously in these regions not only in Vero cells, but also in AGM PBMC. This paradox might be attributed to the possible incompleteness of the currently available version of the AGM whole-genome draft sequence or polymorphic state of the deletion within AGM populations.

Proviral SRV in the Vero JCRB0111 genomeAnalysis of collected SRV-related short reads from all paired-end short reads of the Vero JCRB0111 cell line, followed by analyses of gene assignment and long terminal repeat (LTR) finding, identified the 8,367 bp complete SRV genome sequence. The medians of variant frequencies were 25.5 and 8.0% in the highly variable and env-deleted region (nucleotide position 7525–7829) of SRV, respectively (Fig. 4). The copy number of SRV with 8.4-kb full length was estimated to be 30%, while that of SRV with the deletion of the 7525–7883 nucleotide (nt) region encompassing the C-terminal part in env and a portion of LTR was 70%. The SRV-Vero of JCRB0111 had 97% of the same nucleotides as those of ATCC CCL81 (Genbank_ID: JN134185). The number of minor alleles was 703 for SNVs and 1 for the insertion among the whole complete consensus SRV sequence in the Vero JCRB0111 genome. Four minor mutation sites caused three nonsense mutations and one frameshift on the pol or env region (Supplementary Data). Previous studies suggested a frameshift mutation in pol (position 3726) or frameshift mutation in prt (its position was not reported) on the SRV proviral sequences of Vero E6 or ATCC CCL81 cells.46,47 However, our study did not detect equivalent mutations on the SRV proviral sequences of Vero JCRB0111 cells; however, other notable mutations were instead detected (Supplementary Data).

DiscussionBy comparing with the AGM reference genome, the whole genome structure of Vero cells provided various important insights into the molecular characterization of this cell line. Vero cells are incapable of producing type I interferon in response to viral infections,48 which may be the main cause for the high susceptibility of these cells to various types of microbes. The homozygous deletion of a- and ß1-interferon genes in Vero cells was previously reported using classical DNA hybridization analysis.49 The present study determined an ~9- Mb deleted region in chromosome 12 at the nucleotide level and further revealed an ~59-Mb LOH around the deleted region (Fig. 2B and C), which suggested that an ~9-Mb deletion first occurred in one of two homologous chromosome 12 during the establishment of cells, followed by a large-scale conversion that fixed the homozygous deletion of the region in the Vero cell lineage. The deleted region in chromosome 12 of Vero cells is syntenic to human chromosome 9p21–p22, which contains many genes of type I interferons (a8, a2, a1/13, a6, a14, a4, a17, a21, <U+03C9>1, and ß1) (Supplementary Data).The human syntenic region corresponding to the deleted region in AGM chromosome 12 also contained CDKN2A and CDKN2B: CDKN2A encodes cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor 2A/p16INK4A (which inhibits CDK6, a negative regulator of the retinoblastoma protein pRB) and p14ARF (which inhibits the p53-negative regulator MDM2) in an alternate reading frame to the former, while CDKN2B encodes CDK inhibitor 2B/p15INK4B (which inhibits another pRB-negative regulator CDK4) (Supplementary Data).50,51 The CDK inhibitors and MDM2 inhibitor act as key regulators of the cell cycle, and mutations in CDKN2A-CDKN2B often occur in various types of human cancer; however, these mutations by themselves are not enough to transform cells into tumourigenic cells.50–52 The loss of both CDKN2A and CDKN2B may play a crucial role in the acquirement of immortality in the Vero cell lineage. Originally non-tumourigenic Vero cells may then acquire tumourigenicity when additional unknown mutations accumulate during prolonged passages.15Although the karyological analysis demonstrated that Vero cells had various chromosomal rearrangements (Fig. 1C), no translocation was identified in the whole-genome sequence (Fig. 2B). This discrepancy may have been due to technical limitations. The karyotyping results obtained showed that most of the translocation events occurred between the telomeric regions of chromosomes, which could not be identified by sequencing if chromosomes fused via repeat sequences. In addition, in order to filter out rare chromosomal rearrangements in a cell population, events that occurred in only one of the homologous chromosomes may not be identified in our filtering criteria. Therefore, the absence of translocation rearrangements by sequencing does not contradict the results of the karyological analysis, which showed that all or most chromosomal translocations were observed in one of the two homologous chromosomes (Fig. 1C and D; Supplementary Data). Haplotype sequencing may be necessary to determine such heterozygous events.Many SRV sequence variations existed in Vero JCRB0111 cells (Fig. 4). As for SRV associated with the vaccine-producing Vero E6 cell line (the parental cell line of which is ATCC CCL81), a frame-shifting single-nucleotide insertion in the polymerase gene was identified.46 This frameshifting mutation was not detected in SRV associated with the Vero ATCC CCL81 cell line47 or Vero JCRB0111 cell line (this study). SRV variant sequences lacking the U3 and R regions of 3'LTR were instead detected in Vero ATCC CCL81-associated SRV,47 while the results of this study suggested that some SRV copies in the Vero JCRB0111 cell genome were defective in the env-3'LTR region (Fig. 4). Thus, a large amount of diversity may occur in proviral SRV sequences during the passage of Vero cells.Various quality tests must be conducted in order to fully characterize cell banks for pharmaceutical use53 (The WHO guidelines on animal cell substrates are available at http://www.who.int/biologicals/vaccines/TRS_978_Annex_3.pdf.) Many of these tests rely on conventional methodology, and some tests still use many experimental animals. The whole-genome sequence should be invaluable reference information to develop more rational and effective methods for identification, genetic stability, and microbial agents in pharmaceutical cell banks. For example, the currently authorized tests for cell identity consist of classical methods (e.g. isoenzyme analysis and G-band analysis) and more modern DNA profiling methods (e.g. restriction fragment length polymorphism and variable number of tandem repeats analysis). These tests, even if not all, require a considerable amount of time and money as well as well-trained technical skills, and some are not accurate enough to discriminate different cell lines established from the same biological species. This study presented a proof of the concept that PCR analysis will open a rapid and accurate alternative method for the cell identity test to detect unique chromosomal deletions (Fig. 3). Metagenome analysis is a powerful approach that can be used to survey microbial contamination in biological pharmaceuticals.46,47,54 This study also employed DNA-seq short reads of Vero cell genome DNA to comprehensively survey microbe-related sequences in the cell sample, and detected no discernible sign of microbe-relevant sequences (except for endogenous SRV) in Vero JCRB0111 cells. In this direction, it is crucial to distinguish between endogenous and exogenous viral-like sequences, because the appearance of the former is inevitable and can serve as an internal positive control in metagenomic analysis for microbial agents. In addition, the heterogeneity in SRV sequences as discussed above may also be a good genomic signature for identifying a specific cell seed among various Vero cell sub-lines. The whole-genome sequence of Vero cells will also be an invaluable resource for engineering the specific genes of cells by recently advanced genome-editing technologies.In conclusion, this study showed the genomic characteristics of Vero cells, which have been a good cell model for microbial infection for a long time. In addition, the genome landscape will be a crucial resource not only for the quality control of Vero cell lines, but also for the development of novel sub-lines in the future.Authors’ contributionsOverall planning: K.H.; design and performing experiments: N.O., A.K., T.Y., and M.K.; data analysis: N.O., A.K., T.Y., N.H., F.K., T.S., M.K., and K.H.; manuscript writing: N.O., A.K., T.Y., T.S., M.K., and K.H.

IntroductionA common objective of many studies in the field of environmental microbiology is to evaluate the functional diversity of the complex microbial communities colonizing natural or man-made environments, fresh or marine waters, sediments, soils, digestive tracts or food products. This diversity can be apprehended through the systematic sequencing and functional annotation of DNA (metagenomics) or RNA (metatranscriptomics) molecules directly extracted from environmental samples.1,2 However, as a result of the extreme taxonomic richness of most microbial communities, high-throughput shotgun sequencing of environmental nucleic acids is far from covering their full gene repertoire.3 Alternatively, many studies focus on specific environmental processes which, for some of them, are controlled by a limited and defined set of genes encoding key enzymes. The diversity of the corresponding gene families and of the organisms that possess and express them is classically evaluated by the systematic sequencing and taxonomic annotation of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified gene fragments from environmental DNA or RNA (metabarcoding).4–7 This latter approach has itself well-documented limitations. One of the limitations is that the use of a single pair of degenerate primers, designed to hybridize to internal gene consensus sequences, usually fails to amplify all homologous sequences present in an environmental sample.8 Another, often underestimated limitation is that metabarcoding does not allow amplification of full-length functional genes. Besides limiting the number of phylogenetically informative nucleotide positions for precise phylogenetic assignment of environmental sequences, obtaining partial sequences also prevents their functional study by expression in a heterologous microbial host. Full-length functional genes are yet of importance (i) in ecology to establish potential relationships between enzyme catalytic properties (substrate range, sensitivity to physicochemical parameters) and prevailing environmental conditions and (ii) in environmental biotechnology to isolate novel biocatalysts for industrial purpose.Recently, Denonfoux et al.9 developed an alternative strategy to explore microbial communities from complex environments. Based on solution hybrid selection (hereafter referred to as SHS), this method allows for the specific recovery of large DNA fragments harbouring biomarkers of interest even from rare or unknown microorganisms. Indeed, SHS is based on the design of several oligonucleotide probes which can cover the whole gene of interest as opposed to PCR strategies targeting internal regions. Moreover, explorative probe design strategies using appropriate software such as HiSpOD10 or KASpOD11 allow recovering not yet described homologous sequences.9 These probes are synthesized as biotinylated RNA oligonucleotides and hybridized, in solution, to the target gene sequences diluted among a majority of non-target DNA fragments. The hybrid molecules (biotinylated probes + target sequences) are then specifically captured by affinity binding on streptavidin-coated paramagnetic beads. SHS can be repeated several times successively to increase the enrichment in desired sequences by a factor of up to 1.7 × 105 times.9 In environmental microbiology, the captured DNA fragments can be subjected to high-throughput sequencing. In silico assembly of the reads not only leads to the reconstruction of the full-length sequences of the different members of the targeted gene family, but also of their genomic environment and could therefore facilitate operon reconstructions.9In microbial ecology, SHS has thus far been successfully used to capture archaeal protein-coding genes from environmental DNA.9 As previously discussed,12 environmental DNA is however not the most appropriate matrix to recover full-length functional genes of eukaryotic origin, which could be easily expressed in a heterologous microbial host. Environmental polyadenylated messenger RNAs, devoid of introns, represent a better source of eukaryotic genes which, following their conversion into complementary DNAs (cDNAs), can be expressed in either bacteria or yeasts.12–16Soil eukaryotes such as fungi are highly diverse,17,18 play essential roles in soil biology as, for example, the main agents in plant organic matter degradation19,20 and represent a rich source of enzymes and biomolecules used in industry.21 Despite these obvious interests, very few environmental genomics studies specifically focus on soil eukaryote functional diversity.22To promote such studies, we developed and evaluated in the present report an original adaptation of the SHS for the efficient recovery of full-length functional fungal cDNAs synthesized from soil RNA. Successful development of this technique was favoured by the ever increasing number of available fungal genomes that provide a correspondingly large number of members of specific gene families for the design of hybridization probes.23 The fungal gene family targeted in this study is the Glycoside Hydrolase 11 (GH11) family which encode endo-ß-1,4-xylanases (E.C. 3.2.1.8) (CAZY Carbohydrate Active Enzymes database, http://www.cazy.org).24 As xylan is the second most abundant polysaccharide in nature and one of the major structural polysaccharide in the plant cell wall, such enzymes have an obvious importance for soil ecology and for the degradation of plant hemicelluloses. A recent study also suggested that fungi contributed to most xylanase activity in soils.25 Furthermore, GH11 enzymes are also abundantly used in different industrial processes.26 GH11 genes are present in the genomes of numerous fungi, mainly Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, and at the start of this study, >300 sequences were publicly available. Furthermore, in a random shotgun sequencing of forest soil eukaryotic polyA-mRNAs, it was shown that GH11 transcripts occurred at a low frequency ranging from 0 to 1 per 104 sequences obtained.22,272. Materials and methods2.1. Soil RNA extraction and cDNA synthesisFour different forest soils from France and Italy were used in this study (see Supplementary Data for sites and soils characteristics). At each site, between 30 (BEW) and 60 (BRH) sieved (2 mm) soil cores were mixed together to constitute composite samples which were stored at -75°C prior to RNA extraction. RNA was extracted from 4 to 48 g of soil using protocols adapted to each soil. RNA from the Puéchabon (PUE) sample was extracted according to Luis et al.28 RNA from the Breuil Spruce (BRE) and Breuil Beech (BRH) samples was extracted according to Damon et al.29 RNA from the Berchidda (BEW) sample was extracted using the PowerSoil® Total RNA Isolation Kit (Mo Bio Laboratories), according to the manufacturer's instructions. All RNA samples were treated with RNase-free DNase I to remove residual DNA contaminations and quantified by spectrophotometry (ND-1000 NanoDrop®, Thermo Scientific).Eukaryotic cDNAs were synthesized from 2 µg of total soil RNA by using the Mint-2 cDNA synthesis and amplification kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Evrogen). First-strand synthesis was initiated at the RNA 3' poly-A end using a modified poly-dT primer (CDS-4M). The number of PCR cycles (between 22 and 30) necessary for optimal synthesis of the double-stranded cDNA (dscDNA) was evaluated for each cDNA sample. As a result of using the Mint-2 kit, all amplified cDNAs were bordered at their 5' end by the M1 sequence (AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGT) and the SfiIA restriction site (GGCCATTACGGCC) while, at their 3' end, they were bordered by the SfiIB restriction site (GGCCGAGGCGGCC) and the M1 sequence. dscDNA was purified by phenol–chloroform extraction, precipitated by 2.5 volume of ethanol and 0.1 volume of sodium acetate, resuspended in ultrapure water and quantified.2.2. Capture probe design and synthesisAs in July 2012, all publicly available GH11 DNA coding sequences of eukaryotic origin were identified by BLAST searches30 and collected from GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/), the Joint Genome Institute database (http://jgi.doe.gov/), the Broad Institute genome database (http://www.broadinstitute.org/) and CAZy (http://www.cazy.org/). A set of thirty-five 31-mers, degenerate capture probes, targeting the catalytic domain of the encoded proteins (pfam no. PF00457, ~540 nucleotide long; Supplementary Data), was designed from a collection of 342 coding DNA sequences using the KASpOD software.11 Individual probe coverage ranged from 7 to 54% of the 342 sequences, leading to a probe set coverage of 90% (four allowed mismatches).The 35 oligonucleotide probes included the specific sequences (X)31 targeting cDNAs encoding GH11 and adaptor sequences at each extremities for PCR amplification: ATCGCACCAGCGTGT-(X)31-CACTGCGGCTCCTCA (Supplementary Data and Supplementary Data). Biotinylated RNA capture probes were prepared according to the two-step procedure of Gnirke et al.31 In the first step, each single-stranded DNA probe was amplified by PCR using primers complementary to the 5' and 3' adaptors to allow double-strand DNA formation. In the second step, agarose gel-purified double-stranded DNA probes were converted into biotinylated RNA probes by in vitro transcription using the MEGAScript®T7 kit (Ambion) and biotin-dUTP (TeBu Bio). RNA probes were then mixed together in equimolar amounts.2.3. cDNA capturecDNA capture was carried out as described by Denonfoux et al.9 and summarized in Supplementary Data. Briefly, 500 ng of heat denatured PCR-amplified cDNAs were hybridized to the equimolar mix of biotinylated RNA probes (500 ng) for 24 h at 65°C. Probe/cDNA hybrids were trapped by streptavidin-coated paramagnetic beads (Dynabeads® M-280 Streptavidin, Invitrogen). After different washing steps to remove unbound cDNAs, the captured cDNAs were eluted from the beads using 50 µl of 0.1 M NaOH at room temperature, neutralized with 70 µl of 1 M Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, and purified using the Qiaquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen).Captured cDNAs were PCR amplified using primer M1 that binds at both 5' and 3' ends of the cDNAs. PCRs were set up using 5 µl of eluate, 200 µM of deoxynucleotides (dNTPs), 400 nM primer M1, 5 µl of reaction buffer 10× (Evrogen) and 1 µl of 50× Encyclo DNA polymerase (Evrogen) in a final volume of 50 µl. After an initial denaturation at 95°C for 1 min, cDNAs were amplified for 25 cycles comprising 15 s at 95°C, 20 s at 66°C and 3 min at 72°C. Ten independent amplifications were conducted for each sample. PCR products of the same sample were purified on QIAquick columns (Qiagen) and pooled. A second round of hybridization and PCR amplification was performed using each of the amplified cDNA samples obtained after the first hybridization capture. Purified products originating from the same cDNA sample were pooled together and quantified by spectrophotometry (NanoDrop™ 2000, Thermo Scientific). The DNA quality and size distribution of captured cDNA were assessed on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer DNA 12000 chip (Agilent Technologies).2.4. Semi-quantitative PCREnrichment in GH11 sequences at each step of the capture protocol was evaluated by semi-quantitative PCR using different quantities of cDNAs and GH11-fungal-specific degenerate primers GH11-F (GGVAAGGGITGGAAYCNNGG) and GH11-R (TGKCGRACIGACCARTAYTG) amplifying a ±281-bp fragment (Luis P. et al., unpublished). PCRs were performed using 10, 1, 0.1 or 0.01 ng cDNAs obtained before and after one or two cycles of hybridization capture. Twenty-five microlitres of PCR mixes contained 1 µl of template cDNA, 2.5 µl of 10× PCR buffer without Mg (Invitrogen), 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.8 mM of each dNTP, 0.5 µM of each primer and 1 U of Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). After an initial denaturation at 94°C for 3 min, GH11 gene fragments were amplified for 45 cycles comprising 45 s at 94°C, 45 s at 50°C and 2 min at 72°C. After a final elongation at 72°C for 10 min, 10 µl of PCR products were run in a 1.5% ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel.2.5. High-throughput sequencingDiversity of GH11 sequences at each step of the capture protocol was evaluated by high-throughput sequencing of GH11 PCR products obtained, as described above, using primers GH11-F and GH11-R. PCRs were performed using cDNAs obtained before and after one or two cycles of hybridization capture. Twenty-five microlitres of PCR mixes contained 10 ng of template cDNA, 2.5 µl of 10× PCR buffer without Mg (Invitrogen), 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.8 mM of each dNTP, 0.5 µM of each primer and 1.25 U of DNA polymerase (a 24:1 mix of Invitrogen Taq DNA polymerase and Biorad iProof polymerase). PCR cycling conditions were as described above. Five different PCRs were prepared and run in parallel for each cDNA sample. PCR products were first checked on 1.5% agarose gel before pooling together the five replicates and purification using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Paired-end sequencing (2 × 250 bp) was carried out on an Illumina MiSeq sequencer (Fasteris, Switzerland).Paired-end reads were assembled using PandaSeq v.2.5,32 and all sequences containing unidentified nucleotide positions (‘N’) were filtered out. Primers and barcodes were removed using MOTHUR v.1.30.2.33 UCHIME34 was used for chimera detection, and sequence clusters were constructed at a 95% nucleotide sequence identity threshold. The most abundant representative sequence of each of the most abundant clusters, altogether encompassing >90% of the sequences, was translated into amino acid sequence using the ORF Finder tool of the Sequence Manipulation Suite35 (http://www.bioinformatics.org/sms2/). Shannon diversity indices (H') were calculated after rarefying the different data sets from the same soil to the same sequencing depth (i.e. the lowest sequencing depth of the three samples of each soil, Table 2). Venn diagrams were drawn using the BioVenn tool (http://www.cmbi.ru.nl/cdd/biovenn/).2.6. Full-length cDNA cloning and sequencingAmplified cDNAs obtained after two rounds of hybridization capture were digested by SfiI (Fermentas), which recognizes two distinct SfiIA and SfiIB sites located at the 5' and 3' ends of the cDNAs, respectively. Digested cDNAs were then ligated to the SfiI-digested pDR196-SfiI-Kan yeast expression vector36 modified to contain two SfiIA and SfiIB sites, downstream of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae PMA1 promoter, thus allowing the directional cloning and potential constitutive expression of the cDNAs in yeast.Several transformed, kanamycin-resistant Escherichia coli (One Shot® TOP10 strain, Invitrogen) colonies from each sample were first randomly selected and subjected to colony PCR using the GH11-F and GH11-R primers to detect the presence of a GH11 cDNA insert. cDNA inserts from PCR-positive bacterial colonies were entirely sequenced by BIOFIDAL (Villeurbanne, France) using a PMA1 primer (CTCTCTTTTATACACACATTC) and additional internal primers when necessary.2.7. Plasmid library construction, yeast transformation and functional screeningFor each cDNA sample, a minimum of 2,000 independent kanamycin-resistant transformed E. coli colonies were pooled together for plasmid extraction using the alkaline lysis method.37 Aliquot samples of each plasmid library were used to transform the S. cerevisiae strain DSY-5 (MATa leu2 trp1 ura3-52 his3::PGAL1-GAL4 pep4 prb1-1122; Dualsystems Biotech) using a standard lithium acetate protocol.38 Transformed yeasts were selected on a solid yeast nitrogen base (YNB) minimal medium supplemented with glucose (2%) and amino acids, but lacking uracil. YNB agar plates were overlaid by a thin layer of the same medium containing 4 mg l-1 of AZCL-xylan (Megazyme), a substrate specific for endo-xylanases. Plates were incubated at 30°C. Yeast colonies producing a secreted endo-xylanase were surrounded by a dark blue halo resulting from the hydrolysis of AZCL-xylan.For each sample, several yeast colonies positive for endo-xylanase activity were picked, lysed at 95°C for 10 min in 3 µl of 20 mM NaOH and the pDR196 insert amplified by PCR using primers PMA1 and ADH (GCGAATTTCTTATGATTTATG). PCR products were sequenced by BIOFIDAL using the PMA1 primer.2.8. Phylogenetic analysesSequences obtained from plasmid inserts were manually edited and corrected. Deduced amino acid sequences were aligned using MUSCLE39 to GH11 amino acid sequences obtained from public databases. Maximum likelihood phylogeny analyses were generated with the PhyML 3.0 program using the WAG substitution model as implemented in SeaView v. 4.40 Phylogenetic trees were drawn in MEGA v. 6.412.9. Sequence accessibilitySequences from plasmid inserts are available in the EBI/DDJB/GenBank databases under accession Nos. LK932029-LK932091. Illumina MiSeq sequence reads have been deposited in the Sequence Read Archive of the EBI database under study no. PRJEB6672.3. Results3.1. GH11 cDNA captureAs in July 2012, we identified and collected 342 full-length eukaryotic GH11 DNA coding sequences from public databases, from 113 fungal species and from 2 non-fungal ones. Seventy-two percent of these sequences were from Ascomycotina (85 species), 20% from Basidiomycotina (26 species) and 7% from other taxonomic groups. Prevalence of sequences from Ascomycotina is likely to reflect a greater genome sequencing effort in this taxonomic group, rather than a higher occurrence of the GH11 family among Ascomycotina.23 Among the publicly available sequences, those putatively full-length sequences ranged in size from 639 to 2,099 bp. Occurrence of carbohydrate-binding motives or of C-terminal, non-catalytic extensions in the encoded polypeptides accounted for most of these size variations. The 35 degenerate capture probes were exclusively designed on the shared ca. 540-bp-long conserved catalytic domain and were susceptible to hybridize to 90% of the collected sequences.SHS was performed on cDNAs synthesized from polyadenylated mRNAs extracted from four different forest soils. Electrophoregrams of all cDNAs recovered after two successive rounds of capture were characterized by a background smear of which emerged discrete bands ranging in size from 300 to 1,500 bp (Fig. 1).

Each band could encompass one or several unique but abundant GH11 cDNAs.Successful enrichment in GH11 sequences along the capture protocol was demonstrated by semi-quantitative PCR using GH11-specific PCR primers and different quantities of cDNA in the PCRs (from 10 to 0.01 ng). As illustrated in Fig. 2 for the Breuil beech forest (BRH sample) and for the other soil samples discussed in Supplementary Data, clear positive amplification of a GH11 fragment after two rounds of capture was always obtained using the lowest quantity of cDNA (0.01 ng), whereas no amplification could be observed for the same amount of cDNA prior to SHS.

Cloning, sequencing and heterologous expression
of captured cDNACaptured cDNAs in the range of 700–1,500 bp were cloned into the pDR196 E. coli/S. cerevisiae shuttle expression vector to constitute four soil-specific GH11-enriched plasmid libraries (Table 1). Forty recombinant colonies per library were randomly screened by PCR using GH11-specific primers to evaluate the percentage of GH11-containing recombinant plasmids. Efficient enrichment occurred for all libraries with 80 to >90% of positive clones (Table 1). Among the 55 fully sequenced plasmid inserts from PCR- positive colonies, all but two indeed corresponded to GH11 sequences (Table 1). Seventy-two percent of the sequences encoded putatively full-length GH11 polypeptides based on alignment length to known GH11 polypeptides and the presence of in-frame putative start and stop codons. Out of them, 15% were characterized by the presence of a family 1 carbohydrate-binding domain (CBM1) in a C-terminal position. Cloning and characterization of captured GH11 cDNAsCloning and characterization of captured GH11 cDNAsFunctional screening using S. cerevisiae was conducted on the four GH11-enriched plasmid libraries by plating the recombinant yeasts onto a medium supplemented with an endo-xylanase-specific colour reagent (AZCL-xylan). Depending on the library, between 1.5 (sample PUE) and 25% (sample BRH) of the transformed yeast colonies developed a dark blue halo demonstrating secretion of a functional endo-xylanase (Supplementary Data). All 11 sequenced plasmid inserts from these xylanase-positive yeast colonies encoded GH11 proteins (ranged between 221 and 289 amino acids in length); 5 of them had already been identified among sequences obtained from bacterial colonies and 4 had a C-terminal CBM1 domain. The percent sequence identity between the catalytic domain of the selected functional proteins and the catalytic domain of their closest Blastp hits in GenBank ranged between 69% (81% similarity) and 87% (94% similarity).3.3. Selectivity of the SHS GH11 captureTo evaluate the diversity of GH11 sequences at each step of the capture protocol, we performed a high-throughput Illumina MiSeq sequencing of GH11 amplicons obtained from all four cDNA samples, prior (H0) and after one (H1) or two (H2) cycles of SHS capture. Paired-end sequence reads were assembled to reconstitute the ca. 281-bp-long amplicons. Altogether, the total data set contained 334,161 full-length amplicon sequences that were clustered at a 95% nucleotide sequence identity threshold to produce a total number of 1,458 clusters, of which 1,001 (69%) were singletons (data summarized in Table 2 for each sample). Each of the 12 sequence data sets (4 cDNA samples × the 3 steps of the SHS) was characterized by few dominant clusters encompassing most of the sequences and a large number of clusters each containing a few, or even a single, sequences (illustrated in Fig. 3A for the PUE sample). None of the sequences obtained were identical to sequences deposited in databases. Only 17 of the sequence clusters, of which 14 exclusively from the BEW site, were >90% identical (maximum value of 97.5%) at the nucleotide level over their entire length to GH11 genes from either the Basidiomycota Tulasnella calospora or the Ascomycota Nectria haematococca and Pyrenophora teres.

Venn diagrams drawn using only these most prominent sequence clusters, encompassing altogether 90–93% of sample sequences, showed that there existed a larger overlap between the post-capture samples H1 and H2 than between the pre-capture samples H0 and H1 or H2 (Fig. 3B). This trend was observed, to some extent, for samples BEW, BRE and PUE, but not for the BRH one which differed from the others by the dominance of only three clusters in the H0 cDNA pool which encompassed 90% of the sequenced reads (Supplementary Data). Despite these apparent differences in sequence distribution between the pre-capture H0 and the post-capture H1 and H2 samples, sequence diversity indices, such as the Shannon index, did not differ between the pre- and post-capture sequence pools (Table 2, with the exception of the BRH sample). Between 2.7% (BRE and BEW) and 15% (PUE and BRH) of the sequence clusters were shared between two sites. Eight sequence clusters were identified in all four studied sites.To address the phylogenetic diversity of the captured sequences, we first produced an amino acid sequence alignment of 62 known GH11 proteins representative of the phylogenetic diversity of this gene family. To this alignment, we added the GH11 sequences obtained by the random sequencing of plasmid inserts, the sequences producing a functional enzyme in yeast and the sequences representative of the most abundant Illumina sequence clusters before (H0) or after (H1 and H2) SHS capture. The GH11 family is a highly diversified and fast-evolving gene family and phylogenies based either on full-length protein sequence alignments or on partial alignments, as in the present case, clearly do not reflect the species phylogenies and comprise very few well-supported internal branches (Fig. 4). Phylogenetic trees obtained for sequences from the four studied soils (Fig. 4; Supplementary Data) all clearly showed that the captured sequences were distributed over the entire reference tree.

DiscussionThe results obtained clearly demonstrate that SHS represents a powerful strategy to select full-length cDNAs, representative of a specific gene family, originally diluted in a highly complex metatranscriptomic sequence pool. This protocol was successfully implemented on four different forest soil RNA samples. Based on previous estimates of the frequency of GH11 sequences among eukaryotic cDNA for two of the soils used in this study (BRE and BRH),22 two successive cycles of SHS have the potential to enrich specific cDNA sequences by a factor of at least 104. As suggested by the results of the semi-quantitative PCR, in some cases (e.g. the PUE sample, Supplementary Data), one cycle of capture may be sufficient to get a maximum level of enrichment, while in other cases two cycles seem required (e.g. the BRH sample, Fig. 2).Sequence analysis of PCR fragments amplified from pre- or post-capture cDNAs demonstrated that capture succeeded in selecting both a large number and phylogenetically diverse representatives of the selected gene family. Furthermore, none of the captured sequences appeared to be identical to already known ones which we originally used for probe design. Capture could however preferentially select sequences that were not necessarily among the most abundant in the original cDNA pool. This should be evaluated in the future by quantitative PCR. Despite explorative probe design strategy, publicly available homologous sequences at the start of the study greatly influence the capture selectivity. Probe sets utilized to capture a given biomarker should therefore be upgraded regularly, taking into account newly deposited sequences.Thanks to the ever increasing number of published fungal genomes, representative of the phylogenetic diversity of this taxonomic group; explorative probe design strategies could be carried out to unravel the metabolic capacities of these microorganisms within different ecosystems. Besides GH11 sequences, SHS capture can be implemented for any other gene family of interest, allowing a comprehensive taxonomic or functional description of the studied microbial community. As mentioned in the introduction, sequence capture presents the advantage over PCR to give access to the full-length gene sequence, including facultative modules, not always associated to the studied catalytic domain. This was indeed the case for the GH11, for which we estimated that 72% of the captured sequences were full length and that 15% of them processed a C-terminal, fungal-specific, CBM1 module (see the CAZy database, http://www.cazy.org). A discrepancy however existed between the estimated fraction of full-length captured GH11 cDNA and the systematically lower fraction of cDNAs which produced a functional enzyme upon expression in S. cerevisiae. The absence of expression in yeast can be attributed to a number of independent factors such as bias in codon usage, non-recognition by S. cerevisiae of the protein signal peptide necessary for correct secretion, protein misfolding or hyperglycosylation. Some of these problems could be addressed by using expression plasmids including a yeast signal peptide downstream of the cloning site and/or by using a different yeast species for protein production.Sequencing of PCR fragments amplified from captured cDNAs also indicate that altogether the four captured cDNA samples obtained in this single study encompass a greater number of novel and different GH11 sequences than have been deposited and are available in public databases over several decades. This observation should promote the use of cDNA sequence capture (i) as a complementary approach to PCR to explore and quantify the extent of eukaryotic functional diversity in complex environments, but also (ii) as a powerful tool in environmental biotechnology to efficiently screen for enzyme variants with novel biochemical properties.FundingC.B. was supported by the University of Turin and the région Rhône-Alpes (CMIRA program); C.R. received a graduate grant from the Ministère de l'Enseignement Supérieur et de la Recherche; N.P. was funded by the Direction Générale de l'Armement and E.P. by the Agence Nationale pour la Recherche.

IntroductionChickpea [Cicer arietinum (L.)] belongs to the member of West Asian Neolithic crop assemblage which is associated with the origin and evolution of ancient agriculture in the central part of the Fertile Crescent ~10,000–12,000 years ago.1 Chickpea is believed to have originated from areas of present-day South Eastern Turkey and Syria, where three wild annual Cicer species, namely Cicer reticulatum, Cicer echinospermum and Cicer bijugum, are found. The genus Cicer comprises 44 species, including 35 wild perennials, 8 wild annuals and 1 cultivated annual.2,3 All these annual Cicer species have an identical ploidy level and chromosome number (2n = 2x = 16)4,5 with an expected genome size of ~740 Mb.6 The 44 annual and perennial Cicer species are grouped into three gene pools based on their crossability relationships with cultivated chickpea.7 The primary gene pool comprises cultivated C. arietinum species and its progenitor, C. reticulatum, which is freely crossable with cultivated chickpea (desi and kabuli) for a normal gene exchange.8 The secondary gene pool consists of C. echinospermum, a species which is crossable with cultivated chickpea, but hybrids result in reduced fertility. The tertiary gene pool consists of remaining 6 annual and 35 perennial species that are not readily crossable with cultivated species, which requires some specialized techniques for their gene transfer in the cultivated background. As far as crossability of the wild species with cultivated gene pool is concerned, attempts were made to exploit the wild annual Cicer species for genetic base broadening, which suggests that C. reticulatum and C. echinospermum species can be inter-crossed with the cultivated C. arietinum species.9–11 Moreover, these annual wild species signify a valuable and potential source of diverse gene pool for improving yield and abiotic/biotic stress tolerance in cultivated chickpea.12–17 Many studies have introduced the genetically diverse wild relatives with beneficial traits (primarily belonging to primary and secondary gene pools) through inter-specific hybridization for enhancing the seed and pod yield potential and stress tolerance in chickpea cultivars.13,14,16,18 To accelerate such process of genetic enhancement in chickpea, the use of efficient and modern genomics-assisted breeding approaches like trait-associated genes/quantitative trait loci (QTLs) identification from wild accessions and their marker-aided introgression into cultivated gene pool are much required at present.The discovery and impact of sequence-based robust simple sequence repeat (SSR) and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in view of their desirable genetic attributes (co-dominant inheritance, reproducibility, bi-/multi-allelic nature and abundant genomic distribution) have been well studied in chickpea8,19–37 for various large-scale genotyping applications including construction of high-resolution genome map and identification/mapping of genes/QTLs regulating important agronomic traits. Earlier, low-scale genotyping information (allelic variants) specifically of a limited number of SSR markers scanned from inter-specific bi-parental mapping population (C. arietinum × C. reticulatum) involving cultivated and wild accessions have been utilized to map QTLs controlling important traits of interest, including beta-carotene, seed weight, fusarium wilt and ascochyta blight resistance in chickpea.8,38–41 The latest draft genome sequences of desi and kabuli chickpea cultivars42,43 enabled to select a large number of genome-wide SSR and SNP markers from pseudomolecules of eight chromosomes based on their physical positions (bp) for uniform as well as high saturation genome and gene/QTL mapping in chickpea. No such systematic efforts have yet been made at a genome-wide scale involving wild Cicer accessions for identification and fine mapping of robust QTLs/genes controlling important agronomic traits in chickpea. Henceforth, novel allelic variants mined from wild accessions by high-throughput genotyping of genome-wide informative SSR and SNP markers in an advanced generation bi-parental mapping population could be useful to identify robust and major QTLs regulating important agro-morphological traits in chickpea through genetic/QTL mapping. The robust trait-influencing major QTLs identified and mapped on chickpea genome/chromosomes can be refined by combining QTL mapping with QTL region-specific high-resolution association analysis, differential expression profiling and gene haplotype-based association/linkage disequilibrium (LD) mapping to delineate trait regulatory genes, alleles and haplotypes at target QTL intervals in chickpea. The major advantages of such integrated approaches lies in narrowing down the long trait-specific QTL intervals to specific candidate genes regulating complex quantitative traits including low-phosphorous stress tolerance in soybean.44 Overall, the combinatorial genomic approach would facilitate the identification of more robust trait-regulatory functionally relevant molecular tags (QTLs, genes, alleles and superior haplotypes) from the diverse gene pools of wild accessions with potential known source of important agronomic traits (including abiotic and biotic stress tolerance) for genetic improvement of cultivated chickpea through marker-assisted introgression breeding and to develop high-yielding durable stress tolerant (climate resilient) chickpea cultivars.Keeping all above in view, this study was undertaken to construct a high-density inter-specific genetic linkage map by high-throughput genotyping of 839 genomic and genic SSR and SNP markers (physically mapped across eight chickpea chromosomes) showing polymorphism between parental accessions (C. arietinum desi cv. ICC 4958 and C. reticulatum wild cv. ICC 17160) of a 229 F7 RIL mapping population (ICC 4958 × ICC 17160) using gel-based assay, fluorescent dye-labelled automated fragment analyzer and 34-plex matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass array. The large-scale genotyping information of these markers in RILs was correlated/integrated with their replicated multi-location field phenotyping data to identify the novel genomic regions harbouring the major and robust QTLs associated with four agro-morphological traits through genetic/QTL mapping in chickpea. One of the strong seed weight-associated genomic region underlying robust QTL was targeted to delineate functionally relevant candidate genes, favourable natural allelic variants and superior haplotypes regulating seed weight by combining QTL mapping with QTL region-specific high-resolution association analysis, differential gene expression profiling and gene haplotype-based association/LD mapping in chickpea.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materials used for genomic DNA extractionA 229 F7 RIL mapping population (advanced by single seed descent method) derived from the inter-specific crosses between two parental chickpea accessions (ICC 4958 × ICC 17160) was developed for identification and mapping of QTLs. ICC 4958 (developed by Jawaharlal Nehru Krishi Viswa Vidyalaya, Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, India) is a high branch number, pod number and 100-seed weight, and lightly pubescent plant hairiness type annual cultivated desi (C. arietinum) accession. In contrast, ICC 17160 (originated from Turkey) is a low branch number, pod number and 100-seed weight, and densely pubescent plant hairiness type annual wild (C. reticulatum) accession. A seed weight-specific association panel comprising 244 chickpea accessions (including 167 desi and 77 kabuli accessions) constituted previously by Kujur et al.37 was selected (Supplementary Data) for the QTL region-specific trait association analysis. Additionally, 81 accessions belonging to five annual wild chickpea species, namely C. reticulatum,16C. echinospermum,8C. judaicum,22C. bijugum19 and C. pinnatifidum16 (Supplementary Data), were used for gene haplotype-specific association/LD mapping and haplotype sharing-based gene evolution study. The genomic DNA was isolated from the young leaf samples of natural association panel (244 cultivated and 81 wild chickpea accessions) as well as 229 RILs and two parental accessions using QIAGEN DNeasy 96 Plant Kit (QIAGEN, USA) following the manufacturer's instructions.2.2. High-throughput genotyping of SSR and SNP markersA set of 496 genic and genomic SSR markers (Supplementary Data) and 384 transcription factor (TF) gene-derived SNP markers (Supplementary Data) were selected based on their genome-wide physical distribution on eight chickpea chromosomes (Supplementary Data). Four hundred and seventy SSR markers showing polymorphism between parental accessions (ICC 4958 and ICC 17160) were polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified and genotyped in 229 RIL mapping individuals using the 3.5% metaphor agarose gel and fluorescent dye-labelled automated fragment analyzer following Kujur et al.36,37 A set of 369 TF gene-derived SNP markers showing polymorphism between parents were further genotyped in RILs using Sequenom MALDI-TOF MassARRAY system (http://www.sequenom.com). The designing of MassARRAY multiplex iPLEX assay, amplification of synthesized pre-amplification primers with multiplex PCR assay, shrimp alkaline phosphate incubation, primer extension, resin clean up and mass spectrometry were performed following the manufacturer's instructions of Sequenom iPLEX Gold amplification kit (http://www.sequenom.com) and methods of Pandit et al.45 The SNP genotyping information generated in iPLEX spectrochip bio-arrays was analyzed in MassARRAY Typer 3.4 and allele-specific differences in mass between extension products were documented.2.3. Evaluation of agronomic traitsThe 229 RIL mapping individuals and two parental accessions (ICC 4958 and ICC 17160) were grown (planted in a single row with 35 × 10 cm spacing) in the field for two consecutive years (2011 and 2012) as per randomized block design. At least two replications were performed during crop season (minimum 12 ± 2°C and maximum 22 ± 3°C) at two diverse geographical locations of India (New Delhi: latitude 28.6°N and longitude 77.2°E and Palampur: 32.1°N and 76.5°E). The seed weight (SW) (by taking average weight of 100 matured seeds at 10% moisture content), number of pods (NP) (by counting average number of fully formed pods per plant at maturity), number of branches (NB) (average number of branches emerging per plant at time of harvest) and plant hairiness (PH) (determining presence/absence of hairs/trichomes at vegetative and maturity stages) were estimated by selecting 10–12 representative plants from each RILs. The mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation (CV), frequency distribution and ANOVA of phenotyping data in mapping population were evaluated following Kujur et al.36,37 The broad-sense heritability (H2 = s2g/s2p) was measured by comparing the genotypic (s2g) and phenotypic (s2p) variance of each trait using the methods of Holland et al.46 The Pearson's correlation coefficient and its significance (t-test) among all pairwise trait combinations were estimated using SPSS v17.0 (http://www.spss.com/statistics). Moreover, 244 desi and kabuli chickpea accessions belonging to a SW-specific association panel and 81 wild chickpea accessions were grown in the field and phenotyped for SW following aforesaid methods of mapping population.2.4. Construction of an inter-specific genetic linkage map and QTL mappingThe SSR and SNP marker genotyping data showing goodness of fit to the expected Mendelian 1:1 segregation ratio were utilized to construct an inter-specific genetic linkage map using MAPMAKER/EXP3.047 and JoinMap 4.1 (http://www.kyazma.nl/index.php/mc.JoinMap48) at higher LOD (logarithm of odds) threshold (>4.0) with Kosambi mapping function. The markers were integrated into eight linkage groups (LGs) of an inter-specific genetic map based on their centimorgan (cM) genetic distance using the methods of Kujur et al.36,37 The LGs were designated (LG1–LG8) according to their corresponding marker physical positions (bp) on chromosomes as determined in our study.The QTL mapping was performed by integrating the genotyping data of parental polymorphic 470 SSR and 369 SNP markers mapped on eight LGs with replicated multi-location/years field phenotyping data (PH, SW, NP and NB) of 229 RIL mapping individuals. The single marker analysis, interval mapping and composite interval mapping functions of window QTL cartographer WinQTLCart v2.549 and MapQTL 650 with LOD >4.0 at 1,000 permutations were considered significant (5% significance level) to identify and map the novel genomic regions harbouring the QTLs associated with traits under study in chickpea. The percentage of phenotypic variation explained (PVE) by QTLs (R2%) and their additive effect (evaluated by parental origin of favourable alleles) on traits at significant LOD (P = 0.05) was determined. However, permutation test was unable to detect any such QTL when LOD threshold values for all traits under study were below 4.0 at 5% significance level. The QTLs with consistent PVE (>10%) and validated across multiple geographical locations as well as years/seasons were defined as ‘major’ and ‘robust’ QTLs.2.5. Targeted multiplexed amplicon resequencing and association analysisOne selected strong SW-regulating major genomic region harbouring robust QTL was sequenced in parental accessions (ICC 4958 and ICC 17160) and five of each homozygous low and high seed weight RIL mapping individuals using the multiplexed amplicons sequencing protocol of TruSeq Custom Amplicon v1.5 in Illumina MiSeq next-generation sequencer (Illumina, USA). This genomic region underlying QTL was targeted to design and synthesize custom oligo probes using Design Studio software. All the probes were pooled into a custom amplicons tube to produce ~600 amplicons (average 400 bp amplicon size) per reaction, and template library was generated using TruSeq Custom Amplicon Assay kit v1.5. Twelve sample-specific indices were added to each library by PCR using common primers from the TruSeq Amplicon Index kit. The uniquely tagged pooled amplicon libraries were normalized, generated clusters and sequenced by Illumina MiSeq platform (http://www.illumina.com/systems/miseq/system.ilmn). The sequenced amplicons and sequence variants were visualized using Illumina Amplicon Viewer. The high-quality and filtered amplicon sequence reads (>90% bases covered at 0.5× mean coverage) for each accession were mapped to reference kabuli genome.43 The SNPs were detected among accessions as per Agarwal et al.51 and Jain et al.42 The sequenced region was structurally and functionally annotated, and genes annotated in the target genomic region underlying SW QTL were predicted using kabuli genome annotation database.43A set of 34 SSR and 192 SNP (showing polymorphism between ICC 4958 and ICC 17160, and differentiating low and high seed weight RILs) markers (mapped with an average of 1.5 kb uniform sequence intervals) were selected from different coding and non-coding sequence components of genes and intergenic regions annotated at SW QTL interval of interest. These markers were genotyped in 244 desi and kabuli chickpea accessions belonging to a SW-specific association panel37 using the gel-based assay, automated fragment analyzer and MALDI-TOF SNP genotyping assay. The genotyping information of markers at SW QTL interval, replicated multi-location field phenotyping (SW) and population structure (K = 2) data and kinship matrix of 244 accessions (association panel) were analyzed in general linear model (GLM) and mixed linear model (MLM) of TASSEL v2.1 adopting the detailed procedure of Kujur et al.37 Based on combined results of GLM and MLM, the markers showing strong association (R2, magnitude of significant correlation of markers with traits) with SW at significant cut-off value of P = 10-2 were selected for further analysis.2.6. Expression profilingTo infer the differential expression patterns of genes underlying a robust SW-associated major QTL interval, suitable gene-specific primer pairs were designed for expression profiling. The RNA was isolated from five different vegetative and reproductive tissues (shoot, root, leaf, flower bud and pod) and two seed developmental stages [early cell division phase during 10–20 days after podding (DAP) and late maturation phase during 21–30 days after DAP] of low and high seed weight mapping parents (ICC 4958 and ICC 17160) and two contrasting accessions (ICCX-810800, desi small, 100-seed weight 11 g and ICC 20268, kabuli large, 47 g). The isolated RNA was amplified using the gene-based primers along with internal control elongation factor 1-alpha (EF1a) by semi-quantitative and real-time quantitative RT–PCR assays following Kujur et al.36 The expression level of genes estimated in diverse tissues and seed developmental stages of four chickpea accessions were compared with each other and along with control (vegetative leaf tissue of respective accessions) to identify the differentially regulated genes.2.7. Molecular haplotypingFor high-resolution haplotype-based association/LD mapping, the fragments amplified covering the entire coding sequences (CDS) and 1-kb upstream regulatory region (URR) of one strong trait-associated TF gene (validated by QTL mapping, trait association mapping and differential expression profiling) in 244 cultivated desi and kabuli accessions (association panel) and 81 wild chickpea accessions (Supplementary Data) were cloned and sequenced following the study by Kujur et al.36,37 The generated high-quality gene sequences were aligned among accessions using CLUSTALW multiple sequence alignment tool in MEGA v4.052 and mined the SNP loci. The genotyping information of SNPs mined in the TF gene among accessions was used to constitute haplotypes, and the SNP-based haplotype diversity and LD patterns within the gene were estimated. For association analysis, the SNP-based haplotype genotyping information in the TF gene was further correlated with SW trait of 244 cultivated and 81 wild chickpea accessions using the aforesaid methods. To access the potential of diverse haplotypes constituted in the TF gene for regulating seed weight, the differential expression profiling in two seed developmental stages of contrasting accessions representing low and high seed weight haplotype groups was performed using the gene haplotype-specific primers.3. Results and discussion3.1. Construction of a high-density inter-specific chickpea genetic linkage mapA set of 839 including 470 genic and genomic SSR markers (Supplementary Data) and 369 TF gene-derived SNP markers (Supplementary Data) showing polymorphism between parental accessions were genotyped in 229 individuals of a RIL mapping population (ICC 4958 × ICC 17160) to construct an inter-specific genetic linkage map in chickpea. The linkage analysis using the markers showing significant Mendelian segregation ratio (1:1) mapped 834 markers (including 468 SSR and 366 SNP markers) on eight LGs (LG1–LG8) of chickpea (Fig. 1) according to their physical positions (bp) on respective chromosomes (Supplementary Data). The constructed genetic map comprising eight LGs spanned a total map length of 949.42 cM with an average inter-marker distance of 1.138 cM (Supplementary Data). The map length covered by each LG varied from 71.57 cM (62 markers) in LG8 to 157.80 cM (162 markers) in LG4. The most saturated LG was LG4 (average inter-marker distance of 0.974 cM), whereas LG1 was least saturated (1.647 cM) (Supplementary Data). Assuming ~740 Mb genome size of chickpea, the 834 marker-based genetic linkage map had mean marker density of one marker per 887.3 kb. Interestingly, 76 major hot-spot regions were identified on eight LGs of genetic map in which more than two markers were mapped and clustered within 1 cM genetic distance.

Nevertheless, the new map constructed has an adequate marker map density to be utilized as a reference for construction of an integrated chickpea genetic and physical map,58 including identification and mapping of major QTLs regulating important agro-morphological traits in chickpea.3.2. Identification and mapping of QTLs associated with agro-morphological traitsA significant difference of three yield-contributing SW (14–32 g with 87% H2), NP (48–142 g with 78% H2) and NB (15–31 with 72% H2) quantitative traits (Supplementary Data) and one abiotic and biotic stress tolerant PH trait in 229 RIL mapping individuals and two parental accessions across 2 yrs based on ANOVA was observed. Bi-directional transgressive segregation of NB and NP beyond that of parental accessions (Supplementary Data) was observed in RILs. However, the trait segregation of SW in RILs was not beyond that of parental accession ICC 4958. The normal frequency distribution (Supplementary Data) of NB, NP and SW in RILs and parental accessions indicated the involvement of multiple genes for target trait regulation. It further suggests the utility of developed RIL mapping population (ICC 4958 × ICC 17160) for QTL identification. CV varied from 0.132 for NB to 0.201 in NP. The estimation of correlation coefficient among three pairwise combinations of quantitative traits revealed significant (P < 0.001) higher positive correlation between NB and NP (r = 0.86) and negative correlation between NP and SW (-0.27) (Supplementary Data).The QTL analysis identified 19 genomic regions harbouring 27 significant QTLs (LOD: 2.0–16.2) associated with SW, NP, NB and PH in chickpea (Fig. 1 and Table 1). The proportion of phenotypic variance explained (PVE) by individual QTLs varied from 1.3 to 31.3% R2. The average R2 for all 27 QTLs was 38.7%. Fifteen QTLs revealed major effect on traits individually with R2 of >10% each. Sixteen QTLs governing multiple traits were mapped on the eight different genomic regions of LGs. The clustering of QTLs associated with multiple quantitative agro-morphological traits (SW, NP and NB) over a single major genomic region possibly suggests pleiotropy and/or local LD (closely linked genes) effects on trait-regulating complex genetic inheritance pattern.59,60 The remaining 11 QTLs were only associated with single trait and mapped on 11 different genomic regions of LGs (Fig. 1). Maximum number of QTLs (5 QTLs) were mapped on LG1, followed by LG6 (3 QTLs) and minimum (1 QTL) on LG5. The genomic regions (0.3 cM on LG1 to 7.2 cM on LG4) harbouring the 27 SW, NP, NB and PH QTLs covered by 84 SSR and SNP markers were mapped on eight LGs. Remarkably, 11 major genomic regions harbouring 15 robust QTLs were validated across two geographical locations as well as years/seasons (Fig. 1). These robust QTLs distributed over six LGs (0.3–7.2 cM) showed consistent PVE (10.7–31.3% R2) at higher LOD (5.2–16.2). Three major genomic regions harbouring three robust QTLs (7.9–16.2 LOD) mapped on LG1, LG4 and LG6 (0.3–7.2 cM) of these were strongly associated (=20% R2) with SW and PH (Fig. 1 and Table 1). The 12 genomic regions with 12 QTLs (1.3–9.5% R2) were either validated in one geographical location/season and/or had <10% R2. Significant QTLs governing four agro-morphological traits identified using a RIL mapping populationaqSW1.1 (QTL for 100-seed weight on chromosome 1 and QTL number 1), qNB1.1 (QTL for number of branches/plant on chromosome 1 and QTL number 1), qNP1.1 (QTL for number of pods/plant on chromosome 1 and QTL number 1) and qPH6.1 (QTL for plant hairiness on chromosome 6 and QTL number 1). CaSSR (Cicer arietinum SSR) and CaTFSNP (Cicer arietinum transcription factor gene-derived SNP), and details regarding these markers are provided in the Supplementary Data.bKnown QTLs from previous studies by Cobos et al.,53,54 Hossain et al.,55 Varshney et al.,56 and Gowda et al.,57Significant QTLs governing four agro-morphological traits identified using a RIL mapping populationaqSW1.1 (QTL for 100-seed weight on chromosome 1 and QTL number 1), qNB1.1 (QTL for number of branches/plant on chromosome 1 and QTL number 1), qNP1.1 (QTL for number of pods/plant on chromosome 1 and QTL number 1) and qPH6.1 (QTL for plant hairiness on chromosome 6 and QTL number 1). CaSSR (Cicer arietinum SSR) and CaTFSNP (Cicer arietinum transcription factor gene-derived SNP), and details regarding these markers are provided in the Supplementary Data.bKnown QTLs from previous studies by Cobos et al.,53,54 Hossain et al.,55 Varshney et al.,56 and Gowda et al.,57Considering the individual trait, nine including three major and robust QTLs associated with SW (1.3–31.3% R2) were identified (Fig. 1 and Table 1). These nine QTLs covered by 38 SSR and SNP markers were mapped on six LGs (1.7 cm on LG6 to 5.7 cM on LG4). All these SW QTLs showed mostly the positive additive gene effects indicating the effective contributions of ICC 4958 alleles at these loci for increasing seed weight (Table 1). For NP, eight including six major and robust QTLs explaining 1.5–19.9% R2 were identified. These eight QTLs covered by 34 markers were mapped on six LGs (0.3 cM on LG1 to 7.2 cM on LG4) (Fig. 1 and Table 1). These QTLs showed positive additive gene effects for increasing pod number with large allelic contributions either from ICC 4958 or from both ICC 4958 and ICC 17160. For NB, eight including four major and robust QTLs covered by 25 markers were mapped on five LGs (1.7 cM on LG1 and LG2 to 3.6 cM on LG6) with 2.0–19.9% R2 (Fig. 1 and Table 1). Except all, one NB QTL had negative additive gene effect indicating contributions of ICC 17160 alleles at this loci on decreasing branch number. For PH, two robust and major QTLs mapped on LG6 and LG7 showing 20.5–29.8% R2 were identified (Fig. 1 and Table 1). These QTL regions (4.5 cM on LG7 to 4.8 cM on LG6) covered by 11 SSR and SNP markers showed positive additive gene effects for increasing hairiness with allelic contributions from ICC 17160. All the three yield-contributing traits (SW, NP and NB) under study showed complex quantitative genetic inheritance patterns in an inter-specific chickpea mapping population. Consequently, it was quite obvious to identify and map multiple robust and major QTLs/genes regulating these traits in chickpea. Although the agro-morphological trait PH appears as a qualitative trait in our study, its phenotype (presence/absence of hairs) is easily affected by environmental cues. This signifies PH as a quantitative trait rather than a qualitative trait. Despite identifying multiple PH-governing loci, this study could detect only two robust QTLs associated with PH. A high-resolution mapping of QTLs controlling PH trait is required for quantitative dissection of this complex trait in chickpea.To validate the identified QTLs, the genomic regions harbouring SW, NP, NB and PH QTLs were compared with earlier QTL mapping studies (~50 QTLs controlling diverse agronomic traits) involving different inter-/intra-specific chickpea mapping population.22,53–57,61–63 For comparison, the markers linked/flanking these known SW, NP and NB QTLs were genotyped in 229 RIL individuals and parents of an inter-specific mapping population (ICC 4958 × ICC 17160). Four SSR markers (TA110, GAA47, TA72, TS45 and STMS13) showing polymorphism between parents (ICC 4958 and ICC 17160) were genetically mapped into the marker intervals of QTLs (qSW2.1, qSW4.1, qNP8.1 and qNB1.2) on LG2 (TA110), LG4 (GAA47 and TA72), LG8 (TS45) and LG1 (STMS13) as identified in our study. Therefore, two SW and one of each NP and NB QTLs associated with five anchor markers documented by Cobos et al.,53,54 Hossain et al.,55 Varshney et al.56 and Gowda et al.57 are the same as those identified by our study using a different inter-specific mapping population. Apart from these four known QTLs, none of the identified QTLs showed correspondence with earlier reported QTLs based on their genetic positions on eight chickpea LGs. This indicates that 23 QTLs governing four agro-morphological traits identified by us are novel and showed population-specific genomic distribution in chickpea. Henceforth, these trait-regulating QTLs, once successfully validated in diverse genetic backgrounds, can be utilized for marker-assisted trait improvement of chickpea. The novel as well as robust and major QTLs governing four agro-morphological traits mapped on eight chromosomes were covered by different candidate gene (TFs)-derived SSR and SNP markers (Supplementary Data). These markers carrying genes including TFs have useful implication for regulating variety of transcriptional activity during developmental process in plants, including Arabidopsis and legumes.64–70 For instance, the SSR marker (CaSSR381) containing GRAS family TF gene HAM3 (Hairy meristem 3) found in one strong PH-influencing robust QTL (qPH6.1) interval of chickpea supports the previous reports on its unique feature and involvement in differentiation of epidermis with trichomes (enhanced hairs) on the vegetative shoot apical meristem (SAM) of Arabidopsis.71,72 The development of multicellular glandular plant hairs (trichomes), which usually secrete oxalic acids and malic acids, is known to impart abiotic and biotic stress tolerance in Cicer accessions.73,74 Henceforth, the HAM3 TF gene identified in a strong PH-associated QTL region (24.9–29.8% R2 at 7.9–8.5 LOD) is a potential candidate, which can be transferred to cultivated chickpea for their marker-assisted genetic improvement for abiotic and biotic stress tolerance. One of the strong SW-influencing robust and major QTL region (qSW1.2) mapped (20.9–21.6% R2 at 10.5–11.2 LOD) on LG1 (37.5–40.2 cM) was covered by SSR markers derived from three TF genes, namely DUF1635 (domain of unknown function), NAC (no apical meristem-Arabidopsis transcription activation factor-cup shaped cotyledon) and SBP (squamosa promoter-binding protein). These marker-associated TF genes underlying the SW QTLs have recently got validated by integrating trait association analysis with QTL mapping (desi ICCX-810800 × kabuli ICC 20268), transcript profiling and LD-based marker haplotyping, and ascertained as potential candidates for regulating 100-seed weight in chickpea.36,37 The validation of these TF gene-derived SSR markers at SW-influencing QTL region in two of our independent studies using two different intra-specific (ICCX-810800 × ICC 20268) and inter-specific (ICC 4958 × ICC 17160) mapping populations suggests the robustness and significance of identified TF genes underlying QTLs for controlling seed weight in chickpea. Henceforth, the genes localized at the trait-regulating QTL intervals, once validated through fine mapping and map-based gene isolation, could act as the potential candidates for marker-assisted genetic enhancement of chickpea.3.3. Target QTL region-specific trait association mappingTo enhance the resolution and fine mapping, one strong (QTL with highest R2 30.6–31.3% at 15.7–16.2 LOD) SW-associated major and robust QTL (qSW4.2) interval [CaSSR248 (150.6 cM)-CaTFSNP203 (156.3 cM)] was selected based on recombination between two markers and genetic constitution of low and high SW RIL mapping individuals. The major genomic region (48,145.7–48,384.8 kb spanning 239.1 kb on chromosome 4) harbouring such robust QTL was defined (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Data) by integrating its genetic linkage map information (recombination of markers in each RILs) with that of physical map of kabuli genome (as constructed in our study). This target 239.1 kb qSW4.2 QTL region was sequenced in low and high seed weight parental accessions (ICC 4958 and ICC 17160) and five of each homozygous individuals of a RIL mapping population using the TruSeq Custom Amplicon v1.5 of Illumina MiSeq next-generation sequencer. The comprehensive sequence analysis at target QTL interval among these 10 RIL mapping individuals and two parental accessions detected 34 SSR and 299 SNP markers (Supplementary Data).

The integration of GLM and MLM analysis and by minimizing the confounding effect of population structure identified four SSR and five SNP markers localized at qSW4.2 QTL region showing significant association with SW at P value =10-3. The significant percentage contribution of these marker loci to SW trait variation (R2) varied from 24 to 38.6%. The high-resolution haplotyping among nine SSR and SNP markers with SW enabled to identify three best haplotypes among three SNPs (CaSNP121, CaTFSNP175 and CaSNP194) showing strong association (36.7–47.3% R2 at 1–3 × 10-5 P) with SW in contrast to any other marker combinations. This haplotype region spanned a maximum of 62.7 kb (48268.3–48331.0 kb) physical distance between CaSNP121 and CaSNP194 markers at qSW4.2 QTL interval.The structural and functional annotation of this ~62.7 kb sequenced QTL region with kabuli genome annotation database identified five protein-coding candidate genes (Supplementary Data; Fig. 2), which are known to be involved in controlling seed development including seed size/weight in crop plants.37,69,75–78 The detailed annotation of strong SW-associated haplotypes constituting three SNPs showed their localization in the CDS and URR of three candidate genes, namely bZIP (basic leucine zipper domain), ABI3VP1 (abscisic acid insensitive 3-viviparous 1) and cytochrome P450 localized at qSW4.2 QTL interval. One regulatory SNP (G/A) in the URR and another non-synonymous SNP (T/C) in the B3 functional domain of ABI3VP1 TF gene of these revealed strong association (42.5–43.1% R2 at 1.8–2.0 × 10-4 P) with SW. The identification of trait-associated SSR and SNP markers, including non-synonymous SNP loci in different coding/functional domain and URR of three genes suggested their functional significance in establishing marker-trait linkages and identification of genes/QTLs regulating SW trait in chickpea. The expansion/contraction of SSR repeats and non-synonymous substitutions of SNP loci in the functional domain of genes encoding variable amino acid residues might create altered secondary structure of proteins and functional domain regions that possibly affects the DNA binding and transcriptional activity of target gene during seed development. Such possible transcriptional mechanism of trait regulation due to non-synonymous SNP substitutions and SSR repeat-unit variations has already been demonstrated in one of the high seed weight-associated SBP TF gene in chickpea36 and grain size (GS379) and stress-responsive80 genes in rice. The expansion and contraction of SSR repeats and SNPs alteration in the URRs of genes also have implications in regulating expression and transcription of genes associated with many agronomic traits.44,81–833.4. Validation of SW-associated genes through expression profilingTo infer the differential expression pattern of five protein-coding genes annotated in the 62.7 kb strong SW-governing robust QTL interval (qSW4.2), the gene-based primers were amplified using the RNA isolated from five different vegetative and reproductive tissues and two seed developmental stages of four low and high seed weight chickpea accessions (ICC 4958, ICC 17160, ICCX-810800 and ICC 20268) through semi-quantitative and quantitative RT–PCR assays. Three strong SW-associated genes (bZIP, ABI3VP1 and cytochrome P450) with SNPs (constituting haplotypes) identified based on association analysis of these showed seed-specific expression (Supplementary Data) compared with vegetative tissues of four accessions analysed. Among these three seed-specific expressed genes, the regulatory and non-synonymous SNPs carrying ABI3VP1 TF gene constituting strong SW-associated haplotypes at qSW4.2 QTL interval revealed up-regulated expression (>5-fold) in two seed developmental stages (compared with vegetative tissues) of four low and high seed weight chickpea accessions (Supplementary Data). We, therefore, selected this ABI3VP1 TF gene localized at the major and robust SW-governing QTL interval (qSW4.2) as target candidate for understanding its significance in seed weight regulation through high-resolution gene haplotype-specific association/LD mapping in chickpea. The narrowing down of acid phosphatase gene-regulating low-phosphorous stress tolerance at major QTL interval by integrating QTL mapping with QTL region-specific association analysis and differential expression profiling has been demonstrated in soybean.443.5. High-resolution haplotype-based LD mapping in a strong SW-associated TF geneThe sequencing of 4,086 bp cloned amplicon covering the whole CDS and 1 kb URR of a strong SW-regulating ABI3VP1 TF gene (validated by QTL mapping, QTL region-specific association analysis and differential expression profiling) among 244 cultivated (SW-specific association panel) and 81 wild chickpea accessions identified 16 SNP loci (Fig. 3A, Supplementary Data). It includes one non-synonymous SNP loci (T/C) [encoding valine (GTC) to alanine (GCC)] in the B3 functional domain and five regulatory SNPs in the URR of this TF gene. The haplotype analysis in ABI3VP1 TF gene combining the genotyping data of 16 SNPs constituted a maximum of seven haplotypes (with PIC varied from 0.68 to 0.97, mean: 0.63) among accessions (Fig. 3B). All these identified seven haplotypes in TF gene were present in five wild species, whereas three haplotypes were shared particularly by 167 desi and 77 kabuli chickpea accessions. It thus suggests that ancient human selection has played a major role in evolution of this SW-influencing TF gene during chickpea domestication.

This figure appears in colour in the online version of DNA Research.The association analysis using the genotyping data of seven SNP-based haplotypes in the ABI3VP1 TF gene with SW (1.2–57.6 g)-specific field phenotyping data of 325 chickpea accessions revealed its strong association with SW (46% R2 at 1.7 × 10-6 P). The haplotype-pair-based LD estimation produced a significant high degree of LD (r2 > 0.60 and P < 0.0001) across entire 4,086 bp sequenced TF gene (Fig. 3C), which increased its overall potential for trait association. Such gene haplotype-specific association in presence of high-resolution significant LD have utility to overcome the bi-allelic limitation of SNPs and for improving the efficiency of QTL mapping in crop plants.44,84–86 The 37 low seed weight (1.2–3.7 g) accessions represented by single haplotype group 7 (AGAG) in ABI3VP1 TF gene differentiated distinctly from two other haplotypes (GAGC) consisting 24 accessions of high seed weight (13–57.6 g) (Fig. 3B) with higher phenotypic variance (47–49% R2 at <1.2 × 10-5 P). Therefore, strong association potential of this gene for SW in chickpea is expected. The differential expression profiling using these high (GAGC) and low (AGAG) seed weight-specific haplotypes constituted by four SNPs (-981, -569, -387 and -251 bp) in the URR of an ABI3VP1 TF gene revealed significant up-regulated expression (average 4-fold), specifically in two seed developmental stages of chickpea accessions compared with leaf (Fig. 3D). It inferred that favourable natural allelic variants and superior haplotype (GAGC) constituted in the URR of an ABI3VP1 TF gene involved in increased transcript expression and thus have significance in regulation of seed development and consequently seed weight in chickpea. A significant correlation between accessions containing high and low seed weight-specific haplotypes with their diverse transcript expression during seed development and varied seed weight characteristics was evident (Fig. 3D). The high seed weight-specific superior haplotype (GAGC) represented by haplotypes 1 and 2 were present in 228 (70.1%) cultivated desi and kabuli and wild (C. reticulatum, C. echinospermum and C. bijugum) chickpea accessions, whereas low seed weight-specific haplotype 7 (AGAG) was found exclusively in 37 wild (C. bijugum, C. judaicum and C. pinnatifidum) accessions (Fig. 3). It gave clues for strong selection on seed weight trait among chickpea accessions belonging to primary and secondary gene pools during chickpea breeding. Collectively, our QTL and association mapping gave clues that significant SNP alleles (G/A) and haplotypes (GAGC/AGAG) variations within ABI3VP1 TF gene underlies the QTL (qSW4.2) for seed weight in chickpea. This essentially indicates that these SW-governing alleles of qSW4.2 is widely distributed among the cultivated and wild chickpea accessions. Nevertheless, having compared our present and past QTL and association mapping reports on given agronomic traits,22,36,37,53–57,61–63 only one chickpea accession ICC 4958 was found to be the common parent being specifically utilized for QTL mapping studies. Therefore, most of the SW QTLs (seven QTLs except qSW2.1 and qSW4.1) including qSW4.2 identified by us are novel and population specific, and hence, they can be utilized for marker-assisted genetic improvement of chickpea for seed weight. Notably, ABI3VP1 TF gene underlying qSW4.2 QTL was localized with another QTL qNP4.2 at the same marker interval [CaTFSNP248 (150.6 cM)-CaSSR250 (157.8 cM)] on LG4. Both these QTLs were found to have positive effects on SW and NP traits with major allelic contribution from the cultivated chickpea. The underlying reason could be the tight linkage of two agronomically important genes and/or pleotropic (multi-functional) effect of ABI3VP1 TF gene on seed weight and pod number regulation at this target QTL interval.The SNP marker-based haplotyping and haplotype sharing among accessions overall inferred understanding on possible evolutionary pathway of the ABI3VP1 TF gene in cultivated and wild chickpea and consequence of its natural allelic/haplotype variation (specifically the superior haplotypes identified in URR of this gene) on seed weight-specific trait evolution during chickpea domestication. Henceforth, the seed weight is supposed to represent an important component of domestication trait in chickpea as documented earlier by Kujur et al.36 A strong trait association potential (validated by QTL mapping and QTL region-specific association analysis) of ABI3VP1 TF gene with SW was evident from higher contribution of significant superior haplotypes identified in the URR of this gene with phenotypic variation (~48%) and their seed-specific expression and pronounced increased transcript expression during seed development. It reemphasizes the functional significance of high seed weight-specific superior haplotype (GAGC) identified in the URR of ABI3VP1 TF gene for understanding the target trait association and regulation in chickpea. The identified optimal superior haplotype of ABI3VP1 TF gene will be helpful for accurate selection of chickpea accessions with higher seed weight and also enrich our understanding on gene regulatory networks underlying such complex quantitative seed weight trait in chickpea. The potential role of B3 functional domain containing ABI3VP1 TF gene as key transcriptional regulator of seed development has been well understood in rice and Arabidopsis.69,87–89 Therefore, a strong SW-regulating ABI3VP1 TF gene identified at SW-regulating robust QTL interval by integrating QTL mapping with QTL region-specific association analysis, differential expression profiling and gene haplotype-based association/LD mapping could be a potential candidate for marker-assisted genetic enhancement of chickpea for increasing its seed weight as well as yield.4. ConclusionsA high-density inter-specific genetic linkage map constructed by high-throughput genotyping of genome-wide 834 genic and genomic SSR and SNP markers in our study would expedite genome mapping and targeted mapping of genes/QTLs associated with traits of agricultural importance in chickpea, including comparative mapping across legumes. Eleven novel major genomic regions harbouring 15 robust QTLs (10.7–31.3% R2 at 5.2–16.2 LOD) associated with three quantitative and one qualitative agro-morphological traits were identified and mapped on eight LGs. Using an integrated genomic approach by combining traditional QTL mapping with QTL region-specific high-resolution association analysis, differential expression profiling and gene haplotype-specific association/LD mapping, we enabled to delineate strong SW-associated favourable natural allelic variants and superior haplotype of ABI3VP1 TF gene localized at robust SW QTL region. The QTL map-based cloning is a powerful and well-established traditional method of trait-influencing gene/QTL isolation by narrowing down the QTL intervals. However, this approach usually involves excessive time for generation of larger advanced generation mapping population and efficient marker genotyping data for fine mapping the target long QTL regions. In this perspective, an integrated approach developed in our study thus have significance to expedite the process of fine mapping and map-based isolation/positional cloning of genes/QTLs controlling important agronomic traits in chickpea with sub-optimal use of resources. Four agro-morphological trait (SW, NP, NB and PH)-influencing QTL regions are being spanned with various gene (TF)-derived SSR and SNP markers, once validated in diverse genetic backgrounds of chickpea accessions can further be delimited to specific genes/QTLs through integrated genomic approach (developed in our study) or traditional fine mapping/positional cloning. These trait-influencing functionally relevant molecular tags delineated eventually will be used as potential candidates for marker-assisted genetic enhancement of chickpea.FundingThis study was funded by the Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Government of India, through their research grant (102/IFD/SAN/2161/2013-14).

IntroductionBacteria have an enormous potential to adapt and evolve,1 which is exemplified by the emergence of pathogens which are resistant to antibiotics. In this light, and with the diminishing pipeline of novel drugs, a ‘return to the pre-antibiotic era’ is almost certain unless we explore new means to counter resistance.2 An important step in this process is achieving a greater understanding of how antibiotics kill cells and how resistant cells counter their action.Mechanisms of antibiotic resistance include horizontal acquisition of genes for enzymes that modify the antibiotic or its target, or transporters that export them out of the cell.3 For example, ß-lactamases are enzymes that hydrolyze antibiotics such as penicillin. In various enteric pathogens, the transport system of AcrAB-TolC can export multiple drugs. Many antibiotics are prevalent in the natural environment, outside their role as drugs. This implies that there is a large pool of antibiotic resistance determinants in the environment.4–7 Additionally, mutations in the genome, which alter the target of the antibiotic or otherwise affect processes involved in antibiotic action, can also confer resistance. For example, treatment of Escherichia coli with the antibiotic rifampicin readily selects for mutations in its target RNA polymerase, leading to resistance.8 Point mutations on the genome are in fact the primary means of antibiotic resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.9,10 However, since antibiotics target well-conserved and essential cellular processes, many resistance-conferring mutations in antibiotic targets might have adverse effects on fitness in the absence of the antibiotic.11Aminoglycosides are a class of ribosome-targeting bactericidal antibiotics that bind the 16S rRNA of the 30S ribosomal subunit and induce mistranslation as well as translational blockade.12 Aminoglycosides have a streptamine or a 2-deoxystreptamine (2-DOS) ring. The commonly used antibiotic streptomycin belongs to the former class. The latter group of aminoglycosides includes antibiotics such as kanamycin, gentamicin, neomycin and paromomycin.13 2-DOS aminoglycosides typically bind to the ribosomal decoding site in the 16S rRNA and cause a conformational change, which leads to the recognition of near-cognate codons and therefore miscoding.14,15 This interaction, along with the binding of the antibiotic to the 23S rRNA in the large subunit,16,17 also causes translocation blockade15,18 and inhibition of ribosome recycling.16,19 Of these mechanisms, translational miscoding might play only a minor role in cell killing, going by the evidence that strains with ribosomal mutations known to reduce translation fidelity are viable.20–22 This probably lays greater emphasis on the translation blockade that these antibiotics cause23 through their effects on ribosome translocation and recycling. Though various other non-intuitive mechanisms for cell death such as oxidative stress have been proposed, these remain controversial.24–26A common method by which bacteria acquire resistance to aminoglycosides is via enzymes that modify the antibiotic, such as aminoglycoside acetyltransferases and phosphotransferases.27 These genes are generally used as selectable markers in routine laboratory work. In addition, mutations targeting the aminoglycoside binding site in the 16S rRNA can confer resistance.28,29 Spontaneous emergence of such mutants in certain bacteria confers two orders of magnitude-fold resistance to the antibiotic.30 However, such mutations are not accessible to E. coli due to the presence of multiple copies of the 16S rRNA gene,12 a property common to many fast-growing bacteria. Even in the event that a single copy of the gene gets mutated, sensitivity to aminoglycosides is dominant in a heterogeneous ribosomal population.31 Previous studies on mutations conferring resistance to the aminoglycoside kanamycin in E. coli have led to the isolation of two elongation factor-G (EF-G) mutations. However, besides showing a temperature-sensitive phenotype, these bear a heavy cost to the cell (by affecting translation) in the absence of the antibiotic,32 a property common to resistance mutations for many classes of antibiotics.11 A more recent large-scale screen for aminoglycoside resistance suggested that reduction of proton motive force (PMF) on the membrane confers resistance, while making the cell more sensitive to other antibiotics that require PMF for efflux.33Sublethal concentrations of antibiotics might play important physiological roles in bacteria, by acting as signalling molecules affecting gene expression.7 Besides, these can also promote development of resistance, either by induction of specific mutator pathways34 or—in the natural environment—by promotion of horizontal gene transfer.35 More fundamentally, under low antibiotic concentrations, growth of a subpopulation of cells that do not see the antibiotic, or the uniformly slower growth of the entire cell population, provides a substrate for selection to act. For example, antibiotics at concentrations as low as 1/100th the killing concentration leads to the selection of resistant bacteria.36 Sublethal concentrations of antibiotics are important in a clinical context, because factors such as incorrect antibiotic dosage or non-compliance of the patient with a prescribed dose regime could lead to low levels of the antibiotic in the body. Therefore, it is important to understand the effect of antibiotic dosage in the development of resistance, and the effects of the ensuing resistance mechanisms on fitness in the absence of the antibiotic.The development of next-generation deep-sequencing technologies has made it relatively easy to track the emergence of variants in a population, including in the context of antibiotic resistance.37–39 In this study, we use laboratory evolution of E. coli in batch cultures, followed by deep sequencing, to interrogate the emergence of resistance to an aminoglycoside antibiotic at two different sublethal concentrations. We show that resistance mechanisms with little consequence to cell fitness in the absence of the antibiotic emerge rapidly, and that the early dynamics of development of resistance might be dependent on the concentration of the antibiotic.2. Materials and methods2.1. Strains, culture media, growth curves and optical densityNon-pathogenic E. coli MG1655 was used for the evolution experiments. Growth curves were generated in flasks or 96-well plates in Luria Bertani (LB; Hi-Media, India) broth using 1:100 dilution of overnight culture and incubation at 37°C with shaking at 200 rpm. Optical density (OD) measurements were carried out at 600 nm (OD600) using either a UV-visible spectrophotometer (SP-8001, Metertech) when growth curves were generated in flasks or using a plate reader (Infinite F200pro, Tecan) when generated in 96-well plates.2.2. Minimum inhibitory concentration determinationThe minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined by a modification of the broth dilution technique. Antibiotics were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Kanamycin sulfate K1377, Streptomycin sulfate salt S6501, Gentamicin sulfate salt G1264, Neomycin trisulfate salt hydrate N1876, Paromomycin sulfate salt P5057, Hygromycin B H7772, Apramycin sulfate salt A2024). Dilutions of the antibiotic stock were made in sterile distilled water to which equal volume of 2× concentrated LB broth was added. Amount of stock taken was calculated with respect to final diluted volume. Overnight grown culture was added to the broth to achieve 1:100 dilution. After 24-h incubation at 37°C with shaking at 200 rpm, the MIC was inferred as the lowest concentration at which OD600 falls below 0.05 with respect to the blank. Eight independently grown replicates were so tested for their MIC.2.3. Evolution in kanamycinFor evolution experiments in sublethal kanamycin concentrations (Supplementary Data), the sublethal window was defined on the basis of an MIC of kanamycin for wild type (Supplementary Data). We selected two concentrations for the evolution experiment: 4 µg/ml (4-kan, ~25% MIC) and 8 µg/ml (8-kan, ~50% MIC); growth parameters like length of lag period, growth rates and stationary-phase OD600 were significantly different at these two concentrations (Supplementary Data). Evolution experiments were carried out in a 100-ml LB broth in 250 ml conical flasks with incubation at 37°C and shaking at 200 r.p.m. Two replicate populations in the case of 0-kan and 4-kan, and four replicate populations in the case of 8-kan, were passaged by batch culture into fresh 100-ml LB broth (while maintaining kanamycin concentration) using 1:100 dilution every 24 h, under identical shaking and incubation conditions. For the 4-kan populations, the MICs of the two replicate populations were followed with each passage, and populations were collected by spinning down the culture for genomic DNA (gDNA) extraction and deep sequencing. Glycerol stocks were also maintained for each passage. For the 8-kan populations, the MICs of colonies derived from these populations on plain LB agar were followed with each passage. A few colonies were selected and grown in LB broth for collecting cells for gDNA extraction and deep sequencing; glycerol stocks for these were also prepared.2.4. Population structure analysis of evolving bacterial culturesAs described in the previous section, we grew E. coli batch cultures in 0-kan (plain LB), 4-kan and 8-kan up to one passage. Cultures at the 0 h (passage 0), 24 h (passage 0) and 24 h (passage 1) were subjected to serial 10-fold dilution and plated on plain LB agar plates. The resulting colonies were randomly picked and tested for resistance by growth in two different concentrations of kanamycin: 4-kan (moderately-lethal) and 20-kan (lethal), and tested for defects in growth in plain LB (0-kan). Only 24 h OD600 was measured. This experiment was performed on around 88 isolates obtained from each of the three evolving populations (0-kan, 4-kan and 20-kan) at the three indicated time points. We did not maintain replicate populations; instead, we repeated the experiment multiple times. Results of two different repeats of the experiment that had considerable variation are shown in Supplementary Data.2.5. Genomic DNA extractionExtraction of gDNA from either experimental populations or individual isolates from such populations was done using the Sigma-Aldrich GenElute Bacterial Genomic DNA Kit (NA2120) using the manufacturer's protocol. gDNA integrity was checked on agarose gel, and quality and concentration were checked using NanoDrop UV-Vis Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific).2.6. Sequencing and determination of mutationsLibrary preparation was carried out using the Truseq DNA library sample prep kit V2, and sequencing was carried out using TruSeq SBS Kit v3-HS (50 Cycles) at Centre for Cellular and Molecular Platforms (C-CAMP) on Illumina HiSeq 1000 platform according to manufacturer's instructions. Samples were sequenced to ~300× coverage. FASTX quality assessed reads were mapped to the reference genome (NC_000913.2) using BWA.40 SAMTOOLS41 was used to process the BWA output aligned sam files to generate a pileup file, and VARSCAN42 was used to extract the list of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and indels from the pileup. Percentage of reads supporting a SNP was obtained by dividing the number of reads containing the SNP by the total number of reads mapping to that locus, multiplied by 100. In the case of 4-kan populations, mutations were called when percentage of reads supporting the mutant allele was above 20% in at least one of the sequenced time points during the course of the evolution experiment. This cut-off was set to 50% for isolate sequencing in the case of 8-kan populations; we note here that though a low cut-off was set, mutations identified in the 8-kan clones were generally supported by ~97% of reads. Once the list of mutations was generated using these cut-offs, their abundances across all time points were recalculated from the pileup files using a perl script. Only good-quality bases (quality > phred score 30) were considered for this analysis, and bases at the start and end of reads that mapped to the mutation position were excluded. Additionally, BRESEQ43 was used to verify the mutations. Longer deletions in the genes encoding subunits of the ATP synthase complex were inferred by BRESEQ. Sanger sequencing was done to confirm mutations.2.7. Phage transductionTo move the FusAP610T mutation into the wild type background for characterization, phage transduction using the P1 phage was used. The kanamycin resistance cassette, amplified from pKD13, was inserted in a featureless region near the fusA gene (without deleting a single nucleotide) using the one-step inactivation procedure of Datsenko and Wanner.44 (A higher concentration of kanamycin, i.e. 80 µg/ml, was used to limit growth of the resistant parent strain.) This strain was used as donor to prepare P1 phage lysate that was subsequently used to transduce wild type as per the Court lab protocol.45 Selection for transductants was done on LB agar plates containing kanamycin. FLP recombinase provided by pCP20 was used to remove the kanamycin resistance cassette which is flanked by FRT sites (leaving behind a FRT site in the process).2.8. Growth simulationDiscrete growth simulations were used to assess the effect of different growth rate regimes on the persistence of sick variants. Each simulation was seeded with N objects—each object representing a bacterial cell—of three types as follows. Most of these objects were wild type. A small number of objects represented mutants of two types, one with a higher growth rate than the other (3-fold difference in growth rates), with both mutants displaying a higher rate of growth than the wild type (with the wild type growing three times slower than the slow-growing mutant). This set-up reflects the situation wherein two resistant mutants—one with a growth defect and the other not—are competing with each other and the wild type for growth in the presence of sublethal concentrations of an antibiotic. The simulation was seeded with five times as many sick mutants as fit ones. Each growth iteration would allow an object to replicate or not—the probability that an object replicates would depend on the growth rate. The simulations were stopped when the total number of objects crossed a pre-defined threshold. This reflects only exponential growth. Introduction of a subsampling step after a certain number of iterations, to simulate serial passages, does not alter these results.2.9. Competition assaysTo distinguish between two competing MG1655 strains, a knock-out of lacZ gene was generated in wild type MG1655 background using the one-step inactivation procedure of Datsenko and Wanner.44 The colonies of a <U+0394>lacZ strain can be distinguished from those of lacZ+ colonies on McConkey's agar (HiMedia, India). The lacZ deletion was made in both wild type and wild-type-FRT backgrounds. For competition, wild type/wild-type-FRT (<U+0394>lacZ) cultures were co-inoculated in LB along with FusAP610T-FRT (lacZ+) in 1:1 proportion, and the counts of both colony types were followed on LB agar. As control, mock competitions were carried out with the two (otherwise competing) cultures grown separately. They were mixed together in 1:1 proportion immediately prior to performing viable count on the differentiating medium.2.10. GFP inductionHou et al.32 assayed translation defects in their kanamycin-resistant fusA mutants by looking at the kinetics of induction of ß-galactosidase in these strains versus the wild type. Similarly, we looked at the kinetics of induction of green fluorescent protein (GFP) to check for translation defects in FusAP610T. GFPmut2 46 was cloned from pMS201 into pBAD1847 within EcoRI and HindIII restriction sites to get pBAD18::gfpmut2. Overnight cultures of both WT-FRT and FusAP610T-FRT were grown in LB broth in a 96-well black plate (Sigma-Aldrich, costar 3603) until OD600 reached ~0.5. Subsequently to induce GFPmut2, 1 or 10 mM arabinose (HiMedia, India) was added to the wells that were to be tested for induction. Also, kanamycin was added to the wells that were to be tested for induction in the presence of the antibiotic, to a final concentration of 10 µg/ml. GFPmut2 fluorescence was measured at 520 nm by excitation at 485 nm using a plate reader (Infinite F200pro Tecan). Promoter activities48 were calculated as follows: OD and GFP fluorescence intensity measurements were blank subtracted separately. GFP intensity was then normalized to OD. Promoter activity was calculated as dF/dt, where dF is change in OD-normalized GFP fluorescence in time interval dt. Finally, promoter activities thus calculated were normalized to fall in the range of 0–1.3. Results3.1. Growth of E. coli in sublethal concentrations
of kanamycinTo explore the landscape of mutations leading to resistance of E. coli to aminoglycosides, we grew the bacteria—in a batch culture—in two sublethal concentrations of kanamycin (4 µg/ml, ~20–25% of the MIC; 8 µg/ml, ~40–50% of the MIC; see ‘Materials and Methods’; Supplementary Data and Supplementary Data), a 2-DOS aminoglycoside antibiotic commonly used in the laboratory. Here we refer to the first batch culture of bacteria in antibiotic-containing medium as P0. A sample of bacteria obtained after ~24 h of growth in P0 was serially passaged under identical conditions, and these serial passages will be referred to as P1, P2, etc.The P0 growth curve of E. coli grown in 4 µg/ml kanamycin (4-kan) is characterized by a long lag phase (6–7 h) followed by an exponential phase defined by low growth rate (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Data for statistics). The lag phase period increased considerably to at least 11 h in 8 µg/ml kanamycin (8-kan) (Fig. 1C and Supplementary Data); the cultures typically reached a final OD after 24 h that was less than what was observed for the 4-kan cultures (compare Fig. 1A and C, and Supplementary Data).

(B) MICs of evolving populations. P0 indicates the first round of growth in kanamycin (i.e. the growth curves in A) while P1–P10 indicate serial transfers by 100-fold dilution. Black bars indicate MIC levels of control populations passaged in plain LB (0-kan). Red bars indicate populations evolving in 4-kan, with data available for multiple time points in P0. Green bars indicate populations grown in 4-kan in P0 but subsequently transferred into plain LB for the remaining passages P1–P10 (4-kan <U+2192> 0-kan). The maintenance of increased MIC levels suggests the presence of resistant mutations and not a temporary stress response. The average MIC level of the two biological replicates (from three technical replicates) is plotted with the total length of the positive and negative error bars representing the difference in MICs between the two replicates (range). (C) Growth of four replicate populations of E. coli MG1655 in ~50% lethal levels of kanamycin (8 µg/ml: 8-kan 1-4; more growth curves can be found in Supplementary Data). (D) Isolates derived from (four replicates of) the P0 8-kan and the P1 8-kan populations were tested for their MIC (red bars) and growth in plain LB (black bars, taken at 7 h. after inoculation). Many isolates in P0 were sick, i.e. had a lower OD600 in plain LB but could resist kanamycin. The incidence of these sick isolates decreases after P1, and fit resistant forms seem to dominate. For comparison, kanamycin MICs (red bars) and OD600 (black bars) of multiple isolates, from P0 and P1 control wild-type populations grown in plain LB, are shown in the right panels.We studied the kanamycin resistance of the bacterial population grown after P0 in 4-kan or 8-kan. For the 4-kan populations, MIC assays were performed on a sample drawn at 24 h (Fig. 1B). For the 8-kan cells, these assays were performed on individual isolates derived from the 24-h-old P0 culture (Fig. 1D). This difference in approach was adopted, because replicate 8-kan cultures grown in flasks for these experiments appeared to show more variable growth characteristics than the 4-kan cultures (Fig. 1A and C); note however that this cannot be statistically supported by data from a larger number of cultures grown in plates (Supplementary Data). The 4-kan populations displayed an increase in MIC of ~2-fold compared with the initial inoculum (Fig. 1B, red bars). Among the clones derived from the 8-kan populations, a few were only slightly different from the wild type, whereas others displayed an increase of ~2- to 5-fold (Fig. 1D, P0 8-kan). As a control, bacteria grown in plain LB showed no increase in kanamycin resistance (Fig. 1B—black bars; for wild type control colonies refer to the right side panels in Fig. 1D).After the first 24 h culture, the bacteria were diluted into fresh medium containing the same concentration of the antibiotic (i.e. P1). The MIC of the 4-kan population was determined again after entry into stationary phase and found to be ~4-fold higher than a control population that had not been exposed to the antibiotic (Fig. 1B, red bars). Further serial passages in 4-kan did not lead to substantial changes in the MIC of the population, suggesting that a stable variant had emerged. In the 8-kan populations, after dilution into fresh medium, most resultant isolates displayed >4- to 5-fold increase in MIC over the wild type (Fig. 1D, 8-kan P1 colonies). We do not attempt a direct, time-anchored comparison of MICs between the 4-kan and 8-kan cultures here, since the experiment for the 8-kan populations included a plating step to isolate colonies, which was not performed for the 4-kan cultures (see Supplementary Data for time-anchored population MICs for a separate set of experiments).What are the characteristics of the bacterial population resulting from the above-described growth in the antibiotic, in terms of its ability to grow in the presence or absence of kanamycin? For this, we first grew cells—produced by P0 cultures in antibiotic-free, 4-kan or 8-kan media—on LB agar plates. Individual colonies so obtained were then checked for their ability to grow in the absence of kanamycin (plain LB, 0-kan), moderately sublethal levels of kanamycin (4-kan) and lethal levels of kanamycin (20-kan). We note here that this experimental strategy is limited in the sense that the growth experiments performed to assess fitness also contribute to further evolution and selection. However, these steps were performed in the same manner for 4-kan and 8-kan populations, and therefore, the results thus obtained enable a direct comparison between the two antibiotic concentrations. Control colonies derived from all the populations immediately after inoculation displayed wild-type characteristics: good growth in 0-kan, poor growth at 4-kan and no growth at 20-kan (Supplementary Data, 0 h.). Similarly, colonies derived from populations not treated with kanamycin retained this response throughout the course of the experiment (Supplementary Data). Most colonies derived from 4-kan populations grew well in LB and in 4-kan; in addition, they were more resistant to 20-kan than the wild type (Fig. 2A, and Supplementary Data). In contrast, a proportion of colonies derived from 8-kan populations, though more resistant to the antibiotic than the wild type, showed severe growth defects (Fig. 2B, and Supplementary Data). The proportion of colonies with a growth defect varied between trials (Fig. 2B, compare group-1 and -2 colonies in 8-kan 1 and 2 at 24 h, between the two replicates). After another passage in the same concentration of the antibiotic (P1), both 4-kan and 8-kan cultures produced antibiotic-resistant colonies with little growth defect (Fig. 2A and 2B, group-3 colonies increase at P1).

(A) E. coli populations grown in 4-kan are more homogeneous in composition and comprised mostly of fit variants at 24 h.

On the other hand, many sick but resistant mutants persist longer during growth in 8-kan. We suspect that the difference between the two antibiotic regimes in the trade-off between growth and antibiotic resistance might explain our observations. The lower toxicity, at lower antibiotic concentration, leads to higher growth rates. This could select for variants with low fitness defects; resistant, but sick bacteria might be competed out rapidly. On the other hand, the greater lethality imposed by the higher antibiotic concentration allows the persistence of sick bacteria for a longer time. To test this further, we performed in silico stochastic growth simulations in which two types of antibiotic-resistant mutant bacteria—one with high growth and the other with low growth—were competed against each other and with a very slow-growing, antibiotic-sensitive wild type (see Methods and Supplementary Data). These simulations suggest that the slow-growing mutant will be out-competed more rapidly in an environment supporting higher growth rates in general (e.g. 4-kan) than one where overall growth rates are low (8-kan) (Fig. 2C and 2D). Our analysis of colonies had also suggested tentatively that the manner in which stationary-phase OD varies with the concentration of the antibiotic might differ across populations: while many of the fast-growing colonies show a sharp decline in growth from 4-kan to 20-kan, the slow-growing variants typically show less drastic decline in growth in 20-kan compared with 4-kan (Supplementary Data). This will only accentuate the trends observed in our simulations.3.2. Representative low-cost mutations are in the translation elongation factor EF-GTo characterize the mutational trajectories taken by E. coli towards increased resistance in 4-kan, we performed deep sequencing of the (meta-)genomes of the bacterial populations at various time points during growth in the antibiotic. Two biological replicate cultures were analysed. We performed gDNA sequencing at high temporal resolution for the P0 culture (Fig. 3A). As mentioned earlier, over the course of this culture, the MIC increased ~2-fold from the basal level. As a control, growth was monitored in an antibiotic-free medium and gDNA sequenced from mid-exponential- and stationary-phase populations. For subsequent dilutions into antibiotic-containing media (P1, P2, etc.), sequencing was performed after entry into stationary phase. Figure 3.Open in new tabDownload slideFusAP610T confers low-cost resistance to kanamycin. (A) Heat maps indicating the proportion of reads supporting a given mutation (red—100% of reads support the mutation; black—close to 0%, i.e. very low; grey—0%, i.e. not detectable). Each column represents a time point, and the mutations are represented by rows (AP0-5: passages in 4-kan; 15–23 h: time points in AP0; ME, S and P1-5: mid-exponential- and stationary-phase time points in passage 0 and passages 1 through 5 in 0-kan; replicates are indicated below the heat map). Standard single letter amino acid representations have been used to denote substituted reside at the indicated position in superscripts. Intergenic region (IGR) mutations are represented by a ‘-/-’ between the genes flanking the IGR and the nucleotides found modified are indicated with a ‘>’. For simplicity, mutations found only in 4-kan populations are shown. However, since AcrER334L was also present in the control, the mutation is included separately below. While the mutation in fusA reaches (true, i.e. 100%) fixation in 4-kan populations by P3, it is also detected in the initial round of growth (P0) albeit at very low levels. AcrER334L fixes along with FusAP610T in the second replicate but remains in the first replicate at an intermediate level. This maintenance can be explained only if FusAP610T arose again in this background (see Supplementary Data: Sanger-sequenced isolates suggest this scenario). A mutation in cpxA is also seen in AP0 in both replicates, but it is lost in subsequent passages as the mutation in fusA picks up. (B) The FusAP610T mutation alone confers ~3-fold resistance to kanamycin. This panel shows box plots (as defined in description of Figure 2C) of MICs (n = 8) for the wild-type strain into which the FusAP610T mutation was transferred by phage transduction (FusAP610T-FRT; named so as the FRT site remains near the gene after the process).

Bold colours represent the competition experiment (see Methods), whereas the light colours represent the mock competition experiment (both strains were grown separately and mixed prior to plating). Plotted are log10 colony forming units (cfu)/ml versus the time point {error bars represent relative error in y, [0.434 * (dy/y)], from pooled multiple counts from two independent replicates; dy: standard deviation}. (F) Promoter activities (normalized to fall between 0 and 1) for GFPmut2 induction are similar in the wild type and the FusAP610T mutant, suggesting the absence of any defects in translation in this mutant. GFPmut2 induction from the PBAD promoter in WT-FRT and FusAP610T-FRT for two different concentrations of arabinose is shown (1 mM: 1 Ara; 10 mM: 10 Ara and uninduced control: UI). Induction was done in plain LB; period of peak promoter activity is represented by a box (error bars indicate standard deviation for four replicates). For induction in presence of kanamycin, see Supplementary Data.To catalogue the constituting members of the heterogeneous population resulting from growth of E. coli in 8-kan, we first plated 24-h-old 8-kan populations (P0 and P1) on LB agar plates. We selected multiple isolates, representing the range of MIC and growth rates observed, from four biological replicates for gDNA sequencing (Fig. 1D). From each of P0 and P1, we sequenced 11 isolates, alongside one isolate from a control population grown in plain LB.The only mutation that had gone to fixation in the two replicate 4-kan cultures was one in fusA (FusAP610T), the gene encoding the translation elongation factor EF-G, which was found in the population obtained after P1 in 4-kan. The P0 culture in 4-kan had produced a genetically heterogeneous population of variants, with none supported by >31% of reads (e.g. AcrER334L mutation, also seen in E. coli not exposed to the antibiotic and probably not associated with kanamycin resistance as shown in Supplementary Data, and CpxAG124C in a sensory histidine kinase with known links to antibiotic resistance49; Fig. 3A, Supplementary Data). All these mutations were supported by high-quality Illumina sequence reads and gave no reason for suspecting artefactual data: no enrichment for being seen in sequences mapping to one strand and not particularly located at the ends of reads. Here we also note that we do not see any evidence for ribosomal gene amplifications (Supplementary Data). In contrast, at the end of P1, FusAP610T was supported by >90% of sequencing reads. In retrospect, we noticed that the FusAP610Tmutation was present at low levels (~1%) in sequencing reads from the P0 culture in 4-kan, showing that it had started to develop during the earliest stages of the experiment, going to fixation at some point in P1. This mutation was commonly present alongside that in acrE and less frequently with a mutation in the intergenic region between rho and wecA, as determined by Sanger sequencing of PCR amplicons from single colonies (Supplementary Data). The population (Fig. 1B), and various clones isolated from it (Supplementary Data), showed ~4-fold higher MIC for kanamycin, with no difference between clones carrying only the FusAP610T mutation and those carrying the rho-wecA mutation alongside (Supplementary Data). The FusAP610T mutation was stable: it was found in genome sequences obtained after 5 passages (Fig. 3A), and we did not observe any change in MIC even after 10 serial passages in an antibiotic-free medium (Fig. 1B, green bars).We identified two other FusA mutations in the 8-kan cultures, in six (out of 11) colonies from the P0 culture and eight (out of 11) colonies from P1 (Fig. 4, Supplementary Data). The most common mutation was FusAA608E, located close to the FusAP610T mutation found in our 4-kan cultures. The FusAA608E mutation was found alongside a stop mutation in yhgA (YhgAW136*); given the obvious importance of fusA mutations to kanamycin resistance, it is likely that the yhgA mutation is not contributing and is probably a hitch-hiking candidate. All the FusAA608E-containing clones had a mutation in acrE (AcrER334L), which was also present in the no-antibiotic control isolate sequenced. Yet another EF-G mutation was found in a single colony obtained from P1: this mutation affected the same residue as that in the 4-kan cultures, with P610 mutated to a leucine (FusAP610L) instead of a threonine seen in the 4-kan population.

However, the FusAP610T mutation performed relatively poorly in 8-kan (Fig. 5A), suggesting that its effect is more restricted to lower kanamycin concentrations. The difference between the two mutations at the same site may also be reflected in the higher MIC of the FusAP610L variant (Fig. 5C). This isolate had also an intergenic mutation at another locus (ybfQ -/- ybfL); at this point, we do not know whether this adds to the resistance phenotype of FusAP610L. We also noticed that FusAP610L grew much better than FusAA608E in 8-kan (Fig. 5A), despite the two being obtained from the same culture conditions and carrying mutations in adjacent residues. Consistent with this observation, FusAA608E-containing isolates were embellished with additional mutations in P1, but not in P0 (Fig. 4—P1). These, admittedly curious, mutations include RpoDL261Q, CpxAF218Y, TopAS180L and CyaAN600Y. It is notable that the FusAA608E + CpxAF218Y/TopAS180L/CyaAN600Y/RpoDL261Q double mutants showed higher growth than the FusAA608E single mutation alone in 8-kan (Fig. 5A), though the single and the double mutations did not differ from each other in growth in the absence of the antibiotic (Fig. 5B). And the MIC of the double mutants was higher when FusAA608E was present in combination with RpoDL261Q and CyaAN600Y; with the others, the increase was not so evident (Fig. 5C). These might suggest genotype-dependent fine tuning of adaptation to the selected concentration of the antibiotic.

The stationary-phase OD600 for the isolates containing the FusAA608E alone, and in combination with gatC .-CC (cytosine insertions) mutation, is lower in 8-kan than for any of the other mutants. This suggests that the second site mutations in RpoD, CpxA, TopA and CyaA may improve FusAA608E strain's ability to grow at low kanamycin concentrations. Of note, the FusAP610T mutation isolated from 4-kan populations does not grow as well as the other fusA mutant strains in 8-kan. (C) Kanamycin MICs (n = 8; box plots as defined in description of Figure 2C) for the isolates with the mutations in EF-G (fusA).

However, the FusAA608E mutation alone or in combination with gatC .-CC (cytosine insertions) or TopAS180L confers resistance levels similar to the FusAP610T mutation (P = 0.289, 0.817 and 0.151, respectively). In combination with CyaAN600Y, CpxAF218Y,and RpoDL261Q, the FusAA608E mutation does better and has higher resistance than either FusAP610T or FusAA608E alone (P = 0.006, 0.0003 and <10-5, respectively). The emergence of some of these mutations in P1, although a resistant mutation is already present, may be explained by this observation.Figure 5.Open in new tabDownload slideMultiple EF-G mutations confer kanamycin resistance which is increased by second site mutations.

The emergence of some of these mutations in P1, although a resistant mutation is already present, may be explained by this observation.The above analysis show that several mutations in fusA arise in cultures grown in kanamycin and spread through the population rapidly. All the three mutations are present at the carboxy-end of Domain 4 of EF-G, the tip of which interacts with the decoding site of the ribosome (Supplementary Data). To specifically investigate the contribution of FusAP610T to kanamycin resistance and its cost in terms of growth in the absence of the antibiotic, we used phage transduction to move this mutation into a parental wild-type strain. This strain now had the FusAP610T mutation in addition to an FRT site downstream of fusA (between the rpsG-fusA-tufA transcription unit and chiA). Genome sequencing of this clone showed that no other mutation had been introduced during transduction (data not shown). This strain is henceforth referred to as the fusAmut::FRT strain. The characteristics of fusAmut::FRT strain were compared with a wild type carrying the FRT site in the same region (wt::FRT) and with the parental wild type. We measured the MIC of the fusAmut::FRT strain and found it to be comparable with those of the clones carrying the mutation (Fig. 3B, compare FA-FRT and Isolate 1). The wt::FRT showed no resistance, similar to the wild type without the FRT site. The wt::FRT, as well as the parental wild type, showed little or slow growth in solid or liquid media containing 4-kan (Fig. 3C). However, the fusAmut::FRT strain grew as well in 4-kan (Fig. 3C) as the wt::FRT and the parental wild type in non-antibiotic medium (Fig. 3D). Finally, the fusAmut::FRT strain, when replaced with the wt::FRT allele by phage transduction, lost its resistance to kanamycin (Fig. 3B). These show that the FusAP610T mutation contributes almost entirely to the resistance of the 4-kan evolved population.The following set of growth experiments allowed us to confirm that the FusAP610T mutation does not result in a perceivable growth defect in the absence of the antibiotic: fusAmut::FRT could grow almost as well as wt::FRT in LB without kanamycin (Fig. 3D); the fusAmut::FRT strain grew well and conferred kanamycin resistance even at 42°C (Supplementary Data), showing the absence of a temperature-sensitive phenotype in contrast to previously isolated FusA mutants32; the fusAmut::FRT strain competed well with wt::FRT strain in competition assays (Fig. 3E and Supplementary Data for competitions with wild type without the FRT site). Finally, the fusAmut::FRT strain did not seem to have defects in translation as seen from kinetics of induction of GFPmut2 from a tightly controlled arabinose-inducible promoter (pBAD18::gfpmut2) (Fig. 3F). For induction in the presence of kanamycin, see Supplementary Data.Hou et al.,32 in their report of a screen for temperature-sensitive mutations in EF-G, document two mutations: fusA100 (FusAG502D) and fusA101 (FusAQ495P). The screen was performed by selection of resistant colonies at 30°C on LB agar containing lethal concentrations of kanamycin. These two strains seemed to incur a heavy cost manifested by growth defects even at non-restrictive temperatures and had defects in translation as seen from kinetics of induction of a reporter gene (ß-gal in their assay). In contrast, our study, by performing selection experiments at sublethal kanamycin concentration, has identified a group of mutations with little detectable defect in growth or induction of translation.3.3. Mutations in ATP synthase confer costly, basal level resistance to kanamycinWhole genome sequencing indicated that isolates from the 8-kan population (5 from P0 and 3 from P1), which did not contain a mutation in EF-G, contained deletions in genes encoding subunits of ATP synthase (Fig. 4). The deletions in the genes encoding subunits of ATP synthase were of different lengths: deletions of 108 bp (three isolates), 28 bp (1 isolate) and 1 bp (1 isolate) were seen in atpG, encoding the <U+03B3>-subunit of the ATP synthase complex; and a deletion of 15 bp (1 isolate) was seen in atpA encoding the a-subunit. The isolate with the 15 bp deletion in atpA also had the 1 bp deletion in atpG. A recent large-scale study of aminoglycoside resistance mutations had identified mutations not only in the ATP synthase, but also in other members of the oxidative phosphorylation pathway.33 This suggests that inactivation of the ATP synthase complex and oxidative phosphorylation must be a general mechanism towards resisting kanamycin. Whereas the three types of ATP synthase mutations described above were found in P0, only the 108 bp deletion in atpG could be recovered in P1 (Fig. 4).We analysed the isolates in which the ATP synthase mutations were present in further detail. All the three mutations in atpG are expected to delete the C-terminal end of the <U+03B3>-subunit of the F0 component of the ATP synthase (Supplementary Data). Since most of these strains are fully sequenced and do not possess any other mutations apart from the AcrER334L that does not confer kanamycin resistance, we could work directly with these strains. Surprisingly, only the isolates with the 108 bp deletion in atpG seem to be around 1.5- to 2-fold resistant to kanamycin (Fig. 6A) and grow well in 8-kan (Fig. 6B), while the other deletion strains do not. Regardless of the resistance phenotype, all of these strains have incurred a severe cost as a result of the deletions as seen from their growth in plain LB (Fig. 6C). Consistent with this, there is a relative decline in the abundance of ATP synthase mutants in P1 compared with P0, with a concomitant increase in the abundance of the less costly mutations in FusA.

(A) Kanamycin MICs (n = 8, box plots as defined in description of Figure 2C) for the isolates with the deletions (two-sample independent t-tests for wild type against isolates yield P values < 10-5 for all except isolates L: P = 0.0095 and X: P = 0.000879). Thus, these deletions increase resistance to kanamycin only slightly.

Several mutations, mapping to the same or adjacent residues in EF-G, confer resistance to the antibiotic. On the other hand, mutations in ATP synthase confer resistance to kanamycin, but also display severe growth defects.4. DiscussionAntibiotic resistance is a major problem in health today. In particular, development of resistance under sub-inhibitory concentrations of an antibiotic is of interest. Bacteria are believed to be routinely exposed to sublethal concentrations of various antibiotics in their natural environments over long periods of time. In a clinical setting, improper adherence to a dose regime could lead to low levels of antibiotics in the body. Mutations conferring resistance to antibiotics target essential genes which may tolerate mutations poorly. Therefore, they represent a balance between the level of resistance they confer, as well as a possible loss of fitness—in the absence of the antibiotic. In addition, the accessibility of a resistance-conferring mutation also affects the kinetics of the evolution of resistance.In this study, we observe that resistance of laboratory E. coli to two sublethal concentrations of the aminoglycoside kanamycin eventually produces a mutation that provides sufficient resistance to the antibiotic, while being of low cost as measured by growth or fitness in the absence of the antibiotic. This is only to be expected given enough time for selection to act as long as a less costly mutation (or a combination of mutations) for resistance is available to the bacterium. In a recent, intriguing report, an antibiotic resistance-conferring mutation was found in fact to enhance fitness of Salmonella.50In cases where the levels of resistance conferred by a mutation are negatively correlated with its fitness, one would expect resistance to be persistently associated with a growth defect. Our experimental conditions presumably do not impose such a trade-off, though this needs to be systematically evaluated. We observe however that the selection under high sublethal concentrations of kanamycin results in the longer persistence of growth-defective variants in the population. This is consistent with the prior isolation of two defective, but resistant mutations by selection under lethal kanamycin concentrations.32A representative low-cost mutation we have isolated is in the translation elongation factor EF-G. It is surprising that at least one of the mutations here displays little defect in growth or in inducing translation of GFP in cellulo. Further, the mutated residue P610, which we have investigated in some detail here, and A608 are both highly conserved as observed from multiple sequence alignments of EF-G from >2,000 bacterial genomes (Supplementary Data). Analysis of this residue in the context of EF-G structure shows that it is located at the C-terminal end of ‘Domain IV’ (DIV; Supplementary Data), whose tip interacts with the ribosomal decoding site. Mutation from a Proline to any other residue (Threonine and Leucine in our study; Glutamate in a recent screen for aminoglycoside resistance33) might increase the flexibility in movement of DIV, a feature that appears to play important roles during translocation.51The levels of resistance conferred by the P610T mutation to a panel of aminoglycosides (Supplementary Data), in the context of a recent single-molecule study15 investigating the contribution of translocation inhibition to the activities of these antibiotics, suggest that its contribution to resistance is consistent with an effect on translocation. Aminoglycosides also affect ribosome recycling16; however, the mutation we describe is unable to restore a temperature-sensitive phenotype of a mutation in the ribosome release factor (Supplementary Data). In summary, a mutation at the C-terminal end of DIV of EF-G confers low-cost resistance to 2-DOS aminoglycoside antibiotics in a manner probably consistent with an effect on ribosome translocation. We note here that, as described in the ‘Results’, not all EF-G mutations—despite targeting the same site or adjacent sites—are equal.At the other end of the fitness scale is the set of mutations we have identified in the ATP synthase. Most of these mutations are in the gamma component of the F0 subunit. The gamma polypeptide is the shaft that couples the proton gradient-driven rotation of the F1 subunit to the catalytic region on the F0 subunitAll the mutations in the gamma polypeptide, either as frame-shifts or as in-frame deletions, remove the C-terminal ~40 residues of the polypeptide (Supplementary Data). This end of the polypeptide cosily nestles in a region surrounded by the catalytic components of the ATP synthase (Supplementary Data). It is thus reasonable to expect that these mutations abolish ATP synthase activity. Though E. coli should be able to synthesize ATP via substrate-level phosphorylation, oxidative phosphorylation culminating in ATP synthase activity is the major source of ATP. Thus, as expected, these mutations in ATP synthase result in severe growth defects. How inactivation of the ATP synthase can confer resistance to aminoglycosides is open to debate. To our knowledge, there are two relevant models in the literature. A recently published large-scale screen for aminoglycoside resistance identified members of the oxidative phosphorylation pathway as a major class of targets of mutation.33 These researchers report that a reduction in the PMF, as a consequence of these mutations, increases aminoglycoside resistance by decreasing the uptake of these antibiotics. On the flip side, these mutations increase sensitivity to other classes of antibiotics, which require PMF for efflux. A second model is related to the generation of reactive oxygen species. It has been suggested that many antibiotics kill their target cells by producing reactive oxygen.52 Inhibition of ATP synthase activity would eventually result in the cessation of oxidative phosphorylation, thus reducing reactive oxygen production. However, this model remains controversial and the jury is out to decide.24,26Besides representing two extremes in the fitness landscape, the two mutations described here also represent two levels of ‘accessibility’. The space of mutations for ATP synthase inactivation is potentially large and, therefore, easily achieved. On the other hand, a mutation in EF-G, which specifically affects a certain function, resulting in low-cost aminoglycoside resistance is likely to be relatively rare. Despite this, the fact that the mutation in EF-G is more commonly observed in our experiments is a reflection of the considerable over-compensation of the difference in accessibility by that in fitness, both in the presence and in the absence of the antibiotic.Mutations in EF-G may also indicate fine tuning of adaptation to narrow windows of antibiotic concentration: a mutation selected in a low sublethal concentration of the antibiotic resists a higher concentration poorly, though one selected in the latter performs better at this concentration despite the two mutations targeting the same amino acid residue (P to T versus P to L). In contrast, mutations in ATP synthase may confer a basal level of resistance that is robust to a broader range of antibiotic concentrations. This is suggested by a difference, between mutations in EF-G and those in ATP synthase, in the manner in which their growth decreases with increasing concentration of kanamycin. To visualize this, we first obtain 0-kan normalized MIC curves in which growth in (any) concentration of kanamycin, as measured by OD600 after 24 h, is normalized with respect to growth in the absence of kanamycin. Based on this, we find that the decline in growth with increasing antibiotic concentration is steeper for EF-G mutations than for ATP synthase mutations (Supplementary Data).In summary, our work points to the relevance of sublethal concentrations of an antibiotic to the rapid development of low-cost and resistant mutants, while also describing two classes of mutations—one obviously costly and the other less so—that confer resistance to a subset of aminoglycoside antibiotics.5.
