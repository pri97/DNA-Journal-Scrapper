These sequences are homologous to flanking sequences of 664 bp with terminal inverted repeat sequences of about 70 bp. The 664-bp sequence and most of the 14 homologues identified were flanked by direct repeat sequences of 9 bp. These findings indicate that the repeated sequence, named Tnat1 , is a transposable element that duplicates a 9-bp sequence at the target site on transposition and that ATLN44 is inserted in one Tnat1 member. Interestingly, all of the Tnat1 members had tandem repeats comprised of several units of a 60-bp sequence, the number of repeats differing among Tnat1 members. Of the Tnat1 members identified, one was inserted into another sequence repeated in the A. thaliana genome: that sequence is about 770 bp long and has terminal inverted repeat sequences of about 110 bp. The sequence is flanked by direct repeats of a 9-bp sequence, indicating that it is another transposable element, named Tnat2 , from A. thaliana . Moreover, Tnat2 members had a tandem repeat about 240 bp long. Tnat1 and Tnat2 with tandem repeats in their internal regions show no homology to each other or to any of the elements identified previously; therefore they appear to be novel transposable elements.

Random PCR-based and PCR relay sequencing constitute the basis of this novel strategy. Most of the genome is sequenced by the former process that requires only a set of non-specific primers and a template DNA. Random PCR-based sequencing reduces redundancy in sequencing by exploiting known sequence information. The number of primers required for random PCR was significantly diminished by using a combination of primers. The former process can be partially replaced by the shotgun method, if necessary. The gap-filling process can be effectively performed by way of PCR relay. The feasibility of this strategy was demonstrated using the Escherichia coli genome. This strategy enhances the global effort towards genome sequencing by being available through the Internet and by allowing the use of preexisting sequence data.

The ftsE and ftsX genes of Neisseria gonorrhoeae ( Ng ) CH811 were cloned, sequenced and were shown to be co-transcribed from two promoters (P E 1 and P E 2) which were identified upstream of  ftsE  N g by primer extension. Sequence analysis of FtsE  N g and alignment with other FtsE indicated that it contained the conserved motifs of ABC domains while sequence alignment of FtsX  N g with other published FtsX sequences predicted that they all contain four transmembrane segments anda conserved motif (Leu-hydrophobic aa-Gly-Ala/Gly) which may prove to be important for FtsX function. The viability of  ftsE  N g and  ftsX  N g mutants that were constructed by insertional inactivation indicated that these genes are not essential. The role of FtsE and FtsX is controversial. Analysis of  ftsE  N g and  ftsX  N g mutants by transmission electron microscopy showed that both exhibited morphological abnormalities indicative of defective division sites and in some cases aberrant condensation of DNA.

Amylose content (AC), gel consistency (GC) and gelatinization temperature (GT) are important traits determining rice quality. A population of recombinant inbred lines (RIL) derived from KDML105 × CT9993 cross was used to study the genetic control of AC, GC and GT traits. A total of 191 markers were used in the linkage map construction. The 1605.3 cM linkage map covering nearly the whole rice genome was used for QTL (define QTL) analysis. Four QTLs for AC were detected on chromosomes 3, 4, 6 and 7. These QTLs accounted for 80% of phenotypic variation explained (PVE) in AC. The presence of one major gene as well as several modifiers was responsible for the expression of the trait. Two QTLs on chromosome 6 and one on chromosome 7 were detected for GC, which accounts for 57% of PVE. A single gene of major effect along with modifier genes controls GC from this cross. The QTLs in the vicinity of waxy locus were major contributors in the expression of AC and GC. The finding that the position of QTLs for AC and GC were near each other may reflect tight linkage or pleiotropy.

Just like AC and GC, one major gene and modifier genes governed the variation in GT resulting from the KDML105 × CT9993 cross.

In this approach, a short “bridge” DNA is inserted during the self-ligation step of the inverse PCR technique. This bridge DNA acts as primer annealing sites for amplification and subsequent direct sequencing. Successive PCR amplifications enable selective amplification of the unknown sequences from a complex mixture. Unlike previously described methods, our method does not require special materials, such as synthetic adapters or biotinylated primers that must be prepared each time to adapt the target. Furthermore, no complex steps such as dephosphorylation or purification are needed. Our method can save time and reduce the cost of cloning unknown sequences; it is ideal for routine, rapid gene walking. We applied this method to a GC-rich bacterial genome and succeeded in determining the end sequences of a 4.5-kb fragment."

A total of 84 predicted protein-coding genes including 7 genes duplicated in the inverted repeat regions, 4 ribosomal RNA genes and 37 tRNA genes (30 gene species) representing 20 amino acids species were assigned on the genome based on similarity to genes previously identified in other chloroplasts. All the predicted genes were conserved among dicot plants except that rpl22 , a gene encoding chloroplast ribosomal protein CL22, was missing in L. japonicus . Inversion of a 51-kb segment spanning rbcL to rps16 (positions 5161–56,176)in the large single copy region was observed in the chloroplast genome of L. japonicus .  The sequence data and gene information are available on our World Wide Web database at Author Webpage . "

The genome of M. loti consisted of a single chromosome (7, 036, 071 bp) and two plasmids, designated as pMLa (351, 911 bp) and pMLb (208, 315 bp). The chromosome comprises 6752 potential protein-coding genes, two sets of rRNA genes and 50 tRNA genes representing 47 tRNA species. Fifty-four percent of the potential protein genes showed sequence similarity to genes of known function, 21% to hypothetical genes, and the remaining 25% hadno apparent similarity to reported genes. A 611-kb DNA segment, a highly probable candidate of a symbiotic island, was identified, and 30 genes for nitrogen fixation and 24 genes for nodulation were assigned in this region. Codon usage analysis suggested that the symbiotic islandas well as the plasmids originated andw ere transmittedfrom other genetic systems. The genomes of two plasmids, pMLa and pMLb, contained 320 and 209 potential protein-coding genes, respectively, for a variety of biological functions. These include genes for the ABC-transporter system, phosphate assimilation, two-component system, DNA replication and conjugation, but only one gene for nodulation was identified.

We have cloned, sequenced and analyzed the genomic structure of a mouse sodium-dependent vitamin Ctransp orter gene, Slc23a1 (also known as Svct2 ). The mouse Slc23a1 cDNA is 6.4 kb long and was cloned directly from a mouse brain RNA preparation. Hybridization screening of a mouse genomic BAClibrary identified BAC 53L21 whichcontains at least the entire coding sequence of the mouse Slc23a1 gene. Determination of the exon-intron structure of the gene revealed 17 exons ranging from 58 bp to 4407 bp extending over 50 kb of the mouse genome, with the translation start codon located in exon 3. Its 1944 nucleotide open reading frame encodes a polypeptide of 647 aa, which is highly similar to rat and human orthologs. The mouse gene was assigned to chromosome 2qG2 by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis. Expression of this gene was demonstrated in a wide range of tissues, with especially high levels in brain. Neurodegenerative diseases with an established role for oxidative stress in the cytoplasm may therefore be conditions of SLC23A1 dysfunction.

The average sizes of the inserts and corresponding open reading frames of cDNA clones analyzed here were 4.9 kb and 2.7 kb (corresponding to 895 amino acid residues), respectively. By computer-assisted analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences, 44 predicted gene products were classified into five functional categories of proteins relating to cell signaling/communication, nucleic acid management, cell structure/motility, protein management, and metabolism. Furthermore, the expression profiles of the genes were also studied in 10 human tissues, 8 brain regions, spinal cord, fetal brain and fetal liver by reverse-transcription-coupled polymerase chain reaction, the products of which were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay."
