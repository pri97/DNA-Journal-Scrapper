"," The first volume of DNA Research was published in 1994, and since then, it has been published as a leading journal in the field. The online version of the journal was launched in 2000. From its launch, the online journal has been freely accessible to all readers without charge. Though thorough analysis has not been performed to confirm causality, with stringent peer review for high quality papers and a full-sponsored free online access, the journal has received much attention, and articles in the journal have attracted much citation. As we have become the top impact factor journal in Japan, our next goal is to become recognized internationally. In order to achieve this goal, the Editorial Board and I have decided that it is necessary to publish with an international publisher who can help us to further develop the journal. I here gladly announce that we have decided to publish with Oxford University Press.As part of our collaboration with Oxford University Press, I am introducing several changes in journal policy and functionality.Open Access ModelFirst, I have decided that as of the first issue of 2006 the journal will move to an Open Access model, a model where authors will be charged for publication in the journal in order to continue free access for all readers, and to increase the journal functionality and dissemination. Authors will be charged $500 for publishing an article in the journal. This Open Access charge is in addition to any normal colour charges that might apply. However, in order to encourage growth of research in developing countries, waivers are applied to authors from such countries that are listed in OUP's qualifying countries. An additional waiver is available for articles which the Editorial Board recommend as being of particularly high importance. Interested authors should contact the Editor in charge of his/her paper.Online Version at HighWire Press Though I regret having to introduce an extra author charge, this new author charge will enable continued access to all readers, while introducing many improvements. One of the biggest change, which has already been implemented in 2005, is the relaunch of the online journal on HighWire Press at Author Webpage . HighWire Press is a reknown platform hosting many high quality journals, and I believe that sharing such a platform will increase the visibility of DNA Research . Old issues have already been relocated to this site and are available as pdf files. Recent issues, starting with Volume 12 issue 3, now include a HTML version with added functionality. The journal is now registered in CrossRef, and references are linked to cited articles, and forward links will be created between new articles citing the relevant article. Authors will be able to keep track of how many times a citation is made on his or her article, and see how many times the article is downloaded. Moreover, Advanced Access is introduced, where accepted articles will be published online before the issue is published in print. The average time from acceptance to online publication will be greatly reduced.Online Submission and Peer Review The journal is also planning the implementation of an online submission system in Spring, 2006. This will facilitate easy submission, and global peer review in a shorter time span. I hope that international authors will consider DNA Research as their choice of submission.  I am grateful to the Editors for their increased support during this important time of change, and ask for their continued help in the further growth and success of DNA Research . "

Fine comparison of the two datasets obtained by microarray and WGPScanning provided much further details on the O157 genome diversity than illustrated by each method alone, indicating the usefulness of this combinational approach in the genomic comparison of closely related strains.1. IntroductionEscherichia coli is a constituent of normal microflora in intestinal tracts, but certain types of E. coli strains are associated with diseases in human and animals.1,2 Among these pathogenic E. coli strains, enterohemorrhagic E. coli O157 not only causes large outbreaks of hemorrhagic colitis but also numerous small outbreaks and sporadic cases, and is regarded as one of the major worldwide public health concerns.3 The genome sequence determination of an O157 strain, RIMD 0509952 (referred to as O157 Sakai) and the genomic comparison with a nonpathogenic strain, K-12 MG1655,4,5 have revealed that the O157 chromosome is comprised of a 4.1 Mb backbone common with K-12 and a total of 1.4 Mb strain-specific sequences. O157 Sakai-specific sequences (referred to as S-loops) are inserted at various sites on the chromosome backbone, and encode more than 1600 of O157 Sakai-specific genes. Of importance is that most of the large S-loops are prophages and prophage-like elements. We have identified 18 prophages (Sp1-18) and 6 prophage-like elements (SpLE1-6). They comprise about two thirds of the O157 Sakai-specific sequences and have carried many virulence-related genes including Shiga toxin (Stx) genes (stx1 and stx2) into O157. This suggested that acquisition of these bacteriophages have played the key roles in the emergence of O157.5,6 Similar findings were also obtained by the genome sequencing analysis of another O157 strain, EDL933.7More recently, we analyzed, based on the genome sequence of O157 Sakai, the whole genome structures of eight O157 strains that displayed diverse XbaI-digestion patterns by a systematic PCR analysis called Whole Genome PCR Scanning (WGPScanning).8 In this analysis, we amplified the whole genome of each strain using 560 pairs of PCR primers, and searched for genomic segments with any structural differences by comparing each PCR product with that from O157 Sakai. This analysis provided the first genome-wide view on the genomic diversity of O157, and revealed that there is an unexpectedly high degree of diversity among O157 strains. In particular, the variation in prophages and prophage-related elements were remarkable, implying that their variability is the major factor generating such structural diversity. However, additional information on the gene level is required.In this study, we constructed an oligoDNA microarray according to the genome sequence of O157 Sakai. We first validated the accuracy of the comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analysis using this oligoarray by a test experiment with K-12 and O157 Sakai, and then performed a gene composition analysis of O157 using the same set of strains examined by the WGPScanning. We further made a fine comparison of the microarray data with WGPScanning data to understand the genomic diversity of O157 more in detail.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Bacterial strains, growth condition and DNA extractionEight O157 strains examined in this study were 980938 (referred to as #2), 980706 (#3), 990281 (#4), 980551 (#5), 990570 (#6), 981456 (#7), 982243 (#8) and 981795 (#9). They were human isolates obtained in Japan in 1998 as described previously.8 All were negative for Sorbitol fermentation (SOR−) and β-glucuronidase activity (GUD−) whose activities were examined after 24 h incubation at 37°C on SIB II agar plates (Kyokuto Pharmaceutical Industrial, Tokyo, Japan) and on ES Colimark agar plate (Eiken Kizai, Tokyo, Japan), respectively. As for strain #2, however, a weak positive reaction for β-glucuronidase was detected after 40 h incubation. O157 Sakai (RIMD 0509952) was used as the reference in all hybridization experiments. This strain was isolated in a large outbreak in Sakai city, Japan, which occurred in 1996, and has been sequenced by our group.5 The strain is available at the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC BAA-460). Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 was kindly provided by Dr H. Mori (Nara Institute of Science and Technology). Cells were grown to the stationary phase at 37°C in Luria–Bertani medium. Genomic DNA was purified using the Genomic-tip 100/G and Genomic DNA buffer set (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instruction.2.2. Design of the O157 Sakai microarrayOligonucleotide probes were prepared for all the protein-coding genes on the O157 Sakai genome (5447 genes in total). Principles for the probe design were 60 mer in length and two probes for each gene. However, O157 Sakai contains 542 repeated genes, most of which are derived from IS elements or 13 lambda-like prophages sharing various length of DNA segments with almost identical sequences. As for these repeated genes, we prepared a single probe for each repeated gene family. Such probes totaled to 151 probes, each having two or more targets of ≥90% sequence identity on the O157 Sakai genome (referred to as ‘multiple hit probes’). As for the singleton genes (4905 genes), we were able to design two different 60 mer probes for 4173 genes, but only one 60 mer probe for 725 genes and one 44 or 45 mer probes for 7 genes. In total, 9620 probes were synthesized (Sigma-Aldrich Japan, Tokyo, Japan), and each probe was spotted onto poly-l-Lysine-coated glass slides (SD10011; Matsunami Glass Ind., Osaka, Japan) using SPBIO (Hitachi Software Engineering, Tokyo, Japan). As the negative controls, we included 20 oligonucleotides prepared from 10 yeast genes. Probe sequences are shown in Supplementary Table 1 available at Author Webpage.2.3. DNA labeling and hybridizationGenomic DNAs from test strains and the reference (O157 Sakai) were fluorescently labeled with Cy3 and Cy5, respectively, according to the following protocol. First, 3 µg of genomic DNA was labeled with aminoallyl-modified dUTP (Sigma) using the Bioprime DNA Labeling System (Invitrogen). DNAs were not sheared or digested by restriction enzymes prior to the labeling. The aminoallyl-labeled DNA was purified by Microcon YM-30 (Millipore), dried in a speed-vac and resuspended in 10 µl of 50 mM NaHCO3. After adding 10 µl of dimethyl sulfoxide solution containing Cy3 or Cy5 monofunctional reactive dye (Amersham), the sample was incubated at room temperature in the dark for 1 h to allow the dye to couple with DNA. The fluorescently labeled DNA was finally purified by the Qiaquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) into 30 µl elution buffer provided by the manufacturer.The Cy5-labeled and the Cy3-labeled DNA preparations (15 µl for each) were mixed with a 90 µl hybridization solution containing 6.4× SSC, 0.64% SDS and 1.3 mg/ml yeast tRNA. After incubation at 96°C for 2 min, the denatured sample was applied to a microarray slide and incubated on an ArrayBooster hybridization apparatus (Advalytix AG, Brunnthal, Germany) at 50°C for 16 h. The slide was then washed twice in 2× SSC/0.2% SDS at room temperature for 10 min, twice in 0.2× SSC/0.2% SDS at 50°C for 5 min and twice in 0.2× SSC at room temperature for 10 min. Finally, the slide was briefly rinsed with ethanol, dried by centrifugation and scanned with a FLA-8000 scanner (Fuji Photofilm, Tokyo, Japan). The obtained data were analyzed by the ArrayVision 8.0 software (Imaging Research). Each strain was examined twice with the labeled DNAs prepared independently for each hybridyzation.2.4. Data analysisIn our experimental condition, signal intensities from the negative controls were almost the same as that of the local background (LBG) in both cannels. Thus, spots with reference signal intensities lower than the LBG plus 5 SD or with some spotting abnormalities were categorized as ‘low quality’ (LQ). Signal intensities of other spots were corrected by subtracting the LBG, and were subjected to the ‘presence (P) or absence (A)’ determination using the array-based genotyping software GACK capable of dynamically generating cutoffs for present/absent (conserved/divergent) gene analysis in each array hybridization based on the signal-ratio distribution of un-normalized data sets.9 Since we performed two independent experiments for each strain, some probes yielded inconsistent results; P/A, P/LQ or A/LQ. In these cases, the probe was categorized as ‘uncertain’ (U), P or A, respectively.Finally, the presence or absence of each gene was determined according to the data from each spot. Because most genes were represented by two different probes on our microarray, inconsistent results could also be obtained from the two probes. In such cases, the gene was categorized as P when the judgments of two probes were P/U or P/LQ, as A when they were A/U or A/LQ, and as U when they were P/A or U/LQ. Processed data sets were displayed in the genomic order using the TREEVIEW program.10 Raw signal intensities from each spot and processed data are presented in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 available at Author Webpage, respectively.The presence or absence of 37 genes, which were always categorized into LQ on the current version of O157 Sakai microarray, were determined by PCR. The PCR amplification was performed using the Ex Taq PCR kit (TAKARA Bio, Japan) and 10 ng of template DNA with 30 cycles of 20 s at 98°C/30 s at 60°C/30 (or 120) s at 72°C. The list of genes analyzed by PCR and the primer sequences are shown in Supplementary Table 3 available at Author Webpage.3. Results3.1. Evaluation of the sensitivity and specificity of CGH analysis using the O157 Sakai oligoDNA microarrayThe array we constructed covered all of the 5447 protein-coding genes on the O157 Sakai genome; 3729 on the chromosome backbone, 1632 on S-loops, and 86 on pO157 and pOSAK1 plasmids.11 Before applying the microarray to the CGH analysis of O157 strains, we evaluated its sensitivity and specificity using K-12 MG1655 as a test strain.We first examined the sequence identities of each probe to the K-12 genome sequence by the FASTA program, and classified the probes into two groups; those with ≥90% identity into ‘Conserved in K-12’ (CK) probes and others into ‘Specific to Sakai’ (SS) probes. Each gene was then classified into CK, ‘Partially Conserved in K-12’ (PCK; genes represented by a CK probe and an SS probe), or SS genes according to the probe category (Supplementary Table 1). Next, the data of the microarray analysis were compared with those from the in silico analysis. In this comparison, repeated gene families, represented by ‘multiple hit probes’ having two or more targets of ≥90% sequence identity on the O157 Sakai genome, were analyzed separately from the singleton genes.As for the singleton genes, 96.9% of CK genes were correctly judged as ‘present’, and 97.8% of SS genes as ‘absent’ (Table 1). Most of the K-12 genes that gave incorrect results (false negative, false positive and uncertain) contained slightly divergent target sequences with 3–6 base mismatches with CK probes or weak homologies to the SS probes (70–90% identity). On the other hand, the presence/absence determination of the repeated gene families conserved in K-12 was somewhat problematic. While all families with the copy number ratio of >0.5 were judged as ‘present’, many families with the copy number ratios of ≤0.5 were judged as ‘absent’ or ‘uncertain’. This indicates that the repeated genes judged as ‘absent’ by the microarray analysis include those actually absent and those with reduced copy numbers. Thus, in the following CGH analyses of O157 strains, we decided to categorize such repeated genes into ‘uncertain due to the multiple target sequences in O157 Sakai’ [U(M)] and to consider only the repeated genes judged as ‘present’ as having the same or similar (or higher) copy numbers in the test strain.Summary of the CGH analysis of K-12 MG1655 using the O157 Sakai oligoDNA microarraya‘dSeq’ stands for the divergent sequence with 3–6 base mismatch, ‘wHom’ for the weak homology of 70–90% identiity, and ‘c.n.r.’ for the copy number ratio (MG1655/O157 Sakai).bThese 37 genes were always categorized into the LQ (low quality) group because of weak signal intensity. Their presence or absence in O157 strains was determind by PCR.cEach repeated gene family was represented by a single probe in the O157 Sakai oligoDNA microarray.Summary of the CGH analysis of K-12 MG1655 using the O157 Sakai oligoDNA microarraya‘dSeq’ stands for the divergent sequence with 3–6 base mismatch, ‘wHom’ for the weak homology of 70–90% identiity, and ‘c.n.r.’ for the copy number ratio (MG1655/O157 Sakai).bThese 37 genes were always categorized into the LQ (low quality) group because of weak signal intensity.

Overview of the gene content analysis of O157 strainsUsing the O157 Sakai microarray, we analyzed the gene content of eight O157 strains that were previously analyzed by the WGPScanning method.8 The data are summarized in Fig. 1 and Tables 2 and 3. As shown in Table 2, all the singleton genes identified in O157 Sakai were shared by at least one strain, but as many as 431 genes displayed variable distributions (or highly divergent sequences). Most of these ‘variably absent or present genes’ (referred to as VAP genes) belonged to the SS genes; 389 of the 1153 SS singleton genes were variably present. As shown in Fig. 1, these genes appeared very frequently on prophages and prophage-like elements; among the 640 singleton genes on these genetic elements, 350 (54.7%) displayed variable distributions. In sharp contrast, CK singleton genes exhibited a high level of conservation; only 1% (37 genes) exhibited variable distributions (Table 2). Among these, 20 genes were again located on prophage regions shared by O157 and K-12. In particular, a region of Sp10 (corresponding to a part of the Rac prophage in K-12) contained 11 VAP genes. These included recE and recT genes (ECs1933 and ECs1934) involved in the RecA-independent recombination and double-strand break repair.12The summary and data comparison of the microarray analysis and the WGPScanning analysis of the same set of O157 strains. Results from the gene composition analysis of eight O157 strains (strains #2–#9) using the O157 Sakai microarray are shown in the upper parts, and those from the genome structure analysis using the WGPScanning method in the lower parts. In the three rows above the microarray data, genes conserved and partially conserved in K-12 are indicated in green and pink, respectively (the first row), genes on prophages, prophage-like elements and plasmids in red (the second row), and repeated genes represented by multiple hit probes in black (the third row). Genes judged as present and absent in the microarray analysis are indicated in blue and yellow, respectively. Singleton and repeated genes that were classified as ‘uncertain’ are indicated in pink and gray, respectively. Results from the WGPScaning analysis are presented as follows. The segments of the same sizes as those from O157 Sakai are indicated in gray, and those with larger (≥2 kb) and smaller (<2 kb) size reductions in yellow and light yellow, respectively. The segments with larger (≥2 kb) and smaller (<2 kb) size increments are indicated in blue and light blue, respectively, and those that were not amplified in red. Prophages or prophage-like elements of O157 Sakai that were deleted (or translocated or not integrated) in some test strains are left blank, and their alternative integration sites so far identified are also indicated. In this figure, each segment is not drawn to scale but to the gene position in the data presentation of the microarray analysis. The data presented here are the most update version, thus several modifications have been made from the original version published previously.8The summary and data comparison of the microarray analysis and the WGPScanning analysis of the same set of O157 strains.

This pattern well correlated with the level of structural diversification observed in the WGPScanning analysis (Fig. 1, and also refer to Ref. 23). Most of the repeated gene families identified in O157 Sakai were also conserved (present in the same or similar copy number) in strains #3, #5, #8 and #9. These data suggest that the four strains are more closely related to O157 Sakai in terms of gene content and genome structure.3.3. O157 Sakai-specific genes with variable distributions in O157Classification of the SS genes according to their functions revealed that genes belonging to specific categories contained more VAP genes compared to other categories (Table 4). The abundance of VAP genes in ‘transcription’, ‘replication, recombination, and repair’, ‘genes with unknown or uncharacterized functions’ and ‘unclassified genes’ was remarkable. This appears to be a reflection of the fact that most VAP genes are on prophages or prophage-like elements, which contain many genes for transcriptional regulation, replication, repair and phage-specific functions as well as a number of uncharacterized genes.Categorization and conservation of SS genes in the eight O157 strainsaGenes that were absent at least in one strain.bOnly the singleton genes were analyzed.cGenes on the chromosome were classified according to the COG database.Categorization and conservation of SS genes in the eight O157 strainsaGenes that were absent at least in one strain.bOnly the singleton genes were analyzed.cGenes on the chromosome were classified according to the COG database.A notable finding was that 16 virulence-related genes exhibited variable distributions (Table 5). They included genes for Stx1, an HmwA-like protein, a TraT-homologue, a HecB-like protein. HmwA is known to be involved in adhesion in Haemophilus influenzae,13 TraT in serum resistance in enteric bacteria14 and HecB in hemolysin activation in Neisseria meningitides.15 One strain lacked the efa-1 gene which is involved in the adherence of non-O157 EHEC to cultured epithelial cells16 and in the inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation and proinflammatory cytokine synthesis in EPEC (called lifA in EPEC).17 In O157, the efa-1 gene is split into two genes (ECs3860 and 3861), but it has been reported that disruption of ECs3860 (efa-1') results in reduced expression and secretion of LEE (the locus of enterocyte effacement)-encoded proteins and in reduced adherence to cultured cells.18 The pchD and pchE genes encoding PerC-like regulators were also missing in four strains and one strain, respectively. Since the other pch genes (pchA, pchB and pchC) have been shown to regulate the LEE gene expression,19pchD and pchE may be involved in the regulation of virulence-related genes as well.Virulence-related genes that were variably present among the eight O157 strainsVirulence-related genes that were variably present among the eight O157 strainsMore importantly, several genes encoding type III secretion system (TTSS) effectors exhibited variable distributions. Recently, several proteins encoded on the non-LEE loci have been identified as effectors secreted by the LEE-encoded TTSS (non-LEE encoded effectors) in EPEC, EHEC and Citrobactor rodentium.20–25 O157 Sakai contains at least 19 non-LEE encoded effectors or their homologues. Among these, nleA (also named espI, ECs1812), an nleF-homologue (ECs1815), an nleG-homologue (ECs1828) and an nleH-homologue (ECs1814) were variably present among the eight O157 strains. Functions of these effectors have not been well elucidated, but it has been shown that NleA/EspI injected into the host cell localizes to the Golgi apparatus.24Many virulence-related genes were also encoded on the pO157 plasmid, but all were conserved except for katP (pO157_76). Of interest was that 18 out of the 83 genes on pO157 were missing in Strain #2 (Fig. 1). Since the pO157 plasmid of #2 is almost the same in size as those from other strains (data not shown), several parts of the plasmid have probably been replaced by different or highly divergent sequences. pOSAK1, a small cryptic plasmid, was present only in two strains.3.4. Comparison of two datasets obtained by microarray and WGPScanning analysesThe CGH analysis using microarray provides the information on the gene composition but not their genomic positions, thus translocation events specific to the test strain cannot be detected. It also provides no information on strain-specific insertions. Conversely, WGPScanning detects possible loci where such genetic events have taken place while the presence or absence of each gene cannot be determined. Therefore, in order to know more details on the genomic diversity of O157, we compared the two datasets, one from the present microarray analysis and the other from the previous WGPScanning8 (Fig. 1).In the segments that exhibited no size variation in the WGPScanning analysis (indicated in gray in Fig. 1), no deletion of genes was detected by microarray except for only five segments. This confirmed that these regions possess the same genomic structures as those in Sakai. Among the five segments where deletions of a gene(s) were observed, four were derived from lambda-like prophage regions, implying that some parts of these prophages have been replaced by DNA fragments with same sizes but with different or highly divergent sequences.By the WGPScanning analysis, a total of 35 segments with larger size reduction (≥2 kb smaller than that of O157 Sakai) were identified from the 8 O157 strains (indicated in yellow in Fig. 1). In most cases (29 segments), deleted genes were identified. The regions with gene deletion, however, were often associated with repeated genes derived from IS elements or lambda-like prophages, and thus precise boundaries of the deletion events were not defined in many cases. In six segments, no apparent gene deletion was detected, indicating that several genes on these segments have probably translocated to other genomic loci.Among the 60 segments with smaller size reduction (<2 kb), which were indicated in light yellow in Fig. 1, we detected deletion of a gene(s) only in seven segments by the microarray analysis. Most of the segments with undetectable deletions (50 out of 53) contained IS elements and/or parts of lambda-like prophages, indicating that small deletions involving these elements frequently occur on O157 genomes. In the remaining three segments, small deletions in the regions that were not represented by probes or some translocations have probably taken place.Besides the above-mentioned genomic segments that apparently contain deletions, 20 loci have been identified by the WGPScanning analysis, where prophages or prophage-like elements are integrated in Sakai but deleted (or not integrated) in some other strains (indicated by blank in Fig. 1). These loci were classified into three groups according to the patterns of gene conservation observed in the microarray analysis. The first group included the Sp7 region of strain #2, Sp13 (P2-like phage) of strains #3 and #9, and Sp18 (Mu-like phage) of strains #2, #3, #5, #6, #7, #8 and #9. In these regions, all or nearly all genes were absent. We concluded that these genetic elements are completely missing in these strains. The second group included the Sp18 region of strain #4 and SpLE1 of strain #6. In both cases, most genes on the elements were conserved, indicating that a prophage or prophage-like element almost identical to Sp18 or SpLE1 is present in other locus. We have already identified alternative integration sites for each element (Fig. 1). The third group included the Sp5 region of strains #2, #3, #4, #6, #7 and #8, Sp1/Sp2 of strain #8 and Sp7 of strain #3. In these regions, genes were partially conserved, exhibiting mosaic conservation patterns. This indicates that these strains contain, in some other loci, prophages which are significantly diverged but with some structural similarity to Sp5, Sp1/Sp2 or Sp7. Of particular interest was Sp5, the Stx2 phage of O157 Sakai. The Sp5 region was one of the regions with the highest level of variation, and we have already identified the alternative integration sites for the Stx2 phages in these six strains (Fig. 1). These Stx2 phages are thus different from Sp5 not only in the integration site but also in the genomic structure.A total of 83 segments yielded PCR products larger than those of Sakai in the WGPScanning analysis as shown in Fig. 1, where the segments with larger increments (≥2 kb) are indicated in blue, and those with smaller increments (<2 kb) in light blue. These segments must contain some insertions. In addition, as many as 120 segments were not amplified by PCR (indicated in red in Fig. 1), in which large insertions or some other types of large genomic rearrangements likely have taken place. In these cases, if all genes on a segment were conserved, the segment most likely contains a simple insertion. By comparing the two datasets, 66 such segments were identified. Among these, we have identified seven new phage integration sites including those for Stx1 and Stx2 phages (Fig. 1). In other cases, more complicated genetic events must have occurred.3.5. Unusual signal reductions around the IS insertion sitesDuring the data comparison of microarray and WGPScanning analysis, we noticed that somewhat unusual signal reductions occurred in the ETT2 region. In strains #2, #4 and #7, the region yielded larger PCR products, but a block of genes were judged as absent in the microarray analysis. Sequencing analyses of these regions, however, indicated that all genes were completely conserved but one copy of ISEc8 was newly inserted in each strain. A closer inspection of the microarray data revealed that, although the ISEc8 insertion sites were different between the strains, the genes judged as absent were all located in the 2–4 kb regions surrounding each ISEc8, and that their signal ratios were just slightly lower than the cutoff value (Fig. 2). This phenomenon was specific to the ETT2 region, and observed even after the labeled DNA was fragmented by sonication. Although we do not know the mechanism underlying this phenomenon, some caution is required to interpret the microarray data when a block of genes exhibit a moderate level of signal reduction.Unusual signal reduction associated with insertions of ISEc8. Distribution of signal ratios (relative to O157 Sakai) from the probes representing the ETT2 regions of strains #2, #4, #7 and #8 is shown. Genes in the ETT2 region (ECs3703–3737) are depicted by black arrows, and genes on ISEc8 newly inserted in strains #2, #4 and #7 by gray arrows. Positions of each gene and probe are drawn to the O157 Sakai genome sequence. Horizontal broken lines indicate cutoff lines for the presence or absence determination in each strain. We have confirmed that all the probe sequences exhibiting unusual signal reduction are identical to those of Sakai. As seen in strain #8, no signal reduction was observed in other strains without ISEc8-insertion.Unusual signal reduction associated with insertions of ISEc8.

DiscussionPresence of an unexpectedly high degree of structural diversity in O157 genomes has been revealed by our previous analysis using the WGPScanning method.8 The results also suggested that the major factor generating such diversity is the variation of prophages and prophage-like elements. However, it remained to be elucidated how the genomic diversity detected by WGPScanning affects the gene content of each strain. In order to know the variation of their gene composition, we constructed an oligoDNA microarray according to the genome sequence of O157 Sakai,10 and performed the CGH analysis of the same set of O157 strains as examined by the WGPScanning.By this analysis, we identified 431 VAP genes that were variably present in the 8 O157 strains, and found that most of them were on S-loops, particularly on the prophage regions. This indicates that a remarkable level of variation in the gene repertoire exist among the O157 strains, and confirms the role of bacteriophages as the key players in the genome diversification of O157. Very recently, Wick et al.26 have reported the results of CGH analyses of several types of O157 strains and its close relatives, including typical O157:H7 strains (GUD−, SOR−), atypical O157:H7 strains (GUD+, SOR−), O157:H− German clones (GUD+, SOR+) and O55:H7 strains (the closest relatives of O157:H727). They used a multigenome array containing 50 mer oligonucleotide probes that target 6176 ORFs on the chromosomes of K-12, O157 EDL933 and O157 Sakai. By this analysis, they identified the Sakai and K-12 genes that were gained or lost during the emergence of O157:H7 from its O55:H7-like ancestor. Many of these genes were parts of prophages and prophage-like elements, suggesting complex histories of these elements during the evolution of O15726. What we should emphasize here is, however, that all O157 strains but strain #2 examined in our present study belonged to the typical O157 group. Even if the 89 genes that were absent only in strain #2 were excluded, 350 genes still exhibited variable distribution. This indicates that there is a remarkable variation in gene content even among typical O157 strains.Identification of these VAP genes is of medical importance in that they could be used as valuable genetic markers to discriminate O157 strains. For example, a mini-DNA chip featuring these genes would become a useful molecular tool for epidemiological studies of O157. Of more importance may be that the VAP genes include a considerable number of virulence-related genes. Although the variation of stx1 and stx2 genes among O157 strains is known, additional 14 potentially virulence-related genes were found to display variable distributions. They include four non-LEE TTSS effectors, indicating that, although the LEE locus encoding the TTS machinery is highly conserved, the repertoire of its effectors differs significantly among O157 strains. Some metabolic genes, such as those for urease production (ECs1321–1326) and iron acquisition (ECs1693–1699), which may be indirectly involved in the pathogenesis of O157, were also found to be variably present. These data raise a possibility that some variation in the potential virulence and infectivity exists among O157 strains, and we need to analyze more O157 strains from various sources, including environmental isolates.The phylogenetic position of strain #2 in the O157 lineage is somewhat obscure. But, since weak β-glucuronidase activity was detected after long cultivation, the strain may belong to the GUD+ O157:H7 group. The largest number of VAP genes was detected in this strain, and it shared many, if not all, features that Wick et al.26 described as being specific to GUD+ strains. For example, several gene blocks, such as ECs4134–4139, ECs1611–1619 and ECs3860–3861, were deleted (or highly divergent) only in this strain. The gene content on the pO157 plasmid of strain #2 also differed significantly from other strains. Unfortunately Wick et al.26 did not examine the pO157 genes, but the difference in pO157 may be another genomic feature that discriminates the GUD+ group from typical O157 : H7 strains.In the present study, we examined the same set of O157 strains as that were analyzed previously by the WGPScanning method. This provided a good opportunity to compare the data obtained by the two methods (Fig. 1). Although the microarray is now widely used as a major tool in comparative genomics, a fine comparison of the two datasets rather highlighted the weakness of microarray and emphasized the usefulness of a combinational approach with WGPScanning. Microarray actually provided valuable genome-wide information on the genome composition in each test strain, but almost no information on strain-specific insertions and translocations. In the case of O157, particular cautions are required in interpreting the microarray data because of the presence of same or very similar prophages as well as many IS elements. Even with such difficulties, all simple insertions as well as many translocations and replacements have been identified by comparing the two datasets. This approach also identified many small deletions that could not be detected by microarray alone. IS elements were frequently associated with such small deletions, suggesting that IS elements may be another key player to diversify O157 genomes. The combinational use of microarray and WGPScanning overcame the weakness of each method alone, and provided us more details and thus a much complex view on the genomic diversity of O157 strains.The variation of prophages among O157 strains was not fully illustrated even with this combinational approach. But, as most strikingly shown for the Stx2-transducing phages, the data clearly indicated that prophages of O157 exhibit an extremely high level of strain-to-strain variations. These variations appeared to have been generated not only by simple insertion, deletion or translocation of prophages but also by more complex genetic events involving local recombination and deletion of prophage segments. One such example has been documented by Shaikh and Tarr28 in the prophages integrated into the yehV locus (corresponding to Sp15, the Stx1-transducing phage of O157 Sakai). Of importance again is that most of the strains examined here were typical O157 : H7 strains. This indicates that such dynamic turnover of prophages is still actively taking place, and as we have proposed previously, O157 strains are functioning as a kind of ‘phage factory’, releasing a variety of new recombinant bacteriophages into the environment.6 This process should be significantly involved in the generation of variable gene contents of O157 strains detected by the CGH analysis.This work was supported by Research for the Future Program funded by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS-RFTF00L01411), Grant-in-Aids for Scientific Research on Priority Areas and the 21st Century COE (Centers of Excellence) Program (Life Science) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan and a grant from the Yakult Foundation.

IntroductionChlamydiae are obligate intracellular eubacterial pathogens, including two genera and nine species based on ribosomal RNA gene sequences.1 The genus Chlamydia includes a human conjunctivitis and sexually transmitted disease agent, C. trachomatis, a mouse pneumonia agent, Chlamydia muridarum and a pig pneumonia agent, Chlamydia suis. The other genus, Chlamydophila, includes a human pneumonia agent, C. pneumoniae and the animal disease or zoonosis agents, Chlamydophila psittaci, Chlamydophila caviae, Chlamydophila pecorum, Chlamydophila abortus and Chlamydophila felis, which infect birds, hamsters, cows, sheep and cats, respectively. The genomic DNA sequences of Chlamydiaceae have been published for five species, C. trachomatis,2,C. muridarum,3,C. pneumoniae,3–5,C. caviae,6 and C. abortus.7Chlamydophila felis strain Fe/C-56, of which the whole genome DNA sequence has been determined in this study, is a frequent cause of infection in cats, largely causing conjunctivitis8 as well as pneumonitis.9 Seroepidemiological studies have shown that C. felis is widely spread among cats with prevalence rates of anti-C. felis Fe/Pn1 antibody in ≈50% of street cats and ≈20% of domestic cats and in 1.7% of the general human population and 8.8% of veterinarians in small animal clinics in Japan.10 Although C. felis is a common pathogen in both humans and animals, the infection is rarely identified in humans.11,12 Seroepidemiological data reveals, however, that the infection in humans may be more frequent and are most likely acquired from infected cats.10,13 This suggests that the feline chlamydiosis is widely transmitted to humans when in close contact with infected cats, but it rarely causes any serious illness in humans. In contrast, infection of a taxonomically close chlamydial species, C. pneumoniae, is very frequent in human and is sometimes associated with a serious illness. Moreover, at extremely high frequencies of detection and culturing from atherosclerotic plaques, C. pneumoniae is suspected to involve the development of atherosclerosis.14 The C. felis genome sequence and the comparative analysis with other chlamydial species will be of importance to investigate the genes relating to their pathogenicity in humans, tropisms in hosts and disease prevention as well as the evolution and intracellular parasitism.Herein, we determined the complete sequence of C. felis genome and present the comparative analyses with other Chlamydia genome DNA sequences, especially to that of C. pneumoniae.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Strain and culturingChlamydophila felis Japanese strain Fe/C-56 was originally isolated from conjunctival mucus of an infected 5-year-old female cat.8 The genomic DNA for sequencing was prepared from C. felis elementary bodies in the culture medium of the fourth passage with McCoy cells, following five passages with fertile hens' eggs. Chlamydial culturing and detection were performed as described previously.15 The nomenclature Chlamydophila felis is in dispute, but it is used here instead of the formerly used ‘a cat pneumonitis agent of Chlamydia psittaci’.12.2. DNA sequencing, assembling and gene predictionThe DNA sequencing was performed by a method using the whole genome shotgun.16 The total 24 194 sequence reads gave an 11-fold coverage as average. The sequences were assembled and edited using the Phred/Phrap/Consed package software (University of Washington).17 Protein-coding genes were first predicted using the combination of three programs, GenomeGambler,18 GeneHacker plus19 and Glimmer2.0,20 and at last manually determined. Annotation for each genes was carried out by using programs BLASTP21 and FASTA322 against the non-redundant protein database. Transmembrane protein and tRNA genes were predicted using SOSUI23 and tRNAscan-SE,24 respectively. Putative inc genes werepredicted by informatics analysis using hydropathy.25,262.3. Data analysisC. pneumoniae J138 genomic DNA sequence4 was used for intra-genus comparative analyses. Genomic DNA sequences of other C. pneumoniae strains,3,5,C. trachomatis2 and C. muridarum3 were used for inter-genera comparisons. C. caviae6 and C. abortus7 were used for analysis within evolutionarily closed species. The gene annotation was performed by homology search using FASTA3,22 in which the similarity with the expectation values <10−4 was defined significant. Two genes conserved most reciprocally in two different organisms were assigned as orthologous genes using FASTA3. Classification of C. felis genes into Bacteria, Eucarya or Archaea is carried out based on no chlamydial orthologues, described previously.27 The genes which were categorized into Eucarya and Archaea were confirmed by phylogenetic analyses using CLUSTALW.28 The detail results for gene annotation, classification, gene divergence patterns and gene content comparisons are available in the Supplementary Tables 1–5 are available at Author Webpage. The sequences in this paper have been deposited in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank database (accession; chromosome, AP006861, plasmid, AP006862).4. Results and Discussion4.1. Genome structureThe Chlamydophila felis Fe/C-56 contains a circular chromosome consisting of 1 166 239 bp and 1005 protein-coding genes (Table 1). The C. felis also harbors a 7552 bp plasmid, pCfe1, with eight genes and the copy number of the plasmid per chromosome is approximately 4.5 (Table 1). The overall G+C contents are 39.4 and 33.9% for the chromosome and plasmid, respectively. The G+C content and gene density appear to be uniform in the genome (Fig. 1). The putative replication origin (Ori) of the chromosome was determined based on comparisons with other chlamydial predicted Ori sequences, the GC skew and the assumed DnaA binding sequences. The replication terminal was determined at a maximum point, 583 kb from the Ori, in a curve of the cumulative GC skew.29 There is no strong correlation between the directions of transcription and replication, except from the 880 kb position to the Ori observed slightly positive association. Many of the essential genes for transcription, translation and replication are located in a large region around the Ori.5Circular exhibition of the Chlamydophila felis Fe/C-56 genome.

Plasticity zoneTo figure out C. felis Fe/C-56 genome characteristics, genome structure and gene contents of C. felis were compared with those of C. pneumoniae J138.4 Although C. felis and C. pneumoniae relatively diverged far from each other, the two species share 879 orthologous genes and overall high synteny is exhibited, except a region surrounding the Ter, termed the plasticity zone.3,30 Synteny of the orthologous genes between C. felis and C. pneumoniae are displayed in a concentric presentation (Fig. 2A). In this report, C. felis plasticity zone was assigned from 491 to 596 kb (CF0398-0484: 87 genes) including the Ter region.6 In the C. felis plasticity zone, C. felis genes without C. pneumoniae J138 orthologues (C. felis no-C.pn-genes) are enriched with up to 30 genes out of the total 126 C. felis no-C.pn-genes on the chromosome (Fig. 2B). While 48 genes are functionally annotated out of 87 genes in the plasticity zone, C. felis no-C.pn-genes are 14 out of the 48 genes. The ratio (14:48) is much higher than the one in the C. felis chromosome (46:684). Most of the annotated genes in C. felis are conserved in some other organisms and thus the annotated no-C.pn-genes are thought to have dropped out of C. pneumoniae genome.3,6Analyses of the orthologous genes between Chlamydophila felis and Chlamydophila pneumoniae J138.

Frequently gene-translocated regions (FGRs)When two orthologous genes between C. felis and C. pneumoniae J138 are linked on whole chromosomes shown with two concentric circles, segmental genome translocations are observed as sheaves of parallel lines horizontally crossing the origin-terminal axis between C. felis and C. pneumoniae (Fig. 2A). The regions with translocated genes in the C. felis genome are from 355 to 359 kb (CP0307-311) and from 759 to 878 kb (CP0654-0739, 86 genes), ones in C. pneumoniae J138 genome are from 1200 to 87 kb (Cpj1051-0072, connected at the termini of the genomic sequence) and from 485 to 550 kb (Cpj439-474) (Fig. 2C). The regions, termed frequently gene-translocated regions (FGRs) here, seems to have been formed by the genomic inversion events across the whole genome with the replication terminal region. When Chlamydophila felis genome is compared with Chlamydia trachomatis one, the same phenomenon for the gene translocation is observed in similar regions but the translocation between C. felis and C. trachomatis is more frequent than one between C. felis and C. pneumoniae (data not shown). The FGRs, which include the region reported as a hyper variable region31 or tmh/Inc locus,7 exhibit distinctive characteristics of the plasticity zone or the other regions of genome; (i) Out of 49 polymorphic outer membrane proteins genes omp/pmp (described below) in the C. felis chromosome, 22 omp/pmp genes are in the FGRs, whereas interestingly the plasticity zone contains no omp/pmp (Fig. 2B). (ii) Total 22 omp/pmp genes are conserved in C. pneumoniae J138, but in the FGRs only eight out of the 22 omp/pmp are conserved (P < 0.01). (iii) The omp/pmp and hypothetical genes are tandemly localized in the FGRs and seven repetitive sequences in C. pneumoniae genome contain omp/pmp genes, however C. felis genome lacks such repetitive sequences31 (Fig. 2C). (iv) C. felis no-C.pn-genes are enriched (27 genes) in the FGRs similarly to the plasticity zone. But ratio of annotated C. felis no-C.pn-genes per annotated genes in the FGRs (2:57) is almost equal to the one in the whole chromosome (30:684), when the omp/pmp genes are excluded from the annotated genes. (v) Of the 66 total inc genes (described below), 16 inc genes are enriched in the plasticity zone (P < 0.01) but only 6 in the FGRs (P = 0.5).Those characteristics implicate that the FGRs may assume a role for the multiplication of the omp/pmp genes rather than for genome reduction and inc genes may be on the verge of gene loss in the plasticity zone. Relationship between the gene translocation (or genome inversion) and gene multiplication are unknown, however it should be noted here that chlamydial genomes conserve an almost complete set of DNA recombination, repair genes and tRNA genes located in or near FGRs may be involved in the inversion fashion32 (Fig. 2C). The characteristics observed in the FGRs of C. felis and C. pneumoniae are detected as well as in the FGRs of C. trachomatis.4.4. Comparison within the family ChlamydiaceaeFour Chlamydiaceae species, i.e., C. felis, C. pneumoniae (three strains),3–5,C. trachomatis2 and C. muridarum3 share 795 common genes (Fig. 3A), 104 genes are specific to C. felis. Adding, C. caviae6 and C. abortus,7 formerly belonging to C. psittaci as strains, to this analysis, 47 genes are specific to C. felis including an extra adenylate kinase gene (CF265) and 8 polymorphic outer membrane protein genes (CF379, 380, 718, 719, 723, 724, 728, 735).Orthologue comparison within the family Chlamydiaceae.

(A) Numbers of orthologous and species specific genes represented in Venn diagrams, using Chlamydophila felis (this work), C. pneumoniae J138, AR39 and CWL029,3,5,Chlamydia trachomatis2 and C. muridarum.3 (B) Divergence pattern for all orthologous gene sets, except two, CF0973 and CF0599. (C) A schematic branching pattern for an orthologous gene set showing C. felis-specific evolution. Based on the multiple alignment and phylogenic analysis of orthologues using CLUSTALW,28 divergent distance is calculated as a branch length for an orthologous gene of each species. Genes are chosen for C. felis when the length of C. felis branch is longer than one of any other branch. (D) Numbers of genes exhibiting species specific evolution for C. felis, C. pneumoniae and C. trachomatis within the common 795 genes in Fig 3A.All of the orthologue sets, except two, surprisingly illustrate the similar phylogenetic patterns, in which the genes from the C. felis and C. pneumoniae and those from C. trachomatis and C. muridarum, are closest (Fig. 3B). The two exceptional genes, CF0973 and CF0599, are too highly conserved to statistically draw relevant phylogenetic trees. Thus, no inter-genus gene exchanges are detected during the chlamydial species establishment in this method.Regardless of the same phylogenetic pattern illustrated with orthologue sets, the lengths of C. felis divergence branches among the phylogenetic trees varied. To figure out C. felis genes which accumulate mutations more than the orthologous genes, the gene categorization was carried out using the definition that in the phylogenetic tree with C. felis, C. pneumoniae and C. trachomatis, a branch of C. felis gene from the divergent point is longest amongst three branches (Fig. 3C). Similar categorization was used for C. pneumoniae and C. trachomatis (Fig. 3D). Fourteen C. felis genes, such as four hypothetical genes (CF0008, CF0256, CF0470, CF0615), six genes encoding nucleic acid associating proteins (CF0085, CF0313, CF0899, CF0909, CF0925, CF0947) and four genes encoding membrane proteins including IncB (CF0032, CF0329, CF0415, CF0516) are categorized here as genes on faster evolution, implicating that these genes may be devoted for adaptation to the niche of C. felis.Gene variation of tryptophan biosynthesis is one of the most remarkable features in the comparison of chlamydial gene repertories. C. trachomatis and C. pneumoniae, worldwide common parasites to humans but not to animals, contain partial and no tryptophan biosynthesis genes in the genomes, respectively. On the other hand, the genomes of the animal pathogens, C. felis and C. caviae, surprisingly not C. abortus, conserve the tryptophan operon consisting of trpA, B, F, C, D and R and related genes, kynU (CF0435-CF0440 and CF0434, respectively) are conserved.6,7,33 Tryptophan depletion by IFN-γ is thought as a crucial host defense mechanism against chlamydiae. On the contrary the chlamydial tryptophan biosynthesis gene is thought to be directly involved in chlamydial resistance against IFN-γ.3,5,34 IFN-γ treatment of host cells was performed to show how susceptible C. felis is against IFN-γ comparing with other chlamydial species without a complete tryptophan synthesis pathway. Neither inhibition of inclusion body formation nor reduction in the size of inclusion bodies on average were observed for C. felis in the tests with concentrations of up to 10 ng/ml of human IFN-γ, while both the infection and growth of C. pneumoniae J38 and C. trachomatis were reduced under the same experimental conditions.34 Tryptophan might play a key role for the molecular basis of host–parasite interaction in terms of IFN-γ resistance, the gene repertories of tryptophan biosynthesis cannot explain all about host tropisms of individual chlamydial species. However, tryptophan utilization evokes all evolutional relationships between host defense and parasite infection, leading to chlamydial host and tissue tropisms.4.5. Horizontal gene transferOne of most interesting characteristics of chlamydial genome constituents is that a few percentages of the total genes are similar to genes of taxonomical distinctive organisms.2,35 To figure out such genes in the C. felis genome, sequence-based gene classification was performed as a screening of the horizontal gene transfer from non-chlamydial organisms to the C. felis genome. Of the total of 1005 protein-coding genes of C. felis, 537, 59 and 5 genes may be derived from bacterial, eukaryotic and archaeal origins, respectively (Fig. 1). The numbers of chlamydial specific and ambiguous genes are 323 and 81, respectively. All the eukaryotic and archaeal origin genes in C. felis, except CF0874, are conserved and exhibit synteny in C. pneumoniae, C. trachomatis and C. muridarum. Based on phylogenetic analysis, the CF0874 coding a pyrimidine metabolism enzyme, orotate phosphoribosyl transferase, is seemed to be lost from C. trachomatis and C. muridarum. It is possible that the eukaryotic and archaeal genes in C. felis were laterally transferred before the genera divergence.2 However, no further proof such as different G+C contents or genome structures is observed to show that the genes have been derived from taxonomical distinctive organisms.4.6. PlasmidChlamydophila felis and many other chlamydial species carry a plasmid, pCf01, similar to other chlamydial plasmids.36 Interestingly, two genes, pCf07 and pCf08, on the plasmid exhibit high similarities to CF0055 and CF0056 on C. felis chromosome, respectively. The CF0056 and pCf08 gene products show significant similarities to parA and minD gene products conserved widely among bacterial genomes. The phylogenetic analysis of the parA/minD family has illustrated that the chlamydial chromosome and plasmid genes form independent groups, both of which are separated from the other bacterial genes. Moreover, the divergent patterns in each chlamydial group are analogous (Fig. 4). It implies that the chlamydial plasmid had already been presented in an ancient chlamydia before the two genera divergence and that no intra-genus plasmid exchanges and no parA/minD gene exchanges between the chromosome and plasmid occurred after the divergence.Phylogenetic tree of parA/minD genes. The parA/minD genes used here are for chlamydial chromosome; Chlamydophila pneumoniae J138 (Accession: AP002548-9), Chlamydophila felis Fe/C-56 (CF0056), Chlamydophila caviae GPIC (AE016997-167), Chlamydia muridarum (AE002353-7) and Chlamydia trachomatis D/UW-3/CX (AE001329-1) and plasmid; Chlamydophila pneumoniae N16 pCpnE1 (X82078-9), Chlamydophila felis Fe/C-56 pCfe1 (pCf08), Chlamydophila caviae GPIC pCpA1 (AE016997-168), Chlamydia muridarum pMoPn (AE002162-6) and Chlamydia trachomatis pCHL1 (J03321-7) and for other bacterial genes; Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1 (AL935261-129), Treponema pallidum Nichols (AE001208-8), Bacillus subtilis168 (Z99124-191), Listeria monocytogenes EGD-e (AL591984-146), Vibrio parahaemolyticus O3:K6 (AP005076-8), Vibrio cholerae N16961 (AE004271-9), Buchnera aphidicola Sg (Schizaphisgraminum) (AE014108-5), Buchnera aphidicola APS (Acyrthosiphon pisum) (AP001119-13), Yersinia pestis CO92 (AJ414151-83), Salmonella enterica Typhi (AL627272-29) and Escherichia coli K12 (AE000216-6).Phylogenetic tree of parA/minD genes.

Inclusion membrane proteins (Incs)Two hundred and sixty five genes in the C. felis genome contain transmembrane domain(s). The ratio of the number of transmembrane genes per the total number of genes in C. felis agrees with the finding in most bacteria,37 but the distribution of the number of transmembrane domains is different from non-chlamydial bacteria. Noticeably, C. felis contains 75 genes coding two transmembrane domains, which is twice as many as some non-chlamydial bacteria. Informatics analysis25 has revealed a total of 63 putative inc genes in the 75 genes. In addition, three more genes similar to eukaryotic myosin heavy chain genes have been classified as inc because four other genes partially similar to myosin heavy chain genes are categorized into the putative inc genes and two myosin heavy chain like protein of the C. pneumoniae J138 were experimentally shown to localize on inclusion bodies (data not shown). However, the functions of Inc proteins are still largely unknown. Forty-six putative inc genes are identified by the same method for C. felis inc identification in the genome of Parachlamydia amoebophila UWE25, which is diverged at about 700 million years ago from the last common ancestor with the family Chlamydiaceae38 (data not shown). It indicates that before the divergence of the two chlamydial families, inc gene family has already expanded in the common ancestor genome.4.8. Polymorphism membrane proteins (PMPs)The omp/pmp genes, which encode outer membrane proteins or polymorphic membrane proteins, compose the most important and characteristic gene family in chlamydia. OMP/PMPs are reported to conserve N-terminal repeat motives, GGAI (or variants) and FXXN and terminate in a phenylanine residue.4,7,39 In chlamydial genomes such as C. pneumoniae strains, C. trachomatis, C. muridarum, C. caviae and C. abortus, 18, 21, 9, 9, 17 and 18 omp/pmp genes are identified, respectively.2–7 FASTA analysis with the all chlamydial omp/pmp genes reveals that in the C. felis genome 39 genes are similar to omp/pmp genes. Of the 39 putative omp/pmp genes, 18 genes (CF0209, CF0379, CF0721, CF0722, CF0725-CF0732, CF0735-CF0737, CF0801, CF0802, CF0992) conserve the N-terminal repeat motives and phenylanine at C-termini and 4 (CF0380, CF0719, CF0723, CF0733) and 6 (CF0101, CF0525, CF0720, CF0724, CF0734, CF0958) genes conserve only the N-terminal repeat motives or phenylanine at C-termini, respectively. No-C. felis genes are identified as new omp/pmp genes by the motif analysis. Gene expression of those genes and utilization of the gene products should be tested further.5. ConclusionsHere we exhibit genome analyses of a worldwide spread pathogen for pneumonia9 and conjunctivitis8 in cats, Chlamydophila felis (Chlamydia psittaci feline pneumonitis agent). C. felis infection is rarely identified in humans while a few were reported,11,12 but seroepidemiological study revealed that the prevalence rates of anti-C. felis Fe/Pn1 antibodies (1.7% and 8.8% for the general human population and veterinarians in small animal clinics in Japan, respectively) are rather higher than expected.10 Thus the genome data of C. felis must be a useful tool to understand chlamydial tropism and pathogenicities, or to aid in the detection and prevention of C. felis causing diseases in both human and animals.We thank A.

Introduction Ascidians hold a unique position in the evolution of the animal kingdom. Ascidians were the first chordates, having developed a notochord and dorsal nervous system. As such, ascidians have attracted the attention of developmental biologists as a model system for studying the body planning principles employed by chordates, including vertebrates and humans. 1 , 2 A draft genome sequence of Ciona intestinalis , a ubiquitous species of ascidian used by researchers world-wide, has been prepared, and 15 852 protein-coding genes have been predicted from the euchromatic region of the genome. 3 Extensive cDNA/EST studies also have been carried out with C. intestinalis . 4 These have focused primarily on the various developmental stages of C. intestinalis , including fertilized eggs, 5 cleavage-stage embryos, 6 gastrulae and neurulae, tailbud embryos 7 and tadpole larvae. 8 The total number of ESTs has reached 454 861, assembled into 20 616 independent clusters. Gene expression profiles of the above-mentioned embryonic stages have been analyzed by means of whole-mount in situ hybridization (WISH). 5–8 The developmental stage following fertilization covers only a short period of 1–2 days in the life cycle of C. intestinalis . Following metamorphosis on days 3–4, the animal begins to feed and grow. By 2–3 weeks several adult organs have formed, including the neural complex, body-wall muscle, heart, endostyle, pharyngeal gill slits, esophagus, stomach, intestine and gonads. 9 The animal then matures and survives for another 3–4 months. A cDNA/EST study and gene expression profiling using WISH have been performed on young adult C. intestinalis10 and several endostyle-specific genes have been characterized. 11 Immunity is an important biological function that is generated and mobilized as the animal reaches adulthood. Hemocytes play a central role in immune function. Although hemocytes originate in the trunk lateral cells of the tailbud embryo in the case of Halocynthia roretzi , another species of ascidian, they are first detected morphologically at the larval stage. 12 During or after metamorphosis, hemocytes proliferate significantly.  Ascidians have only an innate type of immunity, rather than an adaptive-type, to protect themselves against foreign invaders. 13 The innate immunity of ascidians has been examined using mainly Halocynthia and Styela and is considered a prototype of that found in vertebrates. 14–18,C. intestinalis hemocytes also phagocytose foreign materials. 19 Based on the assumption that C. intestinalis hemocytes serve as a model for studying the innate immunity, we so far reported on the gene expression profiles of the cells. First, we performed a cDNA/EST study of hemocytes' transcripts and identified 62 host defense-related clusters from 3357 ESTs. 20 Out of them, 79 newly identified cDNAs were fully sequenced. 21 We subsequently increased the number of cDNAs (ESTs) to 28 355 (56 709) and identified among them 2 hemocyte marker genes, von-Willebrand factor A-like and complement 6-like . 22 In parallel, we surveyed the C. intestinalis genome and detected many immune system-related genes. 23 In this study, we have tried to identify as many transcripts as possible that are expressed specifically in C. intestinalis hemocytes, using the large amount of EST information and large-scale WISH. We have followed the expression of the identified genes during the entire C. intestinalis life cycle by extracting corresponding transcripts from a microarray dataset, providing a broad view of hemocyte-specific genes in C. intestinalis . 2. Materials and Methods2.1. Biological materials Adult C. intestinalis was maintained under constant light to induce oocyte maturation. Eggs and sperm were collected by dissecting gonads and inseminated artificially. The fertilized eggs were cultured at 20°C and larvae hatched ∼14 h later. After metamorphosis, juveniles that adhered to trays were cultured with the diatom Chaetoceros gracillis as their food source. They were fed every 2 days and the seawater was changed every 2 days. Adult C. intestinalis survived up to 4 months. 2.2. WISH Two-week-old young adults were used as the material, since they are of adequate size for WISH and have all types of adult tissue. The organisms were starved for 3 days to evacuate food waste and harvested. Relaxation and fixation of specimens were as described previously. 24 The cDNA clones were chosen from a cDNA resource of C. intestinalis , 25 and the insert sequence with the T7 promoter was amplified by PCR. Digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled RNA probes were synthesized using T7 RNA polymerase and the cDNA sequences as the templates. 24 Large-scale WISH using InSitu Chips was as described. 26 Preparation and WISH of adult hemocytes were performed as described. 272.3. Double-colored WISHThe procedure for double-colored WISH was the same as for single-colored WISH except that the DIG- and biotin-labeled RNA probes were prepared, mixed and used for hybridization. The biotin signal was detected as green fluorescence using the TSA Biotin System (PerkinElmer, Boston, MA) and streptavidin-FITC. The DIG signal was detected as red fluorescence (HNP/FastRed TR) with an HNPP Fluorescent Detection Set (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). An Olympus BX51-33-FL2 fluorescence microscope equipped with a Pixera pro 150ES camera was used for the photography.2.4. Microarray analysis To prepare total RNA from developing C. intestinalis embryos, the acid guanidine thiocyanate-phenol/chloroform method was used. 28 For adult RNA preparation, whole bodies were homogenized in a solution containing 4 M guanidine thiocyanate, 1% (v/v) mercaptoethanol, 50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mM EDTA and 0.5% (w/v) N -lauroylsarcosinate. The homogenate was ultracentrifuged through a cesium trifluoroacetate gradient. Poly(A) + RNA was purified using an mRNA Purification Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). Its quality was tested with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). Two microgram each of poly(A) + RNA was labeled with either Cy3 or Cy5 using an Agilent Fluorescent Linear Amplification Kit (Agilent Technologies), mixed together and hybridized to the Ciona 22K Custom Oligo DNA Microarray loaded with 21 938 probes. 29 Hybridization and washing protocols were according to the manufacturer's instructions. The microarrays were scanned with a GenePix4000B DNA Microarray Scanner (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). For image analysis, normalization and data extraction, GenePix Pro4.0 Microarray Analysis Software (Axon Instruments) and GeneSpring Software (Silicon Genetics, Redwood City, CA) were used. A combination of two different RNA preparations was used for hybridization. For the developing embryos, RNA from fertilized eggs served as a reference sample and RNA from post-egg stages were used as test samples. The developing embryos included 2-, 4-, 8-, 16-, 32- and 64-cell embryos, and early gastrulae, late gastrulae, early neurulae, immediate early tailbuds, early tailbuds, middle tailbuds, late tailbuds, larvae and juveniles. For adults, the RNA combinations were from juveniles and 1.5-month-old adults, from 1.5- to 2.5-month-old adults, and from 2.5- to 4.0-month-old adults. Hybridizations were performed twice, using the same RNA combinations but different dyes. Thus, the average intensity for a given gene was calculated from two independent hybridizations. To draw an expression profile for each gene during the life cycle, the fluorescence intensity obtained from the fertilized eggs served as the reference 1.0, from which relative values could be calculated for each stage of development through adulthood.3. Results3.1. Identification of genes expressed specifically in hemocytes One of the goals of this study was to identify as many transcripts as possible that were expressed specifically in hemocytes. Since hemocytes emerge in young adults as a significant tissue throughout the body, cDNA/ESTs obtained randomly from young adults were examined first. Our previously reported young-adult gene expression profile found 12 230 (24 460) cDNAs (ESTs) and 976 assembled clusters. 10 Since we had not categorized ‘hemocyte’ expression in that report, 10 we carefully re-examined the WISH images of the 976 independent sequences, and found 87 sequences likely to have positive hemocyte staining in the pharyngeal gill. Therefore, these 87 sequences were processed for re-evaluation by WISH.  Furthermore, since the previous report, 10 the numbers of cDNAs (ESTs) and assembled clusters from the young adult had grown to 28 414 (56 828) and 7179, respectively. These clusters were classified into several groups, based on putative function as determined by homology to known genes. For this study 550 clusters categorized as of unknown function were processed for WISH. Of these, 66 clusters were found that were likely to stain positively in hemocytes.  In the recent cDNA/EST study of hemocytes themselves, 28 355 (56 709) cDNAs (ESTs) and 7940 assembled clusters were found. 22 We chose 81 transcripts as candidates for preferential and abundant expression in hemocytes. 22 However, this was based on an in silico comparison of hemocytes' cDNA/ESTs with those from other tissues and/or developmental stages, rather than experimental data.  Therefore, 213 clusters (87 + 66 + 81 − redundant clusters) were rigorously and repeatedly examined by small-scale WISH to confirm the strict specificity of gene expression in hemocytes. Thirty-four such cDNA clones eventually were obtained. Among them 03435 and 10410 had been demonstrated as hemocytes' markers in our previous report, 22 and the remaining 32 genes were newly identified as hemocytes-specific transcripts. Figure 1 illustrates examples of WISH images corresponding to eight genes from the whole body (upper rows) and the pharyngeal gill (lower rows). Only hemocytes inside the vessels stained strongly and specifically.

The blue color indicates positive staining of hemocytes. The lower rows are enlarged views of pharyngeal gills where positive-staining hemocytes are detected inside the transverse and longitudinal vessels. Scale bars in the upper and lower rows are 500 and 100 µm, respectively.

Content of genes expressed specifically in hemocytesTable 1 lists 34 genes, along with the identification of clusters, the status of clusters, and the corresponding ESTs. Where a full cDNA insert sequence or an assembled sequence from ESTs was available, attempts were made to predict an open reading frame (ORF), its amino acid sequence and a domain structure in the polypeptide. ORFs were obtained for 25 transcripts, five of which appeared to encode transmembrane proteins. A list of Ciona's hemocytes-specific genes.

For the clusters 02652, 07018, 10250, 15571 and 15627, a corresponding gene was not predicted in the genome browser. Table 1 also includes information on the corresponding gene, as predicted with a genome browser and homologies to the known genes. Eleven clusters showed significant homology to genes with a known motif or a known function. Among them 03435, 10410 and 15640 were homologous to complement component 3b/4b receptor-1 (CR-1, annotated as von Willebrand factor type-A-like previously 22 ), complement 6 (C6) and bactericidal permeability-increasing protein (BPIP), respectively. These three are perhaps immunity related. Each of the remaining eight genes (03474, 04837, 05210, 07063, 10406, 15607, 16828 and 37166) showed homology to various known genes, respectively. On the other hand, the 12 genes encoded hypothetical proteins and the 11 genes exhibited no homologies to known genes. Thus, the 34 genes selected as above were diverse in both sequence and domain architecture. 3.3. Differential expression of identified genes in subsets of hemocytesWhile identifying the above 34 genes by WISH, we noticed that the percentage of positive cells within the hemocyte population varied from gene to gene. Transcripts of some genes were detected in most of the hemocytes and were referred to as major, whereas transcripts of other genes were detected in only a fraction of the hemocytes and were referred to as moderate or minor. The clusters 02671, 07027 and 15584 were examples of major, moderate and minor patterns of expression in hemocytes, respectively. Identified genes were examined to determine whether they were uniformly or differentially expressed in hemocytes. Double-colored WISH was performed with the above mentioned 02671, 07027 and 15584. Row A in Fig. 2 depicts an entire young adult individual in which signals from 02671 and 15584 were from red (HNP/FastRed TR) and green (FITC) fluorescences, respectively. The red fluorescence was detected only within a major population of hemocytes and the green fluorescence was detected only within a minor population of hemocytes, with no overlap. A similar result was obtained with the major transcript 02671 and the moderate transcript 07027. Row B shows the pharyngeal gill. The green fluorescence from 02671 and the red fluorescence from 07027 did not overlap. The yellow fluorescence in Row B likely resulted from endogenous fluorescence since it also was observed in the controls without hybridization. Thus, the expression of each of these three genes in hemocytes appeared to be distinct.  Double-colored WISH images of three distinct gene transcripts. Row A: HNP/FastRed TR (red) and FITC (green) fluorescence indicate the transcripts of 02671 and 15584, respectively. Row B: FITC and HNP/FastRed TR fluorescence indicate the transcripts of 02671 and 07027, respectively. Although in general, the red and green fluorescence did not overlap, a yellow fluorescence was detected. This is likely due to endogenous fluorescence from the cells, as it is observed in the controls without hybridization.

An analysis similar as above was extended to the immunity-related genes. The probes used corresponded to CR-1-like (03435), C6-like (10410) and BPIP-like (15640), respectively. In Fig. 3 , the left two columns represent the pharyngeal gill, whereas the right two columns represent isolated hemocytes. In Row A, green fluorescence of CR-1-like and red fluorescence of C6-like were detected in distinct hemocytes and did not overlap. Similarly, overlap was neither observed between BPIP-like and C6-like (Row B) nor between BPIP-like and CR-1-like (Row C). The result indicates that there are at least three different subsets within the hemocyte population and that each subset expresses a distinct set of genes.

Expression profiles of hemocyte-specific genes in the life cycle of C. intestinalis Since hemocytes are first detected morphologically at the larval stage, emerge during and after metamorphosis and persist in adult C. intestinalis , the expression patterns of hemocyte-specific genes throughout the life cycle were examined. Data were extracted from microarray analyses performed at each stage of development, including adulthood. The expression patterns of hemocyte-specific genes could be categorized into two major groups, as shown in Figure 4 . The expression of gene 15640, BPIP-like , was low or undetectable during early stages of development, became detectable at the late-tailbud stage and reached its maximum level at the juvenile/young-adult stage ( Fig. 4A ). This appeared to parallel the morphological appearance of the hemocytes. The expression of 15640 gradually declined as the adult aged, probably because the percentage of positive hemocytes among the total body cell number decreased with age. The 17 more genes could be categorized as the type of 15640 and they were as follows; 03435 ( CR-1-like ), 10410 ( C6-like ), 02671, 03257, 03268, 03538, 04837, 06033, 06837, 06854, 10250, 10406, 15571, 15584, 15627, 15746 and 16828. Each of them showed somewhat variable but essentially similar patterns with that of 15640.  Representative expression profiles of hemocyte-specific genes in the life cycle of C. intestinalis . The expression patterns of 15640 ( BPIP-like ) and 05210 are plotted throughout the life cycle. The expression levels are relative values based on the egg as 1.0 and plotted on a logarithmic scale. For gene 15640, three different oligonucleotide probes were loaded on the microarray.

A second pattern of expression was seen with the gene 05210 ( Fig. 4B ). It should be noted that gene expression throughout the life cycle was calculated as a relative level, with eggs taken to be 1.0. The actual fluorescence intensity of 05210 was significantly high in eggs (microarray data not shown), probably because 05210 is a maternal gene. Its expression gradually decreased during development, re-emerging at the larva stage, although the peak was less evident. Genes 07063, 09947, 10247, 15607, 15691 and 37166 also followed this pattern of expression. Thus, the seven genes were categorized into this group. The two genes, 02662 and 03474, showed distinct patterns, as compared with the two major categories, and the reason for this is not clear. For remaining genes, either the corresponding probes were not loaded on the microarray chips (5 genes) or the fluorescence intensities were too low to measure (2 genes).3.5. Identification of genes expressed predominantly in hemocytes The survey of the 213 WISH clusters revealed genes that were expressed in hemocytes but were not strictly specific for hemocytes. These were classified tentatively into two groups: type-1 and type-2. The expression of type-1 genes was detected in hemocytes as well as in one other young adult tissue ( Fig. 5A and B ). The genes 02764 and 07623 were expressed in the endostyle and intestine, respectively, as well as in hemocytes. The expression of type-2 genes was detected in multiple organs including hemocytes. The type-2 gene 02021 was expressed in the endostyle and neural complex, as well as in hemocytes (panel C). Nineteen type-1 and 35 type-2 genes were found. Table 2 illustrates in which tissues in addition to hemocytes each of the type-1 and type-2 genes were expressed. These results suggest that, as in other animals, there are multiple machineries in C. intestinalis that direct gene expression in different sets of tissues including hemocytes.

Construction of a data base of C. intestinalis hemocyte transcripts The details of this report have been presented as a C iona i ntestinalis Bloo d D ata B ase (CiBlooDB) ( Author Webpage ) that includes the WISH images as ‘imgs’. For several genes, enlargement of WISH-positive hemocyte images and/or WISH images taken from different angles are available. Each gene listed in the data base is linked to the Ciona cDNA/EST database ( Author Webpage ) and the genome database ( Author Webpage ). 4. Discussion In this study, we have identified as many C. intestinalis hemocyte-specific transcripts as possible. Large-scale WISH of young adult specimens, a technology developed in our laboratory, has proved to be near-ideal for this purpose. 26 With this method InSitu Chips can be used to screen 96 independent sequences at one time. Thus, the screened 1526 (976 + 550) sequences correspond to 16 rounds of hybridization of 96 column-based InSitu Chips. The 1526 sequences correspond to 9.6% of the predicted genes in the genome and 21% of the clusters expressed in young adults. Since the 160 rounds of hybridization that would be needed to cover the entire genome would be impractical, we incorporated into the WISH the 81 candidate sequences that were selected from hemocyte ESTs based on an in silico subtraction. 22 This enabled us to identify 34 hemocyte-specific transcripts, compared with the 2 hemocyte-marker genes we reported previously. 22 The identification of 34 specific genes is likely to shed some light on the nature of hemocytes themselves. For example, in homology searches with the identified genes, clusters 03435, 10410 and 15640 were found to be homologous to CR-1 , C6 and BPIP , respectively. Therefore, these three genes possibly are associated with the immunity-related function of hemocytes. In contrast, 12 clusters have homologies with hypothetical proteins and 11 clusters show no homology to any known gene. Twelve of the 34 clusters likely encode polypeptides of <100 amino acid residues. One interesting possibility is that some of the 34 genes encode low-molecular weight anti-microbial polypeptides. However it must be noted that sequence comparisons alone do not necessarily predict whether a polypeptide has anti-microbial activity. The sequences of anti-microbial peptides reported thus far vary from species to species and from substance to substance. 30 Nevertheless, the identification of significant numbers of hypothetical and/or new genes suggests that C. intestinalis hemocytes either function in the immune response or mobilize genes that are not known among the innate immunity genes of mice and humans.  The expression patterns of hemocyte-specific genes have a second implication. Different sets of some clusters (02671, 07027 and 15584 in Fig. 2 , and CR-1-like , C6-like and BPIP-like in Fig. 3 ) are expressed in subsets of hemocytes that appear to be different. This suggests that the C. intestinalis hemocytes can be classified into several, at least three subgroups based on gene expression. The hemocytes of Halocynthia roretzy are categorized into five subgroups, L1 through L5, based on morphology. 31 Furthermore, most of the 34 C. intestinalis genes display one of two different expression patterns in the animal's life cycle. The genes from one group show a clear peak of expression at the larval/young-adult stage, at the time when hemocytes emerge as a significant proportion of the body cells. The genes from a second group are expressed not only in hemocytes of young adults but also in eggs. Although the significance of one of these genes as a possible maternal gene is not known, these observations imply the existence of multiple mechanisms for hemocyte-specific gene expression. The identification of hemocyte-dominant genes further strengthens this hypothesis. Thus, from the aspect of gene expression, C. intestinalis hemocytes may exert more pleiotropic effects than previously believed.  The promoter regions that are responsible for neuron-specific expression of C. intestinalis genes, such as G-protein alpha subunit, arrestin and vesicular acetylcholine transporter, recently have been reported. 32 This study used transgenic C. intestinalis embryos in which heterologous green fluorescent protein genes were under the control of the 5′ flanking regions of C. intestinalis genes. Thus, in the case of these genes, the regulatory elements for tissue-specific expression appear to be compacted into a relatively small region of 3000–4000 bp. If this proves to be the case for the hemocyte-specific genes as well, the identification of the 34 transcripts in this study will provide a valuable opportunity for analyzing their promoters, by using them in transgenic animals and visualizing hemocytes under live conditions.

Introduction The regulation of gene expression by epigenetic mechanisms such as cytosine methylation contributes to various biological processes like parental genomic imprinting, X-chromosomal inactivation, cellular differentiation and aging as well as the development of malignant disorders. 1–4 A variety of methods for the analysis of CpG methylation status have been developed including chromatographic separation, use of methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes and bisulfite-driven conversion of non-methylated cytosine to uracil. 5 Despite the widespread application of the latter and the ongoing technical ameliorations regarding the bisulfite protocol and methylation-specific PCR, still several limitations exist. These concern DNA degradation during sodium-bisulfite treatment due to oxidative damage, depurination under the required acidic and thermal conditions as well as inconsistent conversion of cytosine to uracil in a given DNA sample. 6 , 7 To overcome these technological difficulties we developed a novel method for 5′mC analysis applying a microarray format with immunodetection of 5′mC directly on genomic DNA without sequence conversion or DNA amplification. This was achieved by the exploitation of recent improvements in the field of array manufacture (150-µm thin aldehyde glass slides), ultra-sensitive surface molecule detection and the utilization of a fast scanning system with sufficient geometrical resolution. 8 , 92. Materials and Methods2.1. Cell lines and genomic DNA preparation Human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines HL-60 (American Type Culture Collection) and KG1a (Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen, DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany) were grown in RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco Invitrogen, Paisley, Scotland) supplemented with 10% FCS (Gibco), l -glutamine (300 mg/l; Gibco) and antibiotics [Streptomycin (100 µg/ml)/Penicillin (100 U/ml); Gibco]. Both cell lines are extensively described and epigenetically characterized. 10–13 Genomic DNA from cell lines was isolated according to Qiagens QIAmp Blood Kit procedure manual (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Restriction enzyme digest was performed with Mnl I from NEB (New England Biolabs). 2.2. Methyl-specific PCR (MS-PCR) Chemicals and oligonucleotides were purchased at Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Steinheim, Germany and Metabion GmbH, Munich, Germany, respectively. Methyl-specific PCR (MS-PCR) was performed with primer sequences as published by Herman et al. 14 Minor modifications concerned the use of HotStarTaq DNA polymerase (5 U/µl; Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), sodium-bisulfite treatment at 55°C for 4 h and 40 PCR cycles in a Primus 96 plus MWG-biotech thermal cycler starting with 400 ng bisulfite-treated DNA. All PCRs were performed with positive controls for both unmethylated and methylated alleles. PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels and ethidium bromide staining. 2.3. Microarray production To minimize background fluorescence we used borosilicate glass slides (50 × 24 × 0.15 mm 3 ; Stölzle-Oberglas, Austria) with an aldehyde surface obtained by standard surface chemistry. 15 Amino-modified capture oligonucleotides were coupled to the slide surface by reductive amination. 2.4. Capture oligonucleotide dilution and spotting processSense capture oligonucleotides were diluted to 5 µM in 1× SSC [15 mM sodium citrate, 150 mM sodium chloride, pH 7.0 with 2.5% glycerol (Sigma-Aldrich)]. The contact spotting robot (SpotBot), from ArrayIt, CA, was used with Tungsten Split Pins (PT3000; Point Technologies, Boulder, CO) for the microarray printing process, resulting in spots of ∼50-µm diameter with a volume of 100 pl. Oligonucleotide immobilization was performed at room temperature by incubation in a humid environment for 12 h. For stabilization of the intermediary carbon–nitrogen double bond between aldehyde surface and amino-modified capture oligonucleotides to form a secondary amine, sodium cyanoborohydride [0.02 M in 0.1 M carbonate buffer; pH 8.2 (Sigma-Aldrich)] was applied by additional 2 h incubation. After a 15 min washing step in carbonate buffer (0.1 M; pH 8.2) microarrays were dried and immediately used for hybridization experiments.2.5. Capture oligonucleotide design Capture oligonucleotide design was based upon analyses of predicted promoter sequences for possible methylation sites (CpG islands). 14 , 16 Capture oligonucleotides suitable to hybridize to DNA-targets generated by restriction enzyme digestion of genomic DNA were designed using OligoWiz software (Center for Biological Sequence Analysis BioCentrum-DTU Technical University of Denmark). Sequence information concerning capture and hybridization oligonucleotides (VBC-genomics, Vienna, Austria) including modifications and fluorescence labels are summarized in Table 1 . Oligonucleotide sequences Oligonucleotide description with length, sequence and NT number when indicated: All oligonucleotides, except target oligonucleotide, carried a 3′-terminal amino group with (CH) 7 -linker for surface immobilization. Positive control, sense p15/CDKN2b, sense p16/CDKN2a and sense E-cadherin carried an additional 5′-terminal fluorescence label (cyanine 5) used for spot quality control; x in sequence marks 5′methyl-cytosine; positive control oligonucleotide was spotted on each microarray and was used as internal standard; nonsense, sense p15/CDKN2b and target oligonucleotide were used to test antibody specificity and sensitivity; all sense oligonucleotides were used as capture oligonucleotides for hybridization with genomic DNA.

Hybridization experiments Hybridizations were performed at 55°C (oligonucleotides) or 65°C (genomic DNA), respectively, in a hybridization buffer mix containing 4× SSC and 0.1% SDS (Sigma-Aldrich, Chemie). The used surface inactivation (sodiumcyanoborohydride buffer) and blocking conditions [0.2% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich) in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Gibco)] allowed to omit prehybridization or the use of competitive DNA. For single subgrid hybridization (2.5-µl hybridization mixtures) 5 mm diameter cover slips, (Menzel Gläser, Braunschweig, Germany) and for multiple subgrid hybridization (10 µl hybridization mix) 22 × 22 mm 2 cover slips (Assistent, Sondheim, Germany) were used in Corning hybridization chambers (Fischer Scientific, Loughborough, UK) submerged in a water bath. After overnight hybridization washes were performed with 2× SSC, 0.01% SDS for 15 min, 2× SSC for 15 min and 0.2× SSC for 15 min with all washing solutions preheated to 42°C. 2.7. Microarray immunolabelingSlides were blocked for 30 min at room temperature with 0.2% BSA in Dulbecco's PBS and incubated with a monoclonal anti-5′mC antibody (clone: 33D3; mouse IgG1; Serotec, Düsseldorf, Germany) or isotype-matched control antibody (anti-collagen clone: COL-1; mouse IgG1) diluted in PBS–BSA–Tween [BSA 0.1%; Tween-20 0.05% (Sigma-Aldrich Chemie)] for 1 h at room temperature at a concentration of 1 µg/ml each. Primary antibody incubation was followed by a washing step in PBS for 5 min and secondary antibody incubation (cyanine 3 dye conjugated secondary goat anti-mouse antibody; 1 : 2000 diluted in PBS–BSA–Tween, Amersham) for 1 h at room temperature. After three 5 min washing steps in PBS, microarrays were dried and scanned immediately.2.8. Ultra-sensitive microarray readout The device applies a novel readout technology that combines wide-field illumination as well as time delay and integration (TDI) mode for readout. 9 In brief, the apparatus used in our measurements comprises an inverted microscope (Axiovert 200, Zeiss, Germany), a high-precision scanning stage (Märzhäuser Wetzlar, Germany) and a charge-coupled device camera (CCD camera) with high quantum efficiency and low readout noise running in TDI mode (CoolSNAP HQ, Photometrics, Roper Scientific, USA). For illumination of cyanine 3 and cyanine 5 we used an Nd : Yag laser (Neodym-Ion doted Yttrium–Aluminium–Granat) with λ = 532 nm (Millennia II, Spectra-Physics, USA) and a Krypton-Ion laser with λ = 647 nm (43 Series Ion Laser, Melles Griot, USA), respectively. High laser intensities, ×100 optical magnification (0.516 nm pixel resolution) and short exposure times (250 ms) allowed ultra-sensitive microarray readout within minutes. 2.9. Image analysis and statistics For image and data analysis we used ImaGene® 5.6 (BioDiscovery, CA, USA) together with ArrayNorm® 1.7 (Graz University of Technology Bioinformatics Group, Austria), 17 a software for array normalization and data visualization control. After background correction, statistical analysis of fluorescence signal intensities comparing the cell lines was done with two-tailed Student's t -test. 3. Results and discussion Designed amino-modified and fluorescence-labeled capture oligonucleotides were spotted on to the aldehyde surface-coated glass cover slips, hybridized with selected target oligonucleotides or enzyme digested genomic DNA. The consecutive indirect anti-5mC antibody staining was followed by readout on the fluorescence scanning platform (schematically outlined in Fig. 1 ). Cell line and target gene selection were based solely on well-established promoter/gene methylation models: E-cadherin, p15/CDKN2b and p16/CDKN2a from two AML-derived tumor cell lines (HL-60, KG1a). To validate the results obtained with the anti-5′mC microarray we analyzed representative CpG-island containing DNA fragments by MS-PCR.  Schematic assay system.

Antibody specificity To test the anti-5mC antibody specificity (Clone 33D3 18 ), target oligonucleotides designed with five consecutive 5′methyl CpG dinucleotides (100 aM, 600 molecules per µl), spaced by 2 nt, and nonsense oligonucleotides without 5′mC were hybridized to the immobilized capture oligonucleotide (1 µM) ( Fig. 2 ). The anti-5mC antibody signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of spot mean fluorescence intensity (mfi in counts) for the 5′mC positive target oligonucleotide was SNR = 7, in contrast to 5′mC negative nonsense control with an average SNR of 1. The minimum relevant signal is defined as the signal for which the SNR is ≥3. 19 Control experiments on sense and nonsense capture oligonucleotides after target hybridization with unspecific primary monoclonal antibody (anti-collagen) and labeled anti-IgG1 secondary antibody gave no signals (data not shown).

Assay sensitivity Hybridization experiments were performed with sense and nonsense capture oligonucleotides hybridized with a series of increasing target oligonucleotide concentrations (600 aM to 38.4 fM; Fig. 3 ). Signals of 10 repeats from 2 hybridization experiments plotted against the target oligonucleotide concentration are linear ( R2 = 0.96) from 600 aM to 38.4 fM. On a minimal slide background the 5′-mC-specific signals resulted in an SNR of 8 (mfi/SD 18/8) for the 600 aM spot and up to an SNR of 83 (mfi/SD 249/125) for the 38.4 fM spot. Signal intensities for target oligonucleotide hybridized to nonsense capture oligonucleotide are similar to slide background. A detection limit at 600 aM target oligonucleotide represents 1.5 fg DNA per hybridization volume of 3 µl, corresponding to the DNA content of nuclei from 540 cells. The detection limit of methylation-specific PCR is in the range of 50–500 pg DNA representing 10–100 cells. 20 Detection limit and dynamic range of the 5′methyl-cytosine microarray immunostaining.

Genomic DNA hybridization Microarray capture oligonucleotides and restriction enzymes were designed to bind and cut exactly the same CpG islands detected by MS-PCR. Mnl I digest result in a 147 bp fragment for p15/CDKN2b and a 111 bp fragment for p16/CDKN2a including the region amplified by MS-PCR. Mnl I digest concerning E-cadherin results in a 105 bp fragment in the preproprotein region for E-cadherin, a hypermethylated CpG region in certain tumors. 21 Genomic DNA was digested with Mnl I over night at 37°C, checked on agarose gels, quantified, split and used for MS-PCR analysis as well as for hybridization experiments in parallel. Experiments consisted of the hybridization with 1.5 µg DNA, representing 3 × 10 5 cells, on individual microarray slides with p15/CDKN2b, p16/CDKN2a and E-cadherin capture oligonucleotides. Each microarray subgrid contained 15 identical spots per gene, and negative (nonsense oligonucleotide) and positive control spots (33mer, see Table 1 and Fig. 5 first two lines left). Data analysis relying on 45 single spots from three successive hybridization experiments represented a reliable number of data for adequate statistical analysis. Original microarray scans of genomic DNA hybridization after immunoassaying for p15/CDKN2b, p16/CDKN2a and E-cadherin promoter methylation are shown in Fig. 5 . Spot signal quantification and data analysis revealed a clear discrimination between methylated and unmethylated promoter DNA for all three genes selected. Mean fluorescence intensities of promoter regions from p15/CDKN2b (mfi/SD 222/33) and p16/CDKN2a (mfi/SD 159/34) from HL-60 cells showed significantly lower signals than from KG1a with p15/CDKN2b (mfi/SD 672/130) and p16/CDKN2a (mfi/SD 568/138) ( P < 0.0001 in both cases), whereas E-cadherin promoter region displayed inversed measures with significantly higher methylation signals in HL-60 (mfi/SD 183/23) than in KG1a (mfi/SD 63/4) ( P < 0.0001) and reduced CpG methylation density compared to p15/CDKN2b and p16/CDK2a. The intra-assay analytical correlation of variance for p15/CDKN2b was 8.5%, for p16/CDKN2a 10.0% and for E-cadherin 7.6%. The overall consistency expressed as inter-assay variability between hybridization experiments was 15% on average, showing that the presented microarray experiments met general MIAME quality criteria. 22 Microarray methyl-cytosine immunodetection on genomic DNA.

Unlike other currently used methods, such as bisulfite conversion dependent MS-PCR or microarray techniques which focus on sequence details within individual primer pairs or capture oligonucleotide sequences, the presented method is capable of detecting all methylated cytosines per hybridized DNA fragment at once. Moreover our approach can be used for any region of the genome whether or not methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme sites are present. Practically, as a consequence of target DNA length (less than few hundred nucleotides), hybridization specificity can be optimized with the possibility to reduce the capture oligonucleotide numbers significantly compared with other microarray techniques for DNA methylation analysis.4. ConclusionWe have examined the feasibility of a novel microarray for 5′mC detection using immunofluorescence measurement. This method combines the advantages of microarray technology (high-throughput), fluorescence detection (high sensitivity) and immunolabeling (high specificity) and might become an adequate tool for investigating DNA methylation in various scientific fields.This project was supported by the Austrian Federal Ministry for Education, Science and Culture in the context of the Gen-AU project ‘Ultra sensitive Proteomics and Genomics’.

Introduction The genome sequence of the rice ( Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica ) cultivar ‘Nipponbare’ was completely decoded in 2005 by the International Rice Genome Sequencing Project ( Author Webpage ) through the use of clone-by-clone shotgun sequencing. 1 Before this announcement, a draft sequence of the ‘Nipponbare’ genome was released in 2002 and was extensively used by rice researchers. 2 , 3 The genome sequence of indica cultivar 93-11 was analyzed by whole-genome shotgun sequencing, 4 and sequence information on chromosome 4 of the ‘Guang-lu-ai 4’ cultivar (‘GLA4’) is publicly available. 5 Making full use of this information, Feltus et al. 6 and Shen et al. 7 constructed and published genome-wide DNA polymorphism databases. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertions and deletions (InDels) between japonica and indica cultivars over the whole genomic region are recorded in these databases.  Before the development of SNP typing technologies, cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) markers, which indirectly utilize SNPs, were popularly used for positional cloning of many agronomically important genes. 8–12 Nasu et al. 13 converted 213 SNPs throughout the whole genome into markers by the AcycloPrime FP method, 14 showing the effectiveness of SNPs as genetic markers in rice. The allele-specific PCR method has been used for SNP typing around the rice blast resistance gene Piz . 15 Information on SNP differences between japonica and indica promises to contribute DNA markers needed for positional cloning and marker-assisted breeding of new cultivars.  Previously, our group searched for SNPs in five cultivars, including ‘Nipponbare’, ‘Kasalath’ ( indica cultivar) and a wild accession of Oryza rufipogon Griff., ‘W1943’, among 417 amplicons amplified from intergenic regions. 13 In the present study, we added more cultivars and more loci (amplicons) to search for DNA polymorphisms in six japonica and two indica cultivars and ‘W1943’ among 1117 amplicons. To understand genome structure variation among modern Japanese rice cultivars and to prepare molecular markers for marker-assisted breeding, we selected five japonica Japanese paddy rice cultivars. A Taiwanese upland rice, ‘Senshou’, was used as a representative of putative middle-distance japonica cultivars. Two indica cultivars were selected from different indica groups for effective discovery of variation. Among wild rice, one accession of O. rufipogon , considered to be a candidate ancestor of O. sativa , was selected for reference of allele origins. We discovered and typed 7805 DNA polymorphisms in the cultivars and a wild rice. Besides their use as DNA markers, SNPs can also be used for allele discrimination in the analysis of allele-sharing status among distant or related rice strains. Here, we propose an ‘allele-sharing map’ as an effective strategy to convert huge amounts of complicated SNP data into a compact but informative map for various study purposes. An allele-sharing map (i) discriminates alleles by a series of SNPs, not by individual SNPs; (ii) shows the allele-sharing status at each locus in multiple cultivars; and (iii) covers the whole genome. The allele-sharing map of multiple genetic resources, including wild relatives and modern cultivars, will help us to picture allele transmission in the crossing and breeding process, for the purpose of understanding the origins of modern cultivars, for breeding new cultivars or for association analyses of trait genes.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Plant materials We searched eight cultivars and a wild accession of rice for DNA polymorphisms: O. sativa L. ssp. japonica paddy rice cultivars ‘Nipponbare’, ‘Koshihikari’, ‘Itadaki’, ‘Akihikari’ and ‘Kitaake’, and the Taiwanese upland rice ‘Senshou’; ssp. indica cultivars ‘Kasalath’ and ‘Guang-lu-ai 4’ (‘GLA4’); and O. rufipogon ‘W1943’.  Seeds of ‘Nipponbare’, ‘Kasalath’, ‘Koshihikari’, ‘Itadaki’, ‘Akihikari’ and ‘Senshou’ were provided by the National Institute of Crop Science, Tsukuba, Japan. Seeds of ‘Kitaake’ and ‘GLA4’ were provided by the Gene Bank of the National Institute of Agrobiological Science, Tsukuba. Seeds of ‘W1943’ were provided by the National Institute of Genetics, Mishima, Japan. Passport, trait and pedigree data of all cultivars except ‘W1943’ are publicly available from the Rice Research Database ( Author Webpage ); those of ‘W1943’ are available from the Wild Rice Database ( Author Webpage ). 2.2. Searching for polymorphisms among rice cultivars and ‘W1943’ Genomic DNA was isolated from leaves by the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide method. 16 PCR primers were designed to amplify 800–1000 bp genomic fragments from predicted intergenic regions of the publicly available ‘Nipponbare’ genome sequence [P1-derived artificial chromosome (PAC) or bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone; Author Webpage ] and the RiceGAAS annotation system ( Author Webpage ). Regions for analysis were selected evenly throughout each chromosome, at 1.8 cM intervals on average. In total, 1117 primer pairs successfully amplified single products from DNA of at least two cultivars, and served for sequence analysis with the DYE-namic ET Terminator reagent (Amersham Bioscience, Tokyo, Japan) in a MegaBACE 1000 DNA Sequencing System (Amersham Bioscience). Quadruple sequencing (two in each direction with independent PCR product as template) was performed on each cultivar to distinguish amplification errors or sequencing errors from real polymorphisms. Sequence data sets for each primer were then aligned using the DNASIS Pro software (Hitachi Software Engineering, Kanagawa, Japan) to detect polymorphisms. 2.3. Neighbor-joining tree based on SNPsThe neighbor-joining tree based on our SNP data were created using DNASIS Pro software from 4204 SNPs (excluding InDels >2 bp) found on 491 amplicons for which sequence data were obtained from all eight cultivars and ‘W1943’.2.4. Linkage disequilibrium calculation We used the computer program ‘interval’ to calculate values of D (coefficient of linkage disequilibrium) and D′ (the normalized coefficient) and their confidence interval between two SNPs (or polymorphic trait loci). This program was released by the Statistical Genetics Group at Tokyo Women's Medical University ( Author Webpage ). 2.5. Publicly available database The Rice SNP Database System constructed in this work is available on the Plant Genome Center website ( Author Webpage ). 3. Results and discussion3.1. Detection of SNPs in eight cultivars and ‘W1943’ We targeted intergenic DNA regions rather than coding regions in our search for SNPs because intergenic regions contained significantly more polymorphisms than coding regions, according to our test survey for five known genes (data not shown). Target cultivars included both closely and distantly related ones. We successfully analyzed 1117 amplicons of 600–1000 bp, distributed almost evenly across the whole genome. The numbers of amplicons on each chromosome are summarized in Table 1 . We detected 7805 polymorphisms (including InDels) among eight cultivars and ‘W1943’. The rate of fragments containing at least one polymorphism among these eight cultivars and ‘W1943’ ranged from 75.7% (chr. 2) to 86.4% (chr. 3), and averaged 81.6% ( Table 1 ). The total analyzed length was 888 015 bp, and the average length of amplicons was 795 bp. Numbers of primer pairs (amplicons) analyzed in this study Numbers of analyzed amplicons, numbers of amplicons with SNPs, numbers of SNPs and rates of amplicons with SNPs are summarized by chromosome. Analyzed cultivars are Oryza sativa ssp. japonica cultivars ‘Nipponbare’, ‘Koshihikari’, ‘Itadaki’, ‘Akihikari’, ‘Kitaake’ and ‘Senshou’, and indica cultivars, ‘Kasalath’ and ‘GLA4’, and an accession of O. rufipogon Griff., ‘W1943’. Numbers of primer pairs (amplicons) analyzed in this study Numbers of analyzed amplicons, numbers of amplicons with SNPs, numbers of SNPs and rates of amplicons with SNPs are summarized by chromosome. Analyzed cultivars are Oryza sativa ssp. japonica cultivars ‘Nipponbare’, ‘Koshihikari’, ‘Itadaki’, ‘Akihikari’, ‘Kitaake’ and ‘Senshou’, and indica cultivars, ‘Kasalath’ and ‘GLA4’, and an accession of O. rufipogon Griff., ‘W1943’. 3.2. Relations of the eight rice cultivars and ‘W1943’ We performed pairwise comparison between cultivars using polymorphisms on 491 amplicons for which nucleotide sequence data were obtained from all eight cultivars and ‘W1943’. As shown in Table 2 , ‘W1943’ versus ‘Kasalath’ showed the most polymorphisms (3072 polymorphisms; polymorphic rate, 0.795%), and ‘Kitaake’ versus ‘Kasalath’ was second (2877; 0.745%). All combinations of japonica paddy rice cultivars showed low polymorphism rates; the lowest was in the ‘Koshihikari’ versus ‘Itadaki’ comparison (137; 0.035%). Pairwise comparison between cultivarsSNP data from 491 amplicons for which effective data were obtained in all nine cultivars were used for calculation of the rate of polymorphism (%). (Rate = 100 × number of polymorphisms/number of nucleotides analyzed.)Pairwise comparison between cultivarsSNP data from 491 amplicons for which effective data were obtained in all nine cultivars were used for calculation of the rate of polymorphism (%). (Rate = 100 × number of polymorphisms/number of nucleotides analyzed.) Polymorphisms detected among the eight cultivars and ‘W1943’ on the 491 amplicons (which contained 4204 polymorphisms, both SNPs and single-nucleotide InDels) were used to create a neighbor-joining tree ( Fig. 1 ). The tree demonstrates that japonica paddy rice cultivars, including the Taiwanese upland rice ‘Senshou’, have closer relations among themselves than is the case between the indica cultivars ‘Kasalath’ and ‘GLA4’ ( Fig. 1 ). Our results are consistent with those of Garris et al. 17 , who analyzed 234 rice accessions with 169 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and showed that the indica group had a very high rate of polymorphisms (99% of analyzed loci), whereas the temperate japonica group had a slightly lower rate (91%). 17 Neighbor-joining tree based on SNPs between nine cultivars. 4204 SNPs (excluding InDels >2 bp) found on 491 amplicons analyzed in nine cultivars were used to create a neighbor-joining tree. DNASIS Pro software was used for calculation. ‘GLA4’ = ‘Guang-lu-ai 4’. ‘W1943’ = O. rufipogon . ‘Senshou’ is a japonica upland rice cultivar. ‘Kasalath’ and ‘GLA4’ are indica cultivars. Others are japonica paddy rice cultivars.  Neighbor-joining tree based on SNPs between nine cultivars. 4204 SNPs (excluding InDels >2 bp) found on 491 amplicons analyzed in nine cultivars were used to create a neighbor-joining tree. DNASIS Pro software was used for calculation. ‘GLA4’ = ‘Guang-lu-ai 4’. ‘W1943’ = O. rufipogon . ‘Senshou’ is a japonica upland rice cultivar. ‘Kasalath’ and ‘GLA4’ are indica cultivars. Others are japonica paddy rice cultivars.  Both pairwise comparison between the cultivars ( Table 2 ) and the neighbor-joining tree calculated from the DNA polymorphism data ( Fig. 1 ) revealed O. rufipogon ‘W1943’ to be much closer to ssp. japonica than to ssp. indica . Ohtsubo et al. 18 analyzed 101 strains of O. rufipogon with 24 loci of p-SINE1 , and discovered that ‘W1943’ was the closest among analyzed rufipogon accessions to modern Japanese cultivars, sharing 21 of the 24 p-SINE1 loci with ‘Nipponbare’, ‘Koshihikari’, ‘Akihikari’ and ‘Sasanishiki’. These results suggest that ‘W1943’ might be an ancestor of Japanese cultivars.  These results show that genome-wide SNP information, as well as SSRs and p-SINE1 , can be used to speculate about evolutionary processes or gene transmission in the development of cultivars from wild varieties. 3.3. Frequency of polymorphisms on each chromosome The distributions of DNA polymorphisms detected among the eight cultivars and ‘W1943’ are plotted along a genetic map of each chromosome ( Fig. 2 ). The polymorphisms are not distributed evenly along each chromosome, and densities are lower in regions adjacent to the centromeres of chromosomes 5 and 10. This observation is consistent with the reports by Nasu et al. 13 and Shen et al. 7 , and with an SNP map of ‘Nipponbare’ versus ‘9311’ ( indica ) produced by the Beijing Genomics Institute ( Author Webpage ). Regions of lower polymorphism density (in other words, relatively well-conserved regions) were additionally detected at, for example, ∼60 and ∼110 cM on chr. 1 ( Fig. 2 ). Chr. 2 was well conserved among the eight cultivars and ‘W1943’ ( Fig. 2 ). Polymorphism-rich regions were found at, for example, ∼85 and ∼110 cM on chr. 11 ( Fig. 2 ). The regions with low polymorphisms even in predicted non-coding nucleotide sequences can be speculated to have biological importance of some sort, for example, functional non-coding RNAs. 19 The relationship between SNP frequencies and gene densities or phenotypes, however, has not been investigated in this study. In addition, our observations are limited, and the polymorphism distribution will change when different combinations of rice strains are used.

Allele-sharing map As most of the amplicons analyzed in this study have multiple DNA polymorphisms, genotypes of series of SNPs or InDels on amplicons were displayed as patterns (‘haplotypes’) for precise allele discrimination ( Table 3 ). Discriminated alleles are shown in Fig. 3 in different colors and are aligned by genetic distance from the distal end of the short arm of each chromosome. Allele-sharing status is thus illustrated for the whole genome. In Fig. 3 , the 1117 amplicons analyzed in this study are aligned; 183 of them are mono-allelic (non-polymorphic) among the eight cultivars and ‘W1943’.

As shown, five alleles (haplotypes) were clearly discriminated with these SNPs.Figure 3 clearly shows that most regions of japonica cultivars have two alleles (di-allelic) or a single allele (mono-allelic) in common, and only a minor proportion had three or more alleles. As ‘Kasalath’, ‘GLA4’ and ‘W1943’ have additional alleles in some of these regions, some amplicons have up to six alleles in the eight cultivars and ‘W1943’ ( Fig. 3 ). Moreover, in some multi-allelic amplicons, japonica paddy rice cultivars share the same allele with indica cultivars or with the wild rice ( Fig. 3 ).  Garris et al. 17 showed that the allele variation among 234 rice accessions ( O. sativa ) was 7.3 in indica , 4.9 in temperate japonica and 11.8 in all analyzed accessions, indicating that cultivated rice has high diversity in its genome structure. In this study, we reaffirmed the existence of allele variation even among very limited modern cultivars with a new set of SNPs. Further, the wild rice ‘W1943’ was suggested to share alleles with modern Japanese cultivars in a considerable part of the genome. This result supports the assumption that the genome of cultivated rice consists of a mosaic of various chromosomal segments derived from a broad range of wild rice. Further polymorphism analysis with SNPs and other DNA markers using various accessions, selected from the Rice Diversity Research Set of germplasm (RDRS) 20 and from wild rice collections, will be of great help for understanding the process of domestication and adaptation of each cultivar of O. sativa . 3.5. Potential of allele sharing analysis for association analysisAn allele-sharing map is a diagram that shows the allele-sharing status at each analyzed point on each chromosome. If trait information is available for analyzed strains, possible trait-associated genomic regions can be screened at a glance. As a test case of screening trait-associated regions by using the allele sharing status and trait information of each cultivar, we examined linkage disequilibrium (LD) between alleles at an amplicon in the neighborhood of the rice blast resistance gene Pia ( Magnaporthe grisea resistance-a , 36 cM on chr. 11) and the resistance type of all cultivars. At the nearest amplicon, S0186 (27.8 cM on chr. 11), cultivars without Pia (Nipponbare, Koshihikari and Itadaki) share allele 1, while those with Pia (Akihikari and Kitaake) share allele 2 (Senshou has allele 1 but Pia type is unknown) ( Table 3 ). To calculate the D ′ value, we sequenced the amplicons to determine the allele type of 28 cultivars for which Pia type information is available ( Table 3 ). Calculation performed with ‘interval’ software showed significant LD between haplotypes on S0186 and Pia ( D ′ = −0.8333, 99% CI [−1.0000, −0.1075]). The same calculation for S0161 (5.5 cM on chr. 10), not linked to Pia and with the same allele-sharing pattern among the five japonica paddy rice cultivars, showed no significant LD (data not shown).  An allele-sharing map made from cultivars and varieties that are closely related but with obviously different traits in principle makes it possible to predict genetic regions responsible for certain traits. Calculating D ′ for Pia and its nearest amplicon showed the effectiveness of this strategy. It is difficult to obtain a statistically significant result using only a small number of cultivars for SNP searching, but one can screen candidate regions, and additional testing with more cultivars and varieties with reliable trait information will identify regions coding traits of interest. Such strategy should be particularly effective in crop plants, such as rice, with abundant cultivars and for which reliable trait information and pedigree data are available. Especially in Japan, there are a number of closely related rice cultivars with very low allele variation that nevertheless clearly differ in important traits, and the trait information was accumulated during their long history of cultivation. Making full use of these materials and their allele-sharing profiles will make it possible to study traits that are difficult to analyze at the individual plant level. As analyses with too few cultivars or bias in the genetic background of a population will cause incorrect results, however, appropriate consideration must be given to the structure and scale of populations to be analyzed. 3.6. SNPs as molecular markers About 90% of InDels detected between japonica and indica by computer analysis function as markers. 7 SNPs can be converted into markers by conventional methods such as CAPS, dCAPS and allele-specific PCR, or by various established typing systems such as AcycloPrime FP. 16 Using abundant SNPs and InDels on all chromosomes, one can easily establish molecular markers and draw graphical genotypes of pedigrees to select an individual with an ideal genetic background for the next crossing. This will not only accelerate the breeding of new cultivars but will also make it possible to introduce genomic fragments with comparable precision to that of genetic modification. Additionally, cultivars developed with this strategy can be discriminated easily by SNP typing, so they can be solidly protected as intellectual property.  The SNP information collected in this study can be freely obtained from our database ( Author Webpage ). Users can retrieve SNPs in any genetic region between any two or more cultivars, and browse the detailed information to design markers. Further, as SNP information can be obtained from aligned data (as shown in Table 3 ), allele-sharing analyses are facilitated. We believe it to be an effective tool for rice researchers. Nucleotide polymorphism information on multiple cultivars opens a new dimension of genome sequence comparison. Versatile applications, gene identification, genome breeding and cultivar discrimination will be facilitated by the accumulation of such information.This work was supported in part by the project ‘Development of DNA Marker-aided Selection Technology for Plants and Animals’ of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (project No. 2201)."

Introduction All plant biological processes are controlled by signal transduction and metabolism regulation that have been known to occur via phosphorylation-mediated transition of protein states. In many cases, to complete their regulatory actions, these phosphorylated proteins must physically associate with the specialized adapter proteins, which are known as 14-3-3 phosphoserine/threonine binding proteins. 1–4 It is one hallmark of signal transduction and metabolism events to identify 14-3-3 participation in cellular regulatory pathways in which 14-3-3s, generally acting as adapters, chaperones, activators or repressors, interact physically with target (client) proteins phosphorylated to execute an important step in signal transduction and metabolism.  There are several lines of evidence to show that 14-3-3s are involved in many metabolic and signaling pathways for plant growth regulation and responses to environmental stress. The most prominent paradigms involving 14-3-3s in plant regulatory events include the regulation of plasma membrane H + -ATPase, nitrate reductase (NR) and sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS). 1 , 4 14-3-3s have been known as positive regulators of H + -ATPase activity, with 14-3-3s and Mg 2+ bound to the C-terminal region of the H + -ATPase, pump activity is stimulated. Interestingly, a wilt-inducing phytotoxin fusicoccin (FC) binds to the complex of 14-3-3s and H + -ATPase, resulting in continuous high-activity state of H + -ATPase, guard cell solute uptake and excessive transpiration that leads to leaf wilt. 5–7 Whereas, 14-3-3s function as inhibitors of NR and SPS. Mg 2+ binding causes a structural change in 14-3-3s that allows binding to the phosphorylated target enzymes, a process known to inactivate NR and SPS. 1 14-3-3 proteins also bind a range of transcription factors for their activation and translocation. 8 For example, the tobacco transcription factor RSG (repression of shoot growth) is bound to 14-3-3s and involved in GA biosynthesis. 9 , 10 Interestingly, 14-3-3 proteins function as regulators of a wide range of target proteins that are involved in responses to abiotic and biotic stress, by regulating target proteins with functions of either signaling or transcription activation or defense. 11 For example, the tobacco T14-3-3 is induced in the perception of the salt stress 12 ; two Arabidopsis 14-3-3 genes, RCI1 / RCI1A and RCI2 / RCI1B , are regulated during cold acclimation 13 ; Arabidopsis 14-3-3 isoforms could bind to and probably activate a stress-responsive calcium-dependent protein kinase, CPK-1. 14 , 15 The activity of mitochondrial and chloroplast F0F1 ATP synthases, regulated by 14-3-3s, is involved in responses to light/dark transitions, anoxia changes in nutrient supply. 16 Recently, Yan et al. 17 reported that the transgenic cotton plants with constitutive expression of GF14λ displayed phenotypes of ‘stay-green’ and enhanced tolerance to drought stress, probably through the regulation of the stomatal aperture by the complex of 14-3-3s and H + -ATPase. 14-3-3s have been found involved in plant defense responses. 11 , 18 For instance, a 14-3-3 gene was identified to be regulated in the non-host hypersensitive response (HR) between barley and Blumeria graminis f.sp. tritici . 19 Furthermore, it is well characterized that 14-3-3s bind to and activate H + -ATPase, creating a binding site for the phytotoxin FC, and FC-binding activity of an epidermal microsomal fraction increases upon the pathogen attack, suggesting that 14-3-3s are involved in an epidermis-specific response to the fungus probably through activating the proton pump (H + -ATPase) to stimulate the HR. 20 Caffeic acid/5-hydroxyferulic acid O- methyltransferase (OMT1) and ascorbate peroxidase implicated in plant defense or oxidative stress are identified to interact with 14-3-3s by yeast two-hybrid screening. 21 , 22 It is also shown that the white spruce and hybrid poplar 14-3-3s are up-regulated by wounding or wounding elicitors, or by chitosan and jasmonic acid, two defensive elicitors, and H + -ATPase is a potential target for the 14-3-3-mediated regulation during stress. 23 Similar to FC, other two inducers of programmed cell death, tunicamycin and brefeldin A, also induce the accumulation of 14-3-3 proteins. 24 Interestingly, a 14-3-3-interactor, AKR2, is an ankyrin-repeat containing protein and negatively regulates transcription factors that mediate defense responses. 25 , 26 The AKR2 -antisense plants developed HR-like lesions with increased H 2 O 2 generation and exhibited increased resistance to a bacterial pathogen. 26 Plants have large 14-3-3 gene families, and various 14-3-3 isoforms have differential affinities for certain target proteins. The dicotyledonous model plant Arabidopsis has hitherto the most complete and largest 14-3-3 family which consists of 15 members with at least 12 expressed members classified into two evolutionary branches, the ɛ group and the non-ɛ group. 3 , 4 These 14-3-3 isoforms exhibit a high cell and tissue-type specificity and are localized within the cytoplasm and organelles such as nuclei, plastids and mitochondria. 3 The expression specificity and subcellular compartment of isoforms contribute to their diverse interactions with partners and differential functions in cellular activities. However, our understanding of the significance of 14-3-3 proteins in the regulation of plant development and environmental adaptation is still in its infancy.  Rice, with its relative small genome and important staple food crop, has been adopted as a monocotyledonous model plant for dissecting genetic networks of biotic and abiotic stress responses in cereal crops. The completion of the rice genome project allows genome-wide searching for the 14-3-3 family in the genome, 27 which has been found involved in rice stress responses as well as development. For example, the rice 14-3-3 proteins, GF14b, GF14c, GF14e and GF14f (previously named SR14-3-3), interact with target proteins that are involved in stress responses. 28 Interestingly, GF14b and GF14f may interact with mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase BIMK1, a component induced by rice blast fungus and known to participate in systemic acquired resistance. 28 In a large-scale microarry analysis for rice genes involved in defense responses, we identified some 14-3-3 genes were regulated by different interactions between rice and the pathogens or by defense signaling compounds. In this report, we analyzed the phylogenetics of the rice 14-3-3 family comprising eight members that are all expressed. We systemically analyzed expression patterns of four 14-3-3 genes that were differentially regulated by the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea ( M. grisea ) and bacterial blight Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae ( Xoo ), defense signaling compounds and diverse abiotic stress stimuli. We also observed subcellular locations of these isoforms. 2. Materials and methods2.1. Mining of rice14-3-3s and phylogenetic analysis Rice 14-3-3s were searched from the whole rice genome ( japonica Nipponbare) with the conversed 14-3-3 protein sequence via the public GenBank database ( Author Webpage ). The retrieved cDNAs or coding regions of 14-3-3s then were searched for their full-length cDNAs in the KOME database ( Author Webpage ). Genomic structures of the rice 14-3-3 genes were analyzed by comparing the cDNA sequences and the corresponding genomic DNA sequences. ClustalX 1.81 and Genedoc were used to multi-align nucleotide acid and amino acid sequences of the 14-3-3s. ClustalX 1.81 and TreeView 1.6.1 were used to perform phylogenetic analysis. 2.2. Plant growth and inoculation A pair of rice ( Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica ) near isogenic lines, H7R (resistant to rice blast, with the resistance gene Pi-k / Pi-r1(t) from the donor Tetep) and H7S (susceptible) were grown in a growth chamber under 28°C/22°C and 14 h/10 h (day/night) for 2 weeks, then were spray-inoculated with M. grisea race ZB1 as described. 29 Rice suspension cells were made from the transgenic rice line 106 expressing the resistance gene Xa21 against Xoo30 and were co-incubated with 10 7 cells per ml of the incompatible Xoo race P6 (99A) and the compatible race K1 (J18) as described. 31 Inoculated leaves/cells were harvested at a time course of 0–24 h postinoculation. All tissues were washed to remove surface microbes and frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately then stored at −80°C for RNA preparation. 2.3. Treatments with defense signaling compounds Two-week-old seedlings of H7R were spray-treated with 300 µM benzothiadiazole (BTH, a salicylic acid analog), 100 µM methyl jasmonate (MeJA), and 100 µM ethephon (ETH, a precursor of ethylene), in the closed pots at a growth chamber. Water-spray was used as mock controls. Leaves were collected at 0, 4, 8, 12 and 24 h after treatments. The rice suspension cells were incubated for 0, 2, 6 and 12 h with various concentrations of H 2 O 2 . 2.4. Treatments with abiotic stressTwo-week-old seedlings of H7R were cultured with 150 mM NaCl, 20% PEG 6000 for salt and drought stress treatments, and with 100 µM abscisic acid (ABA) solution for 0–48 h. For wounding treatment, leaves were cut into 2–3 cm pieces and kept in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) for 0–48 h.2.5. RNA preparation and northern blot Total RNAs were isolated from cells by using TRIzol tragent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Waston Biot). Each 30 µg of total RNAs was separated on a 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel for capillary blotting onto Hybond nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia), and hybridized with probes derived from a 320 bp Sac II/ Sfi I fragment from GF14b , a 420 bp Sfi I fragment from GF14c , a 400 bp Bcl I/ Sfi I fragment from GF14e and a 350 bp Cfr13I/Sfi I fragment from GF14f . Similarities between each probe and the other GF14 genes are <55% to ensure probe specificity. 2.6. Tissue-specific expression of GF14 genes Total RNA was prepared from seedling leaves, leaves, roots, internodes and panicles followed by the first cDNA strand synthesis for RT–PCR using SuperScript™ RT–PCR kit (Invitrogen). Primers were designed for GF14b (5′-AGGACATTGCTTTGGCTGAG-3′ and 5′-TTACTGCCCCTCGCTGGAG-3′), GF14c (5′-CGTTTGACGAAGCCATCTCC-3′ and 5′-CTAGTAGAACAGGAGAAGAATC-3′), GF14e (5′-GATATTGCCCTGGCAGAGTTG-3′ and 5′-GAGATATCGGAAGTCCACAGC-3′) and GF14f (5′-GATATTGCCCTGGCAGAGTTG-3′ and 5′-TTAGTGGCCCTCTCCTTCAG-3′), to amplify the fragments of 300 bp ( GF14b ), 280 bp ( GF14c ), 240 bp ( GF14e ) and 300 bp ( GF14f ), respectively. The rice ubi-1 was used as the control. 322.7. Subcellular localization of GF14 protein GF14-YFP fusions were made by in-frame fusion of the full-length GF14 cDNAs with YFP (accession number AA048591). The fusion genes were inserted into the vector pCAMBIAC1301 driven by the 35S promoter and were bombard-transformed into the wild-type cultivar TP309 calli by using a helium biolistic device (Bio-Rad PDS-1000/He). Calli were grown and selected on medium supplemented with hygromycin (20 mg/L) to generate GF14-YFP transgenic calli. Transient expression of the GF14-GFP fusions in onion epidermal cells was performed as previously described. 33 The transgenic rice and onion cells were observed with a confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss LSM510). 4′-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) fluorescence staining was performed to detect the nuclei. The cells were dipped in 30% sucrose solution for 30 min to perform plasmolysis. 2.8. Analysis of cis-acting elements in promoter regions of GF14 genes According to the full-length cDNA sequences, the putative promoter regions were retrieved by searching the matched genomic sequences of the genes in GenBank ( Author Webpage ), with 2000 bp upstream of the 5′ termini of the full-length cDNAs. The cis -acting elements, such as W, GCC and GCC-like, ABRE and DRE/CRT boxes in the promoter regions were analyzed. 3. Results3.1. The rice GF14 family and comparison with the Arabidopsis family By taking advantage of the completion of the rice genome project, we found that this model crop has a total of eight 14-3-3 genes located to six chromosomes that all have matched full-length cDNAs, suggesting that these genes are all expressed ( Fig. 1A ). Following the previous report, 28 the members of the rice family are named GF14a through GF14h (G-box factor 14-3-3 homologs), with SR14-3-3 named as GF14f. These GF14 proteins share highly conserved structures ( Fig. 1A ). According to the 14-3-3 classification, 4 GF14g and GF14h belong to the ɛ group, while the rest belong to the non-ɛ group. The phylogenetic topology of the rice family compared with the Arabidopsis family reveals five groups ( Fig. 1B ), of which groups A–D are similar to those for the Arabidopsis family and other plant 14-3-3s. 4 GF14g and GF14h fall into group D with five Arabidopsis 14-3-3s. However, the majority of the rice GF14s (six out of eight) constitute an additional group E. This result suggests that separate gene duplication of the non-ɛ group could occur before the differentiation of the two species. The richness of diversity in these 14-3-3s indicates divergent roles of the members in biological processes in rice as well as in Arabidopsis .

GF14 genes induced during the early rice-M. grisea and rice-Xoo interactions In a large-scale microarray analysis of rice genes involved in defense responses, we found >1000 genes regulated by pathogen infection and other stress stimuli (Li et al., unpublished). The microarray data are available in our rice genomics database ( Author Webpage ). Among these regulated genes, we found four of the GF14 genes, GF14b , GF14c , GF14e and GF14f. The four GF14s share high similarity (overall 85.5–95.4% identities) on their amino acid sequences ( Fig. 2A ), but comparatively low similarity (overall 34.8–51.7% identities) on cDNA sequences. We analyzed the induction of these genes in the early incompatible and compatible rice- M. grisea interactions. Northern blot analysis showed that all four GF14 genes were induced by the fungal pathogen in a time course of 0–24 h postinoculation ( Fig. 2B ). Similarly, these genes except GF14f were also induced in the rice- Xoo interactions ( Fig. 2C ). Furthermore, it was shown that these genes appeared to be earlier or stronger induced in the incompatible interactions than in the compatible interactions between rice and the pathogens ( Fig. 2B and C ), consistent with the well-recognized expression pattern of defense-related genes during the host–pathogen interactions. 34 Alignments of four rice GF14 isoforms and their induction during rice defense responses.

GF14 genes regulated by abiotic stress It has been known that plant 14-3-3 proteins are involved in abiotic stress responses. 11 We further analyzed the expression patterns of these GF14 genes in responses to abiotic stress including salinity, drought and wounding. Northern hybridization indicated that these GF14 genes were differentially regulated by the stress stimuli ( Fig. 3 ). The transcription of GF14b was rapidly induced at 2–4 h by the salt and PEG6000 (drought-mimic) treatments, then declined to basal levels. Similarly, GF14c and GF14e were also induced at the early stage of 2–8 h by salt and drought stresses, consistent with the observation that the transcription of GF14b , GF14e was induced by a variety of stress stimuli. 28GF14f appeared to be induced by salinity and drought through the whole time course of 2–48 h. Wounding also induced the GF14 genes except GF14b with peak levels at 24 h after treatment. Interestingly, the transcription of GF14e was decreased at 48 h in wounding treatment ( Fig. 3 ). These differential expression patterns of the GF14 genes tested in face of abiotic stresses implicate that they may play regulatory roles in environmental responses.  Differential regulation of GF14 gene expression by abiotic stress. The transcripts of GF14b, GF14c, GF14e and GF14f were detected after salt (150 mM NaCl), drought (20% PEG6000) and wounding treatments as described. C48, control for 48 h.  Differential regulation of GF14 gene expression by abiotic stress. The transcripts of GF14b, GF14c, GF14e and GF14f were detected after salt (150 mM NaCl), drought (20% PEG6000) and wounding treatments as described. C48, control for 48 h. 3.4. GF14 genes regulated by defense and stress compounds It has been known that the phytohormones, salicylic acid, jasmonic acid and ethylene are signaling compounds involved in plant defense, 34 and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), one of reactive oxygen intermediates resulting from an oxidative burst during the plant HR, acts as an activator of plant defense. 35 We systemically analyzed the induction of the four GF14 genes by these molecules. As shown in Fig. 4A , GF14f was induced by BTH, ETH and MeJA, similar was GF14e except it was first slightly repressed at 4 and 8 h by BTH. GF14b was slightly induced by BTH and ETH but not by MeJA. Similarly GF14c was significantly induced at 24 h by ETH and slightly induced by BTH and MeJA. Because of no consistent information for H 2 O 2 treatment of rice cells, we tested the effect of different H 2 O 2 concentrations on the induction of the 14-3-3 genes. All of the four GF14 genes were up-regulated by H 2 O 2 even with low concentration ( Fig. 4B ). Low H 2 O 2 concentration (0.01 mM) seemed to be more efficient to activate GF14c .  Differential induction of GF14 genes by defense and stress molecules. ( A ) BTH (300 µM), MeJA (100 µM) and ETH (100 µM) differentially induced GF14b, GF14c, GF14e and GF14f . ( B ) H 2 O 2 induced the GF14 genes. Note that low H 2 O 2 concentration (0.01 mM) seemed to stronger induce GF14c . ( C ) Induction of the GF14 genes by ABA (100 µM). C48, control for 48 h.  Differential induction of GF14 genes by defense and stress molecules. ( A ) BTH (300 µM), MeJA (100 µM) and ETH (100 µM) differentially induced GF14b, GF14c, GF14e and GF14f . ( B ) H 2 O 2 induced the GF14 genes. Note that low H 2 O 2 concentration (0.01 mM) seemed to stronger induce GF14c . ( C ) Induction of the GF14 genes by ABA (100 µM). C48, control for 48 h.  ABA acts as a stress-responsive hormone and involves in modulating tolerance to drought and salinity. 36 Our analysis showed that ABA induced GF14e and GF14f during the time course ( Fig. 4C ). Similar to the observation in the salt and drought treatments ( Fig. 3 ), GF14b and GF14c were obviously induced by ABA only within early 2–8 h of treatments ( Fig. 4C ). In addition, GF14c appeared to be more subject to environmental regulation, because even its basal expression level was somewhat different among independent treatments ( Figs 2B and C , 3 and 4 ). 3.5. Cis-elements in promoter regions of GF14 genes It has been known that the cis -acting elements, W, GCC and GCC-like boxes, play important roles in expression regulation of defense-related genes, 37 and that the major cis -elements involved in abiotic stress response are ABRE and DRE/CRT. 36 , 38 We systematically analyzed these elements in the predicted 2.0 kb promoter regions of the four GF14 genes ( Table 1 ). The analysis shows that the ABRE, W and GCC/GCC-like sequences are predominant elements in the predicted promoters of the GF14 genes analyzed, indicating their features of biotic and abiotic stress-mediated induction. We also found that the same cis -elements are present in the other four GF14 genes ( Table 1 ). The biological significance of these elements in the regulation of gene expression is yet to be investigated.  Stress-responsive cis -elements in promoter regions of GF14 genes aY = C or T; R = G or A; S = C or G; B = C, G or T.a 2000 bp putative promoter regions were analyzed for cis -elements.  Stress-responsive cis -elements in promoter regions of GF14 genes aY = C or T; R = G or A; S = C or G; B = C, G or T.a 2000 bp putative promoter regions were analyzed for cis -elements. 3.6. Tissue-specific expression and subcellular localization of GF14 proteins We further analyzed the tissue-specific expression patterns of the GF14 genes, and found that these GF14s exhibited a degree of tissue specificity ( Fig. 5 ). GF14e was expressed in all tissues tested, with the highest expression level in the panicle, similar was the expression pattern of GF14f except its low expression level in the flag leaf and internode of the heading plant. Whereas the transcript of GF14b was hardly detected in the flag leaf, internode and panicle of the heading plant, with higher level detected in the root. Similarly, the transcript of GF14c was hardly detected in the leaf and root of the heading plant, with the highest level detected in the seedling leaves. These tissue-specific patterns of GF14s ' expression are probably associated with their differential functions.  Tissue-specific expression and subcellular localizations of the GF14 isoforms.

Expression of the GF14 genes in different tissues, detected by RT–PCR with the rice ubi-1 as a control. SL, seedling leaf; L, R, I, P for flag leaf, root, internode, panicle of heading plants, respectively.  14-3-3 proteins are widely localized in diverse subcellular compartments, implicating their multifunctional roles in cellular processes. 3 We made GF14-YFP fusion constructs and expressed them in rice cells. Because localization of YFP/GFP fusion proteins is usually obscure in rice callus, the cytoplasmic location of the fusion proteins was difficult to be imaged in the rice cells. We could observe obvious YFP fluorescence only in the compartments where the fusion proteins accumulated ( Fig. 6A ). With DAPI fluorescence probing to localize the nuclei, we observed that GF14b-YFP, GF14e-YFP and GF14f-YFP accumulated in the nuclei. For a clear vision of the localization of the YFP fusion proteins, transient expression was performed in onion epidermic cells. This additional experiment clearly showed that GF14-YFP fusion proteins were all targeted to the cytoplasm ( Fig. 6B ). Same to the observation with the transformed rice calli, GF14b-YFP, GF14e-YFP and GF14f also accumulated in the nuclei. Similar subcellular localization was also observed for the Arabidopsis 14-3-3 proteins. 3 , 4 Hence, diversity in the expression and subcellular localization of the rice 14-3-3 proteins is present to ensure their functions in certain cells or tissues.

Discussions 14-3-3 proteins, acting as ubiquitous regulators, have been known to play important roles in many plant biological processes. However, their involvement in abiotic and abiotic stress responses, two biological activities with agricultural significance, has not been well studied. In this paper, we have shown that the rice 14-3-3 genes, GF14b, GF14c, GF14e and GF14f , were induced differentially by the rice fungal and bacterial pathogens, defense signaling compounds and abiotic stress stimuli ( Figs 2–4 ). Our current study adds to the previous findings of the rice 14-3-3 family 28 , 39 , 40 and would serve as a start point to explore their functions in disease resistance and stress tolerance in the model cereal crop.  It is intriguing that the rice 14-3-3 family has most likely only eight isoforms classified into 2 groups in comparison with 12 isoforms expressed in the Arabidopsis family ( Fig. 1 ), given the much larger genome of rice than that of Arabidopsis . It has been known that, in spite of the conservation of their core structure, 14-3-3 isoforms have a degree of specificity with regard to the target proteins with which they interact. 11 It is also interesting that the rice 14-3-3 proteins except two constitute a separate group (group E) ( Fig. 1B ). A systemic and comparative analysis of the target proteins of the rice and Arabidopsis 14-3-3 isoforms would contribute to fundamental understanding of the conservation and divergence of biological processes between the two model plants.  We found that all of four GF14 genes studied were differentially regulated by the rice pathogen challenge and abiotic stress, indicating they may play important roles in rice defense and abiotic stress tolerance. Similar involvement of 14-3-3s in defense and stress responses has also been frequently observed in other plants. In addition to the evidence described above, a 14-3-3 gene is induced during the HR of soybean inoculated with P. syringae , 41 and in cotton inoculated with the wilt pathogen V. dahliae . 42 In tomato, ten 14-3-3 genes were found to be differentially regulated in resistant or susceptible plants challenged with the avirulence elicitor Avr9. 18 In ABA-mediated stress responses, 14-3-3 proteins are constituents of transcription factor complexes for ABA-induced gene expression. 2 Direct evidence for 14-3-3s involved in disease resistance or stress tolerance also comes from genetic studies. A quantitative resistance marker (QTL) against fungal pathogens is mapped onto a region of chromosome 4AL of wheat containing a 14-3-3 gene. 43,GF14c is localized within the interval of drought tolerance QTL oa8.1 , and SR14-3-3/GF14f interacts with an ATPase known to locate to the region of drought tolerance QTL oa3.1 . 28 , 39 More recently, GF14e (previously named as 14-3-3 protein-A) is localized in the QTL region for blast resistance on chromosome 2. 40 It has been extensively documented that transmembrane ion flux is involved in early defense signaling, therefore, a role for some 14-3-3 proteins in plant defense can be speculated, which probably interact with some membrane-bound clients such as H + -ATPase. Interestingly, GF14b and GF14c exhibited similar induction patterns during the salinity, drought and ABA treatments ( Figs 3 and 4C ), whether they play an important role in face of these stress conditions remains to be evaluated. We also found the cis -elements responsive to pathogen attack and abiotic stress in the rice GF14 genes ( Table 1 ), appropriately explaining the features of the induction of the genes by biotic and abiotic stresses. Therefore, 14-3-3s are also subject to the regulation by certain transcript factors.  Given the size of 14-3-3 gene families and the wide range of pathways in which they have been involved, it would be difficult or trivial to identify the phenotypes of individual 14-3-3 mutations. 4 , 8 14-3-3s act as scaffolds for the assembly of large signaling complexes, and various 14-3-3 isoforms have different affinities for at least certain target proteins that are most likely with the same cellular localization for functioning. Complete understanding of 14-3-3 roles will require the determination of cellular and subcellular localizations and targets of specific isoforms. For example, GF14c is associated with at least 10 proteins known to accumulate in the thylakoid. 28 Therefore, searching for and identifying functions of the target proteins of a given 14-3-3 through the forward or reverse genetic approach would provide a clue for the 14-3-3-mediated cellular activities.

IntroductionBrain development can be seen as long interrelated sequences of proliferation, migration and differentiation of neuroblasts and support cells.1,2 Exposure of the developing brain to moderate or high doses of X- or γ-ray ionizing radiation are known to interfere with these events. Epidemiological studies on children from radiation exposed pregnant women of Hiroshima and Nagasaki have emphasized the consequence of radiation exposure.3–6 This exposure resulted in the occurrence of a range of distinct abnormalities such as reduced cortical thickness, abnormal neuronal migration, synaptic disturbance between neural cells, mental retardation and microcephaly and an accumulation of cell death. Ionizing radiation causes direct and indirect cellular effects, partially by targeting the DNA damage structure or signal transduction pathways. These pathways may consequently induce cell cycle arrest, aberrant mitosis and necrotic/apoptotic cell death in a dose-dependent manner.7 Following radiation exposure, DNA is recognized by the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (Atm) serine/threonine protein kinase.8 Atm activates multiple targets that in turn regulate DNA double-strand break repair, induce cell cycle delay/arrest or trigger a pro-apoptotic cascade.9 Cell cycle arrest induced at different cell cycle checkpoints is important to allow genetic repair or subsequent induction of cell death. Although Atm can activate such a cell cycle checkpoint via Chek2 and Cdc25, a more common system exist that involves p53 activation triggered by an Atm-regulated release of the Mdm2-mediated inhibition on p53 and the downstream activation of p21.9Under normal conditions the oncogene protein p53, encoded by the Trp53 gene, is a short-lived protein that is maintained at low levels in the cell. Radiation exposure-triggered pathways activate four proteins—including Mdm2 and Cyclin G1—leading to the formation of an intricate complex that regulates p53 activity.10 Active p53 induces the transcription of several downstream genes that in turn can trigger a variety of biological processes such as cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, DNA repair, replicative senescence and differentiation.11 One of the downstream mechanisms involves the p53-mediated transcriptional activation of p21, which is encoded by the Cdkna1 gene. It was shown that p21 can arrest the cell cycle progression at the S-phase entry either through inhibition of the intra-G1 cell cycle phase cyclins12–14 or by a combined effect of p21 and 14-3-3σ.15 After the onset of a cell cycle arrest, and depending on the severity of the X-radiation induced damage, p53 may activate DNA repair genes or downstream intermediates, such as Bcl2, Bax and Caspase3, to induce apoptosis.16 Although the exact mechanisms are not yet fully understood, studies of Trp53 null and Trp53 mutated cells have shown that other X-irradiation triggered mechanisms independently of Trp53 exist, which may also lead to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.12,13,17–20While prenatal irradiation is a known risk-factor for adult neurological defects, most of the earlier performed global gene-expression studies that analyse ionizing radiation exposure were performed on adult brain tissues or haematopoietic cell populations.20–22 For instance, Yin et al.22 analysed the effects of both low- (10 cGy) and high-dose (2 Gy) radiation on the adult mouse brain and showed a time- and dose-dependent gene-expression profile. Genes associated with functions such as RNA synthesis and modification, DNA repair, cell cycle, heat shock mechanisms and chromatin structure regulation were primarily modulated 30 min after irradiation. Only 4 h after irradiation, genes involved in protein synthesis, cell growth, migration and maintenance showed a modulated expression. Remarkably, even a low dose of 10 cGy appeared to be sufficient to induce genes involved in stress response, synaptic signalling, DNA repair and cell cycle control.22 Therefore, evaluating the gene expression in the embryo brain after radiation exposure could provide a better view of the radiation responsive mechanisms that occur in vivo. In this way a wide spectrum of known and unknown radio-induced or radio-repressed genes could be found. In our study we first generated an overview of the modulated mechanisms and signalling pathways involved in the early radiation response of the embryonic brain. For this purpose we performed a microarray gene-expression profiling on 22.680 transcripts 3 h after 50 cGy X-irradiation in wild-type (wt) as well as in Trp53 null mutant embryo brains at development day E13. The role of p53 was evaluated, since p53 activity is clearly related with the molecular radiation response.23 Among the many candidate genes identified, we selected a subset of genes involved in distinct radiation responsive pathways for further in depth investigation using quantitative PCR (qPCR) on three biological replicates. As indicated by our results, and although the main radiation induced cellular response is considered to be p53 dependent, cell cycle related genes were modulated at the transcriptional level after exposure to radiation in the Trp53 null mutant.2. Materials and methods2.1. Sample preparationAll animal experiments were handled in agreement with the laboratory animal Belgian legislation (ref. 02-012 of the local ethical commission). Balb/cJ@Rj wild type (+/+, Janvier/Bio-services) and Trp53 null mutant (−/−) in Balb/c background (in-house breeding) were maintained in a normal 12:30/11:30 light cycle. Food and water were available ad libitum. Trp53 wild type and Trp53 null mutant female mice were mated with males of the same genotype from 05:30 am to 09:00 am using automatic time-operated cages. The day at which the presence of the copulating plug was detected was set as day E1.Subsequently, at day E13 pregnant females were whole-body irradiated with 50 cGy at a dose rate of 0.35 Gy/min using a Pantak RX, 250kV–15mA, 1mm Cu filter installation. Two sham-exposed mice were used as controls. Three hours after the irradiation, embryos of both a Trp53 wild type and a Trp53 null mutant genotype were isolated and the brains were microdissected. Both brains and the remaining bodies were snap-freezed in liquid nitrogen. Body tissue samples were used for DNA extraction for Trp53 locus genotyping by PCR using three designed primer sets (Supplementary Table 1 is available at Author Webpage). To eliminate the possible influence of gender on differential gene expression, microarray hybridizations were performed using only female embryo mRNA for all conditions.24 As previously described by Lambert et al.24 sex determination was performed by PCR using the Sry-gene, located on Y chromosome. IL-3 was used as the positive control.242.2. RNA/DNA isolationTotal RNA was isolated using the Trizol method (Invitrogen, USA) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The quantity and quality of the purified RNA was assessed using spectrometry and electrophoretic gel-assay. For PCR genotyping and sex-determination DNA extraction was performed using the High Pure PCR template preparation kit (Roche Diagnostics, USA). The DNA used for DNA fragmentation analysis was extracted according the guidelines of the Wizard Genomic DNA kit (Promega, USA).2.3. Microarray experiments and processingFive micrograms total RNA of each sample were used for hybridization on the microarray. Microarray hybridization and washing steps were processed in the same way as described previously by Mori et al.25 To correct for non-equilibrated dye incorporation, a straight and colour-flipped hybridization was performed for each pair of samples on in-house spotted cDNA microarrays containing 22 680 different clones, including spikes and internal controls (Microarray Facility, VIB-Vlaams Interuniversitair Instituut voor Biotechnologie, Belgium—Author Webpage). After dual laser scanning (Generation III scanner, Amersham Biosciences, UK), image analysis was performed using the ArrayVision software (GE Healthcare, UK). For duplicate and colour-flipped clones, ratios of corrected Cy5 intensity over corrected Cy3 intensity were calculated and deviations in the ratio-intensity plot were smoothened using Lowess-normalization.26 Using a two-sample T-test, significance intervals were calculated based on four intensity values obtained from the two hybridized slides. When multiple clones of the same gene were present, the average intensity and corresponding standard deviation were calculated. Genes with an average value <1.5-fold induction/repression that showed strong differential expression for at least one clone were maintained for selection. Transcripts with a threshold of induction and repression of greater than 1.50- and less than −1.50-fold and ESTs differentially expressed in the original microarray-dataset were screened for annotation based on public databases such as the Unigene database (Author Webpage, 05/2005), the Mouse Genome Institute (MGI, Author Webpage) and Matchminer.27 Only the annotated genes were included for further analysis and clustering in biological significant groups. To evaluate p53 interactions, the selected genes were matched against two publications, which reported analysed genes that contain p53 binding sites on their promoter region (Author Webpage).23,282.4. Two step real-time qPCRThree additional RNA samples were extracted from both wt and Trp53 null mutant embryos, 50 cGy irradiated at E13. A total of 5 µg mRNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA according to the manufacturer's guidelines (Roche Diagnostics, USA). Gene-specific primers were designed using the Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems, USA) and were checked for gene specificity using NCBI Blast (Author Webpage). In presence of SYBR® Green (Eurogentec, Belgium) the primers were used to amplify the expressed cDNA using the ABI 5700 real time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, USA). The amplification of each gene was corrected against the expression level of the house-keeping gene β-actin. The relative quantification of gene expression was calculated using the ΔΔCt comparative method in which ΔΔCt = (Ctsample − Ctref)ctrl − (Ctsample − Ctref)irradiated and where the estimated expression ratio is equal to 2ΔΔCt.29 A one sample T-test was used to statistically analyse the difference of the derived expression ratios of irradiated versus non-irradiated samples.3. Results3.1. MicroarraysSince DNA ladder analysis showed apoptosis 6 h after exposure in wt developing mouse brains at E14 (Supplementary Figure 1 is available at Author Webpage), we hypothesized that radiation responsive gene-expression changes may be observed as early as 3 h after irradiation. The mRNA microarray expression profile of each irradiated embryonic brain was compared with non-irradiated controls of the same developmental stage. At E13, the total numbers of genes differentially expressed with a threshold of >1.5 and <−1.5 were 2785 transcripts including 1150 annotated genes in the wt and 2115 transcripts including 1236 annotated genes in the Trp53 null mutant (Fig. 1). We have chosen to put the threshold level to ±1.50, since most of the interesting genes were analysed using qPCR and in this way the maximum number of potential candidate genes that are involved in the radiation response were obtained. All annotated genes were combined according to their gene-ontology classification in 14 biological groups (Table 1). Based on the involvement in stress response, only groups AII, AIII, AVII, BI, BII and D, of both wt and Trp53 null mutant embryos, were used for the selection of a series of genes (Table 1). The groups AI, AIV, AV, AVI, AVIII, AIX, C and E were excluded from analysis, since they were related to metabolic, cytoskeleton, small molecule/protein binding or transport functions. From the 125 genes ultimately selected in the irradiated wt model, 60 (48%) were upregulated and 65 (52%) downregulated at E13. From the 130 differentially expressed selected genes in the irradiated Trp53 null mutant, 45 (35%) were upregulated and 85 (65%) downregulated. To further study the modulated mechanism found after radiation exposure, a subset of the previously selected genes was then used for qPCR.Process of selection for genes differentially expressed in the E13 wild-type (+/+) and Trp53 null mutant (−/−) embryonic brains.Process of selection for genes differentially expressed in the E13 wild-type (+/+) and Trp53 null mutant (−/−) embryonic brains.Functional Gene Ontology (GO) classification of up- and downregulated (greater than 1.5- and less than −1.5-fold) transcripts as found in the microarray data from 50 cGy irradiated wild type and Trp53 null mutant embryonic brains at E13.Functional Gene Ontology (GO) classification of up- and downregulated (greater than 1.5- and less than −1.5-fold) transcripts as found in the microarray data from 50 cGy irradiated wild type and Trp53 null mutant embryonic brains at E13.3.2. Differential expression of transcripts in the irradiated wild-type embryosA first observation of the differentially expressed genes, selected from the 50 cGy X-irradiated wt embryo at developmental stage E13, pointed to transcripts involved in various cellular functions, such as cell proliferation/DNA modification and cell interaction (AII–AIII), stress response (AVII), cell to cell communication (BI–BII) and development (D). Based on the selection of differentially expressed genes, three major mechanisms that were activated or repressed upon irradiation could be observed. A first set of these overexpressed genes belongs to the known p53 pathway involved in stress response. These genes were Cyclin G1 (Ccng1), mouse double minute 2 gene (Mdm2), transformation related protein 53 inducible nuclear protein 1 (Trp53inp1), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1a (Cdkn1a/p21), transcription factor Max and oncogenes c-Jun and c-Myc. There were 23 differentially expressed transcripts classified as signalling receptors/cytokines/ligands (BI). The two major pathways, which could be identified, involve the insulin growth factor (Igf) family pathway (Igf1, Igf2, Igfbp1, and Igfbp4) and the interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) signalling pathway (Iigp, Ifrd1, Ifi30, Ikbke/IKK-i and Isg20 (Supplementary Table 2 is available at Author Webpage).We have selected a small set of genes from the microarray that were involved in the p53-mediated pathway. These genes were used for further investigation using qPCR, and included Ccng1, Mdm2, Cdkn1a and Trp53inp1, as well as genes that have been suggested to participate in the same p53-dependent pathway, but which were not present on the microarray (Fig. 2A and B). These included Atm, Atr, the checkpoint kinases Chek1/2, P19Arf/Cdkn2a and protein phosphatase 2 subunits Ppp2r2a/b/c/d, Hipk2/3, Trp73 and Trp63. Average qPCR relative fold induction resulting from three independent brain samples of each treatment showed an upregulation of 4.69-fold for Atm, while Atr was downregulated by −11.20-fold (Fig. 2A). Further downstream in the pathway, Chek1 and Chek2 were downregulated by −8.69 and −6.52, respectively. The PP2A-B subunits and P19Arf were differentially expressed and are partners of the same complex that also involves Ccng1/Mdm2. All the PP2A-B subunits were upregulated with Ppp2r2a: 4.57-fold, Ppp2r2b: 21.14-fold, Ppp2r2c: 15.82-fold and Ppp2r2d: 4.18-fold, while P19Arf was downregulated with −7.51-fold. We also analysed the mRNA expression of the p53 family members Trp63 (+2.11-fold) and Trp73 (+1.31-fold), as their molecular function can be complementary to that of p53 (Fig. 2B).30(A and B).

Differential expression of transcripts in the irradiated Trp53 mutant embryosWe chose to include a p53 null mutant embryonic brain for the analysis, since the p53 protein is undoubtfully linked with the molecular response to ionizing radiation. Therefore, similar experimental conditions were used for microarray analysis, to identify modulated transcripts in the irradiated Trp53 mutant embryonic brain. To confirm the inactivity of the main mediated p53 pathway, we analysed the mRNA expression level of Cdkn1a using qPCR. Cdkn1a was not differentially expressed in the irradiated Trp53 null mutant embryo and showed even a slight downregulation with −1.62-fold after irradiation (Fig. 3D). Furthermore, no other known p53-mediated transcripts present in the irradiated wt embryos microarray dataset were modulated in the null mutant dataset. The same biological clusters were applied for the selection of differentially expressed transcripts in the irradiated Trp53 null mutant (Table 1). From the biological cluster concerning cell proliferation/DNA modification (AII) there were 32 modulated transcripts, of which 26 were downregulated and directly involved in cell cycle progression. These include the cyclins Ccna2, Ccnb1/2, Ccnd1/3, Ccne1 and the cyclin-dependent kinases Cdc20, Cdc6, Cdca5/8 and Cdk2 (Supplementary Table 3 is available at Author Webpage). The downregulation of numerous cell cycle genes suggests that ionizing radiation has a major effect on cell proliferation, even in Trp53 null mutant mice. In order to better understand this phenomenon we evaluated the expression levels of different cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases using qPCR. These included the genes present on the array as well as seven additional genes. Our qPCR analysis evidenced the strong downregulation of G2 phase cell cycle genes; however, not all genes involved in G1 phase transition showed a downregulated expression (Fig. 3A and B). To further explore the radiation induced cell cycle regulation effects, we evaluated the expression levels of different members of the E2F family of transcription factors. These genes are known to have cell cycle regulating functions. Analysis using qPCR showed a differential expression for the seven E2F family members, suggesting their involvement in this event. Cdc6, E2F6 and E2F7 were downregulated −1.95-fold, −1.93-fold and −3.08-fold, respectively (Fig. 3C). Remarkably, E2F2 and E2F4 were upregulated, 1.97- and 4.53-fold, respectively (Fig. 3C).(A–D) qPCR graphs showing the relative fold expression level (IR/Ctrl) of 15 cell cycle and 7 Atm/p53-mediated transcripts analysed in three independent mutant brain embryos after exposure to 50 cGy X-radiation.

Both genes were downregulated, −3.33-fold for Trp63 and −10.00-fold for Trp73 (Fig. 3D).4. Discussion4.1. Activation of Trp53-dependent transcripts in irradiated wt embryosThe main result from our microarray and qPCR data on irradiated wt embryos was the upregulation of genes involved in the p53-mediated DNA-damage responsive pathway. Although gene-expression analysis of individual or small subsets of these genes has been previously reported in response to radiation, our analysis provides an overview of the different pathways induced by ionizing radiation.31,32We observed using qPCR an upregulated expression for Atm 3 h after irradiation, but not for Atr. This confirms the previously published work that suggests that Atm is required for p53 stabilization and activation after ionizing radiation exposure, while Atr is needed for the same function after UV radiation exposure (Fig. 4).10 It has been proposed that in response to stress, Atm activates in parallel different pathways that function in a p53-dependent and p53-independent manner.33 Although Atm activation could lead to a G1/S phase arrest through Chek2 and Cdc25a, it does not seem the preferred signalling pathway as indicated by the absence of upregulation of these genes in the microarray or qPCR data.33 Our data show however that three mechanisms are triggered by ionizing radiation. The first one involves the Atm mediated activation of Trp53inp1, a recently identified gene that encodes two splice variants (SIP27 and SIP18) and that can regulate p53 activity through Hipk2 (Fig. 4). We suggest that Atm could directly or indirectly regulate SIP18/SIP27 activity in a positive manner and stimulate p53 activity as such after exposure to ionizing radiation.34–36Combined scheme showing irradiation-induced Trp53 molecular signalling pathway according to Kurz et al. (2004); Fei et al. (2003) and Kimura et al.

(2002)9,10,31 The genes associated with the Trp53-dependent radiation response that were modulated in our microarray are indicated (closed triangle, upregulated genes; closed inverted triangle, downregulated genes). Solid arrows represent activation, while blocked lines represent inhibition. Dotted arrows depict hypothesized pathways.However, the main part of our data points towards a second and more studied p53-dependent molecular mechanism. This mechanism is known to be activated in response to ionizing radiation and involves the p53-mediated signal transduction genes Ccng1, Mdm2 and Cdkn1a (Fig. 4). As previously described in studies on neural and tumoral tissue, cyclin G1 or the protein encoded by Ccng1 is activated during normal brain development, but it's expression is increased in response to DNA damage.10,34,35,37,38 The interaction of Cyclin G1 with p53 is mediated in an intricate feedback loop-system in which Ccng1 functions as a transcriptional target of p53 and subsequently regulates the p53 activity.39 Studies using high dose of γ-radiation (10 Gy) treatment showed that cyclin G1 promotes the formation and stabilization of a complex consisting of Mdm2, Cyclin G1 and either P19Arf or the PP2A-B subunits in a time dependent way.10 Dependent on the time after exposure, P19Arf and the PP2A-B subunits regulate p53 activity in a different way.10 Although this kind of model has only been described in high-dose-irradiated cells, we observed an upregulation for Ccng1 and all the four PP2A-B subunits 3 h after irradiation. This suggests that even a dose of 50 cGy is high enough to induce the formation of a complex that consists of the PP2A-B subunits in brain cells (Fig. 4).10 Furthermore, it is known that overexpression of Ccng1-transcripts can induce a delayed S- and G2/M-phase cell cycle arrest by impairing p53 activity, as shown after a 1Gy radiation dose.40 This may actually be the case in our model since such effect can be further evidenced by the downstream upregulation of Cdkn1a. Cdkn1a can inhibit cell cycle progression at two cell cycle checkpoints. The downregulation of Ccnd2, Ccnd3 and Cdk5 however may indicate that the preferential target is the G1/S phase checkpoint and not the G2/M phase checkpoint.14,41A third suggested mechanism that can be activated by Atm in response to radiation in the embryonic brain is mediated by the p53 family members p63 and p73 (Fig. 4).42 Although, the exact role of these genes in the radiation response is still elusive, they are known to play a role in the processes of cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and development.43,44 The upregulated expression of Trp63 and Trp73 suggests that after irradiation there is a well-coordinated balance of p53, p63 and p73 activation in the wt embryonic brain, which may be essential for eliminating damaged brain cells. Together with the p53-mediated response, the irradiated embryonic brain is also characterized by the induction of a spectrum of inflammatory factors, which may moderate the radiation induced negative effects in neural cells. Although the global effects of these cellular inflammatory pathways are not discussed in detail, it is known that the survival of neurons and possibly also their support cells relies partially on a multifactoral support of autocrine/paracrine functions of such neurotrophic factors by which—even in absence of an individual factor—maximal survival is ensured.45,46 Upregulation of these inflammatory pathway intermediates may relate to a direct radiation induced response and with the invasion of inflammatory cells among damaged neural cells.47 However, DNA fragmentation analysis showed increased levels of apoptosis in developing brain, suggesting that this combined activation of protective mechanisms seems to be not sufficient against the strong Trp53-dependent pro-apoptotic and IFN-γ pro-inflammation signal in the majority of cells.4.2. Cell cycle related transcripts are downregulated in irradiated Trp53 mutant embryosUsing our data, we first identified whether the presence of a p53 binding site in the promoter region could be an indication of the difference in radiation response between wt and Trp53 null mutant embryos. Therefore, we compared our selected genes with two lists of putative p53 interacting genes identified with p53 binding capacities based on their molecular sequence using a computational approach.23,28 Analysis of our selected dataset revealed that 41 (33%) genes in the wt embryo and 52 (29%) genes in the Trp53 null mutant embryo had potential p53 binding sites in their promoter region. From this selection, 54% in the wt embryo and only 35% in the Trp53 null mutant embryo were upregulated. The downregulated p53 interacting genes (65%) in the Trp53 null mutant indicate that p53 and p53-mediated mechanisms are the main activation targets after ionizing radiation exposure (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3 are available at Author Webpage).Despite the absence of apoptosis in the X-irradiated Trp53 null mutant embryos 6 h after exposure to ionizing radiation, our qPCR data showed the induction of several other stress response mechanisms.48–50 First, to confirm the inactivity of p53-mediated mechanisms in our null mutant model, we evaluated the expression levels of seven p53 up- and downstream genes using qPCR. Although the upregulation of Atm indicates the induction of DNA damage by ionizing radiation, downregulation of the p53 downstream gene Cdkn1a (Fig. 3D) suggests that the p53-dependent mechanisms are not activated in the irradiated Trp53 null mutant embryonic brain. Therefore the p53-mediated pathway could not be directly responsible for the downregulation of the observed cell cycle regulating genes. As most of these genes are considered to be post-translationally modified, it still seems that p53 controls their transcription at a basal level.51,52In the Trp53 null mutant embryo we also analysed the expression of Trp63 and Trp73, as they can replace Trp53 in stress response. As described above, both genes have distinct developmental functions, and a loss of p73 activity has been related to hippocampus dysgenesis, which in turn is due to a loss of reelin-producing Cajal-Retzius neurons.53 Downregulation of these two genes in the irradiated Trp53 null mutant brain suggests not only that p53 is essential for their activity in the developing brain, but that they also are regulated in a negative feedback loop-system.4,54,55 However, further research should be conducted to clarify the exact role of these genes in the onset of developmental defects.Although there is no evidence for increased levels of apoptosis after irradiation in the p53 null mutant embryo brain at E13, transcriptional evidence showed the occurrence of increased numbers of cells that exhibit a proliferative arrest in the irradiated tissue. This is indicated by the observed downregulation of various cyclins, Cdks and Cdc genes in the analysed embryos (Fig. 3A and B). Different gene-products, mediating independently of p53, have the ability to break the formed Cyclin/Cdk complexes or inhibit their formation (Fig. 5).12,13 It has been shown that ionizing radiation may trigger this event in multitude of cells and induce a G1 or G2 phase cell cycle arrest.37,56,57 The downregulation of cell cycle G1 and G2 phase genes in our microarray and qPCR initially suggests that the cell proliferation arrest is not limited to a specific phase of the cell cycle or is not specifically dependent on p53 activity.58 However, a further in depth qPCR study showed that mainly cell cycle G2 phase genes were downregulated and not those of the G1 phase.The combined scheme, according to Vermeulen et al. (2003) and Pawlik and Keyomarsi (2004), showing the genes essential for normal cell cycle progression and the genes that may jeopardize this progression.12,13,57 The genes associated with the mammalian cell cycle that were modulated in our microarray are indicated (closed triangle, upregulated genes; closed inverted triangle, downregulated genes).

Solid arrows represent activation, while blocked lines represent inhibition. Dotted arrows depict putative pathways.A first group of genes that could be responsible for the induction of the cell cycle arrest are the different members of the E2F transcription factor family (Fig. 5). E2F factors are known to control the cell cycle by regulating transcription of various growth-related genes such as Cdc2, Cdc6, Cdk2, Cyclin E and E2F1.59 Each of the E2F family members has distinct cell cycle repressing or inducing activities. Using qPCR, we observed the downregulation of Cdc6, E2F6 and E2F7 and the upregulation of E2F2 and E2F4 in the irradiated Trp53 null mutant embryo brain (Fig 3D). However, the exact mechanism of the E2F factors is not completely understood. Robles et al.60 reported that Cdc6 is an important factor with a dual role in regulating both G1/S and G2/S cell cycle checkpoints and that E2F factors regulate Cdc6 expression to control cell cycle progression. Since E2F4 has been stated responsible for the induction of growth arrest in mammalian cells,61 we suggest that the elevated expression level of E2F4 after irradiation may be responsible for the downregulation of Cdc6 and possibly of other E2F target genes. Furthermore, as Takahashi et al.62 reported, pRb together with the E2F4 factor may lead to the downregulation of E2F factors or the repression of E2F target genes to result in the onset of cellular senescence or growth arrest.Similar to the wt embryonic brain, different members of the pro-inflammatory signalling pathway showed induction in response to ionizing radiation in the Trp53 null mutant. The observed induction of IFN-γ related transcripts that were observed in our microarray data included Icsbp1, Isg20 and Iigp. As such, these mechanisms could function as an additional, though subtle, system for stress response, mediated independently of p53. Also, various development-related transcripts were downregulated, including Hoxa7, Hoxb3, Hoxb6, Hoxc5, Hoxd8 and Fzd4 (frizzled-4). Although the gene expression was not investigated further, their downregulation may relate to the described cognitive defects after radiation exposure of embryos.In summary, the initial aim of the study was to better understand the basic underlying molecular mechanisms that are activated in vivo by radiation exposure in the developing brain. Previously performed studies on atomic bomb survivors have shown that in utero irradiated children have a higher incidence for late neurological defects, such as mental retardation and decreased IQ levels.4 To expand the knowledge that is available on the early transcriptional radiation response, and since p53 is indisputably connected with the stress response, we analysed the modulated gene expression of the whole developing brain of wt and Trp53 null mutant embryos exposed to 50 cGy of ionizing radiation. The results on the irradiated wt embryos not only confirmed the importance of a p53-mediated stress response, but also provided a range of other candidate genes that may participate to produce stress response. In the Trp53 null mutant embryo, we observed other pathways leading to a cell cycle arrest without the observed onset of apoptosis. This shows that several ionizing radiation triggered mechanisms may be activated in parallel or may circumvent each other. These mechanisms were analysed in the present study at their transcriptional level on whole embryonic brains. Therefore, further study should be performed on homogeneous neuron or glial cell cultures in order to elucidate the cell type dependent contribution of the tissue reported effect.The authors thank Dr P.

IntroductionGenomic analyses, such as comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), genotyping of polymorphic loci and detection of disease gene mutations, are important in genomic medicine and forensic science. For example, CGH of cancer genomes has identified recurrent copy number aberrations of likely pathogenic significance,1 certain genotypes are associated with altered disease susceptibility2 and genotyping of highly polymorphic short tandem repeats (STR) is the most widely used method of human identification.3Genomic techniques require nanogram to microgram quantities of genomic DNA (gDNA). Hence, DNA samples of insufficient quantity must be pre-amplified before the actual genomic analysis can be performed. Multiple displacement amplification (MDA),4,5 a widely used whole genome amplification (WGA) method, is efficient (>1000-fold amplification) and yields minimally biased representation from sub-nanogram quantities of fresh undegraded gDNA. However, MDA performs poorly on degraded gDNA.5Other WGA methods are mainly, though not entirely, PCR based. Degenerate oligonucleotide-based PCR (DOP-PCR),6 primer extension preamplification7 and ligation-mediated PCR8 are known to introduce copy number bias of dispersed genomic regions. Balanced PCR amplification,9 restriction and circularization-aided rolling circle amplification,10 and the OmniPlex™11 methods require substantial enzymatic manipulations that may be impractical with very small starting samples.We have adapted an isothermal method originally developed for DNA labelling12 but which also amplifies input DNA.13 Our modified method uses a primer that is selected after parsing the human genome for oligomer sequences that have maximum genome coverage with minimal overlaps (A. E. H. Png, K. W. Choo, C. I. P. Lee, S. H. Leong and O. L. Kon, manuscript in preparation). The method we describe here performs better than other current techniques on gDNA from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sources and degraded gDNA.2. Materials and methods2.1. gDNA sources and extractionSources of gDNA were peripheral human blood, fresh and FFPE Hs 746T tumour tissue. Tumours were generated by subcutaneously implanting Hs746T human gastric cancer cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA) in scid mice. Excised Hs 746T tumours were fresh frozen at −80°C or fixed in neutral buffered 10% formalin for 16 h at room temperature and dehydrated in increasing ethanol concentrations (70–100%), followed by three changes each of absolute ethanol, xylene and paraffin. gDNA was extracted from blood and the fresh tumour using the Blood & Cell Culture DNA kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany), according to the manufacturer's protocol except for the following modification for tumour tissue. Ground tissue (300 mg) was incubated for 16–18 h at 50°C in 19 ml Buffer G2 and at least one additional aliquot (0.5 ml) of Qiagen Protease solution was added during this period to obtain a clear lysate.DNA was extracted from tissue cores (1 mm diameter, total weight of cores 0.5 mg) prepared from paraffin blocks of Hs 746T tumour using the PUREGENE® DNA Purification Tissue Kit (Gentra Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol with the following modification. De-paraffinized tissue was incubated with cell lysis solution at 65°C for 60 min with shaking (300 r.p.m.). gDNA was quantified by absorbance at 260 nm and used if the ratio of absorbance at 260 nm/280 nm was 1.8–2.0.2.2. PrimersThe following primers were used: (i) NYP (Nanyang Polytechnic) primer, 5′-NNNTGAGAT-3′; (ii) random octamers and (iii) DOP-PCR primer, 5′-CCGACTCGAGNNNNNNATGTGG-3′.6 The sequence TGAGAT of the NYP primer was bioinformatically selected for its predicted ability to generate 2–3 kb amplicons uniformly distributed throughout the human genome.2.3. DNA amplificationTwo methods were used. DOP-PCR using the 22-base primer was performed with 40 ng DNA, 2 µM primer, 4 × 200 µM dNTPs, 1.5 mM MgCl2 and 5 U AmpliTaq Gold® DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) in a reaction volume of 0.1 ml. Thermal cycling conditions were 94°C × 9 min, 9 cycles of 94°C × 1 min/30°C × 1.5 min/72°C × 3 min, 30 cycles of 94°C × 1 min/62°C × 1 min/72°C × 1.5 min and a final extension of 8 min at 72°C. DOP-PCR using NYP primer was performed with 40 ng DNA, 2 µM primer, 4 × 200 µM dNTPs, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 2 units DyNAzyme™ EXT DNA polymerase (Finnzymes Oy, Espoo, Finland) in a reaction volume of 0.1 ml. Thermal cycling conditions were 94°C × 5 min, 40 cycles of 94°C × 1 min/22°C × 1 min/0.1°C per second transition to 72°C/72°C × 1 min and a final extension of 8 min at 72°C. Two more units of DyNAzyme™ EXT DNA polymerase were added to the reaction immediately after completion of the 20th cycle. Amplified DNA was purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen).Isothermal primer extension amplification12 was performed by modification of the BioPrime DNA Labeling system (Invitrogen Corporation, USA). A total of 300 ng gDNA were denatured in the presence of 15 µg random octamers or NYP primer by heating to 99°C for 10 min and were snap-cooled on ice. Klenow polymerase (40 U) and 0.12 mM each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP and dTTP were added to the chilled mixture in a total reaction volume of 50 µl. The reaction was incubated at 37°C for 14–16 h. DNA was purified using a Microcon YM-30 centrifugal filter unit (Millipore Corp., USA).2.4. DNA labellingUnamplified gDNA and gDNA pre-amplified by primer extension for chromosome CGH were labelled with fluorescein-12-dUTP (test DNA) or Texas Red-5-dUTP (reference DNA) using the Invitrogen's Nick Translation System according to the manufacturer's protocol to obtain 500–2000 bp labelled fragments.DNA samples for BAC array CGH were labelled with Cyanine 3-dUTP (Cy 3-dUTP for test DNA) or Cyanine 5-dUTP (Cy 5-dUTP for reference DNA) using the BioPrime DNA Labeling System (Invitrogen) and the supplier's protocol. All fluorophore-labelled deoxynucleotides were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (USA). DNA was purified after labelling with Microcon YM-30 centrifugal filter units.2.5. CGHChromosome CGH was performed as described previously.14 One microgram each of Hs 746T and reference gDNA (from fresh lymphocytes or paraffin cores of healthy male spleen) were labelled with fluorescein-12-dUTP and Texas Red-5-dUTP, respectively. Labelled DNA and 20 µg Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen) were co-precipitated with ethanol and dissolved in 10 µl hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate and 2× SSC). The probe mixture was denatured (74°C for 6 min) and hybridized to normal metaphase chromosomes (prepared from phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral lymphocytes using standard protocols) that had been denatured (74°C for 2 min) in 70% formamide/2× SSC and dehydrated in an ethanol series. After a 48 h hybridization, slides were washed once in 50% formamide/2× SSC (10 min), twice in 2× SSC and once in 0.1× SSC (all 5 min each, at 45°C), followed by 1× PBD buffer [12 mM NaHCO3 containing 0.5% (v/v) NP-40] and deionized water at room temperature (5 min each). Slides were mounted in antifade solution with 0.1 µg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI).BAC array CGH was performed on 2464-clone arrays (each clone spotted in triplicate) from the University of California San Francisco Comprehensive Cancer Center Microarray Core. Hybridization was performed as detailed in the ‘Array CGH Hybridization Protocol’ (Author Webpage). Briefly, gDNA was digested for 5 h with DpnII (New England Biolabs, USA), purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit and labelled as described above. Labelled reference and test DNAs (3–4 µg each) were co-precipitated with 35 µg human Cot-1 DNA. The precipitate was collected by high-speed centrifugation, air-dried and re-dissolved in a final volume of 0.1 ml 1× SSC containing 70% formamide (extra pure grade, Merck KgaA, Germany), 3.4% SDS (Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA) and 5 mg dextran sulfate (sodium salt, MW 500 000, Sigma Chemical Co., USA). DNA was denatured at 73°C for 12 min and snap-cooled before applying to the array slide on which a plastic frame seal (2.3 cm2, Fisher Scientific, USA) had been placed firmly around the region of spotted BAC clones. The array slide was pre-wetted with 50 µl 2× SSC containing 20 mg dextran sulfate and 50% formamide (pre-hybridization solution pre-warmed to 37°C). After the entire array surface was wet, 20 µl of the pre-hybridization solution was withdrawn and the denatured combined reference and test DNA solution (0.1 ml) was quickly applied on the array. The assembled hybridization array slide was placed in a humidified and well-sealed slide chamber box. Uniform hybridization was achieved by rocking the slide on a tilting platform (2 oscillations/min) at 37°C for 72 h. The position of the array slide with respect to the tilting axis was moved by consecutive 90° turns at 24 h intervals.Post-hybridization washing in dim light was performed in the following sequence: (i) 50% formamide in 2× SSC, pH 7 for 15 min at 50°C; (ii) 0.1 M Na2HPO4 containing 0.1% Nonidet P40, pH 8 for 15 min at room temperature; (iii) 2× SSC for 2 min; (iv) 70%, 85% and absolute ethanol, each for 2 min. The slide was dried by centrifugation (130× g for 2 min) before scanning.2.6. Imaging and analysisDAPI, fluorescein and Texas Red images were captured from 8–10 metaphases on chromosome CGH slides using a fluorescence microscope and a charge-coupled device camera. Digital images were analysed by the CV Chromofluor system (Applied Imaging, UK) using 99% standard reference intervals. The mean fluorescence ratio exceeded 1.2 in regions of gain and was below 0.8 in regions of loss. High-level amplifications were chromosomal regions with mean ratios >1.5.Array CGH slides were scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner (Axon Instruments, USA) after adjusting the count ratio of channel 1/channel 2 to 1. TIFF images were analysed using the SPOT program, which segmented the spots, performed local background subtraction and generated log2 ratio data of Cy 3/Cy 5 intensities for each spot.15 SPOT output data were further processed using the SPROC program (Author Webpage), which generated the mean log2 Cy 3/Cy 5 ratio of triplicate spots for each BAC clone that survived quality constraints. SPOT and SPROC data files were exported to a custom program, NEAT, which generated an average intensity grid by grid plot for Cy 3 and Cy 5 to visually inspect hybridization quality and accuracy of the initial count ratio. Cy3/Cy5 ratios were normalized by total intensity normalization and normalized ratio plots were generated for every chromosome. The thresholds for amplification and deletions were +0.33 and −0.33, which are the log2 transformed values corresponding to ratios of 1.25 and 0.75, respectively, of chromosome CGH.2.7. STR analysisControl and whole genome amplified DNA were profiled using the commercial AmpFISTR® Identifiler® PCR Amplification Kit (Applied Biosystems) and the supplied protocol. This kit allows amplification/detection of 15 STR loci comprising 13 US CODIS (COmbinded DNA Index System) loci, D2S1338, D19S433 and the gender-determining locus amelogenin. All genotyping reactions were performed on a GeneAmp 9700 PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Where necessary, DNA template quantity was modified for PCR optimization. PCR products were separated by capillary electrophoresis in an ABI PRISM® 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). One microlitre of PCR product was injected at 1 kV for 22 s with the minimum allele detection threshold set at 50 relative fluorescence units.2.8. Mutation detectionA total of 50 ng of lymphocyte gDNA was amplified by primer extension using NYP primer as described above (‘DNA amplification’) followed by purification using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit. PCR with gene-specific primers (forward primer 5′-GTACGGCTGTCATCACTTAGACCTCA-3′; reverse primer 5′-TCCCATAGACTCACCCTGAA-3′; 2 µM each) was performed on 200 ng of amplified gDNA. Other reaction conditions were 0.8 mM dNTPs, 1.5 mM MgCl2 and 0.02 U DyNAzyme EXT DNA polymerase. Thermal cycling conditions were 94°C for 2 min followed by 30 cycles of 94°C × 30 s/55°C × 30 s/72°C × 60 s and a terminal extension for 10 min at 72°C.A second PCR using a nested reverse primer (5′-TGCAGCTTGTCACAGTGCAGCTCACT-3′) was performed on 1 µl of the completed first reaction product to yield a single 602 bp DNA fragment, which was resolved by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose and extracted using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen). This was sequenced using the CEQ Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Quick Start Kit (Beckman Coulter, USA) according to the supplied protocol. After 30 cycles, 5 µl of stop solution/glycogen mixture (1.2 M sodium acetate, 40 mM disodium EDTA and 4 mg glycogen/ml) was added and the sample was ethanol precipitated, vacuum dried for 3 min and resuspended in 20 µl of the provided sample loading solution before loading on the CEQ capillary sequencer (Beckman Coulter).2.8. Statistical testsThe significance of differences in variance and differences in proportion of outlier clones were determined using Levene's and Fisher's exact tests, respectively (SPSS statistical analysis software, Chicago, USA).3. ResultsFigure 1 is a comparison of copy number profiles obtained by chromosome CGH after amplification using two different primers. The sample in each experiment was lymphocyte gDNA from the same normal healthy male amplified by DOP-PCR using the bioinformatically optimized NYP primer, 5′-NNNTGAGAT-3′, or the widely used primer of Telenius et al.6 5′-CCGACTCGAGNNNNNNATGTGG-3′. WGA products were labelled with fluorescein-12-dUTP while the cognate unamplified gDNA was labelled with Texas Red-5-dUTP by nick translation. Self–self hybridization of unamplified and DOP-PCR amplified gDNA showed that WGA products generated using NYP primer resulted in false deletions in only 2 chromosomes, without any spurious copy number gains (Figure 1, upper panel). In contrast, DOP-PCR using the primer of Telenius et al.6 resulted in major false deletions in no fewer than 11 chromosome arms (Figure 1, lower panel).Comparison of genomic representation after WGA using NYP (upper panel) or Telenius (lower panel) primer in DOP-PCR. Each panel shows chromosomal CGH self–self hybridization. The same gDNA was used in each experiment. It was extracted from normal lymphocytes of a healthy male. In each CGH experiment, unamplified gDNA was hybridized against itself after DOP-PCR amplification (i.e. unamplified self versus amplified self). Chromosomal CGH was performed as described previously.14 A colour version of Figure 1 can be found online as supplementary data at Author WebpageComparison of genomic representation after WGA using NYP (upper panel) or Telenius (lower panel) primer in DOP-PCR.

The extent of gDNA amplification by primer extension was inversely related to the amount of input DNA. About 5500-fold amplification was achieved when input DNA was 1 ng. With 10 and 50 ng input gDNA, the amplification factors were 580 and 144, respectively. The size of WGA products ranged from 200 to >23 kb (Figure 2).Agarose gel electrophoresis of primer extension amplification products showing varying amounts of fresh gDNA input, DNA size standards and amplification factors.Agarose gel electrophoresis of primer extension amplification products showing varying amounts of fresh gDNA input, DNA size standards and amplification factors.We next compared copy number profiles of unamplified gDNA extracted from fresh frozen Hs 746T tumour tissue (Figure 3A) with unamplified gDNA extracted from the same tumour after formalin fixation and paraffin embedding (FFPE) (Figure 3B) to determine the extent to which tissue preservation alone affects CGH analysis. Reference gDNA was unamplified fresh human lymphocyte gDNA (Figure 3A) or unamplified human spleen gDNA extracted from paraffin blocks (Figure 3B). Figure 3A and B show similar copy number profiles but with several discordant aberrations i.e. spurious copy number losses of 5q, 10p, 12q, 18p and 19q; spurious copy number gain of 20p; and failure to detect 9p loss in CGH of gDNA extracted from FFPE tissue. As neither gDNA sample in Figure 3A and B was amplified, these discrepant copy number changes were most likely due to effects of chemical fixation and embedding on the quality of extracted gDNA e.g. DNA–protein cross-linking and DNA degradation. We proceeded to determine the fidelity of copy number analysis after amplifying gDNA from FFPE Hs 746T tumour tissue. A total of 50 ng of gDNA from FFPE Hs 746T tumour tissue and FFPE normal human spleen (reference DNA) was amplified by primer extension using NYP primer followed by fluorescence labelling using nick translation. Figure 3C shows that the copy number profile of amplified gDNA from FFPE tissue largely replicates the true aberrations of unamplified gDNA prepared from fresh Hs 746T tumour tissue. Copy number gains in 1p, 3pq, 6q, 7q, 8q, 9q, 10q, 11q, 14q and 17q were replicated in gDNA from fixed tumour tissues, as were copy number losses in 1q, 2pq, 4q, 8p, 13q, 15q, 16p, 20p, 21q and 22q. Certain copy number abnormalities, however, only appeared in CGH of amplified gDNA prepared from FFPE tumour tissue (i.e. deletions of 5q, 10p, 12q and 19q; gain of 20q) while gain of 7p and loss of 9p detected in fresh tumour tissue were not detected in gDNA from FFPE tissue. However, most of these apparently artefactual findings were present already in unamplified gDNA extracted from FFPE tissues, i.e. deletions of 5q, 10p, 12q, 18p and gain of 20q (Figure 3B), and cannot be attributed to quantitatively skewed representation caused by WGA.Primer extension amplification using NYP primer replicates copy number aberrations of unamplified tumour gDNA. cCGH of a xenotumour (Hs 746T) using (A) unamplified gDNA extracted from fresh frozen tissue; (B) unamplified gDNA from FFPE tissue of the same tumour and (C) gDNA from FFPE tumour tissue amplified with NYP primer.

We therefore compared the quality of amplified gDNA generated by primer extension amplification performed with NYP primer or random octamers by hybridization with a 2464 BAC clone array. Figure 4 compares normalized log2 Cy3/Cy5 ratios of self–self hybridizations in which normal human lymphocyte gDNA was amplified using NYP primer (upper panel) or random octamers (lower panel). Copy number analysis across the human genome showed significantly less scatter around the zero value (signifying balanced copy number) when WGA was performed with NYP primer compared with random octamers (P < 0.0001 for the difference between variances using Levene's test). Although both datasets included outlier signals, defined as log2 greater than +0.33 or less than −0.33 that falsely signified copy number gain or loss, respectively, there were only 18 such outliers in NYP-primed WGA compared with 65 outliers in random octamer-primed WGA (Table 1, P < 0.0001, Fisher's exact test). We observed that outlier clones did not cluster in genomic regions but were instead uniformly dispersed in all chromosomes.Primer extension WGA using NYP primer (upper panel) and random octamers (lower panel) compared for artefactually biased representation.

WGA using NYP primer generated significantly fewer false copy number changes (P < 0.0001, Fisher's exact test).We next evaluated the performance of primer extension amplification on degraded gDNA for STR genotyping. Normal human lymphocyte gDNA was digested with DNase I for 2–30 min to generate five different size ranges: (i) 1500–3000 bp, (ii) 800–1500 bp, (iii) 500–800 bp, (iv) 200–500 bp and (v) <200 bp (Figure 5). DNA in each range was gel purified after electrophoresis on 1% agarose and used as the input template for primer extension amplification using NYP primer or random octamers (Figure 6). Figure 7 shows the genotype profile obtained at 15 STR loci and amelogenin X–Y with whole genome amplified DNA generated by NYP primer (panel B) or random octamers (panel C). Compared with reference undegraded gDNA (Figure 7A), 9, 9 and 8 loci were successfully detected in gDNA that had been degraded to 1500–3000 bp, 800–1500 bp (Figure 7B) and 500–800 bp, respectively, and then whole genome amplified with the NYP primer. Seven loci (D8S1179, D3S1358, D19S322, vWA, D13S317, D5S818 and amelogenin) were detected in all three degraded DNA samples. Genotyping of WGA products was not associated with imbalance at biparental alleles if sufficient amplified gDNA was used, and did not increase stutter peaks. In contrast, genotyping the same degraded gDNA after MDA was uniformly unsuccessful in all size ranges and severe imbalances at heterozygous loci were observed (Figure 7D).DNase-digested gDNA was fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis into five different size bands: (i) 1500–3000 bp; (ii) 800–1500 bp; (iii) 500–800 bp; (iv) 200–500 bp; (v) <200 bp.

DiscussionWe have reported a simple isothermal WGA method based on primer extension that performs well for several different genomic analyses, i.e. chromosomal and BAC array CGH, STR genotyping and single base mutation detection. The method is tolerant of degraded DNA and works well on DNA extracted from fixed tissues. It does not require specially modified primers (unlike MDA), ligation steps (unlike balanced PCR, ligation-mediated PCR and rolling circle amplification techniques) or library construction (unlike Omniplex technology).Parsing the complete human genome sequence made it possible to identify a short primer sequence that is uniformly distributed throughout the entire human genome, thus favouring uniform amplification while at the same time having minimal overlap to avoid over-amplifying certain regions. We further specified that, if used as a primer for PCR-based WGA, the selected sequence should amplify products of 2–3 kb. The hexamer, TGAGAT, met all these criteria but was efficient in priming gDNA only when the 5′ end was extended by three degenerate bases. Hence, the WGA primer we used for DOP-PCR and for primer extension amplification was 5′-NNNTGAGAT-3′.WGA products obtained by DOP-PCR using NYP primer gave minimal deviations from a balanced copy number profile in self–self hybridization on chromosome CGH compared with DOP-PCR with the widely used primer of Telenius et al.6 that yielded multiple regions of spurious deletions (Figure 1). Identical self–self hybridizations on BAC array CGH also showed that, compared with random octamers, NYP primer generated a more representative and less biased amplification of gDNA (Figure 4).Although isothermal random primer extension is commonly employed for DNA labelling, it has not been fully investigated as a method for WGA. Our data showed that this reaction could amplify gDNA by several thousand times (Figure 2), confirming an earlier study.13gDNA extracted from FFPE tissues is notoriously difficult to be amplified and analysed using molecular techniques probably because of DNA cross-linking and degradation. We were motivated to test our approach on FFPE tissue because archived human tissues in paraffin blocks are a rich research resource. Our results show that the major characteristic copy number abnormalities can be reproduced in gDNA extracted from FFPE tissue although the process of tissue preservation itself, independent of WGA, introduces artefactual copy number alterations (Figure 3A and B). Despite this, reasonable fidelity of copy number profile was achieved in gDNA amplified with NYP primer from FFPE tumour tissue compared with the same freshly frozen tumour tissue (Figure 3A and C).Other potentially useful applications of WGA are in forensic science and genetic diagnosis, where samples are frequently of poor quality or available in minute quantities. We were able to genotype DNA that had been degraded to 500–800 bp at a minimum of six standard simple tandem repeat loci using 8 ng of amplified gDNA representing 56 pg of original degraded input DNA, giving a conservatively estimated power of discrimination of 0.999998.16,17 Primers designed to generate smaller amplicons of STR loci have been shown to successfully genotype DNA degraded to <126 bp when standard methods fail.18 Such an approach, combined with primer extension WGA, should be useful in situations requiring the analysis of highly degraded DNA.In summary, we have shown that primer extension amplification using a bioinformatically optimized universal primer is a simple and efficient isothermal method for WGA. The same primer can also be used for PCR-based genome amplification and achieves less biased amplification than a widely used DOP-PCR primer.6 Isothermal primer extension amplification does not require extensive sample processing and manipulation or chemically modified primers. The method we have described performed well in chromosome and BAC array CGH using gDNA from both fresh and archived tissues. It generated usable STR genotype profiles from degraded gDNA and correctly detected a high proportion of single nucleotide mutations in clinical samples. These performance characteristics should make this method useful for practical application in genome science, genomic medicine and forensic science.The authors thank Dr Alvin Eng for guidance with array CGH experiments, Dr Ann Lee for use of the rocker platform, Dr Patrick Tan for use of the Axon GenePix scanner, Dr Balram Chowbay's laboratory for assistance in sequencing and Mark EH Tan for statistical analysis.

IntroductionThe presence of repeated sequences is a common feature for both eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes. It has been suggested that the repeats themselves produce unusual physical structures in the DNA, causing polymerase slippage and the resulting amplification.1,2 The other potential role for tandem repeats is gene regulation, in which the repeats may interact with transcription factors, alter the structure of the chromatin or act as protein binding sites.3,4 In the last few years, tandem repeats have been increasingly recognized as markers of choice for genotyping a number of pathogens.5–7 The rapid evolution of these structures appears to contribute to the phenotypic flexibility of pathogens.Tandem repeats are usually classified among satellites (spanning megabases of DNA, associated with heterochromatin), minisatellites (repeat units in the range 6–10 bp, spanning hundreds of base pairs) and microsatellites (repeat units in the range 2–5 bp, spanning a few tens of nucleotides).8 Microsatellites or simple sequence repeats (SSRs) are tandemly repeated DNA sequences found in varying abundance in most genomes.9,10 These repeats have been extensively used for genetic mapping and population studies.11 Microsatellites are frequently polymorphic with the number of repeat units varying between organisms. The polymorphism associated with tandem repeats has been used in mammalian genetics for the construction of genetic maps and still is the basis of DNA fingerprinting in forensic applications. Polymorphic minisatelites are also found in bacterial genomes.8The availability of whole-genome sequences has opened the way to the systematic evaluation of tandem repeats diversity and application to epidemiological studies.8 More recently, a number of studies12,13 have confirmed the idea that tandem repeats reminiscent of minisatellites and microsatellites are likely to be a significant source of very informative markers for the identification of pathogenic bacteria.Once repeats are identified, the central task becomes the clustering of tandem repeats into families, i.e. repeats that occur in different locations in a genome but have identical or very similar underlying patterns. Grouping these repeats will facilitate identification and study of their common properties. Tandem repeat families have been detected in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, including the Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans and human genomes.14 Analyzing the mutational history of tandem repeats requires utilizing the pattern of mutations among adjacent copies to describe the interwoven progression of substitutions, indels and duplication/excision events leading from a single copy of the pattern to the present day sequence. Such histories can suggest how the boundaries and size of the duplication unit vary and may reveal details about the duplication mechanism.15Among the best programs for finding the tandem repeats are Tandem Repeats Finder15 and mreps.16 Although they overcome some limitations of other algorithms, they have their own, limitations, namely the size of the pattern (Tandem Repeat Finder) and too rigid pattern definition (mreps). Since the results of these methods depend strongly on the homology of the DNA regions, they cannot be used to identify the fuzzy periodicity and ancient minisatellites.A number of public tandem repeat databases are available now. To name a few, a database of bacterial genomes,8 a short tandem repeat DNA database,17 TRDB15 and TRbase.18 The methods and programs described in the previous paragraphs are used to fill such databases in most cases. In Section 3 we will discuss in detail the advantages and drawbacks of the existing methods.This paper has the following goals. The first goal is to identify the potential minisatellites with the method of Information Decomposition (ID),19 to calculate the periodicity matrices and to classify them. The second goal is to find the new periodic regions (in the presence of insertions and deletions) with the Modified Profile Analysis (MPA)20 approach using the periodicity class matrices found on the previous step.We have chosen bacterial genomes as a target of our study for the following reasons. First, bacterial minisatellites can be used as markers for PCR, so there is a practical application for this work. Second, the mutational history of bacterial genomes is evidently more prolonged than that of eukaryotic genomes, so search for the fuzzy repeats is more complicated, but at the same time can give more insights concerning the biological role of ‘ancient’ minisatellites. Third, the comparatively small number of available sequences could result in less number of classes, thus making it easier to explore their properties and to reveal the biological principles standing behind the results of classification process.As we will show in Section 3, our method can reveal the periodical sequences that were not found by the existing software packages.2. Materials and methodsOur search for the potential minisatellites was focused on the bacterial genomes, since their size allows finishing the computations in a reasonable amount of time; since, the periodical sequences found yield the evident practical application, they can be used in PCR analysis. In bacterial genomes it is possible to find the very old or ‘ancient’ microsatellites possessing very fuzzy periodicity, so they can be passed through by the mathematical methods of tandem repeats finding. Yet these ancient sequences are of great biological interest since they are usually highly polymorphous and, thus, can be used as genetic markers.The method proposed in this paper consists of three parts—usage of ID method19 to obtain the initial data, classification of the results found and the usage of MPA for searching the sequences with indels.21 The usage of periodicity classes rather than all periodic sequences found dramatically decreases the searching time for the MPA method. The advantages of using the combination of these methods are: no limitations are placed on the size of the sequence containing the repeated pattern, so the search becomes more versatile; usage of the classification matrices allows us to find even distantly related sequences; although we use the alignment matrices, we do not fill them entirely, which speeds up the calculations even more. And the main advantage is that by using this combination of methods we can find the distantly related repeats and ancient minisatellites possessing very fuzzy periodicity that cannot be revealed by other methods.2.1. Information decompositionThe method of ID is described in detail in ref. (19). Since this method plays an important role in the present study, we also give its thorough description.At first, let us define the concept of latent periodicity of a symbolical sequence.As it was mentioned above, different weights and different Z-values could result in differences in homology level. In some cases, periodicity could be evident using the information measure [formula (4)] and at the same time could be missed by the methods of homology search [formula (3)]. Let us define the probability P that corresponds to Z-value calculated by formulas (3), (1), and (6) as α and define the probability P that corresponds to Z-value calculated by formulas (4), (1), and (6) as β. Let us also assume that the sequence S contains hidden periodicity of length L provided that the probability α > 0.05 and the probability β < 0.05. Suppose that the sequence S contains periodicity related to homology between subsequences Si at α < 0.05 irrespectively of the probability values β. Let us also suppose that the sequence S lacks periodicity of the length L at α and β > 0.05.In practice such a difference in probabilities α and β can be found quite often while analyzing rather long sequence when some set of symbols, not only one, appears at each position of the alignment. In this case, the number of homologous coincidences can be relatively small for each position. Since the weights of homologous coincidences in BLAST or Identity matrices are significantly higher than the weights of non-homologous coincidences, the final value of W can be relatively small for small number of homologous coincidences; this will provide rather high value of α. At the same time, β is determined on the basis of deviations of DNA base frequencies for each position i from the DNA base frequencies determined for the whole sequence S being analyzed. Such deviations can be significant and will result in a small and statistically significant value of β for a high and statistically insignificant value of α.As an example, let us consider two DNA sequences; one of them possesses perfect periodicity whereas the other one has latent periodicity. We determine α and β probabilities using the method of Monte Carlo. For each DNA sequence, we generate 500 random sequences with the same base composition as in the initial ones by means of random shuffling of bases throughout the whole DNA sequence. Using formulas (3) and (1), we calculate the weight W for each of the 500 randomly generated sequences, then determine E(W) and D(W) and finally calculate Z-value by formula (6). We perform the same calculations for the weight determined by formulas (4) and (1). As the result, we will have two Z-values for each DNA sequence: one value has been calculated by formulas (3) and (1) and the other one by formulas (4) and (1).Let us take a DNA sequence containing 20 (N = 20) tandem repeats {atcgagt} as the first sequence. In subsequent consideration, this sequence of 140 bases in length will play a role of the sequence S while the length of subsequence Si is equal to seven DNA bases; this means that we are looking for the period of seven DNA bases (Table 1). For the sequence S, we generate multiple alignment of periods; here they play the role of subsequence Si. These periods are positioned one under the other. For this multiple alignment of periods, Z-value calculated by formulas (3), (1) and (6) using BLAST matrix is equal to 68.5 ± 3.5, whereas Z-value calculated by formulas (4), (1) and (6) is 55.2 ± 1.9. These calculations show that in the case of perfect periodicity both methods of weight function calculation give very similar results that are indistinguishable within the error of calculation by the Monte Carlo method.Matrix used for generation of artificial sequence with hidden periodicity of seven DNA bases in lengthIn each position of the period probabilities of selection of any base are equal to each other.Matrix used for generation of artificial sequence with hidden periodicity of seven DNA bases in lengthIn each position of the period probabilities of selection of any base are equal to each other.As a second example, we consider a DNA sequence given below, which is characterized by the existence of latent period of seven symbols in length (L = 7, N = 20). Let us assume that DNA bases listed in Table 2 could appear in each position of the period with equal probability. One of possible sequences in which such periodicity is actually observed is the following:The distribution of periodic sequences found by the groups of organisms to which they belongThe distribution of periodic sequences found by the groups of organisms to which they belongACCTACATGGGTTTTAGTATGTTCTACTCGGACTACACCCTATTCTCCGCCTCTTGTGGTTCTTGTGCCG TGCCCCTTCTTACTTACCCCTTTTGCCGTATGCTAAAGATCGAATCCTGTCTAACTTTGAATTAAGTATTSince this period is a hidden one, it is impossible to reveal the periodicity ‘visually’ by homology between separate periods. Let us evaluate probability values α and β for this sequence. For this sequence, Z-values determined by the Monte Carlo method are 2.5 ± 0.6 and 8.0 ± 0.7. Using normal distribution for the evaluation of distribution of Z-value, we obtain the value of probability α > 0.05 and the value of probability β < 10−9. Thus, it is clear that such periodicity will be statistically insignificant if we use the weight introduced on the basis of BLAST matrix [formulas (3) and (1)] and that it is revealed at a statistically significant level using the information measure introduced by formulas (4) and (1).The spectrum Z(n,k) is similar to a spectrum of Fourier transformation for numerical sequences but has the following advantages: (i) the calculation of the spectrum does not require any transformation of a symbolical sequence to numerical sequences; (ii) ID allows the revealing of both obvious periodicity and the latent periodicity of a symbolical sequence in which there is no statistically important similarity between any two periods; (iii) the statistical significance of long periods is not spread onto the statistical significance of shorter periods; (iv) on the basis of the matrix M it is possible to determine the type of periodicity (Fig. 1).Matrix T shows the symbol frequencies of the sequence with the latent periodicity.Matrix T shows the symbol frequencies of the sequence with the latent periodicity.The window with the size equal to 2000 nt was used for scanning the sequence. The length L of the sequence under consideration was varied in order to find the region of genomic sequence possessing the highest level of statistical significance. The maximum possible value of the length L was equal to the window size.The region of the sequence under study is considered to be periodic if the statistical significance Z for this region is greater than some threshold value.2.2. Algorithm of the latent periodicity classificationEach periodic region found by ID corresponds to its positional frequency matrix M′. Since we consider the periods of length equal to 2, this matrix can be represented as a vector as in Fig. 2.Periodicity matrix represented as a vector. Ki (K = {A,T,C,G}, i = {1,2}) represents the frequency (number of times the symbol is observed) of symbol K in i-th position of the period for the region found.Periodicity matrix represented as a vector. Ki (K = {A,T,C,G}, i = {1,2}) represents the frequency (number of times the symbol is observed) of symbol K in i-th position of the period for the region found.A block diagram for the algorithm of the latent periodicity classification is shown in Fig. 3.Block diagram of the latent periodicity matrices classification.Block diagram of the latent periodicity matrices classification.Since the regions of the latent periodicity were of different length, all compared matrices have been normalized to unity. We denoted the period length as N (N = 2), each matrix of the latent periodicity has been represented as a vector of nucleotides' frequencies distributed over 4N ranks. We chose the Pearson statistics as a measure of the similarity of two vectors (or as a distance between them). To use this statistics, we build two matrices—M1 and M2.Let us denote a matrix obtained from a combination of such two vectors as M1. It has the marginal frequencies X(i) = Σj M1(i,j), and Y(j) = Σi M1(i,j), where ΣiX(i) = ΣjY(j) = 2.The pairwise comparison has been made between the vectors shown in Fig. 4. The lower index in Fig. 4 corresponds to the period position; the upper one reflects an ordinal number of the compared vector.A scheme of comparison between the two latent dinucleotide periodicity matrices is shown. Both matrices are presented as 4N-dimensional vectors. X and Y are marginal frequencies, X(i) = Σj M1(i,j), and Y(j) = Σi M1(i,j), where ΣiX(i) = ΣjY(j) = 2.A scheme of comparison between the two latent dinucleotide periodicity matrices is shown.

X and Y are marginal frequencies, X(i) = Σj M1(i,j), and Y(j) = Σi M1(i,j), where ΣiX(i) = ΣjY(j) = 2.General comparison scheme between the vectors was as follows. At first we performed the pairwise comparison of all the initial periodicity vectors. For each pair of vectors we calculated the Pearson statistics. While making a comparison, we took into consideration all cyclic permutations of vectors' columns, which was necessary because of uncertainty of the period start position. A possibility of classic DNA inversions was also considered in this calculation. To achieve this, we replaced one of the vectors being compared by its complementary and inverse variant.In a second step, we chose the two vectors for which the value of the Pearson statistics was minimal. If this value corresponded to accidental probability of less than or equal to 5%, then these two vectors were combined via recapitulation of their elements. The elements of a new vector were calculated as weighted sums of the elements of two source vectors. The contribution of the specific vector to the sum was greater, the higher the number of vectors that had been already merged into it. A cyclic permutation, fixed inverse and complementary transformation were considered while making the vectors' combination. Such a new vector was then normalized again to unity. After this we returned to the first step, but we have excluded two merged vectors from the set and replaced them by one vector representing their combination.The process of vector comparison and merging had been continued until the minimal value of the Pearson statistics for the set of vectors became greater than the χ2 value corresponding to 5% level. The vectors that were left up to this moment were considered as the periodicity classes.The classes obtained were then represented on a tree diagram in Fig. 5. The χ2 value was chosen as the measure of dissimilarity between the class matrices in pairwise comparison. We used the minimum-variance method27 to build the tree diagram of classes' similarity.A tree diagram for the 45 classes of dinucleotide periodicity. The χ2 value was chosen as the measure of dissimilarity between the class matrices in pairwise comparison. We used the minimum-variance method to build the tree diagram of classes' similarity.A tree diagram for the 45 classes of dinucleotide periodicity. The χ2 value was chosen as the measure of dissimilarity between the class matrices in pairwise comparison. We used the minimum-variance method to build the tree diagram of classes' similarity.Let us note that critical level of the χ2 value was estimated as the result of all 2N trials in searching for pairwise vector similarity. An accidental probability of similarity found in 2N trials: α = 1 − (1 − P)2N should be less than or equal to 5%. From this point a critical level of accidental probability in one trial P was calculated by using the inverse χ2 function.2.3. Modified profile analysisWe have used the dynamic profile alignment approach,21 which takes into account divergence of sequences as due to spot mutations and also indels. The method unites algorithms of dynamic programming for finding the best alignment28 with analysis of position specific nucleotides as in a profile.29 Since optimal alignment of analysed sequence has been built against a class matrix, that represents distribution of base weights over consensus positions, here we will use a term of alignment against position-specific weight matrix (PSWM). The procedure for building the PSWM is similar in a way with the one described in ref. (20), but there are some differences that will be described below.In order to find periodic sequences in GenBank we have built position-specific frequency matrixes of the nucleotides (PSMs) for each of the periodicity classes obtained in the previous step. To prevent distortion of base frequencies in isotypical periodic sequences, (effect of unequal representation) we have used the Sibbald and Argos algorithm30 to weigh up each sequence inversely proportional to the number of sequences that are highly similar to this sequence.If we use w′ only, rare nucleotides would have almost zero weight. To avoid this, we found mean weight for each position and subtracted it from w′ to obtain the modified weight w. In this case, even very rare nucleotides would have negative weight, though the function w at small frequencies f(S, j) is somewhat non-monotomic.Therefore the transition to PSWM assists in assigning the higher weight to rarely occurring bases in the periodicity class when they have high occurrence frequency at the given position in the PSM and vice versa, decreasing the weight of bases with low occurrence frequency at the given position.202.4. Algorithm of dynamic alignment of PSWM2.5. Statistical significance of similarityWe set up the minimum length of a periodical sequence to be found equal to 40 bases.All significant results revealed were filtered in order to exclude the overlapping sequences. If an overlapped region exceeded 30% of the length of the smaller of two overlapped alignments, only the alignment with the greater Z-score has been left.2.6. Statistical test for the periodicitySince the method of MPA ensures only the statistical significance of sequence similarity, not its periodicity, we had to perform additional statistical test for the sequences found by this method. To do this, we have calculated the ID spectrum for all the sequences found by MPA in the same way as it was described in Section 2.1. We used the Monte Carlo method to calculate the statistical significance. For each sequence we have generated 200 sequences by randomly shuffling its symbols and then calculated mean, variance and, finally, Z-score as it was described above. The sequence was considered to be periodic with period length equal to 2 if the value corresponding to this length in ID spectrum was maximal and also was equal to or greater than 7.0. This test ensures that the sequences showing the given parameters possess the dinucleotide periodicity at statistically significant level.3. Results and discussion3.1. Classification results for bacterial genomesMaking a search for the latent dinucleotide periodicity in prokaryotic genomes from the GenBank-137 by using the ID method, we have found 454 sequences possessing the periodicity of such a type at level of Z-score ≥ 5. In order to find non-random sequences of maximal length it is essential to choose Z-score providing <5% probability of finding a random sequence with Z greater than this threshold score. We found such a value by applying the Monte Carlo method to a random set of symbols with a length ∼10 times greater than the bacterial sequences presented in GenBank. So we can conclude that the number of ‘noisy’ sequences (i.e. the sequences that are not significantly periodic) in the set of the sequences found with Z ≥ 5 is <5%. The distribution of the sequences found by the group of organisms they belong to is shown in Table 2. Rather a big number of sequences belongs to Gammaproteobacteria (158) and Actinobacteria (61). Together they account for more than a half of the periodical sequences. The organisms whose sequences include the biggest number of periodical sequences are as follows: E. coli (31), Bradyrhizobium japonicum (18), Xanthomonas campestris (17), Helicobacter pylori (16) and Xanthomonas axonopodis (16), from which the last three belong to the pathogenic bacteria and two others are symbiotic ones.The length distribution of dinucleotide periodic sequences found in prokaryotic genomes is presented in Fig. 6. The length of most of the sequences (∼400) falls into the range 1–300, with the shortest one being equal to 28, but there are some examples of lengthy periodic sequences having length of more than 1000 nt.Length distribution of dinucleotide periodic sequences found in prokaryotic genomes.Length distribution of dinucleotide periodic sequences found in prokaryotic genomes.All 454 sequences were classified by the latent period type as it was described above in Section 2. As a result, 45 classes have been discriminated; each of them combined three or more sequences of dinucleotide periodicity. The total number of sequences belonging to classes was 219. The distribution of the number of sequences contained in the classes is shown in Table 3.Distribution of the number of sequences in the classes obtainedDistribution of the number of sequences in the classes obtainedWe see that more than a half of the sequences that form the classes fall into two large classes, so the type of periodicity represented by the latter is quite common.The tree diagram of class similarity is shown in Fig. 5.The largest class combined 19 loci of latent dinucleotide periodicity (m × 10 on the tree diagram), next two largest classes contained 11 loci each (m × 32 and m × 38 on the tree diagram). The latent period type of the largest class is shown in Fig. 7. As we can see, cytosine and guanine are clearly predominated in both positions. Thus the period consensus may be conventionally described as {c,g}{c,g}. Classes of latent dinucleotide periodicity shown in Fig. 5 are combined according to the similarity in period type. Let us consider, for example, two extreme left and right groups of classes. The first of them combines the classes m × 45, m × 14, m × 5, m × 31, m × 19, m × 4, and the second combines m × 38, m × 10, m × 13, m × 11, m × 35, m × 1. The aggregation of classes in the first group takes place due to the significant frequency of adenine appearance in the first period position. The conventional consensus of combination is {}{n}, where n – any nucleotide from the set (a,t,c,g). The aggregation process in the second group is caused by the significant values of frequencies of cytosine and guanine in the first position of the period. The combination conventional consensus in this case is {}{n}.Non-normalized vector and normalized matrix of the latent periodicity class containing the biggest number of sequences which is equal to 19.

Elements of the vector equal to the frequencies of appearance of a, t, c and g nucleotides in the first and second position of the period. The decimal numbers show the frequencies of corresponding nucleotides in period positions.The presence of lengthy regions of latent dinucleotide periodicity in prokaryotic genes allows one to think that many prokaryotic genes show the high variability in those regions which have little (if any) influence on the functionality of the protein being coded. The mechanism of microsatellites origin seems to be connected with DNA strand sliding and with mispairing of neighboring repeats at the time of replication.33 Owing to the short cycle of prokaryotic organism reproduction, the number of dinucleotide repeats grows rapidly, which leads to the appearance of the lengthy tracts. The nucleotide mutation rate should be high on the dinucleotide periodicity tracts because of the lack of selective constraints, and thus the dinucleotide periodicity, erodes rapidly becoming the latent periodicity. In addition, the existence of lengthy dinucleotide periodicity tracts can facilitate the improvement of the genome's physical properties, e.g. the raise of its flexibility, or, conversely, the rigidity, for certain DNA regions. Thus, the latent dinucleotide periodicity could be stabilized under the influence of yet other forces of natural selection.All the class matrices obtained are available online as Supplementary Table 1 at Author Webpage.3.2. Search with the MPAWe made the search using the method of MPA for 45 classes obtained in the previous step. Each class matrix was used for scanning through all bacterial loci in GenBank. Totally 27 087 corresponding to the frequency matrices of periodicity classes have been found. Among them there were both sequences possessing dinucleotide periodicity and many sequences possessing 6 nt periods of similar type (3 periods of 2 nt each). The presence of 6 symbol periodicity is caused by triplet periodicity of coding DNA regions (2 periods of 3 symbols each make a 6 symbol periodicity). Therefore, we filtered the overlapped sequences as it was described in the Section 2 and then use the statistical test described in the Section 2.6 to find whether the sequences found possess the dinucleotide periodicity at significant level. The number of filtered sequences that have passed the test was 3949. Such a big number in comparison with the 454 sequences that were found originally gives a reason to suggest that these sequences consist of strongly diverged tandem duplications. The periodicity of these possible ancient microsatellites is fuzzy, so it cannot be found by ID only.All sequences found were aligned against the consensus sequence corresponding to the periodicity matrix. Examples of the alignments obtained are shown in Table 4. The ID spectra for the sequences from Table 4 are shown in Fig. 8. From this figure it is obvious that the maximal value corresponds to the period length equal to 2 and this value is >7. So these sequences possess the dinucleotide periodicity at statistically significant level. None of these sequences were found by other software packages.15,16,34Information decomposition spectra for AE012486 (a); AF453480 (b); CJ11168X1, positions 176412–176535 (c); and CJ11168X1, positions 165728–165785 (d). The maximum at period length equal to 2 is clearly visible.Information decomposition spectra for AE012486 (a); AF453480 (b); CJ11168X1, positions 176412–176535 (c); and CJ11168X1, positions 165728–165785 (d). The maximum at period length equal to 2 is clearly visible.Examples of alignments of periodic sequences foundExamples of alignments of periodic sequences foundTo get some biological insight, it is interesting to explore which functional elements of DNA contain periodicity and, inversely, which periodical sequences belong to which functional elements. We used the GenBank FEATURES field as a source of information for our study. Only the sequences with high statistical significance of their periodicity (Z ≥ 7.0) were selected. The sequence was considered to belong to some functional element if its overlap with the region of corresponding feature was equal or greater than 30%.The distribution of the number of periodical sequences overlapping with some functional elements of genome is shown in Table 5.Distribution of some periodical sequences revealed in previously characterized DNA regionsDistribution of some periodical sequences revealed in previously characterized DNA regionsSince the sequences of interest were prokaryotic, it is not surprising that most of them belong to the gene regions, so these data are not shown in the Table 5. Also one can see that more than 100 sequences overlapped with sequence repeats were already detected empirically, so our method is proven to find such kind of repeats. What is really interesting is that periodical sequences were also found in promoters. The expected value for the number of promoters in the periodic sequences found is 32. It was calculated as a product of number of promoters in all bacterial genomes available and the fraction of periodic sequences in these genomes. Since the value obtained is 14, the abundance of promoters in periodic sequences is evidently not statistically significant. Nevertheless, the study of the periodic sequences found in promoters can be interesting since these sequences could appear to be ancient minisatellites.3.3. Comparison with related works and discussionA number of algorithms have already been proposed that either directly or indirectly detect tandem repeats. All of them suffer from significant limitations. One group of algorithms is based on computing the alignment matrices.35–37 Their major drawback is excessive running time. But what is more important is that the methods that are based on using similarity matrices are able to identify only the repeats with high level of homology between repeat units. Similar phenomenon is described in ref. (38). The methods for searching the periodicity using Fourier transformation39–41 are not able to identify the periodicity in presence of insertions and deletions in sequence and they do not produce the periodicity matrix that can be used for further analysis. Another group of algorithms finds tandem repeats indirectly using methods from the field of data compression. An algorithm by Milosavljevic and Jurka42 detects ‘simple sequences’, i.e. mixtures of fragments that occur elsewhere. Simple sequences may or may not contain tandem repeats and this algorithm makes no attempt to deduce a repeated pattern. Some of the algorithms are sensitive dramatically to the insertions and deletions in sequence and, thus, can identify only the repeats obeying very strict rules.43,44 The software programs for finding tandem repeats in genomic sequences available in the EMBOSS package34 identify tandem repeats of a very limited type (certain microsatellites).The major advantages of using the combination of our methods are that the size of the periodic sequence is not limited and is not specified beforehand; the methods are able to identify even very fuzzy repeats; the alignment matrices used are not filled entirely to speed the calculation. Though other methods developed share some of these advantages, to our knowledge, they are not able to identify the potential minisatellites found by using our approach.The sequences shown in Table 4 have not been found to be periodic or to be minisatellites by other programs and methods available. We found 3949 possible minisatellite sequences in bacterial genomes; this is remarkably greater than the number of sequences already found. Because of the statistical threshold defined, we can conclude that >95% of the sequences found are periodic at statistically significant level.As a first step, we use the ID method to find periodical sequences within bacterial genomes. Then we obtained classes of periodicity (defined by frequency matrix) to get some insight into the common patterns of periodicity for different organisms or group of organisms. The patterns, though rather fuzzy, do exist and we described this fact in details in the Results section. Since the repeats in bacterial genomes show high variability, most of them cannot be revealed by traditional methods and by the ID. MPA gives much better results, but it would take too much time to make a search for the periodicity with indels using all frequency matrices obtained using the ID.If we take class matrices rather than all periodicity matrices, the time needed for the computations decreases dramatically. For bacterial genomes, using class matrices allows to speed up the calculation 10 times (45 class matrices versus 454 initial matrices). On the other hand, classes reflect more common properties of genome than individual matrices and, thus, can be used to reveal more periodical sequences. As we have shown in the Results section, some classes contain more than 10 sequences belonging to different organisms, so the genome properties they reflect are quite common. The number of sequences found by our method proves these suggestions.Albeit the revealing of periodical sequences in genomes is an interesting and challenging task, the more important thing is to correlate the periodicity with possible biological functions and/or evolutional features. We have discussed above the difficulties in identification of ancient microsatellites and their importance for PCR analysis because of their highly polymorphic nature. In the Results section we showed some examples of periodical sequences found within the regions that had been already described as polymorphous. For each of these sequences we found the others defined by the same frequency matrix and, thus, possibly having the same nature. And it is possible to use the periodical sequences found with indels as a starting point for the PCR analysis, because they can turn out to be highly polymorphous ones. The study of possible ancient minisatellites may also be helpful for evolutionary analysis of genomes.4. ConclusionIn this paper, we have presented a new method and algorithms for de novo identification of latent periodical sequences, which can be considered as potential microsatellites and minisatellites. A remarkable feature of this method is its ability to identify fuzzy or loose repeats (e.g. possible ancient microsatellites) that cannot be revealed by other methods.The work presented in this paper was supported in part by the Russian Federal Ministry for Science and Education in the context of the ‘System Biology’ project (2005–2006).Supplementary Data: Supplementary data is available online at Author Webpage.Supplementary data"

Introduction The human Y chromosome has attracted a great deal of attention owing to its small size and the limited number of genes it carries. 1 , 2 The recent genomic data showed presence of massive palindromic sequences having several isoforms and multiple copies of genes suggesting its unique organization and equally unique trail of evolution. 3–5 Despite fewer functional genes located on the Y chromosome, 6 , 7 its earlier image of genetic wasteland is totally changed. Complete sequencing of the euchromatic region revealed a total of 178 transcribed units, 3 most of which are pseudogenes or their amplified copies. The Y encodes only 45 unique proteins and several of its genes are involved in sex determination and control and regulation of fertility. 8 , 9 The human Y chromosome has been divided into pseudoautosomal regions (PAR1 and PAR2), which represent 5% of its total sequences, whereas the remaining 95% NRY (Non-Recombining Y) contains euchromatic and heterochromatic regions. The genes in the PAR1 and PAR2 regions are inherited like autosomal ones. 10 The distal region represents the heterochromatic portion corresponding to Yq12 with ∼30 Mb sequences 11 and harbors two major repeat domains, DYZ1 and DYZ2. 12 The DYZ1 satellite, corresponding to ∼40% of the total Y chromosome 7 was first reported as 3.4 kb band from Hae III digested human male genomic DNA. 13 Sequence analysis of a single array uncovered 229 copies of pentanucleotide repeat motifs 5′-TTCCA-3′. 14 A normal human Y chromosome contains 2000–4000 copies of DYZ1 13 in a sex-specific manner. 15–17 However, it is not clear if copy number variation of DYZ1 affects its normal functioning, if any, and correlates with spermatogenesis, male fertility, sustenance to full-term pregnancy or overall reproductive potential of the males. DYZ1 has been found to show mosaicism in repeated abortion (RA), 18 whereas other loci seem to be affected in prostate cancer (PC) 19 , 20 and males exposed to natural background radiation (NBR). 21 However, the changes that are brought about within the Y chromosome through the genomic instability of DYZ1 repeat fraction under these conditions remain unclear.  A reliable assay system for an accurate quantification of the copy number status of the DYZ1 array is not available. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) uncovered chromosomal translocation, mosaicism and aberrant Y chromosome 17 , 18 but failed to detect copy number status of the DYZ1 since probe detected single signal on the Yq12 region. Here we describe assessment of copy number variation of the DYZ1 arrays in normal males, patients suffering from PC, cases of RA and males exposed to NBR employing real-time PCR and FISH. Our work shows copy number status of the DYZ1 arrays in the normal males and patients and establishes a genotype phenotype correlation. Prospects of this work in the area of Y chromosome genomics in general and clinical genetics in particular are highlighted. 2. Materials and methods2.1. Collection of human blood and germline samples and isolation of DNA Ten RA samples were obtained from Nobel hospital, Faridabad, North India, and two PC from Kerala, South India. A total of 56 samples containing 40 blood and 16 semen samples from males and 15 blood samples from females, all exposed to NBR were collected from Chavra, (Kerala) in accordance with the Institute's Ethical and Biosafety Committee. In addition, 20 blood samples from normal males and females each from North India were also used. DNA isolation was performed following standard protocols. 222.2. PCR amplification of DYZ1 fraction To assess organizational variation of DYZ1 repeats (accession no. X06228), both at its copy number level as well as within the single array amongst individuals suffering from RA, PC and exposed to NBR, internal primers were designed ( Table 1 ) using Primer Express Software V2.0 (ABI). PCRs were conducted in a 25 μl volume containing Taq Polymerase, 10× PCR buffer (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), 200 μM dNTPs and 100 ng of target DNA for a total of 35 cycles. Each cycle involved denaturation at 95°C for 1 min, annealing 60°C for 1.5 min and primer extension at 72°C for 1 min. The amplified products were resolved on 1.5% agarose gel. The quantity and quality of the above mentioned samples were confirmed by PCR amplification using a set of Human β-actin (F 5′-GTGGGCCGCTCTAGACACCA-3′ and R 5′-CGGTTGGCCTTAGG G TTCAGGGGGG-3′) primers. Details of primers used for amplification of different regions of the DYZ1 repeat arrayDetails of primers used for amplification of different regions of the DYZ1 repeat array2.3. Slot–blot hybridization In order to confirm deletions shown by endpoint PCR, 500 ng of genomic DNA from different RA samples in 100 μl of 2× SSC was slot blotted onto a nylon membrane (Manifold Apparatus, Schleicher & Schuell, Germany) and UV fixed. For control, genomic DNA from normal male and female was included in the blot. Independently amplified PCR products of 265, 773 and 275 bp from normal human male were used as probe. Hybridization and autoradiography was performed following standard procedure. 232.4. FISH For FISH with human metaphase chromosomes, DYZ1 cloned probe was labeled using Nick Translation Kit from Vysis (IL, USA) following supplier's instructions. Hybridization, washing, counter staining and mounting of the slides were performed following established protocol. 17 Slides were screened under the Olympus microscope (BX51) fitted with vertical fluorescence illuminator U-LH100HG UV, excitation and barrier filters. Images were captured with a CCD camera. For karyotyping, CytoVision 2.81 software from Applied Imaging was used. 2.5. Copy number calculation of DYZ1 repeatThe copy number of DYZ1 was calculated based on absolute quantification assay using SYBR green dye and Sequence Detection System-7000 (ABI, CA). A set of primers specific to DYZ1 (DYZ1F: 5′-TGGAATGGAATCGAATGGAATGGAA-3′ and DYZ1R: 5′-TGCCAAATCATTGCATTCCTTTCC-3′) was designed using Primer Express Software V2.0 (ABI). The efficiency of primers was assessed by using a 10-fold dilution series of the recombinant plasmid and standard male genomic DNA. The reactions were performed in triplicate using 96-well plates in a 25 μl reaction volume employing conditions of 50°C for 2 min, 95°C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 10 s and 60°C for 1 min. Copies of the DYZ1 arrays were calculated by extrapolation of the standard curve obtained with known copies of the recombinant plasmid.3. Results3.1. Organizational variation within the DYZ1 region Of all the samples used in the present study, nine showed distinct deletions within the DYZ1 arrays ( Fig. 1a ). Of these, a 265 bp deletion from nt 25 to 290 was detected in five (RA1, RA5, RA7, RA8 and RA10) individuals ( Fig. 1b , panel A). A 775 bp deletion from nt 1347 to 2119 was detected in seven (RA1, RA6, RA7, RA8, RA9, NBRS6 and NBRS29) individuals ( Fig. 1c and e , panel A). Another 275 bp deletion, spanning from nt 3128 to 3402 was detected in two (RA1 and RA8) individuals ( Fig. 1d , panel A). Significantly, samples RA1 and RA8 showed all the three (265, 773 and 275 bp) deletions. However, all the samples showed amplification with β-actin primer giving rise to expected 650 bp fragment indicating intactness of the target DNA ( Fig. 1b–e , panels B). Screening of the DNA samples from normal men showed no deletion. Table 2 represents details of DNA samples and primers used for screening of the DYZ1 arrays.

Slot blot hybridization substantiates deletions in RA samples Slot–blot analysis of the DNA from RA samples probed independently with 265, 773 and 275 bp fragments showed absence of signals in several individuals. RA1, RA5, RA7, RA8 and RA10 showed absence of signals when hybridized with labeled probe of 265 bp ( Fig. 2a , panel A). Similarly, RA1, RA6, RA7, RA8 and RA9 showed no signal with labeled probe of 773 bp ( Fig. 2b , panel A), and RA1 and RA8 with 275 bp ( Fig. 2c , panel A).

FISH uncovers DYZ1 (in)stability on the Y chromosome FISH of DYZ1 with metaphase chromosomes and interphase nuclei of one RA, 24 individuals exposed to NBR and two PC, showed varying levels of signals. Of the two PCs, PC1 showed DYZ1 signal on the autosome 10 along with Y chromosome in ∼80% metaphases, which was substantiated by three signals in the interphase nuclei ( Fig. 3a and b ). In addition, single DYZ1 signal was also detected in ∼20% cells in PC1 indicating DYZ1 mosaicism. PC2 showed DYZ1 signal in ∼40% cells and total absence of the same in the remaining 60% cells ( Fig. 3c and d , arrows), indicating a gross level of DYZ1 mosaicism. The FISH analysis on sample RA10 showed overall reduced but varying signals of DYZ1 on the Y chromosome and interphase nuclei ( Fig. 3e ). Similar results showing variations in the DYZ1 signal intensity were obtained from the screening of 13 families exposed to NBR, where five males 1b, 3b, 8f, 9f and 13f showed relatively reduced signals ( Fig. 3f ). In addition, the 8b male showed positional change and 2f, 4f and 10f males showed enhanced signals of the DYZ1 arrays suggesting their organizational variations ( Fig. 3f ). Present study establishes a correlation between the specific genotype (PC, NBR and RA) and varying level of DYZ1 instability, reflected as presence/absence or reduced level of signals.

Copy number status of DYZ1 in normal males, RA, PC and NBR High quality intact DNA samples of all the categories were subjected to real-time PCR to assess copy number status of the DYZ1 arrays. The standard curve in real-time PCR with a slope of −3.4 and single dissociation peak reflected 100% efficiency of the assay system (data not shown). The primers were highly specific as evident from the females showing no amplification. In normal males, DYZ1 copies ranged from 3000 to 4300, in RA, 0 to 2237 and in NBR, 1577 to 5700. PC2 showed 550 copies of the DYZ1 arrays. The real-time PCR results were consistently reproducible as evident from the samples subjected to reactions at least for three times. Copy number status of the DYZ1 arrays amongst group of different samples is shown in a representative bar diagram ( Fig. 4 ). Compared with DNA used as control from normal males, all the other samples, showed CNV of DYZ1 either below or above the normal range. Genomic instability of DYZ1 seems to be more common in RA samples compared with that in NBR exposed males.

Organizational variation of the DYZ1 arrays In the present study, our aim was to assess copy number status of the DYZ1 arrays in normal males and compare the same with that in patients representing PC, RA and NBR samples. DYZ1 represents a major satellite fraction of ∼3.4 kb from the long arm of the human Y chromosome with overabundant STR motif 5′-TTCCA-3′. 14 STRs have been known to expand and shrink possibly owing to unequal cross-over during meiosis 24 giving rise to hypervariable regions 25 or variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) loci. 26 Sequences on the Y chromosome show rapid rate of evolution as opposed to that on the autosomes and X chromosomes and move equally rapidly in an intra-chromosomal and inter-chromosomal environment. 27 This is well corroborated with translocation of DYZ1 on chromosome 10 in PC1. Compared with the normal males, DYZ1 seems to be affected in all the abnormal genomes. It does not transcribe but is propagated from generation to generation across the cell lineages. This seems to play a critical role, possibly in chromatin folding and maintenance of the structural integrity of the Y chromosome. This inference is based on the fact that DYZ1 arrays showed three discernible deletions in seven different RA samples but not in any of the normal males. Deletions detected in the present study by PCR and supported by FISH data seem to have contributed towards the vulnerability of the Y chromosome, obstructing the sustenance of the pregnancy. This is because all the RA samples were of the male origin. In this context, female aborted fetus may be analyzed to include/exclude such possibility. Owing to small sample size statistical analysis was not conducted. This issue may be resolved unequivocally with the analysis of more number of samples.  Deletions within the DYZ1 region in the semen samples of NBR exposed males indicated that despite being a slow process, NBR causes genome instability. This is faithfully recorded by the DYZ1 arrays as substantiated by FISH results. CNV of DYZ1 may also be caused due to non-disjunction, large duplications and deletions. 28–30 Besides duplication, reverse transcriptase activity may also contribute to copy number variation. 31 Irrespective of the mechanisms involved, environment seems to contribute to genomic instability of DYZ1, thereby, supporting the concept of rapid rate of evolution of the Y chromosome. 32 Despite evidence ( albeit in direct ) that genomic instability of the DYZ1 is correlated with RA, we wish to refrain from any such conclusion, since work is underway on this using more number of samples to prove this point or otherwise. The abnormal copies of the DYZ1 in patients with PC have never been reported earlier. Once again, it is difficult to draw a major conclusion owing to study based on two samples. This warrants analysis of more number of PC samples to resolve this issue. 5. ConclusionDYZ1 seems to be affected in RA, PC and NBR samples though its diagnostic potential has neither been explored nor acknowledged. The most intriguing observation was well-defined deletions in three different regions of DYZ1 repeat in RA samples. In addition, its copy number fluctuation below or above the normal range correlated with abnormal genotype. Present study indicates its diagnostic and prognostic potentials suggesting that this approach may be used as a marker system for ascertaining its copy number status and establishing genotype/phenotype correlation in routine clinical cases.The work was supported by a DBT grant no BT/PR2225/Med/13/077/2000 and DST grant no SP/SO/DO3/99) to S.A. and a core grant from the Department of Biotechnology, Govt. of India to National Institute of Immunology, New Delhi.

IntroductionAlternative RNA processing pathways are a result of combining different splice junctions that are present in pre-mRNA transcripts. In this way, a variety of mRNA and proteins can be created from the same gene. Alternative splicing (AS) is thought to play a major role in expanding the potential informational content of eukaryotic genomes. Recent evidence indicates a high incidence (32–60%) of AS in the human genome, predominantly in the form of exon skip while a minor form was intron retention (5–16%).1–4 Although rare, intron retention can play an important biological role. It has been linked to tumor growth5 and is part of developmental regulation of a proinsulin expression.6Plants are thought to exhibit less AS (10–22%).3,7,8 Computational analysis of AS in Arabidopsis by EST-pair alignment identified 436 alternatively spliced genes.9 Unexpectedly, intron retention was found to be the most common type (45%). Retained introns were shown to be present in RNA derived from polyribosomes, demonstrating that these intron retention events are not the byproduct of incomplete splicing but are found in a translatable context in the cytoplasm.9 Iida et al.7 aligned 248 514 RAFL (RIKEN Arabidopsis Full-Length) cDNA/EST sequences to the Arabidopsis genome using a BLAST-based method.10 They identified 15 214 transcription units (TUs) containing at least two sequences each and observed AS for 11.6% of these TUs of which 44% were retained introns.7 In a recent study using a large collection of EST/cDNA, 4707 (21.8%) of the transcripts showed 8264 AS events. Approximately 56% of these events were of the intron retention type.8 These studies confirmed that a low percentage of genes (10–22%) are alternatively spliced and that intron retention is the most prevalent AS type in Arabidopsis.Calculating the rate of AS using expressed sequence data (ESTs and cDNAs) can underestimate the amount of AS for the following reasons. Collectively, the EST and cDNA database in plants is relatively small and, thus, may lack low-abundance transcripts. In addition, AS predictions based on cDNA data are in many cases biased towards the termini of transcripts owing to the preponderance of end-sequence reads among ESTs and oligo(dT)-based priming for reverse transcription. Recently, high-density oligonucleotide-based whole-genome microarrays (WGAs) have emerged as a novel platform for genomic analysis beyond gene expression profiling. Unbiased WGAs can be used for ‘epigenomic’ mapping11 and have been used to monitor exon skipping in humans.12,13 By comparing the expression levels of all the exons within genes, it was shown that a large fraction (∼80%) of expressed genes on chromosomes 21 and 22 exhibit exon skipping. This estimate is significantly higher than previous predictions, which was based on computational analysis of ESTs and cDNAs.4 The array-based approach to analyzing AS also has limitations. For example, the detection of relatively rare splicing events is difficult. Furthermore, in a manner analogous to obtaining multiple EST libraries from different tissue, a large number of distinct tissues or cell populations must be surveyed to obtain sufficient confidence to call a splice variant at a specific splice junction.In this work by using published WGA information, we monitor intron retention in Arabidopsis and show that it is readily detectable, generally leading to transcripts containing new reading frames that would result in truncated gene products.2. Materials and methods2.1. Data sourcesArabidopsis genes, introns and coding sequences annotations and their genomic location were obtained from TAIR 6.0 release databases Author WebpageAuthor WebpageAuthor WebpageAuthor WebpageAuthor WebpageAuthor Webpage In order to allocate each probe to its TUs, programs were written in PERL. Those programs analyzed the BLAST results of the probes and the different databases. Programs are available upon request from H.N-G.2.2. Normalization of the whole-genome array-WGAThe hybridization value from a set of 12 oligonucleotide arrays representing 94% of the Arabidopsis genome sequence (110 Mb) was used.14 Each array contains 835 000 oligos of 25 mer size. Four RNA populations were hybridized to these arrays.14 The probe sequences and the hybridization values for the 12 slides were taken from GEO Accession viewer Author Webpage using the GEO accession GPL slide numbers (GPL432-GPL443). Hybridization data were normalized by taking the log2 of the data of all probes and then by dividing each probe intensity value in a given experiment by the median intensity value of all probes in that experiment. As reported, the median intensity value of all probes were determined to be a good estimate of the background noise level in a given experiment.142.3. Retained-intron analysisAn intron was defined as candidate constitutive or as a retained intron based on its combined probes hybridization values relative to the mean hybridization value of the other introns and exons in the transcript. In order to define retained introns in an expressed transcript the probes of its exons were treated as one group, while each intron, which contained at least three probes, was treated as different group. A balanced one-way ANOVA for comparing the means of all the groups in a transcript was performed. The ANOVA test evaluates the hypothesis that the samples all have the same mean against the alternative hypothesis that the means are not all the same. To insure a False Discovery Rate (FDR) of at most 0.05, the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) method was used.15 Transcripts in which the exons mean was at least 1.09 and the introns mean was less than 1.09 were ranked according to their P ANOVA value. The P ANOVA value was then compared with the BH critical value to select significant values. The BH critical values and the P-value for each ANOVA test are shown in Supplementary Table S2 available at Author Webpage. Using these results a test was then performed that determines which pairs of means are significantly different and which are not. This test employs the Tukey's least significant difference procedure. PERL programs were written in order to differentiate between groups that have the same mean to groups that are different from each other. Programs are available upon request from H.N-G.2.4. Gene ontologyGene ontology classification of transcripts was carried out using the first level categories of the Gene Ontology classification of the biological processes of their protein products (Author Webpage). Gene ontology categories that deviate from cumulative binomial distribution with the probability for retained-intron genes P = 0.08 and 1 − P for constitutive introns genes, with significant P-value set at 0.05, are summarized.2.5. Growth of plants, cell culture, RNA extraction and RT–PCRArabidopsis thaliana (ecotype Columbia) seeds were surface sterilized and placed onto sterilized MS containing Petri dishes. The seeds were cold-treated at 4°C for 2 days and then incubated 7 days at 16 h light/8 h dark cycle. Flower buds were collected from mature Arabidopsis plants (5–7 weeks old) grown on soil. Arabidopsis suspension-culture cells were a generous gift from Dr Gideon Grafi. The culture was maintained at 16 h light/8 h dark cycle with constant shaking and was subcultured every week and harvested then. Root tissue was obtained by incubating surface-sterilized seeds in flasks containing 100 ml Gamborg's liquid media. The seedlings were incubated for 2 weeks with constant agitation under 16 h light/8 h dark cycle, and root tissue was collected and frozen.RNA was extracted from the four different tissues, using RNeasy (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). RT–PCR was conducted as previously published.16 Oligonucleotide primers were designed for simultaneous amplification of both the spliced and unspliced variants or by using an internal intron probe in which the opposing primer was from the next non-adjacent exon. A complete list of the PCR primers used in this study is shown as Supplementary Table S6 available at Author Webpage.3. Results3.1. Division of probes in WGA to accommodate gene structure-criteriaA unique set of whole-genome arrays representing ∼94% of the Arabidopsis genome sequence are composed of a set of 12 microarrays (6 for the forward strand and 6 for the reverse complement), each containing ∼835 000 oligos of 25 mer size. Each array contains an end-to-end ‘tile’ of oligonucleotides (from head to tail) with no overlap in their DNA sequences. In this array, only ‘perfect match’ probes were included in the whole-genome array design. The standard Affymetrix Arabidopsis gene expression controls are present on each of these chips. Recently, RNA from four sources were used to probe this array to determine by empirical analysis the transcriptional activity of the Arabidopsis genome.14 Tissues sampled included seedlings, flowers, suspension-culture cells and roots.We wished to ascertain the possibility of refining from this data knowledge about alternative transcripts. In order to parse the data into established annotation of genes and their exons and introns structure the genes structures predicted by TAIR (The Arabidopsis Information Resource; Author Webpage) were used. The gene structure includes the genomic location and sequence of each exon and intron. In cases in which one gene includes more then 1 transcript (e.g. known AS), the transcript structure that included the most exons was used so that a gene was divided into as many distinct groups as possible. The oligos were aligned to the exons and introns sequences in order to allocate oligos to exons and introns. The rest of the oligos that include control probes, probes with more than 1 hit in the genome, intergenic probes as well as probes that fall on intron/exon borders were removed. Thus, in total, 1 682 698 unique probes of the introns or exons were found to be amenable to analysis (Supplementary Table S1 is available at Author Webpage).3.2. Criteria for differentiating introns and exons in the whole-genome screenOur aim was to devise statistical tests for each transcriptional unit so that aberrant behavior of introns and exons could be registered. Hybridization values were normalized by dividing each probe intensity value in a given experiment by the median intensity value of all probes in that experiment as done previously.14 As hybridization values are distributed normally in a log scale, we transformed all the values to log2 and then normalized by dividing each probe intensity value in a given experiment by the median intensity value of all probes in that experiment.We first examined the possibility of assessing retained introns by comparing the expression data of individual introns compared with a transcripts exon hybridization value. An intron was defined as ‘candidate constitutive’ or as ‘retained’ intron based on its mean hybridization value relative to the mean hybridization value of all introns and exons in a TU. To establish global statistical parameters that can be used to distinguish between intron and exon scores in a transcriptional unit, we first explored the hybridization values of introns and exons in the full genome expression database. Genes that do not contain introns or that have multiple non-unique probes in their introns are not included in this analysis. The hybridization values of 18 275 genes were used (Table 1). The mean hybridization values of all the probes that belong to the exons of a specific gene were calculated, as well as the mean hybridization values of all the probes that belong to the gene introns. This assumes that the vast majority of plant introns are constitutively spliced. The mean hybridization values distribution of all the transcripts exons and introns is shown in Fig. 1. The two samples are statistically different based on the goodness-of-fit hypothesis test (Two-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov, P < 10−100). A cut-off minimum for the mean hybridization value of exons of a transcript of 1.09 was chosen for analysis as at that level 58% (10 574) of the transcripts could be analyzed but only 1.5% of the introns mean hybridization values were above this level.Distribution of the mean hybridization values of the probes in exons and introns transcripts.

Examining intron retention in whole-genome arraysIn order to identify retained introns in the 10 574 transcripts, the probes of the exons in each transcript were treated as one group, while each intron, which contained at least three probes, was treated as a different group. The three probes limitation was used to increase the significance of the statistical tests. A balanced one-way ANOVA for comparing the means of all the groups in a transcript was performed. To insure a FDR of at most 0.05, the BH method was used.15 The P-value of the ANOVA tests was found to be statistically significant in 10 270 transcripts (analyzed transcripts, Table 1) and used to define three different intron classes.In Class 1 transcripts, all the introns hybridization values are different from the exon group (Fig. 2A). In the example shown, the AT2G36530 transcript is defined as containing only constitutive introns as the exons group is significantly different from all the introns. In Class 2 transcripts, one intron is statistically similar to the exons group. Thus, in the case of transcript AT2G47470, intron 5 is defined as a retained intron (Fig. 2B). Intermediate cases are exemplified in Class 3 (intermediate retained). In this case the exceptional intron is expressed at a level that is between the exons group and all the other introns. In the example shown in Fig. 2C, the AT5G11200 transcript shows that intron 6 hybridization values are between the exon and intron groups.Schematic expression profiles of introns and exons.

(C) Transcript hybridization values of AT5G11200.Examination of the rest of the transcripts shows that 8206 out of 10 270 (80%) fall into one of the intron classes. In the remaining 2064 cases, there is no clear statistical differentiation of the intron and exon groups. In these cases, the transcript exon and intron groups are compared again using a lower confidence level (a = 0.1 instead of 0.05). This causes the interval around the mean of each group to contract. At this probability level conclusions could be drawn for an additional 620 cases. In the remaining 14% of transcripts the statistical variance was too great and no clear definition of the intron/exon expression boundaries could be made. In these cases, the transcripts were termed ‘undifferentiated’. The algorithms above as applied to the whole-genome arrays are summarized in the Table 1. Thus, ∼8% rate of the transcripts that could be measured contained retained introns. This is slightly higher than previous EST and cDNA-derived estimates for retained introns of between 3 to 6% of total transcripts.3,9 The detailed analysis of all the transcripts are tabulated in Table S2 available at Author Webpage.3.4. Confirmation of retained introns by RT–PCR analysisTo test the veracity of using WGA expression data to characterize AS, a sample of 14 AS events and 5 constitutive-type introns was examined by RT–PCR. The genes were selected such that they represent low- and high-expression value transcripts, retained introns in different parts of the transcripts and contain intermediate and retained-type introns. Each PCR was carried out using RNA that was extracted from four different samples including; seedlings, flowers, suspension-culture cells and roots that were combined together. Retained introns were traced either by primers that flank the intron or by using an internal intron probe in which the opposing primer was from the next non-adjacent exon. In this way, retained (I) and the smaller spliced fragment (S) could be recovered. However, if a fragment larger than that predicted by ‘I’ was detected, i.e. a fragment that included the non-adjacent but normally constitutively spliced intron was detected, this indicated that the RT–PCR amplification used pre-mRNA as its template and was rejected. All fragments containing putative introns were confirmed by sequencing (data not shown). The results shown in Fig. 3 and summarized in Table 2 indicate that 12 out of 14 introns (86%) that were predicted to be retained by the expression analysis were detected by RT–PCR. In a similar manner, when constitutive introns were examined 4 out of 5 could be verified as being constitutive.Composite of gene structure, primer choices and gel fractionation of RT–PCR products.

Feasibility of detecting ‘exon skip’ in whole-genome arraysIn theory, a modification of the same algorithm should be applicable to estimating exon skip. However inspection of Fig. 1 shows that the distribution of the introns mean hybridization value is much narrower than the exons mean hybridization value distribution. Thus, the lower hybridization values expected from potentially skipped exons would fall well within the normal exons distribution values, making the direct application of WGA difficult. The limitation of this application is exemplified when the same statistical methods used for detection of retained introns are applied to detect exon skip. Thus, to detect exon skip in a transcript, the probes of its introns were treated as one group, while each exon, which contained at least three probes, was treated as a different group. Exon skip of the first or last exons were excluded as these are probably due to 5′ and 3′ transcription start/finish differences and do not necessarily arise from splicing. Furthermore in that case, any data retrieved would be impossible to verify owing to the lack of flanking sequence for RT–PCR priming. The results of the search for exons skips were divided as for the introns. Examination of internal exons using the statistical tests and parameters as those applied for examination of the introns showed an exon skip level of more than 8% (Table 1). A sample of previously un-annotated AS events in Arabidopsis was experimentally tested by RT–PCR. Each PCR was done using RNA that was extracted from four different samples as carried out for intron retention analysis. However, in this case only a low rate verification was achieved, 3 out of 8 (37.5%; Supplementary Table S3 available at Author Webpage), Thus, owing to the difficulty of separating the exons distribution from the introns distribution in the available database, the detection of exon skip is unreliable.3.6. Comparison of the results for intron retention to EST-derived estimatesIdentification of alternative transcripts have relied on comparison of sequences from EST and cDNA databases, a method that is inherently different from the type of analysis carried out here, and, therefore, it is worthy to compare the results. The TAIR6 release contains 31 407 putative genes of which 3159 (10%) have annotated splice variants. Using TAIR annotation (Author Webpage) the type of each splice variant was determined. Out of the 3159 genes, 2251 can be analyzed in the WGA experiments and were composed of two transcripts that could be compared to one another. Of these 468 were shown to be of the retained-intron type, a rate that is considerably lower than the more than 40% that was previously observed.3,7–9 In order to compare the efficiency of both methods the limitations applied to the WGA analysis were applied to the retained introns in the TAIR database. Of the 468 retained introns, 257 met the criteria employed to analyze the existing WGA data. Of these 45 or 18% were detected in common by the WGA method (Supplementary Table S4 is available at Author Webpage). These results indicate the overlapping but complementary nature of both approaches as a tool to determine AS.3.7. Distribution of biological functionalities of transcripts with retained intronsExamining the assigned global functional activity of transcripts with alternatively spliced retained introns will contribute to understanding their function in the biology of the plant. Genes that are analyzed in this study are specific to flowers, root, cell culture or seedling and as a result their gene ontology will be different from the total genes ontology. Therefore, in our case, changes in gene ontology distribution were sought by comparing the retained introns group with the constitutive introns group analyzed in this work rather than to total genes ontology. As nearly 8% of the genes contain retained introns we expect a similar distribution to be emulated in the gene ontology. Deviations from the expected binomial distribution with the P-value set at 0.05 are summarized in Table 3. Strikingly, the groups that are enriched in the retained introns group include mostly RNA processing and signal transduction. In contrast, transcripts related to protein metabolism are particularly underrepresented in the intron retention group.Distribution of assigned gene ontology in genes with retained introns and constitutive intronsThe transcripts with intron retention from the WGA database were classified by the biological processes of their protein products ontology in relation to the constitutive introns from this database. (Author Webpage40 (Details in Supplementary Table S5 available at Author Webpage). Transcripts listed as ‘biological process unknown’ (30% of retained introns) were not included. Note that gene ontology may lead to the classification of one gene into multiple categories. Only classifications containing at least 5 retained introns or 64 constitutive transcripts were included (i.e. at least 0.9% of the expressed transcripts).Distribution of assigned gene ontology in genes with retained introns and constitutive intronsThe transcripts with intron retention from the WGA database were classified by the biological processes of their protein products ontology in relation to the constitutive introns from this database.

Physical characterization of retained intronsDifferences in the physical characteristics of introns, such as size or flanking sequence information, may serve to characterize this class of AS. The characteristics that were measured include; position of the intron in the transcript, i.e. present in the UTR or CDS, whether it contains an open reading frame (ORF), the intron size, its GC content and borders of the intron. Interestingly as a group, the median size of the retained introns is significantly smaller when compared with the size of the constitutive introns irrespective of the presence of an ORF (117 and 176 bp, respectively). The size distributions are statistically different based on the goodness-of-fit hypothesis test (Two-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov, P = 9.5 × 10−44).We note that the median size of introns calculated from the TAIR database (Author Webpage) is 99 bp. The higher means in all types of introns measured here is a direct result of the requirement that introns be represented by at least three probes (i.e. 3 probes × 25 bp size/probe). Interestingly, the GC content of retained introns is higher than that of constitutive introns (37% compare to 33%) but lower than the GC content of coding regions (44%).17 The two GC content distributions are statistically different based on the goodness-of-fit hypothesis test (Two-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov P = 1.5 × 10−139; Supplementary Figure S1 is available at Author Webpage). Higher GC contents have been recently detected in retained introns that were identified by genome EST/cDNA alignments.8 The possibility exists that the higher GC content reflects an artifact that is associated with enhanced non-specific hybridization of probes, i.e. they may be more sensitive to background noise. In order to assess this possibility, we examined the distribution of the GC content of the intron probes whose hybridization values were above or equal 1.09 (Supplementary Figure S2 is available at Author Webpage) In this case, the R2 for the correlation of GC content and hybridization value was found to be 0.06. Hence for the range of hybridization values used in our survey non-specific hybridization is not correlated to GC content and the values measured are a result of true specific hybridization.Additional qualities of note in the characterization of retained introns are that, relatively more retained introns originate from the 5′- and 3′-UTR region compared with the constitutive intron distribution (13.4% compared with 7.3%; Table 4). By comparison, the global analysis predicts that at least 9% of Arabidopsis genes have introns in their UTRs.18,19 Strikingly, inspection of Table 4 shows that 609 (86.6%) of the retained introns are inside the CDS. Yet of these, only 4.6% maintain an in-frame ORF (Table 4). Interestingly this rate, while low, is still more than 3-fold higher than that noted for constitutive introns (1.5%). Finally, Intron borders can play a crucial role in splicing efficiency.20 However a comparison between the borders of the constitutive and retained introns showed no differences (Supplementary Figure S3 is available at Author Webpage). Thus, border sequence cannot be used to predict alternative intron splicing.Characterization of retained and constitutive intronsaRetained introns are Class 1 and Class 2 retained introns.Characterization of retained and constitutive intronsaRetained introns are Class 1 and Class 2 retained introns.4. DiscussionWe demonstrate that direct transcript expression analysis using 'high-density oligonucleotide-based WGA is particularly amenable for assessing global intron retention in Arabidopsis. However, the detection of exon skip is unreliable owing to the difficulty in separating the distribution of the expression values that distinguish exons from introns. We note that detection of alternative 5′ and 3′ splicing sites by analysis of WGA would be limited to those alternative sites that comprise a number of probe lengths (in the present case a minimum of 75 bp). As alternative 5′ and 3′ splice choices are usually of shorter length, they would not generally be detected.Genome-wide detection of retained introns in Arabidopsis reveals that at least 8% of genes that can be surveyed by microarray include a transcript with a retained intron. A sample of these transcripts was tested using RT–PCR and 86% could be verified. In our analysis, results of the WGA data were combined to enable the generation of statistically reliable outcomes. Thus, tissue-specific intron retention may be lost as combining RNA from diverse biological material can obscure the AS signal. In the future, the use of sample repeats from the same tissue will undoubtedly improve the statistical veracity of the results and optimize the detection of aberrant intron behavior. Nonetheless, as intron retention comprises above 40% of all AS events3,7,9 this indicates that overall the rate of AS in Arabidopsis is 20%. This rate is considerably higher than 10–14%, which was garnered from compilation of EST and cDNA data from different sources3,7 but similar to the one that was recently reported from a large collection of EST/cDNA.8 Similarly, the recent application of WGA to human chromosome 21 and 22 showed a much higher rate of AS than previously detected.13The retained-intron type is distinct from the other AS types because it represents an absence or failure of spliceosome action rather than alternative choice of splice junctions. Our analysis detects several features that are specific to retained introns. They are smaller, have higher GC content, are relatively enriched in the UTR and those in the CDS tend to have a slightly higher chance of containing an ORF when compared with a constitutive-type introns. The size of introns has been shown to play a role in AS biology. In Drosophila, the size and location of the flanking introns control the frequency and the type of AS that a pre-mRNA transcript undergoes.21 Furthermore, it is possible that the attribute of higher GC content could contribute to a weaker U-rich splicing signal as a result of less efficient AU protein binding.22 This is because intronic U-rich or AU-rich elements can influence splice site selection and splicing efficiency particularly in plants (reviewed in Simpson and Filipowicz23). These sequences are likely to bind proteins (analogous to animal hnRNP proteins), which may permit intron recognition and recruit or allow access to spliceosomal components and the formation of commitment splicing complexes.Of particular note is that 82.6% (581 out of 703) of the transcripts containing retained introns are in the CDS and would shift reading frames and have an early stop codon. Of these, in 68% (477 out of 703) of the cases the intron that is retained is not the last one. (data not shown). The position of these stop codons is important in the context of potential nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) effects. NMD serves as a surveillance mechanism that removes erroneous mRNAs containing a premature termination codon.24,25 Thus, if NMD mechanism exists in plants, its selective power of degradation is incomplete as the transcripts with AS events are readily detected. The existence of limited use of NMD in plants has recently been shown in the analysis of transcripts containing premature termination codon.26 However, the coupling of AS and NMD could be an important post-transcriptional regulation mechanism to adjust the level of transcript isoforms.27–29Inspection of the intron retention database provides biological insight. RNA processing and signal transduction transcripts appear to be differentially enriched in the retained-introns group. A serine/arginine-rich (SR) family of proteins is implicated in constitutive and AS of pre-mRNAs. They appear in alternatively spliced forms30,31 and at least one of them, SR1, contains a retained intron.32 Transcription factors that show AS variants were described for five genes and in one of them, At1g26260, the first intron is retained.33 Numerous studies have contributed to the view that SR proteins play a general role in splicing and can modulate splice site selection in a concentration-dependent manner (Ref. 34 and reviewed by Manley and Tacke35). One imaginable consequence of this is that cells may regulate the expression or activity of individual SR proteins, or their antagonists, to control the expression of one or more target genes in a tissue-specific and/or developmentally regulated fashion. Transcript that contains intron may serve as a negative regulator of the SR protein concentration.The potential regulatory power of transcripts with retained introns can be gleaned from examination of the database (Supplementary Table S2 is available at Author Webpage). Two examples are NPR1 (At1g64280) and GIGANTEA (At1g22770). NPR1 is a key regulator of the salicylic acid (SA)-mediated systemic acquired resistance (SAR) pathway and it confers resistance to pathogens. Known mutations of this gene cause loss of SAR induction, loss of expression of PR genes and increased susceptibility to infections.36,37 WGA analysis predicts that the last intron of this gene is retained and contains an in-frame stop codon. GIGANTEA promotes flowering under long days in a circadian clock-controlled flowering pathway, together with CONSTANTS (CO) and FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT). Mutations in this gene cause late-flowering phenotype.38 WGA analysis predicts intron 10 (out of 13) to be retained and to contain a stop codon.The biological function of retained introns remains an enigma. A recent survey of human transcripts shows that one-third of the AS contained premature termination codons that are the apparent targets of NMD. It was proposed that regulated unproductive splicing may be a means of modifying the level of protein expression or of introducing modified gene products.39 This work provides a novel database of retained introns and their genomic sites and lays a framework for future application of WGA for dynamic screening of changes in splicing during the plants' life and as a result of environmental input.This research was supported by the Israel Science Foundation grant No 388/02 and by the BARD United States-Israel Binational Agricultural Research and Development Fund Grant number IS-3454-03.Supplementary Data: Supplementary data is available at Author WebpageSupplementary data"

IntroductionThe analysis of regulatory regions is a major challenge for contemporary genomics, which requires both experimental and computational studies. Several software tools are available for predicting transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) in DNA sequences, including MatInspector,1 TRED2 and MATCH.3 Browser rVISTA allows cross-species comparison of TFBSs in the promoters of orthologous genes.4 A database of mouse and human promoters at UIC (PAGen@UIC) contains information on the location of major TFBSs within 2 kb upstream and 250 bp downstream of a transcription start site (TSS).5 The ECR browser6 displays conserved TFBSs in the entire mouse genome, but it uses only a small fraction of known TFBS motifs, and there is no information on non-conserved TFBSs, repeats and CpG islands. This browser does not support queries on specific TFBSs in their promoters. Thus, there is no software that combines genome-wide browsing of TFBSs with sufficient context information (e.g. nucleotide composition, CpG islands, repeat type, evolutionary conservation score and neighboring genes) and tools for analysis of promoters. Furthermore, most tools examine only short segments of promoters, which are not long enough to identify regulatory elements in mammalian genomes. Although the UCSC genome browser7 can incorporate various kinds of DNA annotations including TFBSs, the information on TFBSs is not available for the mouse genome. Besides, the UCSC genome browser does not offer specialized tools for the analysis of regulatory sequences (e.g. highlighting one or several specific TFBSs and searching for pairs of TFBSs at a certain distance).Functional TFBSs are usually clustered because of the cooperative nature of transcription factors.8,9 Clusters of functional TFBSs or cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) are classified into proximal CRMs (i.e. promoters) and distal CRMs (DCRMs) that include enhancers, silencers and insulators.10 In contrast to the proximal CRMs, which have been intensively studied and documented, DCRMs are poorly characterized. The only approach implemented for predicting DCRMs in mouse is the analysis of conserved non-coding sequences.11 To reduce the number of false positives it is important to use additional information including TFBSs as it has been done for Drosophila.12 A database of predicted DCRMs is also required to have common reference points for describing the regulatory regions of specific genes.In this paper we present a browser CisView to visualize and query the locations and internal structures of regulatory regions in the mouse genome in combination with a database of predicted TFBSs and CRMs (Author Webpage).2. Materials and methods1.2. Mapping TFBSs on the mouse genomeTFBSs were predicted in the entire genome using transcription factor binding models (TFBMs) in the form of position-weight matrices or sequence patterns. Most position-weight matrices are based on the TRANSFAC database (public version 7.0).13 Because TRANSFAC database has many redundant entries, we manually combined 291 vertebrate position-weight matrices into 115 groups based on overlapping gene sets and/or matrix similarity. Also we trimmed regions with low-information content or with inconsistencies between various matrices describing binding sites of the same transcription factor (TF), as it is documented in our web site (e.g. Author Webpage). After trimming one matrix was built for each group. A similar effort to group TFBS patterns into a smaller number of families was reported earlier.14 The second major source of TFBMs was the set of 174 patterns over-represented in conserved regions of mammalian promoters.15 Out of these 174 patterns, 69 patterns corresponded to known TFs. We also added TFBMs manually from the literature (see the web site for references). In total, 134 matrices and 219 sequence patterns were used to identify potential TFBSs (below we refer to them simply as TFBSs).Sequence patterns contained both exact matching symbols (A, T, G and C) and degenerate symbols (e.g. R, Y and N). Because mismatches between DNA sequence and a pattern were not allowed, some long patterns generated too few hits. This problem was handled by treating patterns with total information measure for all symbols ≥18 bits (N = 19) as matrices and allowing mismatches as described below. The information measure of a symbol = 2, 1, 0.42 and 0 bits if it included 1, 2, 3 and 4 possible nucleotides at the same position, respectively.Each match of the core pattern was then examined if it also matched with the entire matrix using a similarity score. The similarity score is equal to the sum of character heights in a sequence logo16 divided by the sum of maximum heights at all positions, which is equivalent to the score used in the MatInspector.1 The minimum similarity threshold was allowed to be 0.8 (i.e. 20% mismatch). However, for abundant TFBSs we used higher similarity thresholds adjusted so that the frequency of matches in CpG-rich and CpG-poor semi-random sequences did not exceed 1 per 500 bp and 2000 bp, respectively. We used different thresholds for CpG-rich and CpG-poor semi-random sequences, because CpG islands are enriched in promoters and can be regulated epigenetically17; hence, they are more likely to be enriched in functional TFBSs. Semi-random sequences were generated using third-order Markov models with transition probabilities estimated from CpG-rich and CpG-poor regions in mouse promoters. Following the identification of the similarity threshold for each TFBS, the method was then applied uniformly to the entire genome sequence.2.2. Identification of promoter regionsTo identify TSSs, we used the following primary data sources: (i) the mouse genome sequence assembled in March 2005 (mm6)18; (ii) DBTSS database ver. 5.2, which was compiled from a large set of full-length cDNAs19,20; (iii) NIA Mouse Gene Index, ver. mm6,21,22 which was compiled from all publicly available mouse cDNA sequences (including full-length cDNA sequences from the RIKEN,23 Mammalian Gene Collection,24 KAZUSA25), NCBI RefSeq,26 Ensembl transcripts,27 and expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from dbEST, including the WashU28 and NIA cDNAs29; and (iv) potential TSSs predicted by the FirstEF software, which uses discriminant functions to identify TSSs and potential donor splice sites based on the frequency distribution of short motifs in the DNA sequence.30TSSs were compiled from several databases in an attempt to cover main and alternative transcripts of protein-coding genes in the mouse genome. Depending on the estimated levels of confidence, we arbitrarily divided TSSs into three groups: high-quality, medium-quality and low-quality. TSSs from DBTSS database were considered high-quality because they were identified using a large set of full-length cDNAs19,20. Because the current DBTSS database was based on the earlier version of mouse genome (mm5), we used BLAT31 to remap TSS coordinates to the mouse genome mm6 (N = 18 503 after remapping). Medium-quality TSSs were identified as matches between two independent data sources, if they were >500 bp away from the high-quality TSSs. The first subset (N = 4712) of medium-quality TSSs was taken from protein-coding transcripts (ORF ≥100 amino acids, or known function) in the NIA Mouse Gene Index, ver. mm6,21,22 if they matched with FirstEF software predictions within 300 bp.30 We used 300 bp distance as a threshold for matching criterion, because it corresponds to the false discovery rate (FDR)32 of ∼1% according to the following estimation. If 52 503 TSSs predicted by FirstEF were randomly distributed in the entire genome (3 Gb), then 387 of them in average would appear within 300 bp of 36 829 TSSs identified by aligning mRNA and EST sequences to the genome. Thus, the FDR is equal to 387/36 829 ≅ 1%. The second subset (N = 4219) of medium-quality TSSs was taken from protein-coding transcripts in the NIA Mouse Gene Index if they started within a CpG island but did not match with FirstEF predictions. CpG islands were detected as regions with a minimum of 8 CpG pairs within 250 bp. This threshold was selected based on the frequency distribution of CpG pairs in promoters (shown in the web site). The third subset (N = 27) of medium-quality TSSs was taken from RefSeq sequences if they matched with FirstEF software predictions. Finally, low-quality TSSs (N = 12 960) were taken from the NIA Mouse Gene Index, if they did not match with other data sources.Recent experimental data showed that many promoters had a cluster of transcription starts rather than a single TSS.33,34 However, in the current version of CisView we used only one TSS per promoter as identified by DBTSS, NIA Mouse Gene Index or FirstEF, unless TSSs have opposite orientation or are separated by >500 bp. Although it has also been shown that multiple TSSs exist in the promoters,35 considering all possible transcription starts within a promoter is not feasible currently, because it would increase the size of the database >10 times and cause considerable delays in performing searches. However, most functions of CisView (e.g. finding binding sites within 1 kb upstream of TSSs) are not critically affected by this treatment.Tentative promoter boundaries for high-quality and medium-quality TSSs were set to the boundary of a CpG island, if it was present at TSSs; otherwise they were assumed to span from −200 to +100 bp. The promoter boundaries were then adjusted by excluding transposon-related repeats and CDS, followed by merging with potential CRMs (see below). Promoters for low-quality TSSs were considered only if they coincided with a potential CRM.2.3. Identification of CRMsA potential CRM (below we refer to it simply as a CRM) was defined as a genomic region containing at least four conserved TFBSs within each 200 bp of its length (TFBSs in transposon-related repeats and CDS were not counted). Evolutionary conservation is a reliable indicator of functionality of TFBSs.36,37 If a CRM overlapped with a promoter, then it was merged with the promoter; if it overlapped with the 3′-UTR of genes, we considered it a 3′-UTR-associated CRM; and all other CRMs were considered as DCRMs. 3′-UTR-associated CRMs often regulate post-transcriptional processes such as mRNA stability and translation15; we thus distinguished them from DCRMs, which are most probably involved in the regulation of transcription. Genome conservation scores and repeat coordinates were downloaded from the UCSC database.38 Conservation score 0.5 was used as a threshold to consider a TFBS conserved.Presence of high-quality TFBSs (i.e. with a low mismatch rate) as well as multiple TFBSs of the same kind in a CRM are considered as indicators of its function as a transcriptional regulator.39 Thus, we estimated the Regulatory Potential of a CRM by a Score (RPS), which was a sum of regulatory scores for individual TFBS and regulatory scores for multiple TFBSs of the same kind. Our method of estimating RPS is different from the one by Elnitski et al.40 We used only one genome (mouse), evolutionary conservation scores and matches of known TFBS patterns, whereas Elnitski et al. used multiple genomes without considering known TFBS patterns. The probability of accidental occurrence of TFBSs within a CRM of length L was estimated as P=D(s)·L where s is the similarity score of the binding site and D(s) is the density of binding sites with a similarity score ≥s in a semi-random sequence generated using third-order Markov process. Depending on whether a TFBS was located in a CpG-rich or CpG-poor region, we used semi-random sequence generated with transition probabilities estimated from CpG-rich or CpG-poor regions in the mouse genome, respectively. A regulatory score for a TFBS was estimated as [−log10(P) − 2] if P < 0.01, or set to 0 otherwise. The probability of accidental occurrence of multiple binding sites of the same kind, Pm, was estimated as the product of probabilities of their individual occurrences, P. A regulatory score for multiple TFBSs was estimated as [−log10(Pm) − 2] if Pm < 0.01 or set to 0 otherwise. The RPS, which is a sum of regulatory scores for individual TFBS and multiple TFBSs, was then estimated for all CRMs in the mouse genome. The probability distribution of RPS within CRMs of each size class (from 50 to 150; from 150 to 250; from 250 to 350; …; >1950 bp) was then compared with the probability distribution of RPS estimated for semi-random sequences of size 100, 200, …, 1900, >1900 bp (the last class included sequence sizes from 2000 to 3000 bp) generated using third-order Markov process with transition probabilities from CpG-rich or CpG-poor regions. Probability distributions of RPS were very similar for CpG-rich or CpG-poor semi-random sequences (Supplementary Figure S1 is available at Author Webpage), and, thus, we averaged them and used them for estimating P-values and the FDR of RPS in CRMs in the same size class. After sorting all CRMs by increasing P-values we estimated the false discovery rate for i-th CRM as FDR i = PiN/i, where Pi is the P-value for i-th CRM and N is the total number of CRMs.32 We considered that a CRM had a significantly higher RPS than in semi-random sequences if FDR was ≤0.1.2.4. Software and web interface developmentThe CisView browser uses cgi scripts (Perl) for generating pictures and web pages. To accelerate data processing we created data files, which included all the information on genes, sequences and TFBSs for each 60 kb region. Query tools allow users to search for specific TFBS patterns or their combinations in promoters or in DCRMs, to search for specific genes based on gene symbols, annotations, gene ontology (GO) terms or protein domains,and to search for promoters with different quality and/or with a TATA box. Any list of promoters produced by the query tool or uploaded by a user can be further analyzed for TFBSs over-represented in the list and GO terms and protein domains associated preferentially with the list. Protein domains and GO annotations were identified within the NIA Mouse Gene Index21 using InterPro41 and Gene Ontology database.42 Over-representation of TFBSs in promoters of genes with specific GO annotations was evaluated statistically using z-scores estimated by the hypergeometric distribution and FDR ≤ 0.1. Three regions of the promoter, i.e. the upstream region of TSSs (−1000 to −200 bp), at TSSs (−200 to 50 bp) and the downstream region of TSSs (0 to 500 bp), were analyzed separately. In each promoter we determined the presence of a single TFBS, multiple TFBSs and pairs of TFBSs separated by 100 bp. For each GO term we sorted TFBS models by increasing P-values and then estimated the FDR as described above. In our website we presented only TFBSs with over-representation ratio >1.5.An example screen shot of the CisView browser is shown in Fig. 1. Data are displayed using seven scales in the same page: (i) whole chromosome, (ii) 3 Mb, (iii) 300 kb, (iv) 60 kb, (v) 4 kb, (vi) 500 bp and (vi) 80 bp (4 kb and 500 bp scales are skipped in Fig. 1). The location of TFBSs is shown starting from the 60 kb scale. It is possible to highlight specific TFBS patterns, filter them by conservation score or similarity/difference threshold and to display new patterns defined by the user. Infor-mation on TFBSs is displayed together with background information on exons and CDS locations, TSSs, repeats and CRMs. The DNA sequence is characterized by the frequency of CG pairs (e.g. CpG islands) as well as some other motifs like CCCC/GGGG, which is known to be associated with regulatory regions.43CisView output for genes Zfp142 and Bcs1l (scales for 4 kb and 500 bp are not shown).CisView output for genes Zfp142 and Bcs1l (scales for 4 kb and 500 bp are not shown).3. Results3.1. Genome-wide mapping of TFBSsMapping of TFBSs and TSSs in the entire mouse genome was described in the Materials and Methods section. Genome-wide searches of 353 TFBMs (134 matrices and 219 sequence patterns) resulted in 99.5 matches per 1 kb of genomic sequence on average. However, semi-random artificial genome sequences generated using third-order Markov process showed 94.2 matches per 1 kb, suggesting that up to 95% of the TFBSs could be false positives. This is an inevitable outcome of the shortness of TFBMs and is the source of a major difficulty for the computational identification of TFBSs in the genome. Our goal was to include all potential TFBSs in the database and, thus, the large proportion of possible false positives among putative TFBSs was anticipated. In contrast, we estimated that the proportion of false negatives was relatively small (37%), because out of 2502 TFBSs included in TRANSFAC database, 1573 were identified properly using our algorithm. This proportion may even be over-estimated, because some of these TFBSs were of poor quality. For example, out of 11 TFBMs for a matrix V$SP1_01, none matched the SP1 pattern identified by Xie et al.15 and none was identified with our algorithm.To identify the subset of TFBSs that is more likely to be functional, we provided tools to filter the TFBSs according to user-defined parameters for evolutionary sequence conservation scores, mismatch scores, associations with TSSs, associations with other TFBSs and associations with genes characterized by a specific GO term. Three examples of using such information and their utilities will be described below. The analysis below will also serve as the assessment for the quality of TFBSs in the CisView database, although the functionality of TFBSs can only be tested by experimental validations.3.2. Analyses of TSS-associated TFBSsThe proximity of TFBSs to the TSSs is one of the key parameters for the functionality of TFBSs. We, therefore, analyzed the distribution of TFBSs in the so-called promoter regions that span from −1 kb to +1 kb. Obviously, the analyses will be greatly influenced by the accuracy of TSS locations. In the CisView database/browser, the TSSs were grouped into three categories according to the reliability of data source: 18 503 high-quality TSSs, 8958 medium-quality TSSs and 12 960 low-quality TSSs (see Materials and Methods for the details). Because it is known that TSSs are often associated with an increased density of CpG pairs,17,44,45 we plotted the distribution of CpG pairs for each TSS group (Fig. 2A). The density of CpG pairs had a clear peak near high-quality and medium-quality TSSs, but no peak near low-quality TSSs. Therefore, we first focused on the high-quality TSSs and identified 122 TFBMs that formed a peak of TFBS abundance in the immediate upstream region of high-quality TSSs (from −100 to 0 bp). The peak of TFBS abundance for these 122 TFBMs was statistically higher (chi square, FDR < 0.05) than the TFBS density in the background (from −1000 to −600 bp and from +600 to +1000 bp) (Supplementary Table S3 is available at Author Webpage). These TFBMs included TF_SP1, ADD_ZF5, MIT_001NRF1, TF_ELK, TF_NFY, TF_AHR, TF_GABP, ADD_WHN, TF_MAZR, TF_ATF1, TF_AP2. Similarly, the density of these TSS-associated TFBSs near the medium-quality TSSs also showed a peak, but as expected there was no peak near low-quality TSSs (Fig. 2B).Distribution of CpG pairs (A) and TSS-associated TFBSs (B) near TSSs.Distribution of CpG pairs (A) and TSS-associated TFBSs (B) near TSSs.To analyze the TSS-associated TFBSs further, we plotted the distributions of TFBSs for individual TFBMs in CpG-rich and CpG-poor promoter regions separately (Fig. 3, plots for all TFBMs are available on our website). Out of the 353 TFBS distributions that we analyzed, 109 showed peaks at a specific distance from the TSSs either in CpG-rich and CpG-poor promoters at least in one orientation (Supplementary Table S4 is available at Author Webpage, Fig. 3). The peaks were significantly higher than the background (FDR ≤ 0.1). For example, TF_TATA (TATA-box for Tbp) was considerably more abundant in CpG-poor promoters than in CpG-rich promoters (Fig. 3), which is consistent with the previous report.46 Some TFBMs showed association with TSSs in CpG-poor promoters (e.g. TF_TATA, MIT_042), whereas others showed association with TSSs in CpG-rich promoters (e.g. TF_SP1, TF_YY1, TF_ETS) (Fig. 3). Most of these peaks were located in a narrow region of the promoter, but some were distributed within the entire CpG islands and showed a broader peak in the plot (Fig. 3, TF_SP1). However, the CpG content alone cannot explain the entire pattern of TF_SP1 distributions. There was a significant over-representation of TF_SP1 sites from −150 to 0 bp, even after removal of the effect of CpG abundance. Interestingly, we noted that 43 TFBSs had a significant orientation bias (FDR ≤ 0.10), which exceeded a 2-fold difference for TF_TATA, TF_YY1, MIT_010YY1, TF_CDX, MIT_063, MIT_075STAT, MIT_076AREB6, MIT_095, MIT_102, MIT_0129 and MIT_148.Distribution of selected TFBSs in CpG-poor and CpG-rich promoters (TSS = transcription start site).Distribution of selected TFBSs in CpG-poor and CpG-rich promoters (TSS = transcription start site).We combined these two lists of TFBMs (122 TFBMs from Supplementary Table S3 and 109 TFBMs from Supplementary Table S4 are available at Author Webpage), which were derived from different methods of analysis, and obtained 145 TFBMs associated with TSSs. Association with TSSs has been reported earlier for 56 binding patterns by Xie et al.15 The current study confirmed 51 of these patterns and also identified 72 additional TFBMs (excluding redundancy) for the first time (Supplementary Tables S3 and S4 are available at Author Webpage). The analysis and identification of TSS-associated TFBSs for these 145 TFBMs seem to increase one's chance to identify the functional TFBSs located in the promoter regions.3.3. Analyses of CRMsWe assume that predicted TFBSs located within CRMs are more likely to be functional than other TFBSs, because they are evolutionary conserved and clustered. This feature is especially important for TFBSs located far from TSSs, which are known to play an important role in the regulation of mammalian genes, because the association with TSSs cannot be used to filter TFBSs. Therefore, we searched for potential CRMs defined as clusters of conserved TFBSs (see Materials and Methods for the details). Based on the grouping of conserved TFBSs we found 739 074 CRMs, which included 26 611 promoters and 22 419 CRMs associated with 3′-UTR, and 690 044 DCRMs (Table 1). Some promoters (N = 1991) included multiple TSSs, the majority of which were bi-directional.47 There were 17 053 promoters with high-quality TSSs, 7959 promoters with medium-quality TSSs and 1599 promoters with only low-quality TSSs. Coordinates, sequences, regulatory potential scores (RPS) and FDR values for CRMs can be downloaded from the web site (Author Webpage).Summary information on cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) in CisViewSummary information on cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) in CisViewAmong all CRMs, 157 442 (21.3%) had a significantly higher (FDR ≤ 0.1) RPS than in comparable semi-random sequences. The proportion of significant CRMs was consistent with the quality of promoters assigned in CisView (Table 1). It was highest among the promoters with high-quality TSSs (54.8%) and lowest among the promoters with low-quality TSSs (17.6%). This association also supports our classification of promoter quality.By definition, DCRMs are not located in the vicinity of TSSs or promoter regions, but they may still be associated with TSSs from a long-range perspective. Thus, we analyzed the association of DCRMs with the TSSs by plotting their frequency distribution in the large region that spans from −30 kb to +30 kb (Fig. 4). A gap in the center of the graph corresponded to the promoter region, which was omitted from this analysis, because it was already analyzed in the Section 3.2. Results showed that the DCRMs had a strong association with TSSs within the distance of 10–15 kb. Interestingly, the DCRMs were more enriched in the downstream regions (e.g. first introns) than in the upstream regions.Distribution of the total length of potential distal cis-regulatory modules (DCRMs) located at the specific distance from transcription start sites (TSSs) of high and medium quality: (A) distance to all TSSs, (B) distance to the nearest TSS. The gap in the middle corresponds to promoters which were not counted here.Distribution of the total length of potential distal cis-regulatory modules (DCRMs) located at the specific distance from transcription start sites (TSSs) of high and medium quality: (A) distance to all TSSs, (B) distance to the nearest TSS. The gap in the middle corresponds to promoters which were not counted here.Out of 39 experimentally tested DCRMs, 32 (82%) were present in the CisView database (Table 2). Seven missing DCRMs had insufficient conservation scores and, thus, were not identified using our algorithm. We, thus, assume that the majority of functional DCRMs are already included in the CisView database, although it may still contain false positives. Only 12 of the validated DCRMs had a significantly higher (FDR ≤ 0.1) RPS than in semi-random sequences. This indicates that criteria used for estimating the regulation potential score (presence of rare or high quality TFBSs and multiple TFBSs of the same kind) are not sufficient for a reliable identification of functional CRMs. Thus, we included all predicted DCRMs in the CisView browser, even if their RPS was not significantly higher than in semi-random sequences. Although the RPS is not 100% reliable, we found it useful for comparison of groups of regulatory regions (e.g. promoters of different quality).Known distal cis-regulatory modules (DCRMs) and their representation in CisViewa RPS is significantly higher (FDR ≤ 0.1) than in semi-random sequences generated using the third-order Markov process.Known distal cis-regulatory modules (DCRMs) and their representation in CisViewa RPS is significantly higher (FDR ≤ 0.1) than in semi-random sequences generated using the third-order Markov process.3.4. Analyses of TFBSs by GO annotationsGene Ontology (GO) annotations can help to identify the subsets of TFBSs that are most likely functional. For example, TF_E2F binding site was over-represented in promoters of genes involved in the cell cycle (GO:0007049, N = 117, Author Webpage), which is consistent with previous studies.48 Thus, TF_E2F binding sites that were identified in promoters of these 117 genes are more likely to be functional than those in other promoters.We also examined TFBSs in promoters of well-established muscle-specific genes.49 We identified 12 TFBMs over-represented (FDR < 0.05) in 28 promoters of muscle-specific genes49 from −1000 to +200 bp (Supplementary Table S1 is available at Author Webpage). These TFBMs included TEF, MEF2, MYOD and SRF, which are known to regulate the expression of muscle-specific genes.50 SP1, which is also considered as muscle-specific transcription factor,50 had 39 predicted binding sites in these promoters but their over-representation was not statistically significant (FDR = 0.143). Additional TFBMs over-represented in promoters of muscle-specific genes were KLF, AP4, PAX4 and SREBP. Next, we identified 2017 promoters that contained a combination of multiple MYOD and at least one MEF2 binding sites within the region from −1000 to +200 bp. As expected, a top GO term over-represented in the list of corresponding genes was muscle development (GO:0007517, N = 26, FDR < 0.001) (Supplementary Table S2 is available at Author Webpage). Other muscle-related GO terms were also significantly over-represented in this list of genes (e.g. contractile fiber, myofibril, sarcomere, actin binding and muscle cell differentiation).4. DiscussionIn this paper we present a CisView, a freely available online browser and database of mouse regulatory regions and TFBSs in the entire mouse genome. The CisView browser provides information not only on TFBS locations but also on genome contexts including neighboring genes, their exon structure, TSSs, CpG-rich regions, repeats of various types, conservation scores, potential CRMs and CpG islands. With easy navigation tools, the browser can be used to find putative gene targets for any transcription factor or a group of transcription factors. Also it can be used to find over-represented TFBSs or pairs of TFBSs in promoters of a given set of genes. The latter feature is useful for the analysis of co-expressed genes identified by microarray analyses. Users can upload their lists of genes or transcripts and analyze them in various ways. Information on GO terms and protein domains for all the genes makes it possible to select a group of genes that belong to a particular pathway (or share the same protein domain) and then to explore common regulatory elements in their promoters or other CRMs. As far as we know, this is the first database and web interface that combine all these analytical tools in a single package.The CisView database contain TFBMs from the TRANSFAC database (public version 7.0)13 and various literature sources including reports on individual genes, e.g. Nanog,51 CTCF52 and LHR-1.53 We have implemented a new method to determine the core of the binding motif by assessing the most dramatic change in nucleotide frequencies. The current set of TFBMs covers 85% (78 of 92 TFBMs) of core position-weight matrices in the JASPAR database.54 In addition to 18 503 high-quality TSSs remapped from DBTSS ver. 5.2, we have identified computationally 8958 medium-quality TSSs, which have very similar distributions of CpG pairs and TSS-associated TFBSs to those of high-quality TSSs. All these medium-quality TSSs are most likely functional, because they are supported by either full-length cDNAs, ESTs or gene models (NCBI and Ensembl). Frequent localizations of many TFBMs (e.g. KLF, NERF, TEL, HTF, ZF5, MAF, CTCF and MAZ) at specific distances from TSSs have been shown for the first time. The database also represents 690 044 DCRMs, which include 82% of known DCRMs based on our estimates. This set of DCRMs can be used for exploring their structure and function both experimentally and computationally. Predicted DCRMs matched well with experimentally determined DCRMs. Also they were over-represented within 10–15 kb from TSSs, which is an indirect indication of their role in the regulation of transcription.Although we expect that CisView provides a useful platform for the analysis of regulatory regions in the mouse genome, we are also aware of limitations in our approach. A set of motifs that we used for the identification of TFBSs is still incomplete. Currently it accounts for 294 transcription factors. This number may be an under-estimation because many paralogous transcription factors use the same binding motif. Nonetheless, it is definitely smaller than the total number of transcription factors (N = 2068, NIA Mouse Gene Index, GO:0006355). We also used 105 putative TFBS motifs for which corresponding transcription factors have not been identified yet. Because of the high proportion of false positives, it is important to use additional information on TFBSs, including conservation score, position within a promoter, proximity to other TFBSs, association with functionally related gene sets using tools that are available in the CisView. The method for identification of CRMs, which relies heavily on conservation scores, may not work for non-conserved regulatory regions. To overcome this limitation in the future we plan to use milder criteria of conservation55 and/or take into account additional information on TFBSs (e.g. similarity scores and association with other TFBSs). The set of analytical tools integrated into CisView can find promoters with a specific combination of up to three TFBSs and identify over-represented TFBSs in a given set of promoters. However, tools for more specialized tasks (e.g. TFBS-based alignment of genomic sequences) are not included. These additional tasks can be handled by other software, e.g. Enhancer Element Locator,56 Eponine57 or Genomatix Suite.58In summary, the CisView browser/database provides a user-friendly computer environment for studying trancription regulation on the whole-genome scale. Information on TFBSs is presented with the context of neighboring genes and their structures, GO annotations, protein domains, DNA repeats and CpG islands. Analytical tools include search for genes with a specific combination of TFBSs, identification of TFBSs over-represented in a given set of gene promoters and/or enhancers and plotting the distribution of TFBSs within a set of promoters. CisView can be used for interpreting microarray experiments and identifying putative targets of transcription factors.We thank Ramana V.

IntroductionGenomic DNA in bacterial cells is a platform for the action of proteins involved in DNA transactions and is folded into a compact structure called a nucleoid. DNA supercoiling, macromolecular crowding and nucleoid-associated proteins contribute to nucleoid compaction, although the detailed architecture is not yet fully understood.1 Among the bacterial nucleoid-associated proteins, a heterogeneous family of basic, low molecular weight, and abundant DNA-binding proteins, often called histone-like proteins, play fundamental roles in nucleoid organization.2The Escherichia coli genome encodes at least seven related histone-like proteins. The extensively characterized heat-stable nucleoid-structuring protein (H-NS) is one of the main histone-like proteins expressed at high levels during exponential growth.3 It is a small (136 amino acids) and abundant (>20 000 copies per cell) protein, consisting of three structural domains. The C-terminal domain of H-NS (residues 90–136) binds DNA in a relatively sequence-independent manner and recognizes intrinsically curved DNA. The N-terminal domain of H-NS (residues 1–64) is a dimerization domain, and the H-NS dimer formed through this domain bridges two DNA segments.4 H-NS has the capacity to form larger oligomers, possibly through interactions between the flexible linker domain connecting the dimerization and DNA-binding domains. The lateral interaction of H-NS dimers allows the extension of H-NS binding from high-affinity nucleation sites to flanking low affinity sequences.5 Recent atomic force microscopy experiments revealed that, after the initial binding of H-NS to DNA at distant sites, the H-NS assembles into patches of oligomers bridging the segments of DNA.6 The bridging of DNA segments by H-NS plays a role in the compaction of DNA and higher order nucleoid organization. This is supported by the finding that overexpression of H-NS leads to abnormally compacted nucleoids in E. coli.7In addition to a role in nucleoid organization, H-NS acts as a pleiotropic regulator of gene expression. Comparison of gene expression profiles of wild type and hns-inactivated E. coli cells by microarray analysis demonstrates that the expression level of about 200 genes is directly or indirectly altered in the hns mutant.8 Approximately one-third of these genes encode cell envelope components or proteins involved in adaptation to changes in environmental conditions. This suggests that H-NS directly or indirectly regulates adaptation to different environmental conditions. A number of H-NS-responsive promoters contain regions of intrinsic DNA curvature located upstream and/or downstream of the transcription start point, and the lateral binding of H-NS at preferential binding sites that extend over the promoter region is thought to be sufficient for repression of transcription.5 A number of complex mechanisms underlying the inhibition of initiation or elongation of transcription have been proposed. Bending of the promoter sequence by RNA polymerase induces the bridging of two flanking H-NS bound sequences at the rrnB P1 promoter, resulting in the trapping of RNA polymerase in a non-productive state.6,9 Repression by H-NS at the bgl operon occurs at two levels, repression of promoter activity through upstream binding and blocking of transcription elongation by downstream binding.10 Recent in vitro experiments showed that DNA wrapped around RNA polymerase associates with the sigma 70 (σD) subunits and induces looping of the hdeAB promoter sequence when H-NS is bound to upstream and downstream regions, resulting in blockage of transition from the open to the elongation complex of RNA polymerase.11 In addition to a role in repression of transcription, H-NS may act as an activator of transcription,12,13 although there is no direct evidence that H-NS has the capacity to act as a direct activator of transcription. H-NS is also involved in the maintenance of local superhelicity of genome DNA by forming a topological barrier and thereby inhibiting the expression of superhelicity-sensitive promoters.14Thus, extensive studies on E. coli H-NS since its first detailed biochemical characterization in 198415 have revealed important principles of action in DNA compaction and regulation of gene expression. Our understanding of the action of H-NS is still fragmented and a comprehensive assessment of the action of H-NS in bacterial cells is still lacking. A wide variety of eukaryotic studies have used ChIP-chip analysis, a powerful new tool that employs genome-wide high-resolution DNA tiling chips (oligonucleotide chips) for the fine mapping of transcribed regions in combination with chromatin immunoprecipitation, for monitoring the distribution of genome associated proteins in vivo.16,17 A limited number of similar studies in bacteria have been reported. Very recently, ChIP-chip analyses using different oligonucleotide tiling chip formats have been employed to investigate the genome-wide distribution of RNA polymerase and the transcriptional regulators, LexA, Crp and MelR.18–21 During preparation of the present report, H-NS distribution on the Salmonella genome has appeared.22In this study, we designed a custom Affymetrix oligonucleotide chip consisting of 50 085 25 mer probe sets that match protein coding sequences (>100 amino acids) at 45–55 bp intervals and 82 023 probe sets at 2–3 bp intervals, for both strands of the remaining sequences. ChIP-chip analysis was performed using this custom oligonucleotide chip to map H-NS and RNA polymerase associated sequences in E. coli cells grown in LB medium. We also determined transcriptionally active regions in wild type and hns-inactivated cells using the same high-density chip. These new approaches revealed that H-NS binds specifically to about 250 loci in the genome, covering >1000 genes in total, to maintain transcriptional inactivation. H-NS binding sites containing intrinsically curved A-tract sequences were identified at a high density, consistent with the preferential binding of H-NS to curved DNA. In >65% of H-NS binding sites, the binding of β and σD subunits of RNA polymerase was clearly associated with low or no transcriptional activity, indicating that repression of transcription by H-NS involves the binding of RNA polymerase. Furthermore, our genome-wide analysis of H-NS binding sites revealed the preferential association of H-NS with DNA predicted to be horizontally acquired into the E. coli genome. We propose that the main role of H-NS is to repress the inappropriate expression of horizontally acquired genes under normal growth conditions, allowing their stable transmission and diversification of the E. coli genome. Thus, the genome-wide approach described in this study represents a comprehensive assessment of the genomic distribution of H-NS, sheds light on the mechanism underlying the transcriptional regulation by H-NS, and provides new insight into bacterial genome evolution.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Array designThe E. coli K-12 MG1655 genome sequence and other genetic information was retrieved from NCBI GenBank (Author Webpage), accession number U00096, and used for the design of probes according to the Affymetrix guidelines. Probe sequences were selected for protein coding regions (3871 regions) and inter-genic regions (5236 regions) using different criteria. Apart from the rrnA operon, rRNA genes were excluded from probe design (16S, 23S, 5S). The tRNA genes and protein coding genes with lengths of <100 amino acids were treated as inter-genic regions. As a result, 50 085 25 mer sequences on the coding strand were selected for protein coding regions at 45–55 bp intervals, and 82 023 sequences on both strands were selected for inter-genic regions at 2–3 bp intervals. Thus, 132 108 probe sets (perfect match and mismatch probes) were synthesized on the chip. Chip probe information is available on our web site (Author Webpage).2.2. Bacterial strainsW3110 was used as a wild-type strain of E. coli K-12. The Δhns strain (RM597) is a derivative of W3110.23 Both strains were provided by Dr. K. Ito (University of Tokyo). The hns gene was tagged at the 3′-terminus with the 3 × FLAG sequence using the epitope tagging procedure.24 The 3 × FLAG sequence followed by the Kanamycin resistant cassette was PCR amplified from the plasmid pSUB1124 using primers, 5′- TGAGCAAGGTAAATCCCTCGACGATTTCCTGATCAAGCAAGACTACAAAGACCATGACGG -3′ and 5′- GGACAATAAAAAATCCCGCCGCTGGCGGGATTTTAAGCAACATATGAATATCCTCCTTAG -3′, and inserted into the 3′ end of the chromosomal hns gene of the E. coli strain BW25113(pKD46) using homologous sequences added to the primers. Proper addition of the 3 × FLAG tag was confirmed by PCR amplification using appropriate primers. The hns-3 × FLAG allele was transduced to W3110 by P1 transduction. Expression of the 3 × FLAG H-NS protein in W3110 was confirmed by western blotting using the anti-flag antibody (data not shown).2.3. High-resolution transcriptome analysisAn aliquot (0.25 ml) of an overnight liquid culture of wild-type and Δhns cells in LB medium at 37°C was inoculated into 50 ml of LB medium (pH7.4) in a 300 ml flask. When the cells, grown aerobically by rotationally shaking at 200 r.p.m. at 37°C, reached an OD600 of 0.5, 10 ml of culture was mixed with 20 ml of RNA protect (Qiagen) and the cells were collected by centrifugation and stored at −80°C. Total RNA was purified from collected cells using the RNeasy mini kit according to the manufacturer's instruction (Qiagen). Synthesis of cDNA, terminal labeling, and hybridization with the oligonucleotide chip was performed following the Affymetrix instruction manual (Affymetrix). Briefly, cDNA was synthesized from 10 μg of total RNA using random primers and reverse transcriptase (Superscript III; Invitrogen), followed by purification using Qiaquick purification columns (Qiagen) and digestion with DNaseI (GE Healthcare Bioscience). Then cDNA fragments were terminally labeled with biotin-ddUTP using ENZO BioArray Terminal Labeling Kit (Enzo Life Sciences). Hybridization with the oligonucleotide chip was performed for 16 h at 42°C, followed by washing, staining and scanning using the GeneChip Instrument System, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Affymetrix). PCR amplification of the cDNA was avoided to allow the coding strands of each transcript to be distinguished.To compensate for the differences in hybridization efficiency of each 25 mer probe on the chip, we divided the hybridization intensities of cDNA synthesized from total RNA by those of the total genome DNA. Genomic DNA was purified from the collected cells using the DNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) and 1 μg was digested with DNaseI (GE Healthcare Bioscience) for 15 min at 37°C, followed by end-labeling and hybridization with the oligonucleotide chip as described above.2.4. ChIP-Chip analysisCross-linking and purification of DNA–protein complexes were carried out according to Grainger et al.19 Immunoprecipitation of the complex, recovery of precipitated DNA fragments, and amplification and end-labeling were performed using the protocol specified for high-resolution DNA tiling chip analysis.17 The antibodies W0004 and W0023 (NeoClone), against the σD and the β RNA polymerase subunits, respectively, and the Pan mouse immunoglobulin beads, #110.22 (Invitrogen), were used for ChIP-chip analysis of RNA polymerase binding sites. The antibody against the FLAG tag (Sigma-Aldrich) and Dynal Dynabeads protein A beads, #100.02 (Invitrogen) were used for H-NS analysis. Pan mouse immunoglobulin beads and protein A beads were mixed with antibodies at 4°C for several hours and washed twice with 0.5 ml of cold TBS containing 5 mg/ml BSA, before use.E. coli cells were grown to an OD600 of 0.5, as described for RNA preparation, then 10 ml of culture was transferred to a tube containing formaldehyde (final concentration of 1%) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The cross-linking reaction was terminated by the addition of 1.5 ml of 3 M glycine, and cells were collected by centrifugation at 3000 r.p.m. for 15 min, followed by washing with TBS and lysis buffer (10 mM Tris–HCl pH 8.0, 20% sucrose, 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA). Cells were lysed by incubation with 20 mg/ml Lysozyme in lysis buffer at 37°C for 30 min and stored at −20°C until use. Lysed cells were dissolved in 4 ml of IP buffer (50 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) and incubated at 37°C for 10 min with PMSF at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. The sample was then sonicated 10 times for 1 min at 1 min intervals on ice using an Astrason XL2020 sonicator. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 15 000 r.p.m. for 30 min. The supernatant fraction (whole cell extract) was mixed with the magnetic beads bound to the antibody and incubated at 4°C overnight. The magnetic beads were washed twice with 750 μl then 500 μl of IP buffer while rotating at 4°C for 5 min each. The beads were further washed with 500 μl each of IP salt buffer (IP buffer containing 500 mM NaCl), IP wash buffer (10 mM Tris–HCl pH 8.0, 250 mM LiCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% Sodium deoxycolate) then finally in TE buffer. The DNA–protein complex bound to the beads was recovered by eluting with 100 μl of elution buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 10 mM EDTA, 1% SDS). Protein was removed by a 20 min incubation at 65°C, followed by an incubation at 42°C for 2 h then 65°C for 6 h with 5 mg/ml proteinase K. DNA fragments free of DNA–protein cross-links were purified using the Qiagen PCR clean up kit (Qiagen) and eluted with 100 μl of Buffer EB supplied in the kit. Recovered DNA fragments were amplified according to the random DNA amplification method described by Katou et al.17 using the primers, PF 43 and PF 44.20 The PCR reaction was performed using 28 cycles for the H-NS analysis and 34 cycles for the RNA polymerase subunit analysis, using Phusion high-fidelity DNA polymerase (Bio-Rad). Amplified DNA fragments were terminally labeled and hybridized with the oligonucleotide chip as described for the transcript mapping.To compensate for positional differences in the efficiency of DNA recovery, most likely due to differences in the complexity and strength of local DNA–protein interactions, we normalized the hybridization intensities of DNA recovered from the immuno-precipitated complexes by dividing the values with those determined from DNA isolated from the whole cell extract of the control strain, W3110. Following cross-linking and sonication, a 100 μl aliquot of supernatant from the W3110 cells was incubated at 65°C for 20 min for de-crosslinking, followed by phenol–chloroform treatment and ethanol precipitation. PCR amplification for 28 cycles followed by terminal labeling was performed using a 10 ng sample of DNA.2.5. Data analysisWe developed a program to extract and manipulate raw intensity data (.CEL files), and to display results along the genome coordinate of strain MG1655. The genome sequence of strain W3110 used in this study has only 8 bp differences, 12 IS insertions and 1 phage deletion when compared with the MG1655 strain, although the sequence between rrnD and rrnE is inverted.25We subtracted signal intensities of mismatch probes from those of perfect match probes for use as signal intensities.26 Probes with a negative value for signal intensity were excluded from further analysis. For transcript mapping, cDNA signal intensities were divided by the signal intensities of genome DNA, to normalize the differences in hybridization efficiency of probes on the chip (transcriptional activity signals).27 For the ChIP-chip analysis, the signal intensities of DNA in the immuno-precipitated fraction were divided by those determined for DNA isolated from the whole cell extract fraction before precipitation (binding signals, enrichment in the chromatin immuno-precipitated fraction ).17 The distribution of transcriptional activity and protein binding signals along the genome coordinate was visualized and transcriptionally active regions, H-NS binding sites and RNA polymerase binding sites were assessed manually. All experiments were carried out more than two times, and average signal intensities were used for the analysis.2.6. Factorial correspondence analysis of codon usageThe codon usage pattern has been determined for all protein coding genes in the E. coli genome.28 Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed against the frequency of codon usage of all genes and the clustering results were projected onto a two-dimensional field.3. Results3.1. Genome-wide ChIP-chip analysis of H-NS binding regionsWe performed ChIP-chip analysis using 3 × FLAG-tagged H-NS sequences to construct a map of H-NS binding sites on the whole E. coli genome as described in Materials and Methods. A strain of E. coli, with the native hns gene in-frame with the 3 × FLAG sequence at the 3′ terminus, was constructed by epitope tagging24 and used to isolate DNA fragments associated with H-NS in vivo. The addition of the tag to H-NS had no significant effects on the growth of E. coli cells and repression of transcription of the lysU gene by H-NS23 (data not shown). We developed a program to manipulate raw hybridization data and to display final results along the E. coli genome coordinate, and H-NS binding sites were assessed manually. As the results, H-NS was found to specifically bind to about 250 loci along the E. coli genome, covering >1000 genes (Supplementary Table S1 and Figure S1; see also the authors' web site: Author Webpage). Previously reported H-NS binding sites for proV, lysU and bglG genes were clearly detected among these loci (Fig. 1A–C).10,23,29–32 In 15 loci, H-NS covers a wide region >10 kb, including several well-known H-NS targets (see Fig. 2A).11,33 As H-NS binds to intrinsically curved and phased A-tract sequences,5,34 we investigated the association of the density of A-tract sequences (AnTm sequences, where 4 ≤ (n + m) )35 with the peak position of H-NS binding signals in selected regions (Fig. 2A and B). As expected, peaks of H-NS binding sites correlated with A-tract sequences. A genome-wide analysis showed a strong correlation between the average signal strength of H-NS binding of probes in each protein coding sequences and the density of A-tract sequences in the sequence (Fig. 2C).H-NS binding profiles around genes regulated by H-NS.

High-resolution transcriptome analysis of wild type and hns-inactivated cellsTo examine whether the H-NS binding detected by ChIP-chip analysis is related to gene expression, the transcriptionally active regions of the E. coli genome were mapped in wild type and hns-inactivated (Δhns) cells using the same high-density oligonucleotide chip as described in Materials and Methods (Supplementary Figure S1).A comparison of transcriptional activity with H-NS binding sites in wild-type cells revealed that the transcriptional activity of H-NS bound regions is generally low, as is observed, for example, in the fimbria-related gene cluster, yadCKLM-htrE-ecpD-yadN where H-NS binds to whole coding sequences (Fig. 3B) and in the LPS synthesis related genes, wza-wzb-wzc-wcaA-H where promoter region is covered by H-NS (Fig. 3C). By comparison, transcriptional active loci such as the ribosomal protein operon (Fig 3A) generally have no bound H-NS. In confirmation of these findings, a scatter plot of signal intensities of H-NS binding and transcriptional activity for each probe showed a reverse correlation (Fig. 3D), demonstrating that the transcriptional activity of H-NS bound sites is significantly lower than the transcriptional activity of unbound regions.Comparison of transcriptional activity and H-NS binding signals. Transcription activity signals and H-NS, β and σD binding signals are shown for selected regions; the rpsL locus encoding ribosomal proteins and translation factors (A), the yadN-yadC locus densely covered by H-NS (B), and the wza-wcaH locus encoding colonic acid biosynthesis related genes and silenced by partial H-NS binding (C). Transcriptional activity signals are calculated by dividing the hybridization intensity of cDNA with that for genome DNA. The genome-wide correlation between transcriptional activity signals and H-NS binding signals for each 25mer probe on the chip is shown in panel D.Comparison of transcriptional activity and H-NS binding signals.

Transcriptional activity signals are calculated by dividing the hybridization intensity of cDNA with that for genome DNA. The genome-wide correlation between transcriptional activity signals and H-NS binding signals for each 25mer probe on the chip is shown in panel D.A comparison of transcriptional profiles in wild type and hns-inactivated cells showed that derepression of transcription in the mutant cells occurs at about 65% of the H-NS bound loci (Supplementary Table S1). Typical examples of derepression of transcription by H-NS inactivation are shown in Fig. 4. In some H-NS repressed genes, other factors are required to activate expression, even when H-NS is removed from the cell. For example, activation of transcription of the bgl promoter is dependent upon the activator protein, CRP, in addition to the removal of bound H-NS.32Derepression of transcriptional activity of H-NS bound genes in the hns-inactivated cells. H-NS binding signals in wild type (W3110) cells and transcriptional activity signals in wild type (W3110) and hns-inactivated (Δhns) cells are shown for selected regions; the yagK (A), the ykgB (B) and the yhiM (C) loci. Transcriptional activities of Watson and Crick strands are shown above and below the ORF map, respectively.Derepression of transcriptional activity of H-NS bound genes in the hns-inactivated cells.

Transcriptional activities of Watson and Crick strands are shown above and below the ORF map, respectively.A reduction in transcriptional activity was observed in several loci in the Δhns mutant, especially for malEFG and malK-lamB-malM (Supplementary Figure S2). This may result from a reduction in local superhelicity in the Δhns mutant, as proposed by Hardy and Cozzarelli.14 Consistent with this finding, the malEFG and malK-lamB-malM loci are flanked by H-NS bound sequences (Supplementary Figure S2), and supercoiling is essential for the formation and stability of the initiation complex at the divergent malE and malK promoters.363.3. Genome-wide ChIP-chip analysis of RNA polymerase associated regionsA positive role for RNA polymerase in H-NS associated transcription repression has been demonstrated for the rrnB P1 and hdeAB promoters.6,9,11 To examine the degree of association between RNA polymerase and H-NS binding, we performed ChIP-chip analysis to map RNA polymerase binding sites, using monoclonal antibodies against the β and σD subunits (Supplementary Figure S1). In about 90 highly transcribed regions, the β subunit gave broad peaks throughout the operon, while the σD subunit gave a peak at the promoter region (Fig. 3A). It is likely that these signals correspond to the closed or stable open complexes at the promoters (σD signal) and elongation complexes in coding sequences (β signal). In addition to signals in highly expressed regions, we detected signal spikes for the β and σD subunits at the 5′ end of non-expressed or weakly expressed genes or operons (Fig. 3B and C). Furthermore, we found that such RNA polymerase signals overlapped with the H-NS peaks in >65% of the H-NS binding sites (Supplementary Table S1). The association of RNA polymerase and H-NS binding signals is especially evident in clustered H-NS binding sites (Fig. 5A). Scatter plots (Fig. 5B and C) demonstrate the partial, but significant, association of RNA polymerase and H-NS along the genome. These results strongly suggest that the trapping of RNA polymerase in an inactive form, with respect to initiation or elongation of transcription, is a genome-wide phenomenon. The signals observed for the β and σD RNA polymerase subunits were essentially at the same loci in both wild type and Δhns mutant cells (Supplementary Figure S3). These results suggest that the binding of RNA polymerase promotes the formation of higher order structure of the H-NS–DNA complex in vivo, as is observed in vitro.9,11Overlapping of H-NS and RNA polymerase biding sites. As a typical example, the H-NS, β and σD binding signals and their merged image (overlapped) at the gadB locus are shown in panel (A). The H-NS binding signal is shown by the red bar in the merged image. The genome-wide correlation between the H-NS and β binding signals (B) and the H-NS and σD binding signals (C) for each 25mer probe on the chip are also indicated.Overlapping of H-NS and RNA polymerase biding sites.

Correlation between H-NS binding sites and horizontally acquired DNAA positive correlation appears to exist between horizontally acquired genetic elements and the presence of nucleoid-associated proteins.3 A comparative genome hybridization analysis revealed the presence of highly divergent loci in the E. coli genome.37 Fukiya et al.37 demonstrated that many of the fimbria-related gene clusters in the E. coli strain W3110 are absent in a number of other E. coli and Shigella strains, suggesting that they have been acquired or deleted in a limited lineage. In this study we found these divergent loci to be silenced by H-NS (Supplementary Figure S1). In addition, 11 prophage and prophage-like sequences were partly or completely covered by bound H-NS, with the exception of one sequence (Supplementary Figure S1). These observations highlight the need for a comprehensive examination of the relationship between H-NS binding sites and horizontally acquired DNA.On the basis of codon usage profiles, Lawrence and Ochman38 proposed that 706 genes have been horizontally transferred into the E. coli genome after divergence from the Salmonella lineage. Similarly, through a comprehensive comparison of bacterial genome sequences, Nakamura et al.39 suggested that E. coli has horizontally acquired 1038 genes. A comparison of probable horizontally acquired genes and H-NS associated genes listed in Supplementary Table S1 shows that among 1047 genes found to be associated with H-NS, 644 (62%) were proposed to be horizontally acquired by Lawrence and Ochman38 and/or Nakamura et al.39 (Supplementary Table S2 and Figure S4). Furthermore, among the 403 remaining H-NS bound genes, 333 are contiguous to horizontally transferred genes bound by H-NS. These results strongly suggest that H-NS binds preferentially to horizontally acquired sequences. In the studies by Lawrence and Ochman38 and Nakamura et al.39, 70% and 54%, respectively, of predicted foreign genes are bound by H-NS. Fig. 6 shows a factorial correspondence analysis of codon usage of H-NS bound genes and predicted horizontally transferred genes, compared with genes of the entire E. coli genome, and clearly demonstrates the preferential binding of H-NS to horizontally acquired genes.Factorial correspondence analysis of codon usage of H-NS bound and horizontally acquired genes.

DiscussionThe genome-wide distribution of H-NS, RNA polymerase and transcriptionally active genes in exponentially growing E. coli cells was assessed using a custom-designed tiling chip. The results clearly demonstrate that H-NS specifically binds to about 250 loci in the E. coli genome, covering >1000 genes in total, to maintain the genes in a transcriptionally inactive state. The H-NS binding sites contain intrinsically curved A-tract sequences, reported to be preferentially bound by H-NS.5 In clustered H-NS binding regions, the H-NS binding signals extend from highly curved A-tract regions to flanking sequences, suggesting a two-step binding model for H-NS binding5 that involves nucleation at a high-affinity sequence followed by expansion into the flanking region.The distribution of RNA polymerase in the E. coli genome has been investigated by two independent groups using the ChIP-chip method employing the β subunit antibody. Grainger et al.19 reported that RNA polymerase associates predominantly with about 90 highly expressed transcriptional units in cells rapidly growing in LB medium. In addition, using rifampicin to trap RNA polymerase at functional promoters, they demonstrated that RNA polymerase associates with >500 functional promoters. In similar experiments in which rifampicin was added to cells growing in M9 minimal medium, Herring et al.20 identified about 1100 RNA polymerase binding sites. In this report, we performed ChIP-chip analysis of RNA polymerase binding sites in cells rapidly growing in LB medium, using antibodies against the β and σD subunits, and compared the distribution of RNA polymerase binding sites with the distribution of transcriptionally active genes and bound H-NS. Consistent with the finding of Grainger et al.,19 strong signals for RNA polymerase were detected upstream of highly transcribed genes. A preliminary analysis of transcription start sites and transcription units from mapping data, and RNA polymerase distribution data, revealed a strong correlation with known transcription initiation sites and operon structures listed in the RegulonDB database40 (see our web site Author Webpage). A detailed analysis, including a comparison of promoters mapped by Grainger et al.19 and Herring et al.20, is in progress and will be published elsewhere.Signals for both the β and σD subunits of RNA polymerase were also detected at the 5′ end of non-expressed or weakly expressed genes or operons, and were associated with the binding of H-NS. Consistent with our results, Grainger et al.41 also reported a strong correlation between the distribution of bound H-NS and RNA polymerase. Together, these results suggest that the trapping of RNA polymerase in an inactive form, which thereby prevents the initiation or elongation of transcription, provides a general mode of transcription repression by H-NS. Shin et al.11 proposed that weak DNA-binding proteins such as H-NS, with a binding constant in the micromolar range, would not have the capacity to bend short stretches of the DNA helix to create loops and thus require association with the σD subunit of RNA polymerase. Such a higher order H-NS-RNA polymerase–DNA complex would be formed throughout the genome.A close relationship between H-NS and horizontally acquired genes was identified in this study. The role of horizontally acquired genes in the evolution of bacterial genomes remains unknown and the mechanisms underlying the regulation of expression, and the mode of integration of these genes into the regulatory network of the host cell, is not understood. The unregulated expression of horizontally acquired genes would be disadvantageous to the growth of the host cell and result in elimination of the population harboring the newly acquired genes or the deletion of deleterious sequences from the genome. The nucleoid-associated protein has been suggested as a candidate cellular regulator to control incoming genetic elements.3 Our findings strongly suggest that the main role of H-NS is to maintain horizontally acquired genes in a transcriptionally inactive state under conditions leading to inappropriate expression. H-NS dependent repression would play an important role in the stable transmission of horizontally acquired genetic elements and, as a result, lead to the diversification and adaptation of E. coli genome to diverse growth conditions. During the preparation of this report, an independent report on the selective silencing of foreign DNA with low GC content by H-NS in Salmonella proposed that H-NS provides a bacterial defense against foreign DNA, enabling the acquisition of DNA from exogenous sources while avoiding detrimental consequences from the unregulated expression of newly acquired genes.22About half of the genes suggested by Lawrence and Ochman38 and/or Nakamura et al.39 to be horizontally acquired are not bound by H-NS. Although horizontally acquired genes with low GC content are reported to be selectively silenced by H-NS in Salmonella,22 we found no obvious difference in GC content or density of A-tracts between H-NS bound and unbound foreign genes in E. coli (data not shown). Parts of these genes are contiguous with H-NS bound sequences and probably silenced by H-NS indirectly (see Fig. 3B). It is of interest to note that although most fimbria-related gene clusters are bound by H-NS, three clusters conserved between all E. coli and Shigella strains examined37 are not bound by H-NS. This finding suggests that H-NS binds to recently acquired genes. It is possible that horizontally acquired genes not bound to H-NS are controlled by other nucleoid-associated proteins or have integrated into a specific regulatory pathway of the host. A detailed comparison of H-NS distribution between E. coli and Salmonella will provide further insight into the role of H-NS in genome evolution.In summary, our genome-wide approach using ChIP-chip analysis not only provided a comprehensive assessment of the genomic distribution of bound H-NS and modes of transcriptional regulation, but also revealed an avenue for furthering the understanding of the structure, function and evolution of the bacterial nucleoid.We thank Katsuhiko Shirahige, Takehiko Itho, Tetsuya Hayashi, Tohru Tobe, David Grainger and Steve Busby, for helpful discussions.

IntroductionRapidly accumulating large-scale data produced from high-throughput analyses of the genome and transcriptome have recently revealed that the use of alternative promoters is prevalent in human genes.1–4 The alternative use of promoters consisting of different modules of transcriptional regulatory elements enables diversified transcriptional regulation within a single locus.5 It is speculated that multi-faceted use of genes may serve as a molecular basis for the complexity of highly elaborated systems in humans, such as the immune system and nervous system, despite the limited number of total genes.6,7 However, in spite of the growing interest in alternative promoters, very little is known about how and on what occasions those promoters are differentially regulated.We have been analyzing the transcription start sites of mRNAs in humans by collective analyses of cDNAs that were isolated from full-length-enriched cDNA libraries constructed by our cap-targeted method, oligo-capping.8–10 By analyzing 1.8 million oligo-cap cDNAs, we recently demonstrated that about half of human protein-coding genes [defined as RefSeq genes (Author Webpage)] have at least two distinct putative alternative promoters (PAPs) which are separated by >500 bp. On average, there were 3.1 alternative promoters per gene. In 17% of cases, tissue-biased utilization of the alternative promoters was observed. The richest tissue sources of such tissue-biased alternative promoters were testis and brain.1Interestingly, the identified alternative promoters generally consisted of a combination of one promoter which was located in a CpG island (CGI-containing promoter)11 and other promoter(s) which were not associated with CpG islands (CGI-less promoters). Although about 70% of genes were found to possess at least one CGI-containing promoter, it was rare that a particular gene had more than a single CGI-containing promoter among its alternative promoters. Even when the total number of promoters increased, the number of CGI-containing promoters did not increase proportionally.1 This biased distribution with regard to the presence of CpG islands led us to hypothesize that the transcriptional regulation mediated by DNA methylation might play some role(s) in the differential regulation of the alternative promoters, since the generation and maintenance of the CpG islands have been shown to be closely associated with the methylation of DNAs.DNA methylation consists of the addition of a methyl group to the cytosine of the dinucleotide CpG by DNA methyltransferase enzymes in mammals.11 Such methylation generally represses the gene expression of the downstream gene, either by direct interference with the interaction between transcription factors and their binding sites or by altering the chromatin structure of the surrounding genomic region. The regulation of DNA methylation and demethylation is thought to be crucially important during development, and many studies have shown that disruption of proper DNA methylation has profound effects on carcinogenesis.12,13 DNA methylation is thought to be one of the major causative factors for the generation of CpG islands. Methylated cytosine can be converted to thymine by deamination, and thus, in the absence of selection pressure, CpG dinucleotides are rapidly erased from genomic sequences. Actually, CpG dinucleotides are markedly underrepresented throughout the human genome. This reduction of CpG does not occur in genome regions that are devoid of methylation. Rather, CpG dinucleotides are clustered as CpG ‘islands’, which are known to be especially abundant around promoter regions, and are thought to play an important role in proper transcriptional regulation.14–16In this study, in order to clarify how the differential regulation of alternative promoters is realized under various cellular circumstances, we analyzed the DNA methylation status of alternative promoters and compared the findings with the tissue-usage-bias of the promoters. Among our collection of alternative promoters, we selected genes with alternative promoters whose usage was biased between tissues, since differential promoter usage was most marked in this population. We characterized the DNA methylation status of the genomic regions proximal to the transcriptional start sites (−1 kb to +200 bp; transcriptional start site: 0) for 181 alternative promoters in 61 genes in five normal tissues in total. Here we describe our first study of the tissue-profile of DNA methylation in a wide variety of normal tissues.2. Materials and methods2.1. Primer designPCR primers were designed using Primer3 (Author Webpage). For primers for HpaII-McrBC PCRs, the parameters were set as: primer length: 20–25 bp; melting temperature: 50–60°C; target length: 1 kb; and for primers for bisulfite genomic sequencing, the parameters were set as: 20–30 bp; melting temperature: 50–70°C; target length: 300–600 bp. The RT–PCR primers were localized inside of the first exons that were unique to the respective alternative promoters using the following parameters: primer length: 20–25 bp; melting temperature: 50–60°C; target length: 50–200 bp. The sequence of each of the designed primers is shown in Supplementary Table S1. Also note that, since in almost all cases, each of the alternative promoters contained multiple transcriptional start sites, the sites used to excise the upstream putative promoters were the sites where the largest number of the 5′-ends of the oligo-cap cDNAs were mapped. The human genome information was in accord with UCSC hg17 (Author Webpage) except for the locations of CpG islands (see below).2.2. HpaII-McrBC PCR assayNormal human genomic DNAs were obtained from BioChain (BioChain; USA). Each genomic DNA sample was incubated in 1 M NaCl solution overnight at 37°C. The genomic DNAs were purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation and dissolved in distilled water. Aliquots (5–15 μg) were digested with 60 U of HapII (Takara; Japan), MspI (Takara; Japan) or McrBC (New England Biolabs; USA) overnight at 37°C in 100 μl of reaction mixture following the instructions of the manufacturer. To assure complete digestion, the digestion step was repeated once more. Control samples were treated in the same way without the addition of the restriction enzyme. After incubation, digested samples were purified by phenol–chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation and dissolved in distilled water.For each digestion, the amount of undigested DNA was measured by Quantitative (Real Time) PCR using 7900HT (ABI; USA). For PCR, 1.0 μl (20–50 ng) of digested genomic DNA was used in a 20 μl reaction solution containing: 10 μl of SYBR GREEN PCR Master mix (ABI; USA): 0.125 pmol of each primer: 4 μl of distilled water. The PCR conditions were 50°C for 2 min, 95°C for 10 min, 5 cycles of: 95°C for 30 s, 58°C for 30 s, 60°C for 1 min, 5 cycles of: 95°C for 30 s, 56°C for 30 s, 60°C for 1 min, 30 cycles of: 95°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s, 60°C for 1 min, and 60°C for 5 min. The integrity of the PCR products (lack of primer-dimers or non-specific amplicons) was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The integrity was also assured by measuring the monomial of the dissociation curve of the PCR products using Dissociation Curve Analysis in SDS Analytic Tools (ABI; USA).2.3. Bisulfite genomic sequencingFive micrograms of the normal human genomic DNAs (BioChain; USA) were treated in a 600 μl sodium bisulfite reaction solution containing: 10 mM hydroquinone, 8 M urea and 3.6 M bisulfite (Sigma; USA) at pH 5.0 (pH adjustment with 10 M NaOH) at 55°C overnight, according to the standard procedure.17,18 Fifty nanograms of the bisulfite-treated DNA was used for PCR amplification in a 10 μl reaction mixture containing: 10 nM Tris–HCl at pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, each dNTP at 0.25 mM, each primer at 0.25 μM and 2.5 U of Ex-Taq DNA polymerase (TaKaRa; Japan). The PCR conditions were: 95°C for 3 min, 5 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s, 72°C for 1 min, 5 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 52°C for 30 s, 72°C for 1 min, 35 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 50°C for 30 s, 72°C for 1 min and a final incubation at 72°C for 5 min. The amplified PCR products were purified using the Wizard DNA Clean-up system (Promega; USA) and were TA-cloned into pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen; USA). Ten individual clones were sequenced from both ends using a 3730 ABI sequencer according to the standard protocol (ABI; USA).2.4. Data processing(A) Statistics of the target promoters: Number of PAPs classified by the tissue sources of their tissue-biases (upper line) and the number of genes containing the PAPs with the indicated tissue-biases (lower line), (B) Frequency of the CGI-containing PAPs among each population.Note that some of the genes contained more than two TB-PAPs, and thus the total number of genes did not correspond to the sum of the numbers counted separately.(A) Statistics of the target promoters: Number of PAPs classified by the tissue sources of their tissue-biases (upper line) and the number of genes containing the PAPs with the indicated tissue-biases (lower line), (B) Frequency of the CGI-containing PAPs among each population.Note that some of the genes contained more than two TB-PAPs, and thus the total number of genes did not correspond to the sum of the numbers counted separately.CpG islands were defined as a genomic region that was 200 bp or greater in length with a C+G content >50% and a CpG percentage that exceeded by 60% that expected in random sequences.11As for the difference in DNA methylation status between tissues or between PAPs belonging to the same genes, ‘Changed’ was defined as meaning that there were at least two different statuses of DNA methylation in the group. ‘Not Changed’ was defined as meaning that there was only one status of DNA methylation in the group. For defining ‘Not Changed’, we required that the data from at least two PAPs were not ‘n.d.’ for analyzing mutual differences between PAPs, and we required at least three PAPs for analyzing tissue profiles.2.5. Semi-quantitative (real-time) RT–PCR assays3. Results3.1. Selection of alternative promotersIn our previous study, we generated a collection of 30 707 PAPs in 7674 RefSeq genes.1 Among them, we identified 1731 PAPs in 1287 genes which showed biased usage between tissues or cell types [tissue-biased PAPs (TB-PAPs); P < 0.01; statistical significance was evaluated by calculating hyper-geometric distributions using the formula shown in Materials and Methods]. We further selected the genes that had at least two TB-PAPs containing restriction enzyme sites essential for the HpaII-McrBC PCR assays in the region from −1 kb to +200 bp of the transcription start sites. As a result, we obtained 61 genes that had 144 PAPs. Also, we selected an additional 37 PAPs belonging to the same genes but showing no tissue bias (non-TB-PAPs). Thus, we selected a total of 181 PAPs in 61 genes as targets for methylation analysis (Table 1). For a schematic representation of the selection flow chart, see Supplementary Figure S1. For detailed information abouteach of the promoters, see Supplementary Table S2. Also, the numbering of the PAPs corresponds to that used in our database, DBTSS (Author Webpage), so that visual inspection can be performed for each of the PAPs.Although we selected only 144 (about 8%) TB-PAPs of 1731 for the following assays, we think that this promoter set retains the overall character of TB-PAPs. As described in our previous report, testis and brain were the richest source of the tissue-biased alternative promoters. This was also true for the present set (Table 1). Also, among the total set of 181 promoters, 59 (33%) contained CpG-islands and 122 (67%) were CpG-island-less (Table 1). This frequency was similar to that of the total 30 707 PAPs (CpG-island-containing: 34%, see Ref.1). We therefore consider the features of the current set of promoters to be representative of the overall features of alternative promoters at least in these respects.3.2. Measurement of the DNA methylation status of promoters in five normal tissuesWe examined the DNA methylation status using HpaII-McrBC PCR assays (HM-PCR assays). For each PAP, the DNA methylation status in five normal tissues, namely, brain, testis, spleen, stomach and liver, was determined. According to the observed PCR band patterns, we classified the DNA methylation status into four groups: ‘complete’, ‘composite’, ‘null’ and ‘incomplete’ methylation (abbreviated CL, CP, NL and IC respectively), which are classification categories often employed in previous studies (Fig. 1A; and see Ref. 19). Typical examples of PCR band patterns assigned to each of the groups are shown in Fig. 1B.HpaII-McrBC PCR of the putative ‘tissue-biased’ alternative promoters (TB-PAPs).

(C) Typical examples of the results of the bisulfite genomic sequencing assays. TSS: transcriptional start site.We observed 138 (24%) ‘complete’, 264 (45%) ‘null’, 165 (28%) ‘composite’, and 16 (3%) ‘incomplete’ methylations among the 144 TB-PAPs (Table 2). For these 583 cases, the classification was entirely straightforward based on the PCR band patterns (the presence or absence of the PCR bands; see Fig. 1B and the legend). Moreover, we used real-time PCR for the quantification of the band amplification. Thus, we could assess the extent of the presence or absence of the bands in a quantitative manner (for the quantitative data, see Supplementary Figure S2). In 137 (15% of a total of 905) cases, the band patterns were ambiguous (or a mixture) between the two categories, and thus they were classified as ‘not determined (n.d.)’. (For further discussion of this issue, see Supplementary Figure S4). For the 37 non-TB-PAPs, we classified 37 (24%), 64 (42%), 47 (31%), 5 (3%) and 32 (18% of total 181) promoters as ‘complete’, ‘null’, ‘composite’, ‘incomplete’ and ‘n.d.’, respectively (Table 2). It was interesting that ‘composite’, which is the category in which one of the two alleles is completely methylated and the other is null methylated, was observed far more frequently than ‘incomplete’, which is the category in which both alleles are partially methylated. This suggests that the gene expression statuses from two alleles might differ for a significant population of genes, although it is also possible that the presence of mixed populations of multiple cell types within the used tissues accounted for this observation (Note that the ‘composite’ pattern can raise from cell-type difference, not from allelic difference. If both alleles are completely methylated in certain cell types but completely unmethylated in other cell types in the same tissue, this can give a composite pattern. For extensive analysis regarding this issue, see Supplementary Figure S5). This general tendency was also observed for both tissue-biased and non-tissue-biased PAPs. Altogether, we obtained data explicitly representing the DNA methylation status of 736 proximal promoters. This dataset is the largest so far collected for the DNA methylation status at promoters in normal tissues.DNA methylation status of the TB-PAPs.The numbers of PAPs whose DNA methylation status was categorized as the corresponding patterns in the indicated tissue are shown.

Frequencies of the observed patterns were calculated relative to the subtotal, which excluded “n.d.”, and are shown in parentheses.We further confirmed the results obtained from the HM-PCR assays by bisulfite genomic sequencing assays. Since the bisulfite genomic sequencing assays could not be scaled up to high-throughput assays, we selected 5, 4, 15, 11 cases as representative cases randomly selected from the cases categorized as ‘complete’, ‘composite’, ‘null’ and ‘incomplete’, respectively, by HM-PCR assays (Fig. 1A; results from 35 PAPs are presented in Supplementary Table S3). In all cases, the classifications obtained from the two assays were consistent with each other. This strong agreement between the two assays provides support for our conclusion real-time PCR was useful for quantitatively discriminating distinct DNA methylation patterns in the HM-PCR assay.3.3. Variable methylation patterns between alternative promoters and between tissuesAt first glance, we were surprised by the variable pattern of DNA methylation at the alternative promoters. Fig. 2 illustrates the case of the SEPT9 gene as an extreme example. The SEPT9 gene was identified as a causative gene of an autosomal dominant hereditary disease, neuralgic amyotrophy, and is thought to play roles in cell proliferation.20 This gene possessed at least 20 alternative promoters, represented by an array of 20 mutually exclusive first exon variants (Fig. 2A). Of these, the DNA methylation status was determined for 14 in this study (Fig. 2B). A surprising aspect of the data is that no two PAPs in Fig. 2B share the same methylation pattern variation among the five tissues. For example, PAP-ID1 and 2 are separated by only 800 bases. Yet, ID1 showed the CP-CP-CL-CP-NL pattern, while ID2 showed the NL-NL-NL-NL-NL pattern. PAP-ID10 showed the CP-CL-CL-CP-CP pattern, which was similar to the pattern of PAP-ID11, namely, CP-CL-CP-CP-CP. However, these two promoters are separated by 4 kb. These observations suggest that the DNA methylation pattern may be unique for each PAP even within the same gene. This could allow very fine tuning of the gene expression. Only PAP-ID5 and PAP-ID13 showed a uniform ‘composite’ methylation pattern among the five tissues (although surprisingly, PAP-ID5 and PAP-ID13 are separated by 100 kb). PAP-ID2 also showed a uniform ‘null’ methylation pattern. For the remaining 11 PAPs (79% of the 14 PAPs), the methylation pattern clearly varied among the five tissues. Thus, variable methylation patterns among the tissues may be more common than a uniform pattern.DNA Methylation Status at the PAPs of the SEPT9 gene.

In the 2nd column CGI-containing PAPs are represented as 1, and CGI-less PAPs as 0. In the 3rd column, tissue-preferences of the PAPs are shown.In order to obtain a more generalized picture, we compared the methylation patterns between PAPs belonging to the same gene. Although we assayed 181 PAPs for 61 genes, there was about 20% ‘n.d.’ data. Thus, there were 48 genes for which we had data for at least three tissues at two PAPs per gene. Only five of these 48 genes showed a perfect match of PAP methylation patterns in all five tissues (Table 3). Thus, what we observed for SEPT9 was true for all the genes we analyzed. It is noteworthy that the methylation pattern was uniformly ‘null’ for the matched PAPs. There were 10 PAPs for five genes that showed a perfect match. They were ‘null’ methylated in all five tissues (Table 3). The number of genes with a perfect match would only be seven even if a mismatch in one tissue were allowed. There were two additional genes possessing five PAPs that had one mismatch (Table 3). Two of them showed a ‘composite’ pattern in liver, while the rest were all ‘null’ in the other tissues (Table 3).Changes in the DNA methylation status between PAPs and between tissues, the numbers of TB-PAPs and non-TB-PAPs whose DNA methylation status was Changed (upper line) or Not-Changed (lower line) between tissuesChanges in the DNA methylation status between PAPs and between tissues, the numbers of TB-PAPs and non-TB-PAPs whose DNA methylation status was Changed (upper line) or Not-Changed (lower line) between tissuesIndeed, the DNA methylation status of the individual PAPs differed greatly depending on the tissue. As shown in Table 3, the DNA methylation status of 93 of 154 (60%) PAPs varied among the five tissues. This confirms that variable methylation patterns among the tissues may be more common than a uniform pattern. We also noted that the TB-PAPs seemed to have more highly variable methylation statuses than non-TB-PAPs. TB-PAPs had variable methylation patterns in 77 of 124 cases (62%), while only 16 of 30 (53%) non-TB-PAPs had such patterns, indicating slightly greater variability in the former, although the statistical significance was not very high (P < 0.14; evaluated by calculating hyper-geometric distributions following the equation shown in Materials and Methods), possibly due to the limited size of the current dataset.3.4. Relationship between tissue-bias and DNA methylation status of alternative promotersWe further examined the relationship between the tissue-preferential usage of the individual PAPs and the tissue-profiles of their DNA methylation status. We compared the DNA methylation status of the TB-PAPs between their ‘preferred’ tissues and other tissues. We focused this analysis on the testis-preferring PAPs and brain-preferring PAPs, as the largest number of TB-PAPs was obtained from these tissues (also see Table 1). We found that the DNA methylation status at the ‘testis-preferring’ PAPs was considerably biased to ‘null’, and ‘complete’ was extremely rare (P < 0.003; evaluated by calculating hyper-geometric distributions of ‘null’ and ‘composite’ against their frequencies in the total population; Table 4). Such bias toward the ‘null’ state was not seen in other tissues for testis-preferring PAPs or for non-TB-PAPs in the testis. These observations suggest that unique regulation may be exerted for TB-PAPs in the testis. We observed no such bias for the other PAPs of the genes that had testis-preferring PAPs with ‘null’ methylation in the testis (Table 4).Relation between the Tissue Preference and the DNA Methylation Status of the PAPs (A) Numbers of observed DNA methylation patterns in testis-preferring PAPs in testis (1st column) and in other tissues (2nd column), those in brain-preferring PAPs in brain (3rd column) and in other tissues (4th column) and those in other-tissue-preferring PAPs in testis (5th column) and in brain (6th column) (B) Number of observed DNA methylation patterns in the PAPs whose accompanying PAPs were testis-preferring and “null” methylated in testis (population marked with an asterisk in Table 4).

(C) Number of observed DNA methylation patterns in the PAPs whose accompanying PAPs were brain-preferring and “compositely” methylated in brain (population marked with double asterisks in Table 4).When the same analysis was performed for brain-preferring PAPs, we did not see any bias toward ‘null’. However, interestingly, in brain, the DNA methylation patterns in accompanying PAPs of the same gene were skewed. As shown in Table 4, even when the brain-preferring PAPs were ‘compositely’ methylated, their counterpart PAPs rarely had ‘null’ status. Although further extensive data collection will be necessary, these observations indicate that there may be several distinct methylation mechanisms for tissue-biased gene expression depending on the tissue type. Nevertheless, it seemed that actively used PAPs are generally less extensively methylated than their accompanying PAPs.3.5. Relationship between DNA methylation status and mRNA expression levelIn order to examine the relationship between the DNA methylation status and the level of mRNA expression, we measured the relative amount of mRNAs transcribed from each of the alternative promoters in the five tissues. For this purpose, we used real-time RT–PCR assays. Based on our full-length cDNA information, RT–PCR primers were designed at unique regions inside of the first exons of the transcript variants corresponding to each of the PAPs which showed different DNA methylation statuses between tissues. Ninety-three such primer pairs were considered, and in 49 cases, positive signals from either of the tissues were observed. (For an example, see Fig. 3A.) Fig. 3B shows the distribution of the relative expression level calculated separately for each of the DNA methylation patterns. Although the difference in the distributions of the relative expression levels between ‘null’ and ‘composite’ populations was not highly statistically significant as a whole, we still observed that ‘null’ or relatively light methylation patterns of PAPs were enriched (P < 0.02; hyper-geometric distributions calculated similarly as in Section 3.4.) in the tissues in which the mRNA expression was the strongest (relative expression level ≥8; also see Fig. 3A, Supplementary Table S2). We also observed that ‘complete’ DNA methylation was the only pattern in which the mRNA expression was the weakest (relative expression level ≤1/8). It is highly possible that the changes in the DNA methylation status are responsible for the modulations of the gene expression in these cases.Methylation Pattern and mRNA Expression in the Five Tissues.

The Ct values (constant of threshold; as of the default setting of ABI7900HT) and the relative expression levels are shown in the margin.

Relationship between DNA methylation status and the presence of CpG islandsWe further attempted to clarify the relationship between the DNA methylation status and the presence of CpG islands. We compared the DNA methylation status between the populations of CGI-containing PAPs and CGI-less PAPs and found a striking difference. In contrast to the so-far observed variable methylation patterns, we found that the CGI-containing PAPs were predominantly ‘null’ methylated throughout the five tissues (P < 1.0E−55; evaluated by standard Fisher's test; Table 5). Consequently, the DNA methylation status was unchanged throughout the tissues, remaining constantly ‘null’. These tendencies held irrespective of whether the PAPs were TB-PAPs or non-TB-PAPs (P < 30E−9; evaluated by standard Fisher's test; Table 5). In contrast, the DNA methylation in CGI-less PAPs was highly variable among tissues. When the CGI-containing PAPs were ‘null’ methylated, the pattern of the DNA methylation of the other PAPs of the same gene, which were usually CGI-less, was similar to the overall distribution patterns.Changes in the DNA Methylation Status between CGI-containing and CGI-less Promoters (A) Numbers of observed patterns of DNA methylation status in CGI-containing PAPs and CGI-less PAPs are shown.

DiscussionIn this study, we characterized the DNA methylation status at 181 PAPs in 61 genes which were identified by our previous full-length cDNA analyses. This is the first report describing the profiles of the DNA methylation of PAPs in a variety of tissues and may be the largest collection of data on the methylation of human promoters in general for normal tissues. In total, we analyzed the methylation status of 8612 CpG dinucleotides in 181 PAPs located in the proximal regions of transcriptional start sites (also see Supplementary Table S2). Although this number is small relative to the total number of CpG dinucleotides existing within the whole genome, this novel analysis of these CpG islands should be significant, because they may have direct biological consequences via modulating the transcription levels of genes.Many of the previous studies using DNA-chip-based technologies were focused on comparing the DNA methylation status between cancerous cells and normal cells.21,22 From the data we collected here, we found: (i) PAPs of the same gene tend to have different methylation pattern variation depending on the tissue; (ii) DNA methylation status differs among tissues for the majority of the individual PAPs; (iii) CGI-containing PAPs are an exception to observation, (ii) in that they tend to have a uniform ‘null’ pattern throughout the tissues examined.The last result is somewhat of a confirmation of the findings of our previous study, although it was not previously tested on this scale. We made a comprehensive analysis of CpG islands on human chromosome 21 and observed that 84% of CpG islands located within promoter regions were ‘null’ methylated in leukocytes.19 The general lack of methylation of promoter CpG islands, regardless of whether the corresponding genes are expressed or not, was also suggested by other previous studies, although the numbers of the assayed promoters and cell types were limited.23 In this study, we assayed 181 PAPs in five normal tissues and observed that most of the CGI-containing PAPs were constantly ‘null’ methylated irrespective of the tissue (Table 5). Based on this observation, we concluded that methylation appears not to be the reason for the biased expression of most of the CGI-containing TB-PAPs.In contrast to the case of the CGI-containing TB-PAPs, we found surprisingly wide variation in the methylation pattern among the tissues examined. We observed that the majority of TB-PAPs showed alteration of their DNA methylation status among tissues (62%; Table 5). If we counted only CGI-less TB-PAPs, the proportion went up to 80% (Table 5). We also found that TB-PAPs seemed to have more variation of their methylation patterns than non-TB-PAPs (Table 3). We examined only five tissues in this study. We expect that the proportion of PAPs that show a variable methylation pattern among the tissues may increase if the number of tissues assayed is increased. Since we assayed 181 PAPs that were located on various chromosomes, these results indicate that various regions in the human genome are differentially methylated among various tissues. This suggests that the methylation of promoters is more dynamically regulated from one tissue to another than previously anticipated.Among 48 genes for which we compared PAPs within the same gene, only about 10% had the same methylation pattern in all five tissues. All of these methylation patterns were ‘null’, as described in Table 3. Actually, CGI-containing PAPs accounted for these uniform ‘null’ patterns. Seven PAPs contained CpG-islands out of 10 PAPs of 5 genes that showed perfect matches of the methylation patterns (Table 3). We could not find any simple correlation of methylation pattern variation between PAPs within the same gene. The methylation of PAPs thus seems to be individually controlled even within the same gene.We also searched for specific patterns of methylation according to the expression pattern or expression level of the mRNA transcribed from a PAP. We observed that high levels expression correlated with the ‘null’ or relatively light methylation pattern of PAPs, although the statistical significance was not as clear as in the above cases, possibly due to the limited size of the current dataset. There seems to be a tendency for CGI-containing PAPs to be ‘null’ methylated and to show high expression levels. Our previous findings suggested that most genes have only one CGI-containing PAP among all their PAPs.1 It is possible that this unique CGI-containing PAP is the major promoter of the gene, playing a key role among the group of alternative promoters.Together, in this study, we showed that information about DNA methylation is as indispensable as the mere DNA sequences of the promoters for a thorough understanding of the regulation of the expression of the genes encoded by the human genome. Modifications of the histones, methylation of the DNA, and the chromatin structure are suggested to be related with each other.24 Thus, information about DNA methylation may in general be useful as an indicator of the chromatin structure. Advances in genome and transcriptome research have opened a way for decoding the gene expression regulation of the genomic DNA sequences. Actually, in yeast, a recent report demonstrated that it was possible to predict the level of gene expression directly from the genomic sequence with some accuracy, using clustered microarray data as an education dataset.25 The sequence information of the DNA together with its higher-level chromatin structure will enable us to better understand how the code of the DNA directs the complex regulation of gene expression in human cells. Based on that knowledge, we should eventually be able to understand how the alternative utilization of the promoters plays roles in the diversification of gene functions.We are grateful to K. Abe, K.

IntroductionRheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by arthritis that predominantly results in chronic inflammation of systemic joints associated with the overgrowth of synovial cells. This induces progressive cartilage and bone destruction in the joint and subsequent disability. Since RA pathogenesis is likely to involve genetic elements, a number of groups have subjected samples from healthy and affected individuals to DNA microarray analyses for a broad-scale comparison. These studies have provided significant insights into RA pathogenesis.1,2 The first samples tested were synovial specimens,3–8 and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC),9 from RA and osteoarthritis (OA) patients, and cluster analysis of the resulting microarray gene-expression data revealed some candidate genes that may play a specific role in RA pathogenesis.In other studies searching for key factors in RA pathogenesis, immunoscreening by using an antirheumatoid synovial cell antibody identified synoviolin/Hrd1 to be a highly expressed enzyme (E3 ubiquitin ligase) in the rheumatoid synovium.10 Synoviolin appears to be a pathogenic factor for RA because mice overexpressing this enzyme developed spontaneous arthropathy, while heterozygous knockdown results in increased synovial cell apoptosis and resistance to collagen-induced arthritis.11 It was proposed that the excess elimination of unfolded proteins due to synoviolin overexpression triggers synovial cell overgrowth.12 Thus, synoviolin may play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of arthropathy due to its functions in the quality control of proteins through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) system; its elevated expression may therefore have an anti-apoptotic effect that causes synovial hyperplasia.Bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (BMMC) are another target for analyses aiming to identify the key genes that participate in RA pathogenesis because accumulating evidence suggests that BMMC cell abnormalities may contribute to the pathogenesis of RA and experimental arthritis models.13–17 Moreover, RA patients suffer from defective central and peripheral B-cell tolerance checkpoints,18 the first of which occurs in the bone marrow between the early immature and immature B-cell stages (the second counter selection step of autoantibody-expressing B cells takes place in the periphery, when the new emigrant becomes a mature naive B cell).18,19 In addition, inflammatory changes similar to those found in RA synovium seem to occur in the subchondral bone marrow of the involved RA joint,20 and synovial inflammatory tissue can reach the adjacent bone marrow by fully breaking the cortical barrier.21 Thus, BMMC cells are an interesting subject for studies seeking to identify specific genes involved in RA pathogenesis.To identify the genes whose expressions are dramatically induced or reduced in the pooled BMMC mRNAs of 50 RA patients as compared with 50 OA patients, we here subjected these pooled mRNAs to stepwise subtraction, which is a unique technique that we have developed previously.22 This method permitted the comprehensive identification of those genes that are specifically up- or down-regulated during RA pathogenesis. In addition, we also used microarray analysis, since DNA microarray analyses on the BMMC of RA patients have not been described previously. As a control, we also subjected the BMMC RNA from OA patients to stepwise subtraction and microarray analysis to identify the genes that are specifically involved in OA pathogenesis. These analyses together resulted in the isolation of 103 RA-upregulated genes, of which amphiregulin (AREG) was revealed by quantitative real-time RT–PCR (QRT–PCR) to be the most conspicuously induced gene in RA patients. Interestingly, we also show here that AREG operates upstream of synoviolin in isolated synovial cells through an epidermal growth factor receptor (EFGR) signaling pathway. We discuss how AREG upregulation could contribute to RA pathogenesis.2. Patients, Materials and Methods2.1. Human subjects and ethical considerationsAll RA patients satisfied the 1987 revised diagnostic criteria of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR: formerly the American Rheumatism Association).23 All OA patients fulfilled the ACR criteria for hip or knee OA.24 The RA and OA patient groups were largely matched in terms of their average age and sex (Supplementary Figure S1A and B). This study was reviewed and approved by the Internal Review Board of the Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University. Accordingly, a written informed consent was obtained from each participant before obtaining human tissues.2.2. Cell proliferation assayThe synovial cells from each patient were seeded onto uncoated 35 mm tissue culture plates at 1 × 105 cells/well and cultured in 5% FBS/DMEM. After 12 h, the cells were incubated in fresh 5% FBS/DMEM with (100 ng/ml) or without AREG (Sigma-Aldrich, A 7080). Four photos were taken from fixed areas in four quadrants near the central area of each plate at the 0, 1, 3 and 4 day time points. The cells at each time point were counted from these four photos and expressed as mean ± standard error (SE).2.3. Statistical analysisSignificant differences were determined using the Spearman's rank correlation (Supplemenatry Figure S4) or the Mann–Whitney U-test (Figs 2, 4 and Supplementary Figure S3). The data are expressed as means ± SE. P < 0.05 or P < 0.01 was considered to be statistically significant.3. RESULTS3.1. Identification of RA- or OA-specific genes by stepwise subtraction and DNA microarray analysisTo isolate the putative RA-specific genes that are upregulated in BMMC of RA patients relative to those that are upregulated in OA patients, we first used our stepwise subtractive hybridization method. Briefly, we prepared a cDNA library from the pooled mRNA from the BMMC of 50 RA patients (Supplementary Figure S1A) by the linker-primer method using a pAP3neo vector.25 Stepwise subtractive hybridization was then performed with the biotinylated pooled mRNA from the BMMC of 50 OA patients (Supplementary Figure S1A) to select candidate genes that may show upregulation in RA BMMC only as described previously.22 To examine if the candidate genes are actually upregulated in RA but not OA BMMC, we performed northern blot analysis and/or RT–PCR using the pooled mRNA from the BMMC of 50 RA and 50 OA patients (Fig. 1). To reduce the possibility of missing important RA-specific pathogenic genes by this method, we also performed a genome-wide complementary DNA microarray analysis using the Agilent Hu44K array with the same pooled RNA samples obtained from the BMMC of RA and OA patients that were described above. When we tested top 70 genes from the microarray list of RA-upregulated genes by northern blot analysis and/or RT–PCR as described above, we found that only 20 genes really displayed RA-upregulated expressions. Thus, we identified 103 RA-upregulated genes (Fig. 1) and named them AURA (augmented in RA). As shown in Table 1, 15 AURA genes (AURA1∼AURA7 and AURA10∼AURA17) are uncharacterized novel genes.Northern blot or RT–PCR analysis of individual AURA cDNA clones to compare the expression levels of the genes in the BMMC of 50 RA patients and 50 OA patients (see Table 1 for their gene names).

The AURA genes that were subjected to QRT–PCR analysis are denoted by r.PRIC285: peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor A interacting complex 285.We also performed similar experiments to obtain candidate OA-upregulated genes by generating a cDNA library from the pooled mRNA from the BMMC of 50 OA patients (Supplementary Figure S1A) and then using biotinylated pooled mRNA from the BMMC of 50 RA patients for subtraction (Supplementary Figure S1A). DNA microarray analysis also yielded a number of candidate OA-specific genes, as described above. However, when we checked whether these candidate genes are truly specifically up-regulated in OA BMMCs by northern blot analysis and/or RT–PCR, we could confirm this for only two genes (Supplementary Figure S2). These two OA-upregulated genes encode nuclear receptor coactivator 1 and a hypothetical protein (FLJ20581). This result suggests that the gain of function due to the enhanced expression of the RA-upregulated candidate genes is important in the pathogenesis of RA. Thus, we subsequently concentrated our study on the RA-upregulated genes.3.2. Expression profiles of RA-upregulated genes in individual RA or OA patientsTo determine whether the upregulation of the 103 RA-specific candidate genes is widespread in many RA patients or occurs in only a few patients, we performed QRT–PCR using individually prepared RNA samples from the BMMC or PBMC of RA patients. Of the 103 candidate genes, 5 genes whose functions are unknown and 12 genes that may be related to growth regulation or immune response were analyzed by QRT–PCR. OA patients were also examined as negative controls. In every QRT–PCR, a standard RNA from the PBMC of a healthy volunteer (male, age 52) was used (denoted as normal with a relative intensity of 1.0). This allowed us to compare the expression profiles of the genes tested in this study. In addition, since we used this control, we could also compare the expression profiles of the genes in this study with those of other genes tested in our previous reports on other autoimmune diseases.26Of the 17 tested AURA genes (denoted x in Table 1), AREG (AURA9) was the most conspicuously upregulated in the BMMC of many of the RA patients, while in contrast OA BMMCs invariably expressed this gene at very low levels (Fig. 2A). Similarly, the PBMC of many RA patients strongly expressed AREG, while only very low expression was detected in the PBMC of the OA patients (Fig. 2A). AREG is one of the EGF-like growth factors that stimulate cell growth by activating the EGF receptor (EGFR) signaling of the target cells in an autocrine/juxtacrine fashion.27Expression levels of AURA genes in individual RA and OA patients. QRT–PCR analyses show that the mRNA levels of (A) AREG, (B) AURA1, (C) FKBP5, (D) CLECSF9, (E) TPST1 and (F) AURA2 are conspicuously upregulated in RA patient BMMC (and sometimes PBMC), while the BMMC and PBMC of OA patients show negligible upregulation. Expression levels in the BMMC for 50 RA patients (from #1 to 50) are arranged in the denoted order. The inset in (B) shows that the thioesterase domain occupies most of the Aura1 protein. The mean values of the samples analyzed in triplicate from each individual RA BMMC, RA PBMC, OA BMMC and OA PBMC are indicated by filled circles, open squares, x's, or filled triangles, respectively. The average values for the RA patient group are shown by the horizontal arrows. The bar graphs in the right panels show the average ± SE values of these measurements using the RA or OA BMMC or PBMC.

All measurements are statistically significant when RA and OA are compared (P < 0.01).AURA1 was the next most conspicuously upregulated gene in the BMMC of many RA patients, while the BMMC of all OA patients showed only very low expression of this gene (Fig. 2B). However, unlike AREG, the PBMC of RA patients showed negligible enhancement in the expression of AURA1. AURA1 encodes an uncharacterized protein containing a thioesterase domain (Fig. 2B inset) that may cleave thioester bonds of an unknown target.The gene encoding FK506 (tacrolimus)-binding protein 5 (FKBP5 = AURA45) also showed enhanced expression in nearly half of the RA patient BMMC samples, while no such increase was observed in the OA patient BMMC samples or in the PBMC of the RA patients (Fig. 2C). FKBP5 is a cellular receptor for FK506 and has an immunosuppressive effect on activated T cells because it inhibits the protein phosphatase calcineurin.28Nearly half of the RA patient BMMC samples showed 5- to 50-fold greater expression of CLECSF9 (=AURA24), TPST1 (=AURA52) and AURA2 than the normal control PBMC sample (Fig. 2D–F). No such increase was observed in the BMMC of OA patients or in the PBMC of the RA patients. CLECSF9 encodes a macrophage-inducible C-type lectin (Mincle) that harbors a calcium-dependent carbohydrate-recognition domain. TPST1 is one of the two Golgi tyrosylprotein sulfotransferases (TPST1 and TPST2) that mediate the post-translational modification tyrosine O-sulfation.G0S2 (=AURA8), chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4 = AURA86), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB = AURA25) and AURA17 showed augmented expression in both the BMMC and PBMC of some of the RA patients when compared to the expression in the BMMC and PBMC of the OA patients, although the differences between the RA and OA samples are not as significant as for the previously discussed genes (Supplementary Figure S3A–D). G0S2 is one of the G0/G1 switch (G0S) genes that are differentially expressed in lymphocytes during their lectin-induced switch from the G0 to the G1 phases of the cell cycle.29 CXCR4, the receptor for a chemokine called stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1/CXCL12), is important in the migration, homing and survival of hematopoietic stem cells. SDF-1, which is secreted by ischemic myocardium, is involved in the homeostatic and inflammatory traffic of leukocytes, and is highly expressed in the synovial tissues of RA patients.30 NF-κB is a transcription factor that resides in the cytoplasm of every cell and translocates to the nucleus when activated by a wide variety of agents, including cytokines.31AURA17 is an uncharacterized novel gene that encodes a large protein with 8 leucine rich repeats, Mitochondrial Rho (Miro) motif and protein tyrosine kinase domain (Supplementary Figure S3D inset).We also tested seven other genes in RA and OA BMMC and PBMC samples by QRT–PCR, but none showed a widespread and conspicuous increase in expression in the RA BMMC samples (data not shown). Consequently, these genes appear to play a less significant role in RA pathogenesis. Since these experiments and those described above consumed almost all BMMC and PBMC samples from the RA and OA patients, the remaining AURA genes will have to be tested in the future with another RA patient set.3.3. Expression pattern of AURA genes in PBMCTo determine whether the AURA genes are expressed in particular human blood cells, we performed RT–PCR on multiple tissue cDNA panels (MTC) from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). As shown in Fig. 3, RT–PCR detected AREG mRNA in both monocytes (lane 4) and T and B cells (lanes 2–4), in particular in activated CD4+ T cells (lane 8). AURA1 is detected predominantly in resting CD4+ (T helper/inducer; lane 3) and activated CD4+ T (lane 8) cells. CLECSF9 is expressed in most cell types except for activated CD19+ T cells (lane 6), while G0S2 is found primarily in monocytes (lanes a and 4). FKBP5, TPST1, CXCR4, AURA2 and NFκB are ubiquitously expressed in most cell types. Thus, the analysis of the functions these AURA genes, apart from AURA1 and G0S2, play in specific blood cells will not be easy because they are already expressed in normal blood. However, the function of AURA1 can be studied by using CD4+ T cells of RA and OA patients. In this study, however, we could not perform this analysis because of the low amounts of BMMC that we could obtain from the RA patients.Determination by RT–PCR of the human blood cells that express AREG, AURA1, FKBP5, CLECSF9, TPST1, AURA2, G0S2, CXCR4 and NFκB.

AREG stimulates the growth of synovial cellsSince AREG appears to be the most conspicuously unpregulated gene in many RA patients, we subjected it to further analysis. We first examined its ability to stimulate the growth of isolated synovial cells because AREG is one of the ligands of EGFR and is known to induce cell growth. Thus, we isolated synovial cells from synovial tissues that were obtained from five RA and three OA patients during joint reconstructive surgery. In the absence of AREG in the culture medium, the synovial cells from both the RA and OA patients grew at a similar rate (Fig. 4A and B). However, when AREG was present, the synovial cells from RA patients appeared to grow slightly faster than the synovial cells from OA patients, which is statistically significant (P < 0.05) (Fig. 4A).The effect of AREG on the proliferation of synoviocytes from RA and OA patients. The synovial cells from three RA patients (RA1, RA2 and RA3) (A) and three individual OA patients (OA1, OA2 and OA3) were counted on days 0, 1, 3 and 4 after incubation with or without AREG. The cell counts on days 1, 3 and 4 are expressed relative to 0 day. Statistically significant measurements are indicated (P < 0.05).The effect of AREG on the proliferation of synoviocytes from RA and OA patients. The synovial cells from three RA patients (RA1, RA2 and RA3) (A) and three individual OA patients (OA1, OA2 and OA3) were counted on days 0, 1, 3 and 4 after incubation with or without AREG. The cell counts on days 1, 3 and 4 are expressed relative to 0 day. Statistically significant measurements are indicated (P < 0.05).To examine if this phenomenon is reflected in the signal transduction machinery of synovial cells, we investigated the activation of the EGFR signaling pathway in the AREG-treated and untreated RA synoviocytes. We first examined the phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) at Thr202 and Tyr204 by western blot analysis. ERK1/2 phosphorylation indicates the activation of the EGFR signaling pathway.32 As shown in Fig. 5A, the phosphorylated ERK1/2 bands in the RA synoviocytes showed an increase in intensity when the cells had been treated with AREG; this effect peaked 8–12 h after AREG treatment but continued for 2–3 days. In contrast, the ERK1/2 protein levels remained largely unaffected by AREG treatment.Western blot analysis of RA and OA synovial cells incubated in the presence or absence of AREG. (A) Expression levels of ERK1/2 and its phospho-form (P-ERK1/2) that is phosphorylated at Thr202 and Tyr204.

(B) Expression levels of EGFR1, ERK1/2, P-ERK1/2, Grp94, Grp78 and synoviolin in synovial cells from individual RA and OA patients that were incubated with or without AREG (100 ng/ml) for 8 h. Alpha-tubulin served as a loading control. (C) Relative optical densities of the western blot bands in (B) to determine P-ERK1/2 expression relative to ERK1/2 expression.

(D) Relative optical densities of the western blot bands in (B) to determine Grp94 expression relative to alpha-tubulin expression.To compare the activation of EGFR signaling between RA and OA patients, we examined the activation of the EGFR signaling pathway in the synoviocytes from the five RA and three OA patients (Fig. 5B). We thus assessed the phosphorylated ERK1/2 expression levels by western blot analysis and expressed the results quantitatively by measuring the intensity of the lower phosphorylated band by densitometry and comparing it with the ERK1/2 band intensity (Fig. 5C). We found that the synoviocytes from the RA and OA patients expressed equivalent levels of EGFR and ERK1/2 proteins, regardless of AREG treatment. In contrast, AREG treatment upregulated the phosphorylated ERK1/2 expression levels much more strongly in the synoviocytes from RA2, RA3 and RA4 than in the synoviocytes of any of the OA patients. RA1 is an exception to this pattern as its limited phosphorylated ERK1/2 expression levels were similar to those in OA1–3. The AREG-induced upregulation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation was less apparent in the RA5 synovial cells because ERK1/2 was already activated in the absence of AREG.Synoviolin plays a role in the synovial hyperplasia of RA by controlling the ERAD system.10 To determine if the RA synovial cells have an abnormal ERAD system, we measured their levels of the ER stress proteins GRP78/BiP and GRP94, which protect cells from the stress-induced ER dysfunction that could lead to the accumulation of unfolded proteins.33 We found that while the synovial cells of the RA and OA patients have similar levels of GRP78/BiP (Fig. 5B and D), the RA synoviocytes show enhanced levels of GRP94, irrespective of whether they have been stimulated with AREG. This suggests that at least part of the ER-stress responsive pathway, namely, that mediated by GRP94, is more activated in RA synoviocytes than in OA synoviocytes. Thus, the ERAD pathway does appear to be abnormally upregulated in RA synoviocytes. We confirmed by QRT–PCR that the BMMC and PBMC cells of RA patients RA1–5 show enhanced AREG mRNA levels, unlike the BMMC and PBMC of OA patients OA1–3 (Supplementary Figure S5A). Thus, chronic activation of AREG/EGFR signaling appears to be augmented in RA patients. Since AREG is expressed as transmembrane precursors that are cleaved in the extracellular domain to release soluble growth factor,34 we speculated that the sera (PB) and bone marrow fluid (BM) of RA1–5 may show enhanced levels of cleaved AREG compared to the equivalent fluids of OA1–3. We tested this by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay but found only one patient, RA2, showed levels of cleaved AREG that exceeded the detection level of the assay (Supplementary Figure S5B). Thus, it is not clear whether RA patients indeed secrete higher AREG levels than OA patients.We also examined whether RA synoviocytes expressed higher synoviolin mRNA levels than OA synoviocytes in the presence or absence of AREG. However, we could not detect any significant differences between the RA and OA patients in this regard (Supplementary Figure S5C). It is not clear whether the synovial tissues of the patients would, like their cultured derivatives, show a similar lack of synoviolin upregulation.4. DiscussionIn this study, we report our comprehensive isolation of AURA genes that show augmented mRNA expression in the BMMC of RA patients as compared to their expression in OA patient BMMC (Fig. 1 and Table 1). Since RA patients suffer from defective central and peripheral B-cell tolerance checkpoints, and often display unusual immunoglobulin light chain repertoires that suggest impaired secondary recombination regulation,18 we had expected that many immune response genes would be identified as AURA genes. Indeed, >10% of the AURA genes are directly related to immune responses; moreover, while the other AURA genes may seem at first glance to be unrelated to immune responses, many of these can also be linked to immune responses (Table 1). QRT–PCR analysis on individual patient samples revealed that the AURA genes discussed below are significantly increased in the BMMC of many of the 50 RA patients we tested (Fig. 2). Thus, the identification of these genes may help us to understand the pathogenesis of RA.FKBP5, one of the cellular receptors for the immunosuppressant FK506, was expressed at higher mRNA levels in many RA patients than in the OA patients; this was true for the BMMC of the RA patients but not for their PBMC (Fig. 2C). FK506 has been suggested to be an effective drug for reducing the pain associated with RA.35 This is because it can suppress inflammation by inhibiting the production by synovial cells of prostaglandin E2; it does so by suppressing the IL-1β production by leukocytes.36 The enhanced FKBP5 expression in RA BMMC is not due to FK506 treatment since at the time of this study, treatment with FK506 was not permitted in Japan; consequently, none of the patients tested here have ever received FK506. In addition, the enhanced FKBP5 expression by RA BMMC does not correlate with therapeutic treatment using steroids. It remains possible, however, that the increased FKBP5 mRNA levels in the BMMC of RA patients may be due to treatment with other drugs. Alternatively, it may reflect genuine and spontaneous pathological events. Nevertheless, regardless of the cause of its elevated expression, the augmented FKBP expression may strongly inhibit the phosphatase activity of calcineurin, which could increase the dephosphorylation and thus inactivation of various substrates, including the NFAT family proteins and cytokines that are required for the expression of immunoregulatory molecules.TPST1 mediates tyrosine sulfation within the trans-Golgi system, which affects 1% of all tyrosines in eukaryotic cells. It has been previously suggested that this post-translational modification may play an important role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases because it regulates mononuclear cell function at various stages of the immune response by enhancing interactions between ligands and receptors.37 Notably, of the 62 identified target proteins of tyrosine sulfation, nine are cell adhesion molecules and chemokine receptors, which are both central players in leukocyte trafficking. Thus, the augmented expression of TPST1 in RA patients may elevate the sulfation of crucial tyrosine residues in chemokine receptors that could constitutively increase their binding affinities with their ligands (e.g. the binding of CXCL12–CXCR4).CLECSF9 belongs to the macrophage-inducible C-type lectin that serves multiple functions by recognizing carbohydrate chains; it plays important roles in macrophage function. Notably, a C-type lectin called DC-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3-grabbing non-integrin is also highly expressed by macrophages in the synovium of RA patients.38 However, the HH mRNA expression of macrophage-inducible C-type lectins is strongly induced in response to several inflammatory stimuli. Thus, the augmented expression of CLECSF9 in the BMMC of RA patients may simply be due to the inflammation in the joint.Unlike FKBP5 and TPST1 genes, the mRNA levels of G0S2, CXCR4 and NF-κB are increased in both the BMMC and PBMC of RA patients (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Figure S3). We previously showed that the PBMC of both systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients and healthy young females express enhanced levels of G0S2 mRNA.26 Thus, G0S2 may not actually be involved in the pathogenesis of RA. With regard to the chemokine receptor CXCR4, it was also identified as a inflammation-related gene that is upregulated in synovial cells of patients with pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS), which is a joint problem that usually affects the hip or knee and involves the lining of the joint becoming swollen and growing.8 The enhanced tyrosine sulfation of CXCR4 by augmented TPST1 activity, as described above, may also activate CXCR4, thereby elevating the ability of the CXCR4 ligand to induce the migration of bone marrow cells that could enhance the growth of synovial cells.39 CXCR4 expression is also upregulated in the spinal cord of animals with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, which is an animal model of autoimmune central nervous system inflammation.40 With regard to NF-κB, this molecule along with the receptor activator of NF-κB (RANK) and its ligand RANKL have been found to play pivotal roles in the pathophysiological process of RA.41 Thus, the increased mRNA levels of NF-κB in both the BMMC and PBMC of RA patients may contribute to the bone destruction mediated by activated NF-κB signaling pathway.42AURA1 encodes a novel protein that is similar to thioesterase. Since the thioesterase homologs are widespread, functions of thioesterase vary in the human genome.43 Thus, the physiological function of AURA1 remains unknown. A possible role that it could play in RA pathogenesis is suggested by the following observations. First, the stable overexpression of acyl-CoA thioesterase III in human and murine T-cell lines increased both peroxisome numbers and lipid droplet formation, which suggests that it participates in the metabolic regulation of peroxisome proliferation in T cells.44 Second, altered immune responsiveness is observed in mice deficient in palmitoyl protein thioesterase (PPT1) gene that is mutated in infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis.45 Third, CD4+ T cells are the prime mediators of RA in a mouse model SKG strain,46 and AURA1 expression is detected predominantly in resting and activated CD4+ T cells (Fig. 3).AREG is not directly related to immune responses but of all the genes examined, it showed the most conspicuously enhanced expression in both the BMMC and PBMC of many RA patients (Fig. 2A). We also found that the synovial cells of RA patients showed higher sensitivity to AREG, in terms of proliferation, than those of OA patients (Fig. 4). This is not due to augmented expression of EFGR (Fig. 5B, uppermost pane), but due to elevated activation of EGFR signaling pathway because the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was more enhanced in AREG-treated RA patient synovial cells than that of AREG-treated OA patient synovial cells (Fig. 5). We here present a working hypothesis to explain how augmented AREG expression in BMMC and PBMC of RA patients and subsequent activation of EGFR signaling pathway lead to hyperproliferation of synovial cells in the joints of the RA patients (Fig. 6). Namely, this enhanced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 elevates the expression of many downstream target genes, which may also require the activation of the ERAD system. 12 Given that the Ets-binding site (EBS) of the proximal promoter of the synoviolin gene is responsible for its expression,47 and that EBS-carrying genes are also activated by signaling events from the ERK pathway,48 it is possible that the enhanced activation of EGFR signaling induced by AREG may directly activate the expression of synoviolin as well as that of other genes, thereby inducing the hyperproliferation of synovial cells. Thus, it is possible that the ERAD system in RA patients is hyperactivated by synoviolin because of augmented AREG expression in blood cells, possibly in the macrophages that occur in the vicinity of the synovial cells of RA patients, releasing augmented amount of AREG. This hypothesis should be tested more rigourously in vivo in the future because the experiments using the isolated synoviocyte cells in tissue culture medium may display distinct response to AREG. Likewise, examination of other EGF family proteins in vivo can also be interesting future subjects.A working hypothesis to explain how augmented level of AREG in BMMC of RA patients may lead to hyperproliferation of synovial cells. Putative macrophages with enhanced expression of AREG precursor (ProAR) may approach to the synovial cells of the joint through blood flow, where they release AREG and activate the EGFR signaling pathway of synovial cells. Since Ets-binding site (ETS-1) of the proximal promoter of the synoviolin gene is one of the downstream targets of ERK pathway, the enhanced activation of EGFR signaling may directly activate the expression of synoviolin gene. The enhanced level of synoviolin activates the ERAD system, which may lead to hyperproliferation of synovial cells.A working hypothesis to explain how augmented level of AREG in BMMC of RA patients may lead to hyperproliferation of synovial cells.

Notably, metalloprotease-mediated AREG shedding and the subsequent activation of EGFR appears to play a critical role in the secretion of IL-8 by the human airway epithelium-like NCI-H292 cells that is induced by tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), a potent multifunctional cytokine that plays a central role in the pathogenesis of many inflammatory diseases like RA.53 Since TNF-α-induced IL-8 secretion was completely inhibited by the neutralizing antibody against AREG,53 this antibody could constitute a novel therapeutic tool for RA. Taken together, we propose that enhanced expression of AREG in BMMC and PMBC may play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of RA.We thank the patients and healthy volunteers who participated in this study.

IntroductionCyanobacteria performing oxygenic photosynthesis constitute one of the largest taxonomic groups of eubacteria. Although cyanobacterial species are morphologically and physiologically divergent, their fundamental metabolism is generally conserved. To maintain cellular integrity, they must coordinate their metabolisms in order to acclimate to their environmental conditions such as nutrient limitation. In the absence of combined nitrogen, diazotrophic cyanobacteria fix molecular nitrogen to avoid nitrogen deprivation.1 Non-diazotrophic cyanobacteria including Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, degrade their light harvesting apparatus called phycobilisome to provide nitrogen resources under nitrogen-limited conditions.2 This phycobilisome degradation is called bleaching (or chlorosis), resulting in a change in color of cultures from blue-green to yellow. In addition to physiological changes, it has been clarified that genes for mechanisms such as nitrogen transport and nitrogen assimilation are induced under nitrogen starvation in unicellular cyanobacteria.3,4 However, genome-wide transcript profiles following nitrogen depletion have not been examined in detail.In cyanobacteria, NtcA is known as a global nitrogen regulator belonging to the CRP (cAMP receptor protein) family.5 NtcA was discovered during genetic screening of mutants that failed to activate nitrogen assimilatory enzymes in Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942.6,In vivo and in vitro analyses revealed that 2-oxoglutarate, which is a signaling molecule for nitrogen starvation in cyanobacteria, promotes NtcA binding to the DNA promoter of glnA (encoding type I glutamine synthetase), and in transcription initiation by RNA polymerase.7–9 A DNase I footprinting study uncovered that NtcA interacted with a consensus DNA sequence containing the palindromic motif GTAN8TAC.10 In Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, purified NtcA binds to promoter regions of amt1 (encoding an ammonium transporter), glnA, glnB (encoding PII), icd (encoding isocitrate dehydrogenase), and sigE (encoding a group 2 sigma factor).3,11–14 Although a completely segregated ntcA mutant of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 has not been obtained, a partially segregated mutant showed abolished activations of glnA, glnB and glnN (encoding Type III glutamine synthetase) promoters under nitrogen starvation.15Nine genes for RNA polymerase sigma factors sigA–sigI, exist in the Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 genome.16 Of these sigma factor genes, sigE (sll1689) was shown to be induced by nitrogen depletion under the control of NtcA.14 SigE is also regulated by light/dark signals,17 and the circadian rhythm.18 Recently, we found that SigE positively regulated expression of sugar catabolic genes such as those involved in glycolysis, oxidative pentose phosphate (OPP) pathway and glycogen catabolism.19 For photosynthetic organisms such as cyanobacteria, sugar catabolism is essential for survival under dark conditions,20,21 and consistently, a sigE mutant cannot grow under light-activated heterotrophic conditions.19 In this study, we found that sugar catabolic pathways were activated under the control of NtcA during nitrogen depletion, and SigE and other regulatory elements simultaneously mediated their activations. The physiological significance of nitrogen activation of sugar catabolic genes is also discussed.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Bacterial strains and culture conditionsThe glucose-tolerant (GT) strain of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, isolated by Williams,22 and the cognate sigE and ntcA mutants were grown in BG-110 liquid medium (BG-11 without nitrogen source) with 5 mM NH4Cl (buffered with 20 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 8.0). We refer to this medium as ‘modified BG-11 medium’ in this study. Liquid cultures were bubbled with 2% (v/v) CO2 in air, at 30°C under continuous white light (ca. 70 μmol photons m−2 s−1).23 For plate cultures, BG-11 medium with 17.5 mM NaNO3 and 20 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 8.0 was solidified using 1.5% (w/v) agar (Nissui), and incubated in air containing 2% (v/v) CO2 at 30°C under continuous white light (ca. 70 μmol photons m−2 s−1). For sigE and ntcA mutants, 20 μg/ml kanamycin (SIGMA) and 80 μg/ml chloramphenicol (SIGMA) were supplemented in modified BG-11 liquid medium. Growth and cell densities were measured at A750 with a Beckman DU640 spectrophotometer.2.2. Construction of an ntcA mutantThe ntcA (sll1423) coding region was amplified by PCR using Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega), phosphorylated by T4 polynucleotide kinase (TaKaRa), and cloned into pUC119 vectors digested with SmaI (Toyobo) using blunt end ligation (Primers: forward, 5′-CCTGAGCTAATTCTAGGC-3′; reverse, 5′-GTTGTTCAATTGAGCCC-3′). The resulting plasmids were named pNtcA. The ntcA gene was interrupted at the BsmI site (bases 392 and 506) with a chloramphenicol resistance cassette derived from pKRP10,24 and was digested by SmaI. pUC119 vectors containing the interrupted ntcA gene were used for transformation of GT Synechocystis cells, and cells resistant to 5 μg/ml chloramphenicol were selected. After replating three times, mutant cells were maintained on plates containing 80 μg/ml chloramphenicol.2.3. Isolation of RNA and microarray analysisCells of mid-exponential phase cultures of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (A750, 0.5–0.7) grown in modified BG-11 medium were collected by centrifugation at 6600 g for 5 min. RNA was isolated by the acid phenol–chloroform method, as previously described.25 Microarray analysis was performed, as described by Suzuki et al.26 Signals were quantified using the ImaGene version 4.0 software (Bio Discovery).272.4. Northern blot analysisCells of mid-exponential phase cultures of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (A750, 0.5–0.7) grown in modified BG-11 medium were collected by filtration with 0.45 μm MF-membrane filters (Millipore), and were resuspended in BG-110 medium. After cultivation for 0 or 4 h, cells were collected, and RNA was extracted by the acid phenol–chloroform method.25 Methods for northern blot analysis have been described previously.28 Gene-specific probes were constructed as described previously.19,292.5. Enzymatic activities of G6PD and 6PGDGlucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD) activities were measured by monitoring glucose-6-phosphate- or 6-phosphogluconate-dependent increases in NADPH A340 using a Beckman DU640, as previously described.192.6. Estimation of glycogen levelsDetermination of cellular glycogen was performed as previously described.19 In brief, about 109 cells monitored using a spectrometer were suspended in 100 μl 3.5% (v/v) sulfuric acid solution, and were boiled for 40 min. Glucose produced by acid hydrolysis was quantified using o-toluidine, following protocols by Sigma Diagnostics (procedure No. 635; Sigma).2.7. Immunoblot analysisImmunoblot analysis was performed as described previously.30 Antisera against SigE and NtcA were produced by Osanai et al.19 and Imamura et al.,31 respectively.2.8. Complementation of sigE and ntcA mutationsA DNA fragment containing the sigE gene was amplified by PCR using the forward primer 5′-CTAGGGTTATTGACTGATTTG-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-AGCTACGCTAACTTGAAG-3′. The 5′ positions of the forward and reverse primers were set to correspond to 500 bp upstream of the initiation codon and to 501 bp downstream of the termination codon, respectively. The resulting 2.1 kb amplified fragment was phosphorylated by T4 polynucleotide kinase (TaKaRa), and was inserted into the cyanobacterial autonomous replication plasmid pVZ32232 digested with SmaI (Toyobo). Resultant complementation vectors were called pVZ322:sigE, and were introduced into sigE mutant cells using a triparental gene transfer method.32Constructs for ntcA complementation were prepared as follows: pNtcA plasmids were partially digested with DraI (TaKaRa), ligated with a kanamycin cassette derived from pUC4K (Pharmacia), digested by PstI (TaKaRa), and blunt-ended. Plasmids in which the kanamycin cassette was inserted in the preferred DraI site (located 120 bp downstream of the termination codon of ntcA) of pNtcA were chosen, and used to transform an ntcA mutant. Transformants were selected on BG-11 plates containing 5 μg/ml kanamycin, and were checked for chloramphenicol sensitivity.3. Results3.1. Sugar catabolic genes are induced by nitrogen depletionTo provide insights into transcript profiles during nitrogen starvation, we compared transcriptomes of GT cells cultivated for 0 or 4 h in nitrogen-depleted media. Total RNA extracted from both cells was utilized for microarray analysis with a gene chip containing fragments of cyanobacterial ORF [CyanoChip version 1.6 (TaKaRa)]. Of the 3076 genes represented on the array, expression levels of 306 genes were increased over 2-fold by nitrogen depletion for 4 h (Fig. 1, Supplementary Table S1). Microarray analysis demonstrated that genes for nitrogen transport (such as amt1, amt2, amt3 and nrtABCD) and nitrogen assimilation (glnA and glnN) were induced, consistent with previous studies.3,11,33 Moreover, we found that genes encoding enzymes involved in sugar catabolism such as those acting in glycolysis, OPP pathway and glycogen metabolism, which were included in the SigE regulon,19 were up-regulated (Table 1). Northern blot analysis confirmed that transcript levels of two glycolytic genes, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gap1) and pyruvate kinase (pyk1), were increased by nitrogen depletion in GT (Fig. 2A). On the other hand, expression of phosphofructokinase (pfkA; sll1196) that was also included in the SigE regulon showed little changes during nitrogen starvation. In addition to glycolytic genes, four genes for the OPP pathway, i.e. G6PD (zwf), a positive regulator of G6PD (opcA), 6PGD (gnd), and transaldolase (tal) were induced by nitrogen deprivation (Fig. 2B). Subsequently, we examined expressions of these genes in a previously constructed a sigE mutant (G50).19 In G50, it was shown that transcript levels of sugar catabolic genes were decreased in both light and dark conditions compared with GT.19 Northern blot analysis demonstrated that gap1, pyk1, zwf, opcA, gnd and tal were still induced regardless of sigE disruption, while pfkA (sll1196) was markedly repressed after nitrogen depletion in G50 (Fig. 2A and B). Consistent with transcriptional analyses, enzymatic activities of G6PD and 6PGD, two key enzymes of the OPP pathway, were also enhanced by nitrogen depletion in both GT and G50 (Fig. 2C and D).Genome-wide analysis of gene expression following induction or repression by nitrogen depletion. GT strain cultivated in ammonium medium was transferred into nitrogen-deprived medium by filtration. After 0 or 4 h, cells were collected, and their transcript profiles were compared. Each point represents expression ratio of 4 h/0 h after nitrogen depletion, and signal intensity in the GT strain at 0 h for an ORF fragment on the array is shown. Experiments were performed three times with biologically independent RNAs. Data from one of three independent experiments are shown.Genome-wide analysis of gene expression following induction or repression by nitrogen depletion.

PCC 6803 includes two genes for glycogen isoamylase (glgX), and two genes for glycogen phosphorylase (glgP). Microarray and northern blot analyses unraveled that expressions of the two glgX genes (slr1857 and slr0237) and one glgP gene (slr1367) were induced by nitrogen depletion (Table 1, Fig. 3A). In G50, glgX (slr0237) was still induced by nitrogen deprivation; however, expression of one glgX (slr1857) or the other glgP (slr1367) was not or less increased in G50 than in GT, respectively (Fig. 3A). In Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942, increased glycogen level was previously reported during nitrogen starvation.34 Therefore, in this study, we examined glycogen accumulation in Synechocystis, and demonstrated that glycogen levels were expectedly increased by nitrogen deprivation in both GT and G50 (Fig. 3B).(A) Northern blot analysis of transcripts derived from four glycogen catabolic genes.

After introduction of the plasmid, expression of SigE protein was confirmed by immunoblot analysis with an antiserum against SigE (Fig. 4A). Northern blot analysis showed that wild-type sigE gene restored transcript levels of sigE, zwf, gnd (Fig. 4B) and other genes (data not shown).Complementation of a sigE mutant.

Induction of sugar catabolic genes by nitrogen depletion is abolished by ntcA mutationData obtained with a sigE mutant indicated that other transcriptional regulators were potentially involved in induction of sugar catabolic genes during nitrogen starvation. In Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942, two-dimensional PAGE analysis suggested that most protein syntheses in response to nitrogen deprivation were dependent on NtcA either directly or indirectly.35 Hence, we constructed an ntcA mutant of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 to examine the role of this central nitrogen regulator (Fig. 5A). Consistent with a previous study,15,ntcA could not be deleted, and thus mutant cells contained both the wild-type and disrupted copies of the ntcA gene, resulting in about 50% decrease in NtcA protein compared with the parental strain (Fig. 5A). The resultant ntcA mutant was named GN20. GN20 cells grew slowly in modified BG-11 medium compared with the parental GT strain (growth rate of GN20 was about one-third to one-fourth of GT cells) (data not shown). Northern blot analyses of sugar catabolic genes gap1, pyk1, zwf, gnd, opcA, tal, glgX (slr0237) and glgP (slr1367), in GN20 showed that transcript levels were decreased even under normal growth conditions (similar to G50), but not or less increased by nitrogen depletion (different from G50), compared with GT (Fig. 5B). Since NtcA is thought to be a positive regulator of SigE,14 we considered that decreased transcripts for sugar catabolic genes under normal growth conditions were due to reduction in SigE protein levels in GN20. Northern blot analysis and immunoblotting confirmed that both sigE transcript and protein were decreased by ntcA mutation (Fig. 6A and B). In addition, induction of SigE protein during nitrogen starvation was not observed in GN20 (Fig. 6C). On the other hand, contrary to G50, GN20 showed abolished inductions of sugar catabolic genes by nitrogen depletion (Fig. 5B). Sequence motif analyses by us (data not shown) and by others36 did not demonstrate any NtcA-binding site within promoter regions of the corresponding sugar catabolic genes; therefore, NtcA appeared to be indirectly involved in their expression (See Discussion).Decreased inductions of sugar catabolic genes by nitrogen depletion in an ntcA mutant (GN20).

Total protein (5 μg) was subjected to immunoblotting with an antiserum against SigE.To genetically confirm that abolished inductions of sugar catabolic genes in GN20 actually resulted from ntcA deficiency, a complementation test was performed. The wild-type ntcA gene was integrated into GN20 by homologous recombination to restore the chromosomal ntcA gene. The resultant ntcA-complemented strain was named GN20Cp. Immunoblot analysis using an NtcA-antiserum demonstrated that protein level of NtcA was restored by complementation (Fig. 7A). Immunoblotting and northern blot analysis also confirmed that the wild-type ntcA gene restored SigE protein level, and induction of sugar catabolic genes under nitrogen starvation (Fig. 7B and C, and data not shown).Complementation of an ntcA mutant.

We found that although transcript levels of the examined genes were rather decreased, induced expression by nitrogen depletion was not affected by hik8 mutation as well as sigE and hik8 double mutation (Fig. 8 and data not shown). Thus, Hik8 is not responsible for the nitrogen-induced expression.Northern blot analysis of a hik8 mutant. Northern blot analysis of transcripts derived from four sugar catabolic genes.

DiscussionIn this study, we analyzed transcript profiles of nitrogen-deprived cells, and revealed that amounts of mRNAs derived from genes for glycolysis, OPP pathway and glycogen catabolism were increased by nitrogen depletion in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (Table 1, Figs 2A and B and 3A). Although two pfkA genes were less induced, OPP pathway genes such as zwf, opcA, gnd and tal were strongly induced by nitrogen depletion (Table 1, and Fig. 2A and B), implying that glucose was degraded mainly through the OPP pathway when nitrogen was limited, similar to heterotrophic conditions.38 However, in the case of glycogen metabolism, not only glycogen catabolic genes such as glgX and glgP but also glycogen anabolic genes glgB (1,4-alpha-glucan branching enzyme) were induced by nitrogen depletion (Table 1, Supplementary Table S1, and Fig. 3A). Glycogen level was increased during nitrogen starvation, and hence, net flow of glycogen metabolism was that of anabolism (Fig. 3B). Thus, current data suggest that glucose is utilized for both glucose catabolism and glycogen synthesis.Transcriptome analysis also revealed that genes for gluconeogenesis and the reductive pentose phosphate (Calvin–Benson–Basham) cycle were repressed by nitrogen deprivation (Supplementary Table S1). For example, gap2 (sll1342) (encoding glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, catalyzing only anabolic reactions39) and rbcL, S, X (slr0009, slr0011 and slr0012 encoding the large and small subunits and chaperone of ribulose-1,5-bis phosphate carboxylase, respectively) were repressed by nitrogen depletion. Expression ratios (GT 4 h/0 h after nitrogen depletion) were 0.45, 0.07, 0.16 and 0.19, respectively for gap2, rbcL, S, and X. (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1). Genes for carbon concentration mechanism proteins encoded by the operon sll1028-sll1032, were also repressed by nitrogen depletion (Supplementary Table S1), and thus, inorganic carbon fixation was likely to be repressed. As a whole, net increase of cellular carbon content appeared to be arrested to compensate for the carbon/nitrogen (C/N) imbalance in response to nitrogen depletion.Prior to this study, transcriptional interaction between glucose catabolism and nitrogen metabolism has been suggested in some cyanobacteria. In the nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium Nostoc punctiforme strain ATCC 29133, the zwf-opcA operon involved in the OPP pathway is induced by nitrogen depletion.40 Specific enzymatic activities for the OPP pathway were shown to increase up to 70-folds in heterocysts, that are specific cells for nitrogen fixation in filamentous cyanobacteria,41 and it was suggested that G6PD and 6PGD produced the reducing powers for nitrogen fixation instead of the photosynthetic linear electron flow. In the unicellular cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942, PSII activity rapidly declined after nitrogen starvation,34 indicating the loss of reducing power production by photosynthesis. Thus, the OPP pathway may provide the reducing power, instead of photosynthesis during nitrogen starvation.Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 genomes encode each two isozymes for several sugar metabolic steps, and some of these sets are differentially regulated. In a previous study, we showed that one of two pyruvate kinase genes, pyk1 (sll0587) was positively regulated by SigE, while the other pyk2 (sll1275) was not.19 In this study, we also found that pyk1 was induced by nitrogen depletion while pyk2 was rather repressed (Table 1, Fig. 2A). Of the two phosphofructokinase genes, only pfkA (sll1196) showed SigE-dependent expression, and required SigE to keep a constant transcript level after nitrogen depletion (Fig. 2A). In the case of two glycogen phosphorylases, one glgP (slr1367) was more induced than the other glgP (sll1356) by nitrogen depletion (Table 1, Fig. 3A), suggesting that GlgP encoded by slr1367 was the major glycogen phosphorylase under nitrogen-limited conditions. With regard to glycogen isoamylases, transcript levels of both two glgX genes were increased by nitrogen depletion (Table 1, Fig. 3A). However, induction of one glgX (slr1857) was diminished by sigE mutation, whereas the other glgX (slr0237) was still induced in a sigE mutant (Fig. 3A). Thus, these results suggested that differential regulatory pathways were necessary for maintaining metabolic integrity under various environmental conditions.Induction of sugar catabolic genes in response to nitrogen depletion was still observed in a sigE mutant, whereas it was abolished in an ntcA mutant (Table 2). Bioinformatic analysis suggested that sugar catabolic genes are not included in the NtcA regulon.36 Indeed, no sequence motifs recognized by NtcA were found in promoter regions of sugar catabolic genes (data not shown). Therefore, other regulator(s), which is (are) under the control of NtcA, is (are) probably involved in inductions of sugar catabolic genes during nitrogen starvation (Fig. 9). Northern blot analysis demonstrated that Hik8 was not relevant to these nitrogen-responsive inductions (Fig. 8 and data not shown). Su et al.36 predicted that the transcriptional regulators including histidine kinase (slr1147) and three response regulators (sll1330, sll1291 and sll1624) were included in the NtcA regulon. Among them, two response regulators, i.e. sll1330 and sll1291 were actually induced by nitrogen depletion (Supplementary Table S1, and data not shown). Thus, future studies will unravel regulatory networks responsible for expressions of sugar catabolic genes under nitrogen starvation.Schematic model for the regulation of sugar catabolic gene expression. SigE and Hik8 positively regulate gene expression in sugar catabolism under normal growth conditions, as previously demonstrated.19,37 In this study, it was demonstrated that sugar catabolic gene expression was enhanced by nitrogen depletion. Besides SigE, other factor(s), which are under the control of NtcA, is (are) involved in catabolic gene expression during nitrogen starvation.Schematic model for the regulation of sugar catabolic gene expression.

This palindrome sequence motif was not found in upstream of other sugar catabolic genes, implying this motif is for genes for the OPP pathway. Upstream region of gnd in Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 also contains AGAAATTTT (data not shown).

IntroductionChloroplast non-coding regions evolve through accumulated nucleotide substitutions and microstructural mutations such as insertions and deletions (=indels, represented by gaps) and inversions. Indels and inversions are thought to be a major driving force in sequence evolution,1 and Kelchner,2 who recently reviewed the evolution of chloroplast non-coding sequences, suggested that microstructural mutations would not be randomly distributed throughout chloroplast genomes, because the frequency at which such mutations arise often depends strongly on sequence context. Kelchner2 claimed, therefore, that it is essential to understand the evolutionary features of microstructural mutations in order to use them in phylogenetic or other evolutionary studies.Ingvarsson et al.3 studied indel evolution in three chloroplast intergenic regions (trnL-trnF, trnH-psbA and trnG-trnS) of two Silene species to assess the phylogenetic utility of indels. Hamilton et al.4 also investigated the frequency and the distribution of indels in six chloroplast intergenic regions (psbB–psbH, atpB–rbcL, trnL–trnH, rpl20–5'rps12, trnS–trnG and trnH–psbA) from Lecythidaceae. These data suggest that chloroplast indels behave as neutral variants that arise randomly. However, it is still unsettled whether indels have a uniformly random distribution throughout chloroplast genome or whether indel frequencies are influenced by base composition or other DNA sequence-dependent influences. Thus, a comprehensive study is needed of sequence context-dependent variation in the frequency of microstructural mutations in whole chloroplast genomes.More than 30 chloroplast genomes have been completely sequenced from eukaryotic algae and land plants including the three economically important Poaceae crop plants rice5, maize6 and wheat7. Using these three chloroplast genome sequences, Matsuoka et al.8 first conducted a comparative study of the nucleotide sequences of 106 chloroplast genes. In this study of coding regions, sequence alignments were unambiguous; however, the alignment of non-coding chloroplast sequences can be much more difficult and ambiguous, resulting in multiple alternative alignments and different patterns of indels. For this reason, there has been no large scale comparative study of entire non-coding regions. Thus, it is desirable to study closely related pairs of non-coding sequences, for which an unambiguous alignment can be made. Recently, the whole chloroplast genome sequence of a fourth grass plant, sugarcane, was determined.9 Both sugarcane and maize belong to the subtribe Saccharinae of the tribe Andropogoneae, Poaceae, and are phylogenetically very close.10,11 For example, Asano et al.9 confirmed that the number and order of functional chloroplast genes are identical throughout the chloroplast genomes of sugarcane and maize. More recently, Tang et al.12 determined the complete chloroplast genome sequence of cultivated rice var. indica and japonica. These data provided a good opportunity to conduct a comparative analysis of non-coding sequences in chloroplast genomes.This study presents comparative analyses of number of indels and the distribution in two sequence data sets: data set (a) was the intergenic regions of the chloroplast genomes of sugarcane (Saccharum offcinarum) and maize (Zea mays); data set (b) includes Oryza sativa var. indica and var. japonica. These two data sets were chosen in part because the divergence time of DNA sequences in each data group is markedly different. Mutation frequencies were analyzed in >38 kb non-coding DNA sequences from 126 intergenic regions in the chloroplast genomes of these species. The number of indels was counted in each intergenic region independently, and their frequencies and distribution patterns in chloroplast genomes were calculated en masse, based on the idea that a single linear linkage profile is associated with uniparental inheritance of chloroplast DNA.13 Furthermore, the evolutionary rate of indels in the chloroplast intergenic region was estimated. Based on these findings and previous reports, the evolutionary implications of indels are discussed.2. Data and methodsThe entire chloroplast genome sequence from sugarcane (Saccharum offcinarum, DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank accession no. AP006714), maize (Zea mays, X86563) and rice (Oryza sativa var. japonica; AY522331 and var. indica; AY522329)12 were obtained from DDBJ. In this study, data for O. sativa var. japonica (GenBank accession no. X15901)5 was not analyzed, because Tang et al.12 noticed that this accession is somewhat anomalous and may be a variant of the Nipponbare chloroplast.Multiple sequences were aligned by Clustal W14 using default settings which were adjusted manually. Indels were not classified as insertions or deletions, because an outgroup was not included in the data sets. The chloroplast genome is comprised of two large inverted repeat (IR) regions as well as large single copy (LSC) and small single copy (SSC) regions.15 All mutations in IR, LSC and SSC were analyzed separately. Pseudogenes and their adjacent regions were excluded from all analyses, because the borders of pseudogenes tend to be ambiguous. Indel sequences were only analyzed when homologous genes were identified on both sides of the specific intergenic region. In vascular plants, introns are difficult to identify because most chloroplast genes are expressed as polycistronic transcription units (reviewed by Sugita and Sugiura16). In this study, therefore, intronic regions were not analyzed. The sequence alignments of multiple chloroplast genomes used in this study are available upon request.DnaSP version 3.0017 was used to estimate the number of net nucleotide substitutions between two populations (DXY)18 in aligned sequence. Indels were classified into tandem repeat or non-repeat indels, according to Ingvarsson et al.3 (see Supplementary Material online Table 1-1 and 1-2). Tandem repeat indels include both perfect and imperfect repeats of a sequence motif ≥2 bp in length.3. Results and discussionAccurate DNA sequence alignments are essential when analyzing the evolution of DNA coding or non-coding sequences. In the present study, ambiguous sequence alignment of chloroplast non-coding regions and incorrect indel assignments were avoided by selecting input DNA sequences from plants belonging to closely related taxa. For the selected plant species and DNA regions, intergenic chloroplast DNA sequences were aligned without difficulty, and it was not necessary to exclude any DNA sequence regions due to ambiguity in the sequence alignment. This study analyzes indels and nucleotide substitutions in two data sets: data set (a) consisted of chloroplast DNA from sugarcane and maize; and data set (b) consisted of chloroplast DNA from O. sativa var. indica and japonica. The number and positions of all mutations in each data set were determined and are listed in Supplementary Tables 1-1 and 1-2, respectively. Table 1 summarizes the number of nucleotide substitutions, tandem repeat indels, non-repeat indels and the mean and median indel length for each data set.Number of substitutions and indels in whole chloroplast intergenic regions in sugarcane and maize [data set (a)] or Oryza sativa var. japonica and var. indica [data set (b)].Numbers in the parentheses indicate the values divided by total length of intergenic region (%).Number of substitutions and indels in whole chloroplast intergenic regions in sugarcane and maize [data set (a)] or Oryza sativa var. japonica and var. indica [data set (b)].Numbers in the parentheses indicate the values divided by total length of intergenic region (%).3.1. Dominance of single nucleotide indels in non-coding regionsThe distribution of indels of different length was determined in LSC and SSC regions for data set (a) and the results are presented graphically in Fig. 1A. The number of indels decreases rapidly as indel length increases, such that short indels, especially 1 bp indels, are highly enriched in this data set (Fig. 1A and B). A similar pattern was reported previously by Hamilton et al.4, who compared six chloroplast intergenic regions in species of Lecythidaceae. A strong linear relationship (R2 = 0.889, P < 0.001) was detected in a plot of ln (indel number) versus ln (indel length). These results agree with a previous study in which indel size distribution was analyzed in human and chimpanzee processed pseudogenes.19 Furthermore, in the present study, single nucleotide indels represented 41% of total indels in LSC + SSC regions. Similar estimates have been reported previously in the following studies: 50% single nucleotide indels in human and rodent pseudogenes,19 45% in the δ-globin region and 43% in the δ-globin spacer region,20 50% in rodent processed pseudogenes21 and 41% in plant non-coding DNA.22 Thus, we noticed that single nucleotide indels are the predominant type of indel occurring between recently diverged DNA sequences from various organisms.Number of indels and length was counted in SC (LSC + SSC) regions in data set (a).

Number and distribution pattern of indels in chloroplast intergenic regionsThe low level of variation between O. sativa var. indica and japonica was previously reported by Tang et al.12 In this study, a large number of mutations were identified in data set (a) (201 indels and 373 base substitutions), while ∼10-fold fewer mutations were identified in data set (b) (16 indels and 22 base substitutions), even though the total length of the intergenic sequences in the two data sets were very similar. In addition, in data set (a), the length distribution of indels was 1–264 bp, whereas which was 1–32 bp in data set (b). These different patterns of indel events between data sets (a) and (b) could be simply associated with the different level of divergence time. Interestingly, Golengerg et al.22 has reported in a study of chloroplast non-coding DNA sequences in monocot crops that the relative proportion of indels in the mutation spectrum is lower in more highly diverged species than in closely related species. In data set (a), the number of indels was approximately half (50.3%) the number of nucleotide substitutions, while in data set (b), the number of indels was 72.7% the number of nucleotide substitutions. Regarding this tendency, Golengerg et al.22 further suggested that ‘superimposed changes’ affects indel number depend on the divergence time increasing. Namely, ‘recurrent’ indel events could increase the size of an indel length with decreasing of indel number. Our results do not contradict the assumptions of Golengerg et al.22 but the preset data is too deficient to test them. More sequence data from complete chloroplast genomes are needed.Ingvarsson et al.3 investigated indel frequencies among closely related taxa and they concluded that repeat indels evolve at a higher rate than non-repeat indels. In this study, as shown in Table 1, most indels in data set (b) were tandem repeat indels, whereas, the number and distribution of tandem repeat and non-repeat indels was similar in data set (a). This difference between data sets (a) and (b) is also attributable to the different divergence times for the two data sets. Why do the frequencies of tandem repeat and non-repeat indels differ as a function of divergence time? To explain this difference, the mechanism by which indels arise must be considered. It is not well established that tandem repeat indels, which involve adding or subtracting short repeat sequences, result from polymerase slippage (i.e. slipped strand mispairing) during DNA replication.23 Although there have also been few evolutionary studies on non-repeat indels, Levinson and Gutman23 proposed that non-repeat indels arise in DNA sequences whose flanking sequences include repeat sequences. This proposal implies that the mechanism by which tandem repeat sequences arise depends on the structure of an existing repeat at the site of the tandem repeat, whereas the mechanism by which arise depends on the presence of repeat sequences at a distant site in flanking DNA. Interestingly, if their mechanism is conceivable, their mechanism by which non-repeat indels arise increase a probability of ‘superimposed changes’. Briefly, it is likely that the rate of superimposed changes is accelerated by repeat sequences, which act as a mutational ‘trigger,’ explaining the fact that the rate of tandem repeat indels decrease as divergence time increases, as observed in data set (a).3.3. Relationship between indel number and base compositionHere, the relationship between indel number and base composition in chloroplast DNA is considered. It is well known that the chloroplast genome in monocot plants is very AT-rich (≈61% A/T24). Morton25 noted a positive correlation between the number of transversions and AT-richness in rice and maize chloroplast genomes, and he proposed that the AT-richness of chloroplast DNA might have an impact on patterns of nucleotide substitution. However, the relationships between base composition and ‘microstructural changes’ in plant whole genomes has not been systematically studied. Most of tandem repeat sequences in chloroplast DNA are composed of either poly A/T or poly G/C-containing repeats.2 In data set (a), we observed that 20 of 104 tandem repeat indels include multiple Gs or Cs (Supplementary Table 1-1), indicating strong and statistically significant bias towards A/T-rich tandem repeat indels (Fisher's exact test, P < 0.001). This result also suggests that AT-richness influences the distribution of indels in the chloroplast genome. Zhou et al.26 investigated the distribution of poly A/T and poly G/C repeats in 27 eukaryotes with various GC contents from 20 to 60%. Interestingly, their results also indicated that overall GC contents affect the number of poly A/T or poly G/C. These findings support the implication that the AT-richness of chloroplast DNA influences both the dynamics of nucleotide substitution and the number of tandem repeat indels.3.4. Evolutionary rate of indels in chloroplast intergenic regionsFigure 2 shows the number of nucleotide substitutions and indels in each intergenic region examined in this study. Although the length of indels was not considered in this analysis, the number of indels correlated significantly with the length of the intergenic region. Linear regression analysis suggested a strong linear relationship between the two variables (P < 0.001), and a quadratic relationship did not provide a better fit for the data (quadratic fit for all indels: R2 adjusted = 0.6339; data not shown). These data indicate that the number of indels is proportionate to the length of the region and its divergence time. In addition, it can be concluded that the slope of each line is a reasonable estimate of the mutation number per base pair.Number of nucleotide substitutions and indels in data set (a) excluding IR (a + b).

Total indels, tandem repeat indels and non-repeat indels are plotted versus length (bp) of each intergenic region. The x-axis is truncated at 90% of total indel events. The best-fit linear regression lines are shown.The following calculations were made to estimate the rate of indel mutations in this study. The divergence time, T, for two species is given by T = DXY/2l,18 where l is the rate of nucleotide substitution per site per year. Since there is no direct estimate of the divergence time between sugarcane and maize, we estimated the divergence time from analyzing variation in their rbcL sequences (GenBank accession nos AP006714 and ZMA86563, respectively). As a result, the number of nucleotide substitutions (DXY) between sugarcane and maize was 0.00699 for the rbcL gene and the synonymous and non-synonymous substitution rates for rbcL, I, were obtained from a previous estimate for the grass family.27 This calculation indicates a putative divergence time for sugarcane and maize of ≈7.6 million years (Mya). Takahashi et al.28 also roughly estimated a divergence time of 5–6 Mya between Saccharum species and maize using 18 chloroplast regions. Therefore, we decided to use our estimated divergence time for the further analysis.In this study, the rate of indel mutations was estimated using a novel method, as follows. The slope of the line in Fig. 2 is the mutation rate per base pair. Using the fact that the region length and indel number have a positive linear relationship (R2 = 0.62, P < 0.001), it can be calculated that the intergenic regions of chloroplast genomes accumulate indel mutations at an average rate of 0.006 ± 0.00037 per site (= slope of a line). As a result, the rate of indel mutation is estimated to be ≈0.8 ± 0.04 × 10−9 mutations per site per year. Saitou and Ueda20 calculated the rates of indels in non-coding sequences in primates as ≈2 × 10−9 for mitochondrial DNA and ≈0.2 × 10−9 for nuclear DNA, respectively. Thus, this study suggests that the indel mutation rate in chloroplast DNA is intermediate between the previous estimate for mitochondrial and nuclear DNA. However, Saitou and Ueda20 also showed that the rate of nucleotide substitutions was ∼10 times higher than the rate of indels for nuclear and mitochondrial non-coding DNA. In this study, the average nucleotide substitution rate was 0.0116 ± 0.00052 per site (= slope of a line, see Fig. 2), which is approximately half the average indel mutation rate (see Fig. 3). In order to validate the method used here, the same method was used to calculate that the nucleotide substitution rate in chloroplast DNA is ≈1.52 ± 0.06 × 10−9 substitutions per site per year. This value is quite similar to the previously estimated substitution rate for rbcL in the grass family of ≈1.3 × 10−9 substitutions per synonymous site per year.27 These data suggest that the stated estimate for indel mutation rate in chloroplast intergenic DNA, 0.8 ± 0.04 × 10−9 mutations per site per year, is a reasonable estimate, and that the novel method used here to arrive at this estimate is valid.Relationship between number of substitutions (x-axis) and that of indels (y-axis) in each intergenic region from data set (a) excluding IR (a + b). The best-fit line from linear regression analysis is shown.Relationship between number of substitutions (x-axis) and that of indels (y-axis) in each intergenic region from data set (a) excluding IR (a + b). The best-fit line from linear regression analysis is shown.The validity of the estimated indel mutation rate was also tested by examining data set (b). Ma and Bennetzen29 used variation in nuclear DNA to estimate that the indica and japonica genomes share a common ancestor ≈0.44 Mya. Using nuclear genes, Zhu and Ge30 also estimated the divergence time between var. japonica and indica (≈0.4 Mya). Based on this divergence time, the expected number of indels between indica and japonica is 8.92 ± 0.446 in a total of 12 657 bp excluding the IR region (Supplementary Table 1-2). This estimate is about half of the observed number of indels (16) in data set (b) (Table 1). If we assume that indel mutations have a Poisson distribution, the probability that 16 indels arose in the chloroplast intergenic regions in 0.44 million years is not rejected (P > 0.05). This means that the rate of indel mutations estimated here is at least possible in sugarcane, maize and rice, despite the fact that there are evolutionary heterogeneities for tandem repeat and non-repeat indels. This information will facilitate studies of genetic variation or differentiation in plant species and may be useful for management of germplasm, genotyping or phylogenetic analyses.3.5. Conserved nature of IR regionIn most of the chloroplast genomes, there are two large IR regions (≈30 kb each). The evolutionarily conserved nature of these large IR regions in chloroplast DNA has been reported by several authors.(31–33) Palmer32 proposed that this highly conserved property may be attributed to the fact that approximately one-third of the IR region is occupied by rRNA genes. Recently, Matsuoka et al.8 confirmed that rRNA genes are highly conserved compared with non-rRNA genes. Table 1 shows that the number of nucleotide substitutions in SC (LSC + SSC) was ∼20 times higher than in the IR (a + b) region in data set (a). Furthermore, no substitutions or indels occurred in the IR (a + b) region in data set (b). These results clearly show that nucleotide substitutions and indels occur at a much lower rate in the IR (a + b) region than in SC (LSC + SSC) regions. Thus, the conserved nature of the IR (a + b) regions with respect to microstructural changes is confirmed in this study. Since functional constraints do not apply to non-coding regions and synonymous sites are implausible, another explanation for this phenomenon is needed. Wolfe et al.33 already pointed out based on their sequence analyses that the highly conserved nature of IR sequences does depend on other dimension(s) for a reduced mutation rate in the IR region or a bias against mutations during DNA repair in IR DNA rather than on a functional constraint. Birky and Walsh34 insisted from a theoretical study that a difference in the synonymous substitution rate for the IR and SC (LSC + SSC) regions was resulted from the fact that IR sequences are duplicated in the chloroplast genome. Perry and Wolfe35 compared the synonymous substitution rate in chloroplast genes in duplicated IR (most plants are this type) and single-copy IR (only one single-copy IR in the chloroplast genome) in legume species. The result showed that the synonymous substitution rate in IR genes was 2.3-fold lower in duplicated IR than in single-copy IR. Based on these findings, consequently, it can be concluded that the highly conserved nature of duplicated IR is a function of DNA structure and not a function of primary DNA sequence.We are indebted Dr K.

IntroductionAlternative pre-mRNA splicing (AS) is a biological mechanism for producing multiple transcripts from a single gene. Genomic research has revealed that AS occurs in 30–60% of human genes.1–4 Due to AS, higher eukaryotes can generate a number of protein-encoding transcripts from a single gene, thereby increasing the diversity of their proteomes.5 Although proteins from one gene have the same or similar functions, they can have different characteristics, such as their binding properties, intracellular localization, enzymatic activity, regulation and stability.6 Thus, knowledge of AS is important for understanding the complex biological systems in higher eukaryotes. Furthermore, AS in conjunction with transcriptional regulation determines tissue-specific expression of transcript isoforms of a gene.7 One of the effects of AS is to control of RNA isoform stability by nonsense-mediated decay.8,9 AS is of interest to pharmaceutical research because aberrant AS can lead to various genetic diseases and cancers.10,11Several different strategies have been applied to AS analysis, including (i) EST mapping against mRNA12, (ii) mRNA/EST/protein mapping to the genome2–4,13–15, (iii) splicing microarray analysis16–18 and (iv) ab initio machine learning approaches.19–21 Among these methods, genome-based mRNA/EST alignment has been an important methodology for in silico detection of AS because ESTs and mRNAs are the most abundant resources and are considered direct evidence of the expressed genes. A number of algorithms to analyse AS using genomic alignment of expressed sequences have been reported. Kan et al.2 classified links between exons within a gene according to four types of connectivity, represented them as a matrix, and then constructed transcripts using matrix analysis to identify the paths that can be connected.Recently, several studies have suggested graphical methods to represent gene structure.4,22–25 In these methods, exons and introns are verified from structural information obtained by genomic mapping, and splice graphs are constructed in which exons and introns constitute nodes and edges, respectively; however, generating all possible isoforms by graph traversal can produce many false transcripts. Lee's group22,26 tried to overcome this problem by using a dynamic programming method. They suggested use of the heaviest bundling algorithm, in which a transcript with only partial alignment information is extended to the maximum length of the path with the maximum likelihood. On the other hand, in ECgene, Kim et al. discriminated the isoforms into three groups by considering the minimum set of sequence data that indicates the reliability of the corresponding transcript.AS makes it possible to generate genetic products with different functions from a single gene. This process is controlled by numerous splicing regulatory factors, including serine/arginine-rich proteins that can bind to cognate sequence elements in mRNA precursor such as exonic splicing enhancer, exonic splicing silencer, intron splicing enhancer and intronic splicing silencer sequences, and regulate the splice site selections.27 The outcome of the AS process can vary depending on several factors, such as the tissue, the developmental stage or the environmental conditions.1,5,28 Therefore, global studies of condition-specific AS are required to precisely understand the function of genes. Xu et al.29 examined tissue-specific AS using Bayesian statistics and EST tissue information, which focuses on only single AS events rather than on the transcript levels. Because each transcript may be the result of many sequential AS events, it is difficult to correlate the tissue specificity of an individual AS event with that of the transcript. In this study, we provide a methodology and results for reconstructing and classifying transcript variants from a splice graph that contains only valid AS sets according to binomial statistics (i.e. an observed frequency of >1% with a 95% confidence level). Moreover, we provide global information on the tissue specificity of transcript isoforms and the distinct AS events according to the organizational information from human and mouse ESTs.2 Materials and Methods2.1 Data preparationHuman and mouse mRNAs deposited in GenBank (2006 June version) were retrieved using the following search term: ‘human[Organism] AND biomol mRNA [Properties] NOT gbdiv est[Properties]’. More than 7.5 million human ESTs and ∼4.6 million mouse ESTs were collected from dbEST (2006 June version). Repeat-masked genomic contig sequences of human and mouse were obtained from NCBI (Build 36 for human and mouse). The cDNA library information for human and mouse was downloaded from the Cancer Genome Anatomy Project (CGAP) website (Author Webpage). Using CGAP library information, we classified all ESTs from 8616 human cDNA libraries into 46 tissues, except for ‘embryonic tissues’, ‘head and neck’, ‘pooled tissue’, ‘uncharacterized tissue’ and ‘whole body’. We also separated the histological status of the ESTs into ‘normal’, ‘cancer’, or ‘unknown’ according to the CGAP histology classification. We used only ESTs from the ‘normal’ library for analysis of tissue specificity. Gene annotation including gene ontology (GO) assignments was performed using GeneKeyDB.302.2 Pre-processing and genomic mappingWe generated a non-redundant set of contigs with known chromosomal locations and orientations and used it as a template for genomic alignment. PolyA stretches of mRNA/ESTs were removed, and the EST sequences were trimmed by 20 nt at both ends as previously described.4 The presence of a polyA tail or polyA addition signal(s) for each query was recorded and used later for the detection of the gene terminus. We prepared a non-redundant set of mRNAs by running the ‘nrdb’ program. Expressed sequences longer than 100 nt were positioned in the genome by homology-based comparison using BLAT31 and sim432. After fast alignment using BLAT, top five best matches for a query were refined by sim4 alignment using the genomic region including 10kb flanking regions at both ends of the original BLAT-mapped position. We saved only sequences with >60% coverage and >92% identity with ESTs or >96% identity with mRNAs (Fig. 1). If several genomic loci satisfied the criteria for a single query, the best match was regarded as the proper alignment.Flow chart of the identification of the TISA.

The results for each step of the human TISA analysis are shown.2.3 Genomic clusteringBy scanning each chromosome from the start, we compared the genomic alignment structures of full-length mRNAs whose alignment region overlapped with clustered mRNAs that share at least one common splice site. If the alignment showed a distinct structure, we created a new cluster. From the first cluster, we constructed a preliminary reconstructed structure (RS) that corresponds to a gene unit composed of exon/intron sets and their linkage relationships. During the clustering process, we extended the gene structure whenever new exons or introns were recognized. After clustering the full-length mRNAs, partial mRNAs and ESTs aligned within the preliminary gene boundary were retrieved and compared with the RS structure. We ignored clustering in the genomic region without full-length mRNA mapping, even though many ESTs or partial mRNAs were aligned in that region. We allowed all possible splice sequences as well as canonical splice sequences (CSSs; i.e. GT-AT, GC-AG and AT-AC); however, in the case of non-CSSs, we approved them only if they were confirmed by at least five ESTs. The query orientation along the genome was re-evaluated based on the splice site sequence of the query. For example, if a splice sequence set of a given query was mainly composed of GT-AG, it is obvious that the query orientation along the genome was forward. If a splice sequence set was mainly composed of CT-AC, the query was aligned in a reverse direction. The orientation of a gene was determined as the same as the query. Comparisons of the splice site position and its orientation were used as the main criteria for deciding whether a query should be included in a given cluster.2.4 Establishment of exon and intron setsTo measure the confidence of RS exons and introns, we applied a custom scoring scheme. The reliability of RS exons depends on (i) whether the splice sequences of introns linked at both ends of the exon are CSS or non-CSS and (ii) how many queries support the given exon or intron structure. For example, the exons linked with CSS introns at both ends and supported by a number of mRNAs and ESTs have high scores. Because full-length mRNAs provide more reliable evidence than ESTs, we imposed a double score for the exons and introns derived from full-length mRNAs. The group of RS exons/introns whose hard-edge boundaries are within ±6 nt were merged into a single exon or intron and rescored. In the process of RS exon/intron merging, the exon or intron with the best score was selected as a representative. Finally, RS exons with scores higher than the cutoff were saved and used for linkage analysis. The minimal requirements for saving an exon were that it should be supported by at least one EST whose boundaries are linked to CSS introns at both ends. For example, if an internal exon is supported by two ESTs and is linked with non-CSS introns at both ends, its exon score will be 0.4 and 0.4 for the score of non-CSS linked exon boundary is given as 0.2. Because the score of this exon is lower than the cutoff value (for first exon, [−, 1.0]; internal exon, [1.0, 1.0]; last exon, [1.0, −]), it was discarded from the RS exon set. The same rule was applied to the intron scoring and selection (cutoff score = 1.0). We discarded internal exons shorter than 10 bp and introns shorter than 20 bp.2.5 Evaluation and selection of alternative linkage relationshipsWe applied a 1% frequency threshold (f = 0.01) and a 95% CI as cutoff criteria. We allowed only the alternative linkage relationships satisfying the above condition in the splice graph.2.6 Transcript reconstruction and classificationAfter establishing the non-redundant exon/intron sets statistically verified as described above, we found all possible paths by traveling the nodes (i.e. exons) through edges (i.e. introns) in a splice graph starting from the first exon (eTag = 1) and finishing at the last exon (eTag = 3). From each path, we reconstructed a transcript structure in a given gene. For each transcript, we compared its genomic structure one by one with all of query structures clustered in a gene and arranged the list of queries whose structure do not collide with the transcript structure (Fig. 2C). Then, we checked the coverage of each transcript structure supported by non-colliding queries and subdivided the transcripts into three classes. In Class I, all of the exons and introns in a transcript were supported by query structure(s) or its combinations. As for Class II, at least one of exons or introns in a transcript was not validated. In Class III, there is no supporting evidence for a transcript. Class I transcripts represent most reliable set of transcripts generated from the splice graph. Class III transcripts are least reliable in which all the exon–exon connections are only theoretically possible in a graph.Schematic diagram of the genomic cluster, splice graph and the reconstruction and classification of transcript variants in human SCARF1 gene. In this gene cluster, 13 mRNAs (full-length: dark green, partial: bright green) and 32 ESTs (grey) were clustered as a single gene unit. There are seven AS events in total. Among them, only four AS events are valid and finally remained in the splice graph.

Alternative splice borders and alternative exonic regions are also represented as dashed lines and dashed boxes.

The supporting queries for each transcript isoform are indicated. For all the eight transcript structures 23 queries are common; however, those only cover 5′ part of the gene and the last exon. After examination of the supporting query structures for each isoform, each transcript isoform was classified into Classes I, II or III. In this example, there is no Class III transcript. Exons and introns not supported by clustered queries for a given transcript in Class II are represented as blank boxes and dashed lines, respectively. For example, in transcript isoform 7 and 8, which are supported by only common queries, the internal regions are not supported by the queries. Thus, these are represented by dashed lines and blank boxes, respectively. Query 22, 25, 26 could be not included in any of the isoforms and was therefore treated as singletons.Schematic diagram of the genomic cluster, splice graph and the reconstruction and classification of transcript variants in human SCARF1 gene.

We applied the statistical analysis designed by Audic and Claverie34 to analyse the tissue specificity of all Class I transcripts and genes. We performed Fisher's exact test to assess the tissue specificity of AS events.If the P-value is <0.01, we deny the null hypothesis with 99% confidence, and the EST count in that tissue for a given gene is significantly different than the EST count in all other tissues, indicating that the gene is expressed at a higher level in that tissue.To correct significance estimates for multiple hypothesis testing, we used the false discovery rate (FDR) method of Benjamini and Yekutieli,35 which calculates a new test statistic that estimates the portion of Type I errors within a group of hypotheses meeting a significance cutoff. The FDR is the expected proportion of erroneously rejected null hypotheses among the rejected ones. The BY procedure is performed as follows. The individual P-values are sorted from smallest to largest: P(1) ≤ P(2) ≤ ⋯ ≤ P(m). Starting from the largest P-value (P(m)), P(i) is compared with a • i/m/(1/1+1/2+⋯+1/m), where α is a desired level of FDR. This is continued as long as P(i) > α • i/m/(1/1+1/2+⋯+1/m). Next, k is set as the first time P(i) ≤ α • i/m/(1/1+1/2+⋯+1/m). The hypotheses corresponding to the smallest k P-values are then declared to be significant. We set 0.01 as the desired value of α and rejected the k hypotheses with P-values less than P(k) in each evaluation of tissue specificity. The Benjamini–Yekutieli method considers the random dependence between the tests. We reasoned that the tissue specificity of the gene (or transcripts) in a particular tissue can be affected by the tissue specificities in other tissues for a given gene.2.8 GO analysisThe full list of GO terms was downloaded from the Gene Ontology Consortium, and the directed acyclic graph structure of GO was rebuilt as similar with AmiGO (Author Webpage). For each GO term, all associated child GO terms in the downstream branch nodes were gathered recursively by searching the whole GO tree structure for related entries with either an ‘is a’ or a ‘part of’ relationship. A total of 4134 GO terms were found to be associated with 9612 alternatively spliced human genes. Fisher's exact test using a 2 × 2 contingency table was applied to investigate whether there was any bias for a certain AS pattern amongst the nine AS patterns for a given GO term.36 In the table, the two columns are ‘genes with the AS pattern’ and ‘genes without the AS pattern,’ and the two rows are ‘having the GO term’ and ‘not having the GO term.’ Similarly, we carried out tests for the enrichment of specific GO terms in the group of tissue-specific genes or transcripts for each tissue. In these cases, the two columns are ‘genes (or transcripts), tissue-specific in a certain tissue’ and ‘genes (or transcripts), tissue-specific in all other tissues’, and the two rows are ‘having the GO term’ and ‘not having the GO term.’3 Results and DiscussionThe overall process and the results of each step for human are summarized in Fig. 1. The process can be divided into three main steps: (i) construction of a splice graph based on genomic alignment of mRNA/EST; (ii) reconstruction of transcript variants and AS pattern analysis from the splice graph; and (iii) statistical analysis of the tissue specificity of the genes, transcripts and AS events using the tissue categories of the supporting ESTs.3.1 Splice graph construction from the genomic alignments of mRNAs/ESTsUsing genome-based mRNA/EST mapping, we successfully localized ∼90% of mRNA/ESTs in the genome. We developed our own clustering program using genomically aligned full-length mRNA as the standard. Because our study focuses on AS analysis and forecasting of tissue-specific AS rather than on gene prediction, we conducted clustering in the genomic region with full-length mRNA mapping. Many partial mRNAs and ESTs aligned with the genome were discarded because a lack of full-length mRNA data. As a result, 178 807 (74%) mRNAs and 5 605 025 (72%) ESTs were finally incorporated into the gene clusters of the human genome. A total of 89 814 full-length mRNAs corresponded to 26 143 genes (Fig. 1). Multi-exon ESTs accounted for 58% (3 261 926) of all clustered ESTs.RS is composed of exon/intron sets and exon–exon linkage relationships. Based on the genomic structure of standard mRNA in a cluster, newly added mRNAs or ESTs were included into the RS if their alignment structures shared at least one splice site with the RS. We scored each exon and intron using our scoring rule. The exon score is an index of the confidence of the exon. We controlled the score so that the exon has a higher splice junction score when it has more supporting queries (mRNA/ESTs) and when the introns connected to the end of the exon have CSSs (GT-AG, GC-AG and AT-AC) that are more reliable. We gave differential weights to full-length mRNAs and ESTs, considering the qualitative difference in their sequences. This rule was also applied to intron scoring. Our algorithm also allowed non-CSS introns if they were supported by at least five ESTs. Exons or introns whose boundaries were within ±6 bp at both ends were merged into a single exon or intron, and its score was recalculated. The exon or intron with the best score was chosen as representative. The merging process corrects erroneous splicing that might occur during BLAT mapping or as a result of poor sequence quality of ESTs. Consequently, we were able to obtain reliable non-redundant exon/intron sets by exon/intron merging, rescoring and selection by using a cutoff score. Based on these steps, we constructed the splice graph and conducted the AS analysis.3.2 Splice graph analysisOur splice graph algorithm for detecting AS is essentially the same as previously reported.24,25 The largest differences are in (i) the application of the selection step for statistically reliable alternative linkage relationships during splice graph construction and (ii) the classification of transcript variants.If all of the alternative splices that can be obtained using erroneous EST data are allowed, one or more alternatively spliced forms could be detected for nearly all genes examined as long as they have sufficient EST coverage. Therefore, a method is needed to discriminate the true isoforms from erroneous splicing resulting from aberrant splicing or misalignment. Kan et al.33 suggested a statistical method to solve this problem, wherein alternative splices are selected according to the frequency at which they occur with a high confidence level. One example is shown in Fig. 2. There are 45 supporting queries (13 mRNAs and 32 ESTs) for the human SCARF1 (scavenger receptor Class F, member 1) gene cluster. Among 13 mRNAs queries, 12 are full-length. Seven AS events can be defined from the comparisons of their alignment structures: two alternative first exon events (E1-E3 versus E2-E3, E4-E6 versus E5-E6), complex splice site variation (E7-E13 versus E12-E13), two 3′-splice variations (E8-E10 versus E8-E11, E15-E16 versus E15-E17), intron retention (E8-E10 versus E9) and alternative last exon (E13-E15 versus E14). The seven AS events and the number of sequences supporting each isoform are summarized in Table 2. Four of them (3, 4, 5 and 7) have sufficient sequence evidence for the minor isoform relative to the major isoform. AS events 1, 2 and 6, however, have only one supporting query for each, whereas the query count for the each counterpart major isoform is much larger, yielding a low observed frequency for the minor isoform. To determine whether the significance of the observed frequency (for example, 1/33 for AS event 1) of the minor isoform is higher than the threshold (frequency of 1%) or not, we calculated P-value adopting binomial statistics. The binomial probability of each AS event was calculated based on the number of supporting queries for the isoform. As shown in Table 2, the P-value for the minor isoform of AS event 1 exceeding the given threshold (1%) was 0.282. As similar, P-values for AS events 2 and 6 show the value higher than the threshold, whereas the P-values of the other four AS events were under 0.05 (i.e. 95% confidence). Thus, these three events were excluded from the splice graph (Fig. 2B).After the selection of a reliable alternative splice set, we built the adjacency list for the directed acyclic graph and constructed all possible combinations of paths through graph traversal as described previously.24,25 Each path represents a transcript variant. By comparing the alignment structures of each transcript and its supporting queries, we subdivided the transcript isoforms as follows: Class I, all of the exons and introns in the transcript were supported by query structures; Class II, some of exons or introns were not validated; and Class III, none of the exons or introns had supporting evidence (Fig. 2C). We also calculated the total score of each transcript based on the number of supporting queries, considering the exon/intron coverage and sorted transcripts according to their scores. In the example of Fig. 2, a total of eight transcripts were constructed by graph traversal: isoforms 1–5 were Class I; 6–8 were Class II.Table 1 shows the results of the analysis of the AS and gene modelling from the graph algorithm based on genomic clustering data. In the human genome, 13 560 (66%) genes were found to have >1 transcript, and in the mouse genome, 11 752 (56%) genes were estimated to have at least one transcript. A total of 402 995 transcripts were formed, of which 97 286 (24%) in human and 33% (64 255 of 197 361) in mouse were Class I. On average, 6.5 and 5.0 isoforms were generated from one AS gene in human and mouse respectively. The AS patterns and tissue specificities of the transcripts were examined only for Class I transcripts.Statistics of the reconstructed genes and transcripts in human and mouseaThe number in parentheses indicates the percentage of genes having multiple transcripts (Class I only) of the multi-exon genes with EST support.bOnly the exons and the introns included in Class I transcripts were analysed.cAlternative exons/introns mean exons or introns that are alternatively included in Class I transcripts of the respective gene.Statistics of the reconstructed genes and transcripts in human and mouseaThe number in parentheses indicates the percentage of genes having multiple transcripts (Class I only) of the multi-exon genes with EST support.bOnly the exons and the introns included in Class I transcripts were analysed.cAlternative exons/introns mean exons or introns that are alternatively included in Class I transcripts of the respective gene.Evaluation of AS events in human SCARF1 gene by applying binomial statisticsaFor full-length mRNA queries, each was counted as two as described in Materials and Methods section.bP-value for the minor form was indicated in the condition of 1% cutoff frequency (freq = 0.01).cThis complex AS form can not be classified into any of nine AS patterns which we defined at Fig. 3.dThe AS form can be compared to more than one alternative linkage but was only compared to the major linkage with the highest score.Evaluation of AS events in human SCARF1 gene by applying binomial statisticsaFor full-length mRNA queries, each was counted as two as described in Materials and Methods section.bP-value for the minor form was indicated in the condition of 1% cutoff frequency (freq = 0.01).cThis complex AS form can not be classified into any of nine AS patterns which we defined at Fig. 3.dThe AS form can be compared to more than one alternative linkage but was only compared to the major linkage with the highest score.Given that a transcript is an output of several possible combinations of individual AS events in an individual gene, the prediction and reconstruction of transcript isoforms is another challenging problem. The simplest method is to generate all possible combinations from the graph traversal. As noted above, however, this may produce many false transcripts. Thus, we evaluated its reliability according to EST evidence, and we classified each set of transcripts into three groups. As other good measures to determine the transcript reliability, Kim et al. 25 classified the transcripts according to the minimum number of sequences required to fully encompass the transcript structure and Xing et al.26 suggested the heaviest bundling algorithm, in which a transcript with only partial alignment information is extended to the maximum length of the path with the maximum likelihood.How many genes generate multiple transcripts and how many transcripts exist in humans are very important questions that remain unanswered. Exon-junction microarray analysis shows that ∼75% of human multi-exon genes undergo AS.16 In our case, 52% of all human genes had multiple transcripts, although the percentage of AS genes increases to 66% if we consider only multi-exon genes with EST support. The percentage of AS genes is very similar to the results of other studies based on graph algorithms;13,23 however, the number of transcript variants from our study is smaller than other reported values. The low outcome is largely due to the application of strict selection criteria for the AS relationships, namely, a frequency cutoff of 0.01 (1%) with 95% statistical confidence. Without adopting the statistical selection for AS events results in >200 000 Class I transcripts and a total of ∼1 000 000 transcripts for all three classes, which is comparable to the findings of other studies in the ESTGenes, ECgene, ASG and ASD databases (Table 4). In these cases, however, the splice graph will contain many AS events with very low frequency (<0.001) and many transcripts would be generated from the splice graph. We could not guarantee the existence of these AS events in real tissues or organs. Moreover, as mentioned previously,33 if we allow all of the splice variations based on ESTs, we found that >95% of the multi-exon genes with >300 EST supports undergo AS events. The expectation that almost all genes undergo AS if there are sufficient ESTs does not seem to be reasonable. Thus, we applied a two-step selection strategy as described above. Using our strategy, we found that the percent of AS genes converged to ∼75% even though EST coverage in a gene cluster increased to >1000 (data not shown). Therefore, we suppose the Class I transcripts with small number and AS events defined in our study are the reliable sets confidently selected from all possible combinations.3.3 Detection of AS eventsFor each gene, we defined and examined nine types of AS patterns by exon–exon and exon–intron linkage analysis of Class I transcripts: cassette exon, 5′-splice site variation, 3′-splice site variation, mutually exclusive exon, multiple cassette exon, overlapping exon, composite splice site variation, intron retention and multiple intron retention (Fig. 3). In human, cassette exon was the most frequent AS event, followed by intron retention and multiple cassette exon. Table 3 summarizes the results of the nine AS patterns. Alternative exons in the defined AS patterns accounted for ∼41% of all alternative exons in our study. Characterization and investigation of more complex AS patterns would allow discovery of additional AS events.Classification of the AS patterns characterized in TISA.

Usually, ESTs are generated by single-pass sequencing of cDNA clones at both ends, resulting in relatively low coverage in the genes' internal region. Although >7.5 million human ESTs are in the public database, we could not determine whether that is sufficient for the AS detection. To overcome this problem, several approaches have been employed, including splice microarrays to detect AS,16–18 machine learning techniques such as support vector machine or hidden Markov models,19–21 and application of comparative genomics.37 Such methods can be used to detect AS in the internal regions or in the genes with little or no sequence evidence; however, ab initio prediction accompanying the machine learning technique is in a preliminary stage, so the research has so far been conducted on only a few simple AS patterns, such as cassette exon and/or intron retention. As for the splice microarray, its weakness is that the experiment is possible only for already known exon sets, and the detection range is limited to a few of simple AS events, similar to the results obtained so far with the machine learning approach. Therefore, such methods can be possible using the information obtained from EST-based analysis and can enhance the overall sensitivity of AS detection complementarily with the EST-based method.3.4 Statistical analysis of the tissue specificity of genes and transcript variantsUsing tissue information for ESTs, we have constructed digital expression profiles for each gene and transcript. From 8616 cDNA libraries, there were 7 544 537 ESTs classified into 46 human tissues. Individual ESTs were classified as normal- or cancer-derived according to their histological status. We used only ‘normal’ ESTs. If the proportion of ESTs from a specific tissue was significantly higher than that from other tissues, the gene would have a higher probability of tissue-specific expression in that tissue. In the example shown in Fig. 4, there are two possible isoforms in human TFAP2B (transcription factor AP-2 beta) gene. Among 36 supporting ESTs, 24 are common to both isoforms and 4 are singletons. For the tissue specificity of the gene in retina tissue, a 2 × 2 contingency table was constructed (Fig. 4C) and the P-value was calculated as described in the Materials and Methods. In this case, the sample gene is probably retina-specific because its P-value was much <0.01 (99% confidence level). For the other tissues, the same evaluations were performed sequentially. The contingency table of the AS event was constructed in the same way (Fig. 4D) as for retina tissue (i.e. cassette exon event in E2 and the P-value calculated using Fisher's exact test). In this case, the cassette exon event is not predicted to be retina-specific in 99% confidence level (however it is significantly retina-specific in 95% confidence level).Analysis of tissue specificity of the gene, transcripts and AS event.

The P-values calculated by Audic's method are indicated for each case. Singleton ESTs were included at tissue-counting for the gene but were excluded at counting for transcript isoforms.The tissue specificity of the transcript level is determined using essentially the same approach as the tissue specificity of the genes, although one EST could be included in both transcripts. To handle this multiple inclusion problem, we tried two different tissue-EST counting methods. If the multiple inclusion of an EST is ignored, it is possible to obtain a tissue-EST table like that shown for Case 1 in Fig. 4E. The default method is to calculate the tissue specificity as for the genes from the table (Fig. 4F, Case 1). To improve this method, we introduced a weighting factor that provides a different score for EST tissue counting (Fig. 4E, Case 2). If an EST is derived from a certain tissue and is included in n transcript isoforms, its tissue contribution is given as 1/n. The tissue count was rounded off to the nearest integer prior to the P-value calculation. In our study, we chose the Case 2 counting method for tissue-specific analysis of transcripts.By applying Audic's test and the Benjamini–Yekutieli method, we predicted 12 711 tissue-specific genes and 16 016 tissue-specific transcripts (Table 5) for the condition of FDR <0.01 and a tissue-EST count ≥3. In mouse, 15 895 genes and 19861 transcripts were predicted to be tissue-specific in 44 tissues. It should be noted that a gene or a transcript can be predicted to be tissue-specific in more than one tissue. Among tissue-specific genes and transcripts in human, 7522 genes (59%) and 11 592 transcripts (72%) were specific only to a single tissue. We have checked the conservation of tissue-specificity between orthologous human and mouse gene pair. Orthologous groups were assigned to each gene according to HomoloGene (NCBI Build48.1). Of 4965 orthologous pairs specific to a single tissue, 11.7% (584 genes) were conserved in its tissue-specificity. In particular, testis-specific genes occupied a major portion (58%) among these tissue-conserved genes (Fig. 5).Tissue- and GO term-distribution of 584 tissue-specific genes evolutionarily conserved between human and mouse.

Among these, 9612 alternatively spliced genes were assigned to 4134 GO terms and 4958 non-alternatively spliced genes were assigned to 2615 GO terms. In mouse, 16 271 genes were assigned to 4613 GO terms and 8519 alternatively spliced genes to 3770 GO terms. GO analysis was carried out to determine whether there was any functional bias of the gene groups for a certain AS pattern. For example, we examined whether the genes with a cassette exon event showed significant enrichment in any of the GO terms. By applying Fisher's exact test, we discovered the differences between the groups of the genes in the different AS types. The selection criteria for the AS pattern and GO term were as follows: GO depth in the tree structure ≥4, number of genes in a given AS pattern for a given GO term ≥10 and P-value ≤0.01. The results are listed at Table 6. Interestingly, genes involved in protein modification including phosphorylation and dephosphorylation had relatively more cassette exon events than other AS events. Also, multiple cassette exon events were substantially enriched with genes involved in apoptosis and mitosis. Mutually exclusive exon events were substantially enriched with ion transport and actin cytoskeleton genes. The genes for chromosome structure formation and modification were coupled with 5′-splice site variation. Genes involved in nucleotide metabolism were the most common in the 3′-splice site variation. For the other AS patterns, there were no significant couplings with any gene group. A previous study also reported the statistical differences in the AS types commonly arising in different tissues.38 It is interesting that there is an apparent bias in the distributions of genes between different AS patterns and tissues.Significant GO terms enriched in genes with each AS pattern in humanaBP, biological process; CC, cellular component; MF, molecular function.b‘No. genes in a given AS type’ indicates the number of genes with the specific AS pattern and assigned to a given GO term.c‘Total No. genes’ indicates the number of genes with any of the AS patterns assigned to a given GO term.Significant GO terms enriched in genes with each AS pattern in humanaBP, biological process; CC, cellular component; MF, molecular function.b‘No. genes in a given AS type’ indicates the number of genes with the specific AS pattern and assigned to a given GO term.c‘Total No. genes’ indicates the number of genes with any of the AS patterns assigned to a given GO term.Each tissue has its own characteristics, resulting in a unique biological function, morphology and physiology. These characteristics are due to the differential expressions of genes and/or transcripts. Similar to the analysis of GO terms for different AS patterns, we searched for GO terms significantly enriched within the group of tissue-specific transcripts. Significantly enriched GO terms for the group of tissue-specific transcripts in each tissue are in accordance with our previous knowledge. For example, GO terms closely related to brain functions (i.e. central nervous system development, synaptic vesicle, ion channel activity and neurotransmitter transport) were found to be enriched in brain-specific transcripts (See Supplemental Tables 1 and 2). Similar profiles were obtained for the tissue-specific genes. These results provide indirect evidence of the reliability of our approach for identifying tissue-specific genes and transcripts.In conclusion, we have presented a detailed algorithm for genome-based clustering and development of a splice graph to identify AS events and variable transcripts derived from individual genes. Our algorithm reduced the possibility of false transcript formation because we applied a scoring rule and a statistical method for the selection of valid AS sets so that only exon/intron sets and alternative linkages with sufficient evidence were selected and used to build the splice graph. We also carried out additional classification of the final transcript based on the mRNA/EST query alignment information supporting the transcript structure. We then subdivided the transcript into one of the three classes according to its reliability. We also provided statistical applications for identifying tissue-specific genes, transcripts and AS events based on EST tissue information. By adapting very conservative criteria for genomic mapping and allowing statistically significant alternative splice relationships, we identified AS information and transcript variants with fewer false positives. The GO analyses support our methodology and tissue specificity results, suggesting that we correctly identified the set of tissue-specific transcripts.Our method constitutes an integrated system and can be easily applied to other organisms for which full genome sequences are available and the number of complete mRNAs is sufficient. In this study, we applied our system to human and mouse sequences. The results obtained from this study might help clarify the complex biological nature of AS and the differential expression of transcript variants in many tissues. This can also provide information about the reliable exon sets, including potential AS exons, which can be employed in other AS detection methods, including the design of a splice microarray and a training set for the machine learning approach.This work was supported by grants (nos.

IntroductionThe legume–rhizobia symbioses lead to the formation of novel organs, termed nodules, which arise from division of cortical cells in the root and the infection of these nodules by rhizobia. Rhizobia within nodule cells differentiate to bacteroids which fix atmospheric nitrogen. Lipochitin oligosaccharides, Nod-Factors (NFs) secreted by rhizobia are responsible for nodule formation and induce a variety of responses in a host-specific manner, including root hair deformation and cortical cell division, during the early steps of nodulation. Ca2+ spiking in root hair cells is one of the most early responses to NFs.1In the past few years, the phenotypes of an increasing number of symbiotically defective mutants have been analyzed in the model legumes, Lotus japonicus and Medicago truncatula to dissect the NF signaling pathway.2–4 Several genes required for nodulation have been identified by positional cloning. L. japonicus NFR1,5,NFR56 and Medicago LYK37 encode transmembrane receptor-like serine/threonine kinases with putative extracellular regions similar to LysM domains, which are thought to be directly involved in perception of NF signal. In subsequent signal transduction, L. japonicus SYMRK,8,CASTOR and POLLUX,9,M. truncatula DMI1,10,DMI211 and DMI312, and L. japonicus CCaMK13 and Nup13314 have been identified as components required for the common symbiosis pathway shared between the fungal and bacterial endosymbiotic systems. The L. japonicus nin mutant showed normal mycorrhization and early responses following rhizobial inoculation, including root hair deformation,15 Ca2+ influx and Ca2+ spiking.16,NIN was cloned as a putative transcription factor gene and shown to be expressed during both early and late stages of nodule development, suggesting that NIN controls various developmental aspects of nodulation after the perception of rhizobia in root hairs. However, little is known about what signal component relays the signal from the common symbiotic pathway into the nodulation-specific program in L. japonicus. Recently, GRAS family genes, nodulation signaling pathway 1 (NSP1) and NSP2, have been identified as putative transcription factors functioning downstream of Ca2+ spiking and CCaMK in Medicago truncatula.17,18Here, we describe the positional cloning and characterization of nodulation-specific LjNSP2 gene encoding a plant-specific GRAS protein most similar to MtNSP2, which might lead to the induction of expression of genes required for rhizobial infection and early nodule development.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materialsThe mutant carrying Ljnsp2-1 was isolated from the EMS-mutagenesis experiments of L. japonicus Gifu B-129.3 The mutant Ljsym35 was isolated from a population of Gifu derived from a transposon-/DNA-tagging trial, as a non-tagged culture mutant,19 and was kindly provided by Prof. Jens Stougaard (Arrhus University, Denmark).2.2. Root hair deformation and assays of Ca2+ spikingSeeds of L. japonicus were germinated and grown on BNM agar medium essentially as described previously,9 except that the roots were grown between two filter papers (grade 0860; Schleicher and Schűll, UK), one of which was on the agar surface. Root hair deformation was scored as described previously following 16 h exposure to 10−8 M NF in 1 ml BNM medium in a chamber on a microscope slide. Images were taken with a digital-camera attached to an inverted microscope. Ca2+ spiking was assayed as described previously,9 following the addition of 10−8 M NF. Representative traces were selected from at least 10 independent cells.2.3. Genetic mapping population and genomic DNA isolationGenetic mapping of the LjNSP2 gene was performed with F2/F3 population derived from cross between Ljnsp2-1 (Gifu B-129) and the early flowering ecotype Miyakojima MG-2020 or Lotus burttii B-303.21 For AFLP analysis, genomic DNA was extracted from 0.1 g leaves using a Qiagen DNeasy plant kit according to the manufacture's protocol. For PCR markers analysis, DNA was extracted from one young leaf in 100 μl of PEB (200 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 250 mM NaCl, 25 mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS), precipitated with isopropanol, washed and dissolved in 100 μl of TE (pH 8.0).2.4. High efficiency genome scanning (HEGS)/AFLP or PCR-based screening of LjNSP2-inked markersGenomic DNA (100 ng) was digested with EcoRI and MseI, ligated to EcoRI- and MseI-adaptors and preamplified by using EcoRI- and MseI-adaptor primers. Preamplified DNA was prepared at 0.05 mg/μl concentration before amplification with selective primers. A bulked segregant analysis was performed to identify markers linked to LjNSP2. Bulks were constructed from preamplified DNAs of 10 recessive (Nod−) or dominant (Nod+) homozygous F2 plants, 4096 selective primer combinations of EcoRI+3/MseI+3 were screened to identify markers present only in the bulk of dominant homozygotes.Subsequently, LjNSP2-linked HEGS/AFLP markers were excised directly from polyacrylamide gels and cloned with the TOPO TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen). The cloned markers were sequenced and primers were designed by using the software Primer 3 (Whitehead Institute, Cambridge, MA). SCAR (sequence characterized amplified region) markers, which revealed polymorphism between L. japonicus accession Gifu and Miyakojima MG-20 or L. burttii, were analyzed in 2989 or 8472 F2/3 individuals from Miyakojima MG-20 or L. burttii, respectively.To facilitate the efficiency of electrophoresis of AFLP or PCR products, the HEGS system22 was adapted. In this system, a set of electrophoresis apparatus is equipped with two sets of 24.5 × 26.5 cm glass plates, each accommodating a gel with 100 lanes and analysis of 400 samples is practicable in single run. After electrophoresis, the gels were stained with Vistra Green (Amersham Biosciences) and scanned by fluorescent gel scanner (FluorImager 595; Amersham Biosciences).2.5. BAC contig developmentThree-dimensional BAC DNA pools prepared from our BAC library23 were screened with LjNSP2-linked HEGS/AFLP or SCAR markers as described above. HindIII-digested DNA from positive BACs was fractionated on an agarose gel for fingerprinting and determination of overlaps. BAC ends were sequenced using M13 reverse or forward primer and non-repetitive sequences in BAC were used for chromosome walking to screen 3-D BAC pools with PCR or AFLP. The process was repeated as needed to complete the BAC contig. Polymorphic PCR fragments in BAC sequences were analyzed to directly score recombinants in F2/F3 populations.BAC clone 188C5 containing the LjNSP2 gene was shotgun-sequenced and then annotated by Rice-GAAS (Rice Genome Automated Annotation System) (Author Webpage).2.6. Complementation experimentsFor complementation, a 6.9 kb PstI fragment, carrying only the wild-type LjNSP2 1500 bp ORF and 4486 and 899 bp of upstream and downstream sequence, respectively, was cloned into the hairy root transformation vector, which was made from pCAMBIA1300 by replacing the hygromycin-resistant gene with sGFP(S65T).24 The resulting LjNSP2 recombinant plasmid was introduced into A. rhizogenes LBA133425 by electroporation. Hairy root transformation of Ljnsp2-1 mutant was performed as described.26 The plants with transgenic hairy roots were grown in vermiculite pots and inoculated with Mesorhizobium loti TONO. GFP fluorescence and nodule formations were confirmed 4 weeks after inoculation.2.7. Southern and northern hybridizationsGenomic DNA was extracted from leaves using CTAB method27 from L. japonicus, and 2.5 μg DNA were digested by EcoRI, electrophoresed on 0.8% agarose gel and blotted to nylon membrane (Biodyne A, Pall).Twelve-day-old plants were inoculated with M. loti TONO. Infected roots at 4 days post inoculation (dpi) and nodules at 8–32 dpi were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was isolated from flower, shoot, root and nodule tissue, and 5 μg aliquots were electrophoresed by denaturing agarose gel and blotted as above.LjNSP2 probe (1322 bp) was amplified from 188C5 BAC DNA with primers 5′-ACTTCCACCACCTCATCGAC-3′ and 5′-ACAAGTCCAAAGGGATGCAG-3′, and labeled with 32P using a random primer labeling kit (Takara). Hybridization was done at 63°C in Church buffer [0.5 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 7% (w/v) SDS, 1 mM EDTA]28 and the filters were washed once in 2× SSC containing 0.5% SDS at room temperature for 10 min, and twice in 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 63°C for 15 min. The hybridized membranes were then exposed for 3 days to phosphor imaging plates (Fuji, Tokyo, Japan), which were then scanned by a phosphor imaging scanner (Storm840, Amersham Bioscience). After stripping, the same filters were reprobed with the 400 bp fragment from L. japonicus ubiquitin cDNA as a loading control.282.8. Transient expression of the LjNSP2-GFP fusion protein in onion epidermal cellsThe 1.5 kb ORF of LjNSP2 was amplified from 188C5 BAC DNA using the primers: [5′-ACGCGTCGACATGGAAATGGATATAGATTGCATCC-3′ (SalI-site underlined), 5′-CATGTCATGAATGCACAATCTGATTCTGAAGAAC-3′ (BspHI-site underlined)], digested with SalI and BspHI, and cloned into pUC18-CaMV35SΩ-sGFP(s65T)-NOS plasmid29 at the SalI/NcoI sites just upstream of GFP gene. Onion epidermal cells were bombarded with DNA-coated particles using a Biolistic PDS-1000/He Particle Delivery System (Bio-Rad).9 About 18–24 h after bombardment, the cells were observed using a Bio-Rad Radiance2000 confocal laser scanning microscope.The sequence data of LjNSP2 and genomic sequences (B-129 Gifu) of LjNSP2 have been deposited with the DDBJ data library under accession numbers AB241456 and AB241457, respectively.3. Results3.1. Early infection phenotypes of a Ljnsp2 mutantThe Ljnsp2-1 mutant of L. japonicus grew normally in nitrogen-rich compost, and established a normal symbiosis with the mycorrhizal fungus,30 but did not form nodules under nitrogen limitation when inoculated with M. loti. The addition of M. loti to Ljnsp2-1 seedlings induced no phenotypes, such as root hair curling, infection thread formation and cortical cell division, typically seen in the wild-type (data not shown). However, NF did induce swelling and branching in root hair tips, although at a reduced level compared with the wild-type (Fig. 1A and H). Cytological staining of M. loti expressing lacZ revealed no infection foci and no infection thread formation (data not shown). Intracellular Ca2+ spiking, which is induced by NF and has been proposed to be integrated by a Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase required for activation of early nodulation gene expression and mycorrhization1, was indistinguishable in the mutant from the wild-type (Fig. 1I). The observed induction of Ca2+ spiking and normal mycorrhization of the mutant indicates that the mutation in Ljnsp2 affects a nodulation-specific signaling component that is downstream of the common pathway for mycorrhizal and rhizobial symbioses.L. japonicus root hair responses induced by NF. (A–D) Root hair deformation induced with 10−8 M NF. Slight swelling and branching were observed also in Ljnsp2-1 mutant (C and D), although to a lesser extent than the wild-type (Gifu B-129; A and B).

After about 20 min from injection of the Ca2+-sensitive dye Oregon green-dextran to the root hairs, NF was added to the medium at 10−8 M. Both wild-type (upper) and the mutant (lower) responded positively for the addition of NF in 10–20 min and similar effects were observed with at least 10 independent seedlings.L. japonicus root hair responses induced by NF.

High-resolution genetic mapping of LjNSP2The mutant allele Ljnsp2-1 (Gifu B-129) was crossed to the early flowering ecotype Miyakojima MG-20. The LjNSP2 locus was mapped near translocation site of the short arm of chromosome 1.31 Since the recombination is significantly suppressed in the chromosomal segment, total of 4096 EcoRI/MseI primer combinations were examined for bulked segregant analysis on bulks 10 Nod− recessive and Nod+ dominant homozygous F2 plants in the cross of Ljnsp2-1 and Miyakojima MG-20. LjNSP2-linked AFLP markers from this screen were further analyzed in additional 2989 F2 plants with HEGS/AFLP system. Nineteen markers are located on the southern side of LjNSP2 locus at distances of 0.07 cM and seven markers on the northern side of LjNSP2 locus at distances of 0.45 cM, respectively, while nine markers cosegregated with LjNSP2 locus (Table 1, Fig. 2A). The screened markers were converted into the 11 polymorphic SCAR markers (Table 2).Positional cloning of the LjNSP2 gene (A) Genetic map of LjNSP2 region.

There were no introns in the 1 500 bp of the predicted LjNSP2 ORF.AFLP markers linked to LjNSP2 locus36 LjNSP2-linked AFLP markers were selected from 3009 F2/F3 plants in the cross of Ljnsp2-1 (Gifu B-129) and Miyakojima MG-20.aAFLP fragments were derived from Miyakojima MG-20.AFLP markers linked to LjNSP2 locus36 LjNSP2-linked AFLP markers were selected from 3009 F2/F3 plants in the cross of Ljnsp2-1 (Gifu B-129) and Miyakojima MG-20.aAFLP fragments were derived from Miyakojima MG-20.PCR-based markers linked to LjNSP2 locusPCR was performed using the indicated primer pairs with the following cycling parameter: 4 min at 94°C; 35 cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 30 s at the temperature indicated, 1 min at 72°C; 10 min at 72°C; and hold at 4°C.PCR fragments were electrophoresed on 13% acrylamide gels with HEGS system.aPCR fragments are derived from Miyakojima MG-20.bM and b indicates the polymorphism of Miyakojima MG-20 and L. burttii, respectively, compared with Gifu B-129.PCR-based markers linked to LjNSP2 locusPCR was performed using the indicated primer pairs with the following cycling parameter: 4 min at 94°C; 35 cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 30 s at the temperature indicated, 1 min at 72°C; 10 min at 72°C; and hold at 4°C.PCR fragments were electrophoresed on 13% acrylamide gels with HEGS system.aPCR fragments are derived from Miyakojima MG-20.bM and b indicates the polymorphism of Miyakojima MG-20 and L. burttii, respectively, compared with Gifu B-129.3.3. Construction of a 2 Mb physical BAC contig spanning LjNSP2At the first step, all SCAR markers were used to screen 3-D BAC DNA pools prepared from our L. japonicus Gifu BAC library. The contigs containing these SCAR markers were extended by the chromosome walking with the screening of 3-D BAC DNA pool using PCR primer combinations based on end sequences of BAC clones. In several cases, however, we could not obtain non-repetitive PCR fragments from BAC end sequences and screen BAC library. As an alternative strategy, AFLP fragments from BAC with EcoRI+1 selective and MseI+1 selective primers were searched for non-repetitive sequences of BAC inner. Subsequently, the corresponding EcoRI+3 selective and MseI+3 selective primers were used to screen 3-D BAC DNA pools with AFLP system. Finally, we constructed a ∼2 Mb physical BAC contig that spans the LjNSP2 locus (Fig. 2B).3.4. The narrowing of LjNSP2 genomic region using L. burttii as an alternative crossing partner and identification of LjNSP2 geneAs no more recombination was found from the population of this cross of Ljnsp2-1 × Miyakojima MG-20, even with new markers developed from the BAC clones in the contig, we made another cross with L. burttii.21 Among 8 472 F2 progenies from this cross, six recombination events were found between the flanking markers S26d and 183R derived from the BAC clone 188C5; this located the mutation within a 130 kb region (Fig. 2B). Among the 5 ORFs (Fig. 2C) predicted from the sequence in this region (excluding transposable elements), only one was identified as having a mutation in the mutant. A 6.9 kb fragment including this ORF complemented the mutant for nodulation in hairy roots transformed by the Agrobacterium rhizogenes carrying the cloned region (Fig. 3). No nodules were formed using empty vector, confirming that mutation of this gene caused the mutant phenotype.Complementation of Ljnsp2-1 mutant. Roots of the Ljnsp2 mutant were transformed by Agrobacterium rhizogenes strain LBA1334 carrying appropriate plasmids carrying the 1 500 bp LjNSP2 ORF and 4 486 and 899 bp of upstream and downstream sequences and a transformation indicator 35S-GFP. On inoculation with Mesorhizobium loti, the GFP-marked transformants formed nodules complementing the mutant phenotype. Scale bar: 1 mm.Complementation of Ljnsp2-1 mutant.

Scale bar: 1 mm.The ORF in this region corresponding to LjNSP2 encodes a protein belonging to the plant GRAS family of putative transcription factors32–34 and analysis of the major plant GRAS family protein sequences indicated that the closest in sequence to LjNSP2 were the M. truncatula and Pisum sativum NSP2 proteins.18 AtSCL26 of Arabidopsis was about twice distant from them, and together these proteins made an apparent subfamily of GRAS proteins (Fig. 4). However, genome sequences around the LjNSP2 and M. truncatula NSP2 revealed no clear co-linearity based on the available data.Phylogenetic tree of plant GRAS family proteins.

About 15% of the N-terminal region is divergent among most GRAS family members but that of LjNSP2 showed strong homology with the M. truncatula and Pisum sativam NSP2 proteins18 suggesting functional equivalence and that they are probably orthologs. Furthermore, LjNSP2 has a well-conserved SH2-like domain among GRAS proteins (Fig. 5B). The Ljnsp2-1 mutation causes a substitution of a conserved valine (V) to glutamate (E) in this SH2-like domain (Fig. 5C).Domain structure of the LjNSP2 protein.

DNA hybridizations detected no signal in Ljsym35 (Fig. 6A) and PCR analyses indicated that it has a deletion of >100 kb around the LjNSP2 gene; this allele was renamed Ljnsp2-2.DNA, RNA hybridization and RT–PCR analyses of LjNSP2.

Expression of LjNSP2 during nodulation and in different organsRNA hybridization showed that LjNSP2 expression was detectable in roots but not in shoots and flowers (Fig. 6B), in contrast to the ubiquitously expressed Medicago NSP2.18,LjNSP2 was also expressed in infected roots at 4 dpi and early nodules but strongly suppressed in matured nodules (Fig. 6C). These expression patterns of LjNSP2 are similar to that of the putative Nod factor receptor kinase genes, NFR15 and NFR5,6 and the signal transduction components CASTOR, although the decrease in expression of the latter was slight.9 This contrasts with the expression patterns of the genes encoding the nodulation signaling pathway components M. truncatula NSP1,17,M. truncatula NSP218 and L. japonicus NIN15(Fig. 6A) whose expression increased following inoculation.3.6. Expression of NIN and LjENOD40-1 genes in Ljnsp2-2 mutantIn the Ljnsp2-2 null mutant, RT–PCR revealed that even before inoculation with M. loti the expression levels of early nodulation genes, NIN and LjENOD40-1, were both <40% of the wild-type (Fig. 7A and B). Upon inoculation of the wild-type with M. loti, NIN and LjENOD40-1 increased by up to 65- or 3.5-fold, respectively. In contrast, the levels of NIN and LjENOD40-1 transcripts in the Ljnsp2-2 mutant remained low after inoculation reaching only about 5–20% of wild-type levels (Fig. 7A and B). This demonstrates that LjNSP2 function is required, directly or indirectly, for either the expression and/or the induction of these early nodulins.RT–PCR analyses of expression of LjNSP2 and the early nodulins. (A and B) RT–PCR analysis of the change of expression of NIN (A) and LjENOD40-1 (B) after M. loti inoculation, in wild-type and Ljnsp2.

DPI: days post inoculation.3.7. Nuclear localization of LjNSP2 in onion cellsAlthough most GRAS family proteins have a putative nuclear localization sequence (NLS)34, PSORT II analysis did not identify an NLS-like sequence in LjNSP2. However, LjNSP2-GFP fusion delivered into onion (Allium cepa) epidermal cells by particle bombardment revealed it to be exclusively localized in nuclei, although not in nucleoli (Fig. 8A). The mutation in the SH-2-like domain reduced nuclear localization of Ljnsp2-1-GFP and fluorescence in the cytoplasm became noticeable in at least 30 GFP-expressed cells (Fig. 8B), but not as strong as seen with GFP alone (Fig. 8C). These observations are consistent with LjNSP2 acting as a transcription factor, and the SH2-like domain facilitating its nuclear localization.Nuclear localization of the LjNSP2-GFP. LjNSP2-GFP (A), Ljnsp2-1-GFP (B) fusion genes and control GFP gene (C), delivered by particle bombardment, were transiently expressed in onion epidermal cells and observed with a laser confocal microscope 24 h after bombardment. The nuclear localization of the Ljnsp2-1 mutant gene product is significantly suppressed compared with LjNSP2. Scale: 10 μm.Nuclear localization of the LjNSP2-GFP.

Scale: 10 μm.The above LjNSP2-GFP fusion under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter or the LjNSP2 promoter containing a 5.1 kb fragment of the 5′ flanking sequence was constructed and introduced into Ljnsp2-2 mutants. These constructs complemented the Ljnsp2-2 mutant phenotype, indicating that this fusion protein retained the LjNSP2 activity for nodulation. However, the transgenic roots showed no detectable GFP fluorescence (data not shown).4. DiscussionSo far the only described nodulation-specific mutants of L. japonicus, which completely lack nodules but have normal mycorrhization, are Ljnsp2, nfr1,5,nfr56 and nin.15 One key difference among these mutants is the induction of Ca2+ spiking, which might be required for the early common response in activation of the symbioses with both rhizobia and mycorrhizal fungi. The Ljnsp2 mutants are normal for Ca2+ spiking but the nfr1 and nfr5 mutants are blocked. Recently, NFR1 and NFR5 were shown to encode LysM-receptor-like-kinases, that were predicted to function in NF perception.5,6 NIN functions downstream of LjNSP2 as indicated in this study. It is possible that LjNSP2 is earliest known protein executing nodulation-specific gene expression from Ca2+ spiking induced through NFR1 and NFR5 in L. japonicus.We have established a ∼2 Mb physical BAC contig that spans the LjNSP2 locus (Fig. 2B). However, LjNSP2 region was only closed to the minimum of 14 BAC clones even in the population of 3 009 F2/F3 plants of the cross with Miyakojima MG-20. This corresponds to 24 Mb/cM, ∼78-fold greater than the average physical to genetic distance found in our high-density map of the L. japonicus (Wang et al., manuscript in preparation). This indicates that recombination in the chromosomal segment near the translocation site is highly suppressed in the cross combination of Gifu B-129 × Miyakojima MG-20. Therefore, we changed the crossing partner from Miyakojima MG-20 to L. burttii.21 As a result, LjNSP2 region narrowed up to 130 kb in one BAC clone (188C5) using the population of 8 472 F2 plants of the cross with L. burttii, indicating that L. burttii is significantly useful as alternative crossing partner of Gifu especially near the translocation site of chromosome 1.LjNSP2 encodes a GRAS family protein of a putative transcription factor. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that LjNSP2 is most closely related to M. truncatula NSP2 and P. sativum NSP2.18 The comparison of the mutant phenotypes suggests that the LjNSP2, MtNSP2 and PsNSP2 genes function at similar or parallel positions in the nodulation signal transduction. However, the expression pattern is different between LjNSP2 and M. truncatula NSP2. LjNSP2 is predominantly expressed in roots and its expression decreases in developed nodules. The expression of M. truncatula NSP2 is observed in shoots as well as roots and is induced after rhizobial inoculation. These results suggest that, in contrast with a possible role for M. truncatula NSP2 in another organ development in addition to nodulation, LjNSP2 seems to be specialized in nodule initiation.The expression of NIN and ENOD40 is induced rapidly after rhizobial inoculation and NF-treatment. The NIN transcripts are detected in different tissues during various nodule stages, such as the dividing cells of the nodule primordia and the nodule vascular bundles. The Ljnin mutants are nodulation-minus and blocked in both the infection thread formation and the cortical cell division.15,ENOD40 is induced in the root pericycle a few hours after rhizobial inoculation, and subsequently in the dividing cortical cells of the root and nodule primordia.36–38,ENOD40 RNAi knock-down lines39 or the possible co-suppression40 suppressed nodule primordium formation, resulting in very poor nodulation. Despite of their function in nodule initiation, however, little is known about what kinds of transcription factors in the root activate NIN and ENOD40 gene expression in response to rhizobia. In this study, we demonstrate that the induction of NIN and LjENOD40-1 gene expression is clearly cancelled by the Ljnsp2 mutation (Fig. 7). On the basis of these findings, we speculate that LjNSP2 may function as a transcriptional activator to directly or indirectly switch on the NIN and LjENOD40-1 gene expression in nodule initiation. In order to address this issue, identification of the promoter region and subsequent binding assay using LjNSP2 protein would be of great importance in future.Kaló et al.18 reported that M. truncatula NSP2-GFP localizes in the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear envelope and re-localizes into the nucleus rapidly after NF-treatment. In this case, they made a functional C-terminal GFP fusion under control of the constitutive CaMV 35S promoter that was introduced in Medicago nsp2 mutant plants. Here, we attempted to detect LjNSP2-GFP, -YFP or -DsRED2 fusion in L. japonicus hairy roots. These fusions could complement the mutant phenotype but no fluorescence was detected even under the control of CaMV35S promoter. In place of L. japonicus we delivered LjNSP2-GFP fusion into onion epidermal cells by particle bombardment. The fusion exclusively localizes in the nucleus but not in the nuclear envelope. Although there is no way to explain the peculiar difference of subcellular localization of NSP2 between Medicago and onion, putative nucleoporins such as NUP13314 and NUP85 (Saito et al. unpublished data) required for rhizobial and arbuscular mycorrhizal symbioses may retain the NSP2 putative transcription factor in the nuclear envelope of M. truncatula. Most recently, Heckmann et al. reported that non-nodulating mutant, SL781-3, carrying an allele of LjNSP2 was found by TILLING.41We thank Prof. Jens Stougaard for kind providing the mutant seeds of Ljsym35.

IntroductionParkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative movement disorders.1 Approximately 1% of the population older than 65 years suffers from this slowly progressive neurodegenerative disorder.2 The disease is clinically characterized by impaired motor function, manifested by resting tremors, rigidity, bradykinesia and postural instability.3 The primary pathological changes associated with PD include the degeneration of pigmented neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) pars compacta of the brain which results in a decrease in dopamine availability.4 In addition, the important feature of PD is the presence of Lewy bodies in the affected brain areas.1The etiology of PD is diverse and complex. Several mutations that lead to familial PD have been described. Ten distinct loci, including α-synuclein (PARK1), Parkin (PARK2), DJ-1 (PARK7) and PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK, alternatively PARK6), have been reported to be responsible for rare Mendelian forms of PD,2,5 whereas the etiology of sporadic PD, occurring in 95% of the cases of PD, is not fully understood. Several studies, including genetic analyses, finding of environmental factors and new experimental models of PD have provided new information on the pathogenesis of PD.2,6–9 In addition, several pathologic and genetic animal models have been employed in an attempt to develop an understanding of both the pathophysiology and potential neuroprotective therapeutics for PD. Neurotoxins such as 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropiridine (MPTP), N,N′-dimethyl-4-4′-bipiridinium (paraquate) and rotenone, which induce dopaminergic neurodegeneration, have been used in the generation of PD animal models. The MPTP model induces pathologies that are similar to those seen in humans and is thus the most widely studied.3,6The application of global approaches such as collecting expressed sequence tags (ESTs), the serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) and microarray techniques have been shown to be very useful in the analysis of complex biological phenomena, including certain human diseases.10–14 Ryu et al.15 reported that the expression profiles of genes are changed as the result of 6-OHDA treatment of PC12 cells using SAGE. In addition, the gene expression profiles for human parkinsonian SN using oligonucleotide arrays16,17 and the expression profiles of genes induced by oxidative stress in a nigral DA cell line using a cDNA microarray18 have been reported. Furthermore, a wide spectrum of molecular events prior to dopaminergic neurodegeneration in MPTP mice model have also been reported.19,20 However, global gene expression studies of PD using ESTs analysis have not been reported. The ESTs generated by the single-pass sequencing of cDNA clones that were randomly selected from cDNA libraries have been used to in the identification of novel genes,10 and the differential and quantitative analysis of expression patterns21 as well as the evaluation of gene expression profiles in a specific tissue.10,21,22To identify genes related to PD by examining their expression profiles, we collected a large number of genes expressed in human normal SN and human PD's SN. In particular, we applied a strategy for obtaining full-length cDNAs, since these clones are a valuable resource for the functional study of genes. As a first step, we constructed two full-length and two normalized cDNA libraries23 from human normal SN and PD's SN. Using the EST frequency mainly obtained from the full-length libraries, the expression profile of the genes expressed in human normal SN and PD's SN was analyzed and genes that are differentially expressed between them were selected. The expression levels of these selected genes were also confirmed in human SN tissues as well as MPTP mice model and the cell death activity of these genes was also examined. These newly identified genes represent potentially useful targets for elucidating the molecular mechanisms associated with PD.2. Materials and methods2.1. RNA preparationsTotal RNAs were obtained from commercial sources or from tissues from the Human Brain and Spinal Fluid Resource Center (HBSFRC). Total RNAs from human SN tissues were extracted using a commercially available RNA isolation kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following the procedures recommended by the manufacturer. Information relative to the three normal human SN total RNAs is as follows; Cat#6866 (Ambion, USA), male caucasian 81 years of age, died of congestive heart failure and negative for HIV 1, HIV 2, HBV and HCV; HSB#3482 (HBSFRC), female 79 years of age, diagnosed with coronary artery disease, and the hippocampus shows no evidence of degenerative disease or global hypoxia; HSB#3484 (HBSFRC), male 72 years of age, diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pulmonary emphysema, and negative for neurodegenerative disease or other neuropathology. Information on the three human PD SN total RNAs is as follows; Cat#6288 (Ambion, USA), male caucasian 60 years of age, diagnosed with PD, died from a gun shot wound, and negative for HIV 1/2, HBV and HCV; Cat#B6288 (Ambion, USA), male caucasian 81 years of age, diagnosed with PD, negative for HIV 1/2, HBV and HCV, and the cause of death was unknown; HSB#3642 (HBSFRC), female 83 years of age, diagnosed with PD and Dementia (MID). No evidence of other causes of dementia (e.g. Alzheimer). Total RNAs of mouse SN were extracted from the SN of the constructed MPTP mice model (see ‘Construction of MPTP mice model’ in Materials and methods) using same method.2.2. Construction of cDNA library and DNA sequencingThe full-length cDNA library was constructed using an improved capping method with the pCNS-D2 vector.23 Plasmid DNAs were extracted from clones that were randomly selected in the constructed cDNA libraries by using a MWG plasmidprep 96 (MWG Biotech., Ebersberg, Germany). Sequencing of the DNAs was performed using previously described procedures.11 A normalized cDNA library was also constructed to obtain genes that are rarely expressed by the previous method.242.3. Bioinformatic analysis of ESTsAnalysis of the collected ESTs with a bioinformatic tool was performed according to previously described procedures.11 The annotation of ‘high quality’ SN ESTs were carried out using the human mRNA subset extracted from the GenBank database and the UniGene database (Hs.seq.all, build #164) for similarity comparisons using BLASTN. For protein similarity assessment, a comparison was performed against the non-redundant protein database using BLASTX.2.4. Gene expression analysisThe frequency of each gene was analyzed by dividing the number of ESTs of a gene by the number of total clones merged into the UniGene database build #164 in each full-length cDNA library. Genes that were abundantly expressed in each library are selected and are listed among the ESTs. Significant differences in gene expression between the datasets were calculated using a previously described method.25 Analysis of expressional differences between the normal full-length SN library and the PD full-length SN library was performed at a cut-off probability of 0.9. The gene list was sorted according to the gene frequency in the library of the overexpressing gene. In addition, an analysis for the chromosomal location of the selected genes was performed.2.5. Construction of MPTP mice modelAll procedures using the mouse model were carried out in accordance with the NIH Guidance for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, KRIBB. C57Bl/6 male mice (10 weeks; 25 g) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Canada), and maintained on a 12 h day–night cycle. Food and water were given ad libitum under standard animal care conditions. On Day 10, sample groups (n = 3 per sample) were injected (intraperitoneal) with 200 μl of PBS containing three different dosages of MPTP (5 mg, 10 mg and 25 mg MPTP/kg, Sigma, MO, USA) for 5 days at 1 day intervals, whereas the control group (n = 3) was injected with 200 μl of PBS. On Day 15, the mice were decapitated and the brains removed quickly and frozen in isopentane (−40°C). The SN region of the brain was used for the preparation of the total RNA.2.6. Quantitative real-time RT–PCRReverse transcription (RT) was performed with 5 μg of the total RNA using the same procedures as previously described.11 To validate the expression level of the selected genes, PCR was performed using the 1st cDNAs as templates and a specific primer set for each gene (Table 1). The amplification was carried out using Exicycler version 2 (Bioneer Co., Korea) in a 10 μl reaction mixture containing 4 μl of diluted DNA template, 2 pmol of each primer and 5 μl of 2× SYBR® Premix Ex Taq™ (TaKaRa Biotechnology Co., Ltd) including a dNTP mixture and Mg2+, under the following conditions: 95°C for 5 min, followed by 45 cycles at 95°C for 30 s, at 55°C for 30 s, at 72°C for 30 s. The tyrosine hydrolase (TH) gene was used as a positive control for PD and the reaction of each sample was performed in triplicate. A melting curve and the melting temperature for each sample were calculated using the procedures recommended by the manufacturer. The relative quantification of gene expression was analyzed by the 2-ddCt method. The transcriptional activity of each gene was calculated as relative amounts, such as PD versus normal groups in human tissues and MPTP groups versus the control group in MPTP mice tissues, and then presented as the relative fold expression change (log base 2), after normalization against B2M expression (for human samples) or actin expression (for mice samples). The standard deviations and standard errors were also calculated.Primer sequences for quantitative real time RT–PCRPrimer sequences for quantitative real time RT–PCR2.7. ImmunohistochemistryFor immunohistochemistry, the fixed tissues were embedded in paraffin. Coronal sections (3 μm thick) of mouse brains were collected along the rostrocaudal extent of the brain from the bregma 2.92 to −3.80 μl.26 After deparaffinization and antigen retrieval by a pressure cooker in 10 mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) at full power for 4 min, tissue sections were treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 min. Immunostaining for monoclonal mouse of TH (1:50 dilution, Novocastra, UK) was performed using the mouse EnVision kit (Dako, Carpinteria, CA, USA). The primary antibody was incubated for 30 min followed by incubation with the mouse EnVision reagent for 30 min. The slides were then sequentially incubated with DAB chromogen for 5 min, counterstained with Meyer's hematoxylin and mounted. Immunofluorescence staining for monoclonal mouse alpha-tubulin which detects TUBA3 and TUBA6 was performed using Cy2-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin. The primary antibody (1:400 dilution, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) was incubated overnight at 4°C and then labeled with Cy2-conjugated immunoglobulin (1:200 dilution, Jackson ImmunoResearch, PA, USA) for 30 min. Cy2-labeled sections were analyzed by confocal microscopy using a Fluoview FV500 instrument (Olympus, Japan).2.8. Cell death activity assayHuman neuroblastoma cell line, SH-SY5Y (ATCC, CRL-2266) were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). For transfection, the cells were subcultured at a density of 2 × 104 cells in 24-well plates for 1 day. Transient transfection was performed with the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. In each well, 200 ng of each plasmid DNA and 50 ng of pDsRed2-Mito plasmid DNA, a mitochondria marker gene (BD Biosciences Clontech, USA), were cotransfected into the cells. The human Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl plasmid DNAs were used as a positive control for retarding cell death, and pcDNA-HA plasmid DNA acted as a negative control. After 24 h of transfection, cell death was induced by the administration of 1 mM MPTP in each well for 24 h as previously described procedure.27 Cell death was then evaluated by observation under an inverted microscope (Nikon, Eclipse TS-100, Japan) equipped with a fluorescence observation device (Nikon, C-SHG, Japan) based on the morphology and RFP pattern of pDsRed2-Mito-positive cells using a previously described method with minor modifications.28 All experiments were performed in triplicate.3. Results3.1. Large-scale ESTs collection from human SN tissuesTwo full-length and two normalized cDNA libraries were constructed from normal and PD human SN tissues. A total of 6528 clones were randomly selected from these 4 libraries and used for 5′ end single-pass sequencing. The sequences obtained were subjected to quality control procedures, namely trimming of the vector region and the removal of low-quality or short (<100 bp) sequences. Finally, 6067 high-quality ESTs with an average read length of 500 bp were collected (Table 2). After screening out 220 ESTs derived from mitochondrial DNAs, ribosomal DNAs and human repetitive sequences, the remaining 5847 sequences were submitted to the NCBI dbEST database. When all of our ESTs were annotated by coalescing into human UniGene clusters (Build #164), they were assembled into 2878 clusters. Most were ESTs coding a known gene having an identity of at least 95% with human Refseq or mRNA. These annotated results were used in an analysis of the subsequent expression profiles.Summary of cDNA librariesaF, Full-length; F/N, Full-length/Normalized.bNumber of clones and clusters in NCBI UniGene build #164 contributed by our EST sequences.Summary of cDNA librariesaF, Full-length; F/N, Full-length/Normalized.bNumber of clones and clusters in NCBI UniGene build #164 contributed by our EST sequences.3.2. Identification of PD-related genesTo identify candidate genes related to PD, we selected genes that showed a significant difference (P > 0.9) between the two full-length cDNA libraries. As shown in Fig. 1, we found 38 upregulated genes and 38 downregulated genes specifically in the PD's SN library.Genes showing significant difference (P a > 0.9) in expression between normal and PD' SN.Genes showing significant difference (P a > 0.9) in expression between normal and PD' SN.Among the upregulated genes in PD, significant differences were observed in gene groups associated with central nervous system development (MBP and Golli-MBP), protein modification and catabolism (UBB, PSMC1, RNF10 and RNF5), signal transduction (STMN1, GNAS, BCR and HMP19), iron ion transport (FTL and FTH1), glycolysis pathway (LDHB, MDH1, PGK1 and LDHA), protein synthesis (RPL3, EIF4A2, RPS3A, RPL17, RPS4X and FRSB), lipid metabolism (APOD and ELOVL1) and metabolite detoxification (HMOX2). Although the MBP gene was relatively abundant in the normal library, the frequency of this gene in the PD library was significantly higher than in normal library.In the case of downregulated genes in PD, significant differences were observed in gene groups related to microtube-based movement (K-ALPHA-1, TUBA6, MGC8685 and TUBA3), protein synthesis (EEF1A1, RPL15, RPL13, EIF3S2 and RPL31), immune response (SPP1, CD74, ACT, HLA-DRB3 and ARHGDIB), transport (ATP6V1E1, TMP21, AP1S2, AQP4, CSE1L, JWA and COPE), protein folding (TEBP, DNAJB6 and PFDN1), proteolysis and peptidolysis (SMT3H1 and CAPN3) and nerve–nerve synaptic transmission (KIF1B).3.3. Verification of PD-related genes in SN tissues from human PD and MPTP mice model using quantitative real-time RT–PCRTo validate the upregulated and downregulated genes in PD selected from ESTs frequency data, we randomly selected 15 upregulated genes and 11 downregulated genes from the PD's SN library and real-time RT–PCR was performed on human SN tissues of three normal and three PD. As shown in Fig. 2A (I), all of the upregulated genes in human PD's SN tissues were highly expressed in human PD's SN tissues compared to normal SN tissues. On the other hand, many of the downregulated genes as well as the TH gene, which is a dopaminergic neuron specific marker, were expressed at low levels in PD, and showed high expression levels in normal SN tissues. Among the tested genes, 20 genes (77%) were upregulated or downregulated at a statistically significant level in more than one sample. These results show that the transcriptional levels of the selected genes, as evidenced by real-time RT–PCR, are almost consistent with the ESTs frequency data for all genes. In addition, to obtain more PD-related genes, genes showing slight frequency differences between the two normalized libraries from the SN of the human PD and normal tissues, six upregulated genes of EIF3S5, SNRPN, KIAA1276, PTK6, ST13 and DJ462O23.2, and two downregulated genes of HNRPC and EIF3S2 were selected and their expression levels were confirmed using real-time RT–PCR. As shown in Fig. 2A (II), the real-time RT–PCR data were almost consistent with the EST frequency data. This indicates that genes showing a slight difference between the normalized libraries actually might be present at highly different levels in between original libraries or cells.Quantitative real-time RT–PCR of upregulated or downregulated genes randomly selected from the libraries of human normal SN and PD's SN.

To validate the genes confirmed in human SN tissues, the expression level of these genes was also confirmed in SN tissues from three types of mice models which were injected with various concentrations of MPTP (5, 10 and 25 mg/kg weight). The upregulated or downregulated genes in these mice model were assigned to genes which were upregulated or downregulated in over two to three samples. As shown in Fig. 2B (b), when the confirmation for the constructed MPTP mice model was performed using the TH gene, the real-time RT–PCR data showed that the expression of the TH gene was decreased in MPTP mice model. In addition, Fig. 2B shows that of 21 genes are upregulated in human SN, 9 genes (43%), Golli-MBP, FTL, PBP, GNAS, RPS3A, EIF3S5, PTK9, ST13 and DJ462O23.2, are highly expressed in SN tissues of MPTP mice which is in agreement with the data from human tissues. On the other hand, 8 of 13 downexpressed genes (62%), SPP1, CD74, ACT, RPL13A, TUBA6, AQP4, TUBA3 and HNRPC were expressed at lower levels in SN tissues of MPTP mice. These results indicate that gene expression in human PD is about 50% in agreement with that for the MPTP mice model.3.4. Verification of protein levels for selected genes using immunohistochemistryTo verify the protein levels of the genes that were confirmed by quantitative real-time RT–PCR, an immunohistochemical analysis was performed in the MPTP mice model. PBP, SPP1 and alpha-tubulin (TUBA) including TUBA6 and TUBA3 were selected as target genes for PD, because their antibodies were available.The immunohistochemical data for the TH protein, a dopaminergic neuron marker, clearly showed that the TH protein in the coronal sections of mouse brains were detected at very low levels compared to their controls (Fig. 3A). With the quantitative real-time RT–PCR data for TH gene, the results indicated that dopaminergic neurons in the SN of the PD model by MPTP treatment had degenerated. As shown in Fig. 3B, TUBA protein including TUBA6 and TUBA3, which is downregulated in human PD tissues and tissues of PD mice model using quantitative real-time RT–PCR, was decreased in the SN region of MPTP-treated mouse brains compared to the SN region of control mouse. On the other hand, PBP and SPP1 proteins were not detected in the SN region of either control mice or MPTP mice in our study. This is thought to be due to the low reactivity of antibodies against PBP and SPP1. These results indicate that a decrease in mRNA levels for target genes such as TUBA6 and TUBA3 in PD are coupled to the corresponding protein levels, although TUBA antibody can not specifically detect TUBA6 and TUBA3, respectively. In addition, these results suggest that the selected target genes represent possible candidates for markers for the identification of PD.Immunohistochemical staining for TH and alpha-tubulin in the SN of an MPTP mice model. Immunoreactivity for TH and alpha-tubulin was markedly decreased in MPTP mice model (b) compared to control mice (a).

Identification of the genes having cell death activity from selected genesThe neurodegeneration associated with PD is known to be related many apoptotic events including ROS generation, caspase activation and DNA fragmentation. Alterations in certain apoptotic cell death-related molecules during MPTP-induced dopaminergic degeneration have also been reported. To identify genes having cell death activity from the target genes obtained, the cell death activity of 34 genes which were confirmed by quantitative real-time RT–PCR analysis was examined.Fig. 4A shows that, of the upregulated genes, four genes such as MBP, PBP, GNAS and PAQR6 were associated with the acceleration in cell death compared to the control gene, pcDNA-HA. On the other hand, four downregulated genes, SPP1, ARHGDIB, TUBA3 and TUBA6, were found to retard cell death. Among them, SPP1, ARHGDIB and TUBA3 had a cell death activity with a statistically significant level compared to the control gene (P < 0.05). In particular, SPP1 and TUBA3 had a high anti-apoptotic activity, similar to those of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl which are known as anti-apoptotic genes (Fig. 4B). The remaining genes had no activity related to cell death (data not shown). These results indicate that genes related to cell death exist in genes which are differentially expressed between human normal SN and PD's SN. In particular, genes which accelerate cell death were highly present in the upregulated genes, whereas genes which retard cell death were present in downregulated genes.Cell death activity of differentially expressed genes in PD.

DiscussionA global gene expression analysis profile extracted from an ESTs database has been reported to provide important clues for our understanding of the development of human disease and has led to improvements in our ability to predict its clinical behavior.29 However, a comprehensive analysis of ESTs in human PD has not been reported. In order to investigate genes that are associated with human PD, we undertook the large-scale sequencing of cDNA libraries of human SN tissues from normal and PD, and examined the difference in gene expression profiles between them by an EST frequency analysis. The expression levels of selected genes were confirmed in the MPTP mice model as well as in human PD tissues using quantitative real-time RT–PCR in order to overcome the shortage of human PD tissues. Among them, a number of obtained genes were shown to be novel genes which are not reported to be related to PD or not involved in pathways related to PD. Of these genes, some represented the pro- or anti-apoptotic activity related to neuronal cell death in PD.The profile of our gene expression between human SN tissues of three normal and three PD showed that genes involved in the central nerve system development, Golli-MBP and MBP, were increased in PD's SN. Among them, which are known as structural constituents of the myelin sheath, MBP was recently reported to be upregulated in PD's SN.30 The expression of the Golli protein was also reported to be increased by activated microglia during neuroinflammation.31,32 From these reports, it is likely that the upregulation of Golli-MBP and MBP in PD's SN is due to the activation of microglia by dopaminergic cell death. In addition, defects in ubiquitination and proteasomal protein handling are reported to be common features of PD and other chronic neurodegenerative disease such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's disease and in ageing.5,16,30,33 These defects have been known to lead to the impairment of several cellular processes that are linked to ubiquitination such as the cell cycle, signaling pathways and the degradation of normal and damaged intracellular proteins.16,33 These reports were consistent with our results that genes, which are involved in protein modification and catabolism such as UBB, RNF5 and ST13 and in signaling transduction such as GNAS, were upregulated in PD. UBB is reported to be immunopositive in the Lewy body of PD1 and alteration in this gene led to the failure of ubiquitination, finally resulting in cell death and neurological disease.16,34 In addition, some genes that are involved in iron ion transport, FTL and FTH1, were also increased in PD, which is in agreement with other reports of an increase in the case of a 6-OHDA treated cellular PD model15 and in normal individuals within the age at onset of PD.35 This result supports the previous report that an abnormal accumulation of iron in SN is a prominent pathological feature of PD.36 Many genes that are involved in glycolysis such as MDH1 and LDHA were also highly expressed in PD's SN. Ryu et al.15 reported that genes such as G6PD, HK2, PFK-C, PKM2, LDHA and COX8A were upregulated in a 6-OHDA treated cellular PD model. As suggested by Ryu et al., the upregulation of glycolysis genes is thought to compensate for a decrease in ATP production as the result of mitochondria dysfunction in PD.17 Furthermore, the upregulation of some genes involved in protein synthesis, EIF4A2, RPS3A, RPL17 and EIF3S5, were also in agreement with a previous report that genes involved in protein synthesis such as EIF4G1, EIF4EBP2 and RPL36 were highly up-expressed in PD SN.16 Among them, RPL17 is known to be upregulated in multiple sclerosis (MS).37 Genes such as TPT1, PBP, VIM, THY1, HMOX2 and PAQR6 were also upregulated in PD, but their relation to PD has not yet been reported, although HMOX1, an isozyme of HMOX2, is known to have the capacity to promote neurodegeneration through the pathological deposition of free iron.On the other hand, many genes for proteins that participate in protein folding, protein transport, and proteolysis and peptidolysis were downregulated in PD's SN. These data support a previous report that genes related to protein degradation were downregulated in PD.17,18 This is also in agreement with previous findings that protein misfolding can lead to the accumulation of protein aggregates and confer toxic properties on cells in PD and AD.38,39 In addition, our data revealed that genes which are involved in the immune response such as SPP1, CD74, ACT and ARHGDIB are particularly downregulated in PD. SPP1 was reported to be upregulated in several types of cancer and MS,37 but its involvement in PD has not yet been reported. ACT was reported to be useful as a screening marker for Alzheimer-type dementia40 and a polymorphism in this gene was found in PD patients.41 In addition, tubulin genes such as TUBA6, K-ALPHA-1, MGC8685 and TUBA3, which were involved in microtube-based movement, were downregulated in our data. The decrease of tubulin genes were also reported in dopaminergic cell by oxidative stress18 and in human PD's SN.16,30 In our data, genes that are related to protein synthesis such as RPL15 and RPL13 were also downregulated in PD's SN. However, protein synthesis related genes such as EIF4A2, RPS3A and RPL17 were shown to upregulated in PD's SN. These data indicate that they might have a different function in PD, although they belong to the same protein synthesis category. In addition, BBOX1, HNRPC and AQP4 were downregulated in PD. AQP4 was found to be upregulated in brain injuries and tumors42 but, downregulated in human muscles with neurogenic atrophy.43The administration of MPTP to mice is one of the most common animal models used in PD studies. When the expression level of PD candidate genes selected from human PD were checked in MPTP mice model, it coincided with about 50% between human SN and the MPTP mice model. These difference due to the MPTP mouse model compared to human PD showed subchronic progress, no formation of the Lewy body which is a pathological hallmark of human PD,6 and did not directly address the involvement of systemic mitochondrial impairment in PD.9 Among the selected genes, the downexpression of TUBA6 and TUBA3 genes in PD was also detected by its protein level using immunohistochemistry, although a decrease in each protein was specifically not detected. These results indicate that the downregulation of TUBA6 and TUBA3 genes couples transcription to translation. In addition, genes related to cell death were identified from some of the selected target genes. In particular, MBP, PBP, GNAS and PAQR6, which are upregulated in PD, were shown to have activity with accelerating cell death. Among them, it was reported that PBP, also known as RKIP, may represent a novel effector of signal transduction pathways leading to apoptosis.44 On the other hand, SPP1 and TUBA3, both of which are downregulated in PD, have activity with retarding cell death. SPP1 was reported to be an anti-apoptosis molecule by ISS (inferred by sequence similarity) in Gene Ontology. These data indicate that our target genes might be a candidate related to apoptotic events that induce neuronal cell death in SN region.The gene expression profile from our study partially supports a previous hypothesis for PD that iron transport proteins which are upregulated in PD, FTL and FTH1, affect the iron redox status and then contribute to protein misfolding and aggregation in ageing, leading to disease affected brains. Such protein misfolding and aggregation were linked to an increase in protein modification proteins, UBB and ST13, and a decrease in proteins that are involved in protein folding, proteolysis and peptidolysis. In addition, the observed elevation of HMOX2 also accelerated neurodegeneration through the deposition of free iron. In addition to this hypothesis, since a number of genes involved in central nervous system development, glycolysis, protein synthesis and immune response as well as genes related to apoptotic events were shown to be related to PD, a more complex mechanism including neuroprotective response as well as neuronal death appears to be involved in PD.To examine the tissue specificity of the PD-related genes, the expression levels of our selected genes were analyzed using a public database (UniGene database build #181) and our internal ESTs databases including mainly brain, stomach, and liver ESTs. The results revealed that most of the upregulated genes have a high expression frequency in PD compared to other tissue sources including brain tumors, and most of the downregulated genes have a high frequency in normal individual (data not shown). In particular, upregulated genes such as MBP, Golli-MBP, UBB, TPT1, PBP, EIF4A2, THY1, MDH1, PAQR6, EIF3S5, KIAA1276, PTK9 and DJ462O23.2 were shown to be highly present in PD's SN tissues, while downregulated genes such as SPP1, BBOX1, RPL15, TMP21, RPL13A, AQP4 and EIF3S2 were present in normal brain SN. These results indicate that our selected PD candidate genes are specifically expressed in PD's SN compared to other tissues.The PD candidate genes newly identified in our study showed a high relation to PD in the data for transcript and protein levels in the MPTP-mice model, for cell death activity in a human neuroblastoma cell line, and for the expression analysis on a public database. These PD candidate genes should provide valuable resources for developing an understanding of the molecular mechanism associated with PD in the SN of the brain and for discovering potential diagnostic/therapeutic markers for PD, although the transcript level in the SN of PD patients as well as MPTP mouse model reflect alterations in gene expression in not only neurons but also astroglia and microglia, because the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the SN of PD accompany robust astrogliosis and microglial reactions.We wish to express our appreciation for the gift of human SN tissue (HSB#3482, HSB#3484 and HSB#36 42) specimens from the Human Brain and Spinal Fluid Resource Center, VA West Los Angeles Healthcare Center, LA, CA 90073, which is sponsored by NINDS/NIMH, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, and the Department of Veterans Affairs.
