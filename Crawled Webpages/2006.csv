"," The first volume of DNA Research was published in 1994, and since then, it has been published as a leading journal in the field. The online version of the journal was launched in 2000. From its launch, the online journal has been freely accessible to all readers without charge. Though thorough analysis has not been performed to confirm causality, with stringent peer review for high quality papers and a full-sponsored free online access, the journal has received much attention, and articles in the journal have attracted much citation. As we have become the top impact factor journal in Japan, our next goal is to become recognized internationally. In order to achieve this goal, the Editorial Board and I have decided that it is necessary to publish with an international publisher who can help us to further develop the journal. I here gladly announce that we have decided to publish with Oxford University Press.As part of our collaboration with Oxford University Press, I am introducing several changes in journal policy and functionality.Open Access ModelFirst, I have decided that as of the first issue of 2006 the journal will move to an Open Access model, a model where authors will be charged for publication in the journal in order to continue free access for all readers, and to increase the journal functionality and dissemination. Authors will be charged $500 for publishing an article in the journal. This Open Access charge is in addition to any normal colour charges that might apply. However, in order to encourage growth of research in developing countries, waivers are applied to authors from such countries that are listed in OUP's qualifying countries. An additional waiver is available for articles which the Editorial Board recommend as being of particularly high importance. Interested authors should contact the Editor in charge of his/her paper.Online Version at HighWire Press Though I regret having to introduce an extra author charge, this new author charge will enable continued access to all readers, while introducing many improvements. One of the biggest change, which has already been implemented in 2005, is the relaunch of the online journal on HighWire Press at Author Webpage . HighWire Press is a reknown platform hosting many high quality journals, and I believe that sharing such a platform will increase the visibility of DNA Research . Old issues have already been relocated to this site and are available as pdf files. Recent issues, starting with Volume 12 issue 3, now include a HTML version with added functionality. The journal is now registered in CrossRef, and references are linked to cited articles, and forward links will be created between new articles citing the relevant article. Authors will be able to keep track of how many times a citation is made on his or her article, and see how many times the article is downloaded. Moreover, Advanced Access is introduced, where accepted articles will be published online before the issue is published in print. The average time from acceptance to online publication will be greatly reduced.Online Submission and Peer Review The journal is also planning the implementation of an online submission system in Spring, 2006. This will facilitate easy submission, and global peer review in a shorter time span. I hope that international authors will consider DNA Research as their choice of submission.  I am grateful to the Editors for their increased support during this important time of change, and ask for their continued help in the further growth and success of DNA Research . "

IntroductionEscherichia coli is a constituent of normal microflora in intestinal tracts, but certain types of E. coli strains are associated with diseases in human and animals.1,2 Among these pathogenic E. coli strains, enterohemorrhagic E. coli O157 not only causes large outbreaks of hemorrhagic colitis but also numerous small outbreaks and sporadic cases, and is regarded as one of the major worldwide public health concerns.3 The genome sequence determination of an O157 strain, RIMD 0509952 (referred to as O157 Sakai) and the genomic comparison with a nonpathogenic strain, K-12 MG1655,4,5 have revealed that the O157 chromosome is comprised of a 4.1 Mb backbone common with K-12 and a total of 1.4 Mb strain-specific sequences. O157 Sakai-specific sequences (referred to as S-loops) are inserted at various sites on the chromosome backbone, and encode more than 1600 of O157 Sakai-specific genes. Of importance is that most of the large S-loops are prophages and prophage-like elements. We have identified 18 prophages (Sp1-18) and 6 prophage-like elements (SpLE1-6). They comprise about two thirds of the O157 Sakai-specific sequences and have carried many virulence-related genes including Shiga toxin (Stx) genes (stx1 and stx2) into O157. This suggested that acquisition of these bacteriophages have played the key roles in the emergence of O157.5,6 Similar findings were also obtained by the genome sequencing analysis of another O157 strain, EDL933.7More recently, we analyzed, based on the genome sequence of O157 Sakai, the whole genome structures of eight O157 strains that displayed diverse XbaI-digestion patterns by a systematic PCR analysis called Whole Genome PCR Scanning (WGPScanning).8 In this analysis, we amplified the whole genome of each strain using 560 pairs of PCR primers, and searched for genomic segments with any structural differences by comparing each PCR product with that from O157 Sakai. This analysis provided the first genome-wide view on the genomic diversity of O157, and revealed that there is an unexpectedly high degree of diversity among O157 strains. In particular, the variation in prophages and prophage-related elements were remarkable, implying that their variability is the major factor generating such structural diversity. However, additional information on the gene level is required.In this study, we constructed an oligoDNA microarray according to the genome sequence of O157 Sakai. We first validated the accuracy of the comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analysis using this oligoarray by a test experiment with K-12 and O157 Sakai, and then performed a gene composition analysis of O157 using the same set of strains examined by the WGPScanning. We further made a fine comparison of the microarray data with WGPScanning data to understand the genomic diversity of O157 more in detail.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Bacterial strains, growth condition and DNA extractionEight O157 strains examined in this study were 980938 (referred to as #2), 980706 (#3), 990281 (#4), 980551 (#5), 990570 (#6), 981456 (#7), 982243 (#8) and 981795 (#9). They were human isolates obtained in Japan in 1998 as described previously.8 All were negative for Sorbitol fermentation (SOR-) and ß-glucuronidase activity (GUD-) whose activities were examined after 24 h incubation at 37°C on SIB II agar plates (Kyokuto Pharmaceutical Industrial, Tokyo, Japan) and on ES Colimark agar plate (Eiken Kizai, Tokyo, Japan), respectively. As for strain #2, however, a weak positive reaction for ß-glucuronidase was detected after 40 h incubation. O157 Sakai (RIMD 0509952) was used as the reference in all hybridization experiments. This strain was isolated in a large outbreak in Sakai city, Japan, which occurred in 1996, and has been sequenced by our group.5 The strain is available at the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC BAA-460). Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 was kindly provided by Dr H. Mori (Nara Institute of Science and Technology). Cells were grown to the stationary phase at 37°C in Luria–Bertani medium. Genomic DNA was purified using the Genomic-tip 100/G and Genomic DNA buffer set (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instruction.2.2. Design of the O157 Sakai microarrayOligonucleotide probes were prepared for all the protein-coding genes on the O157 Sakai genome (5447 genes in total). Principles for the probe design were 60 mer in length and two probes for each gene. However, O157 Sakai contains 542 repeated genes, most of which are derived from IS elements or 13 lambda-like prophages sharing various length of DNA segments with almost identical sequences. As for these repeated genes, we prepared a single probe for each repeated gene family. Such probes totaled to 151 probes, each having two or more targets of =90% sequence identity on the O157 Sakai genome (referred to as ‘multiple hit probes’). As for the singleton genes (4905 genes), we were able to design two different 60 mer probes for 4173 genes, but only one 60 mer probe for 725 genes and one 44 or 45 mer probes for 7 genes. In total, 9620 probes were synthesized (Sigma-Aldrich Japan, Tokyo, Japan), and each probe was spotted onto poly-l-Lysine-coated glass slides (SD10011; Matsunami Glass Ind., Osaka, Japan) using SPBIO (Hitachi Software Engineering, Tokyo, Japan). As the negative controls, we included 20 oligonucleotides prepared from 10 yeast genes. Probe sequences are shown in Supplementary Table 1 available at Author Webpage.2.3. DNA labeling and hybridizationGenomic DNAs from test strains and the reference (O157 Sakai) were fluorescently labeled with Cy3 and Cy5, respectively, according to the following protocol. First, 3 µg of genomic DNA was labeled with aminoallyl-modified dUTP (Sigma) using the Bioprime DNA Labeling System (Invitrogen). DNAs were not sheared or digested by restriction enzymes prior to the labeling. The aminoallyl-labeled DNA was purified by Microcon YM-30 (Millipore), dried in a speed-vac and resuspended in 10 µl of 50 mM NaHCO3. After adding 10 µl of dimethyl sulfoxide solution containing Cy3 or Cy5 monofunctional reactive dye (Amersham), the sample was incubated at room temperature in the dark for 1 h to allow the dye to couple with DNA. The fluorescently labeled DNA was finally purified by the Qiaquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) into 30 µl elution buffer provided by the manufacturer.The Cy5-labeled and the Cy3-labeled DNA preparations (15 µl for each) were mixed with a 90 µl hybridization solution containing 6.4× SSC, 0.64% SDS and 1.3 mg/ml yeast tRNA. After incubation at 96°C for 2 min, the denatured sample was applied to a microarray slide and incubated on an ArrayBooster hybridization apparatus (Advalytix AG, Brunnthal, Germany) at 50°C for 16 h. The slide was then washed twice in 2× SSC/0.2% SDS at room temperature for 10 min, twice in 0.2× SSC/0.2% SDS at 50°C for 5 min and twice in 0.2× SSC at room temperature for 10 min. Finally, the slide was briefly rinsed with ethanol, dried by centrifugation and scanned with a FLA-8000 scanner (Fuji Photofilm, Tokyo, Japan). The obtained data were analyzed by the ArrayVision 8.0 software (Imaging Research). Each strain was examined twice with the labeled DNAs prepared independently for each hybridyzation.2.4. Data analysisIn our experimental condition, signal intensities from the negative controls were almost the same as that of the local background (LBG) in both cannels. Thus, spots with reference signal intensities lower than the LBG plus 5 SD or with some spotting abnormalities were categorized as ‘low quality’ (LQ). Signal intensities of other spots were corrected by subtracting the LBG, and were subjected to the ‘presence (P) or absence (A)’ determination using the array-based genotyping software GACK capable of dynamically generating cutoffs for present/absent (conserved/divergent) gene analysis in each array hybridization based on the signal-ratio distribution of un-normalized data sets.9 Since we performed two independent experiments for each strain, some probes yielded inconsistent results; P/A, P/LQ or A/LQ. In these cases, the probe was categorized as ‘uncertain’ (U), P or A, respectively.Finally, the presence or absence of each gene was determined according to the data from each spot. Because most genes were represented by two different probes on our microarray, inconsistent results could also be obtained from the two probes. In such cases, the gene was categorized as P when the judgments of two probes were P/U or P/LQ, as A when they were A/U or A/LQ, and as U when they were P/A or U/LQ. Processed data sets were displayed in the genomic order using the TREEVIEW program.10 Raw signal intensities from each spot and processed data are presented in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 available at Author Webpage, respectively.The presence or absence of 37 genes, which were always categorized into LQ on the current version of O157 Sakai microarray, were determined by PCR. The PCR amplification was performed using the Ex Taq PCR kit (TAKARA Bio, Japan) and 10 ng of template DNA with 30 cycles of 20 s at 98°C/30 s at 60°C/30 (or 120) s at 72°C. The list of genes analyzed by PCR and the primer sequences are shown in Supplementary Table 3 available at Author Webpage.3. Results3.1. Evaluation of the sensitivity and specificity of CGH analysis using the O157 Sakai oligoDNA microarrayThe array we constructed covered all of the 5447 protein-coding genes on the O157 Sakai genome; 3729 on the chromosome backbone, 1632 on S-loops, and 86 on pO157 and pOSAK1 plasmids.11 Before applying the microarray to the CGH analysis of O157 strains, we evaluated its sensitivity and specificity using K-12 MG1655 as a test strain.We first examined the sequence identities of each probe to the K-12 genome sequence by the FASTA program, and classified the probes into two groups; those with =90% identity into ‘Conserved in K-12’ (CK) probes and others into ‘Specific to Sakai’ (SS) probes. Each gene was then classified into CK, ‘Partially Conserved in K-12’ (PCK; genes represented by a CK probe and an SS probe), or SS genes according to the probe category (Supplementary Table 1). Next, the data of the microarray analysis were compared with those from the in silico analysis. In this comparison, repeated gene families, represented by ‘multiple hit probes’ having two or more targets of =90% sequence identity on the O157 Sakai genome, were analyzed separately from the singleton genes.As for the singleton genes, 96.9% of CK genes were correctly judged as ‘present’, and 97.8% of SS genes as ‘absent’ (Table 1). Most of the K-12 genes that gave incorrect results (false negative, false positive and uncertain) contained slightly divergent target sequences with 3–6 base mismatches with CK probes or weak homologies to the SS probes (70–90% identity). On the other hand, the presence/absence determination of the repeated gene families conserved in K-12 was somewhat problematic. While all families with the copy number ratio of >0.5 were judged as ‘present’, many families with the copy number ratios of =0.5 were judged as ‘absent’ or ‘uncertain’. This indicates that the repeated genes judged as ‘absent’ by the microarray analysis include those actually absent and those with reduced copy numbers. Thus, in the following CGH analyses of O157 strains, we decided to categorize such repeated genes into ‘uncertain due to the multiple target sequences in O157 Sakai’ [U(M)] and to consider only the repeated genes judged as ‘present’ as having the same or similar (or higher) copy numbers in the test strain.Summary of the CGH analysis of K-12 MG1655 using the O157 Sakai oligoDNA microarraya‘dSeq’ stands for the divergent sequence with 3–6 base mismatch, ‘wHom’ for the weak homology of 70–90% identiity, and ‘c.n.r.’ for the copy number ratio (MG1655/O157 Sakai).bThese 37 genes were always categorized into the LQ (low quality) group because of weak signal intensity. Their presence or absence in O157 strains was determind by PCR.cEach repeated gene family was represented by a single probe in the O157 Sakai oligoDNA microarray.Summary of the CGH analysis of K-12 MG1655 using the O157 Sakai oligoDNA microarraya‘dSeq’ stands for the divergent sequence with 3–6 base mismatch, ‘wHom’ for the weak homology of 70–90% identiity, and ‘c.n.r.’ for the copy number ratio (MG1655/O157 Sakai).bThese 37 genes were always categorized into the LQ (low quality) group because of weak signal intensity.

Overview of the gene content analysis of O157 strainsUsing the O157 Sakai microarray, we analyzed the gene content of eight O157 strains that were previously analyzed by the WGPScanning method.8 The data are summarized in Fig. 1 and Tables 2 and 3. As shown in Table 2, all the singleton genes identified in O157 Sakai were shared by at least one strain, but as many as 431 genes displayed variable distributions (or highly divergent sequences). Most of these ‘variably absent or present genes’ (referred to as VAP genes) belonged to the SS genes; 389 of the 1153 SS singleton genes were variably present. As shown in Fig. 1, these genes appeared very frequently on prophages and prophage-like elements; among the 640 singleton genes on these genetic elements, 350 (54.7%) displayed variable distributions. In sharp contrast, CK singleton genes exhibited a high level of conservation; only 1% (37 genes) exhibited variable distributions (Table 2). Among these, 20 genes were again located on prophage regions shared by O157 and K-12. In particular, a region of Sp10 (corresponding to a part of the Rac prophage in K-12) contained 11 VAP genes. These included recE and recT genes (ECs1933 and ECs1934) involved in the RecA-independent recombination and double-strand break repair.12The summary and data comparison of the microarray analysis and the WGPScanning analysis of the same set of O157 strains. Results from the gene composition analysis of eight O157 strains (strains #2–#9) using the O157 Sakai microarray are shown in the upper parts, and those from the genome structure analysis using the WGPScanning method in the lower parts. In the three rows above the microarray data, genes conserved and partially conserved in K-12 are indicated in green and pink, respectively (the first row), genes on prophages, prophage-like elements and plasmids in red (the second row), and repeated genes represented by multiple hit probes in black (the third row). Genes judged as present and absent in the microarray analysis are indicated in blue and yellow, respectively. Singleton and repeated genes that were classified as ‘uncertain’ are indicated in pink and gray, respectively. Results from the WGPScaning analysis are presented as follows. The segments of the same sizes as those from O157 Sakai are indicated in gray, and those with larger (=2 kb) and smaller (<2 kb) size reductions in yellow and light yellow, respectively. The segments with larger (=2 kb) and smaller (<2 kb) size increments are indicated in blue and light blue, respectively, and those that were not amplified in red. Prophages or prophage-like elements of O157 Sakai that were deleted (or translocated or not integrated) in some test strains are left blank, and their alternative integration sites so far identified are also indicated. In this figure, each segment is not drawn to scale but to the gene position in the data presentation of the microarray analysis. The data presented here are the most update version, thus several modifications have been made from the original version published previously.8The summary and data comparison of the microarray analysis and the WGPScanning analysis of the same set of O157 strains.

This pattern well correlated with the level of structural diversification observed in the WGPScanning analysis (Fig. 1, and also refer to Ref. 23). Most of the repeated gene families identified in O157 Sakai were also conserved (present in the same or similar copy number) in strains #3, #5, #8 and #9. These data suggest that the four strains are more closely related to O157 Sakai in terms of gene content and genome structure.3.3. O157 Sakai-specific genes with variable distributions in O157Classification of the SS genes according to their functions revealed that genes belonging to specific categories contained more VAP genes compared to other categories (Table 4). The abundance of VAP genes in ‘transcription’, ‘replication, recombination, and repair’, ‘genes with unknown or uncharacterized functions’ and ‘unclassified genes’ was remarkable. This appears to be a reflection of the fact that most VAP genes are on prophages or prophage-like elements, which contain many genes for transcriptional regulation, replication, repair and phage-specific functions as well as a number of uncharacterized genes.Categorization and conservation of SS genes in the eight O157 strainsaGenes that were absent at least in one strain.bOnly the singleton genes were analyzed.cGenes on the chromosome were classified according to the COG database.Categorization and conservation of SS genes in the eight O157 strainsaGenes that were absent at least in one strain.bOnly the singleton genes were analyzed.cGenes on the chromosome were classified according to the COG database.A notable finding was that 16 virulence-related genes exhibited variable distributions (Table 5). They included genes for Stx1, an HmwA-like protein, a TraT-homologue, a HecB-like protein. HmwA is known to be involved in adhesion in Haemophilus influenzae,13 TraT in serum resistance in enteric bacteria14 and HecB in hemolysin activation in Neisseria meningitides.15 One strain lacked the efa-1 gene which is involved in the adherence of non-O157 EHEC to cultured epithelial cells16 and in the inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation and proinflammatory cytokine synthesis in EPEC (called lifA in EPEC).17 In O157, the efa-1 gene is split into two genes (ECs3860 and 3861), but it has been reported that disruption of ECs3860 (efa-1') results in reduced expression and secretion of LEE (the locus of enterocyte effacement)-encoded proteins and in reduced adherence to cultured cells.18 The pchD and pchE genes encoding PerC-like regulators were also missing in four strains and one strain, respectively. Since the other pch genes (pchA, pchB and pchC) have been shown to regulate the LEE gene expression,19pchD and pchE may be involved in the regulation of virulence-related genes as well.Virulence-related genes that were variably present among the eight O157 strainsVirulence-related genes that were variably present among the eight O157 strainsMore importantly, several genes encoding type III secretion system (TTSS) effectors exhibited variable distributions. Recently, several proteins encoded on the non-LEE loci have been identified as effectors secreted by the LEE-encoded TTSS (non-LEE encoded effectors) in EPEC, EHEC and Citrobactor rodentium.20–25 O157 Sakai contains at least 19 non-LEE encoded effectors or their homologues. Among these, nleA (also named espI, ECs1812), an nleF-homologue (ECs1815), an nleG-homologue (ECs1828) and an nleH-homologue (ECs1814) were variably present among the eight O157 strains. Functions of these effectors have not been well elucidated, but it has been shown that NleA/EspI injected into the host cell localizes to the Golgi apparatus.24Many virulence-related genes were also encoded on the pO157 plasmid, but all were conserved except for katP (pO157_76). Of interest was that 18 out of the 83 genes on pO157 were missing in Strain #2 (Fig. 1). Since the pO157 plasmid of #2 is almost the same in size as those from other strains (data not shown), several parts of the plasmid have probably been replaced by different or highly divergent sequences. pOSAK1, a small cryptic plasmid, was present only in two strains.3.4. Comparison of two datasets obtained by microarray and WGPScanning analysesThe CGH analysis using microarray provides the information on the gene composition but not their genomic positions, thus translocation events specific to the test strain cannot be detected. It also provides no information on strain-specific insertions. Conversely, WGPScanning detects possible loci where such genetic events have taken place while the presence or absence of each gene cannot be determined. Therefore, in order to know more details on the genomic diversity of O157, we compared the two datasets, one from the present microarray analysis and the other from the previous WGPScanning8 (Fig. 1).In the segments that exhibited no size variation in the WGPScanning analysis (indicated in gray in Fig. 1), no deletion of genes was detected by microarray except for only five segments. This confirmed that these regions possess the same genomic structures as those in Sakai. Among the five segments where deletions of a gene(s) were observed, four were derived from lambda-like prophage regions, implying that some parts of these prophages have been replaced by DNA fragments with same sizes but with different or highly divergent sequences.By the WGPScanning analysis, a total of 35 segments with larger size reduction (=2 kb smaller than that of O157 Sakai) were identified from the 8 O157 strains (indicated in yellow in Fig. 1). In most cases (29 segments), deleted genes were identified. The regions with gene deletion, however, were often associated with repeated genes derived from IS elements or lambda-like prophages, and thus precise boundaries of the deletion events were not defined in many cases. In six segments, no apparent gene deletion was detected, indicating that several genes on these segments have probably translocated to other genomic loci.Among the 60 segments with smaller size reduction (<2 kb), which were indicated in light yellow in Fig. 1, we detected deletion of a gene(s) only in seven segments by the microarray analysis. Most of the segments with undetectable deletions (50 out of 53) contained IS elements and/or parts of lambda-like prophages, indicating that small deletions involving these elements frequently occur on O157 genomes. In the remaining three segments, small deletions in the regions that were not represented by probes or some translocations have probably taken place.Besides the above-mentioned genomic segments that apparently contain deletions, 20 loci have been identified by the WGPScanning analysis, where prophages or prophage-like elements are integrated in Sakai but deleted (or not integrated) in some other strains (indicated by blank in Fig. 1). These loci were classified into three groups according to the patterns of gene conservation observed in the microarray analysis. The first group included the Sp7 region of strain #2, Sp13 (P2-like phage) of strains #3 and #9, and Sp18 (Mu-like phage) of strains #2, #3, #5, #6, #7, #8 and #9. In these regions, all or nearly all genes were absent. We concluded that these genetic elements are completely missing in these strains. The second group included the Sp18 region of strain #4 and SpLE1 of strain #6. In both cases, most genes on the elements were conserved, indicating that a prophage or prophage-like element almost identical to Sp18 or SpLE1 is present in other locus. We have already identified alternative integration sites for each element (Fig. 1). The third group included the Sp5 region of strains #2, #3, #4, #6, #7 and #8, Sp1/Sp2 of strain #8 and Sp7 of strain #3. In these regions, genes were partially conserved, exhibiting mosaic conservation patterns. This indicates that these strains contain, in some other loci, prophages which are significantly diverged but with some structural similarity to Sp5, Sp1/Sp2 or Sp7. Of particular interest was Sp5, the Stx2 phage of O157 Sakai. The Sp5 region was one of the regions with the highest level of variation, and we have already identified the alternative integration sites for the Stx2 phages in these six strains (Fig. 1). These Stx2 phages are thus different from Sp5 not only in the integration site but also in the genomic structure.A total of 83 segments yielded PCR products larger than those of Sakai in the WGPScanning analysis as shown in Fig. 1, where the segments with larger increments (=2 kb) are indicated in blue, and those with smaller increments (<2 kb) in light blue. These segments must contain some insertions. In addition, as many as 120 segments were not amplified by PCR (indicated in red in Fig. 1), in which large insertions or some other types of large genomic rearrangements likely have taken place. In these cases, if all genes on a segment were conserved, the segment most likely contains a simple insertion. By comparing the two datasets, 66 such segments were identified. Among these, we have identified seven new phage integration sites including those for Stx1 and Stx2 phages (Fig. 1). In other cases, more complicated genetic events must have occurred.3.5. Unusual signal reductions around the IS insertion sitesDuring the data comparison of microarray and WGPScanning analysis, we noticed that somewhat unusual signal reductions occurred in the ETT2 region. In strains #2, #4 and #7, the region yielded larger PCR products, but a block of genes were judged as absent in the microarray analysis. Sequencing analyses of these regions, however, indicated that all genes were completely conserved but one copy of ISEc8 was newly inserted in each strain. A closer inspection of the microarray data revealed that, although the ISEc8 insertion sites were different between the strains, the genes judged as absent were all located in the 2–4 kb regions surrounding each ISEc8, and that their signal ratios were just slightly lower than the cutoff value (Fig. 2). This phenomenon was specific to the ETT2 region, and observed even after the labeled DNA was fragmented by sonication. Although we do not know the mechanism underlying this phenomenon, some caution is required to interpret the microarray data when a block of genes exhibit a moderate level of signal reduction.Unusual signal reduction associated with insertions of ISEc8. Distribution of signal ratios (relative to O157 Sakai) from the probes representing the ETT2 regions of strains #2, #4, #7 and #8 is shown. Genes in the ETT2 region (ECs3703–3737) are depicted by black arrows, and genes on ISEc8 newly inserted in strains #2, #4 and #7 by gray arrows. Positions of each gene and probe are drawn to the O157 Sakai genome sequence. Horizontal broken lines indicate cutoff lines for the presence or absence determination in each strain. We have confirmed that all the probe sequences exhibiting unusual signal reduction are identical to those of Sakai. As seen in strain #8, no signal reduction was observed in other strains without ISEc8-insertion.Unusual signal reduction associated with insertions of ISEc8.

DiscussionPresence of an unexpectedly high degree of structural diversity in O157 genomes has been revealed by our previous analysis using the WGPScanning method.8 The results also suggested that the major factor generating such diversity is the variation of prophages and prophage-like elements. However, it remained to be elucidated how the genomic diversity detected by WGPScanning affects the gene content of each strain. In order to know the variation of their gene composition, we constructed an oligoDNA microarray according to the genome sequence of O157 Sakai,10 and performed the CGH analysis of the same set of O157 strains as examined by the WGPScanning.By this analysis, we identified 431 VAP genes that were variably present in the 8 O157 strains, and found that most of them were on S-loops, particularly on the prophage regions. This indicates that a remarkable level of variation in the gene repertoire exist among the O157 strains, and confirms the role of bacteriophages as the key players in the genome diversification of O157. Very recently, Wick et al.26 have reported the results of CGH analyses of several types of O157 strains and its close relatives, including typical O157:H7 strains (GUD-, SOR-), atypical O157:H7 strains (GUD+, SOR-), O157:H- German clones (GUD+, SOR+) and O55:H7 strains (the closest relatives of O157:H727). They used a multigenome array containing 50 mer oligonucleotide probes that target 6176 ORFs on the chromosomes of K-12, O157 EDL933 and O157 Sakai. By this analysis, they identified the Sakai and K-12 genes that were gained or lost during the emergence of O157:H7 from its O55:H7-like ancestor. Many of these genes were parts of prophages and prophage-like elements, suggesting complex histories of these elements during the evolution of O15726. What we should emphasize here is, however, that all O157 strains but strain #2 examined in our present study belonged to the typical O157 group. Even if the 89 genes that were absent only in strain #2 were excluded, 350 genes still exhibited variable distribution. This indicates that there is a remarkable variation in gene content even among typical O157 strains.Identification of these VAP genes is of medical importance in that they could be used as valuable genetic markers to discriminate O157 strains. For example, a mini-DNA chip featuring these genes would become a useful molecular tool for epidemiological studies of O157. Of more importance may be that the VAP genes include a considerable number of virulence-related genes. Although the variation of stx1 and stx2 genes among O157 strains is known, additional 14 potentially virulence-related genes were found to display variable distributions. They include four non-LEE TTSS effectors, indicating that, although the LEE locus encoding the TTS machinery is highly conserved, the repertoire of its effectors differs significantly among O157 strains. Some metabolic genes, such as those for urease production (ECs1321–1326) and iron acquisition (ECs1693–1699), which may be indirectly involved in the pathogenesis of O157, were also found to be variably present. These data raise a possibility that some variation in the potential virulence and infectivity exists among O157 strains, and we need to analyze more O157 strains from various sources, including environmental isolates.The phylogenetic position of strain #2 in the O157 lineage is somewhat obscure. But, since weak ß-glucuronidase activity was detected after long cultivation, the strain may belong to the GUD+ O157:H7 group. The largest number of VAP genes was detected in this strain, and it shared many, if not all, features that Wick et al.26 described as being specific to GUD+ strains. For example, several gene blocks, such as ECs4134–4139, ECs1611–1619 and ECs3860–3861, were deleted (or highly divergent) only in this strain. The gene content on the pO157 plasmid of strain #2 also differed significantly from other strains. Unfortunately Wick et al.26 did not examine the pO157 genes, but the difference in pO157 may be another genomic feature that discriminates the GUD+ group from typical O157 : H7 strains.In the present study, we examined the same set of O157 strains as that were analyzed previously by the WGPScanning method. This provided a good opportunity to compare the data obtained by the two methods (Fig. 1). Although the microarray is now widely used as a major tool in comparative genomics, a fine comparison of the two datasets rather highlighted the weakness of microarray and emphasized the usefulness of a combinational approach with WGPScanning. Microarray actually provided valuable genome-wide information on the genome composition in each test strain, but almost no information on strain-specific insertions and translocations. In the case of O157, particular cautions are required in interpreting the microarray data because of the presence of same or very similar prophages as well as many IS elements. Even with such difficulties, all simple insertions as well as many translocations and replacements have been identified by comparing the two datasets. This approach also identified many small deletions that could not be detected by microarray alone. IS elements were frequently associated with such small deletions, suggesting that IS elements may be another key player to diversify O157 genomes. The combinational use of microarray and WGPScanning overcame the weakness of each method alone, and provided us more details and thus a much complex view on the genomic diversity of O157 strains.The variation of prophages among O157 strains was not fully illustrated even with this combinational approach. But, as most strikingly shown for the Stx2-transducing phages, the data clearly indicated that prophages of O157 exhibit an extremely high level of strain-to-strain variations. These variations appeared to have been generated not only by simple insertion, deletion or translocation of prophages but also by more complex genetic events involving local recombination and deletion of prophage segments. One such example has been documented by Shaikh and Tarr28 in the prophages integrated into the yehV locus (corresponding to Sp15, the Stx1-transducing phage of O157 Sakai). Of importance again is that most of the strains examined here were typical O157 : H7 strains. This indicates that such dynamic turnover of prophages is still actively taking place, and as we have proposed previously, O157 strains are functioning as a kind of ‘phage factory’, releasing a variety of new recombinant bacteriophages into the environment.6 This process should be significantly involved in the generation of variable gene contents of O157 strains detected by the CGH analysis.This work was supported by Research for the Future Program funded by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS-RFTF00L01411), Grant-in-Aids for Scientific Research on Priority Areas and the 21st Century COE (Centers of Excellence) Program (Life Science) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan and a grant from the Yakult Foundation.

IntroductionChlamydiae are obligate intracellular eubacterial pathogens, including two genera and nine species based on ribosomal RNA gene sequences.1 The genus Chlamydia includes a human conjunctivitis and sexually transmitted disease agent, C. trachomatis, a mouse pneumonia agent, Chlamydia muridarum and a pig pneumonia agent, Chlamydia suis. The other genus, Chlamydophila, includes a human pneumonia agent, C. pneumoniae and the animal disease or zoonosis agents, Chlamydophila psittaci, Chlamydophila caviae, Chlamydophila pecorum, Chlamydophila abortus and Chlamydophila felis, which infect birds, hamsters, cows, sheep and cats, respectively. The genomic DNA sequences of Chlamydiaceae have been published for five species, C. trachomatis,2,C. muridarum,3,C. pneumoniae,3–5,C. caviae,6 and C. abortus.7Chlamydophila felis strain Fe/C-56, of which the whole genome DNA sequence has been determined in this study, is a frequent cause of infection in cats, largely causing conjunctivitis8 as well as pneumonitis.9 Seroepidemiological studies have shown that C. felis is widely spread among cats with prevalence rates of anti-C. felis Fe/Pn1 antibody in ˜50% of street cats and ˜20% of domestic cats and in 1.7% of the general human population and 8.8% of veterinarians in small animal clinics in Japan.10 Although C. felis is a common pathogen in both humans and animals, the infection is rarely identified in humans.11,12 Seroepidemiological data reveals, however, that the infection in humans may be more frequent and are most likely acquired from infected cats.10,13 This suggests that the feline chlamydiosis is widely transmitted to humans when in close contact with infected cats, but it rarely causes any serious illness in humans. In contrast, infection of a taxonomically close chlamydial species, C. pneumoniae, is very frequent in human and is sometimes associated with a serious illness. Moreover, at extremely high frequencies of detection and culturing from atherosclerotic plaques, C. pneumoniae is suspected to involve the development of atherosclerosis.14 The C. felis genome sequence and the comparative analysis with other chlamydial species will be of importance to investigate the genes relating to their pathogenicity in humans, tropisms in hosts and disease prevention as well as the evolution and intracellular parasitism.Herein, we determined the complete sequence of C. felis genome and present the comparative analyses with other Chlamydia genome DNA sequences, especially to that of C. pneumoniae.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Strain and culturingChlamydophila felis Japanese strain Fe/C-56 was originally isolated from conjunctival mucus of an infected 5-year-old female cat.8 The genomic DNA for sequencing was prepared from C. felis elementary bodies in the culture medium of the fourth passage with McCoy cells, following five passages with fertile hens' eggs. Chlamydial culturing and detection were performed as described previously.15 The nomenclature Chlamydophila felis is in dispute, but it is used here instead of the formerly used ‘a cat pneumonitis agent of Chlamydia psittaci’.12.2. DNA sequencing, assembling and gene predictionThe DNA sequencing was performed by a method using the whole genome shotgun.16 The total 24 194 sequence reads gave an 11-fold coverage as average. The sequences were assembled and edited using the Phred/Phrap/Consed package software (University of Washington).17 Protein-coding genes were first predicted using the combination of three programs, GenomeGambler,18 GeneHacker plus19 and Glimmer2.0,20 and at last manually determined. Annotation for each genes was carried out by using programs BLASTP21 and FASTA322 against the non-redundant protein database. Transmembrane protein and tRNA genes were predicted using SOSUI23 and tRNAscan-SE,24 respectively. Putative inc genes werepredicted by informatics analysis using hydropathy.25,262.3. Data analysisC. pneumoniae J138 genomic DNA sequence4 was used for intra-genus comparative analyses. Genomic DNA sequences of other C. pneumoniae strains,3,5,C. trachomatis2 and C. muridarum3 were used for inter-genera comparisons. C. caviae6 and C. abortus7 were used for analysis within evolutionarily closed species. The gene annotation was performed by homology search using FASTA3,22 in which the similarity with the expectation values <10-4 was defined significant. Two genes conserved most reciprocally in two different organisms were assigned as orthologous genes using FASTA3. Classification of C. felis genes into Bacteria, Eucarya or Archaea is carried out based on no chlamydial orthologues, described previously.27 The genes which were categorized into Eucarya and Archaea were confirmed by phylogenetic analyses using CLUSTALW.28 The detail results for gene annotation, classification, gene divergence patterns and gene content comparisons are available in the Supplementary Tables 1–5 are available at Author Webpage. The sequences in this paper have been deposited in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank database (accession; chromosome, AP006861, plasmid, AP006862).4. Results and Discussion4.1. Genome structureThe Chlamydophila felis Fe/C-56 contains a circular chromosome consisting of 1 166 239 bp and 1005 protein-coding genes (Table 1). The C. felis also harbors a 7552 bp plasmid, pCfe1, with eight genes and the copy number of the plasmid per chromosome is approximately 4.5 (Table 1). The overall G+C contents are 39.4 and 33.9% for the chromosome and plasmid, respectively. The G+C content and gene density appear to be uniform in the genome (Fig. 1). The putative replication origin (Ori) of the chromosome was determined based on comparisons with other chlamydial predicted Ori sequences, the GC skew and the assumed DnaA binding sequences. The replication terminal was determined at a maximum point, 583 kb from the Ori, in a curve of the cumulative GC skew.29 There is no strong correlation between the directions of transcription and replication, except from the 880 kb position to the Ori observed slightly positive association. Many of the essential genes for transcription, translation and replication are located in a large region around the Ori.5Circular exhibition of the Chlamydophila felis Fe/C-56 genome.

Plasticity zoneTo figure out C. felis Fe/C-56 genome characteristics, genome structure and gene contents of C. felis were compared with those of C. pneumoniae J138.4 Although C. felis and C. pneumoniae relatively diverged far from each other, the two species share 879 orthologous genes and overall high synteny is exhibited, except a region surrounding the Ter, termed the plasticity zone.3,30 Synteny of the orthologous genes between C. felis and C. pneumoniae are displayed in a concentric presentation (Fig. 2A). In this report, C. felis plasticity zone was assigned from 491 to 596 kb (CF0398-0484: 87 genes) including the Ter region.6 In the C. felis plasticity zone, C. felis genes without C. pneumoniae J138 orthologues (C. felis no-C.pn-genes) are enriched with up to 30 genes out of the total 126 C. felis no-C.pn-genes on the chromosome (Fig. 2B). While 48 genes are functionally annotated out of 87 genes in the plasticity zone, C. felis no-C.pn-genes are 14 out of the 48 genes. The ratio (14:48) is much higher than the one in the C. felis chromosome (46:684). Most of the annotated genes in C. felis are conserved in some other organisms and thus the annotated no-C.pn-genes are thought to have dropped out of C. pneumoniae genome.3,6Analyses of the orthologous genes between Chlamydophila felis and Chlamydophila pneumoniae J138.

Frequently gene-translocated regions (FGRs)When two orthologous genes between C. felis and C. pneumoniae J138 are linked on whole chromosomes shown with two concentric circles, segmental genome translocations are observed as sheaves of parallel lines horizontally crossing the origin-terminal axis between C. felis and C. pneumoniae (Fig. 2A). The regions with translocated genes in the C. felis genome are from 355 to 359 kb (CP0307-311) and from 759 to 878 kb (CP0654-0739, 86 genes), ones in C. pneumoniae J138 genome are from 1200 to 87 kb (Cpj1051-0072, connected at the termini of the genomic sequence) and from 485 to 550 kb (Cpj439-474) (Fig. 2C). The regions, termed frequently gene-translocated regions (FGRs) here, seems to have been formed by the genomic inversion events across the whole genome with the replication terminal region. When Chlamydophila felis genome is compared with Chlamydia trachomatis one, the same phenomenon for the gene translocation is observed in similar regions but the translocation between C. felis and C. trachomatis is more frequent than one between C. felis and C. pneumoniae (data not shown). The FGRs, which include the region reported as a hyper variable region31 or tmh/Inc locus,7 exhibit distinctive characteristics of the plasticity zone or the other regions of genome; (i) Out of 49 polymorphic outer membrane proteins genes omp/pmp (described below) in the C. felis chromosome, 22 omp/pmp genes are in the FGRs, whereas interestingly the plasticity zone contains no omp/pmp (Fig. 2B). (ii) Total 22 omp/pmp genes are conserved in C. pneumoniae J138, but in the FGRs only eight out of the 22 omp/pmp are conserved (P < 0.01). (iii) The omp/pmp and hypothetical genes are tandemly localized in the FGRs and seven repetitive sequences in C. pneumoniae genome contain omp/pmp genes, however C. felis genome lacks such repetitive sequences31 (Fig. 2C). (iv) C. felis no-C.pn-genes are enriched (27 genes) in the FGRs similarly to the plasticity zone. But ratio of annotated C. felis no-C.pn-genes per annotated genes in the FGRs (2:57) is almost equal to the one in the whole chromosome (30:684), when the omp/pmp genes are excluded from the annotated genes. (v) Of the 66 total inc genes (described below), 16 inc genes are enriched in the plasticity zone (P < 0.01) but only 6 in the FGRs (P = 0.5).Those characteristics implicate that the FGRs may assume a role for the multiplication of the omp/pmp genes rather than for genome reduction and inc genes may be on the verge of gene loss in the plasticity zone. Relationship between the gene translocation (or genome inversion) and gene multiplication are unknown, however it should be noted here that chlamydial genomes conserve an almost complete set of DNA recombination, repair genes and tRNA genes located in or near FGRs may be involved in the inversion fashion32 (Fig. 2C). The characteristics observed in the FGRs of C. felis and C. pneumoniae are detected as well as in the FGRs of C. trachomatis.4.4. Comparison within the family ChlamydiaceaeFour Chlamydiaceae species, i.e., C. felis, C. pneumoniae (three strains),3–5,C. trachomatis2 and C. muridarum3 share 795 common genes (Fig. 3A), 104 genes are specific to C. felis. Adding, C. caviae6 and C. abortus,7 formerly belonging to C. psittaci as strains, to this analysis, 47 genes are specific to C. felis including an extra adenylate kinase gene (CF265) and 8 polymorphic outer membrane protein genes (CF379, 380, 718, 719, 723, 724, 728, 735).Orthologue comparison within the family Chlamydiaceae.

(A) Numbers of orthologous and species specific genes represented in Venn diagrams, using Chlamydophila felis (this work), C. pneumoniae J138, AR39 and CWL029,3,5,Chlamydia trachomatis2 and C. muridarum.3 (B) Divergence pattern for all orthologous gene sets, except two, CF0973 and CF0599. (C) A schematic branching pattern for an orthologous gene set showing C. felis-specific evolution. Based on the multiple alignment and phylogenic analysis of orthologues using CLUSTALW,28 divergent distance is calculated as a branch length for an orthologous gene of each species. Genes are chosen for C. felis when the length of C. felis branch is longer than one of any other branch. (D) Numbers of genes exhibiting species specific evolution for C. felis, C. pneumoniae and C. trachomatis within the common 795 genes in Fig 3A.All of the orthologue sets, except two, surprisingly illustrate the similar phylogenetic patterns, in which the genes from the C. felis and C. pneumoniae and those from C. trachomatis and C. muridarum, are closest (Fig. 3B). The two exceptional genes, CF0973 and CF0599, are too highly conserved to statistically draw relevant phylogenetic trees. Thus, no inter-genus gene exchanges are detected during the chlamydial species establishment in this method.Regardless of the same phylogenetic pattern illustrated with orthologue sets, the lengths of C. felis divergence branches among the phylogenetic trees varied. To figure out C. felis genes which accumulate mutations more than the orthologous genes, the gene categorization was carried out using the definition that in the phylogenetic tree with C. felis, C. pneumoniae and C. trachomatis, a branch of C. felis gene from the divergent point is longest amongst three branches (Fig. 3C). Similar categorization was used for C. pneumoniae and C. trachomatis (Fig. 3D). Fourteen C. felis genes, such as four hypothetical genes (CF0008, CF0256, CF0470, CF0615), six genes encoding nucleic acid associating proteins (CF0085, CF0313, CF0899, CF0909, CF0925, CF0947) and four genes encoding membrane proteins including IncB (CF0032, CF0329, CF0415, CF0516) are categorized here as genes on faster evolution, implicating that these genes may be devoted for adaptation to the niche of C. felis.Gene variation of tryptophan biosynthesis is one of the most remarkable features in the comparison of chlamydial gene repertories. C. trachomatis and C. pneumoniae, worldwide common parasites to humans but not to animals, contain partial and no tryptophan biosynthesis genes in the genomes, respectively. On the other hand, the genomes of the animal pathogens, C. felis and C. caviae, surprisingly not C. abortus, conserve the tryptophan operon consisting of trpA, B, F, C, D and R and related genes, kynU (CF0435-CF0440 and CF0434, respectively) are conserved.6,7,33 Tryptophan depletion by IFN-<U+03B3> is thought as a crucial host defense mechanism against chlamydiae. On the contrary the chlamydial tryptophan biosynthesis gene is thought to be directly involved in chlamydial resistance against IFN-<U+03B3>.3,5,34 IFN-<U+03B3> treatment of host cells was performed to show how susceptible C. felis is against IFN-<U+03B3> comparing with other chlamydial species without a complete tryptophan synthesis pathway. Neither inhibition of inclusion body formation nor reduction in the size of inclusion bodies on average were observed for C. felis in the tests with concentrations of up to 10 ng/ml of human IFN-<U+03B3>, while both the infection and growth of C. pneumoniae J38 and C. trachomatis were reduced under the same experimental conditions.34 Tryptophan might play a key role for the molecular basis of host–parasite interaction in terms of IFN-<U+03B3> resistance, the gene repertories of tryptophan biosynthesis cannot explain all about host tropisms of individual chlamydial species. However, tryptophan utilization evokes all evolutional relationships between host defense and parasite infection, leading to chlamydial host and tissue tropisms.4.5. Horizontal gene transferOne of most interesting characteristics of chlamydial genome constituents is that a few percentages of the total genes are similar to genes of taxonomical distinctive organisms.2,35 To figure out such genes in the C. felis genome, sequence-based gene classification was performed as a screening of the horizontal gene transfer from non-chlamydial organisms to the C. felis genome. Of the total of 1005 protein-coding genes of C. felis, 537, 59 and 5 genes may be derived from bacterial, eukaryotic and archaeal origins, respectively (Fig. 1). The numbers of chlamydial specific and ambiguous genes are 323 and 81, respectively. All the eukaryotic and archaeal origin genes in C. felis, except CF0874, are conserved and exhibit synteny in C. pneumoniae, C. trachomatis and C. muridarum. Based on phylogenetic analysis, the CF0874 coding a pyrimidine metabolism enzyme, orotate phosphoribosyl transferase, is seemed to be lost from C. trachomatis and C. muridarum. It is possible that the eukaryotic and archaeal genes in C. felis were laterally transferred before the genera divergence.2 However, no further proof such as different G+C contents or genome structures is observed to show that the genes have been derived from taxonomical distinctive organisms.4.6. PlasmidChlamydophila felis and many other chlamydial species carry a plasmid, pCf01, similar to other chlamydial plasmids.36 Interestingly, two genes, pCf07 and pCf08, on the plasmid exhibit high similarities to CF0055 and CF0056 on C. felis chromosome, respectively. The CF0056 and pCf08 gene products show significant similarities to parA and minD gene products conserved widely among bacterial genomes. The phylogenetic analysis of the parA/minD family has illustrated that the chlamydial chromosome and plasmid genes form independent groups, both of which are separated from the other bacterial genes. Moreover, the divergent patterns in each chlamydial group are analogous (Fig. 4). It implies that the chlamydial plasmid had already been presented in an ancient chlamydia before the two genera divergence and that no intra-genus plasmid exchanges and no parA/minD gene exchanges between the chromosome and plasmid occurred after the divergence.Phylogenetic tree of parA/minD genes. The parA/minD genes used here are for chlamydial chromosome; Chlamydophila pneumoniae J138 (Accession: AP002548-9), Chlamydophila felis Fe/C-56 (CF0056), Chlamydophila caviae GPIC (AE016997-167), Chlamydia muridarum (AE002353-7) and Chlamydia trachomatis D/UW-3/CX (AE001329-1) and plasmid; Chlamydophila pneumoniae N16 pCpnE1 (X82078-9), Chlamydophila felis Fe/C-56 pCfe1 (pCf08), Chlamydophila caviae GPIC pCpA1 (AE016997-168), Chlamydia muridarum pMoPn (AE002162-6) and Chlamydia trachomatis pCHL1 (J03321-7) and for other bacterial genes; Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1 (AL935261-129), Treponema pallidum Nichols (AE001208-8), Bacillus subtilis168 (Z99124-191), Listeria monocytogenes EGD-e (AL591984-146), Vibrio parahaemolyticus O3:K6 (AP005076-8), Vibrio cholerae N16961 (AE004271-9), Buchnera aphidicola Sg (Schizaphisgraminum) (AE014108-5), Buchnera aphidicola APS (Acyrthosiphon pisum) (AP001119-13), Yersinia pestis CO92 (AJ414151-83), Salmonella enterica Typhi (AL627272-29) and Escherichia coli K12 (AE000216-6).Phylogenetic tree of parA/minD genes.

Inclusion membrane proteins (Incs)Two hundred and sixty five genes in the C. felis genome contain transmembrane domain(s). The ratio of the number of transmembrane genes per the total number of genes in C. felis agrees with the finding in most bacteria,37 but the distribution of the number of transmembrane domains is different from non-chlamydial bacteria. Noticeably, C. felis contains 75 genes coding two transmembrane domains, which is twice as many as some non-chlamydial bacteria. Informatics analysis25 has revealed a total of 63 putative inc genes in the 75 genes. In addition, three more genes similar to eukaryotic myosin heavy chain genes have been classified as inc because four other genes partially similar to myosin heavy chain genes are categorized into the putative inc genes and two myosin heavy chain like protein of the C. pneumoniae J138 were experimentally shown to localize on inclusion bodies (data not shown). However, the functions of Inc proteins are still largely unknown. Forty-six putative inc genes are identified by the same method for C. felis inc identification in the genome of Parachlamydia amoebophila UWE25, which is diverged at about 700 million years ago from the last common ancestor with the family Chlamydiaceae38 (data not shown). It indicates that before the divergence of the two chlamydial families, inc gene family has already expanded in the common ancestor genome.4.8. Polymorphism membrane proteins (PMPs)The omp/pmp genes, which encode outer membrane proteins or polymorphic membrane proteins, compose the most important and characteristic gene family in chlamydia. OMP/PMPs are reported to conserve N-terminal repeat motives, GGAI (or variants) and FXXN and terminate in a phenylanine residue.4,7,39 In chlamydial genomes such as C. pneumoniae strains, C. trachomatis, C. muridarum, C. caviae and C. abortus, 18, 21, 9, 9, 17 and 18 omp/pmp genes are identified, respectively.2–7 FASTA analysis with the all chlamydial omp/pmp genes reveals that in the C. felis genome 39 genes are similar to omp/pmp genes. Of the 39 putative omp/pmp genes, 18 genes (CF0209, CF0379, CF0721, CF0722, CF0725-CF0732, CF0735-CF0737, CF0801, CF0802, CF0992) conserve the N-terminal repeat motives and phenylanine at C-termini and 4 (CF0380, CF0719, CF0723, CF0733) and 6 (CF0101, CF0525, CF0720, CF0724, CF0734, CF0958) genes conserve only the N-terminal repeat motives or phenylanine at C-termini, respectively. No-C. felis genes are identified as new omp/pmp genes by the motif analysis. Gene expression of those genes and utilization of the gene products should be tested further.5. ConclusionsHere we exhibit genome analyses of a worldwide spread pathogen for pneumonia9 and conjunctivitis8 in cats, Chlamydophila felis (Chlamydia psittaci feline pneumonitis agent). C. felis infection is rarely identified in humans while a few were reported,11,12 but seroepidemiological study revealed that the prevalence rates of anti-C. felis Fe/Pn1 antibodies (1.7% and 8.8% for the general human population and veterinarians in small animal clinics in Japan, respectively) are rather higher than expected.10 Thus the genome data of C. felis must be a useful tool to understand chlamydial tropism and pathogenicities, or to aid in the detection and prevention of C. felis causing diseases in both human and animals.We thank A.

Introduction Ascidians hold a unique position in the evolution of the animal kingdom. Ascidians were the first chordates, having developed a notochord and dorsal nervous system. As such, ascidians have attracted the attention of developmental biologists as a model system for studying the body planning principles employed by chordates, including vertebrates and humans. 1 , 2 A draft genome sequence of Ciona intestinalis , a ubiquitous species of ascidian used by researchers world-wide, has been prepared, and 15 852 protein-coding genes have been predicted from the euchromatic region of the genome. 3 Extensive cDNA/EST studies also have been carried out with C. intestinalis . 4 These have focused primarily on the various developmental stages of C. intestinalis , including fertilized eggs, 5 cleavage-stage embryos, 6 gastrulae and neurulae, tailbud embryos 7 and tadpole larvae. 8 The total number of ESTs has reached 454 861, assembled into 20 616 independent clusters. Gene expression profiles of the above-mentioned embryonic stages have been analyzed by means of whole-mount in situ hybridization (WISH). 5–8 The developmental stage following fertilization covers only a short period of 1–2 days in the life cycle of C. intestinalis . Following metamorphosis on days 3–4, the animal begins to feed and grow. By 2–3 weeks several adult organs have formed, including the neural complex, body-wall muscle, heart, endostyle, pharyngeal gill slits, esophagus, stomach, intestine and gonads. 9 The animal then matures and survives for another 3–4 months. A cDNA/EST study and gene expression profiling using WISH have been performed on young adult C. intestinalis10 and several endostyle-specific genes have been characterized. 11 Immunity is an important biological function that is generated and mobilized as the animal reaches adulthood. Hemocytes play a central role in immune function. Although hemocytes originate in the trunk lateral cells of the tailbud embryo in the case of Halocynthia roretzi , another species of ascidian, they are first detected morphologically at the larval stage. 12 During or after metamorphosis, hemocytes proliferate significantly.  Ascidians have only an innate type of immunity, rather than an adaptive-type, to protect themselves against foreign invaders. 13 The innate immunity of ascidians has been examined using mainly Halocynthia and Styela and is considered a prototype of that found in vertebrates. 14–18,C. intestinalis hemocytes also phagocytose foreign materials. 19 Based on the assumption that C. intestinalis hemocytes serve as a model for studying the innate immunity, we so far reported on the gene expression profiles of the cells. First, we performed a cDNA/EST study of hemocytes' transcripts and identified 62 host defense-related clusters from 3357 ESTs. 20 Out of them, 79 newly identified cDNAs were fully sequenced. 21 We subsequently increased the number of cDNAs (ESTs) to 28 355 (56 709) and identified among them 2 hemocyte marker genes, von-Willebrand factor A-like and complement 6-like . 22 In parallel, we surveyed the C. intestinalis genome and detected many immune system-related genes. 23 In this study, we have tried to identify as many transcripts as possible that are expressed specifically in C. intestinalis hemocytes, using the large amount of EST information and large-scale WISH. We have followed the expression of the identified genes during the entire C. intestinalis life cycle by extracting corresponding transcripts from a microarray dataset, providing a broad view of hemocyte-specific genes in C. intestinalis . 2. Materials and Methods2.1. Biological materials Adult C. intestinalis was maintained under constant light to induce oocyte maturation. Eggs and sperm were collected by dissecting gonads and inseminated artificially. The fertilized eggs were cultured at 20°C and larvae hatched ~14 h later. After metamorphosis, juveniles that adhered to trays were cultured with the diatom Chaetoceros gracillis as their food source. They were fed every 2 days and the seawater was changed every 2 days. Adult C. intestinalis survived up to 4 months. 2.2. WISH Two-week-old young adults were used as the material, since they are of adequate size for WISH and have all types of adult tissue. The organisms were starved for 3 days to evacuate food waste and harvested. Relaxation and fixation of specimens were as described previously. 24 The cDNA clones were chosen from a cDNA resource of C. intestinalis , 25 and the insert sequence with the T7 promoter was amplified by PCR. Digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled RNA probes were synthesized using T7 RNA polymerase and the cDNA sequences as the templates. 24 Large-scale WISH using InSitu Chips was as described. 26 Preparation and WISH of adult hemocytes were performed as described. 272.3. Double-colored WISHThe procedure for double-colored WISH was the same as for single-colored WISH except that the DIG- and biotin-labeled RNA probes were prepared, mixed and used for hybridization. The biotin signal was detected as green fluorescence using the TSA Biotin System (PerkinElmer, Boston, MA) and streptavidin-FITC. The DIG signal was detected as red fluorescence (HNP/FastRed TR) with an HNPP Fluorescent Detection Set (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). An Olympus BX51-33-FL2 fluorescence microscope equipped with a Pixera pro 150ES camera was used for the photography.2.4. Microarray analysis To prepare total RNA from developing C. intestinalis embryos, the acid guanidine thiocyanate-phenol/chloroform method was used. 28 For adult RNA preparation, whole bodies were homogenized in a solution containing 4 M guanidine thiocyanate, 1% (v/v) mercaptoethanol, 50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mM EDTA and 0.5% (w/v) N -lauroylsarcosinate. The homogenate was ultracentrifuged through a cesium trifluoroacetate gradient. Poly(A) + RNA was purified using an mRNA Purification Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). Its quality was tested with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). Two microgram each of poly(A) + RNA was labeled with either Cy3 or Cy5 using an Agilent Fluorescent Linear Amplification Kit (Agilent Technologies), mixed together and hybridized to the Ciona 22K Custom Oligo DNA Microarray loaded with 21 938 probes. 29 Hybridization and washing protocols were according to the manufacturer's instructions. The microarrays were scanned with a GenePix4000B DNA Microarray Scanner (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). For image analysis, normalization and data extraction, GenePix Pro4.0 Microarray Analysis Software (Axon Instruments) and GeneSpring Software (Silicon Genetics, Redwood City, CA) were used. A combination of two different RNA preparations was used for hybridization. For the developing embryos, RNA from fertilized eggs served as a reference sample and RNA from post-egg stages were used as test samples. The developing embryos included 2-, 4-, 8-, 16-, 32- and 64-cell embryos, and early gastrulae, late gastrulae, early neurulae, immediate early tailbuds, early tailbuds, middle tailbuds, late tailbuds, larvae and juveniles. For adults, the RNA combinations were from juveniles and 1.5-month-old adults, from 1.5- to 2.5-month-old adults, and from 2.5- to 4.0-month-old adults. Hybridizations were performed twice, using the same RNA combinations but different dyes. Thus, the average intensity for a given gene was calculated from two independent hybridizations. To draw an expression profile for each gene during the life cycle, the fluorescence intensity obtained from the fertilized eggs served as the reference 1.0, from which relative values could be calculated for each stage of development through adulthood.3. Results3.1. Identification of genes expressed specifically in hemocytes One of the goals of this study was to identify as many transcripts as possible that were expressed specifically in hemocytes. Since hemocytes emerge in young adults as a significant tissue throughout the body, cDNA/ESTs obtained randomly from young adults were examined first. Our previously reported young-adult gene expression profile found 12 230 (24 460) cDNAs (ESTs) and 976 assembled clusters. 10 Since we had not categorized ‘hemocyte’ expression in that report, 10 we carefully re-examined the WISH images of the 976 independent sequences, and found 87 sequences likely to have positive hemocyte staining in the pharyngeal gill. Therefore, these 87 sequences were processed for re-evaluation by WISH.  Furthermore, since the previous report, 10 the numbers of cDNAs (ESTs) and assembled clusters from the young adult had grown to 28 414 (56 828) and 7179, respectively. These clusters were classified into several groups, based on putative function as determined by homology to known genes. For this study 550 clusters categorized as of unknown function were processed for WISH. Of these, 66 clusters were found that were likely to stain positively in hemocytes.  In the recent cDNA/EST study of hemocytes themselves, 28 355 (56 709) cDNAs (ESTs) and 7940 assembled clusters were found. 22 We chose 81 transcripts as candidates for preferential and abundant expression in hemocytes. 22 However, this was based on an in silico comparison of hemocytes' cDNA/ESTs with those from other tissues and/or developmental stages, rather than experimental data.  Therefore, 213 clusters (87 + 66 + 81 - redundant clusters) were rigorously and repeatedly examined by small-scale WISH to confirm the strict specificity of gene expression in hemocytes. Thirty-four such cDNA clones eventually were obtained. Among them 03435 and 10410 had been demonstrated as hemocytes' markers in our previous report, 22 and the remaining 32 genes were newly identified as hemocytes-specific transcripts. Figure 1 illustrates examples of WISH images corresponding to eight genes from the whole body (upper rows) and the pharyngeal gill (lower rows). Only hemocytes inside the vessels stained strongly and specifically.

The blue color indicates positive staining of hemocytes. The lower rows are enlarged views of pharyngeal gills where positive-staining hemocytes are detected inside the transverse and longitudinal vessels. Scale bars in the upper and lower rows are 500 and 100 µm, respectively.

Content of genes expressed specifically in hemocytesTable 1 lists 34 genes, along with the identification of clusters, the status of clusters, and the corresponding ESTs. Where a full cDNA insert sequence or an assembled sequence from ESTs was available, attempts were made to predict an open reading frame (ORF), its amino acid sequence and a domain structure in the polypeptide. ORFs were obtained for 25 transcripts, five of which appeared to encode transmembrane proteins. A list of Ciona's hemocytes-specific genes.

For the clusters 02652, 07018, 10250, 15571 and 15627, a corresponding gene was not predicted in the genome browser. Table 1 also includes information on the corresponding gene, as predicted with a genome browser and homologies to the known genes. Eleven clusters showed significant homology to genes with a known motif or a known function. Among them 03435, 10410 and 15640 were homologous to complement component 3b/4b receptor-1 (CR-1, annotated as von Willebrand factor type-A-like previously 22 ), complement 6 (C6) and bactericidal permeability-increasing protein (BPIP), respectively. These three are perhaps immunity related. Each of the remaining eight genes (03474, 04837, 05210, 07063, 10406, 15607, 16828 and 37166) showed homology to various known genes, respectively. On the other hand, the 12 genes encoded hypothetical proteins and the 11 genes exhibited no homologies to known genes. Thus, the 34 genes selected as above were diverse in both sequence and domain architecture. 3.3. Differential expression of identified genes in subsets of hemocytesWhile identifying the above 34 genes by WISH, we noticed that the percentage of positive cells within the hemocyte population varied from gene to gene. Transcripts of some genes were detected in most of the hemocytes and were referred to as major, whereas transcripts of other genes were detected in only a fraction of the hemocytes and were referred to as moderate or minor. The clusters 02671, 07027 and 15584 were examples of major, moderate and minor patterns of expression in hemocytes, respectively. Identified genes were examined to determine whether they were uniformly or differentially expressed in hemocytes. Double-colored WISH was performed with the above mentioned 02671, 07027 and 15584. Row A in Fig. 2 depicts an entire young adult individual in which signals from 02671 and 15584 were from red (HNP/FastRed TR) and green (FITC) fluorescences, respectively. The red fluorescence was detected only within a major population of hemocytes and the green fluorescence was detected only within a minor population of hemocytes, with no overlap. A similar result was obtained with the major transcript 02671 and the moderate transcript 07027. Row B shows the pharyngeal gill. The green fluorescence from 02671 and the red fluorescence from 07027 did not overlap. The yellow fluorescence in Row B likely resulted from endogenous fluorescence since it also was observed in the controls without hybridization. Thus, the expression of each of these three genes in hemocytes appeared to be distinct.  Double-colored WISH images of three distinct gene transcripts.

Row B: FITC and HNP/FastRed TR fluorescence indicate the transcripts of 02671 and 07027, respectively. Although in general, the red and green fluorescence did not overlap, a yellow fluorescence was detected.

An analysis similar as above was extended to the immunity-related genes. The probes used corresponded to CR-1-like (03435), C6-like (10410) and BPIP-like (15640), respectively. In Fig. 3 , the left two columns represent the pharyngeal gill, whereas the right two columns represent isolated hemocytes. In Row A, green fluorescence of CR-1-like and red fluorescence of C6-like were detected in distinct hemocytes and did not overlap. Similarly, overlap was neither observed between BPIP-like and C6-like (Row B) nor between BPIP-like and CR-1-like (Row C). The result indicates that there are at least three different subsets within the hemocyte population and that each subset expresses a distinct set of genes.

Expression profiles of hemocyte-specific genes in the life cycle of C. intestinalis Since hemocytes are first detected morphologically at the larval stage, emerge during and after metamorphosis and persist in adult C. intestinalis , the expression patterns of hemocyte-specific genes throughout the life cycle were examined. Data were extracted from microarray analyses performed at each stage of development, including adulthood. The expression patterns of hemocyte-specific genes could be categorized into two major groups, as shown in Figure 4 . The expression of gene 15640, BPIP-like , was low or undetectable during early stages of development, became detectable at the late-tailbud stage and reached its maximum level at the juvenile/young-adult stage ( Fig. 4A ). This appeared to parallel the morphological appearance of the hemocytes. The expression of 15640 gradually declined as the adult aged, probably because the percentage of positive hemocytes among the total body cell number decreased with age. The 17 more genes could be categorized as the type of 15640 and they were as follows; 03435 ( CR-1-like ), 10410 ( C6-like ), 02671, 03257, 03268, 03538, 04837, 06033, 06837, 06854, 10250, 10406, 15571, 15584, 15627, 15746 and 16828. Each of them showed somewhat variable but essentially similar patterns with that of 15640.  Representative expression profiles of hemocyte-specific genes in the life cycle of C. intestinalis . The expression patterns of 15640 ( BPIP-like ) and 05210 are plotted throughout the life cycle. The expression levels are relative values based on the egg as 1.0 and plotted on a logarithmic scale. For gene 15640, three different oligonucleotide probes were loaded on the microarray. FE, fertilized eggs; 2, 2-cell embryos; 4, 4-cell embryos; 8, 8-cell embryos; 16, 16-cell embryos; 32, 32-cell embryos; 64, 64-cell embryos; EG, early gastrulae; LG, late gastrulae; EN, early neurulae; ITB, immediate early tailbuds; ETB, early tailbuds; MTB, mid tailbuds; LTB, late tailbuds; LV, larvae; JN, juveniles; 1.5M, adults aged one and a half months; 2.5M, adults aged two and a half months; 4.0M, adults aged 4 months.

A second pattern of expression was seen with the gene 05210 ( Fig. 4B ). It should be noted that gene expression throughout the life cycle was calculated as a relative level, with eggs taken to be 1.0. The actual fluorescence intensity of 05210 was significantly high in eggs (microarray data not shown), probably because 05210 is a maternal gene. Its expression gradually decreased during development, re-emerging at the larva stage, although the peak was less evident. Genes 07063, 09947, 10247, 15607, 15691 and 37166 also followed this pattern of expression. Thus, the seven genes were categorized into this group. The two genes, 02662 and 03474, showed distinct patterns, as compared with the two major categories, and the reason for this is not clear. For remaining genes, either the corresponding probes were not loaded on the microarray chips (5 genes) or the fluorescence intensities were too low to measure (2 genes).3.5. Identification of genes expressed predominantly in hemocytes The survey of the 213 WISH clusters revealed genes that were expressed in hemocytes but were not strictly specific for hemocytes. These were classified tentatively into two groups: type-1 and type-2. The expression of type-1 genes was detected in hemocytes as well as in one other young adult tissue ( Fig. 5A and B ). The genes 02764 and 07623 were expressed in the endostyle and intestine, respectively, as well as in hemocytes. The expression of type-2 genes was detected in multiple organs including hemocytes. The type-2 gene 02021 was expressed in the endostyle and neural complex, as well as in hemocytes (panel C). Nineteen type-1 and 35 type-2 genes were found. Table 2 illustrates in which tissues in addition to hemocytes each of the type-1 and type-2 genes were expressed. These results suggest that, as in other animals, there are multiple machineries in C. intestinalis that direct gene expression in different sets of tissues including hemocytes.

Construction of a data base of C. intestinalis hemocyte transcripts The details of this report have been presented as a C iona i ntestinalis Bloo d D ata B ase (CiBlooDB) ( Author Webpage ) that includes the WISH images as ‘imgs’. For several genes, enlargement of WISH-positive hemocyte images and/or WISH images taken from different angles are available. Each gene listed in the data base is linked to the Ciona cDNA/EST database ( Author Webpage ) and the genome database ( Author Webpage ). 4. Discussion In this study, we have identified as many C. intestinalis hemocyte-specific transcripts as possible. Large-scale WISH of young adult specimens, a technology developed in our laboratory, has proved to be near-ideal for this purpose. 26 With this method InSitu Chips can be used to screen 96 independent sequences at one time. Thus, the screened 1526 (976 + 550) sequences correspond to 16 rounds of hybridization of 96 column-based InSitu Chips. The 1526 sequences correspond to 9.6% of the predicted genes in the genome and 21% of the clusters expressed in young adults. Since the 160 rounds of hybridization that would be needed to cover the entire genome would be impractical, we incorporated into the WISH the 81 candidate sequences that were selected from hemocyte ESTs based on an in silico subtraction. 22 This enabled us to identify 34 hemocyte-specific transcripts, compared with the 2 hemocyte-marker genes we reported previously. 22 The identification of 34 specific genes is likely to shed some light on the nature of hemocytes themselves. For example, in homology searches with the identified genes, clusters 03435, 10410 and 15640 were found to be homologous to CR-1 , C6 and BPIP , respectively. Therefore, these three genes possibly are associated with the immunity-related function of hemocytes. In contrast, 12 clusters have homologies with hypothetical proteins and 11 clusters show no homology to any known gene. Twelve of the 34 clusters likely encode polypeptides of <100 amino acid residues. One interesting possibility is that some of the 34 genes encode low-molecular weight anti-microbial polypeptides. However it must be noted that sequence comparisons alone do not necessarily predict whether a polypeptide has anti-microbial activity. The sequences of anti-microbial peptides reported thus far vary from species to species and from substance to substance. 30 Nevertheless, the identification of significant numbers of hypothetical and/or new genes suggests that C. intestinalis hemocytes either function in the immune response or mobilize genes that are not known among the innate immunity genes of mice and humans.  The expression patterns of hemocyte-specific genes have a second implication. Different sets of some clusters (02671, 07027 and 15584 in Fig. 2 , and CR-1-like , C6-like and BPIP-like in Fig. 3 ) are expressed in subsets of hemocytes that appear to be different. This suggests that the C. intestinalis hemocytes can be classified into several, at least three subgroups based on gene expression. The hemocytes of Halocynthia roretzy are categorized into five subgroups, L1 through L5, based on morphology. 31 Furthermore, most of the 34 C. intestinalis genes display one of two different expression patterns in the animal's life cycle. The genes from one group show a clear peak of expression at the larval/young-adult stage, at the time when hemocytes emerge as a significant proportion of the body cells. The genes from a second group are expressed not only in hemocytes of young adults but also in eggs. Although the significance of one of these genes as a possible maternal gene is not known, these observations imply the existence of multiple mechanisms for hemocyte-specific gene expression. The identification of hemocyte-dominant genes further strengthens this hypothesis. Thus, from the aspect of gene expression, C. intestinalis hemocytes may exert more pleiotropic effects than previously believed.  The promoter regions that are responsible for neuron-specific expression of C. intestinalis genes, such as G-protein alpha subunit, arrestin and vesicular acetylcholine transporter, recently have been reported. 32 This study used transgenic C. intestinalis embryos in which heterologous green fluorescent protein genes were under the control of the 5' flanking regions of C. intestinalis genes. Thus, in the case of these genes, the regulatory elements for tissue-specific expression appear to be compacted into a relatively small region of 3000–4000 bp. If this proves to be the case for the hemocyte-specific genes as well, the identification of the 34 transcripts in this study will provide a valuable opportunity for analyzing their promoters, by using them in transgenic animals and visualizing hemocytes under live conditions.

Introduction The regulation of gene expression by epigenetic mechanisms such as cytosine methylation contributes to various biological processes like parental genomic imprinting, X-chromosomal inactivation, cellular differentiation and aging as well as the development of malignant disorders. 1–4 A variety of methods for the analysis of CpG methylation status have been developed including chromatographic separation, use of methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes and bisulfite-driven conversion of non-methylated cytosine to uracil. 5 Despite the widespread application of the latter and the ongoing technical ameliorations regarding the bisulfite protocol and methylation-specific PCR, still several limitations exist. These concern DNA degradation during sodium-bisulfite treatment due to oxidative damage, depurination under the required acidic and thermal conditions as well as inconsistent conversion of cytosine to uracil in a given DNA sample. 6 , 7 To overcome these technological difficulties we developed a novel method for 5'mC analysis applying a microarray format with immunodetection of 5'mC directly on genomic DNA without sequence conversion or DNA amplification. This was achieved by the exploitation of recent improvements in the field of array manufacture (150-µm thin aldehyde glass slides), ultra-sensitive surface molecule detection and the utilization of a fast scanning system with sufficient geometrical resolution. 8 , 92. Materials and Methods2.1. Cell lines and genomic DNA preparation Human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines HL-60 (American Type Culture Collection) and KG1a (Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen, DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany) were grown in RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco Invitrogen, Paisley, Scotland) supplemented with 10% FCS (Gibco), l -glutamine (300 mg/l; Gibco) and antibiotics [Streptomycin (100 µg/ml)/Penicillin (100 U/ml); Gibco]. Both cell lines are extensively described and epigenetically characterized. 10–13 Genomic DNA from cell lines was isolated according to Qiagens QIAmp Blood Kit procedure manual (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Restriction enzyme digest was performed with Mnl I from NEB (New England Biolabs). 2.2. Methyl-specific PCR (MS-PCR) Chemicals and oligonucleotides were purchased at Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Steinheim, Germany and Metabion GmbH, Munich, Germany, respectively. Methyl-specific PCR (MS-PCR) was performed with primer sequences as published by Herman et al. 14 Minor modifications concerned the use of HotStarTaq DNA polymerase (5 U/µl; Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), sodium-bisulfite treatment at 55°C for 4 h and 40 PCR cycles in a Primus 96 plus MWG-biotech thermal cycler starting with 400 ng bisulfite-treated DNA. All PCRs were performed with positive controls for both unmethylated and methylated alleles. PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels and ethidium bromide staining. 2.3. Microarray production To minimize background fluorescence we used borosilicate glass slides (50 × 24 × 0.15 mm 3 ; Stölzle-Oberglas, Austria) with an aldehyde surface obtained by standard surface chemistry. 15 Amino-modified capture oligonucleotides were coupled to the slide surface by reductive amination. 2.4. Capture oligonucleotide dilution and spotting processSense capture oligonucleotides were diluted to 5 µM in 1× SSC [15 mM sodium citrate, 150 mM sodium chloride, pH 7.0 with 2.5% glycerol (Sigma-Aldrich)]. The contact spotting robot (SpotBot), from ArrayIt, CA, was used with Tungsten Split Pins (PT3000; Point Technologies, Boulder, CO) for the microarray printing process, resulting in spots of ~50-µm diameter with a volume of 100 pl. Oligonucleotide immobilization was performed at room temperature by incubation in a humid environment for 12 h. For stabilization of the intermediary carbon–nitrogen double bond between aldehyde surface and amino-modified capture oligonucleotides to form a secondary amine, sodium cyanoborohydride [0.02 M in 0.1 M carbonate buffer; pH 8.2 (Sigma-Aldrich)] was applied by additional 2 h incubation. After a 15 min washing step in carbonate buffer (0.1 M; pH 8.2) microarrays were dried and immediately used for hybridization experiments.2.5. Capture oligonucleotide design Capture oligonucleotide design was based upon analyses of predicted promoter sequences for possible methylation sites (CpG islands). 14 , 16 Capture oligonucleotides suitable to hybridize to DNA-targets generated by restriction enzyme digestion of genomic DNA were designed using OligoWiz software (Center for Biological Sequence Analysis BioCentrum-DTU Technical University of Denmark). Sequence information concerning capture and hybridization oligonucleotides (VBC-genomics, Vienna, Austria) including modifications and fluorescence labels are summarized in Table 1 . Oligonucleotide sequences Oligonucleotide description with length, sequence and NT number when indicated: All oligonucleotides, except target oligonucleotide, carried a 3'-terminal amino group with (CH) 7 -linker for surface immobilization. Positive control, sense p15/CDKN2b, sense p16/CDKN2a and sense E-cadherin carried an additional 5'-terminal fluorescence label (cyanine 5) used for spot quality control; x in sequence marks 5'methyl-cytosine; positive control oligonucleotide was spotted on each microarray and was used as internal standard; nonsense, sense p15/CDKN2b and target oligonucleotide were used to test antibody specificity and sensitivity; all sense oligonucleotides were used as capture oligonucleotides for hybridization with genomic DNA.

Hybridization experiments Hybridizations were performed at 55°C (oligonucleotides) or 65°C (genomic DNA), respectively, in a hybridization buffer mix containing 4× SSC and 0.1% SDS (Sigma-Aldrich, Chemie). The used surface inactivation (sodiumcyanoborohydride buffer) and blocking conditions [0.2% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich) in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Gibco)] allowed to omit prehybridization or the use of competitive DNA. For single subgrid hybridization (2.5-µl hybridization mixtures) 5 mm diameter cover slips, (Menzel Gläser, Braunschweig, Germany) and for multiple subgrid hybridization (10 µl hybridization mix) 22 × 22 mm 2 cover slips (Assistent, Sondheim, Germany) were used in Corning hybridization chambers (Fischer Scientific, Loughborough, UK) submerged in a water bath. After overnight hybridization washes were performed with 2× SSC, 0.01% SDS for 15 min, 2× SSC for 15 min and 0.2× SSC for 15 min with all washing solutions preheated to 42°C. 2.7. Microarray immunolabelingSlides were blocked for 30 min at room temperature with 0.2% BSA in Dulbecco's PBS and incubated with a monoclonal anti-5'mC antibody (clone: 33D3; mouse IgG1; Serotec, Düsseldorf, Germany) or isotype-matched control antibody (anti-collagen clone: COL-1; mouse IgG1) diluted in PBS–BSA–Tween [BSA 0.1%; Tween-20 0.05% (Sigma-Aldrich Chemie)] for 1 h at room temperature at a concentration of 1 µg/ml each. Primary antibody incubation was followed by a washing step in PBS for 5 min and secondary antibody incubation (cyanine 3 dye conjugated secondary goat anti-mouse antibody; 1 : 2000 diluted in PBS–BSA–Tween, Amersham) for 1 h at room temperature. After three 5 min washing steps in PBS, microarrays were dried and scanned immediately.2.8. Ultra-sensitive microarray readout The device applies a novel readout technology that combines wide-field illumination as well as time delay and integration (TDI) mode for readout. 9 In brief, the apparatus used in our measurements comprises an inverted microscope (Axiovert 200, Zeiss, Germany), a high-precision scanning stage (Märzhäuser Wetzlar, Germany) and a charge-coupled device camera (CCD camera) with high quantum efficiency and low readout noise running in TDI mode (CoolSNAP HQ, Photometrics, Roper Scientific, USA). For illumination of cyanine 3 and cyanine 5 we used an Nd : Yag laser (Neodym-Ion doted Yttrium–Aluminium–Granat) with <U+03BB> = 532 nm (Millennia II, Spectra-Physics, USA) and a Krypton-Ion laser with <U+03BB> = 647 nm (43 Series Ion Laser, Melles Griot, USA), respectively. High laser intensities, ×100 optical magnification (0.516 nm pixel resolution) and short exposure times (250 ms) allowed ultra-sensitive microarray readout within minutes. 2.9. Image analysis and statistics For image and data analysis we used ImaGene® 5.6 (BioDiscovery, CA, USA) together with ArrayNorm® 1.7 (Graz University of Technology Bioinformatics Group, Austria), 17 a software for array normalization and data visualization control. After background correction, statistical analysis of fluorescence signal intensities comparing the cell lines was done with two-tailed Student's t -test. 3. Results and discussion Designed amino-modified and fluorescence-labeled capture oligonucleotides were spotted on to the aldehyde surface-coated glass cover slips, hybridized with selected target oligonucleotides or enzyme digested genomic DNA. The consecutive indirect anti-5mC antibody staining was followed by readout on the fluorescence scanning platform (schematically outlined in Fig. 1 ). Cell line and target gene selection were based solely on well-established promoter/gene methylation models: E-cadherin, p15/CDKN2b and p16/CDKN2a from two AML-derived tumor cell lines (HL-60, KG1a). To validate the results obtained with the anti-5'mC microarray we analyzed representative CpG-island containing DNA fragments by MS-PCR.  Schematic assay system.

Antibody specificity To test the anti-5mC antibody specificity (Clone 33D3 18 ), target oligonucleotides designed with five consecutive 5'methyl CpG dinucleotides (100 aM, 600 molecules per µl), spaced by 2 nt, and nonsense oligonucleotides without 5'mC were hybridized to the immobilized capture oligonucleotide (1 µM) ( Fig. 2 ). The anti-5mC antibody signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of spot mean fluorescence intensity (mfi in counts) for the 5'mC positive target oligonucleotide was SNR = 7, in contrast to 5'mC negative nonsense control with an average SNR of 1. The minimum relevant signal is defined as the signal for which the SNR is =3. 19 Control experiments on sense and nonsense capture oligonucleotides after target hybridization with unspecific primary monoclonal antibody (anti-collagen) and labeled anti-IgG1 secondary antibody gave no signals (data not shown).

Assay sensitivity Hybridization experiments were performed with sense and nonsense capture oligonucleotides hybridized with a series of increasing target oligonucleotide concentrations (600 aM to 38.4 fM; Fig. 3 ). Signals of 10 repeats from 2 hybridization experiments plotted against the target oligonucleotide concentration are linear ( R2 = 0.96) from 600 aM to 38.4 fM. On a minimal slide background the 5'-mC-specific signals resulted in an SNR of 8 (mfi/SD 18/8) for the 600 aM spot and up to an SNR of 83 (mfi/SD 249/125) for the 38.4 fM spot. Signal intensities for target oligonucleotide hybridized to nonsense capture oligonucleotide are similar to slide background. A detection limit at 600 aM target oligonucleotide represents 1.5 fg DNA per hybridization volume of 3 µl, corresponding to the DNA content of nuclei from 540 cells. The detection limit of methylation-specific PCR is in the range of 50–500 pg DNA representing 10–100 cells. 20 Detection limit and dynamic range of the 5'methyl-cytosine microarray immunostaining.

MS-PCR MS-PCR was done using DNA from the cell lines HL-60 and KG1a which are well characterized with regard to the methylation status of p15/CDKN2b, p16/CDKN2a and E-cadherin promoter regions. 14 , 12 Observed results were concordant with reported data: promoters for p15/CDKN2b and p16/CDKN2a are unmethylated in HL-60 cells and methylated in KG1a cells ( Fig. 4 ). Methylation-specific PCR results. MS-PCR results for p15/CDKN2b and p16/CDKN2a after bisulfite treatment with wild-type primer (lanes 1 and 4), methylated (lanes 2 and 5) and unmethylated (lanes 3 and 6) primer sets on genomic DNA extracted from cell lines HL-60 and KG1a. m = marker; amplified fragment length = ~150 bp.Methylation-specific PCR results.

Genomic DNA hybridization Microarray capture oligonucleotides and restriction enzymes were designed to bind and cut exactly the same CpG islands detected by MS-PCR. Mnl I digest result in a 147 bp fragment for p15/CDKN2b and a 111 bp fragment for p16/CDKN2a including the region amplified by MS-PCR. Mnl I digest concerning E-cadherin results in a 105 bp fragment in the preproprotein region for E-cadherin, a hypermethylated CpG region in certain tumors. 21 Genomic DNA was digested with Mnl I over night at 37°C, checked on agarose gels, quantified, split and used for MS-PCR analysis as well as for hybridization experiments in parallel. Experiments consisted of the hybridization with 1.5 µg DNA, representing 3 × 10 5 cells, on individual microarray slides with p15/CDKN2b, p16/CDKN2a and E-cadherin capture oligonucleotides. Each microarray subgrid contained 15 identical spots per gene, and negative (nonsense oligonucleotide) and positive control spots (33mer, see Table 1 and Fig. 5 first two lines left). Data analysis relying on 45 single spots from three successive hybridization experiments represented a reliable number of data for adequate statistical analysis. Original microarray scans of genomic DNA hybridization after immunoassaying for p15/CDKN2b, p16/CDKN2a and E-cadherin promoter methylation are shown in Fig. 5 . Spot signal quantification and data analysis revealed a clear discrimination between methylated and unmethylated promoter DNA for all three genes selected. Mean fluorescence intensities of promoter regions from p15/CDKN2b (mfi/SD 222/33) and p16/CDKN2a (mfi/SD 159/34) from HL-60 cells showed significantly lower signals than from KG1a with p15/CDKN2b (mfi/SD 672/130) and p16/CDKN2a (mfi/SD 568/138) ( P < 0.0001 in both cases), whereas E-cadherin promoter region displayed inversed measures with significantly higher methylation signals in HL-60 (mfi/SD 183/23) than in KG1a (mfi/SD 63/4) ( P < 0.0001) and reduced CpG methylation density compared to p15/CDKN2b and p16/CDK2a. The intra-assay analytical correlation of variance for p15/CDKN2b was 8.5%, for p16/CDKN2a 10.0% and for E-cadherin 7.6%. The overall consistency expressed as inter-assay variability between hybridization experiments was 15% on average, showing that the presented microarray experiments met general MIAME quality criteria. 22 Microarray methyl-cytosine immunodetection on genomic DNA.

Unlike other currently used methods, such as bisulfite conversion dependent MS-PCR or microarray techniques which focus on sequence details within individual primer pairs or capture oligonucleotide sequences, the presented method is capable of detecting all methylated cytosines per hybridized DNA fragment at once. Moreover our approach can be used for any region of the genome whether or not methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme sites are present. Practically, as a consequence of target DNA length (less than few hundred nucleotides), hybridization specificity can be optimized with the possibility to reduce the capture oligonucleotide numbers significantly compared with other microarray techniques for DNA methylation analysis.4. ConclusionWe have examined the feasibility of a novel microarray for 5'mC detection using immunofluorescence measurement. This method combines the advantages of microarray technology (high-throughput), fluorescence detection (high sensitivity) and immunolabeling (high specificity) and might become an adequate tool for investigating DNA methylation in various scientific fields.This project was supported by the Austrian Federal Ministry for Education, Science and Culture in the context of the Gen-AU project ‘Ultra sensitive Proteomics and Genomics’.
