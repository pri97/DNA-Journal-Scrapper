By the EST mapping of 30,683 long cDNAs in silico , 603 cDNA sequences were found to locate on chromosome 22 and classified into 169 clusters. Comparison of the genomic loci of these cDNA sequences with 679 genes already annotated on chromosome 22q revealed that 46 clusters represented newly identified transcribed sequences. To further characterize these sequences, we sequenced 12 cDNAs in their entirety out of 46 clusters. Of these 12 cDNAs, 6 were predicted to include a protein-coding region while the remaining 6 were unlikely to encode proteins. Interestingly, 3 out of the 12 cDNAs had the nucleotide sequences of the opposite strands of the genes previously annotated, which suggested that these genomic regions were transcribed bi-directionally. In addition to these newly identified 12 cDNAs, another 12 cDNAs were entirely sequenced since these cDNAs were likely to contain new information about the predicted protein-coding sequences previously annotated. In the cases of KIAA1670 and KIAA1672, these single cDNA sequences covered two separately annotated transcribed regions. For example, the sequence of a clone for KIAA1670 indicated that the CHKL and CPT1B genes were co-transcribed as a contiguous transcript without making both the protein-coding regions fused. In conclusion, the mapping of ESTs derived from long cDNAs followed by sequencing of the entire cDNAs provided indispensable information for the precise annotation of genes on the genome together with ESTs derived from short cDNAs.

The phytopathogenic bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens is unique in that it possesses both linear and circular DNA chromosomes in addition to a plant-tumor-inducing (Ti) plasmid. We analyzed the two chromosomal DNA molecules in strain MAFF301001, whose Ti plasmid has already been sequenced completely. Physical maps of the chromosomal DNAs were constructed by Southern hybridization experiments using Pme I and Swa I fragments and short fragments bridging the Swa I fragments with special care to avoid any missing fragment. Hybridization with 16S rDNA probe showed one rDNA locus on the linear chromosome and two loci on the circular chromosome. For this bacterium to be pathogenic, not only Ti plasmid but also chromosomal genes are required. The chromosomal virulence ( chv ) genes ( chvA , chvB , chvD , chvE , chvG , chvH , and chvI ) and the chromosomal genes affecting the virulence [ acvB , pgm ( exoC ), glgP , miaA , and ros ] were successfully mapped onto 5 different regions in the chromosomal physical maps. These chv genes and the chromosomal genes affecting the virulence other than pgm and glgP were found on the circular chromosome, whereas the pgm and glgP genes were located on the linear chromosome. In contrast to the large terminal inverted repeats of Streptomyces linear chromosomal DNA, no hybridization signal was detected between left and right terminal fragments of the linear A. tumefaciens chromosome. Quantitative analysis of DNA fragments indicated that the copy numbers of the two chromosomal DNAs and the Ti plasmid are identical. "

Since many of the JRGs reported so far have been identified in leaf tissues, the cDNA clones used were chosen from a non-redundant EST library that was prepared from above-ground organs. Hybridization to the filters was achieved using α- 33 P-labeled single-strand DNAs synthesized from mRNAs obtained from methyl jasmonate (MeJA)-treated and untreated Arabidopsis seedlings. Data analysis identified 41 JRGs whose mRNA levels were changed by more than three fold in response to MeJA. This was confirmed by Northern blot analysis by using eight representatives. Among the 41 JRGs identified, 5 genes were JA biosynthesis genes and 3 genes were involved in other signaling pathways (ethylene, auxin, and salicylic acid).

This value is over 3 Mb longer than that previously estimated by the Arabidopsis Genome Initiative ( Nature , 408, 796–815, 2000).

Interestingly, the extra sequences in these ATLN-L members have another open reading frame, designated as orf3 . Each member is flanked by direct repeats of a target site sequence, showing that ATLN-L members with the three open reading frames have retrotransposed as a unit. The ATLN-L members are also distinct from other ATLN members: orf1 terminates with TAA (or TAG) and is located in the same frame as orf2 , and the ATG initiation codon of orf2 is not present in the proximal region. A sequence that may form a pseudoknot structure in ATLN-L mRNA was present in the proximal region of orf2 , therefore the TAA (or TAG) termination codon of orf1 is assumed to be suppressed to produce an Orf1-Orf2 transframe protein during the translation of the ATLN-L mRNA. The region between orf2 and orf3 is several hundred bp long, suggesting that orf3 expression is independent of orf1-orf2 . The amino acid sequences of the proteins Orf1 and Orf3 are highly homologous in their N-terminal half regions that have a retroviral zinc-finger motif for RNA binding. Orf3, however, has a leucine-zipper motif in addition to the zinc-finger motif. The C-terminal regions of the Orf1 and Orf3 proteins have poor homology, but seem to have nuclear localization signals, suggesting that these proteins are involved in the transfer of ATLN-L mRNA to nuclei. A phylogenetic tree shows that Orf3 proteins form a branch distinct from the branches of the Orf1 proteins encoded by ATLN-L members.

Using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with BAC clones from Gifu B-129 and TAC (Transformation-competent Artificial Chromosome) clones from Miyakojima MG-20, a reciprocal translocation was found to be responsible for the cytological differences between chromosomes 1 and 2. The borders of the translocations were identified by FISH and by alignment toward the L. filicaulis × L. japonicus Gifu B-129 linkage map.
