IntroductionPlant mitochondrial genomes have several major differences compared with those of vertebrates and other animals: large sizes, the presence of plasmid-like DNA, ongoing and sometimes frequent functional gene transfer to the nucleus, horizontal transfer between more or less distantly related plants, and unusual modes of gene expression such as RNA editing and trans-splicing.1 The relatively large mitochondrial genomes of land plants encode several genes that are not found in the mitochondrial genomes of most other organisms.2 In addition, plant mitochondrial genomes often contain open reading frames (ORFs) of unknown function. Some of these ‘unidentified ORFs’ have been subsequently been identified as functional genes, e.g. atp4, atp8, sdh3, and sdh4.3–5 In addition to these cases, ORFs conserved across plant species have been reported in a number of cases, some of which are transcribed and might be functional.6,7 However, most such conserved ORFs still remain to be assigned to any known genes.Here, we report a new case of gene identification: the conservation and expression of a gene that encodes ribosomal protein L10 (rpl10) in plant mitochondria. In bacteria, the rpl10 gene is present within a cluster encoding RPL11, RPL1, RPL10, and RPL7/RPL12.8 Cyanobacterial genomes also have an rpl10 gene but no equivalent gene has been found in chloroplast genomes.9 To date, across all of many sequenced mitochondrial genomes of diverse eukaryotes, an rpl10 gene has been identified only in the exceptionally and primitively gene-rich mitochondrial genome of the protist Reclinomonas americana.10,11 The counterpart to this gene is present in the nuclear genome in yeast and mammals.12,13 In contrast, no mitochondrial-type rpl10 gene has yet been reported in either the mitochondrial or nuclear genome of any plant species.In this study, we present several lines of evidence that together strongly indicate that one of the conserved ORFs present in the mitochondrial genome of diverse plant species corresponds to a functional rpl10 gene. Results from this study also indicate that mitochondrial rpl10 gene has been lost in monocots and some Brassicaceae lineages, and replaced by an extra copy of the nuclear gene that normally encodes chloroplast RPL10 protein.2. Materials and methods2.1. Sequence analysis and database searchSequences homologous to orf168 of Marchantia polymorpha mitochondria DNA14 were searched by Blast algorithm via the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) website (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). Genes for chloroplast rpl10 were searched in the NCBI database using sequences of Arabidopsis (locus tag: At5g13510) and Oryza (Os03g0284400) as queries. Nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences were aligned manually with BioEdit ver. 7.0.5.3.15 A sequence alignment of chloroplast RPL10 (Supplementary Fig. S2) was used for construction of a neighbour-joining (NJ) phylogenetic tree after removing gaps and poorly conserved regions. The NJ tree was constructed using ClustalW ver. 1.83 via a DNA Data Bank of Japan website (http://clustalw.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/top-e.html). Bootstrap values were computed from 1000 replicates.2.2. Plant materials and nucleic acid extractionLeaves of Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa, line ANF3-1), cycad (Cycas revoluta), grape (Vitis labrusca cv. Delaware), papaya (Carica papaya), rice (Oryza sativa subsp. japonica cv. Nipponbare), tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum cv. SR1), and tomato [Solanum lycopersicum cv. Saturn (Takii & Seed Co., Kyoto, Japan)] and thalli of liverwort (M. polymorpha) and hornwort (Megaceros flagellaris) were used for plant materials. Total DNA and total RNA were extracted with DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) and RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen), respectively.2.3. Reverse transcription–PCR analysisTotal RNA (0.5 µg) was treated with RNase-free DNase I (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland). First-strand cDNAs were synthesized using random hexamer primers and the Advantage RT-for-PCR Kit (Takara Bio, Otsu, Japan) as described previously.16 The resulting cDNAs were used for PCR amplifications with a primer pair P1–P2 in Carica, Nicotiana, and Vitis. Primer pairs P1–P3, P1–P4, and P1–P5 were used in Oryza, Brassica, and Cycas, respectively. The PCR products were cloned into a pCR-XL-TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and 12–14 independent cDNA clones were sequenced for each species to detect any potential RNA editing events.2.4. Construction and visualization of green fluorescent protein fusion proteinsSequences encoding the first 71 and 45 residues of chloroplast-like RPL10 in Arabidopsis (At3g12370) and Oryza (Os05g0121500) were amplified by PCR with primer pairs P6–P7 and P8–P9, respectively, and fused in-frame with the 5'-upstream region of a synthetic green fluorescent protein (GFP)17 (kindly provided by Dr Y. Niwa). The resultant constructs were introduced into Arabidopsis epidermal cells using a PDS-1000 particle delivery system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Mitochondria were labelled with an mt-DsRed construct, in which the GFP ORF in a pWS plasmid (carrying a presequence of Arabidopsis F1-ATPase d, kindly provided by Prof. W. Sakamoto) was replaced by DsRed (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA). Transient expression of the introduced proteins and chloroplast autofluorescence were visualized with a confocal spectral laser scanning microscope Nikon C1Si (Nikon Corporation, Chiyoda-ku, Japan), as reported previously.182.5. Oligonucleotide primersPrimers used in this study are as follows. Small letters represent nucleotide deviations to introduce NcoI and SalI restriction sites (underlines).

Results and discussion3.1. A sequence homologous to orf168 in Marchantia mitochondrial DNA is conserved across diverse plant speciesAn unidentified orf168 was reported in the Marchantia mitochondrial genome.14 An homologous sequences has since been reported in the mitochondrial genomes of two other bryophytes (Megaceros and Physcomitrella) and two angiosperms (Nicotiana and Vitis), termed ORF-bryo1, orf187, orf159b, and orf159, respectively.7,19–21 These conserved ‘orf168-related sequences’ are currently annotated as unknown ORFs, with no evident correspondence to any characterized proteins. We searched for homologues of the Marchantia orf168 by a Blast search and found 10 additional homologous sequences in the mitochondrial DNAs of diverse plant groups. Altogether, sequences homologous to the orf168 have now been found in 15 plant species: two green algae (Chaetosphaeridium and Chara),22,23 three bryophytes (Marchantia, Megaceros, and Physcomitrella),7,14,20 one gymnosperm (Cycas),24 and nine angiosperms (Bambusa, Brassica, Carica, Helianthus, Nicotiana, Oryza, Solanum, Tripsacum, and Vitis)19,21,25–27 [Allen et al., unpublished (accession no.

The complete ORF has been determined in this study (accession no.

This suggests that an ancestral, green-plant gene cluster including the orf168-homologue was destroyed, and each gene within the cluster was dispersed throughout the genome during the evolution of seed plants, as reported by Li et al.7 and as found for many other mitochondrial genes in angiosperm.Mitochondrial genome organization in the vicinity of ORFs that are homologous to orf168 of Marchantia polymorpha mitochondrial DNA.

Although it has not directly shown that these sequences represent transcripts from mitochondrial genes, their high degree of sequence conservation (84–99%; Supplementary Fig. S1) suggests, in light of the generally much lower rate of nucleotide substitutions in plant mitochondrial than nuclear genomes,28,29 that they probably are mitochondrial gene products.3.2. The orf168-homologues conserved in plant mitochondria are homologous to ribosomal protein L10An alignment of protein sequences predicted from the orf168-homologues is shown in Fig. 2. These sequences are relatively well conserved despite a few insertions/deletions in their central region. The C-terminal region is more divergent with respect to both sequence and length variation. The sequences in Bambusa, Brassica, and Oryza (and possibly Raphanus) are probably pseudogenes, as they have frame-shift mutations or are severely truncated (Fig. 2, slashes and lower case letters, and also see Supplementary Fig. S1 for Raphanus). Chaetosphaeridium and Tripsacum were omitted from the sequence alignment of Fig. 2 and from further analysis because the homologous sequence in Chaetosphaeridium was greatly diverged and because Tripsacum retains only a short stretch of rpl10 (Table 1).Alignment of amino acid sequences between previously characterized RPL10 proteins and the ORFs conserved in plant mitochondria.

We believe that this level of similarity is significant, i.e. is indicative of evolutionary homology/common descent, for the following reasons. First, the database search also detected a conserved domain of the ribosomal L10-P0 superfamily (ID: cd00379 at Conserved Domain Database, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/cdd.shtml) within the Physcomitrella sequence. Second, manual sequence alignment between the already-characterized RPL10 (Fig. 2, upper five sequences) and the proteins predicted from the orf168 homologues (Fig. 2, lower) confirmed that several amino acid residues were clearly conserved between the two sequence groups (Fig. 2, asterisks). Third, the average length of the ORF168 homologues in plant mitochondria is (except for pseudogene sequences) 165 amino acids, which is quite similar to the length of bacterial RPL10. Fourth, the level of amino acid identity/similarity between the plant ORFs and bacterial RPL10 proteins is similar to that observed between Reclinomonas and bacterial RPL10 proteins (24% identity, 47% similarity). Finally, this level of conservation is similar to that observed for many mitochondrial ribosomal proteins and their bacterial counterparts (e.g. RPS4 and RPS8;30 also see Table in Hao and Palmer31). Given all this, we conclude that orf168 and its homologues in plant mitochondrial genomes are likely to function as the mitochondrial rpl10 gene in plants. Therefore, these ORFs will be designated as ‘mitochondrial rpl10 genes’ hereafter.3.3. Plant mitochondrial rpl10 genes are transcribed and RNA editedThe expression of plant mitochondrial rpl10 was examined by reverse transcription (RT)–PCR. Transcripts from rpl10 were detected in all nine species investigated: two bryophytes (Marchantia and Megaceros), one gymnosperm (Cycas), and six angiosperms (Brassica, Carica, Nicotiana, Oryza, Solanum, and Vitis) (data not shown). Sequencing of five of the seed plant cDNAs revealed 3, 9, 5, 5, and 10 sites of C-to-T RNA editing in Cycas, Carica, Nicotiana, Solanum, and Vitis, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S1, Supplementary Table S1). These RNA editing events result in three, seven, four, three, and seven amino acid changes in the predicted proteins, respectively (Fig. 2, red letters), five positions of which clearly improve the similarity in the alignment (Fig. 2, filled triangles). RNA editing events are observed preferentially in protein-coding regions of land plant mitochondria at first and second positions in codons and tend to improve the level of protein sequence conservation.32,33 Seed plant rpl10 shows the same pattern of RNA editing, and therefore these results strongly indicate that the rpl10 gene is probably functional in the mitochondrion of these plants. In contrast, no RNA editing was detectable in the transcripts of Brassica and Oryza, which is consistent with the conclusion drawn in the preceding section that these are probably pseudogenes.3.4. Loss of functional mitochondrial rpl10 gene and occurrence of an extra chloroplast-type rpl10 gene in angiospermsAs described above, mitochondrial rpl10 gene appears to be a pseudogene in Bambusa, Brassica, and Oryza, whereas no vestige of rpl10 was found in the complete mitochondrial genome sequences of five angiosperms (Arabidopsis, Beta, Sorghum, Triticum, and Zea) and 12 green algae (Chlamydomonas, Chlorogonium, Chlorokybus, Mesostigma, Nephroselmis, Oltmannsiellopsis, Ostreococcus, Pedinomonas, Prototheca, Pseudendoclonium, Scenedesmus, and Volvox) (see Supplementary data for references). Moreover, for three of these plants (Arabidopsis, Oryza, and Sorghum; the latter genome represented by a draft genome sequence), there is no evidence of a mitochondrial-type rpl10 gene in both the nuclear genome and in extensive cDNA datasets. Therefore, it is likely that rpl10 genes of mitochondrial origin have been completely lost in these species. This is somewhat surprising, as the preponderance of genes that have been lost from mitochondrial genomes in angiosperms have been functionally transferred to the nucleus.34We hypothesized that the RPL10 protein might be supplied by a homologous nuclear gene of chloroplast origin, as found for cases of organellar loss of the rps13 gene.35,36 It has been shown that the rpl10 gene of chloroplast origin has been transferred to the nuclear genome in Arabidopsis and Oryza.37 Our database search showed that sequences homologous to this chloroplast-type rpl10 are present in many other land plants (Supplementary Fig. S2). All of these genes are probably located in the nucleus because the rpl10 gene is absent from all chloroplast genomes sequenced to date in land plants. Interestingly, monocots and Brassicaceae species harbour a second copy of the chloroplast-type rpl10 (Supplementary Fig. S2, lower), in addition to the putatively original copy that is widely present and conserved among land plants (Supplementary Fig. S2, upper). A phylogenetic analysis showed that the ‘extra’ copies of the chloroplast-type rpl10 gene in monocots and Brassicaceae form two independent clusters, each separated from all other examined genes by long branches (Fig. 3, shaded). This result suggests that the extra copy has diverged rapidly compared with the original chloroplast-type gene. Judging from their position in the rpl10 phylogeny, the two extra clades of genes may have originated by independent gene duplication events in monocots and Brassicaceae.Independent origins of the mitochondrial rpl10 genes in monocots and Brassicaceae from their respective chloroplast counterparts. An NJ phylogenetic tree is based on chloroplast-type RPL10 protein sequences. Accession numbers of cDNAs and locus tags of genome sequences are shown in brackets following each genus name. When the corresponding sequences are unannotated in the draft genome sequences, their locations are specified by the linkage group, chromosome number, or contig name together with their nucleotide coordinates. The Marchantia sequence was used as an outgroup. The ‘second’ copy of chloroplast RPL10 in monocots and Brassicaceae is shaded. Note that sequences homologous to the second copy of chloroplast RPL10 (At3g12370 and Os05g0121500 in Arabidopsis and Oryza, respectively) were also found in Hordeum, Musa, Panicum, Raphanus, and Triticum, but they are not included in the NJ tree because of incompleteness of their coding regions. Numbers on the nodes are bootstrap values (>80%) from 1000 replicates.

The chloroplast-derived rpl10 in Arabidopsis and Oryza undergoes dual-targeting into chloroplasts and mitochondriaThe alignment of the chloroplast-type RPL10 revealed that the N-terminal sequence of the second copy is totally different from that of the original copy (Supplementary Fig. S2) and is also non-homologous even between the monocots and Brassicaceae groups. Because the N-terminal region generally serves as a protein targeting signal, the distinct N-terminal sequences of the second set of RPL10 proteins may imply a difference of their targeting property. Proteome analyses in Arabidopsis and Spinacia have shown that the original, widely present chloroplast-type RPL10 is indeed targeted to chloroplasts, whereas cleavage of the N-terminal transit peptide region has been observed in Spinacia.38,39 In contrast, no such information has been obtained for the second copy of this gene. The second copy may have a short or no cleavable targeting sequence at its N-terminal region, considering the position of the cleavage site of the original copy (Supplementary Fig. S2, bent arrow). Protein localization predictions with Predotar, TargetP, and WoLF Psort40–42 provided contradictory results with respect to this second copy (data not shown). Therefore, we examined its subcellular localization in vivo using GFP. A fusion protein containing GFP and the N-terminal region of the second chloroplast-type RPL10 copy from Arabidopsis was clearly localized to mitochondria (Fig. 4B–D, and yellow arrowhead), suggesting its mitochondrial localization in vivo. In addition, however, GFP signals were also detected in chloroplasts (Fig. 4A, B, D, and pink arrowhead). Similar results were obtained using the Oryza sequence (Fig. 4F–H and E, F, and H, respectively). Therefore, the second chloroplast-derived RPL10 proteins in Arabidopsis and Oryza seem to undergo dual-targeting into both organelles. Dual-targeting has been found for a number of plant organellar proteins,43 including one other ribosomal protein (S16).44Subcellular localization in Arabidopsis leaf epidermal cells of GFP fusion proteins having the N-terminal portion of the second chloroplast-like RPL10 copy from Arabidopsis (A–D) and rice (E–H).

Evolution of mitochondrial rpl10 in plantsOn the basis of the data obtained in this study, we propose a model (Fig. 5) for the evolution of the mitochondrial rpl10 gene. This gene was originally present only in the mitochondrial genome (Fig. 5A). It was lost from the mitochondrial genome early in the evolution of most eukaryotic lineages (e.g. animals, fungi, and most protists), but has been retained in mitochondria of the protist Reclinomonas and certain plants. Indeed, many diverse plants (both land plants and charophytic green algae) still possess an intact and probably functional rpl10 gene in their mitochondrial genomes. In contrast, the chloroplast rpl10 gene was transferred to the nucleus early in eukaryotic evolution, as no green plant chloroplast genomes still contain this gene (GOBASE: The Organelle Genome Database, http://gobase.bcm.umontreal.ca/index.php).A model for the evolution of rpl10 genes of mitochondrial and chloroplast origin. Three predicted evolutionary stages with regard to the mitochondrial rpl10 gene (A–C) are shown. The proposed evolutionary direction is indicated with thick arrows. Nucleus, mitochondrion, and chloroplast are represented by an octagon, a rounded rectangle, and an oval, respectively. An intact gene, a pseudogene, and loss of the gene are denoted with a plus (+), <U+03C8>, and a minus (-), respectively. The second copy of the nuclear gene encoding chloroplast RPL10 is shown by a circled plus sign. Targeting of proteins produced by the nuclear-encoded genes is indicated with arrows. Genera possibly or ambiguously belong to each of the three stages are shown in parentheses or by a double-headed arrow.A model for the evolution of rpl10 genes of mitochondrial and chloroplast origin.

Genera possibly or ambiguously belong to each of the three stages are shown in parentheses or by a double-headed arrow.Subsequently, a duplication of the nuclear-located, chloroplast-derived rpl10 gene occurred (actually, probably separate duplications in monocots and in Brassicaceae), whose protein product appears to functionally compensate for mitochondrial RPL10 in certain plants. The mitochondrial rpl10 gene has become a pseudogene in some plants (Fig. 5B) and has been entirely lost from the mitochondrial genome in others (Fig. 5C). Extensive cDNA and nuclear genomic sequence data suggest that monocots and Brassicaceae no longer contain mitochondrial rpl10 in any genome. Our GFP assay demonstrated that the product of an extra copy of the nuclear gene for chloroplast RPL10 is imported into both mitochondria and chloroplasts in Arabidopsis and Oryza. These results strongly suggest that the mitochondrial RPL10 has been functionally replaced, probably twice independently, by the duplicated chloroplast counterpart in monocots and some Brassicaceae lineage. Functionality of the second copy in Raphanus is presently ambiguous, as all four homologous cDNAs of wild radish (R. raphanistrum) that are in GenBank (accession nos. EX746769, EX751093, FD961078, and FD965298) have either a frame-shift mutation or an internal stop codon. In this species, an additional copy of the second copy of the chloroplast-derived rpl10 gene may exist in the nuclear genome. A phylogenetic analysis of all available Brassicaceae cDNA sequences of the second copy does indeed suggest that it has been subject to further duplications in the Brassicaceae, including Raphanus (Supplementary Fig. S3).During the 17 years since the first complete mitochondrial genome was reported from plants, the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha,14 comparative genomic data have allowed the identification of a number of genes that were previously known only as unidentified ORFs. In the case of ribosomal proteins, 16 ribosomal protein genes were initially identified in the Marchantia mitochondrial genome,30 and this is the first case of the subsequent identification of any new ribosomal protein genes in Marchantia or any other land plant mitochondrial genome.

IntroductionChloroplasts (cps) are plant organelles that contain biochemical machineries necessary to replicate and transcribe their own genomes. The cp genome of higher plants is a circular molecule of double-stranded DNA and highly conserved in terms of its structure and its gene content with the size ranging from 72 to 217 kb containing ~130 genes, depending on the plant species.1,2 A pair of large inverted repeats (IRs) that are usually 10–28 kb in length divides the genome into one large single-copy (LSC) region and one small single-copy (SSC) region. Despite high conservation of the cp genome, structural mutations such as gene duplications of tRNA genes,3ycf2, rpl19, rpl2, rpl234 and psbA;5 losses of ndh genes,6ycf genes, infA and accD;7–9 as well as rearrangements of cp genomes10 have been reported in plants and algae. The high level of cp genome rearrangement has been reported in specific lineages including green algae,11 Campanulaceae,12 Geraniaceae13 and Fabaceae.14Mungbean (Vigna radiata) is an important economical crop and a member of the Fabaceae family, comprising of around 20 000 species. To date, there are six complete legume cp genomes reported: Cicer arietinum15Trifolium subterraneum,16Phaseolus vulgaris,17Lotus japonicus,18Glycine max19 and Medicago truncatula (AC093544, unpublished). Cp genomes of plants in the Fabaceae family are known to have undergone more rearrangements than other angiosperms.15–20 Palmer and Thompson reported the complete loss of the IR in a group of legume species, such as species from the tribes Carmichaelieae, Cicereae, Hedysareae, Trifolieae, Vicieae and Galegeae.21–24 Furthermore, a common rearrangement that is shared in most papilionoid legumes is an inversion of a large segment of LSC region relative to all other land plants.15,20 Within the papilionoid tribe Phaseoleae, another large genome rearrangement in the LSC occurred in subtribe Phaseolinae such as Vigna and Phaseolus.14,25 Variations within cp genome sequences are useful for evolutionary studies from population-level processes to more distant phylogenetic relationships.24 Cp-derived markers, e.g. the matK gene and the trnL-trnF intergenic spacer, have been used to study the evolutionary relationship between legume plants.24,26–28 Repetitive sequences within the cp genomes are also potentially useful for ecological and evolutionary studies of plants.29 A high degree of length polymorphism at cp microsatellite loci has been reported in Pinus,30Glycine,31 rice32 and barley.33 Not only will the information from cp genomes be useful for studies of phylogenetic relationships, but it will also facilitate cp transformation in economically important crops. So far, G. max is the only legume in which cp genomes have been successfully transformed to express foreign genes.34,35Since the first report on the complete cp genome of Marchantia polymorpha,36 there are more than 150 complete cp genomes from plants and algae deposited in the GenBank so far. The traditional labour-intensive method for obtaining plastid genome sequence involves isolation of cp DNA followed by random shearing, cloning into BAC or Fosmid vector, and then shotgun sequencing. Recent methods based on long PCR amplification using the conserved cp primers,37–40 amplification of the entire genome using rolling circle amplification41,42 and high-throughput sequencing43–45 have been achieved for fast and cost-effective approaches for cp genome sequencing. In this work, we reported the use of 454 sequencing technology to obtain the genome sequence of mungbean cps for analysis of the structural organization and phylogenetic relationships.2. Materials and methods2.1 DNA sequencing, assembly and annotationThe DNA was isolated from 1 g of young leaves of 10-day-old V. radiata (L.) Wilczek accession KPS1 using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, CA, USA). The DNA (10 µg) was sheared by nebulization, subjected to 454 library preparation and shotgun sequencing using the Genome Sequencer (GS) FLX platform46 at the in-house facility (National Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Thailand). The obtained nucleotide sequence reads were assembled using the Newbler de novo sequence assembly software. The cp genome sequence was compared with the reference sequence from the complete cp genome of P. vulgaris using the Sequencher software (Gene Codes Corporation, MI, USA). Remaining gaps were closed by PCR and nucleotide sequencing using BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle sequencing kit. The primer pairs used for closing the gaps are (i) gap_LSCF: AAT TGG ATA GGA TGG CCT TTG, gap_LSCR: TAG CTC AGT TGG TAG AGC AGA GG; and (ii) gap_IRF: CTG TCC TAG TTG ATC CCG ATT C, gap_IRR: AGA GTG CTT TTT CGA TTC ATC C. For polymorphism test, DNA samples were isolated from young leaves of 10-day-old plants: five samples from V. radiata accessions H262 (India), H337 (Afghanistan), H412 (Madagascar), H417 (Nigeria) and KPS1 (Thailand); one sample from Vigna mungo accession Subsamotod (Thailand); one sample from Vigna umbellata accession JP99485 (Japan); and two samples from Vigna unguiculata accessions VU210 (Loas) and TVNU294 (Tanzania), using DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen).2.2 PCR amplificationPCR was carried out in a total volume of 20 µl containing 2 ng of DNA template, 1× buffer, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 1 U Phusion DNA polymerase (Finnzymes, Finland) and 0.5 µM each of forward and reverse primers. The junctions between LSC and IR were confirmed by PCR and nucleotide sequencing using the following primer pairs: (i) JL_F1: GTT TTC AAC AAA ACC CTC TCG T, JL_R1: CCT ACT CTA AAC TTC CGA GGA CA; and (ii) JL_F2: ACT CTA AAC TTC CGA GGA CAT GC, JL_R2: TTT ATC TCT CCA ATT CCC TCG AC. The junctions between SSC and IR were confirmed by PCR and nucleotide sequencing using the following primer pairs: (i) JS_F1: CAG CAA CAA CTG GGT TTA TTA CG, JS_R1: TAC TTT ATT CGT TGG GGC CAT AG; and (ii) JS_F2: CTC TTC CAT CAC CTT GAT ATG TAT G, JS_R2: GGG ACA GCT CAT AAT CTT CAT GT. Amplification was performed in a GeneAmp PCR 9700 System thermocycler (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA) programmed as follows: 94°C for 2 min followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 55°C for 1 min, 72°C for 3 min and a final extension step at 72°C for 10 min. Amplified products were run on either 1% agarose gel or 5% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and visualized by silver staining.2.3 Genome analysisThe genome was annotated using the program DOGMA (Dual Organellar GenoMe Annotator47). The predicted annotations were verified using BLAST similarity search.48 All genes, rRNAs and tRNAs were identified using the plastid/bacterial genetic code. Comparison of cp genome structures of Glycine,19Lotus,18Medicago [NC_003119], Phaseolus,17Cicer15 and Vigna (published here) was performed using the Mauve software.49 REPuter50 was used to identify and locate direct repeat, IR and reverse complement sequences with n= 30 bp and a sequence identity =90%.2.4 Phylogenetic analysisA set of 25 protein-coding genes including matK, petA, petB, petD, petG, petN, psaB, psbB, psbC, psbD, psbE, psbF, psbH, psbI, psbJ, psbK, psbN, psbT, rpoB, rpoC1, rpoC2, rps8, rps11, rps14 and ycf3, from 34 cp genomes representing all lineages of angiosperms, were analysed. These 25 genes are commonly present in all 34 cp genomes and publicly available in the GenBank database. Sequences were aligned using MUSCLE version 3.6,51 the alignment was edited manually. For maximum likelihood (ML) analysis, RAxML version 7.052 was used with the GTR matrix (GTR + G model). The local bootstrap probability of each branch was calculated by 100 replications. Phylogenetic analyses using maximum parsimony (MP) method was performed using PAUP version 4.0b10.53 MP searches included 1000 random addition replicates and a heuristic search using tree bisection and reconnection (TBR) branch swapping with the Multrees option. Bootstrap analysis was performed with 100 replicates with TBR branch swapping. TreeView54 was used for displaying and printing phylogenetic trees.3. Results and discussion3.1 Sequencing results and general featuresSequencing of V. radiata genomic DNA was carried out using 454 Life Sciences technology on the GS FLX system. A total of 932 958 quality filtered sequence reads were generated with the average read length of 217 bases covering 202 Mb. Assembly of the nucleotide sequence reads was performed to obtain non-redundant contigs and singlets using the Newbler, a de novo sequence assembly software. From the assembly analysis, three contigs were shown to be part of the cp genome by alignment with the P. vulgaris cp genome using the Sequencher software. These three contigs were assembled from 48 682 reads (5.22%) and the average genome sequencing depth of each nucleotide on the mungbean cp genome was 61.25×. There were three gaps locating in the non-coding regions in the LSC and IRs with sizes of 28 (at the position 15 597–15 624), 286 (at the position 83 732–84 017) and 286 bp (at the position 148 152–148 437), respectively. The 28-bp gap was a (TA)11 repeat between ndhJ and trnF-GAA. The 286-bp gaps were copies of <U+03A8>ycf2 present in IRa and IRb. These gaps were probably due to the lack of long sequencing reads that can resolve the locations of four copies of the ycf2 fragment during sequence assembly. These gaps were closed by PCR and nucleotide sequencing using BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle sequencing kit. There were no examples of cp DNA containing non-contiguous sequences that might indicate a nuclear location.Homopolymer is a stretch of the same nucleotide sequence which has been documented to contribute to technical sequencing errors when using 454 Life Science Technology.44,55 Throughout the mungbean cp genome, there are 205 homopolymers (n > 7 bp); 73 homopolymers were present in 20 protein-coding genes and 132 homopolymers were present in non-coding regions. Among the protein-coding genes, ycf1 contains the highest number of homopolymers (22), followed by rpoC2 (8), rpoC1 (6), matK (5) and ndhF (5). The Majority of homopolymers present in the 454 data set was 8 bp long (127), followed by 9 bp long (51). As the length of homopolymer increased, fewer numbers were identified. The longest homopolymer sequences were 13 bp long which only presented twice in the data set. Out of 205 homopolymers, 201 were poly(A/T) and 4 were poly(G/C). To determine the accuracy of these sequences, we performed nucleotide sequencing of all homopolymers that are longer than 7 bp using BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle sequencing kit (Supplementary Table S1). Although the homopolymer regions had a deep average sequencing depth of 74.6× and high-quality score of QV 64, we observed that 49 bases in 44 positions out of 1763 homopolymeric bases in 205 positions required correction. Of these, 12 positions were from homopolymers present in coding sequences and the other 32 positions were in non-coding regions. The complete cp genome sequence was reported in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank nucleotide sequence database (GQ893027).The complete cp genome size of mungbean is 151 271 bp including the LSC of 80 896 bp, the SSC of 17 427 bp and a pair of IRs of 26 474 bp each (Fig. 1). The mungbean cp genome size is in range with those from other angiosperms. The IRs span from rps19 to a portion of ycf1. The average AT content of the mungbean cp genome is 64.82%, consistent with the AT content reported for other plant cp genomes. The AT contents of the LSC and SSC regions are 67.4% and 71.35%, respectively, whereas that of the IR regions is 58.26%.Map of the V. radiata cp genome. The thick lines indicate the extent of the IRs (IRa and IRb) which separate the genome into SSC and LSC regions.

Genes outside the map are transcribed clockwise and those inside the map are transcribed counter clockwise. Genes containing introns and pseudogenes are marked with * and #, respectively.3.2 Genome content and organizationThe mungbean cp genome contains 108 unique genes including 29 tRNA genes, 4 rRNA genes and 75 predicted protein-coding genes (Table 1). In addition, there are 19 genes duplicated in the IR, making a total of 127 genes present in the mungbean cp genome. There are 18 genes containing one or more introns, 7 of these are tRNA genes and the other 11 genes are protein-coding genes. The trnK-UUU gene has the largest intron (2564 bp) where another gene, the matK gene, is present. There are unique 29 tRNA genes (7 tRNA genes duplicated in the IR) representing 20 amino acids identified in the genome (Table 2). On the basis of the sequences of protein-coding genes and tRNA genes within the cp genome, we were able to deduce the frequency of codon usage as summarized in Table 2. We observed that the codon usage was biased towards a high representation of A and T at the third codon position. Non-coding sequences, including intergenic spaces and introns, comprise about 41.45% of the mungbean cp genome, which is close to the proportion of non-coding sequences observed in other cp genomes.56–60 Two ycf genes (ycf15 and ycf68) are probably not functional in the mungbean cp genome due to the presence of premature stop codons. In several cp genomes, ycf15 and ycf68 have also been reported as non-functional genes.17,61,62 A comparison of gene content between the legumes with complete cp genome sequences and the Arabidopsis cp genome shows that rpl22 and infA are missing from all legumes.63,64 Phylogenetic analysis of the nuclear rpl22 gene suggested the transfer event to the nucleus occurred at an early stage of angiosperm evolution.64 The loss of infA from the cp genome to the nucleus has been reported to occur multiple times during the angiosperm evolution.9 The rps16 gene is probably non-functional in V. radiata since it contains three internal stop codons and its initial start codon is AGA. The rps16 gene is lost in other legumes such as Medicago and Cicer. On the basis of hybridization experiments using rps16 probe, at least 15 independent losses occurred in the tribe Phaseoleae alone.65 The mungbean rpl33 gene contains premature stop codons within the coding region and probably present as a pseudogene as in Phaseolus.17 Instead of a common ATG at the translation initiation site, the mungbean ndhD gene has an ACG codon which has also been observed in the cp genomes of Phaseolus, Lotus, Pisum, Glycine and Cicer. For ndhD transcripts, the ACG codon has been shown to convert to the AUG initiation site as reported in pea,66 leek,67 tobacco, spinach and snapdragon.68 It is likely that a similar role of RNA editing in translation process also occurs in mungbean cps.Genes present in the V. radiata cp genomeaGene containing two introns.bGene containing a single intron.cTwo gene copies in the IRs.dGene divided into two independent transcription units.Genes present in the V. radiata cp genomeaGene containing two introns.bGene containing a single intron.cTwo gene copies in the IRs.dGene divided into two independent transcription units.The codon–anticodon recognition pattern and codon usage for L. japonicus cp genomeNumerals indicate the frequency of usage of each codon in 26 274 codons in 82 potential protein-coding genes.The codon–anticodon recognition pattern and codon usage for L. japonicus cp genomeNumerals indicate the frequency of usage of each codon in 26 274 codons in 82 potential protein-coding genes.The cp genome structures of previously sequenced legumes (Glycine,19Lotus,18Medicago [NC_003119], Phaseolus17 and Cicer15) and Vigna as reported here were compared with the Arabidopsis cp genome as the reference sequence using the Mauve software49 (Fig. 2). Cp genomes of Medicago and Cicer have lost one copy of the IR and were grouped together in the IR-lacking clade. In mungbean, the border position between the IRa and LSC (JLA) is located in the intergenic region between rps19 and rps8, whereas the junction position between the IRb and LSC (JLB) is located in the intergenic region between rps19 and rps3. The locations of JLA and JLB in mungbean are similar to those in adzuki bean and common bean.14 In contrast, Glycine and Lotus cp genomes contain a small fragment of rps19 in the IR; therefore, rps19 is only present in the S10B Operon (on the JLB side).18 Shifts in the border positions between IRs and LSC at the JLA and JLB have been reported in several species of angiosperms, demonstrating that the IR/LSC boundaries are dynamic.Comparison of legume cp genomes with Arabidopsis cp DNA as a reference using MAUVE.

The boxes above the line represent DNA sequences in clockwise direction and those below the line represent DNA sequences in the anticlockwise direction. The gene names at the bottom indicate the boundaries of the boxes within the mungbean cp DNA.The mungbean cp genome, as in common with the Phaseolus cp genome, possesses two distinct rearrangements, a 50-kb inversion between accD/rps16 and rbcL/trnK-UUU, and a 78-kb rearrangement between trnH/rpl14 and rps19/rps8 (Fig. 2). The first inversion is common in papilionoid legumes indicating an early split in the diversification of papilionoid members.15,69,70 The second inversion is a distinct rearrangement which is found in subtribe Phaseolinae.14,20,25 It encompasses nearly the entire fragment of the LSC and disrupts the S10 operon. Perry et al.14 proposed that this rearrangement occurred after an expansion of the IR such that a copy of the rpl23-rpl2-rps19-rps3-rpl16-rpl14 genes were introduced in the IRs, followed by the deletion of original genes that became duplicated. Like adzuki bean and Phaseolus, the position IR borders of mungbean have expanded to include the entire rps19 gene when compared with the soybean IR borders. The expansion–contraction model suggested that the contraction did not trim the IR back to its original point as seen in soybean, but instead duplicated the entire rps19, leaving two copies in the IR.14 Therefore, evidence in the mungbean IR border also supports the expansion/contraction mechanism of this 78-kb rearrangement.3.3 Polymorphism test of the homopolymeric regions and repeated sequence analysisWe tested for sequence length polymorphism of 16 homopolymers among five accessions of V. radiata, two accessions of V. unguiculata (VU210 and TVNU294), one accession of V. mungo and one accession of V. umbellata (Supplementary Table S2 for details of the primers used, product size and distribution of polymorphism). We observed sequence length polymorphism in 15 loci among Vigna species. An example of polymorphic loci is illustrated in Fig. 3. These 15 primer pairs were able to detect a range of 2–4 alleles with a mean of 2.133 alleles per locus. The joint distribution of length variants at these 15 polymorphic loci in the cp DNA revealed five haplotypes among the four Vigna species (Supplementary Table S2). Although there was no polymorphism detected between varieties of V. radiata, interestingly, we observed polymorphism at the intra-specific level in V. unguiculata. This demonstrated that cp microsatellites reported in this study could provide an assay for detecting polymorphism at the population-level and for comparison of more distant phylogenetic relationships at the genus level or above. These cp microsatellites can also be useful in ecological and evolutionary studies because they are non-recombinant, haploid and uniparentally inherited.A representative microsatellite locus (Locus 113; forward primer 5'-GAA ACC CTT CCT GAA AAA TCC-3' and reverse primer 5'-TCT TTG ACG AAT GCA AGT GG-3') with polymorphism among Vigna species: V. radiata accessions KPS1, H262, H337, H412, H417, V. mungo accession Subsamotod, V. umbellata accession JP99485, V. unguiculata accessions VU210 and TVNU294.

PCR products were separated on 5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by silver staining.Analysis of the repeat sequences in the mungbean cp genome identified 22 direct repeats and 28 IRs of 30 bp or longer with a sequence identity of 90% (Table 3). Thirty repeats are 30–40 bp long, 11 repeats are 41–50 bp long, 4 repeats are 51–80 bp long and 5 repeats are longer than 80 bp. The longest direct repeat in mungbean cp DNA is a 287-bp duplication of an internal fragment of ycf2 (<U+03A8>ycf2) in the IRs which shared a very high sequence homology with those of G. max and P. vulgaris. Most of the direct repeats are distributed within the intergenic spacer regions, the intron sequences, and in the trnS, and ycf2 genes.A list of repeated sequences and their locations identified using REPuter with n= 30 bp, and a sequence identity =90% in the V. radiata cp genomeD, direct repeat; IR, inverted repeat; IGS, intergenic space.A list of repeated sequences and their locations identified using REPuter with n= 30 bp, and a sequence identity =90% in the V. radiata cp genomeD, direct repeat; IR, inverted repeat; IGS, intergenic space.3.4 Phylogenetic analysisOur phylogenetic data set included 25 protein-coding genes for 34 plant taxa (Supplementary Table S3), including 32 angiosperms and two outgroup gymnosperms (Pinus and Ginkgo). These 25 genes are commonly present in all the 34 cp genomes, therefore should reduce missing data from the sequence alignment. The sequence alignment that was used for phylogenetic analyses comprised 20 454 characters. MP analysis resulted in a single resolved tree with a length of 29 081, a consistency index of 0.4939 and a retention index of 0.6399 (Fig. 4). Bootstrap analyses indicated that there were 27 out of 31 nodes with values =95%, and 25 of these had a bootstrap value of 100%. ML analysis resulted in a single tree with -ln L = -166 999.997. ML bootstrap values were also high, with values of =95% for 29 of the 32 nodes, and 27 nodes with 100% bootstrap support. Both MP and ML trees had the same topologies which formed two major clades, monocots and eudicots. The trees revealed a monophyly of the monocots and eudicots where Ranunculales was placed as sister to the remaining eudicots. Within the eudicots, there were two major clades: rosids and asterids. Within the rosid clade, there were two major groups, the eurosids I and eurosids II which were sister to the Myrtales group. The placement of Cucumis has been problematic in previous reports.45,59 In some studies, Cucumis was placed with the Myrtales,45 or in the eurosids I.58,71,72 In our study, both MP and ML trees provided a strong support for the monophyly of the eurosids I clade because Cucumis is sister to the legume taxa. Among seven legumes with complete cp DNA sequences, Cicer, Medicago and Trifolium were grouped together as IR lacking millettioids clade (IRLC) and placed as sister to Lotus. IRLC members have been shown to form a monophyletic group supported by phylogenetic trees based on matK24 and nuclear rDNA sequences.73Vigna was sister to Phaseolus in the Phaseolinae subtribe and was sister to Glycine in the tribe Phaseoleae. A monophyletic group of the Phaseolinae subtribe was also supported by previously reported trees, based on the matK gene24 and a distinct 78-kb rearrangement of the cp genome.25The MP phylogenetic tree is based on 25 protein-coding genes from 34 plant taxa. The MP tree has a length of 29 081 with a consistency index of 0.4939 and a retention index of 0.6399. Numbers above node are bootstrap support values.

The approach has been demonstrated here as a fast and efficient way for obtaining organellar genomes. Gene content and structural organization of mungbean cp genome is similar to that of P. vulgaris, its relative in Phaseoleae. We determined the distribution and the location of repeated sequences in the V. radiata cp genome and explored the use of polymorphic microsatellites at the intra-and inter-specific levels among Vigna species. The proposed phylogenetic relationships among angiosperms, based on cp DNA sequences including those of mungbean cp DNA reported here, provided a strong support for a monophyletic group of the eurosid I and demonstrated a close relationship between Vigna and Phaseolus in the Phaseolinae subtribe.Supplementary DataSupplementary Data is available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingWe acknowledge funding support by the Genome Institute, National Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology.We are thankful to Prof. Srinives of Kasetsart University, Thailand, for providing samples of Vigna species used in this study and Dr Darin Kongkasuriyachai for reviewing the manuscript.Supplementary data"

IntroductionIn the interphase nucleus of metazoan cells, the DNA is organized in supercoiled loops anchored to a nuclear substructure commonly known as the nuclear matrix (NM) which is a non-soluble complex of ribonucleoproteins obtained after extracting the nucleus with non-ionic detergents, high salt and treatment with DNase.1,2 The exact composition of the NM is a matter of debate as some 400 proteins have been associated with this structure.3 The DNA is anchored to the NM by means of non-coding sequences of variable length known as matrix attachment regions (MARs). Yet, there is no consensus sequence for a priori identification of MARs, although they are generally rich in AT and repetitive sequences, and map to regions where the DNA is intrinsically curved or kinked and has a propensity for base unpairing.4 MARs are operationally classified into structural-constitutive, resistant to high-salt extraction and functional-facultative, non-resistant to high-salt extraction.5,6 Therefore, not all potential MARs are actually bound to the NM constituting true loop attachment regions (LARs).5 There is evidence that when multiple copies of a specific MAR are present, these are used in a selective fashion, indicating the adaptability of the MAR sequence to serve as anchor only under certain conditions.7 The higher-order structure of interphase and metaphase chromosomes is likely to be maintained by constitutive MARs.4,8 It has been suggested that the dynamic selectivity in the use of MARs as DNA anchors would modulate both the DNA loop average length and the stability of the topological relationships between DNA and the NM during development and cell differentiation.9,10 Only a very limited number of proteins have been identified that participate in sequence-specific binding of DNA to the NM.2,4 However, saturation experiments indicate the existence of some 150 000 salt-resistant DNA-binding sites per NM in rat hepatocytes,11 whereas the average DNA loop size in adult rat hepatocytes is 80–90 kb,12 and this figure is compatible with roughly 66 000 DNA loops per rat diploid genome.13 Therefore, given that there are no MAR consensus sequences, these facts imply that such DNA–NM interactions are the result of indirect readout effects between DNA and NM proteins and thus not equivalent to the direct readout interactions between transcription factors and specific DNA sequences.14 Such sequence-independent DNA–protein interactions depend on DNA shape and overall DNA mechanical properties such as curvature, helical twist and bending and torsional flexibilities,15 therefore the local topology (spatial configuration) of the DNA involved must be a determining factor.16 Fundamental processes of nuclear physiology such as DNA replication, transcription and processing of primary transcripts occur at macromolecular complexes or factories organized on the NM.17–19 Thus, the topological relationship between the DNA loops and the NM appears to be very important for appropriate nuclear physiology. Indeed, correct repair of DNA damage must include the recovery of both the double helix integrity and the complex three-dimensional DNA topology; otherwise, the cell will not survive.20,21Varied approaches have been used for establishing the DNA loop organization in a given region of the genome, based on the experimental22–26 or the in silico identification of MARs27 which has been shown to be quite unreliable in the absence of experimental confirmation,28 and more recently on a combination of both approaches coupled to high-throughput analytical techniques.29,30 All these methods have their specific advantages and pitfalls, but all of them have as priority the identification of the actual MARs (LARs) in a given DNA region so as to infer from such data the possible DNA loop organization. However, considering that DNA is a continuous helical string that becomes looped by binding to the NM, thus establishing a topological higher-order in third-dimensional space, it follows from elementary topological considerations that by mapping the relative positions to the NM of several points (i.e. DNA sequences) along a given string of DNA whose whole sequence is known, it will be possible to establish the spatial configuration of the loops formed by such a DNA string without the need of characterizing the LARs involved. We have previously developed a method for mapping the position of any DNA sequence relative to the NM based on the direct use of PCR on NM-bound templates.31 An extension of this method, described hereunder, was used for determining the structural DNA loop organization in a region of 162 kb in chromosome 14 of the rat where four closely related genes that are members of the albumin gene family are located. Such a characterization was done in nucleoids which consist of the NM plus the naked DNA loops attached to it, obtained from freshly isolated hepatocytes and naïve B-lymphocytes from the rat and so the resulting DNA loop organization very likely corresponds to the actual in vivo organization.2. Materials and methods2.1. AnimalsMale Wistar rats weighing 200–250 g were used in accordance with the official Mexican norm for production, care and use of laboratory animals (NOM-062-ZOO-1999).2.2. Primary cellsPrimary rat hepatocytes were obtained from livers of male Wistar rats, using the protocol described previously.6 Briefly, the livers were washed in situ by perfusion with PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+ (PBS-A) at 37°C for 5 min at 15 ml/min. Next, the tissue was perfused with a solution of collagenase IV, Sigma (0.025% collagenase with 0.075% CaCl2 in HEPES buffer, pH 7.6) for 8 min. Viable hepatocytes were counted in a haemocytometer and used immediately for preparing nucleoids (see below). Primary naïve B-lymphocytes were obtained from the spleen of male Wistar rats. Briefly, the spleen was fragmented and filtered in PBS-A. Total lymphocytes were isolated in preformed gradients of isotonic Percoll (25%) by centrifugation at 2100 rpm 15 min at room temperature. Subsequently, naïve B-lymphocytes were purified by magnetic separation (MACS Separation columns, Miltenyi Biotec) with anti-CD43-specific beads (rat CD43 microbeads, Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Viable B-lymphocytes were counted in a haemocytometer and used immediately for preparing nucleoids.2.3. Preparation of nucleoidsThe DNA loops plus the nuclear substructure constitute a ‘nucleoid’, a very large nucleoprotein aggregate generated by gentle lysis of a cell at pH 8 in non-ionic detergent and the presence of high-salt concentration. Nucleoids were prepared as described previously.21,31 Briefly, freshly isolated and washed hepatocytes and naïve B-lymphocytes are suspended in ice-cold PBS-A, and aliquots of 50 µl containing 3 × 105 hepatocytes or 5 × 105 lymphocytes are gently mixed with 150 µl of a lysis solution containing 2.6 M NaCl, 1.3 mM EDTA, 2.6 mM Tris, 0.6% Triton-X 100 (pH 8.0). After 20 min for hepatocytes and 15 min for native B-lymphocytes (at 4°C), the mixture is washed in 14 ml of PBS-A at 4°C for 4 min at 3000 rpm (1500 g). The pellet is recovered in a volume ranging from 200 to 300 µl.2.4. DNase I digestion of nucleoid samplesThe washed nucleoids are pooled for setting up the DNase I digestion curves (1.8 × 106 nucleoids of hepatocytes or 2.5 × 106 nucleoids of naïve B-lymphocytes in 1.2 ml of PBS-A) and mixed with 5 ml of DNase I digestion buffer (10 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM dithiothreitol, 50 mM Tris at pH 7.2). Digestions were carried out at 37°C with 0.5 U/ml DNase I (Sigma). Each digestion time-point aliquot contains 3 × 105 nucleoids of hepatocytes or 5 × 105 nucleoids of B-lymphocytes. Digestion reactions were stopped by adding 200 µl of stop buffer (final EDTA concentration of 30 mM). The stop buffer contains 0.2 M EDTA and 10 mM Tris at pH 7.5. After digestion with DNase I, the NM-bound DNA was determined by spectrometry on aliquots of partially digested nucleoid samples that were washed and further handled as described previously.31 The final nucleoid pellet was re-suspended in 200 µl of double-distilled H2O to be used directly as a template for PCR.2.5. Genomic DNA primersDistinct sets of primers were designed for establishing the topological positions relative to the NM of 15 small DNA sequences located along 162 kb of the genomic region containing four members of the rat albumin gene family. Primer pairs were designed approximately 10 kb each in order to establish rather regular intervals along the region studied. We took into account important considerations in the oligonucleotide design so as to get primers with high specificity but able to perform efficient DNA amplification under the same PCR conditions (reactants concentrations, temperatures, times of each step and number of cycles). It is important to remark that MARs are not suitable targets for high-quality primer design, because their characteristic composition (richness of A-T tracks and repetitive DNA) prevents an acceptable design. Therefore, both potential and actual MARs within the chosen region are likely to be excluded by our primer-design algorithms. All primer sets were designed with a length of 20–25 bp, G-C content between 50% and 55% (with a difference <3%), Tm of 55–60°C (with a difference <2°C), and PCR products of 250–550 bp (Table 1). Secondary structures with <U+0394>G < -1 kcal/mol and dimmers/duplexes with <U+0394>G < -2 kcal/mol were avoided. Additionally, the specificity of each primer set was confirmed by the NCBI BLAST algorithm.Sets of primers and corresponding amplicon sizes defining 15 target sequences along the 162-kb genomic region containing members of the rat albumin gene familySets of primers and corresponding amplicon sizes defining 15 target sequences along the 162-kb genomic region containing members of the rat albumin gene family2.6. PCR amplificationFifty nanograms of NM-bound DNA was used as a template for PCR. PCR was carried out using 0.7 U GoTaq DNA polymerase (Promega), 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM of each dNTP and 0.1 µM of each primer. Amplification was performed in an Applied Biosystems 2720 thermocycler and the same amplification program was used for all pairs of primers: initial denaturising step at 94°C for 5 min, denaturising step at 94°C for 45 s, annealing at 56°C for 30 s and extension at 72°C for 1 min for 35 cycles, with a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. The identity of all the amplicons was confirmed by restriction analysis with the appropriate restriction enzymes. Amplicons were electrophoresed on 2% agarose gels and visualized using ethidium bromide staining (0.5 µl/ml), recorded and analyzed using a Kodak 1D Image Analysis Software 3.5 system. Amplicons were scored as positive or negative on partially digested nucleoid samples, depending on whether they are detectable by the software using the default settings.2.7. Computer-aided prediction of MAR sequencesThe potential MARs in the region studied were identified by in silico prediction using four different freely available software: MarFinder,32 MARScan,33 ChrClass34 and SMARtest.273. Results and discussion3.1. Rationale of the methodOur method exploits the topological properties of the average DNA loop that result from the fact that such loops are topologically constrained by being anchored to the NM, thus being equivalent to closed DNA circles. Under such a condition, the DNA molecule undergoes structural stress resulting from two factors: the covalently linked backbones of the DNA strands are helicoidal but rigid, and the low-energy hydrogen bonds between the stacked bases are quasi-statistical unions that continuously break apart and form again; such a situation poses the risk that the nucleotide bases may gyrate away from the double-helix axis and become exposed. DNA naturally solves this structural-stress problem by further coiling upon its own axis, thus avoiding the exposure of the nucleotide bases, but becoming negatively supercoiled in a similar fashion to a pulled house-telephone cord.35,36 Thus, the naked DNA loops display a gradient of supercoiling that goes from lower to higher from tip to base of the loop,36 save for the fact that the structural properties of MARs are such that they also function as buffers or sinks of negative supercoiling37,38 thus avoiding maximal supercoiling at the base of the loops. The NM plus the naked DNA loops anchored to it constitute a nucleoid. Under the conditions of lysis employed to generate nucleoids, the DNA remains essentially intact, although it lacks the nucleosome structure because of the dissociation of histones and most other nuclear proteins usually associated with DNA; yet, the DNA loops remain topologically constrained and supercoiled as depicted in Fig. 1. Indeed, nucleoids are also known as nuclear halos since the exposure of such structures to DNA-intercalating agents like ethidium bromide leads to unwinding of the DNA loops that form a DNA halo around the NM periphery (Fig. 1C). A typical DNA loop can be divided into four topological zones according to their relative proximity to the NM. Each of these zones would manifest an identifiable behaviour when exposed to non-specific nucleases that are sensitive to the local DNA topology (Fig. 1A). We have previously shown that in nucleoid preparations, the relative resistance of a given loop-DNA sequence to a limited concentration of DNase I is directly proportional to its proximity to the NM anchoring point.31,39 Two main factors determine this property. (i) Steric hindrance resulting from the proteinaceous NM that acts as a physical barrier relatively protecting the naked loop DNA that is closer to the NM from endonuclease action. (ii) The local degree of loop DNA supercoiling that is lower in the distal portions of the loop and higher in the regions proximal to the NM. Supercoiling is a structural barrier against the action of non-specific endonucleases, such as DNase I, that hydrolyze the DNA backbone by a single-strand cleavage (nicking) mechanism.40 Both factors only confer relative but not absolute DNase I resistance to loop DNA. However, in a large sample of nucleoids exposed to a limited concentration of DNase I, there is a consistent trend in which the loop-DNA sensitivity to the enzyme is inversely proportional to its distance relative to the NM and so distal regions of the loop are digested first whereas the regions closer to the NM are digested later. Indeed, it is known that the DNA embedded within the NM is very resistant to DNase I action, and there is a fraction corresponding to some 2% the total DNA that is basically non-digestible even when exposed to high concentrations of the enzyme. This fraction corresponds to fragments with an average length of 1.6 kb in rat hepatocytes,12 likely to represent the regions that include the actual MARs (LARs) anchored to the NM. This pattern of sensitivity to DNase I holds provided that the DNA is basically devoid of histones and most other proteins that form chromatin. Indeed, whole chromatin attached to the NM shows an inverse pattern of nuclease sensitivity compared with that of naked loop DNA. In looped chromatin, those sequences closer to the matrix attachment point are preferentially cleaved by nucleases.41Properties of naked DNA loops attached to the NM.

Differential kinetics of loop DNA digestion as a function of proximity to the NMTreatment of nucleoids from quiescent, freshly isolated rat hepatocytes, with a limited concentration of DNase I (0.5 U/ml) produces a highly reproducible kinetics of digestion of loop DNA (Fig. 2A). It is possible to identify three different phases in the digestion curve: the first corresponds to a very fast kinetics of digestion that removes almost 60% the total DNA associated with the NM within the first 5 min. Such a DNA corresponds to the loop fraction distal to the NM; in such a fraction, relatively minor DNA supercoiling is the only barrier to the endonuclease action. Moreover, as the DNase I nicks the loop DNA, each nick becomes a point of further DNA unwinding, thus increasing the reduction in loop supercoiling in time and so making more accessible the loop DNA to the action of the endonuclease. The second phase that lasts ~10 min shows a reduced kinetics of digestion in which some further 10% loop DNA is removed. This slower kinetics is the result of the slower rate of supercoiling loss in the loop DNA proximal to the NM (originally highly supercoiled) that slows down the action of the enzyme. The third and slowest phase, lasting 45 min, shows the removal of some further 10% total DNA associated with the NM. This very slow kinetics results from two factors: the effect of any residual DNA supercoiling and principally of the proximity between the loop DNA and the NM proteins that act as physical barriers against the action of DNase I on the loop DNA that is very close to the NM. Finally, there is about 20% total DNA that remains bound to the NM even after 60 min of treatment with DNase I. This fraction corresponds to the DNA that is actually embedded within the NM, and so it is rather inaccessible to the limited concentration of DNase I used.Kinetics of nucleoid DNA digestion. Nucleoids were digested with DNase-I (0.5 U/ml). Each time-point value is the average of separate experiments with samples obtained from separate animals (n = 9 for hepatocytes, n = 4 for naïve B-lymphocytes). Bars indicate the corresponding SD. The topological zones relative to the NM correspond to decreasing percentages of total DNA bound to the NM. (A) For hepatocytes: distal to NM (100–42% total DNA), proximal to NM (42–30% total DNA), very close to NM (30–19% total DNA) and embedded within NM (19–0% total DNA). The corresponding slopes are the following: 0–5 min = -9.80; 5–15 min = -1.70; 15–30 min = -0.47 and 30–60 min = -0.17. Hence, the slope of the digestion curve became close to zero by 60 min of DNase I treatment and remained like that even after 120 min of incubation with the enzyme (slope 60–120 min = -0.17). (B) For naïve B-lymphocytes: distal to NM (100–33% total DNA), proximal to NM (33–7% total DNA), very close to NM (7–4% total DNA) and embedded within NM (4–0% total DNA). The corresponding slopes are the following: 0–5 min = -11.46; 5–15 min = -2.84; 15–30 min = -0.61 and 30–60 min = -0.06 (slope 60–120 min = -0.03). Hence, the slope of the digestion curve also became close to zero by 60 min of DNase I treatment.Kinetics of nucleoid DNA digestion. Nucleoids were digested with DNase-I (0.5 U/ml). Each time-point value is the average of separate experiments with samples obtained from separate animals (n = 9 for hepatocytes, n = 4 for naïve B-lymphocytes). Bars indicate the corresponding SD.

Hence, the slope of the digestion curve also became close to zero by 60 min of DNase I treatment.Nucleoids from naïve B-lymphocyte treated with the same limited concentration of DNase I display a faster kinetics of loop-DNA digestion, and so after 60 min of treatment with the enzyme, the amount of total DNA embedded within the NM is very small (=4.0%), yet the digestion of further loop DNA stalls and becomes negligible afterwards (Fig. 2B). The average DNA loop size in naïve B-lymphocytes is rather similar to that in hepatocytes, yet the DNA–NM interactions are more fragile in B-lymphocytes when compared with hepatocytes, and comparative PAGE analysis shows that the relative amount of typical NM proteins is significantly reduced in naïve B-lymphocytes, in particular the three nuclear lamins (A, B and C) that are major components of standard NM preparations (our unpublished results). Hence, the presence of a less dense NM in the nucleoids from naïve B-lymphocytes explains why the fraction of total DNA that is relatively protected from DNase I action is significantly smaller than that in nucleoids from hepatocytes. Depending on the cell type of the nucleoids studied, preliminary experiments must be carried out so as to define the concentration of DNase I suitable to produce consistent tri-phasic digestion curves (Fig. 2A and B). On the basis of our experience working with several cell lines31 and different types of primary cells, the range of DNase I concentrations to be considered is between 1.0 and 0.05 U/ml. Indeed, extensive damage to DNA due to incorrect nucleoid preparation and handling, or the natural presence of nicked DNA in some terminally differentiated cell types (such as non-naïve, activated lymphocytes) produce bi-phasic nucleoid-DNA digestion curves since the loop-DNA supercoiling is either absent or severely reduced. Nevertheless, in all nucleoid preparations treated with a limited amount of DNase I, there is a fraction of total DNA that is resistant to the enzyme by being embedded within the NM, such a DNA is easily identifiable in the digestion curves as the fraction that is digested very slowly so that the local slope becomes close to zero and remains like that even after very long incubation times (Fig. 2A and B).3.3. Mapping the relative position to the NM of DNA sequences along the genomic region containing the rat albumin locusOn the basis of the above considerations and results, we used the general strategy depicted in Fig. 3 in order to map the position relative to the NM of 15 small DNA sequences located along a region corresponding to 162 kb of chromosome 14 in the rat, which includes the loci of the following gene members of the albumin gene family: albumin (Alb), alpha-fetoprotein (Afp), afamin (Afm) and the pseudo-gene similar to Afp (Afp-L). Such small DNA sequences were spaced some 10 kb apart (Fig. 4). Therefore, nucleoids prepared from freshly isolated hepatocytes or naïve B-lymphocytes (Fig. 3A) were incubated with DNase I (0.5 U/ml) for different times so as to obtain nucleoid samples with differential amounts of DNA associated with the NM (Fig. 3B and C), and such samples with partially digested NM-bound DNA were used for PCR amplification of the chosen target sequences located along the 162-kb genomic region under study (Fig. 3A). By correlating the amplification data (Fig. 3A) with the kinetics of the nucleoid-DNA digestion (Fig. 3B), it is possible to locate each target sequence within a topological zone relative to the NM (Fig. 2). Previous studies have shown that the average size of the nuclear DNA fragments liberated by non-specific nucleases in rat hepatocytes is 0.8 kb.12 Thus, the DNA sequences to be mapped are <550 bp in length (Table 1), and so likely to be cut as whole units by the endonuclease instead of being progressively eroded by partial digestions. Therefore, in our mapping protocol, we score the specific templates as either present (amplifiable) or absent (non-amplifiable) as a function of endonuclease-digestion time (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S1). This was scored without considering the intensity of the amplicon signals, but just whether such signals are detected or not by an image-analysis program (Kodak 1D Image Analysis Software 3.5), using the default settings. We established these criteria because in our topological-mapping approach, it is the average relative position to the NM anchoring point and not the actual template length the critical parameter that determines the average sensitivity to DNase I of each sequence mapped. Nevertheless, the chosen amplicons were also selected on the basis that all of them may be amplified with similar efficiency using the same amplification program (see Section 2). Thus, the absence of amplified product at a given digestion time-point indicates that the relative abundance of the target template has fallen to a non-amplifiable level within the large nucleoid population analysed in each sample.6Procedure for mapping the position of DNA sequences relative to the NM.

Indeed, some general properties of MARs such as the presence of A-T tracts and repetitive sequences make them unsuitable for efficient PCR amplification under stringent conditions for achieving highly specific amplification of most other non-repetitive genomic sequences. Thus, primer-design programs will grant a low score to any set of primers targeting amplicons containing potential MARs, even more if such amplicons are meant to be highly specific and small-sized (=500 bp), as those targeted in the present protocol.3.4. Determination of the structural DNA loop organization in the region of the rat albumin locusBy coupling the highly reproducible amplification experiments (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S1), together with the consistent kinetics of loop DNA digestion by DNase I (Fig. 2), we were able to locate each mapped sequence within a given topological zone relative to the NM (Tables 2 and 3). Such data were used to draw the most likely DNA loop organization relative to the NM of the 162-kb region studied, by considering the distance (in kb) between the separate sequences mapped and the topological positions of such sequences relative to the NM. The data suggest that in the hepatocytes, the region is organized in five loops anchored to the NM (Fig. 6A). The resulting size from tip to base of such loops is not bigger than 20 kb; thus, the largest loop of the set, containing both Afp and Afm sequences, would be some 40 kb in length. The genomic region studied is a high-gene-density region. Through evolution, a series of duplications formed the genes within the Alb family that includes the vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) gene located almost 1 Mb upstream of the Alb gene.42 Nevertheless, such a gene family has been travelling as a cluster within the mammalian genomes. The fact that the region studied is organized into five rather compact structural DNA loops whose size (40–20 kb) is smaller than the estimated average rat-hepatocyte DNA loop size (80 kb) may be relevant to the functionality of such a genomic region, since fundamental processes of nuclear physiology occur at macromolecular complexes organized on the NM.17–19 It remains to be explored whether high-gene-density regions are usually organized into relatively small-sized structural DNA loops; at least another report suggests that such may be the case.26 However, despite the fact that the average DNA loop size in naïve B-lymphocytes is quite similar to that in hepatocytes (our unpublished results), in naïve B-lymphocytes the corresponding 162 kb region is very close to the NM as most sequences map within the VC topological region. Moreover, the target sequence h consistently maps to the DNase-resistant fraction of NM-bound DNA, and so it must be embedded within the NM. Only the l sequence remains proximal to the NM (Table 3 and Supplementary Fig. S1). This means that in naïve B-lymphocytes the 162-kb region is organized in numerous but tiny (<14 kb) DNA loops (Table 3 and Fig. 6B). This is quite interesting since the genes within the region studied are not known to be expressed in B-lymphocytes as it was confirmed by RT–PCR (data not shown), suggesting that packaging of genes in truly small DNA loops may be correlated with the stable transcriptional silencing of such genes (see below).Experimentally determined structural DNA loop organization of the 162-kb region containing members of the rat albumin gene family in hepatocytes (A) and naïve B-lymphocytes (B).

Predicted MARs in silico do not fully correspond to actual MARs in vivoWe used four different available computer programs for predicting the location of potential MARs along the 162-kb region studied. All these programs have been quoted as MAR-prediction or even as MAR-identifying devices in several published papers.27,28 However, each program uses different criteria so as to define the respective MAR-searching algorithms. This can be appreciated as not all programs coincide in their predictions (Table 4). Moreover, the mapping results in hepatocytes indicate that loop-DNA regions containing actual MARs (LARs) are located next to the following sequences mapped: a, d, h, k, m, o. However, only the region next to the d sequence is consistently identified as a MAR-containing region by the four programs, whereas the other experimentally defined LAR-containing regions are only partially identified by some of the four MAR-searching programs used and all programs predict rather inconsistently the presence of MARs in regions that according to the experimental results are unlikely to be bound to the NM in hepatocytes (Supplementary Fig. S2). The programs detect potential MARs close to most of the sequences mapped along the region studied, but even sequences such as b and c that lack any program-identified MAR nearby (Supplementary Fig. S2) are located very close to the NM in naïve B-lymphocytes, suggesting that there are actual MARs (LARs) that cannot be detected by any of the MAR-identifying programs. Only the sequence l that also lacks any program-identified MAR nearby is consistently far from the NM in naïve B-lymphocytes. These results suggest that MAR-finding programs are highly unreliable tools for actual MAR identification, a fact that has already been shown by others.28Location of potential MARs in the 162-kb genomic region studied as predicted by four different MAR-searching computer programsThe numbers indicate the nucleotide start and ending position number along the genomic region studied.

ConclusionsThe method described in this paper makes it possible to determine the organization in structural DNA loops of any long segment of genomic DNA with known sequence, provided that such a DNA is attached to the NM as is the case in nucleoid preparations of freshly isolated hepatocytes and naïve B-lymphocytes. The procedure used for isolating the nucleoids only preserves DNA–NM interactions that are resistant to high-salt extraction, therefore, facultative non-structural attachments to the NM that may result from some transient functional process such as active transcription are eliminated.43 Our method exploits the topological properties of naked DNA attached to the NM as well as elementary topological principles such as that points in a deformable string (DNA) can be positionally mapped relative to a position-reference invariant (NM), and from such mapping, it can be deduced the configuration of the string in third dimension. Moreover, both the intrinsic persistence length of mixed-sequence DNA, estimated at some 240 bp, and negative supercoiling confer relative rigidity to the naked DNA loops,36 thus limiting their deformability in such a way that the determined positions of loop-DNA sequences relative to the NM are highly reproducible among experiments, indicating limited fluctuation of the DNA loop morphology over time. Nevertheless, some sequences that happen to lie close to the boundary between two topological zones may display some variability in their relative position to the NM, such is the case of sequence e in hepatocytes that in one of four experiments it was detected in the proximal zone, whereas in three experiments it was only detectable in the distal zone relative to the NM (Fig. 5). It must be stressed that the presence of the corresponding amplicons in a given topological zone was determined by an image-analysis system using its default settings independently of the apparent intensity of the amplicon signal in the corresponding gel photograph. Thus, for example, in one of four experiments with hepatocytes, the k amplicon was barely apparent in the proximal region; nevertheless, it was consistently detected in such a region by the image-analysis software in the four separate experiments (Fig. 5).The present protocol works with NM-bound DNA templates and so the actual MARs (LARs) present in such preparations are deeply embedded within the NM, thus being poorly available to the action of any externally added enzyme. Most LAR-identifying protocols depend on the proteolytic destruction of the NM so as to liberate the NM-bound DNA fragments that may be further characterized by a number of techniques.22,24,26,30,44 Thus, our protocol addresses the problem of determining the configuration of structural DNA loops in a given, large enough genomic region without the need of mapping or characterizing the actual MARs (LARs) present in such a region as a precondition for determining the possible loop configuration. Nevertheless, our protocol delimits the genomic regions where such LARs are more likely to be found. Yet, pinpointing the actual extension of such LARs depends on applying further techniques beyond the present protocol. So far, there is only one published protocol that directly maps LARs on NM-bound DNA; this protocol depends on the activation of endogenous, NM-bound topoisomerase II that releases DNA loops by cutting along MARs embedded within the NM.23,45The in vivo, local spatial configuration of DNA into structural loops, as determined by the present protocol, constitutes the starting point for any further refinement or modification of such a configuration by chromatin proteins and epigenetic mechanisms affecting chromatin structure. However, chromatin as such plays no role in determining the structural DNA loop organization since chromatin proteins are completely eliminated by the high-salt extraction, and yet stable DNA–NM interactions persist. In any case, the organization of the genome into structural DNA loops must be highly relevant for the nuclear physiology. Indeed, current evidence suggest that the structural DNA loops may correspond to the actual replicons,5,6,19,39 yet the pattern of such structural loops may also determine the limits of further local structural changes that may be related to transient chromatin modifications resulting in functional interactions (related to transcription) between loop DNA and protein complexes located upon the NM.18,46,47 The genomic region studied contains classical examples of developmentally regulated genes. Indeed, Alb, Afp and Afm are primarily expressed in the liver, yet while Afp and Alb are highly expressed in the fetal liver, the transcription of Afp is rapidly reduced after birth, but Alb and Afm continue to be expressed in the adult liver.42,48 There are three enhancers in the intergenic region between Alb and Afp whose action is required for Afp and Alb activation early in liver development and for Afp reactivation during liver regeneration, yet later during fetal development Alb expression becomes independent of such enhancers due to the action of an Alb-specific enhancer that lies between 8.5 and 10 kb upstream the Alb transcription-start site.42,49 Interestingly, the intergenic enhancers are located in the region between the sequences corresponding to amplicons c and d48 which is clearly detached from the NM in the adult rat (Fig. 6A). We actually mapped the position relative to the NM of enhancer 1 (E1) which is located 2 kb upstream of sequence d that belongs to the Afp promoter region (Fig. 4). E1 mapped within the region proximal to the NM (data not shown) the same as d (Table 2). So far the Alb-specific enhancer has not been formally characterized in the rat. However, comparison of the mouse Alb-enhancer sequence indicates that a closely related sequence is present in the rat in a 1.3-kb region located 8.3 kb upstream of the Alb transcription-start site. Our results suggest the presence of a LAR some 5 kb upstream of sequence a that belongs to the Alb promoter (Figs 4 and 6A and Supplementary Fig. S2). Hence the putative rat Alb-enhancer is located some 2 kb upstream of the possible LAR and so the enhancer could be very close to the NM, although this needs to be experimentally verified.It is known that replication and transcription occur at factories organized upon the NM.18,50 However, replication and transcription factories never co-localize since they occupy distinct but rather fixed sites that are conserved throughout several cell generations.17,51,52 In mammalian lymphocytes it is known that genes separated by tens of mega-bases in cis and genes that belong to separate chromosomes somehow migrate to preassembled transcription factories for their actual transcription.50,53 Such a process requires that the genes undergoing active transcription loop out away from their respective chromosome territories so that distant genomic regions are brought together within one nuclear complex for transcription.54 Hence the fact that in naïve B-lymphocytes the genomic region studied is very close to the NM, suggests that the genes present in the region are prevented from looping out towards a transcription factory, since the genes are included into numerous tiny loops tightly bound to the NM (Fig. 6B).The high-salt-resistant LARs that determine structural attachments to the NM constitute long-term interactions between DNA and the NM. Nevertheless, as predicted by some models, there is evidence that under the influence of a combination of mechanical, biochemical and thermodynamical factors the pattern of such attachments may be modified during development and aging leading to stable changes in cell differentiation.10,13,55,56 Varied and important evidence suggests that the high-salt resistant structural DNA loops correspond to the actual replicons in vivo.5,19 Thus it is remarkable that in totipotent blastomeres the cell cycle consists of overlapping S and M phases with no G1 or G2, the rapid DNA replication observed involves the use of high numbers of closely spaced attachments between DNA and the NM and so the average DNA loops are very small, yet this is compatible with very active DNA replication but not with active transcription as genes in the chromosomes of blastomeres are largely inactive during cleavage.57 Therefore in naïve B-lymphocytes the presence of tiny loops in the region studied may contribute to the transcriptional silencing of the corresponding genes without preventing such a region from being replicated after B-lymphocyte activation.The nucleotype has been defined as those characters of nuclear DNA that may affect the phenotype independently of the information encoded in such a DNA,58 and it has been suggested that besides species-specific nucleotypic characters such as karyotype, and the C-value for nuclear DNA that correlates with overall cell-cycle length, there could be tissue-specific nucleotypic characters, such as the pattern of structural DNA loops, that correlate with cell differentiation.10 Our results support the existence of such tissue specific nucleotypic characters.Supplementary DataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was sponsored by CONACYT, Mexico, grant 48447-Q (25506) and UAEM, Mexico, grant 2212/2006, both awarded to A.A.-A.

IntroductionEndophytes are microorganisms that are able to colonize the intercellular, and sometimes also intracellular, spaces of plant tissues, without causing apparent damage to the host plant. Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial endophytes have been isolated from several tissues in numerous plant species.1,2 Many endophytes have beneficial effects on plant growth and health.3–5 N2-fixing bacterial endophytes, such as Herbaspirillum seropedicae, Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus, and Azoarcus sp., have been found within the tissues of some crops and grasses, and partially contribute to the nitrogen requirement of the host plants.6Azoarcus sp. strain BH72, isolated from the salt marsh plant kallar grass, is best studied in terms of the molecular mechanisms of establishment inside plants and endophyte functions.7Krause et al.8 reported the first full genome sequence of an endophyte, strain BH72 of Azoarcus species (4.38 Mb), and this sequence provided valuable insights into the life of bacterial endophytes, including information about interactions with host plants. Fouts et al.9 also reported the whole genome sequence of a N2-fixing endophyte, Klebsiella pneumoniae 342. Comparative genomics of naturally occurring bacterial endophytes provides information that can be used to develop enhanced bacterial endophytes.10The genus Azospirillum consists of spirillum-shaped, N2-fixing, Gram-negative alpha-proteobacteria that often live in the plant rhizosphere.11 Since Azospirillum inoculation promotes plant growth, agronomic applications of this genus have been developed.12Azospirillum sp. B510 was isolated on 23 August 1999 from the surface-sterilized stems of rice plants (Oryza sativa cv. Nipponbare) that were cultivated in the Kashimadai experimental paddy field of Tohoku University (Miyagi, Japan).13 The B510 strain is closely related to A. oryzae COC8, which was reported as a paddy soil bacterium (with 97.7% identity in their 16S rRNA gene sequences),14 and B510 is classified in the same cluster of the phylogenetic tree as A. oryzae COC8 (Supplementary Fig. S1). In addition to being a diazotroph under free-living conditions, B510 was found to have positive motility, and to be capable of degrading plant cell walls.13 Inoculation with Azospirillum sp. B510 was shown to promote plant growth under both laboratory and field conditions (Isawa et al., unpublished results). Specifically, the field experiment in a field in Hokkaido, Japan, indicated that B510 inoculation increases stem number resulting in an increase in seed yield (Isawa et al., unpublished results). Moreover, B510 inoculation enhanced disease resistance to virulent rice blast fungus and the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae.15 Thus, Azospirillum sp. B510 is likely a beneficial bacterium with agronomic applications.In this study, we demonstrated the endophytic characteristics of Azospirillum sp. B510 and its ability to fix N2in planta. Then, we determined the complete nucleotide sequence of the Azospirillum sp. B510 genome and deduced the gene repertoire in the genome. This is the first report of the genome structure of the genus Azospirillum.2. Materials and methods2.1. A bacterial strain, inoculation of rice plants, and estimation of N2 fixation ability and of the internal Azospirillum sp. B510 populationAzospirillum sp. B510 is a diazotrophic endophyte that was isolated from the stem of cultivated rice, O. sativa cv. Nipponbare.13 Bacteria were cultured in Nutrient Broth (Difco, Detroit, MI, USA), collected by centrifugation at 5000g for 3 min, and washed twice with sterile saline (0.85% w/v NaCl). The bacterial cell suspension was adjusted to 2 × 107 cells ml-1 in saline solution just before inoculation.16The hulls of rice seeds were carefully removed using forceps. After the hulled seeds were shaken in 10% (w/v) Ca(OCl)2 for 30 min at 28°C, they were washed more than three times with sterile distilled water. A surface-sterilized seed was placed in a sterilized test tube (16.5 mm in diameter, 150 mm in height) containing 9 ml of 0.325% (w/v) semi-solid agar solution with the sterilized inorganic nutrients,13,17 and the tube was covered with an aluminium cap. Each seed was inoculated with a bacterial cell suspension of 1 × 107 cells. The rice plants were cultivated at 25°C under long-day conditions (16-h light and 8-h dark) for 10 days in a plant growth cabinet (LH300; NK Systems Co. Ltd, Osaka, Japan) that provided 65 mmol photons m-2 s-1 of photosynthetically active radiation.18To estimate N2-fixing activity, acetylene was introduced into test tubes, each containing a 10-day-old rice seedling, and the tubes were enclosed with a sterilized rubber stopper. After a 24-h incubation period, the ethylene concentration was determined by gas chromatography as described previously.13 Internal populations of inoculated bacteria inside rice tissues were estimated as follows. The 10-day-old rice seedlings were sampled from the test tubes. After the seed parts of the seedlings were removed using forceps, the remaining parts of the seedlings were weighed. The parts of seedlings were dipped in 70% (v/v) ethanol and then immersed in 1% NaOCl solution for 30 s. They were then quickly washed three times with sterilized distilled water and then once with sterilized saline solution. After the surface-sterilized plants were aseptically macerated in 1 ml of saline solution using a mortar and pestle, the macerates were serially diluted with saline solution and plated on Nutrient Agar (Difco) plates. After incubation at 30°C for 7 days, colony forming units (CFUs) were determined based on the fresh weight of the rice plants. Simultaneously, uninoculated plants were grown and subjected to CFU determination, as a negative control.2.2. Genome sequencingTotal cellular DNA was purified according to standard procedures, and three genomic libraries, based on two types of cloning vectors, were constructed for sequencing. The IB5100/1 library contained inserts of ~3.0 kb cloned into pUC118 (Takara Bio Inc., Japan), the IB5102/3 library contained inserts of ~4.5 kb cloned into pUC118, and the IB510b library contained inserts with an average size of 58 kb cloned into a BAC vector, pCC1BAC (Epicentre Bio., USA).Genome sequencing was performed using the whole-genome shotgun method in combination with BAC end-sequencing. The nucleotide sequences of both ends of the clones from the IB5100/1, IB5102/3, and IB510b libraries were analysed using a Dye-terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit and the 3730XL Sequencer (Applied Biosystems, USA). The end-sequence data from the BAC clones facilitated the gap-closure process and provided the scaffolding for reconstruction of the sequence of the entire genome. We filled the remaining gaps in the sequence by primer walking, using the plasmids or the BAC clones as templates. The integrity of the reconstructed genome sequence was assessed by chromosome walking using the end sequences of the BAC clones.2.3. Gene assignment, annotation, and information analysesRNA- and protein-encoding regions were assigned by a combination of computer prediction and similarity searches, as described previously.19Genes for structural RNAs were identified by similarity searches against an in-house structural RNA database that had been constructed based on data available in GenBank (rel.167). tmRNA-, tRNA-, and rRNA-encoding regions were predicted using the ARAGORN 1.2.20 program,20 the tRNA scan-SE 1.23 program,21 and the RNAmmer ver.1.2S program,22 respectively, in combination with similarity searches.The prediction of protein-encoding regions was carried out with the Glimmer 2.13 prediction program.23 Prior to prediction, a matrix was generated for the B510 genome by training with a data set of 610 open-reading frames that showed a high degree of sequence similarity to a translated gene set registered as the genomic data for both Magnetospirillum magneticum AMB-1 (accession number AP007255) and Rhodospirillum rubrum ATCC 11170 (CP000230), which are bacteria closely related to Azospirillum species.24 All the predicted protein-encoding regions of 150 bp or more were translated into amino acid sequences, which were then subjected to similarity searches against the non-redundant (nr) protein database from NCBI (GenBank database rel. 167.0) using the BLASTP program.25 In parallel, all the predicted intergenic sequences were compared with sequences in the nr database using the BLASTX program to identify genes that were not detected by the prediction process. For predicted genes that did not show sequence similarity to known genes, only those equal to or longer than 150 bp were considered candidates.To annotate the functions of the assigned genes, the KAAS system, which is based on bi-directional best-hit information from sequence similarity against the KEEG GENES database and on heuristics, was first applied to all predicted protein-encoding genes.26 Next, the group escaped from KAAS was deduced based on the sequence similarity of their translated protein products to those of genes of known function and to the protein motifs in the InterPro database (ver. 17.0).27 A BLAST score of 10-5 was considered significant. Assignment of Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins (COGs) of predicted gene products was carried out by BLASTP analysis against the COG reference data set (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/COG/).28 A BLAST E-value of less than 10-10 was considered significant. After filtering, COG assignments of the putative gene products were generated according to COG identification, using the best-hit pair in the reference data set.Comparison between two genomic nucleotide sequences was performed using GenomeMatcher V.1.270.29 The GC-skew analysis was performed as described by Lobry.30Phage_Finder ver. 4.6 was used to detect the prophage region inserted into the B510 genome.31The FtsK Orienting Polar Sequences (KOPS) motif is specifically oriented toward the replication terminus of the genomic sequences in alpha-proteobacteria.32 The cumulative distribution of the KOPS sequence patterns (GGGNAGGG) was calculated along each replicon of B510, and the distribution of these patterns in the genome was plotted. Multicopy DNA elements of longer than 500 bp that have the capacity to encode a putative transposase were identified as insertion sequences (ISs), using the BLAST2 program, and then classified using RECON1.0533 and the IS finder (www-is.biotoul.fr).3. Results and discussion3.1. Colonization and N2 fixation in rice plantsThe internal population of B510 was evaluated using surface-sterilized rice seedlings and the plate counting method. We calculated that there were 1.5–5.7 × 104 CFU g-1 fresh weight of inoculated seedlings. In contrast, no colonies were detected in uninoculated rice plants. These data indicate that B510 cells colonized internal rice tissues, although the colonization level was lower than that reported for other endophytes, including Herbaspirillum sp. B501 (~106 CFU g-1 fresh weight).13,34 Indeed, Yasuda et al.15 also observed colonization of Azospirillum sp. B510 around the basal parts of shoots of cv. Nipponbare using gusA-tagged B510.To evaluate the in planta N2-fixing activity of Azospirillum sp. B510, acetylene reduction activity was assayed using rice seedlings inoculated or not with the bacterium. In the presence of acetylene, the seedlings inoculated with Azospirillum sp. B510 showed marked acetylene reduction activity compared with the activity in uninoculated plants and in plants inoculated in air (control) (Supplementary Table S1). Acetylene reduction activity of Azospirillum sp. B510 in planta (43 nmol h-1 g-1 fresh weight) was similar to that of Herbaspirillum sp. B501 (67 nmol h-1 g-1 fresh weight), a well-characterized N2-fixing endophyte isolated from rice plants.13,17,343.2. Sequencing and structural features of the genomeThe nucleotide sequence of the entire B510 genome was deduced initially by assembling a total of 66 554 sequence files, which corresponded to approximately six genome equivalents, according to the method described in the Materials and methods section. To ensure that the nucleotide sequence was sufficiently accurate for further analysis of gene structure and function, finishing was carried out by visually editing the draft sequences and by additional sequencing to close the gaps. The genome of B510 consists of a single chromosome and six circular plasmids designated as pAB510a, pAB510b, pAB510c, pAB510d, pAB510e, and pAB510f. The total size of the genome is 7 599 738 bp, and the average GC content is 67.6%. The size and the percentage of GC content of each replicon are summarized in Table 1. The integrity of 99.9% of the final genome sequence was assessed by comparing the insert length of anchored BAC clones with the computed distance between the end sequences of the clones. The integrity of the remaining region (334 299–341 799 nt on the chromosome) where no BAC clone was anchored was confirmed using the sequence and insert length information of the plasmid clones.Features of replicons in Azospirillum sp.

Nucleotide positions for the plasmids were assigned based on the predicted translational initiation site of AZLa11310 in pAB510a, AZLb06310 in pAB510b, AZLc05330 in pAB510c, AZLe04150 in pAB510e, AZLf01870 in pAB510f, and the termination of AZLd05190 in pAB510d, respectively.Ten Azospirillum species have been examined for their genome composition, using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.35 Multiple replicons were identified in 10 Azospirillum species as with B510. However, the chromosome size of each Azospirillum strain (<2.7 Mb) was smaller than one of B510 (3.3 Mb). Linear plasmids were detected in several Azospirillum strains, such as A. brasilense and A. lipoferum,35 but similar structural units were not found in the B510 genome.3.3. Structural features of the genomeA GC-skew analysis was performed to locate the probable origin of DNA replication. We established that the shift of GC-skew values occurred in two regions of the chromosome, at coordinates 35 and 1710 kb, as shown in Fig. 1 (the innermost circle). The hemE locus, which is known to associate with the origins of replication in alpha-proteobacteria,36 was found to be adjacent to the shift point of the GC skew. A cluster of nine genes, rho–hypothetical–hemH–hemE–hypothetical–maf–aroE–coaE–dnaQ (AZL028900–AZL028930–AZL000010– AZL000050: these codes are hereinafter defined in the Protein-encoding genes section), occurring at ~0 kb on the B510 chromosome (Supplementary Fig. S2) was commonly found in the Magnetospirillum sp. AMB-1 genome.37parA (AZL000140) and parB (AZL000150) were found downstream of dnaQ (AZL000050; Supplementary Fig. S2). These findings strongly suggest that the ori region of the chromosome is located between AZL028930 and AZL000010. This location of the ori is also supported by the KOPS motif distribution analysis (Supplementary Fig. S3).Schematic representation of seven circular replicons in the Azospirillum sp. B510 genome. The scale for all plasmids is the same, and the scale for the chromosome is one-half that of the plasmids. The scale indicates the location (in kb) outside the map. The bars in the two outer circles, the outermost circle and the second circle, show the positions of the putative protein-encoding genes in clockwise and counter-clockwise directions, respectively. The putative genes are represented by 25 colours, based on COG assignments (Supplementary Fig. S2). In the third circles from the outside, positions of structural RNA genes are indicated by black (tRNAs) and red (rRNAs) bars. In the fourth circles from the outside, the red bars indicate the positions of ISs, and the pale-green and blue areas show the insertion of prophages and genomic islands, respectively. The innermost and second circles from the centre show the GC-skew values (yellow and purple) and the average GC percent (blue and red), respectively, calculated using a window-size of 10 kb. The scales for GC percent are presented on the second circles. Top and bottom of each scale are shown, as follows: 73.9/58.9% in the chromosome, 74.6/57.0% in pAB510a, 72.5/60.7% in pAB510b, 72.0/60.2% in pAB510c, 74.9/48.3% in pAB510d, 71.9/59.0% in pAB510e, and 71.1/52.7% in pAB510f.Schematic representation of seven circular replicons in the Azospirillum sp.

The predicted origins of both of these plasmids were located at around 0 kb. The KOPS motif distribution analysis also indicates that these regions are the origins of replication (Supplementary Fig. S3). These regions accommodate repA-parAB genes (AZLa00020, AZLa00030, AZLa00040) in pAB510a and repB (AZLd00010) in pAB510d. However, no repC candidate was found in the B510 genome, suggesting that the two B510 plasmids, which contain typical origin of replication regions, may have distinct, unknown initiators of replication.ISs are small mobile DNA elements capable of transposition via a self-encoded transposase and can be classified into various families based on their structure.38 Two-hundred and eighty IS copies were assigned in all seven replication units of the B510 genome. On the basis of the type of transposase present, these ISs could be classified into 29 groups of 12 families (www-is.biotoul.fr; Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). As shown in Fig. 1, they are rather evenly distributed among the replicons, although there are several regions where a disproportionate number of ISs are located within the replicon. The remarkable frequency of ISs was occurred in pAB510f, in which a 33-kb region corresponding to 12.6% of the replicon is occupied by 30 ISs classified into 19 groups.It is remarkable that 27 out of 280 ISs were located from 3164 to 3208 kb, between CRISPER-like sequences (described later) and one of the rRNA gene clusters on the chromosome (Fig. 1). Thirty-one ISs classified into 18 groups were also found between 80 and 157 kb on pAB510b (Fig. 1). The partial segments (AZL027610 and AZLb01330) of a gene similar to recombinase were identified at both ends of the above-mentioned high-density IS regions. This feature suggests that these regions may behave as a single large mobile genetic element.The Phage_Finder program detected two independent putative prophages with their putative att sites at coordinates 915901–982641 (B510PP01) and 2490727–2522517 (B510PP02) on the Azospirillum sp. B510 chromosome (Fig. 1). The predicted sequences of att sites were assigned as 11 bases long (CAAGGCCGCCG) at both termini of B510PP01 and 12 bases (GCTGGGCGGCGGC) in B510PP02. The attL sites of these putative prophages (B510PP01 and B510PP02) were located near the potential genes encoding integrases AZL008670 and AZL022160, respectively. Moreover, a recombinase homologue (AZL008660) was found upstream of the AZL008670 integrase of B510PP01. Both B510PP01 and B510PP02 contained terminases (AZL008420 and AZL022110), capsid proteins (AZL008390, AZL008410, and AZL022100), and tail proteins (AZL008340 and AZL022050). These genetic traits found in two regions, B510PP01 and B510PP02, are characteristic of a horizontally transferred element.A putative duplicated sequence of the B510PP01 prophage (at coordinates 915901–982641) was identified at coordinates 2296582–2356862 on the chromosome (Fig. 1). A detailed comparison between these two regions showed that this phage-like element lacked regions corresponding to both termini, namely a 4.8-kb region on the attL side that includes the integrase gene (AZL008670), and a 1.7-kb region on the attR side. The presence of this putative cryptic phage with deletions may indicate that the B510 cell was subjected to multiple infection events during the course of evolution.The release of phage particles from B510 cells is induced by mitomycin C treatment.39 The DNA in the released phage was estimated to be ~10 kb in size. In the present study, however, we could not find a prophage-like region of this size in the entire B510 genome. A possible explanation for this is that diverse prophages in the genome were overlooked during the computer identification.A search of the genome sequence by GenomeMatcher (ver.1.282) detected a large number of copies of short sequences at the coordinates 3158606–3163849 on the chromosome (Supplementary Fig. S4A and B). This region exhibited a structure typical of CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeat) systems and is composed of 70 different spacers (36–42 bp), an identical repeat element (37 bp) containing an 8-bp palindrome (5'-CCTGGGCG), and cas genes encoding CRISPR-associated proteins (Supplementary Figs S4C and S5).40 When the whole genome sequence of B510 was subjected to CRISPRFinder (http://crispr.u-psud.fr/crispr), four additional CRISPR-like regions without complete cas genes were found exclusively at the coordinates 1016560–1018180, 1178059–1178606, 3035919–3038413, and 3199247–3200867 on the chromosome. Recently, it was reported that CRISPRs act as an antiphage defense system; bacteria integrate new spacers that are derived from phage genomic sequences during CRISPR-mediated phage resistance.40,41Genomic islands are regions that form syntenic groups consisting of multiple accessory genes, and they are inserted into the genome through horizontal transfer.42 They are often inserted into tRNA genes in various bacterial genomes.42 Duplicated portions of tRNA genes, which are a typical feature of genomic islands, were found at eight locations in the B510 genome (Table 1). These duplicated portions were separated from the corresponding genes by DNA segments ranging in size from 6.7 to 71 kb (B510GI01-06, d7, e8; Supplementary Table S4). This suggests that genomic islands were inserted into the tRNA genes of the B510 genome. ‘Supplementary Table S4’ summarizes the species of tRNA genes, their positions, the length of duplications, and the DNA regions that separate the perfect or near-perfect duplicated tRNA gene segments, which are 20–48 bp long. The presumptive genomic islands varied in size and contained putative genes for an integrase or a site-specific recombinase at one of their termini (Supplementary Table S4). The GC content of these elements (53–67%) was lower than the average GC content of the chromosome (67.8%). As this type of nucleotide bias is a general feature of genomic islands,42 the lower GC content of the presumptive genomic islands strongly suggests the horizontal origin of these elements.3.4. Aspects of predicted genes and their organizationA total of 79 tRNA genes, representing 45 tRNA species, were identified (Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. S6 and Table S5). These tRNA genes were dispersed throughout the genome, but did not occur in pAB510f (Table 1). Among them, 37 tRNA genes are likely to be transcribed as a single unit, whereas 20 (representing trnA-UGC, trnI-GAU, and trnfM-CAU) are likely to form a common transcriptional unit consisting of eight rRNA gene clusters, and the remaining 22 are tandemly arranged into nine clusters (Supplementary Table S6). Duplicated gene sets for trnK, trnT, trnP, and trnE were arrayed in pairs as complete copies. Thirty-four of the 79 tRNA genes are encoded by plasmids (Table 1). They were classified into 19 tRNA species, eight of which are specific to pAB510a or pAB510d (Supplementary Table S5), indicating that these plasmids are essential.Nine rrns with a form of 16S-trnA-trnI-23S-5S were assigned in the genome, two of which are on the chromosome (rrn1 and rrn2) and seven on the plasmids (rrn3, rrn4, rrn5, rrn6, rrn7, rrn8, and rrn9) (Supplementary Fig. S2). The presence of nine rrns shows not to be typical copy number as alpha-proteobacteria genome, because alpha-proteobacteria generally possess five or less copies of rrn, whereas gamma-proteobacteria and firmicutes possess nine or more copies (http://ribosome.mmg.msu.edu/rrndb/).43Of the five rrn-gene clusters, four (rrn2, rrn3, rrn6, and rrn9) were followed by trnfM (Supplementary Fig. S7). A genome island (B510GIe8) was inserted in trnfM in rrn3 located on pAB510e. One of the clusters lacking trnfM (rrn5) had a deletion of 522 nucleotides long, containing trnA and trnI, as well as a truncation of the 3' region that encoded the 5S rRNA in addition to trnfM (Supplementary Fig. S7).A gene-encoding transfer-messenger RNA (ssrA: AZLr028), which is known to be involved in the degradation of aberrantly synthesized proteins, was found in the B510 genome. Putative genes for two types of small RNAs, the B subunit of RNase P (rnpB: AZLr029), and the signal recognition particle (SRP) RNA (ffs: AZLr040) were also identified in the B510 genome (Supplementary Fig. S2).The potential protein-encoding regions were assigned using a combination of computer prediction using the Glimmer program and a similarity search, as described in the Materials and methods section. By taking into account sequence similarity to known genes and relative position of predicted encoding region, to avoid overlaps, the total number of putative protein-encoding genes assigned to the genome was 6309 (Table 1). The average gene density was estimated as being one gene in every 1205 bp. The putative protein-encoding genes that start with ATG, GTG, TTG, or ATT codons were denoted by a serial number with the prefix ‘AZL’, representing the previous species name of this bacterium, Azospirillum lipoferum. It should be noted that the putative gene assignment used in this paper represents coding potential based on a defined set of assumptions.We assigned functions to the 6309 potential protein-encoding genes by performing similarity searches, as described in the Materials and methods section. Seventy-five percent (4750) of the genes exhibited sequence similarity to genes of known function, and 25% (1559) showed sequence similarity to hypothetical genes.We generated COG assignments of the translated gene products by conducting a BLASTP search against the COG reference data set. A total of 4718 putative gene products were classified into 23 COG categories, excluding gene products of unknown function, as shown in Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. S2.3.5. Characteristic features of the protein-encoding genesB510 is a bacterium capable of performing N2 fixation in a modified Rennie semi-solid medium.13 Furthermore, we demonstrated its ability to fix N2in planta in this study (see the Colonization and N2 fixation in rice plants section). The genes encoding the nitrogenase core and assembly proteins were separately clustered in three loci on the B510 chromosome. These three gene clusters were arranged in nifA [1 gene]–nifB [3 genes]–nifZ [1 gene]–nifST (AZL022440–AZL022530), nifWV [1 gene]–nifSU (AZL006520–AZL006560), and nifHDK [2 genes]–nifENX (AZL007710–AZL007640; Fig. 2A). nifQ (AZL010780) was located at a distance from above other nif gene clusters. The fixABCX (AZL006470–AZL006500) cluster, which encoded components participating in the transport of electrons to nitrogenase,44,45 was adjacent to the nifWVSU cluster and in an opposite orientation (Fig. 2A). Not all of the major components of N2 fixation were encoded by genes on the chromosome; AZLc04520, which is a homologue of nifJ encoding pyruvate–flavodoxin oxidoreductase, was solely found on the pAB510c plasmid. However, considering that a homologue of nifF, which encodes flavodoxin, an electron donor of NifJ, was not found in the B510 genome, AZLc04520 may not be involved in the major pathway for electron transfer to nitrogenase in B510.Schematic diagram of the N2-fixation gene clusters from Azospirillum sp.

A box with a yellow border indicates that the gene cluster is located on the plasmid.The structures of the three nif/fix gene clusters in B510 were mostly conserved with those of Bradyrhizobium sp. ORS278, which forms nodules on stems of aquatic legumes (Fig. 2A).46 However, B510 has the following distinctive features: the inversion of fixABCX, the insertion of two other predicted genes (AZL007670 and AZL007680) into a region between nifHDK and nifENX, and the transposition of nifQ from these clusters (Fig. 2A). These features may reflect the high frequency of genome rearrangements in B510.Cytochrome c terminal oxidase is an enzyme essential for N2 fixation in rhizobial species.47 The oxidase components and the cation pump that is involved in oxidase activity are encoded in rhizobia by fixNOQP and fixGHIS, respectively. These gene clusters were located in tandem on the chromosome of B510 (AZL003350–AZL003410), although fixG was missing from the gene cluster (Fig. 2B). These gene clusters were located upstream of the fixK homologue (AZL003420: a probable transcriptional regulator). The fixG genes were present in triplicate and located at distinct positions on the chromosome (AZL016980), pAB510b (AZLb04870), and pAB510e (AZLe02910). Cytochrome c terminal oxidase is partially responsible for the N2-fixing capacity during microaerobic respiration in A. brasilense.48 It is possible that cytochrome c terminal oxidase plays a similar role in B510, although the N2-fixing capacity of B510 during microaerobic respiration has not yet been investigated.A two-component regulatory system, fixLJ, is required to activate the expression of the nifA and fixK regulators of N2 fixation in rhizobia.49 We identified a gene cluster in pAB510b that included fixLJK (AZLb06310, AZLb06300, and AZLb06280; Fig. 2B). The domain organization of FixL (AZLb06310) in B510 was more similar to that of Bradyrhizobium japonicum (bll2760) than to that of Sinorhizobium meliloti (SMa1229).50 The genome structures of two diazotrophic endophytes, Azoarcus sp. BH72 and K. pneumoniae Kp342, have been reported,8,9 and the gene clusters encoding nitrogenase components in these genomes did not contain fixL. These findings suggest that the mechanism of N2 fixation in B510 is similar to that in rhizobia and differs from that in two diverse endophytes, Azoarcus sp. BH72 and K. pneumoniae Kp342.Plant-associated bacteria, such as endophytes and rhizosphere bacteria, often produce plant hormones or modulate their functions by producing inhibitors for phytohormone biosynthesis.51 In particular, the modulation of plant ethylene levels by bacterial 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase interferes with the physiological functions of the host plant.51,52 B510 possesses the acdS gene (AZLb04170), which encodes ACC deaminase, and the acdR gene (AZLb04180: leucine-responsible regulatory protein; LRP), which regulates the expression of acdS via its putative LRP binding site, on the pAB510b plasmid (Supplementary Fig. S8).53,54 It is possible that B510 produces ACC deaminase in response to plants, which then reduces the level of ethylene in plants, and which might promote plant growth and alleviate signs of environmental stress.51,55 The acdS gene was not present in the previously reported genomes of Azoarcus sp. BH72 and K. pneumoniae Kp342.8,9Biosynthesis of indole-3-actic acid (IAA) is widespread among plant-associated bacteria and has a beneficial impact on plant growth.56 In azospirilla and enterobacteria, IAA is generally synthesized from tryptophan via indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPyA). A key gene in this process is ipdC, which encodes indole-3-pyruvate decarboxylase (IPDC). No ipdC homologue was found in the B510 genome, irrespective of the presence of ipdC in the genome of the endophyte K. pneumoniae Kp342 (GKROPF_B2055)9 and an IAA-inducible ipdC gene in rhizosphere bacterium A. brasilense.57 We could not find an iaaC homologue in B510 either, even though the iaaC gene is co-transcribed with the ipdC gene in A. brasilense.57 Nevertheless, another pathway for IAA biosynthesis could exist in B510. The IAA biosynthetic pathway catalyses the decarboxylation of tryptophan into indole-3-actamide (IAM) and the hydrolysis of IAM to produce IAA. In Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Pseudomonas syringae, the iaaM and iaaH genes are known to be involved in these steps.56 In B510, AZLb03560 and AZLb03580 were assigned as candidates for these genes that participate in the IAM pathway.Transporters play indispensable roles in various cellular processes including the delivery of nutrients, elimination of waste products, and adaptation to environmental conditions. A variety of transporters are also thought to be involved in the symbiotic exchange of nutrients between host plant cells and intracellular rhizobia in symbiosis.We identified a total of 354 possible transporters based on sequence similarity to known transporters and an InterPro search.58 These genes were subsequently classified into 62 families according to the transporter classification system used in Transport Classification Database (http://www.tcdb.org/).59 The gene composition of genes in these gene families in B510 is more similar to those in rhizobial species than in two other N2-fixing endophytes, Azoarcus sp. BH72 and K. pneumoniae Kp342 (Supplementary Table S7). Two of the families identified, the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily and the major facilitator superfamily (MFS), were composed of a large number of paralogs (141 and 57, respectively) that accounted for a significant portion of the transporter genes in the B510 genome. Although this feature is common among the rhizobia and the endophyte, there are significantly more ABC and MFS genes in B510 genome than in Azoarcus sp. BH72 (Supplementary Table S7). Moreover, members of the TC families, which include the Monovalent Cation (K+ or Na+):Proton Antiporter-3 (CPA3) family and the Tricarboxylate Transporter (TTT) Family (Supplementary Table S7), were found in B510 and rhizobia, but not in the Azoarcus sp. BH72 genome.TonB-dependent outer-membrane proteins, which are responsible for the specific uptake of ferric-siderophore complexes, are crucial for the perception of environmental signals and are associated with plant pathogens.60 Strain B510 possesses one set of tonB/exbB/exbD accompanied with anti-sigma and ECF sigma factor genes on pAB510d (Supplementary Table S8).60 In contrast, B510 carried nine genes encoding TonB-dependent outer-membrane proteins on three replicons, pAB510d, the chromosome, and pAB510a (Supplementary Table S8). The number of iron transport proteins in the B510 genome was not as high as that in other N2-fixing endophytes, such as Azoarcus sp. BH72 (22 genes), or in the rhizosphere bacterium, Pseudomonas fluorescens pf5 (45 genes). A homology search suggested that putative receptors for ferrioxamine, vitamin B12, hemin, and heme exist in B510. Because strain B510 produces siderophore (Kawaharada et al., unpublished results), the iron transport systems of B510 may be active in the bacterium in free-living and endophytic environments.A C4-dicarboxylate, such as malate, is considered to be the major energy and carbon source of Rhizobium during symbiosis with host plants. The transport systems and metabolic enzymes of C4-dicarboxylates in Rhizobium are essential for their symbioses. With regard to the transport of carbon from the source to B510 during symbiosis, we identified five complete sets of gene cluster composed of three genes encoding the tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic-transport (TRAP-T) system (TC# 2.A.56) that transports C4-dicarboxylate (Supplementary Table S9). One of the gene cluster for TRAP-T system, AZLa08570, AZLa08580, and AZLa08600, is located upstream of a gene cluster containing citrate lyase subunits (AZLa08510, AZLa08500, AZLa08490, and AZLa08480) and a gene for malic enzyme (AZLa08520). Since citrate lyase works in citrate metabolic pathway under anoxic conditions in K. pneumoniae and Escherichia coli, it might allow B510 growing utilizing citrate as the energy source in planta. Malic enzymes are responsible for the respiratory metabolism in the N2 fixation as occurs during rhizobial symbiotic relationships with plants.61 The genome sequence of B510 revealed the presence of three genes encoding malic enzymes (AZL000200, AZLa05660, and AZLa08520). In a phylogeny, including genes from rhizobia and other endophytes, plasmid-encoding AZLa05660 and AZLa08520 are classified in a group that includes DME (NAD+-dependent malic enzyme), and AZL000200 is in a cluster harbouring TME (NADP+-dependent malic enzyme; Supplementary Fig. S9). Consequently, these findings suggest that a system for uptake and metabolism of C4 dicarboxylic acids exists in B510, as is the case in rhizobia, and this system may contribute a part of the carbon utilizations during the symbiosis.The B510 genome harboured a gene cluster with significant sequence similarity to that encoding the type IV secretion system (T4SS). Within this cluster was a gene encoding a putative coupling protein TraG/VirD4 (AZL011550), followed by the genes encoding components of secretion machinery TrbB/VirB11, TrbE/ViB4, TrbL/VirB6, TrbG/VirB9, and TrbI/VirB10 (AZL011560, AZL011580, AZL011600, AZL011620, and AZL011630, respectively). It is likely that this region is part of a genomic island, since an integrase gene (AZL011700) is coded in a region adjacent to this cluster; however, tRNA gene sequences were not detected in the border regions. The absence of genes encoding the other necessary components of T4SS might suggest that the genes in the cluster are not functional, but are remnants of genomic rearrangements. Alternatively, it is possible that there are functional homologues with less sequence similarity to prototypical T4SS proteins in the B510 genome.62Plant phytochromes are one of the photoreceptors that enable plants to adapt their growth and development to the light environment. The phytochromes are also widely distributed in diverse prokaryotes, including cyanobacteria and proteobacteria.63 The B510 genome has two genes, AZL019550 and AZLa05830, which encode distinct types of bacterial phytochromes, such as those found in the plant-tumour inducing bacterium A. tumefaciens and in the photosynthetic bradyrhizobium, Bradyrhizobium sp. ORS278.64,65 The translated amino acid sequence of the plasmid-encoded AZLa05830 protein, which shows significant similarity (47% amino acid identity) with AtBphP1 (Atu1990) in A. tumefaciens, is composed of 751 amino acid residues and contains domains that are typical of bacterial phytochromes (PAS-GAF-phytochrome-HisK). A gene encoding a response regulator (AZLa05820) in a CheY superfamily is located downstream of AZLa05830, suggesting that this gene is involved in signal transduction. In contrast, AZL019550 encodes a polypeptide of 853 amino acid residues that contains ‘PAS-GAF-phytochrome-HisK-RR’ domains. The translated gene product had 52% amino acid identity with that of BrBphP2 (BRADO2008) of Bradyrhizobium sp. ORS278. These two candidates for the light-sensing proteins may involve in the signalling pathway, although the actual function of these phytochromes remains to be analysed in B510.Quorum-sensing regulation in several strains of A. lipoferum modulates functions related to rhizosphere competence and adaptation, such as pectinase activity, siderophore synthesis, and IAA production.66 B510 produces acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) molecules in culture67 and carries genes related to AHL synthase (AZLa05890), AHL acylase (AZL013430), and AHL efflux protein (AZLd00800). A LuxR family transcriptional regulator was not found in the vicinity of AHL synthase gene (AZLa05890), although there were 22 luxR family transcriptional regulators on the genome.Most endophytes are motile, because the endophytes systemically spread into the plant from infection sites.2 We found that B510 carried at least two sets of genes that encode proteins involved in flagella assembly (Supplementary Table S10). Thirty one flagella-related genes were clustered on the pAB510e plasmid (AZLe00750–AZLe01230), whereas 25 and 15 of flagella-related genes were present on the chromosome and pAB510a, respectively (Supplementary Table S10). Thirty redundant genes with roles in chemotaxis (e.g. cheAWR) or that encoded methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins were found on the chromosome, pAB510a, pAB510c, pAB510d, and pAB510e.Azospirillum brasilense strain Sp7 has a pRhico plasmid that is responsible for the interaction with plant roots. pRhico has been incompletely sequenced with five gaps, and the presence of 32 genes encoding enzymes involved in surface polysaccharide biosynthesis has been reported.68 To examine the structural similarity between the pRhico plasmid and the B510 genome, a similarity search with the pRhico sequences as a query was conducted against the entire B510 genome sequence, using the BLAST program, with a threshold E-value of 10-10.The search detected significant alignments between the B510 genome and 43 regions of pRhico, 23 of which were mapped on pAB510f. One of these sequences incompletely matched 881 nucleotides inside the putative replication protein gene (repA: AZLf00010) of pAB510f and one matched 138 nucleotides upstream of repA (Supplementary Fig. S10), and 17 mapped to regions on pAB510f that coincided with 11 genes that were presumably involved in cell envelope biosynthesis and outer membrane constitution (AZLf00040, AZLf00050, AZLf00060, AZLf00080, AZLf01050, AZLf01060, AZLf01640, AZLf01790, AZLf01050, and AZLf01810; Supplementary Fig. S10). The results suggest an evolutionary link and some functional relationship between pRhico and pAB510f. However, remaining portions of pRhico, such as those containing exoC and tRNA genes, were scattered throughout the B510 genome and most of the sequences were poorly conserved, indicating that drastic genome rearrangements had taken place since the two species diverged (Supplementary Fig. S10).The sequence information is available in public DNA databases (DDBJ/GenBank/EMBL), under the following accession numbers: AP010946 for the B510 chromosome, AP010947 for pAB510a, AP010948 for pAB510b, AP010949 for pAB510c, AP010950 for pAB510d, AP010951 for pAB510e, and AP010952 for pAB510f.

IntroductionAt the onset of the new millennium, the realization that the genome encoded for far fewer genes than previously anticipated was particularly surprising.1,2 In parallel with the sequencing of the genome, sequencing of DNA copied from cellular mRNA (cDNAs) made key contributions to hunting for genes encoded in the genome. Early investigations centred on the identification of protein coding mRNAs, following the traditional idea that the final products of mammalian genes are mainly proteins. This practice of limiting the gene search to mRNAs encoding proteins had its roots in classic biological studies. Built on the central dogma of molecular biology and learned from annotating the sequences of bacterial genomes, we sought out a protein-centric view of biology. Accordingly, projects such as the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC)3 targeted only the long (protein coding) mRNAs. The MGC focused on sequencing only those full-length cDNAs which showed coding potential after an initial screening of clones with 5'-end sequence analysis. Similarly, another project that focused on expanding the collection of large protein coding cDNAs, considered coding potential as a pre-requisite for further sequencing.4 This made perfect sense, because full-length cDNA sequencing has been a very intense and expensive operation. Also, there was no evidence that other forms of RNA could be major functional components of the transcriptome. However, in the FANTOM project, the sequencing of full-length cDNAs based primarily on the novelty of end sequences regardless of coding potential brought forth a surprising new world of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Indeed, the number of long ncRNAs was revealed to be greater than the protein coding RNAs, exceeding 23 000 transcriptional units in mouse.5 Analysis of public human cDNA libraries also identified ncRNAs,6 but to a much lower extent, due to its focus on protein coding RNAs.3 Subsequently, studies of expressed sequences in human cells using tiling arrays7 revealed a similar complexity of ncRNAs in human cells.8,9 The fact that the genome is pervasively transcribed into long ncRNAs has only recently been accepted. It is now known that a large fraction of the transcriptome is constituted of long and short ncRNAs (up to 93% of the genome is transcribed), with disparate functions, many still unknown. These include transcriptional regulation by sense–antisense,5 activation or inactivation of transcription through regulatory regions, and numerous other functions that have been reviewed elsewhere.10–12In parallel, the discovery of RNA interference (RNAi) and micro-RNAs has provided the notion that at least some of the longer RNAs are cleaved into smaller, functional short RNAs (sRNAs are defined as RNAs shorter than 200 nt and therefore non-coding).13 A summary of the families of RNAs discussed in this review is provided in Table 1. For almost a decade, the research community has been focused on miRNAs, siRNAs, and few other sRNAs, allowing the field to flourish, with particular emphasis on miRNA as translational regulators.14 However, further integrated understanding of the relationship between long ncRNAs and sRNAs worlds is still in its infancy and only recently links between these two classes are finally becoming evident. In fact, novel discoveries are pointing at a much larger complexity of cleavage patterns, suggesting that the same region of the genome can encode for long mRNAs and a plethora of other long ncRNAs and sRNAs (Table 1). These RNAs are overlapping and they may partially arise from the same primary transcripts. Definition of RNAs classes discussed in this reviewDefinition of RNAs classes discussed in this reviewHere, I will discuss emerging aspects of transcription complexity, starting from the complexity of primary transcript production. Next, I will discuss the recent identification of a variety of novel shortened yet natural, ncRNA isoforms, their relationship with the genes they overlap, and their biogenesis. Finally, I will discuss their potential function and relate it to the classic concept of a ‘gene’, which is challenged by the identification of these novel RNAs.2. ncRNAs and isoform complexityThere is growing evidence that genes for both coding and ncRNAs produce various RNA isoforms that are shorter than the full-length transcripts, which can be primarily produced either as sRNA or alternatively by the cleavage of longer RNAs. Main pathways have been described for the production of miRNA, as well as other RNAs.13 As miRNAs are thought to be produced from introns or from independent ncRNAs, the degradation processes that result in their biogenesis (including Drosha and Dicer cleavages) have long been recognized as those that are physiologically involved in the production of functional molecules.To some extent, less is known about other sRNAs. Although there is also evidence that the degradation of other RNA occurs, it has been difficult to distinguish between (i) experimental artefacts, (ii) natural RNAs that are degradation products, and (iii) natural sRNAs that have a functional role. The scepticism of many investigators derives from the notorious instability of RNAs, which are susceptible to artificial degradation during experimental manipulations, resulting in experimental artefacts. The use of second generation sequencers is expected to resolve this issue. Since the number of RNAs that can be analysed per sample is very large (routinely obtaining 10–100 millions sequences/sample),15 there is a good chance to distinguish reproducible natural cleavage patterns from experimental artefacts. Together with experimental validation, this will ultimately help convince the sceptics, moving the focus from verification of existence to the search for biological function.3. Truncated versions of ncRNAs with well established functionsThere is growing evidence of functional RNAs that are truncated forms of tRNAs and snoRNAs. Fragments of specific length (30–40 nt) derived from tRNAs have been found to constitute a consistent part of the sRNA transcriptome.16,17 Several lines of evidence indicate that these are not random degradation products generated during RNA preparation, but truly, physiologically present in the cell. First, these short fragments, detectable as discrete bands by Northern blotting, have a non-random distribution, wherein only few tRNA genes contribute to a majority of the observed small RNAs. Secondly, onconase, an RNase produced by frog oocytes, was found to cleave tRNAs into smaller RNAs resulting in slowing the proliferation of cancerous cells.18 It has been shown that cleavage of tRNAs by the RNase Rny1p in yeast promotes Cell Death,19 and is involved in the stress response.6,20 Human tRNAse ZL was found to bind half-tRNA fragments in the cytosol, and it is now known that such complexes are capable of modifying mRNA expression levels, including those of genes involved in p53 and apoptosis.21 In addition, truncated tRNAs have been found to be essential for cell proliferation.16 Altogether, these data show that these RNAs can potentially act as regulators; most likely as messengers, signalling the arrest of cell proliferation. Given the number of mammalian RNAses A homologous to onconase, we can envisage novel findings related to the reutilization of processed tRNA fragments.Truncated isoforms of snoRNAs have also been identified and there is now evidence of interplay between snoRNA and siRNA pathways particularly in cases of truncated snoRNA fragments derived from H/ACA snoRNAs (20–24 nt) and C/D snoRNAs (17–19 and longer than 27 nt).224. ncRNA variants of protein-coding mRNAsKnown variants of mRNAs are largely constituted of splicing variants, comprehensively reviewed elsewhere.23 Here, I will mainly focus on novel types of ncRNA variants derived from genome sequences that typically generate protein coding mRNAs. Additionally, there are also very large RNAs, likely to be ncRNAs, which span multiple genes and produce transcripts across multiple loci. For instance, a broad set of enormous ncRNA transcripts have been identified, which are often transcribed across genes, some of which are known imprinted ncRNAs,24 with multiple potential mechanisms of action.10 Previous genome-wide analyses were conservatively limited to transcripts spanning up to 2 Mb of genome length,25 identifying at least 181 000 transcripts, including >1500 transcripts that seem to contain sequences of two or more adjacent known genes. However, there is now evidence of transcripts spanning chromosomal regions larger than 2 Mb. Indeed, RACE has identified transcripts that originate and terminate in chromosomal regions that are as long as several megabases.26 It is not known whether these RNAs arise from transcription through very large regions, or from as yet not well characterized formation of RNA chimeras.27Additionally, there are newly discovered ncRNAs that overlap known protein coding genes, with various possible biogenesis and role. These ncRNAs, discussed below in details (Fig. 1), overlap typical protein coding genes in various parts spanning from upstream regulatory and promoter regions down to the 3' ends. A large majority of novel ncRNAs are localized around the ends and in particular, at 5' ends, on the core promoters and to some extent also in the 3' termination regions.Complexity of transcriptome around a hypothetical gene. Green boxes represent exons of typical protein coding gene. Not all the sRNAs and genomic elements are in scale. CAGE tags (red lines; dots beyond the arrowheads indicate than the 3' ends are unknown) identify TSSs or other capped molecules; the dashed lines on CAGE tags indicate that the 3' end is not determined. Various types of transcripts are indicated by numbers: (1) protein coding mRNA transcript gene (green boxes: coding exons, gray lines, 5' and 3' untranslated regions); (2, a–c), antisense RNAs in various relation with the transcripts (3'–3' overlap, full overlap, 5'–5' overlap); (3) CAGE tags identify transcript in the 3'-UTRs, likely polyadenylated; (4) termination-associated sRNAs (TASRs); (5) exonic long-capped transcripts; (6) CAGE tags identifying TSS (exact location can vary) and may overlap PALRs; (7) PASRs (green) and tiny 18 nt long RNAs (tiRNAs, arrowhead only); (8) antisense transcription events detected by CAGE, often (but not limited to) the first exons and introns; (9) bidirectionally transcribed RNAs from core promoters; (10) ncRNA splicing isoforms only partially overlapping to coding mRNA sequences; (11) PALRs; (12) PROMPTs, unstable transcripts on upstream regulatory regions; (13) miRNAs and endogenous siRNAs (deriving mostly from other loci, not perfectly matching in most cases in animal cells); (14) other sRNAs associated to exonic-capped long transcripts. The list of different types of RNAs is continuously growing and subject to revisions and further classifications.Complexity of transcriptome around a hypothetical gene.

The list of different types of RNAs is continuously growing and subject to revisions and further classifications.A variety of long RNAs have been identified mapping around the 5' ends of genes, with as yet undefined function and biogenesis (Fig. 1). Of particular note is the antisense transcription activity at core promoters. There is evidence that both long and short, most likely ncRNAs, are transcribed starting from the core promoter in the direction opposite to the promoter and overlapping the regions upstream of the promoters. Such long RNAs have been identified by cap-analysis gene-expression (CAGE),28 which does not allow the identification of their 3' ends; however, these signals overlap tiling arrays signals, which have been instrumental to the discovery of the promoter-associated long RNAs (PALRs; longer than 100–200 nt) and promoter-associated sRNAs (PASRs; 20–100 nt long).29 It is likely that at least some of these RNAs are produced by the RNA polymerase II (Pol II). It is known that during transcription of the typical mRNAs and long ncRNAs, Pol II produces antisense RNAs for at least 50% of the promoters, and other defective short-sense RNAs in the direction of the main mRNA transcription, which might be the result of Pol II stalling on the promoters.30 At least a fraction of these RNAs are capped,30 but this capping is not limited to bidirectionally transcribed RNAs.It is likely that PASRs and PALRs include heterogeneous classes of ncRNAs of various differing lengths and mapping positions. Three other groups have identified other types of short ncRNAs overlapping the promoters: TSSa-RNAs, NRO-RNAs, and the tiRNAs (Table 1). The TSSa-RNAs are sRNAs transcribed in the opposite direction to the transcripts of known genes.31 NRO-RNAs are transcribed bidirectionally and are sRNA elongating from the transcription starting sites (TSSs). They overlap with PASRs and PALRs, but they may be shorter and less stable.32 Additionally, a class of shorter RNAs associated with promoters (tiny RNAs or tiRNAs) has been recently discovered. tiRNAs have a narrow size distribution, on average 18 nt, and are specifically located about 20 nt downstream of the transcriptions start site.33 Their lack of overlap with the TSS suggests that tiRNAs are not simply abortive transcripts but are produced by some alternative mechanisms. In general, caution is advised in interpreting these new classes based on size, as the length may correspond to preferential sizes targeted in the experiments.Not all PASRs necessarily overlap the TSSs, suggesting that at least some of these RNAs are not abortive Pol II products, but rather processed RNAs, some of which may have been cleaved and perhaps recapped30 to serve as yet unknown functions.Further experiments are necessary to clarify and distinguish their function. Besides the possibility that they are simply by-products of RNA transcription and processing, there are exciting possibilities that they may be involved, together with various proteins, in the local and global regulation of the epigenomic machinery at the promoter level. It is likely that they are involved in triple helix regulation,34 or bound to various yet unknown proteins to regulate transcription (potential mechanisms discussed elsewhere10). Identification of their interactors (protein, RNA, promoters, 3D structures, other structures of the chromatin) will allow a more functional classification and a better understanding of whether these RNAs can be considered genes, because of their potential role as regulatory nuclear RNAs.5. Transcripts diverging from the core promotersGenomic regions that are transcribed on either or both of the two genomic strands, producing overlapping sets of transcripts, can be defined as transcriptional forests. Transcriptional forests can extend up to 1–2 kb upstream of the TSS of known mRNAs and PASRs. Transcripts upstream of core promoters, known as PROMPTs, are inherently unstable and could only be unambiguously identified by stabilizing the exosome.35 PROMPTs are thought to be longer than 500 nt, although their exact length has not been fully investigated. Because of their location and instability, they resemble a class of yeast RNA called cryptic unstable transcripts.36,37 PROMPTs are intriguing in their biogenesis. They are found to be transcribed in both orientations; pointing away from the mRNA coding gene and pointing towards the gene from 1 to 2 kb upstream regions. It seems probable that PROMPTs transcribed diverging away from the gene (or the main mRNA promoter) could be promoted from the bidirectional activity inherent of promoters. However, PROMPTs are also identified as being transcribed in the same orientation of the downstream sense mRNA (transcribed from the distal region towards the TSS of mRNAs). Intriguingly, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analyses reveal that such PROMPTs do not have an upstream, distal promoter that could possibly transcribe RNAs towards the gene. This phenomenon suggests the existence of alternative mechanisms to produce PROMPTs, which do not depend on known types of promoters. One possibility is that these RNAs are produced by a mechanism which depends on RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP). Indeed, the human TERT, generally involved in the elongation of the telomeres, has recently been discovered in human cells to have RDRP38 activity. RNA could be transcribed outwards using the inherent bidirectional transcriptional activity of Pol II promoters. Next, RDRP activity could use any RNA secondary structure to prime transcription towards the original promoters. Such RNAs, or a part of them, would be degraded by the exosome, while some unknown fractions might be reprocessed to generate shorter RNAs. Indeed long PROMPTs were identified only upon stabilization of the exosome, but it seems likely that these transcripts may otherwise be processed into shorter RNA, such as the PASRs or the TSSa-RNAs, and act locally. In this regard, it is intriguing that CAGE signals identified capped RNAs overlapping PROMPTs and PASRs. Since cap structures functionally stabilize RNAs, it is likely that at least some of the PASRs may be produced by cleavage of long RNA followed by re-capping. It may well be that all these RNAs are a part of a complex machinery to produce regulatory RNAs around core promoters and upstream regions. Alternatively, PROMPTs might be transcribed without a promoter. The structure of the chromatin, genome-wide organized in loops,39,40 might be such that the core promoter elements are in close proximity not only with the upstream regulatory elements but also to upstream regions, which could then generate RNAs due to the high concentration of transcription machinery elements.Transcription through a given area, like PROMPTs do, has consequences. Transcription often activates neighbouring genes, for instance, genes that respond early to external stimuli.41 There are several examples where transcription through regulatory regions can have either a repressor or an activator role, as reviewed elsewhere.10Expanding on upstream transcripts, we have recently found that retrotransposon elements (REs) are transcribed in a tissue-specific manner, providing at least 200 000 TSS in the human genome. These RE elements show low-to-moderate expression levels.42,43 More than 117 000 human TSSs are positioned upstream of genes producing RNAs that are in the same orientation with the downstream protein coding mRNA. In more than two-third of the cases, these RNAs overlap the first exons, implying their potential as alternative promoters.43 However, further studies are necessary to comprehensively map their termination sites, it is plausible that a part of them constitute ncRNAs spanning promoters such as the PALRs or PROMPTs. The expression of these RE RNAs is mostly positively correlated with the expression of downstream genes. It is likely that the REs not working as alternative promoters might function by producing RNAs that activate the downstream chromatin regions. RE-derived RNAs may also form sense–antisense and sRNAs.43 Since the mRNAs that contain repeat elements in their 3'-UTR ends are generally less expressed than those devoid of them, these RNAs may also act in trans as negative regulators of transcription (and perhaps translation).6. Shortened RNA recapping: is stabilization functional?Surprisingly, at least a fraction of the PASRs and other shortened RNAs, whose 5' ends map in the middle of mRNAs, have been found to carry a cap structure, most likely due to recapping after cleavage of larger RNAs.30 However, the cap has been considered a peculiarity of full-length mRNAs and some of the RNA polymerase III RNAs. Cap is known to stabilize RNAs, is this then suggesting that truncated RNAs are functionally relevant? There is evidence that transfection of different PASRs, mapping either upstream or downstream of the TSS of the MYC gene, negatively regulate the expression of the MYC mRNA, irrespective of the PASRs sense or antisense orientation.30Identification of recapped RNAs is not limited to promoter regions. The CAGE technology44,45 identifies capping sites along various regions of long mRNAs. Besides known and novel promoters, CAGE signals also identify capped molecules overlapping exons. Existence of these capped RNAs was further verified by isolating them using an antibody directed against the cap, followed by sequencing.30 These capped exonic transcripts do not correlate with gene expression measured at the main promoter, suggesting that they are not randomly degraded products. Instead, truncated RNA CAGE signals correlate with a specific type of promoter. Promoters can be grouped based on their shape as broad or sharp. The TSSs are distributed over 50–100 bp and are often associated with CpG islands in broad promoters. In sharp promoters, TSSs originate mainly at a single genomic position and are often associated with TATA boxes.46 CAGE tags corresponding to truncated exonic transcripts are more frequently associated with the sharp TATA-box promoters.47 Although no mechanisms have so far been identified, it is tempting to hypothesize that the regulation of sharp promoters may require these seemingly aberrant exonic transcripts.Interestingly, Gingeras group at CSHL have observed clusters of both long and sRNAs that overlap these exonic CAGE tag clusters.30 The sRNAs (<200 nt) are likely to be produced by cleavage and reprocessing of the longer RNAs into shorter RNAs.What is the connection between associations of exonic-capped RNAs with TATA box, sharp promoters, and cleavage-recapping events? The association of exonic transcripts with genes having sharp promoters would suggest that these transcripts are involved in regulating specific type of transcription. However, it is not known if these transcripts are localized in the nucleus or in the cytoplasm. Intriguingly, the CAGE exonic tags can be aligned to spliced mRNAs implying that the secondary processing and recapping takes place after splicing. Do these secondary-capped RNAs have the same 7-methyl-guanosine cap of mRNAs? The determination of the type of cap will be of primary importance, as the tri-methylated cap is used to import some snRNAs into the nucleus.48 Interestingly, a cytoplasmic capping enzyme has recently been identified,49 which has been shown to recap processed longer mRNA fragments transcribed from the globin locus. It is likely that this enzyme is involved in recapping other cleaved RNAs as well, some of which may be imported into the nucleus for further processing or signalling. Alternatively, processed recapped cytoplasmic RNAs may interact with the translation machinery, thus regulating translation. Processed capped RNAs could be produced in association with the splicing machinery in the nucleus, acting locally or being later exported to the cytoplasm.The ENCODE project is providing additional transcript maps, which will help address these genome-wide questions by mapping the specific cell compartments, including cytoplasm, polysomes, and other nuclear compartments in which these capped RNAs are specifically located. A further issue concerns the potential new roles of known RNA-processing and binding proteins, such as the RNAi and piRNA pathways and their specific role in nuclear compartments together with these novel short ncRNAs.7. Capped transcripts near the 3' endsThe regions near the 3' ends of genes also show a notable transcriptome complexity. Here, longer antisense RNAs have been identified.5,50 This region is known to generate the termination-associated RNAs (TASRs)29 which are a class of heterogeneous size RNAs that span the regions upstream and downstream to the termination site, identified by tiling arrays using sRNA fractions.29 In addition, CAGE has identified capped transcripts that originate close to the transcription termination site. These were verified by RACE to be at least 100–200 nt long, thus being longer than TASRs. These transcripts originating from the 3'-UTR appear to differ from TASRs, as they do not extend beyond the known polyadenylation site. A lack of extensive overlap between CAGE-identified transcripts and TASRs, downstream of the termination site, suggests that a proportion of the TASRs may be non-capped transcripts mapping outside the conventional borders of the genes. The fact that 3'-UTR transcripts are preferentially identified in oligo-dT primed libraries (and poorly in random primed ones) indicates that they terminate at known polyadenylation sites with a poly-A tail. Notably, these are RNAs overlapping to 3'-UTRs, which are main targets of a plethora of regulatory mechanisms including RNA localization, control of stabilization, miRNA targets, and may be the target of RE-derived RNAs.43 There have been relatively fewer studies regarding these ncRNAs at the 3' ends compared with the ncRNAs at the 5' ends. However, the genes in the nucleus are not located linearly but rather the chromatin is organized in loops and interacting zones. Thus, it is likely that the analysis of global chromatin interactions39,40 integrated with ncRNAs and other DNA binding proteins may provide evidence of larger complexes that regulate gene expression, which may include at least some of these ncRNAs.8. Are these RNA genes?It is important to note that not all the known sRNAs, such as miRNAs or piRNAs, have been described here, as others have extensively reviewed the field.51–53 The role of miRNAs as a gene is not disputed any longer. However, the novel types of short or shortened RNAs identified in large scale projects are challenging current gene models, because of their abundance, likely partial redundancy of action, and assessment of phenotype. Due to the particularly large number of these ncRNAs, new high-throughput strategies are needed to test their function, since current mutagenesis approaches are unlikely to resolve their role.It has been relatively straightforward to define a ‘gene’ as the genomic region, which produces a given mRNA, which in turn produces one or more protein isoforms. Similarly, the identification of a genomic region that produces a RNA that is further processed to produce a miRNA could also be unambiguously defined as a ‘miRNA gene’. Similarly, large ncRNAs, called LincRNAs54,55 that were identified in intergenic regions and therefore far from complicated genic regions with sense–antisense transcription, can also be easily called ‘genes’, mainly because a function could be identified for several of them. However, a large part of the job ahead requires understanding and classifying the most challenging cases, the ncRNAs of various sizes overlapping intermingled known genes discussed in this review.Overlapping transcripts probably account for a majority of the genomic output making phenotype and functional assessment far more complicated. For most, if not all genes, we are identifying sets of long to short transcripts overlapping the regulatory or coding regions. Are we genomicists simply dissecting the background generated around the transcription machinery, composed of a large fraction of sRNA by-products? Or are we dissecting a whole microcosm of functional RNA components around regulatory regions, which are acting with an unforeseen complexity? It is unlikely that these ncRNAs are just experimental noise. Also, it is incorrect to label them as ‘biological noise’ for the reason that we have not yet understood their functions.Dissection of the function of individual sRNAs is particularly challenging, because individual sRNAs may only moderately regulate gene activity; below the statistically significant range of our experimental standards. However, these ncRNAs may cooperatively contribute to gene expression and thus cellular fates and phenotypes. Indeed biology is not composed of single molecules, but networks of molecules, thus creative assays will be required to test multiple ncRNAs in cooperation. Biological networks are usually robust,56 therefore functional perturbation studies might require to target multiple RNAs at once.Perhaps sRNAs and other ncRNAs, including overlapping ncRNAs, might not be after all independent genes but a part of a ‘RNA regulome’ of gene expression. Gene regulation in eukaryotes is much more complex than the model of a bacterial operon controlled by a single promoter, and these ncRNAs could be the emerging components of this regulatory machine. If we think of multiple transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) regulating a eukaryotic promoter, a single TFBS might be dispensed with under certain conditions to produce an mRNA or a phenotype. sRNAs or ncRNAs overlapping specific genes may have subtle effects at an individual level; however, several such ncRNAs could push the system beyond a certain threshold causing differential gene regulation and potentially altered phenotype, acting for instance on the epigenomic regulation of promoters. Altogether, these sets of ncRNAs could be minor components of the larger ‘regulome’ of specific genes, acting in cis or in trans and interacting with the epigenomic machinery.Should we move towards a global recognition of these RNA regulons as counterparts of protein coding genes, for all of those overlapping transcripts? Or is a gene composed of multiple elements including the mRNA and isoforms, splicing factors, promoters, enhancers, and ‘RNA regulons’? After all, what defines a gene and its borders?FundingThe author is supported by a grant of the 7th Framework of the EU commission to the Dopaminet consortium, a Grant-in-Aids for Scientific Research (A) No. 20241047, a Research Grant for RIKEN Omics Science Center from MEXT and by an U54 ENCODE grant from NIH-NHGRI.The authors would like to thank Miki Nishikawa for support in the preparation of the manuscript and Alistair Forrest and Alka Saxena for the critical reading of the manuscript."

IntroductionGlycogen is a major intracellular reserve polymer consisting of a-1,4-linked glucose subunits with a-1,6-linked glucose at the branching points, which accumulates in Escherichia coli and other bacteria under conditions of limiting growth when an excess of carbon source is available and other nutrients are deficient.1–3 The exact role of this polyglucan in bacteria is still not well-defined, but several works have linked glycogen metabolism to environmental survival, symbiotic performance and colonization and virulence.4–12Bacterial glycogen is produced by the concerted action of glycogen synthase (GlgA) and branching enzyme (GlgB) using ADP-glucose (ADPG) as the sugar donor nucleotide.1 Since the initial demonstration that ADPG serves as the precursor molecule for bacterial glycogen biosynthesis,13 it has been considered that ADPG pyrophosphorylase (GlgC) is the sole enzyme catalyzing the production of ADPG in these organisms.14 However, recent reports have provided evidence about the occurrence of other important sources of ADPG linked to glycogen biosynthesis in bacterial species such as E. coli, Salmonella, Streptomyces coelicolor and Mycobacterium tuberculosis.11,15–17 Genes involved in glycogen metabolism in enterobacterial species, such as E. coli and Salmonella enterica, are clustered in two apparently independent transcriptional units designated as glgBX (encoding GlgB and debranching GlgX enzymes) and glgCAP [comprising genes coding for the glycogen anabolic enzymes GlgC and GlgA, and the catabolic glycogen phosphorylase (GlgP)].1Regulation of E. coli glycogen metabolism involves a complex assemblage of factors that are adjusted to the physiological and energetic status of the cell,2,3,18,19 and cell-to-cell communication.20 At the level of enzyme activity, glycogen metabolism is subjected to the allosteric regulation of GlgC by different glycolitic intermediates.14 Also, E. coli GlgP activity is regulated by the phosphorylation status of the carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS) protein Hpr.21 At the level of gene expression, several factors have been described to control E. coli glycogen accumulation. This includes negative regulation by the carbon storage regulator CsrA and by the still unidentified glgQ regulatory locus,22–24 and positive regulation by guanosine 5'-triphosphate 3'-diphosphate and/or guanosine 5'-diphosphate 3'-diphosphate [(p)ppGpp] stringent response regulators3,25–28 and by the PhoP–PhoQ regulatory system at low environmental Mg2+ concentration.3 Different experimental evidences also indicate positive regulation of glgCAP expression by the cyclic AMP/cyclic AMP receptor protein complex29–31 (however, for an opposite view, see Montero et al.3 and Hengge-Aronis and Fischer32). The general stress regulator RpoS does not regulate glgCAP expression, but positively controls the expression of glgS, a gene whose product exerts a positive effect on glycogen accumulation.32We have recently initiated a series of studies aimed to uncover mechanisms regulating bacterial glycogen metabolism and its connection with other biological processes. Using a systematic and comprehensive gene-disrupted mutant collection of E. coli (the Keio collection33), we carried out genome-wide screenings of genes affecting glycogen metabolism in this bacterial species.2,3 Our studies revealed that bacterial glycogen metabolism is highly interconnected with a wide variety of cellular processes and proposed an integrated metabolic model wherein glycogen metabolism is influenced by the stringent and general stress responses, end-turnover of tRNA, intracellular AMP levels, nutrient transport and metabolism, low extra-cellular Mg2+ availability and energy production.3 To further investigate the mechanisms regulating bacterial glycogen metabolism and its connection with other biological processes, in this work, we have carried out a genome-wide analysis of glycogen content using the ASKA library, a set of 4123 clones expressing all predicted ORFs of an E. coli K-12 derivative.34 The overall data presented in this work reinforce the idea that glycogen metabolism is highly interconnected with a wide variety of cellular processes and is adjusted to the bacterial energy and nutritional status. Furthermore, we provide evidence showing that glycogen metabolism is also affected by factors determining intercellular communication, aggregative and social behaviour modes.2. Materials and methods2.1. Bacterial strains and culture conditionsWe used the ASKA library, a set of 4123 different clones of the AG1 E. coli K-12 strain (recA1 endA1 gyrA96 thi-1 hsdR17(rK_mKþ) supE44 relA1), each expressing one of all predicted E. coli K-12 ORFs.34 For quantitative measurement of glycogen content, cells were grown at 37°C with rapid gyratory shaking in liquid Kornberg medium (1.1% K2HPO4, 0.85% KH2PO4, 0.6% yeast extract from Duchefa, Haarlem, the Netherlands) supplemented with 50 mM glucose and 1 mM MgCl2 after inoculation with 1 vol. of an overnight culture per 50 volumes of fresh medium. The culture medium was not supplemented with IPTG. Cultures entering the stationary phase were centrifuged at 4400g for 15 min, and the collected cells were rinsed with fresh Kornberg medium, resuspended in 40 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.5) and disrupted by sonication as described previously.2 Solid culture medium was prepared by adding 1.8% bacteriological agar to liquid Kornberg medium before autoclaving.2.2. Screening of ASKA clones with altered glycogen contentA first screening of glycogen in the different bacterial clones of the ASKA collection after growth on solid glucose Kornberg medium was carried out employing the iodine staining method. In the presence of iodine vapours, ‘glycogen-excess’ clones stained darker than its brownish parent cells, whereas ‘glycogen-deficient’ clones stained yellow.16 Clones identified using this procedure were subsequently cultured in liquid glucose Kornberg medium and subjected to the quantitative measurement of glycogen content at the onset of the stationary phase using an amyloglucosidase/hexokinase/glucose-6P dehydrogenase-based test kit from Sigma. Intracellular glycogen content was referred to protein, which was measured using a Bio-Rad (USA) prepared reagent. The function of each gene whose enhanced expression affects glycogen accumulation was assigned by referring to the EchoBASE (http://ecoli-york.org/)35 and EcoCyc (http://www.ecocyc.org/)36 databases.2.3. Morphotype evaluationTo monitor the expression of curli and cellulose biosynthesis, 10 µl of a bacterial overnight culture suspended in water to an absorbance at 600 nm of five were spotted onto TY agar plates (1% Bacto Tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 1.5% bacteriological agar) supplemented with 40 µg ml-1 Congo red and 20 µg ml-1 Coomassie brilliant blue.37 Plates were incubated at 28°C for 5 days, and dye binding was evaluated by red colour intensity. The multicellular rdar morphotype is characterized by a red, dry and rough aspect on Congo red agar plates, which is determined by the expression of extracellular matrix components such as cellulose and adhesive curli fimbriae.38 The appearance of a pink colony (pdar morphotype) is indicative of cellulose biosynthesis.39 Capacity for cellulose production was also qualitatively analyzed by assessing the level of calcofluor white (Fluorescent brightener 28; Sigma) binding of colonies grown on TY agar plates supplemented with 50 µg ml-1 of this dye. Fluorescence of the cells was observed under a 366 nm UV light source and compared with the wild-type (WT) strain.2.4. General molecular techniquesRoutine DNA manipulations were performed following standard procedures.40 Plasmids were extracted by Quantum Prep plasmid mini-prep kit (Bio-Rad). <U+0394>relA cells of the Keio collection33 expressing relA in trans were obtained by incorporation of relA- expression vector of the ASKA library. DNA sequencing was carried out in Secugen (Madrid). Sequence homologies to genes in the GenBank database were determined by using the BLAST algorithm of the National Center for Biotechnology Information at the National Library of Medicine.2.5. Analytical proceduresBacterial growth was followed spectrophotometrically by measuring the absorbance of cultures at 600 nm. Protein contents in bacterial extracts were measured by the Coomassie G dye-binding method using a Bio-Rad prepared reagent.3. Results and discussion3.1. Screening, identification and classification of genes whose enhanced expression affects glycogen accumulationClones of ASKA collection were first screened for altered glycogen content in solid glucose Kornberg medium. In the presence of iodine vapours, ‘glycogen-excess’ clones stained darker than their brownish parent cells, whereas ‘glycogen-deficient’ clones stained yellow. On inspecting the ASKA library, 28 clones (0.7% of the library) displayed ‘glycogen-excess’ phenotypes, whereas 58 clones (1.4% of the library) displayed yellow, ‘glycogen-deficient’ phenotypes. Subsequent quantitative glycogen measurement analyses on cells entering the stationary phase confirmed that the 86 selected clones accumulate altered levels of glycogen (Fig. 1).Glycogen content (referred as percentage of glycogen accumulated by WT cells) of glycogen-excess and glycogen-deficient clones of the ASKA library. Averaged glycogen content in WT cells was 45 nmol glucose mg protein-1. Cells were grown at 37°C with rapid gyratory shaking in liquid Kornberg medium (1.1% K2HPO4, 0.85% KH2PO4, 0.6% yeast extract) supplemented with 50 mM glucose. Because some yeast extracts are deficient in Mg2+,3 and because Mg2+ is a major determinant of cell metabolic and energetic status and of expression of genes affecting glycogen metabolism,91,92 the Kornberg medium was also supplemented with 1 mM MgCl2.Glycogen content (referred as percentage of glycogen accumulated by WT cells) of glycogen-excess and glycogen-deficient clones of the ASKA library.

In some cases, the families are clearly meaningful, with the presence of multiple genes of related function, reinforcing the validity of their identification in the survey. Yet, a large group of 28 clones, representing one-third of the clones identified, express genes about which little or nothing is known such as glgS, gspD, mdtG, ppdB, rutF, smg, ucpA, yabI, yafV, ybcV, ycbJ, yciN, ydcJ, yegH, yfaY, yfdN, yfeD, yfjR, yhcE, yjcC, yjcQ, ylcG, ymgC, ynbD, yncC, yncG, yoaE and yqjA.Escherichia coli genes whose enhanced expression caused a ‘glycogen-excess’ phenotype in cells of the ASKA library entering the stationary phaseGenes are classified into COG categories.35,36,41 The numbers in parentheses represent the number of glycogen-related genes to the number of genes belonging to each of COG category.Escherichia coli genes whose enhanced expression caused a ‘glycogen-excess’ phenotype in cells of the ASKA library entering the stationary phaseGenes are classified into COG categories.35,36,41 The numbers in parentheses represent the number of glycogen-related genes to the number of genes belonging to each of COG category.Escherichia coli genes whose enhanced expression caused a ‘glycogen-deficient’ phenotypeGenes are classified into COG categories.35,36,41 The numbers in parentheses represent the number of glycogen-related genes to the number of genes belonging to each of COG category.Escherichia coli genes whose enhanced expression caused a ‘glycogen-deficient’ phenotypeGenes are classified into COG categories.35,36,41 The numbers in parentheses represent the number of glycogen-related genes to the number of genes belonging to each of COG category.The general trend observed after this analysis indicates that glycogen metabolism of E. coli cells cultured in glucose Kornberg medium is affected by genes whose products can be embodied in the following groups: Carbon sensing, transport and metabolism;general stress response;stringent response;factors determining intercellular communication, aggregative and social behaviour;nitrogen metabolism;energy status.As expected from the glycogen synthetic roles of GlgA and GlgC, glgA and glgC over-expressing bacteria of the ASKA library displayed glycogen-excess phenotypes (Fig. 1). In fact, these bacteria presented the highest levels of glycogen accumulation of the whole collection. In agreement also with the assigned function of GlgP and AspP in E. coli glycogen breakdown,42,43 AG1 cells over-expressing glgP and aspP showed reduced glycogen accumulation (Fig. 1). Noteworthy, although GlgB is a glycogen anabolic enzyme, glgB over-expressing cells of the ASKA library displayed a glycogen-deficient phenotype (Fig. 1). This could be ascribed to the fact that glycogen granule architecture is the result of the highly orchestrated actions of GlgB and other glycogen enzymes, which may collapse under GlgB overproduction conditions.44The global regulator of carbon metabolism CsrA is an RNA-binding protein, which is thought to prevent glycogen biosynthesis by both promoting glgCAP decay and translation.24,45 Consistently, csrA over-expressing bacteria of the ASKA library displayed a glycogen-deficient phenotype (Fig. 1). CsrA activity is antagonized by the two CsrB and CsrC non-coding RNAs,46–48 which in turn are targeted by CsrD for RNase E degradation.49 Thus and consistent with the assigned role of CsrD as relieving CsrA function from CsrB and CsrC, csrD over-expressing cells of the ASKA library displayed a glycogen-deficient phenotype (Fig. 1).malP and malT over-expressing bacteria of the ASKA collection displayed glycogen-deficient phenotypes (Fig. 1). MalT is a transcriptional regulator of genes involved in maltose/maltodextrin transport and metabolism.50,51 MalP, over which MalT exerts a positive control, catalyzes the phosphorolytic breakdown of maltodextrins. However, MalP poorly recognizes large and highly branched polyglucans such as glycogen,42 suggesting an indirect rather than a direct effect of malP over-expression on glycogen accumulation. In this respect, previous studies have indicated tight, albeit still not well characterized, links between glycogen and maltodextrin metabolisms.52,53PTS is a major determinant of transport and phosphorylation of a large number of carbohydrates including glucose.21,54,55 PTS mutants impaired in sensing and transport of glucose accumulate low glycogen content.3 It is therefore conceivable that over-expression of some PTS components would result in enhanced glycogen content in cells cultured in glucose Kornberg medium, whereas cells over-expressing the Mlc transcriptional repressor of PTS genes56 would display a glycogen-deficient phenotype. Confirming this presumptions ptsI over-expressing bacteria of the ASKA library displayed a glycogen-excess phenotype (Fig. 1), whereas cells ectopically expressing the Mlc transcriptional repressor of PTS genes displayed a glycogen-deficient phenotype (Fig. 1).Different genetic studies indicate a requirement of the general stress regulator RpoS as a positive modulator of glycogen biosynthesis.2,3,57 In agreement, rpoS over-expressing cells of the ASKA library displayed a glycogen-excess phenotype (Fig. 1). It has been shown that RpoS up-regulates the expression of glgS, a gene whose product exerts a positive effect on glycogen accumulation.2,32 Consistently, glgS over-expressing cells of the ASKA library displayed a glycogen-excess phenotype (Fig. 1).During nutrient starvation, E. coli elicits the so-called ‘stringent response’ that switches the cell from a growth-related mode to a maintenance/survival mode.58,59 The hallmark of this pleiotropic physiological response is the accumulation of the alarmones pppGpp and ppGpp.58–60 Although ppGpp is more abundant than pppGpp, the relative effects of these two regulatory nucleotides have not been thoroughly examined, their levels depending on the synthesis of pppGpp by RelA and SpoT, the hydrolysis of pppGpp to ppGpp by Gpp, and the breakdown of ppGpp by the bifunctional enzyme SpoT.58–62 (p)ppGpp binds bacterial RNA polymerase to increase transcription of amino acid biosynthesis genes during amino acid starvation and to down-regulate the transcription of ‘stable’ RNAs (rRNAs and tRNAs) genes.58,59 As transcription of genes coding for components of the translation apparatus account for a large percentage of transcription in exponentially growing cells, the liberation of RNA polymerase from these genes is thought to passively allow up-regulation of diverse promoters activated at the onset of stationary phase.63Different in vivo and in vitro experimental evidences have linked the E. coli stringent response and (p)ppGpp accumulation with increased glycogen contents and enhanced expression of glg genes at the onset of the stationary phase.25–28 Consistent with the involvement of (p)ppGpp in regulatory aspects of glycogen metabolism, and also consistent with the assigned functions of SpoT and Gpp in (p)ppGpp degradation,64,65 both spoT and gpp over-expressing cells of the ASKA collection displayed glycogen-deficient phenotypes (Fig. 1).We recently found that <U+0394>relA cells of the E. coli Keio collection33 display reduced glycogen contents and restricted expression of glgC::lacZ transcriptional fusions3 (see also Fig. 2), which further fortifies the view that (p)ppGpp plays an important role in glycogen accumulation in E. coli. AG1 strain used in the ASKA library as plasmids recipient has been annotated as a K-12 derivative relA1 mutant.34relA1 mutants possess little or residual pppGpp synthase activity, which is due to an IS2 insertion between the 85th and 86th codons of the WT relA structural gene.66 It is thus conceivable that relA over-expressing cells of the ASKA collection would display a glycogen-excess phenotype. Surprisingly, however, these cells displayed glycogen levels similar to those of control AG1 cells (Fig. 2A and B). To understand why the relA over-expressing cells of the ASKA library accumulate glycogen levels comparable to those of control cells, we sequenced the relA gene of AG1 cells. This analysis revealed that relA of AG1 does not contain any mutation (not shown). To explore whether this phenomenon could be ascribed to the possible occurrence of secondary mutations in AG1 cells or to defects of the ASKA library relA expression vector, we analyzed the glycogen contents in <U+0394>relA cells of the Keio mutant collection transformed with the ASKA library relA expression vector. These cells were constructed on a K-12 derivative BW25113 strain, which is normal for the relA function. As shown in Fig. 2C and D, ectopic expression of relA complemented the glycogen-deficient phenotype of <U+0394>relA cells, the overall data thus showing that (i) AG1 cells are not relA1 mutants, (ii) the relA expression vector of the ASKA library codes for an active RelA form and (iii) ectopic expression of relA does not lead to enhancement of glycogen accumulation.AG1 is not a relA1 mutant. In (A) and (B), relA over-expressing cells of the ASKA library accumulate WT glycogen content. In (C) and (D), relA expression vector of the ASKA library complements the glycogen-deficient phenotype of <U+0394>relA cells of the Keio collection. <U+0394>glgA cells of the Keio collection are used as negative control for glycogen accumulation.AG1 is not a relA1 mutant. In (A) and (B), relA over-expressing cells of the ASKA library accumulate WT glycogen content. In (C) and (D), relA expression vector of the ASKA library complements the glycogen-deficient phenotype of <U+0394>relA cells of the Keio collection. <U+0394>glgA cells of the Keio collection are used as negative control for glycogen accumulation.We have recently shown that glycogen metabolism may also be subjected to regulation by cell-to-cell communication.20 In E. coli, swimming, swarming and adherence of cells to surfaces or to one another by biofilm formation are fundamental modes to communicate and to coordinately regulate metabolic processes. Communication, aggregative and social behaviour modes are highly determined by environmental cues and act as major determinants of the nutritional status of the cell, which as discussed above is a major determinant of glycogen accumulation. The following data provided evidence that factors determining intercellular communication, aggregative and social behaviour (Supplementary Fig. S1) are important determinants of glycogen content in E. coli, although further studies are required to get a clear picture of the link between the different factors involved. First, enhanced expression of the poorly characterized yncC, yncG and ymgC genes (all down-regulated in the mqsR biofilm deficient mutants67) resulted in increased glycogen content (Fig. 1). yncC encodes a transcription factor that positively affects biofilm formation by repressing production of the biofilm matrix component colanic acid,68 whereas ymgC is an orphan gene belonging to the ymgABC operon whose transcription is repressed in young and mature biofilms, but is induced in the intermediate, developed biofilms.69 Although the function of ymgC is still unknown, ymgA and ymgB strongly promote the synthesis of colanic acid, and virtually eliminate the expression of adhesive curli fimbriae genes.Second, gaining-of-function of GGDEF and EAL domain enzymes controlling the intracellular levels of cyclic diguanylate (a secondary messenger that regulates the transition from the motile, planktonic state to sessile, community-based behaviours in different bacteria39,70,71) resulted in changes in the intracellular glycogen content. For instance, up-regulation of YeaP (a diguanylate cyclase that positively regulates the expression of csg genes involved in curli and cellulose production72) exerted a negative effect on glycogen accumulation (Fig. 1). In contrast, up-regulation of YjcC (a predicted cyclic diguanylate phosphodiesterase that down-regulates the expression of the CsgD central regulator of extra-cellular matrix components37,38,73) and Dos (a cyclic diguanylate phosphodiesterase74) resulted in enhanced glycogen content (Fig. 1).Third, some ASKA clones ectopically expressing functions that participate in the synthesis of biofilm components and/or precursors displayed glycogen deficient phenotypes. Thus, ectopic expression of Wzc (an autophosphorylating protein-tyrosine kinase that prevents the production of colanic acid75,76), GalS (a repressor of metabolism of galactose linked to the synthesis of colanic acid and other exopolysaccharide components77,78), and NagB (a d-glucosamine 6-P isomerase that prevents the synthesis of major components of the cell envelope such as peptidoglycans and lipopolysaccharides79) resulted in a glycogen-deficient phenotype (Fig. 1).It is known that carbon metabolism is subject to regulation by nitrogen availability, although the mechanisms involved are still obscure. PtsN is a member of the nitrogen-related PTS, which has been associated with balancing of nitrogen and carbon metabolism,80 and regulation of the RpoE-dependent cell envelope stress response and potassium uptake.81,82 Most recently, evidence has been provided suggesting the occurrence of cross-talk between sugar-PTS and nitrogen-related PTS.83 Consistent with this view, the ptsN overproducing cells of the ASKA library displayed a marked glycogen-deficient phenotype when cultured in glucose Kornberg medium (Fig. 1).Yeast extract (the amino acid source of the Kornberg medium employed in this work) is deficient in various amino acids.2,84 Mutants impaired in cysteine biosynthesis entering the stationary phase display a glycogen-excess phenotype when they are cultured in the Kornberg medium, which is ascribed to stringent response-mediated up-regulation of glg genes occurring when the culture medium is deficient in cysteine precursors.2 Consistent with the view that the stringent response favourably affects glycogen accumulation in E. coli, serB, cysI and cysP over-expressing cells of the ASKA library (all ectopically expressing genes involved in cysteine biosynthesis) accumulated lower levels of glycogen than WT cells at the onset of the stationary phase (Fig. 1). tdcA positively regulates the expression of tdcB and tdcC genes, which code for biodegradative proteins involved in threonine and serine metabolism.85,86 Also consistent with the view that the lack of internal amino acid provision positively affects glycogen accumulation, tdcA over-expressing cells of the ASKA library displayed a glycogen-excess phenotype (Fig. 1).Because intracellular ATP level is a major determinant of glycogen accumulation,3,18 it is conceivable that any factor affecting ATP availability will also affect glycogen accumulation. In fact, deletion mutants lacking components required for the proper functioning of the aerobic electron transport chain and ATP generation displayed a glycogen-deficient phenotype.2,3 Consistent with this view, bacteria with enhanced expression of cytosolic enzymes likely competing with GlgC for the same ATP pool, such as RecQ (an ATP-dependent DNA helicase87), NagD (a promiscuous ribo and deoxyribonucleoside tri-, di- and monophosphatase88), and Ppk (an ATP requiring enzyme that catalyzes the production of polyphosphate89) displayed glycogen-deficient phenotypes (Fig. 1).Glutathione is a major determinant of cell redox status, playing a prime role in maintaining the correct assembly of electron transport chain components.90 It is therefore conceivable that factors altering the intracellular glutathione levels will also affect ATP and glycogen formation. In agreement with this presumption, bacteria with enhanced expression of GorA (a glutathione reductase) and CydC (a protein involved in the transport of glutathione from the cytosol to the periplasm90) displayed glycogen deficient phenotypes (Fig. 1).3.2. Proposal of an integrated model for the regulation of glycogen metabolism in E. coliResults presented in this work further strengthen the view that glycogen metabolism is highly interconnected with a wide variety of cellular processes.2,3 Figure 3 illustrates a suggested model of glycogen metabolism in E. coli wherein major determinants of glycogen accumulation include intracellular concentration and availability of ATP for ADPG synthesis, levels of ppGpp (which accumulates in a RelA- SpoT- and/or Gpp-dependent manner under conditions of limited provision of nutrients such as amino acids, sulphur, Mg2+, iron, etc.), factors determining intercellular communication, aggregative and social behaviour modes (which in turn determine the nutritional status of the cell), expression levels of the general stress regulator RpoS and of the global regulator CsrA, availability of a carbon source and less well-defined systems sensing the cell energy status through the activity of the electron transport chain.Suggested model of glycogen metabolism in E. coli wherein major determinants of glycogen accumulation include availability of ATP for ADPG synthesis, levels of (p)ppGpp (which accumulates in a RelA- SpoT- and/or Gpp-dependent manner under conditions of limited provision of nutrients such as amino acids, sulphur, Mg2+, iron, etc.), factors determining intercellular communication, aggregative and social behaviour modes (which in turn determine the nutritional status of the cell), expression levels of the general stress regulator RpoS and of the global regulator CsrA, availability of a carbon source, redox status of the cell and less well-defined systems sensing the cell energy status through the activity of the electron transport chain.

A total of 171 mainly gene-based, sequence-tagged site loci served as bridging points for comparing the Lu. angustifolius genome with the genome sequence of the model legume, Lotus japonicus via BLASTn homology searching. Comparative analysis indicated that the genomes of Lu. angustifolius and Lo. japonicus are highly diverged structurally but with significant regions of conserved synteny including the region of the Lu. angustifolius genome containing the pod-shatter resistance gene, lentus. We discuss the potential of synteny analysis for identifying candidate genes for domestication traits in Lu. angustifolius and in improving our understanding of Fabaceae genome evolution.1. IntroductionComparative genetics and genomics use knowledge from different species to define important evolutionary relationships, an important aspect of which is the physical and genetic synteny (two or more homologous loci found on a single chromosome) and collinearity (conserved linear order of loci) between any two species that can be used to explain chromosomal rearrangements. Synteny and collinearity have been widely studied in legumes (Fabaceae family), and these studies have shown direct correspondences between evolutionary distance and the degree of synteny and collinearity. These include whole chromosome levels of synteny between members of the closely related Viceae1,2 with successively more fractionated and rearranged chromosomal relationships moving out to the Loteae,3 Cicereae and Phaseoleae.4The Lupinus genus—part of the Genistoid clade of the Papilionoid legumes—includes a number of agricultural crop species, including Lupinus angustifolius L. (narrow-leafed lupin). The Genistoid clade is thought to be one of the first clades to diverge from the rest of the Papilionoid legumes about 56.4 million years ago and is quite distinct from the other clades containing crop or pasture species.5 The Lupinus genus therefore represents a useful out-group for understanding genome evolution within the legume family.Lupinus angustifolius is diploid (2n = 40 chromosomes) with a nuclear genome size of 2C = 1.89 pg.6 Cytogenetic and linkage analyses found evidence of ancient polyploidy in Lu. angustifolius,6–8 but it is functionally diploid. Alignment of a low-density genetic map of Lu. angustifolius to an early draft genome sequence of the model legume species Medicago truncatula revealed short regions of conserved synteny between these highly divergent legume species.7Genetic map resources for Lu. angustifolius are modest, comprising two incomplete maps,7,9 several gene-tagging reports10–14 and physical descriptions of the chromosomes by cytogenetic approaches.15,16 The purpose of this current study was to bring together marker data from previous mapping studies, add almost 200 new markers and develop a high-density consensus reference genetic map for Lu. angustifolius with all chromosomes richly populated with gene-based markers. We then used this map to compare the genome structure of Lu. angustifolius with the recently released genome sequence of the model legume, Lotus japonicus.17 By this approach, we hoped to gain further insight into the evolution of Papilionoid legumes by comparing the genomes of a Genistoid species and a Loteae species. We also sought to develop a resource for map alignment-based identification of candidate genes from Lo. japonicus for use in Lu. angustifolius genetic studies.2. Materials and methods2.1. Characteristics of the Lu. angustifolius mapping populationThe Lu. angustifolius recombinant inbred line (RIL) mapping population used in this study was developed at the Department of Agriculture and Food Western Australia (Perth, Australia) and comprised 106 RILs derived from a cross between a domesticated line (breeding line 83A:476) and a wild landrace from Morocco (P27255).7 These two crossing parents differed in six major genes for key domestication traits used in all current Australian cultivars: Ku (early flowering); iucundis (low seed alkaloid); tardus and lentus (pod shatter resistance); mollis (water permeable seed) and leucospermus (pigmented flowers, seeds and cotyledons, used as a visible marker to indicate when undesirable cross-pollination to wild types has occurred). Two previous mapping studies used subsets of this population: 89 RILs were used by Boersma et al.9 and 93 RILs were used by Nelson et al.7 These studies shared 76 RILs in common, which allowed the straightforward combining of data sets from these previous studies.2.2. Previously published markersGenotyping data for 522 microsatellite-anchored fragment length polymorphism (MFLP) loci and five domestication genes (Ku, iucundis, lentus, mollis and leucospermus) were previously reported by Boersma et al.9 The anthracnose resistance gene and linked marker (Lanr1 and AntjM2, respectively) were reported by Yang et al.18 and You et al.14 Genotyping at 298 mainly gene-based sequence tagged site (STS) loci, 74 amplified fragment length fragment (AFLP) loci and five domestication genes (Ku, iucundis, lentus, mollis and leucospermus) was reported in Nelson et al.7 A sixth domestication gene (Tardus), along with three linked markers (TaM1, TaM2 and TaM3), was reported by Boersma et al.10 Four further markers tagging domestication traits (MoA, LeM1, LeM2 and KuHM1) were reported by Boersma et al.11–13 Six isozyme markers were used to screen the population using the methods of Wolko and Weeden.8,192.3. New PCR-based STS markersForty-two STS primer pairs were developed within the framework of the 6th EU FP Grain Legumes Integrated Project (GLIP) and were provided by the Laboratory of Plant Genetics and Breeding at the Agricultural Biotechnology Center, Godollo, Hungary. The primer pairs were designed on the basis of information on M. truncatula and Pisum sativum consensus sequences using an intron-targeted strategy to amplify single or low copy genes. The primer information is available on the following website: http://bioweb.abc.hu/cgi-mt/pisprim/pisprim.pl.Nineteen previously unmapped Lupinus-derived STS primer pairs based on polymorphism screening conducted in previous comparative mapping studies were used to genotype the RIL population.1,2,7Two cross-legume primer pairs (PPE and SGR) were provided by Prof. Norman Weeden (Department of Plant Sciences and Plant Pathology at Montana State University, Bozeman, MT, USA). The design strategy was similar to that used for the GLIP marker generation (N. Weeden, pers. comm.).One BAC-end sequence tag (BEST) marker was developed from the clone 15L10 from the BAC library of Lu. angustifolius reported by Kasprzak et al.20 BAC DNA was isolated by QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen, Doncaster, VIC, Australia) and the insert ends were sequenced by BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Scoresby, VIC, Australia) using an AB PRISM 3130xl Genetic Analyzer. On the basis of the BAC-end sequence, primer pairs were designed with aid of Primer3 software (http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/primer3).An improved dCAPS assay (d212Len) was developed to replace the CAPS marker 212Len reported by Nelson et al.7STS primer pairs from the above sources were screened on Lu. angustifolius parental DNA. Primer pairs showing large length polymorphisms were used directly to genotype the RIL population. Amplicons of primer pairs showing no visible length polymorphisms were purified and directly sequenced. DNA polymorphisms were identified by manual inspection of alignments and chromatograms and suitable SNaPshot (AB), CAPS (cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence) or dCAPS (derived-CAPS) assays were developed to genotype the RIL population.2.4. New MFLP markersAn additional 134 MFLP markers were developed using the approach described by Boersma et al.9 Briefly, DNA from each RIL was digested by the restriction enzyme Tru91 (Roche Diagnostics Australia Pty Ltd, Kew, Australia), an isoschizomer of MseI. An AFLP MseI-adaptor21 was ligated to the restriction fragments using T4 DNA-ligase (Roche). The DNA was then digested a second time with HpaII (Gene Works Pty Ltd, Australia) as described by Yang et al.22 Pre-selective amplification of fragments using the simple sequence repeat primers listed in Supplementary Table S1 in combination with an MseI primer with one selective nucleotide C was followed by a second round of amplification using 16 MseI primers having two additional selective nucleotides (Supplementary Table S1). The PCR products were resolved on 5% denaturing sequencing gels and polymorphisms visualized by autoradiography.222.5. Linkage map constructionLinkage mapping was conducted with the aid of MultiPoint 1.2 (MultiQTL Ltd, Haifa, Israel), a mapping software package that used the ‘evolutionary optimization strategy’23 to resolve locus order. Of the 1118 marker and trait loci inputted to MultiPoint 1.2, 16 marker loci showed severe segregation distortion (<U+03C7>2P < 0.001). These were excluded from further analyses due to their tendency to introduce false linkages into the analysis. Because a large number of loci were included in this analysis, moderately distorted loci (0.001 < P < 0.01) were retained but kept under observation in the event that they became implicated in false linkages at a later stage.Initial clustering into linkage groups was performed at a maximum observable recombination frequency (rf) of 0.10. Multipoint marker ordering was performed separately for each linkage group, and the robustness of marker order was assessed using jack-knife re-sampling. Markers ordered with jack-knife values >90% were considered highly robust and designated as ‘framework’ markers. Markers ordered with jack-knife values <90% (including redundant markers that mapped to the same location) were initially excluded from the map construction due to their destabilizing effect on locus order. The same set of procedures was carried out serially at gradually increasing maximum recombination frequencies (rf = 0.15, 0.20, 0.25, 0.28, 0.30 and 0.31). At each new clustering cycle, manual inspection of proposed new clusters assisted the identification of valid and invalid clusters. A new cluster was considered valid if its two progenitor clusters were most closely related to each other via their terminal loci. A new cluster was considered invalid if its two progenitor clusters were most closely related by non-terminal loci. Such invalid clusters were associated with problematic loci that showed either high degree of missing data points and/or moderately severe segregation distortion (0.001 < P < 0.01) of alleles towards one of the two founding parents of the population. Only clusters judged valid were permitted during linkage mapping.Once the framework map construction was completed, the interval sizes were transformed to account for multiple meioses involved in the development of the RIL population and were expressed in Kosambi centiMorgans (cM). Markers that had earlier been removed from the map due to their destabilizing effect on locus order (i.e. those with jack-knife values <90%) were assigned to the most likely intervals on the framework map and were referred to as ‘attached’ markers.2.6. Comparison of Lu. angustifolius and Lo. japonicus genomesThe Lo. japonicus genome sequence version 4 was used to generate pseudomolecules representing the six chromosomes of Lo. japonicus. The pseudomolecules were assembled based on the Kazusa clone lists (http://www.kazusa.or.jp/lotus/clonelist.html) using custom Perl scripts (http://www.perl.org/). Comparison of the genetic map of Lu. angustifolius and the genome sequence of Lo. japonicus was achieved via blastall BLASTn homology search24,25 (at expected alignment values of 1e-20) and visualized using CMAP hosted at LegumeDB26 and GridMap 3.0 as described by Nelson and Lydiate.273. Results and discussion3.1. A new reference map for Lu. angustifoliusThe new genetic map of Lu. angustifolius comprised 1090 loci arranged in 20 linkage groups and 3 small clusters (Fig. 1; larger scale diagrams are provided in Supplementary Fig. S1). The genotype data and map positions are provided in Supplementary Table S2. The total length of the map was 2361.8 cM, with linkage groups ranging from 69.7 to 168.1 cM. Table 1 gives summary details of each linkage group, including their size, the number of framework and total markers, and the equivalent linkage groups from the two previous maps of Lu. angustifolius reported by Boersma et al.9 and Nelson et al.7 These two previous studies lacked both the critical marker density and sophisticated mapping methodology of the current mapping study, which led to significant differences between the maps. Boersma et al.9 reported 21 linkage groups; comparison with the new map revealed that two pairs of the Boersma et al.9 linkage groups (LG13 and LG21, and LG17 and LG20) coalesced into two linkage groups in this new map (NLL-08 and NLL-10, respectively) (Table 1). One linkage group (NLL-12) in the new map was entirely absent from the Boersma et al.9 map. The Nelson et al.7 map had 20 linkage groups (the same number as the current map); comparison with the new map revealed that five linkage groups of Nelson et al.7 (LG07, LG19, LG05, LG14 and LG20) were illegitimately joined and were divided among 10 of the new linkage groups (Table 1).Linkage map of the Lu. angustifolius genome comprising 1090 loci distributed among 20 linkage groups (NLL-01 to NLL-20) and three small clusters (Cluster-1 to Cluster-3).

Total loci includes both framework and attached loci (see text for details).Summary of linkage groups and small clusters for Lu. angustifolius (narrow-leafed lupin) in this study (NLL-01 to NLL-20 and Cluster-1 to Cluster-3, respectively) and the equivalent linkage groups (LG) in two previous mapsaFramework markers were used to form the linkage groups. Total loci includes both framework and attached loci (see text for details).This newly constructed genetic map of Lu. angustifolius involved a significantly greater number of markers and a more sophisticated mapping approach (the evolutionary optimization strategy) compared with the two previous maps. Jack-knife re-sampling was highly effective in identifying framework markers that were used to construct stable linkage groups onto which lower quality (and redundant) markers were later attached. This approach is particularly helpful in studies where marker data have been pooled from several sources since the quality of marker genotyping is likely to vary due to differing genotyping technologies and/or technical expertise. These factors led to a greatly improved map with the number of linkage groups equalling the haploid number for this species (n = 20).This map cannot yet be considered saturated with markers since 18 intervals exceed 15 cM and 1 interval exceeds 20 cM (Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. S1). However, the marker density is ample for most mapping purposes. Eighteen markers showing significant (P < 0.01) segregation distortion were distributed across nine linkage groups, with the majority (14) being dominant MFLP markers. Therefore, these distorted loci are more likely to have arisen from marker genotyping errors than being an indication of imbalance in the RIL mapping population. The population of RILs used to construct this map is available to the research community on request. With these resources, this map can be considered the new reference genetic map for Lu. angustifolius.3.2. Comparing the genomes of Lu. angustifolius and Lo. japonicusThe new genetic map of Lu. angustifolius was compared with the recently released genome sequence of the model legume Lo. japonicus.17 This was achieved by comparing the DNA sequences of 311 STS markers (representing 363 mapped loci in Lu. angustifolius) to the genome sequence of Lo. japonicus using BLASTn homology searching. At the significance threshold of P < 1e-20, 159 markers (detecting 187 Lu. angustifolius loci) matched one or more locations in the Lo. japonicus genome. Seven markers (UWA023, UWA097, UWA158, UWA160, UWA270, UWA300 and LSSR18) representing 16 mapped loci in Lu. angustifolius detected repetitive sequences in the Lo. japonicus genome and were removed from further analysis. The remaining 152 markers (representing 171 mapped loci in Lu. angustifolius) detected one or more correspondences in the Lo. japonicus genome. In total, there were 242 correspondences between the two genomes, and these are plotted graphically in Fig. 2 and summarized in Table 2.Global distribution of synteny between 20 linkage groups of Lu. angustifolius (NLL-01 to NLL-20) and 6 chromosomes of Lo. japonicus (Lj1–Lj6). Loci showing homology between the two genomes at P < 1e-20 significance threshold are indicated by dots.Global distribution of synteny between 20 linkage groups of Lu. angustifolius (NLL-01 to NLL-20) and 6 chromosomes of Lo. japonicus (Lj1–Lj6).

There were clear differences in the degree of conserved collinearity on Lu. angustifolius and Lo. japonicus chromosomes with some regions showing good conservation whereas other regions were highly rearranged with respect to each other (Fig. 2). This heterogeneous pattern of genome collinearity was also observed in an earlier genome comparison between Lu. angustifolius (a Genistoid species) and M. truncatula (a Galegoid species),7 and provides additional support to the wide evolutionary distance believed to separate the Galegoids and Genistoids.5 A similarly heterogeneous pattern was observed between Arachis hypogea (groundnut, in the Dalbergioid clade, which is also considered relatively basal in the evolution of Papilionoid legumes) and the Galegoid species Lo. japonicus and M. truncatula.28 It is interesting to note that arguably the best conserved section between the Arachis and Lo. japonicus genomes on chromosomes Ar6 and Lj1 (synteny block 5, delineated by contigs CM0222–CM0105), respectively, appears to shows no conservation in the Lu. angustifolius genome. A more thorough analysis will be required to make firm conclusions, but on first inspection it would appear that regions of conserved gene order may not be generalized across wide evolutionary distance within the Papilionoid legumes. This is in contrast to the crucifer family where large variations in chromosome numbers and frequent rearrangements exist, but where the integrity of many chromosomal blocks has been maintained over a similarly long evolutionary timeframe.29Three regions showing relatively good conservation of locus order between Lu. angustifolius and Lo. japonicus are shown in Fig. 3. Even these relatively well-conserved regions show evidence of chromosome translocations and/or inversions, which will make exploitation of synteny by lupin researchers more difficult. One of the potential applications of synteny is map alignment-based identification of candidate genes for important traits in the crop species by searching for likely candidates in the equivalent region of the model genome. For example, the pod shatter resistance gene lentus is located on Lu. angustifolius linkage group NLL-08 in a region with relatively well-conserved gene order with Lo. japonicus chromosome 5 (Fig. 3). Unfortunately, there appears to be an inversion in the interval containing lentus such that the equivalent region of Lo. japonicus is somewhat ambiguous and is only delimited to the lower half of chromosome 5. Clearly, more bridging points will be required to make such map-based inferences in Lu. angustifolius using Lo. japonicus as a model genome and therefore more gene-based markers are required in Lu. angustifolius.Three Lu. angustifolius linkage groups (NLL-08, NLL-06 and NLL-12) showing conserved gene order with Lo. japonicus chromosomes Lj2, Lj3, Lj4 and Lj5.

We discovered that the Lu. angustifolius genome has numerous chromosomal rearrangements relative to the Lo. japonicus genome, though widespread but small sections of conserved gene order are present. As an outlying species compared with other legume model and crop species, Lu. angustifolius serves as a useful reference for gaining better understanding of legume genome evolution.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingGeneration of the GLIP STS markers was supported by the EU 6th Framework Programme Grain Legumes Integrated Project, no.

IntroductionCyanobacteria are prokaryotes that perform oxygenic photosynthesis and constitute a large taxonomic group within the domain of eubacteria. Cyanobacteria are divided morphologically (unicellular or filamentous) or functionally (N2-fixing and non-N2-fixing). Filamentous species are subdivided into those with and without a heterocyst which is a differentiation from vegetative cells for fixing nitrogen.1,2Arthrospira is a representative filamentous non-N2-fixing cyanobacterium that lacks any differentiation such as for the heterocyst, akinete or hormogonium, which develops in some filamentous N2-fixing cyanobacteria. This cyanobacterium is also well known as ‘Spirulina’ because of its useful property as a food. The Aztecs consumed it regularly,3 and it is thought to be an important dietary element in tropical areas. Recently, Lake Chad has been famous for Arthrospira that is naturally cultivated as a food supply.4 However, current taxonomy claims that the name ‘Spirulina’ for strains used as food supplements is inappropriate, and there is agreement that Arthrospira is a distinct genus,5 consisting of over 30 different species including A. platensis and A. maxima. In the present study, we determined nearly the complete genome sequence of A. platensis NIES-39.6Arthrospira platensis has physiologically particular diagnostic characteristics, and its biology is subject to a comprehensive book.7Arthrospira platensis shows vigorous gliding motility of filamentous cells (trichomes) with rotation along their long axis. Gliding is a self-propulsion across a solid or semi-solid material without the aid of any visible flagellum8; however, the mechanism of gliding motility is not fully understood. This organism also possesses ecologically very valuable characteristics such as alkali and salt tolerance and algal mat production on the periphery of lakes. Arthrospira platensis is also able to grow under high salt concentrations of ~1.5-fold higher than sea water.9 Accordingly, it often dominates in lakes with high carbonate/bicarbonate levels and high pH levels.10Gene expression during adaptation to new environmental conditions like a high salt concentration has been determined in A. platensis, and the importance of the cAMP signalling cascade in its regulatory mechanism in response to changes in the external environment has been highlighted.11 Moreover, molecular analysis of adenylate cyclase genes has shown that A. platensis develops a number of diverse cAMP-dependent signal cascades to adapt to different severe environmental conditions.12–14Arthrospira platensis has become an important industrial organic material as a health supplement, a source of beta-carotene and a natural colouring agent. It has been approved for treating symptoms of radiation sickness after the Chernobyl disaster in Russia.15 The presence of hydrogenase in its cells also makes this cyanobacterium a useful material for clean energy production.16Despite its various useful applications, very little is known about the biology, physiology and genetic system of A. platensis. For production of useful products, gene manipulation through genetic engineering should be considered. However, genetic transformation of Arthrospira has had limited success to date,17 and thus commercial use of this organism has faced barriers due to difficulties in gene manipulation. To overcome these barriers, restriction-modification (RM) systems based on its genome sequence may prove useful.In 1996, whole-genome sequencing was achieved for the first time in the unicellular cyanobacterium, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803.18 Since then, whole genomes of 38 strains of cyanobacteria have been sequenced (Table 1). Of these strains, four are N2-fixing filamentous species, whereas the others are unicellular species, both N2-fixing and non-N2 fixing. Thus, this is the first study to sequence the genome of a filamentous non-N2-fixing species. Strains used in the comparative genomic analysisAbbr., abbreviation; nd, not determined.

Pfam domains: HisKA (PF00512), Respons_reg (PF00072), PAS (PF00989) and GAF(PF01590).This study determined the nearly complete genome sequence of A. platensis NIES-39 of ~6.8 Mb. Some characteristic gene sets particularly in signal transduction and gene RM systems were determined, and additional properties in the genome structure were compared with those of other cyanobacteria.2. Materials and methods2.1. Bacterial strain and culture conditionsArthrospira (Spirulina) platensis strain NIES-39 was obtained from the culture collection at the National Institute for Environmental Studies, which was originally isolated from Lake Chad and maintained in the Institute of Applied Microbiology, the University of Tokyo (strain IAM M-135).6 The cells were grown in the SOT medium19 at 30°C under continuous illumination at 30 µmol photon m-2 s-1 with aeration with 1% (v/v) CO2.2.2. Sequencing and assemblyGenomic DNA was isolated with Genomic-tip 500/G (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) as recommended by the supplier. A DNA shotgun library with 1.5- and 5-kb inserts in pUC118 vector (Takara, Otsu, Japan) was constructed as described previously.20 Plasmid clones were end-sequenced using dye terminator chemistry on an ABI Prism 3730 sequencer as described previously.20 Raw sequence data corresponding to 11-fold coverage were assembled using PHRED/PHRAP/CONSED software (http://www.phrap.org).21,22 For assembly validation, a fosmid library with 40-kb inserts in the pCC1FOS fosmid vector was constructed using the CopyControl Fosmid library production kit (Epicenter, Madison, WI, USA). Fosmid DNA was extracted from Escherichia coli transformants using a Montage BAC96 MiniPrep kit (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), and end sequencing was carried out using dye terminator chemistry on an ABI Prism 3730 as described previously.20 Fosmid end sequences were mapped onto the assembled sequence. Fosmid clones that link two contigs were selected and sequenced by primer walking to close any gaps. The sequencing of difficult templates was performed using a CUGA sequencing kit (Nippon Genetech, Tokyo, Japan). Contig sequences generated by Roche 454 FLX sequencer were also used to fill some gaps.2.3. Optical mappingThe sequence assemblies were constructed by optical maps (OpGen Technologies, Madison, WI, USA) and PCR.23,24 Briefly, high molecular weight DNA was immobilized as individual molecules onto optical chips, digested with NcoI (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA), fluorescently stained with YOYO-1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and positioned onto an automated fluorescent microscope system for image capture and fragment size measurement to give high-resolution single-molecule restriction maps. Single-molecule maps were collected and then assembled to produce whole genome.Optical maps and sequence contigs were compared as described previously.23 Sequence FASTA files were converted to in silico restriction maps via MapViewer software (OpGen Technologies) for direct comparison with the optical maps. Comparisons were accomplished by aligning the sequence with the optical maps according to their restriction fragment pattern. Alignments were generated with a dynamic programming algorithm that finds the optimal location or placement of a sequence contig by global alignment of the sequence contig against the optical map. Local alignment analysis was also performed to compare segments of the sequence contigs to the optical map.2.4. Genome analysis and annotationPutative non-translated genes were identified using the Rfam25 and tRNAscan-SE26 programs and rRNA genes using the RNAmmer27 and BLASTN28 programs, whereas protein-coding genes were identified using the GLIMMER program by obtaining potential open reading frames >150 bp.29,30 The genome sequence was translated into potential protein sequences in six frames and compared with sequences in the UniProt database31 using the BLASTP program28 for identification of additional genes not predicted by other methods and genes <150 bp, especially in the predicted intergenic regions. The start sites were manually inspected and altered based on predictions of GLIMMER and GeneHacker.32 For functional annotation, the non-redundant UniProt database and protein signature database, InterPro,33 were searched to assign the predicted protein sequences based on sequence similarities. Orthologous genes among cyanobacteria were manually curated using Gclust34 and CYORF.35 The KEGG database was used for pathway reconstruction.36 Signal peptides in proteins were predicted using SignalP,37 and transmembrane helices were predicted using TMHMM.382.5. Comparative genomic analysisWe first used the hmmer (v2.3.2) program and the Pfam_ls database (release 23) to analyse the cyanobacterial genomes (Table 1).For comparative genomic analysis to determine genes related to trichome formation and N2-fixation, we applied the CyanoClust database.39 We classified all putative proteins from the 39 cyanobacterial genomes into nearly orthologous protein clusters; each cluster was statistically defined to minimize its size. This is particularly useful for analysing the many regulatory proteins in cyanobacteria which have multidomains. We divided A. platensis and the other strains of cyanobacteria into six groups (Table 1): unicellular non-N2-fixing cyanobacteria such as Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (group I), unicellular N2-fixing cyanobacteria such as Crocosphaera watsonii (group II), Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 (a unicellular cyanobacterium which forms a short filament near optimal growth temperature; D. Bryant, personal communication) (group III), filamentous non-N2-fixing cyanobacteria (A. platensis, group IV), filamentous N2-fixing non-heterocyst-forming cyanobacteria (Trichodesmium erythraeum, group V) and filamentous N2-fixing heterocyst-forming cyanobacteria such as Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 (group VI). Gene clusters that were shared between groups were automatically extracted, and only those clusters present in all strains of the group were analysed.3. Results and discussion3.1. Sequencing, optical mapping and structural features of the A. platensis genomeThe nucleotide sequence of the whole genome of A. platensis NIES-39 was determined using the whole-genome shotgun method. Three different libraries with 1.5-, 5- and 40-kb inserts were prepared and each end sequence was determined. A total of 92 878 random sequences corresponding to 11 genome equivalents were assembled into 18 supercontigs. Final sequence assembly was carried out by visually editing the draft sequences and by optical mapping (data not shown) to determine the relative order/orientation of each supercontig. The 18 remaining gaps were estimated to be ~95 kb. Most, if not all, gaps were flanked by repeated clusters of tandem sequences or the phage-like sequences. Gap closing including long PCR followed by primer walking and transposon-mediated sequencing was not successful due to unusually abundant repeats. The total sequence of the 18 supercontigs has a length of 6 692 865 bp with an average G + C content of 44.3%. Taken together, the A. platensis genome is composed of a single, circular chromosome of 6.8 Mb (Fig. 1); no plasmid DNA sequences were detected. On GC skew analysis to locate the probable origin and terminator of DNA replication, no apparent shift of skew was detected as in other cyanobacteria.Schematic representation of the circular chromosome of A. platensis. A scale indicates the coordinates in megabase pairs. From outside to inside: circle 1, the gaps in the genome; circles 2 and 3, predicted protein-coding genes on the forward and reverse strands; circle 4, G+C content; circle 5, GC skew. Eighteen contig gaps (G01-G18) are numbered in the clockwise direction starting from the end of the longest contig. Functional categories were colour-coded according to the standard colours used by COGs. The genome sequence and annotation of A. platensis NIES-39 are available at GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ under accession no. AP011615.Schematic representation of the circular chromosome of A. platensis.

The genome sequence and annotation of A. platensis NIES-39 are available at GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ under accession no. AP011615.The estimated genome comprises 6630 potential protein-coding genes (average size, 835 bp), as well as 49 RNA genes consisting of 2 sets of rRNA genes, 40 tRNA genes representing 20 tRNA species, tmRNA, the B subunit of RNase P and signal recognition particle RNA. Translated amino acid sequences were compared with sequences in the UniProt database using the BLAST program. Of the 6630 potential protein-coding genes, 5157 (78%) were orthologous or had similarity to genes of known function or hypothetical genes (E-value of <10-3) and the remaining 1473 (22%) showed no significant similarity to any registered genes. On manual curation, 2539 (38%) genes could be assigned to biological roles. Genes for general metabolism in cyanobacteria were detected with no particular difference.3.2. Comparative genomic analysisWe obtained 2673 kinds of Pfam domains from 37 cyanobacterial genomes and 1537 kinds of Pfam domains from the A. platensis genome. Table 2 presents the top 50 Pfam domains in A. platensis, which contains highly repetitive motifs including TPR_1 (PF00515), TPR_2 (PF07719), WD40 (PF00400), HemolysinCabind (PF00353), Pentapeptide (PF00805), HNH (PF01844) and GIIM (PF08388). Top 50 of Pfam domains of A. platensisSee Table 1 for abbreviations*Highest domain numbers in A. platensisTop 50 of Pfam domains of A. platensisSee Table 1 for abbreviations*Highest domain numbers in A. platensisPositive correlation was detected between the number of genes and number of Pfam domains of the 38 cyanobacterial species (r = 0.9X, P < 0.05), including A. platensis (Supplementary Fig. S1). Eighteen domains (DUF1064, BOF, Cytochrom_C_2, DUF1624, DUF1667, DUF2234, DUF2273, DUF268, DUF310, DUF579, Hp0062, JmjC, LAB_N, PhoU_div, PMSR, PPTA, SoxG and YibE_F) are unique to the A. platensis genome. The abundance of signalling domains, such as GAF (guanylate cyclase/adenylate cyclase/FhlA), PAS (Per/Arnt/Sim), HisKA and Respons_reg, depends on the habitat of the cyanobacteria; i.e. soil and freshwater cyanobacteria possess larger numbers of signalling domains than marine cyanobacteria (Supplementary Fig. S2). A. platensis, which lives in high salt lakes, was thus categorized as a soil/freshwater cyanobacterium.Arthrospira platensis is the first strain of filamentous non-N2-fixing cyanobacteria to have its genome sequenced. Whole-genome sequencing allows for comparative genomic analysis especially in regard to trichome formation and N2-fixation. Using the CyanoClust database, we extracted 694 gene clusters (938 genes in A. platensis) that were common to all six cyanobacteria groups (Table 3 and Supplementary Table S1). These clusters may be closely related to housekeeping, photosynthetic or cyanobacteria-specific genes. We also extracted 1066 gene clusters (2056 genes in A. platensis) that were specific to A. platensis (Table 3 and Supplementary Table S2); 71 (94 genes in A. platensis) common to only groups IV (A. platensis) and V (T. erythraeum) (Supplementary Table S3); and 223 common to the heterocyst-forming cyanobacteria. The latter clusters included known heterocyst-related genes such as patN and hetP (Table 3 and Supplementary Table S4). In addition, eight clusters were specifically conserved among N2-fixing cyanobacteria (groups II, V and VI) (Table 3 and Supplementary Table S5); most of these encode nif-related genes. Summary of comparative genomic analysis using CyanoClustFor cyanobacteria grouping, see Table 1.Summary of comparative genomic analysis using CyanoClustFor cyanobacteria grouping, see Table 1.Of the 29 gene clusters (31 genes in A. platensis, Table 4 and Supplementary Table S6) common to only filamentous cyanobacteria (groups IV, V and VI), fraC and fraG (sepJ) are already known to have an association with trichome formation.40,41 Notably, seven gene clusters (seven genes in A. platensis, Table 4 and Supplementary Table S7) were found to be common to the filamentous groups and Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002, which may be a primitive filamentous species (group III) and may also be related to trichome formation. Moreover, several genes (patU, hetR and hetF)42–44 that are required for heterocyst maturation and N2 fixation are conserved in A. platensis, although no nitrogenase genes were detected; this suggests that heterocyst formation could be developmentally coupled with trichome formation. Several contiguous genes (bolded in Table 4) are syntenically conserved among the five trichome-forming cyanobacteria. Particularly, NIES39_A00790 is located just downstream of fraC, implying that it is another candidate required for trichome development. Gene clusters conserved only in filamentous cyanobacteriaBolded genes are contiguous.Gene clusters conserved only in filamentous cyanobacteriaBolded genes are contiguous.3.3. Mobile DNA elementsGroup II introns include ribozymes and retroelements in the genomes of organelles, Eubacteria and Archaea. In bacteria, group II introns primarily act as retroelements consisting of six RNA structural domains (DI–DVI) and an intron-encoded protein, whereas in mitochondria and plastids, they frequently lack the intron-encoded protein and are mobile. At least 150 group II introns were identified in the A. platensis genome; 71 of these encode reverse transcriptase/maturase, whereas the other 79 do not. Additionally, 88 sequences were assigned to the group II catalytic intron (RF00029), DV and DVI. This number was much higher than that in previously reported abundant species (27 copies of group II introns in T. elongatus45 and 28 copies of RF00029 in T. erythraeum). These results suggested that group II introns have been self-propagating extensively in A. platensis cells for a long time.Group I introns include ribozymes that catalyse their own RNA splicing to produce ligated exons (mature RNA) and the excised intron. We detected two group I introns in one gene comprising three ORFs (NIES39_L05970, NIES39_L05980 and NIES39_L05990) which encode class I ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs; Fig. 2). Notably, a stop codon was found just after the insertion position in each intron, indicative of translational regulation. It is extremely rare for a group I intron to be inserted in protein-coding genes in bacteria, although one report has detected this insertion in class II RNR of the cyanobacterium N. punctiforme.46 At least three different classes of RNRs that differ in primary sequence, substrate and cofactor requirements have been described in cyanobacteria. Since class I RNRs have no homology with class II RNRs, the essential DNA biosynthesis step from RNA could be an evolutionary hot spot for targeting these selfish genes. Cyanobacterial genome comparison revealed that classes I and II are distributed complementally in cyanobacteria, except for Gloeobacter violaceus in which no known RNR genes have been detected (Supplementary Table S8), whereas class III anaerobic RNRs are also present in some species. Many class I and II RNR genes are interrupted by introns and/or inteins which are spliced out for sequencing of RNA or protein. Inteins in A. platensis were also found in DnaB (NIES39_M02320), DnaX (NIES39_D01990) and thymidylate synthase (NIES39_Q01490) genes.Gene structure of the ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) gene with two group I intron insertions.Gene structure of the ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) gene with two group I intron insertions.Novel phage-like sequences spanning from 12.5 to 25.5 kb were found in at least 18 loci in the A. platensis genome. Although there are a number of variations in deletion, insertion and rearrangement in each sequence, they consist of phage infection-related genes (e.g. NIES39_F00750) and small conserved putative genes, generating a direct repeat in some case. Such phage-like sequences contribute to at least 295 kb in the whole genome. As for transposases of the insertion sequence, 139 genes were found, which is comparable to other cyanobacteria.18 A total 612 kb of the genome are composed of group II introns, phage-like sequences, insertion sequences and some repetitive elements, which include clustered regulatory interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) sequences (see Section 3.5.2).3.4. Signal transduction proteinscAMP is an important signalling molecule in cyanobacteria.47A. platensis genome encodes 22 adenylate cyclases that produce cAMP from ATP (Fig. 3). This number is quite prominent among cyanobacterial genomes, which usually encode less than 10 adenylate cyclases. Even T. erythraeum, the most closely related cyanobacterium to A. platensis, contains only 13 adenylate cyclase genes. In addition to the genes cyaC,13,14cyaG,13,14cyaA, cyaB1, cyaB2 and cyaD homologues (Fig. 3),48 many novel genes were detected. Another unique characteristic of A. platensis is its 10 membrane-associated adenylate cyclases, compared with most cyanobacteria which have only one or two. Thus, the cAMP signal transduction response to external stimuli may be highly developed in A. platensis. As for the domain structure of adenylate cyclase, NIES39_A07100 bears a unique domain architecture: a Ser/Thr protein kinase domain in the N-terminus and GAF, PAS and adenylate cyclase domains in the C-terminus (Fig. 3). This domain architecture is quite similar to that of the HstK family,49 a hybrid of Ser/Thr protein kinase and histidine kinase, except that the C-terminal histidine kinase domain is replaced with the adenylate cyclase domain.Domain architecture of adenylate cyclases in A. platensis. See Table 1 for abbreviations.Domain architecture of adenylate cyclases in A. platensis. See Table 1 for abbreviations.The A. platensis genome also contains 14 genes encoding cNMP-binding domains. Four of them [NIES39_C02730 (NtcA), NIES39_D00910 (CRP), NIES39_M01440 and NIES39_O00090] encode the helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif of the CRP family, whereas the remaining encode unique domain architecture proteins. NIES39_A00950 bears a unique domain architecture, namely, an ATP:ADP antiporter-like domain in the N-terminus and a cNMP-binding domain in the C-terminus. The C-terminal cNMP-binding domain contains residues critical for binding cAMP. A previous report showed that A. platensis trichomes rapidly aggregate to form a mat in response to externally added cAMP.50 This aggregation is accompanied with an increase in the intracellular ATP level and a decrease in the intracellular ADP level,12 suggesting that NIES39_A00950 may contribute to this cAMP-dependent aggregation.There are 33 GGDEF and 15 EAL domains, respectively, involved in the synthesis and hydrolysis of c-di-GMP,51 a widely distributed second messenger for biofilm formation in bacteria. One GGDEF (NIES39_C01090) and three GGDEF/EAL (NIES39_C03530, NIES39_L00190 and NIES39_Q02220) proteins contain putative flavin-binding PAS domains, suggestive of light- or redox-responsive c-di-GMP signalling for movement, aggregation or biofilm formation.Two-component signal transduction systems canonically consist of two proteins, a histidine kinase and a response regulator.52 There are 84 putative genes for histidine kinases in the A. platensis genome. Among them, 33 encode hybrid histidine kinases containing not only a transmitter domain but also single or multiple receiver domain(s) or histidine phospho-transfer domain(s), which accept the phosphate group via intramolecular and/or intermolecular phospho-transfer. There are also 65 putative genes for response regulators.Orthologous histidine kinases of Synechocystis, Hik2 (slr1147), Hik7 (SphS, sll0337), Hik8 (sasA, sll0750), Hik33 (sll0698) and Hik34 (slr1285), are conserved in almost all cyanobacterial genomes. The A. platensis genome contains orthologues of Hik2 (NIES39_J01640), Hik8 (NIES39_A03740), Hik33 (NIES39_M02760) and Hik34 (NIES39_J00420), but not SphS, a kinase that induces proteins to acquire inorganic phosphate (Pi) under Pi-deficient conditions. Although some marine cyanobacteria have been found to lack apparent orthologues of SphS, A. platensis is the first example among freshwater cyanobacteria. Accordingly, it does not contain a gene for SphU which regulates SphS.53 However, the response regulator SphR and its target genes phoA (alkaline phosphatase) and pts (high affinity Pi transporter) are present in the A. platensis genome, suggesting a different regulation system in this cyanobacterium.Some histidine kinases in A. platensis contain multiple domains of PAS/PAC and/or GAF. These structures are also prevalent in other histidine kinases from filamentous cyanobacteria, such as Anabaena sp. PCC 712054 and N. punctiforme.55 Like in other cyanobacterial genomes, most genes for histidine kinases and response regulators in the A. platensis genome are not collocated to each other on the chromosomes, except for the 18 cases (Supplementary Table S9). Several genes encode fragments of histidine kinases in the A. platensis genome suggestive of pseudogenes (NIES39_A02200–NIES39_A02210, NIES39_D02110–NIES39_D02130–NIES39_D02160, NIES39_L02740–NIES39_L02750, NIES39_L05670–NIES39_L05680–NIES39_L05690).Cyanobacteria have multiple s70-type sigma factors of RNA polymerase and no s54-type sigma factor. In the A. platensis genome, there are seven s70-type sigma factors. NIES39_L06110 encodes a group 1 sigma factor, which is also called the principal sigma factor and is essential for cell viability. In addition, three group 2 sigma factors (NIES39_A03770, NIES39_A08720 and NIES39_C01040), which show a high degree of sequence similarity with the principal sigma factor but are non-essential for cell growth, and three group 3 sigma factors (NIES39_C05220, NIES39_D05870 and NIES39_O06410), which are divergent from group 1 and 2 sigma factors in amino acid sequence, are identified. The B-, C- and D-type group 2 sigma factors and the F- and G-type group 3 sigma factors are conserved among non-marine cyanobacteria,56,57 all of which are present in A. platensis. An additional group 3 sigma factor which does not form a clade with previously analysed sigma factors was also determined.In the A. platensis genome, there are 66 putative genes for transcriptional regulators. Compared with the genome size, this number is quite small for a non-marine cyanobacterium, being more comparable to marine cyanobacteria.58 For example, the freshwater cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. PCC 7120, having a comparable genome size to A. platensis, contains more than 100 transcriptional regulators.54 Some well-conserved transcriptional regulators among cyanobacteria were found in A. platensis, including genes for NtcA (NIES39_C02730),59 NtcB (NIES39_C02400),60 NdhR (NIES39_K02860),61 HrcA (NIES39_O04340)62 and CRP (NIES39_D00910).63 Two adjacent genes (NIES39_D06090 and NIES39_D06100) encode RbcR paralogues.64 Although A. platensis does not form a heterocyst, a gene for HetR (NIES39_C03480) has recently been found.65Arthrospira platensis contains 20 response regulators that have a so-called receiver domain at the N-terminus and the helix-turn-helix type DNA-binding domain at the C-terminus. Of these regulators, 16 are classified in the OmpR family whereas the remaining belong to the LuxR family. Orthologous proteins of NrrA (NIES39_A06330),66 ManR (NIES39_G00800),67,68 RpaA (NIES39_H00910),69 SphR (NIES39_J04020),70 RpaB (NIES39_K03840)69 and NblR (NIES39_O05300)69 were also identified.Most non-marine cyanobacteria contain a large number of PAS and GAF domains.54 The PAS and GAF domains are important signalling molecules that serve as specific sensors for light, redox, oxygen and many other signals or a structural element for dimerization.71,72 We detected 131 PAS domains using a custom HMM profile of Anabaena and Nostoc PAS domains.73 This number is almost comparable to those of other freshwater and soil cyanobacteria such as Anabaena and Nostoc. Six PAS domains encoded by NIES39_C01090, NIES39_C03530, NIES39_M00920, NIES39_L00190, NIES39_M02160 and NIES39_Q02220 are predicted to bind a flavin; the first three retain the conserved Cys residue that is essential for the photocycle of the LOV-type photoreceptors. One PAS domain encoded by NIES39_A03380 is predicted to bind a heme.The A. platensis genome contains 58 GAF domains. Four GAF domains encoded by NIES39_M01980 (CyaB1) and NIES39_O00080 (CyaB2) are predicted to bind cAMP,74 whereas 18 are categorized into the phytochrome-type or cyanobacteriochrome-type GAF domain subfamilies that bind linear tetrapyrrole and exhibit reversible photoconversion.75 We found no Cph1 and AphA orthologues, which are cyanobacterial phytochromes, although bacteriophytochrome-type AphB (NIES39_A02210) and AphC (NIES39_C03450) orthologues are detected.76 In addition, there are two green/red reversible AnPixJ-type (NIES39_J03990_GAF2 and NIES39_C00690_GAF1)77 and six blue/green reversible TePixJ-type (NIES39_K04670_GAF1, NIES39_E01230_GAF1, NIES39_L03820_GAF1, NIES39_E04120_GAF3, NIES39_D04330_GAF1 and NIES39_M02490_GAF1) GAF domains.75,78In the A. platensis genome, there are eight methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs), which may serve as sensors for cell motility. In contrast with photoreceptor MCPs (e.g. PixJ) in many other cyanobacteria,79 any of Arthrospira MCPs does not harbour any photoreceptor domain. Three of these MCP genes are clustered with other chemotaxis-regulating che genes such as cheY, cheW and cheA (NIES39_A07840–NIES39_A07910, NIES39_E01010–NIES39_E01070 and NIES39_H00230– NIES39_H00290 gene clusters). Two che clusters (NIES39_A07840–NIES39_A07910 and NIES39_H00230–NIES39_H00290) lack the patA genes which are present in the che clusters of other cyanobacteria. These che clusters contain additional che genes (cheB, cheC and cheR in the NIES39_A07840–NIES39_A07910 gene cluster and cheB and cheR in the NIES39_H00230–NIES39_H00290 gene cluster), which have not been detected in che clusters of other cyanobacteria such as Synechocystis, whose motility and phototaxis regulation is well understood. CheR and CheB are known to methylate and demethylate the MCP, respectively, and thereby function as a kind of molecular memory for flagellar regulation in some proteobacteria such as E. coli.80 CheC is a phosphatase for the CheY response regulator.81 As MCPs of these clusters have no photosensory domains, these genes may function in chemotaxis. Molecular memory and a rapid turnover system of phosphorylation can facilitate highly sensitive chemotactic responses.There are 43 genes that encode Ser/Thr protein kinases in the A. platensis genome. As in other filamentous cyanobacteria such as Anabaena and Nostoc,54 HstK family (two), WD40-containing (nine) and TPR-containing (five) Ser/Thr kinases were detected.Fourteen genes encoding phospho-Ser, -Thr and -Tyr phosphatases were also identified in the A. platensis genome. Among them, nine belong to the PP2C family including NIES39_O07130 and NIES39_R00570 that have response regulator domains. Other members of this family include NIES39_A03470, NIES39_C00770, NIES39_J01920, NIES39_J03440, NIES39_K03740, NIES39_M01820 and NIES39_M02650 (PphA) which dephosphorylates the nitrogen regulator PII protein.82 In addition, two phospho-Tyr (NIES39_B01000 and NIES39_N00600) and three PP1/2A/2B-type (NIES39_D01240, NIES39_G01060 and NIES39_G01070) phosphatases were identified.3.5. Genome protectionWe detected three sets of type I RM systems (hsdMSR) in the A. platensis NIES-39 genome (Supplementary Table S10 and Supplementary Fig. S3) which are shared between a closely related strain reported by a Chinese group.83 Among them, two RM-specific genes (hsdS, NIES39_A06660 and NIES39_C00340) are mosaically conserved between the two strains (Fig. 4), whereas the full-length methylase and restriction genes hsdM and hsdR are highly conserved (>98%). HsdS protein is composed of two target recognition domains and the N-terminal, central and C-terminal regions. NIES39_A06660 is highly conserved with ABB51216 throughout the entire protein except for the second target recognition domain (Fig. 4A). NIES39_C00340 is highly conserved with ABB51239 at the N-terminal, central and C-terminal regions but not at the target recognition domains (Fig. 4B). These mosaically conserved HsdS proteins may be generated by one or two homologous recombinations through a mechanism similar to domain swapping of hsdS genes in other bacteria.84 This enables A. platensis to acquire the restriction system against a wider range of exogenous DNA elements, interfering with genetic transformation of A. platensis. On the other hand, another hsdS-like reading frame, which is interrupted by an inframe stop codon, is totally conserved between these two strains.Domain architecture of HsdS proteins. The target recognition domain roughly corresponds to Methylase_S (PF01420).Domain architecture of HsdS proteins. The target recognition domain roughly corresponds to Methylase_S (PF01420).NIES-39 harbours eight clusters of the type II RM systems, four of which are identical to those of the strain of the Chinese group,83 although three are frame shifted. The other four clusters are novel in NIES-39. On the basis of this information of the RM systems, genetic transformation in A. platensis requires further improvement.CRISPRs are widespread in the genomes of many bacteria and almost all archaea, and they confer resistance to phages together with a group of CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins.85–87 The A. platensis genome contains three regions of CRISPRs, which are located in close proximity to Cas proteins. CRISPR1 (at coordinates 2897603–2897927 and 2903170–2904079) is organized as 17 almost identical sequences of 35 nt interspaced by non-identical sequences of 34–43 nt. CRISPR2 (at coordinates 3587555–3589797) and CRISPR3 (at coordinates 5189874–5191453) are organized as 29 and 23 identical sequences of 36 and 35 nt interspaced by non-identical sequences of 37–49 and 32–41 nt, respectively. We also found 18 Cas genes. One of the three Cas1 proteins encoded by NIES39_F00150 is a fusion protein, having a C-terminal Cas1 domain and a reverse transcriptase domain similar to that of group II introns.3.6. Membrane transportersThe A. platensis genome contains ~180 genes encoding putative membrane transporters. NapA-type Na+/H+ antiporters (Nha3 in S. elongatus PCC 7942) are known to be involved in salt tolerance at alkaline pH in some cyanobacteria.88–90Arthrospira platensis possesses seven putative Na+/H+ antiporters, one of which (NIES39_C00590) is an orthologue of NapA and Nha3.Accumulation of bicarbonate in the cytoplasm is essential for photosynthesis under high pH conditions.91Arthrospira platensis possesses two sets of genes for CO2-uptake modulation, NDH-1 (NdhF3-D3-CupA-CupS for high affinity and NdhF4-D4-CupB for low affinity), which converts CO2 to bicarbonate in the cytoplasm (Supplementary Table S11). Genes sbtA and bicA encode the sodium-dependent bicarbonate transporter in A. platensis. Two closely related copies of bicA (NIES39_B00700, NIES39_B00710), which are tandemly arranged on the genome, were also found. There is only one operon for the ABC-type transporter for either nitrate (NrtA-B-C-D) or bicarbonate (CmpA-B-C-D).3.7. Photosynthesis-related genesAlmost all photosynthesis genes were detected in A. platensis (Supplementary Table S11). For photosystem II, the reaction centre D1 protein is encoded by at least three identical copies and one divergent copy of psbA. Additional variant genes include cytochrome c550-like (NIES39_J05860) and psb28-2 (NIES39_A01290). For photosystem I, all known genes including psaX were detected. Genes for cytochrome b6/f, ATP synthase, and NDH were detected as in other cyanobacteria. We detected two copies of cytochrome c6, but no typical electron carrier proteins in the thylakoid lumen such as plastocyanin and cytochrome cM.One set of single-copy genes involved in tetrapyrrole biosynthesis was identified in the A. platensis genome. Almost all genes involved in porphyrin biosynthesis were assigned. For siroheme and heme biosynthesis, uroporphyrinogen-III C-methyltransferase (NIES39_H00180) and two types of ferrochelatase (HemH: NIES39_K00630 and NIES39_M01510) were also identified. The latter encodes the so-called ferrochelatase-like protein possessing characteristic poly-His sequence at the C-terminus, which are also found in some cyanobacteria. For heme metabolism and subsequent phycobilin biosynthesis, heme oxygenase (HO: NIES39_Q00930), heme o synthase (NIES39_O03120), protoheme IX farnesyltransferase (NIES39_E02030) and biliverdin reductase (BvdR: NIES39_B00110) were assigned. For chlorophyll a biosynthesis, all genes were identified as single-copy genes. As in other cyanobacteria, isoforms catalyzing the same reaction, i.e. aerobic (HemF: NIES39_D01090) and anaerobic (HemN: NIES39_E03410) coproporphyrinogen III oxidase and light-dependent (Por: NIES39_R00680) and dark-operative (ChlL, ChlN and ChlB: NIES39_L05610, NIES39_L05630 and NIES39_L01300, respectively) protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase, were identified, whereas only the aerobic form of Mg-protoporphyrin IX monomethylester cyclase (AcsF/CrdI/CHL27: NIES39_B00770) was found. These isoforms were assumed to function in the adaption to different oxygen environments.All known cyanobacterial genes involved in carotenoid biosynthesis were found except for beta-carotene ketolase (CrtW or CrtO) in the A. platensis genome. However, 3-hydroxyechinenone, which is produced by ketolase, is reported to bind to an orange carotenoid protein (NIES39_N00720) to regulate energy dissipation from phycobilisome to photosystem II.92,93 Therefore, a yet unknown type of ketolase may be present in the genome.All known cyanobacterial genes involved in biosynthesis of glycerolipids, fatty acids, lipoic acid, vitamin E, lipopolysaccharides and polyhydroxyalkanoates were assigned. A gene for <U+03C9>-3 fatty acid desaturase (desB) was not found, which is consistent with the biochemical analysis of A. platensis.94The biosynthesis genes for cyanotoxins such as non-ribosomal peptide toxins (microcystins), ribosomal depsipeptide toxins (microviridins), alkaloid toxins (anatoxins and saxitoxins) and urea-derived toxins (cylindrospermopsin) were not present in the genome, which concurs with the long-time use of this organism as a food.A. platensis has eight genes for ß-type carboxysome, which converts the accumulated bicarbonate ion to CO2 for ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase. These genes are split into two operons (ccmK1-K2 and ccmK3-K4-L-M-N-O). Only one gene (ccmM) encodes carbonic anhydrase for conversion of bicarbonate to CO2.We also detected some enzymes which protect against reactive oxygen species, except for catalase. However, the A. platensis genome harbours many genes for thioredoxin peroxidase, peroxiredoxin and other putative peroxidases including five genes for bacterioferritin co-migratory proteins (NIES39_A03490, NIES39_E01510, NIES39_E02230, NIES39_L02380, NIES39_O06760).Genus Arthrospira possesses gas vesicles for buoyancy of its trichomes, which is in contrast with no gas vesicles in the morphologically similar genus Spirulina.95 Consequently, A. platensis has six gas vesicle genes (gvpA-C-N-J, gvpV and gvpW); GvpA is a structural protein to form the skeleton of the gas vesicle.3.8. Cell surface proteins and motilityConcerning the cell surface structure and extracellular proteins, 42 genes were found to encode putative extracellular proteins that contain 191 haemolysin-like Ca2+-binding domains in the A. platensis genome (Table 2). This number is much higher than that in many other cyanobacteria. Fifteen of these genes consist of merely haemolysin-like Ca2+-binding domains, whereas 14 possess an additional SBBP-like domain, which is often found in S-layer-related proteins (i.e. NIES39_B00690, NIES39_C00400, NIES39_D06770, NIES39_D06910, NIES39_D06930, NIES39_D06980, NIES39_D07000, NIES39_D07020, NIES39_Q00770, NIES39_Q00840, NIES39_Q02140, NIES39_Q02160, NIES39_Q02170 and NIES39_Q02190).96 NIES39_D06770 also possesses the CalX-beta domain which is present in the cytoplasmic domains of CalX Na+/Ca2+ exchangers to expel calcium from cells,97 and NIES39_Q02140, NIES39_Q02160, NIES39_Q02170 and NIES39_Q02190 possess both the PPC domain found at the C-terminus of secreted bacterial peptidases and the CalX-beta domain. Three other genes (NIES39_C03760, NIES39_F00640 and NIES39_J05690) also possess the PPC domain. Other genes possess domains for cadherin (NIES39_C05180), SCP (NIES39_D00540, NIES39_D06960 and NIES39_L04630), Lipase-GDSL (NIES39_E00490), pro-isomerase (NIES39_L02390) and Chlam-PMP (NIES39_L00320 and NIES39_M01680); NIES39_L00320 also possesses the CalX-beta domain. Although pathogenic haemolysins are well known in Enterobacteria,98,99 it is interesting that non-toxic A. platensis has a large number of genes that contain the haemolysin-like Ca2+-binding domain.The A. platensis genome has no genes coding siderophore to scavenge iron from the environment.The molecular mechanism for gliding motility has been poorly understood in cyanobacteria. The outer surface of gliding cyanobacteria in Oscillatoriaceae consists of a parallel, helically arranged protein array (S-layer).100,101 The S-layer protein, oscillin, required for gliding motility in Phormidium102 is conserved in A. platensis (NIES39_A01430, 42% identity). NIES39_A01430 consists of 19 haemolysin-like Ca2+-binding domains. This protein is also homologous to SwmA (27% identity) for swimming motility in unicellular Synechococcus sp. WH 8102.103,104Gliding motility of cyanobacteria is reported to be driven by a secretion of mucilage from the junctional pore complex (JPC).105 The JPC consists of a channel through the outer membrane and the peptidoglycan layer. Although the subunits of JPC have not been identified, comparative genomics analysis may reveal their genes.Type IV pili are involved in twitching motility in many bacteria79,106–108 and have recently been reported to function in gliding motility in N. punctiforme109 and twitching motility in unicellular Synechocystis.110A. platensis exhibits vigorous gliding motility and harbours type IV pilus-related genes (Supplementary Table S11), but shows no twitching motility, suggesting that this organism utilizes type IV pili as machinery for gliding motility like N. punctiforme.109 Typical pil genes for pili biogenesis are the pilMNOQ operon, pilB1T1C operon, pilD (prepilin leader peptidase) and three prepilin subunit genes (NIES39_C03030, NIES39_C00840 and NIES39_C00850). Additionally, A. platensis harbours the rather unusual pilT2-like (NIES39_A08210) and pilC-like (NIES39_A03250) genes. These copies may be involved in novel regulation of the type IV pili or type II secretion system, which has not yet been studied in cyanobacteria.3.9. MicroevolutionArthrospira platensis NIES-39 harbours many pseudogenes, whose coding regions fragmentally correspond to known genes or ORFs (Supplementary Table S12). Many of them are not just accidental mutants resulting from single mutations but are generated by at least two events, frameshift and/or nonsense mutations. An extreme case is the operon of nrsS/R/B/A, which is inactivated by at least 27 frameshift mutations and 13 nonsense mutations (Fig. 5). NrsS/R involve the two-component signal transduction system for nickel sensing and transcriptional regulation, whereas NrsB/A form a cation-efflux pump to remove heavy metals.111 The extensive degradation of its operon strongly suggests that A. platensis NIES-39 is in the process of microevolution to adapt to its specific location in Lake Chad.Selective mutations in the nrsS/R/B/A region.Selective mutations in the nrsS/R/B/A region.Rapid evolution is also noted in the hsdS gene which determines the RM specificity (see Section 3.5.1). Since many strains of A. platensis and A. maxima are the target of genome projects and economical applications, the microevolution of their genomes and diversity in phenotype are critical themes for post-genome studies.Supplementary materialSupplementary Material is available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.We thank Ms Miho Furumichi and Professor Minoru Kanehisa (KEGG) for kindly providing the CYORF data.

IntroductionTo elucidate functional relationships between genes, coexpression analysis has proven to be a powerful approach. From a practical point of view, coexpression analysis requires two technical bases. The first is transcriptome data. Several model organisms, including Escherichia coli, yeast, and Arabidopsis, have been regarded as excellent targets for coexpression analysis, since a large amount of microarray data are publicly available. The second technical basis is the development of analytical methods. Generally, once coexpression measures between genes (e.g. correlation coefficients) have been estimated, subsequent coexpression analysis steps include visualization of the coexpression relationships, identification of densely correlated gene groups, and interpretation of biological relevance.1 Among several possible visualization methods, network representation provides an efficient way to depict complex relationships between many genes. To identify densely correlated gene groups, several algorithms have been developed based on connectivity of the network.2–4 For biologically relevant interpretation, data from other types of ‘omics’ analyses (e.g. metabolomics and interactomics) often help greatly. With these analytical methods, coexpression analysis at last allows the function of an unknown gene to be inferred.Excellent technical bases for coexpression analysis have been established for the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. To accumulate transcriptome data, various data repositories are now available, including NASCArrays,5 GEO,6 SMD,7 ArrayExpress,8 and AtGenExpress,9–11 which collectively provide more than 4753 microarray data points (3 September 2009). The results of coexpression analysis using this huge data set were combined with comprehensive gene annotations and data from metabolomics analysis, and then functions of several unknown genes associated with glucosinolate and flavonoid biosynthesis were elucidated.12–14 In parallel with the elucidation of function of individual genes, the genome-wide coexpression profile was also investigated and the results are available in databases such as ATTED-II,15 GENEVESTIGATOR,16 and BAR.17Recently, several attempts have been made for large-scale gene expression analysis of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). For example, the gene expression profile during fruit development was investigated in detail using a tomato microarray.18,19 Another example is the investigation of tissue-dependent gene expression. In fruit peel, coordinated expression of genes associated with metabolism of cuticular components, metabolism of hormones, and metabolism of cell wall components was demonstrated by hierarchical clustering analysis.20 Hierarchical clustering of gene expression patterns also demonstrated that acquisition of the fleshy fruit trait depends on tight regulation of gene expression.21 These studies suggest that large-scale coexpression analysis can shed light on the molecular mechanisms that control fruit development. However, these studies focused on few specific biological processes, and comprehensive identification of groups of highly correlated genes has not been reported.In this study, we report on the comprehensive identification of groups of highly correlated genes, or coexpression modules, in tomato. We performed a gene-to-gene coexpression analysis using a network-based approach. We evaluated developmental changes in gene expression profiles in various tissues of tomato plants using an Affymetrix GeneChip Tomato Genome Array. Using gene expression data from 67 hybridizations, gene-to-gene Pearson's correlation coefficients (PCCs) were estimated, and then 199 coexpression modules associated with various biological processes were identified based on an analysis of network topology. Gene ontology (GO) annotation analysis revealed enrichment of genes belonging to common functional categories in 75 modules. We then experimentally verified the coordinated expression of module member genes using tomato plants overexpressing a non-enzymatic module member gene that is a strong candidate for a regulatory gene in flavonoid biosynthesis. This result demonstrates the facilitation by coexpression analysis of the identification of the function of uncharacterized tomato genes.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materialsMiniature tomato, S. lycopersicum cultivar Micro-Tom, was grown as described previously.22 Roots were harvested 5 weeks after germination. Hypocotyl and cotyledon were harvested 3 weeks after germination. Third leaves were harvested 3 weeks after germination. All leaves of tomato plants were harvested 3 and 5 weeks after germination. Fruits were harvested at four developmental stages: mature green (MG, ~30 days after anthesis), yellow (Y, ~35 days after anthesis), orange (O, ~38–40 days after anthesis), and red (R, ~45–48 days after anthesis). S. lycopersicum cultivar Momotaro 8® (Takii & Co., Ltd, Kyoto, Japan) was grown in a greenhouse under natural photoperiod conditions from March to July 2006 in Chiba Prefecture. S. lycopersicum line 27859 was grown under field conditions from March to July 2006 in Gunma Prefecture. Monogenic mutant tomato, Anthocyanin fruit (Aft, LA1996), was provided by the C. M. Rick Tomato Genetic Resource Center (University of California, Davis, CA, USA), and was grown in a greenhouse under natural photoperiod conditions from March to July 2006 in Chiba Prefecture. Fruits of Momotaro 8®, line 27859, and Aft were harvested at MG and R stages. The peel and the flesh of fruits of Micro-Tom, Momotaro 8®, line 27 859, and Aft were separated using a razor blade. Harvested tissues were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C.2.2. Preparation of RNATotal RNA was extracted from tissues by an acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method.23 Sugars were removed by a sodium acetate-precipitation method.242.3. DNA microarray analysisTarget for hybridization experiments was prepared using GeneChip One-Cycle Labeling and Control Reagents (Affymetrix, URL: http://www.affymetrix.com/) according to the manufacturer's instructions. GeneChip Tomato Genome Arrays (Affymetrix) were used for hybridization. Hybridization, washing, and staining were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Scanned GeneChip images were analysed using Microarray Suite version 5.0.1 software (Affymetrix). Normalization and analysis of microarray data were performed using GeneSpring GX 7.3 software (Agilent Technologies, URL: http://www.home.agilent.com/). The data were normalized per chip and per gene to the median value. CEL files of these experiments are available in Gene Expression Omnibus6 (GEO) DataSets (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gds) series record GSE19326.2.4. Coexpression analysis and network analysisBefore performing coexpression analysis, the probes used for the analysis were screened as follows. First, probes for which flags were ‘A’ (absent) in all of the samples were excluded. Second, the coefficient of variance between biological replicates of a tissue was calculated, and probes were selected if they showed a coefficient of variance <1 in all of the samples. This probe screening procedure left 7644 probes for the following coexpression analysis. Normalized values of the selected probes were used to estimate the pairwise PCC. The data set for the PCC was then analysed using a network-based module-finding algorithm described previously by Ogata et al.4 This algorithm generates coexpression modules from a given ‘seed’ gene in six steps.4 In the first step, a seed gene was arbitrary chosen. In the second step, genes that directly connect to the seed gene with PCC higher than cutoff value (0.6) were selected, and referred to as a highly correlated gene group. In the third step, VB index was defined as VB(i) = e(i)/d(i), where VB(i) is a VB value of ith gene in the group, e(i) the number of edges between ith gene and other group member genes, and d(i) the number of edges between ith gene and all genes irrespective of group membership. VB value was calculated for all group member genes, and a gene that has the lowest VB value was excluded from the group. In the fourth step, from the highly correlated gene group, a subgroup that had the highest NB value4 was selected. NB value is defined as NB = Se(i)/Sd(i), where definitions of e(i) and d(i) are the same as above. In short, NB represents a ratio of the number of edges within the subgroup to the number of all edges associated with subgroup members. The selected subgroup was referred to as ‘the best kernel gene group’. In the fifth step, VB value was calculated for all non-member genes. If a non-member gene had the ratio higher than threshold value, that gene was incorporated into the group. Finally, the best kernel group genes and genes incorporated in the fifth step were selected as members of a coexpression module. NB values of coexpression modules were calculated again, and coexpression modules with NB values >0.5 were selected. Threshold values were as follows: 0.6 for PCC, 0.333 for VB value, and 0.5 for NB value. For GO annotation of tomato genes, similarity search of the Affymetrix tomato consensus sequences that were used to design GeneChip probes (Tomato Consensus Sequences, downloaded from http://www.affymetrix.com/products_services/arrays/specific/tomato.affx#1_4) was performed against Arabidopsis genes (TAIR8_cdna_20080412, downloaded from the TAIR FTP site, http://www.arabidopsis.org/download/index.jsp) using the BLASTN algorithm. GO annotations of tomato genes were retrieved from TAIR GO Annotation Search (http://www.arabidopsis.org/tools/bulk/go/index.jsp) according to the best match to Arabidopsis genes.2.5. Transformation of tomato plantA full-length cDNA clone of zinc finger protein (clone ID: LEFL2003DB10, GenBank accession number AK326277) was provided by National Bio-Resource Project Tomato25 (http://tomato.nbrp.jp/indexEn.html). Protein coding region of LEFL2003DB10 was amplified by PCR using a gene-specific primer set (5'-GGGGGGATCCATGGCAGTTGAGGCAAGACATC and 5'-GGGGGAGTCTTCAAGAAGACATGTTAACATGCAC). PCR product was cloned in between BamHI and SacI sites of pBE2113-GUS.26 Transformation of S. lycopersicum cv. Micro-Tom was performed essentially as described by Sun et al.27 with slight modification. Cotyledon and hypocotyl segments from 7-day-old seedling were used as explants. Explants were dipped in Agrobacterium tumefaciens (strain EHA105) suspension for 10 min and blotted dry on a sterilized paper towel. The explants were then placed on co-cultivation medium [MS salts, 3% (w/v) sucrose, 0.8% (w/v) agar, 1.75 mg/l zeatin, pH 5.8], and the plate was incubated for 48 h in the dark at 25°C. The explants were then cultured and selected on a callus induction plate containing MS salts, 3% (w/v) sucrose, 0.8% (w/v) agar, 1.5 mg/l zeatin, 50 mg/l kanamycin, 125 mg/l carbenicillin, 50 mg/l Meropen (Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma, Osaka, Japan) (pH 5.8). Every 2 weeks, calli were subcultured to a fresh callus induction plate. Subculture was repeated three times and zeatin concentration in the medium was gradually decreased (1.5, 1.0, and then 0.75 mg/l). Regenerated shoots were then rooted on a rooting plate containing half-strength MS salts, 3% (w/v) sucrose, 0.8% (w/v) agar, 50 mg/l Meropen (pH 5.8). Rooted plants were transferred to rock fibre (Nittobo, Tokyo, Japan, URL: http://www.nittobo.co.jp/english/index.htm), and then to a mixture of vermiculite and Powersoil (mix ratio 1:1, Kureha Chemical Ind., Tokyo, Japan, and Kanto Hiryou Ind., Saitama, Japan).2.6. Real-time RT–PCRRT–PCR experiments were performed to confirm gene expression patterns observed in microarray experiments. The total RNA samples used as templates in microarray analysis were reverse transcribed using SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen Corp., URL: http://www.invitrogen.com/) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following reverse transcription, PCR was carried out using rTaq DNA polymerase (Takara Bio Inc., URL; http://www.takara-bio.com/index.htm). Real-time PCR reactions to confirm gene expression were carried out using a DyNAmo™ HS SYBR® Green qPCR Kit (New England Biolabs Inc., URL: http://www.neb.com/nebecomm/default.asp) by a DNA Engine Opticon 2 system (MJ Research Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). Primers used in this study are shown in Supplementary data 1. Elongation factor 1a gene (GenBank accession number X14449) was used as a control.2.7. Transient expression of GFP-fusion proteinTransient expression vectors of the zinc finger protein fused to GFP were produced as described in Supplementary data 2. CaMV35S-sGFP(S65T)-nos3' vector28 was used for transient expression of free GFP. The vectors were introduced to the epidermis of onion purchased from local market. Particle bombardment was performed by using Helios Gene Gun (Bio-Rad Laboratories, URL: http://www3.bio-rad.com/) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Expression of GFP-fusion proteins was monitored by using a confocal laser scanning microscope LSM700 (Carl Zeiss, URL: http://www.zeiss.com/). Image processing was performed using the ZEN 2008 software (Carl Zeiss).3. Results and discussion3.1. Identification of coexpression modulesWe obtained gene expression data for tomato from 67 hybridizations using RNA derived from roots, hypocotyls, cotyledons, leaves, and fruits (Table 1, Supplementary data 3). To estimate coexpression profiles, we first calculated PCC values for all pair-wise combinations of the 7644 quality-checked probes (see Materials and methods). To find coexpression modules, we first generated network graphs using different PCC cutoff values. Network density became minimal at a cutoff value of 0.91, suggesting that, at a PCC cutoff value >0.91, a decreasing number of nodes are more tightly connected (Fig. 1A). Indeed, the numbers of nodes and edges decreased at PCC cutoffs >0.91 (Fig. 1B and C). However, even at a PCC cutoff of 0.95, the network was still complex, containing ~1000 nodes and 5000 edges (Fig. 1B and C). Thus, we concluded that the use of a PCC cutoff value alone will not efficiently find coexpression modules to an extent allowing the inference of module functions.Global topology of the tomato coexpression network.

Each coexpression module was reconstituted from a given seed gene. Genes directly connected to the seed gene were first selected using PCC cutoff value. From this set of correlated genes, a subgroup that had the highest NB value4 (see Materials and methods) was selected, and referred to as the kernel group. Next, VB value (for definition, see Materials and methods) was calculated for all genes not belonging to the kernel group. If the gene had VB value higher than the threshold, that gene was incorporated into the kernel group. Resulting set of genes was defined as coexpression module. Modules with NB value above threshold were selected for further analysis. As a result, generated modules have dense connections within the module and sparse connections to other modules. When member genes overlapped between multiple modules, non-redundant member genes were bundled into a larger module. It has been reported that this approach can detect coexpression modules with better assignment to biological processes (e.g. metabolic pathway) than other algorithms.4 On the basis of this approach, 199 coexpression modules were identified (Supplementary data 4) using following threshold values: PCC cutoff, 0.6; VB value, 0.333; and NB value, 0.5. The number of member probes per module ranged from 3 to 103, with a median value of 7 member probes per module (Fig. 2A). The distribution of the NB value4 showed that more than 40% of the modules have an NB value >0.8, indicating that the modules have high intra-modular connectivity (Fig. 2B).Distribution of characteristic parameters of the identified coexpression modules.

GO annotations to tomato probes were provided according to their similarity to Arabidopsis genes using a TAIR GO annotation search. First, we investigated whether or not specific GO terms were enriched in a given module compared with the GO term distribution in all Affymetrix tomato microarray probes. Enrichment of GO categories with significance at the 1% level was observed in 75 modules (Table 2). Enriched GO categories included chloroplast, plastid, cytosol, ribosome, other enzymatic activity, transferase activity, hydrolase activity, kinase activity, structural molecule activity, protein metabolism, and response to stress (Fig. 3). Ribosome-related genes were expected to be coexpressed, since ribosome is a protein complex. Coexpression modules enriched with chloroplast-related genes appear to be classified into several subgroups according to the sub-plastidal localization (e.g. envelope, thylakoid, and stroma) of proteins encoded by the module member genes.Distribution of GO category significantly enriched within a coexpression module. Note that GO categories of ‘chloroplast’ and ‘plastid’ are frequently associated with the same genes.

Coexpression modules containing transcription factor genesCoexpression analysis can facilitate prediction of functions of regulatory proteins that do not have enzymatic, transporter, or structural molecule activities. Modules containing transcription factor genes are of particular interest, since these transcription factors may have a role in controlling the expression of other module member genes. We identified 37 modules containing transcription factors in the 199 modules. In 16 modules containing transcription factors, significant enrichment of certain GO categories was observed (Table 2). For example, two transcription factor genes are found in module 52 (Table 2, Supplementary data 4). Genes corresponding to Les.3716.1.S1_at (GenBank accession number AJ277944) and Les.3517.2.S1_a_at (GenBank accession number BT012879), respectively, encoding Myb-family and TCP-family transcription factors, are tightly correlated with seven protease inhibitor unigenes (SGN tomato unigenes: SGN-U313509, SGN-U312622, SGN-U312829, SGN-U312623, SGN-U312822, SGN-U313508, and SGN-U312824) (Supplementary data 4). This implies that these transcription factors regulate expression of protease inhibitor genes. Another example is module 3 (Table 2, Supplementary data 4). Gene corresponding to LesAffx.69411.1.S1_at (GenBank accession number AW651000) encoding bHLH-family transcription factor is correlated exclusively with plastid-associated genes, implying that this bHLH-family protein is associated with the regulation of plastid function.3.3. Regulatory protein that does not belong to transcription factor family can regulate expression of module member genesElucidation of the role of transcription factors in regulating expression of coexpressed genes has been well documented.13 However, the role of regulatory protein genes that are not classified as transcription factors in the regulation of coexpressed genes remains unclear. We tested whether a non-transcription factor-type regulatory gene can control the coordinated expression of genes in a given module. To exemplify this, we performed an experimental analysis of module 64 (NB value 0.850, average PCC value 0.822), in which flavonoid biosynthesis genes are enriched (Table 3). Expression profiles of member genes of this module show that they are highly expressed in fruit peel tissues, and are expressed at a lower level in leaf and fruit flesh tissues, an expression pattern that correlates with the localization of tomato flavonoid compounds22 (Fig. 4A). We found that one of the non-enzymatic genes, corresponding to Les.2294.2.A1_at (GenBank accession number AK326277), encodes RING-finger type zinc finger protein by protein domain search using InterProScan29 (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/InterProScan/), although description of the best match Arabidopsis gene (At1g79110) and SGN unigene (SGN-U323178) indicates ‘expressed protein’ (Fig. 4B, Supplementary data 4). In a network graph of module 64, enzymatic genes of flavonoid biosynthesis are tightly interconnected. The zinc finger protein gene, hereafter referred to as ZnF, has direct links to genes of 4-coumarate-CoA ligase, cinnamoyl-CoA reductase, chalcone synthase 1, flavanone 3-hydroxylase, flavonol synthase, glycosyltransferases, and malonyl-CoA synthetase (Fig. 4C). To test whether this ZnF gene controls expression of flavonoid biosynthetic genes, we overexpressed a full-length cDNA of this gene (clone ID: LEFL2003DB10) in Micro-Tom. Gene expression analysis was performed using leaf tissues, in which expression of flavonoid biosynthesis genes is low in wild-type plants. Expression of genes of 4-coumarate-CoA ligase, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase, cinnamoyl-CoA reductase, chalcone synthase 1, chalcone synthase 2, chalcone isomerase, flavanone 3-hydroxylase 1, and flavonol synthase was higher in ZnF-overexpressing leaves than in control leaves, although PCC values between ZnF and these up-regulated genes were not very high, mainly because of high expression levels in one of the transformant lines (Fig. 4D). On the other hand, the expression of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, which is not a member of the module, did not change significantly. The expression of flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase genes correlated negatively with overexpression of the ZnF gene. These results demonstrated that the ZnF gene positively regulates the expression of enzymatic genes in the early part of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway, which is consistent with the coexpression relationship seen in module 64.Experimental verification of the coexpression relationship between members of module 64.

We obtained the same result using ZnF–GFP fusion protein (data not shown). This result suggests that ZnF protein is localized to cytosol, and that ZnF protein is not a canonical transcription factor protein. The RING-finger type zinc finger domain is reportedly involved in protein–protein interaction.30 Thus, it can be hypothesized that the ZnF gene positively regulates the expression of flavonoid biosynthetic genes through interaction with other transcriptional regulator proteins. This example demonstrates the potential of coexpression analysis in inferring functions of unknown regulatory genes that do not belong to transcription factor families.Intracellular localization of (A) GFP protein and (B) GFP-ZnF fusion protein.

Potential of coexpression analysis in predicting functions of uncharacterized genesRecently, coexpression analysis was used to predict the function of a transporter gene involved in Arabidopsis glucosinolate biosynthesis.31 The function of this transporter gene, BASS5, was experimentally demonstrated using BASS5 knockout Arabidopsis plants, in which the accumulation of methionine-derived glucosinolates decreased. The results shown in the present study, together with this previous transporter study, suggest that the validity of gene-to-gene coexpression analysis is not limited to genes involved in protein complex formation or transcriptional regulation, but is also applicable to inferring the function of various types of uncharacterized genes. Experimental verification of the functions of several other candidate genes for regulatory protein is in progress.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was partly supported by the Research and Development Program for New Bio-Industry Initiatives, and by a grant from Kazusa DNA Research Institute.CaMV35S-sGFP(S65T)-nos3' plasmid was kindly provided by Dr Yasuo Niwa (University of Shizuoka).

Despite structural similarities between IL-12 and IL-23, they have vastly different immunological roles. The IL-23 complex is primarily secreted by monocyte-derived dendritic cells and macrophages1 and is reported to play a critical role in survival of T helper (Th)17 cells and possibly the formation of Th17 memory cells.2 Th17 cells have been implicated in resistance to fungal and extracellular bacterial pathogens as well as induction of various types of organ specific autoimmunity.3 In addition to the potential role in adaptive immunity, recent reviews have described IL-23 as being ‘primitive in origin’ and have proposed a primary role in the evolutionary older innate immune system,4 particularly in mediating inflammatory attacks against pathogens of the intestine.5–9 Such pleiotropic cytokines may prove useful in determining an evolutionary link between the innate and adaptive immune pathways. Consistent with the innate immune system evolving prior to the adaptive immune response, it is reasonable to assume that molecules involved in this system may have evolved more rapidly and be genetically conserved across a broad spectrum of evolutionary distant species.Since the discovery of IL-23, investigators have queried previous reports that target the shared p40 subunit to implicate IL-12 in several common autoimmune diseases.10–12 Subsequent studies have described a role for IL-23 (and in some instances exonerated IL-12) in the pathogenesis of many of these diseases.5–9The gene responsible for encoding the unique IL-23 p19 protein, later termed IL23A, was first described by Oppmann et al.1 It is generally believed that the rate-limiting step of IL-23 production is expression of the p19 transcript.13 In light of the important role, IL-23 plays in both the innate and the adaptive immune response reportedly by enhancing the production of IL-17,14 it is within reason to hypothesize that regulation of IL23A expression, and therefore genetic variants within this gene, may be critical in determining the host immune response, as well as the development of autoimmune disease.In this study, we determine the extent of IL23A sequence variation in two ethnically distinct human populations, including 48 Europeans from Australia and 48 Bantu from Southern Africa. Participants were randomly selected, with no known disease status. Our linguistically mixed Southern African Bantu population (including Xhosa, Tswana and Sotho) more closely represents the origin of anatomically modern humans.15 We use the observed mutational spectrum and intra-species comparisons to determine the degree of evolutionary conservation and make predictions regarding functional implications.Direct Sanger sequence analysis of IL23A (including ~2.9 kb 5' and 1.9 kb 3' of the transcription start and stop sites, respectively) in each of the two human populations, revealed a total of 33 different DNA variants present within the 6.36-kb region screened. All DNA variants underwent dual independent observations either as a result of bidirectional sequence validation and/or locality in overlapping fragments. With the exception of one variant at -1752 bp from the translation start site (-1752C>G; rs73324334), all variants observed were population specific (Table 1). The obvious distinction between variants in the two groups is important to note for investigating diseases with a strong correlation to ethnicity, particularly in this case, autoimmune-related diseases.16–18Variant distribution of human IL23A in 96 individuals of Bantu and European ancestryVariants within a 6357-bp IL23A region were identified in both Bantu and Europeans for 48 individuals each, using direct Sanger sequencing (primer information and amplification conditions for the 10 overlapping fragments available upon request).aVariants in complete LD within the Bantu population.bVariants in complete LD within the European population.Variant distribution of human IL23A in 96 individuals of Bantu and European ancestryVariants within a 6357-bp IL23A region were identified in both Bantu and Europeans for 48 individuals each, using direct Sanger sequencing (primer information and amplification conditions for the 10 overlapping fragments available upon request).aVariants in complete LD within the Bantu population.bVariants in complete LD within the European population.In addition to demonstrating the ethnic uniqueness of IL23A, we also highlight the limited genetic analysis of this gene to date. A total of 23 different genetic variants were identified in the Bantu, 16 (70%) of which had not previously been reported. Novel variants were also observed in the European population, and represented 7 (64%) of the 11 variants observed in this group. The increased observation of novel variation in the Southern African Bantu population collective can be explained by the exclusion of this largely diverse population grouping from current whole genome sequencing efforts defining current SNP database content. A recent report defines the Xhosa Bantu-speaking Southern Africans as genetically distinct from the peoples of Western African Yoruba.19Haplotype predictive tools are not only important for identifying tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; relevant for disease association studies), but also for investigating the rate of gene evolution. As a result of population-specific variant distribution, linkage disequilibrium (LD) and haplotype analysis were performed on each the Bantu and European groups separately. Pairwise LD analysis on the Bantu samples, predicted a single haplotype block encompassing a 1-kb region towards the 5' end of the gene, which showed strong LD between four variants, -2572A>G, -2192C>T, -1982C>T and -1538G>A (Fig. 1A). Three different combinations were predicted with the wild-type haplotype represented in 90.6% of the population (Fig. 1A). Overall, there were 25 allelic combinations predicted for the 23 variants identified in the Bantu (Supplementary Table S1). In Europeans, a single haplotype block within a 4-kb region towards the 3' end of the gene was determined, including three variants in complete LD, -1752C>G (rs73324334), 703G>A (rs11171806, Ser106Ser) and 3162G>T (rs11575248) (Fig. 1B). The wild-type alleles were predicted to represent 94.8% of haplotypes (Fig. 1B). Frequency calculations for all 10 haplotype combinations identified in the Europeans demonstrate a high level of conservation within this group, with the wild-type alleles present in 85.4% of individuals (Supplementary Table S1). In accordance with genetic evolutionary data, the Southern African Bantu populations are among the genetically oldest populations in the world in comparison to the relatively young European populations,20 thus the evolutionary time-line allows for more genetic variation (as depicted in this study) as well as more recombination events to have occurred. Although only a single haplotype block is depicted in each population (Fig. 1), the genetic distance within the Bantu haplotype (1 kb) is 4-fold smaller than the European haplotype block (4 kb). The importance of the identified variants and haplotypes in disease susceptibility studies would require further validation.Pairwise LD plots and haplotype combinations of Bantu (A) and European (B) variants.

LD and haplotype information was generated using Haploview v4.1.The majority of the 33 variants identified in this study occur outside the transcribed gene region. Of the five (15.6%) variants within the transcribed region, two are coding (both synonymous), and three occur in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of exon 1. Similarly, of the 21 SNPs described on one or both EntrezSNP (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/) and SNPper (http://snpper.chip.org) SNP databases (nine of which are reported in this study), only four are located within the transcribed region of IL23A, three synonymous and one intronic. Only one of these previously reported transcribed SNPs was identified in our study. We conclude that the amino acid coding region of IL23A is highly conserved not only in the recently migrated (out of Africa) European population, but also the genetically diverse Southern African Bantu. Genomic regions, which exhibit a high degree of conservation, beyond neutral expectations, are often reported as having important functional roles.21 It may further be postulated that variants which might affect the function of IL23A may be found in the regulatory regions, rather than coding regions of this gene. A recent study, which used a genome wide scan to identify psoriasis susceptibility loci in a European cohort, was the first to implicate a genetic variant within the IL23A locus to autoimmune disease susceptibility.22 This variant, rs2066808, is located 3.7 kb 3' of IL23A (not within the 6.4-kb region of our analysis); however, any functional effect of this variant remains to be elucidated.In this study, a total of 20 variants were observed 5' of the transcription start site. Initially, we assessed whether the variants we observed were located within known transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs), namely NF-<U+03BA>B, ATF-2 and SMAD-3.23,24 We observed, no variants within these published sites. Assessing the entire 5' region using MatInspector (Genomatix) for the wild-type and variant promoter sequences for known IL23A TFBSs NF-<U+03BA>B, ATF-2, SMAD-3 and Stat3,25 no difference in transcription factor binding was predicted. Lack of direct impact on protein function or transcriptional activity is suggestive that IL23A variation defined in this study may be as a direct result of neutral contribution and that functionally important variants would have undergone selection pressure as a result of reduced fitness. Concluding that the regulatory region of IL23A is highly conserved is in concordance with the proposed hypothesis of conservation of regulatory regions of genes involved in highly complex, adaptive physiological processes.26 As such genes are often not constitutively expressed, regulatory regions are considered more fundamental to maintaining an adequate response.To determine the level of evolutionary conservation of IL23A, we performed sequence alignment of the transcribed region across the current content of vertebrates within the UCSC Genome Browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu). Comparisons revealed a high level of genetic conservation within the coding region of IL23A across all species presenting with a human IL23A gene homolog (32 of 44) from the platypus to the chimpanzee (Supplementary Fig. S1). Of note is the large degree of conservation across the transcribed region within the extended primate family.To further investigate intra-species conservation, the evolutionary relationship of IL23A between several mammalian species was predicted using Molecular Evolutionary Genetic Analysis version 4 (MEGA4) software.27 All publicly available (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) IL23A mRNA sequences, including Homo sapien (Human, GenBank no. NM_016584), Pan troglodytes (Chimpanzee, XM_522436), Sus scrofa (Swine, NM_001130236), Bos taurus (Bovine, XM_588269), Rattus norvegicus (Norwegian rat, NM_130410) and Mus musculus (common house mouse, NM_031252), were aligned using ClustalW, and a phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbour-joining and maximum likelihood methods on the basis of nucleotide differences (Fig. 2A). This analysis revealed complete homology of the IL23A mRNA transcript between humans and the closely related chimpanzee indicating that in the estimated 5–7 million years since evolutionary divergence of these two species,28 the transcribed sequence of IL23A has remained unaltered. In contrast, phylogenetic analysis of the gene, which encodes the p40 subunit of IL-23 and the binding partner of IL-23 p19, IL12B, revealed some (although minor) evolutionary divergence between the common transcript for both humans and chimpanzees (Fig. 2B). Similarly, the evolutionary distance between the human IL23A mRNA sequence and that of the remaining species was ~2-fold less than that observed between the human IL12B mRNA sequence and the alternative species (Fig. 2A scale bar represents 0.01 base substitutions per site compared with 0.02 in Fig. 2B). These results further illustrate the exceptional level of evolutionary conservation of IL23A compared with another closely related member of this cytokine family.Phylogenetic tree representing the evolutionary relationship of six mammalian IL23A (A) and IL12B (B) mRNA sequences.

Although in this study we identify novel DNA variation at the IL23A locus, we also demonstrate the highly conserved nature of IL23A, at both amino acid and predicted regulatory levels. This study therefore highlights the potential significance of genetic variants found within this gene locus. Identifying functional variants, whether they are common disease associated variants or rare non-synonymous mutations, may provide key information in determining a role for IL23A in disease progression.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingFunding sources include Cancer Institute New South Wales (CINSW) career development and support fellowship to V.M.H., CINSW scholar award and Australian Rotary Health PhD scholarship to E.A.T.We would like to thank Dr Desiree Petersen and Prof. Web Miller for helpful communications.

This is the first genome sequence from the phylum Deferribacteres.1. IntroductionGenerally, the greatest challenge to thermophilic microorganisms living on hydrothermal vents may be posed by the risk of being swept out of the range of the vent and thereby losing the temperature range and necessary chemical supplies. They solve this problem by clinging to rocks in communal mats or swimming with a whip-like flagellum as sensing temperature or chemical stimuli to guide their directional movements.1Deferribacter desulfuricans SMM1T (DSM 14783T) has been isolated from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent chimney at the Suiyo Seamount in the Izu-Bonin Arc, Japan.2 The strain SMM1 is thermophilic (optimal temperature, 60–65°C) and a strictly anaerobic heterotroph capable of using complex organic compounds such as yeast extract and tryptone, ethanol, and various organic acids as sources of energy and carbon. There are three other species in the genus Deferribacter—D. abyssi and D. autotrophicus, which have been isolated from deep-sea hydrothermal vent environments, and D. thermophilus, which has been isolated from a subseafloor petroleum reservoir.3–5 These bacteria are strictly anaerobic chemolithotrophs utilizing various organic compounds and H2 as electron donors and nitrate, S0 (D. desulfuricans, D. abyssi, and D. autotrophicus), and Fe (III) and Mn (IV) (D. thermophilus, D. abyssi, and D. autotrophicus) as electron acceptors. Such versatility for energy generation may provide an ecological advantage for deep-sea vent-dominating chemolithotrophs as has been proposed for members of Aquificales and Epsilonproteobacteria.6 It has been shown, depending on the hydrothermal vent chimney environment, that Deferribacter-related species are the dominant species in these locations.7,8 Thus, it is intriguing to compare the genomes of Deferribacter-related species with other deep-sea vent chemolithotrophic species such as Thiomicrospira crunogena,9Nautilia profundicola,10Sulfurovum sp. NBC37-1,11Nitratiruptor sp. SB155-2,11 and Persephonella marina12 in order to highlight the genomic features that reflect their lifestyle in the environment of deep-sea hydrothermal vent chimneys. Here, we report the complete genome sequence of thermophilic D. desulfuricans SMM1 determined as the first published bacterial genome sequence from the phylum Deferribacteres. We provide a comparative analysis of the genome of D. desulfuricans SMM1 with those of five other chemolithotrophs isolated from deep-sea hydrothermal vent chimneys.2. Materials and methods2.1. Genome sequencing and assemblyDeferribacter desulfuricans SSM1 was grown heterotrophically as described previously,2 and total DNA was isolated using proteinase K treatment followed by phenol extraction. The DNA was fragmented by HydroShear (Genomic Solutions), and three shotgun libraries were generated: small- and medium-insert (1.5 and 5 kb) plasmid libraries and a large-insert fosmid (35 kb) library as described previously.13 All three libraries provided 15 times coverage of the genome. Assemblies were accomplished using the PHRED/PHRAP/CONSED suite (http://www.pharap.org).14 Gaps between the assembled sequences were primarily closed by primer walking on gap-spanning library clones or with PCR products from genomic DNA. Quality assessment of the final assembly was performed as described previously.132.2. Gene identification and annotationPutative non-translated genes were identified by using the Rfam15 and tRNAscan-SE16 programs, whereas rRNA genes were identified using the BLASTN program.17 Protein-coding sequences (CDSs) were predicted using a combination of GLIMMER18 and GeneMarkS.19 The remaining parts of the genome were screened further to find missed CDSs by a BLASTX homology search against protein databases. The predicted CDSs were translated and submitted for BLAST analysis against the NCBI non-redundant (nr),20 UniProt,21 and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) GENES22 databases. The results were collated and presented via a home-made browser (GBROWN) for manual verification. The start sites were manually inspected and altered in an alignment comparison with the best match. The revised CDS set was searched against Pfam23 in addition to the previously mentioned databases. Specific functional assignments suggested by matches with these databases were only accepted when they had a minimum 30% amino acid sequence identity over 70% of the gene length and were supported by Pfam domain assignments, or were consistent with gene context in the genome (e.g. membership in a potential operon with other genes with convincing matches to curated databases). The KEGG PATHWAY and MetaCyc24 databases were used for pathway reconstruction. Signal peptides were predicted with SignalP,25 whereas transmembrane helices were predicted with SOSUI.26 Clusters of regularly interspaced repeats [clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)] were identified using the CRISPRFinder.272.3. Comparative genomics analysesProtein sequence data for bacterial genomes were obtained from the KEGG database.22 Pairwise ortholog families were identified with the InParanoid program.28 In order to examine genome-wide relationships of D. desulfuricans in terms of gene repertories, the ordination of bacterial genomes was generated using the non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) method, which is a major branch of multivariate analysis. NMDS ordinations attempt to place all samples in an arbitrary two-dimensional space, in which the relative distances between the samples indicate the corresponding pairwise similarity. Hence, closely related organisms in the NMDS ordination would have similar gene repertoires. The gene context of each genome, based on clusters of orthologous groups (COGs),29 was constructed with the following procedure. Each complete proteome was compared with the COG profile database (4450 families) using the RPSBLAST program.17 A significant match (E-value of 10-5) was determined for each COG, so that any outlier detected by the Smirnov–Grubbs test at the 0.01 significance level was excluded from the COG profile. Any proteome was thus converted into a binary character matrix indicating the presence (1) or absence (0) of the COG families. The genome distance between species (A and B) was calculated by the formula: DAB = 1 - JAB, where JAB is the Jaccard's coefficient, which reflects the similarity of gene content between A and B.30 NMDS ordination was calculated using metaMDS in the vegan library running with the R programming language and environment (R package version 2.7.2: R Development Core Team, 2007, http://www.R.project.org).2.4. Nucleotide sequence accession numbersThe sequences of the D. desulfuricans genome, consisting of the chromosome and plasmid sequences, are available at GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ under accession numbers AP011529 and AP011530, respectively.3. Results and discussion3.1. General genome featuresThe genome of Deferribacter desulfuricans SSM1 contains a single circular chromosome of 2 234 389 bp and a megaplasmid (pDF308) of 308 544 bp (Table 1). Their average G + C contents are 31.1% and 24.5%, respectively. The chromosome displays two clear GC skew transitions that likely correspond to the DNA replication origin and terminus (Fig. 1). Annotation of the chromosomal sequence reveals 2117 CDSs, of which 1404 (66%) can be functionally assigned. The megaplasmid encodes 257 CDSs, whereas more than two-thirds are unique and exhibit no apparent similarity with any of the CDSs present in the database. Interestingly, 17 copies of gene cluster encoding two transposases belonging to the IS200 and IS605 family present in the megaplasmid but none were found in the chromosome. The chromosome contains two ribosomal RNA operons with a 16S–23S–5S rRNA gene alignment. In all, 43 tRNA genes were identified (Table 1). In addition to the regular tRNA genes, the D. desulfuricans genome also contains selC for the selenocysteine tRNA. The other components necessary for the selenocysteine system, e.g. selenocysteine synthetase (SelA), the specific elongation factor (SelB), selenophosphate synthetase (SelD), and seryl-tRNA synthetase (SerS), are also present in the genome. As for small RNA-encoding genes, potential genes for RNase P RNA (RnpB) and 6S RNA (SsrS) were assigned by using the Rfam database.

The outermost circle shows the location of genomic islands (red) and CRISPR/Cas systems (blue). The ‘0’ marked on the outmost circles corresponds to the putative replication origin, and the putative replication termination site of the chromosome is at 1.23 Mb.The D. desulfuricans chromosome contains three genomic islands, termed DDGI-1 (coordinates 278 054–313 125), DDGI-2 (coordinates 687 244–708 238), and DDGI-3 (coordinates 864 851–901 750), possibly acquired via horizontal gene transfer (Fig. 1 and Table 1). They have many specific features of genomic island, such as the tRNA gene locus at junctions and the presence of direct repeats and phage integrases (DEFDS_0277, DEFDS_0708, and DEFDS_0871), but no anomalous GC content.31 Most of the genes in the genomic islands encode hypothetical proteins, but some of those appeared to encode the functional proteins related to the adaptation mechanisms for the hydrothermal vent environments. For example, the DDGI-1 includes two heavy-metal transporting P-type ATPases (DEFDS_0300 and DEFDS_0301). The heavy-metal transporters could be responsible for heavy metal tolerance in the hydrothermal vent environment. The DDGI-2 has a toxin–antitoxin system (DEFDS_0716 and DEFDS_0717) involved in phage defence and the stress response.32Similar to most other thermophiles, D. desulfuricans has the CRISPR elements together with their associated genes (cas), which would serve as immunity against phages, possibly by an RNA-interference-like mechanism.33 The CRISPR/Cas systems were identified in the chromosome (coordinates 77 878– 86 387) and the plasmid (coordinates 267 868–276 377). Both systems have an identical repeat, and the cas genes also show a high relevance with each other. Regarding the repeat sequence and structure of the cas genes, the systems of D. desulfuricans were closely related with those observed in other thermophiles, such as Sulfurihydrogenibium azorense, Thermoanaerobacter pseudethanolicus, and the homo-acetogen Clostridium thermocellum. Therefore, the D. desulfuricans CRISPR/Cas systems may have been acquired horizontally via the megaplasmid.3.2. Orthologous relationships among the bacterial speciesAmong the proteins identified in the D. desulfuricans genome, ~30% of them showed the highest similarity to those species from Deltaproteobacteria, especially Geobacter, Pelobacter, Desulfovibrio, and Syntrophobacter spp., and ~14% were found to be most similar to those from clostridial species. The remaining proteins showed the highest similarities to several species from Aquificae (5.3%), Gammaproteobacteria (4.8%), and Epsilonproteobacteria (3.7%). Approximately half of the proteins were shared between D. desulfuricans and deltaproteobacterial species, such as Geobacter sulfurreducens PCA (1106 orthologs), Pelobacter carbinolicus (1046 orthologs), Syntrophobacter fumaroxidans (985 orthologs), and Desulfovibrio vulgaris subsp. vulgaris Hildenborough (936 orthologs), although D. desulfuricans is phylogenetically distant from Deltaproteobacteria.For the next step of orthologous analysis, we performed multivariate analyses on the basis of the gene repertories from 51 bacterial species in order to schematically express the orthologous relationships of D. desulfuricans among other bacterial species (Fig. 2A). As expected, the correlation map indicated that D. desulfuricans and the deltaproteobacterial species, which have strong orthologous relationships, gathered around the centre of map. The same analysis to focus on six species of the class Deltaproteobacteria with D. desulfuricans showed that D. desulfuricans is especially related to three species, G. sulfurreducens (gsu), P. carbinolicus (pca), and D. vulgaris (dvu), possessing sulphur- or sulphate-reducing properties (Fig. 2B). This result seems to attribute that these four species share many genes involved in physiological and metabolic properties such as anaerobiosis and assimilations system for small organic molecules (e.g. acetate, pyruvate, and lactate) as carbon and energy source.Ordination plot of bacterial genomes using NMDS.

Central metabolismDeferribacter desulfuricans grows heterotrophically using a variety of organic acids (formate, acetate, propionate, pyruvate, and lactate) with nitrate or S0 as a primary electron acceptor.2 As shown in Fig. 3, the reconstructed central metabolic pathways from the D. desulfuricans genome certainly showed that these organic acids could be utilized as energy and carbon sources via the oxidative tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and various anaplerotic pathways. Acetate used as a D. desulfuricans SSM1 growth substrate can be activated to acetyl-CoA either via a single-step reaction by an acetyl-CoA synthetase (Acs: DEFDS_0854) or a two-step reaction by acetate kinase (AckA: DEFDS_1816) and phosphate acetyltransferase (Pta: DEFDS_1815). The AckA–Pta reaction can also operate in acetate production from acetyl-CoA in a fermentative metabolism of pyruvate, and the enzymatic action of AckA results in ATP production by substrate-level phosphorylation. Lactate may be oxidized to pyruvate by a malate dehydrogenase with a broad substrate specificity. In contrast to acetate and lactate, propionate is fed directly into the TCA cycle via succinyl-CoA. Propionyl-CoA, produced by the activation of propionate by acetyl-CoA synthetase, is converted to succinyl-CoA through a methylmalonyl pathway, including a propionyl-CoA carboxylase (DEFDS_1227-8), a methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase (DEFDS_1935), and a methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MutA: DEFDS_2077 and MutB: DEFDS_1225). The catabolism of pyruvate reflects the anaerobic nature of D. desulfuricans. Conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA is performed by either pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase (POR: DEFDS_0568) or pyruvate-formate lyase (PFL: DEFDS_2103).Central metabolism based on potential growth substrates and metabolic capacities reconstructed from the D. desulfuricans genome.

According to the reconstructed metabolic pathways from the D. desulfuricans genome, formate is oxidized to CO2 by membrane-bound formate dehydrogenase (Fdh: DEFDS_1329-31), which is energetically coupled with the respiratory nitrate or S0 reduction. Methanogens and homo-acetogens are known to assimilate formate to acetyl-CoA via the Wood–Ljungdahl pathway (reductive acetyl-CoA pathway).34 Since the reductive acetyl-CoA pathway is absent in the D. desulfuricans genome, formate must be assimilated by another pathway. A potential reaction for formate assimilation is the direct or indirect conversion of formate and acetyl-CoA to pyruvate, the reverse reaction of pyruvate-formate lyase or the POR-catalysing carboxylation of CO2 coupled with the formate oxidation by the Fdh protein. The pyruvate can then be converted to various biosynthetic intermediates by the TCA cycle and anaplerotic pathways (Fig. 3).The D. desulfuricans genome has a variety of anaplerotic pathways, which include the three enzymes, malic enzyme (MaeB: DEFDS_1074), pyruvate carboxylase (Pyc: DEFDS_1275), and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PckA: DEFDS_1461). These pathways replenish the intermediates of the TCA cycle for gluconeogenesis and amino acid biosynthesis, and their anaplerotic CO2 fixation may be an important function for D. desulfuricans living heterotrophically in a limited organic carbon such as hydrothermal vent environment. In the gluconeogenesis pathway, pyruvate may be dominantly produced by POR from acetyl-CoA and further converted to phosphoenolpyruvate by pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PpdK: DEFDS_0235).The genome possesses genes for the Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas (EMP) pathway and the non-oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway (Fig. 3). The EMP pathway includes fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (DEFDS_1408), which is a key enzyme in gluconeogenesis. The TCA cycle of D. desulfuricans includes 2-oxoglutarate ferredoxin oxidoreductases (OOR: DEFDS_0922-25 and DEFDS_0804-5) instead of 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenases that are typically found in aerobic bacteria. These enzymes catalyse the reversible oxidative decarboxylation of 2-oxoglutarate to form succinyl-CoA, while they are also key enzymes of the reductive TCA (rTCA) cycle. Therefore, the TCA cycle has the potential to proceed in the reverse direction. Although no ATP-dependent citrate lyase (AclAB) is present, the presence of other key enzymes of the rTCA cycle suggests that the rTCA cycle could be partially operative in D. desulfuricans. Actually, oxaloacetate is produced from pyruvate and phosphoenolpyruvate by the anaplerotic enzymes, Pyc and PckA, respectively, and then oxaloacetate is converted to 2-oxoglutarate by operating the TCA cycle in the reductive direction. Among the previously characterized members of the genus Deferribacter, D. abyssi and D. autotrophicus grow autotrophically.3,5 We have also isolated several strictly autotrophic strains of D. desulfuricans from different deep-sea hydrothermal environments (data not shown). Thus, the autotrophy may not be an unusual feature within the genus Deferribacter. The lack of an autotrophic phenotype in the strain SMM1 is presumably caused by the lack of the aclAB genes.Genome analysis suggested the capability of butyrate-fermentation in D. desulfuricans, although it has not been confirmed experimentally. In this pathway, as shown in Fig. 3, butyryl-CoA is converted from acetyl-CoA by the four enzymes—acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase (Thl; DEFDS_1837), 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (Hbd; DEFDS_1836), 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydratase (Crt; DEFDS_1835), and butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (Bcd; DEFDS_1834)—and the electron transfer flavoprotein complex (Etf; DEFDS_1831-1832). The order of this gene cluster is conserved in the genomes of Geobacter metallireducens, Geobacter uraniireducens, and a butyrate-producing clostridial species, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens.35 Butyryl-CoA is converted to butyrate by phosphate butyryltransferase (DEFDS_1240) and butyrate kinase (DEFDS_1241) resulting in the generation of ATP by the substrate-level phosphorylation. This process can be reversible under a certain condition36 and may thus serve for the butyrate utilization.As shown in Fig. 3, the D. desulfuricans genome also contains a set of six genes (rnfCDGEAB, DEFDS_0487-92) related to the potential membrane-bound electron transport complex (Rnf) recently found in various bacteria and archaea.37–39 In nitrogen-fixing bacteria, the Rnf complex transports electrons from NADH to ferredoxin, which donates electrons to nitrogenase.40 It is further proposed that the same enzyme apparently runs in the reverse direction: electron transfer from reduced ferredoxin to NAD+ driving the electrogenic pumping of Na+ out of the cell.39 Regional synteny for the rnf genes in the D. desulfuricans genome was found in several clostridial genomes, such as Clostridium tetani, Clostridium kluyveri, and Halothermothrix orenii. It is supposed that the Rnf complex is involved in the regeneration of NADH for the fermentation of butyrate.41 Since the D. desulfuricans genome indicated the possible fermentation of butyrate and the requirement of reduced ferredoxin for the anabolic reactions, the Rnf complex may be operative in either the forward or reverse flow of electrons, or both. In addition, it is suggested that glycerol can be utilized by glycerol kinase (GlpK, DEFDS_1230), sn-glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GlpD, DEFDS_1577), and triosephosphate isomerase (DEFDS_0129). However, no growth was observed when glycerol was used as the sole source of energy and carbon,2 and this phenomenon is presumably explained by the lack of a glycerol-uptake-facilitator protein.Supporting the heterotrophic ability of D. desulfuricans, a variety of transporters for mono-, di-, and tricarboxylates are encoded within the genome. Actually, the genes encoding two sodium:solute symporter (SSS) family proteins (DEFDS_1547 and DEFDS_1574) and a YaaH family protein, which are presumably involved in acetate uptake, were identified in the genome. In addition, the genes encoding five transporter systems of tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic (TRAP) family (DEFDS_0682-4, DEFDS_0770-2, DEFDS_1399-1400, DEFDS_1846-7, and DEFDS_2070-1) may be involved in uptake of various dicarboxylates such as fumarate, malate, and succinate. In terms of tricarboxylate transporters, the genes for two citrate transporters (DEFDS_1180 and DEFDS_2162) were identified in the genome. On the other hand, the genome encodes two phosphotransferase system sugar transporters for fructose and mannose, although D. desulfuricans could not grow by using sugar.3.4. RespirationSince D. desulfuricans SSM1 is capable of using molecular hydrogen (H2) as an energy source,2 a membrane-bound NiFe-hydrogenase (Hyd) (DEFDS_0075-77) would function as an H2-uptake hydrogenase. As shown in Fig. 4, the oxidation of molecular hydrogen is coupled to the reduction of menaquinone. The genome has two distinctive nitrate-reducing enzymes for respiration, which are coupled to the electron transfer chains (Fig. 4). One is a membrane-bound (Nar: DEFDS_2086-89) and the other is a periplasmic (Nap: DEFDS_1819-23) nitrate reductase, which does not directly contribute to the generation of a proton motive force but contributes to redox balancing.42 It is generally known that bacteria have Nar-type nitrate reductases, but some bacterial species have a Nap-type or both types of nitrate reductase. Nap-type nitrate reductase usually functions as a two-subunit enzyme comprising a catalytic subunit (NapA) that binds a bis-MGD cofactor and a [4Fe-4S] cluster, and an electron transfer subunit (NapB) that binds two c-type haems. However, since D. desulfuricans does not possess the napB gene, the nitrate reductase of D. desulfuricans may be monomeric, which is differentiated from the heterodimeric NapAB structure typically found in bacteria. Actually, NapB-independent periplasmic nitrate reductases have been reported for some species in Deltaproteobacteria and Clostridia.43 The organization of Nap genes in the D. desulfuricans genome is similar to that of Desulfovibrio desulfuricans. Although nitrate is sequentially reduced to N2 (denitrification) or NH4 (ammonification) in many cases, no enzyme for nitrite reduction was identified in the D. desulfuricans genome. This is consistent with experimental results, because the accumulation of nitrite is observed during culture of this organism.2Genome-based models for the energy-conserving electron-transport pathways of D. desulfuricans SSM1. Reducing power acquired by catabolic metabolism (NADH, succinate, and sn-glycerol-3-phosphate) or by oxidation of hydrogen and/or formate is used to reduce sulphur compounds and nitrate, and potentially iron ions via the quinol pool for energy conservation or dissipation. Membrane-binding components are indicated with cylinders or cones, where the upper and the lower reactions are catalysed on the periplasmic side and the cytoplasmic side, respectively. Periplasmic components are indicated with ellipsoids or spheres.

Genome analysis revealed that D. desulfuricans has three gene clusters encoding Psr/Phs enzymes, DEFDS_0670-72, DEFDS_1691-93, and DEFDS_1697-99. The genes in each cluster encode three subunits that construct the following membrane-bound complex enzyme: a catalytic subunit with molybdopterin (PsrA/PhsA), an electron transfer subunit with the [Fe–S] cluster (PsrB/PhsB), and a membrane anchor subunit (PsrC/PhsC). The amino acid sequences of the PsrA/PhsA subunits contain the motif necessary for translocation of the protein towards the periplasmic space via the twin arginine-translocation systems, suggesting that the polysulphide reduction should occur in the periplasmic space. Moreover, an alternative molybdopterin-containing enzyme, tetrathionate reductase (Ttr), is encoded by DEFDS_1446-47, but it is unclear whether this enzyme is involved in energy conservation because of the absence of a membrane anchor subunit. Deferribacter desulfuricans SSM1 presumably uses the polysulphides chemically formed from the reaction of S0 and sulphide, which readily occurs in hydrothermal vents,48 and therefore it needs to transfer polysulphide to the periplasmic space across the outer membrane (Supplementary Fig. S1A). The periplasmic Sud protein in W. succinogenes has been proposed to serve as a polysulphide-binding protein and to transfer polysulphide-sulphur to the active site of polysulphide reductase.49 A Psr/Phs gene cluster (DEFDS_0670-72) in the D. desulfuricans genome is associated with the genes coding an outer membrane porin and lipoprotein (DEFDS_0667-68). The amino acid sequence of DEFDS_0667 represents the functional domain of porin_O_P (phosphate-selective porins O and P) that are conserved in anion-specific porins.50 The lipoprotein DEFDS_0668 contains a rhodanese (thiosulphate sulphurtransferase) domain as well as the Sud protein, although there is no homology between the two proteins. Thus, these two proteins may facilitate sulphur respiration in D. desulfuricans as a polysulphide-specific porin in the outer membrane and a polysulphide-binding protein in the periplasmic space, respectively. This locus is adjacent to other genes related to respiration, two multihaem c-type cytochromes (DEFDS_0665-66) and a cytochrome bc complex (DEFDS_0674-77). Interestingly, a similar locus without the Psr/Phs genes was found in the genomes of the iron- and sulphur-reducing bacteria, Geobacter spp. and Desulfuromonas acetoxidans DSM 684 (Supplementary Fig. S1B).The D. desulfuricans genome has a gene cluster (DEFDS_0741-60) that includes many genes encoding membrane-bound or periplasmic multihaem c-type cytochromes, which are potentially distributed in the inner or outer membranes or in the periplasmic space (Supplementary Fig. S2A). As demonstrated in G. sulfurreducens and Shewanella oneidensis, multihaem c-type cytochromes may be involved in the potential dissimilatory reduction of metal ions.51 Although D. desulfuricans SSM1 cannot grow by iron reduction, the capability of iron reduction is a symbolic physiological trait of the genus Deferribacter.3–5 On the basis of cultivation-dependent estimations, the members of the genus Deferribacter have been predicted to be the most numerically abundant iron-reducing prokaryotes in deep-sea vents.7,8,52 Therefore, the multihaem c-type cytochromes in D. desulfuricans may be a remnant of the metal reduction system.As shown in Fig. 4, reductants produced from the oxidation of organic compounds would be oxidized by a proton-pumping NADH dehydrogenase (Nuo: DEFDS_1972-85) and succinate dehydrogenase (Sdh: DEFDS_0685-88) to provide reducing equivalents for the nitrate- and polysulphide reductions. The D. desulfuricans genome has an alternative complex for NADH oxidation, sodium-translocating NADH:quinone oxidoreductase (Nqr: DEFDS_1913-18). This complex possibly allows the generation of a sodium gradient, which could energize an Na+-dependent symporter of the organic substrates. This organism found to possess many sodium gradient-dependent symporters such as two solute:sodium symporters (SSS family), a nucleobase:cation symporter-2 (NCS2) family protein (DEFDS_1105), an alanine or glycine:cation symporter (AGCS) family protein (DEFDS_1601), and phosphate:sodium symporter (PNaS) family protein (DEFDS_0081).3.5. Signal transduction, motility, and chemotaxisDeferribacter desulfuricans SSM1 and its relatives inhabit the ever-changing steep physical and chemical gradients of hydrothermal vent chimney. The thermophilic microorganisms living on hydrothermal vents are generally sensing temperature or chemical stimuli to guide their directional movements by swimming with a whip-like flagellum. Thus, the D. desulfuricans genome should have the molecular machinery for sensing and responding to environmental changes. Indeed, D. desulfuricans has genes for various signalling systems, as other vent chemolithotrophs do9–11 (Table 2). More than 70 genes for two-component signal transduction (TCS) systems, including 23 histidine kinases, 41 response regulator genes, and 13 hybrid histidine kinases with regulator domains, were found in the D. desulfuricans genome. The frequency of TCS systems found in the D. desulfuricans genome is the highest (34 genes per megabase) among vent bacteria (ranging from 11 to 22 genes per megabase). Although most of them could not be functionally assigned due to very low homologies with well-defined systems, some functions were assumed to be phosphate regulation (PhoBR) and ammonium assimilation (NtrBC). Abundance of genetic components for signal transduction systems in the genomes of representative deep-sea vent chemolithotrophsSignal transduction proteins were identified by querying the predicted gene products to the Pfam and COG databases. Genes with significant matches (E-value of less than 1E-5) were assigned a product description and classified using a set of rules based on the domain architecture of the protein. The final results were manually verified.Abundance of genetic components for signal transduction systems in the genomes of representative deep-sea vent chemolithotrophsSignal transduction proteins were identified by querying the predicted gene products to the Pfam and COG databases. Genes with significant matches (E-value of less than 1E-5) were assigned a product description and classified using a set of rules based on the domain architecture of the protein. The final results were manually verified.As an alternative signalling system, the D. desulfuricans genome has many genes relevant to a cyclic diguanylate (c-diGMP) signalling system,53 although these were less abundant than in other deep-sea vent bacteria (Table 2). This system is characterized by either diguanylate cyclase (GGDEF domain) or phosphodiesterase (EAL and HD-GYP domains) activity and is relevant to biofilm formation, motility, and virulence.53 In addition, at least one PAS domain was found in seven histidine kinase proteins and two c-diGMP signalling proteins as additional input modules. PAS domains are known to sense changes in the redox conditions inside or outside cells.54 It is worthy to note that the D. desulfuricans genome has a higher proportion of intracellular signalling systems than those of other deep-sea vent chemolithotrophs (Supplementary Fig. S3). These sensors may be essential for the versatile energy acquisition, carbon metabolisms, and the chemotaxis and redoxtaxis of D. desulfuricans SSM1 that are necessary under highly variable environmental conditions.This genome encodes a large number of methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (14 MCPs) as observed in other deep-sea vent bacteria (5–14 MCPs), except for the immotile Sulfurovum sp. NBC37-1 (Table 2). These chemotaxis-specific receptors would, in part, contribute to the versatile sensing capabilities of D. desulfuricans. The MCP encoded by DEFDS_1855 possesses a Cache (Ca2+ channels and chemotaxis receptors) domain that is involved in the binding of amino acids and carbohydrates in the MCP of Bacillus subtilis.55 It is also notable that multiple che clusters (six clusters of che-1 to che-6) were identified in the genome of D. desulfuricans, whereas most deep-sea vent microorganisms usually have one or two che gene clusters (Table 2 and Fig. 5). The che-2 cluster is associated with genes for flagellar biosynthesis, suggesting that flagellar formation and motility may be linked with the chemotaxis pathway. Deferribacter desulfuricans SSM1 has almost all of the genes necessary for the flagellar apparatus although motility has not yet been observed in this strain.2 On the other hand, since motility has been confirmed in several strains of D. desulfuricans recently isolated by us, flagellar-based motility could be an intrinsic genetic potential in D. desulfuricans. Moreover, all che clusters, except for che-4, contain genes that encode a fusion protein (CheA/Y) consisting of histidine kinase (CheA) and response regulator (CheY) domains. In other bacteria, the gene clusters containing cheA/Y are involved in specific functions other than chemotaxis. For instances, the Pseudomonas aeruginosa Wsp cluster is involved in biofilm formation,56 and the Myxococcus xanthus Frz cluster functionally controls type IV pili-based motility for cellular aggregation.57 Also, the gene cluster 3 of Rhodospirillum centenum is involved in cyst cell development.58 As shown in Fig. 5, the che-3 and che-5 gene clusters of D. desulfuricans, in particular, have a similar gene organization to each other. There are significant homologies (more than 22% identity at the level of amino acid sequences) between CheA/Y proteins in D. desulfuricans and other organisms. Thus, various D. desulfuricans chemotaxis-like systems may be responsible not only for chemotaxis but also for other cellular functions involved in cell–cell interactions. In fact, this genome contains several gene clusters potentially involved in the formation of a type IV pilus that plays a role in the adhesion of bacteria to host cells and solid surfaces, and mediates bacterial twitching motility. Some genes encoding pilus-related proteins such as PilA of the major prepilin (DEFDS_1243), PilB of the assembly ATPase (DEFDS_1109 and DEFDS_1256), PilQ of secretin (DEFDS_1255), and PilD of prepilin peptidase (DEFDS_0112) were detected. Considering the presence of these genes, it is possible to propose a lifestyle of clinging to the chimney surface for survival under a constantly variable environment.59Gene arrangement of the representative chemotaxis-like gene clusters in the genomes of D. desulfuricans and related bacteria. Six chemotaxis-like gene clusters (che-1 to che-6) identified in the D. desulfuricans genome are compared with those CheA/Y-containing clusters that have been experimentally verified: M. xanthus Frz,57P. aeruginosa Wsp,56R. centenum Cluster 3,58 and Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 Tax2.68Gene arrangement of the representative chemotaxis-like gene clusters in the genomes of D. desulfuricans and related bacteria.

PCC 6803 Tax2.683.6. Adaptation to thermal environmentAs in other thermophilic microbes, the proteome of D. desulfuricans, which can grow up to 70°C should be stable at least at the maximum growth temperature. Generally, it is known that a protein's amino acid composition has a great influence on its thermostability, and the proteins of thermophiles show a tendency to possess fewer non-charged amino acids and more charged amino acids than those of mesophiles.60 Actually, all of the proteins encoded in the D. desulfuricans genome were found to have fewer histidine, glutamine, and threonine residues, but more glutamic acid and lysine residues than mesophiles (Supplementary Fig. S4). Both charged amino acids presumably contribute to increase the thermostability of the protein by enhancing the occurrence of salt bridges and ion pairs.61Also, the stabilization of DNA and RNA at a high temperature is indispensable for survival in the hydrothermal environment. It has been suggested that polyamines, RNA methyltransferases, and protamine P1 could contribute to the thermoadaptation of Geobacillus kaustophilus, which has a similar maximum temperature for growth (74°C) as D. desulfuricans.62 In Thermus thermophilus, which can grow up to 85°C, the inactivation of genes for polyamine biosynthesis or tRNA (adenine-N1)-methyltransferase (TrmI) results in a thermolabile phenotype.63 The D. desulfuricans genome encodes genes necessary for putrescine and spermidine synthesis, speA (DEFDS_1288) and speBDE (DEFDS_0967-9). In addition, we identified two genes for norspermidine synthesis—carboxynorspermidine dehydrogenase (DEFDS_1287) and carboxynorspermidine decarboxylase (DEFDS_1286). Norspermidine and norspermine are commonly found in hyperthermophilic bacteria.64 These polyamines stabilize DNA by binding to nucleic acids and can induce aggregation or conformational changes of DNA.65 On the other hand, a homolog (DEFDS_0605) of TrmI found in T. thermophilus, and four tRNA and three tRNA/rRNA methyltransferase genes in total were identified in D. desulfuricans. The genes described above appear to contribute to the thermoadaptation of D. desulfuricans as well as other thermophilic bacteria.Deferribacter desulfuricans possesses many molecular chaperons used for protein folding and unfolding such as DnaJ-DnaK-GrpE (DEFDS_2113-4) and the HrcA repressor (DEFDS_2113-6), GroEL-GroES (DEFDS_0240-39), and small heat shock proteins categorized into Hsp20 family (DEFDS_1576 and DEFDS_1707). This organism also possesses ATP-dependent heat shock-responsive proteases, which is thought to be concerned in providing thermotolerance to cell on exposure to heat stress, such as HslVU (DEFDS_2155-6), ClpPX (DEFDS_0193-4), and Lon (DEFDS_0195 and DEFDS_1706).3.7. Antioxidant systemDeferribacter desulfuricans SSM1 is a strict anaerobe: its genome possesses many genes potentially associated with resistance to oxidative stress. DEFDS_1019 and DEFDS_0573 encode a superoxide reductase (SOR) and a rubredoxin (Rd), respectively. The SOR–Rd proteins can catalyse the reduction of superoxide to hydrogen peroxide. Putative rubrerythrins (Rbr) encoded by DEFDS_0019, DEFDS_1568, and DEFDS_1971 further reduce hydrogen peroxide to water.66 DEFDS_1568 is located adjacent to the gene encoding the peroxide repressor (perR) (DEFDS_1567). A series of these genes presumably construct the antioxidant system of D. desulfuricans SSM1 inhabiting the oxic–anoxic transition zone in the deep-sea hydrothermal environment. Additionally, genes for peroxiredoxins (DEFDS_0018 and DEFDS_1350), thioredoxin (DEFDS_1167), and thioredoxin reductase (DEFDS_0503) may be involved in the antioxidant system.On the other hand, D. desulfuricans possesses genes encoding two potential dioxygen scavenging systems. The first one is a cytochrome bd quinol oxidase (DEFDS_1619-1620), which is a respiratory terminal oxidase, and the second one is a rubredoxin-oxygen oxidoreductase (Roo), whose gene is located next to the rubredoxin gene (DEFDS_0573). In the sulphate-reducing Desulfovibrio-related species, the latter enzyme is proposed to be the cytoplasmic terminal oxidase for the non-energy-conserving respiratory reduction of O2 or nitric oxide.67 Thus, the bd-type oxidase and Roo of D. desulfuricans may also serve to relieve the environmental and intracellular oxidative stresses.3.8. ConclusionsGenome analysis of D. desulfuricans SSM1 revealed its versatile energy and carbon metabolisms and its machineries for sensing and responding to the environmental changes in hydrothermal vent habitats. We showed that the molecular systems such as the multihaem c-type cytochrome clusters, two-component signal transducers, and abundant chemotaxis components could be tightly linked to the adaptation mechanisms required to adapt in physically and chemically variable environments. The multiple signal transduction systems for sensing dynamic changes in carbon source and temperature, and the type IV pili, which are likely to be useful for clinging to the chimney, allow D. desulfuricans to survive in such a harsh environment. The genome sequence of D. desulfuricans SSM1 should provide many clues for the better understanding of bacterial life in environments around hydrothermal vents from the ecological and evolutionary points of view. The sequences, as well as the gene information shown in this paper, are available in the web databases, ExtremoBase (http://www.jamstec.go.jp/gbrowser/cgi-bin/top.cgi) and DOGAN (http://www.bio.nite.g.o.jp/dogan/Top).Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.Supplementary data"

IntroductionMitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) cascade plays an important role in plant growth and development, transferring the extracellular stimuli into intracellular response. MAPK cascades are evolutionarily conserved signalling modules in eukaryotes including animals, yeasts and plants.1,2 MAPK cascades are composed of three protein kinases: MAPKs, MAPK Kinases (MAPKKs/MKKs) and MAPKK Kinases (MAPKKKs/MEKKs). MAPKs are activated when both tyrosine and threonine residues in the TXY motif are phosphorylated by MAPKKs. MAPKKs are activated when serine and serine/threonine residues in the S/TXXXXXS/T motif are phosphorylated by MAPKKKs.3By sequence comparison and signature motif searches, putative orthologue of MAPK cascade members have been identified in rice, Medicago sativa, Zea mays, tobacco and tomato. Southern blot analysis have also revealed that genomes of monocotyledonous plants such as rice and maize possesses sequences that are homologous to the NPKl gene (MAPKKK related gene in tobacco), an indication that NPKl-related genes are present in a number of plant species.4 During the past decade, incredible progress has been made towards the functional understanding of all genes in the model dicot Arabidopsis. In the sequenced Arabidopsis genome, 20 MAPKs, 10 MAPKKs and 80 MAPKKKs were identified.5,6 However, little is known about the MAPK gene family and their function and regulation in rice (Oryza sativa) and other economically important cereal crops.7 After the completion rice genome project 16 MAPKs and 8 MAPKKs are reported in rice.8 However, reports on the presence of MAPKKKs in rice have been very slow and so far a total of only five MAPKKKs have been reported. MAPKKK, which gets activated by upstream signals, forms a very important component of MAPK cascade. In plants the roles MAPKKK has been identified in various stresses,9,10 plant cytokinesis,11,12 ethylene signalling,13 innate immunity14 and defence responses,15,16,17 among many others.However, the poor information about MAPKKK gene family in rice is proving to be bottleneck in elucidating MAPK cascade in this very important monocot crop. In the present study, an in silico search of rice genome databases was conducted to identify members of the rice MAPKKK gene family. A total of 75 genes were identified and among which 70 were novel. A phylogenetic tree was constructed and MAPKKKs were grouped into three different subfamilies. Conserved consensus motifs were analysed in all the subfamilies to support their association. To further validate the findings, expression analysis of all the 75 MAPKKKs in different stresses and tissue-specific libraries were carried out using MPSS database.2. Materials and methods2.1. Sequence and database search for OsMAPKKKsIn an attempt to obtain all the MAPKKKs, rice protein sequences available in Rice Genome Annotation Project (ftp://ftp.plantbiology.msu.edu/pub/data/Eukaryotic_Projects/ O_sativa/annotation_dbs/pseudomolecules/version_6.0) were downloaded to construct a local protein database. It comprised of 67393 sequences. This database was searched with MAPKKK query sequences downloaded from NCBI (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), TAIR (arabidopsis.org), Royal Holloway University of London (www.rhul.ac.uk./Biological-Sciences/AcademicStaff/Bogre/mapkkk.htm), MIPS (mips.gsf.de), Uniprot (uniprot.org), BrassicaDB (brassica.bbsrc.ac.uk/BrassicaDB), MPSS (mpss.udel.edu/rice) and Maizegdb (maizegdb.org). The query consisted of 100 sequences from 13 different plant species which included Arabidopsis thaliana, Brassica napus, Cucumis melo, Cucumis sativus, Lotus japonicus, Lycopersicon esculentum, M. sativa, Nicotiana tabacum, O. sativa, Solanum chacoense, Triticum aestivum, Vitis vinifera and Z. mays. The search was carried out using BLASTP and 50% identity was taken as the threshold for the sequences obtained from BLAST analysis. Further all the MAPKKK sequences were aligned using CLUSTAL 2.0.3 (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/) multiple sequence alignment and used to construct HMM profile. Using HMMER 2.3.2 (ftp://ftp.genetics.wustl.edu/pub/eddy/hmmer), the local protein database was searched on the basis of the HMM profile. HMMER and BLAST hits were compared and parsed by manual editing as well as using small PERL scripts. In addition self BLAST of the sequences was carried out to remove the redundancy and then they were analysed for the presence of domains. Subcellular localization prediction of each of the rice MAPKK kinases was carried out using the CELLO v2.5 server (http://cello.life.nctu.edu.tw/).2.2. Phylogenetic tree constructionThe Kinase domain of all the sequences (including both query and hits obtained) were analysed using ScanProsite program from Expasy server (au.expasy.org/prosite/). All the kinase domains were aligned using ClustalW. To investigate the evolutionary relationship among MAPKKK proteins, a phylogenetic tree was constructed by employing the minimal evolution (ME) method and the neighbour-joining (NJ) method wrapped in MEGA4 software suite.2.3. Multiple alignment and conserved signature detectionMultiple sequence alignments of related proteins belonging to each group from both Arabidopsis and rice were performed using Multalin, which creates a multiple sequence alignment from a group of related sequences using progressive pairwise alignments (http://bioinfo.genotoul.fr/multalin/multalin). Programs INTERPROSCAN, SMART and MOTIF SCAN were employed to detect conserved domains.2.4. Analysis of MPSS database for expression profilesTo gain insight into expression profiles of OsMAPKKK members in O. sativa in different stress and tissues, the MPSS database (http://mpss.udel.edu/rice/) was searched (opting 20-nt signature sequences) using the locus ID given in the TIGR database. The data thus obtained have been analysed and grouped based on stress and tissue specificity.3. Results and discussion3.1. In silico search and identification of novel MAPKKK genesAvailability of complete rice genome sequences18 has made it possible for the first time to identify all the MAPKKK family members in this plant species. In order to identify the MAPKKK genes, 100 query sequences of MAPKKKs from different plant species were analysed by BLASTP against 67393 sequences of the local protein database of rice from RGP, which resulted in 122 hits as subject sequences. These hits were passed through several layers of filters which primarily included 50% identity with the query sequence which further reduced to 107 hits as subject sequences. This list included all the five MAPKKKs from rice, which were already reported in NCBI and MPSS database. Simultaneously an HMM profile (HMMER version 2.3.2) was created with the 100 query sequences and a profile search was carried out against the local rice proteome database which resulted in 1574 hits. After the comparison of the sequences obtained from BLAST hits and HMM searches, the number of MAPKKKs was further reduced to 102. A self BLAST of these sequences followed by manual editing to remove the redundancy finally resulted in identification of 75 MAPKKK genes. This analysis has revealed that the O. sativa genome has 75 putative MAPKKK genes including five already known MAPKKKs. However, in Arabidopsis 80 putative MAPKKKs were predicted.6 Most of the MAPKKKs existence was supported by EST hits and full-length cDNA sequences from KOME or GenBank database (Table 1) except in 14 MAPKKKs where no such data were available. It indicates either all 14 are not expressed in all the conditions used for analysis or that they are expressed in very low quantity, which cannot be detected. Expression of other members was found in either of the two conditions mentioned above. MPSS database measures the absolute expression level of most genes in the sample and provide information about potentially novel transcripts.19 Out of the 14 MAPKKKs which were not reported in EST or cDNA database, eight of them were represented in MPSS database with their expression levels in different tissues and stresses and in the remaining six MAPKKKs, five were without any expression in the tested conditions additionally OsMAPKKK53 was not represented in MPSS database. Since there was no standard nomenclature followed for MAPKKKs neither in Arabidopsis nor in rice, we named the MAPKKKs sequentially based on the HMM search output. All the 75 MAPKKKs were having conserved protein kinase domain which is backbone for MAPK family. The predicted protein localization of most of the MAPKKKs varied from cytoplasm, mitochondria, chloroplast to nucleus except in MAPKKK33 and MAPKKK47 where it was present in cytoskeleton and peroxisomes, respectively.

Phylogenetic analysis of MAPKKKSThe family of MAPKKKs forms the largest group of MAPK pathway components. Arabidopsis contains 80 MAPKKKs,6 which can be subdivided into three major subtypes, Raf, MEKK and ZIK.20 Among these two groups, MEKK group is most similar to animal MEKKs and yeast MAPKKKs. In total, it consists of 21 MEKK-like and 11 ZIK kinases along with Arabidopsis ANP1-3 (Arabidopsis NPK1-like protein kinases). The other group consists of 48 genes encoding Raf-like protein kinases including Arabidopsis CTR1 and EDR1.6 To further characterize the MAPKKKs from rice and to evaluate the phylogenetic relationships with Arabidopsis MAPKKKs, the kinase domains of rice and Arabidopsis were aligned using ClustalW and analysed using MEGA4. Phylogenetic tree was constructed by employing the NJ method (Fig. 1) and ME method have shown similar topologies, with only minor modifications at deep nodes. On the basis of phylogenetic analysis, MAPKKKs in rice were classified in to three categories, which include Raf, ZIK and MEKK subfamilies. There were 43 MAPKKKs from rice and 48 from Arabidopsis grouped under Raf subfamily, 22 MAPKKKs from rice and 21 from Arabidopsis were grouped in to MEKK subfamily where as only 10 MAPKKKs from rice and 11 from Arabidopsis were grouped under ZIK family. As the results indicate, rice and Arabidopsis show similarity in the number of MAPKKKs in each subgroup.Phylogenetic tree and domain organization of MAPKKKs from rice and Arabidopsis. Kinase domains of putative MAPKKKs from Arabidopsis and rice were aligned using CLUSTALW program. The NJ phylogenetic tree was created using MEGA4 software suite. Bootstrap value above 50% was shown. The domain organization was depicted on the right, gaps in lines were introduced while depicting the protein sequences of bigger size for convenience. Scanning of the protein sequences for the presence of known motifs and domains was performed using PlantsP.

To identify the species of origin for each MAPKKK, a species acronym is included before the protein name: At, Arabidopsis thaliana; Os, Oryza sativa.Domain architecture of MAPKKKs from Arabidopsis and rice revealed that most of the Raf family proteins have a C-terminal kinase domain and a long N-terminal regulatory domain. In contrast, majority of the ZIK family members have N-terminal kinase domain whereas members of MEKK family has less conserved protein structure with kinase domain located either at N- or C-terminal or central part of the protein. Bipartite NLS and transmembrane regions are distributed across the members of all the subfamilies whereas extensin like region is observed in Raf and MEKK members. Ubiquitin-interaction motif and ACT domain which is known to play a role in the regulation of a wide range of metabolic enzymes by responding to amino acid concentration are present only in the members of Raf family from rice and Arabidopsis (Fig. 1).Extrapolating the phylogenetic tree shown in Fig. 1 along with 14 additional sequences from 11 different plants revealed that most of the known MAPKKK from other plants are grouped with MEKK subfamily (Supplementary Fig. S1). Comparing MPK and MKK gene families in rice, Arabidopsis and Populus genomes it was reported that the recent duplication events in amplifying the respective gene families are more evident in eudicots compared with monocot rice.8 We also observed comparing the MAPKKK gene family between rice and Arabidopsis that the eudicot has undergone more recent duplication events, more so in the Raf subfamily (Supplementary Fig. 1).In silico localization of MAPKKKs on chromosomes indicated that all the 75 MAPKKKs are distributed on all 12 chromosomes of rice and half of them were present in first three chromosomes, which include chromosome 1, 2 and 3. Among all, chromosomes 8 and 11 were sharing only two MAPKKKs each, whereas chromosome 2 was having as many as 13 MAPKKKs (Fig. 2). Although similar analysis for other two components of MAPK cascade namely, MAPKK/MKK and MAPK/MPK revealed that eight MKKs are present in four chromosomes and 16 MPKs are distributed on seven chromosomes.Graphical (scaled) representation of location of MAPK, MAPKK and MAPKKK genes on rice chromosomes.Graphical (scaled) representation of location of MAPK, MAPKK and MAPKKK genes on rice chromosomes.3.3. Analysis of conserved motifs among MAPKKKsThe pattern of amino acid residues found in many subdomains is conserved among the family members. All the rice MAPKKKs that were grouped under Raf, ZIK and MEKK subfamilies were further analysed for the presence of specific signatures. Raf subfamily consists of the largest number of MAPKKKs in both Arabidopsis and rice. Experimental data from Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans have provided much evidence that the Rafs sensu stricto stimulate MAP2K and MAPK activation.21 Human Rafs are involved in a signalling network that controls cell proliferation, cell differentiation and apoptosis. Many of their effects are transmitted through the ERK/MAPK pathway.22,23Raf family has a conserved signature in its kinase domain across the members. Analysis of the rice MAPKKKs along with the Arabidopsis for Raf specific signature GTXX (W/Y) MAPE was carried out by multiple alignments of kinase domains. The data revealed the presence of signature in all the members of Raf family in rice (Fig. 3) and strongly supported their identity as members of Raf subfamily. Around 43 MAPKKKs were grouped under Raf subfamily in rice where as in Arabidopsis this number is higher and consists of 48 members. The kinase domain of human B-Raf is a strong activator of MEK and has a high affinity for MEK.24,25 In Arabidopsis, members of Raf subfamily CTR1 and EDR1 act as negative regulators in ethylene signalling13 and in response to powdery mildew attack,26 respectively. Further CTR1 has been found to interact with the histidine kinase domain of ETR1 and the ethylene response sensor (ERS1) in vitro.27Alignment of MAPKKKs of Raf subfamily from rice and Arabidopsis.

The highlighted part shows the conserved signature motif.The ZIK subfamily consists of 10 putative MAPKKKs in rice and 11 in Arabidopsis. Recently, the Arabidopsis ZIK protein WNK1 (At3g04910) was demonstrated to phosphorylate a protein involved in the control of circadian rhythms,28 suggesting a function different from that of other MAPKKKs. The characteristic feature of this family consists of a conserved signature GTPEFMAPE (L/V/M) (Y/F/L) across the members. Rice putative MAPKKKs were analysed for the presence of the above signature, which reassured that 10 MAPKKKs out of 75 have ZIK specific signatures (Fig. 4) and eventually grouped under this family.Alignment of MAPKKKs of ZIK subfamily from rice and Arabidopsis.

NPK1 gene from tobacco whose role in cytokinesis have been established,11,29 ScFRK2, a MAPKKK from S. chacoense involved in fertilization and embryogenesis,30OMTK1, MAPKKK from M. sativa which channels oxidative stress signalling31 were some of the members of MEKK subfamily. Further ANP1 in Arabidopsis was found responsive to oxidative stress and is involved in negative regulation of auxin signal transduction pathway.32,33 It was also reported that Arabidopsis ANP1, ANP2, ANP3 are involved in plant cytokinesis11,34 and MAPKKKa in relation to defence response.15 Role of YODA a MAPKKK from Arabidopsis was characterized in stomatal development35 with its targeting downstream MAPKKs.36 Another member of this family MEKK1 functions in integrating ROS homeostasis with plant development and hormone signalling.37,38 Twenty-two MAPKKKs from rice and 21 from Arabidopsis belong to this subfamily. Relationship analysis based on the amino acid sequences of the protein kinase catalytic domain shows that the sequence, G (T/S) PX (F/Y/W) MAPEV forms a conserved signature of this family (Fig. 5). Presence of this signature in 18 putative rice MAPKKKs further confirmed their association with MEKK family. Moreover analysis of the transcript abundance of MAPKKK subfamilies from rice in different tissue and stress specific libraries revealed that they are differentially expressed and regulated.Alignment of MAPKKKs of MEKK subfamily from rice and Arabidopsis.

In silico analysis of expression of MAPKKKs based on MPSS databaseMPSS is a valuable tool to have an insight into gene expression.39 It has been used previously for genome-level expression analysis in several systems including Arabidopsis.40 To extract information about the relative abundance of transcripts of O. sativa MAPKKK members, we have carried out the analysis in the available MPSS database (http://mpss.udel.edu/rice/). This database is derived from the TIGR O. sativa genome sequence and the search has been performed employing the 20 nucleotides long signatures in tissue-specific and stress-related libraries. Our analysis has revealed that among the different tissue-specific libraries, maximum numbers of MAPKKKs were expressed and their transcript abundance was found in crown vegetative meristematic tissue (NME), ovary and mature stigma (NOS) tissue libraries. Libraries of salinity and cold stress in rice roots have shown maximum transcript abundance of OsMAPKKK64 which is a member of ZIK subfamily (Fig. 6) and with drought stress elevated transcripts of OsMAPKKK28 was observed (Fig. 7). OsMAPKKK28 is a member of MEKK subfamily and an orthologue of AtMEKK1 from Arabidopsis. Similarly in leaves highest Transcripts Per Million (TPM) of OsMAPKKK4 a member of Raf subfamily in salinity stress (Fig. 8), OsMAPKKK63 in cold, OsMAPKKK8 in drought, all members of MEKK subfamily, were observed. This suggested the involvement of MAPKKK members from all the subfamilies and more precisely MEKK subfamily in the regulation of abiotic stress. These observations further strengthen their prediction and the differential regulation in various stress conditions suggests their active participation in stress signalling.Transcript abundance of MAPKKK members of ZIK subfamily in salinity, drought, cold and tissue-specific libraries from MPSS database along with their dendrogram.

ConclusionThe present study has provided the full list of MAPKKKs present in rice for the first time. In silico search of various rice protein databases using BLASTP and HMM profile resulted in identification of 75 MAPKKK genes from rice among these 70 were novel. EST hits and full-length cDNA sequences (from KOME or Genbank database) of 75 MAPKKKs supported their existence. Phylogenetic analysis of MAPKKKs from rice and Arabidopsis has classified them in to three subgroups that include Raf, ZIK and MEKK. Conserved motifs in the deduced amino acid sequences of rice MAPKKKs strongly supported their identity as members of Raf, ZIK and MEKK subfamilies. Expression analysis of the MAPKKKs in MPSS database revealed that maximum number of MAPKKK transcripts was represented in crown vegetative meristematic tissue (NME), ovary and mature stigma (NOS) tissue libraries. Libraries of salinity and cold stress in rice roots have shown maximum transcript abundance of OsMAPKKK64 which is a member of ZIK subfamily and with drought stress elevated transcripts of OsMAPKKK28 was observed. Similarly in leaves highest TPM of OsMAPKKK4 a member of Raf subfamily in salinity stress, OsMAPKKK63 in cold, OsMAPKKK8 in drought, which are members of MEKK subfamily were observed. The information generated will be very significant for further investigating the regulation mechanism of MAPKKKs and eventually MAPK cascade in response to extracellular stimuli and their central roles in various biological functions. Additionally, the information generated will serve the purpose in elucidating still very poorly characterized MAP kinase cascade in plants in general and in rice in particular.Supplementary DataSupplementary Data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThe work is financially supported by the core grant of National Institute of Plant Genome Research, New Delhi, India.K.P.R. and K.K. acknowledge the fellowship provided by University Grant Commission, India, while B.R. thanks Department of Biotechnology, India for fellowship.Supplementary data"

IntroductionComparative genomics at the sequence level has existed for ~20 years, since the time genome sequencing started in earnest. Already there have been many proposals to compare genomes. Boore and Brown1 used gene order to study the evolutionary relationships of metazoan mitochondrial genomes. Snel et al.2 later constructed the phylogenetic tree for completely sequenced prokaryotic genomes based on gene content. In Snel et al.'s method, the similarity between two genomes is defined as the number of genes that they have in common divided by their total number of genes. However, such techniques are time-consuming as they must first identify all the genes in one genome. These approaches, together with G + C content, edit distance, and reversal and rearrangement distances,3–5 compare genomes using only partial genomic information. Thus, these results are usually controversial because single-gene sequences generally do not contain enough information to construct an evolutionary history of organisms.In Koonin's editorial6 about the emerging paradigm and open problems in comparative genomics, he pointed out ‘… but within these superfamilies, there is nothing like a straight one-to-one correspondence between genomes, and in distant genomes, most of the members may not be orthologous’. This sentence enlightened us to get a novel idea of comparing genomes. We can construct a genome space. In this space, each point corresponds to a genome uniquely. The natural distance between two points in the genome space reflects the biological distance between these two genomes. Currently, there is no method to represent genomes by a point in a space without losing biological information.We introduce graphical representation of DNA sequence to construct the genome space. The graphical representation of DNA sequence provides a simple way of viewing, sorting, and comparing various gene structures. Thus, it is an attractive and promising research direction. The first important method in this direction is due to Hamori.7 He used a three-dimensional curve to represent a DNA sequence. Gates8 later constructed a two-dimensional graphical representation that is simpler than the Hamori curve. However, Gates' graphical representation has high degeneracy. Recently, we reported a new two-dimensional graphical representation of gene sequences9 which has no circuit or degeneracy, so that the correspondence between gene sequences and gene graphs is one-to-one. In this way, the original DNA sequence can be recovered from its graph mathematically without loss of biological information. In this paper, we make a minor modification of our previous method and obtain a new graphical representation approach for DNA sequences. The breakthrough of the subject is that we can construct the moment vectors from DNA sequences using this new graphical method, and we can prove that the correspondence between moment vectors and DNA sequences is one-to-one. The novelty and uniqueness of our approach is that by using these moment vectors of DNA sequences, we have constructed a genome space as a subspace in Euclidean space. Each genome sequence can be represented as a point in this space. Therefore, this genome space can be used to make comparative analysis to study the clustering and phylogenetic relationship among genomes. The biological (evolutionary) distance between two genomes can be obtained through the Euclidean distance among the corresponding points in the genome space.2. Materials and methods2.1. Graphical representation of DNA sequenceNucleotide vector system based on G(1, -2/3), A(1, -1/3), T(1, 1/3), and C(1, 2/3).Nucleotide vector system based on G(1, -2/3), A(1, -1/3), T(1, 1/3), and C(1, 2/3).Here, we should emphasize that the specific ordering of the four nucleotides in the Cartesian coordinate system is related to the GC content of genomes (as it is explained in the ‘Discussion’ section). Points in the graphical representation are obtained by the sum of vectors representing nucleotides in the sequence. In Fig. 2, we give the graphical representation of whole mitochondrial genome sequences of human, common chimpanzee, Norway rat, and hedgehog, which are based on the vector system shown in Fig. 1. Since human and chimpanzee belong to the same order (primates), their mitochondrial genome graphical representations are very similar visually. These four DNA sequence graphical curves have no circuits or degeneracy and the correspondence between the sequence and the graphical curve can be mathematically proved to be one-to-one.9Graphical representation of DNA sequences. Graphical representations of whole mitochondrial genome sequences of four species (human, common chimpanzee, Norway rat, and hedgehog) based on the vector system shown in Fig. 1. X-value stands for the number of nucleotides in the DNA sequence. Y-value is the cumulative y-values of nucleotides G, A, T, and C in Fig. 1. Because the genome lengths of these four species are similar (around 17 000 nt), the X-values of the end points of their graphical curves are very similar. For the Y-values of the end points, human and common chimpanzee are very close (more than 1600), but mouse is below 1500 and hedgehog is below 1000.Graphical representation of DNA sequences.

Moment vector of DNA sequenceThe crucial point in this paper is that the correspondence between a DNA sequence and its moment vector obtained from its sequence graph is one-to-one. To obtain this conclusion, we need to prove the following theorem.TheoremConsider the set of DNA sequences having the same number (n) of nucleotides. Then, the correspondence between a DNA sequence and its n-dimensional moment vector (M1, M2, … , Mn) is one-to-one.ProofWe have demonstrated that the correspondence between a DNA sequence and its graphical curve is one-to-one.9 In order to prove the theorem, we will need to prove that the correspondence between a DNA graphical curve and its moment vector is one-to-one.By the definition, one DNA sequence graph has an n-dimensional moment vector (M1, M2, … , Mn). Hence, we need to demonstrate that from any given DNA moment vector, we can recover the DNA curve, which means all (xi, yi) (i = 1, 2, … , n) can be recovered from any given DNA moment vector.Because the y-coordinate values of four nucleotides are between –1 and 1, xi - yi = 0. As we have defined that the position of kth nucleotide on a graph is (xk,yk) or (k,yk), the position of (k + 1)th nucleotide on a graph (xk+1, yk+1) can be represented as (k + 1, yk + uk+1), where uk+1 may be any of y-coordinate value of the four nucleotides. Thus, zk+1 = xk+1 - yk+1 = (k + 1) - (yk + uk+1) = (k - yk) + (1 - uk+1) =(k - yk). Because zk = xk - yk = k - yk, zk+1= zk. As a consequence, zi is increasing and each root can be identified by this property, which means each value of yi can be obtained. With all (xi,yi), a DNA graph can be recovered.Therefore, we have successfully proved that the correspondence between a DNA sequence and its moment vector obtained from its sequence graph is one-to-one.2.3. Construction of genome spaceWe have already obtained a good numerical characterization, moment vector, to represent a DNA sequence. Now, we will use this tool to construct a genome space. Here, we emphasize that the structure of genomes is complicated. It may be single-stranded or double-stranded and in a linear or circular structure. Thus, we should consider the different structures when constructing the genome space.For the simplest genome structures, linear single-strand forms, we can treat them as linear DNA sequences. That is, every genome corresponds to a general DNA sequence. Thus, we can utilize our moment vector to construct the genome space. In order to use whole genome information to make comparative analysis among genomes, we can use the first N components (M1, M2, … , MN) of the moment vector of a genome sequence graph to represent a genome as a point in N-dimensional space. Thus, we obtain an N-dimensional genome space as a subspace in RN. Using the Euclidean distance between two points as an index for comparison, we can perform phylogenetic and clustering analysis for genome sequences in this genome space.For the circular single-strand genomes, the construction of genome space is more complicated because we do not know which point is the start point in this circular DNA sequence. In this case, we treat every point as the start point in this circular sequence of length n, and then we get n linear single-strand genomes. For every linear single-strand genome sequence, we can compute its n-dimensional moment vector. Then, we take average by n for these n n-dimensional moment vectors to get a normalized moment vector (M1, M2, … , Mn). For circular single-strand genomes, we use the first N components (M1, M2, … , MN) of this normalized moment vector to represent a genome as a point in an N-dimensional space. Thus, we obtain an N-dimensional genome space as a subspace in RN.For the double-stranded genomes, we need to point out that the moment vector of reverse complementary sequence is not the same as the original sequence. Generally, when meeting the double-stranded genomes, we treat them as two single-stranded genomes. We use the above method (linear or circular) to get two n-dimensional moment vectors for these two single-stranded sequences, and then take average to get a general moment vector (M1, M2, … , Mn). By using the first N components (M1, M2, … , MN) of this general moment vector to represent a genome as a point in N-dimensional space. Thus, we obtain an N-dimensional genome space as a subspace in RN. Here, we need to point out that the two strands of some genomes (e.g. mitochondrial genomes, some bacterial genomes) are differentiated by their nucleotide content, which are called the heavy strand and the light strand, respectively. The two strands have different masses because one has a higher proportion of heavier nucleic acids and its complement a lower proportion. In this case, we just treat them as the single-stranded (by using the heavy strand) genomes to make the genome space.3. ResultsTo verify that the biological distance obtained in this way truly incorporates biological utility, we apply our new genome space to the phylogenetic analysis of organisms. Most existing methods for phylogenetic inference using biological sequences can be divided into two groups. The algorithms in the first group utilize various distance measures12–15 which are based on different models of nucleotide substitution or amino acid replacement, and then transform the distance matrix into a tree. In the second group of approaches, instead of building a tree, the tree that can best explain the observed sequences under the evolutionary assumption is found by evaluating of different topologies. This category includes parsimony16–18 and maximum likelihood methods.19–21 All these methods require a multiple alignment of the sequences and assume some sort of evolutionary model, which require human intervention. Thus, the results are usually controversial. However, our genome space does not need sequence alignment and any evolutionary model. It is totally automatically generated and avoids computation repetition.First, we consider the phylogeny of mammals. Mitochondrial DNA is not highly conserved and has a rapid mutation rate, thus it is very useful for studying the evolutionary relationships of organisms.22 We extracted 35 complete mammalian mitochondrial genome sequences from the GenBank, each of which has length of more than 16 000 nucleotides. Moreover, they have double-stranded and circular structures. As mentioned in the previous section, because we have already known the gene content of both strands of these genomes, we just treat them as the single-stranded (by using the heavy strand) circular genomes. For this case, we treat every point as the start point in this circular sequence of length n, and then we get n linear single-strand genomes. For every linear single-strand genome sequence, by using the nucleotide vector system shown in Fig. 1, we can compute its n-dimensional moment vector. Then, we take average by n for these n n-dimensional moment vectors to get a normalized moment vector (M1, M2, … , Mn). Here, we use the first 60 components of the moment vector (M1, M2, … , M60) to characterize these 35 genome graphical curves and obtained 35 points in 60-dimensional genome space. By computing the Euclidean distances between these points, we got the distance matrix for these 35 organisms. The phylogenetic tree for them shown in Fig. 3 is generated using UPGMA program in the MEGA 4 package.23 The last 10 mammals are grouped into a cluster because they are primates, and the phylogenetic relationship among them coincides with those found by Raina et al.24 We also found that Norway rat, vole, and squirrel are grouped into a cluster for the reason that they are rodent species.Phylogenetic tree of the mitochondrial genome sequences of 35 mammal species.

HIV is a lentivirus that can lead to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), a condition in humans in which the immune system begins to fail, leading to life-threatening opportunistic infections. To develop the anti-HIV drugs and vaccines, the research into the origins and evolution of this virus has become very important. Rambaut et al.25 reconstructed the phylogenetic tree of the primate lentiviruses including HIV-1, HIV-2, and the simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs). It was discovered that the two human viruses are related to different SIVs and therefore have different evolutionary origins. However, in Rambaut et al.'s paper, the tree was constructed using the maximum likelihood method on an alignment of the nucleotide sequences of polymerase gene in these lentiviruses. Generally, a single-gene sequence does not possess enough information to construct an evolutionary history of organisms, thus we use our new method to reconstruct the phylogenetic tree based on the whole genome sequences.The genomes of lentiviruses are single-stranded linear RNA. RNA has the base uracil (U) rather than thymine (T) that is present in DNA. In fact, these RNA genome sequences downloaded from GenBank have already been transformed into DNA sequences (change U by T). Thus, we treat them as linear DNA sequences. Using the nucleotide vector system shown in Fig. 1, the sequence graphs of the genomes of the 33 lentiviruses were obtained. Here, we use the first 12 components of the moment vector to characterize these 33 genome graphical curves, and thus we obtained 33 twelve-dimensional vectors. These 33 vectors can be viewed as 33 points in a 12-dimensional genome space. By computing the Euclidean distance between these points, we reconstructed the phylogenetic tree of these primate lentiviruses (Fig. 4) using UPGMA program in the MEGA 4 package.23 The figure illustrates that both the HIV-1 and HIV-2 lineages fall within that of the SIVs which are isolated from other primates, thus they represent the independent cross-species transmission events. In agreement with Rambaut et al.'s result, our phylogenetic tree shows that HIV-1 group N is a new HIV-1 type between the HIV-1 groups M and O (somewhat closer to the M group). It also indicates that HIV-1 groups M, N, and O are closely related to SIVs from chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes and Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) because there is a mixing of the HIV-1 and SIV lineages. Moreover, our result suggests that P. t. troglodytes (SIVcpz2 and SIVcpz3 in Fig. 4) is the primary reservoir for HIV-1 group O, which is not clear in Rambaut et al.'s evolutionary tree. In Rambaut et al.'s evolutionary tree, the position of HIV-1 group O is just between P. t. troglodytes and P. t. schweinfurthii, but not closer to either of them. Our suggestion coincides with those found by Gao et al.26 In Gao et al.'s work, the authors concluded that the HIV-1 group O is closely related to the just one of these SIVcpz lineages, found in P. t. troglodytes. For HIV-2, we find that the SIVs that are closely related to HIV-2 are not only SIVsm (sooty mangabey monkey) and SIVmac (macaque) as shown by Rambaut et al.'s tree, but also SIVsun (sun-tailed monkey).Evolutionary tree of the primate lentiviruses. This tree was reconstructed by using the first 12 components of the moment vector (M1, M2, … , M12). The subtypes of HIV-1 and HIV-2 are shown.

To study the classification and phylogeny of coronaviruses clearly, we apply our genome space to a large set of 30 complete coronavirus genomes from GenBank, including the two newly sequenced human coronaviruses, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1, along with four genomes from Flaviviridae and Togaviridae which are not coronaviruses (outgroups). The coronavirus genomes are also single-stranded linear RNA. So, similar to the above lentivirus case, we treat these coronavirus genomes as linear DNA sequences. Their abbreviation, accession number, description, and classification are shown in Table 1. First, we used our two-dimensional genome space (actually, it is a two-dimensional plane with the first two moments M1 and M2 being x-axis and y-axis) to characterize these ‘34’ virus genomes and calculated ‘34’ points in Fig. 5A. Four groups, group 1, group 2, group 3, and outgroups, can be seen in this figure as four distinct clusters. To study the classification for coronavirus clearly, we expanded it and obtained Fig. 5B. Thirty coronavirus genomes and four outgroup genomes from the GenBankThirty coronavirus genomes and four outgroup genomes from the GenBankTwo-dimensional genome space. (A) We used the first two components of the moment vector (M1, M2) to characterize 34 virus genomes from Table 1 and obtained 34 two-dimensional vectors. These 34 vectors can be directly viewed as 34 points in a two-dimensional genome space with M1 and M2 being x-axis and y-axis, respectively. (B) Thirty coronavirus genomes from Table 1 are viewed as 30 points in a two-dimensional genome space.Two-dimensional genome space. (A) We used the first two components of the moment vector (M1, M2) to characterize 34 virus genomes from Table 1 and obtained 34 two-dimensional vectors. These 34 vectors can be directly viewed as 34 points in a two-dimensional genome space with M1 and M2 being x-axis and y-axis, respectively. (B) Thirty coronavirus genomes from Table 1 are viewed as 30 points in a two-dimensional genome space.Based on genotypic and serological characterization, coronaviruses are divided into three distinct groups, with human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) being a group 1 coronavirus and human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) being a group 2 coronavirus. There is one additional branch, the group 3 coronaviruses, which are found exclusively in birds. These three distinct groups of coronaviruses clearly form three distinct clusters in our two-dimensional genome space. We also find that the newly discovered human coronavirus NL63 is very close to the human coronavirus 229E, and thus it is classified into group 1. This result is the same as the identification by van der Hoek et al.27 Our two-dimensional genome space reveals that for human SARS-CoV, the most closely related coronavirus is from a small infected mammal, the palm civet (not a bird as initially suspected). This result coincides with those found by Guan et al.28 and Wang et al.29 In Guan et al.'s work, the authors also suggested that SARS viruses were isolated from Himalayan palm civets found in a live-animal market in Guangdong, China. Similarly, in Wang et al.'s work, the researchers found six palm civets at the restaurant were positive for SARS-associated coronavirus. They think that SARS cases at the restaurant were the result of recent interspecies transfer from the putative palm civet reservoir and not the result of continued circulation of SARS-CoV in the human population.For another newly discovered human coronavirus HCoV-HKU1, Woo et al.30 classified it into group 2 because HCoV-HKU1 contains certain features that are characteristic of group 2 coronaviruses. However, these authors also stated that the proteins of HCoV-HKU1 formed distinct branches in the phylogenetic trees, indicating that HCoV-HKU1 is a distinct member within the group and is not very closely related to any other known member of group 2 coronaviruses. In our two-dimensional genome space, we found that HCoV-HKU1 is an individual coronavirus between the SARS group (which we suggest as group 4) and the traditional group 2, thus we propose that HCoV-HKU1 belongs to a new group 5. By computing the distances between the genomes in Fig. 5A, we also reconstructed the phylogenetic tree of these coronaviruses (Fig. 6) using UPGMA program in the MEGA 4 package.23 Thus, the evolutionary relationship of these genomes is clearer.Phylogenetic tree of the coronavirus genomes. This tree was reconstructed by the first two components of the moment vector (M1, M2).Phylogenetic tree of the coronavirus genomes. This tree was reconstructed by the first two components of the moment vector (M1, M2).4. DiscussionIt should be pointed out that the construction of our genome space depends on four parameters (the y-coordinates of the A, C, T, and G in Fig. 1). If we change these four parameters, we shall have different embedding of the genome space. Because the GC content of DNA molecule is found to be variable with different organisms, GC content should be considered when we assign the y-coordinate values of nucleotide vectors. The genomes of three groups in this paper have low GC content. Most of them have 30–50% GC content, thus we assign larger y-coordinate absolute values for G and C. However, the y-coordinate values of the four nucleotides must be between -1 and 1 to assure that the correspondence between a DNA sequence and its corresponding moment vector is one-to-one. Therefore, in order to obtain a universal genome space for all species, further studies will be needed to determine the universal y-coordinate values.In the study of mammalian mitochondrion, lentiviruses (including HIV), and coronavirus genomes, we used 60, 12, and 2 moments to construct the genome space, respectively. Here, we should emphasize that we do not need to calculate all the moments to determine the biological information of genomes. Remember that in the central limit theorem in probability and statistics, the limiting process is Gaussian. For Gaussian, the first two moments determine the density function. Thus, we just use the first N moments to get the results, where N is much less than n (the length of genome). Thus, for coronavirus genomes, we only used the first two components of the moment vector (M1, M2) because these two moments have allowed us to obtain the stable classified result—when higher moments are included the relationship of being close or farther away remains unchanged. To make this point clearer, we also use the first 20 components of the moment vector (M1, M2, … , M20) to construct the 20-dimmensional genome space. By computing the Euclidean distances between these points in this genome space, we reconstructed the phylogenetic tree of these coronaviruses (Fig. 7). Comparing Figs 6 and 7, we found that the classification relationship of these genomes are the same—group 1, group 2, group 3, group 4, group 5, and outgroups can still be seen in the two trees as six distinct clusters. This means that when using the higher moments, the relationship of being close or farther away remains unchanged. In other word, two moments are already enough to give the right classifying relationship for these genomes. For the same reason, we used the first 60 components of the moment vector (M1, M2, … , M60) and the first 12 components of the moment vector (M1, M2, … , M12) to generate the genome space for mammalian mitochondrion and lentiviruses genomes and obtained the stable phylogenetic analysis result.Phylogenetic tree of the coronavirus genomes. This tree was reconstructed by the first 20 components of the moment vector (M1, M2, … , M20).Phylogenetic tree of the coronavirus genomes. This tree was reconstructed by the first 20 components of the moment vector (M1, M2, … , M20).Gene rearrangements play important roles in evolution. The order of genes and transcription regions are changed during evolution by gene rearrangements such as DNA inversions and transpositions,31 which do not affect the gene content of the chromosomes. For example, inversions of large genomic fragments are often observed even between closely related species. The phylogenetic analysis based on the gene order is challenging as it requires detailed complex gene order data in genomes and intensive computation. In order to test whether our genome space is stable for genomic rearrangement, we consider the following simulated experiment. We choose the human mitochondrion genome and then invert its two genes ATPase 6 and Cytochrome oxidase III to get a simulated genome, which we called human AC genome. We can treat this new genome as the result of the inversion of genes from the human mitochondrion genome. Next, we randomly generate a genome sequence which has the same length and nucleotide content as the human mitochondrion genome, which we called random genome. Thus, we have three genomes of the same length and nucleotide content: human, human AC, and random. In addition, we also choose the common chimpanzee mitochondrion genome as comparison. By using the 60-dimmensional genome space, we calculate the distance among these four genomes and get a distance matrix in Table 2. In Table 2, we found that the distance between human and human AC is very small. This means that even some genomic rearrangement happened in a genome, the new produced genome still has very close distance from the original genome. Thus, in our genome space, the original genome and its genomic rearrangement genome represent different points but have very close distance. Large-scale genomic rearrangements in closely related organisms make the genome sequences very different from the original genome sequences. Although the moment vectors of the original and rearranged DNA sequences are different, if we treat double DNA genomes as two single-stranded genomes to get two n-dimensional moment vectors for these two single-stranded sequences and take the average to get a general moment vector (M1, M2, … , Mn), the computed distances among related species by gene rearrangements will be small. The genome spaces constructed by the moment vector have advantages over the gene order phylogenetic analysis since the genome spaces do not depend on gene orders and are capable of using all gene families. We will apply the moment vector method on the detailed phylogenetic analysis using the large-scale genomic rearrangement data. The distance matrix of four genomes in the 60-dimmensional genome spaceThe distance matrix of four genomes in the 60-dimmensional genome spaceIn this paper, we report a two-dimensional graphical representation for DNA sequences. A moment vector system to represent a DNA sequence is introduced, and the correspondence between a DNA sequence and its moment vector is mathematically proven to be one-to-one. With this moment vector system, each genome sequence can be represented as a point in a Euclidean space, and the genome space is constructed as a subspace of this Euclidean space. Genomes with close evolutionary relationship and similar properties plot close together in this genome space. Thus, it will provide a new powerful tool for analyzing the classification of genomes and their phylogenetic relationships. Our method is easier and quicker in handling whole or partial genomes than multiple alignment methods. There are two major advantages to our method. (i) Once a genome space has been constructed, it can be stored in a database. There is no need to reconstruct the genome space for any subsequent application, whereas in multiple alignment methods, realignment is needed for add-on new sequences. (ii) One can have global comparison of all genomes simultaneously, which no other existing method can achieve. Furthermore, in our method, the results in two-dimensional genome space can be displayed and viewed graphically; this is user-friendly and allows even non-expert to understand the relationship among different genomes via viewing the graph of genome space.We gratefully acknowledge Professor Yuen-Ling Chan from University of Chicago, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology who read our paper and gave some constructive comments.

IntroductionSince human genome and several other organisms' genomes are completely sequenced, gene regulation is realized to be more immense and more complex than expected. The functional properties are known not only on protein-coding sequences but also on non-coding or untranslated sequences. Recent cDNA studies1,2 suggested that transcription start sites (TSSs) are widespread throughout the human genomes,3,4 and ENCODE consortium reported that major part of such TSSs should produce long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs),3 especially from intergenic regions.4–7 Furthermore, a large number of putatively lncRNAs were discovered from the antisense regions of the protein-coding genes.8,9 Although tens of thousands of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have been identified in mammalian cells,10–13 their identification, regulation mechanisms and functional characterization are still incomplete.14–17With the growing number of the uncharacterized lncRNAs, concerns have been raised that they may be mere transcriptional noise of mammalian cells.18–22 A large number of lncRNAs are not evolutionarily conserved, and their expression levels seem too low to imply any biological functions, frequently below the limit of the northern blotting analysis.23–25 Nonetheless, a recent study demonstrated that the lncRNAs with potential biological significance could be selected by examining chromatin signatures,5 proving that at least some of the lncRNAs do have biological relevance.Although information about millions of TSSs has become available,1,26,27 it is still insufficient to represent comprehensive overview of intergenic TSSs in a quantitative manner. In order to understand the nature of intergenic TSSs of unknown functions, further in-depth and wider variety of biological data, focusing on a particular cell type or a cellular response in a more quantitative manner, are essential.We have been collecting and analyzing full-length cDNAs of human genes by utilizing our cap selection method, oligo-capping.26–28 Recently, to increase the throughput of the cDNA sequencing, we combined oligo-capping with the massively paralleled sequencing technology, Illumina GA.29 In this method, named TSS Seq, sequence adaptor, which is necessary for Illumina GA sequencing, is directly introduced to the cap site of the mRNA (TSS tag).30 In addition to TSS Seq, various high-throughput analyses have been enabled by using the massively paralleled sequencer. It is now possible to perform genome-wide analyses to examine nucleosome structure (Nucleosome Seq),31,32 binding of a transcription factor (ChIP Seq),33 complete cDNA sequences (cDNA shotgun), identification and characterization of RNAs in a particular subcellular locations or an experimental condition (RNA Seq)34,35 with feasible cost and efforts.In our previous study, we identified 371 849 intergenic TSS clusters (iTSCs) that were identified by the TSS Seq analysis of 12 human cell lines and tissues. We found that, among these TSS clusters, only 6039 are having significant expression levels (R. Yamashita et al., submitted). In this paper, we report our first integrative transcriptome analyses of the intergenic TSS using a total of 254 076 723 short-read sequences (Supplementary Fig. S1). We show that not all intergenic TSSs have the same properties; thus, it is possible to classify them and discriminate intergenic TSSs which are likely to have biological relevance from the other noise-level TSSs (Fig. 1).Classification of the iTSCs.

Cell culture and tissuesHuman cell lines, DLD-1 cells (ATCC number: CCL-221), were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 4.5 g/l glucose and antibiotics. HEK293, MCF7, TIG3, BEAS2B and Ramos cells (ATCC number: CRL-1573, ATCC number: HTB-22 and Japan Cell Resource Bank number: JCRB0506) were cultured in standard conditions. For hypoxic induction, DLD-1, HEK 293, MCF7 and TIG3 cells were incubated in 1% O2 and 5% CO2 for 24 h. In order to get the RNA, six million cells were cultured and harvested for RNA extraction using RNeasy (Qiagen). The quality and quantity of the obtained total RNAs were assessed, using BioAnalyzer (Agilent). Human tissue RNAs (brain, heart, kidney, fetal brain, fetal heart, fetal kidney) were purchased from Clontech (catalog numbers: 636526, 636529, 636530, 636532, 636583 and 636584).2.2. Construction of the TSS Seq libraries and analysis of the TSS tagsTwo hundred micrograms of the obtained total RNA were subjected to oligo-capping; after the successive treatment of the RNA with 2.5 U BAP (TaKaRa) at 37°C for 1 h and 40 U TAP (Ambion) at 37°C for 1 h, the BAP-TAP-treated RNAs were ligated with 1.2 µg of RNA oligo(5'-AAUGAUACGGCGACCACCGAGAUCUACACUCUUUCCCUACACGACGCUCUUCCGAUCUGG-3') using 250 U T4 RNA ligase (TaKaRa) at 20°C for 3 h. After the DNase I treatment (TaKaRa), polyA+ RNA was selected using oligo-dT powder (Collaborative). First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 10 pmol of random hexamer primer (5'-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGANNNNNNC-3') using Super Script II (Invitrogen) by incubating at 12°C for 1 h and at 42°C overnight. Template RNA was degraded by alkaline treatment. For polymerase chain reaction (PCR), one-fifth of the first-strand cDNAs were used as the PCR template. Gene Amp PCR kits (PerkinElmer) were used with the PCR primers 5'-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAG-3' and 5'-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGA-3' under the following reaction conditions: 15 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 56°C for 1 min and 72°C for 2 min. The PCR fragments were size fractionated by 12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the fraction of 150–250 bp was recovered. The quality and quantity of the obtained single-stranded first-strand cDNAs were assessed, using BioAnalyzer (Agilent). One nanogram of the size-fractionated cDNA was used for the sequencing reactions with the Illumina GA. The sequencing reactions were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.Thirty-six-base pair-read TSS tags were mapped onto the human genome sequence (hg18 as of UCSC Genome Browser) using ELAND. Uniquely and completely (without any mismatch) mapped TSS tags were used for the analysis. TSSs located from the 3'-end boundaries to -50 kb of the 5'-end boundaries of the adjoining RefSeq genes were selected. Then, the clustering of the intergenic TSS tags into 500-bp bin was performed. TSS clusters were removed when all the belonging TSS tags were located at the internal exonic region of the corresponding RefSeq genes. The RefSeq information as to the genomic coordinate, position of the protein-coding region and so on is as of hg18 (http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg18/). Gene ontology terms (as of 1 June 2009) were correlated with RefSeq using loc2go GO (as of 1 June 2009) using NCBI Entrez Gene database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=gene).2.3. Construction of the Nucleosome Seq library and analysis of the nucleosome tagsDLD-1 cells were cultured at 80% confluency and were treated with micrococcus nuclease to generate mononucleosomes using ChIP-IT Express Enzymatic (Active motif). The cells were formaldehyde-cross-linked before isolating nucleosomes. Cross-linking was achieved with fixation solution (DMEM, 0.01% formaldehyde) for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were then washed with PBS, and cross-linking was stopped with Glycine Stop-Fix Solution (PBS, Glycine buffer) for 5 min at room temperature. After washing with PBS, ice-cold cell scraping solution was added to the dish and cells were harvested. The cells were re-suspended in ice-cold lysis buffer, were incubate on ice for 30 min and homogenized with 15–20 strokes with a pestle. The nuclei were suspended in digestion buffer and pre-warm this solution for 5 min at 37°C. Enzymatic cocktail dissolved (200 U/ml) was added to the sample and the digestion reaction was incubated at 37°C for 15 min. The reaction was stopped with EDTA, the nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation and the supernatants were collected. Formaldehyde cross-linking was reversed by adding 5 M NaCl, RNase and incubation at 65°C for over 4 h. Proteinase K was added and incubated at 42°C for 1.5 h. DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extractions and ethanol precipitation. Using the extracted DNA, sample preparation for Illumina GA was made according to the manufacturer's instructions.2.4. Shotgun sequencing of the cDNAColony PCR was performed for the cDNA clones using the common PCR primers of 5'-TCAGTGGATGTTGCCTTTAC-3' and 5'-TGTGGGAGGTTTTTTCTCTA-3'. Obtained PCR products were nebulized so that the average fragments size is 200–500 bp. Sample preparation for Illumina GA was made according to the manufacturer's instructions. Using the generated 36-bp sequence tags, cDNA sequences were assembled based on the mapping information to the human genome sequence. Details of the computational procedure for the assembling and their quality are described elsewhere. Since the quality of the base-call varied, only the boundary information of the exons was extracted and actual nucleotide sequences were replaced with those of the reference human genome.2.5. Subcellular fractionationA total of 1 × 108 DLD-1 cells were incubated with the medium containing 0.1 mg/ml cycloheximide for 5 min at 37°C and washed with PBS (containing 0.1 mg/ml cycloheximide). Cell pellets were re-suspended in lysis buffer [20 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 15 mM MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mg/ml cycloheximide, 0.1 mM dithiothreitol, RNase inhibitor, Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche)] and lysed on ice for 10 min. Lysate was separated into cytoplasmic fraction (supernatant) and nuclear fraction (pellet) by centrifugation. Nuclear pellet was re-suspended in lysis buffer, homogenized and lysed on ice for 10 min. A portion of cytoplasmic fraction was layered on the top of a 10-ml 15–50% (w/v) sucrose gradient and centrifuged at 100 000 g in Beckman SW41Ti rotor for 2 h 15 min at 4°C. Cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were treated with 200 µg/ml proteinase K, and RNA was extracted by TRIzol LS (Invitrogen). Obtained RNA concentration was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). For validation of the precise separation of the subcellular fractions, see Supplementary Fig. S8.2.6. Quantitative reverse transcription–PCR analysisTwenty kinds of normal human tissues were selected for expression analysis, both fetal and adult major organs, included adrenal gland, bone marrow, brain (whole), fetal brain, fetal liver, heart, kidney, liver, lung (whole), placenta, prostate, salivary gland, skeletal muscle, testis, thymus, thyroid gland, trachea, uterus, colon w/mucosa and spinal cord. Total RNAs were purchased from Clontech (Human total RNA Master Panel II). The qualitative assessment of all total RNA was done utilizing the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Total RNA (8 µg) from each sample was reverse transcribed using an oligo(dT) and the Superscript II reverse transcriptase kit (Invitrogen). Negative control samples (no first-strand synthesis) were prepared by performing reverse transcription reactions in the absence of reverse transcriptase. Expression profile was performed using the quantitative reverse transcription–PCR (qRT–PCR). Gene-specific primer pairs were designed using Primer3 software, with an optimal primer size of 20 bp, amplification size of 100–500 bp and annealing temperature of 55°C. The primers were purchased from Operon. Quantitative real-time PCR was carried out with 100 pg of total RNA per test well using the Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystem). The PCR reactions were performed using an ABI 7900HT Fast Real-Time System (Applied Biosystems) using the following cycling protocols: 40 cycles of 15 s at 95°C and 60 s at 60°C. The threshold cycle (Ct) value was calculated from amplification plots, in which the fluorescence signal detected was plotted against the PCR cycle. We defined express sequence when the threshold cycle values (Ct) <37 in the presence of reverse transcriptase, but not when reverse transcriptase was absent. The product size was checked by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis, and melting curves were analyzed to monitor the specificity of the PCR.2.7. Computational proceduresOverlap between the iTSCs and miRNA and snoRNA, from miRBase (http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk/sequences/index.shtml) and snoRNABase (http://www-snorna.biotoul.fr/index.php), respectively, were examined. Statistical significance of the difference in the sequence features around the iTSCs was evaluated by the indicated methods.3. Results and discussion3.1. Identification and initial characterization of iTSCsSchematic representation of the TSS Seq and statistics of the 139 446 730 thirty-six-base pair TSS tags, which were collected from 12 cell lines and tissues of humans and used in this study, are shown in Supplementary Fig. S1 (GenBank accession number for each of the TSS tag data set is also shown there). All of the TSS information is publicly available from our database (http://dbtss.hgc.jp). The TSS tags that were mapped to the intergenic regions, from 3'-end boundaries to -50 kb of the 5'-end boundaries of the adjoining RefSeq genes (Fig. 2), were selected. The 5'-end of the RefSeq genes was mixed with 50-kb upstream regions to remove the possible alternative promoters of the RefSeq genes (Supplementary Fig. S1E). Then, the selected TSSs were clustered into 500 bp bins (iTSCs) in every cell type. The clustering analysis revealed that the numbers of iTSCs with >5 ppm TSS tags were only around 500–2000 depending on cell types. Taken all TSS data from each cell types together, there were 371 849 iTSCs; however, the number of iTSCs with >5 ppm TSS tags at least in one cell type was only 6039. We tentatively selected iTSCs of >5 ppm, since 5 ppm is supported to be roughly corresponding to 5 copies/cell, assuming that each cell has 1 million mRNA copies. We considered that such a transcript level should be necessary to robustly realize biological functions (see Supplementary Fig. S2, for further detailed discussion).Intergenic region. Intergenic regions were defined as regions from 3'-end boundaries to the -50 kb of the 5'-end boundaries of the adjoining RefSeq genes; ‘50 kb margins’ was adopted at the 5'-ends of the RefSeq genes, considering that some of the iTSCs located within these regions might be alternative promoters of downstream RefSeq genes.Intergenic region.

Complete sequencing of the transcripts of the iTSCsFor both iTSCs of >5 ppm and those of <5 ppm, we characterized what transcripts were transcribed from the identified iTSCs. We selected completely sequenced full-length DNA clones which overlapped the iTSCs from MGC and FLJ cDNA collections. Among the total 371 849 iTSCs, there were 395 and 1617 iTSCs which overlapped the 5'-ends of the MGC and FLJ cDNAs, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S3A). We examined the cDNA sequences and found that about 60% of the cDNAs contained open reading frames (ORFs) of no more than 100 amino acids. When including the cDNAs which were possible targets for the nonsense mRNA decay or had 5'-untranslated region of >750 bases, 85% of them had features which may hamper efficient translation and, thus, were likely to be ncRNAs.In order to exclude the possible selection bias of the cDNA clones in the respective cDNA projects (note these cDNA projects aimed to select protein-coding transcripts), we selected and determined the complete sequences of the cDNA from our cDNA collection anew. In order to expedite the sequencing, we employed shotgun sequencing of the cDNA using Illumina GA. Details of the computational procedure for the assembling of the cDNA sequences are described in the ‘Materials and methods’ section. As a result, 361 and 103 cDNAs which correspond to the iTSCs of >5 ppm and those of <5 ppm were successfully assembled without any gap using a total of 3 382 901 short-read sequence tags. We analyzed the assembled sequences and found that the 80% of them contained no ORF longer than 100 amino acids and 91% of them had either of the above translational caveats (Supplementary Fig. S3B). These results strongly suggested that, either >5 ppm or <5 ppm, the iTSCs identified here should represent TSSs of ncRNAs.3.3. Expression profiles of the iTSCs of >5 ppmIn our previous study, we found that the iTSCs of very low expression levels are generally: (i) located in AT rich regions, rarely associated with CpG island; (ii) evolutionarily poorly conserved, often associated with repetitive sequences (also see Supplementary Fig. S4A). We also found that, unlike the cases in significantly expressed iTSCs, iTSCs of very low expression levels are rarely associated with RNA polymerase II binding sites based on the results of the ChIP-Seq analysis (also see Supplementary Figs S4C and S5). In summary, the iTSCs of significant expression levels have clearly distinctive features, which are rather similar to the TSSs of protein-coding transcripts. On the other hand, sequence features observed for iTSCs of low expression levels seemed consistent with the hypothesis that very minor iTSCs occasionally occur from universal genomic sequences as biological noise, thus evolutionarily unstable since no selection pressure is being extorted. Further details of this analysis are described in the reference (Yamashita et al., submitted).In order to further characterize the iTSCs of >5 ppm, we examined their expression profiles. For this, we first used digital TSS Seq tag counts in 12 cell types. Among the 6039 iTSCs of >5 ppm, we counted number of cell types which gave TSS tag counts of >5 ppm. We found that 3739 (62%) of them were expressed at >5 ppm only in one cell type, suggesting that many of them are expressed in a tissue-preferred manner (Fig. 3A). Among these, fetal brain was the richest source of the iTSCs of >5 ppm. In all of 1812 iTSCs expressed at >5 ppm in fetal brain, 722 (40%) were expressed only in fetal brain and additionally 166 (9%) iTSCs were expressed in fetal brain and brain (Fig. 3B). On the other hand, the poorest source of the tissue-specific iTSCs was HEK293 [nevertheless, still 66 (25%) of the iTSCs showed specific expressions in HEK293; Fig. 3C]. Generally, tissue-specific expressions of the iTSCs were observed more frequently in normal tissues than cultured cells, possibly reflecting the reduced complexity of the gene functions in cultured cell lines.Expression profile of the iTSCs of >5 ppm. (A) Tissue specificity of the iTSCs of >5 ppm. The number of the cell types in which iTSCs of >5 ppm were observed is indicated in x-axis. (B and C) As for iTSCs which were observed in fetal brain (B) and HEK293 cells (C), whether they were also observed in different cell types was examined. Populations of the iTSCs whose expressions were observed in the indicated number of the cell types are shown.Expression profile of the iTSCs of >5 ppm. (A) Tissue specificity of the iTSCs of >5 ppm.

Populations of the iTSCs whose expressions were observed in the indicated number of the cell types are shown.In order to observe the expression patterns of the iTSCs in wider cell types, we performed qRT–PCR assays in additional 20 kinds of human normal tissues using the PCR primers designed based on the complete cDNA sequences. For 44 out of 67 iTSCs of >5 ppm, we observed clear signals at least in one tissue. Again, we observed that the expression of the iTSCs of >5 ppm generally had tissue preference (Supplementary Table S1). We also examined the expression of the 93 iTSCs of <5 ppm by qRT–PCR. In 60 out of 93 iTSCs of <5 ppm, weak but clear signals were obtained. Of these expressed iTSCs, 16 iTSCs (27%) showed clear tissue specificity. Although the presence of the transcripts for those iTSCs was confirmed, their expression levels determined by qRT–PCR were lower than iTSCs of >5 ppm across the tissues examined.3.4. Correlation between a group of iTSCs of >5 ppm and RefSeq genesWe further scrutinized the iTSCs of >5 ppm and found that iTSCs of >5 ppm are not a uniform group. To precisely examine the genomic position of the iTSCs, 10 kb windows of the genome position were defined relatively to the RefSeq gene positions. We found that a number of iTSCs of >5 ppm were located in the proximal regions of RefSeq genes (Fig. 4). Although 23% (1382 cases) of the iTSCs of >5 ppm were located within 10 kb downstream of the RefSeq gene in the same strand (RefSeq-linked iTSCs), the frequency of such iTSCs in the iTSC group of <5 ppm was only 7% (24 486 cases). We compared the expression patterns of the iTSCs of >5 ppm with their neighboring RefSeq genes by calculating Pearson's correlation of the respective TSS tag counts. We found that the expressions of the RefSeq-linked iTSCs were generally resembled to the expressions of their nearest RefSeq genes (Fig. 5A). Such correlation was not detected in the iTSCs located further than 10 kb from the nearest RefSeq genes (non-RefSeq-linked iTSCs; Fig. 5B). In order to observe the expression correlation in wider cell types, we performed qRT–PCR assays in 20 normal tissues using 12 representative cases. Again, we observed general correlation of the expression patterns between the RefSeq-linked iTSCs of >5 ppm and the nearby RefSeq genes (exemplified in Fig. 5C), and no correlation was observed for the non-RefSeq-linked iTSCs of >5 ppm (exemplified in Fig. 5D).Distance from the iTSCs to the nearest RefSeq genes. Distribution of the distance between the iTSCs and the nearest RefSeq genes is shown in the case of the iTSCs of >5 ppm (A) and the those of <5 ppm (B). According to this positioning observation, the iTSCs were separated into two groups: (C) RefSeq-linked iTSCs (iTSCs which lie within 10 kb of RefSeq genes) and non-RefSeq-linked iTSCs (iTSCs which locate further than 10 kb from the nearest RefSeq genes).Distance from the iTSCs to the nearest RefSeq genes.

Completely sequenced cDNA and distributions of the TSS Seq tags and ChIP-Seq tags (pol II) in the surrounding region are shown.It was unlikely that these RefSeq-linked iTSCs of >5 ppm were derived from the 5'-end truncated products of the RefSeq gene transcripts due to the errors in the cap selection procedure.27 At least in 186 out of 356 (52%) RefSeq-linked iTSCs which were expressed at >5 ppm in DLD-1 cells, their presence were also clearly supported by bindings of RNA polymerase II by ChIP-Seq analysis (Supplementary Fig. S4C). Of these, 50 RefSeq-linked iTSCs were further supported by cDNA clones, which did not overlap the RefSeq transcripts (Fig. 5E and F). It was rather likely that these RefSeq-linked iTSCs might be activated simply because of the generally loose chromatin structure which was formed to facilitate the transcription of the upstream RefSeq gene (mentioned as ‘transcriptional rippling noise’ in a recent paper36).In order to examine this hypothesis, we analyzed the nucleosome structure in their surrounding regions by Nucleosome Seq using DLD-1 cells. A total of 19 570 149 sequence tags were collected and occupancy of the nucleosome was calculated (see the ‘Materials and methods’ section, Supplementary Fig. S6 and the references37–39). Orderly nucleosome structure was not observed for the RefSeq-linked iTSCs of >5 ppm (Fig. 6B) and those of <5 ppm (Fig. 6C). On the contrary, for the non-RefSeq-linked TSCs of >5 ppm, we observed the formation of the nucleosome-free regions just upstream of the TSSs and periodic positioning of the nucleosome immediately downstream of the TSS (Fig. 6A). These results may reflect that transcriptions of RefSeq-linked iTSCs of >5 ppm seem not to form independent transcriptional ‘regulatory’ units, in spite of their relatively high expression levels, whereas non-RefSeq-linked iTSCs of >5 ppm are subjected to strict independent regulations. Consistently, we further examined and found that the TSSs were more widely fluctuating (also see Suzuki et al.40) in RefSeq-linked iTSCs of >5 ppm than non-RefSeq-linked iTSCs of >5 ppm (7e-16; Wilcoxon test). The average sizes of the regions which covered 80% of the TSSs within a particular TSC were 264 and 122 bp, respectively.Nucleosome structure of the surrounding regions of the iTSCs. Nucleosome structure in the surrounding regions of the iTSCs of >5 ppm, located outside of 10 kb from the nearest RefSeq genes on the same strand (A), those of >5 ppm, located within 10 kb from the nearest RefSeq genes on the same strand (B), and those of <5 ppm (C). (D) Nucleosome structure in the surrounding regions of RefSeq genes. Six hundred and fifteen (total number of the RefSeq-linked iTSCs plus non-RefSeq-linked RNAs) RefSeq genes were randomly selected so that the distribution of their expression levels should be similar to that of iTSCs. For each group, nucleosome occupancy scores (y-axis) were calculated for the indicated genomic position (x-axis) relative to the TSS, according to the standard method shown in the reference.Nucleosome structure of the surrounding regions of the iTSCs.

For each group, nucleosome occupancy scores (y-axis) were calculated for the indicated genomic position (x-axis) relative to the TSS, according to the standard method shown in the reference.3.5. Characterization of the non-RefSeq-linked iTSCsFor the remaining 3651 non-RefSeq-linked iTSCs of >5 ppm, we considered that some of them might participate in transcription of the precursors of miRNAs or other small RNAs, since the structures of the primary transcripts of them were still mostly unknown. We examined overlap of the iTSCs with previously reported miRNAs and snoRNAs registered in miRBase41 and snoBase,42 respectively. We found that 23 miRNAs and 123 snoRNAs were located within 50 kb downstream of the identified iTSCs (note 50 kb downstream sequences were extended from identified iTSCs, representing transcription regions of iTSC). Particularly, for 22 miRNAs and 11 snoRNAs, complete cDNA sequences directly showed that the mature forms of the small RNAs were actually located within the transcribed regions following the iTSCs (exemplified in Supplementary Fig. S7).In order to further identify the iTSCs which transcribe the primary transcripts of miRNAs, we performed small RNA Seq analysis using DLD-1 cells. In total, 604 141 sequences of size-selected RNAs of 21-25 bp were determined. Obtained short-read sequences were clustered, and 21-bp sequences which had expression levels of >50 ppm were selected (in this case, the ppm value was calculated against the total number of the sequenced small RNAs, whose gross expression levels was estimated 1/10–1/100 compared with mRNAs/lncRNAs. Thus, 50 ppm is expected to be at the similar level with 5 ppm in the case of mRNAs/lncRNAs). Among the identified 1266 putative miRNAs (49 overlapped the previously reported miRNAs), 24 miRNAs were located within 50 kb of the non-RefSeq-linked iTSCs of >5 ppm in DLD-1 cells (4% of the total 575 non-RefSeq-linked iTSCs). Of these putative miRNAs, only two were directly supported by cDNA clones. Having observed that most of the iTSCs were not correlated with the miRNAs, the majority of non-RefSeq-linked iTSCs are not used for transcribing primary transcripts of miRNAs.We examined subcellular localization of their transcripts by RNA Seq of RNAs extracted from nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions using DLD-1 cells. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S8, precise separation of the cytoplasmic fraction from the nuclear fraction was confirmed by qRT–PCR, using nuclear scaRNAs and other snoRNAs, and western blotting analysis using nuclear lamin A/C proteins and cytoplasmic GAPDH protein. A total of 20 094 475 and 14 879 174 tags were collected from the nuclear and cytoplasmic RNAs, respectively. RNA Seq tags were associated with the iTSCs when their mapped genomic positions overlapped. Among the 575 non-RefSeq-linked iTSCs with expression levels of >5 ppm in DLD-1 cells, 337 iTSCs (59%) overlapped at least three RNA Seq tags from the cytoplasmic fraction. Of these, 99 iTSCs (17%) were particularly enriched in cytoplasm (P < 0.01). These results showed that a large number of iTSC transcripts are actually exported into cytoplasm without losing the surrounding sequences of the TSSs, possibly in their native forms as lncRNAs.3.6. Integration of the transcriptome data for inferring biological functions of the non-RefSeq-linked iTSCsWe wished to demonstrate that specific functions of the iTSCs underlying particular biological events could be inferred from the integrative interpretation of hereby described various types of transcriptome data. We focused the analysis on the iTSCs whose functions may be associated with hypoxic response of the cell. For this, we generated additional 36 761 810 thirty-six-base pair TSS tags in DLD-1, MCF7, HEK293 and TIG3 cells which were cultured in 1% O2 (Supplementary Fig. S9). As shown in Table 1, 508 and 365 iTSCs of >5 ppm showed expression induction and repression by more than 5-fold in response to the hypoxic shock in at least one cell type, respectively. Among the 508 hypoxia-induced iTSCs, 232 were RefSeq-linked iTSCs and 276 were non-RefSeq-linked iTSCs. Among the 276 non-RefSeq-linked hypoxia-induced iTSCs, iTSC of an lncRNA, H19, whose induction in response to hypoxia has been recently reported to be essential in the tumorigenecity of the cell, was included.43Statistics of the TSS Seq analysis monitoring hypoxic responses of the cultured cellsStatistics of the TSS Seq analysis monitoring hypoxic responses of the cultured cellsOn the basis of the collected TSS Seq data, we examined whether expression patterns of the iTSCs were correlated with any groups of the RefSeq genes. We associated the RefSeq genes with the iTSC when Pearson's correlation coefficient was >0.8 (Pearson's correlation coefficients between the TSS tag counts of an lncRNA, H19, and those of p57kip2 and angiogenin, which are reported direct effectors of H19 in the hypoxic responses,30,43,44 were 0.98 and 0.78, respectively). Then, we examined whether particular GO terms45 were enriched (P < 1e-6; hypergeometric distribution) in the group of RefSeq genes which were associated with the iTSCs.As exemplified in Fig. 7A, a non-RefSeq-linked iTSC, which was 9.6-fold induced in MCF-7 cells by hypoxia, was correlated with the 34 RefSeq genes having GO terms, ‘hemophilic cell adhesion’, in common (P = 7e-6). Subcellular localization of the RNA products of this iTSC identified by the RNA Seq analysis was ‘cytoplasm’ (P = 0.0). The biological function of this lncRNA might be to interact directly with cell adhesion protein molecules in modulating cellular mobility. Full list of the iTSCs for which biological functions were inferred by the GO terms is shown in Supplementary Table S2. Interestingly, although various GO terms were associated, the GO term ‘hemophilic cell adhesion’ appeared far more frequently than the other GO terms (P < 4e-13). In total, 53 iTSCs were correlated with this GO term. One of the major biological roles of iTSCs in response to hypoxia might be to control cell–cell interactions.Integration of the transcriptome data obtained from various viewpoints. Transcriptome information collected by the indicated analyses is shown for a non-RefSeq-linked iTSC (A) and a RefSeq-linked iTSC (B).Integration of the transcriptome data obtained from various viewpoints. Transcriptome information collected by the indicated analyses is shown for a non-RefSeq-linked iTSC (A) and a RefSeq-linked iTSC (B).On the other hand, expressions of a significant number of RefSeq-linked iTSCs were also changed by hypoxia, as exemplified in Fig. 7B. However, in this group of iTSCs, generally fewer RefSeq genes other than their neighboring RefSeq genes had correlated expression patterns with those iTSCs and fewer GO terms were associated. These results may reflect the fact that inductions of the RefSeq-linked iTSCs are not well coordinated in the transcriptional regulatory network of human genes.3.7. Identification and characterization of TSCs in the antisense of the RefSeq genesAbout 1–5% of the TSS tags were mapped to the antisense of the RefSeq genes, depending on cell types (Table 2). Similar to the case in the iTSCs, we clustered and analyzed those TSS tags (antisense TSCs; aTSCs). Again, we observed that the aTSCs having significant expression levels are only minor part. Taken all cell types together, although there were 127 036 aTSCs, aTCSs of >5 ppm were only 3301 (Table 3; also see Supplementary Fig. S2). We examined the characteristic features of the aTSCs and found that they showed somewhat similar features with iTSCs of >5 ppm; located in evolutionarily conserved GC-rich regions and rarely associated with repetitive elements (Supplementary Fig. S4B). We also confirmed that the presence of the aTSCs of >5 ppm is clearly supported by pol II binding in some cases (Supplementary Fig. S4C). Interestingly, those aTSCs of >5 ppm were concentrated around the 5'- and 3'-ends of their harboring genes (Fig. 8A). Nevertheless, when we further examined their expression patterns with the overlapping RefSeq genes by calculating Pearson's correlation based on the digital TSS tag counts, we found generally correlation between the expression patterns of aTSCs and those of the antisense RefSeq genes (Fig. 8B). Also, we observed that general lack of the ordered nucleosome positioning in the surrounding regions (Fig. 8C and D), perhaps reflecting the lack of strict transcriptional regulations. These results may imply that, similar to the case in the RefSeq-linked iTSCs, major part of the aTCSs, if not all, are also ‘transcriptional rippling’ products of the transcriptions of the RefSeq genes and have no biological consequences on their own. Distal regions of the genes might be particularly susceptible to such transcriptions, although the possibility that at least a part of those aTSCs are involved in transcriptional regulations of RefSeq genes has not been completely excluded.

ConclusionsIn this paper, we described our first attempt to characterize the iTSCs by multifaceted use of massively paralleled sequencer. Integrated analysis of various types of transcriptome data revealed that different types of iTSCs have different properties. Particularly, we showed that non-RefSeq-linked iTSCs of >5 ppm have several features which should be essential to realize biologically relevant transcriptions. And they could be clearly discriminated from other type of iTSCs, many of which might represent noise products of the transcriptions inherent to the long and complex human genome. We also showed that major parts of the aTSCs have the similar properties with the iTSCs which seemed not to form independent transcriptional units. It is true that we used the conservative computational filters placed on the sequencing results. For example, we considered only TSCs of >5 ppm in the limited cell types. We also removed TSCs located within 50-kb upstream regions of the RefSeq genes and defined the iTSCs located within 10-kb downstream regions of the RefSeq genes as ‘RefSeq-linked’ iTSCs. Therefore, classification using further optimized parameters is necessary to re-defining the characteristics of the respective iTSCs group. However, it should be significant that we could observe not all the iTSCs have the same features even as the first approximation.We also demonstrated that integrative transcriptome data gives useful starting point for further investigation of the biological roles of the iTSCs, specifically in the case of the hypoxic response of the cells. Indeed, it is important to consider various types of transcriptome data. Importantly, as shown in this study, the number of iTSCs/aTSCs whose biological relevance seems somewhat questionable is far larger than the iTSCs/aTSCs which have presumed biological functions. Without any biological information in addition to cataloged TSSs/cDNAs, it is practically impossible to select and conduct meaningful functional assays for the increasing number of iTSCs/aTSCs. In our opinion, the biggest advantage of the massively paralleled sequencer is that various approaches of genome-wide analysis are simultaneously enabled on a common platform. Further intensive use of the massively paralleled sequencer will shed brighter light on dynamically interacting worlds of ncRNAs and proteins, which collectively realize complex human gene network. With such knowledge, we will finally understand the biological meaning of every transcription initiation event in the human genome.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at DNA Research online.FundingThis work was supported by Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan [the Japan Key Technology Center project]; Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare [Third-Term Comprehensive 10-Year Strategy for Cancer Control, Grants-in-Aid for Cancer Research]; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology-Japan [Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Priority Areas].We are grateful to K.

IntroductionCodon usage bias (CUB) is usually defined as a species-specific deviation from uniform codon usage in the coding regions of genomic sequences. This bias is possible due to the redundancy of the genetic code, which allows differential use of synonymous codons.1 The particular pattern of bias observed in a given species is thought to be the product of drift and selection pressures acting on a number of parameters, but mainly on tRNA gene copy number and genomic %GC content.2–5 CUB is therefore a strong species-specific statistic with numerous applications, such as gene prediction or the identification of laterally transferred genes.6,7 It was observed early on that the CUB of individual genes correlates strongly with their expression level in many microbial organisms.1,2,8 In these organisms, selective pressure to optimize translational efficiency during rapid growth can overcome drift and mutational bias, leading to highly skewed codon usage patterns within a genome. Genes that need to be highly expressed during rapid growth will resort preferentially to a small subset of codons recognized by the most abundant tRNA species. This deviation from the overall genomic CUB is known as the ‘major codon bias’1 and its pattern appears to be highly uniform among fast-growing bacteria, despite significant differences in %GC content.4 A major codon bias has also been reported to some extent in multicellular eukaryotes, although it is absent in most mammals and in some bacteria.9–11Owing to the relationship between CUB and translational optimization, indices based on this bias can be applied to predict the expression of individual gene sequences and can thus play an important role in fields such as biotechnology, by assisting in the fine-tuning of heterologous gene expression.12,13 Many different indices of CUB have been proposed to date.14,15 Some indices, like the effective number of codons (Nc)16 or the <U+03C7>2 statistic,9 estimate deviation from true uniformity in codon usage. However, the vast majority of indices measures deviation from a subset of putative translationally optimal codons or genes. The codon bias index (CBI) and the frequency of optimal codons (Fop), for instance, calculate codon bias based on a set of ‘optimal’ codons derived, respectively, either from a subset of genes17 or from the tRNA concentration data.2 Both the expression measure E(g) and the codon adaptation index (CAI) circumvent the necessity of categorizing codons as optimal or non-optimal by using directly the observed frequency of codons in a reference set in the calculation of their index.18,19Most CBIs have been shown to correlate relatively well with either mRNA or protein concentration levels in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli.14,15,21–24 These results are relevant even though it is known that the correlation between mRNA and protein concentration cannot be perfect due to several factors, such as translational initiation/elongation rates and protein half-life.14,22,25 This non-linear relationship, among other factors, puts an upper limit on the best correlations that can be obtained between CBIs and expression levels.23 In most of these studies, CAI outperformed other methods in predicting gene expression14 or performed close to proposed improvements or variations.21,23 Thus, CAI remains as the gold standard among CBIs. In spite of these successes, CBIs have several limitations. On the one hand, indices measuring deviation from uniform codon usage have been shown repeatedly to overestimate deviation for short sequences.15,26,27 On the other hand, as defined originally, indices relying on a reference set are only applicable to species in which selection for translational efficiency has been established. Furthermore, these methods rely on a species-specific reference set that needs to be defined. Results are therefore not directly comparable between different species, although both CAI and E(g)20 have been shown to be quite resilient to changes in their reference sets21 and iterative algorithms have been proposed to derive the CAI reference sets automatically.28Roymondal et al. showed that their method correlated significantly with CAI and E(g) in different E. coli data sets. They also showed that RCBS was a superior predictor of protein concentration and protein abundance than CAI and E(g), respectively, on these same data sets. On the basis of their observation that RCBS has a strong correlation with gene length, yielding larger values for shorter gene sequences and that it correlates well with protein abundance, the authors concluded that natural selection favours high expression levels in short genes, increasing their codon adaptation. In a second publication, the authors extended their analysis of RCBS to S. cerevisiae and arrived to the same conclusion (selection favours high expression levels in short genes) following the same logic.30 Here, we show that the positive results reported by Roymondal et al.29 in E. coli are based on built-in biases within the small data sets used for validation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that their conclusion that selection favours codon optimization in short genes is erroneous and stems from systematically ignoring an intrinsic bias in their method due to undersampling, which is implicit in short sequences. We proceed to show how RCBS can be corrected by different means and how its underlying principle, which we term relative codon adaptation (RCA), can be applied to different reference sets, leading to improved estimations of gene expression.2. Materials and methods2.1. Expression dataTo validate the accuracy of different indices at predicting gene expression, expression data were collected from the Many Microbe Microarrays Database (M3D). The M3D is a compendium of single-channel gene expression experiments in E. coli, S. cerevisiae and Shewanella oneidensis, uniformly normalized using the log robust multiarray analysis (RMA) and encompassing over a thousand microarrays from a single platform (‘Affymetrix’).31,32 Build 6 of the E. coli M3D database was downloaded from the M3D server. From this main data set, we selected only 18 experiments done on E. coli str. K-12 growing in log-phase. For these experiments, 31 different control sets were identified and used as a benchmark for E. coli K-12 expression in log-phase. Individual correlations among the 31 control sets were evaluated (average Pearson r = 0.779 ± 0.091) and found to be remarkably strong, suggesting that the use of a unified platform and resource for microarray data reduces significantly the amount of noise observed previously in microarray expression data.24 Gene names, GenBank accession numbers and other identifiers for E. coli K-12, were downloaded from the EcoGene database33 and cross-referenced on a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet with the 4149 protein-coding gene sequences for E. coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655 available on GenBank. The resulting annotated sequences were then correlated with the M3D bulk download. This led to an annotated expression data set containing 31 independent log-phase expression values for 4029 E. coli protein-coding genes (Supplementary Table S1).Protein abundance data for E. coli were obtained from the Supplementary material accompanying the E. coli cytosol profiling of Ishihama et al.22 This data set contains normalized exponentially modified protein abundance index (emPAI) values for 1103 E. coli cytosolic proteins. emPAI values for the 439 proteins for which CAI values were reported were cross-linked with EcoGene tags and GenBank sequence data sets as reported above, leading to a final data set of 359 E. coli proteins for which molecular weight/mass tags matched (±1) in both annotations (EcoGene and Ishihama et al.) and CAI values reported in Ishihama et al.22 could be reproduced (±0.05) based on GenBank gene sequence (Supplementary Table S2). Protein abundance data for Mycobacterium smegmatis were obtained from the Supplementary material accompanying the mass spectrometry analysis of the M. smegmatis proteome by Wang et al.34 This data set contains a quantification of protein abundance as the number of observations for a particular protein in a sequence of experiments. Here, we used the number of observations in 15 exponential phase experiments as an indicator of protein concentration in exponential growth phase. The original data set contains data on 901 distinct proteins, with CAI and observation numbers provided for 892 proteins. Here, we cross-linked this data with M. smegmatis protein and protein-coding sequences downloaded from NCBI. After combining the data, we obtained a data set of 841 proteins and their corresponding protein-coding sequences (Supplementary Table S3).All other protein and mRNA concentration data referenced by Roymondal et al.29 were obtained from the Supplementary material accompanying their publication and verified using the references provided therein. To compute additional indices over these sets, the provided information was cross-linked with EcoGene tags and GenBank sequences as described above.2.2. Computation of codon usage indicesComputation of CAI, RCA, RCBS and the correction proposed herein (RCBSPC) was done integrally using custom Microsoft Excel functions, following the equations presented in this work. The functions are available at http://research.umbc.edu/~erill/, either as Visual Basic BAS modules or embedded in a macro-enabled Excel 2003 spreadsheet that illustrates their usage.In E. coli, CAI was computed using the w values provided by Sharp and Li.19 For the calculation of RCA, codon and base frequencies were computed on the 27 highly expressed genes used by Sharp and Li19 and applying 0.0001 pseudo-counts for absent codons (AGG and TAG). For M. smegmatis, homologues for the 27 genes in the Sharp and Li data set were identified through reciprocal BLASTP,35,36 enforcing a maximum e-value of 10-3 and a minimum coverage of 40% positives on all BLASTP searches. A total of 22 M. smegmatis homologues for the Sharp and Li gene set were identified in this manner and used for computation of the RCA codon and base frequencies in this organism. For the pseudo-count correction of RCBS (RCBSPC), genomic frequencies were computed on the 4029 E. coli protein-coding gene set of the M3D expression data set.2.3. Generation of random sequencesPseudo-random sequence was generated using two custom Microsoft Excel functions. A first routine was created to generate random sequence based on %GC content and length. This function ensures only that the generated sequence complies with the provided %GC content that the sequence is a congruent open reading frame (no nonsense mutations and terminating in a stop codon). The second routine uses a provided codon usage table (including stop codons) as a base distribution to generate congruent open reading frames. These functions are available at http://research.umbc.edu/~erill/, either as Visual Basic BAS modules or embedded in a macro-enabled Excel 2003 spreadsheet.2.4. Statistical analysisThe Pearson and the Spearman rank correlation coefficients and their corresponding P-values were computed integrally using Microsoft Excel. The Pearson correlations were computed using built-in Excel functions. The Spearman rank correlations were computed using the statistical function set of Wim Gielis. Throughout the manuscript, the Pearson correlation coefficients are denoted by r and the Spearman rank correlation coefficients by <U+03C1>. The asterisk rating system is used for correlation P-values [single asterisk (*), P < 0.05–0.01; double asterisks (**), P < 0.01–0.001; triple asterisks (***), P < 0.001]. P-values are relative to a two-tailed Student's t-test on the null hypothesis (no correlation). For multiple correlations, we report the mean and standard deviation of the correlation coefficient and the largest P-value among the correlations.3. Results and discussion3.1. Dependence of RCBS on sequence lengthA major result of Roymondal and colleagues' application of RCBS is the conclusion that natural selection favours higher expression and heightened codon optimization for short genes in both the E. coli29 and the S. cerevisiae genomes.30 This finding is based on two main observations. On the one hand, the authors observe that RCBS correlates negatively with gene length. On the other hand, they show that there is a positive correlation between RCBS and protein abundance data. This is a surprising result since a previous work had identified a positive, rather than a negative, correlation between CBIs and protein length after controlling for mRNA concentrations,14,37 suggesting secondary selection on translational accuracy for long genes.5,37,38 Moreover, even though some studies had reported some correlation between gene length and mRNA concentration in E. coli and S. cerevisiae,14,24 the correlation turned out to be weak when controlling for codon bias.14 Moreover, and as stated above, many CBIs tend to overestimate deviation in short sequences.15,26,27 Thus, it appeared that Roymondal et al. might have been too eager to identify causation in the correlations they reported, attributing to natural selection what could be the result of an intrinsic bias in their index.In their study, Roymondal et al. analyse and validate the length dependency of RCBS with randomization studies of E. coli sequences. Their randomization method is manifestly unclear and the E. coli genes to be randomized are ‘selected’ by the authors without proper justification. Nonetheless, the supporting material (Tables SIIA and SIIB in Roymondal et al.29) seems to confirm that the strong (r = 0.812) inverse power-law-shaped correlation observed between RCBS and E. coli gene length still applies to randomized E. coli sequences (r = 0.999*** for both tables, Supplementary Fig. S1). In spite of this, the authors chose to ignore the length dependency of RCBS in their subsequent analysis, arguing that ‘smaller sequences have a greater probability of resulting in high value of RCBS (>0.5), but there is nothing to prevent longer sequences from having high RCBS’. To analyse whether the observed effect was limited to E. coli sequences or constituted a general property of the RCBS index, here we computed RCBS for randomly generated sequences using different %GC content values (Fig. 1A) and CUBs (Fig. 1B).Distribution of RCBS values versus length for 10 000 random-coding sequences generated using (A) random 20–80% GC content and length (1–3000 bp) or (B) E. coli, H. influenzae or T. thermophilus CUB and random length (1–1500 bp).Distribution of RCBS values versus length for 10 000 random-coding sequences generated using (A) random 20–80% GC content and length (1–3000 bp) or (B) E. coli, H. influenzae or T. thermophilus CUB and random length (1–1500 bp).Our results on randomly generated sequence support the notion that RCBS has an inherent inverse power-law-shaped bias towards short sequences, regardless of %GC content (Pearson r = 0.953***, Spearman rank <U+03C1> = 0.858***) and particular CUBs (r = 0.921***, <U+03C1> = 0.820***). This length dependency is a consequence of undersampling effects in short sequences, which induce overestimation of both the f(xyz) and the f1(x), f2(y) and f3(z) terms in Equation (2). Undersampling is more pronounced in the larger space of codon frequencies [f(xyz)], leading to consistent overestimation of f(xyz) over its expected value [f1(x) · f2(y) · f3(z)]. This leads to extremely large RCBS values for short sequences and to the observed inverse power-law distribution. Our data thus confirm that the correlation between RCBS and gene length observed in E. coli can be reproduced in random sequences and is therefore intrinsic to the RCBS index. It is a mathematical artefact due to undersampling in short sequences and, as such, it cannot be attributed to natural selection or to any other evolutionary process.3.2. Analysis of RCBS on E. coli microarray expression dataIn the seminal RCBS paper, Roymondal et al. validate the RCBS index against different cDNA microarray data sets.39,40 They report very weak correlations, which they attribute to the noisy nature of microarray data. However, the most probable cause of the weak correlations observed is their use of log expression ratios, rather than log expression values, as the basis for their correlations. Using log expression ratios to evaluate a CBI might arguably make sense for the data set of Tao et al.,39 which compares log-phases on minimal and rich media, but it is clearly unjustified for the data set of Richmond et al.,40 which analyses induction of heat-shock response genes. Even in the Tao et al.39 data set, the use of log ratios can introduce undesired effects, such as a low ratio for ammonia assimilation genes, which are induced in minimal media to exploit ammonia as a nitrogen source. To correctly analyse the performance of the RCBS index on mRNA expression data, here we computed the RCBS and CAIs on the 4029 gene sequences derived from the M3D data set, and we compared their values with mRNA log copy numbers in the 31 independent controls for experiments involving E. coli K-12 in log-phase growth.The results in Fig. 2 reveal that RCBS correlates poorly with mRNA log expression values using both the Pearson (r = 0.258 ± 0.028***) and the Spearman rank (<U+03C1> = 0.299 ± 0.024***) correlation. RCBS also correlates moderately with CAI (r = 0.433***, <U+03C1> = 0.448***). In contrast, and in agreement with previous studies,14,23,24 CAI correlates moderately well with log expression values (r = 0.530 ± 0.063***, <U+03C1> = 0.467 ± 0.041***). To determine whether the poor performance of RCBS was due to its strong built-in dependency on length, we re-computed these correlations for genes with sequence lengths above 1000 bp. This led to a subset of 1541 genes in our expression data set. In this gene set, the correlation of RCBS with sequence length is extremely weak (r = -0.086***, <U+03C1> = -0.080**). Controlling for sequence length in this way reduces vastly the difference in correlation with log expression values between RCBS (r = 0.489 ± 0.054***, <U+03C1> = 0.430 ± 0.045***) and CAI (r = 0.528 ± 0.053***, <U+03C1> = 0.474 ± 0.044***) and improves their mutual correlation significantly (r = 0.870***, <U+03C1> = 0.798***). As expected, this effect is mainly due to an increase in RCBS correlation with log expression, rather than a decrease in CAIs, since CAI shows very weak correlation with length (r = 0.114***, <U+03C1> = 0.143***) on the 4029 E. coli gene set (Supplementary Fig. S2).Distribution of CAI and RCBS values versus the average of normalized log expression values over 31 independent experiments for 4029 E. coli genes.Distribution of CAI and RCBS values versus the average of normalized log expression values over 31 independent experiments for 4029 E. coli genes.The fact that for sequences over 1000-bp long, RCBS correlates well with CAI and is able to predict expression levels with similar accuracy constitutes in itself a significant result, since both methods rely on a markedly different set of assumptions. CAI estimates the deviation from the major codon bias, as derived from a set of highly expressed genes,19 whereas RCBS estimates deviation from uniformity within the sequence. The strong correlation between both indices for sequences above 1000 bp indicates that at these lengths single-sequence information is enough to properly estimate codon bias. It should be noted that this estimation is independent of the bias source and even of the sequence genomic context. RCBS is thus by construction generic and, in principle, equally suited to detect bias from different sources without assuming the existence of a major codon bias.28 In this respect, the strong correlation with CAI observed in E. coli supports the well-established notion that translational efficiency selection is the most important source for codon bias in this species.183.3. Pseudo-count correction for RCBSThe pseudo-count weight can be adjusted by observing that the RCBS dependency on length (i.e. the observed inverse power-law distribution) starts to flatten out for sequences larger than 1000 bp and that this effect is independent on the nature of the sequences analysed (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. S3). Following this observation, a pseudo-count weight (S) of 300 was used to compute RCBSPC. For S = 300, genomic pseudo-counts dominate and dampen sequence-based frequencies up to lengths near 1000 bp. From this point onwards, sequence-derived frequencies start to dominate and are able to provide reasonable estimates of codon bias, as described in the previous section. When tested against the gene expression data set, RCBSPC improved significantly the correlation with log expression values (r = 0.462 ± 0.047***, <U+03C1> = 0.415 ± 0.035***) and with CAI (r = 0.820***, <U+03C1> = 0.753***; Table 1, Supplementary Fig. S4A). Summary of RCBS, CAI and RCBSPC correlation with log expression values and with CAIFor each index, correlation values with log expression data reflect the mean and standard deviation of independent correlations with the 31 available experiments over 4149 genes.Summary of RCBS, CAI and RCBSPC correlation with log expression values and with CAIFor each index, correlation values with log expression data reflect the mean and standard deviation of independent correlations with the 31 available experiments over 4149 genes.3.4. Analysis of RCBS on E. coli protein abundance dataRoymondal et al. based their claim that selection favours codon optimization and the higher expression of smaller proteins on the good correlation observed both between RCBS and protein concentration data and between the RCBS and the CAI and E(g) indices. We have reported above that the correlation of CAI with RCBS improves significantly with the pseudo-count correction of RCBS, or when sequence length is controlled for. The same effect was observed for the correlation of RCBS with E(g) when the data from Karlin et al.18 were analysed. The correlation of RCBS with E(g) over the 96 genes analysed by Karlin et al. (r = 0.730***, <U+03C1> = 0.820***) is again improved by RCBSPC (r = 0.844***, <U+03C1> = 0.894***; Supplementary Fig. S4B). Roymondal et al. also observed that RCBS correlates better (r = 0.453***) than E(g) (r = 0.262**) with the relative molecular abundance (RMB) of 96 E. coli proteins growing on glucose minimal medium.18 Here, we tested the correlation of RCBS, RCBSPC and CAI with the log protein abundance for these same genes and for the data set of Eyre-Walker38 (45 genes).The results, summarized in Table 2, indicate that RCBS outperforms CAI and RCBSPC in both data sets, although the difference is less noticeable in the larger data set of Karlin et al. The better performance of RCBS in the protein data sets thus contradicts the results on mRNA expression data reported above. Furthermore, it is also inconsistent with the improved correlation of RCBSPC with both CAI and E(g) on both data sets. To explore the nature of this apparent discrepancy, here we tested the performance of RCBS, CAI and RCBSPC against the more recent and larger protein concentration data set of Ishihama et al.22 The results, summarized in Table 3, are in broad agreement with those obtained in the former data sets. RCBS provides again the best correlation with protein concentration (r = 0.710***, <U+03C1> = 0.588***), followed by CAI and then RCBSPC. To control for sequence length, we selected again sequences over 1000-bp long, leading to a subset of 170 genes. When controlling for sequence length in this way, the differences between RCBS and CAI become marginal. In agreement with this finding, the mutual correlation between RCBS and CAI goes up from moderate (r = 0.640***, <U+03C1> = 0.618***) in the original set to strong (r = 0.904***, <U+03C1> = 0.861***) in the >1000-bp data set. As before, the statistically significant increase in similarity between CAI and RCBS results for the >1000 data set does not stem from a worse performance of CAI (its correlation with relative protein abundance actually improves). Instead, they arise from a drop in RCBS performance, suggesting that its enhanced correlation on the whole-length data set could be due to an artefact in the protein data.

Analysis of E. coli protein abundance dataHaving shown above that RCBS presents a strong built-in bias with sequence length, the results of Table 3 strongly suggest that the observed superiority of RCBS in the protein data sets might be the result of a similar bias in the protein concentration data. To test this hypothesis, we analysed the correlation between molecular mass and log protein abundance in the data set of Ishihama et al. As it can be seen in Fig. 3, log protein abundance and molecular mass correlate quite well under an inverse power-law distribution (r = -0.429***, <U+03C1> = -0.381***). Correlation coefficients are nearly identical for the 359 subset analysed above (r = -0.439***, <U+03C1> = -0.421***), but the strength of this correlation falls dramatically in the length-controlled (>1000 bp) data set (r = -0.120, <U+03C1> = -0.182*).Distribution of emPAI-estimated log protein abundance versus molecular mass for the 1103 proteins reported by Ishihama et al.22 and the subset used in this study (359 proteins, see Materials and methods). The overall shape of the distribution is in broad agreement with the log protein abundance versus length plot reported in Fig. S7 of Ishihama et al.

The dotted line underscores the length-dependent bias in the method's lower detection limit.The results in Fig. 3 confirm that there is a strong correlation between protein molecular mass (or length) and the estimated protein concentration in the data set of Ishihama et al. Similar, albeit weaker, correlations can be observed in the Eyre-Walker (r = -0.319*, <U+03C1> = -0.492***) data set and in that of Karlin et al.18 (r = -0.214*, <U+03C1> = -0.254*). This result is significant in several ways. On the one hand, it establishes that there is a length-dependent bias in the estimation of protein concentration by three separate groups and methods.22,38 Furthermore, it suggests that this bias follows an inverse power-law distribution, strongly overestimating the concentration of smaller proteins. The causes for this bias are not easy to discern, but there are several processes that might be concurrently contributing to the observed distribution. Having established that mRNA concentration does not appear to be length-dependent (r = 0.026 ± 0.015*, <U+03C1> = 0.026 ± 0.017 on the 4029 gene sequences derived from the M3D data set; Supplementary Fig. S5), it seems likely that from a biological standpoint protein concentration can be affected by three main parameters: translation initiation and elongation rates and protein turnover.14,22,25An exponential negative correlation between protein turnover and length has been reported for yeast and higher eukaryotes,42,43 suggesting that a similar trend might be also present in prokaryotes. In addition, and regardless of codon optimization, it makes sense to assume that the amount of misreadings and frame-shifts during translation must be proportional to length. If Boolean outcomes and conditional independence are assumed for these events, the amount of properly formed protein should follow a binomial distribution, yielding exponential decay with length. Finally, methodological factors may also come into play. Protein concentration in 2D gels is assessed by measuring the average intensity of spots.25,44 Since smaller proteins diffuse more readily than larger ones, they become more difficult to detect and this introduces a systematic bias in the detection limit. Abundant small proteins are more likely to be detected than less abundant proteins of the same size. This bias is length-dependent and tends to disappear for large proteins (O'Farrell, 2009, Personal communication). The liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) techniques used by Ishihama and colleagues are in principle less sensitive to biases in their lower detection limit.45 However, it is apparent from Fig. 3 that the mass-dependent bias in protein concentration stems, at least partially, from a bias in the method's detection limit.46The identification of a negative correlation between protein concentration estimates and protein length accounts for the superior performance of RCBS in these data sets, but it also casts doubts on the validity of using protein concentration data for the evaluation of CBIs or, conversely, using these indices to estimate protein concentration. Historically, prediction of expression by CBIs has been assessed indistinctly with both mRNA21 and protein18,22,34,38 concentration data. Here, we find that for large data sets, the most well-established index (CAI) yields similar correlations (r = 0.530*** for mRNA and r = 0.590*** for protein) in E. coli. This suggests that the practice of using either type of data indistinctly, although unfounded, might be justified. Selection for translational optimization is carried out at the gene level by assessment of essential protein concentrations during log-phase growth. This means that, even without methodological biases, the non-linearity in the coupling of transcription, translation and post-translation processes imposes an upper threshold on the performance of any bias index. For instance, high turnover rates for a log-phase-required protein will select for increased codon optimization, yielding to an overestimation of protein concentration based on bias indices. On the other hand, genomic location and promoter efficiency can increase mRNA concentrations for key log-phase proteins, leading to reduced codon optimization and incorrect estimates from indices.3.6. The RCA index and its application to different reference setsAs defined above, RCA makes use of a given reference set to compute observed and expected codon frequencies. In this sense, RCA is similar to other reference-set-based indices, but most notably to CAI, since it makes use of a single reference set that can be defined following the same principles applied to CAI.19 Like CAI, RCA is also amenable to iterative algorithms designed to identify the reference set without prior biological knowledge.28,47 Since it is also defined on a reference set, RCA should not present significant length dependencies if its reference set is well-defined.26,27 There is, however, an important difference between CAI and RCA. In CAI, the relative adaptiveness of a codon (wi) is computed as the ratio between the frequency of that codon in the reference set and the largest frequency among its synonymous codons [Equation (1)]. This implicitly assumes that the background nucleotide distribution is uniform. The inability to take into account background nucleotide composition is a fundamental problem of many CBIs.27 Assuming a uniform background nucleotide composition is a major drawback for those indices relying on a uniform null hypothesis, like Nc. However, it can also skew the results of indices based on reference sets, like CAI, leading them to attribute to translational selection the patterns of mutational bias observed in the reference set.In contrast to CAI, for any given reference set, the RCA index first computes the expected frequency of a codon based on its positional base frequencies. It then measures codon adaptation as the deviation of the observed codon frequency from the expected codon frequency. Thus, RCA takes explicitly into account sequence composition in the calculation of each RCAxyz term and should be able to provide more robust and accurate estimates of gene expression. This improvement in accuracy should be more apparent in cases of high mutational bias and/or lowered selection for translational efficiency, in which CAI may easily be mislead by mutational bias artefacts in the reference set.Here, we investigated the benefits of using RCA as a CBI by establishing first the absence of a systematic bias with length and by analysing then the performance of the RCA index at predicting expression data in E. coli and M. smegmatis. For E. coli, RCA frequency computations were carried out using the original reference set (27 genes) of Sharp and Li.19 For M. smegmatis, 22 orthologues of the Sharp and Li genes were identified through reciprocal BLASTP and used to compute the relative frequencies for RCA. The presence of an intrinsic length dependency in RCA was assessed by analysing the correlation of RCA values with gene length in both E. coli and randomly generated gene sequences. As before, random gene sequences were generated both for a broad range of %GC contents or following the CUB of E. coli. Fig. 4 shows that, as expected, RCA does not present any intrinsic bias with gene length. RCA shows a slight yet significant (r = 0.122***, <U+03C1> = 0.173***) linear positive correlation with gene length for E. coli genes, but none with randomly generated gene sequence. This indicates that the observed correlation is not due to an intrinsic mathematical artefact of the RCA index. Furthermore, the observed correlation for E. coli genes is in accordance with similar correlations reported previously for CAI in E. coli and S. cerevisiae.14,37 The fact that no significant correlation with sequence length can be observed for RCA values on artificial gene sequences provides further support to the hypothesis of selection for translational efficiency in long gene sequences.37Distribution of RCA values versus length for the 4029 E. coli genes in the M3D-derived expression data set, 5000 randomly generated sequences of random length (6–6999 bp) with random %GC content in the 20 - 80% range and 5000 randomly generated sequences of random length (6–6999 bp) following the E. coli CUB. Correlation coefficients are as follows: E. coli genes (r = 0.122***, <U+03C1> = 0.173***), E. coli CUB random sequence (r = -0.0138, <U+03C1> = 0.005) and 20–80% GC random sequence (r = 0.012, <U+03C1> = 0.025).Distribution of RCA values versus length for the 4029 E. coli genes in the M3D-derived expression data set, 5000 randomly generated sequences of random length (6–6999 bp) with random %GC content in the 20 - 80% range and 5000 randomly generated sequences of random length (6–6999 bp) following the E. coli CUB. Correlation coefficients are as follows: E. coli genes (r = 0.122***, <U+03C1> = 0.173***), E. coli CUB random sequence (r = -0.0138, <U+03C1> = 0.005) and 20–80% GC random sequence (r = 0.012, <U+03C1> = 0.025).To assess the validity of RCA as a predictor of gene expression, we used CAI as a benchmark for comparison. Apart from the remaining golden standard among CBIs, CAI is based on the same set of assumptions as RCA and uses identical reference sets, thereby allowing direct comparisons between the two methods. The results in Table 4 show that even in a genome with low mutational bias like E. coli, RCA is able to slightly outperform CAI on both mRNA and protein data sets. Furthermore, the difference between both methods becomes significantly more pronounced when analysing the M. smegmatis mass spectrometry proteomic data reported by Wang et al.34 Mycobacteria present heavy mutational biases, with genomic %GC contents ranging from 57% (Mycobacterium leprae) to 67% (M. smegmatis) that have a strong effect on their CUB. However, it has been shown that translational selection can still play a significant role in the CUB of mycobacteria.48 By integrating the background base composition into its computation, RCA takes directly into account the effects of mutational bias on codon usage, allowing it to provide considerably more accurate predictions of gene expression than CAI in genomes with strong mutational bias. As shown in Table 4, this allows RCA to significantly outperform CAI in M. smegmatis, yielding correlation coefficients with expression data (r = 0.525***, <U+03C1> = 0.464***) that are remarkably close to those reported by both CAI and RCA in E. coli. The improved reliability of RCA for estimating expression levels in different organisms and contexts thus makes this index a superior choice for undertaking and benchmarking predictions of gene expression.

From a practical viewpoint, Mutation@A Glance could certainly function as a ‘one-stop’ analysis platform for newly determined DNA sequences, which enables us to readily identify and evaluate new genetic variations by integrating multiple lines of information about the disease-causing candidate genes.1. IntroductionGenetic diseases are caused by structural changes in genes and/or chromosomes. In the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=omim) database, more than 2200 genes are known to have mutations causing genetic diseases.1 For instance, primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs) are caused by congenital defects in genes involved in the development and maintenance of the immune system,2,3 and they can be diagnosed using mutation analysis that identifies pathogenic mutations in candidate PID genes. This process plays a critical role in improving the quality of life for PID patients.4 In this regard, the recent advances in DNA sequencing technology will extremely expedite this process. Thus, the next bottleneck to be addressed is obviously how to clarify the associations between newly identified patient-specific genetic variations and disease phenotypes, even when familial disease history is absent. To eliminate the bottleneck in mutation analysis, we need a bioinformatics tool that would enable us to readily evaluate the impact of a genetic variation on the structure/function of a gene product at the molecular level. Towards this end, our first step was to develop an integrated ‘one-stop’ analysis platform where we could cross-reference multiple lines of information regarding known genetic variations, including a huge amount of non-synonymous (ns) single-nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) in healthy individuals,5–7 in genes of interest.Bioinformatics resources and methods played an indispensable role in creating this platform.8–12 Although a number of databases regarding reported human disease mutations and SNPs have been already constructed,13–25 these databases were launched as a static archive for genetic variation data, not necessarily an interactive tool for evaluating newly identified sequence variation data. Several computational algorithms for predicting the effects of ns substitutions on a corresponding protein have been developed using evolutionary and protein three-dimensional (3D) structure information.26–31 However, despite public availability of these software/web servers, there are at least two hurdles, especially for clinical researchers to exploit them for the mutation analysis: (i) since these servers usually require information about the position of the genetic variation occurred in a submitted sequence as a query input, the users have to specify the variation position in the sequence before submitting the query; (ii) since these servers do not necessarily incorporate known disease-associated mutation data into their systems, the users have to manually compare their newly identified genetic variation data from patients with previously reported data. Thus, we thought it was important to integrate predictive bioinformatics tools, such as the one described above, with a comprehensive set of known genetic variation data, to create a ‘one-stop’ mutation analysis platform.32In this context, here we present Mutation@A Glance (http://rapid.rcai.riken.jp/mutation/), a new web-based integrated bioinformatics tool for analysing mutations from human genetic diseases. The user-friendly graphical interface of Mutation@A Glance makes it possible to allocate known disease-associated mutation data on the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of a gene of interest, and to link these mutation data to the 3D structure of the gene product along with various lines of information about the mutated amino acid residues (e.g. the extent of evolutional sequence conservation, post-translational modifications and molecular interactions). Furthermore, this tool enables users to identify and evaluate newly identified sequence variations in a query DNA sequence from a gene of interest by comparing them with known disease-associated mutation data and using the SIFT program,26 which is one of the most accurate and widely used program to specifically predict the effects of ns substitutions based on evolutionary information for each residue position.33 Therefore, Mutation@A Glance surely serves as a ‘one-stop’ informational platform to identify and evaluate new genetic variations by integrating multiple lines of information about the disease-causing candidate genes.2. Materials and methods2.1. Data resources for disease-associated genes and sequence variationsHuman disease-associated mutation data were obtained from the following three databases: OMIM (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/),1 UniProt (http://www.uniprot.org/)34 and RAPID (http://rapid.rcai.riken.jp/).17 Sequence variations that were associated with OMIM in the dbSNP database (Build 130, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/)18 were considered to be disease-associated mutations and other variations were considered non-disease associated. For the mutation data in the UniProt database, VARIANT features associated with diseases in the human entries were considered. RAPID is a molecular database that we have recently established for reported disease mutation data in genes causing PIDs.17 The RAPID database is directly connected to our local server and the mutation data (as of August 2009) are retrieved using a Perl script. The human genome sequence (Build 36.3), RefSeq sequences for nucleotides and proteins of human were downloaded from the NCBI ftp site (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). Information regarding residue-wise functional features (Transmembrane helix, signal peptide, nucleotide binding, disulphide bond, metal binding, active site and post-translational modification site) was extracted from the human entries in the UniProt database. Information regarding the exon–intron structures of each gene was downloaded from the NCBI ftp site.2.2. Calculation of sequence conservation in ns substitution sitesHomologous protein sequences in other organisms to the human proteins encoded by disease-causing genes were identified using the BLAST program35 against the RefSeq database (6 691 817 amino acid sequences) with a cut-off E-value of 10-4. If the sequence identity and the coverage between a sequence hit and the human were higher than 40% and 80%, respectively, the sequence was selected as a homologous sequence. When two or more sequences from an organism were found as homologous sequences, the sequence with the highest sequence identity was only considered. The homologous protein sequences from various organisms were aligned using the CLUSTAL W program.36 A degree of sequence conservation at each amino acid position in the multiple sequence alignment (simply designated as ‘residue conservation’ in Fig. 1) was defined as the ratio of (the number of the homologous protein sequences which carried an identical amino acid residue to that in the human sequence) to (the number of the aligned homologous protein sequences) at the specified position in the multiple sequence alignment. For example, if Ala appears in an aligned position in the human sequence and the corresponding positions in all of the other homologous sequences are also Ala, the residue conservation in this position is defined as 1.0. The frequency distribution of the residue conservations in disease-associated missense mutation or nsSNP positions for proteins analysed in this study was represented using bins of the interval of 0.2. The value in each bin was normalized by the frequency of the total number of residues in each bin.Comparison of frequency distributions of residue conservations in disease-associated missense mutations and nsSNPs. The vertical axis depicts the log-odds ratio of the frequency of ns substitution residue positions (disease-associated mutations or nsSNPs) to those of total number of residues in each residue conservation bin.Comparison of frequency distributions of residue conservations in disease-associated missense mutations and nsSNPs. The vertical axis depicts the log-odds ratio of the frequency of ns substitution residue positions (disease-associated mutations or nsSNPs) to those of total number of residues in each residue conservation bin.2.3. Protein 3D structure informationProtein 3D structure data were downloaded from the Protein Data Bank (PDB, http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/).37 In cases where the 3D structure of a human protein had not yet been determined, we searched the available sequences in the PDB entries for a template structure for homology modelling using the BLAST program as described above. When the alignment of the human protein sequence and a known 3D structure showed >30% identity and >90% coverage, a homology model was built using the MODELLER package.38 For each target, 20 model structures were generated and their reliabilities were assessed with the Discrete Optimized Protein Energy (DOPE) method.39 Eventually, the model with the best DOPE score was selected as the final model for each protein. Information about protein quaternary structures was also extracted from the PDB database. Entries from the PDB that contained information about the biological unit structure and entries with polypeptide chains showed >85% identities with a human protein sequence were considered. When a distance of one atom in a residue in a given polypeptide chain was <5.0 Å from that of another residue in the other polypeptide or nucleotide chain, the residue was considered to be located at a molecular interaction interface.2.4. Solvent accessibility calculationsThe solvent accessibilities of the amino acid residues in a 3D modelled structure were calculated using a modification of the Shrake and Rupley method,40 with a water molecule represented by a 1.4 Å radius sphere. The solvent accessibility is represented by values ranging from 0 to 1. The residue was considered as an exposed residue on the protein surface, if the solvent accessibility was >0.25 and buried otherwise.2.5. Disorder predictionWe used the DISOPRED2 program41 to analyse each amino acid sequence of a gene product and predict intrinsically unstructured (disordered) regions in the protein sequence. If the program predicted a region consisting of more than three amino acid residues in a sequence to be ‘disordered’, we assigned this region as an intrinsically unstructured one.2.6. Predicting the effect of ns substitutions on proteinsThe effects of ns substitutions on a given protein were evaluated on a local server using the SIFT program26 which predicts the effects of missense substitutions on a protein based on evolutionary information from homologous protein sequences.2.7. System implementationAt the server end, a set of common gateway interface programs was written in Perl and is running on an Apache web server. The information regarding the disease-associated genes and the sequence variations described above was integrated into a MySQL database implemented in the server. At the client end, JavaScript frameworks such as prototype.js (http://www.prototypejs.org/) and scriptaculous.js (http://script.aculo.us/) were used to make the user interface more interactive. Jmol, a Java applet (http://www.jmol.org/), was implemented for visualizing protein 3D structures in a web browser.3. Results and discussion3.1. Statistics of the sequence variation data on Mutation@A GlanceFrom three data resources for human disease mutations, OMIM, UniProt and RAPID, we obtained 25 616 disease-associated mutations and 21 199 nsSNPs in 2656 human genes (Table 1) and integrated into the local database. Functional classification of the proteins encoded by the disease-associated genes showed a wide variety of molecular functions such as metabolic enzymes, protein kinases, transcription factor/regulators and structural proteins (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1). Because we have been actively analysing mutations found in patients of PIDs with paediatricians in Japan, we constructed RAPID and used it as our original data resource for genetic variations in genes responsible for PIDs.17 RAPID contains manually curated mutation data from published literature, including nonsense (582 sites in 96 genes), frame-shift (851 sites in 101 genes) and insertion/deletion (85 sites in 42 genes) mutations as well as missense mutations (1564 sites in 116 genes) in the protein-coding regions of 155 PID genes (as of August 2009). For non-PID genes, we used two publicly available data sets from UniProt and OMIM. The UniProt database contains only missense mutation data (22 258 entries in 2614 genes). On the other hand, the OMIM database contains a large number of missense mutation (1899 entries in 556 genes) and a relatively small number of the other types of mutations (99 entries in 13 genes). The RAPID and the OMIM databases also contain 699 disease-associated mutation data in intronic regions of 147 genes that cause splice anomaly effects. Thus, the most frequent mutation type in our data sets was missense mutation (89% of the total entry) as reported in the previous study.13Functional classification of disease-associated gene productsaThe numbers in parentheses indicate the number of disease-associated missense mutations.Functional classification of disease-associated gene productsaThe numbers in parentheses indicate the number of disease-associated missense mutations.3.2. Evolutionary, structural and functional features of the ns substitution positionsIn general, disease-associated missense mutations tend to occur at evolutionarily conserved positions, because these positions are usually essential for the structure and/or function of a protein.26,42,43 To verify this using the up-dated data set, we compared the frequency of disease-associated missense mutation sites (19 128 unique positions in 2622 genes) in each residue conservation bin with that of nsSNP sites (20 605 positions in 2494 genes) (Fig. 1). The results indicated that the previously reported tendency was still true for the 2622 genes in our data set; the disease-associated mutation sites were preferably appeared in the highest residue conservation bin, while nsSNP sites showed the opposite trend (Fig. 1). Next, we cross-referenced amino acid positions of the disease-associated missense mutations and nsSNPs to the functional features and 3D structures of the protein data in Mutation@A Glance. We classified these positions in terms of their functional features in a protein (annotated in the UniProt databases; Table 2). More disease-associated missense mutations were found in the positions annotated to have some functional features, except in the ‘signal peptides’ and ‘post-translational modification sites’, than nsSNPs. Using a homology modelling technique, we mapped 10 939 out of 19 128 disease-associated mutation sites (57.2%) to protein 3D structures (Fig. 2). Of these sites, 6616 sites (60.4%) were located in regions buried in protein structures (solvent accessibility <0.25). In the same way, 7106 out of 20 605 nsSNP sites (34.4%) were mapped to 3D structures, and 4258 sites (59.9%) were located on the surfaces of proteins (Fig. 2A). This observation is basically consistent with the previous findings from structural analysis.44–46 Interestingly, nsSNP sites were located in regions predicted as intrinsically disordered at a three times higher frequency than disease-associated mutation sites (Fig. 2A). This might be ascribed to the observation that conservation in the intrinsically disordered regions is relatively lower than that in ordered regions.47Structural and functional loci of mutation/nsSNP sitesaAs defined in UniProt database (described in the text).Structural and functional loci of mutation/nsSNP sitesaAs defined in UniProt database (described in the text).Classification of disease-associated mutations and nsSNPs according to their location on protein 3D structure.

(B) Proportion of ns substitution positions in the disease-associated mutations or nsSNPs that were located on the interface of the experimentally determined quaternary structures.Proteins function with other molecules in molecular networks (e.g. signalling pathways) in many cases. Hence, the effects of mutations on molecular interactions must be intriguing in mutation analysis.48 We thus analysed whether or not the missense mutation positions were located in the molecular interaction sites based on the quaternary protein structures available from the PDB. Consequently, 714 out of 1738 disease-associated mutation sites (41.1%) were found to locate at the interfaces of 474 distinct proteins known to be involved in protein complex structures (Fig. 2B; see Section 2.3). In contrast, the same was true for only 346 out of 1128 nsSNP sites (30.7%) in 447 genes. We confirmed that the frequency of disease-associated mutation sites located at the molecular interaction interface was significantly higher than that of nsSNP sites by <U+03C7>2 test (P < 0.01). These results implicated that ns substitutions at positions involved in the molecular interaction tend to be disease-related as we expected.3.3. The user interface for visualizing sequence variationsFigure 3 shows the front page of the Mutation@A Glance website. It has two types of query forms, for visualizing known disease mutation data (Fig. 3A) and for evaluating novel genetic variations in query DNA sequences (Fig. 3B). For the visualization, a user inputs a given gene symbol of interest in the form. When the user enters some characters in the form, a list of gene names containing the input character string is shown to assist the user input. In addition, a user can also search for the gene name of interest from an entire list of genes available in Mutation@A Glance, which is displayed by clicking ‘Select from List’ button (Fig. 3A). Just as information for users, the mutation data set used for each gene is noted near the ‘Select from List’ button. Figure 4 shows sample screenshots for the STAT3 gene, which is known to be causative to hyper-IgE syndrome (HIES).49,50 At the DNA level, positions of the disease-associated mutations, including substitution, insertion and deletion, as well as SNPs are shown on a set of exon sequences or genomic DNA sequence with/without the open-reading frame for the gene of interest (Fig. 4A). If two or more alternative transcripts exist in the RefSeq database, the genetic variation data are allocated on the reference sequence that encodes the longest amino acid sequence among the alternative transcripts whereas all the alternative transcripts are indicated in the top panel of the genomic structure. At the protein level, the disease-associated mutation and SNP sites are highlighted in the primary structure of the gene products along with available functional annotation information of the amino acid residues from the UniProt database (e.g. enzymatic active sites and post-translational modification sites, etc.) (Fig. 4B). Information regarding conserved domain from Pfam (http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/)51 and predicted intrinsically disordered regions are also displayed. When 3D structure information for the protein is available, the positions of mutation and SNP data can be viewed on the monomer or complex 3D structures with the Jmol applet (Fig. 4B). Detailed information about nucleotide or amino acid residues of interest is displayed in another window after clicking on a residue (Fig. 4C). In particular, at the protein level, an amino acid residue becomes highlighted in the 3D structure when clicking on it (Fig. 4B). The amino acid sequence of human can be compared with those of other organisms by clicking ‘Multiple Alignment’ button (Fig. 4D). The representation of the 3D structure can be selected from two model types (ribbon or space-filling models) and three colouring types (by rainbow, highlighting mutation positions or residue conservation) (Fig. 4E). The ‘External Links’ button provides links to NCBI Entrez Gene (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=gene)52 for general information regarding the gene, Human Protein Reference Database (http://www.hprd.org/)53 for information about the gene product, GeneCards (http://www.genecards.org/),54 the Reference Database of Immune Cells (http://refdic.rcai.riken.jp/)55 for gene expression profiling data and the KEGG pathway (http://www.genome.jp/)56 for pathways involving this gene (Fig. 4F). By using this visualization facility, mapping amino acid positions of known ns substitutions on the crystal structure of the STAT3–DNA complex (PDB code: 1bg1)57 revealed that the disease-associated missense mutation residue positions were spatially located at the interface of the homodimer or at the DNA binding site, whereas the nsSNP residue positions were located on a surface outside of the molecular interaction sites (Fig. 5). This suggests that disease-causative missense mutations in STAT3 directly affect the protein–protein and/or protein–DNA interaction as reported previously.49,50 This is a good demonstration how Mutation@A Glance could help us interpret mutation effects at the molecular level.The front page of Mutation@A Glance.

Evaluating the sequence variations in query sequencesOne of the issues of diagnosis of genetic diseases is how to evaluate the pathogenicity of newly identified sequence variations. To address this issue, Mutation@A Glance has an interface that allows clinical researchers to assess the impact of an observed sequence variation in a given DNA sequence for a candidate disease-causing gene as the second query form (Fig. 3B). When a user submits DNA sequences of a candidate gene in question, this tool returns a list of sequence variations found in the input DNA sequences at both the DNA and the protein levels (Fig. 6). To identify genetic variations that occur in input DNA sequences of a given gene, the BLAT program58 is implemented to align the input DNA sequences with the reference genomic DNA sequence for the corresponding gene. Figure 6A represents the alignment status of the query sequence to the reference sequence. If a sequence variation is found, multiple lines of detailed information about the variation, such as the variation types (e.g. substitution, insertion and deletion), the mutated region (e.g. exon, intron and 5'- or 3'-splice sites constituting the GT-AG rule), the amino acid changes (e.g. missense, nonsense, insertion/deletion and frame-shift), the known variation data (disease-associated mutation and SNP) and structure/function features of the position at the protein level, are displayed based on the reference human genome sequence in the public database (Fig. 6B). Sequence alignments between the query and reference sequences are also displayed (Fig. 6C). If a ns substitution is found in the query DNA sequence, it was evaluated by the SIFT program26 (incorporated in the local system), which predicts whether amino acid substitutions in a protein will be ‘Deleterious’ or ‘Tolerated’ using evolutionary information from the homologous proteins (Fig. 6B). We tested the prediction accuracy of SIFT with our data sets of disease-associated mutations and non-disease-associated nsSNPs, and found that the false-negative rate (falsely predicted as ‘Tolerated’ for disease-associated mutations) and the false-positive rate (falsely predicted as ‘Deleterious’ for nsSNPs) were 25% and 39%, respectively. These accuracy values were comparable to those evaluated in previous study.33 The current version of Mutation@A Glance does not implement a method for quantitative evaluation of mutation effects on RNA splicing, mainly because we considered the evaluation method is not matured enough yet. However, because the evaluation of mutation effects on RNA splicing/stability is very intriguing, we will place a high priority on the implementation of the evaluation tool for genetic variations affecting RNA splicing/stability in the future development.An example of evaluating sequence variations in query STAT3 DNA sequences.

First, users are only required to have DNA sequences from a particular gene as their input and thus do not need to pre-process their submission data; other websites for evaluating the mutation effects require a list of genetic variations as a query, not raw sequence data.26–31 Secondly, Mutation@A Glance identifies and addresses multiple types of sequence variations (e.g. insertion/deletion, frame-shifts) from input query DNA sequences whereas the other web servers do not. Thirdly, newly identified genetic variations can be easily compared with known mutation and SNP data using the graphical visualization interface of Mutation@A Glance (Fig. 6D).From a viewpoint of clinical use, it is obvious that any mutation analysis platform cannot serve as a useful one without reliable mutation data sets. However, whereas large amounts of disease-associated mutation data for various genetic diseases have been reported, most of them are dispersed and stored locally. Only a few websites, e.g. OMIM and UniProt, integrate disease-associated mutation data and allow us to download their contents. However, the mutation data in such databases have a relatively low integrity in terms of updating and coverage. Thus, we have begun to comprehensively collect and manually curate the disease-associated mutation data from published literature focusing on PIDs and established a resource of PID research for clinical use, named RAPID.17 Mutation@A Glance thus uses these manually curated data sets for over 150 PID genes in the RAPID database, which is solid enough for clinical use at least for PID analysis. To make Mutation@A Glance a reliable and general mutation analysis platform for other various genetic diseases in the future, we consider that data sharing with experts in particular diseases will be highly important as in the case of PID; otherwise it would take a long time to accumulate extensive mutation data of all human disease genes to an acceptable level for clinical use. In fact, similar efforts along this direction have been being made by the research community.19As new technologies for determining genetic variation in humans have rapidly and continuously emerged (such as next generation DNA sequencing), amounts of genetic variation data of human are exponentially growing.6,7,59 Therefore, we will continue to update and improve the Mutation@A Glance system, in order to cope with the larger-scale data analysis for more comprehensive identification of disease-causative candidate genes. Implementing API programs into Mutation@A Glance for query submissions and a retrieval system through command line scripts would be more convenient for this purpose.In summary, Mutation@A Glance provides a highly integrated bioinformatics tool for mutation analysis not only for facilitating visualization of sequence variation data along with various types of information, including primary and tertiary structures of the gene products, but also for evaluating the effects of novel sequence variations in a query input DNA sequence. This tool works solely on a web browser through Internet and is open to the public. Hence, Mutation@A Glance can be used as a ‘one-stop’ integrated bioinformatics platform for analysing genotype–phenotype relationships of genetic diseases from molecular as well as clinical perspectives.Supplementary DataSupplementary Data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work is supported by a Grant-in-aid for Special Coordination Funds for Promoting Science and Technology, from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan.The authors would like to thank Drs Shigeaki Nonoyama, Kohsuke Imai, Hirokazu Kanegane, Toshio Miyawaki, Koichi Oshima, Fumihiko Ishikawa and Reiko Kikuno-Fukaya for their critical suggestions about this work.Supplementary data"

The molecular pathogenicity of leaf rust in wheat was studied and the EST data generated made a foundation for future studies.1. IntroductionLeaf rust (Puccinia triticina) is the most common rust disease in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), causing significant yield losses over large geographical areas.1 Yield losses in wheat from this rust are usually the result of a decreased number of kernels per head and lower kernel weight. Genetic resistance is the preferred method to reduce losses from leaf rust, and 60 leaf rust resistance (Lr) genes have been designated in wheat.2 Among the Lr genes, Lr1, Lr10, Lr21 and Lr34 were isolated and characterized through a map-based cloning approach.3–6 Most Lr genes confer race-specific resistance in a gene-for-gene manner. However, wheat varieties relying on race-specific resistance often lose effectiveness within a few years by imposing selection for virulent leaf rust races. High levels of virulence variation and broad adaptation of the fungus to the diverse climatic conditions where wheat is grown are characteristic of P. triticina and contribute to regular losses from leaf rust in global wheat production. Plant disease resistance and susceptibility are governed by the combined genotypes of host and pathogen and depend on a complex exchange of signals and responses occurring under given environmental conditions (for review, see Yang et al.7). During the long process of host–pathogen co-evolution, plants have developed mechanisms to defend against pathogen attack. Whereas some of these defense mechanisms are preformed and provide physical and chemical barriers that inhibit pathogen infection, others are induced only after pathogen attack. Similar to animal immune responses, induced plant defense involves a network of signal transduction and rapid activation of gene expression following pathogen infection. A key difference between the resistant and susceptible plants is the timely recognition of the invading pathogen and the rapid and effective activation of host defense mechanisms. A resistant plant is capable of rapidly deploying a wide variety of defense responses that prevent pathogen colonization. In contrast, a susceptible plant exhibits much weaker and slower responses that fail to restrict pathogen growth and/or spread. As a result, a susceptible plant is often severely damaged or even killed by pathogen infection. The activation of defense responses in plants is initiated by the host recognition of pathogen-encoded molecules called elicitors. The interaction of pathogen elicitors with host receptors (many of which may be encoded by resistance genes) likely activates a signal transduction cascade that may involve protein phosphorylation, ion fluxes, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and other signaling events. Both primary pathogen elicitors and secondary endogenous signals may activate a diverse array of plant protectant and defense genes, whose products include glutathione S-transferase, peroxidases, cell wall proteins, proteinase inhibitors, hydrolytic enzymes (e.g. chitinases and ß-1,3-glucanases), pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins and phytoalexin biosynthetic enzymes, such as phenylalanine ammonia-lyase and chalcone synthase.8Despite the impact of leaf rust pathogenesis in wheat, very little information is available at the molecular level regarding how this pathogen regulates growth, development and pathogenesis. For this reason, the identification of differentially represented genes between near-isogenic wheat lines differing in the Lr10 leaf rust resistance gene is essential to understand the biological events of the wheat–leaf rust interaction.Apart from a few species for which a complete genome sequence is already available, gene discovery in most plants is primarily based on the sample sequencing of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and the development of EST databases has been recognized as a rapid method of sampling an organism's transcriptome. In the large (16 Gb) and repetitive genome of bread wheat, the transcriptome approach is complementary to a whole genome sequencing project. We have initiated a wheat EST project in Japan and constructed cDNA libraries from various tissues and strains of wheat after various treatments.9–11 Two of the libraries were constructed to comprehensively analyze gene expression following leaf rust infection. In this study, we aimed to identify differential gene expression patterns for resistant or susceptible interactions based on the Lr10 resistance gene.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant and fungal materialThe wheat cultivars Thatcher (susceptible) and its near-isogenic line (NIL) with the leaf rust resistance gene Lr10, ThatcherLr10 (resistant), were used for this study. Thatcher is highly susceptible to leaf rust and the resistance gene (Lr10) from the resistance source cv. AC domain was transferred to the Thatcher background (NIL).12 The Swiss leaf rust race BRW 97512-19 avirulent on Lr10 was used for infection.132.2. cDNA library construction and DNA sequencingTotal RNA was extracted 20 h after infection with leaf rust isolate BRW 97512-19 (AvrLr10) at the seedling stage (10 days old) of susceptible and resistant cultivars. Two cDNA libraries were constructed using the pBluescript SK II (+) vector in Escherichia coli DH10B. For libraries derived from resistant and susceptible interactions, 30 307 and 24 701 clones, respectively, were randomly selected and sequenced from both the 5' and 3' ends of the inserts.2.3. Data processing and computational methodsChromatogram files of the two libraries were separated into forward (5') and reverse (3') raw sequences, and the orientation was incorporated by a PERL script we designed. Base calling was done using the Phred program.14 The vector sequence was removed by the crossmatch program (-minmatch 20, -minscore 20). Repeat and ambiguous sequences (Phred quality values <30) were eliminated using our PERL script. Poly(A) tails or poly(T) sequences (at most 10 bases) in the ESTs were processed. Subsequently, ESTs with sequences <30 bp were omitted from the final data set. The remaining high-quality sequences were used for further study and are available from the DNA Database of Japan (accession numbers CJ872808–CJ919993).2.4. EST assemblyThe processed ESTs from susceptible and resistant libraries were combined and assembled into contigs using the CAP3 program15 at a high stringency level of 95% homology in a 20-bp overlap. The contigs were then classified into a susceptible and a resistant group based on the total EST members assembled from the susceptible and resistant libraries. Local gene cluster (BLAST) was performed by including the Lr10 and other published resistance genes with the parameters of -b 10, -v 10, -e 1e-40.2.5. Gene annotationUsing the BLAST program (blastx with a search threshold of 1e-5), the sequences of the contigs were searched against the T. aestivum gene index from DFCI16 and the amino acid sequence databases from NCBI (nr) and UniProt. Gene ontology (GO) terms17 for contigs were derived by InterProScan software18 and converted to GO Slim terms by a custom-built PERL script.2.6. Reverse transcription–PCRSusceptible and resistant seedlings were grown under 16 h light at 20°C and 8 h dark at 16°C with 70–80% humidity for 10 days. Seedlings were infected with leaf rust spores of the avirulent isolate BRW 97512-19 on Lr10 after 10 days and maintained overnight at 16°C with 90% humidity in the dark, followed by normal growth conditions. The leaf samples were collected at time points of 0, 8, 16, 20 and 48 h after infection and RNA was extracted. cDNA from each sample was synthesized from 1 µg of total RNA and reverse transcription–PCR (RT–PCR) was carried out.3. Results3.1. Library construction and DNA sequencingTwo NILs of hexaploid wheat infected with leaf rust and differing in the leaf rust resistance gene Lr10 were used for library construction. For the resistant and susceptible libraries, 30 307 and 24 701 randomly selected clones were sequenced from both the 3' and 5' ends. In all, 55 008 sequences were generated, and after trimming for low quality, shortness (<90 bp) and vector contamination, 39 928 of those sequences were used for assembly. The overall sequencing success rate, i.e. useful sequences out of the total sequenced, was 72.5%. The length of good-quality sequences varied between 40 and 860 bp, with an average of 354 bp. The good-quality ESTs from the two libraries were combined (39 928 ESTs) and assembled into 6042 contigs and 8226 singlets. The number of ESTs forming each contig varied between 2 and 556, and the average ESTs grouped into contigs varied from 2 to 5 (Fig. 1). The number of specific unigene sequences for each library was calculated (only for contigs). The library-specific sequences can be considered an estimation of the capacity to provide new genes. The contribution of individual libraries to the total unigene set was 36% for resistant and 31% for susceptible, indicating that each library contained specific ESTs (Fig. 2).EST distribution in each class of contigs.EST distribution in each class of contigs.Venn diagram showing the number of susceptible, resistant and common genes expressed during leaf rust infection in susceptible and resistant samples.Venn diagram showing the number of susceptible, resistant and common genes expressed during leaf rust infection in susceptible and resistant samples.3.2. Sequence annotation and analysiscDNA libraries were constructed from susceptible and resistant cultivars after leaf rust infection with the goal of obtaining a diverse collection of ESTs representing a range of molecular functions. Unigenes were annotated using a T. aestivum gene index for gene searches, UniProt for protein searches and InterProScan for GO terms. To ensure the highest recovery of annotation, we submitted all unigenes derived from contigs and singletons for analysis. In total, 6004 sequences had no BLAST hit with an E value of =10-5. Out of these, 4506 sequences contained one or more predicted open reading frames of at least 75 amino acids. The sequences that have coding potential but do not share significant homology to deposited sequences could represent genes unique to wheat or the leaf rust pathogen.In the process of functional annotation of the putative-encoded proteins, unigenes were classified into biological, molecular and cellular function-based GO terms. When analyzed by biological process, the majority of annotations (31%) were involved in metabolism, followed by cellular process (25%). The remainder (44%) were distributed among several processes, including housekeeping functions, growth and the regulation of development (Fig. 3a).Functional annotation of contig sequences based on GO categorization. Sequences were evaluated for their predicted involvement in a biological process (a), molecular function (b), and cellular localization (c).Functional annotation of contig sequences based on GO categorization. Sequences were evaluated for their predicted involvement in a biological process (a), molecular function (b), and cellular localization (c).The class of proteins ‘catalytic and binding activities’ comprised over 50% of the total number of molecular functions identified by GO analysis (Fig. 3b). In addition to this general molecular process, hydrolases, transferases and oxidoreductases were identified. Hydrolases, which utilize water molecules to break chemical bonds, perform a broad range of functions in fungi, including the extracellular digestion of complex carbon sources such as cellulose and other components of plant cell walls. Oxidoreductases catalyze the transfer of electrons between molecules and, in fungi, are involved in primary and secondary metabolism as well as the detoxification of compounds such as ROS, superoxide and hydrogen peroxide. Intriguingly, these same compounds are frequently associated with the oxidative burst component of plant defense.19 Although it is reasonable to propose that oxidoreductases of fungal foliar pathogens could be involved in detoxification of ROS during pathogenesis, such a relationship has not been demonstrated in wheat.The vast majority of annotated sequences are predicted to encode cellular and intracellular proteins (Fig. 3c). However, nearly 1% of sequences were categorized by GO annotation as comprising external encapsulating structures, defined as any constituent of a structure that lies outside the plasma membrane and surrounds the entire cell.20 Unlike bacteria, filamentous fungi generally produce highly hydrophobic proteins (collectively referred to as hydrophobins) rather than polysaccharide capsules as a protective barrier against the environment.3.3. Genes derived from the leaf rust pathogenTo estimate the proportion of fungal ESTs in the libraries used in the present study, the unigenes were also compared with a P. graminis f.sp. tritici database (http://www.broadinstitute.org/annotation/genome/pucciniagroup/Multihome.html). The BLAST comparison detected only a few genes from the susceptible sample. Consistent with the findings of many fungal EST projects, a substantial number of sequences could not be annotated due to either a lack of BLAST hits or hits to uncharacterized fungal sequences.21,22 Of the sequences with BLAST hits, well over half could not be annotated due to a general lack of knowledge regarding the specific molecular functions of many fungal genes. However, a recent review23 and other studies24,25 have reported a comprehensive view of genes from leaf rust and related pathogens. Among these genes, chitinase, catalase, ß-tubulin, thiazole and 40S ribosomal sequences were found in this study and were derived mainly from the susceptible sample. Twenty-eight unigenes encode fungal ribosomal protein, presumably indicative of active protein synthesis during the infection process. A cDNA-AFLP approach at several time points after wheat inoculation with leaf rust identified the chitinase gene.24 The chitinase gene had homology to the same gene from the bean rust Uromyces fabae, which is induced in haustoria.26 Recently, an EST database was developed representing each of several life-cycle stages of P. triticina.24 The presumed fungal cDNAs encoded proteins involved in general metabolism, protein synthesis and transport and stress- or virulence-related proteins (e.g. chitinase, catalase, ß-tubulin and thiazole). In addition, a few genes were homologous to gene encoding virulence factors in other fungi or that are induced during infection with other fungal pathogens.3.4. Highly differentially expressed sequencesConsensus sequences consisting of ESTs found exclusively or predominantly in either susceptible or resistant libraries could reveal molecular mechanisms involved in regulating fungal development or the resistance reaction, and the library-to-library distribution of ESTs corresponding to a single cluster offers at least a qualitative measure of gene expression. The consensus sequences that consisted of at least 10 ESTs that were substantially enriched in either the susceptible or resistant library were defined as highly differentially expressed sequences (HDESs). Twenty-five and 24 consensus sequences from resistant and susceptible libraries, respectively, met those criteria (Tables 1 and 2). Three of the resistant-specific HDESs returned no hits after a BLAST search, indicating that these sequences may be unique resistance genes in wheat. The GO terms for 12 resistant genes were not identified, showing that these sequences may be specific to leaf rust infection in wheat. The further study on the molecular function of individual genes will give the clear result. The others, wali5, thioredoxin, barley 14-3-3 protein, wrsi5-1 protein, peroxisomal membrane protein, glutamate dehydrogenase, ADP-ribosylation protein, Tubby-like F-box protein genes and other cell wall-specific genes, were found in resistant samples. Three unknown function HDESs were identified in susceptible samples, indicating these sequences may be unique to the fungal pathogen or to the self-defense mechanism in wheat. In contrast to the resistant genes, only four susceptible genes were resulted without GO terms. But the study of those genes will give further understanding of susceptible mechanism in plants. In addition to multiple genes of chlorophyll a/b-binding protein, brown plant hopper (BPH)-induced resistance protein, wheat ribulose-1,5-biphosphate carboxylase, caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (OMT), senescence-associated protein, O-acetylserine lyase, calreticulin-like protein and PR protein were found in susceptible samples. When comparing the compatible (susceptible) and incompatible (resistant) genes in terms of its molecular function showed the catalytic and binding activities in common, but the action of oxidative burst was specific to the resistant sample. The striking event occurred early after pathogen infection is the rapid production and accumulation of ROS, such as  and H2O2, known as the oxidative burst.19 Elicitation of the oxidative burst by pathogen elicitors appears to be mediated by multiple signal cascades in addition to oxalate oxidase and cell wall peroxidase genes.27 The enrichment of ESTs corresponding to a specific cluster sequence in one set of libraries over the other could reflect differences in reaction mechanism against the leaf rust pathogen. To correlate the occurrence and distribution of ESTs with levels and patterns of gene expression, RT–PCR was performed. Four resistant and four susceptible group genes were selected and their expression was studied in resistant and susceptible samples collected in the same time course after infection (Fig. 4). The genes were chosen based on their role in plant defense against biotic or abiotic stress. The 14-3-3 protein gene is found in all eukaryotes and functions by interacting directly with numerous target proteins, thereby altering their activity.28 The wali5 gene has been identified for its role in aluminum tolerance in wheat.29 Actin-depolymerization factor and ADP-ribosylation factor genes have been reported as resistance genes in other crops.30 BPH resistance protein, identified in susceptible samples, contains a CBS domain. In rice, a CBS domain containing gene (OsBi1) is induced in response to herbivore feeding.31 Another gene, caffeic acid OMT, responded differently in susceptible samples in different time period. The induction of an OMT gene by wounding or pathogen invasion suggests the deposition of lignin, which provides a barrier for protection of tissues from damage. Two other susceptible genes are PR and senescence-associated DIN1 protein.32,33Functional annotation of unigenes expressed in resistant sampleCt, contig; Res, resistant; Sus, susceptible.Functional annotation of unigenes expressed in resistant sampleCt, contig; Res, resistant; Sus, susceptible.Functional annotation of unigenes expressed in susceptible sampleCt, contig; Res, resistant; Sus, susceptible.Functional annotation of unigenes expressed in susceptible sampleCt, contig; Res, resistant; Sus, susceptible.Gene expression studies of candidate genes.

We took advantage of these two libraries not being normalized to compare their gene expression. Owing to the relatively thorough sampling approach, the frequency of ESTs in a given library can be used to obtain information on relative gene expression levels in the tissues from which the library was constructed.34 Table 3 lists the potential wheat–leaf rust interaction genes, showing differences in the EST members assembled from the susceptible and resistant libraries. On the basis of the number of ESTs, the genes were further classified as resistance, susceptible and common genes. In the resistance group, the most abundant contig members were found in proton ATPase followed by calcium-binding protein. Various fungal elicitors have been reported to trigger fluxes of protons across the plasma membrane.35 Sequences related to resistance to pathogens (proteinase inhibitors and the specific Bowman–Birk type wound-induced proteinase inhibitors) and to detoxification (ABC transporter), which play a major role in plant–pathogen defense, were encountered. Genes related to cell wall biosynthesis and metabolism, such as cysteine proteinase, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, plasma membrane ATPase and chalcone synthase, were also found and may be related to resistance mediated by alteration of plant cell wall composition. CDP and MAP kinases were the signal transduction genes found in the resistance reaction. In susceptible reaction, mainly genes with functions related to the oxidative burst (glutathione S-transferase, peroxidase and oxalate oxidase) were found. Different groups of transcription factors (Myb, WRKY, EREB/AP2, bZIP) and sequences related to responses against pathogens (receptor-like kinase, GTP-binding protein, RING finger protein, cytochrome P450, LRR, PR protein, G-box binding protein, STAR-related lipid transfer protein and starch synthase) were involved in both the susceptible and resistant samples infected with the leaf rust pathogen. Among these, STAR-related lipid transfer and RING finger protein have been reported as candidate genes for the Lr34 locus.6Wheat–leaf rust interaction genesThe contigs were grouped based on their function related to plant pathogenesis.

DiscussionGenetic studies of leaf rust resistance in wheat have been conducted by wheat researchers worldwide. In this study, we aimed to identify host–pathogen relationships between susceptible vs. resistant wheat and leaf rust (P. triticina). For this purpose, EST libraries were constructed from the leaf rust susceptible (Thatcher) and the resistant NIL for Thatcher containing the Lr10 gene. This represents an ideal situation for comparative transcriptome studies in hexaploid wheat.23 The EST sequencing approach is of particular interest in organisms for which very little sequence data are available. As far as is known, the wheat–leaf rust interaction data presented here are therefore the first effort in sequencing of the expressed genome aimed at understanding leaf rust disease. An overview for the unigene development methodology is presented in Fig. 5. A unigene set of 17 268 sequences was generated from 39 928 high-quality sequences and showed a redundancy of ~35%, a value corresponding to the expected level compared with other published works. Equivalent or lower redundancy levels have been reported in wheat (http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/NSF/library_redundancy.html), whereas other published libraries showed higher levels of redundancy, such as 72.5% in Lotus japonicas.36 To reach a high quality of annotation and to avoid error propagation,37 the EST clusters were annotated systematically using a semi-automated approach, in which a functional annotation is assigned after human examination of the results of various automated analyses, as described by Journet et al.38 Using this classification scheme, a putative functional category could be assigned to ~89% of the unique sequences. The most prevalent categories were the metabolic and cellular processes in biological function and catalytic and binding activities in molecular processes. This result could be correlated with the higher level of sequences related to plant reaction to the pathogen. But the difference between the susceptible and resistant samples against the pathogen was the generation of ROS in later case. The generation of ROS is likely dependent on the cultivation of a plasma membrane NADPH oxidase similar to that present in mammalian phagocytes. Two distinct phases of ROS production have been observed during plant–pathogen interaction. The first burst occurs within minutes in both susceptible and resistant interaction, whereas the second, sustained burst occurs within a few hours of infection and only in a resistant interaction.39Flow chart for EST assembly and analysis.Flow chart for EST assembly and analysis.For the libraries constructed from plants infected by leaf rust, in particular for the susceptible library, pathogen tissue was not separated from host tissue. Therefore, it could be expected that a portion of the sequences derived from this library was of fungal, not wheat, origin. Therefore, the proportion of fungal ESTs in the present libraries was estimated. Only a few sequences from the susceptible library demonstrated a high probability of corresponding to leaf rust genes, which represents only 0.05% of the susceptible sequence set, less than the proportion of ESTs of fungal origin observed in a similar analysis from citrus-Phytophthora and cacao-Moniliopthora perniciosa interaction.40,41 These data suggest that only a small fraction of the sequences obtained from the pathogen-challenged libraries were derived from the pathogen.By examining sequences to the total unigene, it was possible to identify ~25 HDESs each related to the susceptible and resistant plant–pathogen interactions (Fig. 6). Out of 25 unigenes in the resistant interaction, three were new and four were previously identified wheat genes. wali5, wrsi5-1, WAP1 and actin-depolymerization factor were identified as abiotic stress responsive genes in wheat.29,30,42 This observation suggests the different stress-signaling pathways are also cross-talking with each other, which can lead plants to cross-tolerance. Cross-tolerance is defined as a biological phenomenon by virtue of which a plant that is resistant to one stress is able to develop tolerance to another form of stress.43 Capiati et al.44 reported that wounding increases salinity tolerance in tomato plants, suggesting cross-talk between these stresses. The resistance-specific expression of wali5 and the actin-depolymerization factor gene was confirmed by RT–PCR. Actin-depolymerization factor family members can be described as stimulus-responsive modulators of actin cytoskeleton dynamics. Several cellular processes are associated with the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in plants. Actin filaments are tightly linked to the plasma membrane and are believed to be involved in signal transduction events in plants.45 14-3-3 protein was another gene confirmed through the expression study. This protein comprises a family of highly conserved proteins with central roles in many eukaryotic signaling networks28 (Fig. 6). In barley, 14-3-3 transcripts accumulate in the epidermis when leaves are inoculated with the fungus causing powdery mildew (Erysiphe graminis f.sp. tritici); they bind to and activate plasma membrane proton ATPase, and they create a binding site for the phytotoxin fusicoccin.46A simple pathway for leaf rust interaction in wheat.

Recent work to identify ESTs involved in a rice–rice blast fungus interaction found that transcription of photosynthetic genes, such as ribulose 1,5-diphosphate carboxylase and chlorophyll a/b-binding genes, was suppressed in both the susceptible and resistant interaction.47 Here, we observed the more expression only in the susceptible sample that showed the unique interaction in wheat. Among the HDESs, the expression of four unigenes in susceptible samples was confirmed by RT–PCR. The CBS domain containing BPH-induced protein contained the highest numbers of ESTs from the susceptible library. Many unknown protein members in rice that correlate with abiotic stress tolerance contain the CBS domain and are differentially regulated in contrasting genotypes of rice, indicating their probable role in both biotic and abiotic stress responses.48 A gene involved in the synthesis of molecules such as alkaloids (caffeic acid 3-OMT) was found in the susceptible unigene, which may be correlated with the higher content of caffeine and tannins in infected plants than in uninfected ones observed by Scarpari et al.49 In studies of plant–pathogen interactions, special attention has focused on OMT, which is involved either in formation of precursors of lignin50 or in synthesis of the diverse group of antimicrobial secondary metabolites called phytoalexins.51 The enzymatic activity of both classes of OMTs has been shown to increase as a response to infection attempts by pathogens or to elicitor treatments, and, in some cases, accumulation of the corresponding gene transcripts in reacting plant tissues has been reported.52 Thus, the activity of specific OMTs apparently plays an important role in plant responses to pathogens. In addition, the OMT identified in this study is a new class of OMT in wheat differed from other reported OMTs (data not shown). Senescence-associated and PR proteins expressed in response to pathogen attack were encountered and confirmed by RT–PCR. Similar observation of PR gene expression was observed in wheat seedlings infected with E. graminis f.sp. tritici. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/UniGene/library.cgi?ORG=Ta&LID=12158). The accumulation of PR protein is one of the best-characterized plant defense responses. In monocots, several homologs of the dicot PR genes have been identified. In particular, PR1 and PR2 homologs have been characterized in wheat and found to be induced in both incompatible and compatible interactions with E. graminis.32 Here, we observed PR1.2 protein expression only in susceptible or compatible reaction showing activation of the systemic acquired response. Finally, it is important to note that some other genes—with functions not related to plant–pathogen interaction, genes of unknown function or genes without homology—may also be differentially represented and may play a role in the wheat–leaf rust interaction, although they were not analyzed here.41 A simple pathway was illustrated in Fig. 6 to show the molecular pathogenesis reaction of susceptible and resistant wheat lines against the leaf rust. It indicated that incompatible and compatible interactions share signaling pathways but should be induced at different times. A resistant plant is capable of rapidly deploying a wide variety of defense responses that prevent pathogen colonization. In contrast, a susceptible plant exhibits much weaker and slower responses that fail to restrict pathogen growth and/or spread. To determine if this is the case between wheat and leaf rust as well, additional expression profiling experiments over a broader time span should need to be performed.On the basis of the great number of genes identified in the present study, a large-scale analysis of the expression of candidate genes has been investigated. The uniformity of the genetic background used in this study to compare susceptible and resistant reaction mechanisms against leaf rust has resulted in data with a level of detail comparable to microarray studies.In conclusion, the ESTs generated in this study provide a good tool for more studies to understand the resistant and susceptible interactions of wheat and leaf rust. Functional annotation and expression profiling implicate subsets of genes in compatibility and incompatibility of leaf rust in wheat. Genes involved in signal transduction, scavenging of ROS and other abiotic stress-related genes are strongly implicated as key determinants in wheat against incompatible pathogenic fungi. Especially, the future study of signal transduction role played by the 14-3-3 gene by interacting with other signal cascade proteins will give new insight from this research. In compatible reaction, the role of new class of OMT, which is involved in lignin biosynthesis and cell wall fortification, is important for future research. Extensive studies on other related genes have helped to understand their role in leaf rust infection in wheat. Many new genes have been identified that can be useful for future studies. The sequences may also be a source of single-nucleotide polymorphisms or simple sequence repeats for molecular marker development.FundingThis work was supported by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research on priority areas ‘Comparative Genomics’ and the National Bio-resource Project from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan.

Thus introns and exon-shuffling could have had an important role in the acquisition of chloroplast targeting signals in E. gracilis. The results are consistent with a late origin of photosynthetic euglenids.1. IntroductionEuglena gracilis belongs to the order Euglenida, the protist phylum Euglenozoa, and the eukaryotic supergroup Excavata. The phylum Euglenozoa includes also the orders Kinetoplastida (including suborders Trypanosomatina and Bodonina) and Diplonemida. The monophyly of Euglenozoa has been suggested based on various common morphological features, e.g. discoidal mitochondrial cristae and a characteristic feeding apparatus,1,2 and on molecular phylogenies.3 Moreover, Euglenozoa share the presence of the modified base ‘J’ in the nuclear DNA.4 There is little evidence for the presence of signalling pathways regulating nuclear gene expression at the transcriptional level.5,6 The addition of non-coding capped spliced-leaders to nuclear pre-mRNAs via trans-splicing is also common among Euglenozoa.7–12Euglena gracilis and other phototrophic euglenids possess chloroplasts surrounded by three membranes.13 These arose by a secondary endosymbiotic event in which an euglenozoan host engulfed a green alga.14–16 Chlorarachniophytes (belonging to the supergroup Rhizaria) possess complex green plastids with four envelope membranes and nucleomorph, obtained via an independent secondary symbiosis.17 While plastids of euglenids descended from a prasinophyte, chlorarachniophyte plastids most likely descended from an ulvophyte green algal endosymbiont.18Many Euglena nuclear genes, mostly of symbiont (i.e. resulting from endosymbiotic gene transfer from the nucleus of the primary host cell to the nucleus of the secondary host cell), but also of host or other origin have acquired presequences for chloroplast targeting. Most presequences required for chloroplast import in Euglena are tripartite, comprising in order: N-terminal signal peptide for targeting to ER, the S/T-rich region resembling transit peptides of organisms possessing primary plastids, and the stop-transfer sequence serving as a membrane anchor (class I proteins, comprising also thylakoid-lumen-targeted class IB proteins possessing an additional hydrophobic thylakoid transfer domain).19–22 Therefore, the major part of the protein precursor stays ‘outside’ while passing through ER, Golgi apparatus, and membrane vesicles prior to their fusion with the outermost chloroplast membrane.19–21 A recent in-depth analysis of E. gracilis presequences revealed another set, the class II of nucleus-encoded plastid protein precursors.22 These lack the putative stop-transfer sequence and possess only a signal sequence at the N-terminus, followed by a transit-peptide-like sequence.22The complete sequence of the E. gracilis chloroplast genome disclosed an unusually high number of introns: groups II and III introns, and even twintrons (introns within introns).23 However, little is known about introns in nuclear genes of euglenids, as only few genomic sequences from euglenids are available. Introns in the E. gracilis Lhcbm1 gene (according to the nomenclature of Koziol and Durnford,24 encoding light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b binding protein of photosystem II), RbcS genes (encoding small subunit of RuBisCo), and GapC (encoding cytosolic glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) do not possess consensus splicing borders (5'-GT/AG-3') and structural characteristics of group I and II introns, and many of them are flanked by short direct repeats.25–27 These introns can form secondary structure, which could potentially bring together 5'- and 3'-ends, probably without the involvement of spliceosomes.25–28 However, E. gracilis contains also canonical introns, e.g. the 16 introns of the TubC genes (two gene copies encoding gamma-tubulin)28 or the introns in the fibrillarin gene.29,30 The 5'-ends of these introns can potentially base pair with U1 snRNA, suggesting that they are excised in a spliceosome-dependent manner.29 Introns with GT/AG borders are present also in the beta-tubulin gene of the non-photosynthetic euglenoid flagellate Entosiphon sulcatum.9 Furthermore, introns in E. gracilis TubA and TubB genes (encoding alpha- and beta-tubulin, respectively) are of conventional as well as of non-conventional type.28Recombination events and exon-shuffling have been discussed by various authors as possibly involved in the addition of sequences encoding transit peptides (mitochondrial targeting signals) to nuclear genes for mitochondrial proteins.31–34 In an analogous manner, sequences encoding stroma-targeting peptides might have been added to nucleus-encoded genes for chloroplast proteins in organisms (Archaeplastida) possessing primary chloroplasts of cyanobacterial origin. Such exon-shuffling could occur via recombination processes mediated by introns. However, the identification of introns originally involved in exon-shuffling is problematic for nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins, and for nuclear genes for proteins targeted to primary chloroplasts. The mitochondria arose via an alpha-proteobacterial endosymbiosis, which perhaps dates back to the origin of eukaryotes,35,36 and the cyanobacterial ancestry of primary plastids dates back to the origin of the Archaeplastida.37,38 Since then many intron integration/excision events occurred in various lineages39,40 making it almost impossible to identify introns, which were ancestrally involved in the acquisition of transit peptides. However, the secondary chloroplasts are the results of relatively recent endosymbioses of red and green algae in eukaryotic hosts (for reviews see refs 41–45). It has been suggested that recombination processes might have led to addition of presequences (or at least their parts) to nuclear genes for chloroplast proteins in organisms possessing secondary plastids.46,47 Perhaps the best evidence so far for the involvement of recombination processes mediated by introns in the acquisition of presequences and/or their parts came from the study of Kilian and Kroth48 which revealed the presence of a single intron either within the presequence region or shortly downstream of it in seven nucleus-encoded genes for plastid proteins (AtpC, FbaC1, PetJ, PsbM, PsbO, PsbU and Tpt1) in the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum possessing four-membrane-bounded plastids of red algal origin. In this study, we decided to extend this hypothesis to the flagellate E. gracilis possessing secondary chloroplasts of green algal origin.2. Materials and methodsEuglena gracilis (Pringsheim strain Z, SAG 1224–5/25 Collection of Algae, Göttingen, Germany) was cultivated in 100 ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 50 ml of a modified Cramer and Myers medium49 supplemented with ethanol (0.8%) and adjusted to pH 6.9. Medium was inoculated with 5 × 104 cells per ml. Cells were grown at 27°C with continuous illumination (30 µmol photons m-2 s-1). Cultures in the exponential growth phase were used for DNA isolation.The protocol for genomic DNA isolation was used as described in the chapter 2.3.1. (Preparation of Genomic DNA from Plant Tissue) of Current Protocols in Molecular Biology50 with following modification: cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1000 × g (3 min), then washed twice with ice-cold ddH2O, and resuspended with buffer (100 mM Tris–Cl, pH 8; 100 mM EDTA, pH 8; 250 mM NaCl) containing 8 µl of proteinase K (Merck, 20 mg/ml) per 1 ml of buffer. 20% N-lauroylsarcosine (Sigma) was added and the mixture was incubated in waterbath at 55°C for 1 h. After the steps of extractions, centrifugation (6000 × g, 30 min, 4°C), DNA precipitation (2-propanol), centrifugation (7500 × g, 15 min, 4°C) and solubilization (TE buffer, pH 8), RNA was removed (RNase A, 15 min). Thereafter, phenol:chloroform (1:1) and chloroform:isoamylalcohol (24:1) extractions were performed each followed by centrifugation (7500 × g, 7 min). One-tenth volume of 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) was added to the top phase, and DNA was precipitated with 96% ethanol at -20°C, centrifuged (8000 × g, 15 min, 4°C) and washed (70% ethanol). DNA was resuspended in the TE buffer (pH 8).Primers were derived from six E. gracilis nuclear mRNA sequences encoding chloroplast proteins. Table 1 contains the accession numbers of these mRNAs (see refs 19, 26, 51–54) and the corresponding positions of primer sequences. Another four pairs of primers were derived from four E. gracilis nuclear EST sequences (see ref. 22) encoding chloroplast proteins: PetF (ferredoxin), PsaF subunit of photosystem I, and the PsbM and PsbW subunits of photosystem II. All these four ESTs possessed SL-leader sequence (TTTTTTTCG) at the 5'-end, and were used in previous analysis of presequences of E. gracilis.22 Table 2 contains the e-values, accession numbers of these ESTs used for the design of primers, and the positions corresponding to primer sequences in these ESTs. List of primers derived from E. gracilis mRNA sequencesaPrimers were derived from mRNA sequences of nucleus-encoded genes (Eno29, GapA, Pbgd, PetA, PetJ and PsbO) for chloroplast proteins (enolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, porphobilinogen deaminase, cytochrome f, cytochrome c6, and 30 kDa protein of the oxygen-evolving complex, respectively).bNumber of reference in the reference list in which the corresponding mRNA was characterized.cAccesion numbers of mRNAs.d,eThe numbers of primers correspond to the positions in mRNA sequences that can be found under the accession numbers (accession number) listed in the third column.

The effort was made to design primers such as to be able to amplify the whole presequence-encoding region and short part downstream of it (or as long part of this region as possible following our stringent primer design criteria).The PCRs were performed in 50-µl reaction volume with the final concentration of Mg2+, primers and dNTPs as 2 mM, 0.2 µM and 0.5 mM, respectively. 100 ng of total E. gracilis DNA and 2.5 Units of Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) were used per reaction. Samples were denatured by heating for 5 min at 94°C, subjected to 34 cycles of 30 s denaturation at 94°C, 1 min annealing at 58°C, and 2 min extension at 72°C, and a final cycle of 8 min at 72°C. PCR products were visualized on 1.5% agarose gels (TAE), purified using QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagene), and sequenced twice (using forward as well as reverse primers) using ABI 3130xl Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) and the BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems) according to suppliers’ protocols. The services of the Department of Molecular Biology (Faculty of Natural Sciences, Comenius University, Bratislava, Slovakia) were used for sequencing of PCR products.The sequence data were analyzed using Chromas, BLAST and CLUSTAL W. Sequence identity of the intron sequences was computed by the global alignment (Needle tool from the EMBOSS suite with the default settings).55 Since the introns have unusual nucleotide composition, which may have inflated the scores, the statistical significance of each alignment score was computed by a permutation test. For each pair of introns, 100 000 random permutations of their bases were aligned, and the empirical distribution of scores was computed. Sequences were permuted by Shuffleseq from the EMBOSS suite,55 and the consensus splice sites (GT/AG) were kept in their original position in each permutation.3. Results and discussionThe PCR products amplified using all primers were listed in Tables 1 and 2 (except those for Pbgd, PsbO, and PsbW) and total E. gracilis DNA as a template were about 50 bp longer than those expected for cDNA templates. In the cases of Pbgd, PsbO, and PsbW, PCR products were about 150, 90, and 250 bp longer, respectively.Sequencing of seven PCR products revealed that each contained one 41–50 bp intron. The Pbgd PCR product contained three introns (48, 46, and 50 bp), the PsbO PCR product contained one 93 bp intron, and the PsbW PCR product contained two introns (48 and 195 bp). It is noteworthy, that the 195 bp psbW-i2 intron is present downstream of the stop codon in the 3'-UTR of PsbW gene. Thus the total number of introns identified in this study was 13. Except for the PsbO, PetJ, and the intron present in PsbW 3'-UTR, all introns are 45–50 bp in size and contain typical eukaryotic GT/AG consensus splicing borders (see Table 3 which also includes the accession numbers of the partial gene sequences containing introns identified in this study).

Nt position is the position downstream of which the intron is inserted into the corresponding mRNA or EST sequence (for the accession numbers of mRNAs and ESTs see Tables 1 and 2).It was impossible to determine borders and phase of the 93 bp-long intron in the PsbO gene, because it does not contain consensus borders, and TG sequence is present in mRNA, but also on both intron–exon borders. The splicing borders of intron in PsbO may be TG/TT, GA/TT or AC/TG. Similar problems with the determination of intron borders have been described for the Lhcb gene-encoding LHCPII protein,25 and for GapC-encoding cytosolic glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase,26 because the introns in these genes are flanked by short direct repeats (2–5 bp) and do not possess consensus splicing borders. The 41 bp intron in the PetJ gene also does not show consensus splicing borders. A guanine nucleotide is present on both its intron–exon borders, thus its splicing borders might be GT/TC or TT/CG, and it is either in phase 1 or 2.With the exception of the 195 bp intron in PsbW (psbW-i2, with GA/GT splicing borders and no direct repeat on intron–exon borders), all introns identified in this study are present either within the second half of the presequence-encoding region or shortly downstream of it. The 48 bp intron in Eno29 gene (eno29-i1) is present between the amino acid positions 166 and 167 of Eno29 mRNA (accession number AJ272112), while presequence-encoding region ends with the position 161 of this mRNA sequence. The 50 bp gapA-i1 was localized between the codons for aa 90 and 91 of the 127 aa GapA presequence. Sharif et al.51 reported a 139 aa presequence for Pbgd, whereas Durnford and Gray22 predicted a length of 151 aa. The C-terminus of the presequence region accounts for the difference between these two studies: the 48 bp pbgd-i1 is present in the codon for aa 85, the 46 bp pbgd-i2 is inserted between the codons for aa 119 and 120, and the 50 bp pbgd-i3 localizes to the codon for aa 144 of Pbgd preprotein (i.e. either within the end of the presequence region or shortly downstream of it). The 45 bp petA-i1 is present downstream of the codon 87 of the 147 aa presequence region. The 46 bp petF-i1 was found to be inserted into the codon-specifying aa 131 of the 138 aa presequence region of the EST-encoding ferredoxin (accession number EG565162). The 41 bp petJ-i1 localizes downstream of either nt 304 or 305 of PetJ partial mRNA sequence (accession number AJ130725), with nt 267 representing the end of the presequence-encoding region. The predicted 144 aa PsaF presequence harbours the 47 bp psaF-i1 downstream of codon 94. The 47 bp psbM-i1 is inserted into codon 131 of the PsbM presequence region (predicted to 154 aa). The 93 bp psbO-i1 was identified about 60 nt downstream of the PsbO presequence-encoding region. Finally, the 48 bp intron psbW-i1 localizes between the codons 66 and 67 of the predicted 82 aa PsbW presequence.Taken together, in this study, 13 new intron sequences present in E. gracilis nuclear genes encoding chloroplast proteins have been described. In genes encoding chloroplast-targeted proteins Eno29, GapA, PetA, PetF, PetJ, PsaF, PsbO, PsbM and PsbW, one intron has been identified within the second half of presequence-encoding region or shortly downstream of it, while in gene encoding Pbgd, two introns were identified within the presequence and one at the presequence-mature peptide border encoding region. Importantly, the BLAST search revealed no significant primary sequence similarity of the introns identified in this study to either introns present in the E. gracilis chloroplast genome, or to any introns from other organisms in public databases.Ten of 13 introns identified in this study are conventional, and are 45–50 bp long. Introns of similar size (44–53 bp) have been already described in some other E. gracilis nuclear genes, while some of them are conventional.26–29 The only shorter introns in euglenoid species known so far are three introns (27, 29 and 31 bp-long) present in hsp90 gene of the phagotrophic euglenid Peranema trichoforum.56 Of these, only one is conventional. Nevertheless, it should be mentioned that E. gracilis introns can widely vary in size,25–30 and the largest one identified so far is the conventional intron i1 (9.2 kb) in one of the two copies of the gamma-tubulin gene.28Interestingly, the E. gracilis nuclear gene encoding chloroplast protein RbcS also contains an intron within the second half of presequence region. The size of this intron is 53 bp, it is in phase 0, but does not possess GT/AG borders.27 In the nuclear gene Lhcb (Lhcbm1), a 86 bp intron roughly separates presequence and mature peptide coding regions.25 This intron is also non-conventional, and it is impossible to determine its phase due to TG dinucleotide present on both intron–exon borders.25 Likewise, the 93 bp intron in the PsbO presequence is also flanked by TG dinucleotide and shares 46% primary sequence identity with the 86 bp intron in Lhcb.Importantly, 10 of 14 E. gracilis introns known to be present in the second half of presequence-encoding regions or shortly downstream of them share various characteristic features: the length (45–50 bp), consensus GT/AG splicing borders, they are AT- and especially T-rich, and possess characteristic pyrimidine tracks at the 3'-ends. Moreover, the primary sequence identity of each two of these 10 introns ranges from 27 to 61% (Table 4). Notably, the 44 and 46 bp introns of conventional type present in the E. gracilis fibrillarin gene29 share 58% primary sequence identity, and the primary sequence identity of these 2 introns and 10 45–50 bp introns found in this study ranges from 32 to 55% (Table 4). Although not all alignment scores are statistically significant (Table 4), the sequence similarity together with other characteristics of these 44–50 bp E. gracilis introns suggests that recombination events between these introns can potentionally occur. In comparison, conventional introns present within or shortly downstream of presequence regions of nuclear-encoded plastid proteins from the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum are 183–410 bp long and their pairwise sequence comparison did not reveal significant sequence similarity.48Primary sequence identity (top-right half) and alignment P-value (bottom-left half) of the selected introns from E. gracilis (44–50 bp long, with consensus GT/AG borders)Except for nop1p-i1 and nop1p-i3 (introns present in the gene-encoding nucleolar protein fibrillarin), all these introns are present either in the presequence-encoding regions or shortly upstream of them. The primary sequence identity was calculated as the number of identical nucleotide oppositions of two introns in a pairwise alignment divided by the length of the alignment. Statistically significant alignments with P-value =0.05 are shown in bold (see section Methods).Primary sequence identity (top-right half) and alignment P-value (bottom-left half) of the selected introns from E. gracilis (44–50 bp long, with consensus GT/AG borders)Except for nop1p-i1 and nop1p-i3 (introns present in the gene-encoding nucleolar protein fibrillarin), all these introns are present either in the presequence-encoding regions or shortly upstream of them. The primary sequence identity was calculated as the number of identical nucleotide oppositions of two introns in a pairwise alignment divided by the length of the alignment. Statistically significant alignments with P-value =0.05 are shown in bold (see section Methods).Kilian and Kroth48 suggested ‘semi-exon shuffling’ as a possible mechanism for the acquisition of presequence parts (e.g. signal peptides) in diatoms. The intron present within the presequence-encoding region of the donor gene might have recombined either with 5'-UTR of acceptor gene or with its transit peptide (likely transferred from the red algal symbiont nucleus to the host nucleus with the acceptor gene), while new 3'-AG intron border in the acceptor gene might have been generated by utilizing random AG nucleotides.48 However, the primary sequence similarity of 10 45–50 bp introns present within or shortly downstream of E. gracilis presequences, and the similarity between the 86 bp intron in the Lhcb and the 93 bp intron in the PsbO presequences, suggest exon-shuffling rather than ‘semi-exon shuffling’ as a likely mechanism for the acquisition of presequences or their parts in E. gracilis.Two possible scenarios for presequence acquisition via exon-shuffling in euglenids are depicted in Fig. 1. The first one includes single recombination events between cis-spliced introns of donor gene (possessing the presequence region) and acceptor gene (Fig. 1A). Importantly, the acceptor may gain not only the presequence region, but also the trans-spliced intron necessary for the addition of capped spliced leader. Another mechanisms for presequence acquisition in E. gracilis involves double crossing over events, one occurring between trans-introns of donor and acceptor gene, and the second involving adjacent cis-spliced introns of donor and acceptor gene (Fig. 1B). The cis-intron in the donor gene in Fig. 1 is placed right at the border of the presequence-mature peptide-encoding region for illustration. However, it could also be present within the presequence-encoding region (most likely in the second half of it). It should be mentioned that the presequence regions of E. gracilis chloroplast precursor proteins have been predicted to vary from 61 to 233 aa,22 and the shortest one currently known (that of Eno29) possibly comprises only 47 aa.51 Thus the addition(s) of shorter parts of presequence region from donor genes to acceptor genes might have resulted in targeting to chloroplasts. In addition, three introns identified in Pbgd gene might represent an example of how the presequence-encoding regions were generated via recombination events mediated by introns. Possible mechanisms for the acquisition of presequences in the ancestor of phototrophic euglenids. A single recombination event mediated via cis-spliced introns (Cis i1 and Cis i2) can result in the addition of presequence (or its part) from donor gene to acceptor gene (A). The donor gene would also acquire trans-spliced intron (Trans i) necessary for the addition of capped SL-leader ensuring translation of acceptor gene mRNA. Note that intron Cis i1 is shown to be present exactly at the presequence-mature peptide border encoding region for illustration in (A), but it can be present also within second half of presequence-encoding region or shortly downstream of it. Intron Cis i2 is also shown to be present at 5'-end of the acceptor gene for illustration in (A), but it can be also present within 5'-end of the acceptor gene. Another possible mechanism for the acquisition of chloroplast-targeting signals (B) may involve double crossing over, i.e. the first recombination event occurring between trans-spliced introns Trans i1 and Trans i2, present at the 5'-ends of donor and acceptor gene, respectively, and the second recombination event occurring between cis-spliced intron (Cis i1) present at the presequence-mature peptide border-encoding region of the donor gene and cis-spliced intron (Cis i2) present somewhere within the 5'-end of the protein-coding region of the acceptor gene.Possible mechanisms for the acquisition of presequences in the ancestor of phototrophic euglenids.

This is consistent with, and adds additional support for a relatively recent origin of euglenoid secondary plastids, later than the endosymbiosis of the evolutionarily ancient red algae leading to diatoms. Anyway, the repertoire for creating novel targeting sequences or for replacing the transit sequences from the primary host cell by bi- or tripartite presequences did already exist. This applies for the a-proteobacterial endosymbiosis leading to mitochondria and the above-mentioned secondary endosymbiosis leading to chromophytes, respectively: exon-shuffling at the DNA level via appropriately placed introns enabling recombination. Our data suggest that euglenids also made use of this mechanism, probably as the last in a row.Although nuclear gene sequence data of euglenids are fragmentary, it seems that nuclear genes of euglenids possess many cis-spliced introns. In contrast, wide-scale genome data from parasitic kinetoplastids are available, but very few cis-spliced introns from trypanosomes were reported so far, including a 11 bp intron in the gene for tRNA(tyr) of Trypanosoma cruzi and Trypanosoma brucei,61 and 653 and 302 bp introns in the gene for poly(A) polymerase of T. brucei and T. cruzi, respectively.62 One might argue that almost complete loss of cis-spliced introns in trypanosomes arose through parasitic life style, as did the overall compaction of nuclear genomes of trypanosomes including fairly short intergenic spacers with polycistronic transcription63,64 and overlapping genes.65 However, cis-spliced introns seem to be rare in both parasitic and free-living kinetoplastids, and this general condition could pre-date the adoption of parasitism by the trypanosomatid lineage.66 The euglenid lineage with numerous cis-spliced introns—as opposed to the kinetoplastid lineage—likely was better pre-adapted for the acquisition of chloroplast-targeting presequences, and thus for the successful integration of an algal symbiont.FundingThis work was supported by grants from the Ministry of Education of the Slovak Republic (VEGA 1/0416/09, to J.

IntroductionToxoplasma gondii is an obligate apicomplexan parasite that can invade a wide variety of mammalian cells, including those of humans and many economically important domestic animals. Toxoplasmosis is a common opportunistic infection caused by T. gondii in immunocompromised individuals, such as AIDS patients, and congenital toxoplasmosis is also a serious protozoan disease that occurs in infants when mothers became infected with T. gondii for the first time during or just before pregnancy. Infection in livestock is another threat that causes a serious economic loss.1Toxoplasma gondii is also one of the most intensively studied protozoans. Their life cycle is heteroxenous. That is, sexual proliferation occurs in members of Felidae as definitive hosts and asexual proliferation occurs in other worm-blooded intermediate hosts in two forms (acutely lytic tachyzoites and slowly proliferating bradyzoites in tissue cysts that cause chronic infection). To understand the molecular mechanism driving this stage conversion is a major issue in the field of Toxoplasma studies because chronic infection by bradyzoites makes it difficult for the immune system to exclude infected parasites. Furthermore, bradyzoites are also a causable element for inter-individual spreading of the parasites.To give a molecular-based explanation for these unique biological natures, genomics and transcriptomics might be a promising approach. The genome of T. gondii has been sequenced, and around 8000 genes are predicted.2 A series of EST analyses has contributed to give reliability to the prediction.3,4 In addition, the identification of intron-spanning peptides provided by proteome analysis supports splice site annotation.5,6 The expression profiles have also been analysed by EST,3,4 microarray,7–9 and SAGE,10 and they have confirmed the existence of transcripts associated with the predicted ORFs. The result of a SAGE analysis, in particular, provides a substantial clue for the estimation of the 3' terminal of each transcript.10 On the other hand, the majority of 5' UTRs and translation start sites are estimated without any substantial evidence except for genes individually analysed. Therefore, experimental evidence for 5' UTRs and fine-tuning of the Kozak rule in T. gondii11 are desired for a better gene annotation.In control of transcription, it is widely accepted that transcription factors and cis-DNA elements play a key role. In the former case, it is reported in Apicomplexa that there are homologous genes of general transcription factors, such as the TATA box-binding protein or TATA association factors (TAFs).12 However, specific transcription factors (TFs) have not been identified, except for the ApiAP2 family, which was originally identified in plants.13–15 The cis-DNA elements can be categorized into transcription motifs and core promoter elements. As transcription motifs in T. gondii, short nucleotides consisting of WGAGACG upstream of SAG1, some GRA genes, and DHFR-TS16–18 and YGCATGCR in ribosomal protein have been reported.19 Specific sequences of 30 bp in NTPase and 20 bp in the BAG1 promoter are also identified as a responsible element in Compound 1 induction.20 Joint work with bioinformatics has also succeeded in finding several novel motifs.21 Although core promoters were originally considered to be invariant, it has been found that they have certain diversity in structure and function22 derived from motifs such as the TATA box, the initiator (INR), the upstream or downstream TFIIB recognition element (BREu or BREd), the downstream core promoter element (DPE), and the motif-10 element (MTE). Furthermore, it is suggested that diversity in the core promoter structure is involved in transcriptional regulation.22 However, in T. gondii core promoters, neither the TATA box nor other well-characterized motifs in mammals are observed in T. gondii promoters,17,18,23–26 with the exception of the initiator motif (INR). The INR motif is widely observed in mammalian cells, and YYANWYY is a consensus sequence that overlaps a transcriptional start site (TSS).27 Sequences found in upstream regions of SAG1, NTP1, and NTP3 ORFs correspond to the INR consensus, and it has also been demonstrated experimentally that the sequence is responsible for its transcription by reporter assay.24 However, the popularity of the motif in the T. gondii core promoter remains an open question, and novel motifs in their core promoter have not been discovered yet because a systematic analysis for core promoter structure, which is essential for these attempts, has not been executed. Here, the relative position of core promoter motifs is associated with each TSS in general;22,28,29 therefore, it is essential for systematic analysis to obtain sufficient information about reliable TSSs.For the last couple of years, a method was established by combining the full-length cDNA method30 and the massively parallel sequencing technology. This makes it possible to collect precise positional information of TSSs together with digital information of the gene-expression levels in a high-throughput manner.31 In this study, we applied this method to elucidate the T. gondii transcriptome focusing on the estimation of transcription regions (TRs), their association for annotated ORFs, and the typical core promoter structure that could be helpful to accelerate an understanding of the nature of the parasites.2. Materials and methods2.1. Parasite culture and RNA preparationThe T. gondii RH strain was cultured and maintained in the monolayer of Vero cells. The infected cells were homogenized by passage through a 27-gauge needle, and cell debris was eliminated by a 5-µm pore size filter (Millex-SV). The supernatant was removed by centrifugation at 800 g. Parasites were suspended in Eagle's minimal essential medium, which resulted in 1 × 107 parasites per millilitre. ICR mice (CLEA Japan) were inoculated with 1 ml of the purified parasites per head by intraperitoneal injection. Three days after inoculation, proliferated parasites were harvested and purified by centrifugation and filtration as reported above. A total of 1 × 109 of purified parasites were suspended in 1 ml of PBS, and 20 ml of the TRI reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) was added. Total RNA was purified according to the manufacturer's instructions.2.2. Oligo-capping and high-throughput sequencingThe detailed protocol for oligo-capping and sequencing has been described elsewhere.31 In brief, 200 µg of purified total RNA was dephosphorylated with Bacterial Alkaline Phosphatase, ligated with oligo-RNA (5'-AAUGAUACGGCGACCACCGAGAUCUACACUCUUUCCCUACACGACGCUCUUCCGAUCUGG-3') using T4 RNA ligase, and cDNA was then synthesized from a random hexamer primer (5'-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGANNNNNNC-3') with Super Script II (Invitrogen). The cDNA was amplified by 15 cycles of PCR, and massive parallel sequencing was executed with Illumina GA sequencer (Illumina) to obtain tag with 36-nt length.2.3. Data processingThe obtained sequences were mapped onto the T. gondii ME49 strain genomic sequencing (version 5.0 in toxoDB; http://toxodb.org/toxo/) with the sequence alignment program Eland after removing two nucleotides of margin nucleotides between the sequencing primer and transcripts. Unmapped or redundantly mapped tags were removed from the data set. Tags with more than two mismatches were also removed.2.4. Characterization of TSSsTSSs were clustered for further analysis. As a first step, the number of TSSs in a window of 20-nt size over the genome was counted, and the window was assigned as an active transcription window if it contained statistically significant counts that exceeded background distribution. According to the background distribution, it was assumed that each TSS distributed randomly over the genome, and its probability was defined as the window size per genome size. Because the probability was small enough, the Poisson distribution was applied as a model of background distribution. In practice, 0.66 tags in a 20-nt window were expected by the following calculation (there were 4 027 161 uniquely mapped valid tags). The genome size was offset from 61 769 183 into 60 930 771.6 bp on the basis of the ratio between uniquely mapped counts (4 027 161) and redundantly mapped counts (55 414). Then, (20/60 930 771.6 × 2) × 4 027 161 = 0.66. In this study, it was regarded as significant when there were more than 10 TSSs in each window. The transcription windows were merged when they overlapped, and they were referred to as the TR.2.5. Comparison among TRs and annotated ORFsSubsequently, associations between the assigned TRs and ORFs were examined. For that purpose, 7923 annotated ORFs on the chromosome were selected from a database, ToxoDB version 5.0. The relative distance between the peak TSS, a TSS with the most abundant tag in a TR, and the ORFs was evaluated. In this study, a score of 1 was given if the peak TSS was located from 0 to 1000 bp relative to 5' of the ORF. If the peak TSS was located from 1000 to 5000 bp, the score was linearly decreased from 1 to 0. In addition, if the peak TSS was located inside of the exons and introns, the score was linearly redacted from 1 at 5' end to 0 at the 3' end. The maximum score for both the TR to ORFs and each ORF to the TRs was examined and assigned as a pair when the scores exceeded 0.5. A start codon for ENO2 was referred to the previous report describing its promoter structure.262.6. Core promoter analysisTo analyse the T. gondii core promoter structure, representative TSSs and their surrounding sequences were examined. TSSs with the most tags in each TR were selected as the representative TSSs when they had more than 10 tags. A test data set named core ± 100 was constructed to consist of –100 to +100 regions from the TSSs. The initial severance was executed by counting the numbers of adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine at each position in the core ± 100. For the initiator motif analysis, a sub-data set consisting of seven nucleotides from -2 to +5 in the core ± 100 was constructed, and the number of unique sequences was counted and then sorted according to their occurrence. The 30 most frequently occurring sequences were selected, and the position frequency matrixes (PFMs) for the T. gondii-specific initiator motif (tgINRT and tgINRA) were constructed according to the sequence. To find a specific pattern in the thymidine-rich region from +3 to +14, short sequences consisting of six nucleotides were selected, and their occurrence was examined. Finally, the PFM for the downstream thymidine cluster (DTC) was constructed in the same manner as reported above.Specific localization of the motifs was evaluated by scanning for each motif in the core ± 100. PFMs for the mammalian TATA box and INR32 were also examined. These PFMs were transformed into a position weight matrix (PWM) according to the function.33 For all probable nucleotide combinations, e.g. 16 384 variations for seven nucleotides of the INRs, their similarity score to each motif was evaluated using the PWMs, and the highest 1% sequences, e.g. 163 unique sequences out of the 16 384, were selected as positive. In addition, the occurrence frequency and location of these positive sequences in the core ± 100 were examined. To investigate the correlations between core elements (tgINRT, tgINRA, and DTC at +3, +9, and +19) and promoter activity, tag counts belonging to each promoter were tallied and the Mann–Whitney test was executed.The calculations reported above were executed mainly with the programming language Ruby.3. Results and discussion3.1. Statistics for obtained tagsA de novo analytical method using a next-generation sequencer, tss-seq, provides a short-tag sequence with one-nucleotide resolution and massively high coverage; therefore, it is possible to collect digital information of the TSS position with transcriptional quantity.31 In this study, we analysed the transcriptome of T. gondii for the first time in the Apicomplexa parasite with this method and obtained 6 801 945 tags consisting of 1 336 060 unique sequences from the T. gondii RH strain tachyzoites propagated in ICR mice (Table 1). To define the position of each tag in a genome, the tags were mapped onto the genome sequence of the T. gondii ME49 strain because the full genome sequence for the T. gondii RH strain is not currently available and that of the T. gondii ME49 is the most authorized sequence among the T. gondii strains. This inevitable discordance among specimens and the reference sequence causes SNPs; therefore, tags with equal to or fewer than two mismatches for the T. gondii ME49 genome were accepted. Then, 4 082 575 tags consisting of 450 852 unique sequences were assigned as valid (Table 1). Of these tags, 4 027 161 tags consisting of 440 690 unique sequences were uniquely mapped on the genome (Table 1). A total of 55 414 tags consisting of 10 162 unique sequences were redundantly mapped, and these tags were excluded as exceptions to reduce the complexity (Table 1). The remaining tags were tallied according to the mapped position, which resulted in the acquisition of 124 217 TSSs (Table 1). These data are available on a Website, Full-Toxoplasma (http://fullmal.hgc.jp/), with graphic interface. Global statisticsGlobal statisticsTo characterize the distribution of the TSSs, we plotted the logarithmic converted tag counts on a horizontal axis and the logarithmic converted rank of each TSS on a vertical axis (Fig. 1). As a result, we found a linear correlation similar to the Power Law distribution. The same trend was observed in transcriptome analysis with microarrays.34 Therefore, our observation suggested that the power law distribution was involved not only in the gene-expression level but also in the selection of TSSs. The power law distribution was observed in various situations, for example, on an airline route map, metabolic networks, and protein–protein interaction.35–37 However, the question remains open as to whether there is a general theory for determining the distribution and whether there is any biological meaning. Statistical profile of TSSs in T. gondii. Counts of each unique tag were converted to a logarithm and plotted on a horizontal axis.

Characterization of the TRThe advantages of the tss-seq method also play a key role in detailed analysis of TRs, which are difficult to conduct using existing exhaustive methods, such as the microarray. In this study, TRs were assigned by clustering TSSs, and, more specifically, we adopted a null hypothesis in which tags were distributed without control; therefore, an area with accumulated tags could be under the control of transcription machinery if the number of tags in the area were statistically higher than expected. The Poisson distribution expresses the probability of events if these events occurred independently of others with a known average rate. Furthermore, it can be applied to systems with a large number of possible events with low frequency. In particular, the events corresponded to the mapping of the massive number of obtained tags, and its frequency was quite low because a tag position must be selected from a very large genome. Therefore, the situation met the requirement for the Poisson distribution. With this method, it was possible to demonstrate the cut-off value supported by statistics, which then made it possible to compare multiple data sets even if the size of each system was considerably different. It was expected that this advantage would become more critical when TSS databases became expanded.Here, we assigned 10 508 TRs by clustering 124 217 TSSs according to the method described above (Table 2); however, this number could change depending on the parameters, in particular, the cut-off value for significance under the Poisson distribution. In this study, we applied the cut-off value of 10 in each window, where a probability for the existence of more than 10 tags in the window became 0.24 × 10-8 according to the Poisson distribution if mapping occurred randomly. Furthermore, the number of windows was twice the genome size; therefore, the expected false positive was determined to be under 0.32. This value was quite stringent; however, it could prevent overestimation for associations between TRs and annotated ORFs. As a result, we assigned 10 508 TRs, which was in good agreement with 7923 of the annotated number of T. gondii genes if alternative promoters38 were utilized in T. gondii as well. In addition, the number was higher than the 898 genes detected by SAGE10 in the T. gondii RH strain tachyzoites even under such stringent conditions. Obviously, it would be possible to apply other cut-off values. For example, 0.41 × 10-9, derived from the P-value of 0.05 denominated by 120 M nucleotides according to the Bonferroni method, could be applicable. This was quite safe, but it caused too many false negatives, especially for the purposes of this study. On the other hand, we might have lost the positive TRs under the parameters in this study, in which case a milder cut-off value could be applied to detect subtle TRs; therefore, the cut-off value should be selected depending on the purpose of each study. Positional comparison between TSS cluster and genePositional comparison between TSS cluster and geneThe correspondence between the resulting cluster and known transcription profile might be an important concern. For this reason, we checked the expression profile for representative tachyzoite- and bradyzoite-specific genes and confirmed that our observation was in good agreement with previous findings. For example, the tags for four representative tachyzoite-specific genes (SAG1, SRS2, LDH1, and ENO2) were successfully observed (Fig. 2). In detail, SAG1 had eight TRs with a total of 33 773 tags, SRS2 had four TRs with a total of 1297 tags, LDH1 had two TRs with a total of 439 tags, and ENO2 had three TRs with a total of 589 tags (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2), in agreement with other reports,39–44 even though, for ENO2, there was a difference of ~30 nucleotides in position between the peak TSSs observed in this study and in a previous report.26 This minor discordance might be caused by differences in the subjected strains and culture conditions in each case. On the other hand, no clusters were assigned around three representative bradyzoite-specific genes, BAG1, LDH2, and ENO1 (Fig. 2, Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). Distribution of tag sequences mapped on the genome of T. gondii. The coding regions for representative tachyzoite-specific genes, SAG1, SRS2, LDH1, and ENO2, are shown by grey boxes. Those for bradyzoite-specific genes, BAG1, LDH2, and ENO1, are shown by white boxes. The length of the horizontal lines represents the number of observed tags, and the position represents the TSS.Distribution of tag sequences mapped on the genome of T. gondii.

The length of the horizontal lines represents the number of observed tags, and the position represents the TSS.Association of the assigned 10 508 TRs to the 7923 annotated ORFs was examined. If a TR was located within 3 kb upstream of an ORF or within the anterior half of an ORF, we determined that the TRs were proximal to the ORFs unless they were regarded as orphan TRs; as a result, 7447 TRs had proximal ORFs, but other 3061 TRs were orphan (Table 2 and Supplementary Table S1). In the former case, it was suggested that the TRs were responsible for these ORFs in transcription. In the latter case, it was probable that they were undiscovered genes or non-coding RNA. On the other hand, there were 3560 ORFs out of 7923 that did not have proximal TRs in their upstream region (Table 2 and Supplementary Table S2); then, it was suggested that these ORFs were incorrectly predicted or transcribed in the other stages or strains.3.3. Cis-elements in core promoter regionsA typical promoter is composed of regulatory domains and a core promoter. Identification of regulatory domains is essential for a better understanding of the transcriptome; however, since comparative transcriptome analysis among various conditions is desirable for a reliable estimation, we focused on another factor, namely, the core promoter in this study. For that purpose, the peak TSSs with more than 10 tags (6898 out of 10 508) were selected, a data set consisting of -100 to +100 nucleotides around the TSSs, a core ± 100, was constructed, and the distribution of each nucleotide was surveyed, then a significant localization of cytosine at -1, adenine at +1 (i.e. TSS), and thymidine from +3 to +14 was observed (Fig. 3A). Because the C + A localization on a TSS corresponded to the underlined nucleotides of the initiator consensus, YYANWYY, a sub-data set consisting of a sequence with seven nucleotides from -2 to +5 from the core ± 100 was constructed and examined to determine whether it was identical to the initiator consensus by sorting the seven nucleotide sequences according to their frequency (Table 3). As a result, TCACTTT, TCATTTT, and CCACTTT were the most popular sequences (88, 63, and 60 times out of 6898, respectively), which was consistent with the initiator consensus. Even though every C + A was conserved at least within the top 30 sequences (Table 3), the following four nucleotides were divided into two patterns. The major pattern (25 out of 30 listed in Table 3) was T-rich, and the minor one (5 out of 30 listed in Table 3) was A-rich. PFMs were constructed from both the T-rich and A-rich sequences (Table 4) and labelled as the tgINRT and tgINRA, respectively. According to the significant thymidine localization, every six nucleotides on from +3 to +14 in the core ± 100 were examined, and poly thymidines were observed in high frequency (Table 5); thus, their PFM was constructed (Table 6) and labelled as the DTC. Their positional specificity and frequency in the core promoters of the tgINRs (tgINRT and tgINRA), mammalian initiator (mINR), and DTC were examined together with the TATA box motif32 by scanning the core ± 100 data set with their PWMs. Then, the obvious localization of the tgINRs on the TSS and following DTC was confirmed (Fig. 3B). The mINR was also observed, but its frequency was less than that of tgINRT. On the other hand, the TATA box was not observed at around -30, its expected location45 even though there was a weak peak around +1 that presumably appeared due to biased nucleotide utilization (Fig. 3A) or a certain similarity among INR consensus and TATA box.

The region where the TATA box should be is shown by a crossed-out grey box.Subsequently, we examined the involvement of the motifs (tgINRs and DTC) in transcriptional activities. For the tgINRs, 1628 tgINRT-positive, 826 tgINRA-positive, and 4444 INR-negative promoters were subjected for the Mann–Whitney test according to their rank of tag count. As a result, it was implied that there were significant increase in tag count in promoters with both tgINRs rather than without the motifs (Table 7). This observation was consistent with an in vitro experiment with a reporter assay for NTP3.24 Besides it was also implied that the tgINRT positives tended to have more tags than the tgINRA positives (Table 7). For the DTC, they distributed over 20 nucleotides then we selected three representatives (at +3, +9, and +19) according to their peak positions and subjected for the Mann–Whitney test. As a result, it was implied that there were significant increases in tag count for DTC-positive promoters in all three cases rather than without it (Table 7). On the contrary, significant diversity was not observed according to their position among the three (Table 7). In this study, we analysed a massive number of core promoters; therefore, it was possible to detect statistical differences even though the differences were small enough as shown by medians in same cases (Table 7). Therefore, further experimental analysis would be desirable to conclude the functional involvement of the motifs into transcriptional activity. The Mann–Whitney test for core promoter motifs and transcription activities*z-value was enough large (11.083) to calculate the exact P-value.The Mann–Whitney test for core promoter motifs and transcription activities*z-value was enough large (11.083) to calculate the exact P-value.According to the definition of Butler and Kadonaga,45 a core promoter is the minimal stretch of contiguous DNA sequences that is sufficient to direct the accurate initiation of transcription by the RNA polymerase II machinery, and, in particular, its physical length is about ±40 bp around the TSS.45 The TATA box, initiator (INR), upstream or downstream TFIIB recognition element (BREu or BREd), DPE, and MTE are commonly found in the core promoters as motifs.28,29,45,46 Additionally, the pyrimidine patch (Y patch) has been reported in the plant core promoter.47,48 In this study, we found two motifs, tgINRs and DTC, in the T. gondii core promoter region (Fig. 3, Tables 4 and 6), and the combination of tgINRs and DTC was suggested as a typical core promoter structure (Fig. 3C). The INR element encompasses the TSS and is identified in a variety of eukaryotes.49–51 The consensus sequence is YYANWYY in mammalian49,52 and TCAKTY in Drosophila,50,53 and the tgINRs were similar to both of them. It is known that TAFII250 and TAFII150 interact with INR.54 Their homologous genes are identified in both Plasmodium falciparum12 and T. gondii (TGME49_076180 and TGME49_014240). These observations suggest that the transcription machinery involving INR was conserved in a wide variety of organisms, including Apicomplexan parasites. On the other hand, DTC was a unique motif localized from approximately +3 to +14. Unlike other core promoter motifs, this element did not show strict positional specificity, and its complementary pattern, the adenine cluster, was also observed in the same region even with much lower frequency (Fig. 3A, Table 5). Furthermore, it is reported that a similar motif, the Y patch, are distributed around the TSSs in plants.47,48 The Y patch consists of T or C, and there is no clear pattern in their order, as is the case of DTC in T. gondii. Therefore, it was implied that DTC and Y patch were involved in transcriptional regulation even though their function at the molecular level remains unknown.Interestingly, other major core promoter elements reported in mammalians were not observed in the T. gondii core promoter. It has been reported that there is no TATA box in SAG1,23GRA1, 2, 5, and 6,17NTP1, 2, and 3,24MIC4,25DHFR-TS,18 and ENO1 and 2,26 and the functional TATA box has not yet been described in T. gondii. These observations were determined by our exhaustive analysis (Fig. 3B), demonstrating that there was no significant localization of the TATA box consensus sequence in the proper (around -30 from TSS) position for 6,898 core promoter sequences and also there were not any distinguishable peaks from background when we extended scanned areas by -200 nucleotides from TSSs (data not shown). In yeast, it is reported that TATA boxes are distributed over a wide area (from -120 to -40)55 and it seems to be difficult to find specific peaks from such a wide area with the scanning method. Therefore it was suggested that T. gondii did not utilize functional TATA boxes around -30 positions even though those distributed over a wide area could not be excluded. According to other motifs, BREu, BREd, DPE, and MTE, we could not find a significant localization in T. gondii core promoters (data not shown). Although core promoters were originally thought to be invariant, they have been found to possess considerable structural and functional diversity. Furthermore, it appears that core promoter diversity makes an important contribution to the regulation of gene expression.22 However, our finding implied relative low complicity in the T. gondii core promoter; even though, it was not clear whether this was because of the nature of the parasite or motifs that had been undiscovered. Therefore, subsequent elaborative studies are desirable.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis study was partly supported by ‘Asia-Africa Science and Technology Strategic Cooperation Promotion Program’, Special Coordination Funds for Promotion of Science and Technology, MEXT and KAKENHI (Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research) on Priority Areas ‘Comparative Genomics’ from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan.We are grateful to Ms. Kazumi Abe for expertise of tss-seq.

IntroductionHNRNPK is an abundant protein factor found in the nucleus, cytoplasm, mitochondria, and plasma membrane that belongs to the family of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs). These hnRNPs are involved in a variety of biological processes, including telomere biogenesis, cellular signalling, DNA repair, and the regulation of expression on both the transcriptional and translational levels.1 HNRNPK has been found to activate and repress gene expression, and its activity is mainly regulated by covalent modifications.2–4 Through its binding to single-stranded (ss) and double-stranded (ds) DNA, HNRNPK regulates gene expression in both CT element-dependent and -independent fashions.Several studies have demonstrated the aberrant increase in HNRNPK expression in cancers.5–9 Other studies have shown that HNRNPK is a functional constituent of a cellular structure, the spreading initiation centre,10 and that it is indispensable for cellular migration.11 Overall, HNRNPK has been implicated as a potential key player in carcinogenesis, making it an attractive target for anticancer therapies. Although HNRNPK has been the subject of numerous studies, the mechanisms regulating its expression are still largely unknown.The palindromic motif TCTCGCGAGA has been found in TATA-less promoters, and is a potential cis-regulatory element in ~5% of human genes including cell cycle, transcription regulators, chromatin structure modulators, translation initiation factors, and ribosomal protein genes.12 Here, we present experimental and computational evidence that the TCTCGCGAGA motif represents a critical element in the regulation of HNRNPK expression.2. Materials and methods2.1. Reporter plasmid constructionSequences obtained from annotated databases (GenBank and dbEST, available at the National Center for Biotechnology Information; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) were analysed by bioinformatic tools, leading to the identification of four potential HNRNPK promoters (Supplementary Table S1). Promoter 1 contains the palindromic motif TCTCGCGAGA.All analysed HNRNPK promoter sequences were amplified from human genomic DNA using Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) and primers, as listed in Table 1; graphical location of analysed fragments is shown in Fig. 1A. For promoter fragments 1, 2, and 3, nested polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) were used, with pre-amplification of long fragments with the Promoter 1 forward and Promoter 3 reverse primers pair. For Fragment 4, a standard PCR reaction was used. The PCR-amplified DNA fragments were T/A subcloned into the pCR 2.1-TOPO vector using the TOPO TA Cloning kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and the resulting vectors were transformed into chemically competent TOP10 cells. Plasmid DNA was isolated from randomly selected bacterial clones and sequenced using the ABI Prism 377 automated DNA sequencing system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Plasmids were digested with KpnI and EcoRV (Promoters: 1, 2, 3) or with SacI and EcoRV (Promoter 4), separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, and DNA fragments isolated from the gel were inserted into the corresponding restriction sites of the pGL4.10[luc2] luciferase reporter vector (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange Multi Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies, Inc.) in the context of pGL4.10[luc2]-promoter-1, according to the manufacturer's protocol. All final DNA constructs were confirmed by sequencing.

Transient transfection of HeLa cellsHeLa cells were grown at 37°C in 6% CO2 humidified atmosphere in DME medium supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.01% streptomycin in plastic cell culture flasks. Cells were routinely subcultured using a trypsin solution. Prior to transfection, cells were plated in ViewPlate-96 White plates (PerkinElmer Wellesley, MA, USA) at 90% confluency and cultured overnight. Each well was transfected for 4 h using Lipofectamine 2000 Reagent (Invitrogen), with 170 ng of the pGL4.10-promoter construct or the empty pGL4.10 vector encoding the firefly luciferase gene, and co-transfected with 30 ng of the phrl-CMV plasmid (Promega) encoding the Renilla luciferase gene. To counterbalance minute differences in construct length and to retain constant particle numbers, the quantity of plasmid DNA was adjusted relative to construct size. The quantity of phrl-CMV plasmid DNA remained unchanged. Lipofectamine–DNA complexes were prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions, except that MEM was used instead of Opti-MEM medium. To maximize transfection efficiency during the 4 h incubation, the serum complement was reduced to 0.5%. Afterward the medium was changed to MEM containing 4% serum and all standard complements. Twenty-four hours following transfection, cells were harvested and assayed for luciferase activity in a Victor 2 luminometer (PerkinElmer) using the Dual-Glow Luciferase Assay System reagents (Promega) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. To normalize non-specific variations in transfection efficiency and cell number, all promoter activities were expressed as the ratio of firefly luciferase to Renilla luciferase luminescence in each well. Three independent transfection experiments were conducted with six replicates of each plasmid construct in each experiment. All values are presented as mean ± standard deviation.2.3. Analyses of protein–DNA interactionsNon-histone nuclear protein extracts (NEs) were isolated as previously reported.13 Protein Desalting Spin Columns (Pierce, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) were used for buffer exchange of protein samples. Two methods were applied for analysing interactions between the palindromic motif and DNA-binding proteins: electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and mass spectrometry (MS). The sequences of oligonucleotides used in the study are shown in Table 1.NEs were immunodepleted of Ku80 protein using monoclonal anti-Ku80 antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, UK; ab3107) and Immunoprecipitation Kit—Dynabeads® Protein G (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol.EMSA were performed as described previously.12 DNA probes were phosphorylated with [<U+03B3>-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Fermentas International Inc., Burlington, Canada) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The reaction was carried out in a total volume of 15 µl (30 min at 25°C) containing 2.5 µg of NE proteins and 1.4 pmol of oligonucleotide in 100 mM NaCl-binding buffer (BB) (100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT, 10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5). EMSA was performed using 4 µl of the product on an 8% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel (37.5:1, Promega) for 1 h at 7.5 V/cm. Autoradiograms were obtained using Imaging screen K and Molecular Imager FX (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA).Fifty micrograms of NE diluted in 50 mM NaCl-BB [50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.05% NP-40, 5 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, containing protease inhibitors (Roche, Basel, Switzerland)] were incubated at 4°C for 60 min with rotation, in the presence of 200 pM biotinylated wild-type DNA probe with or without a 10-fold excess of competitor (non-biotinylated DNA probe containing the mutated motif). To precipitate the DNA–protein complexes, 1 mg of Dynabeads® M-280 Streptavidin (Invitrogen) was added and the mixture was incubated with rotation at 4°C for 15 min. After magnetic separation, the beads were extensively washed with 150 mM NaCl-BB, and the bound proteins were eluted from the beads with 300 mM NaCl, 500 mM NaHCO3, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5. Eluted proteins were subjected to reduction, alkylation, tryptic digestion, and MS identification.LC-MS analyses were carried out using the nano-Acquity (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA) LC system coupled to an LTQ FTICR (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) mass spectrometer. Spectrometer parameters were as follows: capillary voltage—2.5 kV, cone—40 V, N2 gas flow—0, and m/z range—300–2000. The spectrometer was calibrated on a weekly basis with Calmix (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Samples were loaded from the autosampler tray (cooled to 10°C) to the precolumn [Symmetry C18, 180 µm × 20 mm, 5 µm (Waters)] using a mobile phase of 100% MilliQ water acidified with 0.1% formic acid. Peptides were transferred to the nano-UPLC column [BEH130 C18, 75 µm × 250 mm, 1.7 µm (Waters)] by a gradient of 5–30% ACN in 0.1% formic acid in 45 min (250 nl/min), then directly eluted to the ion source of the mass spectrometer. Each LC run was preceded by a blank run to ensure lack of carry-over of the material from the previous run. For qualitative analyses (peptide and protein identification), the spectrometer was run in data-dependent MS to MS/MS switch mode, and up to ten MS/MS processes were allowed for each MS scan. Quantitative analyses were carried out in separate profile type survey scan LC-MS runs using the same ACN gradient.LTQ-FT MS raw data files were processed to peak lists with the Mascot Distiller software (version 2.2.1, Matrix Science, London, UK). The pre-processed parent and daughter ion lists were used to search the Swissprot (http://www.expasy.org/sprot/) protein database, with taxonomy restriction to human (20 332 sequences, 11 229 110 residues). The Mascot search engine (version 2.2.03, Matrix Science, London, UK) was used to search the database with the following parameters: enzyme specificity—semi-trypsin, permitted number of missed cleavages—1, fixed modification—carbamidomethylation (C), variable modifications—oxidation (M), phospho (ST), phospho (Y), and carbamidomethyl (K), protein mass—unrestricted. The peptide and fragment mass tolerance settings were established separately for individual experiments after measured mass recalibration (Supplementary Method 1).Statistical assessment of peptide assignments was based on the joined target/decoy database search strategy. This procedure (Supplementary Method 2) provided q-value estimates for each peptide spectrum match (PSM) in the dataset. All PSMs with q-values >0.001 were removed from further analysis. A protein was regarded as confidently identified if at least two peptides of this protein were found. Proteins identified by a subset of peptides from another protein were excluded from analysis. Proteins matching exactly the same set of peptides were joined into a single group.The lists of peptides matching the acceptance criteria from all the LC-MS/MS runs were merged into one common list, which was next overlaid onto 2-D heat maps generated from the LC-MS profile data. This list was used to tag the corresponding peptide-related ion spectra on the basis of mass difference, deviation from the predicted elution time, and the match between the theoretical and observed isotopic envelopes. A more detailed description of the quantitative feature extraction procedure implemented by our in-house software is available.14 The relative abundance of each peptide was determined as the volume of a 2-D fit to the two most prominent peaks of the tagged isotopic envelope.Multiple-charge states of the same peptide were combined by summing their relative abundances. Missing abundance values (signals below the detection level of the instrument) were replaced by a reference value equal to the smallest abundance observed in the entire LC-MS analysis. Normalization was carried out on the log-transformed peptide abundances by fitting a robust locally weighted regression smoother (LOESS) between the individual samples and a median pseudo-sample.Principal components analysis (PCA) was used for graphical summarization and evaluation of the relationships among the studied samples. The statistical significance of protein abundance ratios was assessed by a one-sample t-test of the log-transformed peptide ratios for each protein. The resulting P-values were adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure that controls the false discovery rate (FDR).15 All statistical analyses were performed using proprietary software implemented in the MATLAB (MathWorks) environment.2.4. Chromatin immunoprecipitationChromatin cross-linking and cell harvesting were performed as previously described.16 Chromatin was sheared for seven rounds of 20 s (1 s pulse, 0.5 s gap) on-off pulses with a 500-Watt Ultrasonic Processor (Cole-Parmer Instrument Co., Vernon Hills, IL, USA) equipped with a microtip and set to 30% of maximum power. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed using the Matrix-ChIP platform as previously described.17 Briefly, in-house prepared polypropylene 96-well PCR plates (washed once with 200 µl PBS/well) were incubated overnight at room temperature with 0.2 mg of Protein A in 100 µl PBS/well. After washing with 200 µl PBS/well, the wells were blocked with 200 µl blocking buffer for 30 min at room temperature. The wells were cleared, then incubated with 0.5 µg antibody [anti-RNAPII-CTD (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), sc-47701; anti-Histone H3, Abcam, ab1791; anti-Histone H3K4me3, Abcam, ab8580; anti-Histone H3K27me3 (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), 07-449; anti-Histone H3Ac(Lys9/18), Millipore, 07-593; anti-PARP, Abcam, ab6079] diluted in 100 µl blocking buffer/well for 60 min at room temperature. Chromatin samples (4 µl chromatin/100 µl blocking buffer) were added to the wells (100 µl/well), and the plates were floated in a 4°C ultrasonic water bath for 1 h in order to accelerate protein-antibody binding. Wells were washed three times with 150 µl IP buffer and once with 150 µl TE buffer. Wells were incubated with 100 µl elution buffers in a thermocycler for 15 min at 56°C, followed by 15 min at 95°C. DNA samples were stored at -20°C in the original Matrix-ChIP plates for repeated use.The PCR mixture contained 2.5 µl 2× SYBR Green PCR master mix (SensiMix, Bioline, London, UK), 2.4 µl DNA template, and 0.1 µl primers (200 nM each) in 5 µl final volume. The reactions were run in 384-Well Optical Reaction Plates (Applied Biosystems). Amplification (two step, 40 cycles), data acquisition, and analysis were performed using the 7900HT Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). All PCR reactions were performed in triplicate. ChIP data are expressed as percent of input DNA as described previously,17 or as an input ratio of modified histone to total histone H3. The RNAPII/H3Ac ratio was calculated for each site tested by dividing the averaged RNAPII percent of input and the H3Ac/H3 level for all time points. The ChIP data are deposited in Supplementary Table S5. The primer sequences are listed in Table 1.2.5. Electrophoresis and immunoblottingEqual amounts of sample proteins (5 µg) were separated by 10% SDS–PAGE, electrotransfered to the Polyvinylidene Difluoride (PVDF) membrane and immunostained by standard methods as previously described.182.6. Extraction of an open chromatin ENCODE data for the promoters with the TCTCGCGAGA motifThe DNase-seq tracks at HNRNPK promoter (chr9:85785291-85785515) for HepG2, HeLa, k562, and GM12878 cell lines were obtained from the ENCODE Open Chromatin, Duke DNase-seq Base Overlap Signal datasets19 using the UCSC browser (hg18 genome assembly) http://genome.ucsc.edu. For acquiring an averaged open chromatin profile of 50 promoters bearing the palindromic motif the CisRED (http://www.cisred.org) Human 9 database was queried with TCTCGCGAGA sequence and the resulting coordinates of 50 promoters were used to extract the DNase-seq tracks for HeLa cell line (The ENCODE Open Chromatin, Duke DNase-seq Base Overlap Signal dataset). The open chromatin profiles were superimposed over the TCTCGCGAGA sequence present in each of the 50 promoters and extended over a 150 bp window.3. Results and discussion3.1. TCTCGCGAGA is the primary regulatory element of the HNRNPK promoterAlthough computational approaches permit identification of gene regulatory and coding sequences, definitive characterization of promoters and their cis-regulatory motifs requires experimental investigation.20 To identify which bioinformatically identified potential HNRNPK promoter(s) preferentially activates transcription, a series of promoter region fragments fused to a reporter gene were generated, and these constructs were transiently transfected into HeLa cells. Reporter plasmids contained four fragments of an HNRNPK promoter region (Fig. 1A). Sequences were identical to the human reference sequence (GenBank, NC_000009.10), with the exception of two single nucleotide polymorphisms: rs7859578 in promoter fragment 1, and rs796 004 in promoter fragment 3. The highest luciferase activity resulted from the reporter with HNRNPK promoter fragment 1. Fragment 2 produced <20% of the luciferase activity obtained with reporter fragment 1, while the luciferase activities generated by constructs containing Fragments 3 and 4 were marginal (Fig. 1B).Thus, promoter region 1 can be assumed to be the major HNRNPK promoter. It contains the palindromic motif TCTCGCGAGA, which has been recently grouped with the most-conserved motifs in a genome-wide human–mouse assessment of six to eight nucleotide segments.12 Palindromic motifs constitute an important group of regulatory elements. To further study the significance of this particular motif, we designed a series of Promoter 1 reporter constructs with mutated sequences at one, two, and three conserved nucleotide positions. Transcription assays revealed marked luciferase activity decreases in cells transfected with constructs containing the mutant motifs. A single point mutation in the palindromic motif resulted in a >80% loss of promoter activity, whereas triple mutations reduced the activity to near basal levels, demonstrating that this single regulatory site is essential for the majority of HNRNPK promoter activity (Fig. 1C). Similar results were demonstrated by Guo et al.,21 who investigated the role of this motif in FBN1 gene activity; the activity of a reporter gene decreased significantly when two middle nucleotides in the palindrome were replaced with two non-canonical nucleotides.3.2. In vitro searches for the palindromic motif's interacting protein(s)Regulatory elements that are concentrated in promoters (cis-elements) are recognized by trans-acting proteins that control transcriptional efficiency. To analyse the interactions between nuclear proteins and the palindromic motif in vitro, we performed EMSA and MS-based analyses.In order to characterize pertinent binding interactions, we used NEs, ds 16 and 30 bp DNA probes, and ss 16 and 30 oligonucleotide (nt) probes containing either the wild-type palindromic motif or a similar motif mutated at three nucleotide positions (Table 1). As shown in Fig. 2, a protein complex bound to 16 bp (Fig. 2A) and 30 bp (Fig. 2B) ds probes, containing either the wild-type or mutated motif, caused a similar DNA mobility shift in the form of a single band (Fig. 2, left panels). The wild-type ss oligonucleotide probes, on the other hand, formed two main protein–DNA complexes represented by the typically shifted band and a slowly migrating band (Fig. 2, right panels). When the wild-type 16 nt probe was replaced with a mutated oligonucleotide, the binding activity of the protein complex was substantially abolished (Fig. 2C). In contrast, replacing the wild-type 30 nt sequence with a mutated probe did not change the intensity of the upper band, and significantly increased the intensity of the lower band (Fig. 2D). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay of in vitro binding of TCTCGCGAGA motif probes. Intact or Ku80-depleted NEs, prepared from proliferating HeLa cells, were incubated with a 32P-labelled (A) ds 16 bp probe, (B) ds 30 bp probe, (C) ss 16 nt probe, or (D) ss 30 nt probe and resolved on the gel. WT, wild-type probe, containing proper palindrome motif; MT, mutated probe.Electrophoretic mobility shift assay of in vitro binding of TCTCGCGAGA motif probes.

WT, wild-type probe, containing proper palindrome motif; MT, mutated probe.With the exception of the ss 16 nt probes, the other probes predominantly captured proteins in a sequence-non-specific manner; most of the signal originating from the shifted band was supershifted by antibodies directed against ATP-dependent DNA helicase 2 subunit 2 (Ku80), one of the proteins forming DNA double-strand break repair complexes.22 Immunodepletion of Ku80 from the NEs had no effect on the supershift pattern, although the overall binding signal was weaker (Fig. 2). On the other hand, the EMSA with a 16 nt ss probe produced quite a different picture of affinity to nuclear factors when compared with the activity of the other DNA probes. The supershift signal introduced by the anti-Ku80 antibody was much weaker in this assay, and competitor binding was diminished. This result suggests that the palindromic sequence in a single-stranded conformation may represent a functional cis-element. Since a palindromic motif may form a hairpin structure only when single-stranded, it is plausible that this state preferentially favours certain nuclear factors, or facilitates changes in local chromatin structure that drive transcription from promoters bearing that sequence.To gain a broader view of the protein repertoire that might exist in complexes with the DNA probes, MS-based analyses were applied. We used NEs isolated from resting and proliferating cells in binding reactions with four 5'-biotinylated ss and ds probes, of two lengths, containing the palindromic motif sequence TCTCGCGAGA. Paired binding reactions were performed with and without a 10-fold excess of a competitor with similar characteristics (ss or ds, shorter or longer, non-biotinylated probe with a mutated motif). In addition, binding reactions were repeated using NEs that were depleted by immunoprecipitation with anti-Ku80 antibodies. Altogether, quantitative MS analyses of proteins bound to the DNA probes were carried out on 32 individual samples.Database searches were performed on 135 592 MS/MS spectra, resulting in the identification of 15 150 PSMs with q-values = 0.001 (corresponding to 2268 unique peptides). In total, 522 proteins were identified. Some proteins were represented by multiple peptides in all analytical MS runs, whereas other proteins appeared in individual runs as singular peptides; 297 proteins were identified by at least two peptides. Two proteins were detected by the MS/MS analysis only in the depleted samples, while 33 proteins were found only in the samples using crude NEs. Two hundred and sixty-two proteins were common to both experimental conditions. For statistical analysis we selected a subset of 132 proteins identified by at least three peptides that were annotated with the GO term nucleus (GO: 0005634), after exclusion of ribosomal proteins and histones (Supplementary Table S2).Normalized relative protein abundances were first transformed to corresponding principal-component scores. In the resulting plot (Fig. 3), the first component divided the analysed samples into two distinct groups by discriminating between the binding of ss and ds sequences, although the second component discriminated based on probe length. Principal component analysis of the relative abundances of 132 proteins selected for MS-based quantitative analysis. Experiments are colour-coded as follows: red, 16 nt single-stranded (ss) DNA probe, starving cells; blue, 16 bp ds DNA probe; green, 30 nt ss DNA probe; black, 30 bp ds DNA probe.Principal component analysis of the relative abundances of 132 proteins selected for MS-based quantitative analysis.

Assuming that a competitor competes out non-specific DNA–protein interactions, we constructed a protein abundance ratios matrix. The elements of the matrix were equal to the ratios of the protein abundances measured in the paired binding reactions conducted with and without DNA competitor molecules. We assumed that lack of statistically significant changes in the protein abundance, or its enrichment within protein complexes existing in the presence of a competitor, may indicate that proteins are bound to DNA probes in a sequence-specific manner.As already demonstrated by PCA, the relative abundances of DNA probe-associated proteins, and the protein compositions of DNA–bound complexes, were mostly dependent on probe sequence. Although the relative levels of 75 proteins, extracted from the nuclei of both resting and proliferating cells and associated with ss 16 nt and 30 nt probes, were not changed or were enriched in the binding reactions conducted in the presence of a competitor, the same was true only for 21 proteins associated with ds DNA probes (Supplementary Table S3). Further depletion of NEs by anti-Ku80 antibodies treatment additionally reduced the numbers of proteins which interaction with wild-type motif was unaffected by competitors to 40 and 8, respectively (Supplementary Table S4). Only three proteins (P46 013, Antigen KI-67; Q09666, Neuroblast differentiation-associated protein AHNAK; Q5SSJ5, Heterochromatin protein 1-binding protein 3) were common to all experimental settings.Therefore, analysis by EMSA and MS of the in vitro formation of DNA–protein complexes revealed compositional complexity of proteins interacting with the DNA probes, but did not select trans-acting protein(s) that unambiguously directly recognize and bind the palindromic motif TCTCGCGAGA.EMSA is a well-established method of monitoring the ability of a protein to bind to a DNA sequence in vitro. Despite the fact that it has been successfully employed to characterize transcription factors and the transcriptional regulation of various genes,23 it also responds to non-specific protein binding, as in the case of the abundant DNA repair proteins. In particular, a heterodimer of Ku80 and Ku70 binds with high affinity to DNA ends, attracting the other components of the DNA double-strand break repair machinery.22 We have encountered this inherent technical flaw during our EMSA of oligonucleotides containing the palindromic motif. Recently, Hu et al.24 used a protein microarray-based strategy to systematically characterize the repertoire of proteins bound to 752 predicted DNA motifs from previously published studies; the palindrome TCTCGCGAGA was characterized among them. Using their data deposited in the Human Protein-DNA Interactome database,25 we obtained a list of 21 proteins with reported in vitro affinity to this motif: LIG1, MTCP1, HOXB9, TRIP6 PHOX2A, TFAP2E, RBPMS2, NEIL2, MYOD1, ETV7, CREB5, RBM19, TCF7, C1orf25 LIG3, ACTL6B, MAFB, ZNF498, SORCS3, POU6F1, IRF3, and PARP3. We also generated a list of the 10 best matching proteins (RPS4X, PLG, H1FX, HES5, TFEB, USF2, GRHPR, TP73, ZMAT2, and LARP4) when the database was queried with the TCTCGCGAGA motif. Additionally, the hDREF protein, which was shown to regulate the expression of ribosomal proteins genes, is another protein with reported in vitro affinity to this motif.26 Surprisingly, none of these 32 proteins were found within the group of 132 proteins taken through quantitative statistical analysis of our MS data. This discrepancy again underlines the difficulties inherent in in vitro methods, where slightly different conditions (salt, detergent, protein, and DNA probe concentrations) may significantly affect the experimental readout and the ultimate data interpretation.3.3. Cellular proliferation state increases non-specific DNA-bindingWe discovered that the composition of protein complexes interacting with the DNA probes relates to the proliferation status of the cells used for NE preparation. Using a FDR threshold equal to 0.05, our analysis identified 13 proteins that bind to ds 16 and 30 bp DNA probes with significantly higher affinities during proliferation, compared with quiescent cells (Table 2). All these proteins are components of DNA repair process according to the GO annotation analysis (GO: 0006281). The fold change values of their relative abundances were significantly (P < 0.02; Mann–Whitney test) decreased by a competitor and by anti-Ku80 antibody depletion of NEs used in the binding reactions. Relative protein abundances in proliferating vs. resting cells, bound to ds DNA probesThe binding reactions with intact or Ku80-immunodepleted NEs from both proliferating and resting HeLa cells were performed with and without competitor. The eluted proteins were subjected to reduction, alkylation, tryptic digestion, and MS identification, followed by quantitative analysis of MS spectra. FC, fold change in protein abundance; ND, not detected; UP, detected only in proliferating HeLa cells, bold digits refer to statistically significant differences (adjusted P = 0.05).Relative protein abundances in proliferating vs. resting cells, bound to ds DNA probesThe binding reactions with intact or Ku80-immunodepleted NEs from both proliferating and resting HeLa cells were performed with and without competitor.

Again, the amount of the shifted ds probes increased with extension of time of serum induction of cells used for NE preparation. Results of a representative experiment with ds 16 bp DNA probes are presented in Fig. 4A. These results indicate that either expression of the non-specifically interacting proteins in proliferating cells is increased, or that there is an increased interaction with non-specific DNA-binding proteins, or both. To differentiate between these possibilities, we analysed equal amounts of proteins from NEs by western blotting, using anti-Ku80, anti-PARP1, and anti-hnRNP K antibodies. This analysis revealed equal amounts of Ku80 and hnRNP K in extracts from both resting and proliferating cells and moderately increased signal of PARP1 after 6 h of serum stimulation (Fig. 4B). Cellular proliferation state increases the affinity of non-specific DNA binders.

Histone modification at promoters with the palindromic motif TCTCGCGAGAChromatin is composed of nucleosomes, in which ~147 bp of DNA are wrapped 1.7 times around a core of two copies each of histone proteins H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. In vivo positioning and covalent modifications of nucleosomes play an important role in transcriptional regulation. Post-translational covalent modifications of histone proteins include methylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination. Such processes recruit and bind chromatin remodelling complexes which alter the configuration of the chromatin, and in turn, control gene transcription.27 There is a high degree of complexity in the number of enzymes, histone modifications, and variant histones involved in chromatin regulation.28 The spatial and temporal intricacies of the interactions of these factors with the genome suggest that chromatin regulation is at least as important to the transcriptional state of a gene as the DNA cis-elements and trans-factors present in its promoter. Thus, any complete study of the factors regulating gene expression must include the chromatin state at that gene's locus.The promoters of expressed genes are characterized by decreased nucleosome occupancy (particularly a nucleosome-free region around the transcription start site), acetylation of H3 and H4 histones (H3Ac and H4Ac), trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3), and the presence of histone destabilizing chromatin remodelling complexes.29 The overall effect of these modifications is a general decreased presence and stability of nucleosomes, and as a result, increased accessibility to transcription factors and the RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) complex. On the other hand, silenced genes are characterized by a different set of histone modifications and, in general, by denser chromatin architecture. Histone H3 lysine 9 and lysine 27 trimethylation levels (H3K9me3 and H3K27me3) are highest at silent genes.29To characterize the HNRNPK promoter in greater detail, we compared it to other promoters bearing the palindromic motif TCTCGCGAGA (HNRNPH—heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein H and RPS7—ribosomal protein S7), well-established constitutively active housekeeping genes (HGs) (TUBB6—Tubulin beta-6, GAPDH—glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), an immediate early gene (EGR1—early growth response 1), a heat shock-induced gene (HSP70—heat shock 70 kDa protein), and to a silent gene (HBB—beta globin). We measured histone modification and RNAPII complex levels during serum stimulation in a ChIP assay (Fig. 5). Promoter levels of RNA polymerase II and histone modifications. HeLa resting (0 h) and serum-treated cells (1, 6, and 24 h) were used in ChIP assays with antibodies against RNAPII, H3, H3Ac(K9/K18), H3K4me3, and H3K27me3. Isolated DNA was used in real-time PCR with primers to the promoters of HBB, HNRNPK, TUBB6, GAPDH, HNRNPH, RPS7, HSP70, and EGR1. Data are expressed as percent of input chromatin for RNAPII, or as ratios of modified histone marks to total H3 ChIP signals. Data represent the mean ± sd of four independent experiments.Promoter levels of RNA polymerase II and histone modifications. HeLa resting (0 h) and serum-treated cells (1, 6, and 24 h) were used in ChIP assays with antibodies against RNAPII, H3, H3Ac(K9/K18), H3K4me3, and H3K27me3. Isolated DNA was used in real-time PCR with primers to the promoters of HBB, HNRNPK, TUBB6, GAPDH, HNRNPH, RPS7, HSP70, and EGR1. Data are expressed as percent of input chromatin for RNAPII, or as ratios of modified histone marks to total H3 ChIP signals. Data represent the mean ± sd of four independent experiments.The RNAPII complex levels measured on HNRNPK, HNRNPH, and RPS7 were similar to those at the HGs (~10% of input), and remained relatively unchanged during serum stimulation. As expected, RNAPII levels at the HBB promoter were smallest, and levels at the EGR1 promoter after 1 h of serum treatment were 2-fold higher than quiescent cells, followed by a return to basal levels at 6 and 24 h. We also observed progressive accumulation of RNAPII at the HSP70 promoter during the serum time course, from 15.8% of input up to 24.1% in quiescent cells and after 24 h in serum, respectively (fold change = 1.52; Fig. 5, Supplementary Table S5).We subsequently analysed levels of acetylation of histone H3 lysine 9/18 (H3K9/18Ac), trimethylation of H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3), and trimethylation of H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) at the various promoters. Acetylation of lysines eliminates their positive charge which, when it occurs on certain histone tails, has been shown to have a negative effect on the higher order structure of chromatin, essentially making it more open. H3K9/18Ac is associated with actively transcribed genes.27 As expected, H3Ac levels were mirrored by the presence of RNAPII complexes, and remained similar during the serum stimulation on both palindromic and HG promoters. On the other hand, H3Ac levels measured at the EGR1 and HSP70 promoters were relatively smaller when compared with RNAPII amounts. The RNAPII/H3Ac ratios for EGR1 and HSP70 were 67:1 and 47:1, respectively, whereas the same measurement for the HBB promoter was 69:1. On the other hand, the ratios for both palindromic and HG promoters ranged from 11:1 for HNRNPH to 23:1 for RPS7 (Fig. 5, Supplementary Table S5). H3K4me3 is associated with the 5' ends of actively transcribed genes; H3K4me3 has been suggested to mark an open chromatin state by recruiting ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling complexes.27 H3K27me3, however, marks silenced genes,29 and appears to be dominant over other activating marks; genes that are marked with both K3K27me3 and H3K4me3 are typically silent. As expected, H3K4me3 was detected at the promoters of all analysed genes, including HBB. Also as expected, the H3K27me3 levels for all promoters were lower in comparison to levels at the transcriptionally silent HBB. In sum, these results indicate that RNAPII levels and histone modification levels at the promoters containing the palindromic motif TCTCGCGAGA are similar to those of constitutively active HG promoters.We also wished to determine whether any of the proteins belonging to the DNA double-strand break repair complexes, as determined by EMSA and MS (Table 2), were present at these promoters. Using ChIP, we measured the abundances of bound Ku80 and PARP1 at these promoters. PARP1 is responsible for the synthesis and attachment of polymers of ADP-ribose from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) to the glutamic or aspartic acid residues of target proteins.30 PARP1 binds to the HSP70 promoter in vivo,31 and therefore we used this gene as a ChIP positive control for PARP1 binding. Although Ku80 did not bind any of the studied promoters (data not shown), unexpectedly, our ChIP experiment demonstrated PARP1 binding not only to the HSP70 promoter, but to all promoters tested, with the highest level of bound PARP1 protein at the HBB promoter (Fig. 6A and B). Additionally, we tested an intergenic region and two sites within the rhodopsin (RHO) gene, where we found similar levels of PARP1 as measured at the HBB promoter (Fig. 6B), along with the expected depletion of RNAPII abundance (data not shown). Overall, the ChIP assays revealed ubiquitous binding of PARP1 to various promoters, with significantly higher abundance at heterochromatin sites (Fig. 6C). Distribution of PARP1 at heterochromatic and euchromatic sites. HeLa quiescent (0 h) and serum-treated cells (1, 6, and 24 h) were used in ChIP assays with antibodies against PARP1. Isolated DNA was used in real-time PCR with primers to the intergenic site, two sites within the RHO gene, and the promoter of HBB (A), as well as the promoters of HNRNPK, TUBB6, GAPDH, HNRNPH, RPS7, HSP70, and EGR1 (B). Data are expressed as percent of input chromatin and represent the mean ± sd of four independent experiments. (C) The comparison of PARP1 abundance at heterochromatic and euchromatic sites. The data represent an averaged % of input for all heterochromatin and euchromatin genes tested separately for each time point. The differences between heterochromatin and euchromatin in PARP1 occupancy were statistically significant (*P < 0.005; unpaired t-test) for all time points tested.Distribution of PARP1 at heterochromatic and euchromatic sites.

This possibility could explain the loss of signal in EMSA employing the mutated 16 nt ss probe, as the correct hairpin structure would be recognized by PARP1 both in vivo and in vitro. PARP1 was described as a structural component of heterochromatin that modulates transcription by self-modification in an NAD-dependent manner.37 Furthermore, it was shown in vitro that PARP1 is able to promote the compaction of nucleosomes into higher order structures when NAD+ is not present; on the contrary, saturating amounts of NAD+ caused decondensation.38 Overall, PARP1 acts as either an activator or a repressor of specific genes, depending on the physiological conditions,30 and we cannot rule out the possibility of its direct involvement in the regulation of promoters with the TCTCGCGAGA motif.3.5. Chromatin accessibility at promoters with the palindromic motif TCTCGCGAGADuring gene activation, nucleosomes are displaced and/or repositioned in a process involving histone modification, ATP-dependent nucleosome remodelling complexes, histone chaperones, and the shuffling of histone variants.28 Thus, characterizing global nucleosome positions and their chemical and compositional modifications is key to unravelling the mechanism of transcriptional regulation.The advent of massively parallel DNA sequencing technology has allowed the localization of every nucleosome across the genomes with a high degree of accuracy.39 We made use of publicly available databases to gain additional insight into chromatin structures surrounding promoters bearing the TCTCGCGAGA palindromic motif. We explored datasets provided by the ENCODE consortium within the Open Chromatin project, which, among other datasets, offers DNase I hypersensitive site (HS) tracks for multiple cell lines.19 DNase I HS sites contain a mixture of cis-regulatory elements, and it has been shown that there is a striking co-occurrence of HS with regions of well-positioned nucleosomes.40First, we examined the DNase I HS profile within the HNRNPK promoter (Fig. 7A), averaging the HS profile for four cell lines. This analysis revealed decreased values in the HS profile occurring at the palindromic motif, as well as an oscillating pattern of hypersensitive DNA that may represent a combination of trans-elements and positioned nucleosome occupancies within this region. Next, we extracted a HeLa dataset for 50 genes containing the palindromic motif TCTCGCGAGA, centred the dataset on that sequence, and superimposed all HS profiles averaged over a 150 bp window (Fig. 7B). This analysis revealed that TCTCGCGAGA may define the boundaries of open chromatin, as it is flanked by two distinct HS peaks corresponding to positioned nucleosomes. On the basis of this observation, we believe that the palindrome itself may demarcate nucleosomal positions within promoters bearing it, exhibiting features that prevent nucleosomal occupancy of this motif.

It is not surprising then, that transcription is carried out by a complex sequence of events, any combination of which may be regulated. Studies that investigate gene regulation are greatly facilitated by methods that characterize the interactions between proteins and DNA. Several methods have been developed to identify the direct binding of proteins to DNA sequences. In the classical DNA footprinting protocol, sequences that bind to a protein of interest are determined by identifying regions of DNA that are protected from digestion by exonuclease III or DNase I. The protected sequence corresponds to the ‘footprint’ the protein leaves on the DNA during digestion.41 Another classical method, EMSA, involves the retardation of a radiolabelled DNA probe by the binding of a protein of interest (or by a protein within a complex), indicating a molecular interaction.23 All of these methods involve the in vitro interaction between a recombinant or NE-extracted protein with a naked segment of DNA, eliminating the chromatin context and the possible modification state(s) of the protein of interest. Similarly, assays utilizing reporter genes fail to take into account the local chromatin context, whereas potential cis-elements (promoters and enhancers) are tested using transient transfections, in which the test plasmid remains unintegrated in the nucleus.20 Despite improvements in both computational prediction of functional DNA sites and experimental verification techniques, current methods allow only snapshots of the transcription process, and as such favour indirect conclusions.Recent advancements in high-throughput microarray (ChIP-chip) and sequencing methods (ChIP-Seq) have increased our understanding of chromatin composition, revealing transcription factor binding sites (TFBS),42,43 chromatin accessibility,44 histone modifications,45 and nucleosome positions39 on a genome-wide scale. These varied experimental datasets augment computational TFBS prediction methods, and aid in the description of transcriptional regulation on the scales of single genes to the entire genome.3.6. ConclusionsIn the present study, we have characterized the molecular features of the palindromic motif TCTCGCGAGA, found not only in the HNRNPK promoter but also, as described in our previous work,12 a potential cis-regulatory element of ~5% of human genes. We used a reporter system assay to show that out of four identified HNRNPK promoters, the one containing the palindromic motif exhibits the highest expression of a reporter gene. Although EMSA and MS analyses, performed to discover the palindrome-binding transcription factor, did identify a complex of DNA-binding proteins, neither method unambiguously identified the relevant direct trans-acting protein(s). Moreover, for a collection of proteins functionally implicated in DNA repair processes we observed that changes in their affinity to ds DNA probes are related to the proliferation status of the cells.To analyse the chromatin configuration at the HNRNPK promoter, we performed comparative ChIP experiments of RNAPII occupancy and histone modification density among the promoters of housekeeping, inducible, and silent genes. Our analysis revealed that promoters with the TCTCGCGAGA motif display properties of the promoters of HGs (GAPDH and TUBB6), containing similar RNAPII levels and relatively more H3Ac modifications than inducible and silent genes.The analyses of open chromatin data provided by the ENCODE project revealed that the TCTCGCGAGA motif has features that promote constitutive openness of the chromatin and favor DNA accessibility. This function could be due to the binding of an unknown transcription factor, a hairpin spatial structure preventing nucleosome occupancy, or both. In sum, experimental observations using in vitro methods and analyses of open chromatin data support the function of this sequence in local nucleosomal organization, resulting in the regulation of transcription of the HNRNPK gene. Our findings suggest that the TCTCGCGAGA motif may play a critical role in regulating and establishing nucleosome patterns at the promoters containing it. Further advancements in analytical methods should elucidate the comprehensive picture of the function of this motif in gene expression regulation.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by grants from the Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education: N401193 32/4033 and R13010 03 (MS software development).We thank Lucjan Wyrwicz for computational identification of potential HNRNPK promoters.Supplementary data"

Saccharomyces cereviceae is the major example where WGD has occurred ~100 million years ago.4,5 Genomic instability and massive gene loss promptly followed WGD and purged most of the newly formed gene copies from the yeast genome, retaining ~10% of them.4 In case of vertebrates, half of all duplicated genes have been maintained.6 The analysis of the human genome has shown that most of the human genes are duplicated.7 Nevertheless, what exactly guides gene duplicability for a particular organism still remains unclear. Two of the most well-known factors that guide gene duplication are (i) protein connectivity, defined as the number of links that a protein node has to other nodes in the protein–protein interaction network and (ii) protein complexity, defined as the number of subunits in a protein complex.8,9It has been previously found that protein connectivity is negatively correlated with gene duplicability (generally defined as the number of paralogs per gene family) in the case of yeast. That is, highly connected proteins (hubs) have a lower rate of duplication compared with lowly connected proteins (non-hub).10 However, this trend is opposite in the human case, where protein connectivity and gene duplicability are positively correlated.8 The reason behind this difference is that due to higher protein dosage in yeast, retention of gene duplicates might have a deleterious effect on the organism. But, in the case of mammals, due to a higher rate of diversification in the function of the gene duplicates, it becomes more robust against dosage increase.11,12Protein complexity might also be another important factor that influences gene duplicability. According to their fates, duplicated genes found within protein complex networks belong to one of the three categories: (i) intra-complex paralogs that remain within the same protein complex, (ii) bi-complex paralog when resulting genes function within two separate complexes and (iii) overhang, when the resulting genes posses no general association with a known protein complex.13 Duplication of a subunit in a protein complex might also cause dosage imbalance if rapid sub-functionalization or neo-functionalization does not occur to the newly arisen genes.14 Therefore, duplication of a subunit of a protein complex is less likely to be successful than the duplication of a monomer.14 The proportion of unduplicated genes is high (=65%) for both monomers and multimers in yeast, whereas it is less (=30%) in humans9 since complex organisms are more robust against dosage increase. Detailed studies on yeast protein complexes showed that most of the participating subunits of multiprotein complexes are under tightly regulated gene dosage. These proteins are encoded mainly by haploinsufficient (wild type recessive) genes.14 This is in agreement with the central prediction of the physiological theory which states that, genes encoding proteins whose functions tend to be insensitive to protein dosage should typically be haplosufficient (dominant wild type).15 Eventually, human haploinsufficient genes have, on the average, more paralogs than haplosufficient ones because additional products of these genes probably lead to increased fitness.15Recently it has been observed that protein connectivity and protein complexity complement each other in guiding the evolutionary rates of human proteins.16 Moreover, it has been reported that gene duplicability decreases with the increase in the number of subunits in protein complex, though this rate of decrease is fairly slow for humans compared with yeast.8,9 In the present study, we investigated the interrelationship among the three features viz. gene duplicability, protein connectivity and protein complexity, in proteins that are present both in protein complexes network as well as in the protein–protein interaction network. Our analysis reveals that the human protein–protein interaction network has a larger influence on a gene to be duplicated. Moreover, we found that non-hub proteins in the complex are duplicated as well as hub proteins, indicating that protein complexity can also increase gene duplicability, in contrast to previous reports.9 Analyses of haploinsufficient proteins of both humans and yeast suggest that organismal complexity (defined as a measure of the number of different cell types in an organism), as well as the higher rate of functional divergence of human protein complexes, has a large influence on higher duplicability.2 Materials and methods2.1. Protein–protein interaction dataAll human protein–protein interaction data were taken from the Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD) release 7 (http://www.hprd.org/download), which is essentially a database covering thousands of protein–protein interactions, posttranslational modifications, enzyme/substrates relationships, disease associations, tissue expression and subcellular localization. The data were extracted from the literature manually by biologists who read and interpreted >300 000 published articles during the annotation process17 where a total of 9386 unique protein interactors were found. Proteins with more than five interactions were considered as hub proteins and proteins with one or two interacting partners were considered as non-hub proteins.16,18 All yeast protein–protein interaction data were collected from Li et al.,10 where protein–protein interaction pairs were collected from various high throughput experiments and databases. This collection was combined with another high throughput dataset of Bader et al.19 Subsequently, many small-scale experiments were performed to obtain a larger high confidence dataset.10 This high confidence dataset (http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/vol0/issue2005/images/data/msi249/DC1/msi249supp2.txt) is taken for our analysis of yeast proteins. Finally, we considered 1732 human (Supplementary Table S1) and 1269 yeast proteins (Supplementary Table S2) for which both protein–protein interaction data as well as protein complex data are available.2.2. Identification of protein complexesWe obtained the list of human protein complexes from http://mips.gsf.de/genre/proj/corum. A total of 1345 number of protein complexes20 were found (Supplementary Table S3). The protein complex data for yeast was collected from Gavin et al.21 (http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v440/n7084/extref/nature04532-s3.pdf; Supplementary Table S4).The protein complexes having >10 subunits were classified as large complexes and complexes having less than 10 subunits were considered as small complex.2.3. Identification of haploinsufficient genesHuman haploinsufficient gene sequences were taken from Dang et al.22 where haploinsufficient genes have mainly been collected from PubMed and OMIM search results with one of the major keyword being haploinsufficient and spurious hits were gradually removed by comparing against known human gene names and symbols22 (http://www.nature.com/ejhg/journal/v16/n11/suppinfo/ejhg2008111s1.html?url=/ejhg/journal/v16/n11/abs/ejhg2008111a.html, Yeast haploinsufficient genes are collected from Deutschbauer et al.23 (http://www.genetics.org/cgi/content/full/genetics.104.036871/DC1). These haploinsufficient proteins are generally collected from yeast deletion strain experiments on YPD and minimal media.2.4. Identification of paralogsThe paralogs for both humans and yeast were taken from ensemble paralog database version 52. The general steps followed by the ensemble24 for identifying paralogs sequences are based mainly on the construction of the gene tree reconciled with the species tree formed by the cluster of aligned sequences obtained from BLASTP. True paralogy for every pair of genes in the gene tree has been inferred by calculating the dN/dS ratio. This method not only enables the detection of true paralogs but also helps discard misleaded paralogs obtained from domain fusion. Finally, true paralog sets in humans were downloaded from the ensemble using 30% similarity between two sequences, and the alignable region between two sequences is >80% of the longer protein.19 Thus, a total set of 9609 number of duplicated proteins in humans and 1604 duplicated proteins in yeast were identified. Among these 9609 human paralogs only 664 genes (Supplementary Table S5) having paralogs are present both in the protein–protein interaction network as well as protein complex, network and in the case of yeast, 182 genes (Supplementary Table S6) having paralog have been identified, present in both networks.2.5. Statistical analysisAll statistical analyses were performed by the software SPSS and TANAGRA. We measured Spearman rank correlation for both bivariate and partial correlations, as our data values were mostly repetitive, and Spearman rank correlations have been calculated after finding rank of the values. As a result, extreme variations in values have less control over the correlation. Simple bivariate correlation may be biased due to the presence of other factors and therefore Spearman's partial correlation coefficient was calculated after eliminating the confounded factors. Additionally, we performed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) through SPSS.3. Results3.1. Protein connectivity, protein complexity and gene duplicabilityIn order to examine how the gene duplicability in humans as well as in yeast are influenced by protein connectivity and protein complexity, we collected 1732 human and 1269 yeast proteins for which both protein–protein interaction data and protein complex annotation were available. Non-parametric Spearman's correlations for both protein connectivity and protein complexity with the gene duplicability of human genes reveal that, gene duplicability is negatively correlated (Spearman rank test; R = -0.111, P < 0.001) with protein complexity and positively correlated (Spearman rank test; R = 0.169, P < 0.001) with protein connectivity. In order to examine whether these two factors independently influence gene duplicability, we computed Spearman's partial correlation analysis between gene duplicability and one of the two factors by controlling the other. We observed that correlation between protein complexity and gene duplicability diminished drastically when protein connectivity was kept controlled (<U+03C1> = -0.080, P < 0.001), whereas positive correlation existed between protein connectivity and gene duplicability when protein complexity was controlled (<U+03C1> = 0.150, P < 0.001). The same trend was also observed by computing the Pearson partial correlation coefficient which showed that protein complexity did not have any correlation with gene duplicability when protein connectivity was controlled (<U+03C1> = 0.035, P = 7.6 × 10-2), but the effect of protein connectivity remained when protein complexity was controlled (<U+03C1> = 0.158, P < 0.001). These results suggest that protein connectivity is the more important factor for gene duplicability in humans, although the effect of protein complexity over gene duplicability is guided mainly by protein connectivity. Moreover, a significant negative correlation (R = -0.201, P < 0.001) was found between protein connectivity and protein complexity. This correlation holds even when gene duplicability is controlled (<U+03C1> = -0.186, P < 0.001).To test the independence of the sample points we removed those paralogs which are present in the protein complex and performed the same analysis. We obtained the same trend, that is, gene duplicability is negatively correlated with protein complexity (R = -0.121, P < 0.001) whereas it is positively correlated with protein connectivity (R = 0.065, P = 4.7 × 10-2) and protein connectivity and protein complexity are negatively correlated with each other (R = -0.225, P < 0.001). This indicates that shared gene duplicability does not have any bias on our analysis.All the above analyses have been applied in the case of yeast genes. Non-parametric Spearman's correlation between protein complexity and gene duplicability revealed that gene duplicability is negatively correlated (R = -0.236, P < 0.001) with protein complexity. The same trend (though with reduced correlation value) was observed when Spearman's correlation was determined between protein connectivity and gene duplicability (R = -0.074, P = 2.8 × 10-2). However, there is no significant correlation between protein connectivity and protein complexity. Spearman's partial correlation analysis demonstrates that both protein connectivity (<U+03C1> = -0.077, P = 2.37 × 10-3) and protein complexity (<U+03C1> = -0.237, P < 0.001) affect gene duplicability independently. This has been further supported by Pearson partial correlation which also finds independent correlation for protein connectivity (<U+03C1> = -0.136, P < 0.001) as well as for protein complexity (<U+03C1> = -0.172, P < 0.001).In order to evaluate how the position of a protein in the protein–protein interaction network influences gene duplicability, we correlated gene duplicability with the protein's centrality which is measured in terms of closeness (average number of nodes connecting a protein to all other proteins) and betweenness (measures the frequency with which a node lies on the shortest path between all other nodes) of a protein in the protein–protein interaction network.26 In both the human and yeast genes, we found that protein connectivity is positively correlated with both these parameters (R = 0.791, P < 0.001) and (R = 0.901, P < 0.001), respectively, in case of humans and (R = 0.779, P < 0.001) and (R = 0.560, P < 0.001), respectively, in case of yeast. These results indicate that the relationship between protein connectivity and gene duplicability is in the same direction as that of protein's centrality, that is, closeness and betweenness (R = 0.220, P < 0.001) and (R = 0.160, P < 0.001), respectively, in case of humans and (R = -0.118, P = 9 × 10-3, R = -0.183, P < 0.001), respectively, in case of yeast.At this point, it is worthwhile to mention that the protein–protein interaction data come from a variety of methods and the percentage of interactions determined by various methods may differ between yeasts and human. Therefore, it is important to make sure that the differing trends are not simply due to different types of methods used in determining protein connectivity in protein–protein interaction network. In order to test this we have collected all the 7328 interaction data of humans as well as 4127 interaction data of yeast from yeast two-hybrid experiments of which 561 human proteins and 1032 yeast proteins are part of both protein complex and the protein–protein interaction network. We found the same trend when we performed our analysis on genes from yeast two-hybrid experiments (Supplementary Table S7).Moreover, it has been reported that human protein complexes are more robust against dosage than yeast protein complexes due to their high organismal complexity. Therefore, we have investigated the effect of gene dosage over human and yeast protein complexes.3.2. Combinatorial effects of protein dosage, gene duplicability, protein connectivity and protein complexityThe role of protein complex network on gene duplication can only be estimated by evaluating the known dose sensitive complex proteins, i.e. the haploinsufficient proteins27 present in the protein complex. Haploinsufficiency occurs when a diploid organism only has a single functional copy of a gene (with the other copy inactivated by mutation) and the single functional copy of the gene does not produce enough gene product (typically a protein) to bring about a wild type condition. Studies show that mutation or loss of a single allele may be sufficient to exert diseased cellular phenotypes.28 This gene dosage effect results in haploinsufficiency. Thus, haploinsufficient gene needs both of its alleles to be functional in order to express the wild type.Analyzing 299 human haploinsufficint genes obtained from Dang et al.22 it has been found that 59 proteins are present in both the protein complex and the protein–protein interaction network, of which 21 (36%) are duplicated. A detailed study of these proteins shows that protein connectivity is not at all correlated with gene duplicability whereas protein complexity has a positive correlation (R = 0.228, P = 3.5 × 10-2) with gene duplicability. Again we have also collected all the haploinsufficient data for humans from the OMIM to get a larger dataset. In that dataset where we have collected a total of 410 human haploinsufficient proteins of which 32 duplicated haploinsufficient proteins that are present in both the protein complex as well as in the protein–protein interaction network among the 83 (~39%) proteins present in both protein–protein interaction as well as protein complex network. In this dataset also we have obtained the same result as the previous, that is, protein complexity is positively correlated (R = 0.213, P = 2.18 × 10-2) whereas no correlation exists between protein connectivity and gene duplicability (R = 0.008, P = 9.24 × 10-1). This trend has also been found in the protein–protein interaction dataset verified by the yeast two-hybrid experimental method where protein complexity is also positively correlated with gene duplicability (R = 0.247, P = 2.7 × 10-2). However, the trend is the opposite in the case of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where out of 184 haploinsufficient proteins collected from Deutschbauer et al.,23 79 are found to be present in both the protein–protein interaction network as well as in the protein complex, of which only 12 (15%) are duplicated. After analysis it has been found that protein complexity is negatively correlated (R = -0.183, P = 2.8 × 10-2) with gene duplicability whereas protein connectivity is not correlated with gene duplicability (R = 0.0661, P = 4.32 × 10-1). The same trend has been observed for protein–protein interaction data obtained by the yeast two-hybrid experiment case of protein complexity (R = -0.154, P = 3.8 × 10-2).But in both the cases of humans and yeast, the correlation between protein complexity and the number of paralogs per gene exists when connectivity is controlled (<U+03C1> = 0.247, P = 1.15 × 10-2) for human and (<U+03C1> = -0.1775, P = 3.4 × 10-2) for yeast whereas, protein connectivity does not have any significant correlation when complexity is controlled (<U+03C1> = 0.1917, P = 7.05 × 10-2). Partial correlation with our new data also suggest the same trend, that is, protein complexity is positively correlated (<U+03C1> = 0.231, P = 1.27 × 10-2) and protein connectivity does not have any correlation at all (<U+03C1> = 0.0941, P = 3.17 × 10-2). Even Pearson partial correlation also shows the positive trend of protein complexity towards gene duplicability even when protein connectivity is controlled (<U+03C1> = 0.068 P = 5.34 × 10-1). Moreover, a significant negative correlation (R = -0.269, P = 1.2 × 10-2) was found between protein connectivity and protein complexity in human haploinsufficient proteins which remains while gene duplicability is controlled (<U+03C1> = -0.307, P = 4.16 × 10-3). This negative correlation is even increased in the analysis with the new data (R = -0.361, P < 0.001). The above results from humans suggest that, if haploinsufficient genes are present in the protein complex, protein connectivity is not the most influencing factor, but it helps protein complexity to play. However, the inverse correlation between gene duplicability and protein complexity in yeast haploinsufficient proteins, might be due to their differential organismal complexity between two organisms.9The data from the yeast haploinsufficient proteins supports the ‘balance hypotheses’ as well as the existence of strong dose sensitivity of this organism.14However, in the analysis of complex proteins without any haploinsufficient genes it has been observed that protein complexity is negatively correlated with gene duplicability in both yeast and humans as observed earlier (Supplementary Table S8). This result suggests that in protein complexes where haploinsufficient genes are absent, the effect of protein connectivity within the protein–protein interaction network is more predominant than that of protein complexity on gene duplication.3.3. Effect of protein connectivity, and protein complexity on gene duplicability in humansThe differences in the correlations of the two different types of connectivities with gene duplicability prompted us to study the differences of additional parameters namely, protein complexity, protein connectivity and gene duplicability in these two groups of proteins (Table 1). From the Table 1 it is evident that there is no significant difference in average protein connectivity as well as in average number of paralogs per gene in haploinsufficient proteins and in proteins where haploinsufficient proteins are absent. However, in one case protein connectivity is positively correlated (where haploinsufficint proteins are absent) and in the other case protein connectivity does not have any correlation (in haploinsufficient proteins present in both the protein–protein interaction network and protein complex network) with gene duplicability. At the same time the differences between complex sizes in these two groups are also apparent (Table 1). But, in both the cases protein connectivity and protein complexity are negatively correlated. Connectivity, complexity and average number of paralogs per gene across haploinsufficient proteins and after removal of haploinsufficient proteins in humanNote. Average complexity means average number of subunits per complex in a particular group of proteins and average interactions indicate average protein connectivity in the protein–protein interaction network of a particular group of proteins.Connectivity, complexity and average number of paralogs per gene across haploinsufficient proteins and after removal of haploinsufficient proteins in humanNote. Average complexity means average number of subunits per complex in a particular group of proteins and average interactions indicate average protein connectivity in the protein–protein interaction network of a particular group of proteins.Thus, when we have estimated the average number of paralogs for both highly connected (hub) (445 number of proteins) and lowly connected (non-hub) (96 number of proteins) proteins present in the protein complex (excluding 117 proteins which have an intermediate connectivity between 3 and 5), we found, surprisingly, that both hub and non-hub proteins present in protein complex show nearly equal (Mann–Whitney U-test; P = 0.128) average number of paralogs (Fig. 1). Again we have also verified this trend by remodeling hub and non-hub data, that is, taking hub proteins of connectivity >9 and non-hub proteins as connectivity 1 and we have obtained the same result, that is, both hub and non-hub proteins present in the complex show nearly the same gene duplicability (Mann–Whitney U-test; P = 0.533). But the significant difference in average number of paralogs between hub and non-hub proteins in both the methods reappear (Mann–Whitney U-test; P = 0.012, P = 0.015) after removing both of the hub and non-hub proteins present in the protein complex. These results suggest that protein connectivity influences more protein complexity that guides gene duplicability. But when this factor fails to correlate directly, then the other factor, i.e. protein complexity, plays its role. Average number of paralogs per gene of highly connected (hub) and lowly connected (non-hub) protein present in the protein complex.Average number of paralogs per gene of highly connected (hub) and lowly connected (non-hub) protein present in the protein complex.This explains the higher duplicability of non-hub proteins in the protein complex. In this case since these proteins are poorly connected, the protein's complexity guides the duplicability. Since most of the non-hub proteins are part a of large complex (average complexity 26.75–27) we aimed to analyze what exactly happens to protein connectivity and gene duplicability in large and small protein complexes and, interestingly, we found that there is a significant difference in average connectivity as well as average complex size between the large and small complexes [average connectivity of large complex is 18 and average connectivity of small complex is 32 (Mann–Whitney U-test; P < 0.001] and the average complexity of the large complex is 30 and average complexity of the small complex is 5 (Mann–Whitney U-test; P < 0.001)). However, there is no significant difference in the paralog number of the large and small complexes (average paralog number of large complex is 2.17 while average paralog number of the small complex is 2.31, respectively). From the above result it is evident that though there is a significant difference in protein connectivity between large and small protein complexes there exist no significant differences in average paralog numbers between these two groups of proteins. So, if protein connectivity is the most effective factor for the duplication of a gene, then the average paralog number of small complexes has to be greater than that of large complexes. But this is not the case. This indicates that there is a significant role of protein complexity over gene duplicability. The results indicate that protein complexity has a positive role in increasing gene duplicability. This result has further been validated by analyzing proteins present in the large complex (complex size is =10). In the large complex group, we surprisingly found that, both protein connectivity and protein complexity are positively correlated with gene duplicability. These correlations hold true even when both the connectivity and complexity are controlled separately (Table 2). The actual distribution of gene duplicability with respect to protein complexity and protein connectivity in the case of human is shown in Fig. 2. Correlation between protein connectivity and gene duplicability as well as between gene duplicability and protein complexity in large complexes in human genesCorrelation between protein connectivity and gene duplicability as well as between gene duplicability and protein complexity in large complexes in human genesThe distribution showing the relation of gene duplicability in overall complex, large complex and protein connectivity in human.The distribution showing the relation of gene duplicability in overall complex, large complex and protein connectivity in human.We used the PCA using a correlation coefficient matrix in order to disentangle the contributions of protein complexity and protein connectivity to gene duplicability. The dominant eigen vectors (taken as equal or >1) that emerge from this analysis can be interpreted as the one of the contributors guiding gene duplication. The first principal component accounts for 59.37% of the total variance and both protein complexity and protein connectivity have equal contributions on this factor.We have also checked the results for the protein–protein interaction data collected by the yeast two-hybrid experiment and we found that both protein connectivity and protein complexity are positively correlated with gene duplicability (R = 0.132, P < 0.001; R = 0.208, P < 0.001), respectively.Increase in one component of protein complex can change the stoichiometry of other participating proteins of that complex and hence the net effect may be deleterious for that complex. Therefore, the fixation of the duplicate gene can only happen if rapid sub-functionalization or neo-functionalization can occur in the duplicated genes.To find what actually happens to the duplicated genes of large complexes, we have analyzed two large complexes separately namely, Splicesome complex and Nop56p-associated pre-rRNA complex. It has been found that for the Spliceosome complex out of 148 subunits only 36 subunits are duplicated, i.e. 24.34% (36/148) subunits are duplicated which gives rise to total 47 unique number of paralogs, of which 18 remain in the complex and most of these proteins are bi-complex paralogs whereas, 14 out of these 18 proteins have a tendency to remain within the same complex. So, due to the duplication 61.70% of overhangs are produced from the Spliceosome complex (Table 3). Analysis of human Spliceosome, Nop56p-associated pre-rRNA and overall complex to estimate the percentage of overhang generated in each caseAnalysis of human Spliceosome, Nop56p-associated pre-rRNA and overall complex to estimate the percentage of overhang generated in each caseIn the case of Nop56p-associated pre-rRNA complex the same trend is followed. Out of 104 subunits of the complex 50 subunits are duplicated to give a total 134 unique number of paralogs, of which 14 are retained in the complex (4 retain in same complex). So only 10.44% paralogs are part of the protein complexes and the rest remain as overhang outside the complex (Table 3).Moreover, analysis of the duplicated genes of the whole human protein complex reveals that most of the duplicated complex proteins are overhangs (926/1290) × 100 = 71.78%, i.e. they remain outside the complex (Table 3).This result is just the opposite of yeast, where very few overhangs are produced.13 This may be the effect of higher rate of functional divergence of duplicate genes in case of humans, which is not so rapid for a simple organism like yeast. Moreover, human protein complexes are more robust against dosage than yeast protein complexes.9 All these results lead us to conclude that organismal complexity is the important factor which causes higher duplicability of mammalian genes sometimes by protein connectivity within protein–protein interaction network or by proteins belongingness to complexes.4. DiscussionsIn our earlier studies, while investigating the role of evolutionary rate and intrinsic disorder on protein connectivity in the protein–protein interaction network as well as in protein complex assembly in humans, we have found that both protein connectivity and protein complexity complement each other in a mutually exclusive manner.16 But, the role of protein connectivity in the protein–protein interaction network as well as in protein complex assembly on gene duplicability was yet to be understood. In earlier studies it has been reported that in the case of humans, gene duplicability is positively correlated with protein connectivity in the protein–protein interaction network, but in the case of yeast gene duplicability is negatively correlated with protein connectivity.8 These may be the reasons for rapid functional divergence of the duplicate genes in the case of humans, which is not true in a simple organism like yeast as proposed by Yang et al. (2003)9 where they have shown a strong positive correlation between proportion of duplicate gene pairs with the divergence of gene expression and both synonymous and non-synonymous divergence.14 Higher duplicability of essential genes in the case of humans may promote organismal complexity, as gene essentiality is positively correlated with protein connectivity.8 But, in the case of yeast, higher duplicability of less-important genes was found.29 These may cause duplicability to be increased with protein connectivity in case of human. If this phenomenon is true for humans, then protein connectivity within protein complex can also promote higher gene duplicability in humans. We have obtained equal rate of duplication for both hub and non-hub proteins present in protein complex. From the higher duplicability of non-hub proteins we may say that protein's belongingness to a complex may also promote gene duplicability in the positive direction. But till date it has been concluded that the higher the belongingness in a complex, lesser is the duplication. This is true for both humans and yeast. This motivated us to study the combined effect of protein connectivity and protein complexity over gene duplicability in the case of humans. Our study reveals that when combined, although apparently it seems that protein connectivity has a significant positive correlation with gene duplicability and protein complexity has a significant negative correlation with gene duplicability, detailed studies show that protein connectivity has an immense effect on protein complexity and hence acts as a modulating factor for increasing gene duplicability. So when protein connectivity increases, protein complexity decreases, and both of these phenomena will lead to higher duplicability of a gene which is schematically explained further by Fig. 3A. But, eventually what happens to that case where protein connectivity fails to control duplicability directly? That is, in the case of haploinsufficient genes which are present in the protein complex. It has been found that in case of human haploinsufficient genes protein complexity is positively correlated with gene duplicability whereas no significant correlation has been found with protein connectivity in the protein–protein interaction network. This signifies when the connectivity within the protein–protein interaction network is absent; then connectivity within the complex plays the same role of connectivity within protein–protein interaction network, which is schematically explained further by Fig. 3B. This positive correlation becomes more prominent when we consider the paralogs which are produced from proteins of large complexes. Comparison of relationship between protein connectivity, protein complexity over gene duplicability (A) when both are influencing gene duplication; (B) when only complexity influencing gene duplication.Comparison of relationship between protein connectivity, protein complexity over gene duplicability (A) when both are influencing gene duplication; (B) when only complexity influencing gene duplication.This also confirms our earlier findings that non-hub proteins in the complex are as duplicated as hub proteins in the complex. Eventually, we have found that non-hub proteins are mostly part of large complexes. So, this also supports the idea that protein connectivity within the protein complex plays the same role as protein connectivity within the protein–protein interaction network, and the negative correlation enables them to work in a mutually exclusive manner. But, the theory can only be supported if the protein product produced from the participating gene of the complex undergoes the following fates. Firstly, if rapid functional divergence occurs to these proteins so that the duplicated protein is not part of the complex at all, then this would not affect the dosage of the participating complex. Secondly, if the duplicated protein enhances the topology of the complex which may enhance the total complex assembly, then the enhanced dosage of the particular gene would have no effect over the protein complex.8,30 Thirdly, a multimer protein might tend to be involved in more functions than a monomer. So the rapid functional divergence of the multimer protein may promote functional divergence more rapidly. So, if the duplicated gene does undergo through the above fates, then the enhanced dosage of that particular gene may have a deleterious effect on the whole complex. Essentially, our analysis reveals that most of the proteins produced from complexes are not part of the complex and this higher rate of diversification is not found in case of yeast. That is why, in the case of yeast the higher the association within complex lesser is the duplicability.So, in case of both humans and yeast, protein connectivity in the protein–protein interaction network as well as in the protein complex behaves in the same manner. But, in addition to this, in the case of human there exists a negative correlation between these two sorts of connectivities, which is absent in the case of yeast. In yeast these two connectivities act as two different forces that control in the same negative direction. But in case of a complex organism like humans the higher rate of duplication for a particular gene may be the cause of either connectivity in the protein–protein interaction network or perhaps connectivity within the protein complex. Hence, organismal complexity promotes protein complexity as well as protein connectivity to behave differently due to different dosage effect on these two organisms. In both the cases the higher divergence of the duplicated protein does not affect network assembly. This may be the effect of organismal complexity which has a major effect on gene duplicability.Supplementary DataSupplementary Data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingDepartment of Biotechnology, Govt of India (Sanction no 102/IFD/SAN/PR-1860/2008-2009).We thank the Department of Biotechnology, Govt. of India for financial help.

IntroductionFollowing the sequencing of the Arabidopsis thaliana genome in 20001 and the Oryza sativa genome in 2005,2 several complete or nearly complete flowering plant genomes have been released.3–10 In addition, large-scale sequencing projects of important cereal crops are currently being undertaken by international consortia, including the International Barley Sequencing Consortium (http://www.barleygenome.org) and the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium (http://www.wheatgenome.org).11,12 It is expected that accelerating genome sequencing technologies, such as next-generation sequencing, will lead to a dramatic increase in the genomic DNA data to be annotated.13,14 Therefore, to cope with the deluge of emerging sequence information, the development of an efficient annotation system is needed.Exon–intron structures and the protein-coding sequences (CDSs) in genome sequences can be predicted either by ab initio predictions or by sequence similarity methods. While ab initio gene prediction programs may produce erroneous exon–intron structures,15–17 sequence similarity approaches generally show better results, although the number of available sequences in the current databases limits the number of genes that can be predicted. Tens of thousands of full-length cDNAs (FLcDNAs), which can be used to accurately determine exon–intron structures,4,18–21 are available for O. sativa, Zea mays, and A. thaliana, and the quality of their genome annotations is generally thought to be high. In other species, however, sufficient numbers of FLcDNAs are not necessarily available for the corresponding genomes. To fully utilize FLcDNA resources, algorithms for interspecies mapping, which show better gene structure annotation than ab initio predictions, have been developed.22,23Identification of CDS regions is a crucial step in genome annotation. However, low sequence conservation at the 5'- and 3'-ends of FLcDNAs between different species frequently results in truncated CDSs. To solve this problem, we present a pipeline that is based on interspecies FLcDNA mapping to genomes, which predicts exon–intron structures and the CDSs. In this pipeline, both ends of truncated CDSs are extended so that the complete CDSs are obtained. Our FLcDNA mapping pipeline was validated and compared with two other cDNA mapping programs—sim4cc23 and GeneSeqer24—as well as three ab initio gene prediction methods. In addition, we estimated how many sequences would be needed for exhaustive gene identification by interspecies mapping. Finally, for comprehensive gene identification, we applied our pipeline to the 10 genomes of the following flowering plants: O. sativa cv. Nipponbare, Z. mays, Sorghum bicolor, Brachypodium distachyon, A. thaliana, Lotus japonicus, Populus trichocarpa, Glycine max, Vitis vinifera, and Carica papaya.2. Materials and methods2.1. FLcDNAs, genome sequences, and reference data setsWe retrieved 179 991 FLcDNAs from A. thaliana,18,20,21O. sativa,25,26O. rufipogon,27Hordeum vulgare,28Z. mays,29–31G. max,32P. trichocarpa,33Triticum aestivum,34 and Solanum lycopersicum35 from the sources listed in Supplementary Table S1. The genome sequences and annotations of O. sativa,2S. bicolor,3Z. mays,4B. distachyon,5A. thaliana,36P. trichocarpa,6V. vinifera,7C. papaya,8L. japonicus,9 and G. max10 were downloaded from the web sites listed in Supplementary Table S2. For validation of predicted exon–intron structures and the CDSs, reference data sets, based on the intraspecies mapping method of the Rice Annotation Project,19,37 were used (Supplementary Table S3). To enhance the accuracy of the validations, we used only the loci that had the same CDS structures as the corresponding CDSs from other sources: the MSU6.138 data set for O. sativa, the TAIR 9.0 representative CDSs36 for A. thaliana, and the B73 RefGen_v1 Filtered Gene Set4 for Z. mays. If more than one CDS was predicted in a locus of Z. mays, the longest one was selected.2.2. Pipeline of interspecies mapping and CDS identificationFigure 1 shows an overview of our new interspecies mapping pipeline that simultaneously identifies CDSs on predicted loci. Repetitive sequences on FLcDNAs were masked by RepeatMasker (http://www.repeatmasker.org) with the MIPS Repeat Element Database (mips-REdat 4.3)39 and the ‘complete set’ of the Triticeae Repeat Sequence Database release 10 (http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/ITMI/Repeats/). Vector sequences were removed by the cross_match program. PolyA stretches were discarded using a custom-made program. Sequences with total unmasked lengths of 30 bp or more were used. An overview of the interspecies mapping algorithm.An overview of the interspecies mapping algorithm.Before precise alignment between FLcDNAs and a genome, we first used blastn to approximately define genomic regions that correspond to FLcDNAs. We used est2genome40 to align FLcDNAs to the corresponding genomic regions selected by blastn. Next, we invented methods to solve three problems with interspecies alignment (Fig. 2). Because tandemly duplicated genes tended to be accidentally combined into one gene during alignments, we divided these regions such that each region contained only one candidate gene and aligned the FLcDNAs to each region (Supplementary Fig. S1). To improve the detection of exon–intron boundaries by est2genome, multiple lines of transcript evidence were employed as follows. We scored introns using linear discriminant analyses, based on a splice site model and alignments around the splice sites, such that the most probable intron is selected (for details, see Supplementary Methods). Finally, we also discarded short introns whose length was <50 bp because the percentage of such short introns identified by intraspecies mapping was 10 times smaller than that by interspecies mapping (Supplementary Fig. S2). Problems with interspecies mapping. Alignment errors between a given FLcDNA and genome sequence pair have three possible causes. (A) Multiple duplicated genes encompassed by a single cDNA. (B) Erroneously short introns. (C) Alignment errors around splice sites.Problems with interspecies mapping. Alignment errors between a given FLcDNA and genome sequence pair have three possible causes. (A) Multiple duplicated genes encompassed by a single cDNA. (B) Erroneously short introns. (C) Alignment errors around splice sites.CDSs in predicted transcripts were determined on the basis of homology searches by blastx41 against the Uniprot42 and RefSeq43 databases. If no homologs were found in the protein databases, GeneMark44 was used, or the longest CDSs were employed. Either the 5'- or the 3'-end was frequently truncated after interspecies mapping because of the relatively low sequence conservation observed for CDS termini. Therefore, both ends of the mapped transcripts were extended so that predicted CDSs contained the start and the stop codons. Finally, from a set of overlapping transcripts in a given locus, a single representative transcript that had the longest CDS was selected.2.3 Evaluation of gene predictionsTo evaluate our methods, we compared the exon–intron structures and the CDSs derived from the interspecies mapping with the aforementioned reference sets of O. sativa, Z. mays, and A. thaliana. We evaluated only the predictions that overlapped with the reference set. Exon–intron boundaries, introns, all introns within a reference CDS (referred to as ‘all introns’ hereafter), and the entire CDSs were examined. We evaluated mapping results for each FLcDNA. Specificity (SP) was defined as TP/(TP + FP), and sensitivity (SN) was defined as TP/(TP + FN), where TP is the number of true positives, FP is the number of false positives, and FN is the number of false negatives. Single-exon genes were considered only in the CDS evaluation because they have no introns. To evaluate the CDS extension process, we examined whether the start and the stop codons of the reference set were included in the predictions. Reference CDSs that did not overlap with predictions were not used.To investigate relationships between the nucleotide identity and mapping ratio, the nucleotide identity between a given FLcDNA and the genomic locus to which it was assigned by est2genome was calculated. The mapping ratio represents the percentage of FLcDNAs that were mapped by est2genome divided by all FLcDNAs used. To investigate correlations between nucleotide identity and SP, we selected representative CDSs for each species and calculated the SP of gene predictions between species for genomes and FLcDNAs.2.4 Comparison with other programsThe newly developed annotation pipeline described in the present work was compared with three ab initio gene prediction tools, including GeneZilla,45 GlimmerHMM,46 and GeneMark.hmm.47 The options for O. sativa gene predictions were employed in GlimmerHMM and GeneMark.hmm predictions. For GeneZilla, we randomly selected 5000 genes from the rice annotation37 and used 4124, which contained both the start and the stop codons, to create a training model. Our annotation pipeline also was compared with other cDNA mapping programs, including sim4cc23 and GeneSeqer.24,48 We mapped 71 801 monocot FLcDNAs to the O. sativa genome with the default parameters of sim4cc and GeneSeqer. Alignments that covered 40% or more of FLcDNAs were selected for comparison of prediction efficiency. For the GeneSeqer predictions, the longest representative CDS was selected if multiple transcripts were aligned to one locus.2.5 Estimating the number of shared genes in monocots3 Results and discussion3.1 Validation of interspecies mappingTo evaluate our pipeline, we aligned 71 801 FLcDNAs obtained from three monocots (H. vulgare, Z. mays, and T. aestivum) to the O. sativa genome. From this, a total of 54 004 (75.2%) non-rice monocot FLcDNAs were mapped and clustered into 22 500 loci, from which 22 142 CDSs were predicted in the O. sativa genome. If these CDSs overlapped with the reference CDSs, we examined SP and SN for exon–intron boundaries, introns, all introns, and the entire CDSs (Table 1). As expected,22 mapping-based methods, including our pipeline, generally showed higher SP and SN at the intron and all-introns levels than the ab initio methods; however, both the SP and the SN drastically dropped at the CDS level when using GeneSeqer. This is partly because the 5'- and 3'-ends of CDSs are poorly conserved and cannot be aligned in many cases. In fact, a significant number of O. sativa start or stop codons were not found in all the three mapping-based methods without extension of 5'- and 3'-ends (Table 2). In contrast, the extension of the start and the stop codons in our CDS identification led to the inclusion of more than 88 and 91% of these codons, respectively (Table 2), which were better than the other two methods. After the CDS extension process, the SP and SN of our pipeline increased by 12.2 and 9.8%, respectively, at the CDS level, which suggests that this extension step seems to be of great benefit for accurate CDS prediction. Comparison of SP and SN in CDSsAll values are expressed as percentages (%).aSim4cc does not report a representative transcript in a single locus, so each mapping result was evaluated separately.bCDS regions of the reference set were evaluated.cSim4cc does not predict CDS regions.Comparison of SP and SN in CDSsAll values are expressed as percentages (%).aSim4cc does not report a representative transcript in a single locus, so each mapping result was evaluated separately.bCDS regions of the reference set were evaluated.cSim4cc does not predict CDS regions.Percentage of O. sativa start and stop codons included in the alignmentsaLongest CDSs were selected.Percentage of O. sativa start and stop codons included in the alignmentsaLongest CDSs were selected.Low sequence similarity in untranslated regions (UTRs) caused more serious problems. The SP of introns in UTRs was <33%, which was much lower than the above 90% SP of non-UTR-based CDSs (Supplementary Table S4). This result indicates that interspecies mapping should focus on CDSs rather than the entire transcripts.Improvement of gene structure identification in three steps (detection of tandem duplications, removal of short introns, and exon–intron boundary corrections) of our pipeline was validated (Supplementary Table S5). The pipeline detected candidate regions of tandem duplication in 11 287 alignments (see Supplementary Methods), and they were consequently reflected in 3510 loci. In addition, 10 097 short introns (<50 bp) to be removed were found in 4480 loci. As a result, 7.5% SP and 2.5% SN at the all-introns level were increased in the three steps (Supplementary Table S5). In this way, without sacrificing SN, SP was largely improved.3.2 Applicability of interspecies mappingAlthough interspecies mapping is useful for detecting loci in related species, FLcDNAs from distantly related species may lead to incorrect predictions. To test the applicability of the interspecies mapping approach, we examined the relationship between species classification and mapping ratios. For this purpose, we used the O. sativa, Z. mays, and A. thaliana genomes because they had large numbers of FLcDNAs that could be used to create high-quality reference sets. We applied monocot FLcDNAs to the O. sativa and Z. mays genomes and dicot FLcDNAs to the A. thaliana genome. We also applied our algorithm to a monocot–dicot comparison. Figure 3 shows the relationship between the mapping ratio and the species classification. In general, mapping within both monocots and dicots yielded a higher mapping ratio than mapping between a monocot and a dicot. Therefore, comparisons between distantly related species, such as a monocot and a dicot, do not seem to be appropriate. Within-monocot comparisons displayed a higher ratio than within-dicot comparisons. In addition, monocot-to-Arabidopsis mapping showed a lower mapping ratio compared with dicot-to-rice/maize mapping, although evolutionary distances of these two comparisons were same. This difference of mapping ratios is possible because A. thaliana might have undergone genome reduction that led to a lineage-specific deletion of genes. Relationship between species classification and mapping ratio. The horizontal axis indicates the classification, and the vertical axis indicates the mapping ratio. We mapped FLcDNAs from three monocots and four dicots to the O. sativa (rice) and Z. mays (maize) genomes, and FLcDNAs from three dicots and six monocots to the A. thaliana (Arabidopsis) genome. Bars at the top of the boxes represent the standard deviations.Relationship between species classification and mapping ratio.

Bars at the top of the boxes represent the standard deviations.To further ascertain the degree to which nucleotide differences affect the accuracy of the exon–intron structure predictions generated by interspecies mapping, we examined the relationship between the nucleotide sequence identity and the SP of all introns in our representative CDSs (Fig. 4). The correlation coefficient for this relationship is 0.88 (P = 8.6 × 10-9). This suggests that interspecies mapping within closely related species should detect a significant number of true exon–intron structures. If the nucleotide identity is more than 80%, the SP of all introns in a given set of CDSs is expected to be ~60% or more. Correlation between nucleotide identity and SP. The horizontal axis indicates the nucleotide identity, and the vertical axis indicates the SP of all introns in CDSs. Open circles and triangles indicate within-monocot and -dicot mapping, respectively, and filled circles and triangles indicate between-dicot and -monocot mapping, respectively.

Open circles and triangles indicate within-monocot and -dicot mapping, respectively, and filled circles and triangles indicate between-dicot and -monocot mapping, respectively. The straight line shows the linear regression for all data (r = 0.88).Figure 4 also shows that, for the monocot genomes examined, monocot FLcDNAs provided accurate results, whereas the dicot exon–intron structures that were inferred were relatively inaccurate because the dicot genomes used were derived from diverse species. Because all monocots employed in the present study belong to Poaceae (the grass family), their divergence time is relatively short (50–70 million years or less).50 In contrast, the available dicot FLcDNAs belong to multiple families that are more divergent: A. thaliana is in Brassicaceae, S. lycopersicum in Solanaceae, G. max in Fabaceae, and P. trichocarpa in Salicaceae. For example, A. thaliana and P. trichocarpa probably split around 100–120 million years ago.6 In fact, nucleotide identities among the dicots A. thaliana, P. trichocarpa, S. lycopersicum, and G. max ranged from 75% to 78%, which is lower than the ~80% identity detected among monocots. To accurately determine the exon–intron structures within genomes, FLcDNAs from the same family would be preferable.3.3 How many FLcDNAs are necessary for genome annotation?A genome is composed of regions that are conserved among species and regions that are specific to a lineage, but interspecies mapping can identify only conserved genes. Here, on the basis of the interspecies mapping results, we estimated the numbers of conserved genes in monocots. If random sampling of FLcDNAs is assumed, the number of loci inferred from the number of mapped FLcDNAs obeys a Poisson distribution (see the ‘Materials and methods’ section). We estimated the number of loci shared between O. sativa and the other monocots to be ~18 000 because 17 402 loci were identified among 54 004 transcripts. Zea mays and S. bicolor seem to contain ~21 000 and ~24 000 conserved loci, respectively. Note that, for this estimation, a single genomic region was selected if an FLcDNA was homologous to multiple regions. We also should note that, because the sampling of FLcDNAs was not completely random, the estimated numbers should be the lower limits. In addition, to more accurately estimate the total number of loci, we must consider lineage-specific genes that are undetectable by sequence similarity.Next, we estimated the number of FLcDNAs needed to annotate homologous CDSs among monocot species. Assuming that ~83 000 FLcDNAs would need to be used to cover 99% of the ~18 000 loci in O. sativa, with a mapping ratio of 0.75, a total of ~110 000 FLcDNAs obtained from closely related species would be necessary for prediction of CDSs in O. sativa. This number may be an underestimate if FLcDNAs are not randomly cloned, but most of the genes should be included if more than 100 000 clones are collected from closely related species. Therefore, because there are more than 120 000 FLcDNAs in monocots, new genomes of monocots, such as wheat and barley, would be effectively annotated by using interspecies mapping.3.4 CDS prediction in 10 speciesWe applied the interspecies mapping procedure to predict exon–intron structures and CDSs in 10 plant genomes: O. sativa, Z. mays, A. thaliana, S. bicolor, B. distachyon, P. trichocarpa, G. max, V. vinifera, L. japonicus, and C. papaya. Table 3 shows the number of the FLcDNAs used, the mapped FLcDNAs, and the CDS loci. Three examples of our interspecies mapping results for O. sativa were compared with the exon–intron structures of annotation release 2 of the rice genome (RAP2), which was based on an intraspecies mapping procedure37 (Fig. 5). First, three FLcDNAs derived from Z. mays were mapped to the Os11g0635500 locus of RAP2, and their 5'- and 3'-ends were extended. These predicted CDSs displayed exon–intron structures that were identical to those determined by an O. sativa FLcDNA with a CDS and UTRs (Fig. 5A). Second, the representative structure at the Os01g0120300 locus determined by an FLcDNA (Fig. 5B) was apparently truncated at the 5'-end. In contrast, the interspecies mapping results predicted the complete exon–intron structures including the start and the stop codons. Finally, a H. vulgare FLcDNA (AK248420) predicted a novel transcribed locus candidate between Os08g0206900 and Os08g0207000 that had not yet been detected (Fig. 5C). In total, we identified 492 new loci that were missing in release 2 of the rice annotation. The numbers of new loci found in the 10 plant species examined are shown in Table 3. In addition, we provide exon–intron structure and CDS data that were created by a combination of interspecies and intraspecies mapping methods (Supplementary Table S6). This comprehensive data set, which contains 210 551 genes from 10 species, will be useful for a large-scale sequence analysis of these flowering plants.

We could provide relatively a high-quality CDS annotation using intraspecies and interspecies mapping. However, for dicot genomes, the 58 534 dicot FLcDNAs currently available do not seem to be sufficient to predict most of the gene structures. We expect that 50 000 more FLcDNAs from any dicots might improve the coverage of gene prediction in dicot genomes. To complement the shortage of FLcDNAs and explore lineage-specific genes, ab initio prediction programs can be used in combination with interspecies and intraspecies mapping. Interspecies FLcDNA mapping, partly supported by ab initio predictions, will be of great use for cost-effective annotation of newly released agronomically important plant genomes, such as those of wheat and barley.4.

IntroductionOrientia tsutsugamushi (OT), an obligate intracellular bacterium belonging to the family Rickettsiaceae of the subdivision alpha-Proteobacteria, is the causative agent of scrub typhus, or Tsutsugamushi disease. The vector and the reservoir of OT are trombiculid mites. The bacteria reside in the cytosol of mite cells in various organs and are efficiently inherited by their offspring through transovarial transmission.1–5 Reverse transfer from infected animals to mites occurs infrequently, and the bacteria transmitted in this way are not usually passed on to offspring. Thus, limited lines of mites retain the bacterium,6–8 and a correlation is observed between the species of host mite and the serotype of the colonizing OT strain.9Strain typing of OT was first made on the basis of antigenic variation (serotyping), but a universal scheme for serotyping has not yet been established. Later, on the basis of nucleotide (nt) sequence variation in the gene encoding a major outer membrane protein called the 56-kDa Orientia type-specific antigen (TSA), Tamura and his collaborators divided OT strains into the following subtypes: Gilliam, JG (Japanese Gilliam), Karp, JP-1 (Japanese Karp type-1), JP-2 (Japanese Karp type-2), Kato, Kawasaki, Kuroki, Shimokoshi and others.10,11 This typing system is widely used for epidemiological studies in Japan. Importantly, Ohashi et al.11 determined the 50% mouse lethal doses (MLD50) for representative strains of each subtype and found that strains from subtypes Kato, JG, Gilliam and Karp exhibit high-level virulence to mice, that from JP-2 intermediate-level virulence and those from JP-1, Kawasaki, Kuroki and Shimokoshi low-level virulence. The factors responsible for the strain-to-strain (or serotype-to-serotype) difference of mouse MLD50 have not yet been identified.The complete genome sequences of two OT strains have recently been determined. Cho et al. sequenced strain Boryong, which was isolated from a patient in Korea,12 and our group sequenced strain Ikeda, which was isolated in 1979 from a patient in Niigata prefecture, Japan.13 Ikeda is a representative strain of subtype JG and thus highly virulent in mice.11 Genomic analysis of the two OT strains revealed that extensive reductive genome evolution as well as explosive and comprehensive amplification of repetitive sequences have occurred in OT. In both strains, repetitive sequences occupy nearly half the genome. Through intensive analysis of the repetitive sequences identified in Ikeda, we categorized them into three types13: (i) an integrative and conjugative element (ICE) named ‘OT amplified genetic element’ (OtAGE); (ii) transposable elements (TEs) and (iii) short repetitive sequences of unknown origins (short repeats). TEs included five types of insertion sequence (IS), four types of miniature inverted-repeat TEs (MITEs) and a Group II (GII) intron.13 The results of our preliminary analysis suggested that extensive genome rearrangements mediated by the repetitive sequences have taken place between the two strains. However, because of the highly complex and repeat-rich feature of the OT genomes, details of the genomic differences between the two strains remain to be clarified.In the present study, we performed fine comparison of the Ikeda and Boryong genomes to identify the common and variable genomic features among OT strains. In addition, using 11 genes that are conserved in OT and closely related Rickettsia species, we executed multilocus sequencing (MLS) analysis of 10 OT strains representing each TSA subtype to reveal the precise phylogenetic relationship of the strains and examined the distribution of strain-specific sequences identified in Ikeda or Boryong among the OT strains.2. Materials and methods2.1. Bacterial strains and DNA preparationStrains used in this study are listed in Table 1. Nine strains other than Boryong represent each of the nine TSA subtypes, and their virulence in mice was analyzed in a previous study.11 Bacterial cells were inoculated onto confluent monolayers of L929 cells grown in maintenance medium (MEM medium supplemented with 1% FBS, 0.075% NaHCO3, 0.03% glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin and 0.25 µg/ml amphotericin B) and incubated at 37°C for 7 days in 5% CO2. Strain Matsuzawa was the exception in that it was incubated for 14 days because of its slow growth rate. After 7 or 14 days of cultivation, infected L929 cells were scraped from culture dishes, and the supernatant and L929 cells were separated by centrifugation at 200 g for 5 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in the maintenance medium and homogenized gently with a glass Dounce homogenizer (GPE Scientific Ltd). The cell homogenate was re-mixed with the supernatant and centrifuged at 200 g for 10 min to remove the host cell debris. Bacterial cells were collected by centrifugation at 20 000 g for 10 min and suspended in PBS for genomic DNA extraction with the DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen). To reconfirm the subtype of each strain, the TSA gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequenced using primers listed in Supplementary Table S1. JP-1 and JP-2 strains were distinguished by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of the PCR-amplified product of the TSA gene,11 and the TSA gene of strain 423H (subtype JP-2) had not been determined previously. Therefore, based on the RFLP pattern deduced from the 423H sequence, we confirmed that our strain belongs to the JP-2 subtype. The TSA gene sequence of strain Matsuzawa showed a significant number of one-base mismatches to that in the database (AF173043.1). Therefore, we resequenced the entire TSA gene of strain Matsuzawa and deposited it in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank databases (accession no. AB534164). We used this new sequence for our analysis. OT strains used in this studyaSubtypes of each strain are derived from Ohashi et al.11OT strains used in this studyaSubtypes of each strain are derived from Ohashi et al.112.2. Genome comparison of strains Ikeda and BoryongAn all-to-all BLASTN search14 of the protein-coding sequences (CDSs) identified in the two strains was performed to examine the conservation of protein-coding genes in each strain. CDSs annotated as pseudogenes in each genome were excluded from this analysis. CDSs that were not detected, or those with different sizes, were further examined by CLUSTALW.15To identify repetitive sequences in the two strains with the same criteria, we constructed consensus sequences for each type of repetitive sequence that we previously identified in Ikeda, searched the two genomes for sequences homologous to each consensus using BLASTN and manually inspected each sequence. Thus, the positions of some repetitive sequences in Ikeda differ slightly from those described in the previous report.13 The repetitive sequence-free genome sequences (RSFGSs) of each strain were obtained by removing the repetitive sequences from the entire genome sequence. Regions where the linearity of the genome sequence is conserved between the two strains were identified by Harplott analysis of the RSFGSs using the GenomeMatcher ver. 1.11 software.16 These regions (>1 kb) were defined as linearity-conserved regions (LCRs) and were used to analyze genome rearrangement. Strain-specific sequences were identified by reciprocal BLASTN analysis of the RSFGSs. Sequences specific to each strain (>1 kb) were defined as Ikeda- or Boryong-specific sequences (Ike_spe1 to Ike_spe19 and Bor_spe1 to Bor_spe19, respectively). To search additional Boryong-specific repetitive sequences, a self-to-self BLASTN search was performed for all Boryong-specific sequences (>100 bp).2.3. PCR scanningDistribution of the Ikeda- and Boryong-specific sequences among OT strains was examined by PCR scanning analysis17 using the LA Long PCR kit (Takara) and 20 ng genomic DNA as template. Each strain-specific sequence (>1 kb) was examined by two pairs of scanning primers (F1/R1 and F2/R2) except for Ike_spe6, which was examined using six primer pairs. When only one PCR product was obtained, the second PCR using different primer combinations (F1/R2 and F2/R1) was performed. The sequences of scanning primers are listed in Supplementary Table S1.2.4. MLS analysisInternal segments of the following 11 housekeeping genes were amplified from each of the eight strains (Gilliam, Karp, Matsuzawa, 423H, Kato, Kawasaki, Kuroki and Shimokoshi) by PCR using the LA Long PCR kit and sequenced using the ABI3730 sequencer (Applied Biosystems): atpD (coding for ATP synthase beta-chain), clpX (ATP-dependent Clp protease ATP-binding subunit), dnaJ (DnaJ protein), dnaK (DnaK protein), fabD (malonyl CoA-acyl carrier protein transacylase), gyrB (DNA gyrase subunit B), icd (isocitrate dehydrogenase), mdh (malate dehydrogenase), nrdA (ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase alpha-chain), sucD (succinyl-CoA synthetase alpha-chain) and ubiD (3-octaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoate carboxy-lyase). Amplification and sequencing primers are listed in Supplementary Table S1. The nt sequences obtained from each strain were concatenated (5247 bp) and used for MLS analysis. Phylogenetic trees were constructed by the neighborhood-joining method under the Tamura–Nei model using MEGA4 in the Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis software.18 All sequences used for MLS analysis have been deposited in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank database with the accession numbers AB537240–AB537327.3. Results and discussion3.1. Comparison of general genomic features between strains Ikeda and BoryongBoth strains have a single circular chromosome and possess no plasmid. The chromosomes are very similar in size (2 008 987 bp in Ikeda and 2 127 051 bp in Boryong) with almost identical average G + C contents (30.5% in both strains). The numbers of rRNA and tRNA genes are identical. The numbers of protein-coding genes and pseudogenes, the coding content (%) and the repeat content (%) were unable to be directly compared as the annotation criteria were different between the two genomes.In conventional GC skew analysis, no clear skew in leading and lagging strands was observed in either genome. Therefore, we reassigned the origin of replication (oriC) using Ori-Finder.19 The oriC region was found to lie between the rho and hemE genes, which are located from nt 539552 to nt 541039 in Ikeda and nt 996058 to nt 997543 in Boryong.3.2. Comparison of repetitive sequences between strains Ikeda and BoryongBecause the large number of repetitive sequences in both strains makes comparison of their genome sequences difficult, we first identified all repetitive sequences for the two strains under the same criteria, established on the basis of the results of our previous analysis.13 We found that Boryong contains all types of repetitive sequence identified in Ikeda (Table 2). No additional repetitive sequence was found in Boryong. Total lengths of repetitive sequences are 851.6 kb (42.4% of the total genome) in Ikeda and 911.9 kb (42.9%) in Boryong. In both strains, the repetitive sequences are scattered throughout the genome (Fig. 1A). OtAGEs and TEs, the main components of the repetitive sequences, often form small clusters in which one element is inserted into another. Because of such complexity, we did not determine the exact copy number for each type of repetitive sequence in Boryong.

The total length of OtAGE is 578.4 kb in Ikeda (28.8% of the total genome) and 597.4 kb in Boryong (28.1%). In Ikeda, various degrees of decay were observed in all OtAGEs, and a large number of fragmented OtAGEs have been scattered throughout the genome. We could, however, reconstitute a possible genetic organization of original OtAGE by comparing fragmented elements.13 Although extensive decay has also occurred in the OtAGEs of Boryong, we found one copy of OtAGE very similar to the reconstituted OtAGE of strain Ikeda (Fig. 2).13 However, duplication of the attachment sequence, which must have been generated upon integration, was not detected on the element, suggesting that some deletion has occurred at either or both ends of the element. Several IS insertions and genomic deletions were also observed in the element. Thus, this element of Boryong appears to be no more functional as an ICE. Genetic organizations of the reconstituted OtAGE of strain Ikeda and the largest OtAGE found in strain Boryong. Both strains contain a large number of OtAGEs, but extensive decay has occurred in all OtAGE copies. A possible original structure of Ikeda OtAGE was reconstituted by comparing larger fragments in our previous report.13 The Ikeda OtAGE shown in this figure was constructed by combining OtAGE_178 and OtAGE_40. Genes for conjugal transfer are depicted by green boxes, those for integrase by red, those for transposase by yellow, those for ATPase domain-containing proteins by blue, conserved hypothetical genes by white and OT-specific hypothetical genes by gray. All genes in the OtAGEs are drawn to the scale. Numbers above the reconstituted Ikeda OtAGE indicate family numbers of OtRG families. Numbers below the Boryong OtAGE indicate CDS numbers in Boryong. Homologous regions indicated by light green shading were identified by the BLASTN program (E-value threshold: =1E-10). Note that the Boryong OtAGE contains several deletions and IS insertions, suggesting that this largest OtAGE copy is also defective.Genetic organizations of the reconstituted OtAGE of strain Ikeda and the largest OtAGE found in strain Boryong.

Note that the Boryong OtAGE contains several deletions and IS insertions, suggesting that this largest OtAGE copy is also defective.Although Ikeda and Boryong share the same sets of TEs and the total lengths of the TEs are nearly equivalent (257.0 kb and 12.8% of the total genome in Ikeda and 295.2 kb and 13.9% in Boryong), amounts of each type of TE differ significantly between the strains (Table 2). This result suggests that intensive amplification and decay of these elements have occurred in each strain after their divergence.All types of short repeats identified in Ikeda are also present in Boryong. However, in contrast to the TEs, total lengths of the short repeats and amounts of each type of short repeat are very similar in the two strains (Table 2).3.3 Extensive repetitive sequence-mediated genome shufflingBy removing all repetitive sequences from each genome, we constructed RSFGSs of the two strains. The lengths of the RSFGSs of Ikeda and Boryong are 1156.8 and 1214.8 kb, respectively. The result of Harplott analysis of the RSFGSs clearly indicated that an extremely high degree of genome shuffling has occurred between the OT strains (Fig. 1). This genome shuffling was obviously induced by extensively amplified repetitive sequences. By comparing the RSFGSs of the two strains, we identified 66 LCRs of >1 kb in size, where the linearity of the genome sequence is conserved between the two strains (positions of all LCRs in each genome are listed in Supplementary Table S2). The average length of these LCRs is 16.0 kb, with the longest being ~46 kb.3.4 Strain-specific sequencesIn the RSFGSs, we identified 19 Ikeda-specific (Ike_spe1 to Ike_spe19) and 19 Boryong-specific (Bor_spe1 to Bor_spe19) sequences of >1 kb in length (Supplementary Table S3 and Fig. 3). These sequences were not found in other bacteria of the family Rickettsiaceae. Several sequences have been duplicated in each genome. Their duplications appear to have been induced by repetitive sequences that flank these sequences (Supplementary Fig. S1). Total lengths of the Ikeda- and Boryong-specific sequences are 52.4 (average 2.8) and 40.8 (average 2.1) kb, respectively. Among these sequences, Ike_spe6 is particularly interesting. At 19.2 kb, this is the longest of the strain-specific sequences, and it shows a higher G + C content compared with other parts of the Ikeda genome and is flanked by ISOts4 and mISOts4, forming a composite transposon-like structure with 95-bp-long terminal inverted repeats (Fig. 4). A direct repeat of 5 bp, which was most likely created upon insertion (target sequence duplication), was also identified. Many of the 26 genes encoded in Ike_spe6 have the closest homologs in Legionella spp. and Parachlamydia spp. A few genes have homologs in Rickettsia species, but their sequence similarity to the Ike_spe6 genes was significantly lower than to homologs in Legionella and Parachlamydia, suggesting that Ikeda may have acquired this sequence by horizontal gene transfer from related bacterial species. Intriguingly, both Legionella and Parachlamydia are intracellular microorganisms, and their main niches in natural environments are thought to be amoebas. There are some articles suggesting the relationship between the order Rickettsiales and amoebae.20–22 The presence of Ike_spe6 may provide the new evidence showing that an amoeba may be involved in the life cycle of OT as well. Distribution of Ikeda- and Boryong-specific sequences among other OT strains. The presence of each strain-specific region (>1 kb) was examined by PCR scanning using two pairs of PCR primers, except for Ike_spe6, which was examined using six pairs of primers. Regions present in each strain are indicated by black cells with white plus signs. Regions where only one primer pair yielded a PCR product are indicated by gray cells with black plus signs. Regions yielding PCR products with different sizes compared with those of the reference strain (Ikeda or Boryong) are also indicated by gray cells. In Ike_spe6 of strain Kato, five primer pairs yielded PCR products. Phylogenetic relationships of the OT strains examined are also indicated (Fig. 5).Distribution of Ikeda- and Boryong-specific sequences among other OT strains.

According to this definition, we found 1196 repeated genes that were classified into 85 OT repeated gene (OtRG) families. OtRG1–OtRG9 are genes in TEs, and OtRG10–OtRG54 are those in OtAGEs. Thus, these families are also conserved in Boryong. Other repeated genes (OtRG55–OtRG85) are not components of repetitive elements, but their frequent association with repetitive sequences suggested that they have been duplicated or multiplexed in conjunction with amplification of repetitive sequences.13 In support of this hypothesis, copy numbers for many of these OtRGs differ significantly between the two strains (Supplementary Table S4). At least six genes have duplicated in Ikeda but not in Boryong. In addition, several repeated gene families are present in only one strain (three families specific to Ikeda and two families specific to Boryong). Extensive gene decay has also taken place in many Boryong-repeated genes as in those of Ikeda.We previously found that, among the 1967 CDSs of Ikeda, 771 are singleton genes and 543 of the 771 genes are shared with R. prowazekii. Because most OT/R. prowazekii shared genes (520 genes) are conserved in all five sequenced Rickettsia species, they appear to represent the core gene set of the family Rickettsiaceae. As expected, 541 of the 543 shared genes are conserved in Boryong (Table 3). No other Boryong singleton gene was conserved in R. prowazekii. Genomic locations of these 541 genes have been extensively shuffled between the two OT genomes, but the average nt sequence identity of these genes is 97.5%. Conservation of Ikeda singleton genes in strain BoryongaNumber of shared genes has been changed from 542 to 543, because OTT_0717 was added to this gene set after re-inspection.bNumbers of pseudogenes are indicated in parentheses.cThe five Rickettsia species examined here include R. prowazekii, R. conorii, R. felis, R. typhi and R. bellii.Conservation of Ikeda singleton genes in strain BoryongaNumber of shared genes has been changed from 542 to 543, because OTT_0717 was added to this gene set after re-inspection.bNumbers of pseudogenes are indicated in parentheses.cThe five Rickettsia species examined here include R. prowazekii, R. conorii, R. felis, R. typhi and R. bellii.Two of the 543 OT/R. prowazekii shared genes are not conserved in Boryong: the atpF gene encoding the beta-subunit of ATP synthase F0 sector (OTT_0385 in Ikeda) and a gene encoding a hypothetical protein containing ankyrin repeats (OTT_1381). The atpF gene of Boryong contains a frameshift mutation, and thus the N-terminal 47 amino acids are missing. This mutation may be due to a sequence error. OTT_1481 is located in an Ikeda strain-specific sequence (Ike_spe13) that is flanked by OtAGEs (Supplementary Fig. S2). Boryong may have lost this gene by the OtAGE-mediated deletion of Ike_spe13. Conversely, one of the 543 OT/R. prowazekii shared genes (the tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase gene) has been duplicated in Boryong (OTBS_0762 and OTBS_1824). ISOts1 and GIIOt1 flanking these genes suggest that this gene duplication has also been induced by TEs.In addition to the 543 shared genes, Ikeda possesses 195 singleton genes. Among these, 124 are present in Boryong but 71 are absent (Supplementary Table S5). Of the former 124 genes, OTT_0440 (encoding a repeat-containing protein) and OTT_0622 (encoding a hypothetical protein) are duplicated in Boryong. OtAGEs and/or TEs are also located at both the ends of these CDSs (Supplementary Fig. S2), suggesting that their duplications have also been induced by repetitive sequences. Although many Ikeda-specific singleton genes (58 out of 71) are of unknown function, these genes may have introduced phenotypic differences between the two strains.Boryong also possesses 74 singleton genes that are not present in Ikeda. Sequences corresponding to 49 of these genes are also present in Ikeda, but they were not annotated as CDSs under our annotation criteria. The remaining 25 Boryong-specific genes are of unknown function.Another interesting finding is that, among 27 disrupted Ikeda singleton genes, 23 have also been disrupted and 4 were not identified in the Boryong genome (Supplementary Table S6). This finding may suggest that inactivation of these genes took place before the divergence of the two strains.3.6 Lineage analysis of OT strains by MLS analysisPartial nt sequences of the TSA gene were used for lineage analysis of OT strains.10 The TSA gene encodes a major surface protein. It exhibits remarkable strain-to-strain sequence variation and contains four variable domains. Phylogenetic trees constructed using each domain sequence are not consistent between the domains.23 Thus, the sequence of this gene is not suitable for phylogenetic analysis of OT strains. Therefore, we selected 11 genes among the core gene set of the family Rickettsiaceae and performed MLS analysis of various OT strains using concatenated sequences of these 11 genes. Strains examined in this analysis included nine OT strains (Ikeda, Gilliam, Kato, Karp, Matsuzawa, 423H, Kuroki, Kawasaki and Shimokoshi) representing each of the known nine TSA subtypes. Strain Boryong was also included in this analysis. The phylogenetic tree obtained by this MLS analysis differed considerably from that generated using TSA gene sequences and probably represents the true phylogenetic relationship among OT strains (Fig. 5). Strain Boryong, which can be classified as the Kuroki subtype with TSA-based subtyping, has the same MLS type as strain Kuroki. Phylogenetic relationships of OT strains representing each known TSA subtype. (a) Phylogenetic tree constructed using the concatenated nt sequences of 11 housekeeping genes. The 11 genes used were selected from the core genes of five Rickettsia species: R. prowazekii, R. conorii, R. felis, R. typhi and R. bellii. The reliability of the internal branches was assessed by bootstrapping with 250 pseudoreplicates. Strains with higher virulence to mice clustered together in this phylogram. Virulence of each strain to mice was categorized according to their 50% mice lethal doses (MLD50), which were reported by Ohashi et al.11: +++, MLD50 (log10) > 2.0; ++, 2.0 > MLD50 > 1.0; +, 1.0 > MLD50 > 0; -, all alive. The strain Matsuzawa does not show higher virulence to mice (indicated by asterisks), but this may be due to the slow growth of this strain. The virulence of strain Boryong to mice has not been determined. (b) Phylogenetic tree constructed using the sequences of TSA genes, which encode an OT-specific surface protein of 56 kDa. The scale bar represents the number of substitutions per site.Phylogenetic relationships of OT strains representing each known TSA subtype.

The scale bar represents the number of substitutions per site.All OT strains used in this MLS analysis (except for Boryong) were previously examined for virulence in mice by Ohashi et al.11 In the new phylogram, strains that showed higher virulence to mice (strains Ikeda, Kato, Karp, 423H and Gilliam) clustered together. The sole exception is strain Matsuzawa belonging to the JP-1 type, which may be due to its slow growth in mammalian cells. This result suggests the presence of an OT lineage with higher virulence to mice.Although the natural hosts of each OT strains are not fully understood, hosts for the OT strains of higher virulence are mainly Leptotrombidium akamushi and L. pallidum, whereas the hosts for the other strains are L. scutellare and some other Leptotrombidium spp.11,24–27 This host specificity may be linked to the generation of such sublineages of OT. In Japan, many severe scrub typhus cases previously occurred only in the several local areas where L. akamushi is predominantly distributed, and the causative agents of these diseases (so-called classic-type Tsutsugamushi diseases) were the strains of serotype Kato. Recently, many scrub typhus cases (several hundred cases per year) are occurring in other areas of Japan, where L. scutellare and L. pallidum are densely distributed. Most of these new-type Tsutsugamushi diseases are caused by strains of serotypes Kawasaki (the natural host is L. scutellare) and Kuroki (unknown), and clinical symptoms of these diseases are generally milder than that of the classic type.27 Our findings may at least partly explain these clinical and epidemiological differences between the classic- and new-type Tsutsugamushi diseases.Because strain Boryong has the same MLS type as that of strain Kuroki which belongs to the lower virulence group,11 it is possible that some of the Ikeda-specific sequences (or genes on the sequences) could be responsible for the virulence difference between the two groups. Therefore, we examined the distribution of 19 Ikeda- and 19 Boryong-specific sequences among the 10 OT strains by PCR scanning (Fig. 3). The result of this analysis indicates that the distribution patterns of these sequences largely followed the phylogeny of each strain (Fig. 3). For example, an intact copy of the above-mentioned Ike_spe6 was found only in strain Kato, which is most closely related to Ikeda. The insertion site of Ike_spe6 in strain Kato is the same as that in Ikeda (data not shown). However, none of the Ikeda-specific sequences showed a higher virulence group-specific distribution (shared by all strains of the higher virulence group but absent in the lower virulence group). Thus, the factors responsible for the virulence difference between the two groups still remain to be elucidated.3.7 ConclusionFine genome sequence comparison of two recently sequenced OT strains revealed that they contain the same set of repetitive sequences and that these repetitive sequences have been amplified explosively in both strains and have induced extensive genome shuffling. In addition, the core gene set of family Rickettsiaceae is highly conserved between the two strains. On the basis of the results of MLS analysis, we present a phylogram that represents a true phylogenetic relationship among OT strains. This analysis further revealed the presence of an OT sublineage with higher potential virulence, which might explain the clinical and epidemiological differences between the classic and new types of Tsutsugamushi disease in Japan.Supplementary DataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by grants from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan and the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare of Japan, and partly by a grant from Miyazaki Prefecture.We thank Yoshiro Terawaki and Akira Tamura for their encouragement and Akemi Yoshida, Yumiko Takeshita, Noriko Kanemaru, Miki Shinbara, and Nobuko Fujii for their technical assistance.Supplementary data"

IntroductionHuman artificial chromosomes (HACs) are an important alternative to conventional gene-transfer techniques, such as viral, plasmid, P1 phage-derived artificial chromosomes, bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) and yeast artificial chromosomes, because they offer greater control over their location and function in recipient human cells. Advantages of HAC vectors include their stability as episomes in human cells, a low level of associated insertional mutagenesis, a low potential for causing cell transformation compared with the conventional vectors1,2 and capacity to carry and facilitate expression of the largest mammalian genes from their native gene regulatory elements.Two strategies have been used to construct HAC vectors3,4: natural human chromosomes have been modified and reduced in size to generate minichromosomes that maintain the essential functional properties of a eukaryotic chromosome and cloning vector (top-down), or de novo artificial chromosomes have been constructed from synthetic or cloned DNA that provide such essential functions (i.e. alphoid DNA for kinetochore function) in human and other mammalian cells (bottom-up). Top-down HACs have been generated from human chromosomes by telomere-seeding and homologous recombination in chicken DT40 cells.5,6 For example, our group recently constructed a human chromosome 14- and 21-derived HAC vector that replicates and segregates properly during mitotic divisions in vitro and is stably maintained in mice.4–8 The chromosome 21-derived HAC is a powerful gene delivery vector capable of carrying large genes such as the dystrophin gene (2.4 Mb) and may be useful for gene and cell therapy.4,9–11Bottom-up HACs have been constructed from arrays of synthetic or natural alphoid DNA and BAC vector sequences required for HAC assembly and propagation.12–14 Recently, our group constructed a bottom-up HAC in which ~6000 copies of a 42-bp tetracycline operator (tet-O) sequence are inserted into a mega-base size synthetic alphoid DNA array. Because tet-O is bound with very high affinity and specificity by the tet repressor (tet-R), the tet-O sequences in the HAC can be targeted with tet-R fusion proteins that inactivate the centromere and induce HAC loss. Thus, the alphoidtet-O HAC hereafter, tet-O HAC has a conditional centromere, that can be turned on or off by co-expression of tet-O binding proteins. This feature of the tet-O HAC was used to target chromatin-modifying proteins into the HAC centromere and alter the balance between open and condensed chromatin, which is critical for the kinetochore function.15,16 In this study, we describe adaptation of the tet-O HAC for gene expression studies.2. Materials and methods2.1. Cell cultureHT1080 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Sigma, St Louis, MD, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Biowest, Nuaille, France) with 4 µg/ml of Blasticidin S (BS; Funakoshi, Tokyo, Japan) at 37°C in 5% CO2. The HT1080 and A9 hybrid cells were maintained in DMEM (Sigma) containing 10% FBS (Biowest) and the appropriate antibiotics. The hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT)-deficient Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (JCRB0218) were maintained in Ham's F-12 nutrient mixture (Invitrogen, USA) plus 10% FBS with 8 µg/ml of BS (Funakoshi). After introduction of the EGFP gene, the CHO cells retaining the tet-O-EGFP HAC were cultured with 1× HAT medium. Chicken DT40 cells were maintained at 37°C in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% chicken serum and 50 µM 2-mercaptoethanol.2.2. Construction of the targeting vectorsThe targeting vector 5–4–3 for introducing a 3'-HPRT-loxP-Hyg-thymidine kinase (Tk) cassette was constructed as follows. The 2.0- and 3.1-kb fragment homologous for BAC vector sequences in the tet-O HAC were amplified by PCR using primers HR1-Fi/Ri 5'-AGAGTTAACGTTACCTTCCACGAGCAAAACACGTA-3' and 5'- AGAGTTAACCTTGTAGGCCTTTATCCATGCTGGTT-3'; HR3S-F/R 5'-ATACCGCGGGTTCTGTGTTCATTAGGTTGTTCTGT-3' and 5'-ATACCGCGGTGAAGCGTATATAGGACGAGTAACTG-3', digested with either HpaI or SacII and subcloned into the equivalent sites of pKO Scrambler V901 backbone vector (Lexicon Genetics, Woodlands, TX, USA), respectively, which contains the following three selection/insertion cassettes between the EcoRI and the BglII sites: a 2-kb fragment from pMC1-Tk (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) containing the HSV-Tk gene, a 2.3-kb XbaI/AscI fragment from pKO SelectHPRT V820 (Lexicon Genetics) containing a part of the human HPRT gene with the loxP site inserted into the XbaI site of intron B and a 1.3-kb XhoI fragment from the PGK/Hyg vector containing the hygromycin-resistance gene. The transgene sequences are described previously.72.3. Fluorescence in situ hybridizationFluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses of CHO and DT40 cells were performed with either fixed metaphase or interphase nuclei using digoxigenin-labelled (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) human hCot1 DNA (Invitrogen) and biotin-labelled plasmid DNA, as described previously.7 For FISH analysis of HAC in HT1080 cells, tet-O alpha-satellite DNA was used as a probe.15 Chromosomal DNA was counterstained with DAPI (Sigma). The images were captured using the Argus system (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan) and NIS elements (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).2.4. Microcell-mediated chromosome transferMicrocell-mediated chromosome transfer (MMCT) was performed as described previously.7,10 The tet-O HAC containing the loxP cassette was transferred from DT40 into CHO cells by MMCT technology. Briefly, microcells were prepared by centrifugation of 1 × 109 DT40 cells attached on flasks (Nalge Nunc, Rochester, NY, USA) coated with poly-l-lysine (Sigma) and were fused to 1 × 106 CHO cells by 47% polyethylene glycol 1000 (WAKO, Osaka, Japan). CHO hybrids were selected in the presence of 4 µg/ml of BS and collected for expansion. After construction of the tet-O-EGFP HAC vector by Cre/loxP recombination in CHO cells, the HAC was transferred from CHO into HT1080 cells via MMCT. The HT1080 hybrids were selected in the presence of 4 µg/ml of BS.2.5. PCR analysesGenomic DNA from cell lines was extracted using a genomic extraction kit (Gentra System, Minneapolis, MN, USA). PCR analyses were carried out using standard techniques. The primer pairs for detection of the HAC were: BACpr-F/BACpr-R (4075 bp), 5'-CTCTATACACTCAGTTGGAACACGAGAC-3' and 5'- GAGCCTGTGTAGCGTTTATAGGAAGTAG-3'. The primer pairs for confirmation of targeting of the loxP cassette into the HAC were: HRL-F/TKpAF (4.1 kb), 5'-CAGAGCCAGACAGGAAGGAATAATGTCAAG-3' and 5'-CCGGACGAACTAAACCTGAC-3'; PGKr-3/HRR-R (3.5 kb), 5'-CCAGAGGCCACTTGTGTA-3' and 5'-GCATCTCAATTAGTCAGCAACCATAGTCCC-3'. The primer pairs for detection of the HPRT gene reconstruction were: Trans-L1/R1 (409 bp), 5'-TGGAGGCCATAAACAAGAAGAC-3' and 5'-CCCCTTGACCCAGAAATTCCA-3'. The primer pairs for determination of the EGFP gene were: EGFPL/R (479 bp), 5'-CCTGAAGTTCATCTGCACCA-3' and 5'-TGCTCAGGTAGTGGTTGTCG-3'. Primers FurinF/R, 5'-ACTCAGAGATCCACTGCACCAGGATCCAAGGGAGG-3' and 5'-CCGCTCGAGCGGCTACACCACAGACACCATTGTTGGCTACTGCTGCC-3', were used as an internal control for CHO cells after HAC transfer into human cells via MMCT.2.6. HAC elimination by its targeting with chromatin modifiersHT1080 cells expressing the tTS fusion proteins were obtained using a retroviral vector as described previously.15 A retroviral expression vector was transfected into 293FT cells (Invitrogen) with Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen). After 4 h, the medium was changed with a fresh medium. After 48 h, the supernatant was collected by centrifugation at 1500 rpm and an aliquot (2–5 µl) was added to HT1080 cells carrying the HAC. The infected cells were cultured with 800 µg/ml of geneticin and 1 µg/ml of doxycycline (dox) for 24 h. After 7 days of culture in the presence of geneticin, an elimination assay was performed under the culture conditions: dox(-) 7 days, dox(+) 7 days and dox(+) 7 days ganciclovir(+) 5 days.2.7. FACS analysisMitotic stability of the HAC carrying the EGFP gene was determined by FACS as described previously.172.8. Southern blot analysisSouthern blot hybridization was performed as described previously with a 32P-labelled probe.18 Genomic DNA from cells containing the tet-O HAC was digested by SpeI, CHEF separated, and blot-hybridized with a 201-bp probe specific to a sequence corresponding to the BAC vector region that is repeated 47 times in the HAC. The probe was amplified by PCR using the following 4243/4443 primers 5'-GGGCAATTTGTCACAGGG-3' and 5'-ATCCACTTATCCACGGGGAT-3'. Blots were incubated for 2 h at 65°C in pre-hybridization solution (0.5 M Na-phosphate buffer containing 7% SDS and 100 mg/ml of unlabelled salmon sperm carrier DNA). Labelled probe (20 ml) was heat denatured in boiling water for 5 min and snap cooled on ice. The probe was added to the hybridization buffer and allowed to hybridize overnight at 65°C. Blots were washed twice in 2× SSC (300 mM NaCl, 30 mM sodium citrate, pH 7.0), 0.1% SDS for 30 min at room temperature, then three times in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 30 min at 65°C. Blots were exposed to X-ray film for 24–72 h at -70°C.3. Results and discussion3.1. Retrofitting the tet-O HAC with a loxP cassette in DT40 cellsThe tet-O HAC was constructed in human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells,15 because these are the only cells that support efficient formation of HACs from alphoid DNA arrays. Subsequently, the tet-O HAC was transferred into chicken DT40 cells, the standard host for homologous targeting of HACs and mammalian chromosomes by homologous recombination. In addition, DT40 cells form microcells, which facilitate transfer of modified HACs to other mammalian cells. The overall strategy used to modify the tet-O HAC is shown in Fig. 1. First, HT1080 cells carrying the tet-O HAC were fused to high-microcell forming mouse A9 cells, and hybrid A9BH-3 cells were isolated under selection for resistance to BS and G418. The morphology of A9BH-3 cells was similar to that of A9 cells (Fig. 2A), but different from the morphology of HT1080 cells. HAC-specific PCR and FISH was used to confirm the presence of the tet-O HAC in A9BH-3 hybrid cells (Fig. 2B). The hybrid cells form microcells in response to colcemid treatment (data not shown). Second, the tet-O HAC was transferred from hybrid cells into chicken DT40 cells by MMCT.7 In DT40 cells, the tet-O HAC was maintained autonomously without integration into chromosomes (Fig. 2C). The loxP-targeting cassette containing the drug-resistance marker hygromycin, the 5'-end of the HPRT gene, and the Tk gene was introduced into the tet-O HAC by homologous recombination in DT40 cells as shown in Fig. 2D. More than 30 clones were obtained under selection for hygromycin. FISH analysis showed that the loxP cassette recombined into the HAC but not into host chromosomes, and the modified HAC remained stable as an episome (Fig. 2E and Supplementary Table S1) with no detectable change in HAC structure, as detected by Southern blot hybridization. These data show that MMCT successfully transferred the HAC to recipient DT40 cells and that HAC modification by homologous recombination proceeded with high fidelity (Supplementary Fig. S1).

FISH analysis was performed using a biotin-labelled probe for the loxP cassette (green) and digoxigenin-labelled human hCot1 (red).The tet-O HAC carries ~47 copies of the BAC vector used for assembly and propagation of synthetic alphoid DNA arrays.15 The loxP cassette shares homology with the BAC sequences on the tet-O HAC and is targeted into these sequences at one or more sites by homologous recombination in DT40 cells. The copy number of the loxP cassette in the tet-O HAC was 1–32, as determined by a real-time PCR (Supplementary Fig. S2). Two clones, DT40/BHI 1–38 and DT40/BHI 2–2, with 1 and ~20 copies of the loxP cassette, respectively, were chosen for further analysis.To investigate whether the tet-O HAC with the loxP cassette retained a conditional centromere, a tet-R-transcriptional transactivator fusion protein was expressed in DT40 cells using the pTet-on advanced vector (TAKARA). The pTet-on expression construct containing the reverse transcriptional transactivator (rtTA) and the Neo gene was introduced by electroporation into DT40/BHI 1–38 and DT40/BHI 2–2 cells, and HAC retention was measured by FISH analysis. Using this ‘tet-on’ expression system, the rtTA fusion binds to tet-O sequences in the presence of doxycycline, causing centromere inactivation and HAC destabilization. HAC retention was measured by FISH analysis in two randomly selected DT40/BHI 1–38 and DT40/BHI 2–2 cultures maintained for 7 days in the presence or the absence of doxycycline (when the rtTA fusion protein does not bind to the centromere; Supplementary Fig. S3). The results indicated that retention of the tet-O HAC decreased dramatically when DT40 cells were grown in the presence of doxycycline. Thus, the tet-O HAC retains a conditional centromere after MMCT into DT40 cells and insertion of the loxP cassette by targeted recombination.3.2. EGFP transgene insertion into tet-O HAC by Cre-loxP recombination in CHO cellsThe tet-O HAC containing 1 and 20 copies of the loxP site, BHI 1–38 and BHI 2–2 (Supplementary Fig. S2), were transferred from DT40 cells to HPRT-deficient CHO cells via MMCT. More than 20 BS-resistant clones were obtained for each HAC. PCR analysis with a set of HAC-specific primers that bind to a region proximal to the loxP cassette showed that roughly half of the BS-resistant clones maintained the tet-O HAC (Supplementary Table S1). FISH analysis showed that the tet-O HAC propagated autonomously (Fig. 3A and B). No detectable changes in the HAC structure were detected by Southern blot (Supplementary Fig. S1).

Primers TRANS-L1/TRANS-R1 were used to detect Cre/loxP recombination.The loxP cassette in the modified tet-O HAC is designed for site-specific gene targeting using Cre recombinase. To test this feature and determine the efficiency of gene targeting into the modified tet-O HAC, an EGFP/HPRT transgene construct and a Cre-recombinase expression vector were co-transfected into CHO cells carrying the modified tet-O HAC with 1 and 20 copies of the loxP cassette (Fig. 3C and D). Recombinant clones were selected by growth in HAT medium for 12 days. PCR analysis with TRANS-L1/TRANS-R1 primers showed that the HPRT gene was reconstituted in all drug-resistant clones (Fig. 3F). All the transfectants expressed the EGFP transgene. A fluorescent image of one representative clone, CHOBHIG-11, with the HAC that was transferred from DT40/BHI 2–2 is shown in Fig. 3E. The efficiency of targeting into both HACs was ~2 × 10-4, indicating that the number of loxP cassettes in the HAC was not a critical determinant of gene-targeting efficiency. The same efficiency of HACs with 1-loxP copy and 20-loxP copies might be explained by different accessibility of loxP sites in the HAC with 20 copies, i.e. some loxP sites may be ‘masked’ by heterochromatin. Expression of the EGFP transgene was detected by fluorescence microscopy and was stable for at least 12 weeks under selective conditions (data not shown). The tet-O-EGFP HAC also exhibited relatively high stability in CHO cells (up to 50% HAC retention after 2 months of growth under non-selective conditions). The tet-O-EGFP HAC was inactivated and destabilized when rtTA was expressed in these cells, as shown above in DT40 cells (Supplementary Fig. S3). Thus, the tet-O-EGFP HAC retains a conditional centromere in CHO cells.3.3. Propagation of the retrofitted tet-O HAC in human HT1080 cells and expression of the reporter geneThe properties of the tet-O-EGFP HAC were re-examined after transfer from CHOBHIG-11 into human HT1080 cells via MMCT. Under selection for BS, 15 drug-resistant clones that expressed the EGFP transgene were isolated (Fig. 4A). PCR analyses with a set of HAC-specific primers showed that all the 15 clones contain the HAC. FISH analysis showed that the HAC was maintained autonomously in six out of six randomly selected clones (Fig. 4B and Supplementary Table S1). Analysis of the tet-O-EGFP HAC after its transferring into HT1080 cells. (A) The tet-O-EGFP HAC was hybridized with biotin-labelled EGFP-targeting vector (green). (B) FISH analysis was performed on HT1080BHIG interphase nuclei as shown in (A).

(E) Tet-O HAC retention was calculated as described in (B).The following experiments examine whether the tet-O-EGFP HAC retains a conditional centromere and determines the conditions that induce loss of this HAC from HT1080 cells. In our previous study,15 we demonstrated that retro virus-induced tTS expression is highly efficient in tet-O HAC elimination in HT1080 cells but not efficient from the plasmid. Therefore, a retroviral vector expressing tTS-EYFP was introduced into HAC containing HT1080 cells as described previously.15 This vector expresses a fusion of tet-R and the Kruppel-associated box (KRAB)-AB silencing a domain of the Kid-1 protein,19,20 which binds to tet-O in the absence of doxycycline. After transfection with the tTS fusion construct, neomycin-resistant HT1080 clones were selected in the presence of doxycycline, conditions that support proper HAC segregation and HAC stability. The HAC elimination assay was then performed by transfer of the stable transfectants to media lacking doxycycline. FISH analysis revealed dramatic HAC loss after removal of doxycycline (Fig. 4E), which allows the tTS fusion protein to bind to tet-O in the HAC centromere. Thus, after three rounds of MMCT, the HAC retained a conditional centromere. It is worth noting that no detectable cell death was observed during inactivation of kinetochore in the HAC, as reported previously.15The loxP cassette in the tet-O HAC also carries the HSV-Tk gene, which can be selected against, because it encodes a gene product that causes cell death in a medium containing ganciclovir (Fig. 3C). Consistent with this, FISH and FACS analyses showed that the cells without HAC were selected when cells were grown in the presence of ganciclovir (data not shown). A fraction of tet-O HAC-less cells was even higher when ganciclovir selection was combined with tTS expression (Fig. 4E). Additional experiments demonstrated that EGFP was stably expressed in HT1080 cells carrying the tet-O-EGFP HAC for at least 4 weeks (data not shown).Together, these data show that the tet-O HAC with a conditional centromere retains all its functional features through three rounds of MMCT and two cycles of targeted engineering. Furthermore, the engineered features of the tet-O HAC and its derivatives, including ability to stably express cloned transgenes, function well in chicken DT40, hamster CHO and human HT1080 cells. This suggests that the host cell environment does not significantly influence the functionality of the tet-O HAC.3.4. Potential of the tet-O HAC vectorIn our previous studies, we developed the tet-O HAC, whose centromere can be inactivated in HT1080 cells by targeting with tet-R fusions with eukaryotic chromatin modifiers.15,16 The tet-O HAC is a unique system for the study of epigenetic modifications in the human kinetochore, but it cannot be used for gene delivery and gene expression studies. In this work, the tet-O HAC was further engineered by insertion of a loxP-5' HPRT-Hyg-Tk cassette by homologous recombination in chicken DT40 cells. The modified HAC reported here has features that allow it to be a useful vector for gene cloning, delivery and expression in mammalian cells.A transgene of ~20 kb in size was efficiently inserted into the loxP site in the modified tet-O HAC by Cre-mediated recombination in CHO cells. Insertion of human genes >60 kb in length was recently also achieved (V.L., unpublished data). Because CHO cells form microcells at a high frequency, the HAC can be easily moved from donor CHO cells into any recipient human or mouse cell lines via MMCT for additional functional analysis.Importantly, the centromere in the HAC can be inactivated in all three animal cell types tested in this study (human, hamster and chicken). This observation indicates that no significant primary sequence or gross structural changes were introduced into the HAC during three cycles of MMCT and that the functionality of the conditional centromere is relatively insensitive to host cell factors. Indeed, Southern blot analysis of the tet-O HAC confirmed identical profiles in all three host cells. In addition, an EGFP transgene inserted into the loxP cassette could be stably expressed for at least 12 weeks, despite the presence of adjacent functional centromeric DNA. This suggests that the functional kinetochore co-exists with permanently open chromatin domains in mammalian cells. However, additional studies are needed to determine whether a transgene in the loxP cassettes on the tet-O HAC requires specific insulator sequences, which prevent gene silencing due to spreading of pericentromeric heterochromatin during cell propagation.It is worth noting that this HAC cloning system is compatible with the TAR cloning technology allowing selective isolation of full-length genes from complex genomes by homologous recombination in yeast.21 In particular, a newly developed TAR cloning vector that contains the loxP/HPRT cassette can be used to insert any TAR-isolated gene into the tet-O HAC with a conditional centromere directly in CHO cells using Cre/loxP recombination (V.L., unpublished data).The tet-O HAC vector has significant advantages over other expression/cloning systems, because it provides a mechanism to compare the phenotype of a mammalian cell with or without a functional copy of any cloned gene of interest. Thus, a rigorous negative control for phenotypic changes attributed to expression of the cloned gene can be conducted easily in any population of dividing cells by simply inactivating the tet-O HAC centromere. Such controls are required for proper interpretation of gene function studies. In addition, the modified tet-O HAC vector can be used for experiments that require transient expression of a cloned gene of interest. For example, iPS cells are generated by transient expression of specific cellular factors, including OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, cMYC and LIN28. In this case, HAC elimination and removal of the stem cell-inducing factors could provide a strategy to avoid insertional mutagenesis and cell transformation, complications that are frequently observed during cell re-programming.22The capacity for transient expression of cloned genes is also important for other translational research studies. For example, somatic mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are mortal, so it is difficult to propagate and expand MSC cultures for transplantation experiments. This problem can be overcome by transient expression of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), which extends MSC life span by preventing telomere shortening.23,24 However, our study has shown that constitutive hTERT expression in MSCs prevents their differentiation into muscle cells, possibly because hTERT is normally down-regulated during MSC differentiation (unpublished data). Reversible immortalization by transient expression of hTERT from a viral vector has already been reported in human fibroblasts.25 However, even if the gene is eliminated after transient expression from a viral vector, use of the viral vector is associated with risk of insertional mutagenesis leading to cancer or other cellular dysfunction.2 So, complete elimination of hTERT and vector sequences from MSCs after reversible immortalization is preferred. The tet-O HAC cloning system described in this work provides an important tool for engineering differentiated cells that can safely be used for cell transplantation.In summary, the modified tet-O HAC described here is a unique HAC-based cloning system for gene expression and gene function studies. Because the tet-O HAC is generated from synthetic alphoid DNA arrays and vector DNA whose DNA sequence is completely defined, this mammalian cell cloning system may have significant potential for gene therapy.Supplementary DataSupplementary Data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis study was supported by the 21st Century COE program from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan (M.O.), the Grand-in-Aid for Scientific Research from Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan (M.O. and H.M.).

IntroductionTwo-component systems (TCSs) are key molecular regulators that control many of the biological processes such as cell division, cell growth and proliferation, and responses to environmental stimuli and growth regulators in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells.1–6 The simplest form of TCS is composed of a sensory histidine kinases (His-kinases), which senses signal input, and a response regulator (RR), which mediates the output of a response. Phosphorylation of the RR modulates its ability to mediate downstream signalling.7 TCSs can also form a more complex His-to-Asp phosphorelay. In bacteria, yeast, slime moulds and plants, the so-called multiple His-to-Asp phosphorelay makes use of a ‘hybrid’ kinase that contains both a His-kinase (HK) domain and a receiver domain (Rec) in one protein. The TCSs also include a His-containing phosphotransfer (HPt) domain, which functions as a signalling module that connects to the final RRs.5 The HPts are present in a wide range of organisms from bacteria to eukaryotes.6,8 In multistep phosphorelays that involve HPts, the phosphate is transferred from HK to RR via a multistep His-to-Asp phosphorelay. It is suggested that this mechanism is advantageous because it provides multiple regulatory checkpoints for signal crosstalk or negative regulation by specific phosphatases.7,9 In some cases, the HKs may have dual functions such as possessing both HK and phosphatase activities. For instance, in Arabidopsis, the bifunctional AHK4/CRE1, a cytokinin (CK)-activated kinase exhibits a dual function depending on the presence or the absence of CK. In the presence of CK, AHK4 phosphorylates the HPt. Conversely, it removes phosphate from HPt in the absence of CK.10 The existence of multistep phosphorelay reactions in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes suggests that similar mechanisms should be more widely used in nature. However, it is interesting that the canonical His-to-Asp phosphorelay is not found in animals. Computational analyses have confirmed that two-component signalling elements are absent from the genome sequences of Homo sapiens, Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans.11Water deficit and high salinity stress limit crop productivity worldwide. In response to these stresses, plants activate a number of endogenous defense mechanisms that function to increase tolerance to adverse conditions. Phosphorylation, which is mediated by TCSs or His-to-Asp phosphorelays, is a key mechanism for stress signal transduction in cells. TCS components have been systematically identified and analysed in two completely sequenced and well-annotated model plant species: Arabidopsis thaliana and rice (Oryza sativa).2,4,12 Recently, Ishida et al.13 compiled putative TCS-associated components in Lotus japonicus, which has 67% of the genome, covering 91.3% of the gene space, sequenced.14 Increasing evidence indicates that the Arabidopsis and rice TCS pathways are involved in response to environmental stimuli. For instance, in Arabidopsis, among the identified Arabidopsis HKs (AHKs), the non-ethylene AHKs (AHK1–5) have been shown to be involved in regulation of stress and abscisic acid (ABA) signalling.15In planta studies have demonstrated that AHK1 functions as a positive regulator, whereas AHK2, AHK3 and AHK4 as negative regulators in ABA and osmotic stress signalling in both ABA-dependent and ABA-independent pathways.15,16 AHK5/CKI2, which may also function in stress response, is the only cytoplasmic HK, which lacks transmembrane (TM) domains. Recent studies have suggested that AHK5 functions to counteract ethylene and ABA-regulated growth as well as in mediating H2O2-dependent processes in stomatal guard cells.17,18 AHK2, AHK3 and AHK4 function as CK receptors.19,20 However, at the present time, it is not known whether ABA or CK serve as the functional ligand in stress signalling. The ligands for AHK1 and AHK5 also remain to be identified. The involvement of AHK1–5 HKs in stress responses suggests that the downstream Arabidopsis HPts (AHPs) and RRs may function in relation to stress responses as well. Miyata et al.21 reported that the expression of AHP1, AHP2 and AHP3 does not change in response to cold, drought and salt stresses, but are reduced by heat stress. Currently, there are no in planta evidence that characterize the regulatory roles of AHPs in stress signalling. Among the Arabidopsis RR (ARR) genes, ARR4 and ARR5 expression is induced by low temperature, dehydration and high salinity, demonstrating their potential regulatory functions in environmental stress signalling.22 Recently, loss-of-function studies of type-A arr mutants described a complex function for the type-A ARR genes in osmotic stress regulation where ARR3 and ARR4 genes play negative roles, whereas ARR8 and ARR9 function in positive roles.16 Whether or not the type-B ARR genes are involved in stress regulation remains to be determined. As for the Arabidopsis pseudo-RRs (APRRs), recent data indicated that at least APRR5, APRR7 and APRR9 are implicated in abiotic stress responses as negative regulators. This was concluded since a prr9-11 prr7-10 prr5-10 triple mutant displayed strong tolerance against drought, salt and cold stresses.23 After the rice TCS genes have been identified,4 very little is known regarding their functional involvement in environmental stresses. However, expression studies have indicated that the transcription of several rice TCS members, including kinase, HPt and RR encoding genes, is altered by salt-stress treatments.24–26 Currently, abiotic stress-related data are not available for TCS components in L. japonicus.13Soybean (Glycine max) is a nutritionally important crop that provides an abundant source of oil and protein for worldwide human consumption and animal feed.27–29 In addition, soybean is also viewed as an attractive crop for the production of renewable fuels such as biodiesel. The soybean genomic sequence has been recently completed, which provides an invaluable resource for functional genomics studies at a genome-wide level.30 Given the importance of TCS pathways in diverse biological and physiological processes, including our main interest area of abiotic stress responses, we performed genome-wide analyses in soybean to identify all key TCS components in this model-cropping system. We also carried out a comprehensive analysis of tissue-specific expression data generated by high-throughput microarray expression profiling experiments to discuss on the expression profile and possible functions of the soybean TCS genes. Since the Arabidopsis and rice genomes are well annotated and there is a wealth of functional information for Arabidopsis and rice TCS elements, especially abiotic stress-related functions, we performed sequence analysis and phylogenetic relationship studies of TCS elements of soybean, Arabidopsis and rice as another approach to predict the function of soybean TCS members. Since our main interest is to predict TCS genes involved in stress responses, we searched for the existence of all known abiotic stress-responsive cis-elements on the promoter regions of TCS genes to complement functional predictions using comparative analysis. By coupling knowledge gained from the presence of stress-responsive cis-elements together with data obtained from comparative analyses of Arabidopsis and/or rice TCS members for which stress-related functions are already known, we are able to effectively predict key stress-responsive TCS genes. Taken together, in this study, we performed a comprehensive and high-quality census of TCS members encoded within the soybean genome. These results provide a solid foundation for further systematic characterization of soybean TCS elements using traditional molecular approaches and/or genomic techniques at either the single-gene level or family-wide scale.2. Materials and methods2.1. Identification of the TCS members in soybeanAs an initial step for identifying genes encoding TCS elements from the annotations of the Glyma1 model, a reciprocal similarity search method was performed between the protein sequence data set of known TCS members, including all the HKs, HPts and RRs of Arabidopsis and rice,5,31 and the modelled soybean proteome data set.30 The first search (forward search) was performed using the protein sequence data set of HKs, HPts and RRs of Arabidopsis and rice as the query against the modelled Glyma1 proteome data set with the blastp program of the NCBI BLAST with a pre-defined threshold of E < 1e-5. Hit sequences from soybean proteins were then used as the query in the second search (reverse search) against the proteome data sets of both Arabidopsis (TAIR9) and rice (TIGR/MSU Pseudomolecule ver.6) with the same threshold set for the first search. The soybean-modelled proteins showing hits in reciprocal manners and containing full open reading frames as predicted by the Glyma1 model were used for further annotation steps. If Glyma1 predicted several splicing variants for a given gene, all the alternative splice variants were carefully checked. Splice variants encoding the longest reading frames were selected, taking into account also available FL-cDNA information, as representatives for subsequent sequence alignments and phylogenetic analyses.2.2. Annotation of the soybean genes putatively encoding TCS membersTo confirm the structures of protein domains conserved in each soybean TCS member, InterProScan and the InterPro database (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/) were applied, and HMM (Hidden Markov Model) profiles corresponding to domains annotated as CCT, CHASE, HPT, HisKA, MYB, PHY, RR (or RRB) and STK were used for HMMER searches.32 To annotate the TM domain, TMHMM (ver. 2.0c) was also used for soybean putative HK proteins.33 Additionally, to search for FL-cDNA clones that are available for the TCS encoding genes, we also screened the sequence sets of ESTs and high-throughput cDNAs of RIKEN soybean FL-cDNA clones (http://rsoy.psc.riken.jp/).2.3. Phylogenetic analysisSequence alignments of related proteins belonging to each class from Arabidopsis, rice and soybean proteins were performed using ClustalX with the following parameter set: gap open penalty = 10 and gap extension penalty = 0.2.34 The alignments were then visualized using GeneDoc (http://www.nrbsc.org/gfx/genedoc/) as presented in Supplementary Figs S1, S3 and S5. The sequence alignments were also used to construct the unrooted phylogenetic trees by the neighbour-joining method using MEGA4 software.35 The confidence level of monophyletic groups was estimated using a bootstrap analysis of 1000 replicates. Only the bootstrap values higher than 50% are displayed next to the branch nodes.2.4. Gene duplications and gene clusters of soybean TCS membersGene duplications and gene clustering formed by soybean TCS genes were estimated by analysing the amino acid sequences of TCS genes found on soybean chromosomes as described previously.32 Specifically, the presence of genes that can form pairs or clusters of closely homologous genes based on a global sequence similarity with a threshold of more than 60% amino acid sequence identity using cd-hit program of CD-HIT package was investigated.36 Gene clusters are defined as genetic loci containing three or more closely homologous genes.2.5. Expression data for soybean TCS encoding genesGene expression data for each putative soybean TCS encoding gene were retrieved from the soybean gene expression data housed within the Genevestigator database by correspondences between soybean genes from the Glyma1 model and probe identifiers from Affymetrix GeneChip probes.37 The respective model IDs used in the Glyma1 model for the respective model IDs that were used in the Affymetrix Genechip were identified by Soybase (http://soybase.org/AffyChip/index.php).38 Gene expression data for Arabidopsis TCS encoding genes were also retrieved from Genevestigator database.2.6. Discovery of cis-regulatory motifs in promoter regions of transcription factor genesTo discover stress-responsive cis-motifs located in the -1000-bp promoter regions of each putative soybean TCS gene, we retrieved the -1000-bp upstream sequence from either the putative transcription start site, if assigned, or the start codon, if the transcription start site was not yet assigned, for each TCS encoding gene from the Glyma1 annotation (Supplementary Tables S1–S3 and Supplementary Dataset 1). Next, we used stress-responsive cis-motifs previously reported as queries to search against the promoter sequences.39 The matched cis-sequences were counted, and presented in Supplementary Tables S1–S3.3. Results and discussion3.1. Identification of TCS elements in soybeanGenome analyses initially suggested that there are 16 HKs in Arabidopsis that were classified into the non-ethylene receptor AHK, the ethylene receptor and the phytochrome gene subfamilies.2 Subsequent results from kinase assays indicated that out of five ethylene receptor kinases, three members (EIN4, ERS2 and ETR2), and all five phytochrome kinases possess Ser/Thr kinase activity rather than HK activity.5,40,41 Furthermore, all five phytochrome kinases lack all five conserved signature motifs that are known to be functionally important for HKs. Collectively, these reports indicated that there are only eight HKs with HK activity in Arabidopsis. Similarly, it was initially reported that the rice genome contains 14 HKs, including all the rice kinases which showed high similarity to the non-ethylene receptor AHK, ethylene receptor and phytochrome kinases of Arabidopsis.4,12 Recently, implementation of standardized nomenclature for the rice TCS elements described eight HKs, including six non-ethylene receptor and two ethylene receptor kinases, in the rice genome.31A bioinformatics pipeline was established to search for TCS-related genes involved in His-to-Asp phosphorelay across the soybean genome. To search for the putative HKs in soybean, all the eight HKs from both Arabidopsis and rice were used in blastp analyses against the deduced soybean proteome. A similar approach was implemented for the identification of soybean HPts and RRs. After cross-searching the soybean genome, we identified unique hits. We refined these results by performing subsequent reciprocal blastp analyses against the Arabidopsis proteome. We also performed InterProScan and HMMER searches using appropriate HMM profiles featuring the TCS proteins and a manual inspection to confirm the identified set of TCS-related genes in soybean. Our results indicate that the soybean genome contains 21 HK, 10 authentic HPt, 3 pseudo-HPt, 18 type-A RR, 15 type-B RR, 3 type-C RR and 13 pseudo-PRR encoding genes (Tables 1–3). Table 4 indicates the current numbers of TCS genes identified to date in four plant species: Arabidopsis, rice, L. japonicus and soybean. A summary including gene ID defined by the Glyma1 model for each of the predicted genes, corresponding available full-length cDNA (FL-cDNA) accession numbers (RIKEN) and the chromosomal location of all the TCS elements identified in soybean are presented in Supplementary Tables S1–S3. In addition to these aforementioned data, we also listed hyperlinks to available expression data. Additionally, the cDNAs, protein sequences and promoter regions (-500, -1000 and -1500 bp) annotated by the Glyma1 model are provided as additional data that can be easily downloaded (Supplementary Dataset 1).

The HK protein family in soybeanGenome-wide analysis supports the existence of 21 putative hybrid HKs in soybean. This number is considerably larger than the 8-member family in both Arabidopsis and rice and the 14 genes from L. japonicus (Tables 1 and 4). The size of the predicted proteins range from 636 to 1226 amino acids with overall 8.1–98.5% identity and 16.82–99.6% similarity in amino acid sequence (Table 1; Supplementary Figs S1 and S2). Among these soybean HKs, similarity searches with Arabidopsis and rice HKs have identified 17 as non-ethylene receptor (GmHK) and four as ethylene receptor-like soybean HKs. The non-ethylene GmHKs were further classified into eight CK receptor-like GmHKs, three AHK1-like GmHKs, five AHK5-like and one CKI1-like GmHKs (Table 1). Domain analysis of these GmHKs confirmed that all the 17 non-ethylene GmHKs have a typical hybrid HK-type structure with a conserved HK domain which contains the conserved His phosphorylation site. In addition, the non-ethylene GmHKs also contain a complete Rec domain, which contains a highly conserved Asp as the phospho-acceptor, although the number of the TM domains is variable (Table 1; Supplementary Table S1 and Fig. S1). Additionally, all the eight CK receptor-like GmHKs contain the conserved cyclases/HK-associated sensory extracellular (CHASE) domain. In contrast, none of the other non-ethylene GmHKs and ethylene receptor-like soybean HKs contains CHASE domains (Table 1).In planta studies in Arabidopsis have provided strong evidence that the non-ethylene receptor AHK1 is involved with osmotic stress responses by functioning as a positive regulator of drought and salt-stress responses in ABA signalling.15,16 On the basis of sequence alignments and phylogenetic analyses, we identified three GmHKs which share over 60% high identity with AHK1 (Fig. 1; Table 1). In addition, recent genetic and molecular studies also demonstrated that among the non-ethylene receptor HKs of Arabidopsis, the CK receptors AHK2, AHK3 and AHK4 can act as negative regulators of osmotic stress signalling in both ABA-dependent and ABA-independent pathways.15,42 Our phylogenetic analysis supported the existence of eight CK receptor-like GmHKs in soybean which share 42.3–67.9% amino acid sequence identity with the established sequences for AHK2, AHK3 and AHK4 proteins (Fig. 1, Table 1 and Supplementary Table S2). In this subfamily of soybean CK receptor-like kinases, two proteins show more than 56% to AHK2, two display >67.7% to AHK3, and the remaining four show >63.2% sequence identity to AHK4, respectively (Table 1). In the two annotated AHK2-like GmHKs, we found two putative TM domains instead of the three domains that are reported for AHK2. The number of putative TM domains in several predicted rice CK receptor HKs is also different compared with that of their Arabidopsis counterparts. The OsHK5, which shows the highest amino acid identity to AHK2, has only one putative TM domain (Supplementary Fig. S2).4 Each of the AHK3-like and AHK4-like GmHKs contains three and two TMs, respectively, in their deduced amino acid sequences as their AHK3 and AHK4 orthologues (Supplementary Table S1). In addition to the AHK1–AHK4 proteins, AHK5 has been recently shown to be involved in stress responses.18 We found that five GmHKs show significant homology with AHK5 with overall 45.6–59.7% sequence identity (Table 1). Similar to what has been reported for AHK5, no putative TM domain could be predicted in the five AHK5-like GmHKs (Supplementary Table S1).

The bar indicates the relative divergence of the sequences examined. Bootstrap values higher than 50% are displayed next to the branch.According to our knowledge, CKI, which is the remaining non-ethylene receptor HK in Arabidopsis, does not function in stress responses. Loss-of-function studies have indicated that CKI1 function is required for megagametophyte development.43 It has also been reported that CKI1 can regulate His-to-Asp phosphorelay independently of CK. This CK-independent activity of CKI1 and the CK-induced functions of AHK2 and AHK3 are important for vascular bundle formation in Arabidopsis shoots.44 One protein (GmHK01) was detected within Glyma1 which displays significant homology with CKI1 (34.6% sequence identity). The GmHK01 protein and the predicted rice CKI1-like kinase do not contain the same number of TMs as Arabidopsis CKI1.4 The GmHK01 and the rice CKI1-like kinase contain one and two TM domains, respectively, whereas the Arabidopsis CKI1 possesses three TMs (Fig. 1; Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1).Our genome-wide analysis detected four HKs in soybean that can be classified as ERS1 and ETR1 ethylene receptor HK orthologues based on high sequence identity with their Arabidopsis counterparts (Fig. 1). These soy proteins share 56.6–81.6% sequence identity to Arabidopsis ERS1 and ETR1 proteins (Supplementary Fig. S2). Similar to their Arabidopsis counterparts, all the four putative soybean ethylene receptor HKs possess three TM domains, a GAF (cyclic GMP, adenylyl cyclase, FhlA) domain and a HK domain. However, only the two ETR1-like GmETR1 and GmETR2 (both have 81.6% identity to ETR1) carry the Rec domain, but the two ERS1-like GmERS1 (72.6% identity to ERS1) and GmERS2 (72.9% identity to ERS1) do not (Table 1, Supplementary Fig. S1). Although the Arabidopsis ERS1- and ETR1-type HKs have been shown to display HK activity,41,45 their major role in ethylene signalling remains to be elucidated.46–48 Additionally, ethylene has long been regarded as a stress hormone, and ethylene receptor HKs have been shown to function in stress signalings.49–51 It is known that ethylene is required for plant salt tolerance, and alteration of ethylene signalling affects plant salt-stress responses. ETR1 has been characterized as a negative regulator in salt signalling because a gain-of-function etr1-1 mutant exhibits a salt-sensitive phenotype.49 It is also possible that ERS1-like kinases play a role in stress responses. Expression of gene encoding a wheat ERS1-like kinase, which shares over 70% similarity to Arabidopsis ERS1, is up-regulated in treatments known to induce the senescence of detached leaves including jasmonate, ABA and wounding.523.3. The HPt protein family in soybeanThe current Glyma1 model allowed us to identify 10 authentic (GmHP1-10) and 3 pseudo (GmHP11–13) HPt proteins in soybean (Table 2). The numbers of authentic and pseudo-HPt proteins identified in Arabidopsis, rice and L. japonicus are summarized in Table 4. The percentage identity and similarity in amino acid sequences among the GmHPs and GmPHPs are between 27% and 98.1% and 39.6% and 99.4%, respectively (Supplementary Figs S3 and S4). The 10 putative GmHP genes encode GmHP proteins that all contain a typical phosphotransfer intermediate sequence with the conserved His phosphorylation site. Moreover, similar to Arabidopsis and rice counterparts, these 10 GmHPs share the HQXKGSSXS(I/V)G consensus sequence that contains the conserved His residue (underlined). The three pseudo-GmPHP genes encode pseudo-proteins which lack the invariant and phospho-accepting His residue. These occurrences are similar to those observed in the Arabidopsis pseudo-protein (AHP6/APHP1) and the three from rice (OsPHP1-3). The GmPHPs contain an N-residue instead of H at the conserved phosphorylation site (Supplementary Fig. S3).In Arabidopsis, AHP proteins have been shown to interact with both hybrid HKs and RRs, consistent with an ability to function in a multistep phosphorelay.53–56 Analyses of ahp knockout mutants have suggested their redundant function in CK signalling and plant development.57 The phylogentic tree constructed from all the authentic and pseudo-HPts of Arabidopsis, rice and soybean indicates the presence of subfamilies (Fig. 2). The GmHP01–06 and GmHP09 and 10 have a closed relationship with the established CK positive regulators AHP1, AHP2, AHP3 and AHP5, which are functionally redundant positive regulators in CK signalling.57 The GmHP07 and 08 proteins are close to AHP4, which is evolutionarily distinct from the other AHPs and may play a negative role in CK signalling (Fig. 2).57 Microarray analysis suggested that AHP4 is the only AHP protein that is down-regulated in response to osmotic stresses.58 The three atypical GmPHP11–13 proteins showed 72.6–79.4% identity to Arabidopsis AHP6, which functions as a competitor of other AHPs and plays a negative role in CK responses by interfering with phosphorelay.59 Interestingly, our phylogenetic analysis indicated that unlike the pseudo-GmPHPs, the three pseudo-OsPHPs (OsPHP1–3) of rice show higher sequence homology to the authentic AHP4 than the pseudo-AHP6 (Fig. 2).

The RR proteins family in soybeanThe completion of the soybean genome sequence has allowed us to predict a total of 49 RRs in soybean, including both the authentic and the pseudo-RRs. Previous reports have indicated that there are 32 genes in Arabidopsis, 36 genes in rice and 26 genes in L. japonicus encoding authentic and pseudo-RRs (Tables 3 and 4). In the TCS signalling pathway, the RRs function as terminal components by acting as phosphorylation-activated switches that catalyse the transfer of the phosphoryl group to a conserved Asp in its own regulatory domain. Structural analysis of the soybean RR proteins has enabled us to classify the soybean RRs into type-A GmRR, type-B GmRR, type-C GmRR and pseudo-GmPRR categories similar to those in Arabidopsis and rice based on their structural features (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S5).

Bootstrap values higher than 50% are displayed next to the branch.Analysis of the genomes of several plant species, ranging from unicellular algae, moss and lycophytes to higher plants, including Arabidopsis and rice, revealed that the type-A RRs first appeared in the land plant species.6 Among the 49 soybean RRs, we identified 18 type-A GmRRs (GmRR01–18), each of which contains a receiver domain along with a divergent C-terminal extension. The overall percentage identity of the type-A GmRRs ranges from 27.6% to 97.7%, and similarity from 39.5% to 99.3% (Supplementary Fig. S6). The phylogenetic tree developed from the RRs collected from Arabidopsis, rice and soybean indicates closed relationship among the type-A RRs of the three species, which might suggest similar functions for the soybean type-A GmRR (Table 3, Fig. 3). In Arabidopsis, the type-A ARR3–9 and 15 were reported to function as negative regulators of CK signalling.60–63 Some of the type-A ARRs have been shown to be involved in the regulation of light response (ARR4), circadian period (ARR3 and ARR4) and meristem size (ARR5, ARR6, ARR7 and ARR15).61,64–66 The GmRR01, GmRR06–08 and GmRR09–13 showed significant homology to ARR4, ARR8 and ARR9 proteins, respectively, which have been reported to function in stress signalling (Table 3, Fig. 3).16,22 Additionally, the expression of the six type-A OsRR genes (OsRR1, 3, 4, 6, 9 and 13) in rice has been shown to be stress inducible. When these functional data are taken into consideration with the information provided by our phylogenetic relationship study, we would get a hint about the potential stress-responsive type-A GmRR genes in soybean.24–26 Further studies of the type-A GmRR orthologues either in Arabidopsis or in soybean are warranted to shed light on their in planta function roles.The type-B GmRR subfamily consists of 15 members compared with 11 members in Arabidopsis and 13 in rice. Similar to the type-B RRs identified in other plant species, the type- B GmRRs are transcription factors (TFs). In addition, each of these type-B RRs contains an N-terminal receiver domain and a long C-terminal extension with an Myb-like DNA binding domain (GARP domain). The amino acid sequences of the type-B GmRRs share from 18.5% to 95.4% sequence identity and 27.37% to 98.8% similarityamong themselves (Supplementary Fig. S6). Interestingly, although the Arabidopsis type-B ARRs could be classified into three subfamilies (type B1, B2 and B3) based on a phylogenetic study,67 an analysis of phylogenetic relationship of soybean and Arabidopsis type-B RRs has revealed that without exception all the predicted type-B GmRR proteins were grouped into type-B1 subfamily (Fig. 3). The absence of the type-B2 and type-B3 GmRRs may be due to the following reasons: (i) the sequenced soybean genome comprised of only 950 Mb, representing ~85% of the predicted 1115-Mb genome; and/or (ii) approximately one-third of 66 400 putative protein-coding loci annotated in the Glyma1 model were predicted with low confidence.30 Therefore, we may expect that future update of soybean genomic sequence and/or fine-tuning of genome annotation might enable us to identify the type-B2 and type-B3 GmRRs.With their signature combination of RR and Myb domains, the type-B RRs are plant specific.68 Unlike the type-A RRs, the type-B RRs are present not only in land plant species but also in the unicellular algae, moss and lycophytes, suggesting that they might have originally performed a function in the regulation of photosynthesis and later been recruited for other functions such as CK signal transduction.6,69 The soybean type-B GmRRs may be capable of controlling various biological processes in similar manner. The Arabidopsis ARR1, ARR10 and ARR12 play key roles in CK signalling, and ARR2 may modulate ethylene signalling.69–73 Overexpression of activated type-B ARR20 results in plants with small flowers, abnormal siliques and reduced fertility, whereas that of activated type-B ARR21 created seedlings in which cell proliferation is activated to form callus-like structures.74 The rice OsRR30/Ehd1 is hypothesized to regulate developmental processes and environmental signalling mediated by CK, ethylene and light.75 With the exception of the stress-inducible profile of three type-B OsRR genes (OsRR21, 23 and 24), no information about the function of type-B RRs of any plant species in stress response is currently available.26 Thus, our phylogenetic analysis might serve as a comparative genomics approach for the selection of GmRR orthologues of stress-inducible type-B OsRR genes for further genetic studies in response to stresses (Fig. 3).Similar to the type-A RRs, both Arabidopsis and rice contain two type-C RRs which only have the receiver domain without the long C-terminal extension. However, the type-C RRs are not closely related to the type-A RRs as indicated by phylogenetic studies. The L. japonicus genome possesses at least one type-C RR (Table 4). In soybean, we identified three type-C GmRRs which grouped into the same group as Arabidopsis and rice type-C RRs (Fig. 3). Expression of the type-C ARRs of Arabidopsis, which is predominantly observed in flowers and siliques, is not regulated by CK, like that of Arabidopsis type-A ARRs. Overexpression of ARR22 showed reduced shoot growth, poor root development, reduced CK-responsive gene induction and insensitivity to CK under conditions for callus production. Collectively, these observations suggest that ARR22 possess an inhibitory function in CK signalling.76–78 The type-C RRs of soybean might have similar functions as their corresponding Arabidopsis orthologues.Previous works reported that there are nine pseudo-RRs (APRRs) in Arabidopsis and eight such genes (OsPRRs) in rice, with five clock-associated PRR genes in each.5,31 The total number of PRR genes in L. japonicus is unknown, but there may be at least five clock-associated PRR genes in L. japonicus (Table 4). We identified 13 pseudo-RR proteins (GmPRRs) in soybean which share from 5.23% to 87.1% identity and from 11.51% to 93% similarity among themselves (Supplementary Fig. S6). These soy GmPRRs contain receiver-like domains at their N-terminal end but lack the conserved Asp residue required for phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. S5). With the exception of GmPRR38, 41 and 42 proteins, which completely lack the Asp, the remaining GmPRRs have the Glu in the place of the Asp residue. Similar to the structure of pseudo-RRs in Arabidopsis and rice, the C-terminal domains of GmPRRs contain either a CCT motif (GmPRR37–40 and 42–45) or a Myb-like motif (GmPRR46–49). An exception occurred with the GmPRR41 which lacks both the CCT and the Myb motifs (Table 3 and Supplementary Table S3). Expression of the CCT-motif PRR genes varies in a circadian manner and loss-of-function mutants have altered circadian periods, suggesting that these types of PRRs participate in circadian rhythms.79–82 Our phylogenetic analysis suggest that the GmPRR37–40 and 42–45 proteins, which contain the CCT motif, may function in circadian rhythm as they show close relationship with the known clock-associated pseudo members of Arabidopsis (Fig. 3). No functional evidence has been provided to suggest the role for Myb-motif PRRs in any plant species. Since we are interested to identify stress-related GmPRR genes, we carefully examined the phylogenetic tree to identify those GmPRRs that show the highest homology to the clock-associated APPR5, APRR7 and APRR9 of Arabidopsis, which have been reported previously to implicate in abiotic stress regulation.23 Such GmPRR genes can be listed as GmPRR39–41 and 42–45 proteins (Fig. 3).3.5. Chromosomal distribution and gene duplications of TCS membersWe are also interested to characterize the local distribution and homology of TCS genes in each family relative to each other. Our analysis indicated that the soybean TCS members are distributed on every chromosome in soybean. For instance, the 21 identified soybean HKs are distributed among almost all 20 chromosomes with the exception for chromosomes 10, 13, 15, 16, 18 and 20 (Fig. 4). The GmRR genes are scattered throughout the soybean genome, with the exception of chromosomes 10 and 20. The members of GmHP family, which contains the smallest number of genes relative to kinase and RR families, are located on chromosomes 2, 7, 8, 10, 13, 15, 19 and 20 (Fig. 4). We also observed that a large number of TCS genes encode amino acid sequences that show high identity to each other (Supplementary Figs S2, S4 and S6). Previous studies have described duplications and clusters of highly homologous genes in Arabidopsis and soybean. Closely related or closely homologous genes, which are defined by >60% amino acid sequence identity,36 account for ~77.75% of the total number in the TF families of soybean.32 In Arabidopsis, gene duplications on either same chromosomes or different chromosomes may account for >60% of the genome.36 Two types of duplications and clusters can be distinguished based on the evolutionary history of the genes that they contain. The first type of duplications and clusters consists of a series of paralogous genes, suggesting that they arose through repeated tandem duplications which originated from a founding locus. In contrast, the second type of duplications and clusters contains genes that arose independently from each other at diverse locations within the genome. Over time, it is likely that they relocated to form these duplications and clusters.32Graphical representation of locations for putative TCS genes on soybean chromosomes. The (+) and (-) indicate the sense and antisense strands, respectively.

The (+) and (-) indicate the sense and antisense strands, respectively. Number displayed next to each gene ID indicates the position of the annotation start for each TCS gene in bases.By analysing alignments of the TCS proteins, we found that a large number of TCS genes form pairs or clusters of duplicated genes (Table 5). Pairs of duplicated genes on different chromosomes are most common and gene clusters of three or more highly related genes are also widely found. On the basis of the distance of their occurrence, a few of the duplicated genes could be classified arbitrarily as genes that were duplicated on the same chromosome. However, none of the duplicated genes could be categorized as tandemly duplicated. This categorization is based on a classification of tandemly duplicated genes as those which are duplicated in same chromosome but reside <50 kb apart from each other (Table 5).32,36 Within the soybean TCS members, 20 genes, accounted for 95.24%, encoding soybean HKs, may form pairs and clusters of closely homologous genes that have more than 60% amino acid sequence identity (Table 5). For instance, the CKI2-like GmHK02–06 proteins form eight pairs of closely related genes. These highly homologous genes are located on either the same (such as GmHK05 and 06 are located on the same chromosome 6, and share 77.2% identity) or different chromosomes (such as GmHK02 and 03 are located on chromosome 4 and 14, respectively, and share 70.7% identity; Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. S2). These distributions suggest that they were the resultants of duplications on either the same or different chromosomes, respectively. Among the soybean HPts, 9 of 10 authentic GmHP proteins form three very highly homologous pairs (GmHP04 and GmHP05 share 94%, GmHP07 and GmHP08 94.4%, and GmHP09 and GmHP10 97.3% identity, respectively) and one highly homologous cluster of three proteins (GmHP01, GmHP02 and GmHP03 have 82.8–98% amino acid identity to each other). The three pseudo GmPHP01–03 make a highly homologous cluster with 89.8–99.3% identity as well. If the 60% amino acid sequence identity criterion is applied for defining the closely related genes, we can define a cluster consisting of five genes of GmHP01–05 which encode authentic HPts sharing overall 66.6–98% identity. The HPt genes encoding highly homologous proteins are perhaps the products of genome duplications on different chromosomes as they are distributed on different chromosomes (Fig. 4). We were also able to discover several pairs and clusters formed by genes encoding RR proteins (Table 5). For example, we identified three pairs (GmRR04 and 05, GmRR07 and 08, and GmRR09 and 10) and two clusters of closely related genes (cluster of GmRR02, 03, 14 and 15, and cluster of GmRR06, 11, 12, 18), encoding proteins that share more than 60% amino acid sequence identity.

Evolutionary studies have suggested that the paleopolyploid soybean genome experienced two whole-genome duplication events at ~59 and 13 million years ago, resulting in a highly duplicated genome with nearly 75% of the genes present in multiple copies. Since then, the soybean genome has gone through extensive gene rearrangements and deletions to become diploidized.30,833.6. Analysis of expression patterns of TCS genes using Genevestigator databaseKnowledge about specific expression of TCS genes is interesting because it tells us about the genes which are involved in defining the precise nature of individual tissues. The specific expression of TCS genes was examined using the data set that is publicly available on the Genevestigator database.37 This bioinformatics resource contains measurements of transcript levels for 35 different organs and tissues. These data were obtained by microarray experiments using the Affymetrix Soybean Array GeneChip, which was designed specifically to analyse ~37 500 soybean, 15 800 Phytophthora sojae as well as 7500 Heterodera glycines transcripts. First, we identified the respective gene ID used in the Glyma1 model for the gene ID which was used in the Affymetrix GeneChip using Soybase (http://soybase.org/AffyChip/index.php). We confirmed that probes exist for a total of 9 GmHK (out of 21), 6 GmHP (out of 13) and 24 GmRR (out of 49) genes on the soybean GeneChip. The information on the expression patterns of these TCS genes, including those in 35 different organs and tissues, can be accessed through hyperlinks which link the genes directly to their respective pages on Genevestigator (Supplementary Tables S1–S3). The heat maps shown in Fig. 5 display the patterns of expression of these TCS genes across 35 major organs and tissues that were examined. The data supplied here are useful to assess the extent of TCS gene expression as they provide the first line of temporal and spatial evidence which links them to putative in planta functions.

Heat map representation for the tissue-specific expression of Arabidopsis TCS genes (B). Elevated expression levels are indicated by increasing intensities of blue colour expressed in log2 scale.Data analysis indicates high variability in transcript abundance of the soybean TCS genes. For instance, GmHK01 show weak expression in root and endosperm and insignificant in other tissues, whereas GmHK10, GmHK12 and GmETR2 are more abundant in all the tissues examined (Fig. 5A). The spatial expression patterns of the soybean TCS genes shown in the heat maps appear to be tissue-specific, suggesting that the functions of the soybean TCS members are diversified. Several TCS genes, such as GmHP01, GmHP03 and GmRR11, are root- and shoot-specific, whereas GmHP02, GmRR17 and GmRR34 show expression only in inflorescence and some of the seed tissues (Fig. 5A). None of the predicted type-B GmRR genes, for which expression data available, displayed predominant expression in endosperm (Fig. 5A), which was found as a unique feature for the type-B2 and type-B3 Arabidopsis ARR genes (Fig. 5B).84 This observation strengthens the result of phylogenetic analysis which grouped all the predicted type-B GmRR proteins into only the type-B1 subfamily (Fig. 3). On the other hand, we cannot rule out that the expression of some of other TCS genes, for which data are currently not available, may be ubiquitous. Ubiquitous TCS genes alone, if they exist, in isolation or in combination with each other, may control the general cellular machinery. It is possible that combinations of specific TCS members might be involved in the regulation of tissue-specific genes. It is noteworthy that the type-B RRs are TFs. It is therefore important to note that TF activity often depends on the post-translational events and that the levels of gene expression are not necessarily directly correlated with their regulatory activity. Moreover, since co-operativity between TFs has been shown to involve extensive protein–protein interactions, both within families of homomeric and heteromeric TFs and between structurally unrelated TFs, analysis of such interactions may help us to elucidate the patterns of combinatorial regulation and ultimately decipher the regulatory functions of the type-B RRs.85–87Comparison between the tissue-specific expression profiles of soybean and Arabidopsis TCS genes might shed the light into the functions of the soybean TCS genes (Fig. 5A and B). For example, the expression of both Arabidopsis CKI1 and its soybean orthologous GmHK01 was detected in endosperm of seed, suggesting that GmHK01 may play an important role in megagametogenesis as CKI1. GmHK09, which was predicted to encode an AHK1 orthologue, expresses mainly in shoot and root tissues as AHK1, whereas both GmHK14 and its orthologous AHK4 showed highest transcript abundance in root organs (Table 1; Figs 1 and 5).19,43,88 Collectively, the similar expression profiles may suggest similar function for Arabidopsis orthologous soybean TCS members. Taken together, our analyses of expression data and phylogenetic relationship of Arabidopsis and soybean TCS members indicate a correlation between gene expression, sequence conservation and gene function, which is consistent with the results reported previously.32,89,90One of our main interests in the expression analysis of soybean TCS elements is to predict abiotic stress-responsive TCS genes that will be taken in priority for further in planta functional studies. However, at the present time, the Genevestigator and other public resources do not contain data of high-throughput microarray transcript profiling experiments for tissues subjected to either drought or high salinity or cold or flooding which are the major abiotic stresses affecting soybean productivity. A larger search for other chemical stress inducers found a microarray analysis of soybean leaves, which were treated with polyethylene glycol (PEG), using an array containing 5760 soybean cDNAs (<10% of the soybean predicted genes). PEG is widely known as an osmotic stress inducer. Analysis of the down- and up-regulated data set identified only one down-regulated gene (AW567584, down-regulated 2.14-fold), which is identical to the GmPRR41, suggesting that GmPRR41 may play a role in abiotic stress response.91 Previously, our sequence analysis indicated that GmPRR41 shares significant identity with the Arabidopsis APRR7, which was shown to function as a negative regulator in drought, cold and salt stresses (Fig. 3, Table 3).23 This observation also indicates that expression correlates with sequence conservation. Thus, sequence-based comparative genomics might be used as an approach to predict the function of a protein. It is hoped that with the availability of the complete soybean genomic sequence, genome-wide transcriptome analyses will be accelerated, which would make abiotic stress-related large-scale expression data available in the near future so that the scientific research community can be supported in a more comprehensive manner.3.7. Cis-element- and comparative sequence analysis-based approach for prediction of abiotic stress-responsive TCS genes in soybeanPlants respond to environmental changes by altering large-scale transcriptional responses. The exquisite sensitivity and specificity of these responses are controlled in large part by cis-regulatory elements. The molecular mechanisms regulating gene expression in response to abiotic stresses have been studied by analysing the cis- and the trans-acting elements, i.e. the sequence-specific binding TFs.85,86 Over the years, extensive promoter analyses have identified a large number of cis-elements, which are important molecular switches that are functionally involved in the transcriptional regulation of a dynamic network of gene activities controlling various biological processes, including abiotic stress responses, hormone responses and developmental processes.39,92 Among these cis-elements, several members have been reported for their essential roles in determining the stress-induced expression patterns of genes.39Increasing evidence indicates that the cis-motifs are highly conserved among orthologous or paralogous genes and co-regulated genes. In addition, defined cis-elements can effectively aid in the genome-wide screening of ABA and abiotic stress-responsive genes.93,94 Therefore, a careful inspection of the existence of cis-regulatory elements in the promoter regions of the TCS genes can enable the prediction of functions for the respective TCS members in response to various stress stimuli. To facilitate the prediction and functional characterization of stress-responsive soybean TCS elements, we retrieved the -1000 promoter regions for all the TCS genes from soybean genomic sequence database and subjected them to an extensive in silico analyses to search for the existence of all known stress-responsive cis-regulatory motifs. The identified cis-sequences were then counted. Results of the search for cis-elements located in the -1000 promoter region of each TCS gene are provided on Supplementary Tables S1–S3. Table 6 indicates the TCS genes which contain stress-responsive cis-motif(s) in their -1000 bp promoter region. The occurrences of these motifs suggest that these TCS genes may have a potential functional role in stress signalling. Out of 12 stress-responsive cis-motifs used in the search, we found the occurrence of four cis-motifs. Among the TCS genes, we discovered that out of 21 soybean genes encoding HKs, 8 genes have stress-responsive cis-motifs in their promoter regions. It is worth mentioning that all these eight promoters contain cis-motifs for MYB/MYC-binding TFs. We could also detect stress-responsive cis-motifs (ABRE, MYB or MYC) in the promoter regions of three GmHP genes, seven type-A, four type-B, all three type-C and seven pseudo-GmRR genes, suggesting that these genes may be under the control of ABRE-binding TFs, such as the bZIP-type TFs, and/or MYB/MYC-binding TFs, such as bHLH- and MYB-related TFs (Table 6).32 The MYB-like type-B RRs have been shown to regulate the expression of some type-A RR genes.95 It would be interesting to see whether the MYB-like type-B RRs could also control the expression of the kinase and/or HPt encoding genes in a feedback regulation of stress signalling. The majority of the TCS genes predicted to function in stress signalling by cis-annotation were also predicted by comparative genomics with Arabidopsis counterparts (Table 6). Although the Arabidopsis counterpart of the AHK1-like soy HKs are stress inducible and function in stress signalling,15,16,88 it is important to note that none of the 12 major stress-responsive cis-motifs was detected in the -1000 bp promoter regions of the AHK1-like soy HKs (GmHK07–09; Tables 1 and 6). However, when we screened the -1000 bp promoter region of the AHK1 gene, we could not discover the existence of any of the 12 major stress-responsive cis-motifs in the -1000 bp promoter of AHK1 gene either (data not shown). We hypothesize that more stress-responsive TCS genes could be predicted if more stress-responsive cis-motifs and/or longer promoter regions were used in the predictive searches. Although we have included all the currently known major stress-responsive (drought, high salinity and cold stresses-responsive) cis-motifs in our study, we cannot rule out the possibility that additional stress-responsive cis-motifs exist in the plant genome. Furthermore, it should also be noted that all the cis-motifs used in this study were stress-inducible motifs, which can be used to predict the stress-inducible genes. However, there are also stress-repressive genes among the TCS genes,21 thus stress-repressive cis-motifs should be included into the study as well. Unfortunately, the identity of these types of cis-motifs is currently not known. Soybean TCS genes having stress-responsive cis-motif(s) in their promoter regionaFamily indicates classification based on sequence identity with the ARR proteins.bStress-related function of the Arabidopsis TCS members listed in ‘Family’ has been determined (Yes) or is still unknown (Unknown) based on literature analysis.Soybean TCS genes having stress-responsive cis-motif(s) in their promoter regionaFamily indicates classification based on sequence identity with the ARR proteins.bStress-related function of the Arabidopsis TCS members listed in ‘Family’ has been determined (Yes) or is still unknown (Unknown) based on literature analysis.At the present time, stress-related expression data are not yet available for soybean TCS genes. Our study aims to aid in selection of stress-related TCS members for further functional studies and genetic engineering through a systematic identification of stress-related TCS genes. Specifically, the integration of stress-responsive cis-motif annotation and comparative sequence analyses, which were carried out and described previously by sequence alignments and phylogenetic relationship studies, has been shown to effectively aid in the prediction of stress-related TCS members.3.8. ConclusionsRecent progress has provided compelling evidence that multistep component systems play important roles in signal transduction in response to environmental stimuli and plant growth regulators.15,16,23 In this regard, we have identified and characterized the complete set of TCS elements in soybean. Our analysis of the TCS machinery of soybean and comparative analysis with those of Arabidopsis and rice has revealed that the overall structure TCS machinery is very similar between these three species despite their disjunctive evolutionary histories. Individual TCS members from these three species also show significant sequence conservation. Since the assemblies of the soybean genome analysed in this study (the Glyma1 model) still need to be improved, part of the soybean TCS machinery identified in this study may be affected by future fine-tuning of their annotations.A number of studies have substantiated that sequence similarity-based clustering of the members of several gene families correlate with their function.32,89,90 Experimental characterizations of the TCS members of Arabidopsis, rice and maize in the CK signalling also provide evidence for the correlation between phylogenetic relationship and functional conservation.19,96,97 Moreover, a great deal of evidence demonstrates that defined cis-elements can effectively aid in prediction of stress-responsive genes.93,94 Therefore, the results of phylogenetic relationship studies of soybean TCS members with their Arabidopsis and rice TCS counterparts, among which stress-related functions of some members have been identified, can be combined with the results of cis-motif annotations for systematic functional predictions of the stress-related soybean TCS genes.In this study, we have provided a resource for (i) further elucidation of regulatory mechanisms of the soybean TCS machinery underlying different developmental and physiological processes, including environmental stress responses, and for (ii) comparative genomics and interspecific analysis of evolutionary relationship of TCSs within plants and comparisons to other organisms.Supplementary DataSupplementary Data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingResearch in Tran's Lab is supported by Grants-in-Aid (Start-up) for Scientific Research (21870046) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan and by a Start-up Support grant (M36-57000) from the RIKEN Yokohama Institute Director Discretionary Funds.

IntroductionRecent studies have revealed that epigenetic systems are involved in many aspects of biological processes. Epigenetics is often involved in conflict between genetic units. For example, epigenetic DNA methylation is associated with the silencing of selfish mobile elements and with the imprinting of alleles inherited from a particular parent. This review article introduces a new concept in epigenetics: intragenomic conflict with epigenetic systems. Such conflicts become apparent when they are resolved by cell death. The death takes place after decrease (Sections 5–8) or increase (Sections 9–15)1–3 in epigenetic DNA methylation (Table 1). Our emphasis will be on systems involving DNases, including those that are methyl specific. Programmed cell death and changes in epigenetic DNA methylationProgrammed cell death and changes in epigenetic DNA methylation2. Epigenetic DNA methylation and its significanceIn this review, the term epigenetic is defined as ‘not genetic, but heritable through DNA replication’ and is used to distinguish among three modes of DNA methylation: (i) genetic methylation, for example, in the biosynthesis of dTMP from dUMP, with subsequent incorporation into DNA by the replication machinery; (ii) epigenetic methylation, as in 5-methylcytosine (m5C), N4-methylcytosine (m4C), and N6-methyladenine (m6A), which are inherited by maintenance methylation after DNA replication; and (iii) non-genetic and non-epigenetic methylation, e.g. O6-methylguanine. The non-epigenetic and the non-genetic DNA methylation in O6-methylguanine are known to trigger cell death.4 Another class of DNA modification involves the use of a base other than A, T, G, and C in DNA. For example, some bacteriophage genomes carry hydroxymethylcytosine instead of cytosine,5 and dUMP is often incorporated in place of dTMP into some bacteriophage genomes.6In eukaryotes, epigenetic DNA methylation plays roles in chromatin organization, gene expression, and genome maintenance, and its disturbance is related to human diseases.7–9 In prokaryotes, it is crucial for processes including cell-cycle regulation, transcriptional regulation, and host-pathogen interaction.10–13 It is also involved in silencing selfish genetic elements and other aspects of intragenomic conflicts in eukaryotes14 and in prokaryotes (this review, see below).Switching on and off of DNA methyltransferase through phase variation in bacteria can change the entire transcriptome.15 Experimental alteration of epigenetic DNA methylation systems in prokaryotes can cause a variety of changes.10,15–18 Horizontal gene transfer between prokaryotic genomes is common,19 and the DNA methyltransferase genes, in particular, are known to frequently undergo this type of transfer.20–24 The DNA methyltransferases could, therefore, represent potential threats to the epigenomic integrity of prokaryotic genomes.3. Restriction–modification systemsIn prokaryotes, many epigenetic DNA methyltransferases are paired with a restriction enzyme.25 Restriction enzymes are DNA endonucleases that recognize specific DNA sequences and introduce a double-strand break (Fig. 1A). This activity restricts establishment of invading DNAs that lack proper DNA methylation, such as bacteriophage DNA genomes, plasmids, and DNA fragments delivered through natural transformation machinery (Fig. 1B). The potentially lethal cleavage of cellular DNA in cells that harbour a restriction enzyme is prevented by epigenetic DNA methylation by the cognate DNA methyltransferase that recognizes the same sequence as the restriction enzyme (Fig. 1A and B). Genes encoding the restriction enzyme and the methyltransferase are often located next to each other and form a unit called a restriction–modification system. Restriction–modification systems are classified into four types, Type I, II, III, and IV, based on their genetic and biochemical characteristics. Action of a Type II restriction–modification system. (A) Restriction enzyme and modification enzyme. The modification enzyme protects the restriction enzyme targets through DNA methylation. (B) Attack on incoming DNA lacking proper methylation. (C) Enforcement of an epigenetic state. After loss of the restriction–modification gene complex or imbalance between restriction and modification, DNA methylation decreases. The restriction enzyme will attack exposed sites, killing the cell. Chromosome breakage may be repaired or may generate a variety of mutated and rearranged genomes, some of which might survive. Ds, double strand; rm, restriction–modification gene complex; RM, restriction modification.Action of a Type II restriction–modification system. (A) Restriction enzyme and modification enzyme.

Ds, double strand; rm, restriction–modification gene complex; RM, restriction modification.3.1. Type II systemsType II restriction enzymes bind to a recognition sequence and cleave DNA in their vicinity26 and are frequently used in DNA engineering. For example, EcoRI, BamHI, and PvuII are Type II enzymes. Many variants are classified into subtypes within this type, based on biochemical characteristics.27 In many subtypes, restriction activity is present in one enzyme molecule, whereas modification activity is present on the other. Restriction enzymes in this class are divergent in amino acid sequence and three-dimensional structure and can be also classified based on these features.283.2. Type I systemsType I and III enzymes are composed of multiple subunits, and their restriction and modification activities depend on their subunit composition. Type I restriction enzymes are composed of three subunits, S, M, and R. The S subunit recognizes a specific DNA sequence. A complex of M and S subunits exhibits methyltransferase activity at the recognition site. The joining of the R subunit to this complex is essential for endonuclease activity. After binding to an unmodified recognition sequence, the restriction enzyme complex translocates DNA towards itself from both directions in a reaction coupled to ATP hydrolysis (Fig. 2A). When two restriction enzyme complexes collide, DNA cutting is triggered.29 This is consistent with an in vivo observation.30 Cleavage can occur also through interaction of the translocating restriction enzyme complex with a Holliday junction,31 a single-strand gap, a single-strand nick,32 or a long branch (Fig. 2B; see Section 8).33Models for Type I restriction enzyme activity. (A) Cleavage upon enzyme collision. After binding to an unmethylated recognition site, a Type I restriction enzyme complex begins pulling dsDNA. DNA is cleaved where two complexes collide. (B) Cleavage at an arrested DNA replication fork. DNA damage leads to aberrant DNA replication initiation, which exposes the unmethylated recognition sites. A Type I restriction enzyme complex begins pulling DNA. DNA is cleaved where the complex reaches an arrested replication fork.

Ellipse, Type I restriction enzyme; open square, unmethylated recognition site; filled circle with a bar, methyl group.Type I restriction modification enzymes have two modes of action that are controlled by the methylation state of their recognition sequence.34 If the sequence is fully methylated, the enzyme complex does not bind. When the sequence is hemi-methylated, the methyltransferase complex catalyzes an efficient methyltransfer reaction to the other strand. When the sequence is unmethylated, the restriction enzyme complex is formed and translocation begins, leading to cleavage.343.3. Type III systemsType III restriction enzymes are composed of two subunits: Mod (for modification) and Res (for restriction). The Mod subunit has DNA methyltransferase activity, and the Mod–Res complex has restriction activity. When the restriction enzyme complex binds to an unmethylated site, it cleaves DNA through interaction with another restriction enzyme complex on the same DNA. This process is dependent on ATP hydrolysis.35 The cleavage mechanism is not yet clear, although diverse and sometimes mutually contradictory models have been proposed.36–413.4. Type IV systemsType IV systems contain a class of enzymes that cleave DNA only when the recognition site is methylated.27 In Escherichia coli, McrA, McrBC, and Mrr are enzymes in this class that show different restriction spectra.42 McrBC, the best characterized of this class, is described in detailed below (Section 9). Although McrA and Mrr are believed to be endonucleases, their DNA cleavage activities have not been observed in vitro.43–454. Mobility of restriction–modification systemsThe DNA methyltransferase genes frequently undergo horizontal transfer. The transfer of an epigenetic DNA methyltansferase gene can be the initial step of the genetic conflicts described in following sections (Sections 11–15).Many DNA methyltransferase genes of restriction–modification systems show signs of mobility by various criteria.24 Horizontal transfer between distantly related prokaryotes has been demonstrated by molecular evolutionary analyses. Restriction–modification systems are often found on mobile elements such as plasmids, bacteriophages, integrative conjugative elements, transposons, genomic islands, and integrons. Some restriction–modification systems appear to behave as a mobile unit without being linked to another mobile unit.46 Examination of the genomic neighbourhood of restriction–modification gene homologues and comparison with closely related genomes also provide evidence for their mobility and association with genome rearrangements. Restriction–modification systems can insert into an operon-like gene cluster, or they can insert into a genome with a long (~100 bp) target duplication. They can substitute for a genomic region, or transpose into a different genomic locus. They are sometimes linked to large chromosomal inversions.46Recently, our group conducted systematic genome comparisons and genome context analysis on fully sequenced prokaryotic genomes to detect restriction–modification-linked genome rearrangements.47 Restriction–modification genes were frequently found to be linked to mobility-related genes such as integrase and transposase homologues. Restriction–modification genes were found to be flanked by direct and inverted repeats at a significantly higher frequency than control genes. ‘Insertion accompanied by long target duplication' was observed for I, II, III, and IV restriction types. Several restriction–modification genes were found to be flanked by long, imperfect inverted repeats, just as transposase genes are in classical DNA transposons. Some of these had apparently inserted into a genome with a short target duplication,47 similar to DNA transposons.Some of the putative restriction–modification systems in the mobility-related regions are functional.48–50 A mobility-based search for novel restriction enzymes detected a previously uncharacterized family of DNA-interacting proteins.48,50,51 The mobility of McrBC is described in Section 13.As described in Section 5, Type II restriction–modification systems contribute to their own genetic stability and to the stability of genes linked to them. Their linkage to a mobile element would be mutually beneficial. Restriction–modification systems would stabilize the element, and the mobile element would contribute to spreading of the restriction–modification systems.The behaviour of Type II restriction–modification systems as mobile elements is further suggested by their amplification52 and involvement in genome rearrangements53 under laboratory conditions, as well as by their mutual competition54 and regulation of gene expression.46,55 Some restriction–modification systems have evolved regulatory systems to suppress their potential for host killing. When the system enters a new host, host cell killing is prevented by initial expression of the methyltransferase, with delayed expression of the restriction enzyme.55–61 This regulation can cause a conflict between two epigenetic systems that is similar to phage exclusion, which is described in Section 6.555. Host attack by Type II systems upon gene lossAs described above, epigenetic DNA methyltransferase genes often form a restriction–modification system in prokaryotes, and epigenetic conflicts are coupled to the behaviour of the restriction–modification systems.Some Type II restriction–modification systems cause chromosomal cleavage of their host cells when their genes are eliminated, for example, by a competitor genetic element (Fig. 1C, without competitor; Fig. 3A, with a competitor).52,53,62 When a restriction–modification system is stably maintained in the cell, the restriction enzyme does not cleave the genomic DNA because of protection through epigenetic methylation by the cognate methyltransferases. However, when the restriction–modification gene complex is lost from the cell, the concentration of the restriction and modification enzymes is decreased through cell division,63 resulting in under-methylated chromosomes.53 The remaining restriction enzyme molecules cleave the unmethylated recognition sequence and cause cell death. The net result is survival of cells that were not invaded by the competitor (Fig. 3A). This process is called ‘post-segregational killing' or ‘genetic addiction'.64 Similar host attack can take place after inactivation of the modification enzyme.65 Host killing forces cells to maintain their genes (or enzyme activity) and the epigenetic status conferred by the methyltransferase (Figs 1C and 3A). Host attack by Type II restriction–modification systems and by methyl-specific DNases (McrBC) in competition. (A) Type II systems. When a resident restriction–modification gene complex is replaced by a competitor genetic element, the modification enzyme level decrease exposes newly replicated chromosomal restriction sites to lethal cleavage by the remaining restriction enzymes. Intact genome copies survive in uninfected and unaltered neighbouring clonal cells. (B) McrBC. When a DNA methylation system enters a cell and begins methylating chromosomal recognition sites, McrBC senses the change and triggers cell death by chromosomal cleavage. The intact genome copies survive in uninfected and unaltered neighbouring clonal cells. From Fukuda et al.1Host attack by Type II restriction–modification systems and by methyl-specific DNases (McrBC) in competition. (A) Type II systems. When a resident restriction–modification gene complex is replaced by a competitor genetic element, the modification enzyme level decrease exposes newly replicated chromosomal restriction sites to lethal cleavage by the remaining restriction enzymes. Intact genome copies survive in uninfected and unaltered neighbouring clonal cells. (B) McrBC. When a DNA methylation system enters a cell and begins methylating chromosomal recognition sites, McrBC senses the change and triggers cell death by chromosomal cleavage. The intact genome copies survive in uninfected and unaltered neighbouring clonal cells. From Fukuda et al.1This cell death process may be a composite of host defence and suicide responses. Recent studies revealed a common pathway of stress-induced cell death in bacteria.66,67 Transcriptome analysis during post-segregational death programmed by a Type II restriction–modification system revealed its similarity to death caused by several antibiotics.68 Gene products that program bacterial cell death, such as the restriction enzymes discussed here, are likely to work in the upstream of the common cell death pathway. In other words, action of the death genes may depend on the common cell death pathway of the host.Although the pathway may facilitate host cell death, the repair and tolerance mechanisms work to facilitate survival. In general, chromosomal cleavage by cellular DNases is prevented in several ways: by inhibitor binding, compartmentalization, proteolysis, DNA modification, or DNA structure specificity. Indeed, host killing by restriction–modification systems after gene loss is not always detectable because hosts have apparently adapted various ways to counteract it. Recombination repair of chromosomal breakage can reduce the lethal effects of chromosome cleavage.69 Host killing by EcoRII restriction–modification system is suppressed by a solitary methyltransferase, Dcm, which recognizes the same sequence.70 These host defence systems against restriction–modification systems cannot, however, prevent host genome methylation and its potentially deleterious effects, which are the focus of the latter half of this review (Sections 11–15).Many Type II restriction enzymes show star activity or promiscuous activity on sequences other than their recognition sequence protected by cognate methylation.71 It is not known whether these lead to genome cleavage or cell death under some condition.6. Conflicts between two epigenetic systems (Type II restriction–modification systems)Restriction–modification systems are mobile genetic elements, as discussed above (Section 4), and Type II restriction–modification systems are in potential conflict with competitor restriction–modification systems encountering through their mobility. Type II systems can be also considered epigenetic systems because their action is mediated by epigenetic DNA methylation. In this section, we describe conflicts involving Type II restriction–modification systems, which can be considered conflicts between epigenetic systems.One restriction–modification system can block the post-segregational killing potential of another restriction–modification system with the same recognition sequence (Fig. 1C). When two Type II restriction–modification systems carrying a methyltransferase with the same sequence specificity are present in the same cell, interference between the two systems affects post-segregational killing. Loss of one restriction–modification gene complex does not lead to cell killing, because the methyltransferase of the other restriction–modification protects the genomic recognition sequences from attack by the restriction enzyme of the first restriction–modification. This prediction was verified experimentally.54 This within-host competition for recognition sequences may have driven the evolution of the individual specificity and the collective diversity in target sequence recognition by restriction–modification systems. Such incompatibility, or competition for specific sequences along the genome, would result in specialization of each of these selfish units to each of these diverse sequences. This may represent an example of ‘competitive exclusion' in biological evolution, which drives adaptation of each of many species to one of many small ecological niches in an exclusive way. We imagine that the ecological niche of an RM system is the recognition sequence.54We also analyzed intrahost competition between two RM gene complexes when the recognition sequence of one was included in that of the other. When the EcoRII gene complex, recognizing 5'-CCWGG (W = A and T), is lost from the host, the SsoII gene complex, which recognizes 5'-CCNGG (N = A, T, G, and C), will prevent host death by protecting 5'-CCWGG sites on the chromosome. However, when the SsoII (CCNGG) gene complex is lost, the EcoRII (CCWGG) gene complex will be unable to prevent host death through attack by SsoII on 5'-CCSGG (S = C and G) sites. These predictions were verified in our experiments.72Through this type of conflict, a toxic restriction–modification system may be replaced by a less toxic restriction–modification system with the same sequence specificity, or even by a solitary methyltransferase lacking a restriction enzyme gene. This explains why the chromosomes of E. coli and related bacteria encode Dcm, a solitary methyltransferase that protects the genome from attack by the EcoRII restriction–modification system found on plasmids. This effect is called molecular vaccination.70 In these cases, a conflict between two epigenetic systems inhibits host cell death. In the following case, a conflict between two epigenetic systems (e.g. restriction–modification systems) leads to cell death, similar to phage exclusion or post-segregational killing.When a Type II restriction–modification system establishes itself in a new host, it first expresses the modification gene to protect recognition sequences in the genome and prevent cell killing, before expressing the restriction gene. Here, the accumulation of a regulatory protein—the modification enzyme itself or a C regulatory protein—leads to the expression of the restriction enzyme. When a resident restriction–modification system has the same specificity in the establishment-regulating mechanism, the regulatory protein of the resident restriction–modification system that induces restriction enzyme expression may act on the invading restriction–modification system. This forces the invading restriction–modification system into the premature expression of the restriction enzyme gene in the absence of prior expression of the modification enzyme gene. This kills the host, aborting the establishment of the incoming restriction–modification system. The overall effect is similar to phage exclusion (Fig. 6) or post-segregational killing with a competitor genetic element (Fig. 3). This predicted model has been experimentally verified55 and termed super-infection exclusion or apoptotic mutual exclusion. This mutual competition between restriction–modification systems may have driven the evolution of specificity in the mechanisms for regulation of establishment.7. Genomic restriction attack following loss of DNA methylation through DNA damage repairIn addition to the loss of epigenetic systems (Sections 5 and 6), epigenetic DNA methylation may be decreased by DNA damaging agents through the DNA metabolism processes of replication, recombination, and repair. This is supported by many studies on restriction alleviation of Type I RMs.Restriction alleviation is the phenotypic decrease in restriction activity on invading DNA that can be induced by DNA damaging agents or occurs constitutively in some bacterial mutants. The underlying mechanism varies by a restriction enzyme subtype.73–76 Evidence suggests that restriction alleviation is a mechanism for protecting chromosomes from restriction at a newly generated replication fork that produces unmethylated restriction sites.77 Indeed, chromosome breakage leading to cell death is observed when the restriction alleviation effect is lost for EcoKI75,78 and EcoR124I79 (Table 1). Thus, restriction alleviation can be regarded as an indirect sign of a decrease in epigenetic methylation.80The molecular mechanisms that lead to loss of EcoKI methylation by ultraviolet light have been suggested based on its dependence on nucleotide excision repair function and on the primosome assembly activity of the PriA protein.80 DNA double-strand breakage may occur through replication progression on a single-stranded DNA gap generated by nucleotide excision repair. The double-stranded DNA end will be subject to RecBCD processing, followed by homologous pairing and D-loop formation by RecA, and establishment of a new replication fork by a primosome.80 Through this process, new DNA strands can pair and form unmethylated recognition sites.80Base-substitution mutation represents another route for the loss of epigenetic methylation. The base analogue 2-aminopurine (2-AP) can be incorporated into DNA strands, forming a mismatched base pair that causes a T–A transition after two rounds of replication.78 This mutagenesis generates additional unmethylated recognition sequences for some restriction–modification systems with a methyltransferase protecting DNA with an m6A methylation. In fact, when 2-AP is added to cultures, the EcoKI restriction enzyme cleaves the bacterial chromosome in vivo, causing cell death if the restriction alleviation mechanism is absent.78 Similarly, EcoR124I, from a Type I restriction–modification system, and EcoRI, from a Type II restriction–modification system, cause cell death, depending on their restriction activity, under these conditions (Table 1).75The lethal effect of mitomycin C, a DNA cross-linker, is enhanced by EcoRI restriction–modification.81 A possible explanation is that DNA crossl-ink repair removes DNA methylation at the restriction sites (Table 1). Other observations indirectly suggest that loss of epigenetic methylation can occur in certain mutants with replication fork crowding, specifically dam, topA, rnhA, and recG for EcoKI; rnhA and recG for EcoR124I.74,79,82,83 Thus, DNA damage repair processes and genome instability can cause loss of epigenetic methylation, which is detected by the activity of restriction–modification systems.8. Cleavage of DNA replication forks by Type I restriction enzymesAs discussed above, loss of epigenetic DNA methylation is often coupled to DNA replication, which suggests that chromosomal DNA cleavage by restriction enzymes may be related to DNA replication. Association of DNA replication and Type I restriction by EcoKI is observed in phage restriction.84,85 Direct interaction between the M subunit of EcoKI and DnaB, a central component of the DNA replication machinery, was reported in a large-scale E. coli protein–protein interaction analysis.86Recently, we demonstrated that the Type I restriction enzyme EcoR124I cleaves model replication forks at their branch point in vitro.33 Cleavage was dependent on the presence of a recognition sequence on one of the arms and was inhibited by its hemi-methylation. The enzyme cleaves the arm carrying the recognition sequence, but does not cleave the arm lacking the recognition sequence. The recognition sequence must be a long distance (300 bp) from the branch for efficient cleavage. These results are consistent with a reaction mechanism in which the enzyme binds to DNA at the recognition sequence and starts tracking along the DNA. It cleaves DNA when it encounters a branch point (Fig. 2B).Cleavage at a replication fork to remove a branch provides an explanation for the association of DNA replication and restriction,84 and the recombination repair of restriction damage observed after a single infection by a phage genome.85 The restriction enzyme would recognize a site on a daughter chromosome and track along the DNA until it reaches a moving replication fork. At the fork, the enzyme cleaves one branch, leaving replicated and broken daughter chromosomes with a long overlap sufficient in some cases for repair by homologous recombination.This fork cleavage may take place on chromosomal DNA under the conditions of extra replication initiation described above. From an exposed (unmethylated) recognition sequence, the restriction enzyme would track on the DNA. If the fork is moving forward during replication, DNA breakage might not occur. However, if the enzyme meets an arrested replication fork, breakage would cleave off one arm (Fig. 2B), possibly leading to cell death or to another round of repair through recombination and replication. Elimination of a cell with unstable, damaged DNA would lead to maintenance of intact genomes, which is a recurrent theme of this review. The race between the replication fork and the restriction enzyme would help a cell to collect multiple types of information related to the life or death decision.In brief, we hypothesize that a Type I restriction–modification may monitor the epigenetic DNA methylation level together with the DNA replication machinery. This restriction–modification system maintains a proper methylation level by eliminating cells with unusual levels through DNA replication fork cleavage and complements systems that repair damaged genomes. This hypothesis explains the unusual enzymatic activity of Type I restriction endonucleases, which translocate along the DNA before cleaving it. This process may balance death and revival, depending on at least two criteria: the level of epigenetic methylation and a replication condition that is either moving or stalled.The other DNA-tracking restriction enzymes, Type III and Type IV, might have some interaction with a replication fork. A fraction of Type III restriction cleavage of incoming phage DNA likely takes place after passage of the replication fork in vivo.85 However, interaction of Type III and IV enzymes with a branched DNA could be different from that of the Type I enzymes, because their interaction with roadblocks on DNA are different from that of Type I enzymes.36,87–90In contrast to cell death in response to a decrease in genome DNA methylation, we discuss cell death in response to its increase in the latter half of this review.9. McrBC, a methyl-specific DNA endonuclease (Type IV restriction enzyme)McrBC, a methyl-specific DNA endonuclease (Type IV restriction enzyme) in E. coli, was first recognized for its restriction of some bacteriophages (see next section). McrBC is encoded by two genes, mcrB (rglB) and mcrC.91–94 The mcrB gene encodes two different protein forms, McrBL (a larger, full-length form) and McrBS (a smaller form). These proteins share the same amino acid sequence except for 161 amino acids at the N-terminus that are missing in McrBS.93,95–98 McrBL and McrC are sufficient for methyl-DNA cleavage activity,99 and McrBS is involved in activity modulation.100,101McrBL is composed of two functional domains. The N-terminal domain specifically binds to a methylated recognition site.102 The C-terminal domain has GTPase activity and includes three GTP-binding motifs.103 McrC is the endonuclease subunit with a PD-(D/E)×K motif.104,105 This is the most abundant motif in Type II restriction enzymes characterized thus far and is often found in DNA repair and recombination-related enzymes.28The recognition sequence of E. coli McrBC is composed of two sites, in the form of RmC N40-2000 RmC (where R is A or G).99,106 DNA double-strand cleavage occurs between the two sites preferably at ~30 bp inward from one of the sites (Fig. 4A). Methylation does not need to be on the same DNA strand, so the two sites do not need to be in a particular orientation.99 Similar to Type I restriction enzymes, efficient cleavage by the enzyme requires two recognition sites, except in the case of a circular DNA substrate with a single recognition site.90,99 McrBC binds to the specific recognition site RmC through the N-terminal DNA-binding domain of McrBL.102 Double-stranded DNA cleavage occurs through interaction of two McrBC complexes on the DNA.99 The interaction is facilitated through translocation of the enzyme complexes along the DNA rather than through DNA looping.90 GTP and Mg2+ are required cofactors for the cleavage reaction.99Action of McrBC, a methyl-specific DNase. (A) Reaction in vitro. McrBC recognizes RmC (R = A or G) and cleaves the DNA, usually near a recognition site. Cleavage requires two recognition sites about 40–2000 bp (adapted from Raleigh91). (B) Restriction in vivo. McrBC strongly restricts T-even phages whose DNA carries hydroxymethyl C in place of C. However, it only weakly restricts plasmids and phages whose DNA has been methylated by a modification enzyme.Action of McrBC, a methyl-specific DNase. (A) Reaction in vitro.

However, it only weakly restricts plasmids and phages whose DNA has been methylated by a modification enzyme.Comparison of intragenomic paralogues revealed possible diversification in sequence recognition in McrBC homologues.1 Some genomes, such as the Deinococcus radiodurans R1 genome, contain two mcrBC homologues: one may be on a plasmid whereas the other on the chromosome.1 Alignments of intragenomic McrB homologue pairs revealed amino acid sequence divergence in the N-terminal region that is involved in DNA binding,102 suggesting evolutionary shifts in DNA sequence specificity.1 This parallels the diversity in sequence recognition in Type II restriction and modification enzymes.10. Biological role of McrBCThe biological significance of McrBC was first recognized in the restriction of invading bacteriophage genomes carrying hydroxymethylcytosine instead of cytosine (Fig. 4B).107,108 Bacteriophages carrying this unusual base are rare.109,110 McrBC may also protect cells against infection by methylated DNAs, such as viral genomes and plasmids, by directly cleaving invading DNA. However, such methylated DNAs are not usually strongly restricted by McrBC (Fig. 4B).1,42,111 This suggests that defence against invading methylated DNA through direct attack may not be the primary role of McrBC.Therefore, similar to Type II and I restriction–modification systems (see above), we hypothesized that McrBC may mediate a suicidal response to epigenetic DNA methylation and may maintain the epigenomic status. The behaviour of McrBC upon DNA methyltransferase invasion might be similar to that of Type II restriction–modification, as illustrated in Fig. 3B. When such a methylation system enters the cell (or becomes activated) and begins to methylate the host genome, McrBC would sense these epigenetic changes and trigger cell death through chromosomal cleavage. Intact (unmethylated) genomes with mcrBC genes would survive in neighbouring clonal cells,1 and the host killing could also contribute to an increase in their gene frequency.Recently, we demonstrated that McrBC-mediated cell death through cleavage of methylated chromosomes occurs upon entry or induction of a methyltransferase gene and aborts its establishment or activation.1 Our genome informatics analysis supported the hypothesis that, during evolution, McrBC has behaved as a mobile element.1 Therefore, maintenance of McrBC enzymes cannot be explained only by the restriction of bacteriophages containing hydroxymethylcytosine. These are discussed further in the following sections.11. McrBC-mediated host cell killing through chromosomal cleavage upon genome methylationSeveral reports found that phages or plasmids carrying a DNA methyltransferase gene cannot be propagated in an mcrBC+ strain of E. coli (Fig. 4B).112 Whether the block to propagation is due to repeated methylation of the introduced DNA and subsequent cleavage112 or to host genome methylation and its cleavage has not been addressed. Fukuda et al.1 demonstrated that McrBC inhibits establishment of the gene for the DNA methyltransferase PvuII (M.PvuII, CAGm4CTG) in E. coli. Establishment of a plasmid carrying this gene but lacking its recognition sequence was inhibited. This result suggests that the presence of methylated sites on the transferred DNA is not required for McrBC-dependent inhibition,1 favouring the latter possibility that host genome cleavage accompanied by cell death inhibits the establishment of the methyltransferase gene.The underlying mechanism of the cell death was revealed by observing chromosomal DNA of E. coli infected with lambda phage carrying the M.PvuII gene.1 Accumulation of huge linear DNAs corresponding to broken chromosomes, and of smaller DNAs of variable size was observed, which likely reflected chromosome degradation. mcrBC-dependence strongly suggested that M.PvuII-mediated chromosomal methylation triggered chromosomal cleavage by McrBC, followed by chromosomal degradation. This, in turn, indicates that inhibition of the phage multiplication (restriction) is caused by host death.1 This kind of conflict between DNA methyltransferase genes carried by bacteriophages and methyl-specific restriction enzymes are biologically relevant because DNA methyltransferase genes are often found in bacteriophage genomes.25,113–116 The resolution by cell death may contribute to increase in the frequency of the restriction gene as described in Section 14.Induction of the M.PvuII in cells also led to chromosomal methylation followed by McrBC-mediated cleavage and cell death. Furthermore, a close correlation was seen between methylation, cleavage, and death. By mutant analysis, the SOS response and RecA/RecBCD-mediated DNA recombination and repair were found to affect cell death or survival upon McrBC activation on the methylated genome. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that chromosomal methylation leads to McrBC-mediated lethal cleavage.In addition to M.PvuII, M.SinI (GGWm5CC) and M.MspI (m5CCGG) causes McrBC-dependent cell death, whereas M.SsoII (Cm5CNGG) does not. These results are consistent with the RmC sequence specificity of McrBC observed in vitro.99 McrBC has the potential to act as a defence system against many DNA methyltransferases with an appropriate specificity. Such conflicts between McrBC and invading epigenetic DNA methylation systems may have driven diversification of sequence recognition by the methyltransferases and by the McrBC family (see above and below), just as competition between Type II restriction–modification systems may have driven diversification of their sequence recognition (Section 6).5412. Linkage of McrBC with DNA methyltransferase genes defines epigenomic statusEpigenetic DNA methylation has crucial roles in cell-cycle regulation, transcriptional regulation, transposition of mobile elements, and host-pathogen interaction, as discussed above. Methyl-DNA-specific DNases could contribute to maintenance of specific epigenomic states by inhibiting establishment of invading epigenetic DNA methylation systems (or by inhibiting their expression) through cell death (Fig. 5). This is comparable to maintenance of an epigenome status by Type II restriction–modification systems through cell killing. Cooperation in epigenome maintenance between McrBC and a DNA methyltransferase. A methyltransferase gene with DNA methylation specificity not subject to McrBC (filled circle) establishes itself in mcrBC+ cells and confers an epigenome state.

Cells with the intact epigenome survive and increase their frequency.

Filled circle with a bar, DNA methylation by DNA methyltransferase A; open circle with a bar, DNA methylation by B.The mcrBC homologues are frequently linked to DNA methyltransferase genes,1,47 as first noted for E. coli.117 The methyltransferase is frequently from a Type I restriction–modification system, and less often from a Type IIG restriction–modification system. The linked methyltransferase is expected to have a specificity that does not create a target for the McrBC nuclease. This implies that the McrBC will eliminate methyltransferases with specificity different from its linked methyltransferase. The base specificity of Type I modification enzymes, i.e. m6A methylation as opposed to m4C and m5C of McrBC, is consistent with this hypothesis. The mcrBC genes and linked methyltransferase genes can be regarded as units that force an epigenome status in competition with other, invading epigenetic DNA methylation systems (Fig. 5). Although a linked epigenetic DNA methylation system provides an epigenomic methylation, establishment of another invading epigenetic DNA methylation system is inhibited by McrBC-mediated cell killing. McrBC plays the role of a judge forcing maintenance of an epigenomic order by eliminating cells attracted by another epigenomic order (Fig. 5).Considering the crucial roles of epigenetic DNA methylation in biology, systems to maintain epigenome integrity by cell death are expected to be broadly conserved. Failure of the maintenance mechanism might be related to the generation and adaptation of cancer cells, in which epigenomic DNA methylation is altered. For example, genome-wide methylome analysis revealed different DNA methylation patterns in colon cancer cells.118,119 Related to this, cell death upon exogenous expression of methyltransferases has been reported in eukaryotes. Expression of mouse DNA methyltransferases induces lethality in a fly and a frog (Table 1).2,3 The underlying mechanisms that trigger cell death, and the biological significance of the lethality of these heterologous systems remain unclear.13. Evolutionary genomics of McrBC family suggesting their evolution as mobile elementsAs described above, McrBC restricts infection of phages carrying hydroxymethylcytosine and maintains epigenomes through cell death upon entry or activation of DNA methyltransferase genes.1,107,108 The question of the factors that have been important in increasing the frequency of mcrBC genes was answered through evolutionary genomics analysis.1If McrBC homologues show a very narrow distribution, and if this correlates with the distribution of phages with hydroxymethylcytosine, the phage defence hypothesis might be favoured as an explanation for the selective advantage conferred by McrBC. However, comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of McrBC homologues revealed the opposite that they are widely distributed in Bacteria and Archaea.1Phylogenetic trees of the McrB and McrC homologues showed very similar topologies, suggesting strong co-evolution of these two proteins. Detailed analysis of these trees revealed frequent horizontal transfer of mcrBC genes between distantly related genomes and frequent loss from a higher-order taxonomic group. Comparing the frequency of pentanucleotide ‘words' within mcrBC genes with the average word frequency of the entire genome suggested that roughly one-third of mcrBC genes showed a significant likelihood of recent horizontal gene transfer from a distantly related group.1 This argues against the hypothesis that they are conserved only because of their utility for defence against limited phages or other parasites and favours the hypothesis that they behave as selfish (host-killing) mobile elements. The possibility that the host killing could increase their genetic frequency is discussed in Section 14.Another feature revealed by the phylogenetic trees is the presence of two diverged subfamilies of McrBC-like systems, one comprising the known McrBCs and the other comprising solely uncharacterized homologues with the McrC-like component defined as the uncharacterized protein family DUF524. Members of these two subfamilies show complementary phylogenetic distribution, which probably reflects some degree of mutual incompatibility.McrBC family members appear to be quite divergent in sequence. Such diversity might be accompanied by diversity in their target recognition. Indeed, some members of one McrBC subfamily have been shown to be Type II-like, because they cleave a specific sequence when unmethylated.120 The presence of two mcrB paralogues that have diverged in the N-terminus in one genome (see above) is consistent with their divergence in sequence recognition.Genomic neighbourhood analysis revealed that mcrBC genes are frequently linked to homologues of integrase and transposase genes. Several mcrBC homologues clearly occur as an insert into a restriction modification gene complex, which results in their linkage, as discussed above. In addition, several McrBC-like systems have been found on plasmids. These findings also indicate potential mobility of the mcrBC unit.114. Genetic drive as a consequence of genetic conflicts and cell deathWe reviewed several forms of cell death after intragenomic conflicts in which an epigenetic system was involved. McrBC restricts invading epigenetic systems with some specificity through host killing. By this mechanism, it defines an epigenetic status in cooperation with a compatible DNA methyltransferase. The significance of these systems on epigenome integrity is discussed above (Section 12). In addition to these biological roles, the mutually exclusive interaction between genes that program cell death (mcrBC) and an invading methyltransferase gene may give host cells an advantage in defence against viral infection when the virus carries a methyltransferase gene. This advantage would increase the frequency of the mcrBC genes. Such an effect is referred to as ‘genetic drive’.121Defence against invasion of genetic elements through cell death has been well studied for multicellular eukaryotic cells such as virus-infected mammalian and plant cells.122 Generally, virus genome multiplication and virus particle production are dependent on the host biosynthesis machinery. Progeny virus particles infect other cells (Fig. 6A), so death of an infected cell aborts virus multiplication, preventing secondary infection of neighbouring cells (Fig. 6B). Similar processes against virus infection for bacteria are ‘phage exclusion’ or ‘phage abortion’ (Fig. 6B).123 The underlying molecular mechanisms have been determined in detail in some cases. For example, the prr gene in some E. coli strains senses bacteriophage T4 infection and triggers cell death by cleaving host tRNALys.124 This relationship between host and virus is analogous to an mcrBC+ cell and a phage carrying a DNA methyltransferase gene (Figs 3B and 6B). Defence against viral infection through cell death. (A) Virus infection followed by secondary infection. The virus produces progeny that infect sibling cells. (B) Virus infection to cells that have a gene programming cell death upon the infection. The virus cannot produce progeny. Sibling cells are not infected and survive, together with the death gene.Defence against viral infection through cell death. (A) Virus infection followed by secondary infection. The virus produces progeny that infect sibling cells. (B) Virus infection to cells that have a gene programming cell death upon the infection. The virus cannot produce progeny. Sibling cells are not infected and survive, together with the death gene.Genes that program the death of their host bacterial cell are expected to increase in frequency because of the abortive effect on viral multiplication. The gene programming suicide of infected cells would survive in uninfected cells because of the induction of death in infected cells. The driving effect of the death gene would be clear when the frequency of cells carrying the death gene is compared with the competitor cells without the death gene after viral infection. This hypothesis needs experimental testing and mathematical justification using evolutionary game theory.For genes that program host killing upon loss, such as Type II restriction–modification systems (Fig. 3A, Section 5), mathematical justification in the domain of evolutionary game theory has shown that the gene complex that programs cell death increases its frequency in the presence of a competitive genetic element.125 However, an earlier investigation did not demonstrate their spread.126 This analysis used a model lacking spatial structure, such as a well-mixed liquid culture, where every cell can potentially interact with every other cell. Our group demonstrated that these genes can increase in frequency from near zero, if a spatial structure is present that allows a cell to preferentially interact with its neighbours.125 Their increase also depended on the relative cost of the host-killing gene (and its competitor) on the host and on their rate of horizontal transfer.In phage exclusion (Fig. 6) and post-segregational killing (Fig. 3A), the conflict between different genetic elements within a genome leads to cell death. In the former, the conflict is phage genome vs. death gene, whereas in the latter, it is the invading competitor genetic element versus the death gene. These conflicts are often called ‘intragenomic conflicts’, although ‘genetic conflicts' may be more appropriate in many prokaryotic cases, where the genes frequently move between genomes.15. Other cases suggesting conflicts involving epigenetic systemsOther cases of a mutually exclusive relationship between epigenetic systems involving DNases have been reported. An earlier observation with Mrr, another Type IV restriction enzyme, can be interpreted as a similar conflict with a DNA methyltransferase gene leading to lethal chromosome cleavage (Table 1).127 Mrr+ cells show SOS induction and poor growth in the presence of the M.HhaII methyltransferase. Mrr weakly restricts phage lambda that has been modified by M.HhaII. However, infection of a phage lambda carrying the mrr gene to a cell with the m.hhaII gene is severely restricted. These results suggest that Mrr also causes cell death in the presence of an incompatible methyltransferase through chromosomal cleavage, although evidence for this cleavage was not reported. Mrr also induces cell death under high-pressure stress, possibly through chromosomal breakage,128 although whether epigenetic DNA methylation is involved is not known. The mrr gene forms a cassette with mcrBC and the EcoKI (Type I) restriction–modification system in the E. coli genome, suggesting potential cooperation between these elements to define an epigenome status (Section 12, Fig. 5).1 This linkage is also observed in Xanthomonas, where an mrr homologue is linked with a Type I restriction–modification system.47A unique family of Mrr-like restriction endonucleases was identified recently.129 One of its members, MspJI, recognizes 5'-mCNNR (R = G/A). Besides 5-methylcytosine, MspJI also recognizes 5-hydroxymethylcytosine but is blocked by 5-glucosylhydroxymethylcytosine. Several other close homologues of MspJI show similar modification-dependent endonuclease activity and display substrate preferences different from MspJI. They may have similar conflict with methyltransferase genes.McrA, another Type IV restriction enzyme, restricts uptake of DNAs with m5C modifications and is mutually exclusive with M.HpaII.130 Whether this exclusion occurs through chromosomal cleavage and is accompanied by cell death, as for McrBC, is not known. An mcrA homologue of Burkholderia sp. 383 appears to have inserted with no other linked genes, with a long target duplication similar to other Type I, II, and III restriction systems.47 In E. coli, the mcrA gene is on the prophage element e14.92 These observations indicate the potential mobility of mcrA genes, with or without other mobile elements.The Type IV restriction enzyme GmrSD was found in an E. coli strain and it targets glycosylated hydroxymethylcytosine.131 Cytosine-containing phage are sensitive to Type II restriction enzymes. Hydroxymethyl-cytosine-containing phage are resistant to Type II restriction enzymes but sensitive to McrBC.132 Glycosylated hydroxymethyl-cytosine-containing phage are resistant to McrBC but sensitive to GmrSD.131 GmrSD is inhibited by an internal protein coded by some of the phage.131 These suggest an ever-lasting evolutionary arms race between the bacteria and the phage.Bacteriophage Mu DNA contains unusual deoxynucleoside, alpha-N-(9-ß-d-2'-deoxyribofuranosylpurin-6-yl)glycinamide, specified by the mom gene, which make it resistant to several Type II restriction enzymes and a Type III enzyme.133The methyl-DNA-specific restriction enzyme DpnI, and the Type II restriction enzyme DpnII have complementary endonuclease activities: DpnI cleaves the modified DNA sequence 5'-Gm6ATC, whereas DpnII cleaves the same recognition sequence only when it is not methylated.134,135 DpnII forms a restriction–modification system with two methyltransferase genes that provide 5'-Gm6ATC modification. Although these complementary endonucleases were isolated from the same Streptococcus pneumoniae species, they do not co-exist in the same genome, probably because of their endonuclease activities.136 They are located at the same locus and share flanking sequence homology,136 suggesting that these restriction cassettes exchange with each other and establish two distinct epigenetic states.136DpnI is classified as Type IIM restriction enzyme, which targets specific methylated sequence. BisI, BlsI, GluI, and GlaI also belong to this class and cleave specific DNA sequence with 5-methylcytosine.137 BisI, BlsI, and GluI are isoschizomers and hydrolyze the DNA sequence 5'-GCNGC, which is methylated in different ways. GlaI cleaves the DNA sequence 5'-GCGC if there are two, three, or four 5-methylcytosines. In some phage DNAs, there is a 5-methylcytosine in the nucleotide sequence 5'-GmCGC, a substrate for GlaI, but GlaI displays minimal activity in its cleavage. Therefore, their role in a bacterial cell has remained unclear. Their role may be in conflict with specific methyltransferase genes by cleaving methylated genomic DNA at numerous sites to cell death.Conflicts that do not cause cell death between restriction–modification systems and anti-restriction systems encoded by bacteriophages and plasmids have also been reported.138 These systems inhibit Type I restriction through different mechanisms, and some can affect methylation activity. For example, Ocr from phage T7 mimics DNA and antagonizes the methyltransferase complex, inhibiting the restriction and modification activities.139,140 Phage T3 encodes an enzyme that degrades S-adenosylmethionine, an essential cofactor for Type I restriction and modification.141 Ral of phage lambda and Lar of the Rac prophage protect infecting DNA from Type I restriction by enhancing methyltransferase activity.142,143 Proteins that can regulate DNA methyltransferase activity represent another factor that can affect epigenome status.To our knowledge, genetic or epigenetic conflicts specific to Type III restriction–modification systems have not been published so far. However, conflicts described for the other types of restriction systems in this review article might be applicable to this family.Recently, a novel type of host-specific restriction–modification systems that do not employ methylation was found. Phosphorothioation of DNA by products of specific gene clusters protects DNA against a DNase controlled by the same gene cluster.144,145 Similar or homologous systems are found in many bacteria, but their biological significance remains unclear. No DNases specific to the S-modification have been reported so far.16. Conclusion and perspectiveWe have reviewed conflicts between different genetic and epigenetic elements within a genome, focusing on prokarytotic DNases that may cause cell death through chromosomal cleavage. The paradigm we propose is that restriction systems enforce an epigenomic status through cell death. Type II restriction–modification systems cause cell death when methylation is decreased. Host killing by Type I restriction enzymes occurs also when the epigenome status is disturbed by DNA damage and repair under several conditions. Entry or activation of an epigenetic DNA methylation system also causes cell death through chromosomal breakage by methyl-DNA-specific DNases that lead to elimination of cells with an altered epigenome. This process maintains the epigenetic status of the cells, sometimes in cooperation with a linked DNA methyltransferase.For the death gene, host killing appears to be a strategy that maintains or increases their frequency. For the genome, or a society composed of genes, stimulating cell death upon entry or activation of potentially hazardous genetic or epigenetic systems may be more advantageous than accepting them. The conflicts with them might otherwise decrease fitness, especially when brought about by novel invading genetic or epigenetic elements that have not undergone evolutionary selection in the new environment. Establishment of such a hazardous system in one cell might let it spread in the clonal cell population (Fig. 6A). In this case, the active cell death pathway would be selected. For the genome society, these cell deaths represent a form of resolution of intra-genomic conflicts.These restriction systems provide strong evidence for the presence of conflicts between epigenetic systems. They will serve as simple model systems for gaining insight into the complex but fascinating epigenetic interactions between genes and genomes.FundingThis work was supported by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research from Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS), NEDO, the global COE program ‘Genome Information Big Bang’ from Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT) to I.K. and the Sasakawa Scientific Research Grant from The Japan Science Society to K.I.We thank Dr Katsumi Isono for the invitation to write this review article."

IntroductionOne of the primary areas of investigation in comparative genomics is the identification and characterization of homologous regions in closely related genomes. The subjects of these investigations range in scale from multi-megabase syntenic regions covering most of a chromosome to small loci containing just a few genes. Studying the syntenic regions can uncover large-scale events in the evolutionary history of a genome, such as segmental duplications or polyploidization; however, these regions in different species can differ significantly. Such variation results from a large number of genomic alterations occurring over time while maintaining sufficient collinearity to define regions of synteny. On the other hand, comparative analysis of small loci can produce detailed evolutionary histories of groups of neighboring genes and provide examples of the types of changes possible in a genome. However, it is difficult to expand these studies to a genome-wide scale due to the number of genes involved and the problem of generalizing these types of changes to allow their quantification.In this study, we conduct an intermediate form of comparative analysis. By examining pairs of adjacent genes, we can detect changes at the level of single genes and still observe relationships between genes. Owing to the simplicity and small scale of our subjects, all changes can be assigned to a manageable number of classes, thereby producing results that are easily interpreted in genome-wide studies of this type. Our previous investigation compared gene pairs1 in three plant species (rice, Arabidopsis, and Populus) which diverged 130–200 million years ago (mya).2–4 This study, on the other hand, compares four members of the Poaceae family (rice, sorghum, maize, and Brachypodium) whose last common ancestor dates to 50–70 mya.2,5 Genomes of the four grass species used in this study have been sequenced.6–9 The shorter evolutionary distances separating these species simplifies the interpretation of any observed genomic rearrangements, due to the reduced probability of multiple independent events affecting the same region. However, many small rearrangements have been identified in earlier comparative studies of Poaceae genomes,10,11 providing sufficient variation among genomes to identify any trends regarding selection for or against disruption of ancestral gene pairs. It has been hypothesized that gene order is not entirely random, but rather is connected to gene function and regulation,12 and that genomic rearrangements can alter the function of genes or even lead to the creation of new gene families. Thus, gene order possibly contributes to phenotypic differences between species, even when individual genes are conserved.13We previously reported1 that their strand-wise arrangement has a significant influence on many characteristics of gene pairs. For this study, we classified all pairs of adjacent genes as convergent (<U+2192> <U+2190>), divergent (<U+2190> <U+2192>), or tandem (<U+2192> <U+2192> or <U+2190> <U+2190>), we identified homologous genes in other species and determined the status of each pair (conserved, inverted, moved, or missing homologs). We also estimated the effect of correlated expression on these types of gene-pair rearrangements. To gain an understanding of the evolutionary timing of the rearrangements we observed, a putative evolutionary history was created for each gene pair, based on its status in each of the four species. Overall, this study provides an overview of the frequencies and types of genomic rearrangements within a subset of the Poaceae, as well as many other properties of the genomes being studied.2. Materials and methods2.1. Identification of gene pairsGenome sequence and annotation data were downloaded for rice (Oryza sativa subsp. japonica; http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu, MSU rice pseudomolecules release 6), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor; http://www.phytozome.net/sorghum, sequence assembly v1.0, gene set v1.4), maize (Zea mays; http://www.maizesequence.org, release 3a.50), and Brachypodium (Brachypodium distachyon; http://www.brachypodium.org, 8X coverage release). A second set of rice sequence and annotation data was obtained from the Rice Annotation Project (RAP; http://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/, sequence build 5) for comparison with the MSU rice gene set and was processed and analyzed using the same methods as the MSU rice and sorghum gene sets. Annotated genes in the rice and sorghum genomes were sorted by chromosome and position and then, based on which strand the gene is transcribed from, all pairs of adjacent genes were classified as either convergent (<U+2192> <U+2190>), divergent (<U+2190> <U+2192>), or tandem (<U+2192> <U+2192> or <U+2190> <U+2190>) pairs. Pairs containing hypothetical- or transposon-related genes, as determined by annotation and RepeatMasker (www.repeatmasker.org; 50% or greater transposon content of unspliced sequence), were excluded from all analyses.2.2. Comparative sequence analysisThe coding region sequences of all rice and sorghum gene pairs were aligned with the genome assemblies of the other three species using BLASTN. For each gene, individual hits (presumably corresponding to single exons) with e-values of 0.00001 or less were grouped with other nearby hits on the same strand and contig to produce a putative homolog. The locations of each pair's homologs were then used to determine the pair's status in that species. Pairs were considered ‘conserved' if both genes had homologs in the original strand-wise arrangement (convergent, divergent, or tandem) within 50 kb of each other and had no other genes inserted between them. Fifty kilobases were chosen to allow for insertions of repetitive DNA such as nested retrotransposons. ‘Inverted' pairs also possessed homologs within the cutoff distance, but had different strand-wise arrangements than the original pair. Pairs were considered ‘rearranged' if homologs for both genes were found but were >50 kb apart, separated by other genes, or located on different contigs.  Those pairs in which one or both genes were missing homologs in a given species were also identified. In addition to 50 kb, genes residing within 20 and 75 kb were used to perform the above analysis.2.3. Expression analysisTwo types of quantitative expression data were collected for all rice genes (MSU data): microarray and massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS). First, MPSS14 data were downloaded from the Rice MPSS Database (http://mpss.udel.edu/rice/). Only 17-bp signatures of classes 1, 2, 5, and 7 that mapped to a single gene were used, and abundance values <5 were ignored as background interference. When multiple signatures had significant abundance values in the same library, their average abundance was used. Correlated expression between genes in convergent, divergent, and tandem pairs was examined by calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient using each gene's average abundance values across 72 libraries.Microarray data were downloaded from the Yale rice project (http://bioinformatics.med.yale.edu/rc/overview.jspx) for a total of 446 hybridizations. Correlated expression was again tested with the Pearson correlation coefficient, this time pairing data points for each gene from the same hybridization and channel, where data were available for both genes for that hybridization and channel.Correlation coefficients were calculated separately for each expression data type. Thus, if expression data were present for both genes in both sets, a gene pair would have both an MPSS-derived and microarray-derived correlation coefficient. For those pairs with both coefficients, the pair was considered strongly correlated if at least one was greater than the cut-off value.The fraction of strongly correlated gene pairs falling into each of the four categories (conserved, inverted, rearranged, or missing homologs) was then compared with the fractions of uncorrelated or weakly correlated pairs in those same categories. The statistical significance of their differences was evaluated using the normal approximation of the binomial test, with a significance level of P < 0.05 (Z > 1.6449). Two definitions of ‘strong' correlation were used: the first one using a correlation coefficient cut-off of 0.5 used in other studies,1,15 and the second one based on a P < 0.05 significance level for a normal distribution with a mean of 0.187 and a standard deviation of 0.247, the sample statistics from the set of all calculated correlation coefficients, giving a minimum ‘strong' correlation of 0.594.2.4. Evolutionary analysis of gene pairsThe evolutionary history of each gene pair was constructed by comparing the status of the pair in each of the four species in this study. The likelihood of a given scenario was based on the number of gene rearrangements, deletions, and conservation using the fewest possible changes to the homologous regions of the last common ancestor to arrive at the present state. Gene pairs were then assigned to one of 14 groups based on their putative histories that could produce the observed results of the comparative analysis. Rice MSU data were used for this analysis.3. Results and discussion3.1. Conservation and rearrangementsConvergent, divergent, and tandem gene pairs in the rice and sorghum genomes were identified as described in methods. Four thousand and eight hundred convergent pairs, 3711 divergent pairs, and 9428 tandem pairs from the MSU rice gene set and 5059 convergent, 4913 divergent, and 11847 tandem pairs from the sorghum gene set were identified.The primary goal of this analysis was to determine how frequently the exact arrangement of a pair of adjacent genes is conserved in the genomes of other grass species and what changes have taken place when the pair is not conserved. Out of the four grass species selected for this study, rice and sorghum were chosen as starting points for comparisons because their sequence and annotation data sets were considerably better than those of maize and Brachypodium. Our comparative sequence analysis placed each rice or sorghum gene pair into one of four categories based on the presence or the absence of homologous genes and their locations in the genome. A pair of adjacent genes in rice/sorghum was considered to be conserved in other genomes when both the individual sequences of genes and the strand-wise arrangement of the pair were conserved. If a pair's homologs were found to be still adjacent but with a different strand-wise arrangement, then the pair was designated ‘inverted'. Homologs falling on different contigs, separated by other genes, or >50 kb apart were considered ‘rearranged'. Finally, one or both genes in the original pair may be lacking homologs because they were deleted in that species’ lineage or they arose in the ancestors of rice or sorghum after diverging from their last common ancestor. Together, these categories include all the major events of genomic evolution at this scale, and the relative frequencies of these events provide insight into the importance of proximity and strand-wise arrangement to proper gene function and regulation. To estimate the statistical significance of the variation observed among pair types, we compared the fraction of pairs of each type that fell into each category with the corresponding fraction of all pairs in that category.Conservation rates for both rice and sorghum gene pairs (Figs 1 and 2, Supplementary Tables S1 and S2) followed quite similar patterns. In every comparison, divergent gene pairs were conserved least often, with conservation frequencies significantly below the all pair average. Similarly, convergent pairs were conserved significantly more often than the all pair average. Tandem pair conservation rates were generally close to the all pair average. The conservation frequency differed a great deal among pair types in maize, where divergent pairs are conserved at rates close to half that of convergent or tandem pairs. Further, in Brachypodium, rice gene pairs are more frequently conserved than sorghum pairs. Although Brachypodium appears to be closer to rice than sorghum based on the divergence times of 40–53 Myr for Brachypodium–rice and 45–60 Myr for Brachypodium–sorghum based on synonymous substitution rates (Ks) of orthologous gene pairs,9 these evolutionary relationships are not well resolved. Likewise, maize is more closely related to sorghum than to rice11,16; thus, sorghum pairs have higher rates of conservation in maize than do rice pairs. Conservation and rearrangement of rice gene pairs (MSU data) in sorghum, maize, and Brachypodium.  A ‘+' or ‘-' at the base of a column indicates that pairs in that class are significantly (P < 0.01) overrepresented or underrepresented, respectively, compared with the general population of gene pairs using Z-test.Conservation and rearrangement of rice gene pairs (MSU data) in sorghum, maize, and Brachypodium.  A ‘+' or ‘-' at the base of a column indicates that pairs in that class are significantly (P < 0.01) overrepresented or underrepresented, respectively, compared with the general population of gene pairs using Z-test.Conservation and rearrangement of sorghum gene pairs in rice (MSU data), maize, and Brachypodium.  A ‘+' or ‘-' at the base of a column indicates that pairs in that class are significantly (P < 0.01) overrepresented or underrepresented, respectively, compared with the general population of gene pairs using Z-test.Conservation and rearrangement of sorghum gene pairs in rice (MSU data), maize, and Brachypodium.  A ‘+' or ‘-' at the base of a column indicates that pairs in that class are significantly (P < 0.01) overrepresented or underrepresented, respectively, compared with the general population of gene pairs using Z-test.Inversion of one or both genes was quite a rare phenomenon, ranging from 0.5% of sorghum tandem pairs inverted in rice (Fig. 1A) to 2% of sorghum divergent pairs in maize (Fig. 2B). We observed some variation among different pair types and comparison species, but the variation was not statistically significant.Among rearranged pairs, rice and sorghum gene pairs differ more than conserved and inverted pairs. Overall, sorghum pairs are more likely to be rearranged than rice pairs, with the rearrangement rates of sorghum pairs being ~10–20% higher than those of rice pairs (Figs 1 and 2). For both rice and sorghum pairs, rearrangement is most common in maize (Figs 1B and 2B) by a substantial margin and is least common in Brachypodium (Figs 1C and 2C). Divergent pairs are consistently the most commonly rearranged type, whereas convergent and tandem pairs are generally rearranged with similar frequencies in all comparison species.Considerable differences between rice and sorghum were also noted among gene pairs lacking homologs for one or both genes. Rice pairs missing homologs in sorghum are roughly one-half more common than sorghum pairs missing homologs in rice (15.7% versus 9.9%). In maize, rice genes are missing homologs more than twice as often as sorghum genes (22.7% versus 10%). The fractions of rice and sorghum pairs without homologs in Brachypodium are almost equal. Pair type does not seem to affect the presence or the absence of homologs because none of the pair types in any comparison species deviated significantly from the all pair average.Conservation and rearrangement rates differ between maize and the other comparison species most likely as a result of three primary sources. First, the genomic sequence of maize used in our study is in the form of individual BAC sequences, most of which are shorter than ~250 kb, rather than in the form of assembled sequences of near-chromosome length. Smaller sequences are, of course, less likely to contain complete gene pairs, especially if their intergenic regions have accumulated other genes or transposons over time. Second, transposons make up a much larger fraction of the maize genome than that of rice, sorghum, or Brachypodium genomes. In addition to physically disrupting the region into which they insert themselves, transposons can also increase the likelihood of recombinations, deletions, and other alterations in any area they inhabit. Third, the ancestors of maize quite likely suffered large-scale gene loss.16 If the first gene in a pair is deleted from one copy and the second gene was deleted in the other copy of the pair, both genes would still exist in the genome, but would no longer be paired. This type of occurrence would explain why more rice and sorghum gene pairs had more physically distant homologs in maize than in any other comparison species. All these factors would reduce the frequency of gene-pair conservation and correspondingly increase rearranged pairs, as we observed.In addition to 50 kb, genes residing within 20 and 75 kb were used to perform the above analysis. Although the number of gene pairs varied, the results showed same trends that were observed with 50 kb limit (Supplementary Tables S3 and S4).Comparative analysis was performed using a second set of rice genome annotation data, from the RAP (http://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp),17 to evaluate the effect of different methods of genome annotation on our results. We found that the analysis of the MSU rice gene set as well as the RAP gene set exhibited similar major trends regarding differences among the three pair types and comparison species. Although many of the same conclusions about conservation and rearrangement of gene pairs could be inferred from both the MSU and RAP results, significant differences exist between the two data sets (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S5). In sorghum, gene pairs identified using the RAP annotation data were conserved significantly less frequently than the MSU rice gene pairs, whereas the fractions of rearranged pairs were significantly higher among all pair types in sorghum and Brachypodium, and among tandem gene pairs in maize. Last, pairs missing homologs were less common overall when using the RAP annotation data, with the largest differences being found in maize and Brachypodium. However, comparing Fig. 1, Supplementary Table S1, and Table 1, nine statistically significant comparisons of conserved and rearranged gene pairs were common when MSU and RAP gene sets were used as starting points. The remaining two statistically significant comparisons (rice convergent pairs conserved and rearranged in Brachypodium) using the MSU gene set were close to being significant using the RAP gene set. These variations are most likely due to differences in RAP and MSU annotations. The MSU gene set contains considerably more genes than the RAP set (57 840 versus 34 780), a distinction that remains even after excluding hypothetical- and transposon-related genes (29 686 versus 22 308). Therefore, it is likely that either the MSU set contains a large number of incorrectly predicted genes or the RAP set is missing a similar number of real genes. The lower rates of missing homologs among the RAP set suggests that at least some of the genes found only in the MSU set are either false positives or unique to rice. These unique genes could also be low copy number transposable elements which are transcribed but not annotated as transposable elements.18RAP rice gene-pair conservation and rearrangementTest used is the binomial test (normal approximation) with cutoff of P < 0.01 (Z < 2.3267) shown in bold.RAP rice gene-pair conservation and rearrangementTest used is the binomial test (normal approximation) with cutoff of P < 0.01 (Z < 2.3267) shown in bold.3.2. Effects of correlated expression on rearrangementsThe Pearson correlation coefficient of all rice gene pairs was calculated using microarray and MPSS expression data. Those pairs with coefficients of 0.5 or greater were considered significantly correlated as described earlier.1 The full set of rice gene pairs (MSU data set) was divided into correlated and uncorrelated sets, and difference in the frequencies of each type of rearrangement within these sets was tested for significance using the binomial test. The purpose of this test was to determine whether gene pairs with correlated expression levels were subject to any of the various types of rearrangements at a significantly different rate than uncorrelated pairs.Correlated divergent and tandem gene pairs were more common among conserved pairs in all three species (Table 2), although the increase in conservation was statistically significant only for tandem pairs in sorghum and for divergent and tandem pairs in Brachypodium. The difference in the conservation rates between correlated and uncorrelated pairs was highest for tandem pairs, followed closely by divergent pairs, whereas the effect of correlation on convergent pairs was considerably weaker. Conservation of coexpressed tandem gene pairs could be due to tandemly duplicated genes which are likely to have similar expression patterns. Conservation of coexpressed divergent gene pairs could be due to bidirectional promoters regulating these gene pairs.19Conservation and rearrangement of correlated rice gene pairs with r > 0.5Values in the ‘Z' columns are test statistics of the binomial test. Values in bold denote significant differences (P < 0.05) in the frequency of strongly correlated pairs in each category compared with the frequency of uncorrelated pairs.Conservation and rearrangement of correlated rice gene pairs with r > 0.5Values in the ‘Z' columns are test statistics of the binomial test. Values in bold denote significant differences (P < 0.05) in the frequency of strongly correlated pairs in each category compared with the frequency of uncorrelated pairs.The small sample size used in the examination of the effect of correlated expression on gene-pair inversion reduced the effectiveness of the binomial test. In contrast, correlated expression in rice gene pairs appears to select against the disruption of a gene pair's physical arrangement in the other three grass genomes, with tandem pairs being significantly underrepresented in all three comparison species among pairs whose homologs are physically distant (Table 2). Divergent pairs showing correlated expression are also underrepresented in all three species, although the difference is not statistically significant. Correlated convergent pairs showed no significant difference compared with non-correlated pairs.Rice-correlated convergent pairs were strongly underrepresented among pairs lacking homologs in sorghum and maize.A second analysis was performed, this time using a statistically significant (see ‘Materials and methods' section for details) cut-off value for ‘strong' correlation of R > 0.594 (Supplementary Table S6). The greatest difference between this analysis and the first one using a cut-off of R > 0.5 is the number of strongly correlated pairs. The reduced sample size substantially affects the ability of the binomial test in determining significant variation between correlated and non-correlated pairs. As a result, statistical significance was observed only in convergent gene pairs missing homologs in maize, which were significantly underrepresented among strongly correlated pairs. Otherwise, most trends noted in the first analysis were also observed in the second analysis, with modest increases in conservation and inversion frequency and decreases in rearrangement frequency. The fractions of pairs missing homologs, either unchanged or reduced with the R > 0.5 definition of strong correlation, were more often increased with the alternative definition. These differences most likely result from the smaller sample size and its effect on the statistical test rather than any real biological differences between the set of gene pairs with R > 0.5 and those with R > 0.594.Rice gene pairs displaying strongly correlated expression levels were more likely to be conserved in sorghum, maize, and Brachypodium. These results lend further support to the hypothesis that the strand-wise arrangement of pairs of adjacent genes may be essential to the regulatory schemes of some strongly correlated gene pairs, such that rearrangements disturbing the pair would be selected against. Correlated expression levels have also been found to increase the likelihood of conservation among fungi.20 The largest increases in the frequency of conservation as a result of correlated expression was observed among divergent and tandem pairs, a pattern that has been observed before in a comparison of human, mouse, and chicken gene clusters.21,22 Therefore, correlated expression levels increasing the likelihood of conservation appears to be a universal phenomenon in eukaryotes including plant genomes.3.3. Evolutionary history of gene pairsThe estimated evolutionary history of each rice or sorghum gene pair was arrived at by examining the status of each gene pair in its three comparison species. For this analysis, a pair could be in one of three states in each species: conserved, rearranged (physically distant homologs, any inversion, and insertions), or deleted (one or both homologs nonexistent). On the basis of the possible combinations of these states, 14 categories of evolutionary history were devised. The putative evolutionary tree for the four species consisted of two branches, one with rice and Brachypodium, the other with sorghum and maize. Similarities within branches, as well as differences between them, served as the basis for many of the 14 categories.The first category consisted of those pairs whose exact arrangement was shared in all four species (Table 3, four species, and Fig. 3A). Results varied little between the rice- and sorghum-based analyses. Convergent pairs were the most common in this class, with over 18% of pairs falling into this category, followed by tandem pairs (~10%) and divergent pairs (~6%). Evolutionary history of rice and sorghum gene pairsEvolutionary history of rice and sorghum gene pairsCategories of gene-pair evolution. Each image is a representative of the many specific scenarios that may be found in that category. The bottom branch of each tree represents the species in which the pair was first identified (i.e. either rice or sorghum), and the two genes in question are shown in a divergent pair in these examples. Rearrangements are represented by the inversion of one gene, inversion of both genes, insertions within the pair, or translocation to other regions or chromosomes. Likewise, deletions may involve one gene, as shown, or both genes in the pair. In some of the scenarios where the pair is conserved in two species (D, E, G, and H), the rearranged or deleted states are just as likely to be the ancestral state as the divergent pair shown. In scenario L, it is also possible that both genes existed in the common ancestor and a deletion took place in the top branch rather than new gene(s) being created.Categories of gene-pair evolution.

In scenario L, it is also possible that both genes existed in the common ancestor and a deletion took place in the top branch rather than new gene(s) being created.Pairs conserved in two of their three comparison species most likely underwent a single species-specific rearrangement or deletion (Table 3 three species, and Fig. 3B and C). The former event was by far the most common, comprising 16–19% of all pairs, compared with the ~1% or less of pairs with one or both homologs deleted in a single species. Rice and sorghum results differed by less than one percentage point across all pair types.The six categories comprise pairs conserved in only one other species were divided into two groups (Table 3, two species), those in which the pair was conserved within one branch of the evolutionary tree (i.e. a rice pair conserved in Brachypodium), referred to here as a ‘branch-specific' pair (Fig. 3D–F), and those in which the pair was conserved in one species in each branch, a state referred to as ‘cross-branch conservation' (Fig. 3G–I). Among both branch-specific and cross-branch conserved pairs, it was far more common (7–12% of pairs in rice and 4–15% in sorghum) for the pair to be rearranged in the other two species than for it to be deleted in one (0.5–1.9%) or both species (0.1–1.4%). In rice, branch-specific pairs were slightly more common than cross-branch conserved pairs; in sorghum, the opposite was true. There were only two sets of genes in which rice and sorghum differed substantially. The first was branch-specific divergent pairs with the pair being rearranged in the other two species, including 11.7% of rice divergent pairs but only 4.4% of sorghum pairs (Table 3, two species). The opposite situation was observed among cross-branch conserved divergent pairs, again with two rearrangements. These pairs made up 9.3% of rice divergent pairs, compared with 14.6% of sorghum pairs.The last five categories consist of pairs with unique orientation in only one species (Table 3, one species). Pairs whose genes exist in all four species but whose pair-wise arrangement is found in a single species (Fig. 3K) were the most common category in both species (25–35% in sorghum and 21–28% in rice). Divergent pairs fell into this category substantially more often than convergent or tandem pairs in both rice and sorghum. In rice, the second most common category (10–12% of all pairs) is those pairs containing one or more genes unique to that species (Fig. 3J); in sorghum, this category is approximately one-third that of rice. These observations are most likely due to differences in the gene annotation methods used by the two genome projects and/or a larger number of genes unique to rice than to sorghum reflecting their biology. This conclusion is supported by RAP data which identified 56, 28, and 172 species-specific genes that are part of convergent, divergent, and tandem gene pairs, respectively, in rice but not the other three grass genomes, respectively, compared with 505, 475, and 1130 species-specific rice genes in MSU data that are part of convergent, divergent, and tandem gene pairs, respectively. A few other studies have also identified several genes and gene families specific to rice and sorghum.7,23 The third category (Fig. 3L) for all pair types were more than 2-fold in sorghum compared with rice (Table 3, one species). The distribution of pairs among the remaining two categories (Fig. 3M and N) showed little variation both between rice and sorghum and between pair types.Overall, our study provides valuable insights into conservation and rearrangement of gene pairs during the evolution of the grasses serving as basis for future investigations on functional interactions between adjacent genes.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by the National Research Initiative of the USDA Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service (2007-35301-18036).Supplementary data"

IntroductionGlutaredoxins (GRXs) are ubiquitous oxidoreductase enzymes that mediate reversible reduction of disulphide bonds of their substrate proteins in the presence of glutathione (GSH) via a dithiol or monothiol mechanism. GRXs generally contain a conserved cys-x-x-cys (dithiol GRXs) or cys-x-x-ser (monothiol GRXs) active-site motif, which is involved in reduction reaction. GRXs maintain and regulate cellular redox state and redox-dependent signaling pathways.1 These enzymes are involved in diverse cellular processes and play an important role in defense against oxidative stress.2 GRXs are present in a number of isoforms in prokaryotes and eukaryotes.Several cDNAs encoding GRX proteins have been isolated from various plant species.3,4 In Arabidopsis, at least 31 GRX genes have been predicted and divided into three major classes, namely CPYC-, CGFS- and CC-type, based on their predicted amino acid sequences and the composition of active-site motifs.3–5 Among these, CPYC- and CGFS-type classes exist in all organisms from prokaryotes to eukaryotes including plants, whereas the CC-type class has so far been identified only in land plants. The information on biochemical activity, structure and function of plant GRXs is very limited. Plant GRX isoforms possess the ability to reduce dehydroascorbate and type II peroxiredoxin.6,7 Recently, structure–function analyses indicated that poplar GrxC1 contains a {2Fe–2S} cluster in the holo form, suggesting a potential role of this Grx in sensing oxidative stress and iron–sulfur biosynthesis.8 The chloroplast-targeted AtGRXcp and AtGRX4 have been shown to play a critical role in oxidative stress response and redox regulation.9,10 Molecular genetic evidence suggests that ROXY1, encoding a CC-type GRX, is required for petal development in Arabidopsis.11 Further, it has been shown that ROXY1 together with its closest homolog, ROXY2, play a major role in control of male gametogenesis.12 Recently, the function of their closest homologs in rice have also been found to be conserved.13 It has been demonstrated that GRX interacts with TGA class of bZIP transcription factors and is involved in salicylic acid/jasmonic acid crosstalk.14 The probable role of plant GRXs in long-distance signaling has also been proposed due to their detection in phloem sieve tubes.3,15Although some of the members of GRX gene family have been identified, cloned and characterized in rice,13,16,17 the model monocot plant, a systematic genomic analysis at a genome-wide level is lacking. Previously, the presence of a total of 27 GRX genes has been reported in rice.5 In this study, we have identified 48 members of GRX gene family in rice and divided them into four classes based on the phylogenetic analysis and sequence conservation. The gene structure and putative conserved motifs have been analyzed. The expression studies indicated that GRXs exhibit a variety of gene expression patterns during development and in response to various environmental stimuli. Our analysis provides the framework for future studies to dissect functions of this important gene family.2. Materials and methods2.1. Identification of GRX proteinsA preliminary search for GRX proteins was performed using keyword ‘GRX’ in the Rice Genome Annotation Project (RGAP) database for rice and TAIR database for Arabidopsis. Another approach used was to search for the proteins containing PFam domain PF00462, which encodes GRX domain. Further, the rice and Arabidopsis proteomes downloaded from RGAP (version 6.1) and TAIR (version 9), respectively, were searched using the hidden Markov model (HMM) profile (build 2.3.2) for GRX domain (PF00462) downloaded from the PFam database. The results obtained from all the above approaches were pooled together and redundancy was removed. Further, all the proteins were searched in the SMART and PFam databases to confirm the presence of GRX domain. The GRX proteins in Populus trichocarpa, Glycine max and Zea mays were identified by BLASTP searches of all the identified rice and Arabidopsis GRX proteins against their annotated proteomes followed by confirmation of the presence of GRX domain in the SMART and PFam databases.2.2. Protein sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysisMultiple sequence alignments of amino acid sequences were performed using ClustalX (version 1.83) program and were corrected manually. The unrooted phylogenetic trees were generated by the neighbor-joining (NJ) method using ClustalX and Phylogeny Inference Package (PHYLIP v3.69) programs with default parameters and displayed using NJPlot program. Bootstrap analysis was performed with 1000 replicates to obtain a support value for each branch.2.3. Sequence analysisThe amino acid sequences of all the predicted GRX proteins were analyzed for subcellular localization by TargetP1.1.18 The putative conserved motifs were identified using MEME (version 4.1.0) program with default parameters except the minimum number of sites for a motif to find was defined as five.192.4. Chromosomal localization and gene duplicationAll the GRX genes were positioned on the rice and Arabidopsis chromosomes using BLASTN. The GRX genes present on duplicated chromosomal segments were identified by segmental genome duplication of rice available at RGAP with the maximum length distance permitted between collinear gene pairs of 500 kb. The presence of Arabidopsis GRX genes on duplicated chromosomal segments were investigated using ‘Paralogons in Arabidopsis’ (http://wolfe.gen.tcd.ie/athal/dup). The GRX genes separated by a maximum of five genes were identified as tandemly duplicated genes.2.5. Expression analysis using cDNA/EST and massively parallel signature sequencing dataTo find cDNA and EST sequences corresponding to OsGRX genes, BLASTN search was performed in non-redundant and EST databases at NCBI. The gene expression evidence search page available at RGAP database was also used to find the availability of corresponding FL-cDNA and/or EST evidences. The MPSS (massively parallel signature sequencing) data were searched at Rice MPSS project for 20-base signatures from 22 mRNA libraries representing 18 different tissues/organs in rice for expression evidence analysis.20 Only the signatures, which uniquely identify an individual gene and show perfect match (100% identity over 100% of the length of the tag), were used for the analysis. The normalized abundance (tags per million, tpm) of these signatures for a given gene in a given library represents the quantitative estimate of the expression of that gene.2.6. Expression analysis using microarray dataFor rice, the microarray data available at Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database under the series accession numbers GSE6893 (various stages of development),21 GSE6901 (abiotic stress),21 GSE4471 (arsenate stress),22 GSE5167 (auxin and cytokinin treatment),23 GSE7256 (virulent infection by Magnaporthe grisea)24 and GSE10373 (interaction with the parasitic plant Striga hermonthica)25 were used for expression analysis of OsGRX genes. In addition, microarray analysis was performed for oxidative stress treatments with methyl viologen and hydrogen peroxide, and hormone treatments including ABA, ACC, SA and JA using Affymetrix whole genome rice arrays as described earlier.21 For Arabidopsis, the microarray data for various stages of developments, hormone treatments and abiotic stress treatments corresponding to those analyzed for rice were downloaded from GEO (series accession numbers GSE5620, GSE5621, GSE5623, GSE5624 and GSE5629–GSE5634) and AtGenExpress (http://www.arabidopsis.org/portals/expression/microarray/ATGenExpress.jsp) databases. The Affymetrix CEL files were imported into Genespring GX (version 11) software (Agilent Technologies). The normalization and probe summarization was performed by the Gene Chip Robust Multi Array (GCRMA) method. A stringent statistical analysis consisting of one-way ANOVA over all the samples in a series was performed and the Benjamini–Hoschberg multiple testing correction was applied to the data (P= 0.05).The IDs of probe sets present on the Affymetrix rice genome array representing the OsGRX and AtGRX genes were identified. The data for only one probe set for each GRX gene were used for expression analysis. This resulted in identification of probe sets for 40 OsGRX and 38 AtGRX genes that were represented on the rice and Arabidopsis Affymetrix arrays, respectively. A fold change of at least 2-fold with a P-value of at least 0.05 was considered to be significant to identify differentially expressed genes. The tab-delimited files for the average log signal values for development data and fold-change values for abiotic stress, biotic stress and hormone treatments were imported into TIGR MultiExperiment Viewer (MeV) to generate heatmaps based on hierarchical clustering.2.7. Real-time PCR analysisThe real-time PCR analysis was performed using gene-specific primers as described earlier.26 All the primer sequences used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table S1. At least two biological replicates of each sample and three technical replicates of each biological replicate were analyzed for real-time PCR analysis. The expression of each gene in different RNA samples was normalized with the expression of the suitable internal control gene, UBQ5,26 to ensure the equal amount of cDNA used for individual reactions. The relative mRNA levels for each candidate gene in different tissue samples were calculated using the <U+25B5><U+25B5>CT method.2.8. Structure modelTo identify the best template structures, all the OsGRX proteins were searched by BLASTP in all the GRX proteins for which a three-dimensional structure is known in Protein Data Bank (PDB). The crystal structures of Populus GRX S12 (PDB ID 3fza) and GRXC1 (PDB ID 2e7p) were used as templates for constructing the structure models of rice CPYC- and CC-type class proteins. Similarly, crystal structures of human GRX5 (PDB ID 2wul) and Escherichia coli GRX4 (PDB ID 2wci) were used as templates for constructing the structure models of rice CGFS-type class proteins. The sequences of template and representative OsGRX proteins were aligned by align2D_Mult program in the MODELLER package.27 On the basis of the alignment, structures were built using Model_Mult of MODELLER package. The stereochemical properties of all the optimized generated models were assessed using PROCHECK to select the best model for a given protein.28 Dock (6.2) program was used for docking of GSH to the GRX proteins.2.9. Plant growthFor salt, desiccation, cold, arsenate, methyl viologen and hydrogen peroxide stress treatments, 7-day-old light-grown rice (Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica var. IR64) seedlings were transferred to a beaker containing 200 mM NaCl solution, dried between folds of tissue paper at 28 ± 1°C, kept at 4 ± 1°C, transferred to a beaker containing 50 µM sodium arsenate solution, transferred to a beaker containing 100 µM methyl viologen solution and transferred to a beaker containing 10 mM hydrogen peroxide solution, respectively, each for 3 h. Likewise, 7-day-old light-grown rice seedlings were transferred to a beaker containing 50 µM solutions of indole-3-acetic acid and benzyl aminopurine and 100 µM solutions of abscisic acid, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), salicylic acid and jasmonic acid for different hormone treatments. The control seedlings were kept in water for 3 h, at 28 ± 1°C.3. Results and discussion3.1. Identification of GRXs in rice and ArabidopsisA total of 31, 36 and 27 GRX proteins have been identified in Arabidopsis, Populus and rice, respectively, and divided into three classes.3,4 Further, the presence of 21, 22 and 17 plant-specific CC-type GRXs has been reported in Arabidopsis, Populus and rice, respectively.5,13,29 In addition, 15 non-canonical GRX-like (GRL) proteins have been identified in Arabidopsis.30 In this study, multiple searches followed by confirming the presence of GRX domain using SMART and PFam, resulted in the identification of 48 loci in the rice genome that encode for putative GRX proteins. We identified an identical number (48) of GRX genes in the Arabidopsis genome as well. Despite the difference in genome sizes between Arabidopsis and rice, the two plant species have identical number of genes encoding GRX proteins. Phylogenetic tree among the rice and Arabidopsis GRX proteins was constructed by the NJ method using ClustalX and PHYLIP programs. The 96 GRXs were grouped into four distinct groups with high bootstrap support using ClustalX program (Fig. 1A). An identical grouping of GRX proteins was observed in the phylogenetic tree constructed using PHYLIP program (Supplementary Fig. S1). The classes include CC-type (17 in rice and 21 in Arabidopsis), CGFS-type (5 in rice and 5 in Arabidopsis), CPYC- type (7 each in rice and Arabidopsis) and GRL-type (19 in rice and 16 in Arabidopsis) (Fig. 1A; Table 1; Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). The number of CC-type GRXs identified in this study is identical as that reported earlier.13 The members of CC-type, CPYC-type and CGFS-type classes contain a conserved active-site motif and were designated as OsGRX in rice and AtGRX in Arabidopsis, followed by a number according to their position on rice or Arabidopsis chromosomes from top to bottom (Table 1; Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). The members included in GRL-type class showed low homology to classical GRXs and do not harbor conserved active-site motif as reported earlier.30 To distinguish these proteins from classical GRXs, these proteins were designated as OsGRL in rice and AtGRL in Arabidopsis followed by a number according to their position on rice or Arabidopsis chromosomes from top to bottom (Table 1; Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). The detailed genomic information about all the predicted GRX genes in rice and Arabidopsis is given in Supplementary Tables S2 and S3.

Exons are represented by black boxes and introns as lines.A comparison of the coding sequence with the corresponding genomic DNA sequences showed that quite a large number of GRX genes (69% in rice and 71% in Arabidopsis) are intronless (Fig. 1B), which is very large number as compared at the whole genome level (20%).31 Striking gene structure conservation was found within the members of each class. Notably, all but one member of CC-type class and most of members of GRL-type class GRX genes are intronless. Such intronless class/family of genes can evolve rapidly by gene duplication or reverse transcription followed by integration in the genome.31–34 This might explain the larger number of members of these classes of proteins, which may perform diverse plant-specific functions. There are only few GRX genes found in other organisms. The large number of GRX genes present in rice and Arabidopsis genome highlights the importance of these genes in plants. Although CGFS-type and CPYC-type class GRX proteins represent ancestral genes from prokaryotes to eukaryotes, the plant-specific CC-type and GRL-type class GRX proteins are more in number both in rice and Arabidopsis, further indicating their importance. Earlier, a comparative analysis in various plant species, including Physcomitrella patens, Pinus taeda, O. sativa, P. trichocarpa and Arabidopsis thaliana revealed that the number of CC-type class GRXs has expanded during plant evolution.29 On the contrary, the number of CPYC- and CGFS-type class members remained constant. For example, only two CC-type GRXs have been found in Physcomitrella,29 whereas 17 in rice and 21 in Arabidopsis. On the basis of this observation, a possible function of CC-type class GRXs in contributing to the evolution of land plants that forms organs of higher complexity has been proposed.293.2. Genomic organization and expansion of GRX gene familyThe physical locations of all the 48 OsGRXs were assigned to the 12 rice chromosomes (Fig. 2). The distribution of GRX genes among the chromosomes appears to be uneven; chromosome 9 harbors no GRX genes, whereas chromosome 1 harbors nine GRX genes. Other chromosomes have 2–5 GRX genes localized on them. Only two clusters of tandemly arranged GRX genes were found in rice; one of four GRXs on chromosome 11 and other of two GRXs on chromosome 12. On the other hand, we found 10 pairs (20 members) of GRX genes were located on duplicated chromosomal segments in rice. The distribution of GRX genes relative to duplicated chromosomal segments in rice is illustrated in Fig. 2. In Arabidopsis, the 48 GRXs were localized on all the five chromosomes ranging from 7 to 13 in number (Supplementary Fig. S2). Three clusters were observed, one of two GRXs on chromosome 2; second of three GRXs on chromosome 3 and third of five GRXs on chromosome 4. Seven pairs (14 members) of GRX genes were located on duplicated chromosomal segments in Arabidopsis. Further analysis revealed that a similar set of genes were found to be present in the proximity of GRX gene pairs predicted to be located on duplicated chromosomal segments in rice and Arabidopsis. The details of the genes present in the proximity of the GRX gene pairs located on chromosomal segments in rice and Arabidopsis, including their gene identifiers, description, chromosomal location and E-value are given in Supplementary Tables S4 and S5, respectively. Chromosomal distribution and segmental duplication events of OsGRX genes. The chromosome number is indicated on the top of each bar.

The GRX genes localized on duplicated chromosomal segments are connected by lines. The clusters of tandemly arranged GRX genes are indicated in boxes.Taken together, it appears that the chromosomal segment duplications have mainly contributed to the expansion giving rise to 42 and 29% of GRX genes in rice and Arabidopsis, respectively. However, tandem or local gene duplication occurred less frequently in Arabidopsis and rice. Further, it is also clear that chromosomal segment duplication has contributed more for expansion of GRX genes in rice when compared with Arabidopsis. In addition, in the phylogenetic tree constructed from rice and Arabidopsis GRX domain sequences, we observed some species-specific clades within a class (Fig. 1A, Supplementary Fig. S1). This indicates that the expansion of different classes has occurred independently in a species-specific manner in rice and Arabidopsis. This observation was further validated by constructing a phylogenetic tree among the GRX domain sequences from a total of 259 GRX proteins identified from various plant species, including rice (48), Arabidopsis (48), Populus (45), G. max (82) and Z. mays (36) using ClustalX (Supplementary Fig. S3) and PHYLIP (data not shown) programs. We found both lineage-specific (monocot- and dicot-specific) and species-specific clades in these phylogenetic trees as well, further confirming the expansion of GRX gene family in the monocots and dicots independently. Recently, the expansion of CC-type class GRX proteins in angiosperms has also been proposed mainly through paleopolyploidy duplication events after the monocot–dicot split.353.3. Sequence analysisThe length of GRX proteins varied greatly ranging from minimum of 103 (OsGRX4 and OsGRX28) to 711 amino acids (OsGRL12) in rice. The pairwise comparison of GRX protein sequences showed considerable sequence diversity. However, relatively more identity was found among the members of the same class. The multiple sequence alignments of full-length GRX protein sequences showed that the core region, which represents the GRX domain, is most conserved. All the members of CGFS-type, CPYC-type and CC-type class GRX proteins harbor the conserved active site (Table 1). The cysteine at first position of the active site was invariably conserved in all the proteins; however, variations were found at other positions. All the five members of CGFS-type class contain perfectly conserved CGFS as an active site. However, only one member harbors characteristic CPYC motif in CPYC-type class, other members have CPFC (four), CPYS (one) and CSYC (one) as active site. In CC-type class GRX proteins, nine members harbor CCMC as active site. The characteristic two cysteine residues were conserved in all CC-type GRXs except for five. In fact, the second cysteine residue has not been found crucial for the activity of CC-type GRXs in Arabidopsis.11 In addition, most of the members of CC-type class rice GRX proteins harbor four C-terminal residues, A(L/I)W(L/V), which were found to be essential for their in planta function and physical interaction with target proteins.36 Most of the members of GRL-type class proteins harbor eight conserved cysteines, arranged in two CxxCx7CxxC clusters in rice at the C-terminal end. Similar pattern of conserved cysteines has been reported in Arabidopsis GRL proteins as well.30To identify additional putative conserved motifs in GRX proteins, all the 96 GRX proteins from rice and Arabidopsis were searched using MEME program. Ten highly significant (<e-50) putative motifs of at least six amino acids in length conserved in more than 10 GRX proteins were identified (Table 2; Supplementary Fig. S4). Notably, all the putative motifs identified are conserved in rice and Arabidopsis. Some of the motifs were present in the members of more than one class. However, others were specific to a particular class. For example, motif 1, which represents a part of GRX domain, was present in most of the members of all classes. Motif 2 was present in CPYC-type and CC-type GRX proteins. Motifs 3, 5 and 7 were present only in GRL type of GRX proteins. Motif 4 was present in CC-type and CPYC-type proteins only. Motifs 9 and 10 were present in CC-type proteins only, whereas motifs 6 and 8 were present in CGFS type only. Overall, the organization of putative conserved motifs coincided with the grouping of GRXs in various classes and may be responsible for functional specificity among GRX proteins of various class types. List of putative conserved motifs in rice and Arabidopsis GRX proteins predicted by MEMEList of putative conserved motifs in rice and Arabidopsis GRX proteins predicted by MEMEGRXs have been predicted to localize in all cellular components except nucleus using prediction software programs.3 However, recently, it has been shown that nuclear activity of one of CC-type GRX, ROXY1, is required for its role in petal development.36 We also analyzed the putative subcellular localization of OsGRX proteins using TargetP program.18 Using TargetP, 11, 15 and 10 of GRXs were predicted to localize to chloroplast, mitochondria and secretory pathway, respectively, other 12 were predicted to localize to any other location. Further, TMHMM predicted the presence of transmembrane a-helix in only two of GRX proteins (one predicted in secretory pathway and second in any other location). Although these results provide a clue toward putative subcellular localization of GRX proteins, experimental evidences are required to validate the results.3.4. Structure modelingAlthough the structure of a number of GRXs have been determined by X-ray and NMR from various organisms, the structure of only two plant GRXs (from Populus) have been determined so far.8,35 We made an attempt to study the structure of representative members of different classes of GRXs based on homology modeling. One representative member from each of CGFS-type, CPYC-type and CC-type classes showing best homology with known proteins in PDB database was selected and analyzed. Rice GRL-type class proteins did not show any significant homology to known GRX proteins in PDB and thus were not analyzed. The three-dimensional structure modeling of representative GRX proteins from CGFS-type, CPYC-type and CC-type classes showed that, in general, the structure of OsGRXs are conserved (Fig. 3A). The structure examination showed that GRX protein shared the same conformation of structural elements of a-helices and ß-sheets as that of templates (six a-helices and four ß-sheets for CC- and CPYC-type, and six a-helices and three ß-sheets for CGFS-type). However, structural differences are present in the variable loop regions, where sequence conservation is relatively weak. In the modeled structures, the positions of three conserved regions (constituted by WCSY, TVP and GST residues in Populus),37 representing GSH-binding sites, were marked and found to be conserved structurally in the members of CPYC-type, whereas the modeled structures of CC-type and CGFS-type exhibited slight variability. However, these variations were not significant as depicted by root mean-square deviation calculations of modeled structures and templates using Chimera tool (Supplementary Table S6). Further, the Ramachandran plot analysis revealed that 98–100% of residues lie within allowed regions, only 1–2% being in disallowed regions in the case of CGFS type (Supplementary Table S6). Overall, the structures of CPYC-type and CC-type class members were more similar than that of CGFS-type. It has been proposed that the CC-type GRXs probably arose by diversification from the CPYC-type.35 The molecular docking of GSH was done with representative OsGRX proteins based on the known structure of Populus GRX S12 complexed with GSH (PDB ID 3fza). The analysis showed that in the structure of OsGRX proteins GSH could fit well in the groove constituted by conserved active site residues (Fig. 3B). The thermodynamically stable binding of ligand GSH was revealed by calculation of grid score (Supplementary Table S6). The negative energy values indicated thermodynamic stability of the binding. The stability of GSH complexed OsGRX proteins was further substantiated using consensus scoring function X-score (Supplementary Table S6). Taken together, the overall structure including GSH-binding site of OsGRX proteins seems to be conserved as that of known GRX proteins, suggesting their similar biochemical properties.

Differential expression of OsGRX genes in various organs/developmental stagesThe gene expression patterns can provide important clues for the gene function. We looked for the expression evidence for all the OsGRX genes in cDNA, EST and MPSS databases. This analysis revealed that one or more cDNA and/or EST sequences were available for 39 (81%) of OsGRXs, providing strong indication for expression of most OsGRXs (Fig. 4A). However, the frequency of ESTs for GRX genes varied and also the ESTs were derived from various tissues/organs, indicating their differential expression. Further, we surveyed Rice MPSS Project database for each of OsGRX gene to collect the expression evidence in terms of MPSS tags. We found significant unique 20 b signatures corresponding to at least 31 OsGRX genes (Fig. 4A). This included MPSS signatures for three GRX genes, for which no cDNA and/or EST evidence was available. The number of tags (in tpm) also varied significantly in various tissues/organs indicating differential expression of OsGRX genes (Supplementary Table S7). Taken together, we found expression evidence for at least 42 (88%) OsGRX genes in terms of availability of cDNA, EST and/or MPSS tags. Expression profiles of OsGRX genes in various tissues.

The color scale is given at the bottom.In addition to sequence-based expression analysis methods, we previewed the expression profiles of OsGRX genes during various stages of development using microarray data. The microarray data from 54 arrays representing 18 stages of development throughout the life cycle of rice, including root, mature leaf, Y leaf, shoot apical meristem (SAM), stages of panicle development (P1-I to P1-III, P1 to P6) and stages of seed development (S1 to S5) was analyzed. The average log signal values for all the 40 OsGRX genes represented on Affymetrix Rice Genome array were analyzed. Following whole chip data processing, the average log signal values were extracted (Supplementary Table S8). The hierarchical cluster analysis based on average log signal values indicated that OsGRX genes display diverse expression patterns (Fig. 4B). Most of the 40 GRX genes are expressed in at least one of the 18 rice tissues investigated in this study. Most diverse expression patterns were found in the members of CC-type GRX genes, indicating that this class of proteins are most evolved with specialized function. OsGRX8 has a significantly higher expression in SAM and stages of panicle development than in other tissues, whereas OsGRX3 seems to be predominantly expressed in late stage of panicle development (P6) and stages of seed development. OsGRX28 exhibited specific expression during S1 stage of seed development only. OsGRX13 and OsGRX19 were also expressed preferentially in SAM and early stages of panicle development. Two members of CGFS-type class, OsGRX11 and OsGRX27 were expressed at lower level in SAM and stages of panicle development as compared to other tissues/developmental stages. OsGRX20, a CPYC-class member, was expressed at higher level in mature and Y leaf. At least six members of GRL type showed very low level of expression in all the tissues examined. OsGRL1, a GRL-type GRX, showed maximum expression levels in mature leaf and stages of seed development. OsGRL19 also exhibited similar expression profile with some expression in late stages of panicle development. However, OsGRL16 showed distinct very low level of expression in SAM as compared to all other tissues/developmental stages analyzed. Similar to rice, the expression patterns of CC-type GRX genes were most diverse in Arabidopsis as well, showing differential and/or specific expression in various tissues/developmental stages analyzed (Supplementary Fig. S5A). The members of CGFS- and CPYC-type classes were expressed at high level in all the tissue samples analyzed, whereas few genes of GRL-type class also exhibited tissue-/developmental stage-specific expression patterns (Supplementary Fig. S5A).Although the expression profiles of GRXs have been reported in various plant species,15,16,38,39 the evidence for their role in plant growth and development is lacking except for floral organ development. The molecular genetic analysis revealed the role of two Arabidopsis CC-type GRXs named as ROXY1 and ROXY2, in petal and anther development.11,12 It has been demonstrated that nuclear localization of ROXY1 protein is crucial for its role in petal development.36 In a yeast two-hybrid screen, ROXY1 was found to interact with TGA family of transcription factors.36 Recently, complementation analysis revealed the conserved function in floral organ development of orthologs of ROXY1 and ROXY2 in rice as well.13 In our study also, we found the preferential expression of OsROXY1 (OsGRX8) during stages of panicle development, which further validates its role in floral organ development. Similarly, other OsGRX genes expressed preferentially in specific tissue/developmental stage might perform specific function crucial for the development.3.6. Differential expression of OsGRX genes in response to hormone treatmentsWe also studied the expression profiles of OsGRX genes in rice seedlings subjected to various hormone treatments auxin (IAA), cytokinin (BAP), abscisic acid (ABA), ethylene derivative (ACC), salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA)). A total of 11 GRX genes showed differential expression more than 2-fold in at least one hormone treatment as compared to control (Fig. 5A). Six (OsGRX3, GRX6, GRX8, GRX9, GRX14 and GRX28) genes showed up-regulation, while three (OsGRX2, GRX27 and GRX29) genes showed down-regulation in different hormone treatments as compared to control. OsGRX23 showed down-regulation in response to IAA, ABA, SA and JA, however, up-regulation in response to BAP. OsGRX16 was up-regulated in response to ABA, but down-regulated in response to BAP. Five of OsGRX genes showed response to specific hormone treatments only, while others were responsive to two or more hormone treatments. The fold-change values of OsGRX genes showing differential expression is given in Supplementary Table S9. The real-time PCR results of selected differentially expressed genes under various hormone treatments were consistent with the microarray data (Fig. 5B). In Arabidopsis also, at least eight GRX genes (five CC type and three GRL type) showed significant differential expression in response to various plant hormones (Supplementary Fig. S5B; Supplementary Table S10). A very little information is available regarding the direct link between GRX and hormonal response so far. One of the TGA-interacting GRX protein has been proposed as a potential regulatory component of SA/JA antagonism.14 Our results clearly show that GRXs might play important role in response to various plant hormones.

Differential expression of OsGRX genes in response to different stressesTo gain insight into the role of OsGRX genes during various abiotic stress conditions, their expression patterns were investigated in rice seedlings subjected to desiccation, salt, cold, methyl viologen, hydrogen peroxide and arsenate stress. A total of 19 (40%) GRX genes showed differential expression under at least one of the abiotic stress conditions analyzed (Fig. 6A). Notably, 11 of these genes belong to CC-type and five from GRL-type class. Some of them were regulated by a specific stress condition only; however, others were regulated by more than one stress condition. The fold-change values of OsGRX genes showing differential expression is given in Supplementary Table S9. The validation of expression profiles of some of the selected genes by real-time PCR analysis confirmed their differential expression (Fig. 6B). Likewise, a total of 23 (48%) of AtGRX genes, including 14 CC type, 1 CGFS type, 3 CPYC type and 5 GRL type, were differentially expressed in root and shoot tissues subjected to various abiotic stress conditions (Supplementary Fig. S5C; Supplementary Table S10).

For this analysis, we used microarray data from two earlier studies on transcriptome analysis of rice (Nipponbare) after infection with M. grisea and gene expression profiling in roots of susceptible (IAC165) and highly resistant (Nipponbare) cultivars after infection with S. hermonthica.24,25 The data analysis revealed that a total of 18 OsGRX genes showed response to biotic stress conditions (Fig. 7). Among these, nine genes belong to CC-type class. The fold-change values of OsGRX genes showing differential expression is given in Supplementary Table S9. These results further confirm that members of CC-type class GRX genes are more functionally evolved as compared to other classes.

The color scale for fold-change values in shown at the bottom. dpi, days post inoculation.The role of GRXs in stress responses has been proposed in many studies. The Arabidopsis chloroplastic GRXs, AtGRXcp and AtGRX4, were induced by various stresses and suppressed the yeast grx5 mutant sensitivity to oxidants.9,10 The atgrxcp mutant plants showed defects in early seedling growth under oxidative stress suggesting the biological role in protecting cells against oxidative damage.9 The overexpression of Pteris vittata GRX, PvGRX5, improved arsenic tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants via decreasing arsenic accumulation.40 The analysis of transgenic plants overexpressing OsWRKY13 revealed that OsWRKY-associated disease resistance pathway positively interact with GSH/GRX system to monitor redox homeostatsis.41 Recently, it has been reported that the overexpression of rice CC-type GRXs in Arabidopsis led to an increased accumulation of H2O2 levels and hyper-susceptibility to infection from necrotrophic pathogen Botrytis cinerea.13 Several plant GRX targets have been identified which are involved in various cellular processes and located in different subcellular compartments. The study suggested that GRXs have a broad capacity to reduce oxidized disulfides and to provide electrons to many enzymatic reduction reactions maintaining redox homeostasis.42 Taken together, the differential expression of several OsGRX genes indicates their important role in various abiotic and biotic stress responses and they might be involved in maintaining redox homeostasis during stress conditions and overexpression of few of these might impart stress tolerance in transgenic plants.3.8. Duplicated GRX genes exhibit redundant and divergent expression patternsGene duplication is an important event, which gives rise to functional redundancy and diversification. Gene duplication may lead to sub- or neo-functionalization in addition to non- or hypo-functionalization.43 We found many segmentally duplicated and a few tandemly duplicated OsGRX genes. We investigated differences in the expression patterns of duplicated OsGRX genes to reveal the role of gene duplication in functional diversification. The expression data were available for six gene pairs present on duplicated chromosomal segments and one gene pair localized in tandem. Among the six gene pairs, three, OsGRX2/16, OsGRX6/17 and OsGRX8/13, showed similar expression patterns with high (>0.75) Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC). Both the genes in gene pair OsGRL9/17 showed very low expression levels in all the tissues examined. Two gene pairs OsGRX9/14 and OsGRL7/14 showed highly divergent expression patterns with PCC value of 0.19 and -0.45, respectively. One gene pair (OsGRX28/29), which is tandemly localized, also showed divergent expression patterns with PCC value of 0.56. The gene pairs with divergent expression patterns might represent the events of sub- or neo-functionalization, suggesting their functional diversification during evolution.3.9. ConclusionsIn this study, we have identified 48 GRX genes in rice and compared with those of Arabidopsis. The GRX proteins formed four classes as supported by phylogeny and motif organization. Gene duplication analysis revealed that expansion of this gene family has occurred independently in rice and Arabidopsis via whole genome duplication events. Further, the phylogenetic analysis showed that GRX gene family has expanded in species-specific manner after monocot–dicot split. The expression analysis revealed the differential temporal and spatial expression patterns of OsGRX genes, which suggested their role in regulating plant growth and development throughout the lifecycle of plant. Further, we found the expression of OsGRX genes is influenced by several environmental stimuli, including hormones, abiotic stress and biotic stress conditions indicating their role in hormonal and stress responses. Although from our expression analysis results in rice and Arabidopsis (Figs 4–7; Supplementary Fig. S5), the GRX proteins from different classes could not be linked to a specific function and/or response pattern, it is clear that CC-type class GRX proteins are most functionally evolved and are involved in diverse biological processes, including development and response to various environmental stimuli (hormone, abiotic and biotic stress). However, the GRL-type class GRX proteins appear to be more specifically involved in response to various environmental stimuli. Previously, the members of CGFS and CPYC type have been linked only to response to oxidative stress. Our results also support their role in various stress responses. However, the functional validation and biochemical characterization of various members will only provide definitive clues about the specific roles of different classes of GRX proteins. The data provided in this study will serve as useful information for further in-depth functional analysis of GRX genes in rice and Arabidopsis.Supplementary DataSupplementary Data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by the Department of Biotechnology, Government of India, New Delhi, under the Innovative Young Biotechnologists Award scheme and core grant from NIPGR to M.J.Supplementary data"

IntroductionGenome-wide expression profiling based on microarray technology is a powerful tool for both basic and clinical research focused on understanding genetic interactions and changes in gene pathways. It also facilitates the identification of genomic biomarkers that correlate with disease classification and with patient responses to drug treatment. For practical diagnostic purposes, however, the currently available general-purpose microarrays have significant drawbacks. Large volumes of data, such as from 40 000 genes or more, are not feasibly managed or analysed. Moreover, the high cost of the microarrays and the compound scanning tools has also hampered the clinical application of microarray systems. In contrast, customized, focused microarrays are advantageous for clinical use because they harbour a substantial, but not overwhelming, number of specific genes that allow researchers and clinicians to evaluate the state of target cells in a relatively inexpensive, rapid, and reliable way.1 Focused microarrays have been successfully applied to the analysis of human embryonic stem cell differentiation,2 dopaminergic and glial cell differentiation,3 transcriptional regulation of the glycome,4 glyco gene targets with therapeutic potential,5 gene expression in the mitochondria,6 oestrogenic activity of phthalate esters7 and the cell state of non-small cell lung cancer patients.8 Unfortunately, the focused microarrays currently available, which are based on the two-dimensional display of oligonucleotides on a glass-based platform, do not offer a substantial economic advantage, reliable quality or the possibility for large-scale production.We report here the development and practical application of a novel platform for focused microarray, termed Genopal™. The performance of two types of focused microarrays were validated using fluorescently labelled antisense oligonucleotides selected from the genomes of infectious bacteria and viruses for the former, and complementary RNAs (cRNAs) derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of Takayasu arteritis (TA) patients for the latter. TA is a rare autoimmune disease of unknown origin that predominantly affects women and leads to inflammation of the large arteries, resulting in various types of aortoarterial stenosis/occlusion or dilatation.9,10. Here, microarray analysis based on the Spearman rank correlation identified an expression pattern specific to TA, which suggests that the Genopal™ is useful for the diagnosis of TA.2. Patients, Materials and Methods2.1. Human subjects and ethical considerationsAll systemic vasculitis patients used in this study were diagnosed according to a previously documented proposal (the ACR criteria and the CHCC criteria). This study was reviewed and approved by the Internal Review Board of the Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University. Accordingly, written informed consent was obtained from all participants before their PBMCs were obtained. Serum samples were consecutively obtained regardless of the patient's symptom, active or inactive phase.2.2. Production of hollow fibre arraysGenopal™ consists of hollow fibres impregnated with gel that firmly adheres to the inner walls of the fibres via the introduction of comb polymers (Fig. 1A). Detailed technical aspects of Genopal™ are described in the following patents: US7122378, US20040234114, US20040258897, US20050063877 and EP1627839. Briefly, methyl methacrylate (MMA, 100 parts), glycidyl methacrylate (GMA, 100 parts) and azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN, 0.5 parts) were added dropwise to methyl ethyl ketone (MEK, 50 parts) at 80°C in a nitrogen gas stream (50 ml/min) for 3 h. AIBN (0.1 parts) and MEK (70 parts) were then added, and the mixture was allowed to stand for 1 h. Subsequently, AIBN (0.1 parts) and MEK (10 parts) were added, and the resulting product was allowed to stand for 3 h before the addition of MEK (50 parts). Thereafter, methylhydroquinone (0.5 parts), triphenylphosphine (2.5 parts) and acrylic acid (99 mol % GMA) were added. During these procedures, reactions were aerated (100 ml/min) and allowed to proceed for 30 h. Comb polymers with vinyl groups added to their side-chain termini were obtained. These copolymers contained 25 mol % vinyl groups (Fig. 1B). Structure of Genopal™ and its mass production application via slicing of the Genopal™ block.

(D) Schematic representation of a Genopal™ block: the hollow fibres were bundled in an orderly arrangement, hardened with resin to form a Genopal™ block and sliced into thin microarrays.Two hundred and twenty-five hollow poly-MMA fibres (outer diameter, 300 µm; inner diameter, 200 µm; length, 60 cm; Mitsubishi Rayon Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) were bundled, and comb polymers were introduced into the hollow portions. Part of the solution introduced by suction into the hollow portions was transferred to the trap tube, and the solvent remaining on the inner walls of the hollow portions was allowed to evaporate by air drying. Subsequently, two porous plates (thickness, 0.1 mm) comprising 49 pores each arranged in seven rows in both lengthwise and breadthwise directions, with a pore diameter of 0.32 mm and centre-to-centre distances between neighbouring pores of 0.42 mm, were stacked. Forty-nine hollow fibres of poly-MMA were allowed to pass through each pore of these two porous plates. The distance between the two porous plates was 50 mm, and both ends were immobilized while the threads were stretched between them. The starting material for the resin was then made to flow into the hollow fibre array and allowed to harden. Polyurethane resin adhesives (Nippolan 4276, Coronate 4403; by Nihon Polyurethane Industry Co. Ltd, Shunan-shi, Japan) were used. The porous plates were removed after the resin hardened, producing the resin block containing hollow fibres.In the final step of the oligonucleotide synthesis, the reaction was performed using Aminolink II (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) to synthesize an oligonucleotide with aminated termini. The resulting GCAT oligo with aminated termini (50 µl, 500 nmol/ml), GMA (5 µl) and dimethylformamide (5 µl) were mixed, and the mixture was allowed to react at 70°C for 2 h before the addition of 190 µl of water. Thus, we obtained a GCAT oligo with 100 nmol/ml methacrylate groups (MA-GCAT). Subsequently, we prepared a starting solution for a gel comprise the monomer and the initiator with the following mass ratios: 9 parts acrylamide, 1 part N,N'-methylenebisacrylamide, 0.1 part 2,2'-azobis(2-methylpropionamidine)dihydrochloride (V-50) and 90 parts water. MA-GCAT was then added to the above solution to a final concentration of 0.5 nmol/l. The hollow portions of the hollow fibres in the resin block were filled with this solution, the block was transferred into a humidified hermetically sealed glass vessel, and the content of the vessel was allowed to polymerize at 70°C for 3 h. Thus, a block of hollow fibre array in which the hollow portion was impregnated with gel was obtained. This block was sliced to a thickness of 500 µm in a direction perpendicular to the direction of fibres.2.3. Preparation of infectant and autoimmunity arraysThe infectant Genopal™ probe (iGp) array were comprise 60 nucleotides (nts) from the genome sequences of 40 types of infectious bacteria and viruses (Supplementary Table S1), taking into consideration the specificity, melting temperature, GC content (40–60%) and secondary structure predicted with ProbeQuest software (Dynacom Co., Chiba, Japan). The generated synthetic DNA oligonucleotides were installed onto a Genopal™ platform to keep them immobilized in the hydrophilic gel within the three-dimensional space of each hollow fibre (Mitsubishi Rayon Co. Ltd). To prepare autoimmunity Genopal™ probe (aGp) array, 216 genes were selected based on their relevance to autoimmune diseases (Supplementary Fig. S2A and Table S2), 65 nt Genopal™ probes with similar annealing temperatures were designed, and the oligonucleotides were synthesized and installed onto the Genopal™ platform. Here, we also considered the melting temperature, GC content, specificity, secondary structure and low complexity of the sequences, which were primarily located within 1000 bases of the 3' end of mRNA sequences.2.4. RNA isolationTotal RNA from fresh PBMCs of patients and pooled healthy volunteers (HV pools) was isolated using the PAXgene Blood RNA Kit and RNeasy Mini Kit with the optimal on-column DNase digestion, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen KK, Hilden, Germany). The quality of the RNA samples used for the microarray analysis was examined using the RNA 6000 Nano LabChip Kit (p/n 5067-1511) on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (G2938C; Agilent Technologies Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA).2.5. Microarray analysis on Genopal™Hybridizations on the infectant and autoimmunity arrays were carried out in 150 µl of hybridization buffer (0.12 M Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 0.12 M NaCl, 0.05% Tween-20 and the indicated amount of antisense-oligonucleotides or 1125 ng of cRNA) at 65°C overnight or for the indicated times (for time-course measurements; Supplementary Fig. S1B) in a Genopal™-specific hybridization chamber (Mitsubishi Rayon Co. Ltd). After hybridization, the Genopal™ arrays were washed twice in 0.12 M Tris–HCl (pH 7.5), 0.12 M NaCl and 0.05% Tween-20 at 65°C for 20 min, followed by washing in 0.12 M Tris–HCl (pH 7.5), 0.12 M NaCl at room temperature for 10 min. The Genopal™ array was then scanned, and the image was captured using a cooled charge-coupled device type Microarray Image Analyzer equipped with multibeam excitation technology (Yokogawa Electric Co., Tokyo, Japan). For infectant array data, Microsoft Excel was used to calculate the coefficient of variation (CV) between arrays, between scans and between sections. For autoimmunity array data, signal intensities were processed by Subio Basic Plug-in (v1.6; Subio Inc., Aichi, Japan) as follows. First, all values <1 were replaced by 1 and log2 transformed. Next, ratios against intensities of the HV pools were calculated. Processed signals from 13 TA samples were averaged by 216 genes to generate a reference TA profile. Finally, the Spearman rank correlation between each sample and the reference TA profile by R were calculated. The details of the microarray data have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo) database (accession number GSE18247).2.6. Data analysis of aGp arrayWe obtained raw data by measuring the signal intensity with exposure time of 0.1, 1.0, 4.0, 40 and 120 s. Then, we calculated the values of average, median and standard deviation (SD) for 216 probe and 12 blank wells (background). In most cases, the subtracted value (median value of 216 probes minus median value of background) exceeded the SD value of background. Thus, we employed it as the expression value. If not, we employed the median value of background as the expression value.2.7. Microarray analysis on Agilent's microarrayMicroarray analyses were performed as two-colour hybridizations as described previously.11 Total RNAs obtained from PBMCs were independently reverse transcribed using oligo-dT primers containing the T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence to generate cDNAs, which were then subjected to in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase to label the cRNAs with Cy3-CTP or Cy5-CTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ, USA) using a Fluorescent Linear Amplification Kit (Agilent Technologies Inc.). Purified Cy5-labelled cRNAs (825 ng) from TA patients were then mixed with an equal amount of reverse-colour Cy3-labelled cRNAs from HV pools. Hybridizations, washing, scanning and gene analysis with Agilent's Whole Human Genome Microarray 4 × 44K G4112F were conducted according to the manufacturer's protocol (Agilent Technologies Inc.). Agilent Feature Extraction software (v. 9.5.1) was used to assess spot quality and extract feature intensity statistics. The Subio Platform and the Subio Basic Plug-in (v1.6; Subio Inc.) were then used to calculate the log ratio of rProcessedSignal over gProcessedSignal (HV pools). The details of the microarray data have been deposited in the GEO (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo) database (accession number GSE18245). Genopal™ and Agilent's Whole Human Genome Microarray 4 × 44K data reported in this paper have been also deposited as superSeries GSE18316.2.8. Expression profiling using quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction and nCounter™ analysesAssay-on-Demand TaqMan probes with relevant primers were used for quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis using the ABI PRISM 7900 according to the manufacturer's instructions (PE Applied Biosystems). Total RNA (500 ng) obtained using the PAXgene Blood RNA Kit was reverse transcribed with the High Capacity cDNA Archive Kit (ABI). PCR consisted of an initial denaturation (95°C, 10 min) followed by 40 cycles of denaturation (95°C, 15 s) and annealing/extension (60°C, 1 min). A standard curve was generated from the amplification data for each primer using a dilution series of PBMC RNA as the template. Fold-change values were normalized to GAPDH expression levels using the standard curve method according to the manufacturer's protocol. Measurements performed using nCounter™ were conducted by NanoString Technologies Inc. (Seattle, WA, USA).3. Results3.1. Basic design of the Genopal™ hollow fibre arrayTo provide a useful, focused microarray system for RNA diagnostics, we developed a novel platform termed Genopal™, which is comprise a hollow fibre array (Fig. 1). Different from typical glass slide DNA microarrays, which harbour two-dimensionally captured oligonucleotide probes attached to a solid surface, such as glass, Genopal™ consists of hollow gel-filled fibres in which oligonucleotides are uniquely embedded in a three-dimensionally arranged manner (Fig. 1A). The gel, which consists of copolymers containing 25 mol % vinyl groups (Fig. 1B), are firmly adhered to the inner walls of the hollow fibres via the introduction of comb polymers (Fig. 1C). Moreover, thin slices obtained by bundling these hollow fibres and then slicing the bundle exhibited sufficient adhesion between the gel and the inner walls of the hollow fibres (Fig. 1D). A full description of this platform is available online at http://www.mrc.co.jp/genome/e/index.html.Genopal™ offers a number of advantages in terms of its low-cost, ease of storage, speed and convenience compared with other microarray devices. First, it generates hybridization signals that are suitable for high-precision analysis. The oligonucleotides embedded in Genopal™ are maintained in wet conditions throughout all steps of the experiment, even during scanning, thereby allowing for rapid and easy microarray assay. Second, it produces a large number of microarrays with comparable quality, because the hollow fibres bundled into a single resin block are sliced perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the fibres; this property is particularly advantageous for mass production at low cost when commercialized as a clinical tool for RNA diagnostics, reducing the cost down to nearly 10% of the conventional microarrays. Third, it is durable, robust and portable, as the sliced and packaged Genopal™ microarrays are maintained under wet conditions. The comb polymer, in particular, prevents the gel from detaching from the inner walls at the time of slicing or during procedures such as hybridization and washing.3.2. Preparation and testing of an infectant arrayTo examine the quality of the Genopal™ platform, a focused DNA microarray termed the ‘infectant array’ was designed based on 40 genes (probes) from infectious bacteria and viruses. To design the microarray probes, oligonucleotides 60 nts in length were selected from the genome sequence of each infectant, taking into consideration the melting temperature, GC content, specificity and secondary structure (Supplementary Table S1). The probes were then chemically synthesized and integrated into four independent sections of the Genopal™ gel to test reproducibility of the assay (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Henceforth, we will refer to each 60 nt oligonucleotide as an iGp and each Genopal™ array with these probes as an iGp array. In parallel, antisense DNA (60 nts) was synthesized for use as target DNA corresponding to each iGp and labelled with a fluorescent dye (Cy5) for efficient detection when hybridized with the infectant array (Fig. 2A). iGp array set-up and data analysis. (A) Experimental design for the use of the iGp array. Each iGp array harboured four identical sets of 40 iGps that contained oligonucleotides (60 nt) corresponding to various infectious bacteria and viruses (Supplementary Table S1). Cy5-labelled antisense DNA (60 nt) was used as a target sample that emitted fluorescent signals when hybridized with the iGps. (B) Scatter plot of averaged signal intensities (horizontal) versus the CV of overall variation (vertical). Four replicate samples were independently prepared for hybridization to four iGp arrays. Each array was scanned four times to obtain 64 measured values for each probe in total. The average signal intensities and CVs were calculated from these 64 values. For each 40 iGps (black diamonds), the CV of the overall 64 average signal intensities (%) was plotted against the original mean value of the calculated average signal intensities. The 75th, 50th and 25th percentile of the CVs (10.1, 11.6 and 11.9%) on the vertical axis and the 75th, 50th and 25th percentile of the average signal intensity (205 032.6, 191 424.1 and 185 480.5 arbitrary units) on the horizontal axis were calculated. (C) Quantification of the sources of variation in the replicated iGp array. Sources of variance between arrays, between scans and between sections, composed of array 1 to array 4, 1st scan to 4th scan, and section 1 to section 4, were calculated to be 44.7 ± 17.00, 17.3 ± 4.57 and 38.1 ± 16.44% as the percent overall variance, respectively.iGp array set-up and data analysis.

Four arrays, composed of four independent sections, were scanned four times each. In total, 64 measured values for each probe were analysed (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. S1A). The overall CV of signal intensities was very low (10.6% on average), indicating that the iGp array is a highly reproducible platform comparable with other existing microarray systems (Fig. 2B). Thus, the sources of variance were analysed in detail (Fig. 2C) and the largest source was between arrays (44.7%), as expected. The second largest source was between sections (38.1%), whereas variations between scans were slight (17.3%). Taken together, these results indicate that Genopal™ is a reliable platform for focused microarray that produces reproducible results from synthetic RNA samples.To examine whether the iGp array was reliable in terms of speed, it was determined whether the hybridization time, which is the most tedious step in any DNA array, could be shortened. Thus, the span of hybridization time was varied from 0.5 h to overnight and compared with the resulting signal intensities (Supplementary Fig. S1B). We found that a 120-s scan after hybridization for only 0.5 h yielded signals that were sufficiently strong for signal profiling, even though the signal was much reduced compared with that of overnight hybridization (Supplementary Fig. S1C). This result further supported the commercial usefulness of Genopal™.3.3. Preparation and testing of an autoimmunity arrayTo evaluate the clinical applicability of Genopal™, we designed an ‘autoimmunity array’ based on genes related to autoimmune diseases. For this purpose, we selected 133 autoimmunity-related genes that were previously identified as being up- or down-regulated in PBMCs from patients with various autoimmune diseases (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Table S2), such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE),11 idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP),11  rheumatoid arthritis (RA)12  and/or vasculitis.13  In addition, 12 genes from the group of PBMC-specific genes termed PREP (predominantly expressed in PBMC) genes, which are highly expressed in normal PBMCs but not in normal human fibroblasts,14  and 68 immunity-related genes known to be involved in immune regulation were also used. Genes for a-tubulin, ß-tubulin and GAPDH were used as control probes, but not as normalization probes (Fig. 3A). In total, 216 probes were selected, and 65 nt-long oligonucleotides were designed and synthesized from the mRNA sequence of each gene. These probes were termed aGp (Supplementary Table S2: aGp #1–216), and the Genopal™ array performed with these probes was called an aGp array. Probe design and execution of aGp arrays.

Each group is indicated by purple, green, red or blue sections, respectively. Among the autoimmunity-related genes, the numbers of up- or down-regulated genes in autoimmune diseases are shown in parenthesis (see the leftmost column of Supplementary Table S2 for details). The probe set of the aGp array is comprise one-third of experimental probes (data not shown) and two-thirds of genes associated with immunity. (B) Scatter plot of average signal intensities (horizontal) and CV (vertical) of the HV pool measured by the aGp array. RNA was extracted from the PBMCs of the HV pool and hybridized onto the aGp array. For 216 aGps on the aGp arrays, the CVs of the average signal intensities measured four times were plotted against the mean calculated average signal intensities. The 216 aGps are represented by grey diamonds. The average, 75th, 50th and 25th percentiles of the CVs (31.3, 22.5, 8.2 and 4.4%) on the vertical axis and the average, 75th, 50th and 25th percentiles of the average signal intensity (288.7, 49.3, 11.3 and 5.3) on the horizontal axis were calculated.Probe design and execution of aGp arrays.

Each hybridized aGp array was scanned four times to estimate the variability of the data. The average intensities of 54 of the 216 probes were greater than 50 arbitrary units (au), and the CVs of these probes were very small (median = 4.8%); this is surprising considering the high mRNA complexity of clinical samples. In contrast, the CVs of the rest of probes were larger (median was 14.7%), as expected (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that the aGp arrays also yielded reliable data, although aGp arrays that were hybridized with clinical mRNA samples showed lower intensities and larger CVs than iGp arrays that were hybridized with synthetic antisense DNAs.3.4. Application of the autoimmunity array to clinical samplesNext, an aGp array was applied to patient samples. Fluorescently labelled cRNAs were prepared using PBMCs collected from 13 patients suffering from TA, a rare autoimmune disease of the large arteries, and used as target samples. These patients (TA1–13) were under medical care (being treated with anti-inflammatory drugs such as steroids) and were clinically inactive (see Supplementary Table S3 for the patients’ morbid states). The 13 TA cRNA samples were hybridized to 13 aGp arrays to generate 13 biological replicates. Additionally, the TA aGp arrays were also tested with other autoimmune diseases such as Behçet's syndrome (BD), Churg–Strauss syndrome (CSS), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), malignant RA (MRA), polyarteritis nodosa (PN) and Wegener's granulomatosis (WG), as well as with normal volunteers (Nor) as comparable target samples (Supplementary Fig. S2) in order to determine whether the expression profiles of the 13 TA patients were specific and useful for the diagnosis of TA.To validate the reference TA profile described above by averaging 13 TA samples, the Spearman rank correlation for 216 aGp genes was calculated between each sample and the reference TA profile. Notably, all TA samples (TA1–13) were highly correlated (0.85 ± 0.04) with the TA reference (black circles in Fig. 4A). The maximum and the minimum values of the Spearman rank correlation were computed to be 0.91 and 0.77, respectively, revealing an extremely tight correlation between all TA samples (TA1–13). Moreover, as shown by grey and white symbols in the middle and the right areas of Fig. 4A, other patient samples showed conspicuously low Spearman's rank correlation coefficients (0.29 ± 0.12). This indicates that the aGp array is useful for the diagnosis of TA even if the patient's morbid state is inactive. Expression profiling with the aGp array.

The number of tested individuals is indicated in parentheses. Plots are grouped into eight autoimmune disease groups and a HV (Nor) group. All of the 13 TA patients (black circles) are highly correlated by the Spearman rank correlation (r = 0.85 ± 0.04), whereas other autoimmune disease groups and the HV pool group showed distinctively lower correlation coefficients (Nor, 0.24; BD, 0.23; CSS, 0.43; MPA, 0.26; MRA, 0.38; PN, 0.37; WG, 0.31).

The colour bar at the right side of the panel indicates the log2 ratio for each patient versus the HV pool sample. Line colours with intensity gradients indicate the mean values of relative expression: blue (down-regulation) corresponds to a log2 ratio -2, and crimson (up-regulation) corresponds to a log2 ratio 2 when each patient and HV pool are compared. Black lines signify genes that are 2-fold up- or down-regulated in at least 7 of the 13 TA patients compared to the HV pool sample (see Supplementary Table S4 for details).

Circle colours with intensity gradients indicate the mean value of the expression level: blue (down-regulation) corresponds to a signal intensity of 10, and crimson (up-regulation) corresponds to a signal intensity of 250 when the average value of the 13 TA patients and the HV pool are compared. Black circles signify genes that are 2-fold up- or down-regulated in at least 7 of the 13 TA patients compared with the HV pool sample (see Supplementary Table S4 for details).Expression profiling with the aGp array.

Black circles signify genes that are 2-fold up- or down-regulated in at least 7 of the 13 TA patients compared with the HV pool sample (see Supplementary Table S4 for details).Next, 34 genes were isolated that showed at least a 2-fold up-regulation and 25 genes that showed at least a 2-fold down-regulation in at least 7 of 13 TA patients (Supplementary Table S4). We also found that the expression profiles of 59 characteristic genes represented by line graphs in 13 TA, 17 BD, 4 CSS and 3 MPA patients distinguished TA from other autoimmune diseases. The black lines signifying genes that were 2-fold up- or down-regulated in at least 7 of the 13 TA patients randomly fluctuated in other patients (Fig. 4B). Because we did not normalize the aGp array data, systematic shifts in log-ratio distributions in proportion to the signal intensities were observed in the scatter plot (Fig. 4C). Nonetheless, these 59 genes formed distinctive groupings in terms of correlation across the 216 genes. Namely, up- or down-regulated genes (black circles in Fig. 4C) localized outside the diagonal bundles of dots (purple and crimson circles in Fig. 4C) over a wide range of intensities. In contrast, these 59 genes showed no obvious correlation patterns in other patient samples (data not shown).Notably, the aGp array has additional practical advantages for clinical use because the obtained data were found to be very stable after scanning, even without sealing or other direct countermeasures against exposure to ozone (Supplementary Fig. S3). Moreover, the background level of the data after 19–27 days were largely reduced compared with 1 day data, which confirmed the reliability of the data even with low signal intensity. Taken together, these results indicate that aGp arrays are clinically useful because they can clearly distinguish TA patient profiles from other patients by the Spearman rank correlation using all 216 probes.3.5. Comparison between aGp array, Agilent's microarray and qPCRNext, the performance of aGp arrays was compared with other tools to examine the variation of the expression patterns of the genes in the 13 TA patient samples. First, all TA samples (TA1–13) were applied to Agilent's Whole Human Genome Microarray (4 × 44K). DEFA3, interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-10 were selected for further analysis because they are known to be highly associated with various autoimmune diseases.14 When the expression profiles of each gene from aGp array, Agilent's microarray and qPCR are compared, represented by green, purple and blue lines, respectively, it is apparent that DEFA3 achieved almost complete correlation among the three measurement systems (Fig. 5A). This correlation is surprising considering the distinct sequences of the probes used in each measurement and further confirmed the reliability of the data obtained by aGp arrays. In contrast, IL-4 and IL-10 showed distinct expression patterns depending on the system (Fig. 5Bi and ii). Expression profiles of DEFA3 (A), IL-4 (Bi) and IL-10 (Bii) in the 13 TA patients. The vertical axis indicates the log2 ratio measured by qPCR–GAPDH (blue), aGp array (green) and Agilent's microarray (purple). The horizontal axis indicates the patient number.

(Bi and ii) The expression profiles of the IL-4 and IL-10 genes for the 13 TA patients were different between qPCR–GAPDH (blue), aGp array (green) and Agilent's microarray (purple).Notably, IL-4 and IL-10 were expressed at remarkably low levels compared with DEFA3 (indicated by arrows in Fig. 6A). The scatter plot of log signal intensities from the HV pool (horizontal) and patient TA8 (vertical) show that the signal intensities of IL-4 and IL-10 are considerably lower than that of DEFA3. In addition, the correlation coefficients of DEFA3 for the averaged signal intensities of the aGp array and Agilent's microarray against qPCR normalized to GAPDH (0.93 and 0.96) are significantly higher than those of IL-4 (-0.52 and 0.52) and IL-10 (0.12 and -0.06), respectively (Fig. 6B). The aGp array provides sufficient sensitivity for diagnostic application. (A) A scatter plot of the log of signal intensity of the HV pool versus patient TA8 is plotted along the horizontal and vertical axes, respectively. DEFA3, IL-4 and IL-10 genes are indicated by orange arrows. The attached colour bar indicates a relative intensity scale. (B) The correlation coefficients of the Genopal™ autoimmunity array and Agilent's microarray against qPCR are shown. The correlation coefficient of DEFA3 for both Genopal™ and Agilent's arrays was high. On the other hand, because the signal intensities of IL-4 and IL-10 were within two orders of magnitude, as shown in the columns on the right, the correlation coefficient of IL-4 or IL-10 is lower than DEFA3.The aGp array provides sufficient sensitivity for diagnostic application.

Comparison with nCounter™To investigate whether aGp or Agilent provided more reliable results, we employed nCounter™ by NanoString15 and measured the expression levels of 25 relevant genes (aGps) using one patient sample (TA8). The raw data revealed that the expression levels of IL-4 and IL-10 in this patient were very low and that 10 of the 25 genes were up-regulated more than 2-fold compared with the HV sample (green arrows in Supplementary Fig. S4). Comparison of the relative induction rates between aGp, Agilent and nCounter™ revealed that 12 of the 25 genes (yellow arrows in Fig. 7) had similar results in all three methods, whereas nCounter™ favoured aGp arrays (turquoise arrows) or Agilent (pink arrows) for three and the six genes, respectively. The other four genes (purple arrows) showed distinct results among these three methods. As both nCounter™ and qPCR favoured aGp arrays for IL-10 and Agilent for IL-4 (Supplementary Fig. S5), it is difficult to determine at present which microarray provided more reliable results. Taken together, these results led us to conclude that aGp arrays provide reliable data at a level similar to Agilent's microarray, particularly when the expression levels of the target gene are not very low.

DiscussionIn the present study, we describe a novel platform termed Genopal™ that is ideal for the preparation of focused microarray (Fig. 1). We first designed the iGp array, examined its performance using Cy5-labelled synthetic oligonucleotides as hybridization probes (Fig. 2A) and determined that it yielded highly reproducible data (Fig. 2B; CV was 10.6% on average). We also prepared the aGp array and tested their clinical applicability using RNA samples from a small volume of PBMCs obtained from TA patients (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Table S3). We do not exclude the usefulness of other genes that were not installed into the aGp array. Nonetheless, we showed that the aGp array is able to distinguish TA patient profiles from HVs and patients with other autoimmune diseases based on the Spearman rank correlation using all 216 probes (Fig. 4). Notably, this data-processing protocol is quite simple and extensible; all that is needed is to calculate the ratio of the Spearman rank correlation for the patients’ and HV pool samples. This protocol is useful only for analysis of small number of genes and cannot be applied to conventional genome-wide microarrays, which is another advantageous point of Genopal™. Comparison of the data obtained by an aGp array, Agilent's microarray, qPCR and nCounter™ indicated that these methods exhibited similar expression profiles with regard to target genes with high signal intensities (Figs 5–7).Using aGp arrays, we also identified here over 10 genes that were up- or down-regulated in almost all TA patients tested (Supplementary Table S4). Among the up-regulated genes, S100A8, S100A9 and S10012 are inflammation-related genes. This is not unexpected because TA is an autoimmune disease that involves enhanced inflammation of the aorta. The up-regulation of amphiregulin (AREG), which is a member of the epidermal growth factor family, may be related to the ventricular hypertrophy often observed in TA patients. Alternatively, it may be involved in the maintenance of inflammatory situations by inducing the proliferation of regulatory cells in these phenomena. Enhanced expression of IL-1 receptor, type II (IL-1R2), a decoy receptor that traps pro-inflammatory IL-1ß and does not initiate subsequent signalling events, may be due to a negative feedback response to the hyperactive inflammation in the aorta of TA patients (which results partially from steroid therapy). Defensins, which include DEFA3, are a family of microbicidal and cytotoxic peptides that are abundant in the granules of neutrophils and are thought to be involved in host Defence, which suggest the involvement of infection in the pathogenesis of TA. In contrast, interferon gamma (IFN-G) and interferon-induced genes (G1P2, IFI44, IFIT1, IFIT2 and IFI27) were down-regulated in many TA patients, which distinguish TA from SLE and ITP, as these genes are up-regulated in the latter autoimmune diseases. As there is no reliable diagnostic tool for TA at present, these genes may also be useful as diagnostic markers of the disease when used in combination with the Spearman rank correlation method described above.One of the practical applications of iGp and aGp arrays would be their use in the diagnosis of patients afflicted with fever of unknown origin (FUO). Our proposal is presented schematically in Supplementary Fig. S6. Namely, a 2-ml blood sample may be collected for every new FUO patient using PAXgene Blood RNA Kits of Quiagen, total RNA prepared, labelled with Cy5 and applied to an aGp array. As the aGp array harbours genes that are either up- or down-regulated in the PBMCs of several autoimmune diseases, such as SLE,11  ITP,11 RA12 and/or vasculitis,13 we expect to observe positive signals if the patient's FUO is related to any of these autoimmune diseases. In this case, the FUO patient may be directly referred to an autoimmune disease specialist to receive appropriate care. If the screen yielded negative results, other sample sources, such as phlegm and/or excrement, depending on the dubious infectants, may be collected for RNA preparation and screening using the iGp array. If a positive signal is detected, the patients could then be treated appropriately at the bedside. Recent reports indicate that Genopal™ is useful not only for cRNA but also for miRNA samples.16–20Taken together, we conclude that Genopal™ is an advantageous platform for focused microarrays with regard to its low cost, reliability, ease of storage, speed and suitability for large-scale production. The data-processing protocol we developed here might be quite useful for the diseases that lack diagnostic tools using conventional clinical methods.Supplementary DataSupplementary Data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.Authors’ contributionsD.O. and T.F. designed and performed research, T.T. performed research on the infectant array, T.I. and S.K. provided TA patient samples and monitored the results, T.A. developed the Genopal™ system and H.N. designed the research and wrote the manuscript.

IntroductionGenetics in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and its wild relatives, including S. chilense, S. habrochaites, S. pimpinellifolium, and S. pennellii, have been greatly advanced since molecular markers have become available.1 During the past two decades, several genetic maps in tomato have been reported, with a total of more than 2000 loci detected by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS), and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers based on the mapping of populations derived from crosses between tomato and related wild species.2–6 Recently, 1282 novel SSR markers and 151 intronic polymorphic markers were mapped onto an interspecific map, ‘Tomato-EXPEN 2000’ derived from a cross between S. lycopersicum and S. pennellii.7 Such efforts have resulted in the identification of a number of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and genes for fruit morphology,8–11 disease resistance,12–15 and other agronomical traits.16 The identified genes, e.g. Cf-4, Tm-2, and Sw-5, have already been used for tomato breeding through advanced-backcross and introgression-line strategies using molecular markers.1 Though significant advances in molecular genetics and breeding have been reported in tomato, most of them were based on interspecific crosses because genetic diversity in the cultivated tomato is lower than in its wild relatives.17 Meanwhile, intraspecific maps are required to identify QTLs for agronomically important traits, which are the targets of practical breeding programs. However, only one intraspecific map, based on AFLP, RFLP, and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers, has been reported for S. lycopersicum.18Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most abundant source of variation in the genome for both intragenic and intergenic regions. They therefore represent a valuable basis for the development of molecular markers for identification of polymorphisms among closely related lines. Previous studies have suggested that DNA markers developed from intergenic regions tend to cluster in heterochromatic portions of chromosomes, while those derived from genic regions disperse along entire chromosomes.7,19–22 Therefore, SNPs, especially those located in intragenic regions, are expected to distribute randomly along the whole genome. In addition, novel techniques based on the DNA microarray method allow high-throughput SNP genotyping.23 For these reasons, SNP markers derived from intragenic regions are the most informative markers for genome-wide genetic analysis in intraspecific tomato populations. By comparing expressed sequence tags (ESTs) in tomato and related wild species, approximately 40 000 candidate SNPs have been identified.24–27 Since then, the number of ESTs derived from several tomato cultivars has increased to approximately 300 000, all of which are available in the public DNA databases, e.g. DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ: http://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/), Sol Genomics Network (SGN: http://solgenomics.net/), and MiBASE (http://www.pgb.kazusa.or.jp/mibase/).The tomato is regarded as a model plant not only for the Solanaceae but also for other fruiting plants.28 A miniature dwarf cultivar, ‘Micro-Tom’, originally bred for home gardening purposes,29 has drawn attention as a model tomato line because of its small plant size, short life cycle, easy transformation, and availability of transposon-tagging systems for use in reverse genetics.30 Various genomic and genetic resources have been developed for ‘Micro-Tom’. These include mutagenized lines,31,32 effective transformation systems,33,34 metabolite annotations,35 full-length cDNAs,36 and BAC-end sequences (Asamizu et al., released in the public DNA database with accession numbers: FT227487–FT321168). ‘Micro-Tom’ seeds are available through two seed stock centers: the Tomato Genetics Resource Center at the University of California, Davis (USA, accession no. LA3911) and the National Bio-Resource Project at the University of Tsukuba (Japan, accession no. TOMJPF00001).In this study, we developed SNP markers using publicly available ESTs from several tomato cultivars and designed an SNP-genotyping platform using the GoldenGate® assay (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) in order to accelerate genetic studies and molecular breeding in tomato. SNP markers, along with SSR markers and intronic polymorphic markers, which were developed and mapped onto the interspecific map Tomato-EXPEN 2000 by Shirasawa et al.,7 were applied to create linkage maps using two mapping populations derived from crosses between ‘Micro-Tom’ and ‘Ailsa Craig’, a greenhouse-type tomato, and between ‘Micro-Tom’ and ‘M82’, a processing tomato. In addition, the polymorphism of the SNP markers was investigated in cultivated tomato lines in order to estimate the transferability of the SNPs to breeding materials.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materialsTwo F2 mapping populations, AMF2 and MMF2, each derived by crossing two S. lycopersicum lines, were used for the construction of the linkage maps. AMF2 (n = 120) was derived from a cross between the ‘Ailsa Craig’ and ‘Micro-Tom’ lines, while MMF2 (n = 135) was derived from a cross between the ‘M82’ and ‘Micro-Tom’ lines. AMF2 and MMF2 were generated in the National Institute of Vegetable and Tea Science, Japan, and in the Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique, France, respectively (Table 1). To address potential residual heterozygosity in the parental ‘Micro-Tom’ lines used to create AMF2 and MMF2, they are distinguished in this study by the designations ‘Micro-Tom_AM’ and ‘Micro-Tom_MM’, respectively. Along with the four parental lines of the mapping populations, 22 lines, including 16 inbred and 6 hybrid tomato lines, and an S. pennellii line (‘LA716’) were used for polymorphic analysis of SNPs (Table 1). Total DNA for each line was extracted using the DNeasy Plant Mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).

Development of SNP markers and polymorphic analysisA total of 229 086 EST sequences from S. lycopersicum, retrieved from two public databases, SGN (http://solgenomics.net/) and MiBASE (http://www.pgb.kazusa.or.jp/mibase/), were used for identification of eSNPs, i.e. SNPs discovered in silico. The ESTs registered in MiBASE were derived only from ‘Micro-Tom’, while those registered in SGN were developed from 19 tomato lines including ‘Micro-Tom’. The retrieved EST sequences were assembled using the MIRA program.37 The eSNPs were then selected according to the following three criteria: (i) only nucleotides with Phred scores of 15 or more were considered candidates for eSNPs, (ii) a nucleotide at an eSNP site should be identical among multiple sequences within a given line, and (iii) no other SNP candidates should be detected on the flanking sequences 10 bp upstream and downstream of a given candidate.In order to validate the credibility of the identified eSNP, nucleotide sequences of PCR products containing the eSNP regions were determined by direct sequencing using a DNA sequencer (ABI-3730xl, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). A total of 82 primer pairs were designed in flanking regions of the randomly selected target eSNPs using the Primer3 program.38 PCR was performed for 17 tomato lines listed in Table 1 in a 5-µl reaction mixture containing 0.5 ng genomic DNA, 1× PCR buffer (Bioline, London, UK), 3 mM MgCl2, 0.04 U BIOTAQ™ DNA polymerase (Bioline), 0.2 mM dNTPs, and 0.8 µM of each of the primers. The modified ‘touchdown PCR’ protocol was used as described previously.39After validation of the 82 eSNPs, a total of 1536 eSNPs were subjected to polymorphic analysis for the two mapping populations and the 23 tomato lines described above using the GoldenGate® assay system (Illumina). Allele- and locus-specific oligonucleotides were designed from the flanking sequences of the 1536 SNP sites using the iCom website (https://icom.illumina.com/). Polymorphic analysis of the SNPs was performed according to the standard protocol of the GoldenGate® assay, and the data analysis was performed using GenomeStudio Data Analysis software (Illumina).SNPs in DWARF (D) and SELF-PRUNING (SP) were analyzed using the dCAPS and CAPS methods, respectively. PCR was performed under the same conditions as described above. The primer sequences are shown in Supplementary Table S1. The PCR products from the D and SP genes were digested with PstI and MvaI, respectively, and were subjected to electrophoresis on native 10% polyacrylamide gels in 1× TBE buffer. The resulting DNA bands were then stained with ethidium bromide.2.3. Mapping of SSR and intronic polymorphic markers on AMF2A total of 3510 tomato genomic SSR (TGS), 2047 tomato EST-SSR (TES), and 166 tomato EST-derived intronic polymorphic (TEI) markers, developed by Shirasawa et al.,7 were used for segregation analysis of the AMF2 population (Supplementary Table S1). The polymorphic analyses of the markers were performed as described previously.7 Primer information for the tested markers is available at http://www.kazusa.or.jp/tomato/.2.4. Linkage analysisLinkage analysis was performed using the JoinMap® program, version 4.40 The segregated data were classified into 12 linkage groups, which corresponded to the Tomato-EXPEN 2000 map,7 using the grouping module of JoinMap® with LOD scores of 4.0–10.0. The marker order and relative genetic distances were calculated by the regression-mapping algorithm with the following parameters: Haldane's mapping function, recombination frequency =0.35, and LOD score =2.0.3. Results3.1. In silico SNP mining and validationA total of 170 586 and 58 500 EST sequences available in SGN and MiBASE, respectively, along with data on their quality, were used for in silico SNP mining. The name of the original tomato line for each EST was obtained from the DDBJ database (http://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/). In total, 229 086 ESTs derived from 20 tomato cultivars, the average length of which was 497 bp, were used for assembly (Table 2). Number of ESTs and their original sources used for assemblingaNames of tomato lines used for EST generation.Number of ESTs and their original sources used for assemblingaNames of tomato lines used for EST generation.Assembly was performed using nucleotides with Phred scores =15. As a result, a total of 20 274 contigs, the average length of which was 775 bp, and 29 698 singletons were generated. From initial alignment data from all 20 274 contigs, a total of 5607 eSNP sites were identified in 2634 of these contigs (Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). We gave an SNP code to each eSNP according to the following rule: contig name and position of the eSNP on the contig, linked with an underscore, e.g. the 112th position on contig 2758 was given the following SNP code: 2758_112.Before designing the SNP genotyping platform (using the Illumina GoldenGate® assay), 82 randomly selected eSNPs were tested in 17 tomato lines (Table 1) by direct sequencing of fragments amplified by PCR. As a result, 55 (67%) out of the 82 examined eSNP candidates were experimentally confirmed as SNPs at the predicted positions, indicating that approximately 67% of the 5607 eSNPs detected in silico represent true SNPs in the tomato lines used in the present study. In addition, 40 (49%) and 50 (61%) of the 82 eSNPs segregated between the two mapping parents for AMF2 and MMF2, respectively.For SNP genotyping, a total of 1536 SNPs were selected from the 5607 eSNPs, as follows: (i) one eSNP was selected from each contig and the Selected-BAC-Mixture contig released from the Kazusa Tomato SBM & Marker Database (http://www.kazusa.or.jp/tomato/); (ii) an SNP score of more than 0.6, as determined by the iCom website of Illumina (https://icom.illumina.com/), was required for each of these eSNPs. As reported by the GoldenGate® assay, 1338 (87%) out of the 1536 SNPs could be properly genotyped in the 279 plants. These included the two mapping populations (AMF2 and MMF2) and 23 other tomato lines. The remaining 198 (13%) eSNPs failed to be genotyped because fluorescent signals for these eSNPs did not form clusters pursuant to the criteria required by the GenomeStudio Data Analysis software (Illumina).3.2. Mapping of SNP, SSR, and intronic markersIn the AMF2 population, 648 of the 1338 available SNPs (48.4%) generated segregation data, a similar ratio to that determined in the validation of the 82 eSNPs. Two SNP markers designed in the D and SP genes, for which ‘Micro-Tom’ has mutant alleles,41 showed polymorphism between ‘Ailsa Craig’ and ‘Micro-Tom’. Along with the SNP markers, a total of 5723 previously reported markers, including 2047 EST-SSR (TES), 3510 genomic-SSR (TGS), and 166 intronic (TEI) markers, were used for the polymorphic analysis. As a result, 96 TES (4.7%), 223 TGS (6.3%), and 28 TEI (16.8%) markers exhibited polymorphism between the parental lines. In total, 997 markers were used to construct the AMF2 linkage map.In the MMF2 population, 640 of the 1338 available SNPs (47.9%) segregated. This ratio was over 10% less than that determined in the validation of the 82 eSNPs, suggesting that the result of the eSNP validation was overestimated. The SNP on the D gene showed polymorphism in the MMF2 mapping population, while two parental lines detected the mutated sp allele for the SP gene. In total, 641 segregated markers were used to construct the MMF2 map.3.3. Construction of linkage mapsFor AMF2, a total of 989 of the 997 segregated loci (99.2%) formed 12 linkage groups (LGs), while 637 of the 641 segregated loci (99.4%) formed 13 linkage groups for MMF2. The total sizes of the LGs of the AMF2 and MMF2 maps were 1467.8 and 1422.7 cM, respectively (Table 3, Fig. 1, Supplementary Table S1). Combining the two maps yielded a total of 1137 markers, including 793 SNP, 221 TGS, 93 TES, 28 TEI, and 2 gene markers, located on the intraspecific map. Among these, 488 SNP markers were commonly located on both linkage maps, while 157 and 148 marker loci were specific to the AMF2 map and the MMF2 map, respectively. Chromosome 7 (Chr07) of MMF2 divided into two linkage groups, Chr07p and Chr07q, which were located at the upper and the lower portions, respectively, of Chr07 of Tomato-EXPEN 2000. The average lengths of the intervals between two loci on the AMF2 and the MMF2 maps were calculated to be 1.5 and 2.2 cM, respectively. Length, number of mapped loci, and segregation distortion of the AMF2 and MMF2 mapsaChr07 of the MMF2 were divided into two linkage groups, Chr07p and Chr07q. The numbers indicate total value of two linkage groups.Length, number of mapped loci, and segregation distortion of the AMF2 and MMF2 mapsaChr07 of the MMF2 were divided into two linkage groups, Chr07p and Chr07q.

The left bar represents a linkage map of Tomato-EXPEN 2000, which is an interspecific map constructed in our previous study.7 The lines on each linkage group show SNP (green), TGS (red), TES (blue), TEI (yellow), and the other available (black) markers. Common markers between two maps are connected with black lines. Boxes on the Tomato-EXPEN 2000 map indicate heterochromatic regions. Detailed information on the markers, including marker positions, is shown in Supplementary Table S1, and is also available at http://www.kazusa.or.jp/tomato/.Intraspecific linkage maps for tomato. The middle and right bars of each linkage group represent maps of the AMF2 and MMF2 lines, respectively.

Detailed information on the markers, including marker positions, is shown in Supplementary Table S1, and is also available at http://www.kazusa.or.jp/tomato/.Segregation distortions were observed in the two maps. In the AMF2 map, 9.8% of the marker loci showed segregation distortions, ranging from 0.0% for Chr01, Chr08, and Chr12, to 55.4% for Chr11 (Table 3). In the MMF2 map, 5.3% of the marker loci were distorted, ranging from 0.0% for Chr05 and Chr08, to 17.0% for Chr09 (Table 3). The linkage groups harboring severe segregation distortions were different between the two mapping populations, especially between Chr11 of AMF2 (55.4%) and that of MMF2 (2.3%), suggesting Chr11 of ‘Ailsa Craig’ might have transmission ratio distorters.3.4. Polymorphic analysis of the SNP markers in tomato cultivars and S. pennelliiA total of 916 (68.5%) out of the 1338 SNP markers showed polymorphisms in at least one line among the 27 tomato lines listed in Table 1 (Supplementary Table S4). The polymorphic ratio was similar to the ratio determined during the PCR-based validation of the 82 eSNPs. In ‘LA719’ (S. pennellii) and ‘Sweet 100’, no data were obtained for 229 (17.1%) and one SNP markers, respectively. The polymorphic ratios differed according to the combination of tomato lines (Fig. 2), and the number of segregated SNPs between any two lines among the 27 lines was 255.0 (19.1%) on average. A total of 608.2 SNPs (45.5%) were identified between ‘Micro-Tom’ and the other inbred lines, on average, while only 80.8 SNPs (6.0%) were identified among the 17 inbred tomato lines. Within the 17 inbred tomato lines, ‘M82’ showed the highest number of polymorphisms: 176.3 SNPs (13.2%) on average, which was twice as high as that of the other lines. SNPs between the F1 hybrid cultivars and the inbred lines were found at 190.6 loci (14.2%) on average. The two cherry-type tomato cultivars showed higher polymorphisms than the inbred tomato lines, with 310.1 (23.2%) SNPs on average. When 26 S. lycopersicum lines were compared with S. pennellii, on average, 618.5 out of the 1338 loci (46.2%) were polymorphic. Heterozygosity was observed at multiple SNP sites in all six F1 hybrid cultivars, ranging from 69 (5.2%) in ‘Matrix’ to 229 (17.1%) in ‘Sweet 100’. In the inbred line ‘Rio Grande’, 25 (1.9%) heterozygous SNPs were identified. Number of SNP markers identified by the GoldenGate® assay among 27 tomato and S. pennellii lines. The numbers show the loci of the 1338 SNPs genotyped in this study. The colors in each cell represent a continuum of polymorphic ratios: lower ratios are represented by green color, higher ratios by red color, and middle ratios by yellow color.Number of SNP markers identified by the GoldenGate® assay among 27 tomato and S. pennellii lines. The numbers show the loci of the 1338 SNPs genotyped in this study. The colors in each cell represent a continuum of polymorphic ratios: lower ratios are represented by green color, higher ratios by red color, and middle ratios by yellow color.It is noteworthy that 136 SNPs (10.2%) were identified between ‘Micro-Tom_AM’ and ‘Micro-Tom_MM’, the parental lines of AMF2 and MMF2, respectively (Fig. 2). Out of these 136 SNP loci, 134 mapped onto the AMF2 and/or the MMF2 maps, mainly on Chr04 (44 loci), Chr07 (38 loci), and Chr12 (36 loci) (Supplementary Table S1). ‘Micro-Tom_AM’ had a higher number of polymorphisms, in comparison with the other 25 examined lines, than ‘Micro-Tom_MM’ (Fig. 2). For example, 738 loci (55.2%) showed polymorphisms between ‘Micro-Tom_AM’ and ‘M82’, while only 640 SNPs (47.8%) were found between ‘Micro-Tom_MM’ and ‘M82’. It is likely that this difference resulted in an overestimation of the number of segregated loci between ‘Micro-Tom’ and ‘M82’ in the 82-eSNP PCR-based validation.4. DiscussionTo our knowledge, the two genetic linkage maps presented here are the first intraspecific maps for S. lycopersicum with SNPs and other PCR-based co-dominant markers. The AMF2 and MMF2 genetic linkage maps comprise a total of 989 and 637 DNA marker loci, respectively, including SNP, SSR, and intron polymorphic and gene markers. Because the SNP markers developed in this study showed a higher degree of polymorphism among the tomato cultivars than SSR markers, SNP information is greatly important to be utilized for genetic analyses in cultivated tomato, including gene mapping, QTL analysis, population genetics, and marker-assisted breeding. In addition, the genomic tools developed in this study will be valuable for exploiting the extensive artificially induced genetic variability created by ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS) mutagenesis in ‘Micro-Tom’ mutant collections. For example, they could allow, by forward genetic approaches, the identification of the causal mutations for remarkable fruit and plant phenotypes.In the SNP genotyping by the GoldenGate® assay, 1338 (87%) of the 1536 SNPs could be successfully genotyped. In other crops, successful ratio of SNP genotyping by the GoldenGate® assay is reported to be raging from 79 to 92%,42–45 which fits to the result of the present study. In order to improve the ratio, we suggest additional three criteria to select SNPs for genotyping. The first is elimination of SNP positioned near junction site of intron and exon, because intron inhibits hybridization of allele- and locus-specific oligonucleotide to the target sequence based on EST. It can be achieved by comparing the sequences of EST with those of genome, if available. Next is avoidance designing SNP markers on multi-copy genes, which disrupts the fluorescent-signal clusters on the GenomeStudio Data Analysis software. Selection of accurate SNP site, e.g. with high-quality value and/or with highly coverage of sequence fragments, is also important. Large scale of genome analysis by massively parallel DNA sequencers would be convenient to overcome these matters.In interspecific linkage maps of tomato and its relatives, markers derived from ESTs tend to distribute randomly along the genome, while markers derived from random genomic regions, e.g. RAPD, AFLP, and genomic SSRs, tend to form clusters in heterochromatic regions.7,19–22 In this study, however, the marker loci did not disperse along the two linkage maps derived from AMF2 and MMF2, despite the fact that most markers were developed from ESTs. Comparison between the maps of Tomato-EXPEN 2000 and the two intraspecific mapping populations did not indicate any evidence of an obvious relationship between the marker clusters on the maps and chromosome structures, i.e. the heterochromatic and euchromatic regions (Fig. 1). It can be assumed that the marker clusters correspond to probable integration regions originating from ‘Lycopersicon minutum’, an ancestral line of ‘Micro-Tom’,29 which belongs to the S. chmielewskii and S. neorickii complex.46 Such regions are expected to show higher frequencies of polymorphism than the other regions, which originate from cultivated lines.Out of the 989 SNP markers on the AMF2 map, 489 were located on the two intraspecific maps generated in this study and 155 had already been located on the interspecific map generated from Tomato-EXPEN 2000.7 The common markers for the three maps allow the alignment and connection of these maps as shown in Fig. 1. Significant translocation and inversion of chromosome were not observed between intra- and interspecific maps, meaning the order of genes would be conserved in two species, and the genome sequence of tomato (S. lycopersicum) could be used as a reference genome of S. pennellii. In addition, it is likely that the AMF2 and MMF2 maps cover the whole tomato genome except for the middle part of Chr07 on the MMF2 map, and that the marker order is mostly conserved in the three maps. One possible approach to connecting the two linkage groups of Chr07 on the MMF2 map would be to develop a novel mapping population between ‘M82’ and ‘Micro-Tom_AM’ instead of ‘Micro-Tom_MM’ because SNPs on Chr07 segregated more frequently between ‘M82’ and ‘Micro-Tom_AM’.Indeed, we found that 136 of the 1338 tested SNP markers (10.2%) showed polymorphisms between ‘Micro-Tom_AM’ and ‘Micro-Tom_MM’ (Fig. 2), indicating possible residual heterosis in ‘Micro-Tom’. It is assumed that these loci had not been fixed at the time of ‘Micro-Tom’ being released, although ‘Micro-Tom’ seeds are propagated and distributed in the F12 generation after a crossing.29 Theoretically, the heterozygosity of genome in the F12 generation is calculated to be 0.05% [=(1/2)12-1] in self-pollinating plants, which means that most of the genomic regions are expected to be homozygous. Most of the polymorphic markers between the two ‘Micro-Tom’ lines were mapped on Chr04, Chr07, and Chr12. This result suggested that ‘Micro-Tom’ might have been bred under natural and/or artificial selection pressure from the regions under the influence of heterosis or crossing incompatibilities between S. lycopersicum and L. minutum. Alternatively, multiple lines might have been selected as ‘Micro-Tom’ from the breeding population before the complete fixation of the genotypes of each plant.Though ‘Micro-Tom’ itself, bred as an ornamental plant, has little agricultural value, its genes may be of great value to agriculture. ‘Micro-Tom’ has resistance to several diseases, caused by Alternaria alternata, Corynespora cassiicola, Fusarium oxysporum, and Pseudomonas syringae.47 Moreover, a large number of mutant lines have been developed using ‘Micro-Tom’.31,32 The markers and maps developed in this study may therefore be useful for introgression breeding for disease resistance or targeted genes identified in ‘Micro-Tom’ or its mutant lines. Indeed, ‘Micro-Tom’ mutant lines carry mutated alleles that may confer high agricultural value to tomato, e.g. alleles causing large variations in fruit color, shape, size, and composition. Mutants may also help to decipher the mechanisms controlling specific traits in tomato.In this study, we demonstrated the validity of the strategy of combining large-scale eSNP discovery with high-throughput SNP genotyping assays. Comparison of sequence data from tomato cultivars has been reported as an efficient strategy for developing a large number of SNP markers for tomato cultivars.24,48,49 Today, extensive amounts of sequence data from crop genomes can be easily collected using massively parallel DNA sequencers.50 In addition, genomic sequences from The International Tomato Genome Sequencing Consortium of SGN will soon become available.51 The accumulating genome sequences can be used to develop custom SNP markers within cultivated tomato. The molecular markers and genetic linkage maps developed in the present study represent one of the initial milestones in the fusion of genomics, genetics, and molecular breeding in cultivated tomato.Supplementary dataSupplementary Data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.AvailabilityInformation on the SNP and SSR markers, the AMF2 and MMF2 linkage maps, and the SNP genotypes for the tomato lines investigated in the current study are available at http://www.kazusa.or.jp/tomato/.FundingThis work was supported by the Kazusa DNA Research Institute Foundation and the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries of Japan with the cooperation of the Genomics for Agricultural Innovation Foundation (DD-4010).We are grateful to Dr K.

IntroductionAmong many filamentous bacteria belonging to the phylum Actinobacteria, Streptomyces species have been extensively studied because of the ability to produce various bioactive secondary metabolites and the complex process of morphological differentiation. The life cycle of Streptomyces is initiated by the germination of spores that develop into vegetative mycelia. In response to environmental signals, aerial mycelia emerge from the colony surface and differentiate into chains of spores. Many pioneering works about the regulation of secondary metabolism and differentiation of Streptomyces species were done using model organisms such as S. coelicolor A3(2) and S. griseus IFO 13350.1,2 The complete genome sequences of three Streptomyces species, S. coelicolor A3(2),3S. avermitilis MA-4680T4 and S. griseus IFO 13350,5 have been reported and further accelerated the studies. Kitasatospora setae is a soil-habiting mycelial bacterium belonging to the same family Streptomycetaceae. All 23 validly published species belonging to the genus Kitasatospora exhibit a similar life style and morphology with Streptomyces species. Kitasatospora may also be comparable with Streptomyces in its capacity to produce bioactive secondary metabolites. The type strain of K. setae, NBRC 14216T, is known to produce setamycin (bafilomycin B1) and bafilomycin A1, specific inhibitors of vacuolar ATPase and commonly used as biochemical reagents for investigation of molecular transport in eukaryotic cells. This genus also includes several other strains reported as producers of bioactive compounds including a proteasome inhibitor and an anti-fungal agent.6,7After the first proposal of the genus Kitasatospora (originally Kitasatosporia) by Omura et al. in 1982,8 the taxonomic position of Kitasatospora had been under a debate. It was once reclassified as a synonym of Streptomyces based on morphology and partial 16S rDNA analysis reported by Wellington et al.9 and Ochi and Hiranuma.10 Afterward, Zhang et al.11 reported that Streptomyces and Kitasatospora form distinct phyletic groups in the detailed inspection of the 16S rDNA and the 16S–23S rDNA internal spacer region and proposed the revival of the genus Kitasatospora. Such a history made Kitasatospora a suitable model for the development of methods distinguishing closely related species and genera based on the DNA sequence.12,13 Besides the molecular phylogenetic approach, there are clear phenotypic criteria to distinguish Kitasatospora from Streptomyces, of which most notable is the chemical composition of cell wall peptidoglycan.14,15 Cell wall peptidoglycan of streptomycetes contains the ll isomer of diaminopimelic acid (DAP), whereas many other sporoactinomycetes contain the meso isomer. The peptidoglycan of Kitasatospora, in contrast, contains both ll- and meso-DAP.16 In K. setae NBRC 14216T, aerial spores on solid culture and submerged spores in liquid culture both contain exclusively ll-DAP, whereas mycelia in both cultures contain mainly meso-DAP.14,15,17 This suggests that the composition of cell wall peptidoglycan would be regulated in Kitasatospora depending on differentiation stages. Many of the genes involved in the formation of aerial mycelium (bld genes and others) and sporulation (whi genes and others) have been identified by genetic analysis of Streptomyces species,1,2 but the genetic and molecular basis for the differential incorporation of DAP isomers in Kitasatospora raises new questions. Considering the unique taxonomic position of Kitasatospora, as well as the common and distinct features of Kitasatospora and Streptomyces, Kitasatospora would be a key microorganism for further understanding of the evolution of not only actinobacteria within the family Streptomycetaceae but also other mycelial actinobacteria.We determined the complete genome sequence of K. setae NBRC 14216T (=KM-6054T) and compared it with Streptomyces genomes. Although the overall topology and gene organization of the K. setae NBRC 14216T genome showed close resemblance to Streptomyces genomes, there are discriminative distances between them. We established a robust phylogenetic position of the genus Kitasatospora by multilocus phylogenetic analysis and confirmed the previous results based on 16S rDNA sequences. We also describe the conservation and variation of differentiation-related genes predicted from the annotation of K. setae NBRC 14216T genome, as well as the possible coding capacity of the genome for bioactive secondary metabolites.2. Materials and methods2.1. Genome sequencing, assembly and validationDNA shotgun libraries with average insert sizes of 1.6 and 6.5 kb were constructed in pUC118 (TaKaRa), whereas a fosmid library with average insert size of 37 kb was constructed in pCC1FOS (EPICENTRE) as described previously.18,19 A total of 50 400 clones (34 560, 10 752 and 5088 clones from libraries with 1.6, 6.5 and 37 kb inserts, respectively) were subjected to sequencing from both ends of the inserts on either ABI 3730xl DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) or Base Station DNA Fragment Analyzer BST-0100 (MJ Research, Inc.). Sequence reads were trimmed at a threshold quality value of 20 by Phred and assembled by Phrap and CONSED assembly tools.20,21 For alignment and validation of contigs, Optical Mapping (OpGen) was used. Gaps between contigs were closed by sequencing PCR products, which bridge two neighboring contigs. Finally, each base of K. setae NBRC 14216T genome was ensured to be sequenced from multiple clones and from both directions with Phrap quality score =70 or from one direction with Phrap quality score =40. Chromosomal terminus was determined after attaching adenine and thymine homopolymers to the naked 3' ends of the chromosome as described previously.52.2. Data analysis and annotationThe prediction of open reading frames (ORFs) was performed using Glimmer3.22 The initial set of ORFs was manually selected from the prediction result in combination with BLASTP23 and FramePlot24 results. Each ORF was annotated manually using in-house genome annotation system OCSS (unpublished). Similarity search results against Uniprot,25 Interpro26 and HAMAP27 databases were used for functional prediction. The KEGG28 database was used for the reconstruction of metabolic pathways. If necessary, annotation was confirmed by molecular phylogenetic analysis using ClustalW, NJplot or GARLI (http://www.bio.utexas.edu/faculty/antisense/garli/Garli.html). Putative transporters and peptidases were independently evaluated using TransportDB29 and MEROPS30 databases, respectively. Non-coding genes were predicted using the Rfam,31 tRNAscan-SE32 and ARAGORN33 programs. Putative oriC region was located using originx34 program. Putative ORFs related to mobile genetic elements were predicted and their boundaries were inferred with the assistance of GenomeMatcher35 software. For accurate assignment of orthologs from actinobacterial genomes, comparative data compiled in the MBGD36 database were used with further molecular phylogenetic evaluation, if necessary.2.3. Data and strain submissionThe nucleotide sequence of the K. setae NBRC 14216T genome has been deposited in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank databases under accession number AP010968. The annotated genome sequence is also available at the genome database DOGAN (http://www.bio.nite.go.jp/dogan/Top). The microbial strain and genomic DNA clones used for the sequencing are available through the NBRC (NITE Biological Resource Center, Chiba, Japan, http://www.nbrc.nite.go.jp/e/index.html).3. Results and discussion3.1. General features of the K. setae NBRC 14216T genomeThe K. setae genome was composed of a single linear chromosome of 8 783 278 bp with 127 148 bp of terminal inverted repeats (TIRs). These characteristics in the genome topology were similar to those of Streptomyces,3–5 although the microorganism does not harbor a linear or circular plasmid. The general features of the K. setae genome are summarized in Table 1 and Fig. 1. The chromosome was predicted to encode 74 tRNA genes, 9 copies of ribosomal RNA operon and 7569 protein-coding genes. Among the predicted protein-coding genes, 53.5% (4049 ORFs) were assigned putative functions. The average G + C content of the chromosome was 74.2%, which is among the highest in actinobacteria, being nearly equal to that of Kineococcus radiotolerans (http://genome.jgi-psf.org/finished_microbes/kinra/). The putative replication origin containing 20 DnaA box-like sequences was located at the center of the chromosome. This putative origin was flanked by dnaA and dnaN as in the cases of almost all bacteria, including Streptomyces species.37General features of K. setae NBRC 14216T genome and Streptomyces genomesaNumbers of best-hit pair between K. setae NBRC 14216T and each Streptomyces are calculated using BLASTP program with a threshold E-value of 1e-20.bOn the basis of the latest annotation data of S. avermitilis MA-4680T maintained by H.

As neither sequence variation nor assembly inconsistency was found in the terminal contig, we concluded that the chromosome has inverted identical sequences at both extremities. Terminal sequences of linear chromosomes and plasmids of Streptomyces and Rhodococcus can be classified into at least six groups. The terminal sequence of the K. setae chromosome was distinct from any of these groups; while the first 13 bp sequence exactly matched with that of major Streptomyces groups I and II (Supplementary Fig. S1), the subsequent region containing palindrome structures and loops, which are known in Streptomyces to be required for binding of telomere-associated protein (Tap), was not conserved.38,39 Tap and terminal protein (Tpg) encoding genes (KSE_73020 and KSE_73030) were detected in the K. setae chromosome with lower similarity (42–45% amino acid identity) to those of Streptomyces. Kitasatospora setae thus seems to have similar mechanisms for chromosome maintenance; it possesses a linear chromosome with TIRs, replicates bidirectionally from a centrally located oriC region and maintains terminal sequences by Tap and Tpg. However, the binding specificity of Tap might be different even from those recognizing group I and II replicons of Streptomyces.No critical difference was found between K. setae and Streptomyces species in the predicted primary metabolism such as carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid metabolism, nucleic acid metabolism and respiration. The numbers of other ubiquitous components, such as membrane transporters, peptidases, transcriptional regulators and sigma factors, were also almost equivalent to those of Streptomyces.3.2. Taxonomic reevaluation and comparative analysis of K. setae NBRC 14216TFrom morphological similarity and rDNA relatedness to Streptomyces species, genus Kitasatospora was once regarded as a synonym of Streptomyces.9 Although phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rDNA sequence usually separates Streptomyces and Kitasatospora species into distinct sister groups, the results sometimes depend on the choice of the outgroup11 or the region used for the alignment, depicting the difficulties in determining correct taxonomic relationships only from the nucleotide sequences of rDNA. In order to obtain a more robust measure of the taxonomic position of Kitasatospora by taking advantage of its genomic information, we performed a multilocus phylogenetic analysis using 31 conserved amino acid sequences. Ciccarelli et al.40 reported the construction of a tree of life across all three domains using 191 species including 14 actinobacteria. We adopted the same method by utilizing 58 actinobacterial genomes with the Escherichia coli genome as an outgroup (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). Amino acid sequences were aligned for each of the 31 conserved protein genes, and then all 31 alignments were concatenated and ambiguous portions were deleted before performing phylogenetic reconstruction. Figure 2 shows a phylogenetic tree obtained by the neighbor-joining method (a phylogenetic tree obtained by the maximum-likelihood method is shown in Supplementary Fig. S2). Relationships between major taxonomic groups were broadly consistent with the previous results obtained by 16S rDNA sequences. Within the phylogenetic tree, 82% of all predicted branches were supported by bootstrap proportions greater than 90% (i.e. 900 of 1000). Four Streptomyces species were grouped in the same branch, with S. griseus IFO 13350 branching out at the deepest position. Kitasatospora setae NBRC 14216T was placed within the same clan as Streptomyces creating the outermost branch. All these results were supported by bootstrap proportions of 100%, reinforcing the idea that the genera Kitasatospora and Streptomyces were generated from a common progenitor and have diverged into distinct sister groups. The closest to this group was Catenulispora acidiphila DSM 44928,41 a mycelial actinobacterium with a circular chromosome.

Names of the organisms mentioned in the text are shown in bold type.For further analysis of the relationship between K. setae and Streptomyces, we compared all annotated proteins of K. setae and four Streptomyces species. More than half of ORFs predicted in K. setae had orthologs (reciprocal best-hit pairs) in each of four Streptomyces species using a BLASTP threshold of E < 10-20 (Table 1). About 34% of K. setae ORFs had orthologs in all four Streptomyces genomes. The average amino acid identity between orthologous pairs from K. setae and Streptomyces species was around 60%. Despite such high similarities observed between orthologs, genome-wide comparison using ortholog plots demonstrated smaller extent of synteny between K. setae and Streptomyces genome (Fig. 3A–C). Many short synteny blocks were observed along either of the diagonal lines, suggesting that frequent inversions around the replication origin have had occurred. This is in contrast to the higher extent of colinearities with only 2–4 inversions observed in comparative analysis among Streptomyces genomes.3–5 Conserved core region of the K. setae genome predicted by threading major synteny blocks was ~5 Mb in length ranging from KSE_13770 to KSE_57600, which is ~1 Mb smaller than the core regions deduced from comparison among Streptomyces genomes.5 Long-range synteny between K. setae and C. acidiphila genomes was much less obvious compared with that between K. setae and Streptomyces genomes (Fig. 3D), although the number of orthologous gene pairs between K. setae and C. acidiphila (3185) was only 10% smaller than that between K. setae and Streptomyces (3498–3550, Table 1). Synteny between the genomes of K. setae NBRC 14216T and S. coelicolor A3(2) (A), K. setae NBRC 14216T and S. avermitilis MA-4680T (B), K. setae NBRC 14216T and S. griseus IFO 13350 (C) and K. setae NBRC 14216T and C. acidiphila DSM 44928 (D).

Conservation and variation of genes related to developmental regulationStreptomyces is well characterized as a model organism by its complex life cycle; it grows as a thread-like mycelium and forms aerial mycelium in the air under nutrient-limited conditions.1,2,42,43 A series of genes whose mutations cause defects in aerial growth (‘bld’ genes) were characterized in S. coelicolor A3(2). A complex interaction cascade among bld gene products results in the secretion of surfactant proteins, which assist Streptomyces in extending aerial mycelium upward and in differentiating into spores. A number of genes in ‘whi’ loci were also characterized mainly in S. coelicolor A3(2) as causing sporulation deficiency. Most of these classical differentiation genes were found to have orthologs in K. setae. The number of conserved bld and whi genes and their similarity (amino acid identity) to S. coelicolor A3(2) counterparts were higher than those in other mycelial actinobacteria, such as C. acidiphila DSM 44928, Saccharopolyspora erythraea NRRL 2333844 and Salinispora arenicola CNS 205 (Table 2), consistent with the closer morphological similarity of K. setae to Streptomyces. Notably, bld gene pairs orthologous between K. setae and Streptomyces species represented 80–97% amino acid identities, which are much higher than the average (60%) of all orthologous pairs and comparable with those between Streptomyces species. Higher than the average conservation of bld genes was also observed between C. acidiphila and Streptomyces (58–95% amino acid identities). The bldA tRNA gene was also highly conserved in K. setae, with its cognate codon UUA being the rarest in K. setae; used only in 69 predicted ORFs, most of which were either of unknown function or with predicted regulatory functions. In four completely sequenced Streptomyces genomes, only three genes were found to have a conserved UUA codon at the same position in each ortholog.45 One of these, the bldH gene, shared a UUA codon at an equivalent position also in K. setae. The high conservation of these regulatory components may further imply that each component in the regulatory cascade undergoes a higher than the usual number of interactions with other bld gene products or with other cellular components.

The amf genes are highly conserved among Streptomyces species and are necessary for the synthesis of AmfS [SapB in S. coelicolor A3(2)] surfactant protein, which is known in Streptomyces to be secreted before the initiation of aerial growth. The presence of amfAB homologs in C. acidiphila41 and S. erythraea,44 mycelial actinobacteria more distantly related to Streptomyces, may suggest that the pre-existing AmfS system was eliminated in the Kitasatospora lineage, although other possibilities such as the horizontal acquisition of these genes in each lineage cannot be excluded. In addition to the lack of the amf gene cluster, differences from Streptomyces were also suggested in the variation of paralogous components (Supplementary Table S3) such as SsgA-like proteins involved in peptidoglycan synthesis in sporogenic cell division, WhiB family transcriptional regulators and chaplins, another class of surfactant protein shown in S. coelicolor to play a part in aerial mycelium formation.46,47A number of whi genes control the process of sporulation septation and spore maturation in Streptomyces. Of the classical whi genes, whiA, whiB and whiD are commonly found in actinobacteria, and their exact functions in simpler (non-sporulating) actinobacteria need to be elucidated.1 All other whi genes, which had been considered specific to Streptomyces species,1,42 were also conserved in K. setae with remarkably high amino acid identities (69–90%). Despite such close similarities in genetic background, preliminary experimental results suggest that K. setae produces seemingly less mature spores compared with Streptomyces; (i) although K. setae genome encodes full set of whiE gene cluster (encoding biosynthetic enzymes for polyketide spore pigment), no expression of whiE genes nor the production of spore pigment was observed in any culture conditions for sporulation, (ii) both aerial and submerged spores produced by K. setae are much more sensitive to freeze-thaw cycles than those of Streptomyces (S. Kitani and H. Ikeda, unpublished observations). Further studies are needed to elucidate mechanisms underlying such differences.The initiation of secondary metabolite synthesis is known to be linked with morphological differentiation in S. griseus via the gamma-butyrolactone autoregulator cascade. In this regard, it would be noteworthy that K. setae possesses three homologs of the autoregulator receptor: KsbA (KSE_58650), KsbB (KSE_01050t and KSE_75690t; identical genes encoded in the TIR) and KsbC (KSE_44580). However, KsbA in K. setae was experimentally confirmed to be involved only in secondary metabolism,48 but not in morphological differentiation, whereas the involvement of other two remains to be clarified. In addition, the AfsA family protein, which contains two A-factor biosynthesis repeat motifs, has been reported to be a crucial enzyme to synthesize the gamma-butyrolactone autoregulator in Streptomyces.49 Interestingly, three AfsA family proteins were encoded on the genome of K. setae: KsbS2 (KSE_01060t and KSE_75680t; identical and present in the TIR, similar to the case of KsbB), KsbS3 (KSE_22970) and KsbS4 (KSE_44600). These findings suggested that there might be a more complicated signaling network for secondary metabolism and/or morphological differentiation in K. setae.3.4. Genes involved in peptidoglycan biosynthesisOne of the most important features of the genus Kitasatospora from the chemotaxonomic viewpoint is that the cell wall peptidoglycan contains both ll-DAP and meso-DAP.14,15 DAP analysis of Kitasatospora strains showed that spores contain only ll-DAP, whereas mycelia contain mostly meso-DAP.16,17 This observation suggests that Kitasatospora incorporates different DAP isomers into the cell wall depending on differentiation stage. We can speculate two steps which might be responsible for the differential incorporation of DAP isomers. (i) DAP biosynthesis and isomerization: ll-DAP is isomerized to meso-DAP by dapF gene product in the course of lysine biosynthesis.50 (ii) Incorporation of DAP into peptidoglycan: the addition of DAP to UDP-N-acetylmuramyl-l-alanyl-d-glutamate precursor is catalyzed by an enzyme encoded by murE.51As in the case of Streptomyces species whose peptidoglycan is composed of ll-DAP, K. setae had only one murE gene (KSE_21280), which is located in the center of a long conserved dcw (division cell wall) cluster. Amino acid residues known to be responsible for substrate recognition in the enzymes from meso-DAP containing bacteria are also conserved in the enzymes from ll-DAP containing bacteria including Streptomyces. The MurE protein purified from E. coli can incorporate ll-DAP in addition to meso-DAP, the natural substrate in this bacterium.52 Thus, the MurE protein may not be responsible for the differentiation-dependent alterations in peptidoglycan synthesis, unless the substrate specificity is regulated by unknown factor(s). On the other hand, K. setae had three dapF genes (KSE_32600, KSE_32630 and KSE_53750) whose products share highly conserved active site residues. Phylogenetic analysis based on amino acid sequences showed that two of the DapF proteins (encoded by KSE_32600 and KSE_53750) were closely related to those from ll-DAP containing actinobacteria such as Streptomyces species and Nocardioides sp. BAA-499/JS614 (Fig. 4A). In contrast, the third DapF protein (KSE_32630) was positioned apart from the actinobacterial groups, but in the vicinity of proteins from meso-DAP containing Listeria, Lactobacillus and Clostridium. In the dapF mutant strain of E. coli, an increase in ll-DAP containing peptidoglycan was observed,52 suggesting that the relative size of ll- and meso-DAP pools would affect the composition of peptidoglycan. Differential regulation of the multiple dapF genes, or their protein products, in the course of morphological differentiation might play an important role in the change in peptidoglycan composition.

The distribution of peptidoglycan amino acid component is also presented in (A). Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) PBPs and their orthologs were grouped and expression patterns were assigned according to Noens et al.55 in (B); those known to be expressed in aerial mycelium and vegetative mycelium are shown by AM and VM, respectively. Amino acid sequences were derived from the HAMAP database (MF_00197).Amino acid phylogenetic trees of DapF (A) and HMW-PBPs (B).

Amino acid sequences were derived from the HAMAP database (MF_00197).Streptomyces, a representative of mycelial bacteria, is known to have two distinct modes of cell division. During vegetative growth, cell division occurs occasionally resulting in widely and irregularly spaced cross-walls. In sporulating mycelia, in contrast, sporulating septa are deposited in a coordinated manner resulting in regularly spaced spores.53 The latter suggests a regulated synthesis of peptidoglycan at septa and spore walls. High-molecular weight PBPs (HMW-PBPs) catalyze the cross-linking of peptidoglycan peptides. Streptomyces contain a number of HMW-PBP genes of which some were shown to be expressed at specific stages of differentiation.54,55Kitasatospora setae seems to have nine HMW-PBP genes, one of which (KSE_46190) being highly homologous to S. coelicolor A3(2) genes (SCO3771 and SCO3156) known to be expressed during aerial growth and sporulation. On the other hand, the gene (SCO5039) specifically expressed in vegetative mycelium in S. coelicolor seemed not conserved in K. setae (Fig. 4B). Such differences in stage-specific PBPs could also be reflected in differentiation specific incorporation of peptidoglycan units in K. setae. In this context, it is also interesting to note that SsgA-like family proteins (SALPs), likely involved in the regulation of peptidoglycan synthesis in sporogenic cell division, are much diversified in K. setae compared with Streptomyces. Kitasatospora setae encodes at least 12 SALPs, about twice as many as those found in Streptomyces species (Supplementary Table S3).3.5. Gene clusters for secondary metabolite biosynthesesBacteria belonging to the genus Kitasatospora have been explored as potential new sources of various bioactive metabolites.56Kitasatospora setae NBRC 14216T is known to produce setamycin (bafilomycin B1), which bears antitrichomonal activity.57 A total of 24 genes or gene clusters in the K. setae genome were predicted to be involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites (Table 3). Of the 24 clusters, more than 60% (16 clusters) were located in subtelomeric regions; 11 were in the right subtelomeric region, whereas 5 were in the left subtelomeric region. The number of predicted gene clusters for secondary metabolism was slightly lower than that predicted in Streptomyces species (36 in S. griseus IFO 13350, 37 in S. avermitilis MA-4680T, 30 in S. coelicolor A3(2) and at least 20 in S. scabies 87.22), but apparently higher than that in other prokaryotes,58 underscoring the importance of the genus Kitasatospora as the source of bioactive compounds. Biosynthetic genes of secondary metabolites in K. setae NBRC 14216TaKSE_00200t was embedded in TIR and identical to KSE_76540t.Biosynthetic genes of secondary metabolites in K. setae NBRC 14216TaKSE_00200t was embedded in TIR and identical to KSE_76540t.Of the 24 clusters, 5 were estimated for terpene biosynthesis, 12 for polyketides or non-ribosomal peptides, 2 for siderophores and 5 for lantibiotics and others. Five ORFs containing the terpene synthase domain (IPR005630) were classified by the phylogenetic analysis described by Komatsu et al.,59 indicating that KSE_46080 was in the group of germacradienol/geosmin synthase60,61 and KSE_70210 in the group of 2-methylisoborneol synthase. Consistently, geosmin and 2-methylisoborneol were identified from the culture of K. setae. Of the 12 clusters for polyketides or non-ribosomal peptides, setamycin (bafilomycin B1) cluster was estimated and experimentally proved to be KSE_73410–KSE_73580 (H. Ikeda, unpublished results). An 84 kb region (KSE_70410–KSE_70650) containing the cluster KSE_70570–KSE_70620 showed striking resemblance in features of gene organization and in deduced amino acid sequences of each ORF to the kirromycin biosynthetic gene cluster, the first characterized combined cis–trans-PKS cluster in Streptomyces collinus Tu 365.62 This region was experimentally confirmed to be responsible for the biosynthesis of factumycin, an antibiotic structurally related to kirromycin (H. Ikeda, unpublished results). Regarding the two siderophore clusters, the one (KSE_12660–KSE_12700) showed good similarity in gene arrangement and deduced amino sequence of each ORF to a cluster in S. avermitilis (SAV_7320–SAV_7323, lacking a homolog corresponding to KSE_12680), both of which were similar to vibrioferrin cluster identified in Vibrio parahaemolyticus.63 Another one (KSE_53800–KSE_53830) was similar in gene arrangement to the rhizobactin cluster in Sinorhizobium meliloti,64 but differed from any of the known siderophore biosynthesis clusters of Streptomyces. Interestingly, K. setae lacks a gene cluster for nocardamin (desferrioxamine) biosynthesis that was commonly found in genome-sequenced Streptomyces species.58,653.6. ConclusionStreptomycetes are thought to have emerged ~440 million years ago. At present, Streptomyces species are some of the most highly differentiated microorganisms with a complex life cycle. The cell wall peptidoglycan composed of ll-DAP is another feature to be considered to distinguish Streptomyces from other sporoactinomycetes. Here, we analyzed the first genome sequence of a Streptomycetaceae bacterium other than Streptomyces species. Phylogenetic analysis based on amino acid sequences, together with a genome-wide comparison of the predicted genes such as those related to morphological differentiation and cell wall biosynthesis, suggests that the genera Streptomyces and Kitasatospora were diverged directly from their last common ancestor. The chromosomal linearity and the presence of the TIR sequence would also be the features inherited from the common ancestor. Many differentiation-related genes highly conserved in K. setae and Streptomyces species might have been acquired sequentially in the evolution, as previously suggested from the comparison of Streptomyces with other groups of mycelial actinobacteria, Thermobifida fusca and Frankia species.1,42 If additional genomic sequences determined more recently such as C. acidiphila, S. erythraea, Salinispora species and K. setae were taken into consideration, however, the evolutionary pathway of differentiation-related genes seemed not necessarily be straightforward, and gene losses and horizontal acquisitions, in particular lineage, might also have to be considered (Table 2). Phylogenetic data presented in Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. S2 also suggest that mycelial actinobacteria are not monophyletic; some organisms such as S. erythraea and T. fusca belong to sub-branches that also contain bacteria without most of the developmental genes. Extraordinary high similarity observed in bld regulatory genes, which are dispersed in the genome, might also reflect recent horizontal transfer. Although the highly regulated differentiation system of Streptomyces has attracted much attention, reasons for the unique abundance of ll-DAP in peptidoglycan may have been overlooked. We provided the possible background of the relative abundance of meso- and ll-DAP in K. setae. Further analysis and comparison of two genera, including genome sequencing of another Kitasatospora species, will provide deeper understanding of the evolution of actinobacteria.Supplementary DataSupplementary Data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.We thank S.
